                Dean Lennox Kelly returns for the landmark 100th
                episode of Shameless, as Mickey give Mimi an
                ultimatum: either the new boiler goes or he does; and
                suddenly Micky finds himself on The Jockey sofa.
                Kelly tells Marty to keep his distance but it's
                easier said than done. There's uproar in The Jockey
                when Frank pockets Cynthia's scratch card. And when
                Cynthia is assaulted, Frank becomes the prime
                suspect. Carl kicks off against the accusers, but
                Kelly shows Carl CCTV footage of Frank near the crime
                scene. Frank remembers nothing but scratch marks on
                his chest tell a different story. While Frank hands
                himself in, a distressed Carl seeks to prove his
                dad's innocence and phones Kev Ball, who returns to
                the Chatsworth like a knight in shining armour. New
                video footage jogs Frank's memory, but puts him in a
                stickier situation. Can a deal be made with gangster
                Growbag Macready? Frank's fate rests in his hands.
