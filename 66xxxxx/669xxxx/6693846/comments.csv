Just look back at backspace24 his answer:
.
for getting application errors:
.
run F1_2011_Launcher.exe instead of the original launcher.

,hd5670,2012-02-16T18:47Z,"hi my review below
1.download @ 120kbps  on a 250kbps connection. 4 hrs approx
2.freaky installation (u will say WTF! for sure) 
3.you will see win cmd screens flying all over and lame razor 1911 and TPTB  intros 
and ask you 2 type any key to install (which takes about 12 min) 
after this done.total install size of 7.66 GB.
4.you will see ""F1 by TPTB""  icon on desktop double click to open
5.you will again see razor 1911 intro all his works from past and his fans etc etc (lame). 
6.press Esc  to launch game.
7.now make a offline Win live offline account so you can save your game progress.
(now if u already have an account u may login, or if u have other games on ur pc like dirt 3, batman, BF3 etc you may choose existing account and login)
8. setup your keybord  buttons for controls (since default keys are fucked up n un natural)
9. set up graphics option and your set.
10. enjoy da fukin game.

overall rating 6.5/10 for this game and download and installation.

what pissed me off?
every time you launch da game you will see razor 1911 intro but hit escape key 2 skip it and launch game. wtf!
well guys @ razor 1911 and tbtb , we all get it. dat u guys do your best but why da fuck dis branding your names into da game its annoying.

well ny way enjoy guys and reply for any help needed. "

ps. great game"
,jozao,2012-04-17T00:48Z,"THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION(ALSO FOR RAZOR)

1 - UNINSTALL AND REINSTALL GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE(PROBABLY YOU HAVE IT FOR OTHER GAMES) - FIX XLIVE.DLL(WHICH YOU CANNOT SEE BUT IT MAKES THE GAME CLOSE)

2 - INSTALL ALL SOFTWARE LOCATED IN ""REDIST"" FOLDER

3 - COPY THE FILES FROM CRACK TO F1 2011 FOLDER

4 - RUN LAUNCHER AND PRESS ESC,NOW YOU CAN PLAY IT !!

5 - IF THE CRACK NOT WORKS DOWNLOAD THIS magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ECDAE22F08056D7DF439CA98FA8E91682D727DF5&dn=F1%202011%20-%20Razor%201911-Skidrow%20WORKING%20Crack%20Fix%20by%20HeXjUnKiE&tr=udp%3a//denis.stalker.h3q.com%3a6969/announce
