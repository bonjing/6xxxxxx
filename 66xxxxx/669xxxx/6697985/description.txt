After the Beta release of PS3 Media Server on August 18th by PS3 developer SubJunk,
news came to us that he has now released the official PS3 Media Server v1.40.0. For those
of you that are new to the scene, firstly - welcome, secondly - some info regarding this piece
of homebrew.
PS3 Media Server is a DLNA-compliant (Digital Living Network Alliance Wiki) Universal
Plug and Play (UPnP) Media Server. Originally written to support the PlayStation 3, PS3
Media Server has been expanded to support a range of other media renderers, including
smartphones, televisions, music players and more. Because it is written in Java, PS3 Media
Server supports all major operating systems, with versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS
X. The program streams or transcodes many different media formats with little or no
configuration. It is powered by MEncoder, FFmpeg, tsMuxeR and AviSynth, which combine
to offer support for a wide range of media formats.
