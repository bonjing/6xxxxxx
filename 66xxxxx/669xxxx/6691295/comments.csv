,bart001fr,2011-09-28T20:31Z,"Unfortunately it looks like the poster is a newb who doesn't know how to seed a torrent. 

It is today the 28th and still nothing, so I'm dumping this.

If he does decide to seed this properly he should start a new torrent so it will come in on a new day, not simply reseed this one.
