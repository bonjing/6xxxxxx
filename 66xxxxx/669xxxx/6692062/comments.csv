,osker246,2011-09-21T20:32Z,"Is this an update that you apply? Or is this the actual software with the update? If so, does the key from the previous release still work?"

Previous key is still working"

,Mike42S,2011-09-21T23:54Z,Can someone repost the serial? I forgot to save it and now my dad wants Parallels 7 as well.
,thefog71,2011-09-22T06:12Z,@Mike42S ...Buy the Software!!! or Download the Torrent ..Sick Fuck!!!
,thefog71,2011-09-22T06:16Z,@Mike42S Go buy the software!!! or download the torrent!!!! Sick Fucking Spies!!! 
,n1ghtw0lf,2011-09-22T06:17Z,"@Mike425 you'll find it in the application menu bar at license info or whatever, btw for those already activated i'd say you better get it from the official web site, more reliable"
,owen2nz,2011-09-22T06:54Z,how likely is it that ill get caught downloading this now since im in New Zealand and they have the three strike law in now?
,Metalol123,2011-09-22T18:45Z,"I FINALLY made this work, and here's what I did, in case anyone else is wondering:

1. Downloaded torrent
2. Installed PD7
3. Did NOT click Activate or anything when installation finished!
4. Downloaded TextWrangler from AppStore
5. Went into Finder -> Go -> Go to Folder -> Typed /etc -> Pressed Enter
6. Locate the file named Hosts in the /etc folder (there is no file extension), Right-click, choose Open In: TextWrangler. 
7. TextWrangler should now open the document. 
8. There are already some lines of text, just click the first empty line below the existing text, and paste 
127.0.0.1 parallels.com 
127.0.0.1 registration.parallels.com
127.0.0.1 update.parallels.com 
127.0.1.1 pd6.blist.parallels.com
127.0.0.1 pd7.blist.parallels.com
127.0.0.1 pdfm7.blist.parallels.com
that, into the document.
9. Save the changes (if you get an Error code 5000, google it - cba writing the fix here, but its explained in one of the first few links that appear on google)
10. Now you can click Activate and use the serial which is provided in the addict.txt document!

Done! "

,nemosrings,2011-10-03T09:20Z,"Another NoOb question lol ... is it necessary to use TextWrangler, why not simply use TextEdit? Seemed to work for me on previous occasion from memory. TextEdit opens most files with drag & drop or set default."
,chitoac,2011-10-05T19:18Z,"I got the error -5000 and this is what i did

Step 1 â€“ Open the Terminal.app

Either by start typing Terminal on the Spotlight, or by going into Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.

Step 2 â€“ Open the hosts file

Open the hosts by typing on the Terminal that you have just opened:

sudo nano /private/etc/hosts

Type your user password when prometed. again you wont see the password this is normal

Step 3 â€“ Edit the hosts file

just copy paste de code provide in the torrent on the next empty line available  REMEMBER you can only navigate using the arrow keys from on the terminal 
this are the lines i pasted provided in the torrent:

127.0.0.1 pd6.blist.parallels.com
127.0.0.1 pd7.blist.parallels.com
127.0.0.1 pdfm7.blist.parallels.com
127.0.0.1 registration.parallels.com
127.0.0.1 parallels.com
127.0.0.1 update.parallels.com

Step 4 â€“ Save the hosts file

When done editing the hosts file, press control-o to save the file and Press Enter on the filename prompt, and control-x to exit the editor.

then close the terminal and you are done.
 to recheck is your host file change, locate host file open with text editor and you should see your text change

sorry my english ! hope it helps"

,Jeepster1,2011-10-11T20:22Z,"Stop press!

caught parallels trying to contact:

127.0.0.1 pdfm7.cepreport.parallels.com

Don't know if it's of any significance, so its completely up to anyone if they want to include or not. Hope it may help!"
,geeezyfbaby,2011-10-13T21:21Z,"I've had parallels 7 installed for months and months , activated and working perfect using said instructions and serial (running Windows 7 VM). Leave it to my curiosity to want to try the developer preview of Windows 8 (free dl from microsoft), so I decide to try to add a new VM, then realize to do so I must upgrade to parallels v. 7.0.14924.699487 (newest)......I didn't know I would have to activate again, I assumed it would just upgrade...wrong. serial is now BL'd and does not work (as others have recently posted as well), even when modifying the /etc/hosts and using little snitch. Anyone know a workaround such as modifying other files or have a new DL link? TIA"
,kkcci00000,2011-10-16T10:55Z,"MUST NOT download while you install this PD7 from the official website OR you will get the 'the key you entered cannot be activated beca....'

I re-install it using the file downloaded from here and everything is working fine (of course, needs to edit the host file)

However, my PD6's Windows7 needs to re-activate after re-install the PD7 components...

Anyway, Thanks"

,Pessimistic1,2011-10-21T18:37Z,"Downloaded this last night. Installed it this morning. I used the key provided and it activated with no problem. Migrated my PC (Win 7) to my Mac (249GB) and it is working flawlessly!! Did not have to edit ""hosts"" file or anything else. Key is good as of 10/21/2011. THANKS FOR THE TORRENT AND WORK!"
,Jeepster1,2011-10-23T12:14Z,"Can anyone confirm if key is working with the newer 7.0.14924 version? cheers

Wan't to see if the so-far 'failed' claimed big improvements with gaming may actually work in the latest version 7.0.14924 because I didn't experience it in version 7.0.14920 and sadly the same applied for the torrent version 7.0.14922 that joskewarez kindly uploaded here for us all (much appreciated).

Dont't get me wrong games function (except Dead Island for some reason that only runs in Bootcamp), however the performance isn't that good with frame-rates suffering making them unplayable compared to when booting solely in Bootcamp."
,alamery,2011-10-24T21:30Z,"BEST WAY TO COPY THE LOCAL HOST OR CHANGE IT:

1. go to finder and click and hold on it, choose Go to Folder
2. type      /etc
3. look for file named hosts inside the folder
4. copy file and paste it in desktop
5. change the file attributes before edit, and keep it ( Read & Write )
6. open the hosts file and edit everything you want
7. save the file and exit
8. go to original file and move it to trash or delete it
9. put the amended file in to the original file ( etc )


That's all, and I'm so sorry for any wrong writing"

,juicyboy2011,2011-12-27T07:21Z,"Hey Guys,
I would really appreciate some help.
I downloaded parallels 7(this torrent) and i find myself having a hard time getting it going. I also got my hands on the windows 7 to install with it. I just bought a mac, and im not to familiar with how this shit works. Really, im downloading parallels so i can get acid pro 7 working on the windows operating system since i cant put it on mac. If theres an option im not aware of out there that would help me avoid parallels and windows on my computer, id appreciate some help!! But in regards to this program, im not sure what to do as far as editing terminals and such. The Key activates the software, but it doesnt visibly do anything on the computer... if theres a how to guide someone can point me to or perhaps some guidance my fellow pirates can give me, it would help me out a great deal! thanks "

""There is no operating system installed in this virtual machine. Please insert an operating system installation CD into the optical drive of your Mac and restart the virtual machine.""

I have chosen the iso as an install point during the installation but for some reason I continue to run into this issue... I'm not a super nub at comps/mac just a bit turned around at the moment and would seriously appreciate a bit of help
