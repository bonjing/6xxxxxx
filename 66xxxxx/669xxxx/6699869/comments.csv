,Dasukeboi,2012-01-23T22:30Z,"I'm an enthusiastic fan of the series and movie, but must say this fan production was disappointing; two hours of my life I'll never get back. The acting was mediocre at best, the script was contrived and the plot far-fetched without any sense of purpose or significance in the scheme of the Firefly lore. The protagonist captain had about as much charisma and leadership qualities as genital warts and, realisitically, would be unlikely to hold down a crew; she makes me think of borderline personality disorder sufferers. As a sidenote, Baldwin's cameo was extremely brief and his character, as far as I'm aware, was not supposed to be portraying Jayne but just a random telecoms operator.

Perhaps it is just my lack of understanding with VLC Media Player and how to rig settings, but given the 7GB filesize, I expected DVD-quality footage and instead saw grainy, ill-defined 480p-esque images. The audio appeared of good quality.

To those who, like me, suffered loss at the demise of Firefly and wished to make their experience last that little bit longer, I'd recommend watching the series again to reminisce rather than downloading this disappointing tribute. Nevertheless, I commend the team who produced it for at least trying to revive a legendary series, and hope my comments if anything spur future productions that strive for better."
