The Global Network has a new one hour video called "The Battle for America's Soul" based on a 2005 speech by GN Coordinator Bruce Gagnon. The speech was delivered at the Emmanual Mennonite Church in Gainesville, Florida during a speaking tour across that state.

The one-hour video covers the mythology of America, corruption within the military industrial complex, plans for U.S. control of space, the corporate destruction of the American economy, America's addiction to weapons and war, and concludes with a transformative vision for the nation.
