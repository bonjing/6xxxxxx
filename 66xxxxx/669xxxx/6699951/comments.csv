CamRIP by the way not DVD.

I think worth waiting for better.

Thanks

Almost all Hollywood movies are premiered in India before they are released in US. Most of the Hollywood movie starts are eager to work in Bollywood movies. It has been a Gold rush to India last year by tons of Hollywood stars. Isn't that ""Invasion"". 
@akkills
US and world economy is surviving due to India and China, without them who know you might be standing with a cardboard saying ""Will work for food"" on a your beautiful highways."
