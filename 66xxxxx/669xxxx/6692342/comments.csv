It also introduces a new multiplayer mode (“Capture the Flag”) and three additional weapons: the M200 and L96 sniper rifles and the Desert Eagle high caliber pistol. To put your skills to the ultimate test we also included the Challenge map."

Sorry if this is a dumb question.... I'll try a jump drive/flash drive once its all downloaded."
