This is a compressed version of my own League of Legends game, which has been modified to work, and I don't have the capability to compress this much more without waiting hours for it to finish and using a lot of my CPU.  Also, because this is just a compressed version of my own game, when you open it, my account name will be in the account field, just delete it and log in with your own account!"

You can find it here: http://boompje.webege.com/

This version has been updated by Boompje to have better performance, as well as to work after the shutdown.

Because of this, I will no longer be seeding this torrent. I have already uploaded it to 5 other people, who should be able to continue the seeding if they so wish.

Good luck!"
