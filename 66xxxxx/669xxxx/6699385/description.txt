Sergio Leone created the Spaghetti western when he remade Youjimbo as A Fistful of Dollars. His directorial style and skill for incorporating Ennio Morricone's music has long been inspiring and copied by filmmakers for decades. 

Included Dollars Trilogy:

A Fistful of Dollars (1964) Blu-ray rip and Soundtracks.

For a Few Dollars More (1965) Blu-ray rip and Soundtracks.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) Extended cut with 20 minutes of added film, Blu-ray rip and Soundtrack.


Once Upon a Time Trilogy:

Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) Restored Edition (165 min) Blu-Ray rip and Soundtracks. Restored and Remastered Soundtracks overlap but allow for the most complete collection of Ennio's most successful and enduring score.

Duck, You Sucker! (1971) Also known as a Fistful of Dynamite Blu-Ray rip and Soundtrack.

Once Upon a Time in America (1984) Theatrical Cut minus intermission Blu-Ray rip and Soundtracks. 

I do not take credit for producing the rips I have only compiled all that I can.


Enjoy and Seed!!
