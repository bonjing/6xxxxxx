This is all 26 episodes of this mini-series starring Rebecca Gooden as Bella. Set in Australia, at least 20 years after the 1990 series of the same name set in New Zeland. I say that because this series has a 'model-T' type automobile and telephones in it and the in 1990 New Zeland series electricity was just being discovered.

This is NOT a season two or three, but a stand-alone mini-series, done kinda like a soap in that each episode has a little cliff-hanger and the next show has a recap.

TV Caps only, quality is weak at best and that's because of the source, guess the tapes the cable network used were old!

Will seed until at least November 30, 2011
