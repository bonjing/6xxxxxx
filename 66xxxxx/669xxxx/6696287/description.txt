Summary/Plot:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Four rogues, who were best friends as kids, have one big problem: they\\\'re sitting on both sides of the law. Martin is a policeman, while Nikolai, Ralf, and Timo can\\\'t distinguish between personal possessions and the possessions of others! When all four find themselves in a fix, they\\\'re forced to return to their former tricks against a common foe, Mr Niemeyer. Martin is not as successful, however, either at his job or marriage, and thinks he deserves a better life. Now he sees an opportunity to save his career by \\\"playing\\\" with his old friends on a mission that is so crazy that even the two foolish brothers can do some good.
