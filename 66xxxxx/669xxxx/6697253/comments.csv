Perfect!

@dude2030, stop spamming EZTV's comments with your bullshit. There is no audio sync problem. EZTV's torrents are 100% legit and always work. Take your spamming bullshit elsewhere.

,stikasasn,2011-09-28T04:37Z,"@ davidvb. Dude relax. It's like your sleeping with eztv or something. lol The sound is a TINY TINY bit off but totally watchable if you play it in WMP but when I played it in VLC it was totally in sync. 

A: 10 V: 10"

First of all, I posted an alternative link to help SEVERAL other people who reported ""sound off sync"" problem. 

Second, only COWARDS use curse words towards others over Internet, because they can get away with it. Unlike in the real life. "
