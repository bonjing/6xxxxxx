,scothuman,2011-10-02T22:25Z,"@bajabiz - Did you look at the difference in file sizes?  The non-RARed version is less than 100MB larger.  I suppose if you have a DSL connection or live underwater and use some kind of acoustic modem, then yes, it will take 
""much longer"".

As for me, on well-seeded torrents, I usually hit at least 3MB/s.  My HDD on my downloading machine is crap.  Therefore, it will take me about 30 seconds more to download the extra 100 megs, and probably over a minute to extract the files from the archive.

Then, incidentally, I'm not leaving the nonsense RAR files on my machine once I have the extracted the precious video file from within.  Hence, I won't seed it.  

RARs are a plague when it comes to _already well-compressed_ video files.  If your connection is so slow that the 100 meg takes you ""much longer"" to DL, then why don't you just grab the SD version of the show?"
,Gh057man,2011-10-09T07:12Z,Well explained scothuman. For the reasons you stated rar'ed files are a extremely inefficient way to provide an uploaded video file. As I've said else where - Sceneline - you are a cum muffin for doing so!!  
,Gh057man,2011-10-09T07:16Z,BTW ... the file here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6712937/Person.of.Interest.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE is the same size and unrar'ed.
,balanced,2011-10-30T13:23Z,"I'm downloading the non RAR'd version as fast as my pipe will allow and I can start watching it before it's finished and I don't have to have two copies of it on my system for purposes of ""1 for watching and another one for seeding""

Fuckheads need to learn that TORRENTS AREN'T NNTP / USENET and therefore DO NOT REQUIRE packaging and in fact are INFERIOR when packaged. "
,sidnik,2011-12-17T17:33Z,SEED !!!
,sidnik,2011-12-17T17:33Z,SEEED!!
,jctcom,2012-01-14T11:36Z,Please stop Rarring Video files if you want a high seed.  The reasons for Raring this type of file went away years ago.  And I won't be keeping two copies on my hard drive just to be able to seed it.   There is no good reason to Rar this type of file!  Thank you to GH057man for the link to the unrar'ed file which I will be happy to download and seed.
