If you have DVD-Audios to share please post! Love hi-def audio."
,DDDamian,2011-09-23T16:16Z,"FYI - process was: Ripped DVD-Audio to .wav files using DVD-Audio Explorer, used eac3to to compress to 24bit flac, then tagged audio using Winamp. All completely lossless bit-for-bit. Figured more ppl could play flacs than true DVD-Audio as it requires a dedicated piece of hardware. These files have bitrates too high for DVD-Video players or Toslink/optical/coax playback. Either send via HDMI to your stereo or rebuild as a DVD-Audio using the Cirlinca products. Alternately you can create an AVCHD or Blu-ray disc as BD players can transfer these high bitrates  :)"
,DDDamian,2011-09-27T20:49Z,Please don't hit-and-run ppl. At least 50 ppl should be seeding right now but buggered off. If you aren't willing to seed for a while please don't download!!!!!
