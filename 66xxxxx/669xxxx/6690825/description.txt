Cry Freedom (1987 Denzel W) Steve Biko Died Unviolently Warring for Humanity

Apartheid South Africa:  Circa 1977, a full 15 years or so before \'success\' would be seen and apartheid removed the 1 in 100,000 Extremely Humane (the only one\'s aLive) stood as men, and women, should stand - they chose Life - and like Jesus, King, Gandhi, our bravest in Afghanistan, the Egyptian revolutionaries and YOU, their choice cost them, and Gave them.  It cost them ultimately, their pulse.  But they valued somethings more - Life, the Life of their Human Family, Loving, Conscience, Being Good (Divine), JOY....

And you?  How much longer will you trade the Life they had, that you are entitled to, for the trinkets, coins, Safety, Security, Stuff, Superiority, Systems and institutions you prostitute you and those you influence for?

Biko is the way.

Gandhi is the way.  \'I consider myself a Soldier for Peace.\'

MLK Jr. is the way. \'Anyone can be great, because anyone can Serve [Humanity].\' 

Jesus is the way.  \'Love as I have Loved.\'  \'As you do unto the Least of These MY FAMILY, you do unto me.\'
