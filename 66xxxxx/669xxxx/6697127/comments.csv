Thx for the info it worked, and no need to delete the file either thx!

But the game has serious issues with the input. I use a Xbox 360 controller and its a delay in the steering with like 1 second. Really disturbing. Or is it just me? 

I meet the recomended sys req.

5. Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation
6. Play the game"

,LuigiVuoto,2011-09-27T00:05Z,"Works perfectly.  i5/WinXP/Radeon 4650.  Getting HD resolution very smoothly. 

The 60fps is just beautiful.

Be careful though, XP users.  The installation instructions in the nfo might be a little confusing.  You probably won't see any C:/users/.. directory, and if you search your hard drive you may not find a settings.yml file anywhere on your computer.  If you copy the crack over, a Ubisoft launcher directory with a settings.yml file gets created though.  But by then you don't have to delete it.

Also, for those of you who have other Ubisoft games (even cracked ones), there has been no problem running Dragon Age 2 or other Ubi games since installing Driver.

It's a pretty cool game, too.  I would have like to have seen what Criterion could have done with this material, but it's not bad as is.  "

a simple questions guys? the game works great but it seems i cannot play it with my Logitech Rumblepad 2, i mean, i can accelerate, brake..but CANNOT FIND THE STEERING WHEEL...any help ? i cannot turn left, right..i can look left and right but not turn :(


Metalprofi666, I have the same gamepad and I use this works perfect :

http://virusdev.ovh.org/files/xinputemu/x360ce%20vibmod%203.1.4.1.zip

use only the last 3 files, and passte them on your game folder to emulate x360 gamepad. 

files ""x360ce.ini"" + ""xinput1_3.dll"" + ""XInputTest.exe"" the last one is optional only to test the if the rumble pad is working ok."

,hybridmoments82,2011-09-29T23:23Z,"@Mauriiceee

1. There is no activation key, so you don't need one.

2. You shouldn't be attempting to extract the files from the ISO itself. Instead, you should be either burning the ISO to a disc or mounting it using virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools, Alcohol, PowerISO, etc."

MAIN FIX!! LOOK HERE
Now with that out of the way.  With people having issues finding seetings.yml YOU MUST and i say must enable your computer to show hidden files because well as you guessed it Appdata is a hidden folder as long as all its content..

That should fix everyones problem until you get 90% done the game.  And i'm having issues here..

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I warned you...







Once you get out of the coma and you are cruising down the freeway, the game just crashes and shuts down.  The exact moment, is when the radio chick says ""Oh god Oh god, I see a big cloud of...."" along with a big bang...

Ok after you install the game/go to the start button/computer/double click on your c:drive to open it/there should be a program files or program files(86) click to open/there should be a Ubisoft folder click and open that/there should be a driver San Francisco folder click and open that.
Copy the files from the Skidrow folder into there and overwrite the original files.
right click the driver application, the one with the little picture and send to desktop (create shortcut) close everything up click the new shortcut and if your computer and g/card can handle it then your good to go, have fun mate.

Both Pc's are running windows 7 Ultimate x64.
is there any kind of fix for this?
thanks!"

,Rick_Terminal5,2011-10-12T00:16Z,"Like a few others - it worked first time, but not the second.  Eventually I *deleted* the ""offline.ini"" and it loaded :)  Maybe I'll have to do that every time - who knows.

Not sure why this game is getting flamed so much, it is much more like real driving - maybe those who hate it don't drive yet?"

Oh, and Simolino?  You are a complete and utter prick."
,simolino,2011-10-12T05:02Z,"Alright, I decided I'm going to be kind to you this time, just because I'm a kind person...so here's how I did it:

1)You install the game (custom installation installs it in any drive you want).

2) Once the game is done installing, look for a folder that says UPDATE inside the ISO. Run this Update and update the game. (maybe this is what many of you are forgetting, that's why it doesn't FUCKEN WORK)

3)copy and paste ALL the files, highlight them all, copy them and paste them directly to the install directory of the game. (Don't worry about which file goes in which folder, the files will just automatically paste themselves and replace the correct files in the correct folders).

4)fire up the game, HAVE FUN MOTHERFUCKERS =)"
,C00kieAlien,2011-10-12T12:15Z,"For those who can't find the file settings.yml
1. Press the windows button and R at the same time.
2. Then write appdata.
3. Click on the folder local.
4. Now find the ubisoft folder and there you should find the settings.yml"

And it will work the second time and so on without any problems in the cutscenes and red truck mission also. im past all of this and my game has not crashed or hung up in any way. The only problem im getting is this lag in game. its for 3 or so seconds and then it gets back to normal. Now i have updated my graphics driver and changed resolution and settings like a million times but i cant get rid of this lag. and sometimes it also tears up in game. like a black shade will appear on a patch of road or somthing and this tearing only happened after i changed the settings alot of my graphics card. Plus i can play F1 2011, Assasins creed brotherhood and every other game without any problems ever. i have never had this lag problem in any game but this one. I would really appreciate any help by an expert in this matter. Sorry for bad grammar. love the torrents by skidrow and the good seeders involved in it.

Plus the games you mentioned are already old and can't be even compared with todays games, graphic wise. Most of the games now require a dual-core processors and 2+ gb ram if you have vista or 7, heck even XP to run everything on max settings. That issue can not be crossed. You need better computer.
It's a clear torrent, no issues, the others who are complaining about, don't know how to install the game or have  low-spec PCs and maybe other issues, but the torrent is fine."

There is a typo in the install notes though. Settings.yml is in

Not

If you can't get this to run, or if it's asking for a cd key, you obviously did something wrong.
