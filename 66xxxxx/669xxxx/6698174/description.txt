FIFA 12 KEY FEATURES

Impact Engine

The IE keeps track of individual limbs and the contact between them for the purpose of simulating realistic collisions and hit detection between players. However, the Impact Engine will not be featured in the PC version of FIFA 12.

Improved AI

The AI is now capable of realizing which parts of a player's body may be injured, and players run the risk of getting injured off the ball (i.e. sprint abuse). The AI is also said to be 'more human'.

"AI Vision"

This new system is poised to make passing more realistic than ever before by factoring a player's line of sight into the passing game (i.e. attempting to pass to a player behind the user controlled one is set to be extremely difficult to pull off.).

Enhanced AI

The AI will now adapt to the game and make better choices that will help the team.

New Arenas & Presentation

Three new arenas will be featured in FIFA 12 along with a new camera and match presentation.

Ã AND MORE

Short Dribble: Flicking the left stick can cause a new short dribble. Further information is not known at this time.

UI Improvements: A brand new, supposedly ergonomic, menu system will be in place.

Tactical defending: This makes it possible to defend in a much more advanced way. It is now much more focused on zone defence than on tackling, and therefore allows a much more realistic defensive behaviour. Instead of holding the press button, you now have to perfectly time your tackles.

---------NOTES------------

Actually there is a way to play exhibition match now.
But you need to have the demo installed.

1.Copy all the files over from the clone dvd folder "game" except for fifa.exe
2.replace the files at the demo folder except the fifa.exe.
3.Use notepad and create a file called "rna.ini" in the demo folder.
add the line "SKIP_BOOTFLOW=1" in it.
Can play exhibition for now.

But i think that the gameplay is identical to the demo due to the exe?
Career mode doesnt work.
