,Alienns,2011-09-24T13:42Z,1080p will be out soon. Since 1080p need much more time to re-encode than 720p. For good 1080p rip you need like 15-20h encoding time on intel i7 OC @4600MHz. To compare: On dual core centrino laptop you will need more than a week for same job encoding 24/7.
,Jacco12234,2011-09-24T13:58Z,Prais The Lord!!! AMEN!!
,sunnykfc,2011-09-24T14:17Z,whoever encode the movie need a good overclocker.
,comanderA,2011-09-24T14:22Z,"@Alienns: I beg to differ. 1080p can be encoded on i7-950 within a few hours if you do it :properly:. Not trying to criticize here, but frankly speaking, if you utilize your resources properly, you can get it done really fast. The encoding time also depends on the source."

To anyone who saw it in the theater, Question?

At the scene when he brings the decepticons to earth and they are attacking the city, at 1hr34mins. The movie has a couple black outs that appear intentional, but then there is a slightly weirder black out where the sound goes out too.  Was that in the theater version or did we lose a second of film there?"

I tried to find the culprit but it seems its these files. And yes, I'm talking about transformers from here (mkv.) I ran my task manager and it was eating all my RAM (I have 4GB RAM) and it was eating 3.7GB RAM. In addition, my computer was going snail speeds. I tried to delete the file and it didn't let me. I did some research and I found sometimes CPUs lock files and folders. So I used unlocker.exe and it worked. But then immediately it happened again. It dropped from 3.7GB RAM to 700MB RAM (usage.) Also this never happened before. I have old movies that are 1080p and over 6GB that worked fine. IE. KNowing and Gnomoe and Juliet. Those and others work fine (blu ray.) But these new ones are killing me. Am I the only one? It can't be my background resources as mentioned with other blu rays worked. RAM is fine and everything.
