                         HOYTS CONCERTS PRESENTS...
  
                   NIRVANA LIVE AT THE PARAMOUNT THEATRE 
  
  To mark the 20th anniversary of Nirvanas seminal album 'Nevermind', the
  previously unseen Live at the Paramount Theatre concert film will be shown 
  at selected Hoyts cinemas around the country for one night only this month.
  
  This never-before-seen live concert is being beamed direct via satellite 
  exclusive to cinemas on Friday 23 September. Live at the Paramount Theatre 
  is the only known Nirvana LIVE show recorded on 16mm film, and has never 
  been released before now. Recorded at the height of the hype surrounding 
  'Nevermind' in 1991, this worldwide cinema premiere will take place exactly 
  20 years to the day since its release.
  
  'Nevermind' elevated Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl from 
  critically-acclaimed Aberdeen, Washington cult band to generational 
  spokesmen, who had unwittingly created a cultural shift and musical 
  touchstone. Rising to the top of the charts the world over by years end, 
  and ultimately selling over 30 million copies worldwide, 'Nevermind' would 
  come to be much more than one of the most successful and influential albums 
  of its and any era.
  
  This event will be the first and only chance to experience the concert on 
  the big screen. Each ticket includes a redeemable voucher (given to patrons 
  on the night) for the 20th Anniversary 2CD Deluxe Edition of 'Nevermind',  
  featuring 40 tracks including rarities, studio outtakes, and live tracks.
  
  Hosted by Richard Kingsmill, and proudly supported by triple j and Street 
  Press Australia.
  
  'Nevermind' is 20.
