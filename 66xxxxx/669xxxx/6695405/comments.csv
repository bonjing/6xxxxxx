[T],webmodelsindex,2011-09-24T15:22Z,"It's the same person who keeps reporting my torrents as porn. He doesn't actually download them to see what they are, he just assumes they are based on the title of the upload. It's getting really annoying, and I've not only reported him on the forums, but also requested to get the categories switched back."
