,ben7530,2011-09-24T14:55Z,"Forgive my ignorance, but do ""PGS subtitles"" mean that the Romanian (?) in the beginning / intro (and the scene with the female vampire(s) are hardcoded, as it should be? I looked ""PGS"" up, and it seems like they should be present, but I have tried to download approx. 5 copies of this movie, and only the 700mb version got the subs right! 

Thanks,
