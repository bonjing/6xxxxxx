Mogwaisoft - Shade for FSX

Shade is a small program that allows you to setup custom colours/tones schemes for FSX's 3d/Terrain lighting/shadow & Fog values this allows you to alter the contrast between light and shadow tones within FSX allowing for creation of more realistic lighting conditions with much better definition/contrast.
