None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 

All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 

All have been re-encoded and cleaned up.

To everyone who don't hit and run but keep on seeding - THANKS.

This is the complete 23 episodes of Chip n Dale 1943 - 1956. Even Disney don't have it.

Navigating the menu:-
The first button or the left button can only be accessed in a clockwise
direction. Once there you can go up but can't go back.This has something to do with 23 episodes in one main menu, and it had reached it's limitations.

7 episodes do not have Czech audio and no Hungarian or Bulgarian subtitles.
 
Enjoy
