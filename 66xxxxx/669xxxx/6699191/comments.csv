[10 stars out of 10] Great

I bought this DVD on Ebay & just really watched with my husband. We both have Cherokee ancestors & it is incredible to watch this & hear West Studi talking in the Cherokee language. It adds the authenticity to the video's subject matter. I would recommend anyone purchasing this even it is to learn the history of the Cherokee. It truly tells the tale of the Cherokee's beginning in the South & their removal to OK & those who escaped to NC to live on the Qualla Boundary Reservation. You can't help but to be engrossed in this video. You will learn things that the history books don't mention. I would recommend showing this movie in a history class at a school. This is totally a wonderful movie. It is beautifully taped & narrated.
