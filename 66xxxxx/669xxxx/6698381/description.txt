Mixerland finally finished working on their new album Za Nebo(Behind the Sky), which can be named the best! The group has existed since 1992, and managed to write a lot of diverse music, but this album, was a watershed in the history of Mixerland, unique product of its kind! Mixerland - an electronic extravaganza of Depeche Mode and Kraftwerk, wicked guitar of Korn and Steve Vai, soulful vocals of A-Ha and Radiohead, frenetic drive of Marilyn Manson and Rammstein, noble polyphony of Sweet and Uriah Heep, weighted conceptual of Yes and Pink Floyd! Mixerland texts are a philosophical neo-romantic decadence. Many musicians try to stir rock and electronica, but the bottling that Mixerland do you hardly tasted before. Mixerland achieved such a bouquet of flavors and sounds, which would have dreamed of the most eminent maestro cases of electronic and acoustic. Mixerland - an international project. To record an album, we had to travel 15 500 miles! Mix more than 1000 tracks! Spend hundreds of hours in the studio! Za Nebo is the best groups album, which includes their classics in fresh arrangements and brand new songs! Listen and enjoy!
