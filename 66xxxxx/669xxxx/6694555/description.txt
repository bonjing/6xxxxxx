Plot: The espionage thriller begins in 1997, as shocking news 
reaches retired Mossad secret agents Rachel (Helen Mirren) and 
Stefan (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague David (CiarÃ¡n 
Hinds). All three have been venerated for decades by their country 
because of the mission that they undertook back in 1966, when the 
trio (portrayed, respectively, by Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, 
and Sam Worthington) tracked down Nazi war criminal Vogel (Jesper 
Christensen) in East Berlin. At great risk, and at considerable 
personal cost, the team's mission was accomplished - or was it? The 
suspense builds in and across two different time periods, with 
startling action and surprising revelations

Notes:Well first I cut it up into 72 pieces and synched each one 
now as far as cutting the scenes right I think there might be a 
sec or two that's cut but it's only a scene I didn't get right at 
the very beginning and its no big factor but it is in sync. 
I watched it with vlc and it was fine!I did enough to it. I didn't 
bother fixing it up maybe when a better version comes out I will 
but this is good enough for now. So if there's any complaints do 
it yourself!
