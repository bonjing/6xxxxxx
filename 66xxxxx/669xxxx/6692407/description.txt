A graveyard of mutated horror is uncovered deep inside a Russian mine. With Liz still missing and Abe Sapien lying on his deathbed, the newly international B.P.R.D. sends Kate and Johann to meet the Russian equivalent of the Bureau-which readers first saw in B.P.R.D.: 1946-and face an exploding fungus monster at the Kremlin, and a spreading contagion.
