REVIEWS

This set is rather unusual, for it is strictly instrumental, allowing Ray Charles a rare opportunity to be a jazz-oriented pianist. Two selections are with a trio (bassist Oscar Pettiford joins Charles on "Black Coffee"), while the other six are with a septet taken from his big band of the period. 
Key among the sidemen are David Newman (soloing on both tenor and alto) and trumpeter Joseph Bridgewater; highlights include Quincy Jones' "The Ray," "My Melancholy Baby," "Doodlin'," and "Undecided." 
Ray Charles should have recorded in this setting more often in his later years. (AMG)




It's hard to go wrong with a Ray Charles album. However, fans of the man's beautifully expressive, bluesy voice may be in for a surprise with THE GREAT RAY CHARLES. An anomaly in the artist's huge discography, this disc is wholly instrumental, focusing on Charles' outstanding, jazz-influenced piano playing. The set is a mixture of standards ("The Man I Love," "Ain't Misbehavin'"), contemporary pieces (Horace Silver's "Doodlin'," Quincy Jones' "The Ray"), and several of Charles' own fine compositions.

The absence of this entertainment legend's pipes allows the listener to fully concentrate on Charles' skill as an ivory-tickler. The musician cites both Bud Powell and Nat Cole as influences, and his style hangs beautifully in the balance between technical proficiency and a clean, emotional approach. Backed by a spare combo, this is perfect dinnertime music. A quiet but swinging album, THE GREAT RAY CHARLES only adds to the multi-talented genius' deservedly huge
