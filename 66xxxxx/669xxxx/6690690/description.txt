Fallout: New Vegas: Lonesome Road, brings the New Vegas courier\\\'s story full circle
when you are contacted by the original Courier Six, a man by the
name of Ulysses who refused to deliver the Platinum Chip
at the start of New Vegas.

In his transmission, Ulysses promises the answer as to why,
but only if you take one last job â€“a job that leads you
into the depths of the hurricane-swept canyons of the Divide,
a landscape torn apart by earthquakes and violent storms.
The road to the Divide is a long and treacherous one, and
of the few to ever walk the road, none have ever returned.
