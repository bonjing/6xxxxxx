That means the file is not complete - It may not have downloaded completely or there was an error, delete file and redownload it. It happens every so often. Ive done that opening a torrent file before it was 100% bc I wasnt paying attention."
,flense,2011-09-22T23:28Z,"uh... broken for me as well. i've deleted and redownloaded it several times, as well as opened it in winrar (0x0 jpgs), all to no avail. i even downloaded a copy off of filestube (yes, same rip, etc). so, got anything for that?"
[T],wowcabbage,2011-09-23T11:16Z,"@ flense

Have you tried using Cdisplay?"
,oldmanpoodle,2011-09-24T02:09Z,"Yeah, I accidentally moved the file to a different folder before it finished downloading, and now it won't show up in my reader. I've deleted the files, the .torrent file, and everything associated with it, redownloaded, and still nothing. Anyone have any tips? I really wanna read this!"
,kviry,2011-09-24T02:11Z,"same problem here, it shows 0x0"
,flense,2011-09-24T18:19Z,"@ wowcabbage I hadn't, but after I downloaded and installed CDisplay, it does indeed display properly. Not really my idea of a solution, but at least neither the file or my computer are totally frotzed. However, I did take and unrar it again, then batch converted it with irfanview, then RARed it again so now it works with comicrack (haha, what can i say, i just don't like CDisplay). i'd be willing to torrent that (for other folks that prefer comicrack) if it would be acceptable"
,cnester1,2011-09-25T01:36Z,"@flense

Please someone upload a comicrack viewable torrent."
,flense,2011-09-25T23:47Z,since i've seen no objections: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6701584
,bettyw,2011-10-26T09:47Z,"I am so excited for this- Thanks.
I opened this and it ran in SimpleComic for me no questions asked.
I did change the extension to .cbz though- I have my reasons."
,stijr,2011-12-21T15:42Z,thanks cabbage!!!
