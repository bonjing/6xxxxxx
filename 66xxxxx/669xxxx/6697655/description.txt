Plies has just released the first official single \\\"Just (The Tip)\\\" from his new album \\\'Purple Heart\\\'. He teams up with Ludacris and Jeremih creating a sexy, not raunchy, hiphop track. Luda lets you secretly know that \\\"...I just want to put the tip in, just enough for your water to skinny dip in, a little motion in your ocean...\\\"

HipHop artist Plies released the \\\"Just (The Tip) ft Jeremih & Ludacris\\\" song in September, 2011. The song is tight..
