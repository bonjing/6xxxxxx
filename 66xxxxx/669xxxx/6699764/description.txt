a bit of a twist on the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale...

One of my favorite actors, Mr. Baka, is here in his typical bit part as a Pole in a German flick.  We are kept wondering whether he will be evil or good-natured, as the man who discovers two lost German children in the backwoods of Poland.

From my recollection it doesn't really follow the fairy tale all that much, and the ickiness isn't wholly on the stepmother's side - the kids show themselves as pretty hard to sympathize with.

Both the German and English titles baffle me completely. Perhaps a reference to Dylan Thomas' "Under Milkwood", but I can't put two and two together.
