,mid_alex,2011-09-23T10:41Z,"@MOURGOLYKOS: give the guy a break. As you've said in numerous places, it only came out yesterday. The scanners and uploaders are paid nothing to do this. If you want it, go buy it. Please stop harassing the uploaders.

@ichiro89: Thank You!!"

It takes a lot of time and effort to scan each page, fix each image, and get them uploaded. If you want it, go buy it. Please stop harassing the uploaders.
