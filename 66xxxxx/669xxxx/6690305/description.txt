A Dry White Season [1989] Waging All-out Unviolent War against S. Africa Apartheid 

Brilliant, True example of all that Gandhi had faith in â€“ Heart Force â€“ at work.  â€˜You must be the change you wish to see in the world.â€™ Gandhi.  This is the â€˜changeâ€™ YOU must be if humanity is to have a future.

'Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for [for the sake of our global neediest]; but that she shall receive a hundred times as much [in Joy, Meaning] now in the present age... [True] brothers and sisters and mothers and children ... along with Persecutions....' Mark 10:28.

Schoolteacher Ben du Toit (Donald Sutherland) has been insulated all his life from the horrors of apartheid in his native South Africa. Perhaps he really didn't want to know. When the son of his black gardener is arrested and beaten as a result of a schoolboy protest in Soweto, at first he imagines the police must have had their reasons. However, the boy is picked up again, and this time he doesn't come back. Ben promises his servant that he will look into the incident, and discovers that the boy was killed simply to gratify the violent urges of Captain Stolz (Jurgen Prochnow), a "special branch" policeman. At long last he has gotten a glimpse into the truly arbitrary and violent nature of the system he has so long benefitted from, and he hires Ian Mackenzie (Marlon Brando) to prosecute the killer. It is a foregone conclusion that Stolz will not be punished, but Mackenzie rises to new heights of withering sarcasm and irony in the courtroom. This situation turns Ben into a radical firebrand, which alienates him from his white friends and neighbors, as well as members of his family.
