,erialleh,2011-09-24T00:14Z,"there's some skips in each song and for some odd reason the microsoft office sound for an event reminder near the end of ""mutual core"", but otherwise the sound it good. a great way to preview the fantastic album before it's released in higher quality."
,mrzebra,2011-09-24T13:18Z,"flac lossless please?
Now that we know this is not the final master & Bjork is continuing to work on the record after this version, we need this in the best quality."
,erialleh,2011-09-25T02:08Z,"given the differences in ""crystalline"" and ""cosmogony"", i would guess this is the final re-worked version of the record. no way to know until it's out, i guess."
,huhnchen,2011-10-08T20:30Z,"trfkad - Thank you!

It's a 10/10 to my ears and there's no odd sound on ""Mutual Core"" as erialleh mentioned in his/her comment."
,guiltyspark119,2011-10-10T23:19Z,"anyone else try to make a cd / sync this to a phone and it won't do it due to ""unknown length""? oh well. looking elsewhere."
,vito_valpo,2011-10-12T16:35Z,It just took me 3 min to download....great album...Thanks everyone!!!
,muckymucks,2011-10-14T21:36Z,Thanks for the up. I can't believe this has been out since last month.
