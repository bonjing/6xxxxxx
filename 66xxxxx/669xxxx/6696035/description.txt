"What I always wanted to do was to reconnect musicology with nature," Icelandic composer and performer BjÃ¶rk recently told the New York Times. "I always wanted to make bass lines behave like gravity."
Biophilia is the Icelandic singer and composer's most ambitious undertaking in a 20-year career distinguished by continuous innovation and artistic evolution. The album title refers to a love of all living things, and in every aspect of this game-changing multi-media effort, BjÃ¶rk brilliantly connects nature, music, and technology.
