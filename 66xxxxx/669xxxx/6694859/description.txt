Gandhi was asked, \'Gandhi, what do you think of Western Civilization?\'

\'I think it would be a good idea,\' he replied.  

There is no indication that he was joking.

Unless all the world\'s leading universities and scientists are wrong, there are only months left.  If millions of us now in the west dont choose to be Civilized, the irreversible destruction of Spaceship Earths life support will prevent \'becoming civilized\' again being a global choice.

\'Gandhi offered us a way out of the madness.\'

It is now up to you.
