,michaelrwatson,2011-09-29T00:30Z,Hey Biz/tykoon123: What's the SOURCE for this? Don't want anyone to find out..? And PLEASE don't create MKV files. Use MP4 instead. Only fucktards do mkv. Thanx.
,Browse.Torrents,2011-09-29T19:12Z,Thanks...
,kellyofsiam,2011-09-30T05:13Z,"michaelrwatson....what is wrong with mkv?  Seriously, why the use of foul language?  Is it so important to your life?  I am serious...what is wrong with mkv?  lots of uploaders...using a variety of formats is good...some want high quality others want a format that takes little disc space & download time.  

Peace on you."

Not a damn thing wrong with MKV, FLV, RMVB, AVI, MP4, or WHATEVER!
MPC plays them all, and all can come in decent qualities!!

Thanks for uploading, and i'll be back later with an A & V score!! =)"
