,XxM24Ty,2011-09-21T22:53Z,"Sorry if I did not clarify enough that these are all songs from the ""American"" Box-set recorded in 1993 to 2003. Also the Flac version is here:

,XxM24Ty,2011-09-22T00:34Z,"We have had around 80 leechers but NOBODY wants to seed. Unless my stats from TPB are wrong, we have 100% ""hit and run"" leechers here. Somebody please seed AFTER you get the file, ok?"
,XxM24Ty,2011-09-27T06:11Z,"Nobody else would seed these mp3s, very much unlike the many Flac seeders. If you want this music click the flac link and get the free program to turn your songs into mp3s, acc, audio cd (perfect quality) or whatever you like. It's easy, very easy to do. I had to sto seeding this as nobody would seed for me, a problem I rarely have with flac uploads that our popular. I would delete this torrent but the site will not allow me too.
