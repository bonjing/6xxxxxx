,2toast,2011-09-23T14:44Z,"No folders, no rars, great. Why are there still . instead of spaces? Why is the IMMERSE tag still in the file name? If you're going to neuter torrrents, at least go all they way, not half arsed!"
[T],Ferrelas,2011-10-15T09:54Z,"If you don't like the torrent don't download it, or go something better yourself. I don't see the problem with this, I like my torrents like this, and other with me, so I'll keep going."
