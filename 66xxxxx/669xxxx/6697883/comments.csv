uninstall all your folder lock appliction from your computer
clean your registry with c cleaner or any other registry cleaner
restart your computer
1)disconnet your internet
2)check your firewall setting and set it in normal or agressive mode .
3) Now insatll folder lock 7(dont launch)
4)now Connect your intenet
5)launch  your folder lock
6)yourFirewall will ask your permission to block folder lock or allow,you should block it permanently.
7)Thats it,It will work
8)In Future if you switch or make any changes to your antivirus firewall ,you again get the expired notice,so make sure your firewall is blocking this application always!!!"

ok do the following..
do the following for last time with 7.0 version
1)UNINSTALL FOLDER LOCK COMPLETELY
2)RESTART YOUR COMPUTER
3)CLEAN YOUR PC OR REGISTRY WITH C CLEANER OR ANY OTHER TOOL (GO TO YOUR PROGRAMFILES AND DELETE ANY FOLDER LOCK FOLDER LEFT IN PROGRAM FILES)
4)DISABLE YOUR INTENET
5)INSTALL FOLDER LOCK AS PER INSTRUCTIONS(DONOT LAUNCH)
6)GO TO YOUR ANTIVIRIS FIREWALL THEN APPLICATION RULES OR SETTINGS,CHECK FOR FOLDER LOCK APPLICATION ,BLOCK THIS APPLCATION ON YOUR FIREWALL
7)NOW LAUNCH FOLDER LOCK,IT SHOULD WORK,IF NOT CHECK  FOR  PREVIOUS VERSIONS!!"

I tried that, But not work with this key!"
,BlackPearl73,2011-10-04T23:31Z,"darkshadow666,

This approach definitely works, I installed it in a virtualized 32-bit Windows 7 Ultimate OS as well as an actual 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate OS, and it worked in both cases.  The specific file that has to be blocked is WinFLTray.exe (if this isn't the file you're blocking, it's not going to work).  On a 32-bit system, it's located in C:\Windows\System32\ and on a 64-bit system it's located in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\.  "
,darkshadow666,2011-10-05T15:48Z,"it's working great in my other systems.Thank you BlackPearl73 :)
but i can't use this serial in this system(win 7)! because it's expired in this system!"
,BlackPearl73,2011-10-07T19:14Z,"OK darkshadow666 (and everyone else that is having the ""expired"" problem), I think I've found the solution.  Note, I take no personal credit, this was posted elsewhere.

If you have Folder Lock 7 installed and are getting the expired message:

1.  Install CCLeaner
2. Uninstall Folder Lock using CCleaner (Tools > Uninstall)
3. When you get the restart message after uninstalling CCleaner, DON'T restart.
4. Run the ""Registry"" section of Cleaner and remove everything that it finds.
5. Restart computer.
6. Disconnect you Internet.
7.  Go into Folder Options for Windows and make sure ""Show hidden files, folders, or drives"" is ENABLED.  Make sure ""Hide protected operating system files (recommended) is DISABLED.
8.  Do a search of the C: drive for a file named systemFL7.$dk.  Delete this file when you find it.
9. Reinstall Folder Lock 7 and block the WinFLTray.exe file.
10.  Reconnect Internet."
,BlackPearl73,2011-10-08T00:44Z,"Here are the instructions for a first time install of Folder Lock 7 and a reinstall to fix the expired stuff...

First time install:
1. Disconnect from the Internet.
2. Install Folder Lock, but don't let the program open upon installation completion.
3. Block application from Internet with firewall. Specifically, block the ""WinFLTray.exe"" file which is located in the C:\Windows\System32\ folder on a 32-bit Windows OS and in the C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ folder on a 64-bit OS. 
4. Open folder lock and enter the serial number and registration key.
5. Reconnect Internet. 

Reinstallation to fix ""expired"" message:
1. Install CCLeaner
2. Uninstall Folder Lock
3. When you get the restart message after uninstalling Folder Lock, DON'T restart.
4. Run the ""Registry"" section of Cleaner and remove everything that it finds.
5. Restart computer.
6. Disconnect your Internet.
7. Go into ""Folder Options"" for Windows and make sure ""Show hidden files, folders, or drives"" is ENABLED. Also, make sure ""Hide protected operating system files (recommended) is DISABLED.
8. Do a search of the C: drive for a file named ""systemFL7.$dk"", delete this file when you find it.
9. Reinstall Folder Lock 7 and block the ""WinFLTray.exe"" file.
10. Open folder lock and enter the serial number and registration key.
11. Reconnect Internet. "
