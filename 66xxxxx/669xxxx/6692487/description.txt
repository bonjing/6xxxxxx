After two albums and ten EPs, singles, etc., it is fair to ask if we really need another Wooden Shjips record. The short answer is yes. Bandleader/guitarist Ripley Johnson and his mates have used the D.I.Y. approach for everything Wooden Shjips has released - until now. On their Thrill Jockey debut, engineer Phil Manley was brought in, making this the first WS record to be cut in a proper studio. Mastering was farmed out to Sonic Boom and Heba Kadry. The end result is the most expansive album WS has issued, and despite the addition of outside mechanical personnel, it is still full of the fuzzed-out, murky, and distorted excesses that are the bands trademarks.
