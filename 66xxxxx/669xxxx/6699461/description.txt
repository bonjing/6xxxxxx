
	Here's another upload from ... well ... me. 
	Hi. Been away for a while, I hope to get you by times some things I like the way I think they should be ... etc.
	Anyway, here is the new version of Scott Adams' God's Debris and The Religion War; I made a combination of two books that should go together, and it is here for the other upload just is ... not up to it, so I took some effort to do it right.
	 
	Personally I think it is for the first part a load of bull, but I just got annoyed with the upload of the second part.
	Mistakes? Errors? Do it better yourselves, and reload.
	What you get is a .pdf and a .pdb, it's been read and most mistakes are out. Do not hesitate to improve.
 
	Enjoy.
