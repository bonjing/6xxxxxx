"Cool Neighbors"

When a "cool" new couple moves in across the 
street, Reagan (Christina Applegate) and Chris 
(Will Arnett) become obsessed with finding out 
every detail about them. Elsewhere, Ava (Maya 
Rudolph) struggles with the fact that baby Amy 
does not like her, especially when she takes a 
liking to Calvin (Nick Cannon).

18/Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
