  Twelve of the country's best amateur bakers take part in the second   
  series of The Great British Bake Off, hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Sue  
  Perkins. Over eight weeks their cake-baking, pastry, bread-making     
  and patisserie skills are tested to the limit as they are challenged  
  to bake everything from the perfect tarte au citron to towers of      
  macaroons, and iced fingers to family pies. All the challenges are    
  devised by legendary cookery writer and baker Mary Berry and          
  acclaimed master baker Paul Hollywood who are also on hand to judge   
  and taste their efforts.                                              
                                                                        
  This first show sees the twelve amateur bakers challenged to make 24  
  beautifully flavoured and decorated cupcakes in two hours and the     
  stress of highly pressurised surroundings of the Bake Off's open      
  plan kitchen soon shows. Next up, the technical challenge - to make   
  a coffee and walnut battenberg cake from one of Mary Berry's recipes  
  that delivers drastically different results.                          
                                                                        
  Finally, for a place in the next round of Bake Off they have to make  
  and bake a tiered showstopper cake. But whose cakes will have the     
  wow factor and who will be the first to leave The Great British Bake  
  Off?
