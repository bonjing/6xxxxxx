My first upload as "Footlong Fansubs".
I plan on providing anime, cartoons, and other tv shows plus movies all in xbox 360 compatible formats.

I basically took these episodes from another torrent and whichever files wouldn't play on the xbox, I repackaged them into .mp4 format so that they would.

All files are formatted as follows (As described by VLC Player):

~Episodes 1-11~

Video: MPEG-4 (xvid)
       640x360
       Framerate 23.976043
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 1/2/3 (mpga)
       Channels - Stereo
       Sample Rate - 48000 Hz
       Bitrate - 128 kb/s
-----------------------------------------
~Episodes 12 and 13~

Video: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)
       640x360
       Framerate 23.976023
Audio: MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)
       Channels - Stereo
       Sample rate: 44100 Hz
