"What I Did For Work"

When a big client shows signs of leaving Hale 
Dayton, Alex (Hank Azaria) is charged with 
taking him out for an evening of entertainment 
But when Alex realizes hes still a bit rusty 
with women, he calls in Dan (Mo Mandel) and 
Gregg (Al Madrigal) for assistance and things 
dont go exactly as planned. Meanwhile, Emma 
(Natasha Leggero) has set her sights on Andrew 
(John Brotherton, "Dexter"), who works 
upstairs in the building. With the help of 
Helen (Kathryn Hahn) and Walter (Joe Lo 
Truglio), she tries to turn on the charm.
