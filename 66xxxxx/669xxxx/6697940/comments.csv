It was available on other popular sites, so hopefully you were able to find it there.  For those of you that only use The Pirate Bay, again, sorry about the day.  I tried over and over again and it just now finally worked."

,sweetchuk,2011-09-25T05:17Z,Many thanks trialNerror - your efforts are very much appreciated with 720p presentations.
,ToneZone,2011-09-26T05:39Z,"Now... if we could only get you to upload Family Guy in HD.  ;)

Thanks for your ups regardless."
[T],trialNerror,2011-09-26T20:52Z,"Family Guy is available in 720p.  

Don't be detoured by the unusually small file size.  That's because scene cap rules have changed and are no longer required to hit that 550mb or 1.09gb mark, but instead they use CRF (Constant Rate Factor) x264's best single-pass encoding method.  The quality will still be there, but the overall file size for each episode will fluctuate.

I'm not scene, but should get with the program and use this method for 720p videos.  

XviD rules haven't changed so they will still be the commonly known 175mb or 350mb.  Those standards may change in the future, tho'."
