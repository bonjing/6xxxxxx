,chonghua,2011-09-22T12:19Z,"@solutioN-Ghost
the package is only an installer, once extracted it will accumulate around 2gb space.. (haven't tested yet..) hehe thanks"
,sinWalker,2011-09-22T12:45Z,"@sizons

openAL is a sound library. If the game uses openAL, you need to have openAL installed. Strange if the game doesn't provide it, though, but you can download it online, or copy it from some other game that uses openAL."
,zukke,2011-09-22T13:34Z,itÂ´s taking up approximately 600MB!
,svvede,2011-09-22T13:52Z,"Thanks .Dude. another fast upload. Same day as it was put on steam. =)

,mefisto82,2011-09-22T16:18Z,"Hey please, if you like the game, buy it. This is our first game on Steam, and we are indie developers. we need your support.

Thanks!"

,mefisto82,2011-09-22T20:46Z,"what you mean ""Comment Checker...""?"
,getter3,2011-09-23T00:03Z,"@mefisto82
if you really are a dev, then dont worry. If its good ppl here will buy it. After all, playing it with my friends on steam is more fun than alone or lan. If you aint a dev then fuck off. "
,solutioN-Ghost,2011-09-23T02:20Z,"i found the game not working on my Windows 7. It says : ""The thread xxxx crashed. [OK] Continue execution, CANCEL [debug]"" The xxxx is a number whereby it changes everytime I run it again. Same thing goes to Run by Administrator. help!"
,Tornadoxxx,2011-09-23T11:23Z,"Hey trolls , this game isnt workin after install. I installed it, run it and NOTHING !!! Waste of time ... and space"
,getter3,2011-09-24T01:47Z,@Tornadoxxx works just fine on both of my computers. Dont know what you are doing wrong. Try install but running as admin instead. Also when installed run the game as admin as well.

,chonghua,2011-09-25T02:16Z,"I'd tried the game on a Windows 7 laptop Intel core i5 ... doesn't work, just a black screen though.. Does this happens to anyone too?? Need a fix.. thanks"
,joester8,2011-09-25T18:13Z,"Every time I try and run it, it gives me an exception error "" the thread ""###"" crashed ""  and says [ok] continue exception   or   [cancel] debug    and neither of them work hence both crash.  Help plz."

,BakaBaka11,2011-10-02T08:15Z,"Why does kaspersky >always< suspects THETA releases of having Trojan.Win32.Chifrax.a? I know its false, but still...

And can you play with friends in this release?"
,godmo,2011-10-08T12:37Z,My kapersky told me that this torrent is a trojan i hope this isn't true and at first i didn't believe it but then i tried to open a file and it gave me an error message and everytime i opened something the same thing happened even the restart and shut down screen got fucked pls tell me if this game is a virus or not because i am not sure. P.s i had downloaded serious sam double d and another game from theta the same thing happened but every other theta torrent is perfect.
,lthoney,2012-04-26T04:58Z,"Does this allow for LAN/Multiplayer? I tried to play an online and offline game, as well as public and private, but can't seem to get a created game to show up over LAN."
