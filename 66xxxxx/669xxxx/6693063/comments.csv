[V],IndexTrance,2011-09-22T20:58Z,Look at recently .. If you record or use other scene releases you never get the whole show .. That's why i always will be one week behind since that's the only way to get the whole podcast stream directly .. Since it's the higlight of the week for me i think it's well worth the wait for proper release ...
