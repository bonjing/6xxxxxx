1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action, Adventure

Set against the backdrop of the Old World, two adventurers--both seasoned
warriors--will quest across a Western Europe ablaze with the turmoil of a
newly begun Fourth Crusade. Denz, a holy Templar, and Esteban, a roguish
mercenary, may have different origins, but their motivations are the same
amidst the danger and despair of a new Crusade, to find the means to deliver
themselves from a terrible curse that threatens to consume their immortal
souls.

@.dude
your work is great,dont stop!:)))"
,StefanGavrila,2011-09-24T20:07Z,"I downloaded the game earlier today at a pretty good speed and this is how my play through went:

- Watch intro for 2-3 minutes get bored as hell and skip
- Skip another 3 or 4 boring cutscenes
- Game actually starts now
- Fighting 3 guys, I try to hit 1 but the character reaction is so slow i get hit in the face 2 times by the same guy before I get a hit
- Decide this is enough and exit the game
- Uninstall the game, want my wasted time back.

I can't tell you how good the game actually is but the first 5 minutes made a very bad impression on me and I don't usually quit games I don't like, so fast."
,Morphesto,2011-09-24T20:23Z,I get the game to work fine but I cant clear the first stage! It's where you are being hunted by the death god and u have to press the arrows accordingly... The thing is it doesnt work:S! What am I doing wrong here?!
,tadpole76,2011-09-24T21:47Z,"At the arrow prompts, you have to wait for the outer circle to reach the inner white circle, then press the indicated direction. 

But you really shouldn't bother with this game - I don't think I have seen another game that is more awkwardly controlled, horrible-looking and just all around atrocious in the past decade. Oh, and it's not even a game, it's just a convoluted and boring interactive movie with occasional fights to break the monotony."
,BloodBroHS,2011-09-24T23:00Z,well i waited this game and i hope i wont be disappointed
,lifted12,2011-09-25T01:13Z,"Anyone having a problem with saving? The game says its saving but after I close the game and try to play again I cant continue, makes me start from the prologue.  Can't play this till its fixed."

,Bloodvenom14,2011-09-26T02:04Z,"One of the worst ""new"" games i have ever played, absolutely terrible console port. Do not waste your time. also even if you have an ATI card, update the physx bs from nvidia and it will work."

,stepsym,2011-09-26T19:36Z,"I've stuck with this game and I have to say the combat is totally crap, I cant believe they released a game with such bad mechanics, there is virtually no relationship between the controller and what is happening on screen, it feels like there is a 2 second delay. Its just horrible."
,rumpltumpskin,2011-09-26T21:20Z,"i was wondering why i couldn't find any reviews of this game until i played it. now i see that it is so bad that major gaming sights are probably just pretending it doesn't exist.

the only use i can see for this game is that it would convenient to get shit faced to since you don't have to use your hands much."

,Lerianis2,2011-09-27T22:23Z,"Okay, hoping that someone can help me with this: Downloaded the game, installed it and copied the crack to the directory I installed in (after backing up the unchanged files).

Unfortunately, it crashes immediately on launch with a message asking me to 'send the information about this crash to the developer'. Has anyone else had this issue and, if so, how did you fix this?"

,Lerianis2,2011-09-28T01:00Z,"Okay, I've got to say it: THIS CRACK IS NUKED!

On 64-bit Windows 7, it doesn't work. I have to alter the settings.cfg file (the one that I shouldn't have to touch) manually to 'not start in fullscreen' or the game crashes out instantly."
,rumpltumpskin,2011-09-28T01:09Z,"i care what people think about the game. especially since there are no other reviews to be found. not even ign, gamespot, or gamespy have anything. people here said not to waste your time and 9 out of 10 people agree. i would give it a 4/10 tops but i admit that i didn't give it much of a chance.

unless you have a huge amount of time on your hands, do yourself a favor and get the first templar instead."
,flame2410,2011-09-28T05:21Z,"I played this game for at least an hour and a half, and I have got to say, it is BORING as hell.  It barely had any music, the voice acting was terrible, and the combat sucked.  The trailers for this game made it look way better than this.  I give this a 2/5"
,sr2005,2011-09-28T06:21Z,The game is really a piece of shit.Moreover like Call Of Juarez the cartel it also cannot been able to save the checkpoints though it give an option of continue game but clicking on that the game starts from the beginning of the chapter.

,Amtech,2011-09-28T14:07Z,"For the noob/casual bitches saying this game is shit just because it actually obeys the laws of physics you should go play COD or some other shit.

The reason combat is so slow is because it takes time to swing a two handed sword.  This is not a button mashing game.  It's all about timing your swings and aiming at the weak part of the enemy.

I have not played this game yet but I will because I do like a bit of history.  

This game is 360 controller compatible.  Probably doesn't work with other controllers out of the box but there is that xbox360cemu thing."

I am usually one to never complain but, OMG!  Never through I would see a bad upload by extremezone, but it is not his fault.  But still appreciated for the upload.  I don't think I will try the ""Lossless Black Box"" because for one, Lossless would mean that the file size should be way bigger.  You should know extremzone, you upload a lot of movies.  Lossless means that the original data and quality be exactly the same as after encoding the video using a lossless setting.  The Black Box should be Lossy.  That is another term for encoding shit."

1. On 1080p the character textures seem to mess up and they are transparent.

2.Little to no tips or help on what to do.

3.Very buggy specially trying to get to the church.

The Cursed Crusade would be a fantastic game if they fixed graphical bugs and added tips to help the player.

and check run program as administrator.

,JuYeon,2011-10-24T06:30Z,best game for this month i guess? thank you extremezone !
,VenyOMG,2011-10-25T06:38Z,"Guys this game is actually ok, the story is nice, and in the beginning you just have to walk forward to church and press the arrow keys when the blue circle comes exactly to the grey circle not so hard...i enjoyed the game so far"
,armind87,2011-10-28T07:06Z,GAME WON'T RUN without NVIDIA PHYSX. Download & install it EVEN IF YOU HAVE ATI/AMD Graphics card.
,ShadoShane,2011-10-28T15:17Z,"Why is everything transparent and the textures won't load?!
Seriously is anyone else getting that?!"
,prince__vlad,2011-11-04T21:50Z,people who designed this game are really IDIOTS! The scene with death is IDIOT ! Why should I be force to fiddle arrows keys in the right monets wihtout anby clues  etc..SCREW this game ! It's a SHIT
,matt612346,2011-11-24T03:52Z,wow this game is so fail you cant even get past the 1st stupid mission where you have to get to some church or something. stupid pointless game is being deleted right now.
,MrSucubus,2011-12-09T04:45Z,"matt612346  don´t say that the game is fail and stupid, because YOU are unable to pass the first mission.  If you can´t pass the first mission... you are lame and stupid!

I don´t like the game, but i played 6 missions before deleting it. 

The game works perfectly, installs fine, no problem. The game itself is bad, AND FOR THAT I THANK THE UP-LOADER, FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO TRY THE GAME, BEFORE PAYING GOOD MONEY FOR BAD SOFTWARE.
Cheers."
,level359,2011-12-23T15:27Z,"What The Fuck !!!!

,haveaquestion,2012-01-16T03:54Z,"What kind of game is this, I can't seem to figure out how to play it???"

,petrysor,2012-03-14T19:18Z,"hi guys,can anyone please tell me how to resolve the problem with crashing game when it stars ?"
,WhiteSpotx,2012-03-19T10:24Z,Can some1 tell me if im the only one that has the PhysX problem?
,foniks1,2012-03-27T18:22Z,Too defeat Death you just have to hold W down and click on the button showed on the screens/ aka the Arrow keys.....
,Timbo6669,2012-04-08T07:37Z,"XD  so, this game is shit because you kids can't figure out how to play it?? wow.. Unbeleivable..Kinda want to play it more than ever..and extremezone releases games and vid/files for BOTH reloaded AND skidrow. so to say one is better than the other is like saying my grandma is better than my aunty??doesn't sound right does it?? wake up and learn ppl..use the internet for other things than porn!!!"
,ziuber18,2012-04-30T13:53Z,the game crashes on launch. Gives an invisible error and shuts itself. Waste of time and space.
,ziuber18,2012-04-30T16:46Z,"sorry, it works. I had to uninstall nvidia physx (the newest one) and install the one from the game folder. No further problems.
Btw. I can't believe you guys have problems escaping from Death in 1st mission and calling this game shit. I just finished 5th mission and I think it's great. True, the game is confusing sometimes but that's the fucking challenge. I'm tired of all theese games that treat you like a retard."
,Rikeus,2012-05-04T07:44Z,"So when I try and launch the game I get the error:

""Something went wrong with PhysX! Please head over to nvidia.com and check that your PhysX drivers are up to date""? Which is very strange, considering I don't have an nVidia card. Why would a game be made to only work on one brand of graphics card?"
,IWalkWithACain,2012-05-14T06:04Z,"For some reason everytime I try to start this game, it makes me open up my windows live mail.. and when I close those, it closes the game.."
,aljonzc,2012-05-19T18:02Z,"Working 100%. For those who problem with savegame, always run as admin. With problem in PhysX uninstall your graphics driver and reinstall or go to nvidia.com ( if your using nvidia graphics card ) and search for latest driver for your gcard."
,Cesz_,2012-06-06T04:04Z,"lol the game is really bugged, i dunno why i got the same error and i even dont have a nvidia video card and the game ask for psysx something like that. (my video card is made from Ati tec.)"
