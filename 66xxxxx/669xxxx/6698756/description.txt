Gold is used in a wide range of industrial and medical applications and accounts for over 10 percent of the annual demand for metal, worth billions of dollars annually. While much has been written about the mystique and trade of gold, very little has been written about the science and technology in which it is involved. Edited by two respected authorities from the World Gold Council, Gold: Science and Applications provides researchers with the definitive handbook on the current science and applications of this valuable and beautiful precious metal.

Packed with contributions from the worldâ€™s leading experts, this volume brings in authoritative information from a number of sciences, including chemistry, physics, nanotechnology and metallurgy. The book presents a myriad of applications, ranging from electronics to medicine and optics. A comprehensive overview chapter provides historical perspectives of the element and each chapter describes potential further uses, including applications currently being developed.
