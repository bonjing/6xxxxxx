    Math Workshop is a fun math game for kids. Answer math problems to make high scores, complete puzzles to unlock funny videos for kids, or complete other challenges simply for the fun of it. Difficulty is scaleable, and should provide a challenge to kids from pre-school to 6th grade.

    Or for us late-80's/90's kids it sure brings back some good nostalgia. :)

    As stated above, I could not get the game to work in the 64-bit version of Windows 7. Most likely the game will not work under any 64-bit operating system; however, you should be able to run it under any 32-bit Windows system, even if it is Windows 7 or Vista. I was able to successfully run the game under Windows XP.

    I will keep this on my seed list, so don't give up if you don't see any seeders; sooner or later I'll be around to send you some data. :)
