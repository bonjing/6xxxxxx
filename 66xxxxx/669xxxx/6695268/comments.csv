,MaliciousTentacles,2011-09-23T08:03Z,thanks eztv. the sound is definitely an improvement over ASAP's version of s05e02 - the sound seems in sync. the sound quality is a little lower than ASAP but I can fix that on my own. will seed.

,Sattori,2011-09-25T10:05Z,"Thanks! But they really don't get it that starting with all the relationship crap now the show is not so funny as in the beginning. And just wait until Howard is getting married. There are so many hilarious jokes about getting pregnant, yay! "
,anon73a,2011-09-30T23:13Z,"@Sattori - You are right on! They have turned it into ""Friends"" with a bunch of bad relationship ""comedy"". That's not what made the show good in the first place! I mean, seriously, how many geeks get this much sex?! It's stupid - it's been dumbed down to the lowest common denominator."
