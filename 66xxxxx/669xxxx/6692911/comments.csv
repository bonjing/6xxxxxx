What ever happened to the '80s Rare MOD, Punk & Power Pop Tunes' series that you started. That looked really promising. Please keep up the good work. T."

[V],80zforever,2011-09-23T00:25Z,"dragonbandit314, you're welcome. Part 2 of 80s Rare MOD, Punk & Power Pop Tunes has been ready for a while, however I did not see much interest in Vol 1 so I was not sure to post it or not. If I get to it this weekend to do some clean ups etc. it should be posted next week. Cheers"
,CanadaPal,2011-09-23T03:45Z,Hey 80z. Once again thx for your efforts. I haven't sent you a message in a long time but was wondering if you had the album Far From the Hurting Kind by Tracie (Paul Weller protege early Style Council Days) and anything else from Weller's Respond label. Thx again.
,JonYo,2011-09-25T22:44Z,Thanks 80z!

CanadaPal, I will upload that record for you in vol. 114. Cheers"
