This is the SyFy version not the feature film version everybody is expecting, as per my comment on TV Teams upload of same today.

At least UT's isn't putting the feature film version IMDB link like others are doing.

But can confirm, this is the SyFy version.

Not a bad SyFy flick imho, though some hated it completely, not feature film budget material but is enjoyable and worth the download if not already seen it."

id bet 5 bucks that you'd stop watching this film after 30 minutes. it looks okay, but, it just keeps not getting any better. there comes a point where u will literally want to shoot urself in teh head. ... but unlike any other syfy movie, it does take 30 mins instead of the syfy official 4 minutes"
