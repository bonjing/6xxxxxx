[V],Nepotu,2011-09-25T17:37Z,"Sorry, but my possibilities are very limited (space in HDD, upload bandwidth etc). So, I do what I could in this circumstances."
,Kole97,2011-09-25T17:55Z,"Such a mean uploader, no-doubt you must be wearing Barca boxers/briefs either (:"
,Ashleynin,2011-09-25T17:58Z,"@Kole97.haha ,that'd better be real (:"
,Kole97,2011-09-25T18:03Z,"@Ashleynin that's true, 
@Nepotu why do upload only one match each-day  (i.e. Barca) & save the excuse for us all xx"
,Ashleynin,2011-09-25T18:11Z,"Nepotu you used to be a great uploader, who used to upload some extreme quality within limited size, not anymore.Everytime i look-up your torrents now..either we have Nba stuff or some Bracalona."
[V],Nepotu,2011-09-25T18:23Z,"If you don't like Barca, look for other uploaders, sites, teams etc. And if I wear or not Barca boxers is not your f...g problem."
[V],Nepotu,2011-09-26T01:04Z,"@Ashleynin & others: I started to upload a few years ago only Barca games for the Barca's fans, like me. Then I uploaded 2011 NBA playoffs and finals. Then someone ask me (nicely) to up Moto GP races, Then I thinked that will be nice (with this NBA lockout) to up NBA finals with those great players. I did something wrong? No need to excuse for that. But someones thinks that they have right to ask (command) anything. I don't need them. Only I need people who know to thank and ask nicely. If you don't like it, you can go to someone or somewhere else! It's a free world... That simple.

PS: By the way. What do you like to find in my torrents?"
