An 8 part studio-based costume drama produced by the BBC and screened in 1983, The Cleopatras tells the story of the famous Cleopatra VII and her ancestors. Widely derided at the time, the show has never been realeased on video or DVD.

These are mp4 videos (H264/AVC) with AAC sound. The episodes are complete and include the end credits (the idiots who decided that squashing end credits was a good idea were not born in 1983).

The show features copious amounts of topless serving and dancing girls; those offended by the naked female bosom should avoid this series; the rest may care to observe a few ladies who became moderately famous, such as Carol Harrison and Shirin Taylor (as the Queen's handmaidens), Rita Wolf and Amanda Boxer.
