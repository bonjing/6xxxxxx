,OLDLIMEY4,2011-09-24T12:57Z,Manual please
,timrath,2011-09-24T18:49Z,"Sadly, it's just v7.0.1, same as the other 3 torrents. You can't patch it, because you won't be able to unpause."
,SRazvan,2011-12-27T18:30Z,"it works. still has the protection but you can remove it!!!
here's how:
1) install ANY clean copy of SR:Cold War
2) apply patch 7.1.1 - download it, just google ""Supreme Ruler: Cold War v7.1.1""
3) after installing patch start a new game. save it and exit the game. when you want to play again it will be paused and stuck. but here's how you work around it. start a NEW campaign (don't save, doesn't matter the country or settings). unpause the game, then go in to the menu and load your previous save. unpause it. it works for me. i plan to buy it at my next pay check. i really like the game and i suggest that if you really like it you buy it!"
