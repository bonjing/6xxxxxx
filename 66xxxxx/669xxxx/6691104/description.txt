One of the "Original Kings of Comedy" shows off another side of his talents in this concert film. Actor and standup comic Steve Harvey became a star through his often frank performing style, but what some fans might not know is that Harvey is also a committed Christian, and in 2005 Harvey was invited to perform at MegaFest, a four-day event presented by renowned evangelist Bishop T.D. Jakes at his church The Potters' House in Atlanta, GA. For the occasion, Harvey performed a family-friendly show for an audience of 10,000 in which he delivered a hilarious but thought-provoking routine touching on the subjects of family, marriage, faith, and his personal relationship with God. Steve Harvey: Don't Trip...He Ain't Through With Me Yet documents this special show and gives fans another perspective on Harvey's life and work.
