 [Notes]

 Consisting of live material recorded at venues ranging from the Berkeley
 Community Theatre and the San Diego Sports Arena to the Isle of Wight
 Festival, Hendrix In The West captures the guitarist exploring new
 directions in sound during 1969-70. Robert Christgau, the Dean of American
 Rock Critics, called Hendrix's versions of "Red House" and, "Johnny B.
 Goode" on this album "definitive." Out of print in the US since 1974 and for
 more than two decades internationally, Hendrix In The West, has remained one
 of the most requested albums by fans to return to the commercial
 marketplace.

 Hendrix In The West will be reissued as an expanded single disc featuring
 five additional, previously unavailable performances. The album's iconic
 cover features a classic Jim Marshall photograph of the guitarist and the
 twenty-four page book is filled with rare and previously unseen images
 captured by Marshall's distinctive lens.
