Thank you, thank you, thank you."

first of all, thank you for all of your great torrent.
For this torrent (oxford dictionary), I try to use my calibre to convert it into .epub format, because I'll do it for my friend, who is blind. He prefer to use it in .EPUB format, but my calibre can't convert it. If you have time, please upload this dictionary in other formats, such as epub.
Thank you"
