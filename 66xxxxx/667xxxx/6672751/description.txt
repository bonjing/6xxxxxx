Plot     
-----      
 Itâ€™s Samhain, Wiccaâ€™s greatest holy day, and spirits of the dead surface in Bon Temps,
giving Sookie some valuable allies to combat Marnieâ€™s newest incarnation. Lafayetteâ€™s
latest medium encounter imperils his relationship with Jesus; Jason finds confession good
for the soul, but not the body; Alcide makes a heartfelt appeal to the woman he loves;
Terry receives an unexpected visitor at Merlotteâ€™s; Sam and Luna envision a storybook ending,
for once; Nan wears out her welcome with Bill and Eric. As Season Four comes to a shattering
conclusion, Debbie confronts Sookie and Tara with deadly consequences, and the denizens of
Bon Temps.
