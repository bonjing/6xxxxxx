My phone is not rooted, I just installed this game normally without chainfire 3D or POWERVR plugin..the game starts up normally and everything goes fine exept the animation part..when I have to select a car or play the game the screen turns white.
Please help for this..I don't want to root my phone cos I've just bought it and it is in warranty period. :("
