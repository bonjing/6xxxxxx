,PhilLesh12,2011-09-13T16:56Z,"wow, it's about witches!

I wonder how the writers came up with such a unique and never-before heard-of concept like this?!?

Why do all the little 13 year old christian fundamentalist girls swoon over witches and vampires?  Isn't that heretical to their bible studies?"
,biblisaemi,2011-09-14T22:28Z,good quality. But I've got another question: Where did you get the fil to begin with? Acording to IMDB it airs only tommorrow.
,biblisaemi,2011-09-14T22:35Z,"@ PhilLesh12: lol! Good observation. Thou these writer rarely seem to have any Idea what they are writing about. If you look at Charmed for example. They say that they are Wiccan but still remain Christian. And that's just one example of many many more.

I liked the show though so far. Except for the usual klishees like everyone is joung and beutiful. I'm curious about what's to come."
