Gold MFSL edition of two early Beach Boys albums that were surprisingly well recorded. There is such presence on \\\\\\\"In My Room\\\\\\\" you actually feel you were in the room when it was recorded. While there are some early Brian Wilson classics, the majority of the music is surf-themed \\\\\\\"filler,\\\\\\\" enjoyable but mere ear candy. This has been a much sought-after MFSL disc and I have seen it going on eBay for up to $300.
