Everyone has been stuck on 57.4 for about a week now, hanging in there in the hope that you will finish seeding this thing (Also Ireland vs USA).

I'm not sure if you are a single individual or a group of people but if you are a group you need to bitch slap someone because they are letting you down. If you are an individual then please reseed the high res rugby games!!"
