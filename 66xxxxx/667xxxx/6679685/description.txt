The Codex
The Codex v1 â€œLightâ€
The point of The Codex is to be a base of knowledge from which one can learn and grow. This is the very first test run for what will become a much larger project. 
The Codex is based in part on the â€œCodes Gigasâ€ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Gigas ) as well as having many books and knowledge I believe all should have!
