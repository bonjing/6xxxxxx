,omegaaf,2012-05-24T01:23Z,"Hey DaQatz, download pfportcheck and check the port on both udp and tcp, if it can connect to your router and still gives you a closed port, somewhere, whether your router or windows firewall"
,lejlahad,2012-05-26T22:25Z,"DaQatz, you did amazing job on assembling this collection. Don't you want it to work? I am ready to spend as much time as necessary to download it, but for days I am stuck at 352 MB. Unfortunately I am not computer savvy enough to offer solution, but if you give me guidelines I am willing to help with research. Greetings.   "
