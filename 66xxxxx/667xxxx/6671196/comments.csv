[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-18T08:02Z,"@redwar986 - Yo do not need a product key with this.

@dani1qw - If you fallow the instructions the game should work fine."

,Jabeebaboo,2011-09-19T08:39Z,"33 kb/s, i'll have to let it download over night, i hope it works"
,Smacker262,2011-09-19T21:52Z,what do you mean by burn or mount the image?
,Jabeebaboo,2011-09-19T23:43Z,"It works but it lags like a motherfucker, anyway on how i can make it, yknow, playable?"
,asdf7326,2011-09-19T23:56Z,"ok I can't see anything The screen wont come up So I don't know whats wrong. The Game loads I can hear sounds, just The Game Screen will not work"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-20T11:19Z,"@Smacker262 I am going to guess you are what they call a noob at Torrented games, There is an image of the disc in the torrent which you either burn onto a disc or mount onto a virtual drive software like Daemon tools. 

@Jabeebaboo your computer must not be able to handle it or your settings are messed up. 

@asdf7326 Make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.

Note to all gamers make sure you research the game first to make sure it will work with your system. Always make sure everything is up to date as well. Also I would advise try not to run games on min spec's."
,nickroy187,2011-09-20T16:59Z,"It keeps asking me to support the game, buy it then closes when the game is almost finished installing...What do I do?"
,Smacker262,2011-09-20T21:21Z,@ServiusTheBear is its basically just like saving it to the desk top or a file?
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-21T07:22Z,"@Smacker262 Follow the instructions and then use the Crack update torrent and the game will and should work. I have steam installed but not on. Even tho I do not run it through steam. So I can not say if you need it installed to make it work or not. If its not working and you do not have steam installed then you might need it.

@nickroy187 I am not sure why it is doing that. Remember to follow all the instructions and also get the crack update from my crack update torrent and it should work. If not your doing something wrong or using something else with it."
,hobojoe24,2011-09-21T11:25Z,Hey servious do you reckon you can do a video tutorial on how to install this plz coz this is my first torrent game download and i dont get how to install it thnx :)

THIS DOWNLOAD IS FALSE!!!!

when you finish installing it, a message appears saying

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING 5gbs!!!

for me it was fast because i have a decent internet... so i didn't wasted my time :)

======================="
,godamnitdude,2011-09-22T01:57Z,"ok ok... i was wrong...

i actually made the game work... but theres some issues:


1 - WHEN I INSTALL THE CRACK UPDATE, the game starts asking for steam.

2 - WHEN I PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT THE CRACK UPDATE, THE GAME HAS NO SOUND, AND THE TEXT IS IN SOME WEIRD LETTERS THAT I CANT UNDERSTAND.

3 - WHAT THE FUCK

@Angryjoey Do not ask for invites to torrent sites on my torrents.

@fault3 we are still playing it here. Ok I see what you mean when its needing steam installed and running. Never noticed that till now since we play all our games through steam. We have not had any problems with steam so far and we have been playing this game since the 13th with no issues. Subsequently the others we have."

,bullonier,2011-09-25T16:34Z,"Hey... Seeding it, so I'm able to play without Steam? Because I don't want to get myself a block or something, I'm planning in buying the game after testing it for free xD

The crack in the download is already updated or I will need to download the updated one you sent in the 1st page?"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-25T20:52Z,"@bullonier 

Yeah you need steam running to play it. There has been no issues with use playing it at all. But if your concerned you can make a dumby account on steam and no you need to download that update crack that I have on page one since I forgot to put it in. That puts you to 1.2"
,bullonier,2011-09-26T01:37Z,"@ServiusTheBear ok man thanks for the upload, its working now with the update, its normal that I can't save the game? Like Evrytime I play I start from my current level without my past skills? hahaha

Anyways thanks again, hope to be able to get online with that Tunngle thing hahaha"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-26T11:06Z,@bullonier no its not normal that you cant save the game. Make sure you have all the files from the crack on the image in the root folder of the game. including the out file as that is where the saves go.
,devinmont,2011-09-27T11:29Z,"Downloaded and did everything that was said - When the game loads up the text looks something like- ajsdkfjaskldgjasl;dgjwioeiowjoigjodimvioasdngowefia

How does one go about fixing this lol ?"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-27T15:11Z,@devinmont Am Baffled at your problem. Maybe a graphics issue. Try upgrading your drivers.
,elementsx,2011-09-27T19:55Z,"Servius, it says some files are missing such as curllib.dll
Help pleease (i'm new to all this)"
,elementsx,2011-09-27T20:04Z,Curllib.dll file is missing? CAn help please?
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-27T21:14Z,"@elementsx no files are missing follow the instructions as stated and get th crack update which is here.

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6683288/Dead_Island_Crack_Update

And it will work. If not your doing something wrong or using something else with it. Note put the files into the root folder of the game. e.g. Dead Island folder not into the DI folder. Follow the instructions down to a T. And it will work."
,Rigormortis13,2011-09-28T22:52Z,"@ devinmont   I had the same problem, its because you copied the the crack update first, then the crack on disc. flip it around (the directions......to a T..........) and you should be good"
,yowatup123,2011-09-28T23:26Z,whenever i try to play the game it says steam is required to play dead island even though i have steam.
,Smacker262,2011-09-29T01:04Z,ok i finally got it to work but i have one prob. it wont save is it supposed to not save? if not can u tell me how to fix it?
,Rigormortis13,2011-09-29T02:52Z,"@devinmont You just copied the crack files in the opposite order.......just do it again but copy the crack folder on dis first, then crack update....i had the same problem and that worked for me.  but now i have a problem where the beach by the house you start at sounds like my speakers are fuzzing and blowing out, anyone else with this problem? i also am experienceing frequent, temporrary unplayable amounts of lag.  im a newbie to pc games so im going to check my sound card and what not, but ive never had a problem with a game before....crysis, crysis 2,  deus ex revolution, etc.... so i dont know"
,adalepimp,2011-09-29T05:41Z,"im getting this error when im installing the game that says something like ""if you play this game, BUY IT!"" plz help i want to play this!?"
,adalepimp,2011-09-29T05:41Z,and the installation quits after the msg?
,adalepimp,2011-09-29T06:57Z,ok so i found the fix. when that happens it means its done installing and you just copy all of the files in the crack folder on the disc and copy them to the root folder of dead island which is the main folder named dead island not the di folder. And it works! yes! haha
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-29T18:11Z,"@yowatup123 - yeah you need Steam running for it to work. Add it to your steam games as a non steam game.

@Smacker262 you have not copied the files right. Uninstall an reinsatll and follow the instruction as stated. After installation copy the crack from the disk first into the Dead Island folder all the files then copy the crack crack update from the crack update torrent. Remember if it asks to replace files say yes. Then have steam running and add it as a non steam game. Linking to the deadislandgame.exe"
,mikemctavish4444,2011-10-01T01:38Z,"Hey, so I got right up to the logo screen but then i get a message saying ""EXIT: Cannot find script dll  C:/Users/myname/AppData/Local/Temp/$PowerISO$/_x86_rwdi.exe""   any thoughts?"
,Alkaios11211,2011-10-01T02:12Z,"I have followed your instructions to the letter. I downloaded this torrent, mounted on daemon tools lite, installed as administrator from steambackup2, upon completion copied every file in the ""crack"" folder on the disc in this torrent into the Dead Island directory that was installed (C:/ProgramFilesx86/Steam/Dead Island), downloaded the crack update, copied every file from that into the same directory that i had copied the original crack to, and attempted to run the game using deadislandgame.exe.

Upon doing so, i get an error stating that i am missing d3dx9_43.zip. I found the file on the web, and put it into the directory. I get two more identical prompts for missing files, xapofx1_5.zip and x3daudio1_7.zip, downloading and adding each to the root directory. i can then launch the game, but I can hear no audio in the opening sequences or main menu. 

I reinstalled the game, and have not yet added the 3 missing files, in stead trying to launch it through steam.i added it as a non steam game, but when i launch it my status only switches to ""ingame"" for a second, then it goes back to normal, and the game never launches.

do not tell me that i just need to use your update, i have done so twice and it is missing three files."
,elonhdar,2011-10-01T03:58Z,"same as alkaios, but its d3dx9_43.dll
any help? 
And people screaming it's a scam, come on! such kids around!?"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-01T08:15Z,The files and crack update I have work together. Using anything else with it might make it not. work! Also you need steam running for it to play to. We have retested and it works. So I am not sure what is causing your problems.
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-01T13:20Z,I have stopped seeding this one. Want it seeded again just leave message and al turn it back on.

[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-15T23:10Z,"@rajw

Again another one who's ignorance I will indulge for now that is. The game is good. But next time I suggest you go look it up yourself and see if you like the looks of it. Also seed means to share back. So if you down load this game seed it back at least 1.00 ratio or 3.00 ratio those that can do more the better."
,Firygod,2011-10-18T15:04Z,keep getting an error saying engine_x86_rwdi.dll is missing no matter how many times I reinstall. anyone know a solution?
,nightslayer500,2011-10-18T18:11Z,the glitching is a bit annoying. I patched it with you patch and still some parts of the maps it goes pitch black and my flashlight no longer works. then when I walk to a certain part the whole place all of a sudden becomes lit up and my flashlight works :( is there another update I need?
,Tantravect,2011-10-19T03:45Z,I played this game with your update for a week straight with no problems at all and today my game crashed and when I tried to run it through Steam as usual it said it needed steam running to play :/. so i guess steam mustve done a new update thats screwed us over for the time being.
,Tantravect,2011-10-19T04:29Z,nevermind guys. i had to do the hard but right thing and download updates 3 and 4 off of here which of course removed my saved game :(

,kurt1900,2011-10-28T03:00Z,"Guys, after doing some research, here are some very useful hints if you use Windows 7:

1) Install just the wey ServiusTheBear describes. Do EXACTLY the way he describes.

2) Before starting the game, do what user ""xsaa"" brought to us: copy the WHOLE content of the C:/whateverdiryouveinstalled/Dead Island/DI/out to C:/whateverdiryouveinstalled/Dead Island/out. Now you can save the game.

3) There has been some reports of sound failure. It happened to me. With a little research on google, i found out that all you need to do is run the file C:/whateverdiryouveinstalled/Dead Island/Redist/DirectX/DXSETUP.exe. Boom, the sound is working."
,kurt1900,2011-10-28T03:02Z,"Important:

* Don't forget to run always as Administrator!
* Yes, you have to have Steam first of all! Just download it anywhere, it's free."
,IaMChrisx,2011-10-28T16:22Z,"When I open the torrent, the folder with the Crack Update Folder (winRAR archive) Before I can even extract it, it wont open because it is damaged or corrupt.

There will be some dll's missing (it happened to me). Just google it, download it and everything should be fine."
