,end77,2011-09-15T19:16Z,"A 0 (not only bad, but also out of sync)
V 7
M 0 it sucks ... sad movie, lots of scenes with characters staring at each other in silence, as if we're supposed to guess what the fcuk is going on in their heads. Don't download, not worth it, the only part interesting is where the girl opens her legs in the clinic."
,nathanielbeander,2011-09-16T15:56Z,not very good will wait 4 better 1
,nathanielbeander,2011-09-16T15:57Z,not very good will wait 4 better 1 when can u get contagion
,muvelvr,2011-09-17T20:19Z,"i have yet to watch the whole movie but wanted to comment on the quality after quickly skimming thru a couple minutes..  u know how sometimes u get a cam and u start watching it and think ""wtf? this is not watchable"".. well this isnt one of those..

my first impression was ""damn thats pretty good""
then when i factored in how i paid nothing and it took about an hour it was extra awesome.

far ass audio out of sync.. not too worried. that can be fixed in MPlayer OR VLC.

thanks BONE"
,tester4u,2011-09-19T17:10Z,"waste of time audio is terrible.

,billyboy999,2011-09-22T14:54Z," ..How hard is it to copy and upload someone else's piece of shit ,out of synch torrent onto  pirate bay ??? If I wanted a shitty green skull all I'd have to do is upload other peoples crap, day in, day out....I'm grateful to the original up-loaders .Not these green skull fuck-wits who are too lazy to even fix the un-synched video b4 uploading it."

- screen shots have been blocked"
,JChusky,2011-11-05T19:51Z,"a/v sync can be adjusted with vlc, but its variable.  at one point is was perfect at +6, other times at -1.5. its very annoying to keep the sync window up and watch the movie. video quality isn't bad, watchable"
