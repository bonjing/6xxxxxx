,nDALLAS,2011-09-14T02:55Z,good copy if ya ask me just bout dvd quality
,altonina,2011-09-16T13:34Z,"THANKS A LOT FOR D.L.!!! Awesome movie (Spielberg effects w J.J. Abrams story) 10/10!!!
A/9. V/9. Excellent for me! This was definitely one of the finest HD-DVD Rips I've seen (and I've seen close to 50). I completely forgot this WASN'T the real thing. I played it again to give an unbiased rating, and forgot - again, but did notice what I consider inconsequential imperfections. For example, blending of very dark hues (like the silhouettes of shrubs at night) might show sections that were slightly less-than-black. Also, some parts seemed to switch between HD and DVD quality. Overall the video was EXCELLENT to me, for a HD-DVD Rip. 
I only mentioned this because there are only 2 comments, one being critical. 
TO CRITICS: Before you dis an HD Rip, check that your monitor/screen is calibrated for optimal performance, read up on what doing it yourself would involve (I did), and try to do it yourself so your criticism, if you think it's necessary, is CONSTRUCTIVE!!! Most of these ppl put in a lot of effort, sometimes explaining exactly what they did on the download page, hoping others will help them improve.
I'm seeding and others are too so download this torrent, and thank the peeps who make this possible for the rest of us. Thanks for reading, and enjoy this torrent!"

,5amjr,2011-09-19T14:11Z,"altonina is obviously tykoon's other id, no ones that grateful for 700mb of data!"
,datagrab,2011-09-21T16:20Z,"LoL. It's definitely the same quality as the Screener I downloaded months ago. And yes this is cropped. And yes, altonina is tykoon123's other account."

,micky63,2011-09-24T06:47Z,"you're not an idiot to comment on your own ups, much in the same way that movie or game characters aren't retarded for referring to themselves in 3rd person...lmao!!"
[H],tykoon123,2011-09-25T16:58Z,I just told the reality...u believe or not..

,gazgaz,2011-10-01T09:10Z,these bastards that get on line just to piss off the downloaders should be shot (if only we could get our hands on them); thanks for your efforts
,chapter81,2011-10-02T17:28Z,"FOR GOD'S SAKE!!! STOP POSING IMAGES ON IMAGESHACK! ONLY US CITIZENS CAN SEE IT NOW!!! USE POSTIMG, LEETLEECH OR SOMETHING, PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEAAAASE!"
,bc1990,2011-10-03T17:31Z,"if you're going to complain, how about you just wait until the dvd comes out?"
,Elite49,2011-10-05T02:52Z,"are you guys fucking retarded to? The screens don't work because this isn't an HD RIP, its fake."
,5amjr,2011-10-05T05:12Z,"What a surprise "" altonina "" has not replied after his/her soliloquy about uploading and respect!
Respect is a two way street, if an uploader uploads a great file he should get thanks and the fuckin nobel prize for effort. 
But when they treat the DL'ers like idiots for instance saying a file's HD when its the same cropped screener doing the rounds the fanboys like gazgaz weep for the lack of thanx given! lmao"
,5amjr,2011-10-05T05:16Z,"@altontina i have just returned my sony bravia/BD player and PS3 back to sony as they must be broken due to the file not showing HD!
;P"
,RockJohnAxe,2011-10-07T23:49Z,"D/ling... To anyone trying to look at the screen shots, copy and past the link into the URL window and it works, clicking the link doesn't work.

I'll comment on the quality afterwards."
