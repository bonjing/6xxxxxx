Respected and very wealthy Atlanta, GA-area realtor Bobby Wilson has a wife, son and daughter, but does some things unknown to them. He has a cabin on a rural tract 200 miles to the north, to where he often flies his airplane carrying abducted, minimally-attached females, who he there releases as game and fatally hunts. A girlfriend of a victim convinces a cop to help close in on Bobby.
