Sha 1 hash - 6FE9352FB59F6D0789AF35D1001BD4E4E81E42AF

Can someone please confirm if this is working?"

,dwiss,2012-02-10T12:31Z,Can't be un-installed?  If installed on a Windows 7 machine do you get a dual-boot menu?  Or does it totally take over your computer?
,ElGuichy,2012-02-12T03:51Z,for the people who want to download it and want to go back to using watever OS installed previously download VMWare and do it on a Virtual Machine that way you do not have to dual boot or uninstall your windows OS...
