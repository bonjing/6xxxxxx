    Philipp Wermeer has been framed for the murder of a powerful figure      
    known as The Patriarch. Wermeer escapes, but the three Saxon             
    brothers, sons of The Patriarch, have arranged for a large bounty on     
    Wermeer's head. Clayton is a grizzled ex-sheriff stripped of his         
    office in Jefferson after refusing to acknowledge Wermeer's guilt.       
    During a series of fire-fights, Clayton contrives to help Wermeer        
    escape from attacks of bounty-hunters. Together, the two make their      
    way to Jefferson, where they can confront the three powerful Saxon       
    brothers, and reveal the surprising truth about who killed The           
    Patriarch.
