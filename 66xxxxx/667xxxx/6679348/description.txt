The Disney Afternoon 
In the 1990s Disney fiercely reclaimed its place as an animation contender, by putting out a series of creatively done animated shows. They starting on Saturday morning where they did well enough, but then they were rolled into a block of afternoon animated shows and the rest was history. The Disney afternoon kept growing and went through a few incarnations that spanned the entire 90s. All good things come to end and with new strict child advertisement restrictions, TDA eventually was moved off broadcast TV. Many of the shows continued in fractured syndication. To the happiness of many fans most of these shows found a 2nd (and 3rd and 4th) life on the brand new cable channel Toon Disney.
