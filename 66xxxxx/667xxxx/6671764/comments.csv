Also, I don't know if it's my ears or what, but I find that the audiovision track is much fuller.  I found myself listening to it instead of the regular audio track (mainly because of the desynchronization) and I found that the audiovision track was much louder, more dynamic, and fuller.  It might have just been my TV since I don't have a full home cinema system (just a HD TV).  But it really sounded louder, especially when changing from regular to audiovision, the change is quite noticeable.

Overall, not good enough for me to keep the movie."
