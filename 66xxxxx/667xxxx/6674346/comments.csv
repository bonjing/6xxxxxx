,kevmeyer84,2011-09-14T06:32Z,"quit your fuckin bitchin dude, it you have such a problem with it then go upload your own copy asshole, you bitch about .mkv files, now rar files...what is so hard about extracting rar, it takes like 30 fuckin seconds...you should be appreciative that someone even put the episode on here so go fuck yourself nero420187............Thanks sceneline"
,kevmeyer84,2011-09-14T06:34Z,"dont listen to the asshole nero, you wont be wasting your time downloading this file it is legit...all you need is winrar and you can easily extract .rar files and watch them in no time"
,Kakarot69,2011-09-14T07:16Z,fo sho if u gots a problem nigga then get ur happy ass some cable tv and just watch the damn show u pos u should be grateful that someone went through the trouble of uploading it for the rest of us broke mofo's who cant afford cable but love the show so SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND STFU 
,millennium5,2011-09-14T10:25Z,"Thank you very much for the up, but please don't rar the files, people with full HD will just delete them shortly after DL to make room for another file and thereby slow the down the swarm..."
,MustangFord,2011-09-14T20:37Z,"millennium5 has a point. I'm a broke mofo who can't afford another disc right now, and it's already close to full of stuff I want to keep. RAR-files, although I don't mind downloading them, they're certainly first against the wall every time I clean."
