,Whobuysgames,2011-09-13T11:47Z,"nope, Expansion"
,gorefest2010,2011-09-13T14:33Z,"Its standalone expansion, so you dont need the first game installed. But they are very similar - hence the expansion."
,huldu,2011-09-16T03:59Z,The game installer refuses to install the game with no given error. Is this really a standalone?
,darkdork3,2011-09-16T17:08Z,Any codes? Or Did I do something wrong? Its asking me for a code.
