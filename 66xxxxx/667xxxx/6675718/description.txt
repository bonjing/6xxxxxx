    The Joys of Jezebel is a biblical sex fantasy peppered with elaborate    
    sets, split screens, off-kilter camera angles, and psychedelic           
    sprinklings. "Intensively Incandescent in color!"                        
                                                                             
    CHRISTINE MURRAY (Trader Hornee) stars as Jezebel, the 19th century      
    Phoenician princess known for her wanton, wicked ways. The               
    turbo-bodied temptress has an axe to grind with Joshua (JOHNNY ROCCO)    
    who betrayed her and fed her body to the dogs. Banished to Hell,         
    Jezebel strikes a deal with Lucifer (CHRISTOPHER STONE), a hipster       
    doofus. The skirt-chasing horny devil is a real enemy of Family          
    Values and gets more ass than a mule salesman. But what he really        
    craves is a virgin.                                                      
                                                                             
    In order to leave Hell and get revenge on Joshua, Jez must find a        
    temporary soul to replace hers while she is gone, "To balance the        
    books." She picks Rachel (DIXIE DONOVAN), a blonde airhead with a        
    sugary voice and big-ass Flintstone feet. Rachel is being forced by      
    Joshua to marry the bloated, jelly-bellied Jeremiah (a dead ringer       
    for Rush Limbaugh). Jezebel promises to help her out and Rachel          
    agrees to the old switcheroo.                                            
                                                                             
    After trading bodies, Jezebel puts into action her smut-driven scheme    
    to destroy Joshua. Meanwhile, the squeaky-clean Rachel is chased all     
    over Hell by Lucifer who wants to pillage her box. During this,          
    viewers get a personal guided tour of Hades. Highlights include "The     
    Pit of Nymphs" (a sea of hormonally-tormented souls), and meeting        
    biblical characters like Goliath, Solomon, and the apple-eating          
    Eve...                                                                   
                                                                             
    Distributed by DAVID F. FRIEDMAN and directed by PETER PERRY (The        
    Secret Sex Lives of Romeo and Juliet) -- as "A. P. Stootsberry" --       
    with his usual carnal chaos of hot-to-twat couplings.
