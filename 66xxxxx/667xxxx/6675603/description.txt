BlueOnyx 5107R:
This is the most up to date and "stable" release of BlueOnyx. It is based on the RHEL6 clone Scientific Linux 6.1. However, a CentOS6 version of it will also be made available once CentOS6 has caught up on half a year of missing security patches. BlueOnyx 5107R will run fine on any RHEL6 clone, or RHEL6 itself.
