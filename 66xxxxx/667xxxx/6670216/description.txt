The Outer Solar System is part of a 7 book series that takes readers through a virtual time warp of our discovery.

Throughout this journey of the mind, Earth-bound explorers gain keen insight into the celestial phenomena that have fascinated humans for centuries. Thrilling narratives about indefatigable scientific contributors and technological advances will rouse the imagination.
