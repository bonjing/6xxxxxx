Today, the_marioga, a Spanish developer, has released a neat little app that allows gamers to
run Lua homebrew on their PlayStation 3 consoles. So a question you might be asking is what
exactly is LUA? Well, it's a lightweight, powerful, and embeddable scripting language.
It is currently the leading scripting language in games and has been used in commercial programs
ranging from Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom to World of Warcraft.
The clever aspect about the LUA scripting language is the fact that it does not need to be compiled.
This lua player allows users to display images, geometric shapes, display text,
and collect data from the SIXAXIS DualShock3 controller, among other things.
This version of Lua player does not include sound or file management functions,
but the developer promises these features in the next revision.
