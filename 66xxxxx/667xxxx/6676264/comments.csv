,TheIBigKahuna,2011-09-14T23:55Z,Can you play on a non cracked server like this?
,imsosik,2011-09-15T00:05Z,What is the server name? please respond
,neofusion,2011-09-15T00:52Z,"""What is the server name? please respond""

My Minecraft Server: teamextreme.no-ip.org till my minecraft server updates to 1.8 please use my other torrent in the comment above.

""Can you play on a non cracked server like this?""

No, this is for cracked/offline servers like mine, It's imposable to use a cracked Minecraft on a Premium server. The only difference is that non premium servers requires the server to run a plugin to manage passwords, so there is not much difference."

,neofusion,2011-09-15T21:05Z,My Server is now up using 1.8 not 1.8.1 as there are no stable bukkit builds yet.

,ChadIsRadXD,2011-09-16T01:16Z,"Dude your minecraft server keeps crashing wtf? im like in the middle of doing something and it just times out its not like the ""out of memory"" tho"
,neofusion,2011-09-18T00:09Z,"That's because for the 12 hours we were using an unstable build for 1.8.1 till a new one got released.

After that 12 hours pasted we switched to the new ""stable build"" and everything has been fine."
