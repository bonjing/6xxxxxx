One of two albums recorded in 1970 by John and Beverley Martyn during their edgy marriage, this one finds Martyn beginning to inflect his folk/blues style with elements of jazz. The couple lived near Woodstock, N.Y., during the period and became friends with several members of The Band. The couple backs each other on some songs but largely do solo vocal work on their own songs. The marriage soon unraveled and Beverley's hypnotic voice has been heard since only on one very obscure British release.
