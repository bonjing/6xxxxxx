,boom777,2011-09-13T21:30Z,"Something seems to be wrong for me. When I run this file in Media Player Classic, everything on my PC slows down. The memory usage for MPC grows exponentially. The running of the movie itself is then also affected - it lags, processes, stops etc.

The same thing happened when I tried playing it in Windows Media Player.

Anyone else having this problem? I never had such issues with HR's old handheld ups before.

And other movies play fine on my system."

,boom777,2011-09-13T22:29Z,"Okay, works fine with VLC, but still same problems with other 2 players. Hmmm..."
