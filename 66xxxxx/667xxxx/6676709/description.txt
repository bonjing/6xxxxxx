The.Big.C.S02E11.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 99MB]

[/b][/color] Laura Linney three-time Academy Award nominee, three-time Emmy winner, and SAG and Golden Globe Award winner is coming to series television in a provocative new SHOWTIME half-hour series about a woman diagnosed with cancer.
The series delves into the emotional ups and downs of a suburban wife and mother forced to face reality yet also find the light side in a dark situation.
A metaphor for the way we all should live, yet rarely do, this is a journey about how to seize the day.
