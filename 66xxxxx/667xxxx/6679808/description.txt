Description......: There are essentially five cons that are the basis for every swindle since man walked upright. For example, today's 
                   Nigerian email scam is nothing more than a derivation of a Spanish Conquistador's bait and switch con that started 
                   around the year 1400. Paul Wilson, dubbed the "World's Greatest Con Man," and his team take viewers inside long and 
                   complicated schemes and even the micro-cons that have plagued unsuspecting people for hundreds, even thousands of 
                   years. Paul has successfully pulled more scams on real people than anyone in history, but he doesn't take their 
                   money. His goal is to expose these cons, hustles and schemes so that he can teach others how to avoid them.
