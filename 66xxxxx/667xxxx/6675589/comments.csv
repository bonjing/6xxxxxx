Installation of OS is not as simple as that, If you want a multiboot system wherein you want to run Xp and Vista in one PC you have to install XP first in your drive C and after that you can install Vista in another partition let's say drive D.

,icetgamer,2011-11-22T19:33Z,"Maherz,

I have a Sandy Bridge based PC i.e. Core i7 2600K, mobo is Asus P8Z68 Deluxe, Hard drive is WD 1002FAEX Black Sata III and graphic card Nvidia EVGA GTX570. Is your Windows XP installable on my system? Please inform. Thanks in advance."
,Greylore,2011-11-25T18:09Z,"Ok, for all of these noobs who don't know how to burn Operating Systems....
1.  Aquire the .ISO file.
2.  Burn the file to a dvd or cd, whichever meets the space requirements (the size of the iso.  For this, like 600 mb, so cd).   Make sure you burn at 4x or lower.
3.  Enter the bios of the system you want to install on.  Make sure that cd is the top priority in boot order, and then continue to boot to hard drive.
4.  Put the disk inside the dvd/cd drive, and then reboot.  If you get a prompt to boot from cd/dvd, press enter.
5.  Follow the prompts."
,kpogwpro,2011-11-26T20:19Z,"@superslimblondje gewoon branden op cd....
verder wat je gewoon met een gekochte versie doet, computer opstarten en dan booten via cd/dvd drive waar je cd in zit, als je niet weet hoe je in het bootmenu komt, meestal op F12 drukken bij het opstarten, kan ook anders zijn maar het staat altijd aangegeven.... en natuurlijk setup uitvoeren zoals je zelf wilt voorderest niks hijs al gecracked dus je hoeft niks meer te doen"
,calpoly12,2011-11-29T06:36Z,"I did everything the uploader said to do...used Poweriso to burn the iso image onto a cdr...changed the boot priority in bios so that the cd/dvd drive boots first...and followed the prompts.  Once everything was done and windows was up and running, the only thing I had to install separately was the audio driver, which I got directly from HP.  I don't know what other people are doing, but if you pay attention to his instructions and follow them, you don't need a serial key.  Thanks for everything...it worked great:)"

Curious about using your XP pro images for recovery on multiple computers that have a valid key but no disc. Can I use your image for installing xp but use the ""oem sticker"" keys for activation? Thanks"
,dajuicy,2012-05-08T04:47Z,thank you very much!
