,elitecrusher,2011-09-17T20:33Z,Did anyone have the same problem that i did? After i burned this and it was stuck frame by frame during viewing. it was repeating the frames over and over like a bad cd would do skipping etc.  Am i the only one? Sucks there is only one copy on here of this movie
,Biglez,2011-09-18T09:45Z,"This is the worst shit i have seen in a long time...dont watch it, its a big mistake to spend time over this monument of pure shit!!! its a pain in the ass watching retarded fools with small birdbrains...you sit there and start thinking ""Plz, do the world one big favor and hurry up and die so you cant contaminate the rest of the world no more"""
,pinzmoo,2011-09-18T12:29Z,"I DL the good the bad and the ugly, I will be the judge of how bad and brain dead this is.

,ashen77,2011-09-18T19:20Z,"cheers for the up hero.

Biglez, couldnt agree with you more. A waste of time even thinking about watching it let alone actually watching this giant turd. a mass grave is needed for the cast, crew and writters of this shit.

elitecrusher, the pure shite'ness of the film prolly broke your burner. it did you a favour, trust"
,BamaNutt,2011-09-24T02:37Z,I agree to disagree with the original disagreement agreed upon during the agree/disagree stage of the afore mentioned disagreement that was agreed it was a real disagreement agreed to by half of the parties involved and disagreed on by 3/4 of the rest of the agreers leaving just 25% in a state of confusion about what was being agreed or disagreed on...Understand now mea74? LOL

,Manderz,2011-10-16T14:46Z,"It was a GREAT download, but the movie itself sucked. Very big let down at the end. It starts off great and you're thinking ""yeah this could be good"", but then it never gets any better. It never shows anyone die, it never shows anyone get their face bashed in... wth kinda horror film is this!?"
