Only trying to prove to myself that there was something wrong with the actual songs, I've played almost all of these songs on my 2 10"" Pioneers with a 1200W Sony amp, and trust me when I say some of these songs don't sound clear at all.

However, there are a LOT of songs here and anyone can easily take some of these odd quality songs as a preview and find the original version from its DJ.

Thank you for this torrent as I continue to explore more of what is techno."
