In a practice match between Scraggy and Axew, the match is interrupted by a gust of wind followed by the appearance of a Cottonee. Cilan realizes that it is the time of year that Cottonee pair up and that this male Cottonee must be looking for a mate. While they watch it find a female Cottonee that he has fallen in love with, they watch as she attacks him because he is too weak. Scraggy steps forward, wanting to help Cottonee to become stronger and braver, but Scraggy's Scary Face sends it cowering behind a tree stump. Ash then steps in, helping train Cottonee against Scraggy, as Team Rocket watches the Cottonee swarm from afar. Axew and Cottonee train next, with Axew teaching Cottonee accuracy for its Energy Ball, and then Dwebble goes up against Cottonee to test its Razor Leaf and Solar Beam. Ash then sends out Tranquill to search for the other Cottonee so Cottonee can get a mate as Team Rocket calls in for new supplies. As soon as Ash and the others reach the Cottonee swarm, a gust of wind blows up from Team Rocket's large fan, catching all the Cottonee in a bag. Satoshi sends out Tranquill to slice open the bag with Air Cutter, freeing the Cottonee and dispatching Team Rocket. Later, the Cottonee they have been training with finally defeats several other male Cottonee, impressing the same female Cottonee from before and getting a mate. The next day, as the perfect weather conditions are finally met, Ash, Iris, Cilan, Pikachu, Axew, and Scraggy watch all the paired Cottonee drift away on the wind to a new life together.
