First, thank you for this torrent.

Second, there have been as many as 411 leechers on this torrent...and this is the first comment.

Finally, I didn't want to be greedy, so I only DLd 3.19Gb of this huge torrent. I would like to seed, but I cannot seed what I do not have. At the present time...and throughout the night, speed has been UNDER 1.0Kb/s. I am, and have been, leaving my UL speed at unlimited. Instead of having a completed DL...I have only 2.22Gb out of 3.19Gb. I have ULd 2.12Gb...and I am not even close to getting my small portion of this DL. Now, let me get something straight...the uploader owes us precisely nothing, but when you list an upload, you should also, at least for a time, seed it at some reasonable level. You stated that you would have a rate of 92Kb/s by 9/15. Your German upload has over 20 seeders, yet we have nothing but someone who shows up very sporadically, seeds at about 0.9Kb/s and then quickly goes off line again.

This could be a great boon to so many people studying Nihongo. Please, seed what you upload. I don't think that is an unreasonable request.

Ganbatte! Domo arigatoo gozaimashita!"
,GalitShpichter,2011-09-19T16:56Z,"I know that download speed is agonizingly slow for some, but now I have 2 seeds on this torrent, overall upload speed is around 145 kB/s (It's my maximum, I'm not seeding anything else).
There's a group of about 20 peers who have downloaded 55% of the torrent, and I believe they will reach 100% on Thursday (72 hours more or less), now that I can upload 9 GB per day, and we'll have more seeders.
Internet was down at night, so the two computers
I'm seeding from where disconnected while I was sleeping...

Gomenasai..."
,joutenza,2011-09-19T18:29Z,"I actually have 71.8%, but I think that is because I am DLing such a small part of the pack. 

I hope people aren't doing a hit and run on this, as that would be most un-Japanese. :-)

You have some VERY rare books here...some that can't even be gotten on auction sites.

Anyway...Ai to heiwa!"
,joutenza,2011-09-22T02:56Z,Sugoi desu! Well worth the wait...superior quality and even the newest Nakama.
,DavidLJ,2011-10-09T15:39Z,"Well done.  

I'm just getting back to Japanese after 25 years away from it. (I built the first 400 coin laundries in Japan, but this doesn't mean I spoke Japanese well; it means I spoke Japanese effectively...)

Your collection is superb, and since one of my daughters married Japanese and is based in Tokyo as an investment banker, it's nice to have some kiddies' stuff to send to my Japanese-American grandchildren.

Thanks!

,compyhax,2011-12-23T23:50Z,"Thank you Thank You Thank you!
I had a Japanese learning course on my jailbroken iPhone, but since the release of iOS 5, I've not been able to work on the language. It's unfortunate, I can't download or upload till January 2011..... home in the boonies stuck on dial up for the holidays, but when I get back to college, I'll def be looking up this bookmarked torrent and download/seed.

Again, THANK YOU!"
,murasame84,2012-02-23T11:24Z,"first, thanks for a great torrent.
sadly you are missing the excellent 日本語総まとめ問題集 2級~ and 日本語中級j501.
i found the nihongosou matome mondaishuu somewhere else but i had no luck with the j501.
i own the book as paperback, but i often learn just using my notebook so a pdf or djvu would be very handy. any suggestions where to find it?"
,hanoh121,2012-04-29T22:43Z,Downloading at 200kb/s will seed full 30gb :P
