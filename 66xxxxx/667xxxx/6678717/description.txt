Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 â€“ December 6, 1988) was an American singer-songwriter,
well known for his distinctive, powerful voice, complex compositions, and dark emotional
ballads. Orbison grew up in Texas and began singing in a rockabilly-country & western band
in high school until he was signed by Sun Records in Memphis. His greatest success came
with Monument Records in the early to mid 1960s when 22 of his songs placed on the
Billboard Top Forty, including "Only the Lonely", "Crying", "In Dreams", and "Oh, Pretty
Woman" His career stagnated through the 1970s, but several covers of his songs and the
use of one in a film by David Lynch revived his career in the 1980s. In 1988, he joined the
supergroup Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne
and also released a new solo album. He died of a heart attack in December that year, at the
zenith of his resurgence. His life was marred by tragedy, including the death of his first wife
and two of his children in separate accidents.

Orbison was a natural baritone, but music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or
four-octave range.The combination of Orbison's powerful, impassioned voice and complex
musical arrangements led many critics to refer to his music as operatic, giving him the
sobriquet "the Caruso of Rock".Performers such as Elvis Presley and Bono both stated his
voice was the greatest and most distinctive they had ever heard.While most men in rock and
roll in the 1950s and 1960s portrayed a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs instead
conveyed a quiet, desperate vulnerability. He was known for performing while standing still
and solitary, wearing black clothes and dark sunglasses which lent an air of mystery to his
persona.

Orbison was initiated into the second class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 by
longtime admirer Bruce Springsteen. The same year he was inducted into the Nashville
Songwriters Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone placed Orbison at number 37 in their list of The
Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2002, Billboard magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the
Top 600 recording artists.Rolling Stone rated Orbison number 13 in their list of The 100
Greatest Singers of All Time in 2008.
