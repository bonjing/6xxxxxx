Your mom is so fat, when she went to Japan and Godzilla saw her, he screamed DAMN!!!! and ran away.

on-topic: have u tried tunngle or hamachi?"
,ChiliNoMoreX,2011-09-14T23:19Z,"@ tomtum1,
wait 2/3 days before everyone start playing it online."
,goingmad1,2011-09-14T23:28Z,@tomtum1 - yup you are right. I will buy this game after checking how it is with playing sp campaign. There is no demo so they can go and fuck themselves. If this game is any good ( and probably is) then I will buy it.

,crazelunatic,2011-09-15T02:23Z,after i complete axis training level the game crashes to desktop. Im on win 7 64bit/ nividia gtx480 10gigs of ram/2.7 cpu (overclocked). Dont know if the crack is bad or its some kinda of glitch and have to wait for an update.....???????
,jacko2015,2011-09-15T03:24Z,anyone notice all thos sites tracking the download when you use peerblock? is it safe?
,jacko2015,2011-09-15T03:24Z,"hmm why cant i post comments, strange, maybe it takes awhile"
,jacko2015,2011-09-15T03:25Z,"oops never mind just laged, anyways thanks for up"

,dumas1000,2011-09-15T03:46Z,"Trust me, Peerblock kicks the ass of IP trackers, big time. I don't know if Comcast spies on you directly, or if other people who are spying on you will go to Comcast and rat you out. Either way, Comcast will slam you with copyright infrigement warnings for downloading crap like this if you if they catch you doing it. However, if you beef up your Peerblock, they'll never catch you. Trust me. I speak from experience. I have 5 peerblock lists, blocking 2.8 billion IP addresses. That's 2 billion more IPs then peerblock's default list. The default this by itself might be good enough. I don't know. Tracking down these blocklists ain't easy to do though."
,dumas1000,2011-09-15T03:48Z,"Unfortunately, I have to wait for a repack. I can download files at up to 175 kb/s, but not extremezone files. I'd probably get like 20 kb/s on this file if I tried. Too many leechers. Totally destabilizes my speed."
,crazelunatic,2011-09-15T04:44Z,the crack skidrow has provided does not allow me to continue the game past the first axis basic training level......?????
,TyMod,2011-09-15T04:59Z,Comcast and AT&T will always watch what your doing.  Thats why they are sued ALL THE TIME!  They are dicks and don't follow privacy laws.  So get a real ISP like Time Warner Cable if you want to bootlegg.
,brutal_product,2011-09-15T05:35Z,"thx extremezone +1
to all of you that are worried about ISP's spying on your downloads, just enable/force encryption in/out in your torrent clients options. this will not keep you from a capped transfer rate, just makes it impossible for anyone to actually see what you're dl'ing."

,bulmastiffi,2011-09-15T13:06Z,"@ tomtum1
Battlefield 1942 was fun against bots, so was vietnam and battlefield 2, CoD WoW is great again bots.. So why this couldn't be fun. And why you care if some people play this offline?

@zgupsycho
Why don't you let people decide that themselves."
,goingmad1,2011-09-15T13:27Z,@zgupsycho  - this game is not some CoD shit. This is real PC game. Not to mention it is more simulation than run'n'gun shit like CoD. So stfu noob.

Im thinking a new crack has to come out or some1 with a good tut has to show how to get the game working passed the 1st axis training level.
,SovietTorrents,2011-09-16T01:54Z,"Guys, The game works great. Pretty realistic and fun. Took forever to download, but I am seeding at 1.8 Mb/s.

Follow the directions and it will work. If you experience a crash after German Training you should change the compatibility by going to main executable and right-click to properties.

But overall it is not that brilliant , worst  imo is se bad English speeking Germans that is so ridicilous - and not very realistic.

I would recommend the upcoming game ""Iron Front"" I think this is gonna be very good with much better graphics even though RO has improved too. But thx for the upload anyway!"

,Sivos,2011-09-20T21:27Z,"I had a crash problem once at the tutorial mission, all I did was run in Administrative after it crashed and that seemed to fix it.  I'm not fully sure if it did or not, but try it anyway if you have that problem.

As it was said, this really is a good game and anyone who says otherwise is a CoD lover.  This game is NOT like CoD, there is no single path that you follow that will lead you to the end, there is no friendly players that will never die, and if you get shot, there is a chance the first shot will kill you depending on where it hits.  From what I've seen, the makers were trying to get as close as they could to make this game realistic.  So, if you like Arma 2, you will probably enjoy this game.  It's not very opened world as Arma is, but it's pretty close.  And if you die the mission does not end, you just switch characters, however if your entire squad dies before reinforcements arrive then you lose.  I lost on the first mission (not the boot camp one) at the start because all of my men ran into a machine gun nest and I got one shotted when I got out of cover to shoot, lol.  That didn't happen again after I restarted the mission, so I think the NPC's have a mind of their own instead of like in CoD where they mostly follow the same path (give to take).

Don't play if you are new to First Person Shooters, go to CoD, it's more arcade than this.

Only annoying part I found is the part where your men will not stop crying that they are going to die, I know that's how it happened, but they could have dumbed it down to where they don't say it EVERY SINGLE SECOND, lol.  And the part where they cry for their mother when they are shot and about to die did make me a little sad, so I like that feature.

This game does require strategy, so keep that in mind.  And it is a little difficult to tell who is the enemy and who is the ally, again unlike in CoD there is no Red Mark to tell you who is who and friendly fire is a possibility.  So far what I did was look at the head, the Germans (you) have helmets and the Russians (enemy) have those hats that look like Mohawks.  At least that was the first mission, I just started the second and came to give a mini review.

I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge or something closer to a real life situation.  So have fun with it :D."
,hybridmoments82,2011-09-20T23:13Z,"Anyone running a Windows x64 OS is going to experience a crash after the tutorial round. Simply right-click the cracked .exe, select the Compatibility tab and have it run in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode and check the box to run it as Administrator.

Runs on my Win7x64 system perfectly after going through the above-mentioned steps. The game is great for those who are looking for a sincere dose of realism in their FPS's. I personally don't. The more mindless and linear it is, the better. Here, you have to be tactful with every move; every shot counts and every death is another loss on your side as you play a new member of the ""squad"" as each other member dies. Personally, I'm more of a Tom Clancy kinda guy.

Enjoy!"

Great upload and crack...but that is only natural with a release by SKIDROW. Installed under Windows 64x Ultimate, and I didn't have any issues.

As with the people who wrote before, this is not Modern Warfare CoD crap. It is the way WWII games should be. If you plan to Rambo the game, be prepared to die until the entire squad is gone.

I highly recommend this game for WWII gamers and gamers who enjoy complex shooters. Also, buy the game, playing with people is so much better.

Best part of the game is the tanks. They were designed inside and out...you have to experience it. More vehicles are on the way."
,MS000086,2011-09-23T00:30Z,"lipourr you have to copy everything in the SKIDROW folder. You can't half-ass stuff like this, or you might as well not be a pirate. My suggestion is you buy the game, it'll save your brain all that work.

There are three files.

-SKIDROW.ini
-steam_api.dll
-Steamclient.dll

For example my is under:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tripwire Interactive\Red Orchestra 2 Heroes of Stalingrad\Binaries\Win32

This is important because these files prevent connection to Steam and cracks the game. You place these files in before you start the game, and it won't connect to Steam at all. It should start right up."

,rauno595,2011-10-12T01:10Z,"Single player sucked really. Starting with utterly retarded AI ending with annoying bugs.

Bug worth note - While playing Soviet Campaign (Allies as they apparently call themselves), you will eventually spawn into some gliding corpse.

When it comes to balance it is a headache.

Then comes the lack of being able to choose a weapon or mods, which you can only choose in Multiplayer (By unlocking them through levels or someshit).

Overall, Multiplayer is the only worthy thing here.
Unless you love defending a position and your ""Team mates"" get themselves killed right in the beginning by a single shot.

It is not impossible to own the enemy solo, but when defending and 12 enemy troops zeroing in on your location, you might kill some but they will capture the location before you can stop or even find them in the huge square your supposed to defend.

Avoid playing a tank as Soviet Union, massively under powered. (oh and force respawn doesn't work in single player! It resets the timer but no AI units respawn and you got to wait another 2 minutes for backup! EPIC!!!)"

Here is the Windows 7 fix that worked for me.  

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6794951/Red_Orchestra_2_Heroes_of_Stalingrad_Fix_For_Windows_7_

The biggest problem with this game is the AI.  It is absolutely horrible.

You die so many times in a fully covered position (compared to any other FPS game...and I've played them all since Wolf 3d, all on max skill).  
I am a FPS veteran.

You die for no apparent reason so many times it totally ruins the game.   I could accept it if there were replays, but you just get recycled with a gun selection not of your choosing.

Aside from the insane bizarro world AI, this game is rather nice other than not being able to aim for shit without using the sights every time.

There are missions, but you never feel part of them, and your team walks in front of your action/aim all the time as soon as you spot things, so you can see shit, and end up getting killed.   Fucking brutal AI.

Has great potential, but again those issues totally ruin it.
