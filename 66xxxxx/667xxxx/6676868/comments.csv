To search for your TV code:
 1 Switch your television on (not on standby) and aim your TOTAL
 CONTROL at your TV.
 2 Press the TV key on your TOTAL CONTROL.
 3 Press and hold down SET UP until the red light blinks twice.
 (The red light will blink once and then twice)
 4 Press 9 9 1. The red light will blink twice .
 5 Now slowly, alternate between POWER and TV, over and over,
 until your television turns off. You may have to press these
 keys many times (up to 150!), so please be patient. Remember to keep pointing the TOTAL CONTROL at your television when you press these keys.
 6 As soon as your television turns off, press SET UP.
 The TOTAL CONTROL remote should now be ready to operate your device. Turn your device back on and try all the remoteâ€™s functions to ensure they are working properly. If some of the TOTAL CONTROLâ€™s commands are not operating correctly, try the search method again."
