caveat emptor -I do suggest you first listen to song samples of 
this CD before downloading as it is different from what is typical
for Irish song singing in spirited effervescence as it were. It is
perhaps more of a Scottish (Canadian?) typical suited voice yet I
dont certainly think it could upstage Andy Stewart in any event
(outside of Canadian space that is)whose voice with the great song
"A Scottish soldier: is included here courtesy of an itunes fullbitrate
download conversion to mp3.

So while Daniel O'Donell is not one of my ow favorites
some no doubt do cater to his music and I have it here for you
to the extent that this is so for you, or you wish to be better informed
of the full range of approaches one might take to the music
