So, could you please comment something about it. Thank you in advanced!!!!"

right click, force recheck

From what i've seen its usually caused by watching the file while its downloaded, or moving the file"
,caprikornius,2011-09-16T23:34Z,"thank you very much @putputgolf. But it's too late. After the error i tried to copy the file but windows crashed and i had to force a restart but once i got back in the sistem my bittorrent client was clean. All of my torrents registered were gone the ones that i was seeding and the ones i was not. even the ones that i was downloading disapeared then i looked for the torrent again and tried to redownload it but the same error showed up. this is the torrent:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4988598/Wimbledon_2009_-_Mens_Final_-_Day_13_(5th_July_2009) i was frustrated because itĂÂ´s been six months since i started the download and just when it seemed that i totally downloaded, that happened. 
Click on the link above and check whether it works or not. i'll apreciate it!!!!!!"
