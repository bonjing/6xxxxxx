This book is a physical chemistry textbook that presents the essentials of physical chemistry as a logical sequence from its most modest beginning to contemporary research topics. Many books currently on the market focus on the problem sets with a cursory treatment of the conceptual background and theoretical material, whereas this book is concerned only with the conceptual development of the subject.  Comprised of 19 chapters, the book will address ideal gas laws, real gases, the thermodynamics of simple systems, thermochemistry, entropy and the second law, the Gibbs free energy, equilibrium, statistical approaches to thermodynamics, the phase rule, chemical kinetics, liquids and solids, solution chemistry, conductivity, electrochemical cells, atomic theory, wave mechanics of simple systems, molecular orbital theory, experimental determination of molecular structure, and photochemistry and the theory of chemical kinetics.

From the Back Cover

An introduction to the fundamentals of physical chemistry for the working scientist

Physical chemistry is the key to understanding how the universe of atomic and molecular interactions impacts on such observable macroscopic phenomena as changes in temperature, pressure, heat, and volume, as well as solid, liquid, or gas phase systems. Fundamental to an understanding of materials science, the principles of physical chemistry are also essential to the work of the scientist in organic chemistry, mathematical biology, or population modeling.

Concise Physical Chemistry offers readers a clear introduction to the conceptual development of physical chemistry, in a well-paced discussion, of twenty-one chapters. It traces the modest beginnings of physical chemistry in gas laws and thermodynamics through its role in solution chemistry and such contemporary fields as electrochemical cells, computational kinetics, and photochemistry. Emphasizing theory over math, detailed coverage includes:

    *

      Ideal gas laws, real gases, the thermodynamics of simple systems, thermochemistry, entropy and the second law, Gibbs free energy, equilibrium, statistical approaches to thermodynamics, the phase rule, liquids and solids, solution chemistry, conductivity, and electrochemical cells
    *

      Atomic theory, wave mechanics of simple systems, molecular orbital theory, experimental determination of molecular structure, photochemistry, and the theory of chemical kinetics

A cogent introduction to the theory and basic concepts central to understanding physical chemistry, the book is a complete, one-volume resource for professionals and students alike. Offering computational physical chemical methods as well as worked examples and problems, and illustrating critical points throughout the text, Concise Physical Chemistry is an unmatched resource for mastering the subject in one's spare time or in one semester.
