,michaelrwatson,2011-09-13T03:56Z,"No subs..? IMDb says this is partly in German and Ukranian, and the Russian source video can't have English subs. If any crucial dialog isn't in English (which is likely the case in this genre), then this is junk. Thanks."
,michaelrwatson,2011-09-13T04:25Z,"Whoa, subs don't even matter. The SYNC is so bad that it's unwatchable--off by more than 3secs in most parts. I've never seen anything like this."
,billyboy999,2011-09-13T05:23Z,Fuck off Froggie .Why even upload this utter shit then write that you cant be arsed synching it???  Take your green skull and ram it M8!!!

,Marshmont,2011-09-13T22:23Z,"scenebalance took the time to actually sync the audio, i'd highly recommend that copy over this garbage "

,sqrewd2,2011-09-15T04:31Z,"michaelrwatson is correct, Without english subs this is unwatchable. That being said, Thanks Froggie =)"
