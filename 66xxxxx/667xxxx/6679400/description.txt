   Western pardners Jeff and Cash find a baby boy in an otherwise           
   deserted emigrants' camp, and clash over which is to be "father."        
   They are still bitterly feuding years later when they own adjacent       
   ranches. Bill, the foundling whom Cash has raised to young manhood,      
   wants to end the feud and extends an olive branch toward Jeff, who       
   now has a lovely daughter. But during a mining venture, the bitterness   
   escalates. Is Bill to be set against his own adoptive father?
