,calkhi,2011-09-13T01:13Z,"I un-rared to a folder on my desktop but that folder is empty. I'm not saying you implanted a virus on my computer but I am running a scan. So i try again, But it can't find the jar. I cant search it so I just need to know what its name is so i can use the 'Run' command on it."

truth is always bitter, maybe that's why u r reacting like that... ;)

@JoeKKer
I was just telling my point that i downloaded 3 same games from 2 different uploaders and then how one's not even a single game is not running and other's all games r running great?????"
,p2b,2011-09-13T11:24Z,"@nipunb - 99% of the times the problems is at the users site & if there is any problem with the ripping then the ripper would definitely provide with a fix. if it didnt work for you then you must have done something wrong or you are short of something, there are thousands of other users who got it working then think yourself about it & also why couldnt make your save game work in coj cartel??? you couldnt play re5 before then you got it working how???

& about being the best then the developers are the best coz if they didnt make the game none could have ripped it"
,sms.moosavi,2011-09-13T11:37Z,"KaOs Krew is one of the best but i think BlackBox is better.
BlackBox repack is 1.6 GB, nothing ripped, video and audio quality 100%"

,geo00444,2011-11-17T17:07Z,Can multiplayer work on this and it never saves whenever i play :(
,pyhunter101,2011-11-24T10:06Z,@kukuo9 If you have no exe file then you either havn't downloaded all of this torrent or you've downloaded a different torrent as the exe file should be the 2nd in the list.
,CJY,2012-02-01T03:06Z,"Okay so I have never had any problems with KaOs' torrents but I am having an issue with this one, it worked just fine installing it and what not but when I run it I hear the sound of the game running and what I think is the main menu but I can't tell if it really is it or not for I have no picture other than a black screen as if the resolution is not compatible with the screen, I play my games on my laptop but I use a TV for the main screen the TV uses a resolution of 1330 by 720 and when I tried to start with that it told me image not compatible with screen, I then tried to run it on just my laptop and thus discovered that there is no image when I run it just the sound of the main developer logos and the main menu screen, I ran that codec it told me I might need to play before the initial start up and thought maybe that was the problem, so I reinstalled it and didn't run the codec still had the same problem. Reinstalled it again and never tried to run it on the TV just the laptop screen but still not working. I am running Window's 7 home premium 64-Bit, any help on how to fix this would be great as I have been looking for a good torrent of this game for a very long time."
,alram2,2012-04-05T04:19Z,I have the same problem.. need help i run a windows 7 32bit computer i could hear the sound and what appears the game in main menu. but i have a black screen.
