Classical relaxing music from the greatest artists and orchestras, in FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec).






Strange noises and other unusual sounds heard aren't ripping erros coz there was none at all, and they belong to the original soundtrack. They might be the instruments natural sounds, the musicians breath, insects, toss, or whatever :D Enjoy!


Ripped with Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 2 to libFLAC 1.2.1.
Average bitrates varying from 295 to 670 kbps.






If you want to encode this marvelous collection to a lossy format, I strongly recommend VORBIS (OGG) at quality 5 to 7 (great quality), or at least mpeg4 AAC (M4A).

PLEASE AVOID MP3!
[if you like 320kbps CBR, then you'd better not touch the FLAC files... it's just not worth it]
