Resident Evil Code Veronica # 1-4

The Resident Evil: Code Veronica graphic novel claims to be the best videogame adaptation into a comic ever made. The whole Code Veronica game is written in comic book format. Issue # 1 consists on 140 pages, telling the parts of the story from Claire's capture and how she is sent to Rockfort Island, until she uses the Eagle Plate to get into the building behind the guillotine stand. The story overall is the same as the game, with a more muscular design for the Bandersnatchs, a Claire that shouts a lot and very little backtracking.
