,LaNPaRtY1987,2011-09-14T19:47Z,real?
,ArkAngel666,2011-09-14T19:59Z,"@LaNPaRtY1987 ... Seriously?

If a torrent comes from a Green, Blue or Pink skull, it's real. Especially when it has a scene group' name like SKIDROW."
,vishavs,2011-09-14T20:21Z,"Is this able to run multiplayer, LAN like settings?"
,xhitm3n,2011-09-14T21:35Z,"i Would like to kown to if this works in LAN?

there is not much seeders... i will seed for 1/2 days"
,wowwars,2011-09-14T22:40Z,this one is alot faster than that steam unlock which was going 20 k/bs this one goes to 1mb for me
,wowwars,2011-09-14T23:35Z,SSEEED! we have no real seeders currently wtf... QQ
,bannoura1,2011-09-15T07:28Z,"don't waste time on this, this is a multilayer game, and right now, it has some annoying bugs and some performance issues. Just wait a while it will be on sale on steam, and you can buy it, cause it's worth every penny, but you won't gain much from downloading right now, other than playing the training missions and the stupid campaign which is not fun at all"
,xhitm3n,2011-09-15T11:09Z,"bannoura1, this is the full game -.- dont listen to him this works perfectly if you have low performace, you need buy  a better machine i play in max settings and get 30FPS and higher "
,cptforge,2011-09-15T13:02Z,"bannoura1 is either a hater or is workin for Tripwire Interactive or steam!
if you got a lousy machine and cant play games to max setting! then buy a new one.
i bought games and also download from tpb.org from time to time, and i can play all of those high end games with my high end hardware always!!!!
i mean everything are in full setting that would make other laptop and pc cry."
,MorphzreaZ,2011-09-15T15:57Z,so its only multiplayer? an offline with bots? no singleplayer? ...
,Dutchlike,2011-09-15T19:25Z,Crashes on startup
,Xiles,2011-09-15T21:33Z,Thanks game works. had to run as admin on winxp sp3 to stop the crashing
,atosie,2011-09-15T23:08Z,"To fix startup crash download this crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6656242/Dead_Island.Crack_Update_-_RELOADED

and use its steam_api.dll"
,runindeer,2011-09-16T04:03Z,"@ atosie:

Thanx, your fix worked for me.

I had a problem where it installed fine but wouldnt start, so I downloaded the crack-only torrent for ""dead island"" then just used that  particular dll you mentioned and it works fine. At first I wondered why the link went to a crack for another game, but then realized one just needs that steam_api.dll from it.

I have vista, win32. "
,ronsibo,2011-09-16T13:31Z,i cannot change my screen resolution default is 720 x 526 there is no drop down list...any suggestions?or maybe this is just another hardware issue?
,bannoura1,2011-09-17T10:52Z,"my PC should run 2 of this game at the same time acourding to specs, i even went to canyourunit.com and gave me the fastest, so yes i should be able to run it. Even tripwire admitted that some high end PCs still suffer due to the UE3 engine , I love this game, but like everybody else, iam waiting for some fixes . Go to the forums, alot of people with high end PCs having performance issues and the game got more complained than any other game i have played."
,bannoura1,2011-09-17T10:54Z,"and the reason i want people to buy it is that single player does not do it justice, multilayer is what this game is about since it was a mod."
,Heatblade1212,2011-09-19T03:07Z,"guys, can you play multiplayer with this version of the game? (Skidrow)"
,groenlicht,2011-09-19T22:53Z,"I FEEL FUCKIN BAD BECAUSE I""M ILLEGALY DOWNLOADING THIS GAME. I have no other option tough because they ain't selling them yet in the stores in my country. GUYS SUPPORT THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE THE FUCKIN MONEY ALRIGHT??"
,mishayop,2011-09-20T02:07Z,"crashes immediately-i tried and tried for 7 hours-and nothing. that means-dead island steam.dll, all cracks founded on the web, run as admin on winxp sp3 ,sp2 etc. by the way- running win 7 with 3gb ram. sorry for my bad english. HELP PLEASEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!"
,FruityLoooop,2011-09-21T21:20Z,raring doesnt work
,saami_dude,2011-10-05T10:36Z,"@ atosie:

,vuorinorri,2011-10-29T14:32Z,"stuck in steam,can't get serial code anywhere,any1 wanna help? I would like to test if my PC runs this before I put any euros on it"
