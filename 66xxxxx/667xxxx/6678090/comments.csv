,melis123,2011-09-15T19:20Z,Can't Reach Server... i live in europe :P
,neofusion,2011-09-15T21:07Z,"""Can't Reach Server... i live in europe :P""

That's cause i was updating the server from 1.7.3 to 1.8 as there are no stable 1.8.1 builds yet.

Once a stable 1.8.1 build is released I'll update the server again :)
"
,neofusion,2011-09-15T23:37Z,Ok 1.8.1 can use my server just fine now :)

,znedja,2011-09-17T18:02Z,"Can't reach server does not matter what server it is

,bmanboy1,2011-09-17T20:03Z,i have much lag how can i fix that ?
,neofusion,2011-09-18T00:06Z,"Okay I get ""Failed tologin: Bad login"" since I don't have an account, how do I do? 

Seriously dude... look in the readme file or hell even in the torrent description, it not hard to miss the 7th line.

 ""when Joining my server you will be unable to move until you type /register (password here) then next time you join just type /login (password here) e.g. /register bunnies and /login bunnies simple and easy.""

As for the server lag there isn't any. This server most of the time has 65/65 plays and is lag free, the only time you cant connect to the server is when its full or its down for maintained."
,woodmandk,2011-09-18T18:01Z,"it writes
your name contain one or more illegal charecters"
,neofusion,2011-09-19T10:47Z,"""your name contain one or more illegal charecters""

You need to make a name out of letters from a-z or 1-9, as my server is in general English.

If you need any more MC help please use my forums in the description, or if you need help with the torrent please post it here :)"
,neofusion,2011-09-22T01:16Z,Don't post that spam on my torrent thanks!
,yoyoman234,2011-09-25T23:43Z,i tried to make a login but it wont allow me it claims that i made too many accounts
,neofusion,2011-09-26T09:33Z,"You can only make 2 accounts per IP, so that means someone in your family has made 2 already..."
,MartijnvandenH,2011-09-26T19:00Z,"Hey man, I'm playing at your server and I like it very much! Thanks for this torrent.

But thanks for this torrent it works perfect and the server is very nice!"

Ofcuase you can, don't ask stupid questions and try it for your self...

""dude how and where i do /register and /login ?

I'm sure it's my java and I uninstalled/reinstalled already. Should I be installing it somewhere else other than Program Files x86?"

,neofusion,2011-10-31T04:34Z,"Mod_Seth you truly are an idiot if you think texture packs that are transparent doesn't count as an xray, It also turns out you cant read.

""questions about the server, please post them on the forums and if you have a question about the torrent, please feel free to post them here.""  

Next time apply some common sens you idiot."
