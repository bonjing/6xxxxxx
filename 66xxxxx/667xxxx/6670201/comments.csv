,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-05-03T05:54Z,"""I don't want to miss the sand in my hair,
The roll of the tide and the salt in the air
Deep inside it's true
I'm a home lovin' man
Comin' on home to you
I don't want to miss the wind in my eyes,
The shimmerin' light when the seagull flies""

DAMN THAT'S CATCHY!
Anyone know where i can get this guys discography?"
