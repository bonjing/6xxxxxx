Cyber Update Sep.2011\US-15034 Isis Love Rain DeGrey Chloe Camilla Iona Grace Mahina Zaltana


Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. Totally non-scripted, all in front of a live audience, all broadcast live to members. Today's update is RD 2 of 4.

Team Red of Rain DeGrey and Chloe Camilla had the lead going into the round over Team Blue of Iona Grace and Mahina Zaltana. However after 11 minutes of brutal non-scripted wrestling Team Blue overcame the deficit and took a 50 point lead on clever tags and a heroic effort. Can they hold the lead till the end of the round? Will they take an advantage going into the final round? Anything can happen when you get four tough, determined girls and non-scripted action!
