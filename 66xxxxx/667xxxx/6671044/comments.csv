Seeing as your warranty is already voided, you should softmod your wii so you can play any game through different USB loaders and cIOS versions. Wiikey is far less than spectacular.. so use letterbomb and install USB Loader GX :)

My Wii is also softmodded, but I prefer to run games through discs, exactly because the compatibility is way better: games are almost guaranteed to run. There is no way a game works through softmod and doesn't through disc."

Not sure what to say to that. The game is working perfectly fine for me via USB Loader GX and cIOS 249 base 56. It seems with many other loaders it tends to freeze after every mission, so use USB Loader GX until another solution is found."

,str112571,2011-10-07T19:10Z,were cn i get the cios file thanks.
,vinnylima,2011-10-15T03:51Z,"This is confirmed working for me with USB Loader GX too. For some strange reason, it doesn't work through disc on my Wii. Since current Wii systems don't work with modchips anymore, my previous feedback was irrelevant. I have to say sorry about that, HobbitGamez, and thank you very much for your upload."
