,Tuneyloon,2011-09-15T23:37Z,These are the same files as my V2 torrent that didn't seem to work properly. The discrepancy in file numbers is due to removal of the David Sedaris books (still available in the first ul).
,chromepony,2011-09-16T00:21Z,"Any chance that instead of uploading the whole library each time, just post the new additions? Would be appreciated.  CP"
,Tuneyloon,2011-09-16T00:45Z,"Now all of my current files are in one place all my future updates will be just additions. The reason I kept the library complete this time was also because some of the poorer quality files have been replaced, like the Tripod stories by John Christopher (still not perfect but much better than before). Hope you've managed to find some good books among this collection!"
,chromepony,2011-09-16T01:11Z,"I did, thank you.  I'm just getting my Computer too full with all my uploads :-)  that's why I asked about just new ones.  "
,scotilla,2011-09-16T14:32Z,"Many thanks for your efforts and purely for your info. The last try for me stuck at 47.2% and was open from 8th Sept giving me a 1.7 ratio. No activity for 1d23h currently.  The new update has been stuck at 87.8% for 5h17m but is slowly uploading with a ratio of 0.62.  Will keep this open to await developments unless and until I hear otherwise.  Your first 428mb is still being downloaded fairly regularly.
Once again many thanks for your efforts.

,cur37ious,2011-09-20T05:25Z,"Great package, Tuneyloon.  Hoping you'll see this comment this long after you upped your torrent.  When you first up a torrent, limit your output to 10 or 20 leechers until most of them have become seeders.  This one went on for a day or two with over 200 leechers, myself included, all getting a little bit of your attention at a time.  Let the rest of us do the heavy lifting. 8^)"
,Tuneyloon,2011-09-20T06:40Z,"Thanks for the advice Cur37ious, I had no idea that I was able to limit the number of leechers. As I said earlier this should be the last major library ul and the future updates will be much smaller and hopefully dl a lot faster. Hope you have as much enjoyment out of the collection as I have and thanks again to all for comments and advice ;o)"
,cur37ious,2011-09-21T01:13Z,"I'm definitely looking forward to your updates, Tuneyloon (one of my favorite handles ever!!) 8^)"
,bm1639,2011-09-24T01:27Z,Awesome - Been looking for the Tripod stories by John Christopher for a very long time - cant wait to find some other gems among this great collection
,Tuneyloon,2011-10-28T03:33Z,"I found another couple of errors this week.
The first Artemis Fowl book by Eoin Colfer is in German and the Girl who kicked the Hornet's nest (book 3) by Steig Larsson has random repeating sentences pretty much all the way through. Will hopefully repair these asap and re up the offending articles."
