Cypherpunkd EP009: Agora.io - The Agorist Unconference - George Donnelly


George Donnelly creator/organizer of the http://Agora.io/ â€œUnconferenceâ€ joins us to discuss his Agora.io project. George tells us a little of his path from statism to where he is now. We discuss some of the presenters and topics, how it came about, how it went, plans for the next conference. Agorism on the ground in Latin America, the weakness of the state, the atomization of individuals in the US and cultural support systems in many â€œthird worldâ€ countries actually being very agoric, and along with many other topics along the way.
