,Electrish,2011-10-22T03:18Z,Awesome collection but I think your claims about the absence of particular genres is not quite true... not that it's a bad thing as they are fine tracks nonetheless :)
,manmachine1,2011-10-22T10:02Z,"Well,thanks for the first comment(and incisive remark)!It's been zero for over a month,after so many seeders/leechers.I put so much effort in this,and then nothing,no response.Hope you enjoy the collection as well as the others!"

This is a goldmine full of memories for us oldtimers that was around and danced to this music when it was fresh :)
A million more thanx for making us remember once more the long gone days :)
I feel young again ""starts dancing to the great tunes ""  ;)
Have a wonderfull life m8 :)"
,manmachine1,2011-11-26T00:03Z,"Thanks for your kind words.For me,back then,this was my everything,my whole life,all that I had in my fucked up country without future and hope.One can not praise enough those times and that music,that's for sure!!"
