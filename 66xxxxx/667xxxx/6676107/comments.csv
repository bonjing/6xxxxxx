,alphakry,2011-09-14T23:41Z,here is to hoping this version doesn't have the skipping that somehow exists in a different rls.
,koyfish,2011-09-15T00:24Z,"They all work perfectly for me, sound quality is 320kbps MP3 aswell."
,Wolfvalor,2011-09-15T02:21Z,Yeah.. Can't download if nobody seeds.
,zhopz,2011-09-15T02:34Z,needs more leechers

,koyfish,2011-09-15T22:29Z,"Oh right, I'm not really familiar with torrents yet."
,sn0wday360,2011-09-16T06:00Z,"Somethings wrong with Unison (Knife Party Remix), the BPM is wwwaaaayyyy off, showing up as 146.6 (should be 110) and yet lowering it to 110 makes it far too slow. Taking another copy of the song from another source and beat matching them causes it to be too slow once again. something is way off here."
,nicholkid,2011-09-16T08:02Z,"Just what I was looking for. I would buy it, but I need to save every last cent these days, going to school and all. Thanks a lot!"
