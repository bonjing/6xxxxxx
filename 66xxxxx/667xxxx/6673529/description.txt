[Notes]

2011 release, the seventh album from the New Jersey-based Alt-Rock band. The
third part of a trilogy that also includes 2006's Sound The Alarm and 2007's
Under The Boards, Daybreak sees singer/guitarist Chris Conley moving past
the anger and frustration that has defined the band's last two albums and
rediscovering a sense of wonder with the world that he can't wait to share
with his listeners. Whether you've followed his music since Saves The Day's
Hardcore '90s output or are a recent convert to the band, you'll still be
able to enjoy the album as a singular statement on what it means to let go.
