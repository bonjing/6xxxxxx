  The ever popular Stoke-on-Trent Stage, starting and finishing in the  
  city returns for a third successive year, while 2011 will be the      
  fourth year on the bounce in which The Tour of Britain visits The     
  Potteries, with the always dramatic uphill finish into the city       
  centre.                                                               
                                                                        
  From the beautiful start location of the Trentham Estate's Italian    
  Gardens, Stage Three is soon on roads that will be familiar to        
  riders from previous editions of The Tour of Britain.                 
                                                                        
  In 2010 these roads provoked the selection that would ultimately      
  decide who would, and who wouldn't win The Tour of Britain, so        
  riders will certainly be wary going into the stage.                   
                                                                        
  Enjoy this great stage of the Tour of Britain, more to come!
