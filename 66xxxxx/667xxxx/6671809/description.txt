Peter Martins, Ballet Master in Chief of the New York City Ballet, and four graceful dancers--two men, two women--offer a beautifully produced, challenging, 90-minute strength and flexibility workout. The moving warm-up readies your muscles and makes you feel like a dancer. Most of the workout focuses on the abdominals and lower body (thighs, calves, buttocks), with exercises that ballet dancers use to strengthen and lengthen their muscles and condition their core. At the end, you learn patterns for a ballet routine which becomes a short cardiovascular workout. New York City Ballet Workout, Vol. 2 builds on what was best about the popular New York City Ballet Workout--the graceful moves and gorgeous dancers--and includes the much-needed instruction and technique that was missing in the original. If you love watching or dancing ballet, New York City Ballet Workout, Vol. 2 is your workout. Highly recommended.
