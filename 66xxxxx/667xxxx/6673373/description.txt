On Modern Collective, Kai Neville brought on the six most brilliant performers surfing could muster, and the academy approved. For his new collaboration, Kai rallies a dozen more surfers Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥ including the original six Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥ for Lost Atlas, a project to defy all norms and expectations. A location based film shot in under 12 months will take the veiwer on a candid jaunt into surfing today.
