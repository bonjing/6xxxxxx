,BamaNutt,2011-09-24T02:15Z,"Audio is WAAAYYY outta sync..Video looks great but gave up because of the sync probs. I tried using the sync tool on VLC but everytime it got close, the audio would jump way ahead again or drop way behind again. Looks to be a good movie. Maybe  Mr  .BONE. could fix the issue and re-up..that would be fantastic...Keep On Seedin'!!!"
