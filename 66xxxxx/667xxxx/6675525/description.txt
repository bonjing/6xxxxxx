A native of Denver, Michael Hornbuckle has played on some of the most renowned stages in Colorado including Red Rocks, Coors Amphitheater, The Fillmore and the Pepsi Center. He played alongside ZZ Top for the Final Farewell Concert at McNichols Sports Arena and for the inaugural concert at the Pepsi Center opening for Freddy Jones. Michael got his start at age 13 when his father, blues legend, Bobby Hornbuckle, put him to work in his band playing drums with brother Brian on bass. Michael calls the next four years spent playing with his father the most important musical schooling that he could have received. After the loss of Bobby in 1996, Michael and Brian started a trio shortly after. Michael made a rather quick transformation from drums to guitar. Michael's soulful sound honors his father with every note.

Houston-born singer/songwriter/guitarist Vince Converse began his musical career while still a sophomore in high school. He and his band, Sunset Heights, played blues-inflected rock in venues that he was still too young to patronize, appeared on international TV, and toured with acts like Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Johnny Winter, Peter Green, and Fats Domino. After playing with the group for seven years, Converse struck out on his own, moved to South Dakota, and released a solo album, 1999's Nineteen Fifteen, named after the birth year of Muddy Waters.
