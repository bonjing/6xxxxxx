The Welding of Aluminium and its Alloys provides a basic understanding of the metallurgic principles underpinning how alloys achieve their strength and how welding can effect their properties. A practical guide for the shop-floor engineer, the book covers weldability of aluminium alloys, process description, advantages, limitations, proposed weld parameters, health and safety issues, preparation for welding, quality assurance and quality control issues, and problem solving.

The book covers parent metal storage and preparation prior to welding, describes the more frequently encountered processes, and presents recommendations on welding parameters that may be used as a starting point for the development of a viable welding procedure. Providing hints and tips that help you avoid some of the pitfalls of welding these sometimes problematic materials, the book's content is both descriptive and qualitative. The Welding of Aluminium and its Alloys is a concise and effective reference for engineers who may have little prior understanding of metallurgy and only a brief acquaintance with the welding processes involved.
