,twizted_rozes,2011-09-20T23:22Z,The keygen wants an installation code in order to give me the activation code. Any one know what it is?
,hellmarvel,2011-09-23T17:10Z,"@twizted_rozes,
When you install the programme using the serial given by the keygen, don't close the keygen or generate another serial.

When you start the programme for the first time, you'll get a window telling you to activate it now, or activate it later. Click on ""Other Activation Options"" (on the down left side). There, with all internet connection cut off (in fact you should have the Internet cut off at all time during installation), click on ""Phone Corel"".

You will get a window telling you the installation code to use with the serial you used to install the programme. With those two (installation code and serial) put in the keygen, you can generate the activation code. Use it in that window, and you're done.

Thanks uploader and crackers for this great piece of software."

Installation instructions.
1) Install the program in the normal way,choose options to suit your preferences. BEWARE : some AV software (e.g Kaspersky) claims that the installer is a 'PDM.Invader (loader)'. Tell it to ignore the problem.
2) Run the PaintShop Pro program for the first time.
3) You only get an activation prompt when you EXIT the program after running it for the first time.
4) When the activation panel appears, click on 'Already purchased' at bottom left.
5) Run the keygen, generate a serial number. BEWARE : Some AV software (e.g Kaspersky) claims that the keygen is a 'PDM.Invader (loader)'. Tell it to ignore the problem.
6) In the activation panel, enter the serial number into the relevant box. You can copy and paste the serial number if you wish.
7) In the activation panel, click 'Phone Corel', the program generates an installation code.
8) Enter the installation code into the keygen, ignoring the dashes displayed in the panel.
9) In the keygen, click on 'Activate' to generate the activation code.
10) In the panel, enter the activation code into the relevant box and then select 'Continue'. You can copy and paste the activation code if you wish.
11) You should be able to install updates quite safely. There are none available at the time of writing."
