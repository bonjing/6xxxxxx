Religion is not a major force in my life, but it helps many get through the days and nights, so I will never knock it and here we have Sir Cliff, veteran rocker of the early Elvis era singing the evocative Millenium Prayer, a classic if there ever was one, and loads of help with some bonus tracks I think you just may well enjoy.  

All tagged and good to go and the best darn quality you will see for free on the Net.   So peace on Earth and goodwill to all, let music be the food of love.
