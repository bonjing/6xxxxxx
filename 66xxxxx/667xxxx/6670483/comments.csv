Hmmm.. There's something strange about that..
From my Bible the Light of the world shines so bright nothing can hide from it. I experience that every day.. And it fills me more every day.

That's all I wanted to say, really.
salaam/shalom/peace from heaven be with you.."

I will choose to ignore them. Islam is the religion of anti-christ, and Muhammad the child rapist and  Bandit was the anti-christ. That  is why the Bible is banned in all Islamic Countries.

As far as Zakir Naik goes, he is doing what Muslims do best - lie for the sake of religion. It is called Al Takiyya in Islam and is used by scores of muslims to lie and marry hindu and  christian girls. Seach with the keywords ""Zakir Naik liar"" and you will get several sites which  list his lies. 

Islam and Islam alone will remain the worst religion of  all and this you can see this when you look around you at all the persecution, violence, rape and murder committed by Muslims, the Bloody Swines. "
[T],verifire,2011-10-02T14:16Z,"I just saw this movie, IndianChristian..

I SAW this movie. With my eyes and my heart..

""I promise I will pray for you every day, and I ask your forgiveness, like I will grant you the same. And I will be your friend always.""

Now THAT is a promise worth giving and keeping, no matter who or what the people we meet are. There's a distinction between hating the sin and hating the sinner, no?

Romans, 3:23) ""..for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God..""

I fail miserably, constantly, in the light that shines on my life. I feel I'm worthless, useless, tired and void of the glory of God.
But I stretch for what lies ahead of me, and I try to walk and talk like He does to the world through His words and the Holy Spirit.

Thank you for this upload.

For starters, compare the lifestyles of Mohammed with the people who wrote the Bible, and the lifestyle of Jesus. You will find it doesn't match up anywhere near. The Bible is about Truth, Jesus is the Truth, and the Truth sets you free. Mohammed was a liar, rapist, pedophile, sex crazy... his religion gets you bound to tradition and rituals.

Open your eyes."

after going through your comments i would just say that you  are one  hell of a great great and great bastards ... ooopss!! sorry !!!

i wish i could have uttered the same foul words as you did but ....
MOSES and JESUS were the noblemen and true messengers of Allah and we as muslims love,adore and respect them... i cant dare to say such words and above all PROPHET MOHAMMAD was the LAST prophet and messenger of ALLAH....

You have no perception of yourself, obviously. I feel none the dirtier after reading your words. 
Incredible..

Quote: ""anyways u shits cant understand all this .... ""

Thank you, GOD, if that is the case. If I'm a shit that ""can't understand"" your garbage mouth and thoughts, I count myself blessed by my Lord.

Only good about your ""comment"" is that it exposes you in a way that make clear how nice and loving you are yourself. Makes me wanna wash your mouth out with.. Naaw. Come to think of it; nothing and no one else than Jesus can rinse that mind..

Oh well. Just some thoughts.."
