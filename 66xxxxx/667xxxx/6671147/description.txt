THINKING CRITICALLY teaches the fundamental thinking, reasoning, reading, and writing abilities that students need to succeed in the classroom and beyond. The text begins with basic skills related to personal experience and then carefully progresses to the more sophisticated reasoning skills required for abstract, academic contexts. The 10th edition maintains the hallmarks that make THINKING CRITICALLY an effective tool for instructors and students. Each chapter provides an overview of an aspect of critical thinking, such as problem-solving, perception, and the nature of beliefs. Exercises, discussion topics, and writing assignments encourage active participation and prompt students to critically examine others' thinking, as well as their own.
