,nik09,2011-09-15T11:34Z,"Stuck at 68% .....
nothing has been happening in almost 24hours..."
,Vanvanero,2011-09-15T12:48Z,"Folks,

the folks at Speed.Cd aren't fooling around. This torrent isn't going anywhere, I even tried mixing the 68% downloaded from TPB with the ""missing"" 32% from my binaries provider and ended up having to download the entire game from them.

It was worth it though. Quality isn't free anymore."
,nik09,2011-09-17T12:58Z,"this was a fail! deleted the torrent, dowloaded phatwarez's torrent in 30 min. "
,mentallyours,2011-09-18T08:48Z,the quality is really good thats y the large file. awesum upload!
