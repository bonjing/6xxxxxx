Bit of a fiddle installing VMware tools into my existing VMs, but at least a dialogue box popped-up and told me that they couldn't be installed until I edited the .vmx file with the instructions they gave. After inserting the appropriate line, the Tools installed fine.

As always, my only complaint about VMware Workstation is the length of time it takes to install itself, but hey, I got it for free - thanks to you ;-) - so why should I care.

All the best, mate. "
[T],Maherz,2011-09-20T13:51Z,"@GarthRamsay
Yes, it takes time to install.
But as you said, it's free :)"
,skhan1995,2011-09-24T16:06Z,Good Quality Torrent. VMWare Workstation comes with great Improvement. Good Seed Count. Clean and Defrag your System drive with Ccleaner and Defraggler. Then Install Vmware so that the files remain optimised and the Programs opens and installs faster. Tested OK. Keep Seeding !
