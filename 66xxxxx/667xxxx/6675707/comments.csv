,thehellbringer,2011-10-11T01:23Z,"You didn't include the text file, it is just the iso file."
,thehellbringer,2011-10-11T01:27Z,"the install.txt file was not included in dl, it is just the iso file."
,goggurinn,2011-11-08T17:10Z,Does this contain the curvefitting toolbox?
,Little_Wolf,2011-12-04T23:42Z,"It does contain the curve-fitting toolbox.

Look at the files in the ISO (like you can on any cd). Then you will see there is a crack folder with an install.txt file. It's pretty clear."
,Knuppelknikker,2012-01-22T22:36Z,"First of all: Thanks for uploading it, awesome job! 

I downloaded this torrent file, and whenever I try to install it (click the 'setup.exe') it notifies me that I have to insert a certain 'disk' (after confirming installing MatLab) in slot #1. The irony is, that my laptop doesn't even HAVE a disk drive... Could anybody help me out here? I own a 'Packard Bell Dot S'.

Thanks in advance."
,Flobe,2012-01-23T04:48Z,"Thanks for the upload.

I downloaded this on one of my computers and it worked fine. I'm now trying to install it on a second computer, and I am having trouble running the ""lic_standalone.dat"" file. Windows says that it cannot open the file, then gives me the option to open it using different programs. What type of file is this? What can I use to open it?

Thanks"
