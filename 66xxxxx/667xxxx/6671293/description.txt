For Tomorrow is a 2004-2005 comic book story arc published in Superman 204-215 by DC Comics. Written by Brian Azzarello and penciled by Jim Lee, with inks by Scott Williams, the story begins a year after a million people (including Supermans wife, Lois Lane), mysteriously vanish from the face of the earth. As the Man of Steel tries to solve the puzzle while dealing with his personal loss as well as guilt over failing to prevent the disaster, a parallel story line concerns a priest questioning his faith and serving as Supermans confessor. This eventually gives way to a plot in which a megalomaniac bent on interplanetary conquest begins his attempt to capture his targets, and fighting through a heavy heart, Superman must stop him.
