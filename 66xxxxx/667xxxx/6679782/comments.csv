,system_m,2011-09-21T10:05Z,"The alien subtitles are hardcoded into video! Be aware of that, you can't turn them off."
,sv8.pro,2011-09-27T07:47Z,@system_m why would you want to turn them off anyway?? can you speak alien???
,Shadowtaco,2011-09-27T18:00Z,"@system_m: WHAT?! I am tired of these unamerican aliens being in all these different movies! I shouldn't have to read in a movie, and this film was made by an American, so they should speak American."
,system_m,2011-10-10T16:06Z,"Well, you are, dear sir, real american biggot, for thinking that everyone should and must speak english. I want to put subtitles for my own language, and they look rubbish over your hardcoded subtitles.
Is it so hard to load alien only subtitles with the movie? They will also play, but you will have a) clean video without anything unneeded (as your american director who made your american movie made it, he surely didn't put them subtitles there, now, did he?) b) respecting few billions of people whose native language isn't your american engrish."
