,Timmer86,2011-09-18T07:44Z,"Hey guys, after an hour of messing around with this torrent I figured out the thing with the language. To fix it, after installing open up the applications folder click on Adobe Photoshop CS5, then click Locales, click support files, then delete the .dat file (this is the file that changes the default language). After trashing the file empty the trash can, then restart Photoshop. It should now boot in the default english language. Hope this helps!"

Open Adobe Bridge.  Click Si, if you haven't already.  Go to Preferences.  Click Advanced (second up from the bottom) and click English for both.  I am sure you can do this for all the rest of the Adobe CS5 programs as well."

,gimmick66,2011-11-02T08:58Z,"IMPORTANT: This torrent has officially been DISCREDITED. It DOES NOT WORK and is just a silly joke by the cracker to make you waste some of your time.

You can try installing and uninstalling as much as you want, but your product will not activate no matter what you do.

The obvious fact that this is a joke is that the author did not include an english language option, and the instructions are intentionally left vague. They do not mention anything about creating an adobe id, nor picking the language, nor activating the product.

There are some obviously fake comments on this page like ""you don't have to make an adobe account.""

The only thing I did not try is giving a real email address / adobe id to the sign up form. If you're stupid enough to do that you deserve what's coming to you. Short of that, there is literally no way to use Photoshop with this torrent. Don't waste your time!"
,unclefestus,2011-11-04T04:59Z,"IMPORTANT: GIMMICK66 IS AN IDIOT. gimmick66, you are a buffoon. And I made an account just so I could say that. First off, you are not the ""official discredit or"" of anything, and acting as if you are makes you look like an ass. Secondly, it is by no means bogus to state you don't need to make an Adobe account. I'll say it loud and clear: YOU DON'T NEED TO SET UP AN ADOBE ACCOUNT. Simply press"" skip this step"" and move on. Third, you can take issue with the incomplete instructions and information accompanying this torrent, but the only issues with is is the language is not specified, and this is readily remedied as discussed elsewhere in the thread. This torrent works perfectly well. Just skip the adobe account screen, change the language to English as discussed above, and you are all good."
,shleencbrand,2011-11-05T22:46Z,Thankyou! Perfect! Much appreciated :) 
,gimmick66,2011-11-06T11:48Z,"Just to reiterate, there is no ""skip this step"" option. During the install process, the Adobe Application Manager opens. After putting in the serial it goes to the ""Adobe ID"" screen, and at the top it says ""Enter your Adobe ID"" with the option to ""Create an Adobe ID"". There is no ""skip this step"" link nor button. The top says ""To use Adobe Photoshop CS5 Subscription Edition, and to access CS Live online services, you must provide an Adobe ID."" If you click ""Next"" it pops up a yellow triangle that says ""Please enter your adobe ID"". There is no way to skip the screen. If you create a fake one and then finish the install, it will say ""unable to start your subscription"" like many other people have posted in this thread. There is no solution to the problem. Again, this torrent does not work. There is no way around the activation screen, and the complete disregard for mentioning this in the instructions is a good indicator that this is a joke torrent."
,cromwelld,2011-11-06T18:13Z,"@gimmick66,

I'm sure this torrent works fine for some people, but I have had every single problem possible, and I'm looking for a little help with the last few things I haven't seen anyone solving for yet. Namely, after finally getting it to install, it refuses to open, claiming that the program is partially missing or broken. What the heck? Can someone help me out here, please? I've been struggling for weeks to find a way to crack this program, with no luck anywhere. The closest I've gotten, I got a trial downloaded, entered a generated key that claimed to be working, and it rejected it in the final step, claiming there was an error in registration. Which is not the point right now. The point is, I need Photoshop to do my schoolwork, and I'm at my wit's end. What do I do to fix this? How do I get the damn program open when it's all greyed and exed out? I see there are a few other people having this problem, and it would be nice to see some solutions, assuming there are any.

If for some reason it doesn't work for you then you have either done something wrong or your machine is doing something thats preventing it from working.

,usaalexbug,2011-12-29T05:09Z,"OKAY! This torrent finally worked for me after going through many photoshop torrents.

The people who are having the ""enter adobe id and register"" HERE IS THE FIX:::

Delete every trace of photoshop cs5 you have or any previous photoshops.

Then run this software:
http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cscleanertool.html

it cleans up any leftover traces. then run the torrent as usual, run the keygen, then install the software then as your entering the serial number, run the blocker. then when it asks for the adobe thing, IF YOUVE DELETED ALL THE OTHER TRACES, nomatter what language you are in, the bottom left hand corner that button translates too ""skip this step"". 

Then your all set! :) 

Worked for me on Lion OSX 10.7.2 serial worked and everything. Even in English.

Thanks & Seeding!"
,usaalexbug,2011-12-29T05:11Z,"The reason it works for some people is because they don't have any traces of photoshop on their system. They run it as a clean installation and so adobe lets them skip the adobe ID & registration part. If the Adobe manager senses other products or an older version it will force you to register or log in. 

Getting rid of all traces of photoshop fixes this and allows you to install the torrent.

Hope this helps!"
,atos13,2011-12-30T17:56Z,"As ""usaalexbug"" wrote before
if you can't install PS because of ""enter adobe id and register"" and you have NO skip option on left corner
THERE IS still some traces of photoshop in your system. I had the same problem even after running ""Adobe cleaner tool"".
The last thing I did is cleaned my system manually. I deleted all apps support and preferences files.
Go to :
~/Library/Application Support/(Adobe)

Preferences are stored at
~/Library/Preferences

After cleaning everything with Abobe in file name and restarting my system I was finally able to get SKIP option on the left bottom corner.

Hope this will help.

,flash413,2012-01-07T18:46Z,"I can't get past the registration screen.  It keeps telling me I need an adobe ID.  How do I get past it?

I've removed all previous photoshop files, I made sure I was logged out of the Adobe website, I ran the cscleanertool, I restarted the machine.  Then ran the key generator, ran the install, and it gets stuck there every time, and there's no ""skip"" option.  Deleted everything, ran cscleaner tool again, restarted the computer again, redownloaded torrent again and still same results.  Help?"

Hello all, like many I was having issues with the adobe account confirmation. After what seemed to be endless hours of trial and error with this torrent, I stumbled upon ""usaalexbug"" and ""atos13"" in regards to their comments. I found following atos13's cleanup procedure and usaalexbug's install method WORKS. 

MAJOR NOTE: On my suceeding attempt to bypass the Adobe account; I never installed it as a trial first. I first ran the ""Blocker"" at the serial code screen and then entered the serial number.

I hope I can help a few of you out, and possibly save you hours of trial and error.  -_- 
Special thank-you to usabugalex and atos13 for the solution. 10.2.7 Does work.."
,CwSPiNZ,2012-01-09T14:35Z,"Sorry for the second post; but I would also like to add, If you can't get CS5 to english after looking at Timmer88's comment on page 1, maybe it's time to sell the ol' computer.. :P"
,kbechard,2012-01-11T05:30Z,"I registered to add this comment.  Thank you so much usaalexbug!!  With your help, I was able to get photoshop.  You are amazing and I am forever grateful.

I couldn't figure out the account conformation page and must have installed, uninstalled and reinstalled about 20 times before I found usaalexbug's information.  I followed it and worked like a gem!  Thanks again!"

,schniderI,2012-02-05T16:49Z,"Works perfectly! Follow the instructions in the .txt file but with one addition

TURN OFF YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION!

you should always tur it off when playing around with cracked application.

IF you have installed it wrongly and it didn't work. you need to completely erase it by following the steps here. It is not enough to just unisnatall!

,nunda,2012-02-08T16:35Z,"How to Install - Infos from webchella, Timmer86, usaalexbug, atos13, ellisr1 and CwSPiNZ

1 - If you have a previous installation of Photoshop, START deleting every trace of it running Adobe's cleaner tool at "" http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cscleanertool.html"";
2 - In addiction, you can clean your system manually deleting all apps support and preferences files at ""~/Library/Application Support/(Adobe)"" and  ""~/Library/Preferences"";
3 - With a clean system, run ""KeyMaker""  to get your serial #;
4 - Run ""Photoshop_12_LS4.dmg"" to start installation;
5 -Before you insert the serial #, run ""Block Adobe Activation.app"". There is no need to install the Trial Version. And you won't be able to install an English version, but you can change language after installation.
6 - if you get a message asking you to ""close ShellExtLoader application"", try quitting SugarSync.
7 - Skip request to create Adobe account and, that's it!
8 - After installation, go to	 ""~/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS5/Locales"" and delete the "".dat"" file. Empty the trash, restart Photoshop and it should be in English.

Piece of cake!"

,wryme,2012-02-16T08:28Z,"I'm at the part where I enter the serial and choose a language, but strangely English is not listed. Hopefully I can change it afterwards."
,wryme,2012-02-16T08:51Z,"I went back through the comments and found how to change the language back to English. I'll just copy and paste what the other person said here for convenience:

""Hey guys, after an hour of messing around with this torrent I figured out the thing with the language. To fix it, after installing open up the applications folder click on Adobe Photoshop CS5, then click Locales, click support files, then delete the .dat file (this is the file that changes the default language). After trashing the file empty the trash can, then restart Photoshop. It should now boot in the default english language. Hope this helps!"""
,remois1,2012-02-16T17:28Z,"@ Nunca


I follow your instructions but it's kind of weird that we have to run ""block adobe activation "" before entering serials...
So now i have this message ""We are unable to start your subscription for abobe photoshop CS5.1 subscription Edition"" after logging my adobe ID (i don't have the button to ""skip"" it...)

After reflexion, that's make sense, I should never run ""adobe blocker""...

@talia13  Open Adobe Bridge. Click Si, if you haven't already. Go to Preferences. Click Advanced (second up from the bottom) and click English for both. I am sure you can do this for all the rest of the Adobe CS5 programs as well."

So I did what @usaalexbug suggested and I'm using CS5 right now :) To Prevent from getting the Subscription page"" all you have to do is 
---->>>>>
The people who are having the ""enter adobe id and register"" HERE IS THE FIX:::

Delete every trace of photoshop cs5 you have or any previous photoshops.

Then run this software:
http://www.adobe.com/support/contact/cscleanertool.html

it cleans up any leftover traces. then 
1) run the torrent as usual 
2) run the keygen
3) then install the software then as your entering the serial number 
4)run the blocker 
5)when it asks for the adobe thing, IF YOUVE DELETED ALL THE OTHER TRACES, nomatter what language you are in, the bottom left hand corner that button translates too ""skip this step"". 

and this is a REAL PERSON lol I made an account just to write this comment :D well good luck to all of you ! "
