i have an old version."
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-18T01:04Z,"@Bramsko - yes.

@Sirsmimran - nope. it'll ask you to update your dashboard, which will go on to take you to the Official firmware. As much as I would love you to download my torrent, don't eff up your xbox :)"
,dyjhae1,2011-09-23T04:55Z,"what if you dont play xbox live, will it work?"
,reaper998,2011-09-25T06:17Z,"Where is the best place to go for information on jtag, 1.6 LT, etc?  I have an Xbox 360 that I enhanced 1 year ago to play burned DVD games (backups).  I just loaded Dead Island and it did as you said, effed up my xbox.  Now it won't play any games.  Can I fix that now that it's been effed?  What is the best way to play backed up games and how to do it?  Please help."
,daveybx,2011-09-25T20:37Z,@reaper998 you will have to reflash your xbox you can jtag them with usb drives but havent done that myself so not 100o/o sure if it works but i had to reflash my xbox after i updated it
,adziboi,2011-09-27T14:34Z,"Will this work 13146 Dashboard
LT1.9 Flash"
,reaper998,2011-09-27T23:39Z,"Thanks daveybx for replying.  I was thinking about reflashing my DVD drive and seeing if that would work so i can play at least my old backups, but wasn't sure if the update was to the DVD drive or the actual Xbox.  I still would like to find a good concise place where I can get answers and direction.  Thanks again."
,yojoe23,2011-10-14T01:43Z,tried to burn this iso with the latest XBC and Imgburn. Wouldn't work with either and I already had LT 2.0 loaded on my phat xbox.
