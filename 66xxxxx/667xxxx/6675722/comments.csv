,cristiandior,2011-09-19T20:59Z,"For best 3D playback try the Cyberlink Power DVD 11. Some 3D movies from PB are not full 3D. See the size of the download. This is good but the Avatar 3D is better.

On cyberlink check the 3D button. Same on youtube. Also use HDMI 1.4a leads.

LilGeorge thank you. You are a pro. Seeds 100%"
