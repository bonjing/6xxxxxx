Harvest of Fear (2004) 

The annual Harvest Fest is on the horizon and as the citizens of Devil's Lake prepare to celebrate, a mysterious killer emerges to claim the souls of all who participate in director Brad Goodman's grisly rural chiller. As the hard-partying co-eds come out to party and the yearly celebrations get under way, the rising body count puts a bloody damper on the rural romp.
