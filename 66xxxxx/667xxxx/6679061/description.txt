1970s
The 1970s was a pivotal decade for Batman, one in which he transitioned from TVs campy Caped Crusader into today's Dark Knight Detective!

Now, legendary scribe Len Wein (DC UNIVERSE: LEGACIES) tells a never-before-revealed tale from this era in a brand-new story!

Unfortunately 1970s comic does not include the reprint.


1980s
Someone using the name, appearance and methodology of The Reaper is killing off the mobsters of Gotham City...but both of the men who previously masqueraded as The Reaper are dead! Meanwhile, Batman must shepherd an untried Robin â€“ Jason Todd.
