S04E05 WhereÂ´s grandad

A 24-year-old Southland mystery is being tackled by TV psychics show Sensing Murder. On April 20, 1985, Alan Gordon Woodford, of Bedford St, Mossburn, simply vanished. He was 65. Mr Woodford left his home on foot that Saturday morning and was never seen or heard of again. Weeks of searching by police, family members and volunteers, taking in all rivers in the area and a shoulder-to-shoulder search of the Takitimu mountains, found nothing. Family members, including Mr Woodford's wife Jean, now 89, were reluctant to comment on the case or the psychics' involvement, but son Donnie Woodford said revisiting the case had been hellish for the family.
