This lavish drama recreates one of the most infamous air disasters in history, that of the Hindenburg. The much lauded, giant airship had been the toast of Nazi Germany when construction completed, but in 1937 it, along with its passengers and crew, was destroyed when its cargo of gas combusted. This dramatization of the events traces the Hindenburgâ€™s fateful flight and its aftermath
