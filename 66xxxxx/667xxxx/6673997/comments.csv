,tompic823,2011-09-14T04:01Z,I accidentally posted it in the wrong section and editing is currently disabled. I need a MOD to change it.
,cutechicinawhiteT,2011-09-14T04:16Z,"Haha, I agree dragoncorp.

BTW, get it here for free without torrents:

Turning to torrents :)"
,limbocity,2011-09-14T05:49Z,The Hash is different from the one posted on the Microsoft website. Is this unavoidable?
,limbocity,2011-09-14T05:49Z,I mean the hash shown in the torrent info when downloading.
,alisson3000br,2011-09-14T06:20Z,"i tried twice to download from microsoft website and failed at 2.00 gb, please people seed!"
,mteigers,2011-09-14T07:38Z,Currently Seeding at 500 kb/s :D Much faster than the Microsoft Website.
,sackofnoise,2011-09-14T07:48Z,Go torrents go... failed twice from microsoft...
,cutechicinawhiteT,2011-09-14T08:33Z,Downloading from Microsoft website at a constant 7.5MB/s.

,tompic823,2011-09-14T22:40Z,"limbocity- The hash displayed in uTorrent is for the torrent itself (size, pieces, etc.) and not the individual files."
,SeedingTheFields,2011-09-15T01:40Z,Yeah... X( 4 hours on a 4gb file and it crashed @ 600mb
,SeedingTheFields,2011-09-15T01:43Z,I do find it humorous that the torrent network can be more stable than microsofts offical download server XD

,filmymonk,2011-09-15T15:47Z,"if you are stuck around 2 gb on microsoft, copy that file to the same location where ur torrents gets downloaded. when u start downloading this file from torrent, it will automatically show that U have downloaded 2 gb :) ir works only if u were downloading the same file. "
,darkkewlz,2011-09-16T00:09Z,"Downloading now, so this may be a dumb question. But is it automatic for duel boot? i.e: OS choice menu, or do i need to use a Boot Manager? and Partition separately for this install?
Thanks for any responses."

,segin,2011-09-18T05:58Z,"Everyone! The ""torrent hash"" shown in the Torrent Info is the BitTorrent ""info_hash"" and has ABSOLUTELY NOT A DAMNED THING TO DO WITH THE ISO'S SHA1 HASH. It's instead a SHA1 hash of the torrent *metadata* - read: the tiny bit of info stored in the .torrent file itself!

I have downloaded this torrent and verified it's SHA1 with Microsoft FCIV.

AND -PEOPLE!- THIS IS A DEVELOPER PREVIEW!!! that meens that it shows the full capabilities of this new START menu called Metro UI so they can build their apps for it. THIS IS NOT A STABLE BUILD TO USE AS YOUR PRIMARY OS."
,undeadxinfection,2011-11-17T00:25Z,"Dont make a comment foolishly. Microsoft supports installing this for bug reporting. In other words, I installed this over Windows 7 a while ago. You can install it in a separate partition if you don't feel comfortable. But it runs better than Windows 7 and is stable. Completely stable. Minor flaws:
No DVD support (yet) and one game (Rusty Hearts) isn't playable because the OS isn't supported. "
,undeadxinfection,2011-11-17T00:25Z,"It's a free, legal OS that works perfectly. Have fun and stop complaining."
,undeadxinfection,2011-11-17T05:41Z,"also, if its not compatible to the OS, run in compatibility mode."
