From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes to the show Alfred Adask, the publisher of the AntiShyster News Magazine. Adask is the founder of one of the largest legal reform organizations, Citizens for Legal Reform. He ran for the Texas Supreme Court in 1992 and received 201,000 votes. Earlier this year, he was the target of a CBS 60 Minutes hit piece on the Sovereign Citizen movement. In response, Adask penned a piece entitled "Am I About To Be Labeled a 'Domestic Terrorist'?"

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
