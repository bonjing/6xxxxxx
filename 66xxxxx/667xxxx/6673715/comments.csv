,jupiter50,2011-09-15T19:29Z,the problem seems to be that the original seeder stopped.  nobody else has the whole file.  shameful behaviour.

,damiancsmn,2011-09-25T04:53Z,"I'm using KM Player or UM Player and is ok.In my humble opinion KM Player is the best player around in the last 2 or 3 years.Works with a lot more formats then VLC,BS Player or Gom Player, and the filters incorporated are great and the result is a great video quality.Is free,so give it a try and you will be pleased."
,hiddendanger,2011-09-26T22:40Z,@damiancsmn....i downloaded KM player n it plays other files but not this download....as for UM player i cant find it. maybe there is something wrong with this download....

,DTTNWO,2011-11-26T18:25Z,"@hiddendanger 
There's nothing wrong with this download. You do realise the files need extracting?
