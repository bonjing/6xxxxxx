        War In The Gulf: Arsenal: Rolling Power 

        The combat capability of the modern army depends on a  careful
        balance of many  types of advanced  weapons, all of  them fast
        -moving, all of the deadly. Learn how modern armies  translate
        tactics and  technology into  war fighting  capability through
        realistic  training.  Examine the  development  of the  modern
        combat division, from its roots in World War I, to the  coming
        of age of the tank during World War II, finally halting on the
        modern battlefield. The largest and most lethal of the  combat
        divisions  used  today   is  the  Heavy   Manoeuvre  Division,
        exemplified by the US  Army's 24th Infantry Division.  The key
        combat elements - tanks, infantry, artillery and army aviation
        - are examined. Featured equipment includes the M1 Abrams main
        battle  tank,  infantry  vehicles  such  as  the  M2  Bradley,
        artillery systems including  the M109 self-propelled  howitzer
        and the MLRS, and close-air support vehicles such as the AH-64
        Apache.
