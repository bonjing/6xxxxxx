,SgtSposh,2011-09-13T22:43Z,"ty 4 the up extremezone! but I heard from some ppl the game is (not the baddest)shit and watched some gameplay vidz wich looked more like ""funfair - we do 3 million explosions around no base to make up"" kinda style and imho it looks like serious sam on shadowrun painting wich is kinda ""limited... 
say like the duke wich is plain 1995 gameplay wannabe nobrainer... anyone playing it can gimme some sort of feedback atm? I have like 6 games on short notice now and not too much time so I rly would give a cyberpunk game wich is like ""medium"" a shot be4 them cause I like the setting"

,dumas1000,2011-09-13T23:57Z,Those games aren't out yet. Check back in two weeks for Driver San Francisco. I other has undergone delays. I'm not sure. 
,dumas1000,2011-09-14T00:08Z,"Actually, I see advertisements pimping Red Ochestra being out now, although it was delayed multiple times. I've see no evidence through scene-release circles of that game being out though. Driver is definitely no available yet. Is this game an indie game, cause I'm always weary of indie PC games. I've heard so little about it that I don't know if a recognizable dev made this or not. My hunch is to say no. I might grab this if black box or Kaos bothers to repack it."

And Most Pirates Around The World That Have Overly Protected Antivirus Software Installed Should Just Switch It Off >real Time Protection< Till The Game Is Finished Installed, Then Add That ""InstallPath"" To Your Antivirus Exclusion List. 

REASON : Developers Are Trying To Make It Hard For Crackers/Hackers To Bypass their Game protection, That's Why when Scene Groups ""SKIDROW,RELOADED,FLT,RAZOR1911"" ect Creates A Crack , It Gets Flagged As A Virus , In Which It's Actually NOT.

,elcapizzo,2011-09-22T16:23Z,"how much is this on steam? i wish they allowed you to download and play games for free on a client network like steam and then ask you to donate at the end if you actually enjoyed it, rather than making you pay before and potentially not enjoying the game and feeling ripped off."

The above is what ended up working for me.  Thanks for the tip."
,Mauler1,2011-09-23T11:22Z,Game runs sweet... 1 question all... the game has checkpoints hey? I haven't had the opportunity 2 save! 
,elcapizzo,2011-09-23T11:37Z,"Played this for about 5 hours and it has been working perfectly. Torrent was great; fast download, easy/fast/simple install (just follow the instructions).

10/10 torrent quality (so far)
"
,elcapizzo,2011-09-23T11:46Z,"The graphics, cut-scenes are quite good. The game play, story and enemies remind me of a mix between Doom/Quake (no reloading of weapons, you can't crouch/crawl, and cyborg enemies) Bioshock (kill enemies by shooting electrical devices or flammable barrels etc; upgrade stations).

If you enjoy such games or movies as I mentioned above you will probably enjoy this. It's a hark back to classic FPS games before anything cutting edge or innovative like gravity/portal guns rose to prominence. 

It gets a little repetitive at times, and is also quite challenging, even for a seasoned FPS player. Overall I give Hard Reset a solid 7 out of 10. It's well worth playing while you are waiting for the next big game to come out (still waiting for Half Life 2: Episode 3 to come out!!!)."
,elcapizzo,2011-09-23T11:52Z,"@ mahyaz96 yes, that is my idea. How else are game developers going to work with file sharing? It's a loosing battle. Instead they should provide a secure, working version of the game to download instantly online and then offer a direct, easy to use donate service within the game menu and at the end. if you thought the game was good and enjoyed it you can donate a nominal amount, say $5 or $10 which goes directly to the company responsible for creating the game. They could also integrate optional upgrades, extensions or packages which you can buy if you want them - but they are not critical to the main game storyline."
,elcapizzo,2011-09-23T11:53Z,"Also, another idea is crowdsourcing t produce games. You design a game, market it, get  a few thousand people to all chip in a few bucks, make the game and then everyone who contributed will get various rewards such as mechanise, direct downloads to the game, extra add-ons or packages etc.

There's lots of ways to make money, the sooner companies realise that the old way of creating, packaging and selling games in retail format is dead the better.. rather than making common folk who P2P out to be criminals!"
,elcapizzo,2011-09-23T11:56Z,"I know that I downloaded Portal 2 I was extremely satisfied with the game.. but what should I do then? Should I go out and buy the game just because I liked it? No, I won't do that and neither will most other people. However, if they had a donate feature where I could donate using Paypal or something like that I would have been more than happy to send them a $5-10 directly. Better than nothing."
