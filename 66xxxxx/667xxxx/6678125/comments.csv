,pryingeyes,2011-09-15T18:18Z,"If all you need is the update, you can get it here directly from Microsoft, at much higher speeds (and it's 122 Mg, so also a much smaller file). I can confirm that installing the update over your existing version will not cause you to lose your registration."

Works perfectly on my MB Pro running OSX 10.6.8.  Thanks Anacondaz!"
,RoadDog66,2011-10-31T01:54Z,"Thanks, Anacondaz. Just downloaded at lightning speed and everything works and installs quickly and simply. I've been planning to take this software for a trst drive and this is the perfect way to do so. Will acquire the license in due course if it seems to work ok."

Everything installed fine. Just confused on how the Serial was bypassed"

,siank,2011-12-13T22:00Z,"Help please! This may be a stupid question - I've downloaded the torrent - generally when I do this I use WinRAR to open the files - this isn't working in this instance! What application do I use to open this as there is no setup.exe in any of the files?

Thx"
,siank,2011-12-14T10:01Z,Skip my last comment guys - sussed it!
,siank,2011-12-14T12:09Z,"Thickco's back again!  

I know with WinRAR you can select one file and it selects them all - this isn't happening.

Help would be much appreciated to a novice : 0"

The upgrade installation doesn't find the installed office program. The original file from the ms-site doesn't work either. What could be wrong?"

,jtwg,2012-01-24T21:11Z,"@ladyfknsnowbanana
the pirate bay have switched to magnetic links as default, you need to set the default applications to your torrent client. i suggest some googling. if you knew to torrents perhaps you dont have a torrent client yet, in which case i recommend reading up about how torrents work. goodluck"
,Jchristo4,2012-02-12T13:48Z,"Works perfectly on my MBP running Lion OSX 10.7.2. Thank you!

-Funny thing is after I downloaded from torrent.
-Installed MS Office 2011.
-Update took me quite awhile been through a lot of updates have to click~click~click on update till reached to 14.1.14.

Anyone went through like me so much of an update? Curious..

Sides, glad everything works fine, first time on my Mac and first time download/installed MS Office on my Mac =D"
,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2012-02-19T22:25Z,"its working great, but i wonder if we can update it when it needs updating? "
,soichi,2012-03-07T17:23Z,What a waste of my time. I wish the uploader would have at least told us this is not cracked. It's just the program itself. There's no hack or mod... had to download the whole torrent just to read the .nfo file and then find out its just for evaluation. Seriously...? wtf.
