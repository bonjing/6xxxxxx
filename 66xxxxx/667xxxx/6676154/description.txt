The residents of an old building in an unnamed city are
about to be evicted to make way for a shiny new sky scraper
with luxury rentals.
They've watched as the residents of the whole block are
relocated without care or compassion and are grimly determined
not to let it happen to them.
Meanwhile, the construction site of the first building in the
complex starts having fatal accidents that result in work
stoppages. Are the residents of the tenement waging war on
their evictors?
