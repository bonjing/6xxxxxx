This is just a 6min video of me using the latest Windows 8 beta x64bit version.

No narrating or subtitles, this video is just to give you an idea of whats to come.



And i think it is awesome.

It is like windows 7...and the o.s for tablets combined into 1.

Microsoft are taking a gamble with this and putting everything into it, if they fail they go bust. But trust me, this operating system will drag them out the dark ages kicking and screaming. :P
