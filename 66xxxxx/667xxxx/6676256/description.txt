        War In  The Gulf: Desert Storm: The Ground Assault

        Following  the  continual   pummelling  of  Iraqi   forces  by
        Coalition air forces, the ground units launched a rapid  three
        -day drive deep into the  left flank of Iraqi forces,  routing
        the battle  hardened armies  of Saddam  Hussein in  one of the
        most stunning victories in  modern warfare. Join the  ranks of
        Marine and Saudi  units fighting for  Khafji, then follow  the
        Coalition's heavy manoeuvre divisions in a sweeping,  flanking
        manoeuvre. The Ground Assault examines the weapons and tactics
        of the Desert Storm ground offensive in dramatic fashion using
        actual footage from the Gulf. Discuss the implications of  the
        seemingly crushing victory  with the soldiers  responsible for
        securing Kuwait's  freedom and  the experts  tasked to analyze
        the incredible victory in the desert.
