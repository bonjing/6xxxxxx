Gourmet Vegetarian Slow Cooker: Simple and Sophisticated Meals from Around the World
Lynn Alley (Author)

Paperback: 128 pages
Publisher: Ten Speed Press; Original edition (March 2, 2010)
Language: English
ISBN-10: 158008074X
ISBN-13: 978-1580080743

Overabundant quotation marks and occasional preaching aside, the recipes in this concise collection are simple and tempting. Organized by broad cuisine categories (Indian, Mexican and Southwestern, Greek, and so on), the dishes in this book don't school readers in the finer points of different cultures' cooking styles, but they do offer easy, tasty options for meat-free comfort food: slow-cooked grits with chili and cheese; polenta gnocchi in tomato sauce; wild mushroom stew on noodles. Appealing photos showcase prepared recipes that feel a step above traditional slow cooker fare, such as rustic potato and poblano gratin; risotto with lentils; polenta lasagna with tomato mushroom sauce; and Japanese-style braised tofu. The handful of surprisingly chic desserts sprinkled throughoutâ€”including red wine and cherry risotto; Mexican chocolate pudding cake; walnut and apple bread puddingâ€”are a sweet bonus. (Mar.)
