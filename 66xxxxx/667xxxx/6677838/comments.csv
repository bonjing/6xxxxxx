Yep, remember this, good series indeed, watched some of these when re-aired in the mid 80's.

Obviously, as you use plural tense not singular, you've more ep's of this, hope it's all 26 episodes, 2x series at 13 ep's each.
If so, will be D/L'ing every one, my son will enjoy these as well but most of all, it takes me back to my youth these old series, was 4-5 years old when it first came out.

Here's VLC player from safe source, aspect ratio control is ->Video drop menu, or right click menu, try 16:9.

,DeltaPan,2011-09-16T09:53Z,"OK, said the above before seeing the file.

16:9 is the encoded aspect ratio, selecting others won't improve frame size at all.

This will get you full screen, full frame

In Video menu, deselect 'Scale', which will shrink the frame and that is required else next step will enlarge too much, then in 'Zoom' select 2:1 (double) and frame will expand to full screen, that's the way to do it.

Peace. : )"
[V],TheExecutive,2011-09-16T13:32Z,"Yes, the guy who encoded these is in Britain, mate, and so we're stuck with the 16:9 aspect 
ratio that he chose to use.  

Why?  I don't know... it's a 4:3 ratio show as all TV series were 40 years ago when this was 
produced.

As you suggested VLC Player can easily correct that.  Simplly go into full screen first, then hit the ""C"" key a few  times until it expands to 4:3 with no loss in video quality."
