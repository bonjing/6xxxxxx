
This light English drama series was about a parolee 
who is always getting into trouble, but narrowly manages 
to escape going back to jail.

Ex-pop singer Adam Faith played Ronald "Budgie" Bird , 
the main character. 

As with most British programs from that era, this show 
was shot on videotape indoors and on 16 mm film outdoors.  
Don't let the cheapness of the production fool you 
-- this is an interesting show!

I didn't encode these, but the guy who did used the wrong 
aspect ratio. Fortunately some video players can still enlarge the
picture to full-screen with no loss in quality, and the picture is
sharp and clear!  Also he did these as MKV files.
