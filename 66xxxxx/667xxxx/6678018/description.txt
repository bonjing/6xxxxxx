Would-be bakers could hardly ask for a better instructor than Malgieri, a prolific cookbook author (How to Bake, A Baker's Tour, Perfect Cakes) and director of the baking program at the Institute of Culinary Education. Though his previous books have for years made solid home cooking resources, this volume's clarity and simplicity may make it his most well-received yet. In it, Malgieri manages the considerable feat of condensing his process for creating pies, tarts, cookies and other baked goods into only the most crucial steps, without sacrificing taste or texture. Relying on a food processor for most mixing tasks (in place of labor-intensive steps like folding), Malgieri patiently guides readers through some of the baking world's most daunting delicacies, including French baguettes, brioche, tart dough, and homemade puff pastry. With Malgieri's confidence-building tutelage and a little practice, readers will be frosting cakes and cranking out scones like pros, and the chef offers multiple variations to try once the basics have been mastered. Though the layout leaves something to be desired--a mix of too-small typefaces, especially in ingredient lists, is sure to cause eyestrain--this makes a solid introduction and a dependable resource.
