,lewie_2011,2011-09-14T14:28Z,Legit. Thanks! Seeding. Please support the band by pre-ordering the physical copy like I have.
,Johngoundry86,2011-09-14T17:09Z,"It's Legit!!!! Good Quality - My only knack is if your using this in iTunes you'll have to apply the album cover that's provided to all the songs, because the one that's in the metadata of the songs is squished and looks funky. I'm seeding!"
,bil_gr7,2011-09-14T17:29Z,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,mojo01,2011-10-03T19:39Z,"Hey guys - just a note; you're not supporting the artist by buying their album. You're supporting the record label (aka. Fat Cats). Also, this is mp3... if you're a teenager, I recommend getting FLAC so you can hear every frequency possible. You'll thank me in the end.

Peace."
