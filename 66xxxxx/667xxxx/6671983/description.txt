My thanks to the original seed, even though it took over a WEEK to download just 1.5GB I got there in the end.   This is simply the BEST quality Audio and Video you will get from the mid 1960's.   A must for any serious collector I have edited the music into useable tracks and tagged them using industry standards so this lot is good to go on your 1960s Video night...  Aha.. yes you can now have one :)
