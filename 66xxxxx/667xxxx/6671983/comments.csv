,rigmar_radio,2011-09-13T09:30Z,"This is also available on eBAY, I will try get the whole series if possible.  I am not sure if this was a home made DVD as it looks very very professional and even has the record company bar code, not that this means anything in 2011 with the computer power most people have at home."
