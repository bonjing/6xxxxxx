The Flying Pink Pig [Blu-ray Rip]

The hubbub has finally died down from the "Flying Pink Pig" fiasco, but the taco-based double entendres have not. The original food truck-themed porn movie, for which Flying Pig owner Joe Kim may or may not have knowingly rented his truck to XXX filmmaker Erica McLean, is getting a sequel, "The Flying Pink Pig: Part 2," which comes out on August 30th.


What's on the menu this time? Alexis Texas, a sex tape and and a gang of nymphomaniacal taqueras. Sunny Lane and Nicki Hunter reprise their roles as sex-starved taco slingers, while Ron Jeremy returns as a nefarious businessman plotting to steal their truck. Spoiler alert: Sex is used as enticement, currency and distraction.

For all the hoopla, the controversy doesn't seem to have hurt Kim's business. He recently opened a brick-and-mortar Flying Pig cafe in Little Tokyo. Besides, they disinfected all of the truck's counters after the last go-around. 

Just don't get the wrong idea, people. Most taco truck workers bare a lot less cleavage. Try the "wink-wink, nudge-nudge" routine when you order the double carnitas special, and you probably won't get anything extra, aside from a baffled look.
