,underclock4,2011-09-12T20:29Z,@blacktroy: Stop harping about the bloody program and seed..how else will people download!!!
,jersson,2011-09-12T20:43Z,Oh my god. This is what I'm looking for and it work's on XP. Lets see if it work's on W/7. I downloaded from their website and it didn't work on W/7 so let's see. Thank's BLACKTROY
[V],BLACKTROY,2011-09-12T20:51Z,what is this idiot talking about?@underclock4.everything you see on the discription of the software is same on the vendor - web-site. you are a fucking bastard leecher
,underclock4,2011-09-12T21:40Z,"@blacktroy: when I posted the comment there were no seeders nor leechers(You would do well to check the time of my post and cross reference with activities). If you read my comment I did not make any negative comment regarding the actual software and describing me as a 'f***ing bastard leecher' actually sums up your psychological disposition. Oh, by the way up-loader, I hold no grudge or hard-feelings towards you.
Have a good day. 

To all the others who are downloading this program, I'll post my feed-back after trying it out."
,jersson,2011-09-12T21:59Z,"Still at 0 % my friend but soon I hope, Thank's for your effort"
[V],BLACKTROY,2011-09-12T22:44Z,"underclock4 . before you rush posting negative comment regarding the slow pace of my upload. ve stated on my upload,that since i install the new utorrent v 3.uploading is alway slow. i presume you didn't read it before you lash-out. ve notice. most negative comment is alway from leechers with empty profile like you"
,HezelSon,2011-09-12T22:50Z,Too much flapdoodle instead of action!!!!!!!
[T],djjlicious,2011-09-12T23:50Z,"NO SEEDERS, U got a Scull?????????"
[T],djjlicious,2011-09-13T00:08Z,"Downloading over 2 hours.
NOTHING!!!!"
,smurellee,2011-09-13T06:55Z,the torrent is not even starting to download.i was waiting for 30 minutes. Is something wrong or should I do anything to get it
,smurellee,2011-09-13T07:08Z,it does not even start ????????
,jersson,2011-09-13T13:46Z,Thank's for uploading but it doesn't work for W/7 and neither does the vers on the manufactures site. They have to come up with a new vers that work's for W/7. XP is ok though. Thank's for all your effort
,underclock4,2011-09-13T15:43Z,"@blacktroy: You crack me up man!!! Anyway this is not working on W/7; not that I had very high hopes since the description stated XP and VISTA.
Will keep checking 2 see if you will get one which works for W/7.
BTW no one puts on the kettle knowing he's of tea bags!
Cheers! "

,jersson,2011-09-15T14:16Z,I checked the developers website and it says vers 5.9 updated for W/7 and it still doesn't work and I tried to contact them as well but no answer. I wonder when they will update it ?
,billylopez,2011-09-16T21:05Z,"its working no probs for me????
it's really cool and it has about 100 skins or more and it just takes over ur task-bar clock.. 
it makes the task-bar look so much better
and I'm using win 7 32bit
4g ddr3 ram 
AMD quad core 2.8g
512mb ATI Radeon HD 5780 graphics card
so as u can see i have a standard setup and I never have problems with any download from pirate bay.. Just gotta know what to look for and who ur getting it off"
,caFFelne,2011-10-22T16:58Z,"Mr Blacktroy, could u upload a nice alarm clock for win 7??"
,maxjasper,2011-11-02T22:16Z,"BLACKTROY, God bless you...thanks a lot...wonderful job...you saved my life from the stupid pop up warning number of days left."
,teacherdan,2011-12-15T11:38Z,"Perhaps all of you should note that this is the 32-bit version.  A 64-bit version is available on the website, but I haven't found a crack for it yet."
