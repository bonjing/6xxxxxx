                           Atomic Alarm Clock 5.9

HOLY CRAP! Did you know you can use your COMPUTER as an ALARM CLOCK!? I did. Man, did I! I knew the crap out of that fact. But did you? I won't be a jerk - you probably did.

Let's just pretend you didn't, though. Let's also pretend that someone else set up your computer to be an alarm clock without you knowing and it played "Take On Me" by A-Ha at 4:30am. Man, that is a great thought. I feel alive just thinking about it. That thought is like a good steak - seasoned quite well and not cooked TOO much. That makes no sense. Speaking of taste:

They have awesome fricking clocks with many different looks FOR ANY TASTE! EVEN PEPPERMINT! Well, not seriously. The thing that is serious is that you can play "Take On Me." Or any MP3. At any time. You can also can run a program, log off, reboot, shut down, power off etc... You don't have to buy it, either. I'm not saying your shins won't be broken if you don't buy it, but you don't HAVE to.

What I mean to say is that there is a trial you can download and use for 60 days. So if you have a temp job coming up and you need an alarm clock (one that syncs to the Internet) - one that lasts 2 months - use this nifty little Atomic Alarm Clock thing.

Or I will break your shins. Seriously. I will find you and I will break your shins. And it's Atomic. That is like nuclear. So it's awesome. Like, crazy awesome. At least it's better than getting your shins broken.

It doesn't really have to make sense, though. Nothing really does on this.
