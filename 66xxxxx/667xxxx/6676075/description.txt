 :::::[ PLOT SUMMARY ]:::::
 
                                                                       
   Koreyoshi Kurahara adapted a novel by Yukio Mishima for Thirst for  
   Love (Ai no kawaki), a tense psychological drama about a young      
   woman who is widowed after marrying into a wealthy family, and      
   becomes sexually involved with her father-in-law, while harboring   
   a destructive obsession with the family gardener. Kurahara's        
   atmospheric style is a perfect match for Mishima's brooding         
   sensuality.
