I do have a couple requests: Tuck Everlasting. My daughter loves the movie and there aren't any copies of it up on TPB last I checked. Thanks again for your efforts.
Also: The Man Without A Face. It is an earlier Mel Gibson that, again, doesn't appear to be present on TPB.

If you can do them, fantastic. If not, thanks anyway!"

Man Without A Face IS available on TPB, but with hard subs or in poor quality."
