- Type these two letters: FC in the search box and Click on ""Find Next""

- Make sure to have your Internet Connection on.
- Now you're good to go

Important note****
Make sure that after each try, you close the powersuite icon in your system tray after you hit quit in license window. otherwise it will not apply the new registry values.

Another important note***
After you have followed all the steps and you open Powersuite, you will probably get the pop up window to input the serial... just put in the serial that is in the above instructions... you should be good to go.."
