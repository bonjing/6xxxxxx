,Shank9,2011-09-18T15:46Z,"I have a strange request.

I have a DELL XPS L502X Lappie and NVIDIA's optimus refuses to let the PES settings recognize the GT540M gc.

Could someone mail me the settings.bat file from ""My Documents/KONAMI/PES2012 Demo"" with the settings set to:

Resoln - 1366x768
Picture Quality - High
and all options enabled.

my email id is - shashankvenugopal90@gmail.com

Thanx in advance. :)"
