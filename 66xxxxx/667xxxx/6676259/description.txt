        War In The Gulf: Desert Storm: The Air Assault

        The Gulf War marked the  first itme in the history  of warfare
        that  an air  campaign had  been so  openly displayed  to the
        general public. Fly over Baghdad with the first sorites of the
        Operation in stealthy F-117's. Hunt Scuds with other high-tech
        Coalition  aircraft  while  riding  shotgun  in  an  F-4G Wild
        Weasel. Talk to the pilots  and crews of these incredible  air
        forces,  while  sorting out  the  data with  the  world's most
        respected military analysts who explain the reasons behind the
        success of this  dramatic air campaign.  Finally, look at  the
        tactics  and  discuss the  ways  the deployment  of  these new
        systems minimised allied casualities.  The air campaign was  a
        wake-up call to the future  of warfare. Witness it once  again
        in THE AIR ASSAULT.
