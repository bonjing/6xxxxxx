,shelbylab,2011-09-19T19:44Z,Don't know what you are doing wrong but you need to check your encoding methods. Thanks for the effort though. 
[T],L3G3ND,2011-09-21T15:35Z,"@ shelbylab,

i am looking over it. But it isnt my fault bcoz there are only 2-3 blu-ray ripping softs. And i am having problems with dvdfab.

It is such a pain in ass to rip full hd 50 gb blu-ray and then upload it. I had done 42 rips till now."
,jonmobrien,2011-09-26T10:26Z,"From the comments, including the uploader's, is this a bad rip?"
,cleverjack,2011-09-29T07:17Z,"if the audio is giving you trouble, it's because of the AC3 encoding, it's rough for some systems to read."

1)Download x264 encoder
2)mkvextract.exe(MKVextractGUI) from MKVtoolnix to demultiplex it 
3)enter 3d packing information x26464bit.exe  --frame-packing 3 -o FinalDestination.mp4 ""The Final Destination 3D_Track1.h264'
4)Converted 6 channel ac3 to 128kbps mp3 using Ac3Tool

,AllzCool123,2011-12-17T08:24Z,"Dude, you are doing a great job uploading stereoscopic 3D rips. But why are you not including a video sample in the torrent. Shouldn't be too hard to do that."
