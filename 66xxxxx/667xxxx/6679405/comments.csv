[V],smbdownload,2011-09-18T15:47Z,well looks like the FLAC snobs are at it with the negative ratings - I personally love FLAC - and use it often - it's an AWESOME format - but the fact of the matter is that most people DO NOT and WILL NOT use the fomat - so why not share in the format that people want - after all if we take the time to start a torrent doesn't it make sense that we have a desire to share this great music with as many people as possible...not just a select 'enlightened few' - then take the care to make them sound as good as you possibly can within the confines of MP3 [which I know I do] - if you don't want MP3's... it's simple don't download them - there are many other sources for FLAC if that is what you desire....peace
