Age of Conquest is a medieval risk-like turn-based strategy game where you take the reins of a budding empire and struggle against fellow empires for control of Europe. In one game, up to 30+ players vie for supremacy, but only one can be victorious. Every game you win pushes up your score, until you don't just dominate Europe, but also your fellow players. Then all will be in your shadow and not just peasants, but even kings will worship you! All this can be yours, but only if you triumph.
