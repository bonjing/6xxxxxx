,awolgina,2012-04-24T02:56Z,"Am downloading & pissed HBO would not offer pay online streaming (without cable TV at home, if had that why need to stream online?) and won't release DVD until season 5 starts, which is stupid, they lost fans & money as a result of these bullshite games. No other series does this. So thanks for making this available. Does it include all the extras, like behind the scenes, vlogs & all that or just the episodes themselves? I usually buy the DVDs to get all the extras. I'm a huge TB fan, book and series."
,dondon57,2012-04-30T04:44Z,Is this safe to download
