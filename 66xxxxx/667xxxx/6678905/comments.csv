,fonaset,2011-10-24T15:11Z,"Good download and easy installation including the activation. But when I launch the program, it still displays ""EVALUATION COPY"" at the bottom left immediately the program is about to be launch fully. How can we rectify this problem please."
,fonaset,2011-10-24T22:00Z,"CORRECTION! CORRECTION!! CORRECTION!!!

The program works exactly as it is instructed right from installation to activation. The mistake I made was that I wrongly entered the user name at a column which says ""Phone Number"". Once again, Many Apologies."
