how about facts that destroy any claim in any religious books..."
,ispgonewild,2011-09-13T10:10Z,"lol, evidence you say. Yet what do I see? Some titles from the MOVIE-list (no movie ever will prove anything my friend):

""Signs of the last days"".
""Oral Transmission of the Quran"".

Oh and my favorite:

""The MIRACLE of the Quran"".

Go read some real books. Quran is full of shit and has no moral standard as would be expected preachings from a diety, and I should know because I've read it."

,hajije,2011-09-15T16:44Z,"HI bodthedog 
Ratified when you said make the crutch of religion, but your description is not precise.
For us Muslims who are not crutches, but is all our life we must realize that Muslim life 
Religion is to eat. Drink. Sleep. . His work. And transactions. Relations know that the Koran and Mohammed (PBUH)
Did not leave us to tell us something they did not even wash his teeth and shaving the pubic hair and armpits and make the rules are valid with all ages.As long as human the human
Hear, O my friend, you know what the content of the address I do not see this example, you are man's mind, understand and interact with what you see and hear
  And your name displayed does not indicate you have a dog that you are not a dog  You are a good person and beautiful and lovable

I did not type the message you cited even read your response (esteemed) Simpy after what I understood you to say what you want
Piece and ask you to take videos and then you hear and I am sure you change your mind after hearing
Islam is not that you know and hear about in the news as you look smart knows that news to you saying, but the dictates of their politicians in all countries of the world
I want to explain what Islam is and what I think it is the right did not come deviant material or explosives belts or the like, as you say politicized media
These are some videos showing Islam's brother Karim was a Christian like you and when they embraced Islam and became a calling on his brothers who did not understand until now
True Islam is not what you see from some Muslims who are themselves did not understand acting without knowledge distorted a lot of people without knowledge.
Regarding verbal abuse and insults, but that's what make you tip and pain in your heart good word is better if you know I have not smelled and did not fit the material but I came I thought it helps like you who do not know about Islam, but his drawing
Or what he heard

Thank you dear

,Dont_wanna_know,2011-09-16T10:27Z,"The Jews invented a harsh and vengeful God, mostly to explain why they were always getting buttfucked by their neighbors without even benefit of a reacharound. Eventually some nutball dirty hippy named Jesus decided to rewrite the Jews' God into a kind, forgiving, loving God and all the people who were tired of getting fucked in the ass by both Rome and their rabbis said, ""Shit, that's for me!"". Many years later a minor criminal in the Arabian Penninsula who just happened to be charismatic and a good natural sociologist rewrote the Jews' & Christians' God once again into the kind of warrior-god the drunken & murderous Arab barbarians could understand and get behind, he took away their wine and fermented mare's milk, rechanneled their addictive personalities in his new religion, took away access to sex for the unmarried and ordered-up polygamy so the strong & the wealthy would always have all the available women and the only way for the younger men to ever get wives (which they had to do to get laid,) was to take them by force from neighboring tribes, making conquest necessary not only as a device for controlling his own people but also for creating new adherents amongst the conquered and extending his own wealth and power.

Gods are created by the weak out of ignorance and religions are created by con men as a means of gaining power of the weak and gullible. NO sane, rational person could ever buy into such patently false lunacy but, unfortunately, most of mankind is rather stupid and quite fuckin' nuts. At least most of them have stopped being particularly dangerous to others but Islam has never matured and adapted to modern realities like most of the other religions; they all create only the occasional psychopath while Islam is still designed to create and make use of nothing but psychopaths.

Why can't you just learn to keep idiotic shit like this to yourselves, 'cause we're already full-up on crazy in the rest of the world!?!"

Sleep.  eat.  drink. And then urinate and defecate
The laws of the earth apply on you
You are lying to yourselves
  Frunh on others that Mohammad (PBUH) teachings billion Muslims are not abusing alcohol
And weighing only a few
What hides in your hearts and snobs on the creation
Why not think about the universe of His creation ????????
Are you the creators ?????

Are we in here to eat, drink and sexual intercourse ??????????
all animals do, without exception ..  .. All
Animals have instinct is driven by the law

Imagine if each one walking on the desires
The land can not be
There is the smartest and had lost you
Praise be to Allah who made the life and death

And plants and stars all subject to the law
There is no absolute freedom
In fact you are thinking of two things.
Yes or no.**do it or not do** not third
Interesting talk with you if there is no cursing and reviling and slander

,Helmer2,2012-03-17T19:04Z,"No religion is right, no religion can ever be right because religion is always wrong. Those ancient humans who created God in their image had a poor imagination and no sense of humour, thatÂ´s why the concept of God is such a great comedy today."
