,zmbe,2011-09-14T03:03Z,"@nny1 I have no idea why it's saying that. I've never uploaded a torrent before.. It seems like other people are able to dl fine though - it says there's currently 216 seeds in uTorrent. I wish I could help you, man."

,NECROFUCKOFF,2011-09-22T03:42Z,i have all these songs that are on this stuff pointless if ur a collector 
,zmbe,2011-09-22T21:30Z,"@NECROFUCKOFF, there's a couple of tracks that have never been released before this album. Magic Ninjas, Big Money, Moonlight, and Prey for Me for example. 
I pre-ordered mine on hatchetgear and got it autographed. It kinda sucks that I couldn't open the cd though. That's mainly why I uploaded the torrent - so that people who had theirs signed could still enjoy it. 2W MCL."
