 The rag-tag group of street kids known as the           
 Irregulars first appeared in the Sherlock Holmes novel  
 A Study in Scarlet in 1887. This time, the Irregulars   
 find themselves having to solve the mysterious          
 disappearance of two of their own gang, while Holmes    
 himself is accused of murder and put under house        
 arrest. Only by the combination of all their skills can 
 they hope to free Holmes and the kidnap victims, solve  
 the murders and prevent an audacious heist.
