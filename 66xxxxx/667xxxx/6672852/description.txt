 One of the Pioneers of the electronic dance music 
 scene. A national treasure of trance music. With a 
 career spanning 20 years, it might come as a surprise 
 to some that 'Nine Lives' is John 00 Flemings first 
 solo studio album. John himself admits he's a DJ 
 first, hence why it's taken him so long to present 
 his debut. Touring the world, producing TV/Movie 
 scores, whilst compiling award winning Essential 
 mixes and gold selling mix compilations, has all 
 taken precious studio time away. 'Nine lives' 
 represents a new turning point for him, Fleming being 
 a dedicated supporter of the more specialist scene. 
 John is going back to his roots, making music solely 
 aimed for the dance floor with no care for the 
 commercial mainstream. That's where the big 
 difference lies. Music with soul. Music with passion. 
 Music to represent the artist within.
