Yes this is 3D even though the 3D version of the film has not been released on Blu-ray. This version was ripped from Direct TV and is the theatrical cut of the film. This is not converted from the anaglyph version nor is it a 2D to 3D conversion, it is the original 3D footage.

This is a stereoscopic 3D rip of Meet The Robinsons, for new 3D TVs or computers with Nvidia 3D Vision. Tested with Stereoscopic Player. Enjoy!
