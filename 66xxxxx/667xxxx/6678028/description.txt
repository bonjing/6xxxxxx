Man has long ascribed to fate or destiny      
the problems he felt powerless to resist,     
resigning himself to these perceived forces.  
It is believed that if man commits an act     
of good or evil, he himself becomes the heir  
to that action. This is the concept of Karma, 
derived from the Sanskrit word kri meaning    
action. In Cape Karma, Manav (Sanskrit for    
man), played by Rahul Dev, has a strange      
destiny in store for him. He is a lonely man, 
perpetually at a crossroad. Willing to play   
his choices and eager to enjoy his freedom,   
he is ever ready for one-night stands with    
strange women, ready for new excitement, ready
forâ€¦anything. And yetâ€¦little does he know that
he is a on the edge of a dangerous precipice  
in life. When his car crashes off the highway,
he stumbles out to discover a mysterious door 
right in the middle of the highway.
