iSubtitle - Soft subtitled movies for your Apple gear

The first and only application to take full advantage of Apple's soft subtitle technology. The subtitle tracks are resolution independent and they are rendered in real-time as you watch the movie. They are always displayed at the best quality possible for your device or application, from your 50â€ HDTV down to your iPhone.

There are support for multiple languages in the same movie, and you can even switch languages on the fly as you watch.

If you already have a movie in a format that suits your needs there's no reason to re-encode it, just add the subtitles and you're good to go. If, on the other hand, your movie is not suited for your device you can batch re-encode it straight from within the application. 

You can also tag your file with metadata so it's easier to find in your growing library of tv-shows and videos.
