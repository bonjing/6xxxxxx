All physicians need to learn to diagnose and manage head pain. However, there are many causes of headache: some are secondary to other conditions; others are disorders in themselves. These factors often make differential diagnosis and treatment a challenge. This didactic atlas approaches the problem of migraine and other headaches from a visual perspective. The contents cover the history of migraine and headache, their epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment. While the central emphasis is on migraine, all types of headache are addressed. The book includes some classic illustrations from historical texts as well as modern images that illustrate the disorders and current thinking.
