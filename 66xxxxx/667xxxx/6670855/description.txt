 Royal Navy: Submarine Mission is a documentary series which follows the crew  
 on the hunter-killer class submarine HMS Turbulent. Captain Ryan Ramsey and   
 his 130 crew are getting ready for a mission that will see them stay          
 underwater for 100 days as they patrol the pirate-infested waters surrounding 
 the Horn of Africa. The uprising in Libyan though means the submarine is      
 forced to plot a new course towards Tripoli, where the crew will have to      
 protect civilians caught up in the conflict. 
                                 
                                 Enjoy!
