TMTCH return with their first album in 6 years on the eve of their 25th anniversary. Devil on the Wind combines a legendary live ferocity with a still undiminished lyricism to create an essential rock folk hybrid for volatile modern times.

Long considered one of the finest live experiences thrown up by the British music scene, TMTCH have harnessed their passionate live power to create a kaliedoscopic, fully realised album of folk, rock and country influences. Ably steered by producer Pat Collier, the material ranges from international panoramas to intimate personal vignettes, all played with a seasoned sureness that still erupts into adrenalin pumped ferocity...
