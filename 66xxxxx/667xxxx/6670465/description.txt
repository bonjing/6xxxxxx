A young girl is pushed into a marriage with a minor aristocrat many years her senior. She has his child but finds herself being seduced by her neighbour, the first to show her any emotional warmth. Drawing heavily upon the novel by Theodore Fontaine, Fassbinder uses the central figure as an index of society moralities, as she is exploited by all those that surround her.
