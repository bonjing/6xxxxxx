,sneak_shot,2011-09-14T23:34Z,hey doesnt work on km player
,leo_hai,2011-09-17T08:57Z,I am not a technical guy but Left no stone unturned to play it through MPC & Nero showtime but both of these failed to play it. I know both players can play MKV files . so with appalogy to tdkdemon the torrent seems have some problem. I willn't recomend any to download it .  downloading with as slow as 1MB broadband connection for hours and ending up with nothing in hand is quite disappointing :( ! 
[T],tdkdemon,2011-09-17T10:58Z,"@sneak_shot n Leo....

Use VLC player it is working....
its not mkv format but the codecs are the one which matters...
this one built with AVC..

Dont worry VLC plays every thing..."
