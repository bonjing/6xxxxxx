In the third installment of the hit Zenon Disney Channel Original Movie trilogy, Zenon Kar (Kirsten Storms) is a space-aged teenager in the year 2054. Having always been successful at everything she does, she jumps at a chance to compete in the first Galactic Teen Supreme contest. The only thing standing in her way is the lack of a hot-pod license needed for the first stage of the contest - a pod race from the earth to the Moonstock Festival on the moon. After a few near-misses during her driving test, her pod is taken over by some mysterious force that allows her to land safely on earth and get her license.
