,tymzn32,2011-09-15T01:47Z,Thank you very much for the upload.  Any chance we can get a hold of the new 8th ed solution manual? the 7th edition solutions posted here on TPB seems to have all different problems.
,ozzfan1976,2011-09-16T17:07Z,Thank you so much for this!
[T],dynstab2,2011-09-27T03:26Z,"@tymzn32  Solution manuals are always crap shots. But if I read you right you have one fully worked problem set (7th) for study and a second set with final answers (8th) for genuine practice (the 7th set serving as a guide) and mastering of the subject. The best of both worlds, eh? Previous exam questions solved in an exam setting (timed, closed books) for final prep. Ya betta be good..."
