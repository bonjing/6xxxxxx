The early votes are from the crew giving it the highest rating hoping to offset the bad ratings they know they will get. That only works until enough people have seen it."

,soupcip,2011-09-15T22:06Z,"I am Dutch, but his product makes me ashamed.
It is really really bad. Everything. The dialog....bad as it is, its made worse cos the 99% dutch cast cannot talk decent English. Guess there was no money for a decent language coach. The story S#CKS ass, the acting is lame , the talent is zero , the camera work is just awfull, the fighting is lame as never seen before and the few special effects that are real simple they managed to fuck up. It feels like kids aged 10-12 made this movie. MYGOD worst movie in a long time. Makes the scifi-b flicks look like masterpieces."

I believe you... every word of it. Ironically , if this were a porn flick like that ridiculous poster most closely resembles, then everything you just described would be only expected. Hah! It lacks exactly that which would make it passable. A porn flick without the porn, all the fat and none of the meat."
