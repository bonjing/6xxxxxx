,AiTv,2011-09-22T22:22Z,I'm sure the quality is good hence why I'm still downloading it. But you should definitely include what format you ripped it into. Just sayin. Otherwise excellent rip.

,chango666,2011-09-27T19:00Z,"Worth buying imo, great artwork plus a DVD with 5.1 remix and documentary. But if you're expecting Death Metal, forget about it, this is called Heritage and is a sort of tribute to the 70's bands that have inspired Michael (Camel, Rainbow, Caravan). Plus, since Lindgren left the band it ain't the same. Still a perfect 10 as usual though ;D Thanx for sharing bro, "
