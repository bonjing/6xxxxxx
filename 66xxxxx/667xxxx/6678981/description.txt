Todayâ€™s risk analysis is a very challenging field, and a solid understanding of the calculations procedure associated with it is essential for anyone involved. Fires, Explosions, and Toxic Gas Dispersions: Effects Calculation and Risk Analysis provides an overview of the methods used to assess the risk of fires, explosions, and toxic gas dispersion, and then deduce the subsequent effects and consequences of these events.
The authors cover various aspects of such incidents, including the probability that an accident will occur, and how to calculate leaks, heat flux, overpressure, and the concentration of toxic clouds. The book follows by describing the consequences to people (injury or death) and material damages, and it concludes with a discussion of possible causes of destruction and common circumstances that can result in accidents.

Some key features of this book include:

    * Introduction of basic techniques of hazard identification, emphasizing "what if" and HAZOP analyses

    * Step-by-step procedures for the calculation of fires (i.e., pool fire, jet fire, fire ball), explosions (VCE, BLEVE), and concentration of toxic clouds (light and heavy gases)

    * Methods for determining probability of injuries or lethality

Invaluable to professionals, researchers, and students whose work involves predicting the consequences of accidents, this book describes simple modern methods, which are a great aid for understanding the meaning of all the variables involvedâ€”in contrast to current complicated computer packages, which produce only results. Filling the existing gap in useful literature on risk analysis, this book follows a logical structure and presents straightforward, step-by-step calculation procedures and numerous examples that will be valuable in both teaching and learning the content.

Dipl. Chem. Eng, Dr Chem. Eng.

Konstantinos Kakosimos received his Chemical Engineering Diploma in 2002 and his Ph.D. on the simulation of toxic gases dispersion from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2009. Since 2000, he works as Researcher in the Laboratory of Thermophysical Properties and Environmental Processes. In the past, he served as member of various working groups and conferences organization committees. Since 2005 he is member of the education working group of the Panhellenic Association of Chemical Engineers (Section of Northern Greece) and since 2007 of the environment working group of the Technical Chamber of Greece (Department of Central Macedonia). In 2007 he was elected as a Member of the Board of the Panhellenic Association of Chemical Engineers (Department of Northern Greece), and from 2009-today again as the Vice-President of the Association. During the previous years, he has been involved on many private, national and European projects concerning environmental and hazard studies and training of engineers. His primary scientific fields are the development of numerical models and the training for the simulation of environmental processes, and risk analysis and effects calculation.
