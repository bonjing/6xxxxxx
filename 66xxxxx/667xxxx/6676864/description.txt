Release Notes....: I suppose there were some feed issues the other night when this aired because it was letterboxed. I waited a couple days
                   to pre hoping someone had an HDTV source. I don't see this episode on A&E's schedule to reair so WS PDTV will have to do
                   for now. If I see a reair sometime, I'll pre the x264. Enjoy!
