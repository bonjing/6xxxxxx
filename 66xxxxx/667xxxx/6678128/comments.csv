It is still somewhat alive but not being seeded, though there are leechers listed.

My uTorrent shows 0 of 2 seeds and 0 of 15 peers. I'll let it run for now but if anyone reads this and has the above-mentioned torrent, another seed would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks to whomever started seeding the first one. It is now coming in.

Thank you.

Will definitely seed for a long while.
