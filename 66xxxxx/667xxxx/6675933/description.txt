Release Notes

The last two minutes of RiVER's release was encoded at a
stupidly low bitrate - 270kbit, it came to 4mb in total
(excluding audio) and is very blocky.  Our last two minutes
came out at 24mb - 6 times higher bitrate.

Yes, 30 seconds of this is end credits, but there is over a
minute of actual show content, plus "Next Time.."

If you are going to guess bitrates you should do a better job!

Samples included.
