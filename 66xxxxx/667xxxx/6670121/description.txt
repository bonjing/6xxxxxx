There are also entries for individuals such as Richard Feynman and Rosalind Franklin. Also included are 12 feature essays, for example, â€œThe Chemistry of Forensic Scienceâ€ and â€œUnification: Finding Oneness in Diversity.â€ Hundreds of color photos and illustrations help illuminate the entries, and each entry ends with a further-reading list. Following the entries are an index and more than a dozen appendixes, including a chronology, glossary, astronomical data, abbreviations, further resources, and the periodic table of elements. Preceding the entries is a list of â€œEntries Categorized by National Science Education Standards for Content.â€ This set joins Encyclopedia of Marine Science (2008), Encyclopedia of Life Science (2009), and other authoritative and accessible Facts On File science titles and is recommended for high-school, college, and public libraries.
