,Torx8,2011-09-13T22:17Z,"what... -_- if the demo (which is only 1 level) is 1.5GB, how can the full be only 3GB? -_- hope the game isn't short..."

,xidio,2011-09-13T23:59Z,"How thef uck is 29 euro ""Too much"" for a singleplayer experience? Its decently priced.
Looks awesome compared to most shit put out on the PC and is quite interesting regarding the weapons."
,call_me_nobody,2011-09-14T01:28Z,Why must extremezone and test_veridfy allways upload the same thing?
,UberVerz,2011-09-14T18:35Z,"mine had black flickering on screen
only apply the AA thats in game. no forced AA in amd control center for fix."
,TyMod,2011-09-18T02:57Z,"For anyone asking Test_verify was first.  He beat Extremezone at his own game so I love how people are saying things like ""he copied extremezone"" when in reality extreme copied him.  Thanks man.  I'm going to download Extremes because it has a higher seed ratio.  Thanks man for your effort and sorry dumb asses are giving you trouble."
,Death-Aura,2011-09-19T19:28Z,"Torx8 I honestly think you're the dumbest person on earth! I cant say i've ever met anyone dumber than you..

EVERY Skidrow release is packed to the limit, unpacked, this file is properly 8gb..

Jesus fuck..."
,wwell988,2011-10-01T15:53Z,"When I click on hardreset.exe nothing happens. The game appears in processes for a minute then disappears, that's it. 

I'm running Windows XP SP3. It's not my first time torrenting a game so I installed and copied everything accordingly.

Anyone know how to fix this?"
