,TheEmpathicEar,2011-09-17T03:33Z,"Great up!

Q: I used ""Windows Method (1)"" for USB. When I tried the ""Main Menu"" link to return, I got ISOLINUX can not do this OP with this medium [not CDROM] and error 13.

Is this just something we need to deal with and reboot?"
,TheEmpathicEar,2011-09-17T04:18Z,"Nope. I tried the ""Linux Method"" too. You still can't get back to the ""Main Menu"" from a sub-menu. I don't remember this issue from previous ""Restored"" editions?"
,dac1949,2011-09-17T07:31Z,"TheEmpathicEar, i have tested only DVD. Works, fine, sure.

I will try find what is happening.
Otherwise, we will try contato com PROTEUS."
