For installation to USB read document 'usb-installation.pdf.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Hiren's Boot CD is a vast collection of bootable and portable
utilities for the management, diagnosis and repair of computer
problems, recover lost or deleted files or cracking passwords. 
In addition, HBCD provides a means to take control of any 
computer and communicate with other computers, surf the internet, 
write documents or programs, without booting the installed 
operating system. There are literally hundreds of utilities and 
it is advised that you explore the contents before the need for 
it arises.  Hiren's Boot CD can be used in two ways:

1. As a boot CD to take control of the computer without starting
   the installed operating system so that we can do repairs or clone 
   the main disk, recover files, test the memory, clean severe
   viral infections, et.c. To do any of these simply boot the 
   computer from the CD and select a utility from the menu.
   Note that the options include a couple of Linux rescue environments
   which provide many powerful tools for solving and repairing
   Windows and Linux problems.

2. As a collection of portable repair and diagnostic utilities 
   which can be run from within Windows without installation. 
   To do this insert the CD when Windows is running and 
   select a utility from the HBCD Program Launcher menu. 
   If the CD does not autorun you may start the menu by running
   \HBCD\HBCDMenu.exe.
   When the operating system not functional or unavailable the 
   portable utilities may be still be used if we boot the 
   Mini Windows XP environment included in the CD. (4th option of
   the main boot menu).

----------------------------------------------------------------
   For example Norton Ghost can be started in three ways:
   
   -- Boot the CD, select "Dos Programs" and then "Norton Ghost".
      (useful if we wish to clone or restore the main hard disk 
      and there is not enough memory to boot Mini Windows XP).

   -- Boot the CD, select "Mini Windows XP" and then select Ghost
      from the HBCD Program launcher menu.
   
   -- Boot to your windows operating system, insert the CD and 
      select Ghost from the HBCD Program launcher menu.
