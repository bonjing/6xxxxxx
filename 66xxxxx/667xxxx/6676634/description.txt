An astonishing six-part series that brings to life the most incredible creatures that ever
existed. From Spinosaurus, the biggest killer to ever walk the Earth, to the immense seamonster
Predator X, and the deadly cannibalistic Majunasaurus - dinosaurs were more
monstrous, more horrific and bizarre than ever before imagined. Combining a 3D graphic
world, incredible CGI and stunning photo-real fight scenes, this is a whole new perspective on
dinosaurs
