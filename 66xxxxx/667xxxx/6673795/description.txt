Eve Lockhart leads us into her other world on The Body Farm, a private forensics facility that is pushing back the boundaries of scientific research and solving crimes ??? it's unchartered territory.
Here, no horror is taken for granted and murder is seen to be what it is ??? visceral and shocking.

They are called upon by police forces all over the world to provide expert knowledge to help solve crimes.
