,gagicax,2011-09-15T00:18Z,"It is a very good quality, thanks for the upload. :)
@davidsask:
Not a flash file, try a media player instead. :P It DOES work.
And it IS this long."
[V],torrentzone,2011-09-15T21:37Z,Use VLC media player the best free player with no ad aware
,joaquimario,2011-09-18T13:48Z,Very good show. Thank you very much.

,adminua,2011-09-21T17:11Z,Where can I find English subtitles?
,dukeford57,2011-09-21T20:08Z,"Davidsask, you're a dick! This plays on Media Player Classic and the KMPlayer perfectly. Audio=10, Video=10. BTW, most shows from Showtime or HBO wont play on PS3. They have anti-pirate encoding built in."
,wired2,2011-09-26T07:49Z,According to IMDB this show airs on 2 Oct.  Is this real?
,AirmaxHax,2011-09-27T00:04Z,"Yes, this is real. Showtime has it posted on their website so I'm guessing that's how it showed up here."
