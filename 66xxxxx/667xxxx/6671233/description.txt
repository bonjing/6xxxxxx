After a messy divorce with her very rich and powerful husband, Nora Wilde ( TeÃƒÂ¡ Leoni ) refuses to accept his offer of $1.8 million dollars and tries to make it on her own.

She is forced to accept their offer and starts working there as a regular papparazzi. Celebrities like Tom Hanks and Anna Nicole Smith appear as themselves and try to fight off Nora's attempts to photograph them.
