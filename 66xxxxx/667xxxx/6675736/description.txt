FUBAR DeskFiller 2011 v2
------------------------

Another release of this fucked-upp application, that will prevent all users from logging into Windows, AND fill up the desktop with utterly useless files!

After installing this app, nothing happens. Next time any user logs in, 100 random and useless files will be created on the desktop, and Windows will log out immediately.

After 3 logins, Windows will shut down completely.
And so on....

Have fun! :)
