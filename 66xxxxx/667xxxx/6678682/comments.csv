,lastjedi,2011-09-16T18:09Z,is this just the movie or does this include the deleted scenes and behind the scenes of making the movie?you don't bother to mention this at all.
,RPO1973,2011-09-17T12:26Z,"Seeing that the 6 dics with the movies are available as complete Blu-Rays, I'll do the three disks with extras after this one.
@ lastjediL: use the force, it'll give you the answers. If force don't work, use google."

,soomer,2011-09-17T20:21Z,"@RPO1973

Will you upload all of them (movies) separately or complete pack without extras?  "
,RPO1973,2011-09-18T08:58Z,"@soomer:
yes, I intend to upload all 6 movies separately as full BluRays. 
When this one has been seeded to >100% I'll first do the three disks with extras, as these don't seem to be available yet."
