,Hooker1983,2011-10-31T15:25Z,"currently downloading this torrent.  It has taken a very long time, however, I know it will be worth it.  I just would hope that out of the 238 leechers, a couple would start seeding.  it is a pretty big shame for all those people to download and not upload.  Great Job MadMik"

,LordPadriac,2012-02-11T14:52Z,Wasted a full day downloading this and I am now downloading from again from someone else by season with better quality. Whatever method was used to compress was terrible the audio and video tracks are so badly out of sync that some episodes have audio still going while the ending credits are rolling!
,v8banger,2012-04-11T07:52Z,"@LordPadriac: I am experiencing the bad sync, too. Try different media players. I started with Zoom Player. It was badly out of sync. I've tried Quicktime, VLC, and Windows Media Player. Quicktime and VLC seem to sync perfectly. I believe this means the codec being used is not playing the files properly. I'll have to try different codecs on ZoomPlayer. Good Luck. What other torrents are you downloading in case I can't get this working right?"
,BoredTurtle,2012-04-28T06:34Z,Could someone tell me what the codec used is?
,DrAdrenaline,2012-05-09T17:35Z,I'm so greatfull! Thank you very much! I will help seed.
,sober514,2012-06-06T07:09Z,"dude, i made a profile just to thank you. thank you very much!"
