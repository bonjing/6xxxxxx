But, for me, the narrator is way to 'american'. I wish there was a more british reading..."

With no little help from the American reader the book takes on a Hellerian character loaded with the ironies of war, which sadly doesn't feel particularly fresh as an approach. 
The book is a mammoth - overwritten, overcomplex and overcooked. It could have done with a very stringent edit and lost some of the characters along with a lot of their more tedious exploits. 
There are some elegant stories in here but too few and I found myself really struggling to stay on board. 
The characters, overwhelmingly male (as usual for Stephenson), are sloppily drawn, simple people cast into complex situations. This is the biggest drawback of the book: the protagonists never engage psychologically with the world they inhabit to any great extent. It's boring to see the world through their eyes. 
Ultimately this is an over-long, over-sensationalised post-cyberpunk airport novel. It  would have been a hot read 10 years ago when everyone was still hot about computer networks and all that tedious shit. 
I don't want to sound over-critical of it because I read it through, but far from a life-changing book, this is just a way to pass the time. A lot of time... "

Great sound quality, 100% data integrity, titling and tagging make this a top share for me. "
