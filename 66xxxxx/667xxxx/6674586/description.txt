                A new gang has rolled into Chatsworth with an
                unlikely mission - to save the souls of the
                community. Jesus O'Toole leads the group and seems to
                know too much about certain residents... who is his
                informant? Jesus divides opinion on the estate. Aidan
                is certainly open to the possibilities that religion
                might bring, but love soon turns to hate when local
                businesses are picketed. An explosion on the
                Maguire's turf sees the family prepare for revenge.
                Kelly is attacked by a stranger in a balaclava. A
                familiar face is on the run, but given his track
                record help isn't in abundance until Kelly comes to
                his rescue in several ways, making Shane green with
                envy. And a former resident returns, spiritually born
                again it's Patty. Missing Libby she turns to the only
                person who might know of her whereabouts - Frank.
