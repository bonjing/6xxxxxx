Malwarebytes Anti-Malware
Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware is considered to be the next step in
the detection and removal of malware. We compiled a number of
new technologies that are designed to quickly detect, destroy,
and prevent malware. Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware can detect and
remove malware that even the most well-known Anti-Virus and
Anti-Malware applications on the market today cannot.

Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware monitors every process and stops
malicious processes before they even start. The Realtime
Protection Module uses our advanced heuristic scanning
technology which monitors your system to keep it safe and
secure. In addition, we have implemented a threats center which
will allow you to keep up to date with the latest malware threats

iNSTALL NOTES

1. Unpack & Install.
2. Use our keymaker (w00t.exe) to generate id&serial.

Notes : The program does not validate serial if a keygen is
detected.

To avoid that, always CLOSE KEYGEN BEFORE VALIDATING
THE SERIAL !!!
I Won't responsible if serial is refused because you did'nt close
the keygen.

MBAM now detects some keygens as "don't.steal.our.software" :p

You remove this NFO ? I'll kill you !

ABOUT GROUP

The FiGHTiNG FOR FUN team is proud to announce that we are
the first French web group still alive with more than 11.000
releases now.
Born in april 2002, we are the coolest team of the Scene and
we always fight for more knowledge and fun. Thanks for using
our products, and see you for our 15.000th release :)

Our greetings go to all people we know and who support us.

FFF is proud to be a web group and to release nice products
for all.

FFF is powered by the B.M.E (Bonobos Monkey Engine).

If you want to join in, find in meditation the way to us and
ask for a trial membership.

FFF will not be responsible for and does NOT support warez
distribution of this release. It is forbidden to include
one of our releases in a warez distribution.
Groups or individuals will be exposed for this!

As decided by FFF council

Special note:

On some antivirus scans, FFF releases packages can reveal
"Type_Win32" or "Trojan_Type" virus...
Don't be stupid! It is not a virus nor anything else like
that. It is just some packers/cryptors which have the
same binary signature.

However, some crackhosts can modify or add malicious
things on FFF releases (like "crack.exe"), so please,
TAKE CARE.

Remember:
We are cool but we don't need newbies or pretentious people.
