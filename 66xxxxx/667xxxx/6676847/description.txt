"Pilot"

Determined not to compromise her career or 
cool reputation to the cliches of 
motherhood, Reagan Brinkley (Christina 
Applegate) adjusts to life with a baby and 
returns to work with the support of her 
stay-at-home husband, Chris (Will Arnett). 
As if motherhood weren't enough, as a talk-
show executive producer, Reagan must also 
tend to the endless needs of her friend and 
boss Ava (Maya Rudolph), an ambitious but 
vulnerable talk-show host.

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
