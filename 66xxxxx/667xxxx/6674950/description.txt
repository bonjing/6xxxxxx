In 1990, childhood friends Scott (bass), Louis (guitar), and Cregg (vocals/guitar) initially formed the aggressive rock sound they would create in the band Boy Hits Car three years later. Singing of typical teenage trials and tribulations, Boy Hits Car inked a deal to independently release My Animal in 1998. They were now firmly planted in Los Angeles, but opted for another record deal and signed with Wind-Up Entertainment in early 2000. Dates with the punk rock-oriented Sno-Core tour followed and the self-titled album was issued in early 2001.  2011 saw the released of Stealing Fire on the Swell Creek label.
