Is there a small fat chance we'll see the dvd9 uncut version arising the surface here @ tpb in the near future ?

That which is crap to you may be golden for us !

,ndx689-,2011-09-14T22:25Z,"A truly enjoyable movie!

thanks for the upload."
,ScratchIT,2011-09-18T14:30Z,"Totaly agree with DumStick. Please leave the movies Untouched in future as DVD9. The more you delete, the less will DL your torrent wich mean you will get less Seeders. ThankÂ´s anyway.

What you call ""crap"" is the best part to other people."
