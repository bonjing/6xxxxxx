,grabberone,2011-09-13T20:13Z,1 People with problem ? :D
,ijoer,2011-11-07T01:14Z,Norton Antivirus went off right away on this one. Said it was spyware...
,ArtemisFx,2012-01-23T17:07Z,"Lol you guys are dumb. Norton will say almost every kind of file like this has a virus. Pretty much the same with bit defender. Also, if one set of keys doesn't work from the keygen, doesn't mean it doesn't work. It just means you need to keep trying.  Thanks for the torrent gabberone"
,mudyfuka,2012-02-14T10:15Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent, its worked for me, it's installing as I write this comment... btw your antivirus will tell you its spyware as its reading files from your system so that it can do its job..."

,Deferium,2012-04-12T02:21Z,"Someone help me? :P
When I open up the demo, the ""Enter code"" button isn't activated.
Any ideas?

Other than that, Norton says its a virus, but it isn't."
