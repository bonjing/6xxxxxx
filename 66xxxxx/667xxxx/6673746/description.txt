Since its creation, NASA has steadily advanced flight within the atmosphere, repeatedly influencing aviation's evolution by extending the rich legacy of its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA. This first volume in a two-volume set includes case studies and essays on NACA-NASA research for contributions such as high-speed wing design, the area rule, rotary-wing aerodynamics research, sonic boom mitigation, hypersonic design, computational fluid dynamics, electronic flight control and environmentally friendly aircraft technology.
