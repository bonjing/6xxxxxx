,Seraph702,2011-09-16T10:31Z,yeah you would use poweriso to mount the .iso in to the virtual drive.
,Seraph702,2011-09-16T10:51Z,"@eleaf1 ignore my other comment, you will need Daemon Tools Lite, and you will be able to mount the .cue file, and it will act as a virtual DVD-ROM. let me know if you need anymore help."
