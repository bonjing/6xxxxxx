,Ragnarous,2012-04-04T15:20Z,"The game runs well (I did not install DX and C++, and did not run the .reg file) but it does not have hi-res (more than 1024x768) menu, it changes the resolution of the game but not of the menu (it makes it smaller). The menu is when you start the game (New game, continue, options, extras, exit game etc.) and ingame when you hit the ESC key. Maybe it is just me, maybe it's the torrent. Who cares when I can play!"
