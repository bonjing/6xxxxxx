This is the .JAR for Minecraft 1.8 PreRelease2 released today the 13th of September.
Keep in mind that this is NOT cracked in any way.
Im just uploading this for people that want to test the PreRelease2.

Place the file in %appdata% &gt; .minecraft &gt; bin

The file has allready been patched for HD Textures,
so your texturepacks will work from default.

Enjoy!
