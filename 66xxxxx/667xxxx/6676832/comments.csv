,HoboNoah,2011-10-16T19:09Z,"I am having a bit of trouble getting Stronghold Legends to work though.  In most cases it simply crashes when I try to open it, but when it does open, I try to open the tutorial game, and it usually either crashes or stays on the loading screen (but doesn't show a loading bar or really signal that it's loading)."
,turismo444,2011-10-20T14:39Z,is it german too? or is this just an english version?
,Krack1337,2011-10-21T04:49Z,"@HoboNoah  Not sure whats wrong with it, maybe something happen during install? If you can't get it to work I can always upload Legends by itself. Do the other games work okay?

@turismo444 Im not sure if it is in German, I got it strait from the disk so if other languages are on there then it should be there."

,Trinh89,2011-12-04T05:49Z,I just downloaded this and it will only let me open it with power2go. Do I have to burn this to a disc before being able to install it ??
