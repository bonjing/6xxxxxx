2. The subtitles are machine translated, and re-timed by shinostarr.

You should atleast give props to the people that put in the effort so you can make your encodes...

This is not a proper BRRip, and it does not contain proper subtitles, it's always nice to know when things aren't as they appear."

Sub translation is  bad but not an issue.
I really like this movie.  Good job Tiltswitch :)"
,tiltswitch,2011-09-19T12:24Z,"your r correct this is indeed a hd version and i didnt change my template to accomodate this,unfortunately tpb edit function is disabled

...as for giving PROPS if i was indeed upping a movie  entirely without changing anything then i would...but as i encode this smaller and change color,bright contrast ,subs,audio etc i make it all my own...

there are very very few unique uploaders and all use sources from other uploaders."
,QborT,2011-09-25T17:30Z,"There is a Proper Bluray source out now.  Skip this.

I find it amusing that you claim that you changed the subs, the subs are machine translated you didn't do shit. LuLz."
,tiltswitch,2011-09-26T16:26Z,"not changed subs u fool...sourced different ones,if u know nothing about the job of an encoder dont chat like u do "

Thanks for another great torrent tilt."
