When you upload the torrent is there any set times? I'm forever logging in to see when the next updates are. If I can get an idea as to when to expect it I'll log in then.

Thanks again for this great community service that you provide."

I wish I could tell you exactly when I have the time to upload...some days I work until late, other days I get home early, then many days I have to help my children with their homework, and so on... So I can only say, it's always more likely to find new episodes from me from 4-9 PM (GMT) than earlier, but some days I'm so exhausted I post them later, as many of you have noticed.

Anyway, thanks for being there!!!"
