,themestrubater,2011-10-11T20:07Z,after installing and I play it I have no picture but no sound what should I do??
,LoudLon,2011-10-26T20:26Z,"I've ran the installer twice, each time following the install instructions precisely, yet there is no sign of the game having been installed anywhere on my PC.  No deadislandgame.exe , no Dead Island folder, nothing.  It's like I just installed nothing -- twice.

What gives?"
,tanyanadine,2011-11-04T00:21Z,"ok, consider me a noob but.....
once this is installed, it runs great, but; i need to uninstall temporarily to run another game...but this game does NOT show up in the uninstall listing....
so the question is, how do you uninstall this game when there is nothing listed in the uninstall and in the game file there is no uninstall exe. HELP!!!! :)"
,intobearzz,2011-11-05T22:23Z,ohhhh man! hate to say it! this game is shady! it was trying to take over my ADMIN n sucked up all my 3.5 g of memory in the total time of almost an hr taking over my PC. thank goodness i had a great program to reverse the process. now i have downloaded this game from others n most of them dont work. BUTT! this 1 is dangerous! HEADS UP!
