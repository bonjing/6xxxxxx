,Dioze,2012-04-14T21:45Z,Man could you tell me why the audio isnt working? :S
,ht0fff,2012-04-20T06:38Z,I solved the audio mystery. The Matroska container is damaged. Solution: ffmpeg -i damaged.mkv -vcodec copy -acodec ac3 -ab 192k -scodec copy new.mkv
,phga,2012-05-07T17:42Z,Audio isnt working for me either... for seasons 6 to 9... the rest are fine. How can I fix this?
