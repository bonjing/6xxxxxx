,DJBigal,2011-09-15T16:34Z,Always the same 128 kbps stuff ... Can anyone upload a real 320 kbps PLEASE ?!?!
,njournal,2011-09-15T17:17Z,"DJBigal - The real 320 b/s is non-existent! The leaked mp3's were @ 192 b/s, so until the album is out - this is the only you can get!"
,DJBigal,2011-09-15T18:01Z,So why do they write 320 kbps in their prez ... and even the 192 kbps one is at 128 kbps ... I checked it !
,RisingPhoenix-Me,2011-09-20T13:18Z,It's not released yet! How did you get your hands on these Songs?
,Unit431,2011-09-25T04:42Z,"Wow, I'm a fan of Evanescence's music but damn, this album sucks. None of the songs really stand out as they did in previous albums, and the overall tone is much lighter as well. Meh."
,Stormeah,2011-09-27T03:01Z,"I agree with Unit431. They had over 4 years to work on this album, this is really disappointing."
,bil_gr7,2011-10-01T16:34Z,Evanescence are just not evanescence without Ben Moody.
