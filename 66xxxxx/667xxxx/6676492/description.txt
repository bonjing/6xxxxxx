same tips like previous torrent about.
install offline anyway.
tested and working fine,indeed.
beware as it is again a new beta version but
should be stable enough anyway.

note : you may get possible slow download by the fact i am
currently seeding a new big torrent with a lot of peers.
And i still continue to seed other torrents at the same time as well.
Be patient,i will make my best to assist you during your download,
but a possible network congestion might taking part for this new one.
Anyway i truly apologize for this possible inconvenient.
Ty for understanding
