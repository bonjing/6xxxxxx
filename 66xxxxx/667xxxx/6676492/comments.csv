Well bro,at first :
did you uninstall your previous version ?
did you make a clean uninstallation ?
Did you make a reset of your old key by regedit.exe as
well as its complete folder ?
don't forget to disable then uncheck : case saying :
check automaticaly new update.
disable online database support as well or your ip will be easily discovered by online SlySoft server checker.
Retry a complete clean uninstall,reboot and go offline !
stay disconnected and install the normal trial version.At the end of its installation,close completely anyDVD and be sure it is deactivated.
exiting its icon from your task bar as well.
Now,place RES patch in SlySoft folder and patch now !
after what,all must and should done and ok .
GL dude
let me know if it will fail again or not.
