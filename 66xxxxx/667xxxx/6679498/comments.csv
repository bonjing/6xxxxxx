,selleri999,2011-09-17T12:14Z,"Patch contains Malware ""Gen:Heur.MSIL.Krypt.2"""
[V],Slickinator,2011-09-17T16:33Z,it does not so please stop lying gee's some people
[V],Slickinator,2011-09-17T16:38Z,those are all false positives and have been confirmed by others ...... hence even the name gen = generic as thats all they do is put a name too something ..........  they are doing this too try and stop pyracy ...... most patches and keygens will have a false positive ..... just so u know its all safe
,serpentpan,2011-09-17T21:58Z,"There are not viruses or malware in patches.They are all false positives.You must disconnect from net and disable antivirus,install and enable anti virus and put exception to this if the antivirus remains...All upps of Slickinator that I used ,they was clean."

,jabe421,2011-09-19T02:32Z,"I found that this has a horrible virus that takes my DVD's, rips them, then copies them to a DVD-R. If you donât want this to happen donât download this torrent. What's this world coming to? Thanks Slickinator ;)"

,Wawelet,2011-09-19T13:45Z,"Thanks for the great job,Slickinator.
Passkey works flawlessly.I just have 2 questions about this release:
since it's a single .exe,does the ""Installation info"" still apply ? What does ""or do the patch same spot"" mean ?"
,bikerbish,2011-09-19T15:45Z,"Just saying hello, and thanks Mr Slick

:=)"
,remoray,2011-09-20T00:42Z,Works like a charm. Thank you!
[V],Slickinator,2011-09-20T07:35Z,patch in same spot mean u can use the crack dll file i included OR use the patch in the same spot where you would copy over the crack dll file too basicly u patch the dll in the main directory or copy over the pre cracked dll file over and copy over other dll file .... lol if u can understand my gibberish lol  ..........and  hi again bikerbish xo
,Wawelet,2011-09-22T15:33Z,"I was confused by the two patching ways you offered.But everything is now clear.Awesome job,Slickinator."
