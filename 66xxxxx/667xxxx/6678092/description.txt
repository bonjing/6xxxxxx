Grateful Dead - Road Trips - Vol 4 No 4

A full show from 4/6/1982 at The Spectrum in Philadelphia, PA, with filler from 4/5 at the same venue.

I decided to leave this as I found it instead of organzing the files into either CD or concert date folders. There weren't any covers or scans of the booklets, etc. 

Files are MP3 @ 320kbps

PLEASE SEED! In a few days I'll be gone for a while, so please keep this one around for a while.
