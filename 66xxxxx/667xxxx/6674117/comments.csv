,maddo277,2011-10-23T05:18Z,"how you put on usb sick ok here we go step one 

1 theres to ways you can do it get power iso mount the iso to a temp drive or you can burn to iso disk 
with power iso and do the following 

one open up cmd 
type in disk part 
then once loaded type list disk 
will come up with all hdds on your computer depending on wot your usb drive is (8gb or 20 ect so say its disk 1 for example
then form there you would do this 
SELECT DISK 1
CLEAN
CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY
SELECT PARTITION 1
ACTIVE
FORMAT FS=NTFS
(Format process may take few seconds)
ASSIGN
EXIT
(YOUR NOT DONE YET ONCE YOU GOT TO THIS STEP THEN TYPE THIS)

Next insert your Windows 8 DVD into the optical drive and check the drive letter of the DVD drive. In this guide I will assume that your DVD drive letter is â€œDâ€ and USB drive letter is â€œHâ€ (open my computer to know about it).
6. Maximize the minimized Command Prompt in the 4th step.Type  the following command now:
D: CD BOOT and hit enter.Where â€œDâ€ is your DVD drive letter.
CD BOOT and hit enter to see the below message.
7. Type another command given below to update the USB drive with BOOTMGR compatible code.
BOOTSECT.EXE /NT60 H: 

ONCE YOU DONE THAT YOU SHOULD GET A MESSAGE ON CMD SAYING YOU DONE IT CORRECTLY THEN FORM THERE YOU JUST COPY YOUR WINDOWS 8 CONTENCE FORM THE DISK TO USB DRIVE DONE :) PUT IN COMPUTER IF IT DONT LOAD FORM USB FIRST TIME GO TO BIOS WITCH CAN BE LOCATED AT START UP PUSH DEL F2 F10 THINK THATS IT ONE OF THEM IF NOT LOOK AT THE BOTTEM OF YOUR SCREEN WHEN LOADING SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT TO PUSH TO ENTER SETUP GO TO BOOT OPTION ONCE IN SETUP AND USE USB AT FIRST BOOT DEVICE RESTART SHOULD BOOT INTO WINDOWS 8 ENJOY :)  "
