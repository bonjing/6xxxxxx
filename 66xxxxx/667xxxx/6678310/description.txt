[/b][/color] Simon Cowell and NBC are scouring the country in search of the most talented person in America.
 Nick Cannon is the host.
Piers Morgan, Sharon Osbourne, and Howie Mandel are judges.

In this show, people show their talent and hope to impress the judges to reach to the top.
The grand prize winner will win $1,000,000! The show will feature talent from various people from balancing stuff off their teeth to even rock bands.
If they don't have the talent to receive the grand prize, the judges kick them out off the competition.
However, unless they impress to judges, they continue their quest.
Who has the talent to receive the grand prize?
