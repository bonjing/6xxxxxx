[S],velvet.,2011-09-21T17:52Z,"@Phuque2:

Stop posting abusive comments on other people's torrents.
I have deleted all of your comments."
[T],nobody2007,2011-09-23T11:40Z,"@ velvet. thank you for cleaning. Unfortunately, there are tons of such comments here on piratebay.

The most bad comments are from people who never uploaded any torrents."
,Phuque2,2011-09-30T22:50Z,nobody2007 maybe there wouldn't be so many negative comments if TBP would stop giving idiots skulls. Dupes and torrents with poor descriptions make TBP look bad from skull users. At least Demonoid nukes dupes which is more than I can say for TBP.
,theanimaster,2011-11-16T16:39Z,"Question: What is CODEBOX and WHY does the Mac Appstore keep bugging me it needs to be updated WHEN I'VE GOT THIS GAME INSTALLED?? 

And when I try to update it, it's linked to a certain heinisf@me.com's account. I dunno, but I hope Mr. Heini isn't trying to hack into my mac through Codebox... 

It's a shit game anyways, so I decided hey -- if I won't buy it, I'm not gonna risk it having a trojan. Thanks for reasserting my position on buying only genuine apps. These 'free' apps remain and always will -- a 'try before U buy' thing for me. "
,Sexwulf,2012-04-09T10:26Z,"I am running Mac Lion 10.7.2

I've downloaded the game, when  I to open it it keeps bouncing on my dock, any help?"
,slanx,2012-04-10T05:03Z,Heini whomever was the person fortunate enough to have uploaded this file for you originally. Codebox resides within the package and thus cannot be found via a spotlight search. It is not a hack it is only residual files...game movement blows and it seems catered to 6-10 year olds. Thanks for the up.
,HellfireArrow,2012-06-03T07:30Z,"@Sexwulf It's supposed to be like that. It WILL take a good 3 minutes (or at least for me) to open it for the first time. Nevertheless, works great and a worthy seed :D"
