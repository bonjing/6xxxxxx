  Stage Four sees The Tour of Britain return to Wales, for a testing    
  route that looks likely to be one of the toughest tests of the 2011   
  route.                                                                
                                                                        
  Beginning in the heart of Mid-Wales at the National Trusts Powis     
  Castle, on the outskirts of Welshpool, the neutralised start to the   
  day will take riders away from the spectacular backdrop of the        
  castle and through the centre of Welshpool, before heading out to     
  Leighton and the official start.
