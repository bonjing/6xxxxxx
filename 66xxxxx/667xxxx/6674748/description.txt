The Roadhouse Jukes came about from a friendship I have had for over 30 years. We have played together for a very long time and decided it was time to make our own music. The writing, arranging, rehearsing and recording of this CD took about 2 years. There is a lot of other material that didn't make it onto the album. ~ C.J. Otis
