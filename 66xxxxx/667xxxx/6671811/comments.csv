,MistryWho,2012-01-06T17:35Z,"well, the quality's great, and really good 3D. Plays perfectly fine on my PC but my LG LW6500 is saying unsupported audio. I dont think LG supports DTS audio."

,KinPlayful,2012-01-29T15:59Z,"I just bought the 55"" LG 3D Cinema TV, how did you convert the Side By Side to play? Did you use a programme for it or an external box? I have been reading up and am a little confused, could do with some help. Thanks :oS"
,Kitteeee,2012-02-04T14:58Z,"hey just so u know, I have an lg 3d smart tv, and we usually just put movies on a usb stick and play it through the tv, but the tv doesn't support dts :S, so when we have dts audio, we use the usb through our LG 3d bluray player and it works.
To KinPlayful:, go into your tv menu and select 3d, then it offers you a selection, chose the image that shows ""side by side"", I hope that is what you were asking for?"
