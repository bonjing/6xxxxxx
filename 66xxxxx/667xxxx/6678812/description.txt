A brand new adventure from The Wiggles, and this time they are singing all of your favourite nursery rhymes... in their very special 'wiggly' way!

Generations of children have delighted in the magic of nursery rhymes and the special moments they share with those who sing them. Who can forget 'This Old Man', 'Hickory Dickory Dock' and 'The Farmer In The Dell'? Surprisingly, many of today's children have not heard of them. Well that's about to change as the fab four of fun, Sam, Murray, Anthony and Jeff have recorded some of their favourite nursery rhymes This DVD is sure to delight a new generation of children.

Another first is that The Wiggles will change out of their coloured skivvies to sing all their favourite nursery rhymes dressed up as the characters they are singing about. Children will be delighted to see Anthony as the pussy cat who visited the queen, Jeff being the cow who jumped over the moon, Sam as gallant prince, Murray as a rock star and Captain Feathersword as a turtle! Another big surprise is The Wiggles as old men - in This Old Man - it's a fun packed DVD to entertain the whole family.
