,lovecat66,2012-05-16T21:07Z,"I don't wanna break any Big Steven Seagal fan's heart, ( I am also one ) but this movie is really sucks...Bad story, boring scenes, not even the nice pussies can provide this film a Big Time...This is nothing else like deep disappointment, cannot measure on the same page to his late movies Pistol Whipped,Kill Switch,The Keeper or classies like On Deadly Ground, Fire Down Below..."
,lovecat66,2012-05-16T21:08Z,"Star of envy : definitely NOT. What you ask is another series of Steven Seagal called ""LAWMAN""."
