This is a comp from a East Coast Empire Records a few years back, Its got some great bands on it along with an early version of a Hatebreed tune that I honestly have not seen on here in any discography. Its got some killer 90s hardcore bands and a few bands like Darkest Hour who are now doing pretty well... 
The Rap Remix of Fury of Fives Classic Want it all Features the Lead Singer of E-town Concrete as Well.. Overall this is a great comp for any True Hardcore Lover.
