,micwood49,2011-09-14T21:21Z,Was wondering if this has Subs for the German parts and sound is out of sync on others I have downloaded?
,Moocheet,2011-09-14T22:50Z,"found this written by the encoder

Reason for the readnfo...........Im no damn syncer plain and simple as that but i cut this up into 6 parts and synced it the best i could.
You may see some oos now and again but ive included a sample so you can decide.2nd half is synced pretty good probs cos the kids had gone out ..Thanks mem for getting some audio out

Video itself isnt great now and again it has a wave/scroll colours are abit off but i increased saturation ,changed rgb , did a slight smoother then altered the levels
then a touch down on contrast

Previous release tagged as TS its cam hence the cam tag on this

Enjoy"

Thanks."
