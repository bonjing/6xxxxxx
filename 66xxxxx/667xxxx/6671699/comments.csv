,biliev1,2011-09-27T17:55Z,"Can people actually comment on the quality of the torrent?  As opposed to making requests like, 'please upload this or that'.  Christ, it's like dealing with a bunch of fucking children.  "

,guerrillapirate,2011-11-29T08:14Z,"I don't get the point behind making a 700 mb BRRip of a movie that is this long. I thought the whole idea behind converting a movie down to around 700 MB was to be able to fit it on one CD-R, which is not possible cause of the run time. 

Not complaining though, makes for a speedy download when you're on the go."
,michaelrwatson,2011-12-30T10:47Z,"@guerrillapirate: you are correct that the point of encoding something at (or just under) 700MB is to fit on a CD. But this is somewhat *over* at 748MB, though it could have been 700MB if the ripper knew what he was doing. In any event, the smaller the file, the faster the download. 700MB is usually a good all-around compromise, but this is an unusually long movie. "
