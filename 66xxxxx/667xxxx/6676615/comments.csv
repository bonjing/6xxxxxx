,TheobaldDancelot,2011-09-17T01:55Z,"thanks for this..really enjoyed it

quality is not great..if it is a dvdrip

audio 9
video 7

film 8

but i thought the films was excellent..usually hate all the useless horror stuff..but this is different.. well planned and great atmosphere.. even if it is aimed at slightly younger audience.. its a very original film. really enjoyed it"
