On first examination it appeared there were only 28, with four episodes being duplicates.  As it turned out, though, some of the eps were misnumbered.  After going to sobreelpucho.com and comparing screenshots of each episode to what I had, I discovered only one (episode 48) was a true duplicate, and there was a Spanish dubbed version of episode 60.  So in all there are either 30 or 31 eps on these DVDs, depending on your perspective."
,wgtetz,2011-12-11T05:52Z,"CAVEAT EMPTOR - Someone on ioffer.com is selling another 8 DVD set as having ""over 40 episodes"".  On a chance I bought it, hoping to have more to share with you.  All it has is the episodes in this torrent, some grabs from YouTube, the pilot episode which you can download in original quality from aerobicise.com and episode 52 with Holly - which is not great and can also be downloaded in decent quality from YouTube.  In other words, you're better off downloading this stuff here and at the other sites for free than paying good money to pirates who profit without permission or royalty from others' work."
