Caution is adviced by me !?!"
,Viper23rd,2011-09-14T12:13Z,"@SuperFly2000

False positive. Don't worry about it."
,SuperFly2000,2011-09-14T12:35Z,"I ran the keygen in a virtual machine and so far it doesn't seem to do any harm. It just generates a key.

Microsoft's website also seems to indicate this is just a general/generic warning, probably produced by a generic packer.

So it could be a false alarm. So far I think the keygen is ok/safe."
,supanut2000,2011-09-14T13:10Z,WTF IS THIS...A TOTAL VIRUS! MSE CLASSED IT AS SEVERE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS! USE THE EXISTING V7 KEYGEN TO ACTIVATE; SHOULD STILL WORK!

"
,phrozenstare,2011-09-14T19:02Z,"thanks. i already downloaded this from the vmware website so all i needed was the keygen but had no problems with the keyen. using NOD32 4 and it did not report any viruses

and they keygen worked in registering this version sucessfully"
,wakintoch,2011-09-14T22:47Z,THX FOR THIS WORKS GREAT !! and the new interface is cool too !! 
,coleix,2011-09-15T03:22Z,"Thx, needed this for windows 8, lol."
,JPeterson,2011-09-15T04:04Z,"windows.iso is missing from the installation. impossible to install vmware tools in windows guests. ""could not find component on update server. contact vmware support or your system administrator."""
,fhffan,2011-09-15T04:57Z,"FYI, Microsoft Security Essentials (and most other desktop anti-virus programs) almost always flag keygens as viruses because of the way keygens work. 99% of the time, these are false positives."
,axeinc,2011-09-15T08:32Z,"Fine upload and NO virus detected by Norton, TrendMicro, Kasp.

Great work dude."
,JPeterson,2011-09-15T09:03Z,"ok. I get it now, tools-windows-8.8.0.exe fails with ""Error -4, while reading from C:\...\tools-windows-8.8.0.exe"". in theory you should obtain the iso from
setup.exe /e tmp
tools-windows-8.8.0.exe /e tmp
but if that fails you don't get any windows.iso."
,cofd,2011-09-15T13:08Z,"Use this link download vmware windows tools.
ver 8.6
http://packages.vmware.com/tools/esx/latest/index.html

Not 8.8, but it work and wait vmware fix that."
,JPeterson,2011-09-15T13:59Z,"Now I found the problem. No one nuked this release! The included installer is corrupted!
setup.exe has crc32 EC49F475, should have
12698A2D as VMware-workstation-full-8.0.0-471780.exe

the result is that you get a corrupted tools-windows-8.8.0.exe
bad A4945D04
good D755115B

I won't blame zwt without knowing more, it could be that vmware put out a bad installer at first."
,marko_23,2011-09-15T14:14Z,what does it do?
,JPeterson,2011-09-15T14:44Z,"I checked the original release from zwt now, to check if it's just this unrar that's botched. It has the same bad crc EC49F475, zwt screwed up with this one. Unless vmware has corrected the installer since the one zwt obtained."
,1TWISTED,2011-09-15T15:08Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,piratekitty,2011-09-15T17:30Z,"Used this keygen with the legit DL from VMware.

Had same problem with upgrading Tools but after restarting each VM after opening once in VM 8...was able to upgrade Tools w/o problem.

THX."

,AtlasPSX,2011-09-15T22:00Z,THANK YOU CYCLOPS! I can't get the damn keygen to work. I really appreciate the serials! 
,jg4545,2011-09-15T23:28Z,"Hi,
I downloaded VMware workstation 64 bit from VMware website but after entering countless serials and using the keygen I can't see whether the program accepted the key. When I look at the license information I don't see that I'm registed all I see is that the licence does not expire but that's the same as it was before the serial was inputted.
Any help would be appreciated."
,GodDamnedTrollz,2011-09-18T02:27Z,@ all you idiots: What could u noobs being all drama about a keygen(by the way any chicken chit moron obsessed about any alert by their crap anti IQ virus program shouldn't be in a p2p site to begin with just go to the developers site and pay for the dammed thing) reporting as a virus be testing in a virtual environment is really beyond me. 
,supanut2000,2011-09-18T11:22Z,"@GodDamnedTrollz
Well you can't call antivirus software crap, it's just that it's a false positive. MSE is the best antivirus IMO, but it's strange that it flagged the keygen as a 'severe' virus. Maybe it's to do with the packer, I don't know."
,ancistis,2011-09-18T15:48Z,Anyone having osx guest unlocker for vmware workstation 8?
,S.V.,2011-09-19T05:17Z,I need the patch to run OS X Lion in VMware 8...Anyone have a link to this?
,SuperFly2000,2011-09-20T02:41Z,"@GodDamnedTrollz: 

LOL, You really fun dude, calm down ! :P

It's smart to test the keygen in a virtual environment when in doubt.

If it was a trojan and it would immediatly strike, then this would become apperent in the virtual environment and only destroy the virtual environment.

The real environment would still be safe. Though losing virtual environments is also just as bad.

In this case I thought it was warranted since Microsoft flagged it as ""severe"". Having seen small little programs do massive ammounts of damage a small little file like this keygen could do massive damage ! Are you aware of that ?! ;) You seem a bit of a noob there yourself ! ;)"
,cancon1,2011-09-20T23:43Z,"I use MSE and the keygen came up as a ""HackTool"" (which is what it is) with ""medium"" alert level.  Not sure why others are claiming that MSE reports a trojan with ""severe"" alert level."
