Cypherpunkd EP010: The Black and Yellow Pages - Brock Lorber

The â€œBlack and Yellow Pagesâ€ project is geared toward hooking up people for agorist trade. Brock Lorber is an aviation consultant and trainer from Las Vegas, a columnist for Freedomâ€™s Phoenix (freedomsphoenix.com), and a coder. We talk about this directory system, its features for reputation and referrals. How current â€œCertification Authoritiesâ€ and EBay like ratings systems are full of Fail. What this system does to address these issues. We cover some basis on PGP Web of Trust models. Trust metrics and reputation ratings. The project goals, its codebase, current state and plans and other good stuff.
