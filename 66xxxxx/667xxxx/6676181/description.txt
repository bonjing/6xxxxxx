   In the high-octane, unorthodox romance I Hate But Love (Nikui       
   anchikusho), a celebrity (played by megastar Yujiro Ishihara),      
   dissatisfied with his personal and professional lives, impulsively  
   leaves fast-paced Tokyo to deliver a much-needed jeep to a remote   
   village. When his controlling manager, the woman he loves (Ruriko   
   Asaoka), follows, the two must reconcile while dodging reporters.
