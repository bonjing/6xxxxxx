,azmoth2,2011-09-17T14:39Z,"Another great release!  LuxLOL the reasson I mentioned moviemaker was because the newer 'Live Movie Maker' is only for platforms Vista/Win 7. 
The older and very useful moviemaker for xp was only around 11mb install as external download but now not available fom microsoft unless you install sp3. If it makes your final exe too big then you must leave it out understandibly, but it is small,  so any chance of leaving it in next release? Thankyou."
,lhondros,2011-09-17T22:56Z,This is a great release. And thank you rjay.gomez for ESET
,LuxLOL,2011-09-18T03:08Z,"Looks like Microsoft removed the Windows XP version from there website but you can still find it in google
http://www.free-codecs.com/Windows_Movie_Maker_download.htm

I would use VideoSpin over Windows Movie Maker it's free too but better. And if you want to go Pro i would ues CyberLink PowerDirector :-)"
,azmoth2,2011-09-18T13:08Z,"LuxLOL, Ive just tried installing this release on a toshiba 64 bit satellıte pro whıch is also compatible with xp 32 bit hardwarewise , the last release of xp black installed supremely fine, however this one throws  up messages: glmf32.dll missing, retry, it copies and then iereset.inf missing retry, it copies but then finally fails with netcis.inf.  never had this problem before? bafffling !!!!"
,T3ZTAM3NT,2011-09-18T14:32Z,MS Office is removed?
,LuxLOL,2011-09-18T17:30Z,This is because the Optical Disc Reader or Bruner lasser is brocken or dirty. Try clean the Optical Disc drives.
,LuxLOL,2011-09-18T17:32Z,MS Office was never included by Microsoft in any Windows. You see in the readme files what is removed.
,azmoth2,2011-09-18T21:14Z,"Burnt this xp black version with another cd-r maxwell and it works fine now, isolated problem which strangely was TK cd-r disc that worked oay on my other pc's. I thought bios problems, so it pays to try out other cd burning material, if you encounter install problems s your dvd drive may be causing it and my need other type of  cd. Thanks LuxLOL for link to moviemaker."

,xk3nvel0x,2011-09-21T18:32Z,"Hi LuxLOL,

I have a question, i have a pc with intel core i3 and 4 GB ram can i use this version 32 bit for 4GB of RAM ? or max is 3,5 GB ?"
,LuxLOL,2011-09-21T19:11Z,"You can use it but you will have only 3.5GB or 3GB RAM depending on how much RAM you graphic has.
32-bit OS can only support max 4GB RAMs all together."
,Fr33Soul,2011-09-21T19:40Z,"great version mate,running like a charm and installed without any problem.


thanks a bunch"
,xk3nvel0x,2011-09-22T13:35Z,"@ LuxLOL

Thanks very much for your support, i will seed as long as i can, great torrent."
,rsk4you,2011-09-23T19:11Z,"Thanks mate,
As usual, this version rocks.
The highlight is Virtual Clone Drive,,
May I expect CCleaner, Utorrent, 
These are now standards in most of the PCs.
LuxLOL, how about consider this..."
,jcminst,2011-09-26T00:05Z,Only Problem I have is when its done installing the windows security center doesnt work
,LuxLOL,2011-09-26T02:51Z,It doesn't work because i was removed windows security center sounds cool but it is useless and annoying. ;)
,LuxLOL,2011-09-26T07:15Z,"@myarmyofnone
The driver pack team has not SATA driver pack fro 64-bit XP so i can't make a 64-bit version."
,jcminst,2011-09-27T14:45Z,Is there a way for me to get it cause i want it to manage my security and tell me something wrong.
,Zyscript,2011-09-28T01:31Z,"just a question, can i boot this in my usb?"
,LuxLOL,2011-09-28T05:10Z,"@jcminst
So you need a tool that tells you that you have no FW or AV installed really?
You probably also don't know that every virus today can bypass the standart Windows FW without a problem. If i could remove the standart Windows FW without causing system problems i would do it too.

@Zyscript
Google to find a tutorial on how to do this with Windows XP."
,pr3nux,2011-09-29T11:21Z,I installed this onto my computer and now I have No audio whatsoever. I have Googled my ass off looking for drivers but cannot seem o find them. I ran Belarc Advisor and cant seem to pull up any audio devices even though its built right into the mother board (i have no audio card outside the motherboard). I have a Intel Corporation D946GZIS AAD83227-402
,pr3nux,2011-09-29T11:21Z,Any help would be much appreciated! 
,s0nicfreak,2011-09-29T23:16Z,"Tried to install on non-NTFS hard drive. Deleted partition and created new, but it doesn't give me an NTFS option. The partition is listed as raw. It won't let me install, it just says it isn't WinXP compatible. So I booted back into Ubuntu (on a seprate hard drive) and Ubuntu can't see the harddrive anymore since Windows messed with it! How can I format the hard drive to NTFS??"
,s0nicfreak,2011-09-29T23:30Z,"Uh, I got it formatted to NTFS. I had to go back into the Winxp installer, delete the raw partition, and then Ubuntu's disk manager could see it and I could format it to NFTS. However, the winxp installer is STILL saying it is incompatible with Windows! "
,s0nicfreak,2011-09-29T23:32Z,"I got it formatted to NTFS, but it is still saying the disk is incompatible!"
,s0nicfreak,2011-09-30T00:09Z,"Sorry for the multiposting. But I figured that out too. Turns out I had to unhook all other harddrives. Stupid Windows. 

Anyway, thanks so much for posting this. I have a legit disc of Winxp pro, but it has pretty much no drivers. The usb and dvd drives won't even work right, so IF I wanted to go through the trouble of finding each damn driver and putting them on manually, I wouldn't even be able to. It's pretty fucked up that I have to turn to pirates to get a product that actually works!! Thanks to this I can finally play all the games that won't work in Ubuntu. "

,Jango420,2011-10-04T20:52Z,".. Works when I unplug my headset/mouse and keyboard. Now my problem is that I'm unable to press L since just that key is broken of all the keys.

Why doesn't it work with USB-Keyboard? Works on all the other versions I've tried except this one.

Also, it just said ""Windows XP Professional"". So what do you mean by Black Edition?"
