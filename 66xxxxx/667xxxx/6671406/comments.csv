,tordajav,2011-09-13T20:07Z,Can I ask you what software you use to cut all of the commercials?
,didactic,2011-09-13T20:20Z,thanks tonyissac! does anyone have any tips on where to find the men's final?
,tordajav,2011-09-14T00:06Z,"Cant find men's final, sorry"
,didactic,2011-09-14T02:07Z,"thanks for the reply tordajav. the men's final seems to have just gone up here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6673715/US.Open.2011.Mens.Final.Novak.Djokovic.vs.Rafael.Nadal.720p.HDTV

But I can't tell if it's legit or not and for the moment it's very slow. If you have any thoughts on whether it's worth downloading (at 7 GB!) I'd be much obliged. It seems to be some kind of RAR file or in need of unarchiving anyway. I'm wondering whether it would even be playable in VLC... Thanks again."
