,MorphzreaZ,2011-09-15T16:02Z,well im Dutch but never heard of it... will have a look..thanks Bone
,SuperWurm,2011-09-15T23:07Z,"Hey, Michael Madsen, wasn't that the actor who appeared in the Dutch news because he was kicked out of bars and hotels because of too much drinking or do I confuse him with somebode else?

annyway, I know Amsterdam very well. Like to see it."
,soupcip,2011-09-16T03:04Z,"I am Dutch, but his product makes me ashamed.
It is really really bad. Everything. The dialog....bad as it is, its made worse cos the 99% dutch cast cannot talk decent English. Guess there was no money for a decent language coach. The story S#CKS ass, the acting is lame , the talent is zero , the camera work is just awfull, the fighting is lame as never seen before and the few special effects that are real simple they managed to fuck up. It feels like kids aged 10-12 made this movie. MYGOD worst movie in a long time. Makes the scifi-b flicks look like masterpieces. "
,dfl3506,2011-09-16T03:16Z,I believe Madsen is in the movie for total of 3 minutes.
,fortune96,2011-09-16T14:06Z,I think this movie is for kids
,ashen77,2011-09-16T15:06Z,"soupcip.. agreed, movie is a pile of shit.

A/v is good though. cheers Bone"
,Dexter101,2011-09-16T15:12Z,"HOT SLUTS are just extra scenes to make this film interesting.
just like the others said... the film SUCKS."
,Dyllie13,2011-09-16T22:18Z,"Well the reason why is sucks is that It's made by students.
Eplanation is simple, You are a student, who wants to make movies. There's a festival and your whole school joins it. The ""best"" one there is, will be produced. The poeple are happy, But not the ones who are watching it.
So in one sentence, It's a student movie."
,scottsasse,2011-09-17T00:37Z,"@Dyllie13, Sorry but way NOT true!! I have seen some excellent movies that were made by film students, just search Google or Imdb and you'll likely be surprised. Unfortunately though this is not one of them and it does suck!! Good A/v for the size ......................................THANKS .BONE. for the up!!"
,mrmeade,2011-09-17T10:57Z,"Oh My God, this movie eats shit and sucks balls, i thought Machete was the shitiest acting i had ever seen, this piece of cock weep takes the Oscar, WTF was madsen thinking even getting in the same room as these useless bunch of untalented wasters, its cringe worthy, my dog can act better than these fools, they should go back to their day jobs mopping floors in Aldi"
,SuperWurm,2011-09-21T23:14Z,"What d fucking gangsterasshole licking sluts on a dick!!! The movie sucks like mi ho. Bad acting, bad fighting cheography, terrible camerawork and what the balls licking gay accent do d actors have? Is this a low budget movie? It's supose to be written and directed by Michael Madsen? Is he mad? Did he use too much weed? It sucks!
He was thinking: if Quentin can make something out of pulp, I can make something out of trash?
Well, he made a shitty movie.
Mi god it's like all the crew have no talent and the director was stoned like a parot."
