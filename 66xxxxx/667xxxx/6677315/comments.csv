I saw this course in teach.12 this week and now is already here, thank you.
Without an demonoid account nobody could get these courses, but for our luck there is dohduhdah.
Thank you again for your contribuitions. "
,rododododo,2011-09-15T16:28Z,"This torrent is not at demonoid, how did you get it?"
,rododododo,2011-09-15T16:54Z,"i know that is my third comment, but for now everybody has 0.0%"
,torren456,2011-09-15T17:03Z,Thanks!

[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-15T18:30Z,"rododododo: I used to get TTC torrents from demonoid, but nowadays I get them from bitme (an education-oriented bittorrent site)."
,WinstonSmith84,2011-09-15T19:08Z,Thanks again dohduhdah. You're providing an excellent service to those without a bitme account.
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-15T19:58Z,"Sorry indiaman, no new mathtutorDVD uploads yet at bitme."
,niemanten,2011-09-16T10:11Z,"thanks a lot, dear friend!!!"
,avanced3d,2011-09-18T01:04Z,"Hi dohduhdah, is it okay if I can send you an email asking for an invite for bitme account? The reason I know your email address already is that I have asked you an invite for demonoid successfully a while back then. So I'm just wondering if I can have one for bitme as well."
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-18T01:06Z,avanced3d: sure no problem
,rododododo,2011-09-18T03:59Z,Someone knows where can i find an invitation to bitme.org?
,rododododo,2011-09-18T04:02Z,"avanced3d- just now i saw your post, after you get your invitation, could you please send me one?"
,rododododo,2011-09-18T04:34Z,"avanced3d- ow i forgot that you´ll be new so you won´t have invitations. Sorry to bother, i forgot this detail"
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-18T05:24Z,rododododo: Please send me a private msg at demonoid and I'll send you a bitme invite as well.
,Isozyme,2011-09-18T12:16Z,May I have one?
,Isozyme,2011-09-18T12:16Z,Thanks anyway :D
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-18T13:31Z,"Isozyme: sure, send me a pm at demonoid :-)"
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-18T14:23Z,"Btw, there is an 8 gb version of this ttc video with better quality (the one about the mysteries of the microscopic world). In case anyone is interested, I can also share it here on TPB."
,Isozyme,2011-09-18T14:58Z,"Sorry, I don't have a demonoid account :("
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-18T15:23Z,"isozyme: Ok, please send me a pm at suprbay instead."
,Isozyme,2011-09-18T18:32Z,done.. :)
,rododododo,2011-09-18T23:31Z,i don´t hae an demonoid account so i send to superbay too.
,raenkae,2011-09-20T01:01Z,"dohduhdah: Do you have some invites left for bitme? I happen to have an demonoid account and am very happy with that, but WOW! An education-oriented bittorrent site! I really would love to get an account at that site."
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-20T05:51Z,"Sorry, I ran out of bitme invites. It might take a while before I obtain some new ones."
,raenkae,2011-09-20T13:26Z,"A bit sad about that one, im searching high and low about knowledge and that site may have what im looking for. Thanks anyway. Be sure that I keep my eyes out for invites. I search especially for lecture-notes, course material for electronics, CAD, CAM, materials, languages, control theory, CNC, lean production and so on..

Anyway i would like to have that 8 Gb lecture about the microscopic world. Its always better with better quality."
[V],dohduhdah,2011-09-20T18:49Z,"Don't worry.. a lot of the stuff that's available on bitme tends to show up at other places sooner or later (like demonoid and here at TPB).
It might take a little while for me to start the upload of the 8 gb version."
