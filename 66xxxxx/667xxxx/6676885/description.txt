"Pilot"

Alex (Hank Azaria, "The Simpsons," "The 
Smurfs"), is newly-divorced and trying to hold 
it together at work. His co-worker Helen 
(Kathryn Hahn, "Hung," "Wanderlust") lost her 
fiance a year ago and while she thinks she has 
it together, she's on emotional thin ice. When 
they end up in bed together, the aftermath 
isn't pretty and they decide to remain friends
or so they think. As the two try to sort out 
their casual, intimate and beautifully awkward 
relationship, they are surrounded by an office 
full of crazy colleagues, including their boss 
Stephen (Anthony Head, "Buffy The Vampire 
Slayer," "Merlin"), Dan (Mo Mandel, "Modern 
Family"), Gregg (Al Madrigal, "The Daily 
Show") and Emma (Natasha Leggero, "Ugly 
Americans"), as well as office security guard 
Walter (Joe Lo Truglio, "Backwash").
