,ghandi253,2012-02-11T22:50Z,"Excellent quality. A definite A/10 V/10. Great up, Fredyr. keep it up. And, Ashleynin is right. Comment on the good ups, peeps. And don't forget the +1. Uploaders like Fredyr dont have to do what they do to provide us with quality rips. So, pay it forward."
,ghandi253,2012-02-11T22:55Z,And joethetoe is wrong. There are no subs. If they are then they are encoded. Which means you only need to use a program like ConvertXtoDVD and you can burn video files to a DVD and either remove the subs before burning or just turn them off when you watch the movie your DVD player through the DVD menu that ConvertXtoDVD creates during the conversion process.
