,CakeMonster,2011-09-12T15:56Z,"Whats with the slow seeding

You need to seed to several people at once and not just 1 because there will always be someone who dosent ressed

Make sure your program seeds to atleast 15 people simultaiously"
,artvandelay2007,2011-09-12T16:02Z,"CakeMonster, don't be a fucking douche.
11 people are now seeding so obviously it's propagating well after only an hour.

I'm dedicating all my bandwidth to this torrent. All my other u/l and d/l are paused."
,CakeMonster,2011-09-12T16:34Z,"@artvandelay2007

11 people are not seeding

As I am writing this text, about 2 hours after the torrent was launched everyone is stuck at around 11%

The piratebay tracking system of how many seeders and leechers there are isnt always top notch

And I say again, when seeding a torrent make sure you seed to at least 10 people preferably 15 because there is always 1 guy who wont reseeds and just consumes the whole bandwith"

People are at 100 :)"

THANK YOU!!

Every other release of BrBa is utter shite.

You shine through and bring joy to thousands."
,bowhan333,2011-09-12T19:24Z,worth the wait. thank you!
,sup2010,2011-09-12T19:29Z,thx
,Carillon3,2011-09-12T22:07Z,"Thanxs for seeding.

is there no error in the title ? ""Breaking Bad S04E08 by TeddyBlue"""
,farkstick,2011-09-12T23:01Z,"FUCK YOU to the complainers and haters.  Believe it or not when you try downloading a new episode within an hour of it being posted it's going to be slow until there are more seeders.  Idiot.

FUCK YEAH to TB for another fine release.  Any week I don't have to watch an IMMERSE 720p shit release of Breaking Bad is a good one."
,balanced,2011-09-13T00:44Z,"Good quality and it isn't bundled into a stupid and unnecessary RAR.  Now THIS is how it's done.  And THIS is worth the wait.  (Paying attention, immerse and sceneline?)"
,CakeMonster,2011-09-13T00:49Z,"@farkstick

You need to cool your horses.

The only one hating is you

I just said that the seeder should seed to more people than one person because after 2 hours everyone was stuck at 10%

That you see this as hating is indeed a sign of your own twisted mind :)

And may I point out that after my post things did change

Maybe they would have changed by them self who knows

All I know is that when I posted everyone was at 10% and there was one guy who was at 14 and he didnâ€™t reseed so I, most likely correctly, assumed he was sucking all the bandwidth and because of him there was no movement

So by increasing the numbers of people the original seeder was seeding to that problem was overcome"
,artvandelay2007,2011-09-13T01:20Z,"CakeMonster, don't be so fuckin full of yourself. People besides yourself know how to seed torrents, so quit your whining.

I didn't change a goddamn thing because of what you complained about this morning. I was seeding to the correct number of people-at-a-time this morning. THAT is why you were able to complete the download after only 3 hours.

If I had taken your useless advice, no one would have been at 100% until about 8 or 9 hours into the download.  

Farkstick was 100% A+ in EVERYTHING he said, particularly when he addressed you as ""Idiot""

I'll echo his awesome comment...
FUCK YOU to the complainers
FUCK YOU to IMMERSE
FUCK YEAH to TB!"
,Cthulu500,2011-09-13T04:11Z,Thank you!!
,farkstick,2011-09-13T05:23Z,"CakeMonster, my horses are chilled as fuck.

Holy shit, no one cares that you were stuck at x%, or it took too long, or wasn't seeded the way you like.  Seriously, fuck you.  It's a gig and a half file, and you were bitching roughly an hour after it was posted.

Be thankful someone is actually taking the time to do this the right way, for fuck's sake."
,Skram0,2011-09-13T06:58Z,"Fucking ungrateful bastards. Get something for free, then bitch about it. :/"
,spacelord76,2011-09-13T08:15Z,Always a pleasure! :-) Thanks!
,drion2,2011-09-13T10:19Z,"Kudos to CakeMonster for identifying a problem and constructively proposing a solution. Shame on those who responded to that with insults and vulgarity. Yes, torrents require patience, but if there's a problem let's fix it."
,pibe156,2011-09-13T10:44Z,"Great torrent, great download, great quality!!!

Thanx!"
,Raapzaad,2011-09-13T13:37Z,"I only got two words to say:

Thank You"
,Esmad3,2011-09-13T21:07Z,Ty for this. The only good version around
,madbuttface,2011-09-14T01:08Z,Thanks Cunt :)
,farkstick,2011-09-14T05:43Z,"@drion2

There never was a problem.  That's the point.

PS - Fuck fuckity fuck fuck fuck"
,drion2,2011-09-14T10:53Z,"@farkstick

Then just say he's mistaken. For most people that's not considered an opportunity to launch insults. Yes I know it's the internet and you and others can enjoy anonymity but poor social skills are still plain to see."
,CakeMonster,2011-09-14T12:31Z,"@ farkstick

I was seeing it with my own eyes, 2 hours in and everyone was at 10 %

And one guy was at 14

Obviously the original seeder was only seeding to 1-3 guys who them sleves were not reseeding and that was the whole problem

By increaseing the number of people the original seeder was seeding to, the greed effect could be overcome

And I say again there was a problem

The problem was that there was no movement"
,CakeMonster,2011-09-14T12:47Z,"@drion2

I was NOT mistaken

The problem was that after 2 hours everyone was at 10% one guy was at 14 and there was no movement

It was clear to me that the original seeder was only seeding to 1-3 guys who in turn were not reseeding

By increaseing the number of people the original seeder was seeding to this problem was overcome"

I figured not. You seem to know what you're doing."
