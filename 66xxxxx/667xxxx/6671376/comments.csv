,marquee78,2012-01-03T13:45Z,"@picklator  You're out of your mind...you must be a noob, mkv files are usually the best copies out there, avi sucks, I downloaded this, fired up the first episode and was liek ""wow, this is sure a blurry piece of crap""  then proceeded to download the crystal clear mkv files...nothing against the poster of this torrent, avi files are good for people with limited HD space, and people who don't know how to get the codecs for mkv files

,gompp,2012-04-09T02:20Z,love this
,Vegeta9021,2012-04-14T07:21Z,"@marquee78 wow, you're a noob as well.  MKV is just a container, it does not affect the quality at all.  Some people might prefer avi because of its compatibility.  I know many encoders who prefer avi.  MKV is alright for mostly PC-viewing purposes, otherwise avi and mp4 are better for me.

If you think this avi encode looks bad then it's clearly the encoder's fault or even the source file.  Also, notice the size of this rip.  Anyways, the show>quality.  Only when it's something like Game of Thrones, where quality is a trait of the show, should it matter.  This is just a comedy, I'm sorry if it's too ""blurry"" for you to laugh.  

Lastly, pull that giant dildo out of your ass, and thank the uploader for once.

THANK YOU manOtor, for providing Season 1 of this series."
