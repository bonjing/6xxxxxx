This show at the intimate Palace Theater was a keeper, with the fine acoustics of this old 1931-era venue making the show sound great.  By this point on the tour, the band was hittin' the note with a vengeance!

The setlist highlight that jumps off the page at you is the very first Les Brers In A Minor of 2010, and brothers and sisters, this one is a doozy!  Warren is playing some exceptional melodic leads on this one, and Derek tears the house down as well on his solo, all while the best rhythm section in the business churns out a groove as wide as an 8-lane highway.  Welcome back, Les Brers, we missed you!

First set highlights included the first Come On In My Kitchen of the fall tour, and yet another spectacular Dreams, with Gregg's voice sounding great on both.  Check out the bluesy version of The Sky Is Crying, full of heart and soul and great playing and singing.  Dylan's haunting Blind Willie McTell is really coming into its own as an ABB tune, and this version is another good one.
