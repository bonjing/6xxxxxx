I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

,sarkaras,2011-09-17T07:32Z,Thank u for a great upload. i will be seeding this for a while....have to dig up and listen to my Eat a Peach and Brothers and Sisters albums now
,sarkaras,2011-09-17T07:38Z,"oh, i notice that Butch Trucks and Derek Trucks are playing together on this. Its must be quite unique to have a father and son play together.. "

[V],smbdownload,2011-09-18T15:49Z,well looks like the FLAC snobs are at it with the negative ratings - I personally love FLAC - and use it often - it's an AWESOME format - but the fact of the matter is that most people DO NOT and WILL NOT use the fomat - so why not share in the format that people want - after all if we take the time to start a torrent doesn't it make sense that we have a desire to share this great music with as many people as possible...not just a select 'enlightened few' - then take the care to make them sound as good as you possibly can within the confines of MP3 [which I know I do] - if you don't want MP3's... it's simple... don't download them - there are many other sources for FLAC if that is what you desire....peace
