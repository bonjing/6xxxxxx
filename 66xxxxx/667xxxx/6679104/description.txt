                                      Horror                      
                                                                    
                                                                     
                                                                    
            Man has long ascribed to fate or destiny                 
          the problems he felt powerless to resist,              
                resigning himself to these perceived forces.            
             It is believed that if man commits an act               
              of good or evil, he himself becomes the heir           
               to that action. This is the concept of Karma,           
                derived from the Sanskrit word kri meaning             
               action. In Cape Karma, Manav (Sanskrit for           
             man), played by Rahul Dev, has a strange                
             destiny in store for him. He is a lonely man,          
           perpetually at a crossroad. Willing to play           
            his choices and eager to enjoy his freedom,          
           he is ever ready for one-night stands with          
             strange women, ready for new excitement, ready        
           foranything. And yetlittle does he know that         
            he is a on the edge of a dangerous precipice           
            in life. When his car crashes off the highway,         
            he stumbles out to discover a mysterious door           
              right in the middle of the highway.

         |   DDR brings you another master creation from          
             "Late Mr. Pankaj Advani" after Urf Professor.        
           We have enjoyed a Dark Comedy from him, now           
             its time to peek into a dark horror/thriller         
              from him . Cape Karma proved to be much ahead        
          of its times for an Indian audience and is one        
              of Pankaj's least seen films.Sadly, Mr. Advani       
           passed away last year. DDR pays tribute to the    
             brilliant film-maker, by making his creations      
          available to all of you.
