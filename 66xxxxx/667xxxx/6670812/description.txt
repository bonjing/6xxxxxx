A pair of hot shot ice road truckers vying for some sort of award for most trips agree to haul truckloads of explosives (that take an awfully long time to blow up when the rig catches fire) up to a remote mining site where a prehistoric reptilian monster has just been inadvertently unearthed. A pretty environmentalist happens to need a lift up to the site and rides along with the trucker shes designated to find romance with.
