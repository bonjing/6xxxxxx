,TheTrekhippy,2011-09-14T03:46Z,Agree with Sklyn. I dropped VLC for MPC years ago and never been happier with a software change.
,flurgblurg,2011-09-14T04:17Z,"gave me a lot of crash/restart issues to, using VLC"
,DemosCat,2011-09-14T04:50Z,"There seems to be some issue around the 32 min mark that messes up VLC.

I sometimes use Any Video Converter (AVC) to change the display size for playing a show via SD card in my BD player.  Normally a conversion works without a hitch, but AVC cut the show short at the 32 minute mark.  So whatever the issue is, it effects more than just VLC."
,Ashphamy,2011-09-14T07:12Z,Looking forward to it. But can we seed please? I was expecting something more that double figures for dl speed. Especially something with this many seeds.
