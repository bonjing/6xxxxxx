thanks"

,lordshadows,2011-09-16T06:33Z,For the owner of the Samsung TV. If it has built in wi fi then you need to download Samsung AllShare on your pc. It then allows you to watch the movies you download to your pc on your TV.

,jonmobrien,2011-09-26T10:44Z,"Hi, I am a mkv3d noob, I understand if you have a wifi tv and streaming software it would be handy, but if you can't stream it, do you just put it on a 32GB USB stick (since it is just fractionally larger than 16GB) and plug it into your 3D TV?"
,JOEY3D,2011-09-26T18:03Z,HI JONMOBRIEN YES YOU CAN PUT IT ON A USB STICK AND WATCH IT  OR IF YOUR TV HAS A ETHERNET PORT YOU CAN STREAM IT THAT WAY DONT NEED WIFI IF YOU CAN PLUG YOUR TV INTO YOUR ROUTER HOPE THIS HELPS

,cleverjack,2011-10-20T00:49Z,Audio is really out of sync. It's bad.
,JOEY3D,2011-10-21T23:34Z,to mdruiter and cleverjack this movie is NOT out of sync i have watched it again with the mates and we can not see any part of the film that is out of sync if you are having this problem can i ask that you first check your setup if you are streaming the movie wireless look there i use a eathernet cable pluged into my router and to the tv and have not had any sync problems with any movie i have played this way hope this clears things up for you
,SzWeD,2011-11-17T00:38Z,"Hi JOEY3D. I priviously downloaded your movies and was very happy. to bad this time the dl at 2/9 kB/s  :(, any way, 1 question ;p is there any quality difrence between 7gb 1080p dts 3D movie and an 17gb 1080p dts 3D movie ?"
,JOEY3D,2011-11-17T18:09Z,SZWED YES AS A 3D BLURAY IS ABOUT 4OGB WHEN YOU BUY THEM FROM A SHOP SOME DISKS HAVE EXTRAS ON THEM SO I WOULD SAY 30GB IS FOR THE 3D MOVIE ON THE DISK SO IF YOU CONVERT IT A 7GB THEN YOU LOOSE QUALITY THATS WHY MINE ARE 18GB SO YOU STILL LOOSE QUALITY BUT NOT AS MUCH. NOW IF THE MOVIES ARE 3D THEN THE QUALITY YOU LOOSE IS THE STUFF MENT TO POP OUT YOUR TELLY THATS WHY I TRY TO CONVERT AS CLOSE AS POS TO THE MOVIES SIZE BUT IAM RUNNING OUT OF MEMORY NOW THAT WHY MINE ARE 18GB HOPE THIS HELPS
,SzWeD,2011-11-18T11:08Z,"ohh, so you say that the smaller the size of 3d movie the less 3d it really seems ? the bigger the size the bether are the effects ? more depth, more popouts ? thats really helpfull, thanks. but i got to say that i have a 8gb monsters vs aliens 3d movie and the ping pong effect there really hits my face ;) ill have to download the same movie in 18gb+ and 8gb- to verify this.                       Warm regards JOEY3D and keep up the good work.         To all others.... SEED ;p hehe"
