John Caparulo's first comedy special. It premiered on Comedy Central's Secret Stash on December 21, 2008. The special was released on CD on February 10, 2009 and on DVD on April 14, 2009.

This torrent contains the audio CD in mp3 format and the uncut TV premiere as an avi.

This is the same quality as the 776MB file that's around out there, but I just couldn't stand how that version of the file was encoded, so I decided to tweak it a little, re-encode it, and share it. Here's what I did to it:

- I cropped off two pixels from the top to remove the flickering white line that was there because it drove me insane
- I removed the "Secret Stash" little ditty from the beginning of the video file, because I imagine if you download this, you know what it is, and you're not going to accidentally show it to kids and get offended
- I removed the commercials after the video because I don't like seeing them and because no one reads the credits anyways
- I switched the audio to 128kbps mp3 instead of PCM (uncompressed), which made the filesize almost a third of what it was without any reduction in quality


So that said, just enjoy it;)
