Henry the Octopus is the champion Christmas wrapper, and Dorothy the Dinosaur loves her Christmas roses. Then, celebrate the birth of the Christ Child with special guest, King Mondo.

Itâ€™s time to combine your two favorite things, The Wiggles and Christmas and tap you mistletoes, everyone, because Santaâ€™s Rockinâ€™!
