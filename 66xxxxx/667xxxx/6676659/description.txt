Warren Haynes and members of the extended Govâ€™t Mule family celebrated the life and musical legacy of bassist Allen Woody last night. The Another One for Woody benefit show took place at New Yorkâ€™s Roseland Ballroomâ€”the same venue that hosted the original One for Woody benefit a decade agoâ€”and raised money for music education in public schools. The performance stretched until nearly 2 AM.

The Another One for Woody benefit was divided into three mini-segments that brought together members of the three groups with whom Woody is most regularly associated: The Allman Brothers Band, Govâ€™t Mule and Artimus Pyle Band. Before the eveningâ€™s first segment, Haynes and his longtime friends McCain and Kevn Kinney (Drivinâ€™ N Cryinâ€™) welcomed the audience with acoustic versions of â€œJust Outside Of Heaven (A Good Country Mile),â€ â€œThe Lucky Oneâ€ and â€œI Shall Be Released.â€

Guitarist Luther Dickinson and drummer Codyâ€”who performed under the name the North Mississippi Allstars Duoâ€”hosted the nightâ€™s first set of music. Near the start of the set, Luther Dickinson told the crowd that Govâ€™t Mule took the fledging Allstars out as a duo in 1998 and Woody would play bass with the band each night. The Dickinsons ran through self-described â€œraw and unrehearsedâ€ versions of â€œSitting On Top Of The World,â€ â€œShimmy She Wobble,â€ â€œStation Blues,â€ â€œPreachinâ€™ Bluesâ€ and â€œGlory Gloryâ€ before bringing out Big Sugar guitaristâ€”and recent Govâ€™t Mule producerâ€”Gordie Johnson for â€œPo Black Maddieâ€ and â€œStraight To Hell.â€ The North Mississippi Allstars Duo brought its set to a close by inviting out â€˜70s-era Lynyrd Skynyrd drummer Artimus Pyle, Govâ€™t Mule keyboardist Danny Louis and former Black Crowes guitarist Audley Freed for a set-closing â€œWhiskey Rockin Rollaâ€ (three Black Crowes guitarists participated in the benefit at various points in the night).

Govâ€™t Muleâ€”Woodyâ€™s project at the time of his passingâ€”hosted the second and most personal segment of the evening. Before the band took the stage, Haynesâ€™ longtime guitar technician Brian Farmer placed a â€œMule Crossingâ€ sign on an amplifier near the front of the stage and images culled from throughout Muleâ€™s career were projected behind the group throughout its set. The current incarnation of Govâ€™t Mule opened its performance with takes on â€œRailroad Boy,â€ â€œBlind Man In The Dark,â€ â€œSteppinâ€™ Lightlyâ€ and â€œBanks Of The Deep End.â€ Haynesâ€™ most direct lyrical tribute to Woody took place at the end of â€œBanks,â€ when he stretched out the final â€œlost my best friendâ€ line of the song.

The parade of guests truly started during â€œIâ€™m A Ram,â€ as Johnson returned to the stage with moe. percussionists Jim Loughlin and Vinnie Amico. Haynes remarked that most of the music and musicians featured at the benefit have a â€œshared historyâ€ with the fallen bassist: Govâ€™t Mule shared many early bills with Big Sugar and also with moe. in the late â€˜90s as part of the Summer Sessions tour. After â€œIâ€™m A Ram,â€ moe. guitarist Chuck Garvey replaced Johnson for a take on the Beatlesâ€™ â€œDear Prudence.â€

As the night moved on, the set started to resemble more of an all-star jam than a traditional Mule set. The Dickinson Brothers, Pyle and harmonica player Hook Herreraâ€”who played at the very first Mule showâ€”sat in on â€œ32/20 Blues,â€ while Pyle and Black Crowes guitarist Rich Robinson helped the members of Mule with â€œStay With Me.â€

Next, Haynes, Louis and Mule drummer Matt Abts were joined by Robinson, Pyle and current Lynyrd Skynyrd bassist Robert Kearns for a take on the Crowes hit â€œSometimes Salvationâ€ and after Abts and Robinson left the stage, the Skynyrd standard â€œSimple Man.â€ Haynesâ€”who played with Kearns long before the bassist joined Skynyrdâ€”noted that he had two members of the veteran southern rock onstage, though the bassist joined Lynyrd Skynyrd nearly 18 years after Pyle left the group. The members of Govâ€™t Mule later returned to the stage with Freed for their own â€œWishing Wellâ€

Govâ€™t Muleâ€™s set closed with a deeply personal moment as Woodyâ€™s 13-year-old daughter Savannah Woody took the stage with her fatherâ€™s band for the first time. The younger Woody sang with Govâ€™t Mule and Pyle on Haynesâ€™ signature song â€œSoulshine.â€ Haynes handed Savannah the appropriate â€œthink back to what my daddy saidâ€ and Pyle brought her a tambourine to shake during the songâ€™s breakdown.

After a short break, the Allman Brothers Band took the stage for eveningâ€™s third and final segment. The bandâ€”who already clocked in a busy day that included a press conference on the ABBâ€™s 2011 Beacon Theater residencyâ€”took the stage close to 11 PM and charged into â€œDonâ€™t Want You No More,â€ â€œItâ€™s Not My Cross To Bear,â€ â€œEnd of the Line,â€ â€œNo One To Run With,â€ â€œBlack Hearted Woman,â€ â€œWhoâ€™s Been Talkingâ€ and â€œMidnight Rider.â€ The group then opened its show to guests during â€œOne Way Outâ€ with Robinson returning to the stage, Pyle sitting in for Jaimoe and Berry Oakley Jr replacing bassist Oteil Burbridge. Oakley, whose father and namesake was the ABBâ€™s founding bassist, also remained onstage for â€œStatesboro Blues.â€

Though no members of the Grateful Dead sat in during the show, as had been heavily rumored, the Allman Brothers Band did pay back-to-back tributes to two of its Summer Jam at Watkins Glenn co-headliners. First, the Allman Brothers Band covered The Bandâ€™s â€œThe Weightâ€ with Louis on keyboards and Freed on auxiliary guitar. Then moe.â€™s Garvey, Loughlin and Amico returned to the stage for a â€œBlue Skyâ€ jam that bled into the Grateful Deadâ€™s â€œFranklinâ€™s Tower.â€ The members of the Allman Brothers Band brought back the Dickinson Brothers and Herrera for a set-closing â€œSouthboundâ€ jam and closed its set sans guests with the lone encore of â€œWhipping Post.â€

The night came to a close around 2 AM with a surprise second encore of Pink Floydâ€™s â€œWish You Were Hereâ€ that featured Haynes, Oakley, Johnson, Louis and Abts.
