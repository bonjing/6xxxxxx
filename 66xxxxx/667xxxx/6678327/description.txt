Millions of single women rent apartments. They do not think about who lived there before them. They do not know the owners. They never think to change the lock. After separating from her husband, a young doctor Juliet Dermer starts a new life in a spacious loft removable. Inexpensive apartment is so good that Julie could not believe his luck. Soon, however, she begins to suspect that no one at home. With horror, she realizes that the cute Max homeowner chose it for his manic game of cat and mouse.
