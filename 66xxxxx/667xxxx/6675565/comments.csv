,tattooinescavenger,2012-04-15T18:02Z,"Totally with you there, man - but they can't even stop long enough to just say a  thank you. I'm thinking of compiling a similar thing for CURVE but if this is the response they can stuff it.  Have to say the choice of tracks is bizarre though - the second disc is almost redundant compared to the power of the first. No ""Metal"" or ""Get down Make Love"" (albeit covers themselves) or mention of his involvement with Bowie over the years? And no SCREAMING BIRD!! But a good comp nonetheless, even if it is a parallel of ""what is and could have been""
But thankyou vtwin."
