,amnios,2011-10-08T14:21Z,"I'm a fan of space and cosmology, etc but this fil was pretty boring at times... and although the video images themselves are flawless the 3D is not exactly mind blowing overall.  The best scenes were the CGI of the stars, nebulas etc NOT hubble ot the space shuttle etc.  Certainly not a video you would show someone to showcase 3D at home.

But thanks for the upload anyway!"
,wirama,2011-10-13T20:26Z,ISO? this file is .mkv
,dochaliday,2011-10-13T21:32Z,"I want to watch this on an Acer laptop with Nvidia 3D, is there a way of burning-or watching-this with a full screen and not the side by side?  "

,jabs123,2012-03-22T13:07Z,anyone tell me what to do to play this as its saying program doesnt support dts?/
,powcub,2012-04-06T23:46Z,I can not say that I understand those who are not impressed by this. For me and my daughter we had a really fun time in wondering when we saw this movie. It was the closest we could be present in the universe. Those who think that they were not impressed can not have glasses that provide real 3d. This was special. Never before have I seen the universe in this way. Thanks for the experience!
