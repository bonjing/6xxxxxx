,gonzo703,2012-02-13T05:20Z,each of these files play for about 10 seconds and then stop - what can I do to get these to work?  Thank you.

Your either using a crappy player (windows media player, real player, VLC player, pretty much anything made by Microsoft or in America) or the files are incomplete. Dude just download The Kmplayer at kmplayerforums (version 1435 is best) It has every codec known to man plus a super cool album view of your vids. The only real alternative is Gom player, works the same but not as sleak. "
