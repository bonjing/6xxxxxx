So I have decided that uploading 10 at a time is better. With my last upload, it took me too long to upload it (I can only upload at 100kbps :S) so a smaller file size was in order.

Also I was thinking about it. If everyone seed 110%, then the torrent will always have seeders :D. 10 people will have equaled a whole extra person getting the file :D.

So yeah, enjoy and try seed 110% :D.
