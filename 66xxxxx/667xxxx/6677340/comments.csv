Thanks for the Series, great quality... also enjoyed the 1978 series from you!"
,bobobo1234,2012-06-02T07:58Z,"This one actually only contains the 1st season, English Audio with optional Dutch subs."
,bobobo1234,2012-06-02T12:20Z,"I have to stand corrected - it is the complete 1980 season ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080221/ )  in MKV format, but only with Dutch subs, no English ones. English subs are here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search2/sublanguageid-eng/movieyearsign-1/movieyear-1980/moviename-battlestar+galactica+"
