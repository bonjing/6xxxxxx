Country star Kenny Chesney is in town not singing this time, but as Executive Producer of a new film set to air on ESPN. It's called,
The Color Orange: The Condredge Holloway Story.
The documentary is set to air Sunday, February 20th at 8pm on ESPN. I talked with Kenny and Condredge today at Neyland Stadium about the film.
It is part of ESPN'S series on the year of the quarterback.
Kenny was asked by ESPN to produce the film. Condredge happened to be Kenny's hero growing up. Kenny says he even wore Condredge's jersey number 7, while in high school.
