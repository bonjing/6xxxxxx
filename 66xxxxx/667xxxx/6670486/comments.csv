@knox666
Clearly looks like you're just bragging about your PC there, yeah real nice. Looks like you should have plenty of money to pay for Minecraft. The developers of this game REALLY deserve the money, to be honest unless its downloading software which costs a bomb I don't understand why people like you come on TPB. I come on because i'm only a college student, I can't afford to buy games or go to the cinema but you obviously can. Support the industries if you have the money, otherwise you're just a selfish, greedy twat."
,rhinowar,2011-09-13T04:50Z,"but not sanctimonious and hypocritical.....

judge much?"
,SpiNiXxX,2011-09-13T05:37Z,great game! :)
,knox666,2011-09-13T05:59Z,"@ cyberfeak I cant afford any games because I spents all my money on my pc. :( Lol joking. Actually bud your hateful nd spiteful. I'm just a smart consumer my game library consist of 360 wii ps3 and my pc I spend thousands on my families games I use this site as a ""demo"" site if the internet gives me the tools i'll do what I shall. I like to brag about? you say.it's far from the best but i'm still a proud papa. I in fact was not bragging in this regard I was actually cutting to the chase and stating to whatever inciteful person would want to know is my hardware specs in case I could not run the game to begin with. If I was bragging I would of also stated I play all my pc games in full hd on my 52 inch sharp aqious tv with wireless kb and mouse with windows controller and headset but I did'nt because I just listed the relevant specs.....have a nice day jackass ;)"
,knox666,2011-09-13T06:01Z,P.S. I am still having that memory leak problem must be a bug :/
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-13T06:25Z,..
,Illanair,2011-09-13T08:42Z,@knox66: Yes - It is a confirmed bug. Thems the risks of playing pre-release copies. They are shipped to testers for --- y'know testing :P
,Sivos,2011-09-13T12:42Z,Why do I no longer have sound now?
,Sivos,2011-09-13T12:47Z,"Okay I fixed the sound problem, but all I did was download the site posted version.  I only wanted this for the installer because apparently I had the wrong one that wouldn't convert to 1.8 when I installed it.  So, the installer works, the .jar doesn't.  If it ends up working for others, yay for you, I just decided to use the real one instead of trying to figure it out."
,stonerz101,2011-09-14T06:29Z,dnt mean to mean troll :p just supporting.. but if u dnt have minecraft already.. heres an auto installer.. much quicker and at 4mbs... Simple http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6665910/MINECRAFT_BETA_1.8_PRE-RELEASE_
