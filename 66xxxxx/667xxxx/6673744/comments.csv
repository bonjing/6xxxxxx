,ttutteerr,2011-09-14T13:48Z,"@StraatRat - Firstly, Extremezone is your best bet at getting torrents, so if he/she/they hasn't/haven't got it, it probably doesn't exist.
Mainstream movies take longer to pirate because of the precautions taken by the companies who make those movies.  Dreamworks have considerably more financial ability to prevent the pirating of their movies than other, less popular, movie makers. Thats why it takes so much longer for mainstream movies to be pirated.  I am sure that Extremezone will be releasing the movies you are after within the next few months...so hang in there."
