Developer Rogero has released a new pup to fix Trophy Error problems
that arise after downgrading the PS3 console using Dospiedra's v2 method,
and then updating using a MFW (modified firmware). With the help of eussNL,
he has created a MFW: 3.55, 3.70 spoof, Internet Blocked, LV1 Checks Patched,
to prevent your system from bricking when trying to update it,
getting rid of the Trophy Error, and bypassing the 3.56+ syscon version check.
Thanks to Rogero for sharing this with us and warning us all, about these issues!
