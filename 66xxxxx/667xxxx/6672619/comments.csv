,Korbendallas,2011-09-13T17:39Z,Thanks! that encode must have taken ages to finish :)
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-09-13T19:54Z,"Yes, it did.
Would be nice if someone could upload the soundtrack of this movie and give us the link. The music is phenomenal, like all music from John Powel.

Lol, the CD costs as much as a Blu-ray disc ;-)
Music industry is greedy indeed."

I'm wating for the a 
""Star Wars Blu-ray - The Complete Saga"" release which has the same audios & subs.
Then it will take some time till I encode them (with super high encoding settings).
I keep saying; ""With the good stuff you need to be patient, don't jump immediately for the first releases!"""
