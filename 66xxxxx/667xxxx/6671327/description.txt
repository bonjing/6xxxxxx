Miguel - Sure Thing
Though not a single I uploaded it since in my own opinion the rest of his songs suck and the only two versions of the album uploaded are low quality.  Anyone who has a complaint, don't even post it.  Just compare the song to the other versions and kiss my ass because you can't even compare the quality. With that out the way on to the encoding:

LAME 3.96
ID3 Tag v2.3
320 kbps CBR
44100 kHz
Joint-Stereo
CRC Detection
Size 7.45MB

All the tags are correct so just add it to iTunes and enjoy!
