to libtorrent users :
please,give enough up speed and be sure to rightly set your settings as well.
Got huge congestion on my torrents with most of you : big freeze and difficult
 to  resolve as well.I suggest you to use transmission or deluge on linux.
Ty for understanding and don't forget to regulary check your tracker list also.
Btw,if you have a too slow internet connection,so please,don't go on my torrents to avoid to create huge network congestion so.
