If frame size is same throughout the episodes with mentioned aspect ratio giving small frame at default which is 16:9 with other apsect ratio's not improving frame...

This will get you full screen, full frame

In Video menu, deselect 'Scale', which will shrink the frame and that is required else next step will enlarge too much, then in 'Zoom' select 2:1 (double) and frame will expand to full screen, that's the way to do it.


Peace. : )"

Your information is correct, but you don't have to 
point that out in every torrent.  I think they're
getting the idea by now that VLC Player is the way to go.....on both PC and Mac. :)

Later, dude."
