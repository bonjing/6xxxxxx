,3Dazz,2012-01-26T08:34Z,"Props for uploading OU for passive polarised TV's, but the audio setting of PCM just does'nt work on most devices. Just to be able to move this file I had to to delete any codecs and players with codecs from my pc""s, otherwise, anytime you went near the file, windows explorer sopped working. Even in safe mode, I couldnt shift it. As it is, I can only play it on a thumbstick plugged directly in to my TV, and I have to turn the home theatre right up."
