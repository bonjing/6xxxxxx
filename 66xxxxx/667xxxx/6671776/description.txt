Description:
A young musician is summoned to his mother's castle in accordance with her final wishes. Upon his arrival, Johnny quickly discovers that things are not as they appear. The castle begins to come alive as materializing spirits lead him to Mephisto (voiced by Harry Shearer), the ghoulish henchman to Mr. D (also Harry Shearer), who makes Johnny a tantalizing offer. The same offer that his mother accepted over twenty years earlier: surrender your soul in exchange for fame and fortune. Experience a whirling visual thrill ride as Johnny explores the underworld of the castle to the explosive climax where Johnny confronts Mr. D and fights to free his mother/s spirit.
