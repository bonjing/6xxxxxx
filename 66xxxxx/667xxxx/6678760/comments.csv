,nflfan,2011-09-15T21:22Z,Thanks phatwarez. I'm guessing you've had some difficulties with your own caps but well done for this. Nice manageable size too. Hope the TYT police aren't on your case. 
,nik09,2011-09-15T21:25Z,"Phatwarez is back!
Holefully he will bring some good torrents, there is 2  Patriots games up, but both stops at 68% and there is 0 seeders... 
Love Phatwarez, no homo.."
[V],phatwarez,2011-09-15T22:08Z,Yeah lots of difficulties. You won't believe how much time and work i've lost due to poorly timed hardware & software failures. 
,strathmeyer,2011-09-15T23:21Z,Thanks!
,nflfan,2011-09-16T09:08Z,"Phatwarez, I can understand the problems youve had which makes what you've done with all these games all the more amazing. Just an unbelievable effort!!!"
