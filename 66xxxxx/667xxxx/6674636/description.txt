The Cities 97 Sampler (also titled Cities Sampler and The Cities' Sampler) is a series of albums containing "live in studio" recordings from radio station Cities 97 (KTCZ 97.1 FM) in Minneapolis, Minnesota (earlier branded "The Cities' 97"). It has been released annually since 1989, and new volumes appear in November at local Target stores (in time for the Christmas season), with proceeds benefiting various charitable organizations. The CD usually generates over $500,000 every year for Minnesota charities. In the last several years, the recordings have sold quickly, disappearing within minutes in many stores.

The 16th volume, released on November 11, 2004, had a print run of about 35,000 copies. In Forest Lake, Minnesota, the local Target store ran out of its shipment of discs in seven minutes.
