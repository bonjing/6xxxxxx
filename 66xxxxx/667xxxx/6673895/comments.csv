,BoonesFerry,2011-09-14T04:24Z,Holding out for a standard def file between 350-500mb. 
,hippopotamus23,2011-09-14T04:34Z,"my download unpacked fine last week. thanks sceneline, i have faith. downloading now. if any problems i'll be back to report that, but last weeks (ahead of air date or not - i don't know as don't have a telly or tv guide) was all good. "

,Polarbear4444,2011-09-14T08:42Z,"Alright sorry guys. I didn't know about e4.  And as far as the file not working, don't what happened.  I downloaded it again and it works great.  So I take back what I said and would like to say sorry sceneline.  You seem to be the only one that uploads this show and was pissed off when it didn't work."
