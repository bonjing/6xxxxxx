I found a way to keep your custom controls for keyboard permanently.

Go to the Game folder inside the installation directory
Open the buttonDataKeyBoardMouse.ini

Here you have to change the first column of the 7th paragraph.
There are 4 lines:
1st Line: Shoot
2nd Line: Pass
3rd Line: Sliding Tackle/Cross
4th line: Through Ball/Goalkeeper Charge

Take a note in which style controls are written. like LSHIFT.

Now change them according to your wish.. I set it like this

AddMap SC_D VB_AI_B # B
AddMap SC_A VB_AI_A # A
AddMap SC_S VB_AI_X # X
AddMap SC_W VB_AI_Y # Y

the 8th and 9th paragraph look same. so i don't know which one is for menu and which one is for controls. Since I play with gamepad and needed to change to to play double player with my friend, I changed for both the paragraphs (as I control menu with gamepad) Since the 2nd column for paragraph 7 is VB_AI_, I think the most probable paragraph for controls is paragraph 9. Go test it.

For 9th or 8th Paragraph
1st Line: Switch Player/Trigger Run
2nd Line: Teammate Contain/Juggle
3rd Line: Pace Control
4th Line: Sprint

Again change the value of first column in similar way. I kept it like this. (Showing the 9th paragraph)

AddMap SC_Q VB_AI_LB # L1
AddMap SC_LSHIFT VB_AI_RB # R1
AddMap SC_C VB_AI_LT # L2
AddMap SC_E VB_AI_RT # R2"
