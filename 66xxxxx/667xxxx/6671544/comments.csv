,Abrahambel,2011-09-15T00:39Z,"A perfect treat for those of us interest in the founding, The Constitution of the U.S. and the Supreme court. The PBS's four part series on the Supreme Court is superb and the lectures are serious and top notch. . 
And If I may, I would just recommend an Annotated guide to the Constitution as a supplement. Here is a good one:
http://library.nu/docs/3M0D1FBTKY/The%20Annotated%20U.S.%20Constitution%20and%20Declaration%20of%20Independence

In short, this is a highly recommended compilation for students and for self-study alike from teacher Ram.
