NOW YOU ARE READY TO PLAY (That is if you have installed the updates up to v1.7
Please do try to play on a couple of those servers that have new maps. It takes some time to download all of the basic files but just be patient and it will download all that you need. the actuall maps are 30+ mb large and there are over 20+ different maps but you will only have to download one map at a time and that before each game, if you dont have it already."
