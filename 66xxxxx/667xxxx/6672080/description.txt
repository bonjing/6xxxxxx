George Thorogood can usually be counted on to deliver infectious, rowdy blues-rock, and 'Boogie People' is no exception. Though not quite on a par with 'Bad To The Bone', this is an unpretentious party album with more than a few assets. The splendor of Chess Records had long been one of Thorogood's primary inspirations, so it shouldn't come as a major surprise that his versions of John Lee Hooker's 'Mad Man Blues,' Howlin' Wolf's 'No Place To Go' and Muddy Waters' 'Can't Be Satisfied' are as appealing as they are. The Delaware singer managed to offend the 'Political Correctness Police' with 'If You Don't Start Drinkin' (I'm Gonna Leave),' which finds a drunken man chastising his companion for choosing to remain sober. But they missed a key point: this song is an example of pure humor that, like so many blues songs before it, isn't meant to be taken all that seriously.
