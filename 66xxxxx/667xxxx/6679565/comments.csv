,m4bana,2011-09-16T07:07Z,"Both me and my mate were not able to get this to work. The installer freezes on Installing:__DISC__ which is a 1kb file in ""Data."" Is there something I'm doing wrong with the patch? Also: This is update 1.30, yes? Thank you :)

To all the people thinking they have to download the .iso, you don't, just make sure to only download the update 4 folder :)"
,Insomneac,2011-09-16T07:18Z,How come this idiot hasn't been banned?
,DragonSpice,2011-09-16T07:34Z,yeah xlive.dll? most likely fake

,auxios,2011-09-16T16:10Z,"New working steam APPID;

17700

taken from: game.ali213.net/thread-3691937-1-1.html

How to change APPID & Backup Save / Moving to New ID;

1. Go to Dead Island Install Dir

2. Right Click steam_appid.txt , Click Properties, untick read-only attribute, ok

3. Open steam_appid.txt , change the APPID, then save

4. Right Click steam_appid.txt , Click Properties, tick back read-only attribute, ok

YOU MUST DO THIS OR CHANGING APPID WOULDNT WORK.

Backup Save Game / Moving Save Game to New ID;

1. Right Click on Steam / SmartSteam shortcut, Click Properties

2. Click Open File Location

3. Now you are in Steam Directory, Browse to

Steam\userdata\[randomnumberhere]\APPID\

randomnumberhere is your steam ID (dont share / post them in internet)

APPID is your save game folder and everytime you change dead island appid, create new folder with the same number of new APPID, and copy the files located in older APPID to the new one.

for example if your old dead island APPID is 13140, then copy the files in that folder to new 17700 (make new folder for every new ID).

Have fun :)"

,El_Cortez,2011-09-17T11:10Z,"Hey there !

So look, i'm not an informatician, i really don't know how these things work.

I've been downloading the RELOADED stuff for years, but it's always in vain cuz i never know how to make it work.

I see the comments below saying that everything works perfectly and the game is great, and i really wish i could say the same thing because the game really looks nice.

So can anyone help me ?
Once i finish downloading the game, what do i do ? How do i install it, how do i make it work ?

I followed the instructions by the letter but still nothing works, it's like the game isn't even here. 

Can anyone please email me at marklawrit@gmail.com ?
I just want to make the game work.

Thanks a lot everybody ! And thanks for the upload as well !
Cheers"
,zelopes,2011-09-17T11:17Z,guys dont say it is fake if you didn't even try it plz...
,douchette,2011-09-19T10:07Z,"Has anyone actually TRIED the steps and it didn't work? Kinda want to try it, but such a huge file size, idk..."
,douchette,2011-09-19T10:09Z,"I took a look at this guy's other uploads... 
They all seem to be fake shit. 
Not going to risk it by downloading this torrent."
,rickurd,2011-09-19T14:22Z,Just because it works doesnt mean it is a real release stupid
,Waterhead,2011-09-21T14:55Z,"downloaded this torrent, it has all language packs for the game and for steam(latest version) I mounted the .iso and ran setup but the installer is undersized for the window not letting me have the option to choose the install button, can tab thru but have no idea what your choosing until you hit enter to see what pops up on the screen. Ive tried this way several times but cannot seem to find the install button.....everything is hidden---you only see partial text when asking if you want to install bla bla bla, even the Eula is partially visable and cant see where to the check the box ""I Agree"" anyone know of a fix to make the installer window larger?"
,spannermonky,2011-09-22T11:58Z,"Ok people, this is how you do it:
Mount the iso, it will let you choose where to put the files (name it 'dead island'), now open the ROM Drive its mounted too, copy all the content inside the 'Crack' folder and paste it into the ('dead island')folder that the files got installed too, and there is your game, enjoy :)"
,Deathstryker,2011-09-22T19:03Z,"I have the legit version of the game, and I can tell you people without a doubt that nearly all of the DLL's in the release are not in the actual game.

Something's not right with it."
,1PirateDude,2011-09-23T11:42Z,"Guys this is fake, i tried it and everything its just the full game and nothing else full game with a keylogger + a virus in it, dont trust this uploader ever agian peace."
,ebongny,2011-09-26T01:36Z,the installation stuck at almost 90% i tried thrice to install it. not working.
,johnniebrasco,2011-09-27T10:14Z,"Fuck reloaded, when skidrow rip a game they eventually update it, nothing seems to happen with this game..."
,beemerman2011,2011-10-01T14:01Z,"installs upto 99.9% and then stops responding, have tried allsorts to fix it but its a bollocks download."
,beemerman2011,2011-10-01T14:03Z,"also in relation to the above, it is full of bogus .dll files. not even remotely related to the game, wtf is he achieving here?"
,Cordes96,2011-10-05T09:29Z,"@posmei Could you please only upload the update, i don't want to download the complete game again, only for the update ?!"
