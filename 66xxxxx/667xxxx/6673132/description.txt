The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This thirty-fifth alphabetical installment is: DC from Our F-PN

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.


=================================

About 317GB to go after this one!

The theme of the day is "nitpicking"(or "nitpik'n) " or "education" ! Oh -  and another theme is "I'm older than most of you"

     There is a distinction between Batman and the Outsiders which is in the Batman torrent, and just Outsiders which some fail to make. One issue  (v3 26-marked in name) says Batman and the Outsiders on the cover as Batman  appears in that issue, but it's still Outsiders in the indica. 

     For you fellow nitpickers:
V4 of Outsiders ends at issue #40 and for that last issue is renamed Bantman and the Outsiders. For just one issue I didn't feel I should split the series again, as was already done after issue 14 of this series.

     If you don't know what raw scans means, it  means just as the scanner program produced them, no edits. This biggest need here is for someone to crop the huge margins. Volunteers? It's easy, just tedious. Other edits might be nice but much more time required for that.  if you do it I'll put them in a fill torrent. BTW there will probably be just two fill torrents and I am thinking I will hold them till the end, or do one very soon and one at the end.

     This is not actually one of the DC published humanoids titles, and it's not related to one so far as I know.  Tossed in for those of you who might like it. It's not the only one like that but I may not have mentioned it on any previous ones.

      Pat Boone was quite a famous singer/actor once upon a time. You may never have heard of him because you are one of them "young-in's" we old folks complain about. I actually saw a movie or two he starred in at the theater back in the cave-man days.

     Archie comics existed before Archie but of course were not called that. Archie and crew became so popular that they eventually took over the company almost entirely. 
     But they have published as Red Circle Comics, Radio Comics, and MLJ Comics.  Along the way they did have some super-heroes, later taken up by DC in various forms. These are some of the comics they appeared in before DC.

     Peter Panda is not to be confused with "Sexual Harassment Panda". If you have never seen the animated comedy "South Park" episode that introduced him to an unsuspecting world, I'm not going to explain it except to say he was against harassment, not a harasser. Panda's are way too nice (in our imagination) to do such a thing. Real Pandas can be dangerous of course, but not in that way. Except perhaps to other pandas. Lacking any legal system, female Pandas have little recourse, so they mostly keep quite about it. Male Pandas will never admit to being victims.

     BTW, if your are old enough you will recall being taught in school, by TV wildlife documentaries, byeager Zoo docents, etc that Panda's were absolutely NOT bears as widely thought and don't you dare call then "Panda Bears". Now of course they un-apologetically let us know that they are, after all, bears. Where that leaves them in relation to their erstwhile relatives the "Red Panda" which as far as I know are not at all closely related to bears, is a story for another time. Look for Red Pandas to get a new name as it would appear "Panda" is now a misnomer.

     BTW, since we are on the subject of classifications, let me educate you about one of my pet peeves. Monkeys have tails. Apes do not have tails (I don't know if apes taught sign language ever have tales - see what I did there?). Don't let me catch you at the zoo or in the forest referring to anything without a tail as a monkey.  I restrain my self from correcting children and parents at the zoo when they call Gorillas, Chimps. Bonobos, Orangs, Gibbons and Siamangs Monkeys. I make an exception for calling human children "little monkeys" since it's metaphorical.

     BTW, you might think the above is a natural mistake, but what about parents who don't know the difference between a LIon, a Leopard and a Tiger?

     BTW, That's a lot of BTWs and this is a lot from "Peter Panda, and yet there's more!

     In quite the opposite vein, or so you may think, I maintain it is perfectly ok to speak of "Shellfish, Starfish" etc, reasoning  along the same lines as most people who will call a tomato a vegetable, not a fruit. There are correct scientific classifications, and there is common usage -  often centered around different classifications schemes which are no less valid than the scientific ones, they just have different purposes.. There are excellent cooking and dietary reasons for calling a tomato a vegetable in those realms,. When in the realm of botany, it's a fruit. There is even a US supreme court decision affirming it as scientifically a fruit but commonly and for the purpose of some tax or tariff or the like, a vegetable. The court referred to common meal/cooking usage in it's decision. Lord god in Heaven, why do I know things like that?
     OK so for a very long time, before the scientific classification scheme took hold (shout-out to Linnaeus!), fish meant any animal in the sea. I stand by the long time historical usage for many things  in common speech, because I think most people are well aware that clams and crabs and starfish are not fish int the scientific sense. On the other hand don't be calling a dolphin a fish.  When people do that I think it's because they really don't know the difference. 
     It's not imprecision in language that  bugs me, it's ignorance of stuff that I don't understand how it's possible not to know if you went to school. I blame people for not paying attention and learning. How could they not care? How could they not want to know EVERYTHING as I do? (i.e I want to know everything, not that I do know everything - I just act like I do.) I never blame anyone for not knowing things they had no way of knowing - but I still want to teach them because I assume they are eager to learn. Sadly, they mostly are not.

     Peter Porkchops is a Pig, Since he is a humanized, talking pig. I think it's a bit creepy to name him after a favorite edible part of the common pig. Even if, as the beast in the book "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe" he is a talking creature who actually wants to be eaten, created for just that purpose. If you don't think a being wanting and asking to be eaten is a bit disturbing and somehow wrong, or even if you do, you should read about the people who want exactly that. Famously, a German man advertised on the internet for someone to eat, and got a willing victim. He was tried for manslaughter.  There are other known cases, and it is unknown how many unknown numbers of people want to be eaten by unknown numbers of people  who want to eat them (and remain unknown).

     There is a vast amount of non-DC Phantom. The same goes for a number of other characters DC did a small amount with e.g. Tarzan, Star Trek and others.
      Last time I made three big supplemental torrents of Phantom stuff. They are now apparently dead. I'll consider reposting them.  I can't just reseed as I'm sure some of the comics in my collection have changed.

     Interesting  DC-EC connection here. EC stood for educational comics, and i the early days they published some in theta vein. This series was created by William Gaines, founder of EC, but partly published under the DC name. Inside the comics you will see it stated they are published by Gaines. A later connect is that EC's Mad Magazine after many years came to be published by DC. Thats' why that whole magazine is in this series.

     An interesting bit off trivia is that DC's "Elongated Man" was created in deliberate imitation of Plastic Man. The creator  really wanted to do Plastic Man stories,  but did not realize that DC owned the rights to Plastic Man!  I always preferred Elongated Man, so I'm grateful for his ignorance.
