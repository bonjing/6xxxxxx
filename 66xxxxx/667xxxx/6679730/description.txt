With his emotional and gravel-coated bellow, vocalist/guitarist Chuck Ragan made a name for himself as one-fourth of the much loved Gainesville post-hardcore outfit Hot Water Music before releasing his first solo album in 2007. Alongside friends Chris Wollard, Jason Black, and George Rebelo, Ragan formed Hot Water Music in the early 90s. Through a slew of well-received albums for labels like No Idea, Doghouse, and Epitaph - and an incessant grassroots touring regime - the passionate crew turned itself into a highly respected and influential act on the underground scene. Outside of his main gig, Ragan also recorded two side albums with some friends, including the stripped-down rock of Rumbleseat and the punk-oriented Crows. In the spring of 2005, Hot Water Music went on an indefinite hiatus, largely spurred by Ragans desire to spend time outside of the band with his growing family. The groups other members went on playing music together (soon forming the Draft), while Ragan concentrated on his home life and, eventually, writing some acoustic-based material.
