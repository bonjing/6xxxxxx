Twisted Lands: Insomniac Collector's Edition

Developer: Big Fish Games
Genre: Hidden Object, Puzzle


Twisted Lands: Insomniac goes for the gusto right out of the gate with a creepy doctor who says, "I don't want to scare you, but we're going to do a lobotomy." That lobotomy is going to be done on you, by the way, and you just happen to be strapped to a gurney - but hey, don't worry or anything, it's all good. And Insomniac only gets better from there. It doesn't always make perfect sense and the Collector's Edition bonuses are extremely weak, but the game itself, particularly for horror HOG fans, is definitely not to be missed.
