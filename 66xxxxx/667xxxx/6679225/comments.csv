,nflfan,2011-09-17T13:34Z,Sync issues. Guess it's another one I'll have to watch with no sound.

,jimmychances,2011-10-07T21:40Z,The quality of this torrent is fantastic. Will you be doing anymore Redskins uploads and if you are how quick will you be able to upload. I have to watch some frustrating streams because I live overseas. I'm thinking I might not bother with the streams and stay off NFL.com and wait until you upload! Watching it without knowing the score with this kind of quality would be great for me.
