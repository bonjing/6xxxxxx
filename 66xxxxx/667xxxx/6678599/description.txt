Down To Earth is the fourth studio album released by Rainbow, released in 1979. Most of the album had been already written and recorded by the time Graham Bonnet was recruited. Also recruited were ex-Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover and keyboardist Don Airey. Lyrics were by Glover (with Bonnet making several uncredited contributions), music by Blackmore, Airey and Cozy Powell.

This was to be the only Rainbow album on which Bonnet sang, although he was still part of the band when writing for Difficult to Cure began.

"Bad Girl", an outtake from the album sessions, was used as the B-side to the "Since You Been Gone" single.

Similarly, "Weiss Heim", an instrumental recorded in Copenhagen in January 1980, was the B-side to "All Night Long".
