Tom DeSimone, working as Lancer Brooks, helmed this early 1980s, gay porn, love story focusing on a repressed porn writer (Johnny Dawes) whose encounters with a hunky male prostitute (Michael Christopher) inspire him and his writing. Long considered one of the best made and acted gay films of the period, the film has a notable cast of studs from the era and good production values, including a fine musical score. Wrote this contributor to IMBD, \\\\\\\"There are just five sex scenes in this movie but, to quote one genre critic, any more and you would need a third hand! The two stars are up first and display spectacular chemistry.\\\\\\\" Christopher and Dawes, who would later be paired in \\\\\\\"Pleasure Beach,\\\\\\\" were reputedly lovers at the time and that bond certainly heats up their scenes.
