,pryingeyes,2011-09-15T22:05Z,"A ton of us are at 98.96. Until the OP comes back and seeds -- it would take less than a minute -- we'll all stay stuck. One mine of your time, OP, would get it to everyone in a matter of moments."
,vive139,2011-09-16T05:31Z,Shit !!!!!       It doesnt work !!!!!
,vive139,2011-09-16T09:59Z,"I found the issue !  You have to restart to complete the install.
It works great after restart. 

Thanks Anacondaz"

""Is this bootable so I can defragment my HDD ?""

I don't know the answer to that yet, however, you can load the disc in while your desktop is running, and run application from there or install Mac OS X to an External Drive, as well as this application on to it, and run it from there, as well."
