,DickDickstein,2011-09-17T02:39Z,"Thanks. Can't believe his own website doesn't have the full episodes for these up. Utterly stupid of them to not take advantage of the traffic. 

First part was good quality and worked fine, as I assume this is, however I am having to download it a 2nd time for some reason. First version I downloaded wouldn't open. Must have downloaded weird somehow I guess. I will write back in a few minutes to say if I got it to work. "
,DickDickstein,2011-09-17T02:46Z,"Yup./..works fine. No idea what the issue was.

I'm no Dr. Phil fan, but this was an outstanding interview. Baffles the mind how this woman could have walked free. Goes to show how uncommon common sense is in thsi world. "
,No.2_PeNciL,2011-09-24T07:21Z,Thanks for the upload!!!  But how coma part 3 is nowhere to be found.  ANYWHERE its the ending but noone cares for some reason haha... Interviews where pretty damn good to me!
