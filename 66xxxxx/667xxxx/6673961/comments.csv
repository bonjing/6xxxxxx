,IChown,2011-10-02T10:57Z,"My dumb ass has been looking for this. Haven't tried it yet. WinSetup is in the process of doing its job. I tired a few other programs from Ultra iso to WintoFlash. None would work for XP. I'm to lazy to do all that PEbuilder crap. Anyway. It looks promising. hope it works. I'll wish myself luck.

Thank you good sir. Or madam..."

,Dandy007,2011-12-04T20:55Z,thnx 4 good work! wat 'format' does USB need t b? FAT32/NTFS plz...thnx in advance..
,Ferkelwemmser,2011-12-16T04:23Z,"In WinSetupFromUSB, when selecting the source folder, do NOT select the ""I386"" folder, but the one containing it. If you select the ""I386"" folder, you will get the ""DOSNET.INF file is missing"" error message."

,tomatoobatt,2012-03-17T09:00Z,I don't get the instructions. I just want to reformat my old laptop (xp). I ran the installation. I don't understand what to do next??
,XONi49,2012-04-18T15:17Z,all this does is make a complicated bootable usb drive your better off just finding a usb format tool that creates a bootable drive then copy the contents of your iso to that usb drive you can use any file-system that way if your trying to find a Live Windows usb the closest thing you will get is active boot but it is just a very Lite version of windows 7
