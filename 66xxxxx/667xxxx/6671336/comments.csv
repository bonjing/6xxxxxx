I would think that having the purple icon and pirate approved rating you'd be better than to upload something thats garbage.  Or rather then me call it garbage because of the 5 trojans in the file which could very well be in some stroke of luck all false positives.  I think you would be more intelligent to upload something like this and have us users sort it out amongst ourselves.

Yet the side note you leave ""I havent tested this, assures us you really have no clue what youve uploaded."""
