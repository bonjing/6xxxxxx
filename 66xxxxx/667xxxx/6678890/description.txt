Deank has released another update for multiMAN now at version 02.06.03. Changes include the
removal of the older FTP server and the addition of jjolano's FTP server called openps3ftp.
Although openps3ftp can also be considered as "old", Deank assures us that this build is better.
Other changes include a fix for the "Coverflow" mode, as well as an update to the disclaimer.
