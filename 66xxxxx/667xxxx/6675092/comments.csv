Not sure bout PD 7 against the last version of PD 6. Not an expert but I'm not noticing any improvements in Games and frame rate, in fact I think PD6 introduces some more problems - Dead Island that runs in bootcamp won't run in PD7 and Battlefield Bad Company 3 gets stuck on launch trying to run the updater (and this is legit copy I purchased caus I liked soooo much).

Maybe next few versions of PD7 will improve. Anybody know if Parallels has released an update over the PD7 launched that will work with current working serial?"

,DurtySocks,2011-10-27T20:13Z,"^ Perfect instructions.
However, everything was working fine until i tried to install windows. I got an error msg and then paralells quit.

""Unable to connect to Parallels Service.
Make sure that the prl_disp_service process is active and it is not blocked by Firewall. For details, please refer to http://kb.parallels.com/en/8089. If the problem persists, contact the Parallels support team for assistance.""

anyone get passed this?
cheers"
,DurtySocks,2011-10-27T20:24Z,"Nevermind, found it.

1. Stop Parallels Service using the following command (in terminal):
sudo launchctl stop com.parallels.desktop.launchdaemon


2. And then start it again using:
sudo launchctl start com.parallels.desktop.launchdaemon


3. Enter this command to check if Parallels Service was started:
sudo launchctl list | grep com.parallels.desktop.launchdaemon


The output should be like this:
79011  -  com.parallels.desktop.launchdaemon

In this example, 79011 stands for the process identification number (process ID). The process ID may have any value except zero.
Zero identification number indicates that Parallels Service was not started.http://kb.parallels.com/9087"

,dogan1400,2011-11-06T00:06Z,"First time register , first thanks to uploader... it works great :)"
,mon_semblable,2011-11-18T10:38Z,"Thanks, works perfectly!

For people who need some guidance:

-install Little Snitch beforehand, it will help you controll/block all the communication between Parallels and their company's server

-start Parallels installation; deny ALL the connections between Parallels and their servers

-activate with the serial number provided in the torrent (KM7SWA-D0V7WH-40CFX7-WS815F-YV0QRR)

-skip Registration

-in Parallels, disable updates

Just follow these steps and it will work!"

,juicyboy2011,2011-12-27T07:18Z,"Hey Guys, 
I would really appreciate some help.
I downloaded parallels 7(this torrent) and i find myself having a hard time getting it going. I also got my hands on the windows 7 to install with it. I just bought a mac, and im not to familiar with how this shit works. Really, im downloading parallels so i can get acid pro 7 working on the windows operating system since i cant put it on mac. If theres an option im not aware of out there, id appreciate some help!! But in regards to this program, im not sure what to do as far as editing terminals and such. The Key activates the software, but it doesnt visibly do anything on the computer... if theres a how to guide someone can point me to or perhaps some guidance my fellow pirates can give me, id appreciate it! thanks"

they are:
