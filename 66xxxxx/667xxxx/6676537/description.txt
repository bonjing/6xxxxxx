  Matt Baker and Clare Balding find out what it takes to turn a         
  working animal into a prize winner when they visit Mid Wales. Clare   
  is at the Monmouthshire Show, where the cattle are being primped and  
  preened for the show ring, while Matt is down on the farm             
  discovering how a young sheep handler makes sure her animals catch    
  the judge's eye.                                                      
                                                                        
  John Craven is joined by wildlife presenter Chris Packham and former  
  newspaper editor Janet Street-Porter to judge the annual Countyfile   
  Photographic Competition, with its theme of Best In Show. He reveals  
  the final 12 photos destined to take pride of place in the            
  Countryfile calendar for 2012, and explains how you can vote for the  
  overall winner.                                                       
                                                                        
  Plus, with a badger cull looming in an attempt to halt the spread of  
  bovine TB in cattle, Adam Henson attempts to learn more about these   
  elusive and controversial creatures which share his farm.
