 Grand Designs is hosted by Kevin McCloud. Kevin watches different peoples     
 progress each week at they build their dream homes.                           
                                                                               
 Kevin watches the progess made as artists Freddie Robins and Ben Coode-Adams  
 leave behind their urban flat to convert a huge Grade II listed timber framed 
 barn in Essex into a living and work space for themselves and their daughter.
