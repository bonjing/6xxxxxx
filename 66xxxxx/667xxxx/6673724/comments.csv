,Ville530,2011-09-16T23:37Z,"Great quality!! Could you please get ""Laugh at my Pain""?"
,rump_,2011-09-21T13:14Z,"Why would someone make a shitty movie with 50 cent about a struggling black family and just take the title from Nigerian author Chinua Achebe's 1958 book titled ""things fall apart"". It had nothing to do with Achebe's book. Kind of like pissing on the most famous African author ever. Nice."
