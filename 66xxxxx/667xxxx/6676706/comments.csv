,Portaldweller,2011-09-16T11:34Z,Mad Fake... Bioware does not give you a beta code to enter the beta... there beta list is by invite only and contains no Code to get in. They have a server white list and if your name is on that list then you have access to the beta. As for downloading the client your account name is flagged on the beta white list and from there you then have access to down load the client.. dont down load this shit its 110% fake
