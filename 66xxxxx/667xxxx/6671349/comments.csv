I am sorry that you are scared by your dreams of masculine well formed naked male bodies. And I bet you are even more scared that those dreams arouse you so much. It must be hard to be honest with yourself and even harder with others, but even for someone like you, who locked his own sexuality away at a deep dark place inside himself together with his tolerance and courage, there is a place in this world. But denial is not the answer. Don't be afraid - others have been where you are now. Let go and live your homosexuality!

But thank you nevertheless:
it is not often that one can read such a ridiculous comment on a torrent.
I LOLed :D !"

I gotta start getting out of the house more often."
