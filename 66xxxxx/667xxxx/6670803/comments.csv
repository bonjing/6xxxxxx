,Kizzleevolve,2011-09-13T17:48Z,Missing CD 1 for the movie.
,ptv83,2011-09-13T21:02Z,"CD1 & CD2 .idx files, but no CD1.avi :(   

CD2 starts when the belle is already airbourne & the waist gunners fight over the lucky medal(throws it out the side of the plane) and the disagreement about preps for the return party.

Everything before is supposed to be on CD1 and therefor missing..."
