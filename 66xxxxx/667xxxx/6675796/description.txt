Original series uploaded 2011-05-02 16:16:56 GMT by geovman.

Full, complete and intact, rare torrent, episodes numbered in recomended broadcast sequence.


Recoded with VirtualDub v1.10.1 from the original geovman series -
1) All 30 episodes now re-sized to 720x480 (not mixed sizes).
2) All using DivX 6.9.2 video compression using Home Theatre profile.
3) Slightly cleaned up the contrast so it doesn't look like you're looking through a grey smoke filter.
4) Slightly sharpened for a better/cleaner/crisper image.
5) Better bitrate for audio and video.
6) AC3 audio: 2-channel 256Kbps CBR @44.1KHz throughout.
7) Removed those god-awful 15-second "Film Factory" adverts in episodes 16-30.

I was thinking of uploading this in RAR chunks but the space saving is negligable so I decided to leave them as single, separate episodes for people to download.


Enjoy!
