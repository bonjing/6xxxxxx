I had to read thru what this one was about before i started to download, not that i wouldnt download it :P   Feels its walking a thin line between x and not xrated hehe. I guess one has to find out. Ty for the up, not much into horror, but this one actually might work :D"

,elvira-anne,2011-09-15T17:14Z,does any 1 know if the sub are hardcoded
,nightyman,2011-09-15T21:52Z,"If you click to download it you will see there is a .srt file included, this is a subtitlefile. So no, not hardcoded."
