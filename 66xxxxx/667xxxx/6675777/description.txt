    Directed by Peter Perry Jr.

    Things are slow in Hell. Lucifer U. Devil (MANNY GOODTIMES) hasn't       
    secured a fresh soul since Adolph Hitler. His wife, Saturna (IMA         
    GHOUL), is needling him to get off his pointed posterior and spring      
    back into action.                                                        
                                                                             
    When Ben-Hur Ova (burlesque comedian LITTLE JACK LITTLE, looking like    
    nearly every New York City hot dog vendor I've ever seen) is voted       
    the 'World's Most Faithful Husband' by Ladies House Companion            
    magazine, Lucifer is challenged by the claim that no earthly             
    temptation can lure Ben away from his loving spouse, Miassis (BEA        
    REDDY). 'I'll have him cheating on his wife within two shakes of a       
    sinner's tail,' the Devil vows.                                          
                                                                             
    Lucifer tries to corrupt the hapless hubby with lots of nubile (and      
    naked) lovelies, but to no avail. It turns out that Ben is a visiting    
    Arabian sheik with a harem outnumbering the chorus line at Radio City    
    Music Hall; tempting this noodnik with babes is like tempting an         
    Eskimo with an air conditioner...                                        
                                                                             
    Directed by PETER PERRY (Kiss Me Quick) and produced by noted            
    exploitation film distributor DAN SONNEY ('Money by Sonney'), My Tale    
    is Hot (a.k.a. Always on Monday and Panties Inferno) is a typically      
    silly sixties nudie cutie. (It's billed as a 'fanny-see in living        
    Skin-a-Scope' with the cast listed 'in order of exposure.' Har-de        
    har-har.) The threadbare plot is liberally peppered with                 
    elbow-in-the-ribs humor, most of it courtesy of Little Jack Little,      
    the diminutive veteran of burleycue and nudie cutie films (Not           
    Tonight Henry!, Everybody Loves It).                                     
                                                                             
    Even by skinflick standards, the production values are more              
    impoverished than usual but the budgetary deficiency is a moot point,    
    really, because nude cutie producers weren't concerned about anything    
    as trivial as cinematic 'art.' They just wanted to exhibit as much       
    female flesh as they could get away with. And the epidermal count        
    here is quite high.                                                      
                                                                             
    But My Tale is Hot's chief claim to fame is a four-minute dance          
    routine showcasing legendary stripper CANDY BARR. This footage (circa    
    1956) is randomly inserted into the proceedings, earning her a           
    'Special Guest Star' billing and allowing the filmmakers to exploit      
    her notoriety. (She made national headlines when a marijuana bust        
    landed her in prison.) In contrast to Lili St. Cyr and Tempest Storm,    
    both of whom made numerous features and shorts, there's very little      
    footage that exists of the busty, baby faced Miss Barr, and almost       
    nothing of her strip act. Discounting the infamous stag reel Smart       
    Aleck and a few nudie loops, Candy's film output was virtually           
    nonexistent, so her dance routine in this film should be of great        
    interest to striptease scholars everywhere.
