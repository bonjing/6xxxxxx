Rosen has partnered with Britannica Educational Publishing to produce several series of what is called â€œcirculating reference.â€ The title reviewed here is part of the Britannica Guide to the Worldâ€™s Most Influential People series. Other titles in the series are The 100 Most Influential Inventors of All Time, The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time, The 100 Most Influential Painters & Sculptors of the Renaissance, The 100 Most Influential Philosophers of All Time, The 100 Most Influential Scientists of All Time, The 100 Most Influential World Leaders of All Time,and The 100 Most Influential Writers of All Time. The editors are Britannica contributors or editors. The intended audience is grades 9â€“12. The titles in the Britannica Guide to the Worldâ€™s Most Influential People series are arranged chronologically. For example, The 100 Most Influential Women of All Time begins with Hatshepsut and ends with Diana, Princess of Wales. Overall, the selections offer a good balance of gender, nationality, and ethnicity. Articles, a mix of new content and content drawn from Britannicaâ€™s repository, generally range from two to five pages and are headed with date and place of birth and, where applicable, death. There are no article-specific bibliographies or references. Each volume concludes with a glossary, a brief further-reading list, and an index. Although not visually enticing, these volumes offer trustworthy information in convenient packages and would be useful in high-school and public libraries. Other series resulting from the Rosen-Britannica partnership include America at War, An Explorerâ€™s Guide to the Universe, Islamic History, Turning Points in History, and U. S. Government: The Separation of Powers, with more to come. Grades 9-12. --Mary Ellen Quinn
