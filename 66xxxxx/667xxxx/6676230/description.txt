        War In The Gulf: Desert Storm: Desert Victory

        The Gulf War of 1991 ended in an overwhelming victory for  the
        allied coalition forces. Concluding Video Ordnances quartet of
        War in the Gulf documentaries, "Desert Storm - Desert Victory"
        goes  beyond  simply  recounting  the  events  of  the  war by
        analyzing  the  vital  military  lessons  of  Operation Desert
        Storm. Using actual combat footage of the preparations for the
        war and the final campaigns, this programme provides a  unique
        perspective  on  the   strategies  and  tactics   employed  in
        Operation Desert Storm.

        How  did  the  lessons of  the  Vietnam  War influence  allied
        strategy and tactics? Why  were the coalition air  forces able
        to strike with impunity? Why  did the Iraqi Air Force  abandon
        the air battle  and flee to  Iran? What was  the role of  Arab
        forces  in  the  coalition  victory?  How  did  the  coalition
        commander like  General Schwarzkopf  influnce the  battle? How
        will the experiences of the  Gulf War influence the future  of
        the world's armed forces?

        Learn how modern training  programmes and combat tactics  have
        made technology  so much  more effective  on th  ebattlefield.
        This  programme,  produced  in  confunction  with  a  team  of
        military analysts explores the reasons for the stunning Desert
        Victory.
