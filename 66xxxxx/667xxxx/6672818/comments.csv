,MySecrets,2011-09-13T19:24Z,I don't think this guide is helpful at all. Those settings don't make sense.
,mysticmerlin666,2011-09-14T13:40Z,It seems to work fine Thanks
,MySecrets,2011-09-14T15:17Z,"No, it does not ""work fine.""

The download link for utorrent is not from the original site, and is broken. The Utorrent site was hacked yesterday and the utorrent downloads were infected with malware. For all we know, the broken download in this manual pointed to the malware.

It instructs people to disable uPnP port mapping and NAT-PMP port mapping, which will cut them off from being reachable. It also tells people to set the global maximum upload rate to 10 kB/s, regardless of their real upload rate."

,RedMatrix,2011-09-15T13:08Z,Here's a secret to making downloading torrents fast: Seed MORE than you download.
,MySecrets,2011-09-21T13:27Z,"Sorry, but having a positive ratio won't make your downloads faster. This guide just doesn't work."

,a_goddly82,2011-10-11T11:19Z,does this work? 10kbs max?
[T],ktetch,2011-10-17T06:45Z,"Ok garbage, utter garbage. You've got 100 glabla connections, which is ok for 256kbit upload, but then 75-per torrent, which is a bit high.

What you don't seem to get is that settings depend on your upload speed. What works for you, doesn't work for everyone. And your settings are less than optimal anyway.

If you don't know what you're talking about, don't tell others what to do. Anyone that follows this guide, is likely to end up on my hall of morons. Hell, I think I'll add fiesta569 to it anyway, for this crap."
,thorofdenmark,2011-10-29T14:24Z,uTorrent 3 sucks!!!! 
,kepler42,2011-12-05T07:23Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, NOR ÂľTorrent V3,
