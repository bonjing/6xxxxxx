Strike Fighters 2 is a PC game (Combat / Flight Simulator) that primarily centers on a fictitious conflict in the Middle East between the Kingdom of Dhimar and the Empire of Paran from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Although the countries and conflict may not be real, the aircraft and weapons used are completely accurate. The conflict is modeled as a typical Cold War era 'proxy' war between the USA and USSR where Dhimar gets help from the US and Paran uses imported Soviet equipment and expertise.

Third Wire Productions developed the game based on the original Strike Fighters: Project 1 but had to be vastly rewritten to work with the Vista platform. In doing so the latest graphical, Artificial Intelligence, and features were written into the simulation.

In April 2009, Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam was released, followed in June 2009 by Strike Fighters 2: Europe, and by Strike Fighters 2: Israel in October 2009. Expansion Pack 1 (for Strike Fighters 2: Israel) was released in June 2010 and Expansion Pack 2 (for Strike Fighters 2: Europe) followed on December 1, 2010. All of the games (except the expansion packs) can be installed stand-alone, or they can be merged to make all the stock aircraft available in all games.

No DRM, so no crack.
