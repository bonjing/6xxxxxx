Just A Quick Question - Was Wondering When You Would Be Able To Upload The Hangover 2 And Kung Fu Panda 2.Great Stuff Mate - Keep Up The Good Work!!!
I Know I've Said This Before But I'm Going To Say It Again, The Pirate Bay Should Be Renamed ""THE EXTREMEZONE.""

Obviosly durbois and out patient didn't read your comment in offering to upload the guy's request. Maybe you should check with these two IDIOTS before you do any work at all, including taking a crap. TY for your work and ALL your uploads including REQUEST'S"
