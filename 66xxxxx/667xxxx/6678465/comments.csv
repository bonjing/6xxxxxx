,killthestate,2011-09-16T20:03Z,"when clicked to download it shows 1.10mb not 7.88gb... Sounds odd to me, be careful"
,GalitShpichter,2011-09-16T20:26Z,"Sorry, it's my fault. Because the folders of the book list folder have the same names as the main folders bitTorrent shows the main folders as located in the 00.Book List folder. You should double click on the 1.10 mb folder and all the 7.88 GB content should open up."
,killthestate,2011-09-19T00:33Z,I saw that It just looked kinda funny lol... will download and comment again.
,killthestate,2011-09-19T02:29Z,"All looks good. Thanks for the up, and I apologize, just seemed out of place. "
,Aimier_59,2011-10-14T18:40Z,I simply cannot dowload the pack! It does not allow me to do anything! I cannot grasp that 1.8 MB folder in order to have it double-clicked! Heeeelp!
,Aimier_59,2011-10-14T18:42Z, previous message mistake corrected [ download ]
