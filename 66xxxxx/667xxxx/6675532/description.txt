Aircraft Taxiing and Parking â€” Aerosoft AES:
In UK2000 Gatwick Xtreme v 3.01 you can use of Aerosoft AES (latest version + 4 credits) to help you get from the runway and taxi to the gates and vice versa, ie taxi from the gates to the runway.If you decide to taxi or park without AES, you can follow the FSX arrows to the gate.When you get to the â€œrun inâ€ to the gate you see a â€˜docking boardâ€ which has lights or an electronic device to guide you to the parking (docking) spot so that the plane can be disembarked.There are NO animated Jetways (Air bridges) at UK 2000 Gatwick, you either use the default jetways, or you can use AES which provides these and/or stairs (plus other features) to disembark passengers.
