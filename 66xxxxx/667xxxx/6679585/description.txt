When She Rules, She Reigns. The verdict is in, and the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Judge Judith Sheindlin is Second To None. Back due to thunderous appeal with another full docket of patently outrageous cases, the one-and-only Judge Judy reigns supreme as she rules the airwaves with an iron gavel (Entertainment Weekly). Packed with wit & wisdom from Judge Judy; half-baked, acrimonious arguments from loopy litigants; and must-see bonus footage, this DVD is guilty on all counts of being excessively entertaining!
