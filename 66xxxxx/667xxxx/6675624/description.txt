Game consoles have evolved to become complex computer systems that may contain evidence to assist in a criminal investigation. From networking capabilities to chat, voicemail, streaming video and email, the game consoles of today are unrecognizable from complex computer systems. With over 10 million XBOX 360s sold in the United States the likelihood that a criminal investigator encounters an XBOX 360 is a certainty. The digital forensics community has already begun to receive game consoles for examination, but there is no map for them to follow as there may be with other digital media. XBOX 360 Forensics provides that map and present the information for the examiners in an easy to read, easy to read format.
