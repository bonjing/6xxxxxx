,bartman2589,2011-09-13T13:26Z,"@mrwolfy - maybe you should get a decent computer if you're having problems with syncing, I've never once had a problem with syncing from VTV.  The only problem I've had is that occasionally the credits get cut off."
,mrwolfy,2011-09-13T18:08Z,"it's not VTV i'm complaining about it's POW4 releases, everyone of their releases i've downloaded has been out of sync."
