Stairs are a fundamental and universal feature of buildings. The late Alan Blanc had a lifetime's obsession with stairs and steps and provided a definitive reference source that bridges the aesthetic and practical aspects of staircase design. His wife Sylvia, who worked with him on the first edition, presents this updated, abridged version alongside a complimentary web site where the historical elements of the subjects are described and discussed in pictures and diagrams.

The book is a practical guide to designing circulation spaces. It is extensively detailed with working drawings and photographs. Construction methods using a variety of materials are discussed as well as the influence of new technology on vertical circulation. The guidance on codes and regulations covers the UK and US. The latest high profile international case studies inspire and inform the reader.
