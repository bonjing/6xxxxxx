download the server from minecraft.net, thats all."
,theend068,2011-09-17T01:44Z,it loads and everything but for some reason it starts with sound and music off. If i try to turn it on it crashes. If I modify the options.txt file to turn on music there it won't start. Any ideas?
,Booty_Jabber,2011-09-17T20:43Z,"@Maurosso

http://www.Google.com/
Google how to crack a minecraft server.

@anilem

You do have to crack the server once downloaded, So that other people with a cracked game can play."
,anilem,2011-09-18T19:39Z,@Booty_Jabber: set the option online-mode to false isnt cracking ;)
,SmokeTheChron,2011-09-19T19:34Z,"For custom online servers with free custom skins and capes, use mineshafter@ www.mineshafter.appspot.com   Also, in the server.properties file (config) set your server to ''online-mode false'' and that will allow anyone to connect, whether purchased or ''stand-a-lone'' as I like to call it ;D Mineshafter is hella legit and I use it every day."

1) Go into the directory it was saved in. Standard is C:Users'username'Application Data.minecraft
(Application Data is normally hidden. Although I couldn't find it from hidden, so I typed it in the top.)
2) In there is a file 'Minecraft Updater.exe' open that. Should bring up Minecraft.
3) Check the box 'force update' just below your name.
Hit enter and it should update. It may state that it cannot connect to the Minecraft Server, just try again.
