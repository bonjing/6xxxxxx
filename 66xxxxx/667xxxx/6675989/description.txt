Zentimo is a powerful external drive manager.It saves time and extends user abilities on active work with flash-drives, portable drives, card readers and other gadgets.

Handy menu to control devices:

This menu is aimed to do the most frequent tasks in a click and allows you to:
-See device drive size or empty space
-Rename a device-Change a device image-Hide a device from the menu-Scan for hardware changes-Stop all devices at once

Drive letter management:

Portable application quick launcher:
=====================================
Just a small menu where you can add programs\files\folders from your portable drive for quick launch 

Real Safe Device Removal:
==========================-Display of processes preventing the device from being stopped...-... and the ability to kill these processes ...-... or just to unlock them from the device-Hotkeys to stop a device or call the menu-Stopping of all devices at once-Ability to stop SATA drives-Returning just stopped device back

Honest Drive Speed Test:
=========================
Most other drive speed testers measure only the read\write speed of large files, displaying a theoretical drive speed. This is not related to real-life speed as we often write plenty of small files to external drives.

Our investigations show that some flash drives perform worse than others when writing small files, but perform equally well when writing large files.

Zentimo measures the file read\write speeds of 3 different file sizes: small files (32 KB), medium files (3 MB) and large files (100 MB) and displays all those measurements as well as an average. The average speed calculated by Zentimo reflects your drives real performance more accurately than characteristics from the vendor's specification. 

What's the difference from USB Safely Remove?
==============================================
USB Safely Remove is our another similiar program which is less powerful than Zentimo but has simpler UI.
