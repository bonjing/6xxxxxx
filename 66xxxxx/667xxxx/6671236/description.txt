Cypherpunkd EP008: JustLive.us - A Self Sufficient Revolution - Ben Godwin


Ben Godwin from the awesome website: JustLive.us joins us for a chat. Ben talks about the sites origin, design and goals. We discuss agorism, mutual aid, self-sufficiency, Direct Action, diverse groups moving into agoric activity, the building of alternate systems to replace the Failed States and the Snake Oil they have been peddling, people looking for and building systems to solve their real world problems â€“ now.

Ben and Harold have a new project in the works?
