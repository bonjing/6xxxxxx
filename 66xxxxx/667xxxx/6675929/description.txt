    Infirm Thomas Felton (Leslie Daniels) tells his young wife Samantha      
    (Rosalba Neri) that he wants his nephew Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon) to      
    run their ranch. Samantha responds by having her brother Pedro (Louis    
    Vanner/Luigi Vannucchi) bump Felton off. She then blames a fall-guy      
    for Felton's death and employs her ex-lover-cum-bounty killer,           
    Lawrence Jerome Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin), to shoot the patsy down.    
    When it transpires that Felton has actually willed the ranch to his      
    nephew, Samantha instructs both Carradine and Pedro and his men to       
    eliminate Johnny.
