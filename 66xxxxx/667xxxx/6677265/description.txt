Sex at 24 Frames Per Second (Video 2003) 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383630/

R Rated version

Directors Adrian Lyne and Paul Verhoeven moderate this in-depth documentary that examines the uneasy relationship between sex and Hollywood. Focusing on superstars, including Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Jean Harlow, Diane Lane and Sharon Stone, this tantalizing film is a primer about screen sirens and the behind-the-scenes battles that often occurred to get their steamiest scenes past the censors.
