 Intricate and subtle family relationships are the focus 
 of this perceptive film written by Academy              
 Award-winning screenwriter Horton Foote (author of      
 Tender Mercies). Actor Hume Cronyn turns in a           
 brilliantly understated performance as widower John     
 Webb, an elderly Texas farmer who is trying to cope     
 with the loss of his wife and what seems to be a sudden 
 lack of purpose in his life. When an oil company        
 expresses an interest in drilling on his land, Webb's   
 relatives suddenly see a chance for fast cash, and his  
 placid demeanor is sorely tested. While Cronyn takes    
 center stage, this production from the Showtime network 
 also benefits from a wonderful cast that includes James 
 Earl Jones, Shelley Duvall, Ed Begley Jr., and Frederic 
 Forrest. The Texas setting is beautifully depicted,     
 with Foote's screenplay providing poignant local        
 touches to illuminate the lives of the characters.      
 While the pace is not terribly fast, a momentum does    
 develop, and the motivations of everyone--including     
 greedy nephews, irresponsible daughters, obnoxious      
 children, and, thankfully, some kindly old              
 friends--slowly emerge. This is a story both gentle and 
 gripping. Cronyn gives his character a quiet dignity,   
 and his masterful performance and the unavoidable       
 family conflicts give the film a remarkable resonance.
