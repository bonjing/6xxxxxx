Most probably you are not in India - a 3rd graded 3rd world bullshit country ! don't worry ! if you show me respect i never use defamatory language ! 

i use 2 mbps bandwidth with ( 2:00 - 8:00 ) unlimited ! confused ! let me explain ! i only get 6 hours when i can get with 50 kbps up speed in a whole day ( from morning 2:00 to morning 8:00 ) ! it's not always possible for me to awake always in the mid night & seed ! then i have to stop my connection within 8:00 ! otherwise i have to spend a lot of money !

My Limitations : ---

1. Network Error .

2. Server Down .

3. Power Cut .

Network Error : --- I have to make constant monitoring in this 4 /6 hours ! after some 1 /2 hour my net connection is disconnected in a regular basis !  my service provider do not like that people get full access in this 6 hours ! remember my friend this is the best optimized service in India ! This is not USA / South Korea / Japan / Netherlands / Canada / Sweden where you can enjoy with 20 /30/ 50 mbps speed ! 

2. Server Down - Many a times my server gets stuck ! in that time i count stars in the heavens !

3. Power Cut - Do you want any explanation on this topic ?

Yes, I agree with your opinion ! compressing a 2gb file to 350 mb file make a loss of pic quality but not in a great amount ! learn about modern softwares like megui & ripbot. search d following link, you get the desired answer !

http://thepiratebay.org/user/StyLishSaLH

Generally i use WinX DVD Ripper , Xilisoft Video Converter, virtual dub, Cucusoft , megui, ripbot, Video Charge, Wondershare, DVD decrypter, autogk, damon tools etc softwares ! so there is no question about my quality ! but d point is about compression !

whenever i try to up Bengali movie i have to up 2.1 - 2.5 ratio even 3.0 to complete my task ! whereas in Hindi / English / Porn - within 1.2 -1.3 ratio i complete my task ! these Bengali people ( 90 % ) are so cheap with their 3rd class mentality blockage problem that they always suppress their upload limit & after finish their d/l they just vanish within a moment without helping others ! so, many a times I see 2-3 completed and only i was seeding & 75% - *80 % job done ! what to say ? think about it !!! now next day (after finishing 10 -20 complete d/l ) i again see there is no seed ! so, instead of doing a fresh task, again i have to seed my previous task !

previously i up Bye Bye Bangkok - 1.77 Gb. my share ratio indicates its 2.27 equals to 4 gb ! so in a day i only can manage to up 800 - 900 mb ! so i need 4-5 days to fish a movie !!! I ask you my friend is that possible for anyone !

i have a solution ! request comcast to open their business here ! i assure my fried if i had 10 mbps unlimited bandwidth i can fulfill your wish because i purchase every single Bengali film available in the market !

if you have other question, ask me, a give clarification but do not repeat your asking ? thanks ! "
,Robin5555,2011-09-16T04:16Z,"@ tony_star

I would like to ask you a question mate ! there are 100 million Bengali guys over the whole world ! i have been uploading almost 4 months ! but why do not find any helping hand here ! why ? what others doing ? it's because our selfish mentality ! we always want everything but do not share, do not want to up, never want to help others, we are always contest to unnecessary politics, without appreciating others hard works criticize others, but not doing any real work ! that's we the poor Bengali people ! Poor 3rd world's Beggars !

USA - 1st God !

European Countries - 2nd God !

India - Maid Servants Available For The 1st World ! 

We truly deserve to be treated like 3rd world's people not for our black screen but for our blackish stupid hypocrite mentality !

We must welcome the British again to get a minimum freedom, a minimum respect, a minimum rise, a minimum prosperity ! we lost all these minimum things by getting our fucking Independence !

It's a malediction that I'm Indian ! It was a malediction that I was born In India !

,depakdash,2011-09-16T10:24Z,"I'm not a bengali, so neither i can download this torrent from 1 of my favourite uploader nor i can understand what tony star's comment is . But from Robinda's reply it seems that tony is raising question about quality of his torrents .

To tony,
- Bengali movies ( or any other india's state oriented movies ) are rare to be uploaded .
- Ripping at such s small size is an art and uploading takes time too.
- We should praise the uploader like Robinda for their time, money and art. Coz there are very people in world who van share all 3 qualities.
- Next time try to download a rip in a size like this anf continuously try to seef that before you post a commemt , then u will reslise how difficult the job is .

To Robinda
- There are people like me who sincerly thank you for your efforts.
- Being an Indian , i want to state that neither all other indians ( including my bengali brothers and sisters) are narrow minded nor cheap 3rd world countryman.
- A country like india , it's rich culture, religion,language, people can't be and shouldn't be blamed for a few downloaders who don't want to share .
- Sorry Robinda , but it's a truth that 99% of downloaders are here just for quick hit and run. But the power of the rest 1% is enough to make a site like TPB among the top 100 sites of the world.

Tnkx to everybody who take their time to read this lengthy comment and srry in advance to all those whom i might have insulted.

Long live INDIA ..."
,depakdash,2011-09-16T11:14Z,"Btw, Robinda if you have time pz do reply in your '' the emperor caligula '' thread.
Tnkx again for your efforts."

i find at least one like you who understands why i wrote those words ! where lies the sorrow ! thanks.."
,Robin5555,2011-09-16T11:57Z,"Who are downloading my torrent please note, my network connection is down ! i made a complain already ! so service must be interrupted ! it's not in my hand ! keep patience !"
[T],tdkdemon,2011-09-17T10:04Z,"@Robin5555 ....

hey buddy i came here for something else and i by chance looked at your reply for tony ....

you are an awesome ripper & uploader buddy no offence...

i totally understand your 512-2mbps problem...of gettin unlimited access on 2-8am alone...

a 500 rupees plan/month i guess....

yeh we all are born in India...even circumstances make us feel a 1st world country is a better place to live....

But instead of yelling at it ... we are here ...born in india and lets see what we can do with what we have instead of worrrying of what we dont have....(20/30...mbps connection maybe ...)

ok... i will give you two simple solutions for your problem buddy..

1. You may switch to a 512 kbps unlimited connection 24 hrs at 700-800 rs
i guess you got it there....

2.For Your RATIO PROBLEM ... i guess you seed upto 3.0 ration to complete a movie seeding...

If u r usin u-torrent

then you can complete your seeding with 1-1.5 ratio itself...
Its callled ""INITIAL SEEDING""

Here are the steps...(incase you dont know abt it yet)

right click on the torrent u r seeding - properties - then check initial seeding...

thats it...

Now u will seed a data piece only once in INITIAL SEEDING...

whr as u must seed again n again d same piece in NORMAL SEEDING....

3.And you can also use timers on u-torrent to seed and download only at 2-8pm on specific days you desire....

Google it buddy(chck u-torrent forums)...its there...

I guess this might solve most of your problems....

CHEERS....No matter What We R INDIANS After All And We Can find the easy way out of our probs......lol...

[T],tdkdemon,2011-09-17T10:14Z,"@tony...

Ripping in this size is not that easy....
i dont knw wat u said but frm robins reactions i guess u criticised his quality...

You must thank him for what he s doing...
its lucky that you got an hardcore bengali torrent uploader n ripper...

which is itself RARE of its kind...."
,robinhood84,2011-09-17T11:45Z,Robin da very nice uploads... chaplin tar jonno wait korchi.. let me know if i can help
,robinhood84,2011-09-17T11:56Z,i recommend robin da opens a pay pal account and we all contribute for highest / fastest always available torrents for all bengalis worldwide. robin da consider stopping porn.. not good use of your bandwidth and its available in plenty.. only if u get the moonmoon sen one ever that every bengali knows about but hasnt seen then its an exception 
,Robin5555,2011-09-17T12:39Z,"@ robinhood84

mate, i do not need money, i need your love only, & for moonmoon sen - i have a large collection of porns, i heard that rumor in my childhood ! but trust me my friend, you can not find a single guy who have ever managed to see that porn in his life ! it's only a rumor ! thnx.."
,tony_star,2011-09-17T17:32Z,"@ Robin5555 ,
Thank You for your reply. I definitely understand your situation. I appreciate your hard effort. I was concerned about the size because it gets blur in big screen. but it's okay. I can manage, after all you had to try hard to make the picture quality good as much as possible and at the smallest size, and also awake all night uploading it. seriously i salute you bro. Don't need to be harsh on Indians. we don't bother as long as we have some people like you, who loves to share and care *(and Moonmoon sen :D )*.
Robin Rocks \,,,,/

Remember 30 min = 100 mb. it's 122min, so it's 400 mb. but i added extra 25 mb for betterment ! but to my next all uploads i'll add 50 mb extra, but not possible more for that, thanks & be happy !"
