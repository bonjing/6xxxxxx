[/b][/color] Royal Navy: Submarine Mission is a documentary series which follows the crew on the hunter-killer class submarine HMS Turbulent.
Captain Ryan Ramsey and his 130 crew are getting ready for a mission that will see them stay underwater for 100 days as they patrol the pirate-infested waters surrounding the Horn of Africa.
The uprising in Libyan though means the submarine is forced to plot a new course towards Tripoli, where the crew will have to protect civilians caught up in the conflict.
