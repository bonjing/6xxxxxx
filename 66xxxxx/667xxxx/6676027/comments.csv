if yes... then please see if you can upload the Bluray 720p. if not.. then i will go for the HDDVD"

[V],GoodFilms,2011-09-15T01:10Z,"lol, the aspect ratio is correct, but it isn't technically 720p (should be 1200*720). this is better than the repack tho!

@abhikrit. There is no difference in quality between HDDVD and blu-ray."
,abhikrit,2011-09-15T06:31Z,thanks both of you..
,Delsher,2011-09-15T09:07Z,"Hey could you upload some blu-ray rips of The Polar Express and Bad Santa in 1080p?

1920*1080?"
,VelvetMirror,2011-10-09T19:19Z,"There is an annoying background noise throughout all the movie. 

Is this the repack release?"
