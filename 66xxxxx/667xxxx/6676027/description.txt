***IMP Note*** :
OEM is the most f**ked up scene group.according to imdb AR is 1.667:1 aka avg 16:10. So in my eyes this rls is perfect. But I'm aware that they have rlsed a repack. Why I don't know. The repack has 16:9 AR aka streched pixels aka utter crap aka wastage of my 4.42 gig which I'll have to seed back.
