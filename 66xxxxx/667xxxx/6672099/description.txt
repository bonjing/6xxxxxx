This is the series premiere of the new CW show The Secret Circle. Cassie Blakes world is turned upside down after her mother dies in a mysterious accident, forcing Cassie to move in with her loving grandmother Jane in the small town of Chance Harbor, Washington. While trying to adjust to her new life, Cassie is befriended by Diana Meade, a sweet-natured classmate who offers to show her around and introduces her to mean-girl Faye, her sidekick Melissa and Cassies next door neighbor Nick. 

Things get complicated when she meets Adam, Dianas boyfriend, with whom she feels an instant and powerful connection. Upon meeting one of her mothers childhood friends, Dawn Chamberlain, the school principal and Fayes mother, Cassie begins to wonder why her mother never spoke of her hometown. When strange and dangerous things begin to happen, Cassies new friends are forced to tell her their secret - they are all witches and her arrival will complete the Circle. However, the Circle has not been drawn together again by chance - Dianas father, Charles Meade has plans of his own for the group.
