After a mysterious and bloody airplane crash, 48 survivors are left stranded on a Pacific Island... miles off course. It soon becomes apparent that they will not have to cope only with the forces of nature, but with the island\\\\\\\'s secrets, including the Dharma Initiative, the \\\\\\\'Lost Numbers\\\\\\\', the \\\\\\\"others\\\\\\\" (or hostiles) and the strange black smoke- to name a few. There is also much more than meets the eye, as it becomes apparent that everyone is connected in some way and that everyone has a purpose to live on the island... and for some, to die.

I\\\\\\\'ve noticed there were no other uploads with the Lost series in portable format. So I\\\\\\\'ve encoded the whole load in .m4v format.

Download, seed, and enjoy!
