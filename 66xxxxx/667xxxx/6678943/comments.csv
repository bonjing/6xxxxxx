I have been seeding but have paused at 100GBs, which is what I have upload so far.

Anyway great and many many thanks "

,Freebs,2011-09-20T19:15Z,"We had a bit of a problem with the fiberglass switch at home (turns out we had to reset it), so the last 2 days our internet was severly cut down. Now it's uploading at 9 MB/s again, but I'm gonna have to cut it a bit to prevent further problems."
,Freebs,2011-09-29T19:15Z,"I noticed that episode 13 of season 4 has the wrong audio. Appearantly it's some special where some producers are rambling on about random stuff.

Download the replacement here:

You can choose what do download in your torrent client. At least I know that works in uTorrent. Just tick the boxes. "
