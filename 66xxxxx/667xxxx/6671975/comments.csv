,grafkaal,2011-09-15T13:00Z,Why mkv this time and not the usual mp4? 
[T],aularon,2011-09-15T13:17Z,"@grafkaal it's the same x264 video and aac audio streams, just packaged in an mkv container rather than the mp4 I previously used.

The reason I changed to mkv is mainly to keep everything in one file, the video itself plus the subtitle files, plus some more space for tagging data.

You can easily remux this and change the container to mp4 using the same audio/video streams (no conversion or any quality loss) if you like."
