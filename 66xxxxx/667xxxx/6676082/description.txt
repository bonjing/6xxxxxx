Nut growing has become more popular and technology has developed significantly over the last 5 years. This book is the starting point for prospective commercial nut growers â€“ large or small scale, for farmers who want to diversify and also for gardeners interested in growing nut trees in their back yards.

Nut Grower's Guide is the first comprehensive book to growing almonds, cashews, chestnuts, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pistachios and walnuts. All aspects of site selection are covered, from soil and climate to aspect and topography through to previous land use and local pest species. Soil preparation, irrigation, planting and propagating trees are also covered. It covers the cultivation and processing of each of the major nut species and also provides guidance on packaging and the wholesale and retail marketing of nuts in Australia and overseas.
