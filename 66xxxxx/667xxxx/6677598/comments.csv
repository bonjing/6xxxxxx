,Nuchem,2011-11-02T20:54Z,"I really appreciate the upload, was planning on seeding to a 1.0 ratio, but I can't get the torrent to re-check, then seed, because I changed the directories in Utorrent preferences, & when I tried to correct the ""missing files"", it didn't work. If anybody wants to help me get this seeding again I will gladly do so.

I use Windows Live Messenger, contact me there about re-seeding this torrent. In Windows Live Messenger use biochemistryone@hotmail.com as ""your friends email address""."
,Nuchem,2011-11-02T22:29Z,Never mind I figured it out shortly after my first comment. I will seed to a 1.0 ratio now.
