This book provides specific information on the food and culture of each of the 195 countries in the world. Designed to be consistent and concise, it uses an outline format that details the cultural factors related to food ( such as geography, ethnic group, religions and education) and the food itself ( such as typical dishes, special occasion foods, meals and service and street food and snacks). Its goal is to help readers develop multicultural competence and cultural sensitivity so they are more equipped to provide adequate food service, nutrition education, and health care to an increasingly diverse population.

Some features for each country entry include:
COUNTRY NAME (Official Name)

Geography location and topography
Major Languages
Ethnic Groups and % of population in each group
Major Religions Official religion and % of population affiliated with each religion
Agriculture chief crops and livestock
Brief History
Industries

A perfect blend of culture and food, this is a great resource for anyone in the food service industry!
