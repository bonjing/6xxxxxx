,countkurt,2011-09-13T22:54Z,Link to an un-dubbed version would be appreciated...
,tattu56,2011-09-14T12:44Z,"I appreciate the uploads, but this Dubbed business is bad karma, give me subtitles any day..   

America! and their constant crappy remakes of perfectly good movies. Arrogance at it's best. (I only speak English BTW)"
,BunBun4life,2011-09-25T06:53Z,"Damn you fuckers, quit blaming 'america' for everything.  The UK also speaks english, and keeping in mind, young people, blacks and hispanics are not going to read subtitles and that's well over 1/3 of the country.  I always want the original audio, and my son even at the age of ten agreed."
,kuiba,2011-09-26T04:00Z,"BunBun4life - F*#k you mean, man? Quit harshing my mellow! Your comment is naff (and if you don't know what means, look it up)! Quit dissing young people, blacks and hispanics. I happen to be from England, young, 1/2 black and 1/2 hispanic and I watch tons of foreign films. Yes, I even read the subtitles. Get your redneck arse back to the Appalachians."
