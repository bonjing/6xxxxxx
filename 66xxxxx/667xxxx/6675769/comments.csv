Cool story bro "
,pingpongkong,2011-10-22T12:02Z,The guy doing these sounds quit his job to work with it. He is just one guy and barely make a living from this and he is a genuinly nice person. Now you are destroying it for him. You should be ASHAMED of yourself!!!!
,Turiel666,2011-10-23T13:44Z,"@pingpongkong
And what are you doing in torrent sites? download movies,games,mp3s,etc?!?!?! You should be ASHAMED of yourself TOO"
,pingpongkong,2011-10-23T16:40Z,@Turiel666 No. I registered to try and stop this torrent. It is one thing to share things from huge corporations like sony etc who will get by in any case. but when it hurts one-man companies who depend on their product to make a a living it is very different. Iì±„m sure you actually agree. Please reconsider and do the right thing. If not well... . I'm giving you a chance. Some times sharing things like this can destroy things for nice people.
