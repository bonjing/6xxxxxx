,mnload,2011-09-30T00:52Z,THANK YOU! Was looking for a working solution for such a long time!
,mnload,2011-09-30T00:53Z,"It worked without ""Little Snitch"" for me, I just turned the Internet off in general while pasting the given serial!"
,Kamori,2011-10-18T03:55Z,"Followed the instructions, except I did not use Little Snitch, I just denied the app from accepting incoming connections (via standard firewall pop-ups). Works great, thank you =)"
,okiwan,2011-10-27T08:33Z,"Works like a charm *apparently* without using LittleSnitch...just make sure your Internet connection is turned off before registering (maybe the daemon connects in a future and that's the reason why the author mentions the utility). Anyhow, thank you BoMcM!"
