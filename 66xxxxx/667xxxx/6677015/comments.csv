Any chance you can have another go at this one?"
,util.arraylist,2011-09-16T01:48Z,"Thanks g8aso, I was about to download this.
Can someone repost it, please? Make sure you use a good ripper like EAC or foobar2000. ;)"

,util.arraylist,2011-09-16T21:03Z,"Used to be pointless. But now space is cheap, there's no reason not to use it. Besides, you might not hear the difference vs. a 320k mp3, but if you look at a spectrum vis. you'll clearly see it."
[V],dickspic,2011-09-16T22:27Z,check the log ripped by EAC 100% log accepted by What.cd
,gazzadayidd,2011-09-17T01:46Z,so fuckin un-gratefull !!!! many thanks for your upload !!
,util.arraylist,2011-09-17T04:20Z,"Decided to test it, and turns out it's fine. Thanks a lot dickspic.
g8aso, what player are you using?

In case anyone is still doubting, I can guarantee it's ripped from a lossless source, it's clearly visible with a spectrum analyzer (it goes all the way up to 22KHz)."
[V],dickspic,2011-09-17T07:45Z,util.arraylist thank you for the time and effort to show this upload is ok.
