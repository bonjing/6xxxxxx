British singer-songwriter Laura Marling announced her long-anticipated third lp, A Creature I Donâ€™t Know, a couple of weeks ago and earlier this week she shared the album details for the record. A Creature I Donâ€™t Know will be released on September 13 via Virgin Records and itâ€™ll be produced by Ethan Johns, and you can view the tracklist below and album cover above.

Marlingâ€™s image seems to change slightly with every record, from callow youth to brunette ingenue and now world-wearied and wised up. Her voice has aged and grown richer with her, the more lived-in vocal of I Speak Because I Can now developing into something earthier and far, far beyond her years (not too far past 21). With maturity comes great responsibility towards your songwriting, and on first listen thatâ€™s something sheâ€™s capable too of facing up to. As with the last album it was recorded in a room by Ethan Johns, meaning it develops as it goes not in the heavy-handed Mumfords crescendo sense but steadily growing strings, multi-tracked backing vocals and Marling coming to terms with her emotions. Three minutes it breaks into a trot of west coast folk-rock of a thankfully restrained hue and then weâ€™re talking, not to mention looking forward to Septemberâ€™s A Creature I Donâ€™t Know.

Laura Marlingâ€™s third lp was originally scheduled for release last year, but the touring in support of her second album I Speak Because I Can which was released last year came in the way. Her third record will be called A Creature I Donâ€™t Know and while the title has been known for a while today the album was officially announced with a September release scheduled â€“ according to The Line Of Best Fit the exact release date will be September 12 and the album will be released on Virgin Records. Considering the sheer quality of I Speak Because I Can and the excellent album preview which was released today Iâ€™m beyond excited about this, especially considering that Ethan Johns is producing it.

The track Sophia:

The delicate opening chords and the lyrics, which speak of a loverâ€™s betrayal and the aftermath of an unfulfilling one night stand (â€œWhoâ€™s been touching my skin?/ Who have I been letting in?/ Shy and tired eyed am I todayâ€) sound bound up in the same rum, post-coital world of â€˜I Speak Because I Canâ€™. But very quickly, the track grows wings and flies out of the shadowy hinterlands of that album. Electric guitars, a string quartet and multi-tracked Lauras swoop in, suggesting a new sturdiness and defiance in the singerâ€™s outlook.

Soon after the track mutates into a kind of country-rock anthem. Jangly guitars hip-pop next to each other, whilst Marlingâ€™s harmonies shimmer Linda Ronstadt-like all the while intoning the name of the songâ€™s heroine.
