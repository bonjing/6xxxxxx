This self-contained textbook gives a thorough exposition of multivariable calculus. The emphasis is on correlating general concepts and results of multivariable calculus with their counterparts in one-variable calculus. Further, the book includes genuine analogues of basic results in one-variable calculus, such as the mean value theorem and the fundamental theorem of calculus.

This book is distinguished from others on the subject: it examines topics not typically covered, such as monotonicity, bimonotonicity, and convexity, together with their relation to partial differentiation, cubature rules for approximate evaluation of double integrals, and conditional as well as unconditional convergence of double series and improper double integrals. Each chapter contains detailed proofs of relevant results, along with numerous examples and a wide collection of exercises of varying degrees of difficulty, making the book useful to undergraduate and graduate students alike.
