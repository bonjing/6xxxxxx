Transformers 3 Dark Of The Moon Prequel â€“ Foundation #2

Itâ€™s an interesting task for writer John Barber to provide an official prequel for the upcoming Transformers movie. After all, this being the third in a trilogy, a prequel seems a bit superfluous. Nevertheless, Barber is continually excavating the mythos of the silver screen Transformers and providing an interesting, if predictable back story, to the events soon to be happening at your local cinema. While some may bristle at the presumption IDW has in establishing an â€œofficialâ€ history for the the Michael Bay films, at this point, with a property so tangled up with multiple incarnations and fractured continuity, anything goes.

Watching Optimus Prime and Megatron during their golden heyday makes for interesting material. These two diametrically opposed characters, staples of the classic dichotomy of good versus bad cartoon characters, working together is something rarely seen. While it is good initially, the transformation Megatron undertakes, almost Milton-esque in its uneven callbacks to Paradise Lost, is rushed. There are great leaps in judgment and logic and much of the inner workings of the character are conveniently wrapped up in an overly simple pronouncement that the guy is just greedy. He seemed to be pretty selfless and valiant previously. Where was the character arc?

The art by Andrew Griffith is slightly improved in this issue. The previous installment was blurry, grainy and overly busy. While his attention to detailing the exteriors of the Transformers is still on display, the fuzziness has been toned down. Perhaps last issue had a printing error or there was some hiccup with my review copy. Still, storytelling-wise I feel that more panels could have been used to tell a more sequential narrative.

This issue is an improvement to a project that needs a good deal of love.
