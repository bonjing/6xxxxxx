,kingjoser,2011-09-17T01:56Z,Shouldn't there be at least a DVDrip out by now? WTF
,dextra,2011-09-17T09:48Z,"@kingjoser
is planned to be at november 15th.
dunno why so late, maybe they thought it's gonna increase the success of the last transformers movie or something but a dvd rip is no sooner to be expected than november.

however i kinda count on the russians to release a copy way earlier so we can get an R5"
[T],FrodooBagginz,2011-09-17T18:31Z,"Dextra you are wrong.

The DVD and Blu-Ray release will be September 30 (now less than 2 weeks away). Just  go to Amazon.com and they have pre-order up saying the title will be released on Sept. 30.

A DVD Rip should be available at any time now within the next week hopefully."
,dextra,2011-09-18T18:21Z,"well, frodoo, i hope you are right but many sources still have novermber as the release date (it's still the best guess for the release date on google) and since russians are little concered with copyrights, an R5 usually does not release the same time as the dvd-rip.

since there is no r5 anywhere in sight yet, i still doubt that there will be dvd/blue ray next week."
[T],FrodooBagginz,2011-09-18T19:12Z,"Dextra....actually, you are sort of right. The release date in the UNITED STATES is Sept. 30. The release date in other countries is in November. My Google search has Sept 30 all over the place for us and November for other countries.

Also, about R5s.....Transformers 3 is from Paramount. Paramount does not release R5s at all. I don't believe there has ever been a movie from Paramount that has had an R5.....I do know for sure that the first two Transformers movies did not have R5s."
,dextra,2011-09-18T20:17Z,"interesting insight, frodoo.
i don't remember whether or not there were r5 for previous transformer titles and if a dvd-rip is released end of september would be great.

why do the release such an important title so much later in europe?
cause i think the dubbing is done earlier...
 well, let's see :)"
