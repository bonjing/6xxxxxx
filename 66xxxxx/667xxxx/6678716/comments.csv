hello there extremezone..) itsss absolutely my pleasure to write u. after all, one day I had to thank you with much gratitude for all those many downloads I have shared from you over a past few years. And I can express thru only my humble gratitude for all you provided.

Finally signing up today I couldn't resist myself from 'Thanking You extemezone' along with all 'The Uploaders' and sharers here, who have provided me, more then ample in various facets of my life..

All of us here, thank you again n I believe v'all truly are one.
since v all eventually end up channelizing n connecting as one in a certain aspect.
'One world truly it is.' n it sounds good enough to appreciate, even though it just might take a few years in its true graciousness  to do so :)
cheers always to you my friend extremezone. and my wishes.
until next time.........if any :)"

,ultrakabi,2011-09-17T00:05Z,No one cares about your shitty comments how good is this movie or how great is this upload...Is it too hard to rate A/V ????
,joo-loved-it,2011-09-17T01:32Z,"Looks like I stepped into troll cave city here......
So sick of reading complaints in the comments that only have something to do with trolling some poor idiot that doesn't know anything about torrents.
We were all newfags at one point or another.
The more people joining up and downloading essentialy means more seeds too so if you didn't recently upload a nice quality video for thousands of people to download for free then I suggest you stfu, grab your ankles and take it like a bitch troll."

,redactedwv,2011-09-18T05:43Z,"For those working w/ subs: Make sure that the movie/sub files are titled exactly the same. If you're adding subs for ""SomeMovie"", the two files will look like this in your folder:

SomeMovie.avi

SomeMovie.srt

Shut the fuck up about your faggot CoD shit. Nobody except 10 year old kids play the game anymore. If we wanted CoD strategy guides, we'd google it & get better advice anyways.

You didn't break your leg - You're a loser looking for sympathy & spamming TPB comments. Stop  begging for views.

I'm going to thumbsdown every single one of your videos.

ALL: HEAD TO YOUTUBE TO THUMBS DOWN THIS FUCK."

,Banzay27,2011-09-19T18:02Z,"People have finally gotten tired of Jackie and he has retreated to his homeland for more serious tone action flicks. About time, his english movies really are kiddy.

,Gaffler,2011-09-19T21:03Z,"Cool upload.  It's nice to see more international movies on piratebay instead of just mainstream Hollywood, or ones from the UK.

About this though:
""No big releases lately so here's a ninja one...""

Shaolin is Chinese.  Ninjas are Japanese.

Anyway. thanks for the constant stream of uploads.  Always appreciate the plethora of selections from you upon visiting this site. "
,Enis88,2011-09-19T21:17Z,"@ Gaffler: I think the ninja part wasn't geografically meant, but more like the release comes from ""the shadows"" i.e not a well advertised Hollywood/mainstream release.

Anyhow, I think the movie is really good. Nice scenes and a good plot.
