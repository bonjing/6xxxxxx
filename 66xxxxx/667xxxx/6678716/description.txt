IMDB info

China is plunged into strife as feuding warlords try to expand their power by
warring over neighboring lands. Fuelled by his success on the battlefield, young
and arrogant Hao Jie sneers at Shaolin's masters after killing a rival warlord on
their temple grounds. But the glory comes before a fall. His own family is wiped out
in an unexpected turn of events and Hao is forced to take refuge with the monks. As
the civil unrest spreads and the people suffer, Hao and the Shaolin masters are forced
to take a fiery stand against the evil warlords. They launch a daring plan of rescue and escape.
