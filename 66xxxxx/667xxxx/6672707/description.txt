Storyline:

A young Parisian boy, Antoine Doinel, neglected by his derelict parents, skips school, sneaks into movies, runs away from 
home, steals things, and tries (disastrously) to return them. Like most kids, he gets into more trouble for things he 
thinks are right than for his actual trespasses. Unlike most kids, he gets whacked with the big stick. He inhabits a Paris 
of dingy flats, seedy arcades, abandoned factories, and workaday streets, a city that seems big and full of possibilities 
only to a child's eye.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
