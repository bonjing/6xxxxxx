        War In The Gulf: Arsenal: Dual In The Desert

        As  domestic needs  for military  hardware shrink,  industrial
        countries  now  have a  new  market to  pursue  - Behold,  the
        nations of  the Middle  East! With  the Cold  War over, Middle
        Eastern  nations  can  now  forego  political  alliances  when
        pursuing military technologies, and may buy any weaponry  that
        is affordable. With  little local manufacturing  and political
        unrest, cash-rich countries continue to upgrade their existing
        militaries. Take an insightful and informative look at the new
        weapons systems  that compete  for Middle  Eastern currencies.
        Witness the powerful arsenals of weaponry offered for sale  by
        countries of  the former  Soviet Union,  France, South Africa,
        the United  Kingdom and  the U.S.  Experience first-hand,  the
        explosive  power  delivered  by  the  world's  most   fearsome
        armoured vehicles, such as powerful T-90 main battle tank, air
        defence system such  as the 2S6  Tunguska and the  Ka050 Black
        Shark attack helicopter.
