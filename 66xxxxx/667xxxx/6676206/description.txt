        War In The Gulf: Arsenal: Winged Cavalry

        Cavalry  has been  the mobile  shock force  of all  successful
        armies  since antiquity.  The horseback  cavalry has  withered
        away, replaced with shock forces of technology, a lethalmix of
        air and ground fighting machines designed to deliver troops to
        any battlefield. Mobile weaponry  packs a punch, and  has made
        the modern cavalry a lethal killing force of its own.  Examine
        high-speed  armoured  cavalry  vehicles,  from  South Africa's
        remarkable Rooikat,  to Canada's  widely used  LAV. Trace  the
        evolution of the airborne forces,  such as the US Army's  82nd
        Airborne Division, and take a  seat in one of the  most lethal
        weapons  on  the modern  battlefield,  the attack  helicopter,
        including the American Apache and the South African Rooivalk.
