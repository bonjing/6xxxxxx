Product Description: This book introduces the concept of voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO)-based analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Detailed explanation is given of this promising new class of high resolution and low power ADCs, which use time quantization as opposed to traditional analog-based (i.e. voltage) ADCs.
