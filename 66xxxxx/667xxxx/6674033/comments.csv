,soad3883,2011-09-14T04:28Z,I really want to know if this is legit before getting it. 
,agorima,2011-09-14T05:32Z,"@cutechicinawhiteT
I've just downloaded from there.
@soad3883
It's legit."
,lookmann,2011-09-14T06:56Z,"@agorima & others.
all windows lovers know direct download site. slow netspeed, disruption in net or power connections make one opt for torrents where stored data is not lost, even if disrupted,and you can continue from where you left. 3GB is a huge download to risk a direct dl. unless you have very high speed internet.never mention a direct link in a torrent site. it is insulting both seeders & leechers."
,cutechicinawhiteT,2011-09-14T08:35Z,"@lookmann, And what have you contributed to TPB? I clicked on your name and.... nothing. And, for your information, I have a fast connection, got the DP, and started seeding! How is that agorima?"

i cant do direct download as i hav jus 25.6 kb/s."
,gijoeski,2011-09-16T11:52Z,"Just a note for everyone, I see alot of people asking will it run withthis system, will it run this software etc... this is a DEVELOPER BUILD it is NOT stable, it is NOT a beta release. don't switch your main OS for this. 

Best thing to do is get yourself a crappy tablet, or notebook and run it on that. play, with it, see how many times you can make it crash and just generally don't care. 

If you want something to replace your main os, wait for the Beta or RC. "

,charan315,2011-09-18T16:47Z,works great and windows 7 stays.
,wei0130,2011-09-19T11:38Z,"Downloaded at 108.2 KB/s
Installed it on VMware Workstation 8
(If you want to run it on VMware, only version Workstation 8 is compatible)
Works great!"
,chrisean88,2011-09-19T12:25Z,Do I need to remove Windows 7 before downloading? Are the drivers that came with my PC compatible with Windows 8? I'm running on Windows 7.
,punk420,2011-09-19T14:18Z,"@feee

set the floppy device to auto detect (or remove the floppy device)"
,DreamerXristosGr,2011-09-22T13:11Z,"@chrisean88 DO NOT INSTALL THIS, this is a Developers Preview. it is NOT stable. Only install in some kind of Virtual Machine, there are some tutorials already how to do that."
,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-09-23T18:34Z,"This is actually pretty good for desktop PC use, if you disable the stupid Metro tile system to get the real Start Menu back, among other things.  It becomes a faster version of Windows 7 in most respects, with some fairly decent new features.

One thing I will say is, watch out for compatibility with existing hardware.  I was using an old laptop with a not-too-well supported ATI X600 graphics card and could not make any of the old driver versions run.  The only solution was to upgrade my previous version of Windows 7 after doing a backup instead of using a clean install on another harddrive.  It was either that orspend hours trying various old driver versions and hacks to get it working."
,nemo..,2011-09-25T03:46Z,"Hey i can't install windows 8 as during insallation it is showing ""windows cannot update windows boot configuration ""
what to do friends 
please help
thanks in advance."
,bagerkeon,2011-09-26T04:36Z,"When i 1st saw HMPs comment at the top i thought he must be some old dude or something, but after download and using i think its justified. 
It definitely got potential but lacking heaps of basic things just in the dev prev. i want to actually preview stuff! NO MC?!? Ill go back to win7 for now and wait for the Beta and then RC depending on the beta. Navigation is different at first but ends up pretty easy. i dont like click twice for the search local shit option. blah blah blah good upload and speed!"
,bagerkeon,2011-09-26T04:39Z,oh yeah clean install or new account helped me with the metro aps too. duno if anyone else has that prob

This is now the best place to get Dev Preview.

Consumer Preview is out, but disables support for many slower devices, including Pentium M with 400Mhz FSB.

If you want to make a Windows To Go USB system, this is the torrent for you!  Consumer Preview on USB will work on newer systems but leave you SOL when you need it on corporate Dell D600s or the like."
