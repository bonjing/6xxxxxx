,Novz69,2011-09-14T17:44Z,@Playerdoug18 is this for Ipod touch 4th 4.3.5???? 
,PLAYERDOUG18,2011-09-14T21:54Z,i would downgrade to the 4.3.3 included in the file because the 4.3.5 firmware can't have an unteathered jailbreak. (a teathered jailbreak means you will have to  turn on your iPod by plugging it into your computer)
,papadart,2011-09-20T23:07Z,"ive got an 8 gigger, it says that the firmware is not compatible with my ipod touch...any suggestions ..ive never done this i justwanna play steet fighter for free..lol yea i know im cheap"

,PLAYERDOUG18,2011-09-21T16:18Z,"If you don't know what generation your iS, I suggest that you read up more on how to jailbreak.
