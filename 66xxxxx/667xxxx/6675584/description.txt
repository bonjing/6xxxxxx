The Science of Nutrition, Second Edition is uniquely organized using an applied approach, which organizes vitamins and minerals based on their functions and effects on the body. This applied approach is most evident in the functional organization of the micronutrient (vitamin and mineral) chapters. Rather than requiring you to memorize all the vitamins and minerals and their characteristics, the authors present them based on their functions (like fluid and electrolyte balance, antioxidant function, bone health, energy metabolism, and blood and immunity health), so that you can understand their effects on the body.

 

The Second Edition adds new learning aids to further help you learn and apply the material. Additionally, learning aids have been expanded, including a new version of MyDietAnalysis, available in both online and CD-ROM formats.
