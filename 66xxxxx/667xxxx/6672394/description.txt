The Mid-Atlantic's hottest new Blues band performing original work and remakes of Blues greats such as Muddy Waters, Johnny Winter and others. Venom Blues is currently appearing in the Northern Delaware area and rolls out several sets of seriously smokin' Blues tracks that will have you out on the floor and "stompin' yo' feet". This ain't your Grandma's Blues, so come prepared to hear a little something special and don't be surprised if you get bit - by the seduction that is "The Blues"!With the understanding that The Blues is an art form that deserves serious attention to detail, The Blues also leaves a lot of room for interpretation and innovation. Venom Blues carries that one step further into today's music scene with a bit more edge and a lot more energy. Venom Blues was formed in late 2005 by veterans of the Delaware and Northeast music scene, who collectively, have well over a hundred years of musical experience. They were brought together by an extreme desire to rekindle the flames of the artistry known as The Blues and carry it forward to the new generation. Delaware has seen it's share of the best Blues musicians that have toured the world. Venom Blues seeks to carry on that tradition, so keep your eyes open - The Blues can strike real fast.
