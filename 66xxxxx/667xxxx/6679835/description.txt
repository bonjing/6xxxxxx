2011 debut album from the Australian quartet. Prisoner is a panoramic study of tension and emancipation, from the echoing stone cathedral of the title track to the sun-blasted morning of the first single, 'Endless Summer'; from the cloistered atmospherics of the instrumental interlude, 'Austerlitz', to the chiming and climbing pop of 'Deep Wide Ocean' and the quiet reflecting pool of 'Peace Of Mind'.
