Xref: Boston Gardens, 18/6-1975 


Quality: VG+ Good sound, a little dark (little treble) maybe. -TOR 
VG+ -HERWIG 
The sound quality is good, though marred by some audience 
noise (especially during the quiet parts). -TAP (#50) 


Comments: Booklet claim that Nick Mason does vocals, and on the cover it is stated that ""You Gotta Be Crazy"" is written by Waters/Wright. The group is not at their best (is this the absence in the band, that WYWH is about?) but there are some very good versions of ""Any Colour You Like"" and ""Echoes"" (with a great sax solo). -TOR 


Recorded at the Boston Garden, the first CD to cover a complete 1975 US tour set. Most enjoyable are the preformances of ""Gotta Be Crazy"", which is different to both the 74 and 77 (Dogs) versions, and one of the last pre-87 ""Ecoes"", with very nice sax solos. -TAP (#50) 



Great sound quality. This concert is a little heavy on the bass. Each song is a notably good version, especially Echoes and Any Colour You Like. -ECM 



In as much I was asking about a comparison with the Random Precision CD, the responses I received were more or less given about the shows themselves. All responses were unanimously in favor of the Boston Gardens 6/16/75 show over the NY 6/18/75 show. 



Many thanks to those who did respond, in fact I'm listening to the Boston Gardens 6/16/75 roio as I type and I can attest to the performance at this show as being top notch. While I will agree on the comments in the roio db about the few edits (especially during SOYCD) as somewhat annoying, the sound and performance is better than I had hoped and more than outweight the deficiencies listed. I would even go so far as to say that if the NY 6/18/75 show is near the level of this show it would be a worthy one to have as well. -ANON 



Not much to say, except that it's great. I recommend it highly.- PK "
