 :::::[ PLOT SUMMARY ]:::::
 
                                                                       
   A juvenile delinquent gets out of the pen and immediately embarks   
   on a rampage of untethered anger, most of it directed at the        
   girlfriend of the journalist who helped send him up. Shot through   
   with the same kind of bebop bravado that Godard was experimenting   
   with half a world away, the anarchic descent into amoral madness    
   that is The Warped Ones (Kyonetsu no kisetsu) sounded a lost        
   generation's cry for help and was one of the films that kicked off  
   Japan's cinematic sixties with a bang.
