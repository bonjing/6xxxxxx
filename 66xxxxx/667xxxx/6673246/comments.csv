Why do you use LAME 3.90 when 3.98 is available?
Doesn't makes any sense."
[T],raidy,2011-09-23T02:07Z,"We've always used lame 3.90.3 since it was scene standard. Although some have moved onto v3.98 for various reasons, we prefer to maintain consistent high quality sound. So, we're sticking with what is known to work. lame v3.90.3 --alt preset standard."
[T],raidy,2011-09-23T05:30Z,"Apologies if that came across as a smartass....
Thanks for your comments and we're glad you like our stuff."

btw, Can you teach me how to upload ? lol
I just don't know how to seed after creating a torrent and uploading it here. "
