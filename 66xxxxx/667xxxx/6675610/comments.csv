,tapja91,2011-09-14T16:58Z,"works :D 
Great upload 
tnx"
,theborkz,2011-09-14T17:33Z,"Is this the final release, or a prerelease?"
,Ammoniach,2011-09-14T17:38Z,"Why would anyone even want to torrent this piece of jewel? I feel bad for those who do. Not being a hypocrite, but cmon, it's only 15 €! Plus it's SUPER easy to pay it via PayPal. I agree with every other torrent except Minecraft and TES series"
,silkooy,2011-09-14T17:39Z,"worked for me, thx"
,Pionnenman,2011-09-14T18:33Z,"Ammoniach, dont come here to just flame on the uploader. great job who did upload."
,hemlige_mannen,2011-09-14T18:44Z,"@Ammoniach

I do not use neither support PayPal so that is not an option."
,theassyrianlord,2011-09-14T18:47Z,"@Ammoniach dude, dont be such a pussy. Like everyone in the world would stop pirating because you said to stop downloading :S? I pay for games who deserve it, this game deserves it, but the paid version doesnt add anything more then the pirated version, so why buying it?"
,JayMK1993,2011-09-14T19:33Z,"@Amonniach If paypal wasnt being a bitch to me, i would :S"
,djmartino420,2011-09-14T21:05Z,I wouldn't trust this torrent guys minecraft is definitely still in beta stages and is currently on version 1.7.3
,Yortek,2011-09-14T21:27Z,djmartino420 has no idea what he's talking about. 1.8 was released today (9/14)
,abbaa,2011-09-14T21:29Z,"@Ammoniach
I only torrent a game i wanna try to see if i like it. If I do, I buy it. :)"
,Yortek,2011-09-14T21:37Z,"@djmartino420

1.8 was released today (9/14) this is a legit copy. Currently running and everything is fine."
,imreallyacolonel,2011-09-14T22:31Z,"@Ammoniach:  If I had the money right now, I would definitely buy it.  But since my wife divorced me and took everything I had (including credit/debit cards), I can only pirate this.  For now.  I fully intend to pay when I have the funds though."
,rbit19,2011-09-14T22:35Z,"hi everybody :D today is my birthday...and that was the best present :D:D:D:D
and i have a question (maybe it's a little bit early ^^) but can i play ""creative mode"" in multiplayer too?? and if yes than how can i set it??? :D thank you for the answers :D"
,Graceless666,2011-09-14T23:19Z,"Its great, but I miss village with NPC. Its wrong :/// Umí tu někdo česky? :D"
,Graceless666,2011-09-14T23:38Z,"Well, after hour looking for vilage I found it, but with out NPC :(( And I am sorry for my bad english ;) I have one question.. NPC in village are only in Multiplayer?"
,SmokeTheChron,2011-09-15T00:33Z,"@rbit19  To play creative mode in multiplayer you must be an administrator or hosting your own server as well as an administrator, the command is ''/gamemode  1'' 1 is creative mode, 0 is survival of course. Also, for anyone who would like to use custom skins instead of the default, www.mineshafter.appspot.com is your solution. It is a free alternative to the minecraft.net services, which currently only provide the updates and custom skin choice. Mineshafter provides both the updates(from minecraft.net) & custom skin ability. Granted mineshafter skins only work on a mineshafter-enabled server, its still a great, FREE service. There are tons of mineshafter servers out there, just check the list on mineshafter.appspot.com "
,Cogsyy,2011-09-15T00:39Z,"@Graceless666

NPCs will be in 1.9

I have a question of my own. I cant connect to any servers. I get either the ""End of stream"" error or ""User not premium"". Wat do?"
,Coolgwip,2011-09-15T03:56Z,Can anyone give me a step by step tutorial or a link for creating my own server to play with a friend of mine? Thanks!
,XSuperToasterX,2011-09-15T03:59Z,"Probably a stupid question, is this updatable?"
,djmartino420,2011-09-15T05:02Z,"Sorry guys, my bad. the only reason i said it was a bad upload was because i checked the minecraft website and it said nothing about the 1.8 release.

@Yortek
hate to burst your little bubble, but nothing about this copy is legit, except the fact that it runs."
,s7raker,2011-09-15T05:53Z,anyone else not being able to change the default install path? the button is greyed out for me
,mudkiptorrent,2011-09-15T10:15Z,"@Ammoniach

Go suck my mudkip.
This is a torrent site, so stop bitching about payments."
,lippy003,2011-09-15T12:08Z,"I have an issue unfortunately. Every couple of minutes it says ""minecraft has run out of memory"". its pissing me off! any one know how to fix this?"
,jeltedeproft,2011-09-15T13:02Z,"how do i play online?
can i just install this over 1.7 and will i keep my saves?
what about modcraft can i still use it?"
,WRAAAAHH,2011-09-15T19:16Z,Can I use my old 1.7.3 saves?
,djmartino420,2011-09-15T21:34Z,"@jeltedeproft and others
no u cannot play this version online (just like most all the other game torrents on this site)
yes it will install 1.8 over 1.7.3
and no modcraft is not out for 1.8 yet, but u can play creative mode which gives you unlimited resourses, infinite health, no hunger bar, and unlimited flight!!!!"
,djmartino420,2011-09-15T21:35Z,Oh and this will keep your saves/ worlds that u have from 1.7.3
,anilem,2011-09-15T23:07Z,"@djmartino420: wrong! you can play online on servers with ""online-mode=false"" in the server.properties"
,xShadowsHunter,2011-09-18T09:34Z,hey guys this game is having some probs blocks go invisible and the minecraft has run out of memory thing any help?
