,ClumsyParasite,2011-11-29T12:11Z,Don't download. Logged in once and I got hacked. Lucky I could recover in time. Some guy went to Stormwind and spammed Trade chat with some gold selling shit. NOT GOOD.
,gbs00,2011-12-03T19:02Z,"^ You are a fucking moron. This guide did nothing, I've been using it since he had it up and there have been no hackings. Maybe if you'd be more cautious with your downloads, you wouldn't be hacked. Blame nobody but your dumb ass self. This torrent is safe.."
