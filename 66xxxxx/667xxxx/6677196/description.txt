Lady Maisery is a new vocal trio from Hannah James (Kerfuffle, Hannah James and Sam Sweeney, Demon Barbers), Hazel Askew (The Askew Sisters) and Rowan Rheingans (Fidola.) Inspired by folk singing traditions of the UK and northern Europe, Lady Maisery sing songs and ballads both unaccompanied, and with backing from their combined instrumental talents on accordion, harp and fiddle. 
Their debut album, Weave and Spin, was recorded one frosty week in February and introduces these three musicians; three voices woven together in a timeless combination, which they push to new levels. It features a captivating collection of songs, carefully chosen and arranged to showcase the vocal quality of the group.
