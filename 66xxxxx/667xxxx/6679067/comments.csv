,Nergalsyn,2011-09-16T14:38Z,"if its anything like vampires vs zombies, the budget may be equivalent to a pack of juicy fruit, a chico stick and a two pack tasty kake."
,Nergalsyn,2011-09-16T14:39Z,I should say ninja's vs zombies not vampires vs zombies
,medgix,2011-09-16T20:05Z,"If you aren't in to bizzare humour, don't bother. Better watch the trailer first people!

Seems like my kind of movie though."
,AnitialD,2011-09-17T15:34Z,"I know the crew. They used one of my beats in Ninja vs Zombies & in Ninjas vs Vampires...Hear it when the guy runs out of the video store, they only used like 20 secs though. "
