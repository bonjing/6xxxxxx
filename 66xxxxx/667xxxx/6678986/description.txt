comment: Lenon my be one of the Monarch-children but his insights are highly valuable anyway. Sex obviously plays an important role in society. If you want to control a society then you have to control how people feel about sex, what beliefs they associate with it, what sexual role-models they have, and how they interact with each other in the sexual context. Do I have to tell you that the so called gender issues have been engineered by the elite and their opinion-defining media outlets? If you want to break up families as the smallest social units then you have to redefine how men and women see each other and how their lives are being defined by their sexuality. Think of the gay agenda: Gay couples don't produce any children which nicely plays into the elite's agenda of population reduction. Nothing happens by chance in this system. Most of the so called grassroots movements have been engineered right from the top. It has to look as if it had come up from the basis but that's the look of it only - in truth nothing is what it appears to be in this world. Those who reject the elite's methods of social engineering are being portrayed by their media either as outdated die-hards, as racists or as political extremists in order to discredit them and prevent decent people from taking their convictions seriously. "Pressure from above pressure from below" - But even the pressure from below has been engineered from above. The decent people seeing through these methods of manipulation are being squashed between an authoritarian elite at the top defining the false values of "political correctness" and a highly mind controlled mass of people at the bottom. Masonic-communism has always been the best tool to smash the Christian middle class, the very class that has been the only guarantee for the survival of Constitutional rights. But if you want to destroy people's rights then you do it in the name of the people.
