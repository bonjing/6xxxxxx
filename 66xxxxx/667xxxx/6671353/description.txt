Notes

First studio album in 10 years.  I certainly hope the hiatus has paid off.

Multi-platinum rock band BUSH return with their highly anticipated new album
The Sea Of Memories Recorded with producer Bob Rock (Aerosmith, Metallica).
THE SEA OF MEMORIES is the seminal bands first studio release in 10 years.
THE SEA OF MEMORIES captures the electricity and trademark intensity of
classic Bush delivered in a setting that is fresh and alive. Songs like The
Sound of Winter, Heart of the Matter and All Night Doctors are propelled by
heavy guitar and hypnotic beats, simple song structures and sublime
textures. About the album, Rossdale says, When making music, you have a
choice to repeat what you ve done or move on. It wouldve been safe to just
rework (1994s debut album) Sixteen Stone over and over, but what kind of
life would that be? When youre driving down the road, youre focused on whats
in front of you; you don t really think to keep checking in your rear view
mirror. I like the idea of art changing, developing and morphing.
