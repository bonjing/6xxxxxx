,dara168,2011-09-16T15:04Z,Thanks you
,nanachi,2011-09-16T18:39Z,Is it really working?
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-09-16T19:28Z,"incredible!
works as advertised :)

I used to be an NOD32 user back in the days of KIS7, but switched to KIS.

Im just sick and tired of searching for KIS keys. 
Im sick of people posting and re-posting keys that come from 1 site with different names. 

KIS is good but too much of a hassle for a pirate.

ESET is 10x's faster/lighter and the security is above average.

Thanks scene4all."

,ShadowMastr,2011-09-17T22:57Z,"This is not a knock on this upload, just a heads up.

If your using win 7 64 bit ultimate, on the eset forums there is a lot of posts about people having issues. Mainly, the computer won't boot after installing v5 of ess. The eset guy there is saying it seems to happen more often than not if you install the program on any drive other than the system drive where you installed win7, which is usually C.

There's a  smattering of people who say putting it on C fixes it, some say it doesn't. Some 32 bit win7 ultimates are having issues also....

So once again, heads up, try at your own risk. This is an eset issue, and not an issue with this share. Thanks scene4all for providing us with a version that doesn't need a new key every few days.

Does anyone know how this crack works or what it does?? I'm not a big fan of installing things that run on bootup to reset trial dates and that kind of thing, and I have a feeling this one might be something like that...."
,ShadowMastr,2011-09-17T23:04Z,"@teopap84, ess contains nod 32 plus firewall, anti malware, email protection, etc.. nod 32 is just anti virus."

Im running Windows 7 SP1 x64-bit and have no problems. Infact, ESET has improved my computer's performance by night and day vs. Kaspersky Internet Security :)

And that's with all the security settings set to MAX.


KASPERSKY USERS:
The only thing missing is an ""Anti-banner"".
Here's a list you can load into ESET's HTTP ""Block"" list. 
http://pastebay.com/138709

Save as a text file and you can load the entire file.

If you're using Firefox than you can use Ad-block. Mainly for Opera users of Ex-KIS Users. :)"
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-09-18T21:30Z,"by the way.. the list came from Kaspersky Forum :)

i activate the product activation using that key after 1 month the antivirus did not recognized the key i used before..so it is not fixed even if you activate the product activation.. maybe the database of eset nod32 traced that the username and password used many times.that was come in mind, correct me if i'm wrong..this only my experience using eset.. i have more key here which did not recognized by eset AV

Read the Vendors' responses below the table, read their pathetic excuses, e.g.:
""Our firewall was never designed to be used in a stand-alone environment...""

ESET, AVG, Avira, avast! etc are just yet another pieces of crap meant for morons, who choose by the ""good looks"" instead of ""brains"" aka just had a nice shiny AD and you thought, since it ""looks"" cool, then it must definitely be ""cool"".

But get this: I bought it based on rag-mag ratings and it slipped to around 5 in those 'computer' rag ratings game this year. Guess who is on top? Norton 360. Ok...so I put Norton 360 on 2 virgin systems. What a MISTAKE. Slowwwww browsing. Ok...so what's my point? Don't trust the rag-mags on ratings. Don't tell the whole story. What did I do? I switched to freeware COMODO [see Skulldragon link]....and it found malware that the famous Norton360 didn't even get. Plus....its faster than ESET even. "
