This is an album I\\\\\\\'ve been particularly eager to hear. The mix of the great Flamenco band Ketama and the prolific Kora master Toumani Diabate is terrific. Add Danny Thompson on the bass (he played for Donovan, Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, Nick Drake, John Martyn...) and Diaw KouyatÃ© and Djanka Diabate (from Guinea I think, they sing with Mory KantÃ©) on the backing vocals and you get a colorful album that goes in many directions and still stays whole. African vocal harmonies over Flamenco guitar sounds surprisingly well and the rythmic playing of Ketama blends perfectly with Diabate\\\\\\\'s sometimes hard picking on the Kora. 
That album is a real experience to hear and live and, in my opinion, a flawless one.
