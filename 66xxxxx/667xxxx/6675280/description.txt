September is late this year, huh?

Well, at least it is DONE. Sorry it took so long.

But here it is, 138 new music tracks to enjoy. Double sized for your pleasure.

Hope you all had a great summer. Almost over now. Sadly.

But as you all know, the Fall and Winter are always great times for music.
All that great stuff that everyone recorded this summer finally gets released!

Be well. Enjoy and see you in October.
