,mwalsher,2011-09-13T20:11Z,"Oops, never mind, I just noticed that there’s TWO shows in this! :D"
,sspeaks,2011-09-13T20:16Z,It never makes any sense why some people make negative comments about a good torrent which they download. It seems to me that they have only one aim which is to discourage the uploader. Charlesfire22 please ignore the negative comments. 
,bigbandbilly,2011-09-14T01:23Z,Weeds if you please?
