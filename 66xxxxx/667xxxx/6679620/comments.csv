,Vulturama,2011-09-16T15:18Z,"According to Epguides it is season 3, part 1 of a 3-part mega-ep! Whatever, I'm sure it's good.

,Khane,2011-09-16T16:09Z,"although this + the next 2 are classed as season 2, they are season 3, but not really either in all honesty. they are tying up the story from season 2 and leading into season 3. either way who the fuck cares archer is back :D"
,Labwrath,2011-09-16T16:13Z,"Who cares if it's season 2 or 3, Archer is back!"
,aapb,2011-09-16T23:49Z,@Labwrath Well said!
,Vulturama,2011-09-17T08:26Z,I care! I'm anal retentive - gotta get my filing system right!    80)
,hosenburger,2011-09-18T18:10Z,"Fx say its season 2, but it might help you understand if you think archer season 2.5"
,passing,2011-09-18T21:58Z,"Backing up what Khane said.  Wikipedia explains that these 3 are technically a 3 part season finale for season 2, with the remaining 13 coming episodes being season 3.

It's a weird kind of structure, but I don't care what they classify it as, just as long as it's back."
,krkbrn,2011-09-19T15:53Z,"Can anyone get this movie? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183488/

It's called ""The Sinking Of Santa Isabel"" and I really want to see it."
,blahspam1,2011-10-24T04:00Z,This is the same file as Season 3 episode 1 for those who are confused.
