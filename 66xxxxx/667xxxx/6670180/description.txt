ReleaseNotes:

Time of My Life is an album by American rock band 3 Doors Down, released on July 19, 2011. It is the band's fifth studio album after their self-titled album released in 2008. The album debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 with 59,800 copies sold in its first week.

On March 31, 2011, 3 Doors Down announced that "Time of My Life" was set to be released on July 19, 2011. Brad Arnold spoke very positively of the album's heavier sound, "This record shows some growth on our part. We've had success in the past and we're very thankful for that, but there's always room toÃ  take it up to another level. And I feel like we did that. There's a lot of songs that people can immediately identify with. We just really wanted to do our best on this record, and looking back on the whole experience, I can really say that we
did."  

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
