Blind Pilot's new album We Are The Tide, released September 13th 2011. All files are in FLAC. 


Blind Pilot presents the gentle side of indie music on â€œWe Are the Tide,â€ the Portland, Ore., actâ€™s follow-up to its 2008 debut, â€œ3 Rounds and a Sound.â€

The founding duo â€” frontman Israel Nebeker and drummer Ryan Dobrowski â€” has expanded its lineup to six with the addition of upright bass player Luke Ydstie, banjo/dulcimer player Kati Claborn, vibraphonist Ian Krist and keyboardist/trumpeter Dave Jorgensen. Blind Pilot now also glides on a more complicated sound than on that rather barebones first release.

Still, â€œWe Are the Tideâ€ is a bit too mellow for its own good.

The combination of Nebekerâ€™s sweet vocals, the warm rootsy/folksie arrangements and the thought-provoking tone of the lyrics creates a touching atmosphere. Extra depth comes in the form of keyboards in the slapping track â€œAlways,â€ chunky beat on â€œI Know,â€ soft tribal drums on â€œNew Yorkâ€ and a lonely trumpet on â€œWhite Apple.â€ Also, Nebekerâ€™s tendency to undersell himself at vocals is reconciled with periodic demonstrative choruses and lulling harmonies.

Oftentimes, â€œWe Are the Tideâ€ is simply moving.
