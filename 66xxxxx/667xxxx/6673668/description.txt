ReleaseNotes:

Somehow, I skipped over Pink Floyd while getting older and never really noticed them. A longing for some good British band music led me to give Pulse a shot and boy was I surprised. I'd always thought their songs that I heard on pop radio were sort of 'down' because of the lyrics. Yes, there are negative themes here, but there are an equal number of passages where the minor keys are resolved into beautiful, shining majors. Gilmour is a stupendous, versatile guitar player. I have to rate him as one of the best lead guitarists I've ever heard -- intelligent work that doesn't rely on cliches that are repeated over and over (Ever take a close listen to Clapton, even going back to the original Layla? I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about him. He's smooth, but not really very inventive -- and he plays off pitch, as well!). These two CD's will satisfy anyone thirsting for guitar elevated to an art form.
