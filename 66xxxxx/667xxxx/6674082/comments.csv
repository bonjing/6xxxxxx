However - The quality of the actual show itself is truly a new low... even for The WB.  If this show lasts more than just a few episodes, I would be AMAZED.  Half of the ""special effect"" scenes look like something they could pull off in a Saturday Night Live skit (from the 90's)!  I would rather throw my computer down a flight of stairs than watch another episode of this show."

,Thomps6o,2011-09-15T07:56Z,"I rather liked the show, while you ""jmcpdx"" were trying to look at how good it was made and what things were not executed to perfection. I was just watching it for the sole purpose of enjoyment, so I didn't notice any of what your talking about and thought it was good. I would recommend it."
,Kole97,2011-09-15T08:23Z,thanks !!
,Kole97,2011-09-15T08:24Z,@sklyn Agree on that...it's not that bad !!
,philgreedy,2011-09-15T19:47Z,its buffy who cares ahahahahahahahahaha
,neeruam,2011-09-18T06:08Z,exactly what philgreedy said
,neeruam,2011-09-20T22:48Z,Can you upload episode 2 please?
,oceansoflovewi,2011-11-01T07:42Z,"I agree with thomp, this episode and kickoff to the show was great! I was never bored for one second of it, very suspenseful, love the act she has to put on in general, the boat scene was beautiful, the best friend affair drama, that beautiful penthouse apartment, So great to see Sarah Michelle back on TV where she belongs, Buffy will never be outdone, lets just appreciate what this SEASON has to offer, Sarah doesn't pick just any role to play, theres a reason why she chose to be on this show, and lets continue the journey to find out why, no more close minded pompous comments from a**holes caring only about special effects rather than the depth of this story (jmcpdx) ignore the punk, this show has a lot to offer keep watching guys!"
,Dufox,2011-11-02T20:05Z,"lol this is a pilot
9/10 if you go back and watch the pilot of your favorite tv show you will say what the fuck is this shit.
havnt seen the show yet but sarah michelle gellar is a good actor and the girl of my dreams so its worth watching for me :D"
,klearlycanadian,2011-12-03T06:26Z,@jmcpdx  L.O.L. Guess what?  Unplug your computer and get ready to throw it down a flight of stairs cause The CW gave the go ahead for a complete season.  That means at least 12 episode after number 10 dude.  I want pictures.  Take pictures.  I wanna see some sparks and sound of glass breaking (alright plastic cracking).
,klearlycanadian,2011-12-03T06:29Z,@philgreedy.  haha I m with u man.  Yay SMG.  She's a beauty.  It's been ages since she's on TV.  Does anyone remember she once said she would never come back to the WB?  Or is it void now that they changed their moniker to CW?
