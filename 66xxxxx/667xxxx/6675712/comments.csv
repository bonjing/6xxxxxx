,DeltaBoss,2011-09-14T18:09Z,Thanks to all seeders at this point. Torrent seems to spread good.
,DeltaBoss,2011-09-14T18:10Z,Well apparently you seem to be the only one who finds a virus in it. Get a better AntiVirus programm and stop acusing me of spreading shitty viruses.
,luckyfox,2011-09-14T18:49Z,So does it work? Yay or nay?
,DeltaBoss,2011-09-14T19:19Z,"Well it definetly does not contain any virus :D
If it works, somebody else should answer^^"
