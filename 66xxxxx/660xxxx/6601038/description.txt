"Project Dawn, Episode 1"

Latif, a Pakistani terrorist kidnaps 
Porter. Michael Stonebridge is instructed 
by Section 20 to locate Damian Scott in 
Kuala Lumpur, as only he and Porter are 
the only people who know what Latif looks 
like so that they can then try and rescue 
Porter. They soon learn that the 
terrorists are planning to attack a hotel 
in India.

Yet another uk series following the trend
of becoming a us/uk co-production.

Evolve...or die.
