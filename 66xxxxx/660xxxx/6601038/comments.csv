,euphoria4949,2011-08-14T08:47Z,They are the same show. Strike Back is a British TV show broadcast on Sky 1 in the UK and also shown on HBO in the US.
,Lenny9,2011-08-14T16:02Z,"Actually it's being marketed as a Cinemax original show in US. 
I'm just wondering whether it's reairing of the first episode of season 1, which had 6 eps in UK already a long time ago, or an actual first episode of season 2, which is aimed to have 10 eps...?"
