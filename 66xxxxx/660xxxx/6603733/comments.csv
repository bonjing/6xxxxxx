,duveroux,2011-08-15T16:45Z,so... what exactly are we supposed to do with these files?
,ZtorkX86,2011-08-15T21:32Z,duverox@ What do you mean? You use a virtual DVD-rom to mount the .bin file and then you can install the game.
,dmx_wyrw,2011-08-19T17:45Z,"Change CdPath= in DeusEx.ini and System.ini to CdPath=..\
No need to leave virtual cd mounted."
,sir_arles,2011-08-24T08:58Z,"Works great, thanx!"
,andrewhubster,2011-08-25T06:15Z,i remember this game it was fun.hope it works:)
,Kookaburra00,2011-08-27T09:29Z,"when i try and run it, it says it can't find file for package 'effects'. When I tried to uninstall it, it doesn't work. Plz help! "
,Dragice,2011-08-27T14:54Z,"Good job mate! For those of you wondering, this is the ORIGINAL Deus Ex, not the new one. If you were looking for the original, you found it."
,ZtorkX86,2011-08-27T16:38Z,"Kooka@ That was one weird error, I never stumbled upon it myself. I think something happened during your installation so I think you need to delete the files manually then either use an application to delete the necessary registry files like Revo Uninstaller.

I would check some fan forum, there are a few for this game and they could probably help you out.

Just for reference point, when it says effect I also thought it could do something that was connected to either your monitor or GPU, you should check them out as well that they aren't damaged."
,ZtorkX86,2011-08-27T16:41Z,Does anyone else have trouble seeding? It doesn't seem to be so active ATM but I still want to seed if needed.
,superjy,2011-09-07T12:29Z,"Thanks guys, just downloaded for a re-playthrough at 1.2mb/s!
Seeding to a 2.0 ratio"
,Kookaburra00,2011-09-08T06:02Z,does multiplayer work?
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-08T23:35Z,Kooka@ I haven't tried but it should.
,DaleNixon,2012-03-29T18:22Z,"So can I use mods with this torrent such as ""The Nameless Mod"" and ""New Vision""
Most torrents for this game I've had were unable for me to mod, which is genuinely annoying."
,ZtorkX86,2012-05-10T01:05Z,"DaleNixon@Sorry for the late reply but yes, most mods should work. I've tried both New Vision, TNM, Deus Ex HDTP, Project 2027.

There's a possiblity that GOG's DRM-free version of Deus Ex GOTY is available somewhere as well and it should be even more problem free than this is. Usually, as long as you follow mod guidelines with functional hardware it should work."
