SONNY ROLLINS ON IMPULSE!
Released 1965 
Recorded July 8, 1965 
Length 34:17 
Label Impulse!

Sonny Rollins made some excellent recordings for Impulse! in the mid-1960s, a time when his unassailable skills and acrobatic approach made him a leading saxophonist, and one of the few to rival John Coltrane. On Impulse! has only five tracks, but each tells the complex, glorious story of Rollins's talent, especially in the stretched-out solos where his knack for inventively, endlessly de- and re-constructing melodies is evident. "On Green Dolphin Street," "Everything Happens to Me," and "Three Little Words" are among the standouts on this collection.
