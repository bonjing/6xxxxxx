,press2010,2011-08-15T15:40Z,Thanks for posting. I don't know how long you intend to seed this nor your bandwidth but if not enough seeders develop would you consider at some later point reposting in smaller chunks.TIA.
[V],DownTYU,2011-08-15T16:06Z,Initial seeding will continue untill at least 10 people complete..As to seed this will depend on those 10 leeches. As for your second suggestion it might be suicidal.
,ofpirate,2011-08-15T22:27Z,this file size is somewhat prohibitive.. most users don't have the drive space necessary to seed this for an extended period of time.. certainly not enough time to form a healthy swarm

Will try to convert it in a more compact format (smaller size) afterward and upload it."
