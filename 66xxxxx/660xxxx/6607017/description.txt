COMMENTS:  
- Solution manual for the 2nd ed. available here on TPB (uploader: dynstab2).
- Every student in civil engineering should have a copy of this excellent text. MEs and AEs? Likewise, IMHO. The procedures used to solve simple problems are a nice introduction to the concepts and computing tools (e.g., finite element method, FEM) that will be used for more complex applications later (structural design).

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
