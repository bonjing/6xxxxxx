A bit of a "Curate's egg" I'm afraid, owing to the condition of a couple of the tapes the quality is variable, however overall it is fairly reasonable.


The book

Cold Comfort Farm is a comic novel by Stella Gibbons, published in 1932. It parodies the romanticised, sometimes doom-laden accounts of rural life popular at the time, by writers such as Mary Webb. Gibbons was working for the Evening Standard in 1928 when they decided to serialise Webb's first novel, The Golden Arrow, and had the job of summarising the plot of earlier installments. Other novelists in the tradition parodied by Cold Comfort Farm are D. H. Lawrence, Sheila Kaye-Smith and Thomas Hardy; and going further back, Mary E Mann and the BrontÃ« sisters. The book is set in the near future.

Orphaned, destitute, and unwilling to get a job, 20-year-old Flora Poste looks to her relatives for a place to live. She settles upon the Starkadders, relatives on her mother's side, who live on the isolated Cold Comfort Farm, near the fictional Sussex village of Howling. Greeting her as "Robert Poste's child," they take her in to repay an unexplained wrong done to her father.

Each member of the extended family has some long-standing emotional problem caused by ignorance, hatred or fear; and the farm is badly run -- supposedly cursed -- and presided over by the unseen and ominous presence of Aunt Ada Doom, who is said to have been driven mad by seeing "something nasty in the woodshed" as a child.

Flora, a level-headed urban woman, applies modern common sense to their problems and intends for them all to adapt to the twentieth century.


The author

Stella Dorothea Gibbons (5 January 1902 â€“ 19 December 1989) was an English novelist, journalist, poet, and short-story writer. Her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm, won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize for 1933. A satire and parody of the pessimistic ruralism of Thomas Hardy, his followers and especially Precious Bane by Mary Webbâ€”the "loam and lovechild" genre, as some called itâ€”Cold Comfort Farm introduces a self-confident young woman, quite consciously modern, pragmatic, and optimistic, into the grim, fate-bound, and dark rural scene those novelists tended to portray.
