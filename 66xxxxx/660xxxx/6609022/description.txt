- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  Since the band's inception in 1995, Blue October has been a refuge for its
  fans worldwide. The band built a loyal audience, exploding into the mainstream
  with mega-hits 'Hate Me,' 'Into The Ocean,' and 'Dirt Room.' They have had
  high profile film and TV placements The Sopranos, Saw III and NCIS. A
  cathartic tale of heartbreak and healing through thirteen distinct songs, "Any
  Man In America" is a musical journey told with unbridled lyrical honesty,
  anthemic modern rock hooks, and melodic soundscapes.
