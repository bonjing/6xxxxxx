[V],globeplus,2011-08-15T13:18Z,"To fgtfgtj : thank you for asking but presently i have a slow connection net after my forced home change then i needed to reduce all the expensives to the minimum , so i can only work smaller size files for applications or movies , i canÂ´t leave the downloaders waiting several days or more than a week to download a game file but the future who knows ? maybe i return a normal connection and then iÂ´ll see what i can do , for the moment this is  the best i can do but one thing it is for shore : i conserve intact all my good file sharing spirit and i have the intention to stay like that no matter it is the difficulties ...

Cheers and thank you again for asking about my game files ."

Movies need a good picture quality to be enjoyed games have the graphics written in the program."
