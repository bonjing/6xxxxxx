,kathykat63,2012-05-12T12:49Z,"A little harsh TxJag?  Complete Scarpeta and Andy Brazil series at time of upload.  The non-fiction and poorly reviewed At Risk series are not included, thankfully. The books are mostly MOBI and LIT format with a few ePub, which is what I need for my mom's iPad.  I use Calibre to download covers, metadata and convert and expected to do a little editing.  All books have covers, correctly titled and metadata.  Unless I get a very bad surprise later, like most of the book is there until you get to the last few missing chapters, I would recommend this torrent as a nice collection.  "
