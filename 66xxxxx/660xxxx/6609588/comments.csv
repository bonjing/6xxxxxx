,phservino,2011-08-17T03:23Z,does it works?
,yyywww111,2011-08-17T04:02Z,"Looks like the previously uploaded ""No crack"" version of the game + the recent crack.

Game should be fine"
,elturbo9077,2011-08-17T04:55Z,"this has no crack 

crack needs a legit ubisoft acount 

wait for offline crack instead "
,smblion,2011-08-17T05:25Z,I get error while installing orbit (ubisoft game launcher).. anyone else have this problem?
,BrokenCuckooClock,2011-08-17T07:16Z,"This is exactly the same from Sonuyos & TOMEK1166, don't bother."

,abeloh19,2011-08-17T13:57Z,As soon as a better alternative crack comes out I'll upload it here guys
,mrHobbY,2011-08-17T14:07Z,"After unpacking and istalling game, go to Folder support and install everything from there: vcredist, installer, ubi and dx."
,British89,2011-08-17T19:51Z,"I can confirm that this torrent DOSE work 100%

Just follow the instructions in the crack folder and your away...

1. Fresh Installation of Ubisoft Launcher and From Dust 
2. Update game and Ubisoft Launcher 
3. Close the launcher 
4. Get the crack (link down) 
5. Copy UbisoftGameLauncher.exe into the Ubisoft Launcher folder and overwrite the old one. 
6. Start the game via the From_Dust.exe. 
7. Create an account and login. When it asks for a key, put in a random number and press play 
8.Thats it.PLAY !!!! "
,C4rpenter,2011-08-17T22:28Z,Works 100%.
,a840796,2011-08-18T00:15Z,Trojan in setup.exe
,Lithiumn,2011-08-18T01:26Z,"Trojan removed a few minutes ago lol.  Just warning you fellas, not a false alarm, so shut it.  It was a not particularly unpleasant trojan, however I instantly noticed performance issues.  

Also I believe this may be for x64 bit only, as everything worked perfectly up until launch in which I was forced to submit to ""program had unexpect error"" messages until someone comes up with a fix and a clean version of this game ;)  
Otherwise patching/installing is easy and common sense oriented."
,yano75,2011-08-18T02:58Z,Yeah it contains a worm that connects to a botnet. But it is easy to remove
,master_kaos,2011-08-18T03:03Z,"OK this game does work fine, but the instructions kind of suck.

1. extract contents of crack.rar and from_dust.rar
2. In support/Ubisoft run UbisoftGameLauncherInstaller
3. Run setup.exe
4. run game and update.
5. copy crack/UbisoftGameLauncher.exe to c:\program files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\
6. Run game. when asks for key type in random numbers.
7. Enjoy:)
"
,yano75,2011-08-18T03:14Z,"How to remove that shit:
1. Go to C:/Users/[current user]/AppData/Roaming
2. You'll find inid.exe and some other files like JavaDepx.exe.exe or PCSP.exe
3. In the Task Manager, kill all the processes that match the files you found at the previous step
4. Now delete the fucking files
5. Use Regedit or CCleaner or Spybot to remove these .exe from the startup."
,fpsdoug46,2011-08-18T03:38Z,"Works Great, but do you have to type in a key every time you start the game? not really a big deal, just wondering "
,Feylin,2011-08-18T05:22Z,"Confirmed virus, do not download."
,spartan7x,2011-08-18T05:52Z,I re downloaded this again and when i try to run the setup.exe i get an error saying it cant find a specified path or file. help =[
,jamie_4_life,2011-08-18T07:05Z,Same as spartan7x I can't get passed the setup.exe  :( I can't figure it out. Please help
,bluebluecar,2011-08-18T08:26Z,what the key?
,bluebluecar,2011-08-18T08:35Z,whats product key?
,Calacirian,2011-08-18T08:50Z,"I have the same problem as Lithiumn, patching and installed without a problem, but when i run the game it gives me the ""program had unexpected error."" Can anyone help?"
,Calacirian,2011-08-18T09:08Z,"I've got the same problem as Lithiumn, I get an ""program had experianced an unexpected error"" message. Anyonw know how to fix this?"
,rubberpig,2011-08-18T11:24Z,"don't know for sure if it was this torrent, but immediately after installing was infected with Trojan.LVP. Tried to steal CD keys. Avoid this one and find one with a skull."
,master_kaos,2011-08-18T23:02Z,"ya this torrent defintely contains a virus.. atleast easy to move, but might as well avoid."
,SomeNobody,2011-08-18T23:13Z,"EVEN THOUGH THE GAME WORKS THIS IS NOT A FALSE POSITIVE

I can confirm like others have that this contains some spyware shit. I only noticed because I saw iexporer.exe running in my processes list without the window open and ending the task just made it restart.

I have Win7 x64 and upon looking into it further I noticed a bunch of randomly named *.tmp files in the startup folder, like ""XXXXX.tmp""

Looking at my process list again I saw ""Driver Genius Professional Edition running"" Which I know I never intalled. That originated in ""User//appdata/roaming"" folder with more .tmp files and a couple of .exe's.

The BIGGEST surprise was going to my temp folder and discovering one of the programs in the torrent actualy took **SCREENSHOTS** of my desktop with the instructions from the crack open. The files were all easily deleted (strangely my AV didn't detect them).

So, here's the places I found the files if anyone wants to check themselves:
C:\User//appdata/roaming - Check for recently created/modified exes and tmp files.
C:\User//appdata/local/temp - The source of it with folders and exes, just delete everything there you can.
C:\User//appdata/roaming/microsoft/windows/start menu/programs/startup - I had a bunch of .tmp files that windows couldn't start when I booted my PC
Run > msconfig - It had the exes in the ""roaming"" folder checked to start along with the .tmp files

I've run the game again, and it doesn't seem to reinstall the spyware/virus when I checked again and I don't see anything in my process list that's out of the ordinary, so it looks like somone downloaded legit torrents and added something to run during cracking or installation and uploaded the torrent.

Luckily it was easy to find and delete."
,syedzibran,2011-08-27T02:07Z,"the game is loading but after some minutes an error stating ""From_Dust.exe stopped working""
 CAN ANY ONE HELP ME TO FIX THIS"
