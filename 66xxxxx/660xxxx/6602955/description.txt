Amazon Description:
From driving anthems to high-school ballads, The Downtown Fiction, consisting of Cameron Leahy, Eric Jones, and David Pavluk, are bringing back pop rock to where it should be with their new EP "Best I Never Had". The EP starts out with the title track "Best I Never Had". The verses feature Leahy's smooth effortless vocals over a tight-knit unit of instruments, breaking into a bittersweet chorus about regret. As the EP pushes on, the next song is "Oceans Between Us", and this is where the EP really starts to get going. The Best I Never Had EP is a striking major-label debut. The Downtown Fiction prove themselves worthy of the praise they have received and definitely know how to put out a damn good record. Every song on the album comes straight from the heart. The Downtown Fiction has established itself as serious competition for others in the scene-and they're definitely a band to watch out for.
