could you do a ~1.5gig rip of this one at 720p?

thanks in advance..."
,dude8888,2011-08-17T00:50Z,"Hi again Zeberzee
Ooops, I just saw that you did Twister for me
So many thanks to you!!
(but a 1.5gig rip at 720p would be awesome if you ever find some spare cycles)


Zen Bud just did Mrs Doubtfire & it is very good
