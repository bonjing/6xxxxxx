    A man who is having an affair with a married woman is dropped off on     
    the wrong street when going back to his hotel. He takes refuge out of    
    the rain when an old man invites him in. He turns out to be a            
    mortician, who tells him the stories of the people who have wound up     
    in his establishment over the course of four stories.
