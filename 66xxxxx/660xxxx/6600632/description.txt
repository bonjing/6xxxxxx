From the Infowars web site ::

Alex covers the latest news, including the increasingly distinct possibility that NATO, under the guidance of Europe and the United States, will take out Syria militarily. 

He also covers the faltering economy as the roller-coaster stock market dives and the price of gold reaches new highs on fears a global depression will intensify. 

Alex talks with regular Friday guest Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster and takes a number of calls.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
