,spockdaz,2012-05-18T14:46Z,"Bit of a spinout upload, I wanted to try the sonivox plugins but utorrent wont allow me to select want I want like bigdog says. Team air and assign have done alot of work. All these cracks but no one has cracked steven slate drums yet."
,spockdaz,2012-05-19T08:23Z,"Bigdog's right, in utorrent if you click files you can select what you dont want to download, which makes this a pretty awesome upload, cheers."
