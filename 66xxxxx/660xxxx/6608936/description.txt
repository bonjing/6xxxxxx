   Just before bounty hunter Charile triggers his gun to destroy the       
   last two Critter-eggs, he gets a message that it would be illegal       
   to extinguish the race from the galaxy. He's sent a transporter            
   where he puts the eggs - unfortunately the transporter takes him           
   with it and then gets lost in space. After 53 deep-frozen years,           
   he's found by a private wreckage collector team under the                  
   unscrupulous Rick. On behalf of the mighty company Terracor they            
   bring him to an empty space station - but Rick is curious and opens         
   the box... so Charlie has work again, to keep the Critters from eating      
   everybody.
