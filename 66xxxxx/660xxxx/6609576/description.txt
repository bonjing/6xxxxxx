â€œYour royal highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, children. And to those of you who are not highnesses or ladies or gentlemen. All who are here. I bid you welcome. And peace and happiness to all of you. For the disabled children. And for this great, great honor that's been presented to me. To present to you, the most outstanding rock group in the world today. My friends... The Electric Light Orchestra."
