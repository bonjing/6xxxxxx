CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

thx

Encode:

Source Video was generally ok for a first cam.
But it is very very red, and not that bright, also came along with borders.
First 10 mins or so slightly skewed on the bottom left corner, but after that the cam is steady.
Audio is very good for cam audio, could nearly pass as line if there werent some laughing here and there, just had noise and hiss in the background.

Removed borders, lowered red and tried to bring the rest of the colours in shape. black was black but white was red. 
Was hard to find a middleway for the colour tones without having either white faces or showing glare spots.
had to cut the movie in pieces to treat some parts differently, also dark parts needed different settings.
corrected with perspective the first 10mins so you can view the whole picture without cropping anything.
For the video itself its not the sharpest but very watchable for the first release.
Cleaned the audio from hiss and noise, sounds very good, but you have to live with some laughing here and there.
