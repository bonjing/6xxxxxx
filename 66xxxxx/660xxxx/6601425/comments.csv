,mitala13,2011-08-19T11:02Z,"Directions say to disconnect from the Internet before registering with any of the included serials. Unfortunately, when you do that and try to register, the application informs you that you there was an error with the network, to check the settings and try again. And if you allow the application to access the net, just for the time of registration, it states that it is an invalid serial. So I fail to see how you can register this application under any circumstances with the included serials."

This app doesn't need an internet connection to register, so obviously you're failing somewhere."
,iamokaw,2011-08-25T20:11Z,"Not sure he/she is. I'm having the same issue. Tried it on my desktop running Windows 7 ultimate and my laptop running windows XP. Both gave me a ""cannot connect network"" error when I tried to register.

It's clearly attempting to dial home to validate the license."
,iamokaw,2011-08-25T20:13Z,"I don't think they are. I'm running in to the same problem. I attempted to install it on my Windows 7 desktop and my Windows XP laptop. Both gave me a ""cannot connect network"" error. It's clearly attempting to dial home to validate the license.

This would also explain why torrents with previous versions typically have a patched imfc0.dll file."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-08-26T14:59Z,"@iamokaw 

Bullshit. Just disconnect internet before registering. Once regged block the app with a firewall. That's how it's working for others how use their brain, and that's what the install notes say. I tested it myself so I know that it works.

BTW: The keys are keygenned, so why would there be a keygen if the app needs a internet connection to register ? You tell me ......."
,iamokaw,2011-08-26T20:30Z,"Dude, I'm telling you, I did it twice. I physically disconnected my desktop and turned off wifi on my laptop. I installed the program, tried to register and got ""cannot connect network."" What POSSIBLE motivation would I have for making something like that up?

Previous releases by other people included a replacement  imfc0.dll file, and they worked. My guess would be that said file is require for this to work."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-08-28T22:57Z,"@iamokaw 

Either way, it's working for everyone else, so I don't know what's happening at your end.

Just note that registering the app is NOT the same as registering at the webiste. In this is meant registering the app, and for that no ineternet connection is required for none off the Xilisoft apps. It was always like that and it still is the same.

The modified/crack imfc0.dll doesn't mean at all that  it bypasses the online registeration. The imfc0.dll was just another crack, and by then there was no keygen yet for the Xilisoft v6.x  versions. Now there's a keygen for almost all Xilisoft v6.x apps, without the need to reg online."
[V],rambam1776,2011-08-28T23:19Z,"It worked just fine for me, because I DID block the outgoing connection with the firewall. One suggestion though - There is always too great a tendency by tech-savvy types (like the OP) to assume folks know more than they do. Since RH helpfully provided a the block path in his notes, I was able to figure out how to block the firewall connection, but more explicit instructions than just ""do it"" would have been helpful. The Microsoft instructions in the control panel help file were as useless as they always are, so I had to experiment. It's a good way to learn, and I'm not asking for idiot hand-holding, but EXPLICIT step-by-step directions on how to block an outgoing connection in the ""Read This"" file would have been appreciated.

Anyway, the program works, it rocks, and much thanks to RobbingHood."
,bzrwon,2011-09-19T21:32Z,"Well after downloading their video converter and liking it, I thought I'd download this. Right away this was disappointing, tried to install nagware on my pc, MSN and Bing toolbars...wtf, this is meant to be payware, why the hell do they need to do that?
Then after installation (on Vista 32bit) it came up with an error msg, ""immdevice.exe has stopped working"", then crashed halfway through a conversion, bitterly disappointed.
Other than that, all the instructions worked well, lol."
,hn_rene,2011-10-14T13:38Z,"Thank you, I keep coming back for your uploads. Great work !!!!"
,icepax,2011-10-20T16:46Z,"@RobbingHood: You might want to provide better instruction next time for the common Joe to understand. Keep in mind that not all of us are technically proficient. You, I, and a few others might understand your installation instruction - but most don't..."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-10-20T23:46Z,"@icepax

The instructions are already more extensive than others usually provide. Everyone has another firewall, so explaining how exactly to block apps from accessing internet would take many space. n00bs should google the rest instead of expecting others to tell them every little detail, otehrwise they'll never learn."
,ruffshadow,2011-11-08T09:10Z,THX for your great Upload! Work's fine.  \m/    
,Chris_Yaz,2012-04-11T18:46Z,"I've tried more than 20 times, follow the instructions to the T (i have used thousands of cracked programs) yet after it worked once for a couple hours it then failed - always asking for internet connetion to register.
I'm sorry but you've failed."
