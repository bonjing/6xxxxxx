,secobarbital,2011-09-05T14:49Z,"Just received an email from my ISP that the copyright holder, Exquisite Multimedia Inc., is suing for infringement.  Settlement is $200.00.  Copyrightsettlements.com?  Should I take this seriously, or should everyone else heed the warning so they don't end up in my position?"

,haydn70ac,2011-10-06T12:24Z,It's a fake.  There can't be both a superman and a superwoman. 
,voraxith,2011-11-05T19:32Z,"@haydn70ac:

Surprisingly, there actually IS a DC comics superhero named Supergirl -- it's not a fake.  Her name is Kara Zor-El, and she's Clark Kent's/Kal-El's long lost Kryptonian cousin.  She has her own comic book and even an '80s movie starring Helen Slater, and the character was also featured on TV's Smallville.  God damn, I'm such a nerd....

@secobarbital:

Isn't it ironic that you're being sued for copyright infringement for downloading a movie that itself is copyright infringement?"
,Pstar69,2011-12-05T02:53Z,oh yeah!!! thx!! ^^
,secobarbital,2012-01-03T02:15Z,"@voraxith:  sadly enough I hadn't even thought of that!  nothing came of it.  to be sued for copyright infringement you have to be served by federal court, not by email from the entity threatening you.
just wanted to let others know the game this movie company is playing."
