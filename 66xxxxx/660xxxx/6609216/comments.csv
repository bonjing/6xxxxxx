No i dont think so :-/ But you can always just install it with the crack and it will work fine :) (But online mode is not working).

,murphyh25,2011-11-09T05:29Z,"hey, so im verrryyy new to this whole thing.. what do you mean by mounting? i have xp, maybe post a guide as to how to dot this? thanks"
[T],TvFreak,2011-11-09T16:05Z,You will need Deamon tools(Just google it and you will find it...) and then select the image 1 in Deamon tools and press Mount Image. Then the system thinks it is a disk that you put in the computer. And then continue. :)
,murphyh25,2011-11-09T23:20Z,"okay, disc one is mounted, now what?"
[T],TvFreak,2011-11-10T17:17Z,"If you are using Windowns then go to my computer and youll see that the system thinks theres a disk in the drive now,  Then Click the disk symbol and you will find autorun or install or something similar and click that and let it install, and when its asked for image 2 then unmount image 1 in deamon tools and mount image one and click continue install. When install is done, run the patch GTAIV_TU5 in the Crack folder. Then when done put the other crack files in the Crack folder to the folder you installed the game in. ;) Hope you learn something from this :) It is often very similar on other games you download here so i would remember this for future game installs. :)"
,murphyh25,2011-11-11T01:41Z,"alright, thank you sooo much for the heads up.. but one last thing.. im trying to click the e: drive (where it says that the disk is) and it says that the disk may be corrupted or using a format not supported by windows.. help! (im really sorry about all of this, im brand friggin new haha)"
[T],TvFreak,2011-11-12T23:41Z,"Well, i think you can usu winrar to open the installer now, but remember to have the disc mounted though. If you don't have winrar then that is a free program, when installed then double click image 1 and then you will see a list of the files that are on the file, and then open the installer and continue like i said before. Hope this will work..."

,XALTEFMON,2012-04-15T08:53Z,"I didn't find a disk to mount, so I ended up running setup.exe in GTAIV. That seemed to work, but when  I did all the neccessary steps and installed Rockstar Games Social Club, a serial is required. Is there a generator I'm missing?"
[T],TvFreak,2012-05-30T22:15Z,Reinstall and then dont run the game. Add the crack and then run the game.
