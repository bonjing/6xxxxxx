Storyline: Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam (Alec Baldwin) Maitland decide to spend their vacation decorating their idyllic New England country home. While the young couple is driving back from town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog wandering the roadway and crashes through a covered bridge, plunging into the river below. They return home and, based on such subtle clues as their lack of reflection in the mirror and their discovery of a Handbook for the Recently Deceased, begin to suspect they just might be dead. Adam attempts to leave the house to retrace his steps but finds himself in a strange otherworldly dimension referred to as "Saturn," covered in sand and populated by enormous sand worms.
