These AVIs have been properly converted to standard definition colorimetry (they'll display with the correct colors).
Even though most are a little smaller than 350MB they're still of a high quality. Please check the samples (there's no spoilers).
As each episode is encoded to a particular quality their file sizes vary accordingly.
All are encoded using 2 passes and should be playable using any standalone player.
There's no AMC network logo.

If the 720p WEB-DL sources continue to be available as torrents, I'll convert them to AVI and upload them each week until the end of the season, as this series deserves some decent quality AVIs.

Sorry about my upload speed.... it's fairly slow.
