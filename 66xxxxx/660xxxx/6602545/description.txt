Description

LittleSnapper allows you to take screenshots of an entire webpage, or specific portions of your screen in general, without cluttering your desktop with a ton of icons. It then organizes those snaps into a library where you can tag, rate and comment them.

It also comes with some built-in vector tools that allow you to mark up your images with text, callouts, shapes, lines, arrows, blurs and highlighting. Best of all, the annotations are all non-destructive allowing you to hide and show them at a moment's notice. 

Then share the snaps with your clients colleagues and friends. To make that possible, we've built in support for Flickr, image exports, FTP, SFTP and our own web-service especially for LittleSnapper users: QuickSnapper.
