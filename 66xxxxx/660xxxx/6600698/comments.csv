,rafaltrus,2011-08-16T19:24Z,"Here is how to make it work on Mac OS X 10.7 LION

As jacintore has noted, you need to change the file permissions. To do it, open the terminal (just search for it in the Spotlight). Type in the following

chmod u+x /file/path

Now, where it says /file/path, you need to provide the path to the /Contents/MacOs/Plants vs. Zombies file. The easiest way is to go to Finder, Application (or wherever you have the downloaded file), click show the contents of the Plants and Zombies, enter MacOS and drag the Plants vs Zombies file onto the terminal; the path will be posted in the command line.

Hit enter, type in your password, and you should be good to go =)"
