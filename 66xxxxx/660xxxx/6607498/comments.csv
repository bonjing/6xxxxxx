[T],geogaddi000,2011-08-16T23:50Z,I am scouting the internet for a hard copy of this program.  It is very rare.  I had to rip it and re-encode it from YouTube.  I would like to get the DVD directly from Discovery Channel.  Will keep you posted if I get it - I will make a high-res copy of it and post here again.

THANKS! "
