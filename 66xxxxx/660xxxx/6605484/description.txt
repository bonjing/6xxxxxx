The Sims 3 Complete with Expansions and Store Updates to July 2011. This game has been running on my Windows and Mac computers. This is the current way I play sims so I am certain it works. 

Instructions:

PLEASE NOTE: Installation Guide in the Torrent doesn\\\\\\\'t include the following:


Windows:

- Unzip with 7-Zip or equivalent: http://www.7-zip.org/
- Download Daemon Tools Lite or equivalent to mount the .iso files: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads (Third Download on that Page)
- Follow the installation guide in the torrent to complete installation! 

Mac: 

- Too easy if you have a Mac, double click the file to unzip!
- Again, to mount on a Mac, just double click the .iso!
- Follow the installation guide in the torrent to complete installation!  


Please remember to seed after you have downloaded as this has taken quite some time to get it up here! I hope that you find the installation as easy as I did, as there is some confusion about the installation of the Sims 3. As always, please leave questions in the comments below and I will try my best to answer them ASAP!

Cheers
