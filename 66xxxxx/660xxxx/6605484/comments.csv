,ArtieChoke,2011-08-16T02:18Z,"@BobsleighBishop

Currently still seeding so might not be ready for like another couple of days. I am hoping that once it done, people will tell you that it just works and isn't that hard. Cheers"

,GoodTunes,2011-09-17T01:05Z,"No seeds, everybody abandon this, original Seeder has been gone for days."
,us01,2011-09-29T21:10Z,"Lol, I wouldn't download sims 3 but, with 40GB, people will download, install, and then delete or archive the install files and there will be no seeders. This will be close to 100GB after installation. No shit."
,NayJonsey123,2011-10-12T15:37Z,how do u seed
,Sivos,2011-10-13T02:30Z,"It's not really worth seeding, no offense to the uploader, but downloading them separate is much easier and better.  Download game one and while the first expansion is downloading you could be playing the game and get familiar with everything.  Once the first is done, start downloading the second and play with the content of the first expansion.

The store just takes about an hour, so you could download that and install it any time.  40 gigs with just a few seeders is just not worth it, separate is better."
,Demondays1,2011-11-03T05:06Z,Does it work at all?

,Sorika666,2012-03-29T05:01Z,"So I am not sure about other people, but so far I have had this running for days and has yet to make it past 6.1%. I am pretty sure the creator needs to run it so people can get it. As I have plenty of seeders been on here. "
,Ronso1,2012-05-12T14:53Z,"Someone needs to seed, couse nobody gets past 6.1 %, and this is a frickin awsome torrent :)) SOMEONE SEEEEED"
