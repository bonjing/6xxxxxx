Techno / Classic Chicago House Mix - 06/05/2011

A mix from my Infinity Tunes broadcast on June 5, 2011.
I went in with nothing prepared and I thought two things - I'll alternate
between classic house and techno songs and I'll try to have at least
two songs playing at all times.
I even got it up to 5 songs at once around the 86 minute mark and it
sounded surprisingly good.
To pat myself on the back a bit - I think this is the best live mix I've 
done so far and again - it's just scratching the surface of Ableton's
abilities.
