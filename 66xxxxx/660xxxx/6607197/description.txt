Gr 6-9-The first title addresses the national obesity epidemic and its causes. The authors explain how diet pills work, the FDA's rules regarding them, dietary supplements for weight loss, and the increasing rate of diet-pill addiction. Healthy ways to lose and maintain weight are suggested. The second book describes what pain is and how it works, as well as the many types of drugs available to alleviate it, potential side effects, and the possibility of addiction. The plethora of herbal remedies is also discussed, as is the fact that many of them are not scientifically tested. High-quality diagrams, color photos, and relevant case studies are included. The writing is clear, and no previous background is necessary to comprehend these well-organized books.-Kristen M.
