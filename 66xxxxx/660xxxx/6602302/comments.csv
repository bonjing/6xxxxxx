I did not have the chance to test the internet sharing (wireless to LAN) if it will
work for me...looking forward for another version!    Thanks !!"
,redback38,2011-08-14T07:53Z,did you mean this version (6.5) or my last release version(6)...??...
,wulles,2011-08-14T10:58Z,"Hi redack. Again another fine job. I am looking forward to the day you decide to put ALL on one disc. I have a few times seen an impressing bootDVD with all in one. Unfortenately it was on russian, so I was not able to test it, but it looked nice."
,DarthBubba,2011-08-14T19:00Z,"I'm not quite sure what you're looking for, but redback38 has made other Win7-PE DVDs that may fit your needs.  If not, just ask him.

Being specific about what you want the disc to do would help.  ""ALL on one disc"" could result in an unmanageably large image file.

Just a thought. "
,wulles,2011-08-14T19:38Z,So what? DVD= 4700mb
,mbmalone,2011-08-14T20:43Z,"If it fits on CD, it will boot faster but with fewer applications. Some of these Win7 PE's are soooo slow to boot. They work great after they load. You can burn CD image to DVD, if you want. 52x CD will load faster."
,dee_mer80,2011-08-15T00:45Z,I mean the other one version 6....not 6.5....thank you
,DarthBubba,2011-08-15T05:03Z,"@wulles said:""So what? DVD= 4700mb""

DVD-Dual Layer is 7.9 formatted gigabytes; too big for folks trying to boot on a machine w/a single layer DVD reader.  A bootable USB image could be dozens of gigabytes.  My ISP would lock my account for that much activity in one day.

Remember, these PE Windows projects are meant to allow you to start up Windows on a computer other than your own, be productive in some way, then leave no trace of your presence after you're done.  Win-PEs for repair purposes need only bring repair a few relatively small ""fix-it"" programs with them - no need for word processors, spreadsheets, picture editors, 3-D renderers, and so forth.  And since not all computers you will fix (like the ancient creaky stuff I use at work) have even a single layer DVD reader on them, an under-701MB repair PE becomes pretty important.

In any event, it's redback38's project and it's his call.  If you ask him to build something specific in a respectful tone he might just decide to give you a gift.  

Remember to thank him for his efforts - that's just proper netiquette.  Hitting the +1 Quality: link is a good way to show your appreciation too - it's not like he's making money doing this for us.

Cheers"
,redback38,2011-08-17T04:30Z,"@darthBubba....thank you for your explanation of what a pe disk is actually designed to do(saves me the typing lol)......@Wulles.....yes an ""all in one""disc is in the pipeline.....one of the problems IS final disk size,an all in one is ok,but using other ppls creations can be legeally offensive,and also need to be trimmed to curcumvent duplication of the same apps,keeping the disk smaller.its a huge editing task,and the final result can be unusable on older computers with little ram,or just a cd drive with no dvd reading capabilities,Version 7 will be a multiboot,but good ones take substantial time to get right and be usable for all....mostly these days i either keep it under 700MB...or go all out and TRY to keep it at around 1GB....if you have a specific request for a PE disk?....let me know and ill see what i can do to create it for you:-)"
,redback38,2011-08-17T04:38Z,"and yes,i dont make a cent for doing this,but my work needs repair disks of different flavours for different clients,some of them rescue,some networking etc......my next version(6.6)will be a dos games and win7 op/sys for general users and teen students to learn and have some fun with,will come with full 16 bit support,(not as easy as you might expect to implement,Phew,another steep learning curve!)should be out tomorrow,(my holiday project)....stay tuned:-)"
