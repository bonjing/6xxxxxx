Welcome to my 700MB version of my Win7PE_SE project,this issue is primarily aimed at antivirus applications on computers with limited or no access to a dvd drive or usb booting,but with cd drive only..the .iso will fit neatly onto a 700MB disk,has friefox8,IE8,and several updatable antivirus programs.this version also incorporates a new BS explorer shell to use in the PE preinstalled environment...will boot on fairly minimal ram,please read the READ ME file in the torrent,
 INSTRUCTIONS
   burn the .iso to disk and boot it,easy as,or you can EXTRACT THE CONTENTS of the iso to a properly formated USB stick for a travelling anti virus usb boot environment.if you require a more function and feature rich disk for systems with nore ram?...see my other torrents....redback38....version 7 coming soon:-)
