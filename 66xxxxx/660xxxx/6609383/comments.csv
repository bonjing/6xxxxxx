I was running this on vlc media player which ive never had problems with and it kept shutting down at a specific point in the movie. I started using win media player classic, and in both players there are constant skips and parts where the video gets boxy and messed up like when the signal to your tv gets messed up.

I can tolerate this video but if your looking for a good quality one this is not the torrent you want."

Seems like 15.0 mbps is maximum with using DVDFab :S"
