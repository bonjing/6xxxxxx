Violent Soho is the second official studio album of Violent Soho, released on March 9, 2010 on the Ecstatic Peace label. The album contains much of the material off of their first album, We Don't Belong Here, though it has been re-recorded with changes made to some of the songs. Although the album is not technically their first record, it is commonly referred to as their "debut album".
