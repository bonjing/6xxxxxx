Notes:   "Love Me Tender" is slightly edited !

"Make The World Go Away" is from bootleg "The Lost Promo" !

"What Now My Love" features some unusual narration by Elvis !

"Jailhouse Rock/Amen" is a very unusual medley !

"Can't Help Falling In Love" for track 27 is highly unusual - Elvis sings the song to completion , then decides to do a reprise !
 
With covers. Enjoy!
