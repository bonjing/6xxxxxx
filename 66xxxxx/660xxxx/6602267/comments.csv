,64base,2011-08-18T13:20Z,"True. This torrent allows you to install the whole suite of Office without the need for activation, serials or cracks. So this is better in a way where you install and forget."
,Jeffmo1,2011-09-10T01:26Z,Thank you man..
,TheBombio,2011-09-14T23:18Z,"Safe torrent.
Works perfectly.

Simply run the installer and wait until the black command box closes. Once it closes Office has been installed. No need for a key. Wish you could select what it installed though. Only need PowerPoint and Word. :/

Thanks though! :)"
,fatality51,2011-09-17T01:47Z,Thank you so much for this program.  I have been out of work for a while now and am back in school now to learn new job skills.  Money is tight so I couldn't afford this right now.  It helps out a lot having this at home as well as at school.

,64base,2011-10-28T09:55Z,"@DOWNSBRI000 Yes and it's VERY easy to install, double click and run then just wait for 15-25 minutes and in no time you will see Microsoft Office 2007 (the whole suite) installed in the background."
