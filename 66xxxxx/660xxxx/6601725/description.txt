A while ago, a good man called Matrixcn made these wonderful, top quality HD in game cinematic's to replace the old low resolution ones. Even though everyone jumped with joy, some had problems with the video files causing the game to crash.

The fix? To re-encode the videos and then rename the extensions. In short, I've done this for you, so these videos are your best bet if his don't work for you. This will save you time downloading converting programs and doing the work yourself, take this lazy option ;)

Simply copy all of the movie files within this folder and past them in your Resident Evil 4 "Movie" folder, choosing to replace all. You may want to back up your old ones first just in case you still have problems.

Thanks for downloading and please seed!
