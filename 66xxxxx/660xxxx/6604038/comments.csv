,hakuna_matata,2011-08-14T16:36Z,"wo.. I always wanted the Star-Trek Series.. Never telecasted here, so I would love to see this and also can you do the other Original Series. Thanks"
,technosailor,2011-10-14T07:15Z,Thx :) 72 seeders 120 leechers so far.
,technosailor,2011-10-14T18:15Z,"The audio is mono 41Kbps, 48Kbps max, screw you man."
,technosailor,2011-10-15T02:56Z,"I'm gonna have to download this since the more complete torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6533613/Star_Trek_Enterprise_Season_1__2__3__amp__4___Extras_DVDRip_TSV) has low seeding speed, 9 times the leechers and bigger episode sizes."

V-10

Both video and audio are the same quality as HDTV rips that are twice the size.  I did paralel downloads of three STE torrents to decide which to go with and this one is the best.

Your effort is appreciated ILPruny."
