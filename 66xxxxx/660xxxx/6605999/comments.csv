Magnificent work."
,beachbum37,2011-09-05T23:02Z,hey deathmarine1....the games you upload sound great but i am not that good with computers and i tried to install things exactly as you say and still have trouble making them work. Example....i have no idea how to change the language to Japanese on my computer. can you recommend a good simple game so i can learn?
,lostlegends,2011-09-13T02:51Z,"@beachbum37 google ""applocale Context"" try the Alcahest tutorial to instal applocale. this will let you right click an exe and run as japanese. Will not work for all japanese games but it does for most of the good ones. also try installing them with the game .msi to skip lang checks.  "
