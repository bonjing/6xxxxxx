A/7
V/6
There's a slight flicker on the picture and the audio is slightly tinny and there's the usual background noises (mostly muffled audience sounds). The pictures in 4:3 format, but has been bordered a cropped to a 16:9 format looks better when you expand the image... Watchable copy and worth the download if your not wanting to wait for a DVDRip...
Many Thanx to tykoon123 and Biz for the Decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)

@bryenthearist & mikoos29... Why don't you download the torrent or check the uploaders status before you start talking a steaming pile of shite..."

,Erich505,2011-08-22T23:08Z,"Yes it's a fake, notice the uploader specifies Cam in the description. It's a good one tho, and very watchable. Go pay your 12 bucks at the theater. "
