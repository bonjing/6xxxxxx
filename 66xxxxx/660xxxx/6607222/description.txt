03 "Kikyo" January 22, 2011 August 12, 2011 
(æ¡”æ¢—) 

As Logan and Kikyo fought, more police arrive to see the two destroy the area, 
which Kikyo escapes and Logan retreats. Mariko sits silently as her father 
practices his kendo, but smiles when overhearing Hideki tell her father Logan 
is still alive. Yukio and Logan search for a lead and find Yashida clan members 
unloading a secret cargo from a docked ship. The police are in wait for 
the cargo to be dropped off and arrest the clan members. Logan then throws 
Molotov Cocktails and sets the vessel on fire, and then intercepts Hideki before 
he can escape. The cargo is revealed to be Omega Red who has come to Japan for 
revenge on Logan and grabs him with his long metal tendrils.
