The disc comprises the Noam Chomsky lecture "Capital Rules"â€”another articulate and immediately accessible description of Corporate America's unrelenting attack on poor and working class people. From the attack on unions to the well-crafted business propaganda campaigns, Chomsky provides us with a clear picture of how US Capital is leading us down a path of a two-tiered society with islands of extreme wealth in a sea of poverty.
