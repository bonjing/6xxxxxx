I happen to be a great supporter of Indie Music. I think Indie is the beginning of a new musical era. Because its easy to miss a torrent (sometime PB is like a waist dump) I have grouped a few Dutch Treat playlists.  Just because they are simply the best playlists at the moment (For more HQ playlists search for Dutch Treat. I can recommend it. If nobody seeds, leave a message.)

I have scrambled the numbers a bit because for me its more useful to group them as I1=Indie Easy, I2=Indie Mixed and I3=Indie Fast. I4 would be Indie Dance.

Enjoy
