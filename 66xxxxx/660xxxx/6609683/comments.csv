take care "

,Poka-Dot-Pocky,2011-09-15T03:16Z,"Okay, I followed the instructions but when I go to open it an error pops up saying the following.

Error:

C:\Program Files (x86)\DAEMON Tools Pro\DTProHlp.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support.

What should I do?"
