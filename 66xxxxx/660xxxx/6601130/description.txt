Subtitles: English
Date: 2011.08

Director: Gregor Jordan

Genres: Drama | Thriller

Plot:
A convert to Islam sends the U.S. government a tape showing him in three nondescript storage
rooms, each of which may contain a nuclear bomb set to detonate in less than a week. Helen
Brody, an FBI agent in L.A., is tasked with finding the bombs while a CIA "consultant," known
as H, interrogates the suspect who has allowed himself to be caught. The suspect, whose wife
and children have left him and disappeared, seems to know exactly what the interrogation will
entail. Even as H ratchets up the pressure, using torture over Brody's objection, the suspect
doesn't crack. Should H do the unthinkable, and will Brody acquiesce? Is any Constitutional
principle worth possible loss of life?
