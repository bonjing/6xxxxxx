,richardpa,2011-08-15T23:39Z,"Decent CAM copy and a steady download...
A/6
V/7
Audio keeps in sync better and doesn't sound as tinny or as hollow as the 400mb version did. The picture quality is also better, not as much glare on it. Decent and watchable copy. If froggie can stick some line audio on this version then this would be spot on...for a cam...
Many Thanx to froggie100 and MEM"

,darkstar2011,2011-08-17T02:55Z,good torrent i downloaded in 2 hrs :)
,dpbowser123,2011-08-17T04:54Z,"lol At approx 35 min and 25 sec in you here an audience guy say ""WHAT THE FUCK!!"" I had to pause the movie I was laughing so hard. Her body was just so dismantled that not even the great Frankenstein looked more horrific.  Good Cam, good movie... so far lol (Still laughing really hard at the guys expression). :P  "
,AriGold45,2011-08-17T18:20Z,"^^ I heard that too, and was trying to figure out if the guy on the movie said it or if it was an audience member.  Made me crack up too.

I don't know why people are saying this isn't a good copy, it's pretty damn good for a cam, very watchable.  

Obviously not great compared to a DVD rip, but I think waiting for a better version is stupid, this is just fine. Thanks Froggie"
,irishtampon,2011-08-17T23:27Z,thanks froggie i owe you a BJ
,LoveSickDope,2011-08-20T05:18Z,"Great Quality.
No noise pollution from audience members.
9.2/10 for camera quality. Very good

The ending was the best part. lol
I like how they tied it together in the end too.

I will buy the movie when it comes out on dvd to add to my FD Series collection."
,WaxMaNuts384,2011-08-22T06:58Z,Good quality for a cam. Ending is the best.
,WaxMaNuts384,2011-08-22T07:00Z,"You can hear the filmer's cell phone vibrate a few times, and there is a buzz noise during quiet scenes but movie though.  "
