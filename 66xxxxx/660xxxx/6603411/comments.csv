,mustafa-crap,2011-08-15T06:49Z,"When I stopped seeding there was in excess of 50 seeders. By that time I think I have done my bit.

What pisses me off is that of the 18 books I have posted lately is that there is not one thanks comment, just a wine from someone who not shared anything on TPB.

You ungrateful bunch of bastards can find your books from some one else. "
