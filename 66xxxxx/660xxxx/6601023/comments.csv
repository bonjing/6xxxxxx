,TPBWhore,2011-08-13T05:36Z,Same. No RARs for me. Will wait for the unRARed EZTV release.
,TPBWhore,2011-08-13T06:56Z,Unrared version here... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6601146/Torchwood_S04E06_720p_HDTV_X264-DIMENSION
,dingo8baby,2011-08-13T07:57Z,"if there is an urar'd version available, people will download that instead. 

The only reason sceneline is even around is because there are no other consistent 720p uploaders on TPB.

rar files are shit, sceneline is a lazy botnet program, and www.speed.cd needs to be ddos'd"
