Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Portable.
This version uses batch files to put files in the right place. No manual moving needed.

1. Unzip
2. Run Minecraft.bat
3. Click Play Offline.

I\'ve been thinking of making this self-extracting, but that\'d be too easy for you.

Mods included, but the original jar file is in the bin folder. Change the name if you want to. All mods are in the mods directory in the zip. There\'s the Bombastic Sandstone Test World in the saves directory, I started making something there before making this portable archive.

If you like it, buy it. Seriously.

I\'ll seed as long as I can, or get it off Dropbox.

Many thanks to the Mojang and the mod developers.
