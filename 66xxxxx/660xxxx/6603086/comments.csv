,pooloop,2011-08-14T12:20Z,"@Darktee this works just fine in a ps3,I spent a lot of time in the summer working on a smaller but better quality file that works just fine in most systems,And I just checked this again in my brother ps3 and it works great and even if I do say so myself looks great,Sort your codecs out mate."
