The fourth in this hugely successful compilation series and West End stage show, Dreamboats and Petticoats Four transports the listener back to a different timeâ€“when good old fashioned rockâ€™n'roll ruled the airwaves and dancefloors. Following on from the previous three, Dreamboats and Petticoats Four is filled with classic tracks from the late 50s and early 60s from the likes of Elvis, Franki Valli, Cliff Richard and Buddy Holly.
