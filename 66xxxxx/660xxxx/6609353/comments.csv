,arkaniack,2011-08-22T16:17Z,a way to enable perks please?
,Desolator4u,2011-09-01T09:31Z,"good torrent. i have installed it with Killing Floor.exe and have no probs what so ever playing on Tunngle. BUT, how the hell do we change our name!? Perks do work by the way, i've only tested it online though. Again, how canwe change out in-game name? Thanks"
,Desolator4u,2011-09-03T04:58Z,"Found it. Open the rev.ini file in the root folder after installation, and the last line will be PlayerName= so just put what you want to show up as your in-game name. 
Good torrent. Much love"
,anakon4,2011-09-04T09:51Z,You say its no steam but when i start in main menu multiplayer is say i must start steam.What i must do?
,Desolator4u,2011-09-06T07:02Z,@anakon4 You have to launch the game with the RUN_KF.exe file in the root folder.
,druid513,2011-09-22T14:24Z,"this one is good, just run set up, then Run_KF and play multiplayer. No need moving crack thing, no need update."

C:\program files (x86)\killingfloor\steamclient.dll 
(trojan.dropper.pgen)

I don't know what that is, but as soon as I installed and tried to run the application, MAMB picked it up.

Thanks, but no thanks!"
,bud4hugs,2011-10-08T07:52Z,"Why was my comment deleted? My Malwarebytes detected a trojan.. in the application file. As soon as I launched, MAMB launched and said it was quarantine.. I was really hoping to play this game."

,ubuntu179,2011-10-30T20:39Z,"You gotta edit the rev.ini in order to change your name. It's no big deal.

Nice torrent, from all the versions out there, this is the first one which actually worked for me ( using Tunngle )"
