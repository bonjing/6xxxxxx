This exciting new textbook for introductory psychology helps to open studentsâ€™ minds to the idea that psychology is all around us. Authors RON COMER and LIZ GOULD encourage students to examine what they know about human behaviour and how they know it; and open them up to an appreciation of psychology outside of the classroom. Psychology Around Us helps students see the big picture by stressing the interconnected nature of psychological science.
