And Musy, great upload."
,tuggtugger2,2011-10-02T04:28Z,"game extracts and runs, no issues.

Worth noting, the second i jumped into take a drive, i couldn't move, so i went into the controls and dear god musy, you have the most ridiculous key setup i've ever seen. After resetting that to something a normal human would use i went back in game.

Dear god, the only thing i could think was ""this is a half ass version of GTA"" and dear goodness it was. 

After 20 minutes of playing, i decided i'm not even going to do the campaign, i just straight-out deleted it.



tl;dr: Torrent works fine, just reset the controls to your liking. Game itself sucks ass."
