I'm not burning it I'm streaming it, and It doesn't work on the xbox.

Anyone got a link for one that will ?"
,DemonicArc,2011-08-23T23:10Z,"@Tomhannah
Thats' your problem, xbox is extremely picky about what formats, dimensions, and framerates it plays, don't stream it ,burn it, or get the convertx and convert it straight into the xbox native format.

@Bob_Munden
Because it's not a blue ray, it's a blue ray rip, it can play in a same way that a cd rip can play on an mp3 player without a cd drive or a dvd rip can play on a pc without a need for the dvd."

Great torrent!"
,LuigiVuoto,2011-09-01T05:46Z,"The movie isn't bad if you're completely wasted and nothing else is on and you're living a life empty of human contact.

Otherwise, the movie is pure trash, and not even good trash.

Thanks for the upload!"
