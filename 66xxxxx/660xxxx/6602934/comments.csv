,greywolf2897,2011-09-04T10:22Z,"Ok guys, what you need to do is download a program called Daemon Tools Lite, Its like a virtual Cd drive so you can run the file."
,jew_59,2011-09-11T05:04Z,"I have Daemon Lite. I mount the level file and I get the list of stuff in the file, but RS doesn't see the drive when I try to add. What's missing?"

,freakyferret,2011-09-11T06:08Z,"What files do I burn to the cd? The RAR files or do I extract it and burn those files?
This is my first download the requires an actual cd."
,freakyferret,2011-09-11T07:46Z,"I need I step by step for this nothing wants to work.
I burned it and it doesn't run any program, just opens the folders..."
,freakyferret,2011-09-11T09:10Z,"Never mind, I figured it out. It would help if it said you need to download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6602908/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5_-_Jowder that first. If I have more issues I'll be back, but thanks for such an awesome upload :D"

,robbins.n,2011-09-13T22:27Z,anyone have access codes to unlock everything on each disk?
,krazzee530,2011-10-04T03:16Z,Hey has anyone figured out the activation code????
,pabolton,2011-11-05T02:16Z,"1. download rosetta stone the programme (this is just the language application which you install upon rosetta stone. the link to this is above in the information about this torrent.
2. once you have rosetta stone, dont launch , copy crack first, and dont open just to play safe."
,holmesh,2011-12-16T19:35Z,"I have two Rosetta Stones from the Jowder program download.  When I try to open one, it tells me it has a 2120 error.  When I open the other one, it lets me go until level two and then will not allow any further usage without activation code.  What is going on here?  I see other people have similar problems."
