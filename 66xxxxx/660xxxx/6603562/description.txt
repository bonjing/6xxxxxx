Manjaro Linux is a Linux Distribution based on Arch Linux. It is still under development, but an initial testing release is already available. Our aim is to create a light linux distribution, which is simple, up-to-date, fast and user friendly and which follows the K.I.S.S principle. We are using the Desktop Environment Xfce, which is light but powerfull. Arch Linux is a great GNU/Linux distribution, but installing and configuring it, needs some time and experience. So we improved Arch Linux. We created a more user friendly installation process, wrote bash scripts for managing graphic drivers, configured xfce with some useful functions and a GUI settings manager is also planed. Just try it. ;)
