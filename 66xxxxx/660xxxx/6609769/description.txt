Teen Wolf is an American television series that currently airs on MTV, and in reruns on TeenNick.

The series revolves around social outcast Scott McCall, a young lacrosse-playing student at Beacon Hills High School. His life drastically changes when he is bitten by a werewolf one night after leaving a high school party. Upon discovery that he is a werewolf, with the help of his best friend, Stiles, and the mysterious werewolf, Derek, he is forced to learn to balance his newfound identity among the many dangers that it presents with his teenage life. Everything is going fine, until he meets the new girl in town, Allison Argent. Scott automatically falls for her, and becomes distracted from his werewolf life. The theme of finding your place is a prevalent undertone in the series that is mirrored by the pack mentality of werewolves.
