"A unique contribution to the field of American Indian ethnology... This information has never been compiled before, and I doubt that many ethnologists in the field have ever suspected the extent to which poison was used among North American Indians. This book significantly extends our understanding." Wayne Van Horne, Associate Professor of Anthropology, Kennesaw State University
