Catfood Earth v3.10.0252 Portable

Displays a customizable view of the Earth as your Desktop wallpaper.Catfood Earth transforms your desktop wallpaper into a regularly updated view of our planet's surface. Your wallpaper can now show current cloud cover, weather radar, earthquakes, the extent of daylight and nighttime, political borders and more.


Catfood Earth has three themes. The default is the natural theme that will display the extent of daylight and nighttime aas well as the global cloud cover (updated every three hours).

As well as choosing a theme you can fully customize eight different layers: the day image, cloud cover, the night image, time zones, political borders, places, earthquakes and weather radar (US locations only).

The Time Zones theme color codes countries and regions to show their current time zone. Clocks at the top of the screen show you the current time in each zone. As countries enter or leave daylight savings the map is updated.

You can choose to add places to the map, in which case Catfood Earth can also display the local time for cities, friends, company offices, etc. This theme is ideal for frequent travelers or to display locations as a conversation piece in your company's reception area.

Lastly the Earthquakes theme shows recent earthquake data from the USGS. You can display earthquakes from up to the past twenty-four hours, and from magnitude 2.5 or higher. The display for each quake fades over time so it's easy to pick out the more recent events. It's also possible to show the location, time and magnitude of each quake.

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
-----------------------------------------------------

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:

    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6487418

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.

15. No Promises ... No Debts!

To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
