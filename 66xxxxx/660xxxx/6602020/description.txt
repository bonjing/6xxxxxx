For this project, music icons and pop culture visionaries JAY-Z and Kanye West have joined their extraordinary talents to form the group `THE THRONEâ€™ and confirm the most anticipated album and touring event of the year, WATCH THE THRONE. The longtime friends and music innovators inspired each other to new heights with their collaboration on WATCH THE THRONE recorded in person at various locations around the world. Over a year in the making and a truly global affair, the duo recorded in London and Bath in the UK, Abu Dhabi, Sydney, Paris, and New York City. Though shrouded in secrecy, the album has already been heralded a `masterpieceâ€™ by those who have heard it, and features production from The RZA, The Neptunes and Kanyeâ€™s longtime collaborator Mike Dean. The short list of featured vocals includes Frank Ocean, BeyoncÃ©, Curtis Mayfield and Mr. Hudson. (Amazon)
