21st Century Stealth Sub

Countless movies and novels over nearly a century have fictionalized the secretive brotherhood of the submariner. But few of us outside this close-knit community ever get to witness what really goes on deep beneath the ocean waves. Get an in-depth look at the technology, allowing her to provide overwhelming firepower and huge Special Forces deployments any time, anywhere that it is needed.
Join Captain Crites and the crew of USS Florida as they experience the real world stresses, dangers, tests and triumphs of life on board one of only four existing SSGN. Get an in-depth look at the technology that allows this sub to go deeper, remain submerged longer, and stay quieter than almost any other sub in the world. And witness the secret weapons that lay hidden within her hull, allowing her to provide overwhelming firepower and huge Special Forces deployments any time, anywhere that it is needed. This is a new weapon for a new war. Come aboard as National Geographic takes a ride on the 21st Century Submarine.
