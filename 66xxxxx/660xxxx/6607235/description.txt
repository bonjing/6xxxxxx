Tom Hanks writes, directs and co-stars in this refreshing, big-hearted comedy that captures the overnight triumph on an American rock band during the glory days of rock and roll.

When a young appliance salesman agrees to fill in for an injured drummer in a local talent show, four shooting stars are born. Faster than you can say That Thing You Do, a Play-Tone Records executive (Hanks) signs the group and catapults them to fame as their signature tune skyrockets to the top of the charts!
