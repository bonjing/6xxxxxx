Information
------------------------------

Chris Terrill goes in search of some of the world's biggest storms. His mission is to get as close as possible and find out why people continue to live in their deadly path.


1)  Tornado 
Chris Terrill travels 30,000 miles across the American Midwest during one of the most active tornado seasons for 50 years. After eight weeks of chasing savage twisters and meeting some of their victims, he gets within touching distance of a vicious tornado in Nebraska. Then a second one heads straight for him.

2)  Hurricane 
Chris Terrill tracks two enormous hurricanes and tries to get directly in the path of destruction. Still dazed after the impact of Hurricane Gustav, the southern states of America are told to brace themselves for one of the biggest storms ever recorded - Hurricane Ike, which has already devastated Cuba. After a frantic chase across America, Chris finally reaches coastal Galveston, Texas, where he is warned that anybody remaining by the sea faces 'certain death'.

3)  Firestorm 
Chris Terrill attempts to find one of the rarest of all storms - the terrifying firestorm. He travels to southern California at the height of the fire season when conditions can lead to devastating conflagrations which can destroy whole forests and towns. He joins a team of frontline firefighters, each one a convicted criminal, who have chosen to fight fires instead of serving their time behind bars.

4)  Monsoon 
In this episode, he chases the Great Asian Monsoon across India to experience the impact it has on those living in its path. For some like the farmers the monsoon provides rain and life, but for others it brings nothing but death and destruction. His journey ends in Mumbai where his luck nearly runs out as he tries to film the monsoonal sea.
