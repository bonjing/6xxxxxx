,northwind_highlander,2011-08-15T04:43Z,"you know, i really wish people would do a little googling before they post anything... this is a complete bullshit torrent. only 1 other person decided to make it known that season 5 is still airing... and thank you positron for your common sense...

now, to the rest of anyone who thinks that this is a torrent worth downloading, remember this was upped yesterday, and the fucking season doesnt even stop airing till the 28th of this month... obviously its not complete because nobody would get the tv rips done till after the last airdate, and the dvd wont go on sale till after a few monts after the last air date for the season....

this is why we should ban little kids from uploading anything, as well as retards, and altzheimers patients... the question is which category did the uploader fit into lol...

p.s. please, nobody get offended at this comment, i rant on any torrent i find that is illegit. dont think anyone here is special, cuz im not narrowing anyone out, i show everyone the same attention lol."
