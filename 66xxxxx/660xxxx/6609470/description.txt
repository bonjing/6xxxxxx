Rookie Blue S1D1

A group of young, rookie police officers must learn to adapt to their jobs and meet the expectations of their friends, families and co-workers.

01. Fresh Paint
Triumph turns to humiliation when a high-stakes take-down of a suspect goes awry. Andy McNally has made a critical rookie mistake, ruining a long-running undercover drug sting, and tries to make up for it by going face to face with a volatile gunman who already has one man's blood on his hands.
02. Mercury Retrograde
As the other rookies attempt to hunt down a violent escaped convict, Andy gets a lesson in the dangers of undercover work when she and her training officer, Detective Sam Swarek, search for a missing informant whose cover has been blown. Swarek's rogue tactics on the job aren't all that Andy finds troubling -- there's also a surprising, undeniable attraction between the two of them.
03. Fite Nite
While other rookies get ready to duke it out at the police department's annual "Fight Night" charity event, Andy wrestles with a dilemma of her own: Should she keep a promise to protect a domestic abuse victim who has been repeatedly let down by the system - even if it means breaking police protocol to do the right thing?
