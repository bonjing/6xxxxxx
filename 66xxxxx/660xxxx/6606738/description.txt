This slim volume should have been titled " The King Tiger - a photoessay", as it consists of a series of photographs with (mostly) attached captions. Action shots are rare, and include the well-worn "newsreel" sequences. However, at its price, it's probably not very bad value. One still needs to wait for Jean Restayn to turn his remarkable gifts to a "King Tiger" title to do full justice to the subject.
