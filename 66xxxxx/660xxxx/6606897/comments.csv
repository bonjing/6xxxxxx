As well as doing full HD, h264/x264 (mostly common in *.MKV-Files) also works for lower resolusions! Lower resolutions with a better compression format like h/x264, means that the files provided here could be nearly lossless in quality as well as possibly being as large or smaller, depending on level of compression/loss... Stop living in the 90's! ;)"

Meanwhile i would like to know what codecs are you talking about."
