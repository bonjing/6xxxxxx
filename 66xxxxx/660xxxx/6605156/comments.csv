You sit there and wait for some real positive info on what can actually help you, and then it goes on and on in one endless battering of all the things that cant help you! - Thats ok .. But to me it was more a war against all the established than a real wish to help any individual with cancer .I just went through a radiation and chemo therapy treatment, and it did help me! The tumor on my neck went away .He claims such treatment does NOTHING the like ...Bullshit ...Sure some of the parts he said, scared me, and a lot sounded possibly true, but saying : Radiation and chemo does NOTHING to help you, is a sheer lie! - He had a real sick appearance anyway ...hatefull and agitating for his own secret agenda ..not a moment did he cared for any human living person on this earth ...A very discouraging and disappointing doc ..I will not even seed this shit ... Which is not normal for me ...I do not spread this shit ...thats that ..  "
