,peer8ship,2011-08-20T11:04Z,"pulki..pulki...paluuki...*sigh* when are you going to realize that upping ipad/ipod/iphone IOS apps here is POINTLESS. eveyone who has already jailbroken their devices and installed the necessary repos are getting their *.ipa fix through installous4 (or even appcake). why in the heck would they even download this to their pc, then upload it to their ipad when they can download straight to their ipad installed without the hassle of transferring them from a pc??

torrents and IOS idevices do not mix well. you're (kindof) forgetting the whole point of torrents in general and thepiratebay. TPB is mainly for linux/win pc's.

if you've somehow obtained a new *.ipa app/game/whatever and cracked it with crackulous..bla bla why not just join hackulous or talk to the peeps at apptrackr and get your app loaded onto their sites. the visibility of your torrents here is really pathetic, just so you know most IOS users don't even come here. wisen up pulki. thanks for the torrents anyway. :)"

1. if TPB is for Linux and PC, then why there is a Category for iPad/iPhone?

2. Dude there are many people who dont have high internet Speed, and are not able to direct download the Big apps from installous or desktop.

3. Think from other people's point of view, not only out view.
Thanx"

Thx for the info man. I as an IPad noob didn't know how easy to use installous was for getting cracked apps, only used it for installing apps on my ipad from the pc.
And your right it makes these kind of uploads redundant!!! And even better no need for the Itunes gestapo ;)"
,wiedeler,2011-09-14T22:22Z,do you need to jail brake your ipad for this???
,pulkit007,2011-09-15T11:10Z,Yes. Installing paid app automatically means that the iPad has to be in jailbreak state
,URLEMU,2011-10-19T09:01Z,The list looks good but still waiting for the seed.
