In The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein explodes the myth that the global free market triumphed democratically. Exposing the thinking, the money trail and the puppet strings behind the world-changing crises and wars of the last four decades, The Shock Doctrine is the gripping story of how Americaâ€™s ''free market'' policies have come to dominate the world-- through the exploitation of disaster-shocked people and countries.

At the most chaotic juncture in Iraqâ€™s civil war, a new law is unveiled that would allow Shell and BP to claim the countryâ€™s vast oil reservesâ€¦. Immediately following September 11, the Bush Administration quietly out-sources the running of the ''War on Terror'' to Halliburton and Blackwaterâ€¦. After a tsunami wipes out the coasts of Southeast Asia, the pristine beaches are auctioned off to tourist resorts.... New Orleansâ€™s residents, scattered from Hurricane Katrina, discover that their public housing, hospitals and schools will never be reopenedâ€¦. These events are examples of ''the shock doctrine'': using the publicâ€™s disorientation following massive collective shocks â€“ wars, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters -- to achieve control by imposing economic shock therapy. Sometimes, when the first two shocks donâ€™t succeed in wiping out resistance, a third shock is employed: the electrode in the prison cell or the Taser gun on the streets.

Naomi Klein (born May 8, 1970) is a Canadian author and social activist known for her political analyses and criticism of corporate globalization.
