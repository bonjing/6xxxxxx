About movie:
A young man named Anderson can not arrange his personal life. With his former girlfriend he had left so suddenly that for a year then went black as thunder. His friend, hope and support in any situation, he could no longer endure this state of a friend and asked him to marry a stranger. Without thinking twice, Anderson makes a marriage proposal unfamiliar to the waitress. That, to everyone's surprise, agreed. Later, however, it appears that the call for marriage and to agree - it's not so bad, but bear acquaintance with her parents - what with the one from the other side - how much harder test.
