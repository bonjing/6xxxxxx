Storyine: Two city-boy brothers, one a charismatic optimist, the other a whining corporate sell-out, return to the countryside for their father's funeral. On checking out his decrepit estate the boys find one of their dad's ancient friends hiding in a closet with a bag full money. Whilst they decide what to do the pensioner is left to suffocate in the closet, leaving them with a much bigger problem to deal with; tell the police, or leave the body in his own home and pretend nothing happened (keeping the money in the process). This opens their world up to a series of bizarre incidents resulting in the village's quirky population gently decreasing during their short stay.

Release Notes Even though this source was a "PROPER" the AR was 2.087, which made everything look tall and slightly squashed, another source was 16:9 and still looked wrong. It seems no one could make up their mind what the true AR was, as no details of the actual AR could be found that it was filmed in, this release has been changed to 2.35:1 as it looks better.
