In this new CD, recorded a month after 9/11, Americaâ€™s finest social historian examines the role, and response, of artists in society, and particularly, during wartime. With his distinctive blend of low key wit, expansive knowledge of history, and Sherlockian ability to uncover the real stories of this country underneath the detritus of corporate disinformation and monoculture, Zinnâ€”through the words and actions of the likes of Langston Hughes, Mark Twain, Eugene Oâ€™Neill, Ford Madox Ford, and Joseph Hellerâ€”explains that pride in oneâ€™s country comes not from the words and deeds of the government, but from the actions of working people.

Howard Zinn is the author of the best-selling ''People's History Of The United States'' (over a million copies sold), and numerous other works of history, politics, and biography.
