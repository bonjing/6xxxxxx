,The.Buzzsaw,2011-08-27T03:23Z,This is not a fake asshole. It's not my fault if you can't read and follow the directions. I paid $35 for this program and it works fine for me and many others. 
,jclu13,2011-08-28T23:47Z,dude you got scammed when you bought this homebrew channel is free not 35$
,colorkukac,2011-09-12T11:39Z,why would you pay $35 if you can get these stuff for free from the internet? (just the way how many of us did it)
,LBoogie48,2011-09-14T23:47Z,yea dude. you definitely got scammed. this is free.

,ciunamis,2012-01-04T13:40Z,can i use CD instead SD?
,leeflooper,2012-02-15T19:14Z,"Wii's dont read CDs, so no you have to use an SD card, you could use an 8GB SD so long as its not SDHC, and your black wii wont play copied game discs cause only the older wii can read DVD, playing from a hard disk is the was forward with a USB loader program. Regardeless of whats in this torrent, I'd recommend ppl to use google to find a forum with ppl who know how to softmod a wii, they will no doubt provide all the links you need for free. Basically this software was sold to torrent owner, if someones unscrupulous enough to sell shareware, I would not trust the software they distributed."
,Zstar,2012-03-29T19:46Z,"go to WIIHACKS.com or google search it, DO NOT pay for it, as its free, if you have paid for it, then you HAVE been scammed and frauded so do try to get your money back,and this will brick your wii if you dont have the right syestum menu as every version requires a different method"
,matthews8,2012-04-26T19:06Z,what system menu does this require?
,ban4321,2012-05-02T14:28Z,"the softmod i used for my wii works fine.. i did my research.. i have bannerbomb for you 4.2 and down menu users.. i personally had to use letterbomb for MY wii because its the only thing that works for system menu 4.3. i have usb loader, multiple media players, dvd players and loaders, emulators w/ games, strobe features (epilepsii), and much more.. it all works fine. and as far as your price of 35$ goes.. fuck that. i didnt pay squat. "
,ban4321,2012-05-02T14:30Z,"my wii boots DOL files from both usb storage device or SD.
