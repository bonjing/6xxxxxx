I've decided to test this version. This version is more to my liking with TAB browesing fixed etc etc.

Iâm  switching to this and use it as often as I allows.  Nice work mate.

Why is it so fast?  is there something that M$ and Mozzila (Firefox) can do to get your speeds into their browers?"

The webpage is always on high priority. From the second you load the browser it starts loading the wepage very quickly, even before the browser has fully loaded.

Also, having the software programming very reliable helps.

Im keeping going to keep making and releasing updates. If you want, send me your email address and ill let you know when a new release comes out.

Im working on a whole new design. Its called benz web browser 2.0. Has alot a new features. The look is nearly the same and still easy to use as well as very fast. Im working on speed inprovements.

How many computers have you got it installed on then? Just would like to know out of intrest.

Thanks"
