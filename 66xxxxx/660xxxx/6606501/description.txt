Not too many artists can blur the line between sorrow and eccentric playfulness, but Sia Furler manages to do it flawlessly. Furler's breakthrough success in America came after her single "Breath Me," from her 2006 album, "Colour the Small One" was featured in the series finale of HBO's "Six Feet Under." She also is known amongst indie music fans for her work with United Kingdom band Zero 7.
