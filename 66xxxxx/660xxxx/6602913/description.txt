Celebrating 5 years with a FREE download!
The 2011 SONIC BLOOM festival marked our fifth anniversary!! Thanks to all of your support over the years, the project that started as a late night experiment has grown into a full-fledged headlining machine complete with all original HD eye candy. To celebrate what is also our 400th live release we decided to give you a copy of the anniversary show, for FREE. No strings attached. If fact, we would be delighted if you passed this show on to all of your friends and we could cue up a world wide dance party to celebrate! Seriously folks, thank you for your support and see you at the shows!!
