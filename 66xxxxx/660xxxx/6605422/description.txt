
aight ppl, for y'all that asked for it, special thanks to TehParadox Comunity, ALI 213 and Tanauser :) and to everyone that keeps making good hours in shogun 2 possible. :)
there, is the dlc, + a fix, and the patch 7, is my own, i edited so that wako raiders, hattori bandits and marathon monks got some of their special abilities possible, like deploying anywhere, and such. 
btw, i LOVE u CA :P i'd pay the price for the DLC's, but i won't get an international card to buy the dlc's, not just yet ;*
