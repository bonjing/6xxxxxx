At this point you can you should block the App with firewall, Little Snitch o simply disconnect from the internte. Select ""Purchase"" > ""Purchase by phone"", enter the installation code you got to the keygen and press ""Generate"" button in the keygen. Copy the Serial and Activation Code on the Painter installer.

Enjoy!"

When the Core Keygen opens there is a serial number in the top box. I leave it there because I see no other options. I add the activation code I find in Painter, which turns red. When I press the Generate button I get a new serial number. When I press Activate, I get an ""Invalid installation code"" message. The Patch button is greyed out and doesn't work. So where do I come up with a valid installation code>"

,snes_83,2011-11-13T19:16Z,"I had a problem. The ""next"" button would not work when trying to purchase by phone. Here is how to fix it. Delete these two files. This also resets the 30 day trial period. After following these steps, the program registers perfectly.

(copied from: http://megarapid.net/forums/t/737973.aspx)

When the 30 day demo has expired, to restart the time limit all you need to do is delete two files from your /Library/Preferences/ folder.

Open Finder. Press CMD-Shift-G.

Type: "" /library/preferences "" in the field (without spaces or quotes).

Look for two files. One is called: nTitles Product Licenses IV. The other is a randomly generated number which looks like this *********_ID, with the asterisks replacing whatever hex code the file generated when the software first launched.

Delete these two files.

Restart Corel Painter 11. The demo now has a reset demo time.

This also worked on Corel Painter 10."

,albyc,2012-03-30T08:35Z,"choose 'Purchase' => 'Phone Purchase' then just follow the instructions on Core Keymaker.

it worked fine for me. thanksss"
,neightron,2012-04-25T04:09Z,"The keygen works perfectly. Not very often have I seen good keygens for OS X. This keygen is awesome. Well designed and more importantly, works to unlock the trial version of painter 12.

Legit."
