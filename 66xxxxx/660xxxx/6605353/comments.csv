,Cronax11,2011-08-23T03:09Z,LOve it. Must be done in safe mode. I have tried all other way to help others. But Safe mode worked. Thanks. :)
,akdovodka,2011-08-23T16:32Z,"Wait what?? must i put my computer into safe mode when downloading, extracting or installing?"
,Humvee H2,2011-08-25T17:48Z,too hard to instal
,kopimi1911,2011-08-30T18:27Z,"Works perfectly. Installs easy.
1. Install AV software as trial.
2. Restart computer,press F8 on loading screen to enter/choose Safe Mode.
3. Use trial reset (TR) software to extend AV software to 2045.
4. Restart computer as per normal.
5. Update and scan.
6. Cheers to fiesta569!"
,wtfidk24,2011-09-03T23:20Z,How can i check if it what year it expires?
,akshay101,2011-09-04T07:00Z,u dont check the year...u see the days left
,yonnab,2011-09-13T17:05Z,how do i choose safe mode?
,Browse.Torrents,2011-09-14T16:22Z,Thanks...
,miserablemad,2011-09-19T20:38Z,"Thanks for this!  

For everyone who is using this I would also recommend a software Firewall such as Comodo Firewall.

For people who are having troubles getting into safe mode you can hit F8 as the machine is booting up or choose Safe-Mode from the System Configuration screen (Start, Run, ""msconfig""/ Boot tab)"
,rixst,2011-09-21T08:24Z,"Issues for me on Vista(x64)
1. Install AV software as trial.(done)
2. Restart computer,press F8 on loading screen to enter/choose Safe Mode. (done)
3. Use trial reset (TR) software to extend AV software to 2045.(done)
4. Restart computer as per normal.(would not load until I UNINSTALLED this program in safe mode. Not sure if it is just me who has had this problem, but I could not make this work.)"
,g4gerrard,2011-09-21T14:18Z,"GUYS... after I installed this, I feel that my browser becomes slower to open anything... does anyone feel the same??"
,Sarmatae1,2011-09-28T23:40Z,"Fuck this, is my opinion. There is too much dissension in the comments for both versions of this software to make me willing to give this a shot. Too few downloads and not enough positive or intelligible feedback. 

And you shouldn't have to install anything in Safe Mode. No thank you. Moving on."
,kabutu_11,2011-10-02T14:36Z,"works fine for me, just install in safe mode..thanks man!!"
,kabutu_11,2011-10-02T14:38Z,"@g4gerrard GUYS... after I installed this, I feel that my browser becomes slower to open anything... does anyone feel the same??
> i'ved experienced this, this is maybe due to the anti-phishing feature of the antivirus"
,yonnab,2011-10-08T18:12Z,how do i choose safe mode??????????
,AvalonSummit,2011-10-17T03:12Z,"Worked perfectly for me, thank you so much fiesta!"
,rivelino86,2011-10-28T20:06Z,"My Bitdefender is not updating...

It keeps showing this msg, ""To benefit from signature updates after 30 days since installation, you must configure a Bitdefender account!""

How to get rid of the above msg & start auto updates...?"
[V],AUDI-A4,2011-10-30T13:27Z,rivelino86 first you activate the registration account at the time of installation then activate in safe mode for activate license
,yonnab,2011-10-30T17:46Z,how do i choose safe mode? i restarted my computer after installing trial mode. i pressed f8 but still couldn't install full version. can u please help? 
,Sfinish,2011-10-30T18:21Z,"Thanks for the torrent AUDI-A4. 
However, I'm experiencing the same problem with the user rivelino86. 
At first I didn't register and went straight to safemode and activated the reset til 2045. 
Then I saw your comment and then uninstalled the reset, registered an account with an email address, got an activation link to the email, and my activation was confirmed.
When I tried updating without the reset til 2045, the update worked. 
And then I did the reset til 2045 in the safemode and rebooted with normal settings. 
Update isn't working and keeps telling me ""To benefit from signature updates after 30 days since installation, you must configure a Bitdefender account!""

What should I do?"
[V],AUDI-A4,2011-10-31T04:20Z,Sfinish and rivelino86 wait your update problem will be solve soon
[V],AUDI-A4,2011-10-31T08:32Z,Sfinish and rivelino86 try this new activator of bitdefender 2012 hope this will help you upadte problem after activate but please uninstall previous 2011 patch then apply this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6784688/liQeNSoft_Bitdefender_Activator_2012[A4]
,sammemannen,2011-11-01T01:50Z,"This did not work for me.

First I installed it, then I rebooted in Safe Mode and used first the crack included with this torrent, did not work. Uninstalled. Installed once again and used the crack u linked above, it said it was no activated but didnt work. 

YES I RAN THE CRACKS IN SAFEMODE :)"
,makmak1980,2011-11-01T13:41Z,"I have the same issue as Sfinish and rivelino86, this was an upgrade for me from 2011 which worked great. I have uninstalled and reinstalled with the new patch listed just above as well. I cannot update and get the ""To benefit from signature updates after 30 days since installation, you must configure a Bitdefender account!"" 
I get the patch to work but no updates allowed. Please advise."
[V],AUDI-A4,2011-11-01T17:22Z,makmak1980 when you install bitdefender 2012 you must register in account then choose the option 30 days trial then update then activate new patch

,Anonyhor5,2011-11-06T21:27Z,OK if u guys are still having problems with the updates try turning off your firewall. everything is working fine now
,TheBatDad1989,2011-11-07T23:35Z,Hey people for some reason my installation just hangs there at the scan download and install bar with everything staying on 0%... also at the start where the downloading installer comes up the bar just evaluates and goes away... nothing else
,TheBatDad1989,2011-11-07T23:48Z,"hey people did anyone else get the problem where after initial scan in installation the download application files, install files and services bar all remained at 0%"
,omochao199,2011-11-15T03:42Z,Nice try AUDI but it seems u cant overcome this updating issue...
,wildman93,2011-11-17T22:08Z,"the program works great except for the fact that I can't update. Any one got a solution?
Thanks AUDI-A4"
,TheBatDad1989,2011-11-18T11:44Z,"I can't seem to get this to install...
everytime I try to install it says the download is corrupted and each re-download doesn't work :("
,letidfc,2011-12-18T18:16Z,"I've found a solution that works for me, everytime I want to update I change the update location from: http://upgrade.bitdefender.com to http://upgrade.bitdefender.com.edgesuite.net/ and vice-versa, it works. 

Someone should try and confirm this. "
,wattx,2011-12-19T20:52Z,"letidfc, I can confirm that changing the update site fixes the auto update issue. Thanks so much! "
,tpboss,2011-12-31T06:21Z,oh good...no viruses. but idk if it works. will advise when installed.
,tpboss,2011-12-31T07:49Z,"Omg yes im so excited. It installed correctly, took hella long to get to safe mode (had to use msconfig) and then used the crack, worked perfectly. License info says wont expire for like 12000 days or something lol. Ty uploader! no viruses either!"
,javarela,2012-01-02T01:00Z,"Thanks man, It totally worked! IF you guys are having trubole updating, change the update adress from the default to the one letidfc said, I can confirm it works! "
,elenabaju,2012-01-03T11:42Z,letidfc it really works
,strangerbarry,2012-01-03T18:37Z,Does that mean it won't automatically update - you have to manually see-saw back and forth between the two sites to get updates ?
,fc321,2012-01-13T18:14Z,"@letidfc:  You are a genius,  I can confirm that his trick works.  Go to settings > Update and change the update location from one to the other one and after that it lets you update the definitions.  

I am assuming that this will have to be done every 30 days?  Cant say for sure but all I know is it is working today"
,Simon5432,2012-01-17T21:07Z,@letidfc: THNX THIS WORKED FOR ME!!
,fc321,2012-01-18T19:05Z,"Well I havent been on the PC for about 3 days but now that I check it the update error is back.  SO I switched the update server address to the other one and then it updates.  

THis is a mild pain in the ass if I have to be doing it every day or every 3 days.  I like this program though so I have decided to purchase a legit copy in a week or 2 after I get some money.  

I guess bitdefender will be happy to learn that torrent is actually bringing in legitimate customers.  LoL.  "
,boardbum,2012-01-25T20:49Z,Has anyone figured out a way to fix the update problem? Yes letidfc's way works but you have to change the update address EVERY TIME you log off or exit bitdefender whether the firewall is on or not
,TheBatDad1989,2012-01-27T03:33Z,"Hey finally got it working!!!
however letidfc's update fix only gives me the same two updates for Bitdefender...
from one site I will get one update which requires a reboot then from the other I will get another slightly different in size which will also require a reboot. after this the EXACT same update is available again :(
not sure if this is just me..."
,boardbum,2012-01-27T04:16Z,"TheBatDad1989
Your right I just realized it's the same update every time you switch the address... wonder if there's anyway to fix this?"
,billbluey174,2012-02-08T23:52Z,"i changed the link for the update, restarted, changed the link back to default and UPDATES WORKED!!!!"
,kiukitsu,2012-03-11T02:19Z,"When I click the installer, and when the download starts, it says 'This application cannot be run on your machine'.


I already have uninstalled 2011 using the Bitdefender uninstaller.."
,Brainiac777,2012-04-03T05:55Z,"O.o This works and the patch has a keygen virus but nvm that. It fuckin crashed my computer and had to uninstall in safe mode but other than that, it seems great:D"
,terumo12,2012-04-07T18:23Z,Man i hope there will be a good crack that can fix those signiture updates that bitdefender is doing to discourage people from using pirated antiviruses hehe. I hope robinghood will come up with a good crack or any good people there.. AJA!

The crack will only work when you are in safe mode...

For those who are having problems with updating,i think this will help...the manual update...

Just follow the instructions in the site...and BDap will be updated...

,AppGenius,2012-05-11T18:06Z,"If you guys are having problems with this antivirus or if you are having problems with Norton, download Avast! Antivirus. It is on the top one hundred for applications and it doesn't give you any hassle at all, it is good. I'm going to download this one and give it a try, if it is good, then I'll switch. I'll also post another updated comment about the quality of this download and the program itself."

I installed correct, cracked in safe mode, it works, but when I restart the pc again, the blue screen until I uninstall it.  Well it's a my idea is stupid, use a cracked antivirus... and if the crack works, the antivirus isn't good :P  and you need to find another software."
