Amazon Review:
The novelty was stripmined from ethnobeat pop long ago, and this skin-deep confection is surprising only in its lack of edge and invention. On the plus side, the melodies are textured and lush, the beats entrancing, and a parade of gifted singers--Kristy Thirsk, Jacqui Hunt, and Sarah McLachlan included--bill and coo impressively. Lead single "Euphoria (Firefly)" has spark and spirit, while "Enchanted" and "Duende" are strong vehicles for Thirsk and Camille Henderson respectively. --Jeff Bateman

Amazon Description:
Recorded for the recent reissue of the best known Delerium album, Karma, this new mix of their 2000 hit single collaboration with Sarah McLachlan has already been no 1 in the German Dance Charts and once again looks set to take Ibiza by storm this summer. Promoted to UK clubs in late July and August, it will be given a 12" release in its own right in September. The older mixes of Silence sold 13K on download in 2007, and over 11K already in 2008. The track has been selling 500+ downloads per week consistently since April. Delerium albums for Nettwerk include Semantic Spaces (1995), their breakthrough album Karma (1997), Poem (2001), Chimera (2003) and Nuages Du Monde (2006). The band have sold over a million albums in North America alone, but are also known for a string of successful singles, including the worldwide dance smash Silence (featuring the vocal talents of Canadian superstar Sarah McLachlan), which has sold close to 400,000 copies in the UK alone. Other hits have included After All, Innocente (Falling In Love), Underwater and Heaven's Earth. --This text refers to an alternate Audio CD edition.
