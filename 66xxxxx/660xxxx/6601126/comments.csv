,spacelord76,2011-08-13T09:31Z,"ashudils: you know you can format your storage device to a system (ntfs) that can transfer bigger files than 4 GB? Simply click on the start menu, computer and right click on the storage device and choose ""format"". Make sure it's empty or you'll loose everything you have on it.  "
