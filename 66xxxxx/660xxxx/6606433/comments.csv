,anuzbitt,2011-09-18T14:36Z,"@elppir
did u guys start with a clean game =? i havent seen or had 1 ctd ... yet ... :D "
,b33tlejuice,2011-10-09T00:34Z,"Yeah same here with the CTD for the Hojo unit's at least, though I was able to get this installed and running without a clean install(just have to look through and see which files are more recent) and tried to go into a fight with the Hojo Hand Mortar unit, CTD, uninstalled, reinstalled, tried to go into a fight with the Hojo Hand Mortar unit again, CTD. So I'm guessing the unit's are bugged, and I can't open the .pack file with the pack file manager I have, so I can't check to see what's wrong with it..."
,b33tlejuice,2011-10-09T13:34Z,"Ok it's not the Jidai or Hattori DLC's that are causing the crash, The problem lies within the DLC4free.pack file. If you don't use it, you can use the unit's and not crash, though you can only recruit them by the clan that's meant to have them, if you want to be able to recruit all the unit's I'd suggest this http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=473255"
