This is my first upload of a movie I've ripped myself. It's 2 discs (ISO)
and I hope it will work for you. In my experience it's easiest to play with
VLC player.
Please leave a comment so I know if it works or if I have to improve my 
ripping skills. Thanks!
I've got a new Internet provider so upload speed should be sufficient.
