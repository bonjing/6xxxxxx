Release Notes :


Jamie Jones has become a household name and created an accessible brand for a
new generation of dance music fans with his Hot Natured guise and Hot Creations
label. His fabric compilation episode comes as he rides the crest of a tidal
wave of popularity for him and his Crosstown Rebels and Visionquest crew that
are forming a new cluster of stars. Original and addictive, his timeless journey
is typically charged with energetic loopy grooves, defining his personal
influences and showcasing exclusive material from his army of talent.

With a new album coming up on Crosstown Rebels (Jamie?s ?The Lows? gives a taste
on the fabric mix) as well as a Hot Natured album with Lee Foss and Ali Love to
come on his own Hot Creations label, it?s clear Jamie finds it hard to stay
still. Constantly evolving, he is surrounded by a growing team of exciting new
artists, for whom he has naturally become a role model. His visionary style and
concepts are effortlessly shaping the current era of electronic music and will
no doubt continue to for many years to come.

?It?s important to have something people can identify with. Someone said to me
recently the good thing about mine, and the whole Hot Natured style is it
appears to a wide age range, because the music is never too hard. It?s about
having fun with music and never serious. We?re about enjoying quality music,
having fun with your friends and living and breathing the party and the music
together." - Jamie Jones
