I don't know what the go is here the Torrent displays BDRip which by the net is a BluRay ripped, if this is so how come the start & the end of the movie are missing. I downloaded one that was uploaded by phreadyz & it is the same. Too much for my uneducated brain."
,Rod321,2011-08-18T00:33Z,"I watched the movie last night & the quality & sound are very good, but it begins with a female singing & there is no intro & the ending is missing - a shame for such a good quality upload.
A - 9.5/10
V - 9.5/10
Sync 10/10"
