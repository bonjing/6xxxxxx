,GrassyAss311,2011-08-15T07:18Z,"I love people in our society (sarcasm at its best). Every week i notice there is atleast 28,000 or more leechers but there is never more then 20 people seeding at one time. Right now i am downloading and there is only 16 people on seeding. Is it that hard to leave your torrent programming runnin while you go to bed? everytime i download a torrent i let it seed for atleast one night....."
,starryvoid,2011-08-15T08:13Z,"Wah wah wah. Of course there aren't very many seeders right now, this was only posted a few hours ago. Be patient ffs.

Seed you selfish bastards!!

Nice people like me always seed for you, dammit."
,XRoTtEnX,2011-08-15T10:32Z,"@Grassy

and you're one of the awesome people that I refer to in my previous comment :) I always seed for at least a week, and then naturally when I'm downloading other torrents I'm always seeding.

In my opinion, it's not very hard to leave a program running on my computer when I sleep...  
I'm down to 19 seeders now, and there's 33,000+ leechers..."
