Colombia is now the 3rd largest recipient of US foreign & military aid, the justification for which is the War on Drugs. In a clear, concise and sometimes bitterly funny lecture, NOAM CHOMSKY shows us who is getting the money, who is producing and exporting the drugs, and what the war on the ground is really about. In the ongoing debate over whether Columbia will become the 'next Vietnam,' CHOMSKY'S analysis will provide a great introduction to the Columbian elite, the role of the US media, how 'development' works. Imagine Traffic starring CHOMSKY instead of Michael Douglas.
