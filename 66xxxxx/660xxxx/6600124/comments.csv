,Insomneac,2011-08-12T23:43Z,"This smells fishy.

It's obviously a Theta release, yet there's no mention of it on scene release sites.

It uses the same serial number as other Angry Birds versions.

And why does it require a mini web server, iw.exe?

If you're blocking it via the hosts file, and activating it with a serial, what's the server for?"

,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-08-13T14:59Z,"it's working for me.

be sure to add an exception to your antivirus, due to the packer many av will be triggered falsely."

,nighthawk5500,2011-08-17T10:36Z,"I ended up downloading the copy from the douchebag on demonoid that ripped this off from you and am having a problem getting it to take the registration code. it keeps saying it is the wrong activation code or that i am not connected to the internet, do you have any suggestions as to what i am doing wrong?"
,JSHAZ,2011-08-17T15:11Z,I did everythin right but it says wrong code. I reinstalled the game and then when i entered code game crashed with dont send. well I guess ill just wait for other torrent cuz its amazing game.
,nighthawk5500,2011-08-17T18:34Z,Yes i did run it but it came up with an error when i run iws but it then shows up in the tool bar. once i type in www and hit enter it does nothing.
,nighthawk5500,2011-08-17T19:09Z,"what should be in the default file box, mine got erased and now it is blank as well."
,richrockr,2011-08-17T19:41Z,"everything goes well if followed the proper procedure as stated. encountered the same problem as that of 'punkesh' and 'nighthawk5500'
@punkesh: the simplified way to save the host file is to 'change user account control setting' (type this in the start option in the search box) and set it to the minimum. (may ask to restart, do it..!) then go to host file and save the same, it will be successful.
@nighthawk5500: there must have been certainly a problem while u had installed the iws.exe, check your firewall settings and allow it and uninstall it and reinstall that again.
Works fine..!!"
,addict-,2011-08-17T20:00Z,"i did exactly according the instructions but still it wont work, it won't accept the registration key, can u give me another key please. i really would like this angry birds seasons to work."
,nighthawk5500,2011-08-18T00:36Z,Did that and it was already allowed and still not working. i have un installed the game and re installed it 3 times and same results.

,FamilyMan82,2011-08-20T17:01Z,"Thanks for the dl!! I followed the install steps just as listed and everything works just fine.
