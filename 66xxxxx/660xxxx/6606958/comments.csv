,DTjaimillo,2011-08-17T23:23Z,Yes only 64bit SORRY
,StickFigure135,2011-08-31T16:00Z,everything worked but the patch... it keeps telling me the serial is invalid and to give them a new one. Did i do something wrong??
,ShiverMeTimberlands,2011-09-08T17:55Z,"ok -- I'm confused, I seem to have 'subscription version' and after serial number -- and can't do anything unless I go online and enter 'adobe ID' --"
,y_punjabi,2011-09-16T14:33Z,"it worked for me
but do i have to disconnect from the internet whenever i use it?"
,Silv3rblade,2011-09-27T06:46Z,Thank a lot!!!
,paradoxfudo47,2011-10-18T20:16Z,why did you not say that it works only on 64bit i spent 3 hours waiting and i deleted it in the end 
,you.and.me,2011-10-26T20:39Z,is perfect!!! easy and simple. always read the instructions =]
,RobtBlake,2011-10-29T19:11Z,"same as Shiver Me Timbers, I followed instructions, but it either says ""[can't run without internet access]"" if I disable, or demands I enter an Adobe ID.  I already had an Adobe ID, but when I enter it, it shuts down.  

Btw, I do have 64-bit machine. "
