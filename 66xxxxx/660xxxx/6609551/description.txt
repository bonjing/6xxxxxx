Why Planes Crash: 
: It's perhaps not the most comforting of thoughts, but flying isn't always the safest way to travel. Aircraft tumble from the skies for many reasons: extreme weather conditions, engine failure, lack of fuel, terrorist attack... And that's before we even get to structural failures, fire or human error. This series uses first-hand pilot testimony and computer-generated animations in order to examine some of the world's more dramatic aeroplane incidents, reliving the crucial moments when pilots lost control. Passengers recall life-or-death situations, while the animation aims to recreate an accurate picture of stricken planes' final moments before crashing or destruction. 
Human Error: Mistakes, oversights and distractions can have consequences. This show features the jet which ran out of fuel and smashed into a hillside just miles from a runway.
