Supermarket Sweep is an American television game show. Part of the format was similar to other team-based quiz shows; the other part was a live-action race through a supermarket, a novel concept at the time. In the timed race, cameras followed the teams with shopping carts through a large vacated supermarket with several aisles; the value of items thrown into the cart determined the winning team. The original show was broadcast on ABC (December 1965â€“July 1967), with revivals airing on Lifetime (February 1990â€“May 1995, reran until August 1998) and later PAX (April 2000â€“May 2003, reran until March 2004).

ABC\'s Supermarket Sweep was broadcast from Food Fair supermarkets, mostly around New York City. For the Lifetime version, a mock supermarket was created at Hollywood Center Studios.[1] It was modeled after a Hughes Market until September 1993, when it was remodeled again after a Unified Western Market. The PAX version was staged in the same set and studio as the Lifetime version. Beginning in September 2001, the show moved to NBC Studios.

The host for the 1965â€“1967 ABC version was Bill Malone. The announcers were Wally King from 1965â€“1966, and Richard Hayes from 1966â€“1967, with Johnny Olson and Gene Wood as frequent substitutes during those years. The host for the 1990â€“1995 Lifetime version and the 2000â€“2003 PAX version was David Ruprecht. The announcers were Johnny Gilbert from 1990â€“1995 and again from Aprilâ€“September 2000, then Randy West for the rest of the show\'s run.


PS Used to love catching this show, it was aired randomly at different times and days where i lived while i was younger. Loved the concept, great old school game show. Pack includes the pilot episode as well, various qualities as well, some(if not all them) look like old VHS rips and they are webripz so don\'t expect some sort of DVD rip with these.
