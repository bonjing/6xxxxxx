Also does anyone have the movie The First Grader. It's a true story."
,Chadly,2011-08-16T23:03Z, It seeds automaticly as long as its in Utorrent or whatever torrent program ur using to download. Stops when you delete it from the torrent program.

,blackestbeard,2011-12-05T16:37Z,"you think this and the first movie is sad....i got a lil gammed up in the throat watching marley and me......but the movie ''RED DOG''  had me crying like a little girl haha(well felt like it any way *i never cry lol) that is one sad as fuck movie.poor doggy '8(
although its sad id definately reccomend a watch to those who enjoy animal films as its based on a true story.....hope this ones not as bad...."
,enloynz,2012-02-23T13:06Z,"that said cheers bone,dont have to worry about quality rating you're always spot on
and as far as sad dog true films go watch hatchi (hatchiko) a dogs tale,very heart warming"
