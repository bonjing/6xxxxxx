Battle of the Bulge 1944 (2): Bastogne (Campaign) by Steven Zaloga


The Ardennes offensive in December 1944, known to history as the â€œBattle of the Bulgeâ€, was the decisive campaign of the war in North-West Europe. When the attack in the north by 6th Panzer Army failed, Hitler switched the focus of the offensive to General Manteuffelâ€™s 5th Panzer Army farther south. Overwhelming the green US 106th Division, German Panzers flooded towards the River Meuse. Barring their way was the crossroads town of Bastogne, reinforced at the last minute by the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne, the â€˜Screaming Eaglesâ€. The stage was set for one of the epic struggles of the war â€“ the battle for Bastogne.
