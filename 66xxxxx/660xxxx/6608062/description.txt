[Notes]

Revocation returns with a new album of masterful modern metal in Chaos of
Forms. Unforgettable songs bend, stop, twist, and shred at virtuosic levels
while exploding with frenetic energy. As future classics Cradle Robber,
Dissolution Ritual, No Funeral, Cretin and more show, each aspect of the
band has been honed to deadly perfection and brings to fruition the promise
that the previous full-length Existence Is Futile hinted at. Chaos of Forms
proves beyond doubt that Revocation are masters of their craft and metal s
finest new band.
