And the ""dumbass of the year award"" goes to annonymous.
That and a cup of coffee will get him a cup of coffee more than being an idiot with far too much time on his hands."
,Alfalpha,2011-08-15T00:48Z,"@coldethyl

Give him a fucking break. At least he has uploaded it. I have both the hindi video and this audio and the uploader is right, it is a massive pain in the arse trying to get them to sync up. I gave up after 10 minutes. I thought it is easier to wait for an English copy.
But this is far from a pointless torrent.

,wretchedinc,2011-08-15T03:17Z,Thanks< I'll try. I have some sound editing software thAT i can try it with.
,Zomb13Fan,2011-08-15T03:28Z,"@coldethyl - Of course this torrent is useful you dumbass.

Just because you are too stupid to understand how to use it with the other availsble sources, doesn't mean that we all are.

Thanks to 'anonymous' (btw: there's only two ""n"" in ""anonymous"" dipshit) there will be an english sync'd version of the Hindi release within a few hours.


Whoever you are who uploaded this audio... thank you."
,coldethyl,2011-08-15T03:49Z,Let me see if I got this right. Somebody with zero history hero and zero uploads and zero name so you have no idea who he is and admits to having zero patience to make his own torrent work when loading it makes you jump to his defense when a moron like me says it's ridiculous? That's fabulous. Thanks for sharing!
,Skuzkid,2011-08-15T05:21Z,at least he did more to help us than you. 
,JarateLover06,2011-08-15T07:27Z,"@coldethyl 
  You're a moron. Enough said really.  It would have been useful if it wasn't terrible quality. Thanks uploader but I'll wait for a better version as I can't make out most of this audio."
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-08-15T07:35Z,I have an english FD5 neally ready to go but if you gonna try syncing this get goldwave and virtualdub thats all you need 
,fraph,2011-08-15T08:05Z,SAFCukO09: i eagerly await your english version!
,Justsayin,2011-08-15T13:31Z,"@coldethyl-says the leecher, not the downloader...I cant muster up the balls to complain on this site...seriously, how can you?



Thank you for the effort, Anonymous"
,coldethyl,2011-08-15T16:39Z,"Here's the most humorous part of this whole bickering. I complain that the loader admits his zero patience with also having zero history here and question why and I'm attacked! FABULOUS! ON A SIDE NOTE...since the only reason we are all here is because were all cheap pricks not willing to spend $11 on a ticket, perhaps we can also  have a version that DOESN'T requires 2 downloads and software for a film that probabbly isn't ""Gone With The Wind""? Jesus people....get a second job if you can't wait a few seconds and MUST see it."
,Zomb13Fan,2011-08-16T03:42Z,"Dude, you must be back-water retarded..

Your douche-baggery is surpassed only by your stupidity."
,wasp09,2011-09-01T13:31Z,Can't find a proper torrent to download FD5...can anyone help me please!
,wzrsa,2011-11-30T12:12Z,"@coldethyl i think you can only really question the title of the torrent and the uploaders comment. After that who cares? if someone else can use it great, otherwise stfu it's free. your starting to remind me of people who guard their oversized trash when its on the curb. >."
