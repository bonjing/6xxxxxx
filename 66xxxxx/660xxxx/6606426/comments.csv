,xfiendmate,2011-08-15T14:57Z,thank you
,2toast,2011-08-15T15:22Z,Is this legit? A/V?
,fish121,2011-08-15T18:38Z,"Thanks!

only watched first couple of minutes,
but based on that:
A/V  10/10"
,fillinthisspace,2011-08-15T20:17Z,"A/V 10/10

Less 4 points for forcing me to remux the MKV to remove ""Breaking Bad S04E05 by TeddyBlue"" from the title.

Bonus 2 points for not advertising a URL in the torrent name.

Total 18 out of 20. :-)

Thanks."

A:10
V:9

Great for less than 1.5 Gb
And McPain's link for english subtitles work perfect (big thanks for that too)"
,tr0gd0r88,2011-08-22T19:05Z,is the 6th episode coming soon?
,mike1718,2011-10-01T10:24Z,"Corrupt . works about 10 minutes.
The sad thing is that the quality (A/V) is outstanding. I have tried to remux using MKVTOOLNIX but it did not work."
