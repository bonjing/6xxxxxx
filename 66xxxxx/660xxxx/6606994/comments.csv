,GIJerryO,2011-08-20T03:38Z,Hey Bone what the heck man. All that laughing in the background? Can't you get a handle on that. Tell the manager your a VIP from TPB and your trying to create a cam and you'd appreciate it if he could control the audience. Geesh some audiences have no respect at all. You the man Bone!!!
,waterchica999,2011-08-22T00:54Z,cute movie nice cam laughing is ignorable thanks .Bone.

,jduhh,2011-08-23T00:10Z,"very pixelated and unwatchable. if not for that, sound and quality is good."
,jmcpdx,2011-08-23T02:16Z,"Both the video and audio quality were pretty good for a cam... mine wasn't pixelated as someone else stated.  No complaints here.

One of my favorite parts of this recording comes in the last three or so seconds.  Anyone else see it... or I should say: hear it?  The one asshole in the audience who tried to start clapping... in a movie theater.  They must have gotten those two claps in, then realized the cast, crew, etc. couldn't hear them, and decided to stop.  Or perhaps they didn't want to be the only one clapping.  Either way, priceless.  

Thanks for not editing that part out."

,MikeXRyan,2011-08-27T01:24Z,"As a seasoned PB uploader let me just say: STOP asking for specific videos!  1st, requests for files can result in the loss of your access but more importantly, trying to meet requests makes it very hard to please everyone.  GO to the Video Store and rent the movie, convert it to AVI or any other format and put it up yourself!  That's the whole point of public P2P.  If I were to check the library of most posters I'd find few have ever uploaded a video - they just take take request take, oh... and can you upload???

It is really galling and very annoying."
,Chadly,2011-08-27T18:13Z,"lol ur funny mikexryan. Why care about such a stupid thing as people asking exp uploaders to upload a movie they might not know about? The people asking arent holding a gun to the uploaders head, you know? its completely up to the uploader. He/she can answer or ignore. Know ones forcing anyone to do shit, so why care if people use their own time to ask? might get something out of it, might not. again up to the uploader, not the imaginary gun hidden in the question over the internet lmao ask away people its not hurting anyone :) thanks again Bone you da man as always :)"

,doomsday2012lol,2011-09-05T22:39Z,Leave it to Hollywood to make Roots 2011 and call it The Help.  Only thing missing in this movie was the slave ship.
,invioletlight,2011-09-08T21:05Z,Thanks Bone - another great upload! I am reading the book so I wanted to see the movie...
,invioletlight,2011-09-08T21:06Z,Oh and it's MP4 - so perfect for watching on iPad.
,2773EZduzit,2011-09-10T00:13Z,"To doomsday2012lol for this comment ""Leave it to Hollywood to make Roots 2011 and call it The Help. Only thing missing in this movie was the slave ship.""  

Have you ever watched Roots?? Because there is absolutely NO comparison...  Really what a shit comment... There are so many war movies, films about the Holocaust, Zombies, end of the world, boy fucks BFF and ends up with her in the end, etc... This was a pretty decent film.  It was nice to see this shit racism from a different view - yes THE HELP. NO WHERE NEAR FUCKING ROOTS..  I sure hope you're not black.. Cuz you're making us all look bad.. What a douche...

Here's what you Pirates want to know - ignore the stupid ass people and their dumb comments: 

V:.7 (its a cam so at times its a little dark & out focus but totally watchable)

A: 7.5 same as above - but not complaining... 

M: 9 Nice to see a different perspective, not that of a slave stolen from Africa but of the working class and how they were treated.. Plus w/ some witty comedy - that was a nice relief

Download time: Fast (less than 30 mins) with no spam... 

Overall if you're not a douche bag and are educated you might just enjoy this film..

Nice job Bone.... And THANK YOU.. AS ALWAYS YOU ROCK!!!"
,issokay,2011-09-11T07:44Z,"Audio is not synchronized with lip movement, etc."
,bossy617,2011-09-12T02:17Z,how do u open rar
,theeGRated,2011-09-13T00:27Z,"@bossy you need a program called WinRar, you can get a cracked version on here, or the trial works fine, you MIGHT be able to change the file extension to .zip and it may open. 

and on another note, why the fuck is this racist ass movie up but 30 minutes or less STILL isnt up god dammit!!!!!!!!! someone pleeeease upload it when its available "
,tee_bee,2011-09-13T23:02Z,"hey jmcpdx - a lot of times, clapping at the theatre is to let the OTHER folks there know your opinion, that you thought it was good.  It can feel good to share with others who just went through the same viewing experience as you.  Just sayin."
,Ville530,2011-09-16T23:35Z,"Great torrent!! Could you please get ""Laugh at my Pain""?"
,domesticx,2011-09-18T17:13Z,I agree we need 30 minutes or less uploaded!!!
,daleel,2011-09-25T00:53Z,Thank you very much for the upload and many thanks to commentors!
,end77,2011-09-27T02:22Z,"had a look a IMDb ... mmm, I can't watch an ALL WOMEN cast movie!!"
,Sori6989,2011-09-28T04:58Z,lol @ 2773EZduzit your comment is much appreciated as a posed to the root hater.
,lagweeda,2011-09-28T19:54Z,bone u do a good job
,lagweeda,2011-10-09T12:08Z,Like always u come out on top keep it up. Good work. Good on the A and good on the V
,lagweeda,2011-10-09T12:11Z,OMG three for the road was a good movie. I think i might have that on VHS. An if i still do how do i get it on here 4 u?
,wayneking,2011-10-13T01:24Z,"The quality's fine for a cam and the film is pretty damned good.  It's a very refreshing take on a period of US history we humans should all be ashamed of.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm neither black, nor a woman.  If you're interested in real human conditions and issues, such as prejudice, pain, inner strength, courage, social progress etc, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  The acting happens to be good to boot."
,wistfool,2011-10-22T20:49Z,"Thanks so much, Bone. You're awesome. :-)

A-8, V-9.5 for a camrip (but I did watch it on my 15'6"" laptop screen so I dunno how the video'll become when viewed on a larger screen)."
,karamia,2011-10-24T23:12Z,going to download purely for the laughing 
,karamia,2011-10-25T00:52Z, am i the only one that seeds.... feels like it! SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
,shellback1191,2011-10-28T03:38Z,"it might be a little late but here goes,did not find very much funny about this film because it is shameful that our country did this and still does this to its citizens.film is powerful and light hearted at the same time.very well acted,directed,and very watchable for a cam.as always thanks to bone for up.do your part,seed,spread the love."
,DaisukeO,2012-03-04T03:03Z,Overall the quality wasn't that good. If you're going to post something as Blu-Ray then rip it from a disc....not a video camera in a theater.
