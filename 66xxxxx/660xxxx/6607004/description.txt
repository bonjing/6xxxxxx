The Deer Hunter is a 1978 drama film co written and directed by Michael Cimino about a trio
of Russian American steel worker friends and their infantry service in the Vietnam War. The
film stars Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Savage, John Cazale, and
George Dzundza. The story takes place in Clairton, a small working class town on the
Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh and then in Vietnam, somewhere in the woodland and
in Saigon, during the Vietnam War.

The film was based in part on a screenplay called The Man Who Came To Play by Louis
Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker about Las Vegas and Russian Roulette. Producer Michael
Deeley, who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with Deric
Washburn, rewrote the script, taking the Russian Roulette element and placing it in the
Vietnam War. The film went over budget and over schedule and ended up costing $15
million.

The scenes of Russian roulette, while highly controversial on release, have been viewed as a
metaphor for the Vietnam War itself. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best
Picture and Best Director and was named by the American Film Institute as the 53rd Greatest
Movie of All Time on the 10th Anniversary Edition of the AFI's 100 Yearsâ€¦100 Movies list.
