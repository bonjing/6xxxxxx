(official page of the game)"
,h2888b,2011-08-15T16:05Z,"BTW the game is quite short, I finished in just 7 hours...IDK if they r gonna develop another campaign or what...but they should cause the game is quite impressive but quite short as well...

Why not having the nazi-germans invading Asia, China and so?"
,g2012,2011-09-11T22:31Z,Can Anyone help me how to install this game. ?
,g2012,2011-09-11T23:16Z,"I see the instructions now, THANKS!"
,wattette,2011-09-16T02:17Z,"Nothing about this torrent works, move along."
,crazyfooljdm,2011-09-17T07:21Z,this shit says crc failed reinstall or something when i try to mount it and run it... it looks like its gonna work fine but i think i need a serial number
,molderfox,2011-09-19T20:43Z,Works just fine  ! thanks
,iycgtptyarvg,2011-09-22T01:57Z,"Just played the tutorial missions. This game is indeed how I remembered Panzer General.

Thanks for this."
,Buxaroo,2011-09-23T22:41Z,"Any idea if the new patch that's out works or breaks this?

http://www.slitherine.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=27968

I will try it and see and if it works without breaking the game, I will post back to confirm if it does or doesn't."
,Buxaroo,2011-09-23T22:59Z,"Nah, wants a valid serial number when I try to install it :-/. Guess we will have to wait for a proper crack. This update looks good too, can run it in windowed mode as well, something I really want in this game :)"
,rock100,2011-10-23T16:02Z,serial for 1.02 version??
,ghostwalker747,2011-10-26T16:27Z,"what a load of crap, tried to copy and paste crack ms-dos just refuses (don't ask why?) i spent ages looking for a crack came across, a couple done by SKIDROW but the stupid fuckers put a password on them what a waste of fucking time"
,nepenthe6,2011-11-04T04:34Z,"@Buxaroo, rock100 â€” I've been looking everywhere for serial or some way to install the newest patch (v1.04 now), I couldn't find anything, but I've found a v1.02 patch. Don't remember where I downloaded it from, but search for ""Panzer Corps Walthers"", and download it from somewhere. You'll find multiple torrents on google... load trackers from all of them if you don't see any seeders. Oh, and if you get the CRC error after extraction, check your PanzerCorps.TXT file and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Slitherine\PanzerCorps\ ""PanzerCorps"" key via regedit; they have to contain the same serial (just find the above key with Run+R -> regedit, and change the ""PanzerCorps"" serial key to 1111-1111-1111-1111).
HTH.

PS: Walthers, if you're reading this, please upload the 1.04 patch. :)"
,nepenthe6,2011-11-04T04:52Z,"Regarding my comment above, you can download any .torrent file you find on google for 'Panzer Corps Walthers', and then add following trackers to it (in uTorrent, right click, go to properties, and then paste them):

udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80
http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce
http://exodus.1337x.org/announce
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce

That's for the 1.02 patch.
Now if someone would upload the 1.04 and the new DLCs... :)"
,molderfox,2011-11-10T17:46Z,Run + r  via regedit   what that means?  
,nepenthe6,2011-11-15T09:20Z,"@molderfox - sorry, I meant Win+R, meaning, hold windows key & press R, or just go to Start menu -> ""Run"", and then type in ""regedit"". Then you follow the rest of the instructions. 

But — do that only if you get the error I mentioned (happens when the key in the game dir and the key in the registry are different).

Btw, I managed to crack the installer for the new patch (1.04), might upload the extracted files later.

It would be great if someone could also upload the DLCs."
,jb0909,2011-11-15T19:48Z,"@nepenthe6
It would be awesome if you could upload the 1.04 version. It is a massive fix pack compared to the 1.02. cheers"
,molderfox,2011-11-16T21:53Z,nepenthe6---  thanks! works just fine!
,molderfox,2011-11-16T21:55Z,...and also waiting for your crack 1.04 :) 
,jb0909,2011-11-28T11:32Z,"actually the latest cracked path is available now; just google it:
Panzer Corps 1.04 cracked patch and the Grand Campaign '39+Grand Campaign '40 DLC's
somebody should torrent that one, too :)"
,molderfox,2011-11-30T01:27Z,cant find working link :( 
,AK-89,2011-12-25T01:11Z,Hey new to this thing WTF is burn/mount??? WHat do I need to do?
,Spitvall,2012-01-18T15:57Z,"Thanks to the uploader ! It seems to be a great strategy game.

I have an issue : the game freezes and crashes as soon as I move a unit, with Windows 7. Am I the only one ?

@ AK-89 : no need neither to burn, neither to mount with this one :

And fuck you too."
,hokella,2012-02-05T14:25Z,i have windows 7 64 bit it crashes too
,synchro_w,2012-03-10T20:13Z,"this game works fine but the version is 1.0 and so it only lets u play so far before crashing, that's why there're updates. without the cracked updates this dl is a bit useless sadly cos it's a good game. if only someone  could come up with a cracked 1.05 [has anyone read the huge pages of instructions for installing the friggin 1.04 cracked upadte? i'm not even gonna bother with all that]. i have found a few links to cracked 1.05 but they are all bogus. even dl'd one but it was just the normal update that wanted a serial key."
