,cassandra_cain,2011-08-15T09:13Z,Is the quality on this as shit as the last few have been?
,euphoria4949,2011-08-15T09:41Z,"@twopoint

For fricking hells sake boy, why do you and your other moaning little muppets have to whine about RARs, whats wrong with them??
It only takes 5 to 10 seconds to extract them on an Average PC, so if your machine takes forever  then that's your problem because your PC is shite! Or here is an idea, don't like it, don't fricking download it!

Stop whining you ungrateful troll and say thank you to the uploader and be thankful your getting it for free! ""Dick head!""

Thanks sceneline top quality as always :)"
,euphoria4949,2011-08-15T09:45Z,"Video =  9.5/10

,Dmdlman,2011-08-15T10:04Z,"Err sorry, are you people paying for this? If you think you can do better then what are you waiting for?

Thanks uploader, keep'em coming!!!"
,UAofE,2011-08-15T10:17Z,"euphoria4949, if you weren't so retarded you would see that RAR files kill seeding, making this and every other RAR upload fucking worthless after the first few days.

sceneline uploads ship. Wait for the Web-DL version, it doesn't have RARS and the quality is far better."
,Billythebat,2011-08-15T10:22Z,"Yo Bitchsz   RAR's Are the Bomb! Check it out Jesse style. Yo, and stop Whining about rars bitches."

,xp87,2011-08-16T03:51Z,"Fuck RARs.

==== Reasons not to use RARS: ====
- RARs waste twice the space on your computer, meaning those low on space have to choose between seeding or deleting the fucking RAR and keeping the video.
- Makes it so you can't see the filenames are in the torrent.
- Makes it so you can't CHOOSE which files in the torrent you need.
- No operating system supports RARs natively, because it's proprietary. Telling us all to get some shitty software so you can waste all our time by uploading a RAR is retarded.
- RAR can't compress already compressed video.
- Nobody gives a shit about verifying the RARs with the release group. You've already downloaded the fucking movie, just watch it to see if it's the real thing. Who gives a shit?
- ""It only takes a minute to extract"" Fuck that, it should take 0 minutes because it shouldn't be there in the first place.
- I don't give a shit if you are a big deal in ""the SCENE"". It doesn't impress me. If you were that much of an insider you wouldn't need to ""prove it"" by uploading RARs and explaining how important they are. Extract the fucking RARs. Nobody wants them.

==== Reasons to use RARS: ====
- To act like you're a cool ""SCENE"" insider."
,Esmad3,2011-08-16T21:12Z,"@ euphoria4949: There is one very good reason. With rars your downloads takes up twice the amount of space on your hd, if you wish to seed. ""1GB isn't much on an average hd""... well it adds up.  I only seed rar'ed files for longer times on private trackers, and frankly don't feel bad about it. "
,Esmad3,2011-08-16T21:26Z,"Not watching this version btw. These 1 gb files are just not worth it. I decided to get the HD version allready, so I'm not gonna' halfass it and go for these crappy versions. "
,ultima7,2011-08-17T12:35Z,What an amateur... using rar... sigh
,jauas,2011-08-19T03:52Z,lol I love all the people rage posting about rars... who the hell doesn't have a big enough hard drive nowadays.. a TB hd is dirt as cheap now.
,jauas,2011-08-19T03:52Z,ass*
,{me},2011-08-19T09:07Z,"^So its OK for one file to take up twice the space? That makes it very hard for me to be concerned for the swarm. 
listen to xp87, you only save, what, say one and a half percent (if you are lucky), which would be ~10-20MBs so if HD space doesn't matter then whats the point of concealing the contents in a proprietary (you [are supposed to] pay for) format?

@ultima - I wish it WERE amateur, but unfortunately its some of the longest standing members of this community that, for whatever reason, continue to upload RARs.

The bottom line:
""Stop WHINING you ungrateful troll[s] and say thank you to the uploader and be thankful your getting it for free!"" - Well said. Regardless of which format was used the uploader DID take their own time to upload what IS in fact what it says it is and very, very sadly only five of the seventeen people who left comments before me took the time to say thank you.

Thanks sceneline
Happy Pirating"

,Carillon3,2011-08-25T11:19Z,using RAR for video -_-....
,rawree,2011-08-27T05:05Z,"I have to agree - RARs suck. Half the time I've downloaded them they ended up being something other than what I thought I was downloading. Also: sometimes there's a password that no one bothered to post. It's gotten to the point where most RAR downloads are fakes, so, no I won't generally download them, and I certainly won't seed them.

No Point for them at all, they should be banned
