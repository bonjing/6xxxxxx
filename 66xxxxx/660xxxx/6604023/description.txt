INGREDIENTS:

1 pound lean ground beef
2 chopped onions 1/2 tsp. oregano
1/2 tsp. chili powder 1/2 tsp. sweet basil
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp. garlic salt
1/2 tsp. cumin powder
1 small can tomato sauce
1 Cup water

PREPARATION:

Place all ingredients in Crock Pot. Cook all day on LOW or 1/2 day on HIGH. Stir before serving over cooked burgers, hot dogs or french fries for Greek Dogs, Greek Burgers or Greek Fries! I've also done this with frozen burger... top it with all the ingredients and make sure you stir it once while cooking!
