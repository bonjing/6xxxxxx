eg-if you have installed ''the return of the lost general'' mod for zero hour and you want to install shockwave. re-install zero hour and then install shockwave.Two mods can not be played at the same time."

,GoodWater,2011-10-03T09:07Z,"How's it goin? So I did all your instructions, very easy, but when it came down to copy and paste the Generals and Game, I was never asked to replace anything. I ignored it and tried playing ZH and it asked for the CD to play. I already have the original Generals installed by the way. Any help please? And no computer lingo please, I don't understand it too well unfortunately  "
