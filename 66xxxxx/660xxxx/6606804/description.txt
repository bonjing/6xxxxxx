The last two decades have witnessed an explosion of research on sexuality as the social sciences have worked to find new ways of understanding a rapidly changing world. Growing concern for issues such as population, women's and men's reproductive health, and the HIV and AIDS pandemic, has since provided new legitimacy for work on sexuality, health and rights.

A detailed and up-to-date reference work, the Routledge Handbook of Sexuality, Health and Rights provides an authoritative overview of the main issues in the field today. Leading academics and practitioners are brought together to reflect on past, present and future approaches to understanding and promoting sexual health and rights. Divided into nine parts, it covers:

pioneering beginnings
language, discourse and sexual categories
from sexuality to health
the reproductive imperative
how to have sex in an epidemic
the choreography of sex
the darker side of sex
from sexual health to sexual rights
struggles for erotic justice.
This Handbook surveys the state of the discipline and offers an examination and discussion of emerging, controversial and cutting edge areas. It is an essential reference for academics and researchers in the fields of sexuality studies, sexual health and human rights, and offers key reading for more advanced students.
