With Windows XP Professional Edition with Service Pack 3, you get safer browsing
and communication, powerful security tools, and improved experiences.
Windows XP is the operating system release that unifies the Microsoft range
with all the desktop versions now built on the NT/2000 code base rather than the
shakier foundation of Windows 95, 98, and Me. That makes XP a great upgrade for
users of the now-obsolete 9x and Me line, but for those already on Windows 2000
Professional it is a closer call.
