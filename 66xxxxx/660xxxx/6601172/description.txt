This Is England[2006]+This Is England 86+extras-[xvids]The_Stig@T.F.RG

Roland Rat, Margaret Thatcher; Rubik's Cubes, the Royal Wedding; aerobics, skinheads... It's 1983, and the schools are breaking up for summer.

Shaun is 12 and a bit of a loner, growing up with his mum in a grim coastal town, his dad was killed fighting in the Falklands War. On his way home from school, where he's been tormented all day for wearing flares, he runs into a group of skinheads, who against expectations turn out to be friendly and take him under their wing. Soon Shaun discovers parties, girls and snappy dressing, and finds some role models in Woody, Milky and the rest of the gang. But when an older, overtly racist skinhead returns home from prison, the easy camaraderie of the group is broken, and Shaun is drawn into much more uncomfortable territory...


this is england 86

Set three years after the events of "This is England", Shane Meadows's first foray into TV is a striking four-part sequel. With a full-blown recession and the 1986 World Cup in the works, this hilarious and heartbreaking drama series from Channel 4 draws many parallels with the England of 2010.

This Is England '86 will pick up with the lives of Shaun, Woody and Lol in 1986 - the year Chris de Burgh is at number one, Top Gun is filling cinemas, the World Cup is raging in Mexico and over 3.4 million Brits are unemployed.

As Shaun sits his last school exam, the realisation dawns that adulthood beckons. It's mid-80s England and he's going to have to find his own way in the world. Life has dealt a surprise hand to his friends too and no one is quite where they thought they would be... Woody, Lol, Smell, Gadget... they are back and looking for love, a laugh, a job and something that resembles a future.
