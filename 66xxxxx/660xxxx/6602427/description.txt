In a sweeping state-of-the-world address, America's leading foreign policy critic surveys the role of the U.S. in a post-9-11 world-and finds nothing has changed. Ranging over American intervention in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America since WWII, Chomsky deftly sketches the logic behind our foreign policy, and its tragic results around the globe and at home. Whether it's globalization, oil, or a monopoly on real terror, it's business as usual, and we-not to mention the rest of the world-have to pay. Now more than ever, the venerable professor stands as the voice of reason in an apparently insane world.

Noam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War.
