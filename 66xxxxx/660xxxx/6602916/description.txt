Downloaded Bob Marley - The Dennis Thompson Mixes (1977) in .FLAC from www.sharingthegroove.org or www.thetradersden.org years ago. Today wanted the songs in MP3 for portable use. Therefore ripped, using Rubyripper on Ubuntu 11.04, the Audio CD made with the .FLAC files. Since still only the .FLAC version of the Thompson mixes are online decided to upload this MP3 (320kbps) version.
