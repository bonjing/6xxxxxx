Keep patience. Malestorm always comes out back to back and the torrent gets repeated. Also, I don't have the latest till now."
,wallruss,2011-08-15T09:03Z,"Many thanks, this will fill my reading hours for a long time, so much to browse through.
But dare I ask, could you upload the Cambridge New Medieval History series also? Seven more volumes neatly extending this series. It would be much appreciated by me (and probably by all the other downloaders too)."
[V],_F1_,2011-08-15T09:30Z,"I'm planning for the following 2 series as of now:

1. The Cambridge Urban History of Britain (3 vols)
2. The New Cambridge Modern History (13 vols)

Will keep your request in mind. Thanx for the support."
,wallruss,2011-08-15T11:30Z,"Much appreciated! Looking forward to these series. 
I am really amazed at what you manage to do. Thanks."

,1KalozAr,2011-08-15T14:04Z,Waiting for the Modern History;many thanks in advance...
,wallruss,2011-08-15T17:29Z,"To 1KalozAr,
thanks for the offer.
Uploading is really simple:
first create a torrent of the file you want to upload. You use your download program for that (utorrent) Choose ""create torrent""in the menu, then ""save as"". Go to pirate bay, choose ""upload"" and fill in the required spaces (the file is your new torrent file). It is all very straightforward, simply try it. Thank you for trying to help, let's see if it will work!"
