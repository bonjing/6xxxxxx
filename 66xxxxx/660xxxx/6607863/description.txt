    No, its not field shifted, it's a 3D dvd and maybe this xvid should      
    have been labeled 3D as well. srestore and tdeint did the output.        
                                                                             
    Directed by Lijun Sun                                                    
                                                                             
    One day, a dying Sifu flees from the Imperial City to a small            
    village. He's being hunted and is on his last dying breathe. He is       
    found by a humble farmhouse cook named Tu who, at the request of the     
    dying Sifu, must return a very important Kung Fu Academy Tablet to       
    the Sifu's daughter Moli in the imperial city. Tu made a simple          
    promise that turns out to change his life forever.                       
                                                                             
    Never having been to the city, Tu already got off to a dangerous         
    start. He finds the Kung Fu Academy but finds that it has already        
    been taken over by a ruthless panda named Slash. The old master          
    (Sifu) and his daughter has gone missing. But to keep to his promise,    
    Tu has no choice but to stay in the Academy to wait for their return.    
    He's bullied from day one for knowing no Kung Fu. But serving as a       
    cook there, he picks up some Kung Fu as the days go by.                  
                                                                             
    At the imperial city he meets a mysterious girl (Moli) who identifies    
    herself as Moyan to keep her own safety. Rabbit never knew that this     
    girl is the one he's supposed to pass the tablet to. After many          
    misunderstandings, they finally are able to connect - but not before     
    the big bad villain Slash decides to kill Moli and Tu for intervening    
    with his evil plan to take over the entire China.
