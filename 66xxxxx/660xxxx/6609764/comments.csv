,Payrus123,2011-08-17T03:58Z,Valve is monitoring this torrent
,Payrus123,2011-08-17T04:11Z,thanks
,matthew_rs7,2011-08-17T04:29Z,"@Payrus123

What do you mean Valve is monitoring it? Are they going to send an ISP letter? Doesn't that usually take a few days. and even if they are, ISP letters are meaningless.

Or are you referring to something else?"

,vincentskilbeck,2011-08-18T05:15Z,does this work on windows 7 sp1
,vincentskilbeck,2011-08-18T05:21Z,i got the game to work on windows 7 just install xnafx31_redist.msi
,Hajeil,2011-08-18T05:33Z,"@AsILayDaing   I'm not sure why the Bastion.exe sets off your anti-ware. I have scanned it with Ad-aware, Malwarebytes and AVG 2011 and nothing has shown up. I've installed it and it runs perfectly. However NFOviewer.exe and the update immediately set off Ad-aware.

@All  But lets be realistic here:

1)What do any of you need a simple supposed info file for. You came here for an executable program not info files.

2) This game was just released on 08/06/2011 and this torrent was uploaded on the same date. When have you ever heard of a game being released with an update at the same time? Never. Perhaps one will be release in the same week if they get serious feedback from the community regarding some serious bugs but that's it. Some common sense would tell you all this. 

Bottom line:

Educate yourselves a bit before you try to download any software and make sure that all of the files your trying to download and use are actually part of the original software package. Cracked executes not included of course. And always scan the file with multiple anti-ware programs. Finally, when in doubt and unsure, just don't use it."
,Hajeil,2011-08-18T05:37Z,Edit: Release date for Bastion on PC through Steam was 08/16/2011. Sorry for the typo.
,Aethios,2011-08-18T06:30Z,"Anyone saying it's only the NFOreader that's infected is full of shit. Bastion.exe (which is suspiciously the ONLY game-related file in the torrent, besides the patch) is all kinds of infected. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT. IT IS A VIRUS. You've been warned."

,mistermiracle,2011-08-18T13:05Z,"All you assholes need to shut up!

The game works perfectly!

First of all, make sure you have these installed:

http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=15163

Second of all, THERE ARE NO FUCKING VIRUSES IN THIS TORRENT, YOU DUMB FUCKS!

They are false positives, including ""Trojan.Win32.Chifrax.a"". Just check Google! It's a FUCKING FALSE POSITIVE! If Kaspersky deletes it, just add to your exclusions list in your Kaspersky settings!

This is why I rarely use TPB, because this place is full of UTTERLY FUCKING RETARDED EPIC IDIOT NOOBS! Jesus H. Christ!"
,DrHallow,2011-08-18T13:19Z,"The warnings on this torrent are NOT false positive. Both executables are infected with Chifrax.a which later injects your system with Jorik.IRCbot.XXX [Kaspersky Scanned]

You can install the game and run it, but you'll also be installing a trojan rootkit. Jorik.IRCBot being the worst of the two, which damages your system.

Plain and simple, avoid this torrent."
,elyolker,2011-08-18T13:52Z,"Look. I get that sometimes there are false alarms when scanning the crack. But there is no reason what-so-fucking-ever to have ANYTHING that will give off a false alarm in a nfoviewer. An nfoviewer is just something that shows you a page of text. 

This is full of viruses. Avoid."
,Metalsand,2011-08-18T14:39Z,"YOU DUMB FUCKS.  Just because your anti-virus reports, suprise suprise, a HACKED game crack as, guess what, a HACK, does NOT mean that it's a fucking virus.  Get a god damn degree in Computer Science or Programming, then I will welcome your opinion, otherwise, STFU, and let people like me look at it for myself.

Game is NOT a virus, works perfectly, you need to install these three to ensure it launches, since usually steam auto updates these for a game, and it isn't, because it's pirated.

These fucking dickwads obviously don't know what they are doing. And TPB is full of them.
