You have to download Calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert these for other e-readers such as ipad, nook, etc.  

Just add the files to Calibre, right click on it and click "Convert Books" then "Convert Individually".  On the window that pops up, select which format you want at the top right next to "Output Format."  Then once it's done converting, right click the file again and select "Save to disk" then "Save single format to disk" and select which file type (epub for ipad and nook, etc).
