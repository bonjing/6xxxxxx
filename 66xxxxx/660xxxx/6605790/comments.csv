,cowboy4hacking,2011-08-26T19:11Z,"It downloaded and installed perfectly, But, I cannot upgrade my car... I've raced many races, Even threw on the cheats to unlock performance package 1 and 2 and STILL they show up as locked... I think something is wrong with a file or something...."
,cowboy4hacking,2011-08-26T23:20Z,"Anyone got any idea? I've spent all day trying to figure out why the heck i cant unlock any car upgrades, I cant even change my paint or bumpers or anything, Everything just has the locked picture still on it and wont open. :( Really frustrated..."
,cowboy4hacking,2011-08-27T02:47Z,"So here's the bottom line... The game works beautifuly, As long as you dont mind driving around in a completely stock car and only being able to do about 10races befor the other cars get upgraded and start beating you. I have re-downloaded the file on 4 diffrent computers, tryed C/D's, Tryed everything and cannot get the upgrades to unlock. I even used cheats that unlock them, and sure shit they were still locked. So this download is basicaly trash...."

,cowboy4hacking,2011-08-28T14:24Z,"Shit :/ My bad then, Im sorry. Im not exactly sure why its not letting my upgrade, I download with Vuze, Extract files to folder on my desktop, open folder and click on Need for speed 2, Starts game, But no matter what, I cannot upgrade my car. Anyone out there have any idea what im doing wrong? Also, Im having trouble deleting it off my harddrive, I delete every file i can find that has anything to do with NFS underground 2 and yet when i download from another link my original profile shows up from this download. Thanks for setting me straight 71XEN071, again, sorry about that."
