Internet Cleaner tool

Your browser saves a record of everything you do and every page you visit. The new Internet Cleaner tool lets you quickly delete your complete surfing trail, with separate settings for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera.
Hosts File Checker

Your computerâ€™s â€œHostsâ€ file lists the location of known Internet sites and is always checked first for the address when you access a site.
