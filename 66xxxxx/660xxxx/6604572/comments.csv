have some respect instead of spamming in every torrent"
,dman174,2011-08-15T09:21Z,"Hi holyroses!  Actually created this account to thank you for doing such an amazing job!  Without a doubt the greatest torrent uploader I've come across!  And just a tiny suggestion, maybe you could upload the Star Wars BluRay sega just released this year.  I'm trying to do these kind of things myself, especially now that handbrake has support for BluRay, but I have no idea how to actually get the BluRay disk to work with my mac!  Any suggestions?  Thanks again man, you truly are the greatest!"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-08-15T14:02Z,you will need to purchase an external usb bluray player since apple isn't currently shipping any bluray players.
,narutoden,2011-08-15T20:04Z,Please I beg you do the 400 mb version.
,Micebiker,2011-08-16T00:13Z,"@HR
are you going to try to work together with albert so you don't upload the same movies?
That way i know i can dl from both of you and not suddenly see the same one again with the other person."
,livefree68,2011-08-16T21:34Z,Thanks for the up HolyRoses!
,babydollsuckerpunch,2011-09-17T19:36Z,"AWESOME UPLOAD!! Kick-ass is much better than this movie though in terms of being a superhero but i still enjoyed this very much.
