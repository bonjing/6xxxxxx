,Cerebral222,2011-08-18T16:28Z,"Ok, I have a few issues here; 1) you will need to download the xlive.dll to kick the game over. 2) Uploader could've mentioned that you only need 1 of the two files of this torrent as they are 2 forms of the same thing: The top one extracts as an ISO, and the bottom one you will need to extract into a folder and run it from there, but they are both a full version of the game. 3) After all the time downloading I couldn't get it to run past the microsoft splash, maybe my video card: 1 Gig Nvidia GeForce 210 on Win 7 32 bit, just FYI."
