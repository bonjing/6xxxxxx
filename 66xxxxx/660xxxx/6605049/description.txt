In the second edition of this very successful book, Tony Sammes and Brian Jenkinson show how the contents of computer systems can be recovered, even when hidden or subverted by criminals. Equally important, they demonstrate how to insure that computer evidence is admissible in court. Updated to meet ACPO 2003 guidelines, Forensic Computing: A Practitioner's Guide offers: methods for recovering evidence information from computer systems; principles of password protection and data encryption; evaluation procedures used in circumventing a systemâ€™s internal security safeguards, and full search and seizure protocols for experts and police officers.
