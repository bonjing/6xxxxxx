[T],Shepard76,2011-08-15T03:26Z,"Emman09  it weights 4.22 because this is semi HD (1440 x 1080). My upload is very slow though, be patient. If you find someone with better upload speed download it instead of this. I'll try to seed as long as I can tough."

Shepard76: The Audio for the Introduction (220MB file) is in Catalan. Is the same for the 1st and 2nd Half?

Still appreciate your upload"
[T],Shepard76,2011-08-15T19:39Z,"Yes Emman09, all the audio is in catalan. But don't watch the 220 mb file yet :-) because those were the last minutes of the 1st half. I don't know what happended but the last minutes were recorde in a separate file. I guess that happened because T.V tuner reach a 4 gb limit or something. I sill need to know that card better :-)  So, watch the larger file first. Thanks."
