Going for the One is the eighth studio album by British progressive rock band Yes. It was
released in 1977 after an extended break for solo activity, and is especially notable for
marking the return of keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who had departed in 1974 in the aftermath
of the Tales from Topographic Oceans tour. His re-entry was facilitated by the departure of
Patrick Moraz, after having only played on Relayer, although Moraz is thanked in the credits.

Allmusic's Ross Boissoneau has described this album as "perhaps the most overlooked item
in the Yes catalog" Jon Anderson has said of the song "Awaken". "We had a hit record! I
loved listening to 'Awaken', at last we had created a Masterwork" and has indicated in some
interviews that he considers it to be Yes's most complete composition.

This album is a return to shorter, catchier songs after the experimental Close to the Edge,
Tales from Topographic Oceans and Relayer.
