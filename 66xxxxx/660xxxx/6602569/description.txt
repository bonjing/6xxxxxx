AMAZING, ADDICTIVE, ADORABLE and AFFORDABLE! With SnakeRace, Norwegian game company TapCat takes the familiar concepts of good, old Snake to whole new levels. SnakeRace comes with 5 amazing, diverse worlds, each worth hours upon hours of fun and exciting gameplay. Complete all the missions or challenge your friends' highscores on Game Center with separate leaderboards for every world. 

In SnakeRace, you make full use of your viper-like reflexes and super-human finger dexterity in order to navigate terrains strewn with obstacles. Whether you crawl along at the pace of a freshwater snail, or hurtle through hyperspace above the speed of light, you will be challenged to collect gems while striving to get ever closer to the elusive finishline. 

*** Notable features *** 

DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY: Most worlds allow the player to adjust the speed in order to get the desired difficulty, but don't go too slow, with great speeds come great scores. Most worlds also allow a more experienced player to choose higher risk paths with better scoring opportunities. 

SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE CONTROLS: The game uses a single-tap interface, no sliding or complex movements required. However, the player may choose to activate direction buttons on the bottom of the screen. The direction buttons require two fingers to be operated. Without the direction buttons, the game can easily be played with one hand.
