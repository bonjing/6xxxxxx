                A young lion prince is born in Africa, thus            
                 making his uncle Scar the second in line to           
                the throne. Scar plots with the hyenas to           
              kill King Mufasa and Prince Simba, thus                
              making himself King. The King is killed and           
            Simba is led to believe by Scar that it was          
             his fault, and so flees the kingdom in shame.       
            After years of exile he is persuaded to            
              return home to overthrow the usurper and             
            claim the kingdom as his own thus completing
