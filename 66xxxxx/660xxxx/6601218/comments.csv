[T],FatFreddy76,2011-08-13T18:56Z,"@P2P4L1f3, The game is not patched, once you try to find online servers for the first time you are required to download the latest patch, or you run the haloupdate.exe. Also it works with Windows 7 x64."

This great, but I've got one bad issue :( I accidentally set the game to run in safe mode and there seem to be no way to make it run normally. Right now it won't let me play with full video settings. I have a great graphics card. It's just stuck in safe mode. Please help me :("
