phones, and while the kids played, there was time for the grownups to talk. Zoe told me that she was a pastry chef and baker who'd been trained at the Culinary Institute of America (CIA).

at a fortuitous coincidence. I wasn't a food professional at all, but I'd been tinkering for years with easy methods for making homemade bread. We chatted about the challenges of re-creating authentic baguettes without French flour ("You can't? Uh, yeah, I knew that."). I told her about a recipe I'd been tryÂ¬ing to develop for years to create artisan breads at home while investing very minimal time. The secret: use pre-mixed, high-moisture stored dough. It was promising, but it needed lots of work. This was a job for a professional baker.

I knew I had to get her to try the bread to convince her that she ought to join me in this project (and maybe more important, that involvement with five-minute yeast bread wouldn't turn her into a culinary laughingstock). This woman was a baker whose food at Minneapolis restaurants had been reviewed as "endlessly delicious ...the best in town. .. appealing, inventive and flat-out gorgeous...." Maybe she had lower standards for bread than for dessert.
