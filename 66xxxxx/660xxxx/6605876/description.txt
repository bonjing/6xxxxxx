In 1993 the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most original bands of the alternative scene. With incredible soundscapes of guitar distortion, Billy Corgan's impassioned and ethereal vocals, and Jimmy Chamberlain's excellent drumming, these guys had a sound that was nothing like any alternative band of the time. Produced by Butch Vig (Garbage, Sonic Youth, Nirvana's Nevermind), Siamese Dream is first about guitars. Throughout each song, Billy Corgan delivers angsty lyrics in his signature breathy whine. Disarm is a nice intermission halfway though the album; it throws the listener into a different mood with its full string arrangements and radiant orchestral chimes. But then it is back to the aural masochism; a pain that rarely sounds so sweet.
