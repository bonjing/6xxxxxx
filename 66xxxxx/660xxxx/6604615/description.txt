    Penny-less and job-less, Sandy gets by on her looks and attitude, and    
    by borrowing from her high-powered sister. At her best friend's          
    funeral, she meets a handsome con artist, Keith, and as soon as she      
    gets her stolen goods back from him, she plans on being on her own       
    again. But when her sister gets into a load of legal and financial       
    trouble, Sandy accepts a too-good-to-be-true job offer from Keith,       
    and then tries to support her argumentative family.
