Howard Zinn has an easy, self-effacing, and humorous manner. This makes him so enjoyable and entertaining to listen to that it is easy to miss the import of his message. Zinn is an erudite historian, drawing on a broad base of knowledge. Using the same resources available to fellow historians and verifiable by any interested listener, he comes up with an alternative history of the United States that is not taught in schools. Part of his value as a historian is that fact that he brings to life important, but forgotten figures of the past, and he brings to light the facts and details of historic episodes that can be recalled by name but of which little more is known.

Howard Zinn is the author of the best-selling ''People's History Of The United States'' (over a million copies sold), and numerous other works of history, politics, and biography..
