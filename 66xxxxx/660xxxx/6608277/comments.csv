1. The transmission goes blocky every now and again. That could however be coming from the transmission of the station and not from the encoding.

2. Sound level problems again.... the sound in Window Media Player is so soft even at 100% that you almost cannot hear it."

I hope to be able to get the rest of this season downloaded soon so I can watch it all. "
