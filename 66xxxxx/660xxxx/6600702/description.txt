7 Lives Exposed (also known as 7 Lives Xposed) is an American reality television-themed series produced by Playboy TV. The series was first aired in late 2001, with a second season following in late 2002. The series starred pornographic actress Devinn Lane and was produced by Tom Lazarus.
The concept of the series is similar to that of Survivor and Big Brother -- contestants must satisfy certain ongoing criteria or risk being "evicted"; in this case, Lane herself decides who among a set of couples living together in a Los Angeles-area home stays or goes each episode.

As the primary audience of the series is heterosexual men, there are both heterosexual and lesbian sex scenes throughout the series. The sex is simulated; however, scenes of oral sex and masturbation are much more explicit in that some contact is shown. Dramatic tension arises from conflicts between the contestants, often related to jealousy and competition.

The last season (**NOT INCLUDED HERE**) aired in 2006, which was Season 6
