BBC journalist Rageh Omaar travels to the place of Muhammad\\\'s birth to re-trace the actual footsteps of the Prophet; from humble beginnings in Mecca, to his struggles with accepting his Prophetic role, his flight to Medina, to the founding of the first Islamic constitution, and his subsequent military and political successes and failures â€“ through to his death and his legacy.

Filmed on location in Saudi Arabia, Jerusalem, Turkey, Syria, the USA, the UK and Jordan the series also draws on the expertise and comment from some of the world\\\'s leading academics and commentators on Islam, including Tariq Ramadan, academic and fellow of St Anthony\\\'s College, Oxford, and writer and broadcaster Ziauddin Sardar.

Raising questions about Islam\\\'s role in the world today and exploring where Islam\\\'s attitudes towards money, charity, women, social equality, religious tolerance, war and conflict originate, the series offers a fascinating, timely and truly unique insight into the Islamic faith.

Rageh Omaar says: \\\"I am extremely pleased to be presenting this exciting and groundbreaking series about this extraordinary man, Muhammad â€“ the Prophet of Islam. The details of Muhammad\\\'s life really are little known, and I hope that my series will â€“ for many â€“ shine a light on the very beginning of Islam, taking viewers to the heart of this faith, illustrating just how Muhammad\\\'s life and legacy is as important today as it was a over a thousand years ago.\\\"
