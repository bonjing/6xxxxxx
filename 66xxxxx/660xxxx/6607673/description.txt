     If you don\'t know the Bongos I don\'t know what to say,
if you want their first LP, check out my torrent of
Bongos_1st_CD
   It has a very nice cover of the song \"Mambo Sun\" 
first done by T. Rex on the Electric Warrior LP
   The big ones on here were \"Numbers With Wings\"
and \"Barbarella\" but \"Sweet Blue Cage\" is classic
Bongos and very nice. Oh both of my Bongos Torrents
are Flac, and have \"Replay Gain\" which actually lowers
the volume, sort of a \"Normalizing\" thing. It can be
removed though, since it\'s just a command to the player
it doesn\'t actually change the file, but on playback
it does make the player volume lower.  So if you remove
the Replay Gain from the files, you will have louder 
flac files.  Oh well have fun playing with that if
you like, but here it is, Numbers With Wings
