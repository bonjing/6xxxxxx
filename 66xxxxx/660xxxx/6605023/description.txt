Review

Tony Russell's review is from Gramophone, September 1970:

Fair Game and Foul (Topic 12T195) is the seventh volume of The Folk Songs af Britain which Caedmon issued in America some years ago and Topic are now making available in this country. It deals with â€œhighwaymen, poachers, and all manner of miscreantsâ€, and contains several pieces well known to the least experienced of folksong enthusiasts: Brennan on the Moor, The Butcher Boy, Polly Vaughan, Van Diemen's Land. (It is also valuable to students of American folksong, since a number of the pieces crossed the Atlantic to enjoy favour and experience transformation.) Among the twenty performances is Mary Doran's lovely Oxford City; another of those remarkable pub recordings from Blaxhall in Suffolk, Bob Scarce's Newlyn Town; and one of the few accompanied songs in the series, Ethel and John Findlater's The Standing Stones sung to the accordion. I think this is one of the best in the ten-volume collection, but the whole set is of major importance to student, singer and listener.
