,ArtieChoke,2011-08-15T08:40Z,"Sorry, it comes with:
- GoldenEye 007
- Mario Kart 64
- Pokemon Stadium 
- Rampage 2
- Super Mario 64
- Super Smash Bros

It is meant to be a basic starter pack"
,mea7sucks,2011-08-15T13:41Z,"Sixtyforce fucking sucks. You need an emulator that uses OpenGL. Also, you can't use custom plugins without rebuilding them for sixty force.

I'm not trolling -.- but seriously, try using wxMupen64Plus (make sure its wx, it has a gui)"
,ArtieChoke,2011-08-16T02:20Z,"@mea7sucks 

I will actually have a look into it mate, sounds good

@WildxChild

Haha you are probably right but I still liked my 007 even on my keyboard :)"

,Porno4pyros,2011-10-01T21:16Z,Its not working for me it just pops open a purple screen and tells me to go Register. can some one Advise me on how to do this .
,pioneer181,2011-10-06T18:56Z,"@Porno4pyros

When it first opens and asks to register to sixtyforce just click ok, but leave the window open. Then just double click on the game you want to open again and it will work."
