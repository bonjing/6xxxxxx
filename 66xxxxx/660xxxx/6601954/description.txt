By the time you read this, the number applications on the App Store will have crossed the 100,000 mark. Chances are that if you come up with an idea for an app, itâ€™s already on the Store and in abundance. In order to catch usersâ€™
interest, youâ€™ll have to differentiate yours.

Most developers seem to take the easy route by simply lowering their price. The problem is that itâ€™s so easy to do that everybody can do it. And if they do, youâ€™ve gained nothing. On the contrary, youâ€™ve lost an income that could possibly motivate you to keep improving and updating your app and thereby sustain your name as a reliable developer users can trust their investment to.

If you choose to take the difficult route, however, and differentiate on qualityâ€”the route that not everybody can takeâ€”youâ€™ll not only become a better developer but also earn the respect from other developers and users whoâ€™ll be willing to spend real time and money on your app.

The ten authors of this book have all released successful apps and can testify to how going that extra mile, or ten, has paid off in many aspects of their lives as iPhone developers. By reading their takes on how to make an app stand out from the rest, youâ€™ll gain some of the inspiration and insight that could make your app the one in its category that users will want.

If youâ€™re not going to differentiate your app on quality, this book is probably not for you. Instead, just go to iTunes Connect, and lower your price.
