But I must ask (hopefully curiousity will not kill this 'cat'):
Is this a fully ""usable"" copy so we can actually try some development, or just a demo?
Did you ever work in alpha (business) basic mini-systems/databases or mainframe SQL prior to working in FoxPro?"
,mrizzo2,2011-08-20T15:10Z,"It admittedly does not include the runtime 
module that would allow you to distribute your code without giving them a full copy of this program
- which is what the download will give you.

I did not work in Unix or mini-minframe environments. I worked in Dos/Novell Networked installations only - although the programs ran under windows too as they did under dos for which I developed them originally.
I remember paying a fortune for my copy of foxpro for windows (a thousand dollars or more including the runtime module/distribution kit). Hope this helps - Michael Chessman"
