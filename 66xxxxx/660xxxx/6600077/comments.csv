,thelung,2011-10-11T22:26Z,Is this any good?
,thelung,2011-10-11T22:35Z,"this is basically an .msstyle extractor.  It takes pretty much all of the decent .msstyle themes and extracts them to your /windows/resources/themes folder.  You will still have to manually go to that folder and open them yourself, allowing the 'display properties' dialog box to then open; allowing you to 'apply' those settings.  not a bad torrent, i have not scanned it at all so enter at your own risk."
