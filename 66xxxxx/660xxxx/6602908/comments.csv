,spacetronaut,2011-09-03T21:04Z,"I had the 2123 error code as well I fixed it by googling the code and found answers at: 

http://www.fixya.com/support/t2141036-error_2123_when_enter_app

I used solution 3 but only did steps 1 and 5:

1.Take ownership of Rossetta Stone folder from c:\program files\Rosetta Stone
Right click on \Rosetta Stone folder->click security->click advanced->click on owner, click edit, click on your windows account, check the box replace owner and object containers, click ok and apply
2.Deleted the file tracking.db3 from c:\Program Data
3.Right click on RosettaStoneVersion3.exe from C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone Version 3 and click Properties, compatibility view, then check Run this prohram in compatibility mode for windows Xp sp3 and check the box Run this program as an administrator.
4.I didn't had any av or firewall installed, but I had win defender and win firewall by default and I have turned off windows firewall and disabled windows defender from start->control panel->windows defender->tools options->click on administrator and uncheck the box use this program
5.restarted the pc and worked, home this helps.

Good Luck!"
,captaincaveman1005,2011-09-07T23:35Z,Does anyone have activation codes for the languages?
,Smoarz,2011-09-12T02:38Z,Hey could you do Rosetta stone Thai? One that is compatible with 3.4+? Cause i have one and its not compatible with 3.3...
,mahna50,2011-09-20T18:23Z,"Hi I have placed the crack one in the installation directory but do you put it within the file in ""rosetta stone""?

Because im still asked for activation codes and even when i press later it still is not all open... please help lol"
,Irule305,2011-09-26T01:19Z,"Works great with absolutely no problems on Windows 7 64bit, great job."
,jackporti,2011-10-11T01:57Z,"hay Guys the Availability bar stays red nomatter how much Time i wait
WHY ?"
,SnakeToes,2011-10-14T00:37Z,"How do we actually use it?

I've installed it and installed a language level.

But I'm stopped at the activation screen.  Obviously I don't have a code and if I click activate later nothing happens.  It just goes back to the brown screen.  For now I have to say -0

This doesn't seem to work."
,thegoon77,2011-10-24T02:27Z,works just fine...
,Zeisemaj,2011-10-27T06:16Z,"Love your stuff.  Major props.  Tested it on XP Home SP3 x86 and 7 Pro SP1 x64.  Worked on both flawlessly.  That should cover the general spectrum.  Read some other comments.  Other people having problems just seems like they didn't read/follow the instruction (thoroughly).  I chose never register, i updated as a test and it worked fine (though not recommended as a precaution), and you shouldn't have to activate to continue.  I clicked on at least one lesson of each chapter of each 4 acts. No problem.  Anyways, other than giving you kudos and mentioning everything above as a clue to others, your instructions said you take requests via comments, etc.  Was wondering if you could get back to me on the possibilities of Vietnamese, Latin, and Irish.  Thank you for all of your dedication and help to others."
,tstuts,2011-11-06T04:29Z,"Hi:
 I've tried to install this program and I keep getting an error message too. Any help would be great! Thanks"
,tstuts,2011-11-06T04:59Z,"Hi:
 Ok, I got it to install but now it will not accept any of the individual language disks I try to install. It tells me the language cd can not be found. Help please!!"
,tstuts,2011-11-06T05:01Z,"Hi:
 Ok, I've got it to install but now I can  not get it to install any language disks. It tells me that it can not find a language disk. Help please!!!"
,eaelea,2011-11-10T14:06Z,"I don't understand how to install 
i see what you have written but i don't understand what to do, can you spell it out for me?  It asks for an aktivation code but I don't have one. Pleas help i really want this to work

Installation:

Install Rosetta Stone with the Installation, and set to default settings. Then, grab the (RosettaStoneVersion3.exe) and place it into the installation directory:

*This is for Windows Operating Systems Only!
C:/Program Files/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone Version 3         32-Bit
C;/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone Version 3   64-Bit"
,burritochakito,2011-11-10T21:22Z,Thanks for the download . . . really excited to learn a new language but I can't get past the activation after first two levels! If I don't activate i can only access very few of the rest of the lessons and the rest are locked. Can anybody please help? I've been trying to find a fix for while sometime and am pretty bummed out. Has anyone really been able to access all lessons of all levels? I'm losing hope that this will work . . . =[ PLEASE HELP!!!
,holaquetal,2011-11-12T01:34Z,"GRACIAS, MERCI, THANK YOU, ARIGATO..."
,batosuai,2011-11-17T17:41Z,"OK, so dling and seeding right now, both this and the Japanese language packs.

I can't seem to get this to work, the crack works fine, but when I burn the image it tells me the program has an issue with the disk, and when mounting the image it isn't detected at all. I followed the instructions you provided, and it still doesn't work.

I've got a pile of cd-rs broken next to me, crying for their brethren. A better iso burner or image mounting program would probably work, I'm using Daemon Tools lite and a free image burner, can anybody point me to software that has worked for them? "
,Dinkyido,2011-11-25T20:57Z,"Hello. I`m sorry, but I don`t understand any of the instructions after Download (on this page).
I have the Rosetta Stone thumbnail, but no idea what to do next! I can`t even open it as it`s asking which programme do I wish to use?  
Many Thanks"
,carwx,2012-01-03T02:40Z,What are the activation codes for the language packs in the separate torrents?
