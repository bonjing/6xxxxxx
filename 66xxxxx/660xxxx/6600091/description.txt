A scintillating lecture and discussion by the legendary teacher, historian, playwright, and activist. Here Zinn explains with great humor and passion how his teaching, his history, and his activism are parts of the same project. The stories of social movementsâ€”labor, civil rights, feminists, anti-warâ€”are usually left out or grossly distorted in mainstream history writing. The efforts of Zinn and others to recover and pass on those stories offers to their students, to their readers, and to us, models, ideas, inspirations for how and why we might go about challenging and changing the structures of power.

Howard Zinn is the author of the best-selling ''People's History Of The United States'' (over a million copies sold), and numerous other works of history, politics, and biography.
