Windows is so complicated that normally only experts can keep their systems properly configured and tweaked for the best performance and user experience. This hasn\\\'t gotten any better with Windows Vista--many settings have been moved or renamed and are now even harder to find.

Ashampoo PowerUp 3 is the solution if you don\\\'t want to waste endless hours learning how to configure and maintain Windows, including Windows Vista. It\\\'s a single control center for all your Windows settings and explains everything in simple language. And the new version adds more protection against incorrect settings, more control, more configuration options and makes the whole process easier than ever before. And it comes with a beautiful new graphical design for Windows Vista.
