When Rocky, a young man is appointed as the anchor for the channel, Arun is devastated. He begins to believe that Rocky will win over Alia. Circumstances go out of hand for Arun and he is fired. Arun blames God for his miseries. And lo and behold! He soon has an encounter with the Almighty Himself. An argument ensues. God then decides to give Arun His power for seven days as Arun claims he can do a better job. And this very power becomes the bane of his life.
