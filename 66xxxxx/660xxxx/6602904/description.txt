Youâ€™ll work up a sweat as you raise ye olde animals, produce ye olde goods, and beat ye olde clock during 172 challenging time management levels. Packed with more thrills than a horn of honey beer, Farm Frenzy: Viking Heroes offers a fresh experience that will delight longtime fans and newcomers alike! No helmet required.
