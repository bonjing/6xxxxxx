How does one detect if an mp3 has been upconverted?"
,cisrulez,2011-08-17T08:07Z,"@nebsterboy You can use a program from Adobe I believe, I forgot the name of it.

Anywhos this is a leak that was a NON-GROUPRIP. You cannot just upconvert the MP3 and call it a HQ rip. People are fucking stupid these days.

And NoFS try learning about VBR next time. kthxbai"
[V],nos1977,2011-08-17T14:39Z,Sorry bro... i only like .mp3...

""LEAK version""

You mean this:

??"
,TyMod,2011-08-23T03:04Z,"You can tell a MP3 is upconverted by how ""crisp"" it is.  Many times ""S""s and high frequencies will sound slurred.  NoFS's stuff is always high quality though.  You can upconvert music using converters or Virtual DJ or programs that will let you alter the song frequencies.  Virtual DJ lets you do this.  And record it.  Also you can tell if a MP3 is upconverted by the fact it is JOINT STEREO or only 44100 Hz.  Studio CDs are almost always only Stereo and 48000Hz.  Also you can tell if the LAME plugin is used.

Hope this helps.  I personally like NoFS's work though and I think his stuff always sounds great.

Thanks man,

TyMoD

Also, I pretty much always upconvert music too and my stuff is always of higher quality then most of the shit on here."
