,Kel163,2011-08-15T04:07Z,"bryentheartist, this is. :)
So, there is a problem with that?"
,HMProductions,2011-08-25T23:49Z,Please we need more seeders and leechers. I have been looking for the eps for awhile. It has both original audio and dvd audio and video in good quality. I have only been able to see the first couple seconds of the pilot. We need more seeders and leechers please!
,Kel163,2011-08-28T12:05Z,"HMProductions, I'm still seeding it, btw, didn't stopped. If you have any problems downloading here, ask me to kel163  bk [.] ru.

Can you also answer me in your torrent or here or in e-mail, if you have more exclusive features of Roswell like Unaired Pilot?"
,Kel163,2011-08-28T12:14Z,"There was an ""(at)"" symbol between ""kel163"" and ""bk"". Domain is ""ru"", so feel free to mail there questions about Restored Roswell or Roswell DVD's."
,HMProductions,2011-09-19T06:40Z,Is there a way to get more seeders? I'm only at around 30% done. I will seed once i get it all.
,Kel163,2011-09-19T14:17Z,"HMProductions, apparently I cannot answer you to your hotmail box, can you mail me from Gmail one?"
