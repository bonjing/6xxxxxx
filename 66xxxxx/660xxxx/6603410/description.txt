"I'm Liz Parker and five days ago I died. After that, things got really weird." So begins a new life for Liz and her friend Maria after they discover that three of their classmates at Roswell High aren't exactly from "around here". To be more exact, Max, Isabel and Michael are from "up there". Having grown up quietly within the community, their alien identities are suddenly jeopardized after Max uses his powers to save Liz's life. Now the alien trio must learn to trust their human friends even as they struggle to discover their own true identities.

Note: this is DVDRip's from untouched DVD's. Source of them - Retail R1 NTSC DVD9, US release.
These are ordinary DVD's and contains only DVD Music version. These DVD's was been uploaded on SDBits BitTorrent Community and ripped in AVC by spuck from there.
These DVDRip's are remuxed with spuck's AVC content and mine synced Original Audio, so they contains both English audiotracks: Original TV Music version of Roswell and new DVD Music version.
This is exclusive release: Roswell's HQDVDRip with Original TV Music version - music that was cutted by creators 'cause of frigging licenses and fees when official DVD was release.
Source of TV version audiotrack - my own captures from Sky Italia/Cyfrowy Polsat/NTV+ Roswell repeats on Italian "AXN Sci-Fi"/Polish "FOX Polska"/Russian "Syfy Universal" channels accordingly in 2011 year.

DVDRip's are originally calculated to 700 Mb per episode, 4xDVDR per season.
After I've added original TV Music version audio this calculation doesn't really make sense. :) Whatever, you still can burn them to 5xDVDR if you want to but I'm recommending keep this video on PC.
High Quality DVDRip resolution at 853x480 and untouched AC3 audio for each of audiotrack. Encoded with x264 video codec.

Regards: I just wanna say much thanks to primordial on Demonoid, who was uploaded his rare VHS tape rips and inspired me to do all that stuff. Without him I'm probably didn't see a lot portion of Roswell with this just an amazing, truly magic soundtrack, that I've started share with the others with my Russian HQDVDRip release. That's was some long time ago, before one wonderful thought has jump into my mind and I've started hunting European satellite channells for Roswell repeats hoping that some of them could be possibly contain TV Music version on secondary audiostream, which is English. Some more long time passed before I'd found that channel - Italian "AXN Sci-Fi". I've turned my satellite dish out to the Europe and bought Sky Italia cardsharing package here in Russia just in the last moment before second Roswell repeats are airs on that channel. Unfortunately, this channel has far from good broadcasting manners like cutting few scenes from three episodes, each at the season. Also it has mono audio on first six episodes of Second Season. But fortunate I've got another two channels with Original Broadcasted TV Music version of Roswell: Polish "FOX" and Russian "Syfy Universal" as my backup. FOX's audio were used for first six episodes of S02 and Syfy to fill up the blanks in those episodes where scenes has cutted on AXN Sci-Fi. So now I have this full and complete exclusive stereo audio for all 61 Roswell episodes and made this exclusive DVD's - just for you all, fellow Roswellians! Enjoy. ;-)

To Encoders: Yes, I know, this isn't first release of Roswell DVD's and we already have scene encodes, but no one from Scene will encode this, and you know that. So I'm calling for Standard Quality DVDRip from either Restored DVD or Restored HQDVDRip with both audio at size of 350 Mb per episode. They would be much appreciated from those of you who can do encodes from this source. By myself I'm not good at this, but not everybody can or want download that's kind of huge size content, but they are also deserve to have The Original Broadcast TV Music version of Roswell Soundtrack. ,)
