Release Notes:

It\'s the year 2808. Doomsday is upon us, and any remaining survivors
are living in a post-apocalyptic world of desolate landscapes that they
are eager to rebuild. Or so dubstep duo and apparent disaster movie
enthusiasts Nero would have you believe on their debut album Welcome
Reality.

Sure, it\'s a curious and not wholly original concept that wreaks of
self-indulgence, but when your business is to rework this year\'s genre
of choice by mainstream pop acts into something fresh and exciting,
it\'s also one that happens to work very well.

It\'s clear from the wobbling basslines of \'Guilt\' and strobing synths
in \'Promises\' that they\'ve paid close attention to label bosses Chase &
Status on treading the tightrope between commercial dubstep and
underground drum \'n\' bass, but it\'s when they cut loose with
thunderous, hook-laden \'Doomsday\' and the sledge-hammering guitar on
\'Scorpions\' that they really come into their own.

While they quickly lose sight of their ambitious concept, Welcome
Reality is nonetheless an exhilarating ensemble of euphoric breakdowns
and club-thumping choruses - the best of which feature long-standing
guest vocalist Alana Watson at the helm. Someone sign these two up to
soundtrack Blade Runner II post-haste.
