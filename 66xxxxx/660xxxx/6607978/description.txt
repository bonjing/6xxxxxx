  Concert:   The sound of this audience recording is really good and so is the show. Elvis has a strong song line-up  and he sings songs like America, My Boy or I`ll Remember You with passion. Also Trying To Get To You gets the treatment it deserves. Back in the 50`s we are ! 
The bonus songs are also well chosen with Just Pretend being another highlight 

With covers. Enjoy!
