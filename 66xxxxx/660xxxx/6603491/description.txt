This is an older edition (approx. 2005) of the ClothesFree.com high-resolution preview video. The current edition is available at http://clothesfree.com/videos/naturist-hi.wmv. I like this older cut because it emphasizes how clothes-free recreation helps people feel better about their bodies. A couple of different interviews in the video discuss the effect of nudism on body-image issues.

Although this 10-minute video contains nudity, it isn\'t meant to be titillating and is therefore not classified as \"porn\". If people complain then I will change this.
