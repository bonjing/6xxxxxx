Sound:

Being Aerosmith, the sound is always incredible. 
The music always seems to just go perfectly together 
and they never fail to impress us with their amazing lyrics, 
amazing guitar, amazing everything really. 
The sound of the older songs on this album sound improved from the
original albums so that is great. All the newest stuff can't really sound 
improved because it's pretty much already got a perfect sound.
In my opinion this album has a great sound to it and
being the great band that Aerosmith are, it makes ir perfect.  10



Lyrics and Singing:

Obdviously being Steve Tyler, the lyrics are always incredible. 
And being an album which has all their best hits, 
all the songs have great lyrics. There is not much more I can say 
about the lyrics because there are no songs which aren't featured
on other albums. But yeah the lyrics on this album are great. 10


Impression:

This album is great! It has all the best Aerosmith songs on one album, 
from their very first songs e.g. Dream On, Mama Kin and Same 
Old Song And Dance, To there new stuff e.g. Just Push Play and Jaded.
The good thing about this album is the fact that it has all the famous Aerosmith
tracks plus a few more that weren't as famous but are still great songs. 
Usually I tend to find with 'greatest hits' albums is that they sometimes 
have songs from random albums just picked out to fill the CD, this CD 
however doesn't do that and I think Aerosmith probably have no problems 
because all of their tracks are great and most of them famous, so they don't have to 
fill the gaps with random songs. As you can see I have rated this album
10 for my overall impression and this is because if your a true 
Aerosmith fan, you can never have enough of their hits and this album 
has pretty much all of them! A must have for Aerosmith fans.  10
