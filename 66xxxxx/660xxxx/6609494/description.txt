So, today is the day that Simplicity Linux 11.7 is released! Weâ€™re releasing 4 Editions this time. For those who are new to Simplicity Linux, or those who are just a bit confused about what to download, here is a quick guide to what is what!

Simplicity Linux Desktop Edition 11.7
Desktop is our biggest release. It comes with GIMP, LibreOffice, Transmission, VLC, and lots of other stuff too. It is designed for people who use files locally as well as online. To a large extent, we donâ€™t compromise on Desktop Edition, although we donâ€™t like it to get too large!
