You will find that the number of peers is minuscule, the number of torrents available is tiny - if you can even find a working tracker, and due to the limited bandwidth available on the I2P network any torrent you do find that is reasonably well seeded will be so slow that you will probably give up long before ever obtaining the file.

,AnonTorrents,2011-08-13T20:03Z,"Incorrect gderf. The number of peers are low on I2P directly due to people having all those assumptions and just not knowing of I2P. The point of this torrent is to let people know that hey there is an option out there. I've heard of speeds exceeding 100-200KBps for well seeded torrents which isn't bad at all for a torrent downloaded through encryption through 2-3 nodes in an anonymous way.

The best way to get more content on I2P is to spread the word. The best way to increase the speed is to get more people onto I2P who have their bandwidth settings setup properly. Hence my efforts."
