,Cohuge,2011-08-17T05:20Z,"@dream You probably cannot update because, I don't know, the game is not even released yet?"
,blankor,2011-08-17T05:50Z,anyone else stuck in the intro?
,blankor,2011-08-17T05:51Z,menu not appearing I mean
,runwhen_useeme,2011-08-17T07:37Z,"@dream

Same problem here. When I go to launch or update the game as the directions say, I get

""Internet Access Problem

Unable to access the internet. Please verify your connection. You can change settings...blah blah blah"""
,runwhen_useeme,2011-08-17T07:38Z,"Edit, figured it out. 

Peerblock was blocking it. "
,hookyouup,2011-08-17T08:00Z,This works
,jesuz999,2011-08-17T08:14Z,"Well i dont know guys... I did everything as told, step by step and here we go, it really runs. I understand that update is important because when I tried to launch it without it had bunch of .dll error. After update and point #3 from a list its perfect... for now at least. PS. I dont know will ubisoft have a view into those serial keys we input (hope not), just in case put something that looks like serial instead of AAAAAAAAAAAAAA (just a thought)"
,Spanese,2011-08-17T08:29Z,"Yeah, menu is not showing up."
,Spanese,2011-08-17T08:32Z,Anyone else getting menu not showing up?
,Spanese,2011-08-17T08:38Z,"Nvm, game runs fine! Thanks!"
,Lockey007,2011-08-17T09:25Z,"Aaah bitch! I was about to upload this first!
Site was crashing,DAAAAMN..."
,Jarodd2,2011-08-17T09:45Z,"@grippingline thanks but no, it's not my crack, I just found it on media*fire, the author is ""MitraljezaC""."
,Knifezerker,2011-08-17T10:19Z,"If you guys need help i created a video showing how to download and install on my youtube account ""knifezerker."" I show how to get this game to work PERFECTLY!"
,rideflat9,2011-08-17T10:32Z,"I followed the instructions and I got this for a few times now: 
""QtWebKit4.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."""
,Angerfist_DJ,2011-08-17T10:38Z,Where is the menu???!
,bojancar,2011-08-17T11:04Z,"Don't worry, MitraljezaC is well known on Serbian site http://rapidserbia.com"
,rideflat9,2011-08-17T11:16Z,"Maybe i have the dll problem because I can't update the game! When I try to update it says ""INTERNET ACCESS PROBLEM!"" How to solve this?"
,Knifezerker,2011-08-17T11:43Z,"@rideflat9

I had that .dll missing file too but I fixed it. The problem is that you applied the crack before running the actual game. So take out the crack, then run the update and run the actual game from_dust.exe and it will look for patch and patch it. THEN apply the crack and it will work :)"
,rideflat9,2011-08-17T12:01Z,"@Knifezerker

Thanks for your help! But i didn't applied the crack before i tried to update. 

I watched your video and followed the instructions precisely, step by step but i can't update ""INTERNET ACCESS PROBLEM"". I even tried to exclude the files in AVG and Windows firewall, but it didn't work. I think if I could solve the update issue it would work..."
,Lockey007,2011-08-17T12:11Z,Works perfectly!
,Slothmoss,2011-08-17T12:21Z,Everytime i try to enter a serial it just keeps saying it's incorrect...
,rideflat9,2011-08-17T13:48Z,"Alright! 

Here is my solution for ""INTERNET ACCESS PROBLEM!""

1. Uninstall the game and gamelauncher! 
2. Delete ""hosts"" file from C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\ 
3. Reinstall game
4. Reinstall UbisoftGameLauncher seperately with UbisoftGameLauncherInstaller.exe from the extracted files: from_dust_ALI213.NET\support\Ubisoft
5. Patch with From_Dust.exe from Program Files\Ubisoft\From dust
6. Crack with UbisoftGameLauncher to the seperate ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" folder

Be signed in with an Ubi account!"
,dream2160,2011-08-17T15:02Z,@rideflat9 it didn't work for me
,rideflat9,2011-08-17T15:37Z,"@dream2160

What is the problem, can't you patch?"
,Knifezerker,2011-08-17T16:50Z,"@dream2160

If you cannot update then:

Go to Computer - Windows  - System 32 - Drivers - ect  - and drag ""hosts""ďťż onto ur desktop or delete it. 
Then try updating again.

Do not uninstall the game, just try that."
,Nitro2012,2011-08-17T16:54Z,"thanks for this 
finally it works.

I used what rideflat9 told.

thanks again!!"
,killer331,2011-08-17T16:54Z,Works perfectly
,Nitro2012,2011-08-17T16:55Z,"works great!!
thank you!!"
,blankor,2011-08-17T17:20Z,"TO ALL THOSE WHO CAN'T SEE THE MENU.
I fixed the menu not showing up by launching From Dust.exe as an administrator on Windows 7."
,Revrant,2011-08-17T17:53Z,"""please start the game you want to play instead""

So I can't use the launcher because it won't let me directly start it, how the fuck do you do this, then?"
,rolosdad,2011-08-17T19:14Z,"thanks mate. crack works fine with ALI213 uploaded game.:). not a very good game tho.:(, nice graphics very bland gameplay."
,Darkkania,2011-08-17T19:52Z,does this interfere with any other ubisoft game i have??
,THE0BEAST,2011-08-17T22:15Z,i installed the game did everything step by step first time after installing patching etc. it turns on loads a while then just shuts down and all the other times it just shuts down after ubi logo

,klord2010,2011-08-18T12:58Z,"Ooh, working! Thanks!"
,Kladdekakan,2011-08-18T18:03Z,"1. Mount iso file and run the setup.exe
2. Choose your language and follow the instructions on screen
3. Close the Ubisoft website that will open when you are done installing the game
4. Go to the your gamefolder and run From_Dust.exe
5. If it shows the game is updating go to step 8, if you get an error message go to step 6
6. Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and move your Hosts file somewhere else
7. Go to your game folder and run From_Dust.exe again, it will now show you the game is patching
8. When the game is done patching close the window
9. Go to CRACKONLY folder and move UbisoftGameLauncher.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher
10. Run From_Dust.exe and create a UPlay account
11. When the game asks you for a serial, enter any number you like
12. Press PLAY
13. Enjoy the game and don't forget to place the Hosts file back!"
,THE0BEAST,2011-08-18T20:16Z,i did it but it still crashes after ubisoft logo and sometimes it tries to load but still crashes
