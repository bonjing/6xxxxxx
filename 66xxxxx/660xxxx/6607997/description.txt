Brings tabs to your native Finder and more!

released on August 11, 2011

* New Tab command opens default window location as set in General
  Finder Preferences. Previously it was opening the same location as the
  current tab. This was causing a lot of support requests because novices
  can be stuck in DMG view without sidebar (Lion does not have pill
  button anymore and CMD+OPT+T to show/hide toolbar with sidebar is
  not very well known keyboard shortcut).

* Show/Hide Path Bar and Show/Hide Status Bar commands work
  reliably (even in dual mode).

* Resolved some rare crashes in Folder On Top feature.

* Fixed Applescript command for setting window bounds (issue).

* Ironed out more sidebar issues.

* The CrashWatcher was improved and open-sourced. I've also resolve
  memory leaks.

* TotalFinder.app can be freely relocated. Also optional ~/.totalfinder
  config is not used anymore.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac OS 10.6 or better, Lion ready
