I was just saying that you spend a lot of effort giving advice on tpb policy, which is unusual, not wrong.  Rather you should just focus on your torrent information, and if questions arise as to it's use or implementation then give comment back.

All the piratebay policy is covered in the forums, and should bot be included in the actual text of the torrent (in my opinion)
