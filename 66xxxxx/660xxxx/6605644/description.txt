Battle Kid: Fortress Of Peril[1] is a homebrewed 2D platform video game, released in February 2010 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, created by Sivak Games,[2] and published through Retrozone with the cover art designed by Larry Bundy Jr. Unlike most games in the modern era, Battle Kid is available for purchase on an actual cartridge. While there has been a strong demand for a downloadable version - via wii-ware or PC - the developer has stated that while the game is currently not planned to be released on any other formats due to a contract with Retrozone, a possibility for the future still exists.
