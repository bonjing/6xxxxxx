From the Infowars web site ::

Illegal immigration activist Glenn Spencer talks with Alex about the promotion of three key ATF supervisors responsible for Operation Fast and Furious, the effort by the federal government to arm the banker supported narco terrorist drug cartels in Mexico. The ATF insists it did not allow guns to â€œwalkâ€ into Mexico where they have showed up at crime and murder scenes. 

Alex also covers the latest news on the establishment political front as Rick Perry attempts to distance himself from his past as Al Gore campaign boss.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
