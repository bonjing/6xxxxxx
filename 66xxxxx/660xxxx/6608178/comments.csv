I registered just to comment on this torrent.  I have listened to five different versions of this album, and this torrent provides the one with the best sound quality. 

My portable device wasn't happy with the tags, so I had to change them to make the tracks appear in the right order. Took me a few minutes to do, as I had to change the title of each track. (Not that big of a deal, and I guess each device or software has it's own criteria of which value it sorts by)

I have been waiting for this album, and it has been worth the wait. This is a very good hip-hop album, and I will buy it on CD as soon as it is available where I live. 

Game has also released a lot of very, very good mixtapes, from the top of my head I must mention: The R.E.D. Room (with the 400 bars Skee-mix), Brake Lights, Purp & Patron, (and P&P The Hangover), and Hoodmorning. 

In his ""fake-it-to-make-it""-mission, he definitely made it. 

Plus, it seems like 50 Cent and G-UNIT is out of shit, I am not expecting anything worth listening to from that bunch again, ever. 

Thank you, and good night. "
