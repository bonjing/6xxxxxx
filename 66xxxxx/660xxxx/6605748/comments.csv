,Antisuperman,2011-08-29T18:00Z,"Downloaded this the other day and received an email from Comcast a couple days later saying WWE (or whoever) informed them of me downloading this and threatened to cancel my service.

Anyone else ever have this happen? This is my first time getting something like this in like 5 years of using this site. Any tips?"
