Amazon Review:
This CD single from Delerium contains remixes of the song "Silence" featuring Sarah McLachlan from their 1997 album 'Karma'. ... With McLachlan's lush vocals and lyrics, and Delerium's trance-like rhythms, this single is a must-have. For those music fans that may not always enjoy McLachlan's slow to mid-tempo ballads, this is a complete change of pace for her. Delerium's ethereal beats suit Sarah McLachlan just fine.
