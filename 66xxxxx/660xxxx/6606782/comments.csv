,UncleO,2011-08-17T11:06Z,"Well, I guess we know who the request king is!

Sighing in despair I hope you can find and UL some of the expensive gin rummy books, one such being Michael Sall's ($200 - hunh?! - at gamblersbook.com). (No, not suggesting you fork out $200!)

Thanks and please in one order or the other.
