I tried only the WGA one which I needed. I was able to pass the Windows validation check and install updates normally. My Windows version is Window XP Professional with Service Pack 3, though it is somewhat an exception as it is a Volume License Key (VLK) one.

Keep up the good work, lildude! :)"

Thanks a lot. Great job"
