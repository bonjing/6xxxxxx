"Thereâ€™s no doubt that one of the major issues of twentieth century history, surely in the US, is corporate propaganda.... Its goal from the beginning, perfectly openly and consciously, was to â€˜control the public mind,â€™ as they put it. The reason was that the public mind was seen as the greatest threat to the corporations."â€”Noam Chomsky
