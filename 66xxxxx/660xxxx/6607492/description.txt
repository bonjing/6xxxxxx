Allmusic Review:
George Thorogood has been a glorious one-trick pony throughout his recording career, turning out sturdy barroom rock with half an eye to the blues, and since he tends to hit the same midtempo grooves time after time, a short sampler like this one -- itâ€™s quite brief at only ten tracks -- actually serves him well. Songs like â€œBad to the Bone,â€ â€œWho Do You Love,â€ and â€œOne Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beerâ€ represent Thorogood at his boozy, rocking best. Itâ€™s a short playlist, but the essential story is still here.
