Yes folks, this is the Mother of J-Pop icon Utada Hikaru.
This is the soul of Enka music...and finding any of her CDs is a rare treat, warranting immediate purchase of said CD. Outside of Japan, almost nobody has ever heard Keiiko, but, in Japan, she may very well be even more famous than her illustrious daughter. This is Japanese popular music before J-Pop. Do yourself a big favor...
