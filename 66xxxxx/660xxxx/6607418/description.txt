I had no idea this movie was animated 3D until I watched it on the my EVO3D, it looks f-in awesome,  plus the BONUS CLIP  looks even better.   ITS TOO BAD WE CAN ONLY TRANSFER FILE SIZES OF 4G MAX OTHERWISE THESE MOVIES COULD LOOK EVEN MORE AMAZING!!!   

IM SURE THERE WILL BE AN UPDATE TO ALLOW NTFS FILE FORMAT AND NOT FAT32 !!


PLEASE NOTE !!!  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WATCH THIS VIDEO STANDING UP !!!
THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY !!!
 

its in english
(es en ingles)

Please refer to this guide for an easy method of increasing the volume on the EVO3D to 200% roughly of the original volume !!!

Just remember if you try to make your own videos dont make a file over 4G, that's the max file size transfer for the EVO3D, that is, until some awesome nerd figures a way around it. 

ENJOY!!

I have 26 Titles currently and will have 55 by Christmas. SEED THESE PLEASE!!!


PLEASE NOTE IF YOU JUST DOWNLOAD AND DONT SEED THEN YOU TRULY ARE AN A$$HOLE, JUST SEED WHILE YOURE WATCHING THE MOVIE
