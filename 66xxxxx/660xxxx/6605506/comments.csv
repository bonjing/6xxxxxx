,Wildesy5,2012-01-16T09:33Z,"Anyone know of an easy way to split this audiobook into multiple smaller pieces (so it can be listened to on portable devices)? I've tried a few freeware splitter programs but didn't really have any luck, none of them managed to do the job.

Thanks. Good torrent btw, appreciate it."

,TheEvilDave,2012-01-27T07:55Z,@Wildesy5 ... I have used Audacity to split e-books into chapters. It's not just point and click but once you do it for a chapter it gets easier.
