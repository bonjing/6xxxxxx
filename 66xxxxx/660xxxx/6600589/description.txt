The Rocket Post is a 2006 British drama film directed by Stephen Whittaker and starring Ulrich Thomsen, Shauna Macdonald, Kevin McKidd and Patrick Malahide.[1] It is set on a remote Scottish island during the late 1930s. The arrival of a German rocket scientist is not initially welcomed by the inhabitants of the island.

The film was shot in 2001, but its release was delayed by several years.[2] Additional footage was shot in 2005, and the film was given a limited release in Scotland the following year.

The story is very loosely based on experiments in 1934 by German inventor Gerhard Zucker to provide a postal service to the island of Scarp by rocket mail.[3] Another fictionalised account of the experiment formed the basis of a 2001 film, also called The Rocket Post, which was filmed on Taransay.[4] The film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s original score was composed by Nigel Clarke & Michael Csanyi-Wills and recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London.
