Liberal activism often embraces non-violent resistance in response to State-sponsored terrorism at home and abroad. In this emotional critique, Churchill urges activists to support any and all tactics in order to stop the tyranny of the State. Churchill argues that the terrorist attack of 9/11 disrupted US global capitalism more radically than any peaceful protest the Left has been able to organize. Recorded at a packed and fired up AK Press warehouse in Oakland.
