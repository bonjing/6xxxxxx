Xcode is the central tool for developing software for Mac OS X. It was my privilege to help explain that tool in Step into Xcode: Mac OS X Development. Since then, Apple has released a new operating system, Leopard, and a new Xcode. Xcode 3 is the official development tool for Appleâ€™s iPhone. Xcode 3 Unleashed is a new edition for a new world.

I wrote Xcode 3 Unleashed for people who are new to Mac programming and to Xcode, but Iâ€™ve included plenty of material that will be new even to experienced developers. My approach is to lead you through a simple application project to give you a vocabulary for the workflow of Mac development, and how Xcode and the tools that accompany it fit in. After you have a solid grounding, we can move on to Part II, where the details and more advanced techniques can come out.

Part I is a practical introduction, showing how to use Xcode at every step, from building a command-line tool, to debugging, to building a human interface, to Core Data design and language localization. Companion tools such as Interface Builder and Instruments are essential to developing for the Mac, and I cover them.
