This is the last concert with the Swedish metal band ATC.
The footage was recorded on VHS. But the sound was recorded on a standard 
cassette tape. The soundquality of the VHS was so poor that
it was necessary to merge the audio from the cassette with the
footage from the VHS. This was only possible with the help of 
modern digital editing that we enjoy today.

Hope you will enjoy a moment with the band
