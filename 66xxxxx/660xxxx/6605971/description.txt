This is a torrent containing one pgn file  of all the TWIC (The Week In Chess) issues between the issues 210 and 874. You can always download the latest issues at http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/twic

If you want to read it, I suggest to use SCID http://scid.sourceforge.net/ , maybe the best chess database software out there. Chessbase can surely open it as well.
