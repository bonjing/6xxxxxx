I put this package together to help all the people having
problems problems setting up a Wrath of the Lich King 
3.3.5a client.

I believe in promoting safe download practices and saw 
all of the 'pre-installed, pre-configured for Xxxxxxx 
private server' and had the idea that I could apply a bit
of effort and have something better to offer. Originally
I had hoped that the 'Installer' and 'Patches' could be
pruned and compressed enough to fit on a single dual-layer
DVD, but ultimately was unable to get under the limit. For 
that reason I have included a 'Plan B' for single disc 
backup- see details below.
