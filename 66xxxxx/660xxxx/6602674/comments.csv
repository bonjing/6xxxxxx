- Use a good title system,
- Use Capitals and punctuation,
- Be clear and straight to the point
- Give a LOT more info than that, more than most people would care to know,

If you upload good material and have a clean recognizable  style, people will come back. So far I'm not interested in your uploads because the presentation isn't nice enough for me to care. Sounds stupid eh ?
Take a looked at most colored skull members to see how they do it.

Cheers."
