1898. Holmes and Watson encounter American newspaper magnate, John Moxton, whose yellow press Clarion is beginning to dominate and undermine Victorian England. Public figures are humiliated then murdered. Each incident has a parallel in Alice in Wonderland. And each time the Clarion is conveniently on hand. What is Moxton's master plan and can Homes and Waston unravel it in time? And what is the strange bond that links the detective to a man he has never met... or has he?
