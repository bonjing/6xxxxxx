Allmusic Review:
For a band that was a staple of the arena rock circuit, Blue Ã–yster Cult didn't have that many hits -- actually, only four of their singles made the charts. Still, they had many, many songs that were played heavily on the radio, even if they didn't officially make the charts. The ten-track budget-line collection Super Hits balances the two extremes, taking their two biggest hits -- "(Don't Fear) the Reaper" and "Burnin' for You," naturally -- and supporting them with AOR staples such as "This Ain't the Summer of Love," "Godzilla," "The Red and the Black," "Black Blade," "Screaming Diz Busters," "Flaming Telepaths," "Goin' Through the Motions" and "O.D.'d on Life Itself." Yes, there are many cult favorites missing, but this nevertheless presents a pretty good cross-section of their best stuff, making it worthwhile for casual fans on a budget.
