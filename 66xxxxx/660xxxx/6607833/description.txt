A six-hander with Benoit, Davies and Neal, backed by Ronnie Earl's Broadcasters; Benoit plays on nine of the dozen tracks, taking the leading role on 'Down In The Swamp', 'I Put A Spell On You' and 'Night Life', all songs he had recorded before. Davies has a leading role on five songs. Four were written by or with her frequent collaborator Don Castagno, but with the exception of the fetchingly vulnerable 'So Cold', where Davies plays acoustic with Benoit , they are not his best work, and 'Money' never recovers from the pratfall of its opening line. Neal has a hand in nearly all tracks on this album, taking the lead part on 'I've Been Mistreated', 'Bop 'Till I Drop' and 'Still Called The Blues' and an even share of 'Luberta'. It isn't distinctive material and Neal's handling of it is restrained at best, at worst sluggish.
