,King436,2011-08-16T04:25Z,"Hmm, Weird! Im downloading at around 340 KB/s And it says around 6 minutes. Apparently there is only 1 seeder but u torrent is giving me 13 or so. Hope this works! :) "
,gaige333,2011-08-16T05:46Z,"Game works perfectly, spent a while playing it and not one bug I can see at all. Game runs perfectly."
,Netarangi,2011-08-16T06:43Z,"King, you're an idiot. These seeder stats aren't realtime."
,Bersercker,2011-08-16T16:39Z,My Kaspersky says there is a trojan inside. ;\
,Bersercker,2011-08-16T17:03Z,"Upd: i googled a bit, and it seems kaspersky(and some others) detects this Trojan.Win32.Chifrax.a in all of the theta releases due to some packing technique they use..."
,thecrazytom,2011-08-16T20:21Z,"Good torrent, but I have a problem. The game doesn't respond to keys ""A""(strafe left) and ""E""(next ship).

Am I the only one with this problem?"
,King436,2011-08-17T06:14Z,"@Netarangi Heh Yeah, think I learned that now. :P"
,Erbalist,2011-08-20T03:06Z,"@Bersercker
how do you know theta is not using the same virus in all their releases to create a bot net?"
,miguelsz3,2011-08-21T17:14Z,"@Erbalist
That's a bit overly suspicious no?"
,_Necross_,2011-08-23T01:03Z,Works fine so far.
,Palon,2011-08-23T18:33Z,Works perfect. I'm waiting fora  crack of new versions :]
,Rodrifg,2011-08-24T06:11Z,did anyone else download that patch of 1.0001 version from Whykaytak? I downloaded it and my game updated to that version but tbh I didn't see much difference ingame. anyway why did it disappear from the torrent's list?
,miguelsz3,2011-08-24T12:15Z,"@Rodrifg 
1.) Why post this here?

2.) The torrent has either been deleted by the user or a mod...

3.) The account have been banned."

,miguelsz3,2011-08-25T09:43Z,"@Euphytose
Its a false positive... =-="
,N4o7A,2011-08-28T06:46Z,"Works great, installed easily the only question I have is can you use the automatic patch in the startup window or is that a no-no?"
,miguelsz3,2011-08-28T14:05Z,Well... Sense its not cracked for the patch I would say no.
,d0000h,2011-08-30T03:07Z,"@miguelsz3
""@Rodrifg
1.) Why post this here?""

Errr where else is he supposed to post it? I had questions about a patch/update as well. This seems like the obvious place to talk about it.

Thx for the upload."
,Mikeee200,2011-09-02T22:46Z,"Works, Downloaded in less then 10min"
,N4o7A,2011-09-09T07:18Z,oook thnks @miguelsz3 I figured as much for patching
,Aigre,2011-09-15T16:16Z,"I really hate the exe file packaging.

WHINE..."
,Aigre,2011-09-15T16:19Z,"The last time I opened an EXE file from Theta, I got a virus that my anti-virus couldn't detect.

I just had weird processes sucking up my system resources..."
,Honjura,2011-09-19T10:23Z,"@ Algre, was it svchost? if so that's a bug in the windows operating system, it causes memory leak thus stealing all the CPU regardless of how much you have it will 60-90% of it at any given time."
,aw3some0,2011-09-24T18:44Z,@honjura do you know of a way to fix it?
,Booredd,2011-09-25T11:34Z,"Oh my Fucking god why do idiots use this website why would someone put one trojan in  a download instead of 100 the ""trojan"" your refering to is the crack which tricks the computer into thinking the disk is in the drive so you can play it"
,Aigre,2011-09-26T11:46Z,Virus scan on game files with Symantec turns out clean.
,KrackShot,2011-09-27T03:56Z,"Any chance there'll be an update for the new content? Or perhaps a way to install the update without losing the crack or even a simple move cracked exe, update, and move back method?"
