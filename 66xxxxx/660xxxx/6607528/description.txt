Hrmm.... Not much to say. Heres a description of the game.

"Space Pirates and Zombies takes place far enough in the future that Earth has become a toxic backwater planet, so potentially not that far in the future.  The galaxy has been colonized by humans, and the only means to travel to new star systems is through highly restricted and well defended warp gates.  It is well known that systems closer to the galactic core become richer and richer as well as more scientifically advanced.  This has led to theories of a secret system with a cache of treasure or knowledge at the galactic core feeding this growth.  As a pirate, you must assemble a fleet and discover what treasure awaits you there."
