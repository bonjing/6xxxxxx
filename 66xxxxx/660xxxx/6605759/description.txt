Label MCA (USA) 
Original Year 1987

Lyle Lovett's career bloomed late but by the time he signed a major recording contract he was nearly 30 years old and had years of experience playing cover songs and folk festivals. Lovett's quirky tunes, each of them a beguiling story in miniature, have helped define a new breed of singer-songwriter who exists outside traditional boundaries like folk and country.
