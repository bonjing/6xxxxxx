Medieval FightBook 
Hidden in a dusty library locked in a secure vault this obscure and strange manuscript has the power to unlock lost secrets from a medieval world. Contained within the beautifully illustrated 150 paper folios is unique imagery of bloody but highly sophisticated combat, weird futuristic designs and inventions, ingenious engineering and judicial duels. Hans Talhoffer's 1459 Fightbook is one of medieval worlds' most mysterious manuscripts, challenging the legends and myths that surrounded this so often misunderstood period of our history.
Violent, secretive, spiritual and packed full of knowledge, an obscure and mysterious manuscript called the Fight Book realistically depicts the bloody side of Europe in the Middle Ages. Through historical re-creations, CGI and leading historians, we reveal the surprising detail that proves medieval society was far more refined and peculiar than we realize.
