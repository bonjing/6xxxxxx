This is an exact clone of the 5.1 surround sound DVD bundled with the Limited Edition Deluxe Box Set.
The 5.1 surround sound DVD is exclusive to this box set and is limited to 5000 copies worldwide. :/

Note: Nothing is removed or re-encoded, the DVD has no menu, all you get is a green spectrum analyser
and a great 5.1 mix of the album (full bitrate DTS & Dolby). :D
