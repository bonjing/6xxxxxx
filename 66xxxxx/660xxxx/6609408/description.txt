So, today is the day that Simplicity Linux 11.7 is released! Weâ€™re releasing 4 Editions this time. For those who are new to Simplicity Linux, or those who are just a bit confused about what to download, here is a quick guide to what is what!

Simplicity Linux Obsidian 11.7
Obsidian is our stripped down to the bone Edition. You get a browser, Flash, and the network manager, and not a lot else! Itâ€™s designed to be a very fast, very basic Linux and is the only Edition we release without XFCE â€“ namely because itâ€™s designed for web use and little else.
