,NeikanTenshi87,2011-08-16T06:40Z,"Hey, I made an account just so I could comment and say thank you so much for what you do. Also I was wondering if you know where I might be able to find Punisher Max #1-5 of the newer series that started in 2010. I see that you pretty much have them all starting with #6. Anyways, thanks again for your uploads, there are very appreciated! I will seed as long as I can!"
