,mr_wolf83,2012-04-06T03:34Z,"Awesome upload! Many Thanks! 

Great quality sound and video - there is a slight audio offset, anyone using VLC can fix this:

on the menu choose Window > Track Synchronisation

In the Advance of audio over video: type 0.4 s

wait for vlc to figure stuff out... then ... fixed!

(note - this just adjusts the delay between the video/audio playback, it has no effect on the file itself.)"
