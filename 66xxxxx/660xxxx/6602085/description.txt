Who This Book Is For

This book is written for new iPhone developers with projects to get done and a new
unfamiliar SDK in their hands. Although each programmer brings different goals and
experiences to the table, most developers end up solving similar tasks in their development work:â€œHow do I build a table?â€;â€œHow do I create a secure keychain entry?â€; â€œHow do I search the Address Book?â€;â€œHow do I move between views?â€; and â€œHow do I use Core Location?â€

The iPhone Developerâ€™s Cookbook is aimed squarely at anyone just getting started with iPhone programming.With its clear, fully documented examples, it will get you up to speed and working productively. It presents already tested ready-to-use solutions, letting programmers focus on the specifics of their application rather than on boilerplate tasks.
