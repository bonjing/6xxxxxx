Charlie Christian  The Genius Of The Electric Guitar (4 CD)
Audio CD:  September 24, 2002 
Format: Mp3@320 
Label: Sony

He changed the guitar world. He changed it not so much as being a superb guitar player, but rather the music that he made. Anyone that would study him can see where all the other guitar players who came after him evolved, that they came from his fountainhead. They came from that and went their own way, according to their own tastes, but he was a way-shower. He was as much a way-shower as any philosophical giant that other people have come along and patterned themselves after.
