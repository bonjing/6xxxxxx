This book published November 2003 is a macroscopic view of United States foreign policy from World War II to the post-Iraq War reconstruction. The central focus of the book, as with many of Chomsky's political works, is the examination of the United States' political, military and economic motives, in comparison â€”often in sharp contrastâ€” to its outward rhetorical support for democracy, the Middle-East peace process, free trade, and human rights. There is an examination of the differences between positions taken by the US government and the people of the world regarding a proposed invasion of Iraq. It also examines the doctrinal thinking of the Establishment in the United Kingdom and the US, such as in regard to propaganda use, centralised decision making and imperialism of Western powers from recent American invasions to the European empires. Chomsky also analyzes what he perceives to be the selective application of the term "terror" to enemies of the U.S., while the actions of the U.S. and its allies are ignored.
