I was lucky enough to see the show in Dublin and it is absolutely amazing, this however is not.

If you haven't seen the show and don't want it totally ruined do not watch this! The guy has the camera all over the place and seems almost hell bent on missing some of the best parts of the show.

Do yourself a favour and wait for a retail DVD to  be released and ripped because this will ruin the show for you!"
