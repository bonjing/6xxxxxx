	Comical 0.8: it lives! 
	 Overcoming overwhelming odds, I've unleashed Comical 0.8 on an unwitting, unprepared, and totally unfazed public! This release contains so many new features, that I debated skipping a number and going straight to 0.9, or even 1.0!

Anyway, there's a bunch of new features in there, because YOU demanded them! So now I'm demanding, go download it!
