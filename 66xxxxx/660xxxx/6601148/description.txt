Release Title: Cinderella Man 2005 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Ron Howard
Tagline: During the Great Depression, a common-man hero, James J. Braddock--a.k.a. the Cinderella Man
was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history. By the early 1930s, the
impoverished ex-prizefighter was seemingly as broken-down, beaten-up and out-of-luck as much
of the rest of the American populace who had hit rock bottom. His career appeared to be finished,
he was unable to pay the bills, the only thing that mattered to him--his family--was in danger,
and he was even forced to go on Public Relief. But deep inside, Jim Braddock never relinquished
his determination. Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible
dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. No
one thought he had a shot. However Braddock, fueled by something beyond mere competition, kept
winning. Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete.
