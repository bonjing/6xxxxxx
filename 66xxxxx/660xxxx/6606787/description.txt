The Fallout is the debut album by Canadian post-grunge/alternative rock band Default. Chad Kroeger, the frontman of Nickelback, contributed to the album's production and co-wrote six of its songs including its second single. With two hit singles, The Fallout is widely considered Default's best work and was their biggest commercial success, gaining platinum certification in the United States. The song "Wasting My Time" received much airplay throughout 2001 and 2002. The second single, "Deny," was featured on the soundtrack of the popular NHL 2003 game by EA Sports and also received a great deal of air time, helping launch Default into the mainstream of Canadian rock.
