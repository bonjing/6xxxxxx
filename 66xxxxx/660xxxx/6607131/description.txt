A large international conference in Electronic Engineering and Computing Technology was just held in London, July 1-3, 2009, under the World Congress on Engineering (WCE 2009). The WCE 2009 is organized by the International Association of Engineers (IAENG), with congress details available at: http://www.iaeng.org/WCE2009. IAENG is a non-profit international association for the engineers and the computer scientists, which was found originally in 1968. There have been more than eight hundred manuscript submissions for the WCE 2009.
