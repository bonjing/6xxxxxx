,pumpkin420,2011-08-15T19:29Z,"This is the OEM version and it is not activated, it will last 30 days without activation."
,namshub,2011-08-25T19:47Z,"@de350z: You want Daz's Windows Loader:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6620384/Windows_Loader_v2.0.6_%28x32_x64%29_-_By_Daz_%5BDwzRG%5D

Download & install Win 7 normally, with a clean OEM copy such as in this torrent (no exploits, patches or anything).

After install, run the Windows Loader above. It's clean, undetectable, your Win 7 appears activated. You can turn on Automatic Updates, and there's no processes that need to run in the background.

I've done this in the past, with a different clean OEM Win 7 torrent and an earlier version of Daz's Loader, but today I am doing a new install using this torrent's Win and the new Loader I linked to above.

When I finish I will comment."
,namshub,2011-08-25T20:01Z,"Bah, I just noticed this is Home Premium and not Ultimate. I did finish d/l'ing though and it was perfect, just not what I needed."
,kastr0GR,2011-08-29T01:57Z,"How do I burn this download to disc so that Boot Camp recognises it as a ""Authentic Disc"".

I tried burning it as a data disc and as a ISO (Joilet), but both times Boot Camp (MAC) spits out the error that it's not an authentic disc. Should I name the disc differently?"
,Devon_Rouillard,2011-09-18T15:57Z,"works good.

i mounted the disc with poweriso and i will upgrade from windows vista"

You could try using a real operating system to begin with (i.e; something other than OS X). That should solve the problem."
,august0821,2011-10-20T11:50Z,"i have a laptop with a pre installed Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. If i use this version and do a clean install, can i use the cd key provided on the COA underneath my laptop to activate?"
,themasteronetwo,2011-10-21T06:35Z,"Waste of time & Dvd Don't Download it, Sucks!, Doesn't work for me"
,pumpkin420,2011-10-26T13:52Z,"@august0821
Yes, as long as the cd key on your laptop is a key for windows 7 home premium 64bit. It might work for 32bit and 64bit, not sure about that though."
,Ahoy_Metis,2011-10-30T22:39Z,"Don't waste your time. It's not bootable.

No viruses but what good is it when you need to boot from it... ID10t"
,WarDemon,2011-11-05T00:48Z,To all you idiots saying this isn't bootable: http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=11194
,unsu2,2011-12-27T04:02Z,Thank you very much! I highly recommend this torrent to everyone who already have their Product Key for their Windows 7 Home Premium x64. My hard drive on my laptop failed. I downloaded this windows and used my Key to activate it. It passed with flying colors.
