,JUMPhil,2011-08-21T23:05Z,"No. You can upload those in an extra torrent. Please just upload ONE file with ALL of HIS songs, just like the torrent name says, and everybody will be happy :)"
,JJDubstep,2011-08-30T01:54Z,"Sorry guys, I have a crazy amount of homework from school plus sports, so I'll try to get it out soon."
,Logical157,2011-08-30T03:14Z,Skrillex is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo good live! You should all go and see him if you have the opportunity! :)
,JJDubstep,2011-09-02T01:11Z,@KidChemic The track is pretty good man! If you wanna send me some songs I could make a torrent for you and anyone else that wants them.

,JJDubstep,2011-10-03T00:06Z,"@ffburger101
This is true, he's been pumping out lots of music lately, and this was about it when I compiled the files for the torrent:/"
,mynameisshu,2011-10-10T20:29Z,Theres things missing... more monsters n sprites n shit
,JJDubstep,2011-10-11T01:29Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6652041

Any files missing from this are gonna be here, unless I didn't have them, or I didn't want to put them in."
,Phatfish,2011-10-14T19:06Z,So the discography  with all his tracks inclusive all the remixes that he people have done for him but not any of the remixes he has done. Epic fail. So basically a bunch of this that isn't skrillex and missing out a bunch of shit that is....
,JJDubstep,2011-10-17T02:29Z,"@Phatfish
What the hell are you talking about? Do you understand what a remix is?"
,itswill,2011-10-20T17:29Z,"Dude, I'm stuck at 97.5. The fuck?"
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-10-21T02:54Z,"Thanks for this uploader, by the way, the reason that your comp wouldn't upload all of it may have been because you opened one of the files with itunes or whatever you use and it changed some of the data and thus the hash of the file was changed so you didn't technically have the full file that you put into the torrent any longer. 

To the people bitching, he provided a list of what it contains, and then you have the torrent file list, if don't act like you weren't aware of what you were downloading, and if you were you're dumbasses. If you don't like it then upload something better, he did a good job. "
,JJDubstep,2011-10-24T00:36Z,"@itswill

Hmm... I'm not sure what happened to yours. I just tested it and it downloaded fine for me."
,xdabearz,2011-12-05T02:27Z,I'm sorry people are giving you so much shit. It must suck to have someone spend there time to upload stuff for them for free.
,ASISMason759,2011-12-17T21:11Z,"Quite a few of these tracks are not by Skrillex, Simply just mash ups of Skrillex songs that other people have done. But i am glad you had a good copy of Cats Rats, That's the only reason i downloaded was for that and to see some of the tracks I hadn't heard of. So thanks, I have a total of 69 tracks if you include the directors cuts of some songs or different mixes. If you want them message me :)"
,spunkster,2011-12-31T17:25Z,"@JJDubstep - let me clarify. I believe what Phatfish was trying to say is that he's severely mentally retarded, and illiterate. "
,UnderworldDemon666,2012-01-04T04:43Z,"A little bit more organized torrent of his EP's, including Bangarang, at 320 kb/s quality https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6930492/Skrillex_Discography"
,Kasimur,2012-01-09T00:54Z,"Great torrent, keep it up! :D"
