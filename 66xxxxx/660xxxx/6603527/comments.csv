thanks"
,Kel163,2011-08-28T12:08Z,"Hello, beepr43!

French audio is with DVD-Music only. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get French with TV-music, so I just cut off French from the DVD's and make it English oriented only.

Also I have no traffic on my Media-Fire account and basically this service is f**ked me up when I bought their Pro membership, so I will not renew their account and Restored files will not store there forever too. Also, I need my bandwidth for my personal use except of seeding torrents where there are I'm always the only one seed, so if you want to download French DVD's, mail me to kel163  bk [d0t] ru."
,Kel163,2011-08-28T12:15Z,"There was an ""(at)"" symbol between ""kel163"" and ""bk"". Domain is ""ru"", so feel free to mail there questions about Restored Roswell or Roswell DVD's."
,thegr8luiz,2011-12-06T20:52Z,Thank you very much for your time and effort to share this with us.
,Kel163,2011-12-09T07:22Z,"thegr8luiz, you are welcome!

Damn, I have a nostalgia. Not only about Roswell itself, but about my work on Restoration. It's about a year without a month when I started all of this. :)"
