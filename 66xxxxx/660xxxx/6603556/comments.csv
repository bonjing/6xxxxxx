,sanriver,2011-08-15T21:08Z,this doesnt install right. tried in 2 different pc's
,hedans,2011-08-16T10:09Z,"If you are running Windows 7 64 bits like I am, and are getting error messages like ""MSVCR100.DLL missing""
when you launch Omnipage Pro 18, head over to the Microsoft Download Centre and look for the following:

Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 x86
Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 x64
Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable SP1 x86
Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable SP1 x64
Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable SP1 x86
Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable SP1 x64

These 6 files need to be installed.
The Omnipage installer is supposed to do it for you if they are not present, but maybe this one does not contain the MS packages.

Anyway, this solved the problem for me."

,Rocco9999,2011-08-25T20:16Z,Doesn't work on Windows XP. When you start the program it crashes. 
,csobsidian,2011-09-27T21:33Z,"Could not get this to work on Windows 7 x64 even after installing the required Microsoft C++ Runtime files. Instead of crashing and saying ""MSVCE100.dll Missing."" it now simply crashes with ""Omnipage has stopped working properly."" There is a crash notification in the event log naming the event as a kernel crash."
