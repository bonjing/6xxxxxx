[Notes]

A White Lotus traditionally represents a rebirth. Just like the beautiful
flower, Eyes Set To Kill has gone through a metamorphosis. After years of
being forced to conceal their aspirations, the Phoenix, Arizona-based
collective finally reveal their true identity on their upcoming fourth
studio album appropriately entitled White Lotus.
"It's a symbolic name," Alexia Rodriguez states. "We have a cle...ar mind
set, we have purity and we know exactly what we want to do with our music.
We know who we are and where we want to go, and so we wanted to use a white
lotus to symbolize how confident and focused we are. It's a leap for us
because we have a clearer vision of what we want."
