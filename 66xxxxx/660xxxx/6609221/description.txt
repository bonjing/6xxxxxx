Plot:Mrs. Jumbo, a veteran circus elephant, receives a baby from the stork.
 He soon becomes the laughing stock of the herd because of his jumbo-sized ears
 and is cruelly nicknamed "Dumbo". When Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper
 she is locked up as a mad elephant and Dumbo finds himself all alone,
 except for a self-appointed mentor-protector, Timothy Q. Mouse.
