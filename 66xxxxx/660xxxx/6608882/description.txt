Yvonne Elliman - Food Of Love - 1973

LP RIP ! ! ! 


Casserole me over.
More than one, less than five.
I want to make you laugh, I want to make you cry.
Muesli dreams.
I can't explain.
Sunshine.
Hawaii.
I don't know how to love him blues.
Moon struck one.
Happy ending.
Love's bringing me down.
