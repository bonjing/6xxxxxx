The Best Of Poison
20 Years Of Rock (2006)





In a decade fueled by party anthems and power ballads, Poison enjoyed a great amount of popularity, with only Bon Jovi and Def Leppard outselling them. While the group had a long string of pop-metal hits, they soon became just as renowned for their stage show, and continued to be a major attraction long after the '80s came to a close (bringing the commercial downfall of pop-metal with it). Meanwhile, frontman Bret Michaels reinvented himself as a reality TV star in 2007, and his involvement in several TV shows -- particularly Rock of Love, Celebrity Apprentice, and Life as I Know It -- helped maintain the band's popularity in concert.
