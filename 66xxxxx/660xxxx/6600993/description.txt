A Stolen Life -- A Memoir by Jaycee Dugard (Audiobook)


Description:

\"In the summer of 1991 I was a normal kid. I did normal
things. I had friends and a mother who loved me. I was just
like you. Until the day my life was stolen. For eighteen years
I was a prisoner. I was an object for someone to use and
abuse. For eighteen years I was not allowed to speak my
own name. I became a mother and was forced to be a
sister. For eighteen years I survived an impossible situation.
On August 26, 2009, I took my name back. My name is
Jaycee Lee Dugard. I don\'t think of myself as a victim. I
survived. A Stolen Life is my story in my own words, in my
own way, exactly as I remember it.\"
