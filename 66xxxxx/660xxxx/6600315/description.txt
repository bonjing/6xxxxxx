ALMS American Le Mans Series Race #5 of the 2011 Season

This is the "American Le Mans Series Mid Ohio Sports Car Challenge", held at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Raceway in Lexington on August 6, 2011. ALMS racing is unique in that there are four different classes of cars competing on the track at the same time.

This was supposed to be a 2 hour 45 minute race. With 40 minutes remaining it started to rain and most cars switched to rain tires. Unfortunately, the race ended under a red flag after a three-car incident sent the Flying Lizards' Patrick Long aquaplaning off the track and into a gravel trap during a heavy rain. All cars were directed into the pits with about 10 minutes left in the race because of standing water on the track which was making driving conditions treacherous.
