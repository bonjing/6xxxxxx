Band History:
A first demo, Morning in Atlantis was released in 2000. In 2001 they signed with TTS Media Music/Black Arrow Productions, and in 2002 their first album, Eternal Endless Infinity was released. 2003 saw a change in line-up, replacing Christian Stani with Mario Plank and Chris Kamper with Miro Holly. Now with Napalm Records, Visions of Atlantis released their second album Cast Away in 2004.
In late 2005 Nicole Bogner left the band due to commitments elsewhere. She was replaced by Melissa Ferlaak (formerly with Aesma Daeva) and Wolfgang Koch replaced Werner Fiedler. In 2006 Martin Harb, who already played with VoA on their tour in Mexico in 2003, replaced Miro Holly.
In May 2007, VoA released their 3rd album Trinity, mastered at Finnvox studios and recorded at Bavarian Dreamscape Studios[1]).
In September 2007, the band began their first North American tour with Epica.
On November 28, 2007, a message was posted on the official VoA website saying that Melissa Ferlaak and Wolfgang Koch had left the band, both citing personal reasons (Ferlaak and Koch were married in May 2008).[2]
Following this Visions of Atlantis announced a few days later that their ex guitarist, Werner Fiedler, had rejoined the band. They were advertising on their website the position for a female vocalist for several months, and on September 3, 2008, they finally announced that they had found a new female singer; however, her identity wasn\'t revealed until February 1, 2009, as the 20-year old Austrian soprano vocalist Joanna Nieniewska.[3] The band also posted that they were already working on their fourth studio album.
On July 29, 2009, VoA announced that because of health problems, Joanna Nieniewska is no longer in the band but will continue to support VoA behind the scenes. The band announced the replacement vocalist, Maxi Nil from Greece.
On December 3, 2010, VoA announced the new title of their 4th studio album Delta. It was released on February 25, 2011.
In April, 2011, the band posted on their official facebook page an update on a new recording.
On July 18, 2011, Bass player Mario Locher left the band citing crucial internal differences.
