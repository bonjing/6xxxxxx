,Mudstomper,2011-08-30T07:01Z,"Firstly the torrent gives me a warning saying there are files missing???

I ignored this warning and installed...seems to work?? But I cant get this to activate?

 I have tried running the again file which gives me the message corrupt or incompatible but opens at the serial request prompt and it does not help (sys info file not a keygen). Adding all zeros gets me past here but then it says no printerdriver file found and requests that I activate within 7 days.... I normally dont have any problems with this sort of thing but a little help here please?"

Got this in a 'home' edition with my new asus, highly recommend it over Adobe.
Torrent looks good so far, any issues will report back.
Thanks Anacondaz."

( I open the keygen and then minimize to my tool bar for ease.)  installed without a problem except it popped a window saying it couldn't find the printer driver, and when done it wanted me to register, I just clicked remind me in seven days.
Question, Should I register? Or will that mess things up?
Thanks again snake.....lol"
