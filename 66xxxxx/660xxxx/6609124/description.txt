    After a series of electrical storms disrupts the world, electrical       
    engineer Bruce Gordon develops a machine to trace the cause of the       
    disasters. He discovers that the source is in central Africa and,        
    backed by the nations of the world, sets out on an expedition. Bruce     
    learns that the disturbances emanate from an area called the Magnetic    
    Mountain. But unknown to our hero and his pal Jerry, the Magnetic        
    Mountain also contains a super-advanced secret city ruled by the         
    tyrannical scientific wizard named Zolok, who has unleashed the          
    electrical fury threatening civilization as part of his plan to          
    conquer the world. Zolok has under his control a brilliant inventor,     
    Manyus, Manyus' beautiful daughter Natcha and an army of giant           
    African slaves, who follow the dictates of a strongman, Appolyn, and     
    Gorza, a dwarf. Also in the mix are schemers Reynolds and Colton, who    
    plan to capture Manyus and thereby gain control of Zolok's army, and     
    a double-crossing fellow explorer named Butterfield. Can Bruce evade     
    Zolok's "destroying rays" and stop his dreams of world conquest?
