 You have to read what writes works 100% Thanks again..."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-08-17T09:56Z,"@arreone

Norton 2009 is outdated. Instead it's better to use Norton 2010 or 2011, which are available at my account.

,cubiche1827,2011-08-19T20:57Z,"I tried using it in XP, the problem is when I'm done copying over the .dat file and open TU it asks for a registration name and key, the name has some weird symbols in it, but the key part is empty and won't let me continue. Any idea what I might be doing wrong?"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-08-20T09:23Z,"@cubiche1827 

It's working for others, as confirmed here. Read the install notes once more."
,Venaboli,2011-09-01T18:00Z,"I read and followed install notes to the letter, I am getting same problem as cubiche1827 . I`m running windows 7 with U.A.C turned off. Any HELP would be very much appreciated."
,Venaboli,2011-09-02T19:42Z,"I have tried everything that a non coder can do.
Will not work.
Thnx anyway,"
,a4711x,2011-10-10T06:17Z,Don't waste your time. Does not work. Not even a serial in the download.
,herkules007,2011-10-18T19:29Z,Doesn't work anymore. The registration dialogue pops up every time you start the app with empty Registration key and some garbage in the User name field: (Vdeld?kb). Go buy the app.
,RafVne2,2011-11-13T19:50Z,"same problem here... running on Win7sp1 Ult.x64.
Before the installation I have totally disabled internet connection so theres no way it could have contacted ""mothership"" after that I did add host file addresses, and I did replace  the cracked file...
I guess there's some incompatibility issues..."
