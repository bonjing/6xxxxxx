,chang104,2011-12-03T02:07Z,"Help! I'm trying to watch this through my PS3 using PS3 Media Server but the movie lags when I am watching it with the subtitles on.  However, if I disable the subtitles in PS3 Media Server the movie shows perfectly, but without subtitles!  And I need the subtitles because I can't read Japanese.

Anyone knows what's wrong?  Thanks."
