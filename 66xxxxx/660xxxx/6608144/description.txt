After many delays we are FINALLY able to release this. The resolution on the 1080p one is a little weird but thatâ€™s because of the massive amount of cropping I had to apply to the blu-ray. Audio is 5.1ch FLAC on both releases, if you donâ€™t like then donâ€™t download.

EDIT(resolution explanation):

[21:18:59] (matt) the resolution is
[21:19:00] (matt) Width : 1 864 pixels
[21:19:00] (matt) Height : 1 048 pixels
[21:19:00] (matt) Display aspect ratio : 16:9
[21:19:14] (matt) thats because of the cropped black bars which are present in the whole movie
[21:19:19] (matt) normally
[21:19:26] (matt) there is a much smaller area that needs to be cropped
[21:19:34] (matt) so people just upsize it to 1920Ã—1080
[21:19:43] (matt) in this case itâ€™s much larger so i left it as is
