Think storage auctions are a joke?

Think again, because you don't want to mess with former boxer Brandon Bernier and his wife Lori, the fiercest competitors in a high-stakes sales game.

You won't believe what they find: from hidden bundles of cash to thousand-dollar chairs, from the dangerous to the downright weird.

With killer instinct, the Berniers target the best storage units in the country and go to extreme lengths to get their hands on what's stashed inside.

Follow them to the country's most competitive auctions as they risk a fortune to go head-to-head with hostile locals.

With so much cash at stake, it's always a dogfight to the bidder end.

Think this is all of season 1, but not entirely sure :)
