Release Notes:

Hacker Evolution Duality is the upcoming hacking simulation game
developed by exosyphen studios.

You are Brian Spencer. Your background is mostly classified and you
have done pretty much everything related to computer hacking and cyber
crime both on and off the record. But when you got involved in working
for the Xenti Corporation, things didnt go as planned. Your knowledge
and work was used to create Artificial Intelligence that can replace
human hackers. With the help of this technology, the Xenti Corporation
is one step away from controlling the entire internet, and virtually
every device that is connected to it. They can create as many hackers
as they want, with the click of a mouse, and have them perform
anything on their behalf. When you tried to stop this, they tried to
kill you.

You are on your own. Without any limits to what you can do. You have
to go back against them, and stop them if you can. Hack into
computers, steal money and get your hands on anything you can, and use
it to stop them.
