This book is definitely not for absolute beginners. Unlike the first edition of this book, which had a Beginner/Intermediate reader level, this edition has an Intermediate/Advanced reader level. Thatâ€™s not to say the book is for professional programmers or network administrators. Iâ€™m just assuming you already have some Windows experience, although not necessarily with Windows XP. Prior Windows 95, 98, ME, or 2000 experience is fine. You just need to be familiar with terms and concepts that havenâ€™t really changed in the last 15 or 20 years.
