It doesn't work like this.
You can download every update seperatly, but this is hard to do every month.
Choice is yours!

@d3nis
You're welcome.
You can use nLite to custumize it.
Search Google for more info.

You're welcome."

,tonyzzuli,2011-08-19T19:27Z,"@avani2007: If setup gave errors 2 missing file, possible you need to burn your new cd again. Sometimes, the burning software did not good, or your CD-rom could not read files from the disk for some reasons. Try it again mate.

,eyeshield.21,2011-08-20T00:48Z,"Wow, almost every month you upload the new one.

Btw, you said that we can turn on the automatic updates. So we don't need Daz Loader?

Amazing job, anyway."
[T],Maherz,2011-08-20T16:49Z,"@avani2007
You can use a USB driver.
But you need a tool like win2flash to make it bootable.

You're welcome.

This is Windows XP ;)"

,xxeroxx3,2011-08-24T07:37Z,"Maher,

Again, as I always say, you rule.

Question tho, why do you have Windows set to a fixed page file size? It should be set to system managed, but instead it's static.

I notice because I install this multiple times per month, and some computers almost freeze up because they run out of virtual memory.

Also, did I mention you rule?

And lastly, is there any reason (other than to save space) to leave out the repair option to fix existing XP installs? (Just wondering, I have other tools for that).

Thanks!!!! Oh yeah, you rock!"

,user417,2011-09-14T09:11Z,"@rms8
Google 'astroburn free' download it, install it, run it.  Once the program opens click on the image tab, on the top portion you should see a button to the right of a long textbox, click on it and find the .iso file that you downloaded from here.  Be sure you have a blank disk in your drive and then click accept to burn the .iso to your blank disk.  an .iso file is a virtual image of the disk, so basically you're making a physical copy of your virtual disk into a physical disk.  Hope this helps, also try searching online to help you in the future, google is your friend :-)"
