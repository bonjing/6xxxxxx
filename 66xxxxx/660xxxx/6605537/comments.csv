,n1nja0fthenight,2012-01-02T12:51Z,"The file (it is only one eleven-hour-long file) contains multiple glitches that are not incapacitating, but annoying nonetheless.  Otherwise, the sound is not bad."
,legna69,2012-01-29T18:44Z,"hope this works just great, the book 1 audio was flawless hope this too"
,nitrodave,2012-03-24T11:10Z,"this is great apart from the audio glitch-skipping, it does remove the immersion of the audio book. i look forward to another one being uploaded without the skip for when i want to listen to this for a second time"
,nitrodave,2012-03-25T06:25Z,"up to Chapter 6, and the skipping makes it unlistenable. you are still able to understand the story, but whole sentences start to get skipped"
,XAQZ_UK,2012-03-26T14:45Z,"The audio quality is horrendous, especially compared to the first book by the same uploader which was perfect."
,broken47,2012-04-30T05:39Z,"pinpirin and nitrodave are correct is saying there are glitches/skips. I'm only 1:04:00 into it so far. if you can find another copy elsewhere, i'd suggest using it. "
