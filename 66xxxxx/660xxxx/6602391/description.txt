Description

Default Folder X attaches a toolbar to the right side of the Open and Save dialogs in any OS X-native application. The toolbar gives you fast access to various folders and commands. You just click on the buttons to go to your favorite and recently used folders, manage the folders and files shown in the list, and make changes to your settings.

Default Folder also fixes a number of problems in Open and Save dialogs, â€œreboundingâ€ back to the last selected file, putting the path listing back in the top menu, and correcting bugs in scrolling column views.

Release Notes

July 22, 2011
Default Folder 4.4.3 corrects several important compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.7 Lion. We strongly recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

What's New:

Corrected a problem that could cause recent Carbon applications such as BBEdit 10 and Filemaker Pro 11 to crash on Lion.
Fixed problems with some Default Folder X windows not appearing in applications when they're running in full screen mode.

The installation dialog for Default Folder X's helper application now comes up in front so Default Folder X isn't waiting quietly for a password that you don't know you need to enter.
Known issues with Lion (yes, we're working on these):

You will be asked for your admin password the first time you turn on Default Folder X.

There are currently some issues with Lion's window handling, so Default Folder X cannot be run with its icon in the Dock. The "Put Default Folder X's icon and menus in the Dock" option will be automatically turned off in your preferences when you run Default Folder X under Lion.

Default Folder X doesn't work in Preview, TextEdit, or in Safari when uploading files or attaching files to email messages.
Contextual menus do not work in some file dialogs.

System Requirements:

Mac Intel OS 10.5+, Lion ready
