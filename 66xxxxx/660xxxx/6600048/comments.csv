Just wondering how come top and bottom of screen are cut off?  Like ""New Episode"" on the top is cut, and ""Nick Toons"" on the bottom.

I'm looking forward to the episode where they form Green Sentinel.  I'm not really a big fan of the fast transformation of Voltron.  This episodes robeast kinda reminds me of one of the early Power Rangers Megazords"
