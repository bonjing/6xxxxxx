Gary Lineker presents highlights from the day's six Premier League games, 
as the new season gets underway. Liverpool spent heavily during the summer, 
and their new signings will be eager to impress against Sunderland - 
particularly Jordan Henderson, who could make his Reds debut against the club 
he left just two months ago. Fellow midfielder Stewart Downing, 
who joined from Aston Villa, could also play his first competitive game for 
Kenny Dalglish's side. Arsenal take on Newcastle at St James' Park, 
scene of the Gunners' incredible collapse last season, when they surrendered a 
four-goal lead to draw 4-4. QPR return to the top flight after a 15-year absence, 
with Bolton providing the opposition at Loftus Road, while fellow newboys 
Norwich visit Wigan. Martin Jol's first Premier League match as Fulham boss is 
against an Aston Vila side also under new management, with Alex McLeish taking 
over at Villa Park this summer. Elsewhere, Blackburn host Wolves.

Tottenham v Everton was called off due to a load of dickheads in London.
