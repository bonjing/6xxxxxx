,CasperT1,2011-10-21T21:19Z,"yes one of the best I have seen whit a perfect bit-streaming audio over HDMI My Elite 94txh takes care of the decoding so it sounds like if I have the real bluray, but the problem I'm having or seeing is: the program sends  information to OVH-SAS Servers located in france, IP 91.121.143.139:80 . and using internal port 224xx, 225xx  & peerblock blocks the TCP as AP2P so be careful  they are watching what you see....."
