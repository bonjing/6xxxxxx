,stupidcorn,2011-09-24T05:45Z,you upload a lot of stuff that i download because it seems like it MIGHT be interesting to me. mostly i wind up tossing stuff after a couple listens. but every now and again there's something that really gets its hooks into me. this is one of those albums. BRILLIANT stuff. thanks so much for sharing!
