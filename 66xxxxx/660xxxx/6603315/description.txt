Boots Met My Face is an album of open-hearted, foot-stomping and beautifully precocious indie-rock love songs; all sung in a full bodied Scottish lilt. 

The album was recorded by Paul Savage, a hugely talented producer with an incredible ear, who is behind some of Scotland's finest acts including Franz Ferdinand, Idlewild and King Creosote. Savage was named 'British Producer of the Year' for 2010.

Notes Reviews Admiral Fallow were born out of a Glasgow based musical collective in 2006. A gathering of precocious talent fronted by the young foot-stamping, utterly captivativing singer-songwriter Louis Abbott. The band meld and indie-rock lineup with clarinet, flute, double bass and two jaw-dropping vocals to deliver their joyous, heart-filled, and beautifully eccentric and finely crafted songs. 

They are fiercely proud of their roots with Abbottâ€™s Scottish accent to the fore in his singing, contrasting magically with the Northumbrian tones of Sarah Hayes, the second vocalist. 

Their sets go from simple voice and guitar compositions, through stomping Wilco-esque tunes, to riotous cacophonies of bluring guitar; all sung with delightful abandon. 

"Intimate and epic â€¦ quite stunning" The Herald Scotland  

"An astounding first album" Music News  

"A lovely, well-crafted album" The Sunday Mail  

"Brooding, heartfelt folk leanings are bolstered by a soundtrack of colourful orchestration, including flute, strings and double bass - a rich concoction that has caught the attention of more than a few unsuspecting ears. Admiral Fallow are set to soundtrack our forthcoming festivals, fireworks and Hogmanays." The List  

"surely destined for a larger stage." Sunday Mail 

"They did not so much â€˜take to the stageâ€™ as colonise it and build a mini empire of sound for the awestruck concert goers ... surely one of the truest new talents in Scotland today." New Found Sound
