V/8
Best copy so far, all of the glare has been removed and the image is way more clearer now, but it does get slightly dark towards the end. The audio line is sorted and stays in sync throughout the movie, pictures slightly cropped now but beggars can't be choosers, Altogether this is a way better copy than the first CAM releases that where out at the begging of the week...very watchable copy and is certainly worth the download...
Many Thanx to froogie100 and IMAGiNE for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
