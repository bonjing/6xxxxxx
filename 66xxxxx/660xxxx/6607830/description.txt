Allmusic Review:
There are countless Beach Boys compilations on the market recycling the groupâ€™s catalog in different ways, and so strong was the bandâ€™s jubilant connection to the sun and summer -- and to the cars that made it all easily accessible, complete with a California soundtrack -- that even the least of these reissues will have a few songs that are great to hear again. This set, tantalizing brief at only ten tracks, manages to make every song one of those. Thereâ€™s a whole universe of time, place, and status contained in a Beach Boys suite that includes â€œWouldnâ€™t It Be Nice,â€ â€œGood Vibrations,â€ â€œI Get Around,â€ â€œGod Only Knows,â€ and â€œFun, Fun, Fun.â€ There are only ten songs here, but none of them misses. Thatâ€™s a plus.
