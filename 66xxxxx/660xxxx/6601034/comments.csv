More and more we (U.S. users) are seeing our own ISP's turn on us because they are being paid by the Movie/Music industry a reward for turning us in. If you want to block your ISP from knowing exactly what it is your are downloading via P2P, I suggest you subscribe to a service that literally disguises your ISP address on the Internet. To find such services go to Google, type in How do I disguise my IP address?  

When a copyright holder sees their video online, say at piratebay, they can also see your IP addres and they note it then contact your ISP and demand your name/address with the promise of a finder's fee.  In the U.S. your ISP is legally required to provide such information ONLY if presented with a court order - but they don't because money has more power then any court order.  So they privately provide your name and address to the Movie/Industry.  And the Movie/Music industry then sends your ISP a letter demanding immediate payment or closure of your account and your ISP sends you the letter acting as if they are shocked and surprised - when in fact, they have set you up.  

Last month Comcast sent out 200,000 such letters and they don't care if you (try) to close your account because you signed a contract for two years of service and they can sue for the full two years - and they know you can't go anywhere else but to AT&T for much slower service.  These two ISP services work in tandem.

You can protect yourself and make your P2P uploading and downloading completely anonymous and effectively block your ISP from knowing what it is you are doing on the Internet.  to begin with, what you do on the Internet is YOUR business and certainly not the business of your Internet Service Provider.  Their job is to provide the access, not to police it.

To hide your activity you can subscribe to a service that uses a proxy server.  In easy to understand language, you sign on with them and download their program.  It re-routes your Internet access through their servers.  The speed stays the same.  When the Movie/Industry demands your name/address from your ISP they can only provide the subscribed IP address which doesn't point to you at all.  When told by the Movie/Music Industry they can't identify you, your ISP can then block your fake IP address - so you want to sign up with a service that has thousands of IP addresses.  There are services that automatically detect any blocking and will automatically re-assign you a new IP address and that effectively keeps your down/upload working without interruption and at the fastest Internet speeds possible.

I hope this information helps.  I know it has helped me to be able to bring you this great upload and hopefully many more.  I am a strong believer in a free internet.  No company should have the right to block your access.  Comcast and AT&T have a monopoly on Internet Access which puts those customers in peril.  Contact your Congressperson and demand Comcast and AT&T be stopped from policing the Internet and their own customers.  Legally, they have no right to do so.	"
