,Isozyme,2011-08-29T18:53Z,"I really appreciate your effort dohduhdah, but is there an index for these photos or something?"
[V],dohduhdah,2011-08-30T16:10Z,Not that I know of... it's just a bunch of pictures sorted in a number of folders.
,Isozyme,2011-08-31T08:38Z,"ok, thanks"

,zyzykwy,2011-10-06T06:05Z,"I downloaded this when it first came out and just opened it to see the contents (I was sharing when I could all this time), but while the photos I could view are FANTASTIC, something very unfortunate seems to have happened to the folders in the archive ISO.  From mid way through folder 22 up to folder 99 the file size of the photos is there but nothing I have on my computer can view the images or even identify the file type (they are labled jpg).  I hope this didn't screw up anyone elses download of it, or maybe it might be my hard drive failing.  Anyone else have a problem like this, or should I just try to DL the whole thing again to a new drive and hope it turns out OK?"
[V],dohduhdah,2011-10-09T17:20Z,"yeah, download it again on a new drive.. I think the torrent is ok"
