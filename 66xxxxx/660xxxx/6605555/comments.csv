,ammes42,2012-03-26T05:17Z,Is there a way to get a copy with the files speterated by chapter?  
,j_10suited,2012-03-26T18:53Z,I am slightly confused. I tried download the Torrent with the magnet but it doesn't show anything. The files have been removed right? Or do I need to upgrade my antique Torrent client?
,j_10suited,2012-03-26T18:55Z,I am confused. I downloaded the file with Magnet link and all I get is an empty file. Does that mean the file have been removed? or do I need to upgrade my ancient torrent client?
,JensOwnz,2012-03-26T21:50Z,"@ j_10suited, you should go do right click  on you torrent and do open containing folder. Worked for me, they always replace themselves somehow.. (the files)"
