Colin Murray presents the first programme of the new Premier League season, 
with highlights of Stoke against Chelsea and West Brom v Manchester United. 
Chelsea's first game under new manager Andre Villas-Boas is an awkward trip to Stoke, 
who were last season's beaten FA Cup finalists. Villas-Boas arrived at Stamford Bridge 
after a hugely successful season with FC Porto, prompting inevitable comparisons 
with Jose Mourinho, who led the Blues to back-to-back Premier League titles. 
West Brom were the only visiting team to claim a league point at Old Trafford last season, 
but their home record against the Red Devils is less impressive - United have won their last 
seven league games at the Hawthorns. The reigning champions have bolstered their squad 
with the signings of Ashley Young, Phil Jones and David de Gea, and manager Sir Alex Ferguson 
will be hopeful of securing a fifth Premier League title in six seasons. There is also another 
chance see all the goals from yesterday's seven games.
