The Unofficial Guide: The Color Companion to Walt Disney World by Bob Sehlinger, Len Testa
Wiley | ISBN: 0470497742 | March 22, 2010 | 384 pages | PDF 


The Color Companion is perfect for pairing with The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World ("the big book") or it can stand alone to provide you with what you need to know in a flash when you're visiting the park. While the Unofficial Guide gives you more than 800 pages of highly detailed information on planning, staying and surviving your visit to Walt Disney World, The Color Companion also takes the "Unofficial" approach, but SHOWS you where you'll be staying and what you'll be doing -- in a trim 360-page book, perfect for tucking into a backpack or totebag.
