::Plot::
Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), an investigative journalist with the magazine Millennium, loses a libel case against industrialist Hans-Erik WennerstrÃ¶m (Stefan Sauk), and is sentenced to three months in prison. Blomkvist is under covert surveillance by Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a troubled but brilliant 24-year-old hacker from a security firm. She delivers her report on him to Dirch Frode (Ingvar Hirdwall), a lawyer for the powerful Vanger Group.

Blomkvist is then invited to a meeting with industrialist Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), who hires him to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, who vanished on Children's Day in 1966. Henrik not only believes that Harriet was murdered, but that a member of the Vanger family is responsible.
