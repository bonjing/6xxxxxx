Excellent Quality!

Additional Comments: 
This copy of the original Swedish Movie is beautifully dubbed in English! 

The subtitles are a bit off; however, you get the idea.  Great, actually EXCELLENT Job!

,Rudy_258,2011-12-29T19:11Z,720p for 757.97 MB? Something smells fishy here :\
,muddick,2011-12-30T05:48Z,Sample doesn't even show what the dubs are like. Why are people so moronic?
,oldcarman,2011-12-30T17:58Z,not sure I like this new format....not a lover of change

,Deminted4eveR,2011-12-31T04:29Z,"REALLY!?!?!?

WHAT IS WITH ALL THIS ENGLISH DUBBED SHIT???

I JUST WENT AND SAW THE NEW ENGLISH VERSION.. I WANNA SEE THE ""ORIGINAL"" ONE WITH ENGLISH SUBS HARDCODED

GOD PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE FUCKING LAZY FUCKS!!! (NOT ME THOUGH)"
,majalogan,2012-01-02T04:21Z,"PLEASE SOMEONE DO A PROPER RIP OF THE MILLENNIUM TRILOGY!

There are a million rips of these movies out. Not ONE of them is good. 

We need:
- extended versions
- original Swedish language with English subs
- high definition bluray source

For some reason no-one has done a proper release of these great three movies (Girl with dragoon tattoo is the first out of three) ....

,srfc,2012-01-08T03:53Z,Great Quality:) I  thought all good quality videos were big sized ones but no this is small enough and great:) thanks so much
,digimike50,2012-01-08T11:52Z,Many thanks!
,nhatdog,2012-01-08T11:58Z,not the Hollywood version!
,ProphetZarquon,2012-01-09T21:37Z,Sooo...  This clearly isn't 720p.  The description even says it's 1280x544.
,Solice82,2012-01-11T02:35Z,"@Deminted4ever and majalogan;

Why the fuck are you complaining about it not being Swedish? you ARE looking at the title right?

If you want the original Swedish one, then why aren't you looking over there?

Search for ""Man som hatar kvinnor"" and stop whining about it not being swedish. Also, please deactivate your piratebay accounts and never post here again."
,_Wintermute_,2012-01-11T18:59Z,"Yes, as the info states: This is a dubbed version of the original Swedish movie from 2009.

Still, 756 MB for a full length 720p movie means very low video bitrate. Also note the sound is 2 ch stereo in low bitrate.

The better solution for those of you who wants the original Swedish version in 720p and DTS has to be this proper Bluray rip:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5065340/Man.Som.Hatar.Kvinnor.2009.SWEDISH.720p.BluRay.x264-SMOKEY

With Danish subs... but English subs can be found e.g. here:

,evazap99,2012-01-12T03:37Z,"@Solice82 sigh .... Happy New Year, hopefully 2012 will be a better year for you than previous ones have evidently been. "
,ProphetZarquon,2012-01-12T21:20Z,"SO!  Finally watched this copy.
As stated in the description, this is -=*NOT 720p*=-.
2.35:1 ratio pushed to 1280 results in 544 scan lines, much lower than 720p.

Video looks great!  GREAT!
The Dub is a dub, well done, not annoying, great for distracted viewing.
The Subs are custom by AliBaloch, they do not precisely match the dubbed dialog at all times, but work very well.

This is the best English language rip I have found below 1.4gb.  (The CAM release with an aXXo label is WAYyy below the standards he held when he was posting)

V:9 (""digital moss"" on shaded walls)
A:8.5 (low bitrate stereo feed, carefully leveled -
Thanks!  That's exactly what I want at this file size. -
stereo feeds are helpful for quiet listening)"
,emanater,2012-01-14T12:58Z,THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE WITH DANIEL CRAIG. THIS MOVIE IS WITH ONLY SWEDISH ACTORS
,DiamondD22,2012-01-14T21:34Z,Why would anyone who doesnt understand swedish want to watch the original version of this? Makes zero sense. Quit your complaining.
,bl3ck-dust,2012-01-15T13:25Z,"in every torrent u see people keep complaining , i hate this .. i want .. omg why is this like this ..

this guys is working hard to upload us great movies and u are sitting in your ass waiting for things to come to you , and yet you don't say thanks .. u love to be the lazy turkey who complain on everything . if u hate what he is doing why don't YOU! get off and upload something ?

,Zoraster,2012-02-08T08:46Z,"This version is a far better version than the American 2011 copy cat.  The latter is just a re-hash.  Anyone with a brain will watch this one without hesitation!  Thanks, uploader!"
,pennknig,2012-02-13T10:59Z,"@ adrian17cy 

You Dumb Fucktard, use VLC Media Player and turn the Subs OFF!"
