In Julie Taymorâ€™s version of â€˜The Tempest,â€™ the main character is now a woman named Prospera. Going back to the 16th or 17th century, women practicing the magical arts of alchemy were often convicted of witchcraft. In Taymorâ€™s version, Prospera is usurped by her brother and sent off with her four-year daughter on a ship. She ends up on an island; itâ€™s a tabula rasa: no society, so the mother figure becomes a father figure to Miranda. This leads to the power struggle and balance between Caliban and Prospera; a struggle not about brawn, but about intellect.
