[T],jmb2012,2011-08-16T04:39Z,"First off thanks for the work you put in! 

I have a question, I'm new to Mac and I've been trying to find a good easy way to burn downloaded movies to DVD's so they can play on any dvd player.
Any Ideas? I tried IDVD, either I'm doing something wrong or it just wont work. PLZ help"
,bigmamajay,2011-08-17T06:02Z,@jmb2012 - Get a copy of Toast Titanium 9 or higher. I've never had a problem with it. I prefer 9 because the DivX encoding is built in.
[V],polisdavid,2011-08-17T06:03Z,"jmb2012,

Try Mac DVD Ripper Pro (search it on tpb). It rips a DVD into VIDEO_TS File which you can then burn it easily with Toast.

If you don't have Toast it's a must on a MAC. Search it of tpb, and you'll find the latest release

Good luck

thnx for the tip "
