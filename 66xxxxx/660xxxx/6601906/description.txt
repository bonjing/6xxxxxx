First, the obvious: the iPhone rocks. Less obviously, so does the iPod touchâ€”no phone,no cellular network (and the associated monthly fee), just a wonderful game-playing,application-downloading, insanely great Cocoa touch machine. Consumers love them both for their stability, ever-present network access, ineffable coolness, and (as we developers know firsthand) all of those great third-party apps.
Appleâ€™s App Store rocks, too, and as the owners of these devices have made it clear, games rock the most! The Wall Street Journal reported data from Mobclix showing that over a quarter
of the applications in Appleâ€™s App Store are games (see http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/03/23/no-recession-for-iphone-game-apps/). Venture capitalists are getting in on the action as well, financing game developer Ngmoco to the tune of $10 million. There has even been a conference devoted to gaming on the iPhone (see http://www.igsummit.com/).
Think of this book as a guide and companion through your personal journey of game
development for the iPhone and iPod touch. And like any good travel guide, itâ€™s full of tips, highlights, and invaluable suggestions for avoiding the costly and time-consuming mistakes of the early explorers who have gone before you.
But the life of the game developer is not all fun and, well, games, so thereâ€™s more. After all,games development requires knowledge of the same basic coding and language skills as any form of app development. So weâ€™ve loaded the book with code you can reuse as building blocks for your own apps. Even those developers who donâ€™t have game development as their highest priority will find a lot of solid information here for use in their applications.
