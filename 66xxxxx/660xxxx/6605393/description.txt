There is no choice for posting either Czech audio or subtitles in the above box, so please read here:

There are English subtitles for the main film only.  Some of the extras (as well as the main film) do include Czech subtitles.  There is also an audio described soundtrack (in Czech). There are bits of English and Japanese, the former unsubtitled, the latter subtitled. I haven't checked the thoroughness of the Czech subtitles. There is no English only Audio track.

This is a series of connected and disconnected stories. Quite a fun flick with plenty of odd humor.  A debate over the lack of obscenity in the Japanese language, with some insight into why it is a relief to vent steam in this way. A man with a fetish for pulling buttons from furniture. And, for me, the highlight, a story clearly inspired, but uncredited, by the Kurt Vonnegut short story "The Big Space Fuck". A ghost story about the bomber pilot from Hiroshima. And some more with a make-up artist moonlighting as a taxi driver.

Thanks to the original uploader.
