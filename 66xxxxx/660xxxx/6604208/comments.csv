,ninline,2011-12-17T19:05Z,Excellent.  Superb!  This shows so much of the history of the revolution.  I especially enjoyed how it showed the personalities of the founding fathers and how their jealousies and antipathy for rivals as well as their intense passions all played into building the country that followed.  I could hardly wait to watch each episode.  Great.
