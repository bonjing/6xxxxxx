Review:
Charles Halcomb, Wichita State University: "This book continues a strong tradition of organization which facilitates learning and understanding. . . I haven't seen any book that I consider to be its equal. . . . It serves as a gold standard for introductory level statistics books. I particularly like the inclusion in this edition of the introductory section and the summary at the end of the chapter. The review questions included in the new 5th edition are excellent [â€¦] a substantial improvement over the current 4th edition"

Joan Michael, North Carolina State University: "I would consider the Kirk text to be superior to other texts which I have considered for adoption. I really appreciate the thoroughness of coverage."
