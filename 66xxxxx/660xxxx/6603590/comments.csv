""How To Use:

Burn the image using the software you like at a slow speed 
say about x4 or x8""

,TestSmith,2011-11-26T20:34Z,The disc wont boot up for installation. I have the settings for the cdrom to boot first in the bios. Also my cd burner cd xpburner will only burn from the speed six i cant have any lower speed. I don't know if this has something to do with it not booting up. Also do you burn it as a iso or data. Thanks.
[T],liluser,2012-04-24T20:06Z,"@ TestSmith  you burn it as a iso image
if you was to use imgburn which is freeware..
write image file to disk ..
