Stuart Little 1999 BRRip 720p H264-3Li

SUMMARY:
When the Littles go to an orphanage to adopt a new family member, 
their son, George, insists on a little brother as opposed to a big one. 
His request is honored more literally than he ever imagined when a 
charming young mouse named Stuart is chosen. While George is disappointed 
and initially unwelcoming to his new brother, the family cat, Snowbell, 
is even less enthusiastic at the prospect of having a mouse as his 
"master" and plots to get rid of him. Against these difficulties, 
Stuart resolves to face them with as much pluck, love and courage 
as he can muster. In doing so, he shows his beloved new family that 
great things can truly come in small packages.

SUMMARY:
Stuart's mother is being over-protective of him, especially when he 
narrowly escapes injury in a soccer game. His big brother George has 
also made a new friend, Will, so Stuart is feeing lonely. Stuart rescues 
a canary, Margalo, from a falcon; she moves in with the Littles. One day, 
Margalo is nowhere to be found, so Stuart and Snowbell set out across 
the city to find her while George covers for Stuart 
(the first time he's had to lie).
