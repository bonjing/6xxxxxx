     I just stumbled across your site--what a treat...used to follow Rhodes, and 2 of my other few heros : Garafalo and Maddows. Any chance at all you can use these inter-tubes to post Maddow's MSNBC show? I can't find it anywhere....
      As newbie I'm curious---how long does it take you to get it here for download?

Thanks again,

I usually just upload Thom and Randi with an occasional malloy or schultz. I wish Garofalo did a radio show. I'd definitely listen everyday. I got a chance to hear her a few times with Seder. I remember she had a great wit and intelligence about her. It's just too bad...I don't think she wants to do radio again though. Maddow was also good and very insightful when she did radio. But yeah.. I would love a Garofalo radio show."
