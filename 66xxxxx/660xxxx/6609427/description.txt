So, today is the day that Simplicity Linux 11.7 is released! Weâ€™re releasing 4 Editions this time. For those who are new to Simplicity Linux, or those who are just a bit confused about what to download, here is a quick guide to what is what!

Simplicity Linux Media Edition 11.7
Media Edition is a release we are really excited about. After seeing Google TV at Google IO this year, we decided to see what we could do with Simplicity and itâ€™s Puppy Linux base. The result is Simplicity Linux Media Edition. Itâ€™s still a little rough around the edges, but it gets the job done. We actually have an old laptop connected to a 22â€³ monitor in the office which runs Media Edition for watching movies and listening to music. Combined with a wireless keyboard and mouse, Media Edition could make an old computer into a great lounge computer.
