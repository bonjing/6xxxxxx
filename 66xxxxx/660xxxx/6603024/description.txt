Encoder Notes: Ok this is just a re-encode of imagines rip (The video is missing a few seconds in a few scenes, 2 seconds at 51:50,9 seconds or so missing at 1:06:56, and finally about 8 seconds missing at 1:08:15), the source isnt the greatest ive ever worked with but all good, so i just run a few basic filters on the video as best i could get it and it looks much crisper/cleaner/better than the rest of the encodes out of this film, and looks decent on a 28in tv too, take it or leave it, Enjoy Another Fine Kingdom Release. ;)
