The Squeeze is a 1977 British gangster thriller, directed by Michael Apted, based on a novel by Bill James (under the pseudonym, "David Craig"). The screenplay was written by Minder creator Leon Griffiths.

Largely neglected, this production headlines a major cast made up of American actor Stacy Keach, and British actors Edward Fox and David Hemmings. Irish actor Stephen Boyd was also featured in a major role as a gangster.

The Squeeze is now considered a forgotten crime masterpiece that usually gets mentioned in books on British cinema of the 70's but usually gets overlooked in the light of Get Carter (1971) & The Long Good Friday (1981).

The film also includes many location shots of the Ladbroke Grove area of London.
