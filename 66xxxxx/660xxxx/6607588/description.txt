Liberation is an epic five-part film series considered the most large-scale World War II film ever made in the Soviet Union. Filmed from 1968 to 1971, the first part was released during 1970 for the 25th anniversary of Victory Day. The series was a Soviet-Polish-East German-Italian-Yugoslavian co-production (by the studios Mosfilm, ZF-Start/PRF-ZF, Deutsche Film AG, Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica and Avala Film, respectively). It was directed by Yuri Ozerov. The script was written by Yuri Bondarev and Oscar Kurganov.

The films are a dramatized account of the liberation of the Soviet Union's territory and the subsequent defeat of Nazi Germany in the Great Patriotic War, focusing on five major Eastern Front campaigns: the Battle of Kursk, the Lower Dnieper Offensive, Operation Bagration, the Vistula-Oder Offensive and the Battle of Berlin.
