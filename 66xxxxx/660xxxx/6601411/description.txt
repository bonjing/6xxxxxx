Kelly Slater and the Young Guns, who are Quiksilverâ€™s hottest young surfers, have come out with three surf movies in the past five years, all demonstrating some of the most progressive surfing of their time. From 2004 to 2007 three films were produced under the Young Guns name. The line up of surfers changed a little from film to film, as older surfers moved on and the newest Young Guns were added. They surf epic waves in perfect conditions, and show what the worlds best are capable of.

Young Guns 1 takes place in Indonesia, as Kelly Slater and the Young Guns travel aboard the Komodo in search of the best waves. The surfing in this movie consists mostly of powerful turns and deep barrels in perfect Indonesian surf. Jeremy Flores really shines as being one of the most talented surfers on the trip, as well as the youngest.

In Young Guns 2, Kelly Slater and the Young Guns take to Indonesia again, this time with more equipment to create an even better surf movie. They travel aboard the luxurious Indies Trader with two jet-skis and a helicopter. The helicopter was able to scout out the best spots ahead of time each day and capture amazing footage of the young surfers from above. I donâ€™t know that there is any other surf movie that can match Young Guns 2 for stunning camera angles. Dane Reynolds really performs well in this movie, getting one of the deepest backside barrels of his life.
