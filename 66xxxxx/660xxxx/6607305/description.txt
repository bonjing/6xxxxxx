Allmusic Review:
Generating an attitude and a look that were perfect for the Golden Age of MTV in the 1980s, Pat Benatar showed once and for all that women were more than capable of pulling off a big arena rock show, and with powerful hit anthems like â€œHit Me with Your Best Shotâ€ and â€œLove Is a Battlefield,â€ she projected a kind of tough emotional honesty as well. This brief set -- only ten tracks -- is honed down to the very bones of things, but thereâ€™s no filler to get in the way. Her biggest tracks are all here.
