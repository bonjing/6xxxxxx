This is a real classic. It probably is THE heist movie. It has been re-done and many elements have copied from it in the decades past. If you like elaborate heist movie then you will love this one. Don't be put off by its age....

Synopsis:

After retirement, Professor James Anders presents criminal Mark Milford an elaborate plan to rob a diamond company in Brazil with a crew of professionals. The men assemble in Rio de Janeiro and run in to an unanticipated problem: a new alarm system called Grand Slam 70.


I have found this one on myduckisdead.com. and I decided to share this with the torrent community. It probably won't be a very popular torrent. So please stick around and keep this torrent alive.
