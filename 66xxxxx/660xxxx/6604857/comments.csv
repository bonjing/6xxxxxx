,Balthazar7,2011-08-15T16:02Z,"Thank-you Lux,
another fantastic XP!"
,azmoth2,2011-08-16T18:37Z,"Another great release. Why not utilize the extra 50mb space and add more features/or maybe even keep one or two removed Microsoft programs to make it a nice round 700mb as most of us burn it to 700mb disc anyway?  
Thanks LuxLOL"
,denniscu,2011-08-17T02:59Z,"LuxLOL, any chance for a windows 7 version???"
,ciul90,2011-08-18T12:24Z,"LuxLOL :
 for some time ive used your editions. It is great but i need to ask for your advice: what have you used to make it pass WGA and stuff? Ive got a system with sp3 that needs it badly :("
,Lokhart,2011-08-18T16:02Z,@LuxLOL is it possible for you to make the same edition but with the need to insert our own serial key ?
,extremest,2011-08-27T15:43Z,"sir, tnx for evreting... this site can help me more..."
,norbird88,2011-09-04T02:08Z,"LuxLOL. I tried to make a bootable usb with your iso and installed black edition from that usb. But the extra program didn't started and i had the xp ""minimal"" edition. So can i make a good installation from usb, or i must burn a cd ?"
,McLeech,2011-09-04T03:04Z,"@ Lokhart, you can insert your own serial key after install using directions in the readme or in uploaders original comments"
,amigo2008,2011-09-06T04:19Z,"many many thanx for this great upload. btw, can you please  include windows movie maker in your next update of this windows black or at least tell me a good alternative for windows movie maker. also can you please add at least 2 or 3 of some of the most coolest themes out there for xp esp the glass theme without installing windowblinds. "
,Chrisga55,2011-09-09T05:06Z,"My laptop keeps giving me an error code of ntdlr missing... Tried to just reinstall XP but it won't let me do that or repair... with repair It says I have to have a disk.... By any chance do you have that?  I won't even go into the ""blue screen of death"" that my dang desktop keeps giving me... lol
Thanks!"
,azmoth2,2011-09-16T17:11Z,"Make sure you extract the zip file and then open with nero to burn as image or the xp system will not be read in booting up from it s I wrongly did. the file is 682mb extracted so assuming LuXLOL kept movie maker etc that is little mb's to play with, that said user potentially can go to around 712mb using overerburn to enhance features still eg keeping useful xp movie maker? I added the free excellent Windows media bonus xp pack to update/enhance these system features. still available to download I think."
,LuxLOL,2011-09-16T21:38Z,Windows XP Movie Maker was removed because it got replaced by Microsoft with the Windows Live Movie Maker that can be downlaoded for free over the Microsoft Website.
