Grace Potter

Formed at upstate New Yorkâ€™s St. Lawrence University, based in Vermont, Grace Potter & the Nocturnals have received numerous critical accolades, including being named One of the Best Bands of 2010 by Rolling Stone magazine.

The groupâ€™s self-titled album, their third major label release, produced by Mark Batson [Dave Matthews Band], featured the hit single â€œParis (Ooh La La),â€ and debuted in the Top 20 on Billboardâ€™s Top 200, reaching #1 on the iTunes Rock Album chart. GPN, known for playing over 200 shows a year, have built a loyal, dedicated fan base across the U.S. from their incendiary live concerts.

Potter recently made a special solo appearance at Los Angelesâ€™s famed Hollywood Bowl, performing with Stevie Wonder, Sharon Jones and Janelle MonÃ¡e, among others. This summer, GPN made their debut on Bonnarooâ€™s main stage as well as at this yearâ€™s Lollapolooza festival in Chicago. The band will promote their first-ever Grand Point North Festival in Burlington, VT, on Aug. 13-14, then cap it all with a headlining show in New Yorkâ€™s Central Park Sept. 24.

The N.Y. Post called a recent GPN live show â€œâ€¦a sizzling concertâ€¦ the performance was a gripping moment in music where a girl and her band (whoâ€™ve enjoyed critical and cult admiration) showed they could hold their own with the biggest acts in music.â€

"Playing in Daryl Hall's living room is like stepping into a rock and roll time machine,â€ raved Grace. â€œAnd then they feed you, which is awesome. Daryl went above and beyond to make us feel welcome; even satiating my eternal thirst for old guitars and good wine. He's a class act.â€

GPN joined Daryl to perform five songs from their self-titled release, including the serrated rock â€œParis (Ooh La La),â€ which they performed recently on VH1â€™s Divas telecast, along with â€œMoney,â€ â€œGoodbye Kiss,â€ â€œLow Roadâ€ and â€œThings I Never Needed.â€

Hall and the band also collaborated on â€œRoom to Breathe,â€ a 1976 classic written by Daryl, which appeared on the Bigger Than the Both of Us album.

Says Daryl: â€œGrace and the Nocturnals have the kind of classic-rock influences--including The Band, Little Feat, JJ Cale, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and Bob Dylanâ€”that are very familiar to me, having experienced that era. We had a great time playing together.â€
