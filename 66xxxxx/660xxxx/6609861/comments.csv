,tdk2008,2011-08-17T18:59Z,some prob with the upload
,tdk2008,2011-08-17T19:11Z,50 pages are missing.
[T],dynstab2,2011-08-18T01:14Z,@tdk2008  Range or (some) numbers of missing pages? I assume you read the WARNING in the description above or on page 2 of the PDF file. I checked each and every bookmark before uploading and everything looked OK. Maybe pages between bookmarks... TIA
,tdk2008,2011-08-18T20:05Z,"Yeah, probably. Some pages are surely missing."
,tdk2008,2011-08-18T20:08Z,Could you please upload it again?
[T],dynstab2,2011-08-18T22:02Z,"I asked you to provide the numbers of a few missing pages and cautioned you not to use Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat to read the file. Any update on this? With 500+ downloads so far and its fingerprints all over the torrent world, I will (try to) fix and reupload the file if and only if I can ascertain there's something wrong with it in readers _other_ than from Adobe (Uploaded file tested OK in PDF-Xchange Viewer, stand alone, no plug-in). I tried to repair this complex Wiley PDF for Adobe products but quickly realised it would take much, much more time than for a Cengage Learning file, time I don't have."
,tdk2008,2011-08-21T06:08Z,ok man. I will download PDF Xchange  viewer. Thanks for the help. No offense.
,cintdrix,2011-09-15T23:02Z,Thanks for the upload. You are doing god's work my friend.
[T],dynstab2,2012-02-14T23:27Z,UPDATE:  Solution manual available on Demonoid at [TPB refuses to post the link so you go there on your own].  Don't forget to say thanks to the guy who probably paid for it.
