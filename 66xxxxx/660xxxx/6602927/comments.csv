,theone25,2011-08-22T09:27Z,why do ppl use imageshack? how are we supposed to view these screens?
,2b2o,2011-08-22T15:36Z,"@theone25
Agreed on not using imageshack- does imgur block? You can either turn off referrals or copy and paste the links into a new tab.

,DarthPS3,2011-09-05T21:23Z,"I don't know how to change the format to .mp4, can someone help me?"
,LostNky78,2011-09-11T09:18Z,"DarthPS3 - I'm guessing you have a windows based Pc. So, from ""My Computer"" choose ""Tools"" then ""Folder Options"" Then to the ""View"" tab. Make sure ""Hide extensions for known file types"" is not checked. Then go to the vid file and simply rename the file extension to .mp4"
