Ok, I got all this from: 
http://www.hackstor.biz/2010/04/navigon-mobilenavigator-15-ipa.html

I did all the work myself.  I first tried to use Winzip, but it made an improper IPA when I tried to install it.  I then used Powerarchiver to edit the IPA, and that worked.

So basically, you only have to a couple things:
Install the IPA (I use iphone explorer).

From that site:
"Do not launch the installed application yet! Use your preffered tool to access your device and go to /var/mobile/Applications.../NAVIGON/Library/Preferences. Put the .plist file there.
Use iFile and make sure the owner and group of the .plist are both set to mobile."

Basically, after you install the IPA, don't run it.  Put that plist file I included into the folder as described above.  Once you do that, you can then run the app.
Don't forget to copy your recent/favorites from your old Navigon from the Documents folder back in, like I did.

This works great.

This is my very first torrent (not leeching for once).  If I did something wrong or whatever, let me know.  I'm only doing this because TPB didn't have 1.8.2, so I wanted to allow other people to have 1.8.2. without having to do all the bullshit work I did to put the IPA together.
