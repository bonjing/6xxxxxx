Hopefully this can be a popular torrent.  I'm about to take my GF out using it with the Panorama 3D view... so fully tested and working. :)"
,Atheism,2011-08-13T22:34Z,"Oh, I'm sorry I didn't put it in, but this is only the North America one.  Shit!  I'm sorry..."
,drewb0y,2011-08-16T16:43Z,"Thanks for this. I have seen several versions floating around, but it's definitely nice to have one already put together."
,Atheism,2011-08-16T22:42Z,"Yea, I hate putting chairs and desks together - software is not much different. :)"
,Atheism,2011-08-16T22:43Z,"I realize I made a mistake of not making an .nfo file. If this torrent goes up on other sites, they won't know what to do with the plist file. :("
,drewb0y,2011-08-18T15:18Z,"Works perfectly. I used ifunbox to install, copied plist file and it just works!

Thanks a lot!"
,Atheism,2011-08-18T23:12Z,"Welcome.. glad it worked good. Next time I'll make an nfo file, because I have a feeling other sites are hosting this torrent, and people won't know what to do with the plist so they'll only have regular 1.8.2, but oh well.. TPB is really the most important to me. :D"
,Atheism,2011-08-18T23:14Z,"By the way, people.. if you have Installous installed, you can use a file explorer and just simply drop the ipa into private/var/mobile/Documents/Installous/downloads ...then open iphone, open installous, make sure the download is refreshed, and then boom, install is done... just do the plist file after that."
,jtrivedi2002,2011-08-23T02:59Z,"One heck of a work! Thanks bud! saved my lot of time to manually add maps! 

and, I am assuming, it will work offline, too [I meant without data plan] as the maps are already included in it...

i am asking cuz there r some places, where you wont get network or data..you know

p.s. i have 6 gig data per month on my iphone 4, but dont want to use it in this navigator thing unless and until it is absolutely necessary! "
,Atheism,2011-08-31T06:37Z,"Yea bud, GPS always works offline.. yup, already maps downloaded. You don't have to d/l more maps in order to use it.. although updates would be good... but you can get that just by updating the navigon version when it's time next time."
,ScorpioPirate,2011-09-06T13:17Z,"Hi... Just a' fine work you have doing here :-)
Hope you will stay with this work in future :-)

Regards: ""from"" Denmark... :-)"
,ScorpioPirate,2011-09-06T13:20Z,"ohhhh. one more wish :-)

can you make this in EU maps to??

Thanks in forward.. :-)"
,NamelesSoul,2011-09-23T06:10Z,"Registered just to thank you!
Spent hours yesterday with a bunch of files for Navigon but couldn't figure out what the hell to do from there.
This one is so easy even a cave man can do it, lol.
Thanks again!"
,af21187,2011-10-22T21:10Z,"Thanks, however I transferred the file to the Installous directory for install, and Installou scrashes everytime I try to install the file. This is on iOS5. All other comments appear to be pre-iOS5."
,af21187,2011-10-22T21:42Z,"Okay, I installed iFunBox, and that has to be the greatest program ever. It installed through iFunBox, and used the same program to copy the plif file. Thanks, uploader."
,mojobaby27,2011-10-28T17:54Z,"Thanks to uploader Atheism, and af21187 for info on funbox, works great. I tried and failed with installus and iphone exlorer, but funbox worked great and allowed me to copy the ipa on iphone ios 5.0. thanks again"
