V-9.5
A-9.5

My only quibble is that this is a MKV file and would be more useful converted and compressed to a smaller AVI file.

Thanks for the upload, it's much appreciated."

,machloop,2011-08-16T11:26Z,"Again thanks Sceneline, this file is great quality but many will not download a 3GB file just to watch it on a netbook.  If you could post a 700MB version as well you could capture both markets.
