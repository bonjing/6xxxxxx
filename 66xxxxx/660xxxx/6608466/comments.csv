,mister_yuck,2012-02-06T16:44Z,"dude this shit is sick. I've never heard of this band until about a day ago. This is fantastic. i love the circus-y souly stuff with all the other instrumentation. No clue how i've missed out on this. If you have more music that is comparable to this pls put it up and let me know?

thx"
