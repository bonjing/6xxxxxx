[T],Tyr3ll,2011-08-22T03:20Z,"could you please develop a little bit more so ?
Not a virus at all !!!
if you get a problem to install it,then please,try to explain us which one !
might be a possible bug or can be due by the fact you don't made a reset of your cache also.
Is vlc-cache-gen.exe your problem ?
What os do you use ? Which video card and what
about your drivers ?
