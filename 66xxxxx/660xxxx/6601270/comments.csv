jlitgow,
    That was quite the engineering task, developing that vehicle in the mid 60's when liquid fuel rocket technology was but 25y old. Something like 190 million horsepower. The Moon Machines series (part 1-6) is really good. TPB search did not find it but here is one of them on BTjunkie-key word moon machine. All are available

I'm hoping you have a venerable library of these old Nova's which you're yet to upload.
