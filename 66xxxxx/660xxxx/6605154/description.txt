Firefox 6 officially releases on August 16th, but technology blog TechnoBolt discovered last night that Firefox 6 final version is already available for download for Windows, Mac, and Linux on Mozilla's FTP servers.
The new version uses the same user interface as Firefox 5, but is reported to run 20% faster.
