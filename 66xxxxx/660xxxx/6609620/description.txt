For more than a half-century, the United States and its leaders have been pursuing a grand imperial strategy with the aim of dominating and controlling international politics. Our elected leaders have been willing to follow the dream of dominance regardless of the cost. In War Crimes & Imperial Fantasies, Noam Chomsky talks to Alternative Radio's David Barsamian in Chomsky's MIT office about the history of the United State's perusal of imperialism and the crimes against humanity committed along the way.

Is George W. Bush and international criminal and is his war in Iraq an egregious criminal act? In this thorough, in-depth two-disc interview, Noam Chomsky (commonly referred to as "the conscience of the American people") carefully places Bush into a historical perspective, explaining Bush's actions in relation to past U.S. presidents and how the war in Iraq is in blatant disregard of the findings of the Nuremberg Tribunal. In this exposing interview, Chomsky recounts America's history of aggressive war, war crimes and murder while placing George Bush's Iraq invasion and occupancy into context. Just in time for Election Day, War Crimes & Imperial Fantasies is an exercise in American honesty and objective, factual criticism.
