I have had this book for many, many years and love the flexibility of the mix and match approach. When pressed for a quick and easy meal and no time to shop, I use this book and can always find a combination of soup, vegetable and meat that I have on hand and can make into something good to eat. It is a life saver over and over. I bought this as a gift for a friend who recently married and got several very picky-eater stepchildren as â€œpart of the packageâ€. She loves this book and the easy, quick recipes that at least most of the kids will eat. If you can find a copy, it is a wonderful book.
