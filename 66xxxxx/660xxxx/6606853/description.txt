MATHEMATICS: ITS POWER AND UTILITY, 9e, combines a uniquely practical focus on real-world problem solving with a thorough and effective grounding in basic concepts and skills, allowing even the least-interested or worst-prepared student to appreciate the beauty and value of math while mastering course material. The first section of the book explores the power and historic impact of mathematics and helps you harness that power by developing an effective approach to problem solving.
The second section builds on this foundation by applying math concepts to a wide variety of real-life situations--including money management; handling of credit cards; inflation; purchase of a car or home; use of probability, statistics, and surveys; and many more topics of interest. MATHEMATICS: ITS POWER AND UTILITY, 9e, assumes only a basic working knowledge of arithmetic, making it effective even if you have no exposure to algebra or little confidence in your current math skills.
