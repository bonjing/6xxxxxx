 Saint Peter, a reluctant but passionate leader, from    
 the crucifixion of Jesus to his own. The film's first   
 half dramatizes the New Testament's "Acts": early fear, 
 the renewal of Pentecost, Saul's conversion, the        
 decision to baptize pagans, and the Apostles'           
 dispersal. In the second half, an aged Peter goes to    
 Rome to join Paul, arriving on the day of Paul's        
 arrest. Paul's death brings a crisis to Rome's          
 Christians and to Peter; lessons from Jesus's teachings 
 guide his decision to stay. Events within the fictive   
 household of Persius, a Roman aristocrat, capture the   
 upheaval that Christian teachings bring to the Eternal  
 City.

  Amazon has the A/R listed as 1.66:1, but that does not seem  
  to be the proper A/R. The audio seems to have been recorded  
  after the filming, so the sync is close but not quite        
  right. Enjoy.
