Storyline: On Easter Island, a young rabbit named E.B. (Russell Brand) is intended to succeed his father Mr Bunny (Hugh Laurie) as the Easter Bunny. Intimidated by the calling's demands, E.B. runs away to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer. Mr Bunny sends his three ninja royal guards, the Pink Berets (Janet Healy), to find his son. Meanwhile, Easter Chick Carlos (Hank Azaria) and his music-obsessed assistant, Phil (also Hank Azaria), plot a coup d'Ã©tat against Mr Bunny to take over the Easter organization.
