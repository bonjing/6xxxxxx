,Mister_C01,2012-01-31T12:29Z,"I also have that problem! I make a licence with the keymaker and activate it but when I refresh or restart it keeps reminding me to ""Buy Rainlendar Licence"" in Events!
It's really anoying, but no mater what name and mail I put in the keymaker and generate licence it's still up and buging!"

I have the same problem. I install everything and generate a license file, but the program keeps ""Reminding me to buy the full version"""
,arl3nu,2012-04-07T02:29Z,It looks as if the license is valid till 01.01.2012.  
,Mister_C01,2012-04-25T09:33Z,"Don't care any more! I exported my list to .csv and .ics files and uninstalled the ""Pro"" version. Then I downloaded free Lite version from official web and installed it. Inported .ics and all is well once again. It has minor limitations but I use it without them anyway.
When you can't beat them, join them! :) "
