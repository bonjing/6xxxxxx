A young lion prince is born in Africa, thus  
making his uncle Scar the second in line to  
the throne. Scar plots with the hyenas to    
kill King Mufasa and Prince Simba, thus      
making himself King. The King is killed and  
Simba is led to believe by Scar that it was  
his fault, and so flees the kingdom in shame.
After years of exile he is persuaded to      
return home to overthrow the usurper and     
claim the kingdom as his own thus completing 
the "Circle of Life".
