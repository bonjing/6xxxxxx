More than one hour compilation of music inspired by  the CyberPunk. 

Cyberpunk is a postmodern and science fiction genre noted for its focus on \\\"high tech and low life.\\\"The name is a portmanteau of cybernetics and punk, and was originally coined by Bruce Bethke as the title of his short story \\\"Cyberpunk,\\\" published in 1983. It features advanced science, such as information technology and cybernetics, coupled with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.\\\"
