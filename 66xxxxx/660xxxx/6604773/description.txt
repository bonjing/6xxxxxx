creature_d:
I found this record at Princeton Record Exchange for 10 or 12 bucks. The vinyl appears in very nice condition, I'd say VG+ conservatively, but then I do hear plenty of dusty sounds when played, so this record was probably made from one of the TMOQ versions that wasn't the best copy condition wise. I have no scanner, so I added pics of it. One(2nd from the right) of the girls looks like Pamela DeBarres of groupie fame in the late 60's early 70's in the LA area, but not positive on that. From the pics of Lady Di I am assuming this vinyl bootleg was made not long after that Lady Di boobs falling out of her dress incident. So, if anyone knows more about this bootleg, let us all know and I can update the info .txt file and attach it in a message to replace the current one.
