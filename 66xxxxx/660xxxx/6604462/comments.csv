It depends on the file type and media player. Solution may be different for each download. Try going into audio settings and switching the audio track, audio device, audio channel, language track, etc.
In VLC i had to switch the default audio track from 5.1 to stereo or it would only play the background music, no dialogue. And in windows media center you sometimes have to go into settings and manually change the language track from ""default"" to ""english"", even for some store bought dvds. Just a couple examples.."
