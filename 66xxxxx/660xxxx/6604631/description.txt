The lux is the SI unit of illuminance and luminous emittance equivalent to the radiometric irradiance (W/m2) but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function. Illuminance is a measure of how much luminous flux, measured in lumens, is spread over a given area.

You can read more about the lux at the manifestation of the sum of all human knowledge: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux.
