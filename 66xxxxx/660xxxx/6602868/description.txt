Manipulative Therapy: Musculoskeletal Medicine

Manipulative Therapy provides a systematic overview of chain reactions which are the basis of a rational holistic approach. These reactions are closely related to the upright human posture and to the deep stabilisation system as shown in the work of Richardson et al in Therapeutic Exercise for Spinal Stabilisation in Low Back Pain. This approach has meant a considerable advance in the therapy and rehabilitation of patients.
It gives a balanced picture of the importance of musles, joints and soft tissues, under the control of the nervous system, the textbook aims to treat disturbance of function, the most common cause of pain in the motor system, in the most effective way.
