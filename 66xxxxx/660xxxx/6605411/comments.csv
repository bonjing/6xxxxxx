Enjoy,

,darklordvyper,2012-02-02T22:58Z,"Don't bother downloading this giant piece of junk. It's a huge waste of time, unless you care about the active commentary on every episode. Thanks for wasting my time uploader."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-04T06:10Z,"Ignore Darklordviper. He obviously can't set windows media player up. He must have it set to commentary. I have personally watched every file in this torrent and they are spot on. I can't believe he downloaded it then deleted it, what a clown."

I am soon switching from TPB to another site that has no evil spam ads... and it saddens me to no end, the once great site TPB lowered to the same place as why we made TPB so huge.. I guess its a cash in whilst ya can..still, its sad to see...."
