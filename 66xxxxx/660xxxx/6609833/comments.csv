For those that are serious with mp3 files that are to be preserved in lossless mp3 form - other programs such as mp3directcut would be more sensible as mp3cutter isnt lossless although it should be. There is no reason to re-encode in any other form, and although Ive only used it once to sample it I am aware that gspot indicates it isnt lossless.  "
