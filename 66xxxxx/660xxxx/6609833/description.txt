This is the easiest to use mp3 cutter Ive found around, and its freeware to boot!

Its uses include splitting an album into individual songs:
(If you've ever downloaded one of those FLAC format files that contain an
entire disc in a single file without the convenience of having had the file
split into separate songs for you for each track, this program will do it for
you - there are other free tools also that convert FLAC to mp3 too by the way) 
with great ease of intuitive functionality in design. Simply load your source 
file and split away placing the cursor for start and stop positions as you listen
to the content and select "save" to create separate mp3 files as needed, with your
own setting for bitrate (192k is at present the default setting).
