,krixtian,2011-09-18T01:52Z,"OK, I figured it out, San Andreas it's only playable on higher resolution screens, so you need to connect it to a HD TV run the game, go to Options>Display>Advance and change the resolution to 1152x720 and it would work in your computer"

,ustand,2011-12-27T16:58Z,"I got the solution for SAN ANDREAS !!!
It works ! 
(Right mouse on the app gta SA) Just go Contens/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/Rockstar Games/GTA San Andreas/data
And delete ""gta_sa.set"" which is i think default parameters, then you can launch the game. 
(To change language, in the menu 2nd line then 4th line)"

,Explorer94,2012-05-03T20:46Z,"No English on GTA3, the English is in Polish. But the other languages working normally."
,Explorer94,2012-05-04T01:21Z,"Found the English Text on GTA 3, Click the icon and Show Package Contents > Contents > root > drive_c > Program Files > GTA 3 > TEXT > There will have 2 American files   just substitute the .gxt to .back and the .bak to .gxt and the game will be in English.

Good Luck, Hope I helped."
