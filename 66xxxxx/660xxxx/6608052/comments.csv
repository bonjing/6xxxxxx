They too will leave with their tail between their legs and many more will be coming back in pieces, wheelchairs, and body bags.  Thank Bush, Obama, and the next three idiots that'll keep them there and around the Middle East (to steal oil and other resources and keep the Zionist/racist American and APARTHEID israeli jew happy) until the USA is COMPLETELY bankrupt."
