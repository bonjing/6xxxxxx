,ShapeBox,2011-08-17T12:12Z,Doesn't work :[
,64base,2011-08-18T08:07Z,"Works on Vista & Windows 7, are you using 32bit or 64bit?

Your computer also has to be relatively new for this to work, this wont work on a 3 year old computer and make sure that you have sufficient HDD Space."
,64base,2011-09-04T03:42Z,"^ this doesn't require a serial number or a crack, so please stop spamming"
,junkbrol,2011-09-09T14:03Z,"I was having doubts after reading some (clearly spam) comments ...

Tried anyway, and it works as a charm on WIN7ulti64 !

Thanks for the up Birungueta !"
,junkbrol,2011-09-09T14:06Z,"and I forgot, there is nothing with serials needed
(as it is portable)

clearly some don't want us to use this ... wonder why ;-)))"
,rajanu,2011-10-09T09:28Z,"I am using Windows 7 64 bit
and it worked well for me...

thanks for the nice upload... :)"
,mike18xx2,2011-10-23T07:25Z,"Any chance of a 32bit version of this? (There are some of us yobs out there still running XP on cast-off P4s, and flash isn't something that requires tremendous amounts of horsepower anyway.)"
,64base,2011-10-28T09:57Z,@mike18xx2 I'm running this on a 32bit Windows 7 machine and it works perfectly and it also works on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (32bit) as tested by myself.
,rei_bay,2011-12-04T11:53Z,"hey Birungueta, 
could you tell me how to get the AIR SDK to work? 
Thanks!"
,digitechi,2011-12-25T10:27Z,will this work on windows xp sp3 or sp 2 32-bit version
,iMozzer,2012-01-25T16:31Z,Thanks. Works perfectly on Win 7 64 bit.
,sasa2700,2012-01-31T09:34Z,it's working thanks
,xenahope,2012-02-20T23:13Z,"Win 7 SP1 and it works great, Thanks for the  torrent :)"
,Xqu,2012-03-12T19:00Z,"I have Windows 7, 64 bit and when I try to start it up it crashes at ""Loading User Profile"".
When I was using it two months ago it was working fine."
,FlashyVox,2012-04-06T14:05Z,"Don't listen to those bullshit scrub ass spammers! This torrent works 100% no errors, no cracks required, no activation, no installation... everything works like a dream. You just take the file you downloaded run it wait for a few secs for it to load (as much as you would wait for standard flash cs5 to launch) and voila all works! You can save layout and preferences, i just happen to move it to my Adobe folder because i'm used to all my adobe progfs in adobe folder. Made a shortcut to desktop and replaced the shortcut icon with adobe icon downloaded from google. Voila everything is like original. If on vista or win7 out of some weird anomaly you happen to have issues launching this right click on the file and select compatibility tab and select run this program with windows xp sp3 mode. However i tested this on both XP and Win 7 via dual boot and this app works on both os. +10 From me!"
,VaderforprezAZ09,2012-04-12T00:18Z,Be there viruses? I'm a little on edge after my encounters with... Windows XP Security 2012... *shudder*
,DACreech,2012-04-17T10:15Z,"When I Launch it and when I clicked one of the learn buttons it tried to make an internet connection, which I stopped.  Is it safe to let it make the connection or not? "
,DACreech,2012-04-17T10:16Z,"By the way, thanks a bunch for this upload!"
,D255,2012-05-04T13:03Z,"64base;
thanks man..it works on 32bit wins"
,xueyao1998,2012-05-20T05:11Z,Got an error 5 code...Help me please
,Furaven,2012-05-20T14:44Z,"Doesn't work.

After I run the exe only the site picture pops up and nothing happens.
I disabled my antivirus, Flash started loading and ended up crashing.

It's exactly the same program I found on YT. Didn't work for me."
