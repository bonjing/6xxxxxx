------------Installation---------
1. Download the torrent.
2. Run the \"Portable Adobe Flash CS5.5.exe\" file
3. Wait for the initial files to extract (this may take 30 seconds to approx. one minute and will occur only once)
4. Adobe Flash CS5.5 will launch!


------------Notes----------------
* This is the portable version and does NOT require a crack or the user to input a serial number within any time-frame.

* The portable version initially does not support Adobe AIR publishing. You can, though, enable this by downloading the AdobeAIRSDK for your operating system (via Adobe.com) and consult me for more info (below)

* The portable version is a small file, but when running the portable version for the first time another 300-450mb is required to extract the required files. So, if youre planning on copying the portable version into your USB please have an extra 300-450mb of free space.
