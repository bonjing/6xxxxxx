,pinoyzr,2011-08-26T17:43Z,"great quality as always! thanks for sharing this too! :)

btw, just one question..
I downloaded a different movie in .mkv format and converted it AVCHD using TSMuxer, I burn it to a DVD+R UDF 2.5..The problem is that when I play it on my Blu-Ray player the video is choppy.  But when I burn and play your .ISO, everything is working fine, the video is not choppy at all.  Do you know what can be causing this?  Or what do you use to make the movie in AVCHD format?  Thanks!

Thanks again for the awesome quality!"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-08-27T09:11Z,"Hi pinoyz - TsMuxer is a fine tool, but it does not convert or encode; it simply mux's/demux's a video's file/folder structure, so unfortunately it's not that straightforward. For AVCHD to work, video resolutions need to be either 1920x1080 or 1280x780 for 1080p & 720p respectively. As you are probably aware, most movies today are aimed at theatres rather than TVs, which generally means they have an aspect ratio of 16:9/2.35:1, giving a screen resolution of around 1920x800 for 1080p, so to preserve the movie's aspect ratio, mattes/black bars have to be added to the video itself. This task alone requires a full re-encode, and without it, you will get the results that you are describing. MKV contained video files are generally cropped, so although you will still see the mattes/black bars when played via a computer's media player, they are created by the media player to fill your screen, and are not actually part of the video, which creates a problem for blu-ray players. I hope this helps.

@ everyone else - thanks, and we'll see what we can do with your requests. "

,neonewton,2011-08-28T20:29Z,"I am a big Fan of your torrents and I really appreciate what you are doing .... Can you please upload The incredible Hulk , Thor and Captain america as i have already downloaded iron man 1 and 2 and want to have a collection of the marvel movies ... Thanks you so much for this .. "
,PryingOpenMy3rdEye,2011-08-30T07:38Z,"Hello again HD-R-US,

I just want to take back the request I made for Lord of the rings, I think the best one that you could do in the next month if possible would be the release of the entire star wars Saga since it hits Blu-Ray September 16th, and I know there has got to be a sea of Fans out there. 

I know you're swamped with requests, seeing as just this torrent alone has about 6 requests alone, so time is no issue, I just wanted to get that out there. 

Again thanks for all you do to provide us with the best quality."
,torrentking64,2011-09-02T18:59Z,WHERE ARE YOU GUYS WHY DO YOU KEEP DISAPPEARING. WE MISS YOU. WHEN YOU COMING BACK?
,PryingOpenMy3rdEye,2011-09-03T05:34Z,"@torrentking64

HD-R-US has stated on a few of his torrents that he's been traveling a lot lately and doesn't have as much time for stuff like this anymore. Just be patient :-D"
,francoxi,2011-09-04T04:58Z,"hey, you are doing a great job here I'm impressed, It's a shame you guys(or if it's just one person) don't get enough help, do you guys have a website with donation button? I tried finding a way to burn 1080p videos that I download from thepiratebay to a dvd but I had no success, is there a tutorial that teaches what you did to this video step by step? "
,francoxi,2011-09-04T05:01Z,"Great job you are doing here, really nice quality and easy to burn I can't express my gratitude enough!
