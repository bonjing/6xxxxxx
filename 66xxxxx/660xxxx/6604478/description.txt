- - -Horizon Cannabis The Evil Weed (HDTV 720p) *yum*
Cannabis is the world's favourite drug, but also one of the least understood. Can cannabis cause schizophrenia? Is it addictive? Can it lead you on to harder drugs? Or is it simply a herb, an undervalued medicine?
Addiction specialist Dr John Marsden discovers that modern science is finally beginning to find answers to these questions. John traces the cannabis plants' birthplace in Kazakhstan; finds the origins of our sensitivity to cannabis in the simple sea squirt; and shows just what it does to our brains.
He meets people who have been changed by this drug in drastically different ways - from those whose lives have been shattered to those who lives have been revived.

He discovers that the robotics world is as weird as it is insanely complicated. During his quest he 
meets a Japanese man who makes copies of himself and his daughter, an Italian who claims he's

- - -Horizon S48E06 (HDTV 720p) *Favorite*
Alan Davies attempts to answer the proverbial question: how long is a piece of string? But what appears to be a simple task soon turns into a mind-bending voyage of discovery where nothing is as it seems. An encounter with leading mathematician Marcus du Sautoy reveals that Alan's short length of string may in fact be infinitely long. When Alan attempts to measure his string at the atomic scale, events take an even stranger turn. Not only do objects appear in many places at once, but reality itself seems to be an illusion. Ultimately, Alan finds that measuring his piece of string could - in theory at least - create a black hole, bringing about the end of the world.

Andrew Graham-Dixon explores the origins of the Russian religious icon. He explores the origins of the Russian 
icon from its roots in Byzantium and the first great Russian icon, Our Lady of Vladimir to the masterpieces of 
the country's most famous icon painter, Andrei Rublev.Both epic and awe-inspiring, and producing brilliant art, 
nevertheless medieval Russia could be a terrifying place. Criss-crossing the epic landscape, Andrew visits the 
monastery founded by Ivan the Terrible, where his favourite forms of torture found inspiration in religious art.
One man would shine a light into Russia's 'dark' ages - Peter the Great who, surprisingly, took as his 
inspiration Deptford in South London.

Hitler's Hidden City is a subterranean adventure under the streets of Berlin, following the work of a team of German archaeologists and historians exposing and exploring the last remaining structures of the Third Reich. We gain rare access to an underground city ordered and -- in part -- designed by Hitler himself, part of a vast network of over 1000 bunkers and many miles of tunnels, much of which has remained sealed since the war. Eyewitnesses and historians add colorful stories to cutting edge CGI that bring to life this network of bunkers, how they were built and how they were used in the dark days of the downfall of Berlin.
