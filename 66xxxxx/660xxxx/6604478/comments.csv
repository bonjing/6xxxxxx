For those that might be curious here are some notes:

History Channel Body Language show - not in this pack
Horizon episodes listed as series 48 are from series 46
Horizon episode listed as series 46 is from series 45
Megascience Time Travel is actually stretched SD (the Science Channel's fault)

Hopefully that extra info will help if you're deciding to d/l parts or not."
