"The Story of Paul", winner of the 1975 Jean Vigo Prize, told entirely without pyrotechnics of any kind, and with unsparing and sympathetic realism, this film examines a young man's life in the mental institution to which he was sent following a suicide attempt. (Clarke Fountain)

This film is based on a real life experience of the director
