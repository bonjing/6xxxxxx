A Chapter in the Mallory Chronicles

The president orders Captain Deke Mallory to penetrate a mysterious brotherhood of Neo-Nazi billionaires. They've financed a coup d'etat in Central America to begin their takeover of the Global Monetary System.

Computer-based trading has long since replaced the Gold Monetary Standard. But the Geschaft's shipload of Nazi Gold from behind the former Iron Curtain will rule - once they turn back the clock with super-viruses that destroy computer languages. Juggling flight testing of the 21st century Joint Strike Fighter aboard USS Ronald Reagan with undercover missions ashore, the TOPGUN naval aviator is suddenly plunged into an unfamiliar world where wits are his only weapon. With pressure mounting from the CIA's top spymaster, a cunning president, and the admiral aboard the carrier, the future of the civilized world suddenly depends on Deke Mallory's unauthorized actions.
