,tomsquik,2011-08-18T15:28Z,"48 hrs, still green light.

thanks"
,eulexp,2011-09-02T16:26Z,"Seems to work just fine on my computer (I followed the usual rule to block & co, dunno if it helped though...)

thanks a lot !"
,Oldmahn,2011-09-05T04:20Z,works for me!
,CoffeeStained,2011-09-11T06:29Z,Did not pass 72hr test for me.
,CoffeeStained,2011-09-11T06:39Z,"I'm a retard, I didn't tell LS to block itself. If you, too, are a retard, just tell LS to block itself from HD>Library>Little Snitch>Little Snitch UIAgent. Then simply re-enter the serial."
,spamoften,2011-09-18T05:33Z,"Other than the serial included in the download, is this the exact same .dmg as available on the obdev.at site?  

It seems all the previous methods of blocking LS from reporting the serial are no longer working (modifying hosts file, blocking LS, making the registration file read-only).  

Does anyone have proven 2.4.2 workarounds which work with Lion?"
,CoffeeStained,2011-09-18T17:51Z,"spamoften: All I did was tell LS to block itself, and it has been working for 6 days now."
,deim23,2011-09-25T22:57Z,"@CoffeeStained - Hi, I'm not terribly new to PB and others but until now haven't been terribly concerned with accountability. Can you tell me what you meant by the 72 hour test?

@tomsquik - also, could you tell me what you meant by green light? 

what should I be doing to remain safe when using serials and such?

- Thanks so much"
