,ccorels,2011-08-15T08:35Z,Thanks - but over 16 hours after the 450 class?  Can I get earlier releases by donation?
,diemilkdud,2011-08-15T09:32Z,"@ccorels:
 Your not seriously bitching about having to wait for this are you? Give me a break.
Thanks Nic, perfect as usual.
P.S. Take all the damm time you want brosief. If it wasn't for you most of us here wouldn't be able to watch these races at all."
,Murgen58,2011-08-15T10:53Z,"@ccorels - check the TV coverage times. can't believe you are complaining! 
Thanks Nic - without you I wouldn't see the races"
,slicknick610,2011-08-15T13:32Z,@ccorels: The 450 race was late because of a computer issue. The 250 race was late because they played it at 11:30pm at night and I was not home. I try my best but I do have a life. I wish my recording device had a recording scheduler but it doesn't. So I have to be there to record the race either live or off my dvr.

,MX27,2011-08-15T17:25Z,"Thanks a million Slick.
@ccorels is a complete Spode."
,ccorels,2011-08-15T18:09Z,"Thanks again Nick.  The up is much appreciated - I just wanted to see if there was any way to donate to get faster releases.  A lot of people rely on you for mx ups - you're the man.

@MX27 @Murgen58 @diemilkdud Pull the stick out of your asses or fuck off"
,slicknick610,2011-08-16T01:05Z,@ccorels: As long as everything goes fine and I am home and the race doesn't air late at night. I can have an hour long race in 720p uploaded about 5 hours after it airs. I am going for quality not speed that is why it takes 5 hours. 
,micklemack,2011-08-21T10:15Z,"Thankyou slicknick you make thousands of motocross fans happy - escpecially those from the other end of the world. thankyou.
Take your time, I am glad you upload.
Without you would not be able to watch."

,slicknick610,2011-08-28T14:37Z,@par136 If you are the guy requesting old races I tried to answer you. Email me at the email address in my description.
