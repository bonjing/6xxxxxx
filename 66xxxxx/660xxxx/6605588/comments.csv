,Mr_Gamer,2011-08-16T03:39Z,"Why are MOST pepole still downloading crappy DivX/XviD's? - Yes, they are smaller. But proportionally, the Lo-Res rips are of MUCH lower quality per MB than the equivalent HD-Rip. HD-Rip's Are compressed with the H264 Codec and contained in an *.MKV-file (could be that some are still afraid of the format, or don't know how to play it, google CCCP!). And produces files which are *more* than four times the quality for *less* than four times the size! This general notion is true for all 45/50 minute series released in either Divx/Xvid or h264. So take the extra time! It's worth it!"

These rips are decent enough quality and work on my older portable player. The MKV's don't. Plus with everything else I download multiplying the amount I have to download by 4 kills my download limit.  "
