In this major assessment of leading climate-change skeptic BjÃ¸rn Lomborg, Howard Friel meticulously deconstructs the Danish statisticianâ€™s claim that global warming is â€œno catastropheâ€ by exposing the systematic misrepresentations and partial accounting that are at the core of climate skepticism. His detailed analysis serves not only as a guide to reading the global warming skeptics, but also as a model for assessing the state of climate science. With attention to the complexities of climate-related phenomena across a range of areasâ€”from Arctic sea ice to the Antarctic ice sheetâ€”The Lomborg Deception also offers readers an enlightening review of some of todayâ€™s most urgent climate concerns.

Frielâ€™s book is the first to respond directly to Lomborgâ€™s controversial research as published in The Skeptical Environmentalist (2001) and Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalistâ€™s Guide to Global Warming (2007). His close reading of Lomborgâ€™s textual claims and supporting footnotes reveals a lengthy list of findings that will rock climate skeptics and their allies in the government and news media, demonstrating that the published peer-reviewed climate science, as assessed mainly by the U.N.â€™s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has had it mostly rightâ€”even if somewhat conservatively rightâ€”all along. Frielâ€™s able defense of Al Goreâ€™s An Inconvenient Truth against Lomborgâ€™s repeated attacks is by itself worth an attentive reading.
