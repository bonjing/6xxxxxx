,Cyrus87,2011-08-24T12:27Z,"Not a DVDrip, it's an R5 line. I hate it when people put DVDRip when it's not. If your looking for great quality go elswhere, if your looking to watch the film at Meh Quality this isn't so so bad."
,Hades85,2011-09-02T01:41Z,"idk wtf this was but it seemed to have a virus or somethin majorly wrong with the file. I was unable to delete it without shutting off windows explorer and using the command propt to delete it. I couldnt do anything with it otherwise. it wouldnt play, I couldnt rename it,couldnt move it, and couldnt delete it. I REPEAT THIS FILE MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF VIRUS OR SOMETHING SEVERELY WRONG WITH IT!!!!!!"

,Storm608,2011-09-12T21:00Z,"AcousticAdam, if you're using a Mac, you can use VLC to view the file, or you can convert it to a real video format with VisualHub.

Ethelwulf, I run both Mac OS and Win XP on my iMac.  Mac OS wins every time."

,TheMeatshack69,2011-09-21T01:26Z,"The movie is an instant classic. But the quality... I know it's not a dvd rip, but that's what he said in the title. And it's not. Either that or it's just bad quality. And the russian subtitles were pissing me off. I lost like 15% of the movie because they were speaking german but the subs were in russian. Other than that... Lol."
,Masterdegan,2011-09-22T22:14Z,This torrent is bugged don't download it just got a letter in the mail saying it is copyrighted. This is a sleeper do not download. 
,grafik1,2011-09-27T01:14Z,"@ GBGandalf
R5, in the film business, is a copy of a movie made with a telecine machine from an analog source and is typically of a lower quality than other region releases.[1]
In telecine (TK) the digitization is performed by the studio itself with very professional (and expensive) equipment and usually from the original source (the movie reel).

,smartass1011,2011-10-05T14:45Z,Should have read the comments first. Bugged video that is being tracked by MPAA. I got a letter from Time Warner after downloading. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TORRENT AND TYKOON123
,XHaloX,2011-10-16T01:45Z,"@grafik1, you are wrong, R5 is just a DVD with audio other than english released to different regions before the official release of english DVD to fight piracy.

What the guys do is take the R5 release and re-encode it with an english audio taken from another source normally CAM (as the english DVD is not released as yet).

And thats why the Video looks good and audio is not but sometimes if the cam is good enough, then the audio will be good as well."
