::Plot::
In 1914, nine-year-old Howard Hughes is being bathed by his mother
(Amy Sloan). She warns him of disease, influenced by a flu outbreak,
"You are not safe." Howard's later life will be greatly affected by his
fear of disease.

By 1927, Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) has inherited a fortune, is living
in California and is actively involved in the relatively new fields of
motion pictures and aviation. He intends to direct the film Hell's
Angels at the age of 22. He also hires Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to
run the Hughes Tool Company.
