Release Notes:

"His debut album... skates dangerously close to self-indulgent pastiche yet
contains some immaculately played gems that possess the definitive crackle of
old-school analogue tape sessions." musicomh.com

"It is the atmosphere and production that continually impresses... Sure, we know
the setting well and Wilson is a little too passive at times, but this is where
he wants to be and he fully immerses himself in his passion for sun-baked,
country-tinged sounds, wrapped in guitars, pianos and mellowed rhythms."
bowlegsmusic.com

"Wilson has a rich folk lineage... so it is no surprise that this record is
rustic, both in sound and imagery. A carefully crafted album likely to find
favour with fans of Wilco or Crosby, Stills and Nash." list.co.uk
