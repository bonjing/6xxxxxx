unless your pdf files speak put them where they should be  in Other---->Ebooks"
,reddfraser,2011-08-13T08:10Z,"HEY! Ricola,

HEY, AGAIN...You Awake?  ....knowing how bored you are. ""I'M getting bored""  + ""UNLESS ...files can speak"" + ""put where SHOULD be"" =  arrogance + sarcasm + guilt trip; all rolled into a couple of self-centered sentences.
     Why don't you and all your rude, though more experienced, pecker-wood friends quit with your power-tripping put downs. This site is  doing something GGGRRRREEEAAATTT...
      As a VERY intelligent man, just getting into PC's, they are NOT ""User Friendly"" at all! A PC marketing oxymoron....like 'Military Intelligence"", Or ""Polite, gutless bully""...
      We newbies are out here, and we waste hours every day trying to figure this crap out. I, for one, was HAPPY to stumble onto to this GREAT collection of REAL PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY WORK....PLUS the huge bonus of UNDERSTANDABLE INSTRUCTIONS that means
I'm 10x more likely to get running. All because folks like Bluesea put energy and brains into their sharing gold nuggets

Quick suggestion:
      In future try investing a few more lines and walk us thru the magic, needlessly complicated string of :  icon p->file xyz->sub-file hij->tab g->tab n->etc-> etc, which we could then imitate.  .'. fewer ""Mistakes"" for you to move. Until you can see that as a WIN=WIN

.....go to your room...W/O your milk and animal crackers.

Your lengthy statement may has some truth inside but you should respect MODs mate. The problem which leaded you to write such long para twice - is with us all. But particularly about that person 'Agricola' - I know him since he was helper. He is such a kind and helpful person. You don't know the ugly power of TPB. Go and put quarter of that para at Suprbay forum and you will have a cracking idea about the management.

All in a simple: If you wanna be here - be good, be silent - and most of all RESPECT MODS.

@bigbluesea:
Thanx for sharing. Continue good work ..."
