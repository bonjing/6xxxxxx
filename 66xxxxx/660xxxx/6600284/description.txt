    Tuula's husband Jukka takes care of all domestic chores. Tuula seems     
    to have no idea that her husband spends his evenings working as a        
    major league ice hockey referee. She also finds out about his            
    extra-marital affair with a female rally driver. In revenge, Tuula       
    starts seeing her gynecologist Timo Paasi, a married man with six        
    children.
