Storyline:

The future is set for Tony and Michael - owning a neighbour- hood bar and making deals in the mean streets of New York city's 
Little Italy. For Charlie, the future is less clearly defined. A small-time hood, he works for his uncle, making collections 
and reclaiming bad debts. He's probably too nice to succeed. In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of (because of her epilepsy) 
and a friend of her cousin, Johnny Boy, a near psychotic whose trouble-making threatens them all - he can't reconcile opposing 
values. A failed attempt to escape (to Brooklyn) moves them all a step closer to a bitter, almost preordained future.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
