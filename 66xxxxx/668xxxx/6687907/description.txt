My DVD rips are nice and clean. I don't transcode, I don't remove menus or subtitles (Dutch and English subs and more are usually available) and I certainly dmon't remove or recode the highest quality audio track available (in the order DTS  - DD 5.1 - PCM - DD 2.0). The originally spoken language is always preserved; in my country we do synchronization only for children's movies.


FEEDBACK WILL BE APPRECIATED :)




Format: DVD files (VIDEO_TS folder) or incidentally an iso image file.
