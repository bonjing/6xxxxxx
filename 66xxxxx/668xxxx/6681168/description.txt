The Complete Guide to Home Carpentry combines the most popular carpentry projects with up-to-date information on tools, techniques, and materials required for home projects. Easy-to-use photo-driven pages show readers the most common saw cuts, nailing techniques, router designs, and skills for using dozens of other tools. Projects range from framing a partition wall, building shelves, and installing windows and doors, to hanging cabinets, cutting countertops, and installing trim. Readers even learn how to remove walls for remodeling projects.

This book contains everything readers need for their projects - both new construction and repairs - in user-friendly detail. Color photos accompany each technique and project. The result is an indispensable resource for any homeowner planning a carpentry project, large or small.
