,Hellyboi,2011-09-18T07:24Z,"I already uninstalled the game two days ago. Event though I do like some features of the game (bullet drop, to be able to switch to iron crosshair from your sniper rifle and etc.) AI is a fail."
,hertsa,2011-09-18T07:34Z,imao how fast downloaded!!
,TheBigHase,2011-09-18T11:13Z,Well my experience with this so far: You still need the steam.api.dll from Dead Island update 1 to play the game. It seems it fixes the German sound issue (Soldiers in combat talked English before) as well BUT when I got to the Railway Station I had a total PC crash (freeze) dunno why. But it looks as there will be many more updates so thx and we will see if it improves.
,Dimmis80,2011-09-18T12:23Z,"Hey guys.@ErikZown congrats dude for this release..:-) Now i have a question.Does this update works with the Cracked/Repack-Tomek116,Sonuyos version of the game.?Are they compatible.??"
,Heatblade1212,2011-09-19T03:06Z,"guys, can you play multiplayer with this version of the game?"
