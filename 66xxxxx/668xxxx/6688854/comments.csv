To activate it, download this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5591774/KMS_Activator_for_Microsoft_Office_2010_Applications_x86_x64_Mul

Run as administrator and select Activation Office 2010 VL. Then you're done, you need to re-run it every 6 months to keep Office activated."
,mEmOkIrI,2011-09-20T10:37Z,thnx man :)
,tylsiege,2011-09-20T18:00Z,Why all the negative votes? Does this program allow updates from M$?
,Ebay42,2011-09-20T21:45Z,The X Files would be amazing. 
,TiGORiN,2011-09-20T22:02Z,"I recommend taking a Office 2010 Professional with SP1 already integrated, like this one:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6552680/Microsoft_Office_Professional_Plus_2010_with_Service_Pack_1_VL_E"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-09-20T23:42Z,"The negative votes are done by people who also have a torrent for Office. For some reason they try to mark down other peoples torrents as they fear people won't download theirs. It's quite sad really. This has been installed on thousands of machines and works perfectly. Some of the others don't and some even make you phone Microsoft to activate it, this one doesn't. You do not need to call Microsoft at all with this one.   "

Have you uninstalled your old Office program before installing this? 

This is not a new torrent, it's been used for well over a year but I had to delete it and re-upload it. This works perfectly, I'm assuming anyone who has had a problem hasn't followed the instructions.

Worth reading the comments on the KMS torrent to see if anyone else has had issues, I'd doubt it though.   "

What would be preventing your Office Product from installing?"

I appears that I may be having the same issue as Tacmat. When I click on the application through Winrar, it looks like I've extracted all of Office files but there is no option to install them. What am I missing???"

,ultrapulse,2012-01-10T21:06Z,"DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use KMS Activation firstly you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if its installing Trojans or other viruses onto your system and secondly it only activates it for 180 days. Activate it permanently with a serial and by ringing Microsoft and getting the conformation ID, that way you know you are safe and secure and also you know it is permanently activated.

01. start Word.
02. If the activation window appears close it.
03. Go to menu File, Help, Change Product Code, and then enter key:
828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH or 3W3MQ-H7M6X-3WYP7-TPCH6-8G8T2
04. Untick the ""Activate over internet"" box at the bottom, and click ""Next"".
05. In the window that appears click ""Install"".
06. When finished the Install process, close word an then reopen Word.
07. An activation window will appear (if not, go to menu File, Help, Activate).
08. Select the ""Phone Activation"" option, and click ""Next"".
09. Pick your country, then ring the number and follow the instructions.
10. When asked for your ID, input the code given in the Word activation window.
11. When asked which edition, choose business/volume use, used only on 1 pc.
12. A code will be given back, and enter the code into the activation box.
13. Click ""Next"", and Office will say that it's permanently activated.
14. Close Word (and any other Office 2010 application).
15. Restart Word, and go to Help to check the subscription status.

Office 2010 is now fully and permanently activated."
