This extremezone have contributed over and over to TPB AND@ Other fuckin Sites With Counless Torrents,, Thank God Us PC Game Rippers Can Download a game From Him and Thank Both Him And SKIDROW,RELOADED,RAZOR1911 ect

Dude,, Fuck If He's Late Or Ontime.. His Torrents Are Heavily Seeded And Greatly Appreciated ....."
[T],PirateBoy,2011-09-19T02:36Z,"@ blaze69

well said buddy. absolutely correct.

@rlf-rls

Man, u really suck. if no one wants these games, then why are you even wasting your time commenting here? Just get out of here! You won't be able to compete with Extremezone by commenting stupidly and senselessly. If you want to beat him, then don't waste your time here; rather use the time to upload quality torrents, dude!"
,irishboyblue,2011-09-19T14:52Z,"extremezone  your a bad ass uploader who,ve gave many a member a big smile bless !"

,baddgoat,2011-09-22T04:19Z,"I get this error when trying to start game. ""The program can't start because PhysXLoader.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""

I've installed twice and same error. I'm assuming I copied over the crack right, as I don't usually have any problems. Know how I can fix this???

Thanks in advance."
,1TWISTED,2011-09-22T18:18Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,What_Tha,2011-09-23T19:12Z,"@baddgoat =)

Thought Id finally get round to signing up since you needed some help.  I had the same error on my installation.  For me reinstalling physx from my nvidia GPU drivers fixed the problem and the game now works.  Should be located in C:\Nvidia\DisplayDriver\280.26\WinVista_Win7_64\English\Physx
(Yours may be slightly different depending on your driver version OS and native tongue but this should give you a pretty good idea)  Alternatively just reinstall your whole graphics card driver.  I decided against this though coz of the reboot roundabout that goes with... lol )

Hope thats some help for you and its nice to have a voice here at last lol.  Guess its about time I said thanks to both extremezone and .bone. who I both regularly take torrents from hahaha.  Thanks folks. =)"
,g0dsize,2011-09-23T19:29Z,"Works great on my rig (i5-2500K/8GB RAM/Geforce 570/Windows 7 x64).  Thanks much for the upload, extemezone.

@rlf-rls -- I have no idea how you became a trusted uploader with a shit attitude like that.  I couldn't give two shits if the release is a couple days late - it's free, and with extremezone I know I'm getting a good deal because his torrents are quality and always work."
,Extreme-x,2011-09-23T21:26Z,Good game. Thank You. ... Downloading
,climbmnts,2011-10-19T17:52Z,"@rlf-rls
I'm sorry But you are just a Dumb ignorant Cunt! 

And once again a Flawless upload from extremezone! Thank you ! Keep up the excellent work!"
,buttonsswcb,2011-11-24T22:57Z,ok so i have updated my ati radeon hd 4200 and im still getting the missing dll msg. help please?
,buttonsswcb,2011-11-24T22:59Z,"the ""PhysXLoader.dll is missing"" error msg."
,JoeMcFly,2012-01-04T12:54Z,"To fix the ""PhysXLoader.dll"" missing error you have to in install PhysX which is located in ""Xotic install folder\redist\PhysX\"" or if you so clumsy that you don't know how to find it just search for ""PhysXSoftware.exe"" after you install Xotic.

PS: yes PhysX is made by Nvidia but don't worry it's working with ATI cards as well."

""By any chance is the sample rate on your sound card set to 96,000 Hz or higher? There's a known issue trying to play 3D sounds at that setting. If so, as a workaround, you can lower the sample rate and it should load fine."" is what they say!"
