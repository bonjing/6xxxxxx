,prema23,2011-09-20T08:34Z,actually it looks like a re-upload to me... i remember seeing this torrent around back in july when lion came out.
[T],Apokarteron,2011-09-20T13:42Z,"Yes, this is a re-upload.  The other one didn't have the same checksum number as the one downloaded from the App Store, which is this one here."
,MacNaldo,2011-09-21T07:11Z,Does it work?
,idontcare007,2011-09-21T09:31Z,"No it dosen't work, Thats why he uploaded it -_-"
[T],Apokarteron,2011-09-22T12:50Z,Of course it works!
,virus.app,2011-09-22T15:09Z,i downloaded the old torrent. havent installed it yet. what is a checksum number? is something wrong with the old torrent? cant update via software update.. something like that?
[T],Apokarteron,2011-09-22T18:41Z,"The older version is optimised for hackintosh installation, so I suggest you use this one instead.  The SHA-1 checksum for the file ""InstallESD.dmg"" which is found inside ""Install Mac OS X Lion.app"" is: e05c4c7c43b210d0b8fc265c609f4dd70617ff86"
,virus.app,2011-09-23T04:09Z,naa... thanx for the upload man.. my network is very slow.. besides i got my visa debit card just a few days back ;D..will buy this one.. so u r saying the old torrent can b used on a windows pc ryt...ok and what abt installing updates from apple???... thanx again for uploading this and 90 other torrents.. 
,desserts,2011-09-23T23:18Z,Note this is not a bootable version.
[T],Apokarteron,2011-09-24T16:58Z,"It is bootable actually.  Just right click on the ""Install Mac OS X.app"", click ""Show Package Content"", then go to: Contents > SharedSupport, where you will find the image file: ""InstallEST.dmg"".  Burn it onto a DVD or a USB-stick and boot from there."
,JGeek007,2011-09-25T14:19Z,This torrent did not work for me. My current os is mac os 10.8. I burned this to dvd and did not work.
,JGeek007,2011-09-25T16:27Z,"Got it working by doing this...

1. After you download, a file will appear ""Install Mac OS X Lion"".
2. Right click the file, and click on ""Show Contents"".

4. Double click ""InstallESD.dmg"".

,nemosrings,2011-09-30T17:41Z,"Lion only costs $30, get a life! sheesh Are you all really so miserly? lol That's what, equivalent to the cost of a handful of macdonald's big macs & a coke? lol

I'm not interested in losing Rosetta support thus I'd lose ability to use lots of applications, no Lion for me thanks. :P Lion does not have anything I need."
[T],Apokarteron,2011-09-30T21:15Z,Why pay for something you can get for free?  Spend your money wisely os something you can't get for free!
,MMarquis,2011-09-30T21:33Z,"Will this allow me to upgrade to 10.7.2? I downloaded the previous version you uploaded, but the update doesn't show up that I can download the new version. "
[T],Apokarteron,2011-10-01T01:30Z,"Yes, you can update normally with this version."
,MMarquis,2011-10-01T04:03Z,Awesome! Thank you!
,Dannieloco,2011-10-01T09:08Z,Thanks for the share!.. nesmosrings is a douche
,Dannieloco,2011-10-01T09:09Z,"To be honest, I updated my macbook to lion from snow leopard and things ran great! Then about a week later, my mac just shut off and I kept getting errors.. I was told to back up my files and reformat. The computer IS a lot faster when you install OSX lion from scratch than if u upgrade from Snow Leopard. If you have the time and energy to redo ur computer, do it, its wayy more worth it"

,Crueljoker007,2011-10-08T00:39Z,Will this wipe out my HDD? And will I have an option to format my HDD and make this my primary and only OS?
[T],Apokarteron,2011-10-08T14:37Z,"You can either install it as an update on Snow Leopard, keeping all your files intact, or wipe your HDD completely and do a fresh install."

,jamtlh69,2011-10-17T18:37Z,"If I wipe my HDD and upgrade to Lion, will this re-install all the applications that come with Lion and everything?"
,Dubsyoh,2011-10-17T18:59Z,"Apokarteron, could you please confirm if this will install to a fresh HDD burnt onto a DVD?
I am building a hackintosh and instead of having to install snow leopard then update to lion I would prefer to simply install Lion fresh onto a new HDD.

If anyone could confirm this that would be of great help!"

,FatFreddy19,2011-10-21T15:15Z,"thanks for this. @xd001lugia (sigh), this is for Mac, not Windows. You can install Windows on a Mac but you CAN'T install Mac on a Windows machine. Why? Because Windows is crap and Mac isn't."
,iFarted,2011-10-22T17:56Z,"Hey I got a question on this torrent :                   

1. )Can I install this version without having pre-installed snow leopard ?

2.) Can I install this on Intel Dual Core PC ?

3.) How do I mount / install this .dmg file on win 7 ?

4.) I am using windows 7 , I know how to build hackintosh with snow leopard , can I do same with Lion ? With win 7 and without having Snow Leopard pre-installed ?

5.) Can I make full clean install from this torrent only? Or is this just an update to Snow Leopard? 

Please help me ! I'm dying to use MAC =/"
,aNsHuLt,2011-10-24T17:50Z,I have a macbook pro with Snow Leopard pre installed in it. Should I install this pirated Lion or not(no Apple store in the city which I live) 
[T],Apokarteron,2011-10-24T23:51Z,"This ""pirated"" version is exactly the same as the Mac App Store version.  Apple can't see whether your version is pirated or not, so why not just go ahead and install it?"
,shaheerking1,2011-10-25T11:34Z,how does it work sir?

,TheRuthlessOne,2011-10-28T08:34Z,"Not sure what I am doing wrong, but everything I do brings up an error. This is after I open the SharedSupport folder and get to the InstallESD.dmg

Does anyone know why this is happening? "
,TheRuthlessOne,2011-10-28T08:37Z,"When I follow the instructions given here, the Install Mac OS X Lion.app has an X over it and will not allow me to open it. 

Can anyone help me with this?"
,smobras,2011-10-28T13:34Z,"On your Leopard-equipped Mac, navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices.

Using a text editor that lets you enter an admin-user name and password to edit system-level filesâ€”such as the non-Mac App Store version of TextWranglerâ€”open SystemVersion.plist.

Locate the ProductVersion key (not the ProductUserVisibleVersion key). Just below that is a string of numbers indicating the OS version; for example, on a Mac running OS X 10.5.8, it will read 10.5.8.

Change that number to 10.6.6 (or 10.6.7 or 10.6.8), save the file (providing your admin-level username and password when prompted), and then shut down your Mac."

,Dannieloco,2011-11-26T03:14Z,"OSX LION was built to be installed as an upgrade to Snow Leopard. You should back up your files (just in case) and then run the upgrade from your desktop. It takes about 30-45 mins to complete and all your settings and files should still be there. Some programs may not work properly, so just update them and chances are theres an update to make it compatible with lion. You shouldnt have a problem with ur mac if you install lion this way... 

If you run a clean install, you're going to have to take the dmg file found inside the .app and burn that to a CD and then install lion that way. "

,IDunnoIDe,2012-04-13T20:21Z,You can use transmac (15 day trial) to burn/write the .dmg to a disc or flash drive. It is much easier to create an un-needed Windows XP Virtual Machine. I use transmac all the time. Never failed me.
