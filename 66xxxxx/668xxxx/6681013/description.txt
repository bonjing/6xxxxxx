A Word About Graphics Cards

In short, CINEMA 4D and BodyPaint 3D run on any OpenGL-capable graphics card (which includes the vast majority available in the past 10 years). We do however strongly recommend using a dedicated 3D graphics card with a chipset from AMD or NVIDIA. Currently, powerful graphics chips are also available on mid-range notebooks.
Always make sure to use the latest drivers. Newer drivers are usually faster and more stable.
If you're looking for speed comparisons, conduct a search for CINEBENCH scores on the internet.
Disclaimer: MAXON cannot be held liable for the compatibility of specific graphics cards with the Enhanced OpenGL mode. Due to the amount of possible combinations of graphic chipsets, operating systems and driver revisions, it is impossible to guarantee the operation on all systems. Also, technical specifications in MAXON products are subject to change. Please use the most current demo version of CINEMA 4D oder BodyPaint 3D to test the compatibilty on a specific system.
 

A Word About NVIDIA 3D Vision

If you intend to use NVIDIA's 3D Vision shutter glasses for your stereoscopic experience please note that a quad buffered graphics card is required for use in conjunction with CINEMA 4D.
A list of graphics cards that support the neccesary features can be found at NVIDIA's website:

CINEMA 4D STUDIO - EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR HIGH-END 3D


CINEMA 4D Studio is the very best that MAXON has to offer for professional 3D artists. If you want to create advanced 3D graphics but need a helping hand to ensure you create jaw-dropping graphics quickly and easily, then this is the choice for you.
As well as containing all of the features found in CINEMA 4D Prime, Visualize and Broadcast, CINEMA 4D Studio adds advanced character tools, hair, a physics engine and an unlimited clients network for rendering. The result is that CINEMA 4D Studio can tackle any project you throw at it with ease.

CINEMA 4D Studio's character tools make it easy to create character rigs and advanced character animations. Adding hair or fur to characters is fast and simple with a powerful suite of hair tools that you can grow, comb, style and animate. The physics engine, which was overhauled in R12, makes it simple to perform complex collisions and interaction between objects, be it just a few or thousands. Network rendering allows you to take advantage of all computers on your network to help render your animations faster.

Despite being designed for advanced 3D, the extra tools found in CINEMA 4D Studio are still designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Generating advanced 3D effects such as hair is surprisingly easy and fast, with CINEMA 4D doing much of the work for you. For example, hair will automatically swoosh and sway as you move your character around; and making thousands of objects collide with each other only takes a few mouse clicks to set up.

CINEMA 4D Studio lets you unleash your creativity and enjoy 3D without limits.

BODYPAINT 3D - FOR ALL YOUR 3D PAINTING NEEDS


Wouldn't it be great if you could have all your favorite image editing tools in a single 3D environment? Wouldn't it be great if they worked in conjunction with your 3D application rather than against it? Well, that is exactly what BodyPaint 3D does!
Wave goodbye to UV seams, inaccurate texturing and constant back-and-forth switching to your 2D image editor. Say hello to hassle-free texturing that lets you quickly paint highly detailed textures directly on your 3D objects.

When it comes to texturing tools, BodyPaint 3D is packed with a huge array of popular image editing tools. Brushes, selection tools, filters, erasers and much more. It can even utilize Photoshop .abr brushes. Full support for tablets ensures that painting with a pen feels just as natural as it does in popular 2D image editors. And of course BodyPaint 3D can deal with image files as large as 16k and with 16-bit and 32-bit color depth.

Compared to 2D painting, perhaps the most exciting feature BodyPaint 3D offers is projection painting. This powerful mode eliminates the need to spend hours creating perfect UV maps. You simply paint what you would like to see on your 3D model, apply the projection and then BodyPaint 3D will quickly adjust your painting so it fits your UVs perfectly - even if there are differing UV sizes and seems.

BodyPaint 3D was created for all 3D artists and includes free plugins to connect with 3ds Max, Maya, Softimage and LightWave 3D. All other applications can exchange files with BodyPaint 3D using one of the numerous available file formats (e.g. OBJ, FBX or COLLADA).
