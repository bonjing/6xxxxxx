,BlowBye,2011-10-07T13:03Z,"Downloaded real fast. One thingh though, some of the files in the GreyScaleGorilla.zip-file are password protected, anyone have the PW?"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-10-07T18:40Z,"1st if you don't have the character stuff you didn't read the instructions good enough (as they come with studio and its explained how to get studio) 
2nd lol wut the fuge I never added a password but email me and I'll email you back with the GSG kits :P"
,alienmode,2011-10-07T22:51Z,sketch & toon module is missing :(
,BlowBye,2011-10-12T14:35Z,Does anyone know what is needed to activate Sketch and Toon?
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-10-18T16:56Z,.... :\ sketch and toon should be there as its installed with studio... 
,BlowBye,2011-10-22T02:23Z,"First and foremost, this is an excellent torrent.

Sure, Sketch and Toon does not load as a default but that does not alter the fact that this is an excellent torrent but since we're on the subject:
 - Sketch and Toon should be a render option within Cinema 4D.
 - It's normally found under ""Render"" - ""Edit Render Settings..."" and then under ""Stereoscopic"" to the left but that's somehow not the case with this torrent.

As far as I'm concerned it's not at all a big deal for a very high quality freebie like this. Thing is that the functionlity of Sketch and Toon is there (check ""C:\Program Files\MAXON\CINEMA 4D R13\modules\sketch"" and load ""defaults.c4d"") so if someone knows how to activate it as a default to be available for any project, please get back here. It would really be an extra bonus."
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-10-22T21:49Z,@BlowBye nicely said 
,bonux_active,2011-10-24T12:15Z,is it a broadcast version?
,bonux_active,2011-10-25T15:52Z,"sorry. my bad, didnt read the instructions properly.
thankyou!"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-10-28T01:18Z,"haha yeah tell me something.... (you should see my inbox XD) ""hey I only have boadcast what the fudge man YOU PROMIsT STudIO Ø.ô"" fucking annoying though if you are anal-fabatic (or whatever) I'm happy to answer you questions ;] though:
PLEASE READ FIRST THEN ASK!!!

thank you :P"
,ocdar,2011-10-31T11:57Z,"Hi.. Thank you very much for this torrent...!
Why when I Launch C4D, it's the BRAODCAST version and not THE SUDIO..?"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-10-31T13:03Z,"this:

""to install: 
just fill in your information in the installation windowâ€¦ (name â€¦ company.. etc.) and copy these serials in:

14300092167-RFMD-NHJF-DMDM-WLVG
15300017603-XNPK-KBMV-JTCD-HPLS
16300092515-RPGT-NVTW-XBHF-PZCR
10300012999-MWFJ-TMVW-JJHZ-KNJK
30300090060-NWDH-KSJX-GSMX-BGNN
11300030622-GFFH-TPVV-RFSR-HJLX

if you've got broadcast, prime, etc.  instead of studio, inside C4d go to help/personalize and paste these serials in:

14300013911-WJWD-KMLC-TZZR-NHTZ
14300080731-RDTC-DVRR-DCDX-KJCL
14300092988-MSND-PPFW-KNFG-PRMM
14300019562-TTFN-SCXX-TRZD-BSMJ

restart, you should have R13 studio now

have funâ€¦ 

any questions? ask away! email = dontuspammenow@hotmail.com""

is directly from the instructions file....

One question - (Win7) Has anyone installed this while keeping an older version on the same machine? I've got 11.5 now and it runs great. Not sure if I should uninstall it first before installing 13 - or if I can run both 11.5 and 13. 

Any thoughts?

Thanks again KC! "
