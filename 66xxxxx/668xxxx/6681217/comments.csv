,shiver24,2011-09-17T04:25Z,"I use TV.com to name my files; they list is as Season 3. 

And the MKV container was used for my personal DNLA server, it just works better with that file extension, even though it shouldn't matter.

If you want the mp4 just open it up and take it out of the MKV container."
,MasterJ8r,2011-09-17T08:42Z,"First, thanks for the torrent. Second, http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&q=archer
IMDB confirms season 3. Third, http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/how_to_play_mkv_content_on_xbox_360.cfm 
A guide for converting MKV to MP4 for n00bs. And you can simply rename the file extension to AVI to play on a 360."

,Dave_pingu,2011-09-19T04:42Z,"so is this season 3 episode 1
heart of archness part 1
or what?"
,namshub,2011-09-19T06:06Z,"Why - since it's an MKV format video container - is it so damn huge?

I have seasons 1 & 2 of Archer, with all episodes H.264 1280 x 720, and each episode only takes up 90MB.

Why on Earth is this 580MB? That's HUGE - 6X the size of the largest MKV's I've DL'ed. The MKV format files I have *MAX* at 6MB/min. This is over 26MB/min.

Why?! Oh dear god why!? WHY!?!?!?!

,sardy,2011-09-19T06:58Z,"It is S03E01, but there were other torrents of this same episode labeled as S02E14 - so if you already grabbed one of those, you have this episode already.

 It's the first episode of what the Archer website is calling the ""3 Part Special Assignment"", here's the info on it:

Episode: Heart of Archness: Part I
Synopsis:
 Archer, in hiding since the murder of his fiancĂÂŠe, is finally tracked down in the South Pacific by handsome adventurer Rip Riley. To get Archer safely back to ISIS, Riley will have to survive the elements, a plane crash, a shark attack, starvation, drowning, exposure, and possibly pirates. Oh, and Archer."
,stangace,2011-09-23T08:20Z,"this is not part of season 3, this is a 3-part special that is still technically part of season 2.

It's basically an OVA, for anyone familiar w/ anime.

The OFFICIAL season 3 won't air untill early 2012

... but that's wrong.  You appear to misunderstand some of the fundamental concepts involved. "
