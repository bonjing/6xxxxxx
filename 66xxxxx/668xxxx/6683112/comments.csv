,Zpectro,2011-09-18T15:26Z,are there english subs for this?
,doktorslecht,2011-09-19T09:50Z,It's better to get anime from fansubbers instead of sites like this. Try http://www.nyaa.eu
,Zpectro,2011-09-19T15:48Z,well the fansubbers take 6-7 months to make a fansub of a movie :F
,doktorslecht,2011-09-19T16:24Z,"That's not true, some of them release fansubs in less than a day. It all depends on how known this is, this is just a RAW. I'm pretty sure a team will pick it up soon enough."
,trippay,2011-09-22T18:56Z,"no group has done this yet, so i'm afraid the BR/DVDrips are all that's available right now."
,trippay,2011-09-22T18:58Z,keep checking anidb.net for updates on re-encodes/fansubs.  
,Ssschhhh,2011-09-24T21:13Z,The BD has worldwide subs so there's no need for fansubs. If only the ripper had included them...
