Setting expectations this download comes with video files PART 1 and PART 2 and video is not clear but again this is the only upload and i believe malikjee4 had tried his best to get this far. Thanks again malikjee4. I had seen on TV long back and I enjoyed watching again this though video wasnt that clear.
Well malikjee4 is well known to upload classic cinema and each one of them are jem and so do this MITR, who says that big money is needed to make good cinema, all u need is a good script with good actors in hand of a director having vision and who knows what he is directing.

@ malikjee4: Thanks a lot... :)
