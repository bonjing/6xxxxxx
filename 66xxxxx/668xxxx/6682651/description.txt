Boston, MA trio Revocation is comprised of vocalist/guitarist David Davidson, vocalist/bassist Anthony Buda, and drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne - all of whom showcase incredible dexterity at their chosen instruments, even by heavy metal standards, and came together as a group in 2005. Armed with a super-technical thrash/death metal style prizing virtuosity as much as heaviness and aggression, the group soon began attracting A&R men from numerous labels with their self-released Summon the Spawn EP (2006) and Empire of the Obscene album (2008). They eventually decided to sign with Relapse Records, and delivered their second full-length, Existence Is Futile, in September 2009, also to very positive reviews.  Chaos of Forms followed in August of 2011.
