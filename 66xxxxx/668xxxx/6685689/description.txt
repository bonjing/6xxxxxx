These are all the subtitle files needed for the Blu-ray rips of
Star Wars Eps I - VI that are available now.

Episodes III and V do not have any Alien Dialogue so do not require Subtitles.

These files will provide you with sub-titles for the sections where aliens speak in there own dialogue. (Example being the Han Solo/Greedo section in Episode IV)

These have been tested working with these releases on Pirate Bay...
