[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-18T08:00Z,@puli9 - Am not sure. Why not try and let us know. Cause I do not have Black box's rip.
,cockus,2011-09-19T18:39Z,"Unfortunately whenever I try to run the game it gives me an error saying ""steam must be installed."""
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-09-20T11:03Z,@cockus This Crack Update was tested and works on my torrent of Dead Island. If you followed the instructions on my Dead Island Torrent. Then used this Crack Update it should work. If not you are doing something wrong.

,xsaa,2011-10-09T15:32Z,"i have downloaded this game from both of your uploads
1. i mount it with dtool
2. i use the steambackup2.exe to extract files to my steam game file which is ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common""
3. copy and replace all files from crack folder from the disk image to the root folder of dead island.
4. copy and replace all files i downloaded from this torrent to the root folder of dead island.
5. add dead island to steam game list
6. start the game with ""deadislandgame.exe"" while steam is running.

7. >>>>>>I cant save my progression"
,xsaa,2011-10-09T15:33Z,7. >>>>>>I cant save my progression
,xsaa,2011-10-09T15:34Z,"I cant save my progression
every time i restart the game, all my info, achievement, records, check points are wiped.

am i doing any thing wrong?
i guess i m the unlucky one after all?"
,xsaa,2011-10-09T22:40Z,"oooooooooooooooookkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

i just manage a sort of solusion for my particular problem.

i realised my progression data (the ""out"" folder) is generated in the 
""Steam\steamapps\common\Dead Island\DI""
folder, which is not looking right.
I manually copy and replace all of them to 
""Steam\steamapps\common\Dead Island\out""
which works, so far no problem.

i dont know why is this happening, it looks like some kind of script error to me, and it seems i m the only few who are bringing this up huh?

anyway thanks for the upload"
,xsaa,2011-10-09T22:45Z,"btw
by ""my progression data (the ""out"" folder) is generated in the wrong folder"" i mean i did all the cracking copy and replace thing right, and i do hav an empty ""out"" folder at the root dead island folder.
before i enter the game for the first time, there is no ""out"" folder in deadisland/di folder.
the problem is the system automatically genrerate the ""out"" folder to deadisland/di

hope this help someone else out there."
,Ibrahim001,2011-10-11T16:13Z,HOW COME IT DOWNLOADS 1/KB PER SECOND?????
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-12T13:36Z,"@xsaa - This works with my Dead island copy. Remember you must follow the instructions on my dead island copy for it to work. Just using this crack will not work. You need to put both in. You may have to install again. As we have retested many times and are unable to come accross these errors you are all having. If its win 7 am unable to help there. 

@Ibrahim001 - again I am seeding at what I can. To the others that are seeding I can say if they are limiting there lines."
,xsaa,2011-10-14T07:22Z,"@ServiusTheBear

ok this reminded me, i m running win7, thats probably y.

anyway I end up playing this game ok, no further error."
,v1d3ru5,2011-10-24T16:36Z,"@xsaa How exactly did you fix the out folder problem? The same thing is happening to me, and nothing I've tried works."
,v1d3ru5,2011-11-02T15:23Z,"Nevermind, problem fixed. I don't know what I did, but it worked."
,Rando68,2011-11-26T20:21Z,"Hey uh. No seeders or leechers are coming up for me when I go to DL this. Am I glitching, or is the tracker wrong?"
,Rando68,2011-11-26T20:31Z,"Fixed, just restarted Vuze. xD
Pro-tip: When in doubt, RESTART!"
,pickle43,2012-01-07T10:21Z,seed plz
