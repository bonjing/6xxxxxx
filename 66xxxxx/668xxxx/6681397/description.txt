The Guard (2011) is an Irish black comedy film written and directed by John Michael McDonagh, and starring Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle.[1][2] It is the most successful independent Irish film of all time in terms of box-office receipts, overtaking The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006) which previously held this status.
