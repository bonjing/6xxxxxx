I was in the pirate bay IRC channel and I gave a moderator the link to your account and asked that you be considered for VIP.  The mod said your seeds are good but it would be helpful for you to add track listings, artist bios and more information like bit rate etc to the descriptions of your torrents. 

At any rate keep up the good work and I'm sure you'll be promoted eventually.

Peace,

politux"
