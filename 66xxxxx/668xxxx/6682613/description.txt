Waterborne (2005)

A biological act of terror has been unleashed upon Los Angeles, and as the denizens of the West Coast metropolis are bombarded with news stories documenting the contamination of the city's water supply, turmoil grips the panic-stricken streets in director Ben Rekhi's dark speculative drama. With resources quickly shrinking and the stress of the terrified population reaching a breaking point, the face of humanity turns foul as civility takes a back seat to survival instinct and the only thing that counts is getting out alive.
