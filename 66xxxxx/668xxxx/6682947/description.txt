Martin Shaw takes on the role of PD James' Adam Dalgliesh, one of the greatest detectives of English fiction. Dalgliesh is now a Commander at Scotland Yard, running a squad dealing with sensitive, unsolved crimes. A reclusive widower whose wife died during childbirth, the intense, solitary detective is nevertheless a ruthless pursuer of truth - his emotional detachment aiding his innate ability to crack the most complex of cases.

When one of the young ordinands at St Anselm's theological college dies under suspicious circumstances, Dalgliesh returns to one of his boyhood haunts. Soon he finds the happy memories of his youth superseded by a series of frenzied murders.
