 Every once in a while it happens. You hit play, slowly raise the 
 volume, let the beats take over. Until suddenly..it HITS you! And you 
 knowÅ¯this is something that deserves to be kept exclusive. And so, 
 the A&RÄºs of Armada Music decided to start a new series: Armada 
 Exclusive Tracks & Remixes. In this special pack, youÄºll find the 
 hidden gems, the productions that have now been unlocked to do what 
 theyÄºre made for: get under your skin, rock the dance floor and 
 simply move you. 

 Volume 2 of the series kicks off with the previously unheard Moar 
 Levi Remix of Armin van BuurenÄºs Ä¹RainÄº. ItÄºs proggy, soothing and 
 makes this Cathy Burton collab shine a new light. Romanian producer 
 Adrian Ivan, also known as Mr. Pit, brings in another new moniker, 
 Adiva. He hands in a mix of rousing big room prog and melodic, 
 synth-driven breaks with Ä¹OxygenÄº, a tune with a special feel to it. 
 Walsh & McAuley present a tender, but energetic tune called 
 Ä¹TransmissionÄº and Ukrainian producer talent Dart Rayne reveals an 
 anthem that rides nothing but uplifting bliss, Ä¹Espada RoperaÄº. Last 
 but not least, DNS Project and Fast Distance go down the path of 
 scintillating prog-trance with a track named Ä¹KickdownÄº. 

 But thereÄºs much more! House master Sharam Jey sees a new remix of 
 his track Ä¹The More That I DoÄº. The Arkadia remix of this banger is 
 an easy-going prog-house track with trancy influences. Finnish 
 producer Sean Bayer gave one of tranceÄºs biggest classics, Ä¹Solid 
 Globe Ä¾ North PoleÄº a 2011 update, with a contagious prog-trance 
 swing. CapstarÄºs Ä¹Do It EasyÄº was given a new 2011 treatment by 
 Capstar himself! Ä¹Do It EasyÄº now rides a deep, electrifying sound 
 thatÄºll madden the clubbers. Eddie Bitar, who just released a new 
 single on VANDIT, now presents a strong trancer with a mysterious 
 sound to it, Ä¹DriftÄº. Exit vs Kent & Gian have the honour of giving 
 the Exclusive pack a banging conclusion, with the techy trance 
 Ä¹PURAÄº. 

 And so here we are, presenting you 10 beautiful tracks and remixes. 
 Brand new, unheard and ready to get into your skin!
