,Mercyflush64,2011-09-20T05:57Z,Having a strange issue with this one all of a sudden. Was chugging along just fine like all of the others when I neede to format my computer. Moved this and three others I was seeding to a different drive and reloaded windows. Done this before so no big deal. Started up again and now every few minutes I get an access denied error. I start it up again and it runs fine. Sometimes to stops after a couple minutes and sometimes it goes longer. Any ideas or did I not setup utorrent correctly?
