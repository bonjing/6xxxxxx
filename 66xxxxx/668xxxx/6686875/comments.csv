,NFL_in_OZ,2011-09-20T00:12Z,"best nfl torrent i've found so far great copy and good file sizes so it doesn't overload VLCplayer.

What program do you normally use for the 2GB+ games? my VLC craps out trying to play them"
,nflfan,2011-09-20T08:38Z,"@NFL_in_OZ
KM Player handles larger files with no problem. I think it's  a better player all round than VLC.

I agree about the smaller files. They're a lot more convenient - quicker to download, take up less space and play easier."
,unclebio,2011-09-20T21:29Z,"Liked the quality, nice!
Are you going to upload any other games from this week also? Would be great!"
,Manila2011,2011-09-24T01:56Z,"Hi pretty_vacant
