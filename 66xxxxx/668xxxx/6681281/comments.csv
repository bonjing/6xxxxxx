,RyanNZ666,2011-12-06T06:47Z,"Can you please Load your other UKF Drum and bass 2011 Compilation off piratebay.ee it's sick bro and we need it badly for our new years playlist.

Legend mate!"
,Djuxy,2012-01-25T18:44Z,"Could/Would you upload everything from UKF Drum and Bass, from date stated here up until now.There are some great song`s and remixes released.Thx in advance."
,SoKwik,2012-03-28T04:52Z,"A few songs here and there that don't sound like its 320 kbp, but overall the quality is excellent. 

The problem I have is how almost every song fades away before it ends. Sometimes it fades as the drop comes in, sometimes mid-lyric. They have begun to sound like previews to me, and feels like 2.78 GBs of tease. 

It's amazing how much music you've compiled here, and I thank you for that. Still worth the download."
,c0rnb33f,2012-06-06T10:46Z,"Can you plz upload the two other UKF channels, UKF music and UKF mixes?"
