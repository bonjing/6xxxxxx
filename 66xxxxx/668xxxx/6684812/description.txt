Story
====== 

22 17 "Stronger, Faster"[15][16] Shaunt Nigoghossian Mairghread Scott September 17, 2011 August 14, 2011 122 

Ratchet endeavored to complete the synthetic energon formula and finally seemed to succeed, running a test engine on the stuff. 
Wanting to do more for the Autobot cause, he injected the substance into himself as a test. Perhaps almost to his surprise, 
it worked. In fact, it worked so well that when Arcee got into trouble on a mission, he went out into the field himself and trashed 
an entire squad of Vehicons on his own. He excitedly showed the other Autobots what he had done, though Optimus was disappointed 
in his actions. Ratchet still felt strong, even accidentally throwing Bulkhead through a wall. He went on to inject himself with 
more synthetic energon, before inviting himself along on the Autobots' next mission. His vigorous interrogation of a miner and 
subsequent attempt to extinguish the Decepticon led to Optimus giving him a lecture. He accused Optimus of not being pro-active
 enough in their campaign against the Decepticons, and went off to confront Megatron on his own. Reaching the Decepticon energon mine,
 Ratchet made short work of Breakdown, but Megatron proved more formidable than expected, and Ratchet was seriously injured and left 
to Knock Out's tender mercies. After Knock Out took a sample of the synthetic energon, Ratchet managed to raise enough strength to 
fight back, and managed to destroy the sample. The other Autobots rescued him, though he had lost a lot of energon and had to be 
hooked up to a drip. Ratchet apologized for his behavior, though at least they'd gained a supply of real energon out of it.
 Meanwhile, back at the mine Knock Out finds dripping liquid, a sample of the synthetic energon.

Note: This episode is the continuation of the previous episode, "T.M.I."

Reference: When Ratchet blinds a Decepticon with a blow torch, this is a reference to what Mikaela Banes did to Wheelie, 
in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. This episode is somewhat similar to the Transformers: Beast Wars episode "Gorilla Warfare", 
where Optimus Primal is made hyper-aggressive by Scorponok's modified Cyberbee.

Fact #1: Raf is the only human to appear in this episode.

Fact #2: Starscream is absent for the fourth time in this episode.
