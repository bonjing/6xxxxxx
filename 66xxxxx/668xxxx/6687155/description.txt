This out-of-print 1996 Columbia Masterworks Heritage CD MHK 62837 comprises most of the recorded performances of the Thomas Schippers conducting the works of his mentor, Samuel Barber. Schippers, considered by many to be the best interpreter of Barber's work, died of lung cancer at 47, and these recordings, with the New York Philharmonic and Columbia Symphony from the late 1950s and early 1960s, are among his best. The original LP included Barber's Adagio for Strings and Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance (in probably the best recorded performances of those works) as well as a rollicking Overture to The School for Scandal and the Second Essay for Orchestra. To fill out the CD, Columbia added other Barber works from Schippers other recordings, along with his performances of Menotti, Berg and D'Indy. 

"Superbly beautiful performances...The playing is radiant, the music's romanticism superbly expansive yet discreetly controlled. And the recorded sound is perfection from the work go" - Hi-Fi/Stereo Review.
