  INFO

  Recabinet is the worldâ€™s ultimate cabinet simulator, launched  in  2008 as the most 
  comprehensive speaker cabinet   impulse response library on the market. Since then,
  it  has  become  a  secret  weapon of  major  artists and   producers such as Steve 
  Stevens, Vernon Reid, Devildriver, and Ill Nino.

  In 2011, with Recabinet 3, it is a full-fledged, self-contained solution â€“ an audio
  FX plugin for VST, AU, and    RTAS formats for  Mac OS X  and Windows. It offers 20 
  virtual  cabinets,  8  virtual mics, and  2  internal  channels  with the  British-
  inspired Kazrog Konsole EQ,  specifically voiced  for making guitar and bass tracks 
  come  alive.  Best  of  all,  you  can  blend  any cabinet and  microphone/position 
  combination with 100% phase coherency â€“ breaking   the laws of physics!

  Recabinet 3 makes  it  fast and easy  to find  inspiring  new sounds,  avoiding the 
  hassle  of complex mixer  routing   and  folder  navigation associated with impulse 
  response libraries.  It also  ships with ready-to-rock  factory  presets, with more 
  on the way from major artists and producers.

  Add Recabinet 3 in the signal  chain after your favorite analog guitar amp, or your 
  favorite software amp     simulator (with cabinet simulation disabled) and you will
  experience  a   dramatic  improvement  in  the  realism  of   your  guitar  tracks. 
  Recabinet 3  changes  the  proverbial  game, giving you  album-quality  guitar tone 
  direct, faster and easier than ever before.

  enable/disable an EQ band.

  â€¢ All EQ and volume adjustments are now available in Hz and dB as tooltips when you 
  hover the mouse over a knob.

  â€¢ All knobs in the plugin interface can be double-clicked to reset to their default 
  positions.

  â€¢ Pro Tools:  Fixed  a  bug where sessions  in  sample rates other  than 44.1 could 
  create warped audio output until the plugin interface was opened.

  â€¢ Cubase:  Fixed  a  bug where  high  instance counts of Recabinet 3 crashed Cubase 
  during repeated batch exports.
