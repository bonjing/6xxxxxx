And how long do we have to listen to him crow about his book?  I love the, enough of me talking about my book, what do you think of my book, routine..  Then the schill callers lining up one after another telling him how great he is..  I truly, truly miss the old Mike.. The one who is not censored every other word, and who doesn't fall over himself  every time a  minority calls.  The one who got mad at the things we got mad at and didn't have fake ""guests"" on selling us things.  Talk about The Emperor's New Clothes, i'll be the one to say it.. His new book sounds like it was written by an 8 year old.  And is about as deep as paint."

I am also tired of the book talk already but if we called him on it I think the old Mike would come back in spades! LOL! I have never written a book so maybe he's just proud of it. No matter the change, I can't stop listening to him! I am glad you guys download in any event. I often wonder how many people actually download my posts? Doesn't matter, I am glad to have you guys! Have a great weekend."
