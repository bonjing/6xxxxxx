There are hyper-detailed aprons and runway and grass and trees so realistic you would swear that you're actually there. 1WA6 is a unique private airport surrounded by beautiful homes, some whose access is by crossing the main runway. With the world famous Snoqualmie Falls nearby, it is a wonderfully picturesque setting.
