,galemann.,2011-10-29T12:37Z,"You think you could rip the Norwegian subtitles from the Alien movies and post them as .SRT files on Norsub.com ??? On all ABC-Team releases i download the subtitles wont work when i play them from my NAS.., They show for about half a minute then they just wont display anymore unless i change subtitle language and switch back, but who want to do that the entire movie.., All ABC-Team releases i've seen are great, so this is really sad, and i would truly appreciate these subs as separate .srt files as i know that would work.., :)"
,galemann.,2011-10-29T12:44Z,"Acctually All the Norwegian subs from ABC-Team releases deserves a Norsub.com post as good subs for good movies are always needed... Just something to think about.., You could be a top subtitle uploader in no time with all them ABC-Team releases you put up here.. ;) For now though i'll settle for the 4 alien movies.., >:)"
