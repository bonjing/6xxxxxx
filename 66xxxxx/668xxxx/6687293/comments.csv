1.) Put the disc in. 
2.) Wait for the error message. 
3.) Go into the diagnostic menu by pressing and holding Menu, Map and Back simultaneously. 
4.) Select Version and press OK (push the big joystick in). 
5.) Select Download and press OK. 
6.) Then wait for the download (couple of minutes), the satnav will reboot and you are done."

Best of all; Croatia and Slovenia are now on the map and I dont need to use my iphone with tomtom next time I'm on holiday there! 
Nice Thanx to the uploader."

But Disk Code + Access code (20 digits - is printed on the inside of Update package) are required. Gizmok, if you have all these details please share it."
