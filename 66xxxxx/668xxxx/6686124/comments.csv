,stevie.c,2011-09-21T23:53Z,"Does anyone know how I can seed faster? I have very quick internet, yet I'm only seeding each torrent at like 40 kbps? I have my upload max set to 0 (unlimited) so I don't know what else to do. If anyone else knows, please help me out. I'd like to upload these torrents for you as fast as possible. Thanks! :)"
,Pirate_P,2011-10-08T12:33Z,"If your using uTorrent go to ""Options"", ""Preferences"", on the left select ""Bandwidth"".

0 = unlimited

At the top you will see ""Maximum upload rate""
If you enter 0 it will use as much of your connection as possible. "
,Pirate_P,2011-10-08T12:36Z,"Check your firewall and open the port your bittorent client is using. If your router has UPnP enabled you may not need to open the port.

Also your router can have a throttling effect if it has a hard time keeping up with the many connections a torrent makes. "
,Pirate_P,2011-10-12T01:49Z,"I do not see any seeds. :-(  
It sounds like your having a hard time uploading. 

For fast seeding Google ""seedbox"".

A seedbox is a dedicated server used for uploading with a throughput of 100 Mbit/s +.

Just watched a few episodes. Very Funny :-)"
,stevie.c,2011-10-13T07:57Z,Thanks everyone. I've been waiting for some feedback. Sorry it wasn't seeding for the day. My computer shut down for some reason and I didn't know it til just now cuz I haven't been on it. I really do appreciate the feedback. I'll try and do that so I can't get these seeding for you faster. :)
