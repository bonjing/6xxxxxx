,n.m.,2011-09-21T16:36Z,"I'm sure ""dreampolice"" is an old friend of Numan's trying to stop the illegal downloading.  The file is fine, I downloaded it while I'm waiting for my physical CD to arrive that I bought from his online store.  

Please support Numan...we need him to keep making us music!!!
