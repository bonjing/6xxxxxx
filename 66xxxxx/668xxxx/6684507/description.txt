Austin Stevens - Snakemaster aka Adventues.
Episode 14 - In Seach of the Black Mamba

Unusually, a Black Mamba has been spotted in the Namibian Desert, and environment 500 miles away from the species' known range; the snake is also known for shunning such desert environments. Stevens investigates this sighting and finds the snake. Because the snake is not used to such a hostile environment, he bags it to be relocated to a more suitable habitat. Past encounters of snakes from past episodes are also discussed.

This episode is not in the HD quality that all of my other Austin Stevens uploads are - but it does the job. I have been looking for this episode for a long time, and I'm happy to be able to share it with everyone. Truly a great episode, with recaps from previous episodes also.
