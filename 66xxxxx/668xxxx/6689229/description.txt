It's rare to see two marquee-name composers credited for a score, but perhaps two people were needed to come up with something that would stand up to the memory of Danny Elfman's work on the 1989 Batman. Just as director Christopher Nolan's back-in-black approach is quite different from Tim Burton's phantasmagorical one, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's take doesn't bear much kinship to Elfman's. (You'd be hard-pressed to find any recognizable theme here, for instance.) Mostly the composers remain conservatively subtle, though coming up with the expected pounding on grandiose, action-y selections such as "Myotis" and "Antrozous" (no, the poetic-sounding track names aren't lifted from old Cocteau Twins records but refer to various types of bats). Stand-out track "Tadarida" incorporates some of the distorted vocal effects associated with the Scarecrow's drug-induced nightmarish visions. Atmospheric to the point of evanescence sometime, the individual tracks tend to meld into each other after a while. The sense of stylistic continuity helps establish an overall mood, but sometimes it's hard to distinguish between shades of black.
