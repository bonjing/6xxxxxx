,johnluis,2011-09-18T16:52Z,"looks like this is a false download- extract only opens to a web page.
what am i doing wrong or did you do wrong"
,reflexes,2011-09-19T16:56Z,"it is not false my friend..\

i have downloaded it from someone's blog and i have found it proper to include the link in the rar file ALONG WITH the economist files so that i wud acknowledge and let u know the original uploader...

i am just sharing it via torrent..
feel free to avoid it if u are suspicious.. but i have listened to it and its still in my cell."
,johnluis,2011-09-22T03:37Z,"i'll have to skip this weeks news, because i dont understand how to use this torrent. previously, i've listened to many weeks of the economist audio edition, but your upload only leads to a web page link that i dont know how to download from, or if it is bieng downloaded, to what file on my computer it is stored.
