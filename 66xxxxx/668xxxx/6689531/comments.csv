I have my upload max set to 0 (unlimited) so I don't know what else to do. If anyone else knows, please help me out. I'd like to upload these torrents for you as fast as possible. Thanks! :)"
,kimok1,2011-10-23T18:22Z,Thank you so much for your generosity! This down-loaded pretty quickly considering the size. I will be seeding back!

,stevie.c,2011-10-26T07:30Z,"Kimoki1, You are very welcome. I hope you enjoy the shows. It's definitely a classic. :) I've downloaded so much stuff off of here I decided it was time me to start uploading and giving back. I barely ever download now. Just so people can't get everything as quick as possible. Also, thanks for seeding. That helps everyone a great deal. Take care!"

,stevie.c,2012-01-03T03:44Z,"Thanks geoffy23 and you are most welcome. Hopefully I can start uploading more stuff. My portable 1.5 TB hard drive crashed and I lost a ton of movies and TV series. And Audreyxbutterfly, I haven't experienced that problem. Let me know if anyone else has and I'll re-up those episodes for you. :) Sorry it's taken me so long to reply. I moved and it took forever to get my internet back. Thank you all for downloading. Enjoy!!"

It's bad there, It's bad here"
