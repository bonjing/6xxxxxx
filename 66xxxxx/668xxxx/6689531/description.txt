These are all five seasons. Every episode is accounted for and is great quality. I also organized them very well, as I do all of my series. I love older shows so I plan to upload a bunch more of them. I hope you all enjoy these as much as I have. Please seed for a bit if you can. Thank you very much. Also, any suggestions, please let me know. I'm new to creating and uploading torrents so I want to make sure I'm doing a good job. I just wanted to give back to everyone, so I'm only uploading from now on. No more downloading. Enjoy!!! :)
