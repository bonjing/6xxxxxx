Quote:
Neighborhoods is the sixth studio
album by the American pop
punk band Blink-182, scheduled
for release September 27, 2011
through Geffen Records. Their
first album of new material in
eight years, its recording
followed the band's 2009
reunion after a four-year hiatus.
It will be the first Blink-182
album produced by the band
members without the help of an
outside record producer.
The album has suffered
numerous delays. Although
several demos were recorded in
2009, work on the album began
in earnest in June 2010. In April
2011 the band cancelled a
European tour, as recording of
the album was taking longer
than expected. As a result,
Geffen Records gave the band a
July 31 deadline. The record's
first single, "Up All Night",
premiered July 14, 2011; the
second single, "After Midnight",
premiered September 6.
Blink-182 is an American rock
band from Poway, California that
predominantly plays pop punk
music. The band was formed in
1992 as "Blink" with members
Tom DeLonge (vocals, guitar),
Mark Hoppus (vocals, bass) and
Scott Raynor (drums). In 1998,
midway through a U.S. tour,
drummer Travis Barker replaced
Raynor. DeLonge left the group
in early 2005, initiating an
indefinite hiatus. DeLonge went
on to form Angels & Airwaves,
while Hoppus and Barker
continued playing music together
in +44. On February 8, 2009,
Blink-182 announced that they
are continuing as a band, with
the brief statement posted on
their website saying "To put it
simply, We're back. We mean,
really back. Picking up where we
left off and then some. In the
studio writing and recording a
new album," which followed
minutes after the Grammy
announcement.
DeLonge cites punk rock bands
Descendents and Screeching
Weasel as influences, although
the band's songwriting and
production are driven by a pop
sensibility. Blink-182 is known for
their simple melodies, teen angst
and lyrical toilet humor, as well
as by their hit singles "Dammit",
"What's My Age Again?", "All the
Small Things", "Adam's Song",
"The Rock Show", "First Date",
"Stay Together for the Kids",
"Feeling This", and "I Miss You".
When playing live, the band
typically play their songs at a
faster tempo and often replace
certain lyrics with toilet humor
and various gags. Over the years,
the band has developed a
dedicated cult following, and
continues to influence a variety
of musical acts.
