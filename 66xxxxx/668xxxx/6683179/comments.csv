,nwo777,2012-02-26T12:56Z,"It makes no sense to me, how can a world with so much obvious intellectual design  'come from nothing'  anyone who has done some basic biology or science about the world we live in knows that it did not just grow out of nothing!

,nwo777,2012-02-26T13:18Z,"There is no hard evidence for what is said by Lawrence, he just speculates and pulls rubbish out of his hat.  Let face it Richard Dawkins refuses to do public debates, if he was so sure of what he says he believes why not face the critics and debate them .... come on Richard!
If you want something to watch that is factual and shows hard evidence take a look at

You believe in the bible, i checked out your links, oprah? really? anyway, your wrong about dawkins' inability to back up what he claims, he does so in length over many different progrms a lot are available online in many different formats. Creation came from basically nothing, meaning gravity and oxygen and small particles and a few other bits and pieces, thats why it's a miracle. It cannot have been painted and put together in a tool shed by an old man in a robe who looked at his craftiness on the 6th day while he rested and said, shit i better scatter some bones here and there really big one's and let them fight over where the fck they came from. Didn't happen. Instead of asking Dawkins to prove he is right, why don't you ask yourself what makes you so deluded as to think YOU are.
Your not, may you rot like the rest of us, at least i'm cool with that"
