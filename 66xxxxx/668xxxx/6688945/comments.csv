,severed1314,2011-09-20T14:39Z,Yes. I always wait a few weeks and watch it in the stash uncensored. Usually a Saturday at 1am. It's worth it.
,harblonia,2011-09-20T18:18Z,">implying that the bit of censoring this roast underwent has in any way ruined the funny.

Seems like the only thing they really censored was ""cock"" a few times. 
Deal with it, it's not like you won't get the joke."
,harblonia,2011-09-20T18:20Z,"Oh wait, you probably won't get the jokes... because you're 10 years old, lolol."
,severed1314,2011-09-20T19:41Z,"maybe you like to hear bleeps but I dont. It has nothing to do with getting or not getting the jokes, jackass."
,arturstalberg,2011-09-20T20:20Z,"Gotta love a country that feels that it has to protect its citizens from foul language on tv to prevent them from sliding down in to a amoral abyss of booze, drugs and sex. Oh, wait! To late ;)"
,martiniz,2011-09-20T22:16Z,No Lisa Lampanelli? It doesn't feel complete.
,FMyLife0,2011-09-20T23:14Z,"Great quality, censored. Im abit disappointed though, I expected much much more. No Lisa Lamponelli or Gilbert Gottfried...far from the best roast.

,demonocus,2011-09-21T16:07Z,i hate the bleeps too if i wanted to hear bleeps i would watch starwars but i want to hear the roast not R2D2
,Kole97,2011-09-21T16:56Z,@demonocus lol point there X
,reduxx,2011-09-21T20:33Z,Definitely not as funny as it could be. Charlie Sheen looked bored and unamused throughout. Great quality though. Thanks eztv!
,Mauler1,2011-09-22T00:52Z,"Great quality... the how is 1 hr long and it's just pure abuse 2 ppl, pretty lame! how ppl can find that funny, Charlie just sits there and takes it, he never talks!"
,ashen77,2011-09-22T01:32Z,"sheesh, what is it with you people and sheen? Moron leading the morons or what?"
,bettyswollocks,2011-09-22T07:11Z,"Thanks for the upload but this is not funny in any way, just embarrassing. Too much forced laughter, back slapping and over the top Americans whooping like chimpanzees. "
,ergjam,2011-09-22T10:24Z,"If you don't like it, then don't download it. I thought it was some of the funniest shit on TV. Better than that NEW 2 1/2 Men crap."
,daboyz1,2011-09-26T21:04Z,"A roast is not a roast without Lisa Lampanelli, Gilbert Gottfried, and Greg Giraldo (RIP.)  Also, why did they get a douchbag  to host this one?  Was a real roastmaster not available?"
,Kimmyme,2011-09-28T01:54Z,FU*KING AWESOME!!!!!! I FUC*ING LOVE CHARLIE!!!!!! ;)
,devilishswiss,2011-10-01T17:58Z,I always look for eztv before I hit the download button! always speed and quality!!!
