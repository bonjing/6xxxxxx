Pitura Freska was a reggae music group based in Venice, Italy, consisting of "Sir" Oliver Skardy (Gaetano Scardicchio, the group's leader), Francesco Duse, Cristiano Verardo, Marco Forieri, and Valerio Silvestri. The name is a slight corruption of the Italian phrase pittura fresca ("wet paint"). The band was formed in 1989 and was disbanded in 2002, after selling over half a million records. Their repertoire included many songs in Venetian language, as well as in Italian.
