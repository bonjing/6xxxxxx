Plot


After a surreal Godzilla-esque dream, Beavis and Butt-Head wake up to realize that someone has stolen their television. The pair then embark on a quest to replace it. After stealing and destroying a TV from school (resulting in their expulsion) and ruining the TV in Tom Anderson's camper, they visit a low-quality motel that advertises "TVs in every room." There they encounter a drunken Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis) who is waiting for two hired hit men, the same guys who stole Beavis and Butt-Head's television, to murder his wife, Dallas.

Muddy, thinking that Beavis and Butt-Head are the killers he has contacted, says that they must "do" (murder) his wife. Thinking that by "do", Muddy means "score with", Butt-Head convinces Beavis that both of them can "score". Muddy then hands them a photograph of Dallas with instructions on where to find her. Beavis asks if they can watch TV first, and Muddy subsequently shoots it. He drives them to the airport in his Lincoln Continental Mark V to catch the plane to her hotel room on the Las Vegas Strip. During the plane ride, both Beavis and Butt-Head manage to cause chaos and Beavis consumes massive quantities of caffeine pills given to him by an old woman (Cloris Leachman). He subsequently transforms into Cornholio, and almost causes the plane to crash when be barges into the cockpit and scares the pilots.

After causing a mild stir in a Las Vegas casino, the boys find themselves in their hotel room, which is adjacent to the room of the hunted woman, Dallas Grimes (voiced by Demi Moore). Dallas soon realizes they have no idea what they were actually hired for. While Beavis and Butt-Head begin fighting over who will "do" Dallas first, the police arrive to arrest her. Thinking quickly, she plants a stolen biological weapon known as the "X-5 Unit" in Beavis' pants in order to get rid of it as evidence. She then gets them tickets on a tour bus to Washington, D.C. instructing them that she will be waiting for them in the Capitol of the United States and will let them "do her" there.

The stolen biological weapon attracts the attention of the ATF, headed by Agent Flemming (Robert Stack) who orders a body cavity search on everyone he encounters and in spite of his tough talk, relies on fellow Agent Bork's (an uncredited Greg Kinnear) assistance, virtually all the time. Agent Flemming becomes convinced that the pair are criminal masterminds after they accidentally destroy the Hoover Dam, by effectively cutting the power to Las Vegas. On the tour bus, they visit landmarks including the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park. After becoming stranded in Petrified Forest National Park, they wander through the desert and meet two drifters (Earl Hofert and Tony Darling) who strongly resemble them. The men, former Motley Crue roadies, tell them that they once hooked up with two "sluts" from the boys' hometown of Highland, Texas, 15 years earlier. They also share similar personalities, as evidenced by Beavis' father's fascination with fire, and Butt-head's father's pulling down his pants and farting in the fire, creating a large fireball. Neither the men nor the boys make the obvious connection of their parentage, and the drifters abandon Beavis and Butt-head before they wake up the next morning. The boys then continue to trek through the desert, and, after munching on a peyote cactus, Beavis goes into a mescaline induced hallucination, featuring music by White Zombie with animation inspired by Rob Zombie.
