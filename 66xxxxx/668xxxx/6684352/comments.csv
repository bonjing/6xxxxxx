,manowar1952,2011-09-23T23:02Z,"Works fine. Loaded it with DaemonTools Lite without a hitch....and it's in pseudo-3D to boot.
Thanks.

Could do without Adobe though."
,geek4real,2012-01-28T11:11Z,"Works great and the download was EXTREMELY fast -- less than 1 minute!  Thank you.

However, the exact same version is available here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6565227/SereneScreen.Marine.Aquarium.v3.2.5991 and is only a 3.4MB download.  Installed they both take about 7.3MB.  In addition the other one is not an .iso file so no need to extract it or make a cd.

Not a criticism!  The upload is much appreciated."
,geek4real,2012-01-28T11:14Z,FYI: the 3.4MB file I mentioned above is the downloaded version.  There is a lot of unnecessary stuff on the CD version so that accounts for the difference.
