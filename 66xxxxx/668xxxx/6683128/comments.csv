,sephalon,2011-09-17T22:18Z,"I can't view it with Media Player Classid (CCCP). VLC will show the video, but not the audio. WMP won't even try to open it. 

How are you folks watching it?"
,Tenkikun,2011-09-18T03:11Z,"A bit derpy quality, but what do you expect from a first release, and is this really all of it?"
,CaptainSwag19,2011-09-18T04:45Z,@sephalon DivX. Plays high quality mkv files.
,temlin,2011-09-18T09:21Z,"awful quality, waiting for better
but seeding for those who want it now"
,TorrentGuy96,2011-09-18T10:49Z,"@sephalon It plays fine in VLC for me :S

@Tenkikun It is all of it, the first episode is in two parts like season 1 and the second part airs next saterday

,twizted_rozes,2011-09-20T19:36Z,"you guys might want to check your computers. I downloaded this the day that he released it and I just now got my computer working. The file put a wretched virus on my laptop :(

And sephalon, you can watch .mkv files using Media Player Classic - Home Cinema. Safe download and plays virtually all video files."
,RedMaple,2011-09-21T07:29Z,low quality.
,TorrentGuy96,2011-09-22T21:24Z,"@twizted_rozes I dont know were you got that virus from but it wasnt this torrent mate, If it did have a virus it would kick in right away, not just kick in a while later"
,millerlite2006,2011-09-23T07:18Z,"QUALITY SUCKS.

And no I don't give two fucks about not contributing."
