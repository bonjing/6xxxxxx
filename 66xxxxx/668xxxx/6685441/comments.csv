She isn't really an indie artist but has been labeled one because of the backlash against her by some really ugly female ""indie"" musicians because she became so popular so quickly. They are jealous of her because she is so beautiful, hot and popular after she released Video Games on youtube! This was my first torrent.Peace, Phantazm79"
,Phntzm79,2012-02-09T20:03Z,"When someone hates you, what they are really feeling is that they want to be you or are jealous of what you have in most cases!These feelings are of weakness, hate is an emotion of weakness and a feeling of lack of control! The line between love and hate is thin! A persons true identity is revealed in times of stress! Weak people hate, Strong people support others! Phantazm "
