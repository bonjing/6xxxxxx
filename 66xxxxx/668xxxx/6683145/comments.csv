I could totally get past the fact that I've seen better quality cam's recorded by amateurs using a Goddamn VHS camera to film it if some son of a bitch hadn't dropped out the audio on every curse word in this movie!! That's right, some dumb asshole poorly cut out every ""shit, fuck, damn, bitch, ass"", etc...........  Censorship plain and simple, it's like this was uploaded by a bunch of lunatic religious fanatics!!! As it is now the MPAA would rate it G instead of R. To top it all off this looks to be seriously cropped and has typing (not typical dvd-screener watermarks) in the middle of the right side of the screen.(no mention of those either) I am NOT one to complain about things I download for free, even if they are mislabeled (as long as it's not intentional) and disappointing and I'm willing to assume that the uploader .Dude. either did not know about the shit that is this torrent or forgot to mention that some kindergartner edited what could have been an awesome movie. As it is, this torrent takes TPB's worst torrent of the year award and was actually uploaded by a ""trusted"" member!! Fucking ridiculous and I hope this was a one time fuck up. This torrent should be removed or TPB is seriously doomed. I would rather download a malicious virus than get a shit torrent like this again!!!! Fuck!! Sincerely, DrScott   "
