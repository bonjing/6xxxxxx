All Songs from the Movie "Brother Sun Sister Moon" ripped from DVD.

This is the Story, why you cant buy this:
In the early 1970s, Donovan agreed to write and record songs for the English version of Franco Zeffirelli's Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972). While the film included Donovan's recordings of the songs, the accompanying soundtrack included none of Donovan's original recordings. The absence of these recordings prompted many of Donovan's fans to request an official release of the songs.

In order to satisfy demand, Donovan embarked on acquiring the rights to the original recordings. Due to the nature of the original contract and complex publishing rights issues, it became evident to Donovan that releasing the original Brother Sun Sister Moon recordings would be extremely difficult. In the absence of this release, Donovan decided to record new versions of the original songs and release it exclusively through the iTunes Music Store.

For the new recordings, Donovan opted not to recreate the lush orchestration and choir vocals of the original recordings. Instead, he plays guitar and sings solo, in a style reminiscent of his Sutras album.

I did some work in ripping and editing the songs from the DVD: Fade in and out and normalizing. The sound is now much better than what you got with the mp3 collection. CouldnÂ´t delete noisy wind and rain sounds, some voiceovers still in. 

At least weÂ´ve got 21 songs, 192kbps mp3, tagged as good as my research was succesfull. If somebody knows the names of the gregorian chants or the female singer of lullaby (i tagged actress Valentina Cortese) please tell us.
