Decent quality (x264) and much lower file size (108mb)

Only if you don't want 700MB per episode, but some people prefer the 1080p"

,the00negative,2012-01-21T21:30Z,"I have a question, why is the torrent size so large, despite only carrying one file, namely one episode? could someone perhaps enlighten me on this?"
