,Zev747,2011-10-06T08:21Z,"this works great, but there doesn't seem to be an ""instruments"" folder upon install.  My old version came with these, and I have no idea how to play anything without instruments."
,MacMan26,2011-10-18T15:38Z,"Thanks for all the great uploads, we need more people like you."
,clammy123,2011-10-21T12:42Z,Is this torrent clean? 
,h2sk8ter,2011-11-22T07:02Z,"Great Program..LOL FAIL VIRUS AV Protection 2011 pops up.. you fucking fail bro i went in task manager fuckd ur shit up and boom removed ur shitty piece of virus but hey, feel amazed u made me take 5 minutes of my life to take down a virus i feel accomplished."
,Gunvald89,2011-11-24T15:16Z,Does this have virus?
,aniluke,2011-11-26T09:07Z,the torrent is clean. but you can maybe get a socalled false positive. that is because of the codes used in the crack free anti virus programs wil see that coding as a virus. my tip: just ignore the uploader is trusted (look at the skull after his name) that means no problems
,[f41l]ACE,2011-12-10T08:39Z,is this a demo? anyways thx for the upload very fast
,Petertjuh360,2011-12-11T12:09Z,"What's the song in the crack? :)

Torrent works here.
Good crack and install."
,pippi123,2011-12-13T08:45Z,"Virus software doesn't mean anything - be it ""virus"" positive or negative. 
I would say it is very naive to think this or any other release would be free of malicious code. 
Haha, groups doing hacking'n'cracking just for showing off.. MUAHAHAAA! in my and more so IN YOUR ass.
""trusted"" skull means nothing!
I don't say every crack and illegally obtained software deserves evil inside stamp. And I bet very a few of downloaders have the skillz to examine these things... But, well using these releases you knowingly give your hardware, information etc. to 3rd party who does whatever they wish - instead of paying for that software (which of course, doesn't awlays garantee any better safety). 
Of course you could try to audit thsese things with clean install of VM and see what happens... 
Or examine what that crack, does or dll is modified comapred to original...
yep."
,Dyl0n,2011-12-16T11:20Z,@pippi123 is it a fucking virus or not? still no straight answer? shut the fuck up then.
,v1510nm45t3r,2011-12-17T00:17Z,Scanned with both AVG and Malwarebytes...its clean. Work great too!! Thanks Anacondaz!!!!
[V],bigbluesea,2011-12-24T00:25Z,"@h2sk8ter and @pippi123

The both of you try and sound like you know what your talking about,fact is the both of you are feeble minded retards

App is clean and works as it should

Thanks Anacondaz!"
,JSprrw205,2011-12-27T16:08Z,"For all the newbies... If u get a warning about a virus or anything else, 9 times out of 10 it's a false positive... I have downloaded many torrents like that over the years and my computer is fine... Still running like its brand new out of the box and nothing has been high jacked... Come on man... And another thing, when u have detailed instructions on how to install and run the program included with the torrent, that's all mofo's need... All these questions are an attempt for developers to get insider info as to how to stop their shit from being hacked... Long live TPB biches!!"
,kenasona,2012-01-11T09:24Z,I have to side with some of the comments above. There IS a virus/worm. I isolated stdrt.exe right after installation. Good thing I had Regrun-warrior to get rid of it..
,LordofReapers1,2012-02-07T02:23Z,Nice Torrent!!! and nice crack thank you very much!!! thanx for seeding
[T],dramacore,2012-02-22T05:05Z,"the closest thing to a virus my computer has gotten in the past years, was from installing anti virus software. "
,RemainToInspire,2012-02-23T04:13Z,"@ dramacore
Lmao!

I dislike when people come and troll on these things...
I mean, 90% of them come on here, and download a shit ton of stuff for free... and never once support the creators; Pitiful.

But hey! Who am I to judge?
Thanks alot Anacondaz... Don't listen to the ""virus"" talk. "
,AnonymousxVa2,2012-02-23T07:50Z,"It's a false positive, Shut the fuck up.
My antivirus detected it as well, after running thorough tests on the code, there is nothing suspicious about the ""trojan"" itself.
fuck sake

Great job Anacondaz, keep up the good work."
,thorntor,2012-03-30T12:43Z,"Downloaded at 1Mb/s :)
