,gustavodz,2011-11-22T16:24Z,"has anyone solved this? 
I've tried enabling all emulation options and still says original disc not found"
,diegoACDC777,2011-11-24T03:08Z,"@gustavodz, you must have alcohol 120% (download the demo version here:http://trial.alcohol-soft.com/) Install this software. You need it to mount the image. Ok, the reason why it says ""original disk not found"" is because you have to select ALL the options the emulation section. After that you can install the plane. Let me know if it works. One last thing, I have windows 7 64 bit but it doesn't work for me because my PC crashes everytime I start up FSX. This happens after I select the plane, I don't know why, if it works for you please let me know!!!! thx in advance."
,diegoACDC777,2011-11-24T03:09Z,PLEASE ANYONE HELP ME!!!!! Everytime I select this plane in FSX my PC crashes. I don't know how to fix this. Please I need help!!!! THANK YOU!!
,diegoACDC777,2011-11-24T03:23Z,"Please guys I really need your help. Everytime I select this plane in FSX, my PC crashes. I followed all the instructions but I don't know why this happens. Is anybody experiencing the same thing? Is there a solution?? Please I need asistance ASAP!!!! I have windows 7 64 bit.
Thanks guys."

Now to the downloaders, this works 100% iv checked it all out. The reson why im telling you's this is bcoz iv read few comments saying it crashes etc etc. Well i only installed once first time and everything worked as it sapose to. 
Im running FSX SP2 on a Vista 64bit os. If anyone needs help to install this mail me at macky.flyboy@yahoo.com. 

I hope you wont have to, Plus pls seed this file as a file as good quaility as this one it deserves to be kept alive.

Again i want to thank Alef for this, Its a plane i wanted for some time and didn find it till yours. 

If you need any help mail me. All the best - Macky."
,winkerbie1234,2012-04-08T13:33Z,"@diegoACDC777

This works 100% on windows 7 x64bit, with liveries and all.

Make sure you use Alcohol 120 (NOT Daemon Tools) and turn on all emulation options. :)"
,Superman90,2012-04-17T00:52Z,"Thanks a billion for this!! 
But I do not really understand this installation. Anyone wants to help me with this?

Regards!"
,9bytes,2012-04-30T20:41Z,"To everybody that's having trouble getting this installed, or having the computer crash when you try to install it:

Yes, you've got to have all that stuff done with Alcohol 120%, BUT for Windows 7 users, you've got to DISABLE User Account Controls! That's it. Disable UAC, restart your computer. Install the MD-11 just like the rest of it all said. Restart if necessary. Go back to UAC and put it on what it was on before the install, and restart your computer.

Worked for me after like 3 hours of trying. lol Don't know why I didn't think of it before hand :P

Enjoy, everybody!"
