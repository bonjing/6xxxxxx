San Francisco duo Girls make druggy, ethereal pop in the spirit of Spiritualized and Ariel Pink. With a common love of drugs and music, Christopher Owens and JR White started making music together and eventually earned a deal with Matadors label True Panther Sounds. Their first album, simply titled Album, received rave reviews, and was named one of the ten best albums of 2009 by Spin, Rolling Stone, and Pitchfork. Following the unexpected success of Album and arena-sized international tours with the likes of Smashing Pumpkins and Julian Casablancas, Girls invested their finances into music equipment. Inspired, Owens and White recorded over 70 new songs, and picked their favorite six to make a 30-minute EP, titled Broken Dreams Club. True Panther released it in autumn of 2010, and quickly returned the boys to the studio for their second full-length, Father, Son, Holy Ghost, which followed in September of 2011.
