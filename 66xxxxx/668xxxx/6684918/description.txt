I first learned of John McDermott's music decades ago when I found a CD
at the local library. I hadn't finished listening to it and had to pay
fully thirty five dollars to have a courier bring me a copy from a local
retail store to the hospital I was laid up at for a while.

He has some curious appeal as he is clearly from Scotland in his voice
equally, however he dos sing a lot of Irish tunes of interest.

This album is somewhat better than his others in that the voice is
less mechanical seeming less perfunctory at the task.

There is even a duet version of Fields of Athenry and this serves
the listening audience much better by far!

He has many fans and now lives in Canada a hundred miles
away from where I am posting this here for you today!


cheers!
