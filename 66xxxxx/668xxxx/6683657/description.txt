Handbook of Toxicology of Chemical Warfare Agents...is a comprehensive and up-to-date monograph covering in nine sections virtually everything related to the topic, from "anthrax" to "VX." The editor did an excellent job of giving a homogenous "feel" to the contributions of more than 160 authors with varying backgrounds and points of view. The list of contributors reads like the "Who's Who" in the field. This handbook is a most welcome addition to any library, institutional or private, and a must for anybody interested in the field." - Dr. Georg Petroianu, Florida International University, Miami, USA
