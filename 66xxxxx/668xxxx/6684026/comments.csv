Please test it before you download the movie, in case your pc & graphic card are not very powerful.

But better keep them as they are because this duology has wonderful engine etc-sound effects.
Watch them loud in an afternoon if you got neighbours, then you'll see the point I mean.
Of course you can convert a track then switch between the 1500 & 768 KB/s during an action then hear the difference.
I do them 768 KB/s in movies (drama for instance) with ""nothing special""-sounds.
Cheers."

[T],FatFreddy69,2011-09-21T09:06Z,"You may want to skip the second movie, it was truly a pain to watch it.
Here are some honest reviews, listen to them, you won't regret:

Don't read the positive reviews because they are full of shit lairs."
