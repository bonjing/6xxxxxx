Let me stop you right there. You don't KNOW if this will work and you are uploading it when there is already a plethora of confirmed scene cracks that work for every release on this very website?

Balls to the metal fail right there sir."

Thanks for uploading."

,ZtorkX86,2011-09-19T17:56Z,"Illanair@ I did it because Dude asked if someone could. Besides, there's no other scene release crack. They may work but they are not scene release. Also, this seem to update the game to 1.2. The otheres are either 1.0 or 1.1."
