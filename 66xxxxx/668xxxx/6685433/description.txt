08 "Koh" September 16, 2011 
"KÅ" (é»„ï½žKOH)  February 25, 2011

As a broadcast of Yukio's location is sent to Koh's base, Logan says he will go 
save her first rather than let her die to get his revenge, with Koh believing 
the opposite. Making a deal that Logan will distract Kurohagi when he arrives at Dragon Palace so that he and his men can attack, Koh gives Logan a map with a direct route to Dragon Palace named "Hell Road" due to its history of people going in but dying when they are caught. As the grunts watch Yukio play with her weapon, they reveal that they have automated-military grade weaponry guarding the bunker. When the men go to sleep, Yukio frees herself with her weapon being on the wall, but is tranquilized when Kurohagi checks on the men. The one in charge of guarding Yukio is killed by a dart of a more potent and lethal version of the one used on Logan at the Yashida home. Logan easily 
disables this system and uses the ammo to break through the door of the bunker and unties Yukio. Logan picks up a tranq-dart, and takes it with him as the duo head for Hell Road.
