,jjsjeff,2011-09-19T06:40Z,"Was downloading this one, but cancelled since TvTeam released.  I don't want to download a bunch of RARs and then find out I don't even get a show at the end."

,stlctan,2011-09-19T06:41Z,1gb?? this is no good
,tephea,2011-09-19T07:04Z,"This one is mildly fake. They added something to the first and last piece of the sample, which is why I am seeding with only 99.9%. It is the full show, though."
,LBDude99,2011-09-19T07:47Z,This torrent is only 99.9% complete.  Will someone please completely seed the torrent?

,Pirate_P,2011-09-19T10:34Z,"Sceneballance what is going on? I am stuck at 99.9% :-(
Torrents that give no seeds and get stuck are very disappointing. Hope you get things sorted out. 

Until then I'll be grabbing my torrents from other trusted uploaders. Will be watching the scenebalance comments to see if things get better or worse before I download from you again. Sorry but its just the way it is."
,chuck90025,2011-09-19T10:42Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

It's in RAR format and not complete.  Mine was sitting at 99.9% for 2 hours.  I finally removed and deleted torrent and data.  I only have one thing to say:  Asshole."
,mcstat,2011-09-19T11:03Z,Broken seeds in this torrent.
,dlxmax,2011-09-19T11:06Z,"This torrent is worthless. Hangs forever at 99.9%, and that 0.1% also includes part of the first RAR file, so you can't open this.

LAME! "
,otnemem,2011-09-19T11:16Z,"This has been happening a lot with scenebalance. Maybe now people will get smart and shy away from rar releases that have exactly zero advantages.
Download the other torrent."

Fucking waste of time and bandwidth."
,Kake56693,2011-09-19T13:09Z,Someone needs to take over the 720p supplying. This is garbage that the only release is RAR-bullshit and not even properly seeded.
,Itsumishi,2011-09-19T13:16Z,"Screw this torrent, it's as broke as everyone else is claiming.  Guess that Green Skull ain't worth the pixels its projected on.

Can anyone point to a working 720p version of this episode?"
,twopoint,2011-09-19T13:26Z,What a load of crap
,lailabagge,2011-09-19T13:29Z,"Let's be reasonable and just agree to HATE ALL THE F*CKERS WHO INSIST ON SHARING RAR ARCHIVES! THEY SHALL ALL DIE AT THE HANDS OF, er, UNRAR?

Seriously though, stop with this rar bullshit. It's just lame and this dead torrent is one of the reasons for it."
,ravogd,2011-09-19T13:50Z,"THIS TORRENT IS FINE!!! YES IT STAYS AT 99.9% BUT IF YOU EXTRACT USING WINRAR AND CHECK THE ""KEEP BROKEN FILES"" BOX THEN THE FILE EXTRACTS FINE. IT IS THE COMPLETE EPISODE. IGNORANT PEOPLE QUICK TO CONDEMN AND DELETE SOMETHING THAT IS PERFECTLY GOOD!!!"
,balanced,2011-09-19T14:04Z,"Always wait for the WEBDL version of BrBa; always good quality and posted without being RAR'd.

The IMMERSE versions always have people complaining about the quality and RARhead scenebalance thinks it is posting to newsgroups and can't take a second to unRAR the stuff before posting it and we'd like to discourage that so try to always get the UNRAR version even if it means you have to wait a bit for it.

I dl 8+GB unRAR'd torrents all the time and there's no problem with them.  People who insist on RAR's are confusing NNTP with torrents - just because it was an appropriate packaging method for one DOES NOT make it useful for the other so get with it folks!"
,jordansky,2011-09-19T15:34Z,Works fine. Unrar's fine. 
,lynzay_,2011-09-19T16:01Z,"@lailabagge 
the reason RARs are posted is because they come straight off USENET as binary files, which have to be broken into smaller files. 


so its a choice between waiting longer for it to be posted online, or the inconvenience of you having to press unzip. 

if you have no idea why people do things in a certain way, abusing people is no answer, as its usually YOU who doesnt understand............. "
,leogyn,2011-09-19T16:15Z,"there are lots of users seeding 100% of the files now, the ""stuck on 99,9%"" problem is GONE now, this torrent is OK on this point."

,.BlackIce,2011-09-22T23:35Z,"My god all you douchebags need to shut the fuck up and learn to thank people for uploads.  A .rar torrent?  Jesus christ, all you do is open the first file and extract.  WOW, THAT WAS TRULY HARD, LETS ALL COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW BAD THE TORRENT IS BECAUSE IT ONLY TAKES 5 SECONDS TO UNRAR.  

A: 8
V: 8

It's not the greatest 720p release, but it's definitely watchable.  Thank you scenebalance for the upload."
