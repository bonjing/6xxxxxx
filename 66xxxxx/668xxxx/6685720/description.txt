Candye Kane
Sister Vagabond (2011)





Los Angeles native Candye Kane sings a sassy and showbiz-savvy blend of blues and soul that takes no prisoners of any persuasion. Kane has been a lot of things in her life, from a mother and serious student to a pinup girl and actress (both on-stage and in risquÃ© movies), and she even did a stint as a serious, full-tilt punk rocker. Sheâ€™d be just another fringe player in L.A. except for two things -- she can sing like nobodyâ€™s business and she has a sexy, intelligent, and passionate musical vision to match her voice.
