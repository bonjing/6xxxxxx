,riox1,2011-10-31T18:40Z,"I have extracted the steam file contents and was able to run the game. However, I am now suddenly unable to log into steam via the provided username (TsunamiNori) because I do not have the password to the account to this account I logged into before..

I tried deleting and extracting the steam contents again, but I am still prompted for the password to the account TsunamiNori.

tl;dr.. does anyone know the password to the account? thx."
,riox1,2011-10-31T18:45Z,"Also, someone posted about not being able to actually play the game, but they were able to watch replays. Can anyone validate this? 

I am definitely going to buy this game (been playing dota for 8 years:o) and i am anxious to see how it will run on my computer."

,tinapay01,2011-12-19T02:51Z,"Everything runs fine, but creating lobby doesn't work. No gameplay could be done so far, sadly. Help, anybody? But for now, I'll stick with my Warcraft 3 and DotA. Game never gets old on me IMHO.

@riox1- I'm automatically logged in into steam as TsunamiNori all right, but only in offline mode. Connection always fails. I haven't updated steam yet though, so I guess I'll have to do that first. Unless anybody here advises me otherwise."
