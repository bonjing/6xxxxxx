,Sailor420,2012-03-20T12:00Z,"can't figure out how to use the keymaker on this one.  asking for ""Please enter your user code !"".

App does not seem to display a user code during activation?

FYI: Not a NOOB, done many sucessfull installs"
,Sailor420,2012-03-20T12:15Z,"Well I finally figured it out:

- Select ""Offline button""
- Must select the U3 version on the pulldown for portable
- Then fillin the fields on the keygen
- Needs a ID + password on the UE activation dialog.

This was a tough one, but I got it !!"
