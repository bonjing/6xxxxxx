This has to be one of the best reggae compilations ever. Steely and Clevie updated these classics with samples and new vocal tracks. It was this album that gave you - You Don\\\'t Love Me - by Dawn Penn. 

Easy Snappin by T.Beckford is considered by many to be one of the first reggae song. Reggae developed out of the 1950s Jamaican Rhythm and Blues scene and Easy Snappin was a huge Jamaican Rhythm and Blues hit in the 1950s. In this song you can hear the seeds being sown for the music that the world would eventually know as reggae.
