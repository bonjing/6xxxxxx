In this book, the four authors show us the condensed experience how to design ship hull structures from a practical viewpoint. In three parts, the book presents the fundamentals, the theory and the application of structural design of hulls. The topics are treated comprehensively with an emphasis on how to achieve reliable and efficient ship structures. The authors have in particular introduced their experiences with the rapid increase of ship sizes as well as the introduction of ship types with a high degree of specialization. The associated early failures of these "new" structures have been analyzed to provide the readers with illustrations why structural design needs to be carried out on several levels in order to ensure that correct loading is applied and that local structural behaviour in properly understood.
