Another Time, Another Place

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Jessie Kesson; Full-cast dramatisation.

1944. To a tiny faming community in the far north-east of Scotland come three Italian POWs. Until now, the war has scarcely touched this isolated world and the Italians are regarded by the locals as dangerous. However, to Janie, the young wife of the cattleman, the Italians are thrilling and exotic. Their experience of imprisonment and yearning mirror her own feelings and she is gradually drawn to the vibrant Neapolitan, Luigi.
