,liverpool1215,2011-10-15T14:46Z,"@danzing

you downloaded custom flashbang .vmt from some server. That's why you can only play that server. Try re-downloading the game and disable download custom files in the game."
,bruss.aka.durka9,2011-10-15T18:08Z,"to all
I wait new version of emulator. Then i'm update this game.

to lanjimsdk
In console type: setname ""your name""
Clan-name change in rev.ini or with UltimateNameChanger.exe in installation dir."
