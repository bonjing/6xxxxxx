Video bitrate about 580 kbps only !!! It has to be over 700 kbps ... in my opinion!!! 

It's true there is something over 700 kbps: the overall bitrate about 712 kbps !!!

Cheers !!

If you are enough experienced, it's OK at this length 2h:18min with 800Mb or better 900Mb filesize rip

Nevertheless, the  bigger video bitrate the better quality you have. Though...filesize is growing !

Cheers!"
,Browse.Torrents,2011-09-19T16:57Z,Thanks...
,Haliolo,2011-09-19T23:21Z,Works great on Android. Files below 800mb doesnt smack back. Cheers with seeding
,ramikaz,2011-09-21T09:57Z,Did this ever make it to the theaters?
,Ratman_84,2011-09-24T00:40Z,"I don't think it ever made it to theaters. Malick's movies aren't really mainstream. To be honest, going to the theaters is too expensive for my taste these days. I'd also recommend the larger file size for this. His movies are always visually stunning and higher quality makes a big difference."

You are right on both counts, and I can't thank you enough for the tip regarding the higher quality print. I've barely scanned through a third of the movie to see how the audio-visuals are in the 6.55GB copy out there, and I'm already blown away by the stunning visuals. Thanks a bunch!!:D:D:D"
,ChuchuPirata,2012-03-06T20:26Z,"I used to download 700/800/900MB movies... But some movies that I like most, I prefer to download in a better quality. I have not seen this movie yet. But I checked the images and audio:

A:10
V:10

I watch movies on a 40-inch TV and the resolution is very good. 

Thx for the torrent!"
,bwv812,2012-04-15T05:07Z,"What's the point of doing a Blu-Ray rip (and calling it one) if the resolution is only 624x336? It could just as well be a regular DVD rip.

This looks about as good as a good TS: despite the poor resolution, there is a lot of blocking and noise. Also, the audio is poorly mixed.
