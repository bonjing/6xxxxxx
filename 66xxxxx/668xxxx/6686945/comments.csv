,doofusmac,2012-01-07T02:08Z,"INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download Daemon Tools Lite to mount the .mdx image of the game (free download from Daemon Tools website).
2. Launch the Installer (the ""autorun"" should prompt you; if not just open ""My Computer"" and the Installer will show up in your cd/dvd drive).
3. Install game. (Just click the ""next>"" buttons when prompted even though it is in another langauge.)
4. Copy the ""src"" folder located in the torrent's crack folder to the game's directory. Mine was - C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction. Overwrite the existing files when prompted to do so.
4. Change the language from Russian to English by:
a) google ""Patch102 [Trad - Rus to Eng]"" and download
b) extract and then copy the contents of the patch folder to the game directory (exactly the same as above)
c) overwite files when prompted

NOTE: Some Anitvirus software will detect viruses. Ignore these detections.
Enjoy"
