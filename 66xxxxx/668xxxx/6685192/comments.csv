,mdwalkman,2011-09-27T13:08Z,"Thanks to extremezone for always being awesome.

The movie itself? Horrible. The cast and crew seemed to have had their hearts into it, but the film is really just a good example of how too little money and too little talent just can't serve a concept like this with any competence. They did what they could as well as they could. An A for effort for an F for the final result. "
