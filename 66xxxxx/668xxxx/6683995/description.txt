Here it is Version 5.0! I did decide at least one more time to redesign this skin.
I made a lot of changes mostly just visually.  I changed most the fonts that where plain white to a green white fade, with a yellow white fade as the highlight .  Also i touched up some images and made a few minor improvements.  As always let me know if there is anything that you don't like or if you find any bugs/glitches and i will try to put out a fix.
