Excellent album of Wet Wet Wet with most of their greatest hits with much
of very very nice tracks as well.
Great Music and still nice to listening and to rediscovering for a moment.
A must have anyway for any fan of them. 
as usual,converted to mp3 cbr stereo-192 kbps-44 khz without error

For security reason,i won't seed more than 10 hours but will come back from time to time,sometimes so to seed again if necessary.
But please,give a suffisant up speed if you really want to get something.
BTW : MediaGet,FDM and FlashGet are disallowed and forbidden now.
Making too much traffic congestion and still very or quite slow anyway.
Try utorrent 1.8.5 trust me ! believe me !
The best version i ever seen for my personal experience...
light,simple,fast,nice and easy to set.
few peers still use this one and get very nice results again.
don't forget that i often seed and therefore i know what i say...
BitTornado still works also but unfortunately seems still quite slow :(
and remember slow upload may get slow download.
I repeat right now we are no more on emule here,then be suffisantly generous !
You won't die for that anyway.
keep an eye on your tracker list and check it regulary as well.

Enjoy and seed a bit please to share with the other peers,thx !
kind regards
