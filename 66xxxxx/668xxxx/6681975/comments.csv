,starvg95,2011-09-17T10:10Z,"The sample pics are carefully chosen to portray good quality, but the movie is of average quality."
,ghandi253,2011-09-17T10:34Z,Fuck that weak ass R6 shit. I am never checking the comments on an R6 again. Every time I do I see nothing but negative comments. Complete waste of time.

Really bad"
,roninrjbr,2011-09-17T22:16Z,"V- 7: on a screener quality scale, sometimes the image fades however.
A- 6: lose sync very few times, other times the language changes to chinese (very briefly though)

Overall, is quite a watchable movie"

A:9
V:9
