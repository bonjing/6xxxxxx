,WolfgangR5150,2011-09-18T06:42Z,WTF... Keeps saying it is inactive. All the setting are right. If you can't download do you have any suggestions?
,erbswurst,2011-09-18T07:06Z,It works!
,WolfgangR5150,2011-09-18T14:49Z,Thanks for letting me know erbswurst
,WolfgangR5150,2011-09-18T22:30Z,I am surprised how many people are downloading this. The actual cd is to much on ebay. Guess that is why. The songs suck and are chessy. guess that is why we like them.
,patddfan,2011-10-15T12:28Z,no seeds?
,Chunky1982,2011-12-21T01:42Z,"Can someone with 100% seed this ? Been stuck at exactly 96.6% for almost a week. Since I started. The number of peers has jumped a bit. Currently looking at 4. All stuck at 96.6%. 

Thank you if you can. 

And yes, the CD is surprisingly way too much then it should be. Damn thing is going from $30 to $125 on Amazon. WTf! Lol. "
