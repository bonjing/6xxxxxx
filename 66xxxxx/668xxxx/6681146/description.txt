The third edition of Carpentry and Joinery 1 is the first in a series of three books which together provide an authoritative but thoroughly practical guide to carpentry and joinery for students following City & Guilds and CITB courses, NVQ candidates, and a wide range of amateurs and professionals.

Carpentry and Joinery 1 deals with the fundamentals of the subject from topics such as timber and wood preservation and protection, to a detailed outline of the tools available and information on the basic woodworking joints, adhesives and fixing devices. Books 2 and 3 show how to apply this fundamental knowledge. Details of craft theory, associated studies and practical procedures are integrated throughout each text.



In this new edition chapters have been reorganised to produce a more coherent, student-focused course. All references to the Building Regulations and current legislation have been updated, and developments in current best practice have been incorporated.
