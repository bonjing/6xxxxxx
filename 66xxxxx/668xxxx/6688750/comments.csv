,dragonbandit314,2011-10-08T10:42Z,"Where are the seeds? A whole load of us stuck at 99.8%, How rude to hit and run. 3 seeds who will not connect to allow the rest to complete. PLEASE set to forced seeding and allow the rest of us to share."
,boybanned,2011-10-15T08:28Z,I'm stuck downloading at 99.9% what the fuck!
,Oxenfree,2011-10-17T03:21Z,Stuck at 99.8% for the last three days.. What a shame. Very frustrating.
,Squiddy82,2011-10-19T22:03Z,"I'm seeding the whole thing, so you shouldn't be stuck at 99.8 for any reason I know of.  Is there one particular file that will not complete?"

,Oxenfree,2011-10-21T04:39Z,Garbage - Only hapy when it rains and Garbage #1 crush
,Oxenfree,2011-10-21T05:35Z,I canned those 2 songs and now I'm complete. Thank you for sharing! Great collection. I'll try to log on everyday from 6-10pm Eastern time.
,Squiddy82,2011-10-21T16:47Z,"I was trying to upload a zipped version so people who wanted the entire collection would have a higher rate or success completing the download.  I believe piratebay is blocking me, though.  It keeps saying filename error.  It's probably just a safeguard to avoid double posts and spammers."
