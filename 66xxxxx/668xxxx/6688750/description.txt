Nostalgia!

When my favorite local radio station changed formats around 1999, I bought a PMP and made this playlist of all the songs I could remember them playing.

Sorry audiophiles -- This list was largely compiled during the dial-up/p2p days, so don't be surprised if some of these aren't the greatest copies ever heard.  All 128kbps.

Please feel free to point out embarrassing oversights in the comments.  I'm always looking to make additions.

These have been tagged for better sorting in my Zune HD.
