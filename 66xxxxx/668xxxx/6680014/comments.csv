,CallMeJHWH,2011-09-16T10:45Z,"The file entitled ""HP2Unknown"" Is ""Deathly Hollows 2."""
,CallMeJHWH,2011-09-16T11:02Z,"I hate to spam my own comments, but i'd like to add that these are .mkv files, with the exception of Deathly Hollows 1 & 2, which are .AVI"
,CallMeJHWH,2011-09-16T22:31Z,"I've noticed alot of people starting to download, and i'm glad. But please, be patient. I'm still the only seeder with the entire file, and im seeding from a laptop. The videos are great quality, and are worth the wait for the entire collection."
,AMoosvi,2011-09-17T02:31Z,How long will this take :/ 
,CallMeJHWH,2011-09-17T05:55Z,"Im still uploading, but im at 3 gigs. Soooo.....its hard to say. but there are alot of peers, so hopefully not too long. as soon as i get a full seed in there, it will go much faster."
,AMoosvi,2011-09-17T17:19Z,Why does it say that HP2 Prt2 is only 1hr 42mins? The movie is about 2 hours 10 minutes.. ?
,AMoosvi,2011-09-17T17:26Z,How come the duration of Harry Potter 2 Part2 is so short? 
,AMoosvi,2011-09-17T17:35Z,I mean deathly hollows 2 * 
,CallMeJHWH,2011-09-17T21:34Z,"Im not sure why its short, but i can tell you that my wife just watched this file and was pleased with it. no problems, except that the sound is off track. this is the only movie with that problem."
,AMoosvi,2011-09-17T21:52Z,Have you uploaded the whole file yet? 
,MultiKnull,2011-09-18T00:11Z,"Wtf.
I only wanted deathly hollows 2.
So I unhatched all the others, and it should be  1 something Gbit, but it still says 5.23? >:("
,CallMeJHWH,2011-09-18T06:23Z,"I have no idea why. if you un ticked the other files, it shouldnt do that. For what its worth, i downloaded that movie from this website. You'd still be able to find the same version, maybe a better one. Sorry for the waste of time."
,Shawk132132,2011-09-19T14:47Z,"@Multiknull If you use BitTorrent, the size of the file will be smaller. After each you untick you will see the filesize gets lower. It will say like 1gb out of 5gb or something like that. But when you hit ok the torrent will say 5.23 gb but it will only download 1gb or what the size of Deathly hallows 2 are."
,CallMeJHWH,2011-09-20T02:12Z,"@Shawk132132

,sime13,2011-10-08T15:29Z,hi...i am new here and i have a question.....when you say seed what do you mean???i don't know very goog english so answer me in plain language....
,CallMeJHWH,2011-10-15T13:35Z,"Thank you everyone for seeding this and making it one of the higher listed torrents. I would love to hear requests on other materials you would like me to upload. Might i add that i have a collection of over 20,000 mp3 songs, ranging from every genre?"
,CallMeJHWH,2011-10-15T13:41Z,"Seeding is when you let the file continue to download/upload after the file has already been completely download. Doing this is like planting a seed, with all the information of the file being put into that seed. this enables more people to download the file. Each torrent has a limited amount of health, and the health is determined by how many people seed the file. 

It is common courtesy to seed until you have hitten a ratio of 1.0, but its always nice to seed a 2.0 ratio, or even long if you feel the file is good, and want others to appreciate the hard work of the person who makes these torrents possible.

As you can see, i am passionate about torrenting."
