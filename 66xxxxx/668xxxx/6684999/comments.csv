I don't know what the difference is between the two installers.  Also, most of the screen savers work, but the settings are all ?????????, making it impossible to actually change the settings.  Did I do something wrong?"

thanks for your time !"
,CrazyDymond88,2011-09-27T15:37Z,I finally figured out that if you install one by one you get them all in perfect working order.  The only problem I see now is that for some reason msmpeng.exe (microsoft's anti malware service) goes nuts whenver working with these files.  Pretty sure I'll be uninstalling this and wiping my drive.
