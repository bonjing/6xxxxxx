The sound, for me, is no good, but I'm quite picky i suppose. Cant be doing with the clicking noise. It also seems to get worse further into the movie."
,weedfactory,2011-09-20T14:51Z,The static sound througout the movie is really annoying actually

I don't mean that in a bad way, but if you want to watch it with no sound distortion, its best to get this one^^^"
,.EzDL,2011-09-20T21:37Z,"I hate pussy's that whine about the quality. This is free and your paying nothing, plus your getting it before it's even legally released. So shut the fuck up."
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-09-20T22:46Z,"@EzDL dont talk about the quality wtf. that's what comments are for. To say what you think about the quality and thank the uploader. Quality is always important, why download a vid with crappy audio when theres a better copy out."
,trixsta101,2011-09-21T00:35Z,The kingdom release is far better.. audio and video fixed up.

,greylion,2011-09-21T22:10Z,"Sound is broken, lots of static. I got 4Â˝ minutes into it, then couldn't take it anymore. Deleted it.
