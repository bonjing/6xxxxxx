,AdolfbinStalin,2011-09-26T06:05Z,I am having problems with step 6. After I mount the PUK iso I get an error when trying to install it. Can someone help?
,Bail95,2011-09-26T11:22Z,are you still having trouble? Did you make sure to close the launcher from the first?  Also you may need to run with administrator privs let me know if this doesn't work
,AdolfbinStalin,2011-09-26T12:50Z,"I tried to do as you you said (i.e. closed launcher from first and run as administrator), but no luck :(. 

What actually happens (after I mount and try to install the San11PK.iso), is that the launcher initially starts and gets to a black screen with the San11 logo (top left corner), and copyrights disclaimer in bottom right corner of screen (this takes about 5 seconds to reach), then I get a ""MSG_NO_MAIN_ERROR"" pop up menu that forced me to abort installation.

The no ""NoCD"" patch also doesn't seem to work as San11game (without PUK) stops working when the San11game.mds is ""un-mount'ed"". I figured maybe the ""MSG_NO_MAIN_ERROR"" means the San11PK.iso file can't find the San11game.mds. So I mounted two virtual drives one with San11.mds and the other to mount San11PK.iso but still no luck. Which brings me to another question? should the San11PK file be a .iso instead of a .mds? (like the San11game which is a .mds file)."
,Bail95,2011-09-26T14:40Z,"try deleting the PK iso and redownloading it.  I didn't install the no-cd patch for san11 myself, only the PK version"
,AdolfbinStalin,2011-09-26T15:32Z,"I can't seem to download it any more. When I click on ""download this torrent"" all I am getting is a file that is about 10mb and looks like a ""blank"" document icon."
,AdolfbinStalin,2011-09-26T16:24Z,"Never mind- didn't have utorrent open lol. Anyway, will download again and retry."
,AdolfbinStalin,2011-09-26T17:04Z,"Deleted PK and re-downloaded the whole thing (including San11). Still no luck with step 6. Anyway, thanks for replying/helping. "
,Bail95,2011-09-28T14:16Z,"give me a way to contact you and i'll give you a torrent of the installed dir on my hardrive that should solve your problem.  Btw loading screen is black for me too until you left/right click past 2 screens/movies you can't see, then it goes to 'loading'"
,AdolfbinStalin,2011-09-28T19:05Z,"you can contact me via email:

matemyday@hotmail.com

p.s. the game runs fine without the PUK. Just can't seem to get the PUK installed. "
,Bail95,2011-09-28T19:27Z,"are you doing this exactly?

> install sang11, cd 1 & 2 
> install update 1.0 and 1.2
> install PUK

don't mess with the no cd patches if you want PUK until all steps done"
,AdolfbinStalin,2011-09-29T08:03Z,"Yes exactly that and without ""no cd"" patches. I even tried copying and pasting the contents of the PK.iso to install dir and then using the setup.exe within the .iso to install the PUK from within San11 game dir, but still no luck. "
,Bail95,2011-10-04T21:22Z,"I'm not sure what the problem is, I'm using win 7 and reinstalled it twice without any issues.  Maybe you need to download JP language packs for your windows"
,radiantmadness,2011-11-10T13:46Z,"just wanted to say that everything works fine:) I own the 'normal' english version, but this is even more fun! It could be even better if this just would get 100% translated..."
,Four1Fool,2011-12-02T02:33Z,"You sir are a god. I've got the English version also, but without the PUK the AI isn't that great. I scoured the net numerous times for the PUK trying to get the most recent version of updates and the PUK all in one lang but without success. Thank you so much for this!"
