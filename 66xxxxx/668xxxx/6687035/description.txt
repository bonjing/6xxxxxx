Romance of Three Kingdoms XI by Koei with the power up kit (JP version), I looked forever and finally found this on a Brazil website so making it easier for everyone.  

This is not my work, I don't take credit. Please buy the english version from Keoi I have, but the game is MUCH better AI etc with the JP version + PUK.  Support the game so they translate it into more languages in the future!

Steps (might not be entirely accurate)

1. Unrar
2. a. open the folders, mount Sang11 iso and start the install from INSTALL dir
   b. Mid-install mount the file from the GAME dir and finish
3. Copy the 2 game patches 1.0 and 1.2 from the patch dir to the install dir where the game is at
4. Run Sang11 Patch 1.0
5. Run Sang11 patch 1.2
6. Mount the PUK iso and install
7. Open the translation patch .rar, and overwrite contents of the main install dir
8. Run the game from the translation patch .exe

There may be better translation patches out there, but this one works.

Have fun and buy the english version from Koei (with out the improved ai D:)
