,corxbeans,2011-09-19T02:55Z,Game works no problem so far :p dont worry bout the CD key just cancel it put the crack in and run it
,renaldodw,2011-09-26T18:52Z,can someone plz tell me how to crack this game!!
,john1912,2011-09-29T00:10Z,"After opening movie for new campaign it drops back to the main menu and says game could not start please try again, Any help?"
,huldu,2011-09-30T10:23Z,"You get that warning because the crack isn't working. Found that out today. Downloaded the demo, which worked perfectly fine. However i got the same error on the demo *when* the firewall blocked the game. Which in turns means that the crack is NOT working for the game."
,shorecogs,2011-10-05T20:39Z,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see a crack directory on my install... is there a separate crack for the game?"
,shorecogs,2011-10-05T20:42Z,Nevermind - I'm an idiot. I got it. :)
,SoFaKiNg42,2011-10-31T05:29Z,I put the crack in the right directory but it still wont work. When I start the game a window pops up asking for a Email and Password and when I click continue it asks for a CD key. Is this crack no longer good?
,Miscellania,2011-10-31T22:35Z,"I've downloaded it, mounted it and installed the game but when I start it up, it asks for a product key. I have no crack for this, can any1 help me get around this or find the crack if I've missed it?"
,pirateboob,2011-11-01T19:58Z,"same as previous two posts, adding rule to firewall to block the executable fixed the problem"
,fuzzyfurret,2011-11-02T17:15Z,"using firewall skips the product key check but then cannot start any game, says game could not be started try again later."
,grapefj,2011-11-13T18:14Z,Do you need the first Dungeons? I am having an issue where I place the crack in the directory and still getting asked for Register/Product key with no success on passing it.
,stubbieaussi,2011-11-26T07:19Z,"If like me you don't use a software firewall all you need to do is disconnect the internet when you want to play this game.
The game with the crack will play fine. "
,status00001,2012-03-13T14:07Z,"The Solution to """"the game could not be started"""" is that you need to allow the game to connect to yourself (localhost aka 127.0.0.1)

allow 127.0.0.1
block the rest, for example: 217.172.184.73 

So if you block all traffic with the firewall it will bring up your error

tada
ps. i just hope this expansion wont be as bugged as the previous game allthough it was a lot of fun for a short while ;)"
,fraddman,2012-03-25T12:45Z,"I get a very strange error. 

Everything works, but as soon as I get past all the cut scenes and cinematics to the very game, it just turns black. I can see the cursor but nothing happens.

Anyone know a solution?"
,d.kaliski,2012-04-07T18:15Z,"SOLUTION - yes i'm not joking. Solution to avoid this cd-key and even after cracking : Put crack in your folder with game, then normally run the game from your shortcurt or from game folder , BUT before you RUN the game, be sure to disconnect your internet connection. Then u won't be pleased for anything. 

Tryied few crack and other stuff, but at least this one option only helps me.

Sorry for my english."
,lazumm,2012-04-30T18:38Z,hmm i copied the crak on the right folder and it still ask for acc and if i press continue it asks for product key
