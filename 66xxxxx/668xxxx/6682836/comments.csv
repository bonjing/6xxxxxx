There is a english translation patch for the game to use on iso's of the actual game to put it in english, but you'll need more information in the little box above here with alot of details or no one will download it.

If it's in english, you should how and with what.

[Front Mission 5 was never localized for North America or Europe] basically there is not NTSC-U or PAL versions of the game.

....But I will give you the benefit of the doubt and check this out."
