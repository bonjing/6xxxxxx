Subtitles: Dutch
Date: 2011.09

Director: John Frankenheimer

Genre: Drama

Plot:
A portrayal of the Johnson presidency and its spiraling descent into the Vietnam War. Acting
on often conflicting advice from his Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara and other advisers,
President Johnson finds his domestic policy agenda for the Great Society overtaken by an ever
demanding commitment to ending the war. It also depicts his political skills as he crosses
swords with political foes such as Bobby Kennedy and Governor George Wallace. Despite support
and encouragement from stalwart friends such as Clark Clifford, Johnson realizes his
management of the war no longer has the confidence of the American people and announces
that he will not seek the nomination of the Democratic party for the the 1968 election.
