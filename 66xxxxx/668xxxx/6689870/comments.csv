,PPKLP,2011-09-28T17:02Z,"No disrespect bubanee, I download some of your stuff and I'm gratefull. The quality of these MP3's is excellent, not arguing that! But what a load of B#LLSH!T music is in this collection! Never heard this much crap one after the other that I can remember! There are a few desent songs in here like The Script and even a good one by Adele... Other than that it's all a waste of my eardrums! And there should be a law against ""Gang-raping Otis Redding"" That man did not deserve that! Jay-Z and Kanye West should go to jail for what they did to him. He must be rolling around in his grave!"

,ps3_in_az,2011-11-04T03:47Z,"@PPKLP Jeez, stop bitchin about the playlist! If you don't like the songs, then look elsewhere. I think you did a good job of compiling the most popular songs, thanx bubanee!"
,josechavarria2000,2011-12-24T22:15Z,"If you dont like the music, why did you download it to begin with? bubanee clearly posted the list of the songs that were included in torrent! quit your complaining and go look somewhere else for music that YOU will like."
