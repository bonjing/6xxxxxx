,.h10.,2011-09-16T11:56Z,"Worth mentioning. NTR 2012 is for NAV/NIS 19.1.0.28 only. You will get 90 days on NIS and 60 days on NAV.

Norton made it more difficult to hack their engine this time which is why there won't be any 120/180 or 365 days crack. 

You can get a 120 days subscription by installing norton 2011 on a virtual machine, then applying NTR 2011 3.3.1 to get a product key which can be used directly on norton 2012.

Enjoy!"
,.h10.,2011-09-16T12:21Z,"BOX! final version of NTR2012 will contain a 90 days fix for NAV which is now currently only 60 days. When it's out, i'll be posting links or upload a torrent and paste it here."
,ingo1711,2011-09-16T13:47Z,"Hej H 10 och tack för uppladningen uppskattas, men det finns faktisk 120 dagars trial reset ute har det själv instalerat."
,tannerman,2011-09-16T18:56Z,"thanks, h10. working great. 
remember to run the crack in windows safe mode first, very important."
,RebelRick,2011-09-17T05:27Z,Try this:Install NIS 2011.Install NTR BOX3.3.1 to get your 120 days.Uninstall the NTR BOX3.3.1 then under the SUPPORT tab click check for new version and update to 2012 version and you have Norton Internet Security 2012 for 120 days without any crack installed.I have done this on all 3 of my machines and it has been working fine for a week now.
,.h10.,2011-09-17T10:19Z,"that works aswell. as i metioned above, you can use ntr 3.3.1 on nis 2011 - then upgrade/ or use the key on differetn computer that has nis 2012.

As for trial side, box can't make any trial reset higher than 90 days. it's impossible. if you go over 90 days, symantec will notice and you're subscription is disabled. That's why the other torrent with a 180 days crack failed."
,sex1234,2011-09-17T16:46Z,"@.h10.
bro ur doing a great job man .......thnx a lot
and btw i dnt trust guyz uploadin without skull 
but your an exception!!!!!!"
,hieubg,2011-09-17T19:50Z,I only got 30days. how can you get 90 days?
,.h10.,2011-09-17T21:30Z,"@hieubg
it's all in the description. after installing nis 2012. reboot your computer into windows safe mode.
http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chsafe.htm

once you're in windows safe mode, disable norton product tamper protection as described in the instalation notes and run the trial reset to convert your norton from 15/30 days to 90 days.

the convertion only needs to be done once. once you've done this you can reset it in normal mode as many times you want."
,ingo1711,2011-09-18T02:21Z,"H10, tack för stort engagemang och alla upplysningar, fortfarande efter 10 dagar fungerar mina 120 dagar!!!!!!!"
,Tatletz,2011-09-18T04:16Z,Thanks for the torrent .h10.  : )
,Tatletz,2011-09-18T04:37Z,"Thanks for the torrent .h10., just curious if the final NTR 2012 by BOX! will have more than 90 days for NIS 2012?"
,.h10.,2011-09-18T10:06Z,"no. like i said, a lot of stuff changed with nis/nav 2012. product keys aren't the same for 90 days/120 days etc, and if he can't find a 120 days legitime OEM, he can't do a trial reset for 120 days.

He found a legitime 90 days NIS 2012 OEM, and a 60 days NAV 2012, hence why he was able to create a 90 days reset by finding out how norton and symantec handles the 90 day product keys (reversed enginering and so on probably)

90 days is perfectly fine anyway. that's 3 months without resetting. just look at kaspersky 2012 where you only have trial resetters for 30 days :/"
,.h10.,2011-09-18T10:16Z,"ingo1711@ there are no 120 days trial reset working on a NEW installed nis/nav 2012 that has 15/30 days.
NTR 3.3.1 is for norton 2011 and if you try running it on norton 2012 it won't reset your norton.

Why do you think BOX! is making a norton 2012 crack? He wouldn't make it if the 120 days norton trial reset 3.3.1 was working on a fresh installed norton 2012 product.

Thanks for your reply mate! Now this is clear, and of course 90 days is perfectly fine. BTW KIS 2012 trial resetter has long being blacklisted. So we should be happy to use Norton without this never ending search for keys like with KIS : ) "
,ingo1711,2011-09-21T02:29Z,"fortfarande efter 3 veckor funger 120 dagar för mig, otroligt men sant!!!!"
,.h10.,2011-09-21T13:25Z,"ingo, comments should be in english.
plus no one cares if you were able to upgrade from nis 2011 120 days to nis 2012 with your subscription kept. 

i've already told you that it is possible to get 120 days on nis 2012 but it requries you to have used norton ntr 2011 3.3.1 on nis 2011 and from there upgrade to nis 2012 (pretty much what you've done yourself but you wont admit it)

this 90 days trial reset by box is for the people that didn't have any norton product installed when they installed norton 2012.
it's for the people that installed norton and got a 15 days subscription.

,genio2k,2011-10-08T22:25Z,"h10 this is my first comment on TPB, specially to speak with you.
firts of all thanx for your work here about norton 2012.
Ok, i never installed an AV wioth trial reset before this so don't have experience. therefore i have a few question for you:

1- The Box! TR is said to work as many time as we want right ? so why is everyone afraid of the expiration date (after 90 days) ??
2- What will be the difference between the NTR v4 beta and the futur final version ????
3- In a worst case scenario...if 90 days trial reset does not work anymore, is it technically still pissible for Box! or you or anyone else to give us infinite trial resets of 15/30/45 days or so ? (hell i'll take that since it does not really bothet me to click on the program!!!!) 
4- Will you be kind and give me/us a detailed explanation ?"
,.h10.,2011-10-09T10:25Z,"1. When norton is expired the trial reset won't work and you will be forced to reinstall norton, clean you're registry etc, delete your old registry key. It is much more advisible to reset your 90 days before your current 90 days ends - just makes everything easier.

2. Box is trying to find a way to reset Norton AntiVirius 2012 to 90 days. That is what the final version will include. A 90 days reset for NAV aswell which is currently only 60 days in the BETA version.

3. Infinite means a never ending crack? I don't think that is possible but if the crack becomes obsolete, BOX will most likely have a look at it and if he don't there will be others fixing it. If not, we have no crack. You can still get 120 days NIS 2012 by using stable NTR 2011 3.3.1 on NIS 2011, then grab the key and use it on nis 2012.

4. Description about what?"
,Noblekc,2011-10-09T12:08Z,"thanx a lot, bro for this upload.. i sha;; try it and give a feedback too. may I ask, why is the RESET just for 90 days and not up to one year or 365 days..  there use to be that before now.. thanx anyway."
,.h10.,2011-10-09T20:41Z,"it is not possible to create a trial reset higher than 90 days for norton 2012 due to the recent changes symantec did with the product keys for the 2012 version. i can't really go in to details and it would be to much to explain.

90 days is enough.  you only have to reset norton 3 or 4 times before nis 2013 is out.

"
,genio2k,2011-10-10T00:34Z,"thanx h10 for the above!!
question 4 was ""give me/us a detailed explanation""...you read decription...LOL
anyway than you for the clarifications.
I can rest, knowing that the NIS 2012 TR will work over and over....its just 3 clicks before the 2013 come out than you !"
,Tatletz,2011-10-10T08:56Z,"Hi guys, just do what i did: Install NIS 2011, then use NTR 2011 by !BOX to get your 120 days. Once done just update it to NIS 2012 and you will have NIS 2012 with 120 days remaining."
