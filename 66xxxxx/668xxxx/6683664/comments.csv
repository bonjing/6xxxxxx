""with our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country"""
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-09-19T03:29Z,"Let the [dead]97gsx bury the dead.  Get a shovel, dead, and do every young person on the planet a favor. Hurry.  Seriously.  Or reject death and embrace Life."
,dead97gsx,2011-09-20T13:32Z,"Mandela = death 

How well off are the people today? Farms? Industry?

South Africa has the highest HIV transmission rates on the planet but everyone was busy celebrating Mandela (who did nothing)"
,indiaman,2011-09-20T19:39Z,Thanks for this great story of a great man.
,dead97gsx,2011-09-23T01:55Z,"WooHoo! Mandela! 

South Africans are now free...free to die with the Worlds #1 ranking in HIV and death from AIDS.

,shesashairy,2012-02-05T18:31Z,"Thank you, one of the most inspirational humans who ever walked the earth. Dead97gsx you are a braindoner and an expensive waste of the earths resources. Mandela was in a windowless cell, with a ceiling lower than his height and shoes too small for his feet for over 2 generations. YOUR SORT caused the problems in Africa. "
