As Kiki, the singing half of the subversive cabaret duo Kiki & Herb, Justin Bond created an indelible character: a boozy, bitchy, batty old nightclub entertainer, full of hilariously obscene tales and given to unexpectedly moving renditions of songs by everyone from Dan Fogelberg to Eminem. Now performing (and living) as Justin Vivian Bondâ€”with a middle name added to reflect a transsexual identityâ€”s/he has released a pretty terrific solo album.

A dendrophile is a lover of trees, and Bondâ€”a fixture of New York and San Francisco over the past few decadesâ€”says many of these songs were composed during retreats to a haven in our own Tennessee mountains. Thereâ€™s even some Appalachian musical influence, in the banjo-driven â€œEquipoiseâ€ and in the way the seductive â€œSalomeâ€ lifts part of its melody from â€œWayfaring Stranger.â€ But Bondâ€™s diverse tastes also range to stormy jazz, piano pop, slinky soul, and a fine Joni Mitchell cover. A medley of the Carpentersâ€™ â€œSuperstarâ€ and Joan Baezâ€™s â€œDiamonds and Rustâ€ shows an undimmed genius for interpretation and interpolation, turning them into an eight-minute meditation on fame, desire, and regret. Also intact is the arch ribaldry that animated Kiki, in lines like â€œHeavenâ€™s in the palm of your hand/Reach in your pocket and stroke it.â€ Even on the ostensibly elegiac â€œIn the End,â€ Bond canâ€™t resist the entendre in the title, quavering, â€œWe all get it in the endâ€â€”as if we should all be so lucky. Overall, Dendrophile makes a strong case for Bondâ€™s singular talents. It is warm, angry, funny, and fierce.
