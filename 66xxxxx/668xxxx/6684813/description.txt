After extracting it you can open the folder.
Sometimes there will be a download link to the font that I jused or the font itself.

A pop up will come and say that there are some missing files. Now you can do 2 things:

*You can say find new location or replacement file and indicate the missing files.

Step 4.

Now you only have to change the text and render it and you have your own intro. Sometimes you also have to replace a picture that says 'video/pic here' with a video of picture of course.
