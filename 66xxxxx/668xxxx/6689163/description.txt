Old but very nice album from our unforgettable Serge Gainsbourg unfortunately died too early.(died in March 2 1991 in Paris)
a singer-songwriter, pianist, writer, director, writer, actor and French filmmaker .
Big man and very very original french singer and fantastic artist,before all.
This specific album was specially manufactured in Jamaica in order to give a reggae theme in collaboration with some local musicians to get the best sound quality and atmosphere as faithfully as possible.
Excellent sound !
Comes from my personal collection.
A must have anyway for any fan of him.
Most of tracks are often quite short but really pleasant to listening anyway.

converted to mp3 cbr-stereo-256 kbps-44 khz without error.

-->>respecfully dedicated in memory of Serge...
with a delicate thought to Charlotte,Jeanne Birkin and many more.
      

We never forget you,friend !
