,fredfl09,2011-09-21T03:10Z,Why-o-why is the file size 700Megs??? Normal size for 720p tv shows is 1.1gig.
,lailabagge,2011-09-21T10:54Z,"And why, oh why do they still insist on using the rar archiving system?! It's almost 20 years old!!!"
,fall1en,2011-09-26T05:03Z,"Thanks! 

Poor baby,  complaining about rar files. So it takes you a minute to unpack your tv show, big whoop!"
,killthestate,2011-09-27T03:54Z,not only that it takes up twice the room for no fuckin reason. RAR IS DEAD
,fall1en,2011-09-27T05:23Z,"whining babies, the lot of ya! No thank you to the up loader for his effort huh? Just criticism is all you can think to sprout out your mouths. 
Delete the rar files once you've unpacked it, if you're unhappy with the amount of space it takes up. lmao!"
,BigJRM,2011-09-27T16:04Z,Thanks a lot!!! Great show!! I found the resolution very good and this file is complete!! (Another one was not!!) Thanks again for a great upload!!!

The only thing worse than a complaining brat, is youl. Delete it? Wthat the hell, you mean you'r not seeding?"
,Vegasbob,2012-01-02T12:38Z,"Sorry but this is some kind of goony goohoo upload. I dunno wtf the uploader did to what was probably a decent DIMENSION rip but they pretty much trashed it. Not only is it a RAR for some fuckin weird reason, it's a mulitipart rar...WTF exactly is the point of that? 

Also the sound is so fucking overmodulated it's almost unbearable to listen to. 

Dude.. I dunno if you reencoded this or this Speed.cd place is really this shity but please don't ever do this again....this is garbage"
