,qu3tz,2011-09-25T00:10Z,"Can anyone confirm whether this actually has the Mac version, unlike the other one labelled win & mac?"
,qu3tz,2011-09-25T01:19Z,"It is indeed the Mac version, and it works with no fuss! Thanks."
,CBFTD,2011-09-27T03:19Z,"Can't find the ""Assign"" folder, where do I look?"
,MoonDookie,2011-10-01T02:01Z,"the winrar file name is too long and i cant open it, tried winzip, winrar and 7zip.
WTF?"
,Keloskies,2011-10-04T08:14Z,"@MoonDonkey just rename and take away all the unnecesary characters (for example, from 2011 on) ;P"
,lyndagrant,2011-10-08T00:03Z,Help!  I have downloaded to my Mac but came through as 29 RAR files - what do I do next???
,lyndagrant,2011-10-08T00:21Z,Ignore previous post - I worked it out - needed Stuffit to expand the files.  Another quick question..... 7.2 available is it OK to update?
,urig94,2011-10-12T12:12Z,thats great! works perfectly on the mac-BUT WHAT ABOUT THE 3G of sounds that avid provide? will they be available and support this installation type on the mac?

,jackiass,2011-11-09T22:20Z,For the mac people. This is NOT V. 7.0.2.8 but 7.0.0 - the Dynamics release :( I wish we could get an update that was not fake.
,surya_tpb,2011-12-02T19:49Z,"the patch doesn't work
it still asks for the serial number abd says that the software is for 30 day evaluation"
,surya_tpb,2011-12-02T19:57Z,"plz ignore my above comment, got rid of the problem"
,ChairmanCross,2011-12-12T20:17Z,How do I fix the crack problem???
,lumichan,2012-01-25T10:31Z,"It works! Thanks a lot! :O The only things are that I'm not sure if Sibelius needed a crack or something because it never asked me to put any serial number, and this is the Dynamics release D:.... so it's pretty fake o_o... "
,joelski20,2012-05-28T20:05Z,Anyone had any problems unraring? Got 29 files but getting the 'incomplete archive' error...
