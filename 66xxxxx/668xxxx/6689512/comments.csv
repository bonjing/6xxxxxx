,blumacaw,2011-09-23T12:10Z,"@vivek36929: You know nothing about what I did. I already checked, both copies are not that good. And there's another copy too, which is not so good, it can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6690652
Don't think that you are the brainy guy and others are stupid. Moreover I like the quality of MRShanku. And last but not he least, I didn't request him to do it, I enquired whether he is doing it. There is a difference between enquiry and request."
