,RedBusterd,2011-09-22T02:16Z,"yet another high quality upload by BONE. thank you brother.

as for the movie itself it sucks beyond crap..."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2011-09-22T07:56Z,"Thanks for the upload, but there is a smudge mark on the camera lens, which is very apparent at the top middle throughout the movie.

As far as the movie is concerned, it's blatant fear mongering, just in time for the flu vaccine season. Coincidence? Unlikely.

We know the Illuminati inspect, and sometimes write, every Hollywood script."
,ilovefatgirls,2011-09-23T06:28Z,ty for the upload bro
,ilovefatgirls,2011-09-23T06:31Z,for all the tards that dont understand tpb or utilities for it stay off good quality best out spend 15 bucks if ya dont like the shit ..
,pennknig,2011-09-23T11:50Z,"GENRE:
Drama - I think the cast was on mood stabilizers, nothing, absolutely nothing in the form of dramatic acting,,,my 9 year old daughter does a better job at acting!
Si-Fi - OK, can agree to that
Thriller - Not A Chance!!!  The most boring dribble I have seen in the past year.  I fell asleep through it 3 time, still haven't seen the end.

Don't waist your bandwidth or time on this one."
,watbol,2011-09-23T15:28Z,"Very Good, Nice 16:9-WideScreen movie.
Keep up the Good Werk¡!

,Bear_And_Bone,2011-09-23T17:25Z,"@Gaddifi1... How are you gonna use someone else's shit to spread your gay website marketing garbage? 
You remind me of those magazine salesmen that come to your door acting all cult-ish and spewing empty excitement.
 People like you, sir, have cheapened internet piracy and you should be deeply ashamed. 
A little more ashamed than .Bone. should be for the quality of this upload, 
but not as ashamed as the casting agencies who continue to put Matt Damon in feature films should be."
,geeman777,2011-09-23T18:08Z,"Thx Bone, not the best of copies but watchable. bit of a dissapointing ending to an otherwise good film."
,theriddler19,2011-09-23T20:20Z,Amazing copy for a cam! Thanks BONE 
,GLOC,2011-09-24T02:36Z,"TNX Bone,  A Meh/V Meh. Any chance you have WARRIOR? A zillion crappy virus movies but not what we've been waiting for;)"
,joo-loved-it,2011-09-24T11:50Z,"bigcashjack78 i don't understand what you are trying to tell me. is it.......something about the cropping.........what's that boy......trouble at the old mill..........nuh, didn't get it.........oooooohhh the cropping is really bad......well why didn't you say so."
,kevdogg,2011-09-24T16:17Z,can someone upload 30 minutes or less.

,watbol,2011-09-25T05:39Z,"Agreed with:TalmudTimmy...
