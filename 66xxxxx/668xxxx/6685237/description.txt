Release Notes:

Three is definitely the magic number for The Subways; echoing the gap
between their debut and follow-up, Money And Celebrity has been three
years in the making since All Or Nothing rocked TMF Towers and Ã» clichÃš
alert Ã» itÃ†s been worth the wait. As with Arctic Monkeys on Suck It And
See, Money And Celebrity finds the band melding elements from their
previous efforts to come up with a sound that is quintessentially their
own, providing a high octane, tight blast of indie pop/rock along the
way.

Opening with the frenetic Ã¦ItÃ†s A PartyÃ†, the album barely pauses for
breath with a succession of tracks clocking in around the three minute
mark - and itÃ†s to the bandÃ†s credit that they never blend into one
another, partly due to clever track listing. The jaunty Ã¦Down Our
StreetÃ† is deftly followed by the dirty bass-heavy opening of Ã¦RumourÃ†,
for example, but the tracks all share something in common: the innate
ability to latch into your memory. The immediacy of the entire album is
really quite incredible, especially in the case of the aforementioned
Ã¦Down Our StreetÃ† which might not be BillyÃ†s strongest songwriting
moment (Ã´Every door has something more to talk about / Every problem
finds a way to get aroundÃ¶) and yet, we'll bet our house youÃ†re still
singing the chorus days later.

Lead single Ã¦We DonÃ†t Need Money To Have A Good TimeÃ† is an absolute
blast, a rollicking beast of a track with a naysayers be damned
attitude Ã» Ã´We got no education but we find a way / Not gonna be the
ones to walk awayÃ¶. You get the feeling that itÃ†s going to be a
foundation shaker live and, if anything, the same could be said of the
majority of Money And Celebrity. ItÃ†s as though it was written with the
live arena firmly in mind with the likes of soft acoustic sections
leading to big endings (Ã¦RumourÃ†), clapping refrains (Ã¦I Wanna Dance
With YouÃ†) and, for most of the tracks, effectively simplistic
singalong choruses. It doesnÃ†t diminish the listen on CD but thereÃ†s no
doubt tracks will be elevated by being played in front of a receptive
crowd.

It's generally strong lyrically as well, mainly casting a window on
todayÃ†s society focussing on the titular topics. The protagonist of
Ã¦CelebrityÃ† is not too dissimilar from a reality TV star, essentially
someone who wants to be famous without doing anything: Ã´She wants to
ride in a chauffeured car / Her photograph in the morning papers / Cos
in this world itÃ†s who you are / And all she knows is she wants to be
famousÃ¶. While Ã¦PopdeathÃ† is horribly relevant given recent events Ã»
Ã´And you can care if you really want / Sing their songs when theyÃ†re
dead and gone / You can bleed for the tortured souls / Too much sex and
rockÃ†nÃ†rollÃ¶. It might not be the subtlest but gives the album an
obvious spine that lends it a cohesion.

It lacks the variation that All Or Nothing provided but when not one
filler is delivered along the way, it seems churlish to complain -
especially when the outstanding Ã¦Leave My SideÃ† ends proceedings. One
of the best things The Subways have ever done, itÃ†s a heartfelt,
powerful track that encompasses everything about the band: catchy
chorus, deft male/female vocal harmonies and a big riff to hold it all
together. Money And Celebrity confirms them as one of the most exciting
British bands around and we can only hope it brings them the commercial
success they thoroughly deserve. Treasure it, itÃ†s might be all we have
for another three years.

Deluxe edition which comes with a bonus CD called "Billy's Demo
Recordings". Enjoy!
