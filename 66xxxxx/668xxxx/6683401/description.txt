Synthetic diamond is diamond produced by using chemical or physical processes. Like naturally occurring diamond it is composed of a three-dimensional carbon crystal. Due to its extreme physical properties, synthetic diamond is used in many industrial applications, such as drill bits and scratch-proof coatings, and has the potential to be used in many new application areas

A brand new title from the respected Wiley Materials for Electronic and Optoelectronic Applications series, this title is the most up-to-date resource for diamond specialists. Beginning with an introduction to the properties of diamond, defects, impurities and the growth of CVD diamond with its imminent commercial impact, the remainder of the book comprises six sections: introduction, radiation sensors, active electronic devices, biosensors, MEMs and electrochemistry. Subsequent chapters cover the diverse areas in which diamond applications are having an impact including electronics, sensors and actuators and medicine.
