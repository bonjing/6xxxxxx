GAME INFO:

  Xotic is an arcade-style first-person shooter where you rack up huge scores
  by shooting enemies, detonating chain reactions, and discovering secret
  power-ups and point multipliers. Armed with a weaponized symbiotic creature
  called the Macroterra, you must cleanse the evil presence and re-plant the
  seeds of life on a planet ravaged by the minions of the Orb.

  Destroy the insidious scab plants and new life will grow in their place,
  diminishing the OrbÃ†s control of the planet. Trigger scab plant chain
  reactions to earn score multipliers and chain bonus points. Collect Orb
  essence to boost your score, or grab them in mid-air to earn an aerial
  combo bonus. Seek out and destroy the hidden Orb brains and collect all of
  the Orb essence in each level for even more points.

  Earn experience points to upgrade your weapons and skills, including
  Absorbtion which pulls points towards you automatically! Unlock the
  secrets of Ã´Hard HologramÃ¶ technology to deploy mobile shields or aerial
  landing platforms.

  Xotic is a unique arcade shooter experience unlike anything youÃ†ve played
  before.
