,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-09-20T14:18Z,If you try to put this on a large HDTV it is shit quality. Just an FYI. I appreciate the upload but this isn't even better than some of the cam versions. Might as well be one. A/V 10/5. Just being honest. Not complaining.
[T],Jon.Pson,2011-09-24T13:02Z,It's a DVDRIP. Nothing else. No cam or telecine. DvdRip.
,Roisia,2011-09-27T04:08Z,"It's a DvDRip, yes. That's what it says on the tin. Don't know why everyone's expecting it to be something else..."
