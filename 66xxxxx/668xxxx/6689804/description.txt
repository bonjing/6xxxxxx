    The Turbulent makes its way toward the troubled waters     
    of the Middle East, becoming the first British            
    submarine to pass through the Suez Canal since the       
    Egyptian revolution - a nervous moment for all            
    concerned. Arriving at the Bab el Mendeb Strait between    
    Somalia and Yemen, Captain Ryan Ramsey and his crew       
    have to conduct anti-piracy operations throughout the    
    night. At the same time, there are new recruits to be     
    trained for action, while Richard and Timmo both find      
    themselves at a turning point in their careers. Last in   
    the series.
