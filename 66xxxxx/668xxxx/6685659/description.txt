It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is an American television sitcom that premiered on FX on August 4, 2005. New episodes continue to air on FX, with reruns playing on Comedy Central and WGN Americaâ€”the first-ever cable-to-cable syndication deal for a sitcom.[1] The show was created and developed by Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day, who also star on the show. The series follows the exploits of "The Gang," a group of self-centered friends who run Paddy's Pub, a relatively unsuccessful Irish bar in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
