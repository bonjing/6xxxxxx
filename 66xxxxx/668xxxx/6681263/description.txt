"The Microphone Book will save you time and money, even if you only ever buy one microphone to use in a home studio. If you do live sound, record on location, or are kitting out a slightly more ambitious project studio, then this book will be invaluable. It takes you far further than the 'microphone' sections of general guides to studio recording."
