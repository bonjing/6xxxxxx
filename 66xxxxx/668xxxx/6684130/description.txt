TeraCopy Pro is a compact program designed to copy and move files at the maximum possible speed, providing the user with a lot of features: 

â€¢Copy files faster. TeraCopy uses dynamically adjusted buffers to reduce seek times. Asynchronous copy speeds up file transfer between two physical hard drives. 

â€¢Pause and resume file transfers. Pause copy process at any time to free up system resources and continue with a single click. 

â€¢Error recovery. In case of copy error, TeraCopy will try several times and in the worse case just skip the file, not terminating the entire transfer.

â€¢Interactive file list. TeraCopy shows failed file transfers and lets you fix the problem and recopy only problem files.

â€¢Shell integration. TeraCopy can completely replace Explorer copy and move functions, allowing you work with files as usual. 

â€¢Full Unicode support. 

â€¢Windows 7 x64 support. 

â€¢Copy/move to favorite folders.

â€¢Select files with the same extension/same folder.

â€¢Remove selected files from the copy queue.

â€¢More features coming soon!
