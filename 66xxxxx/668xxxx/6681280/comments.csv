,frspoa,2011-09-20T15:28Z,"Very bad quality, audio changes to chinese some times and the sound desyncs at the end. like from 2/3 to the end. Also has a vertical distortion on 1/3 of the screen.

Video: 6/10
Audio: 6/10"

,Ethelwulf,2011-10-15T00:09Z,"Only thing I'm upset about, is you called a cam a Blue Ray rip.  At best it's a Transfer Stream.  The misleading title should be changed, or moderated.  Using a fake title to get more downloads, will only get you negative quality votes, which will put you further away from getting a skull.

Somewhat watchable cam, 4/10 ABSOLUTELY NOT a Blue Ray rip."
