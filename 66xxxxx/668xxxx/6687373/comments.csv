,squish0601,2011-09-26T22:44Z,"I was stupid enough to not have removed the old version first and then just installed this version over the old one.
Problem now is, it wont crack. Any ideas? Iv tried to uninstall, remove all the files for dvdfab and then reinstall this version. But still doesnt crack.
Any ideas?"

,oldtimer48,2011-10-12T04:32Z,"I downloaded this version in preference to the later version due to simplicity. It works fine, simple to follow installation instructions.  Thanks ChattChitto, everything of yours I have used over the years has worked, I had the old version 7.0.8.2 which also was great. Thank you ChattChitto you are a legend"
