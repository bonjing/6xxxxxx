,turbo_dude555,2011-10-05T00:36Z,"This is excellent, more exposing of the facts is essential. It's hilarious that there's people trolling the truth. It doesn't matter how many ""experts"" you have, the truth is not statistical! Millions question 9/11 and with good reason, there's something obviously fishy. When several universities around the globe have found traces of explosives in the WTCs, it's hard to avoid the inevitable question: What really happened?..."
,winston000smith,2011-10-23T18:14Z,"I couldn't agree more, thinking for yourself and questioning things makes you stupid and a crackpot.

Simply take the point of view of Popular Mechanics and those who haven't looked too deeply into it, stick with the majority view - that's what intelligent people do.

Always be sure to deny what you've seen with your own eyes and go back to sleep like a good boy. Well done!"
