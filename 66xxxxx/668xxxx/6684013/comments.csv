,end77,2011-09-18T21:47Z,50cent got his back xD ... surprised to see him
,nightmears,2011-09-19T00:23Z,"After watching this fight im sort of thinking that this was all staged. I didnt at first but when you take a look at it it starts to look like a well scripted WWE event (as much as i really hate to admit it), possibly because he is trying to get the pay day for the PACMAN fight that will eventually take place after this. "
,se7en77,2011-09-19T03:33Z,That's what that beaner gets! Fuck yeah he'll think twice next time hahahahah 
,dbthorn61,2011-09-19T07:17Z,"first of all that is so stupid to use the word nigger whiteylion especially if your referring to blacks they have shown racists like yourself that that word is no longer offensive because they use it amongst themselves like ""what's up dude""..so it doesn't hurt them anymore...but i do have to side with mayweather on the cheapshot everybody forgets the cheap shot that ortiz gave mayweather..and i am a boxer and if the ref did not send them to thier nuetural corners then it is stil a live round and u must protect yourself at all times..and if anybody would have intentionally tried to headbutt me i would have done the same thing boxing is not for wusses it is a brutal and bloody sport if you don't like mayweather then get your asses in there and beat him yourself..and if pacquiao stop using steriods then he would not have turned down all of that money so pacquiao is the bitch for using drugs..and besides he is fighting all the fighters that mayweather already beat so what has pacquiao really proved? NOT A DAMN THING....PEACE"
,stigmashocks,2011-09-19T13:53Z,dbthorn61.... You are wrong. Mayweather is Gayweather... Pacquiao accepted all the agreement but still Gayweather making excuses...
,makanmakan,2011-09-19T19:27Z,There's too much gay shit on this fight.  Can't wait to see Manny whoop Gayweathers black hairy ass. Dirty Bitch!
,muvelvr,2011-09-20T07:12Z,"not really too mad about the cheap knockdown cause mayweather could have actually had 2 good reasons for that..
1. being pissed off at this fool doing a super headbutt-hop to the chin that could in NO WAY be mistaken as accidental..
2. wanting to take an easy opportunity to end a fight that was going to go in his favor ANYWAY, which was obvious the way ortiz was getting handled.  

i think mayweathers mind was already on the money he was going to blow after the fight and the hoes he was gona smash with 50 cent

ortiz was happy cause his gay move got overshadowed by floyd's thats why he wasnt that mad about it"
,muvelvr,2011-09-20T07:19Z,"and why do people actually think manny is a good fighter and has a good chance at beating mayweather? ever actually WATCH them box before?

manny has no skills. all he has is explosive punches. mayweather is like the definition of perfected blocking positioning speed and accuracy.. anyone who denies those facts are obviously trying to jump on the ""hate the black man on top"" wagon or some shit.  maybe its because its cocky i dont know.. his talent creates a desire in the audience to cheer for the underdog, which is always his opponent. am i wrong?"
,ybabjyp,2011-09-21T09:05Z,"What on earth was getiatric Cortez upto, looked like he was still taking the point of when he called the fighters together."
,nyriesark,2011-09-27T07:07Z,thanks for this...I don't know why I bothered looking anywhere else...I knew i'd get it here :)
