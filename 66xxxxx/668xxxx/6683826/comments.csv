,xtester71,2011-09-23T05:30Z,"oh shit, wiki was wrong! guess it updated or something. sorry A2Aegis =P"
,Daniccus,2011-09-24T20:19Z,"hes right to label this ep 1 but the other guy is also right that this is ep 2, they did the same thing last season when it started, hour premiere, first ep shown was sneak peak which was ep 2 then second ep shown was premiere which was ep 1, no idea why they did it then or why they did it again"
