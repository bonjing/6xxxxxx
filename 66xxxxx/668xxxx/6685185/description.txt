Street Art 

Information
The term Street Art has evolved to define the more visual and engaging aspects of urban art, as opposed to simply text-based graffiti and tagging. This film follows such notorious cult figures as: Blek Le Rat, Nano 4814, Nuria, Sweet Toof, NoNose, and Eine, as they work upon the pavements of Paris Londonand Madrid During the film we pursue these characters as they create new pieces and discuss the varying approaches to Street Art in these three diverse cities.

We also meet some of the artists taking part in the first ever Street Art exhibition at Tate Modern, and explore the rapidly expanding commercial market that\'s turning street artists into big earners at the auction houses. What does this newfound profitable aspect mean for this formerly underground and anti-establishment scene?
