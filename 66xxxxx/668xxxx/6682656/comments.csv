720p is the hight of the movie."
,twilight_nexus,2011-09-17T19:01Z,"hey dude, what happened ? u wanna lose the green skull ?"
,babydollsuckerpunch,2011-09-17T19:31Z,Dont lie dude! if it aint 720p then it aint
,Thootje,2011-09-17T19:47Z,The Screens are 1280 by 544 though. Check them out. Guess he made a mistake and thus it is real 720p. The file size would be way to large for those dimensions. 
,JUSTlN182,2011-09-17T20:55Z,"guys it is 1280 x 544
the description is a mistake, not the file"
,-peas-,2011-09-18T07:46Z,"OMG ppl STFU if you don't understand what anamorphic widescreen is. This movie was released in 2.35:1 extra wide format. Unless you're wanting some weird horiz res between 1280 and 1920, the vertical lines have to change. Yes this is still considered 720p.
Now instead of complaining why don't you guys pls comment on the A/V quality."
,starvg95,2011-09-18T13:28Z,A/V??
,starvg95,2011-09-18T13:29Z,A/V???
,Jewhan023,2011-09-18T22:29Z,"A-3(mixed english and japanese+ not that good)
V-5
It's crap."
,chrismichaeld1,2011-09-20T08:03Z,I don't know why anyone is surprised. Froggie100 is the worst uploader on this site. If he puts up anything be assured its a crappy cam that is labeled something else. Really can't wait for that dbag to lose his skull. 
[V],froggie100,2011-09-20T17:56Z,"@ chrismichaeld1 

i upload cams for you guys  who cares if they are shit quality you get em for free.. if you want to pay watch these movies go ahead .. dont go commenting on my page sayin shit. i do not see you upping anything .. im pirate and i am proud."
,chrismichaeld1,2011-09-22T07:45Z,"@froggie100.

I don't have any problem with you uploading cams. In fact I have watched a few and appreciate it very much. However what I and many other pirates have a problem with is you uploading cams to the high-res section. If its a cam, then put it in the right place. "
,cgcdvd,2011-09-22T14:41Z,"Thats all we ask, proper placement!"
,deeku356,2011-09-22T17:31Z,plz upload kung fu panda 2 dvdrip... plz...
,onehappyman916,2011-09-25T04:58Z,"Seriously froggie100, you upload cams which is great, but label them as cams and categorize them properly. Blowing it up does not make it a high-res movie."
