,03oliwri,2011-09-20T19:22Z,Audio is so bad its giving me a headache
,siamthai,2011-09-20T19:25Z,Surprised that eztv uploads such a bad torrent. Not complete (missing the first seconds) and terrible sound.
,rydah-,2011-09-20T21:41Z,"This was the worst episode of Two and a Half Men ever. I heard they were gonna say he went to Paris with Chelsea, but since they killed him, I guess this is the death of the show. What a failure.."
,killthestate,2011-09-20T22:43Z,WTF were they thinking... I cant watch this vile shit. Without charlie this show is fuckin gay!!!
,Slickmik69,2011-09-21T04:38Z,What a fuken discrace our beloved charley in a dust buster while dick face fuks in his room to watch this season is an insult to all of mankind they can't have to bitches on the show it's just wrong !!

I will never watch another episode of this crap cuz it just completely sux balls without Charlie Sheen. The guy is a complete turd just like Alan... who wants to watch 2 Alans? it just fucking blows... "
,ashen77,2011-09-22T01:23Z,"if youve enjoyed this show from the start then you must have the mental age of an 8 year old, so why all the bitching? I'm amazed you can actually form a sentance to articulate your grievances."
,ashen77,2011-09-22T01:28Z,"Wow, i've just read all the comments here. You should of all been drowned at birth. Please dont procreate and add yet more feces to the gene pool."
,chrisisawesome1213,2011-09-22T02:34Z,"Although Ashton Kutcher is horrible in this part Charlie Sheen acted like a dick in front of Chuck Lorre and if he cancelled the show because of firing Charlie then Charlie would have won. So if you think about it, continuing this show is about pride"
,club1820,2011-09-22T05:17Z,Downright sad watching this. In the manner they killed off Charlie.  Can't see this show lasting beyond this season. No way they get another 28mil to watch Kutcher play Kelso AGAIN.
,lobo345,2011-09-22T11:33Z,Didn't laugh even one time during the whole episode. This is a sad end to a great show.

A/V could have been better, missing a few minutes, and out of sync. For the show, it's going to suck without Sheen. Period."
,xAnamolyx,2011-09-23T06:20Z,1.8MB/s Nice! Use VLC -300ms to sync the audio
,Kazer123,2011-09-24T21:58Z,"Datz a sad episode...........it really really sucks.......not a single punch line is funny...
To begin with , the show was not that great.....but charlies antics and no care attitude made it work......
now its just boring.......
i was feelin sleepy after watching 5 mins.......
I know its just the begining.....but i don""t see a future for this show.......they should have(chuck lorre) scrapped the show when they had a chance........instead of making a fool of themself........"
,Sixpacksixpack,2011-09-24T22:13Z,"Pretty sure the show will be cancelled soon enough. Kutcher sucks at comedy, period. And without Charlie the storyline is broken. Like why the hell would Waldon Schmidt tolerate Alan and his farting offspring if they are not family? It would look artificial.

I think Lorre prolonged the show for only one reason - to prove a point to Sheen that the show can continue without him when it really can't. After a few episodes this will be cancelled anyway."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-25T21:23Z,"I have watched it only to confirm that this series is NOTHING without Charlie Sheen and I wasn't wrong. Charlie Sheen was the only reason for me to watch it, though I haven't been the biggest fan of it. I'm glad that these suckers fired him cause now he can put his talent into something real. "
,danihel,2011-09-25T22:26Z,after reading the comments i thought to end up writing here something like the only person who probably laughed at it was charlie sheen but actually to my surprise it was much better than i expected
,Girl_Gone_Wild,2011-09-27T05:28Z,"I liked it and laughed throughout.
Ashton was great - I think it's going to be just as good as when Charlie was in it."
,shadowao,2011-09-28T05:26Z,"@ sixpacksixpack, watch that 70's show and then fucking tell us kutcher isn't good at comedy "
,Antarte,2011-10-10T05:42Z,"Two and a half men IS Charlie Harper. This season 9 is about the other characters and some new guy. (I like this guy, but no body replaces Charlie)."
,dfro,2011-10-10T16:20Z,they have lowered the standards of this show. it will take some time to get use to ashton but the show will never be what it was like with sheen. for the sake of the show they should have just stopped and begin with something new cause now they're going to ruin a pretty good show
,myownworld131,2011-10-21T07:41Z,The show is absolute shit without Charlie. That's all there is to it.
,walsh9239,2011-11-01T03:09Z,sry took so long to comment on this but its great been looking forward to it for so long :)
,Aahzman,2012-02-04T19:23Z,"This episode is what I will consider the series finale. Charlie's dead, let the show die with him. Kutcher sucks the stale sweat off a dead monkey's balls, and Jon Cryer is only funny as a joke target for Charlie Sheen.  RIP 2.5Men."
