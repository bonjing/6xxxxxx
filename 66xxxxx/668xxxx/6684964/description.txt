PokÃ©mon goes sci-fi.

As the pokÃ©mon movies go, I did find this one of the least painful. All the usual criticisms apply, but the setting is interesting, and the Deoxys is not your run-of-the-mill pokÃ©mon. I wouldn\'t go so far to call this a good film, but I would say it\'s perhaps the best of the pokÃ©mon films so far.


Quite an excess of languages here. You get both Japanese and English audio, plus six included softsubs. Two English (Official DVD subtitles matching the english audio, or a more faithful fan translation), two Chinese (Traditional and Simplified) plus Italian and Spanish.

DVDrip. Not HD. Quality looks very good though.
