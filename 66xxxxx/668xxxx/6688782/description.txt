Live concert Frank Zappa performance recorded at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney, Australia on 20 January 1976.

From wikipedia:

FZ:OZ (pronounced "eff-zee oh-zee"; in imitation of "Aussie") is a live album by Frank Zappa, released in 2002 as a two-CD set and is the first release on the Vaulternative Records label from the Zappa Family Trust. It contains almost all of a January 20, 1976 concert at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney, Australia.

Only one reel-to-reel tape machine was available to record the concert, however, resulting in gaps in some songs as the tape needed to be changed. These gaps have been filled in with bootleg recordings from the same tour. As a result there is a drop in sound quality during these sections, but the concert is preserved almost in its entirety.

Much of the featured material had not been released at the time of the recording, including "Canard Toujours", which later became "Let's Move to Cleveland", then later changed to Kreega Bondola, which was included on Does Humor Belong in Music? (1986) and several tracks that would later appear on Zoot Allures (1976). One song, "Kaiser Rolls", appears for the first time on FZ:OZ, and in two versionsâ€”the recording from the concert, which has had a missing section edited in, and a rehearsal version recorded before the start of the tour which is included at the end of disc two, entitled "Kaiser Rolls (Du Jour)". "Zoot Allures" contains long wah-wah guitar solo subsequently entitled as "Ship Ahoy" however it wasn't separated into own track.
