Guiding nutritionists toward an understanding of the scientific principles underlying what they know about nutrition, this book helps them gain effective decision-making skills about nutritional choices. Unique Science Applied boxes answer the questions about how we learn what we know about the science of nutrition and why knowledge changes. Critical Thinking exercises included in each chapter allow them to learn the basics of how to think about a problem or situation creatively and critically. A case study is also included in each chapter that builds interest in the material. Each chapter then concludes with a postscript that solidifies the nutritionistsâ€™ understanding of the links between the science and application.

THE CHOICE IS YOURS

Ice cream or sorbet, red meat or fish, fruits or pastries, eggs or oatmeal-our lives are filled with choices about what we eat.  That's why Lori Smolin and Mary Grosvenor's Nutrition: Science and Applications, 4/E helps you understand how to analyze nutritional information and apply your knowledge to the nutrition issues you face each and every day.

Now updated to include the new Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) published in the fall of 2002, the Fourth Edition offers new and expanded coverage of such cutting-edge nutritional topics as the relationship between genetics and body weight regulation and the ecological impact of genetically modified foods and organic food production. In addition, this edition features a new chapter, Meeting Nutrient Needs: Food Versus Supplements, which discusses the benefits and drawbacks of meeting nutritional needs with foods, fortified foods, and supplements, as well as the role of herbal supplements.
