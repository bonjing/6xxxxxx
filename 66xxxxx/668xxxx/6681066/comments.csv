many many thanks tdk for providing the initial seeding info ! i did not know that !

previously i had that 256/512 kbps connection & i ran my laptop almost 20 hours/day ! it was damaged completely within 2 years ! so i switched to night unlimited ( 500 /- ) !

Once upon a time Gopal Krishna Gokhale said - "" what bengal thinks today india thinks tomorrow "" - for Bengalese ! but i think it was true 50 years before ! now time has changed & i can easily say "" what South Indians  thinks today india thinks tomorrow "" ! 

Many Many thanks for your helping & kind words ! lol..
