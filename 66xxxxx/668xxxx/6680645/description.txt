No Need For Patches Or Serials Just Run Installer And Enjoy The Game!

Hey, can ya answer a question for me? Maybe itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m older than the dirt Iâ€™m standinâ€™ on, but why is it every Match 3 puzzle game makes ya get 3-in-a-row? Not just 3 touching â€“ 3 in a row. If ya had 3 chickens with one in front, one to the side, and one behind, thatâ€™s still 3 chickens, right? Thatâ€™s a match, inâ€™t?
