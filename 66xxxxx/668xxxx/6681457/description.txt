Sing a Song of Wiggles is the new collection of nursery rhymes and songs from The Wiggles.

With the runaway worldwide success of Pop Go The Wiggles!, it was clear that children and parents embraced the songs and stories from our literary past and so The Wiggles have since recorded a brand new collection of nursery rhyme favourites in their latest release Sing a Song of Wiggles.

Anthony Field, the Blue Wiggle, states â€˜The music featured in this release gives children a valuable experience listening to organic instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, accordion and bouzouki!â€™

In addition to this, nursery rhymes allow children to experience language (Black Velvet Band), sound (Old MacDonald Had A Farm), rhyme (Humpty Dumpty), rhythm (Jack Be Nimble) and even mathematical understanding (One, Two, Three, Four, Five)! Most importantly, Sing a Song of Wiggles is so much fun!
