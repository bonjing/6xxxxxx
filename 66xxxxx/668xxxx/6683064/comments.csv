,bromhexine,2011-09-18T01:05Z,I've got the Gio. It's a great little phone I just love it to bits. With the backlight dimmed and only using g instead of 3g when possible the battery lasts and lasts. Also I found a cheap extended battery on ebay with about twice the juice and it works well. Anyhow thanks for the torrent!
