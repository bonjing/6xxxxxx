,kaise123,2011-09-17T15:47Z,"Great, lol. Also could anybody tell be if they are getting descend speeds from this, because i am not uploading at any speed, and it says there are no other seeders yet... Australia has the worst internet, don't ever come here. I can only get satellite and it has costed me $10 to just seed this torrent via the only other internet source (Moblile Broadband)"

Installed perfectly with no problems. great!

Thank you very very much!"

,thefreemi,2011-09-19T15:14Z,"Awesome torrent! That extra 256 mb has almost stopped all the lag! Now I just have to wait for Optifine to come out for 1.8.1, Thanks"
,SRRLSY,2011-09-20T03:45Z,"every time I open it, it crashes after I hit enter game. how do I fix it? any ideas"
,daganrus,2011-09-20T04:17Z,"To fix the crash at start up, select force update when at the launcher screen worked for me"
,kaise123,2011-09-20T09:04Z,"@thefreemi, What extra 256mb? (Ram?), and yes when optimine and optifog come out (Now OptiFine) i will bundle them into the next 1.8 torrent i do.

SRRLSY, What name are you typing? also, what is your computer hardware? I havent had any problems with it on any windows XP/Vista/7 laptops and desktops i have tested it on (About 10 all up) If you continue to have problems, than i will help you with getting an error output so i can fix it.

@daganrus, Thanks for the input, people could also try using the Basic (Unmodded) installer to fix this (The only difference from the version you get by doing 'Force Update' is that it removes the mods."
,kaise123,2011-09-20T09:30Z,"Currently the Planes Mod and Zombe's modpack are winning in the Poll. As Zombe's modpack was likely to stay anyway, i will add the planes mod (when it comes out) if it continues to be a high scorer (There has only been 16 votes so far...)"
,fml562,2011-09-21T03:03Z,Why doesnt the mods work? can anyone help
,kaise123,2011-09-21T06:12Z,"@fml562, are you using the modded version?, what happens when you press F and than E and Q to go up and down?

Read the readme for the controlls"
,kaise123,2011-09-21T06:13Z,"@koolrip, will add them to the list, thanks for your contribution. Probably only one or two of them will make it in tho"
,Amelia1987,2011-09-21T11:30Z,"I installed the modded version, but the mods didn't work. Pressed F and E and Q and everything. Nothing happened."
,TheGhost001,2011-09-21T17:08Z,"Thank you for Uploading this!
Would also want a 1.8.1 Cracked Server client if possible
Cheers"
,RolandRedJack,2011-09-23T09:39Z,"Just wanted you to know this is amazing. If you can any chance of adding the Millinare or any other NPC mod into it, even the creeps and weirdos one, a dynamic seasons mod might be good too but would probably cause lots of rendering lag. Great job at this, only thing it's missing is the Ather, which might be usable maybe as a seperate install and you could have two icons for it one standard with mods and one with mods compat with ather? anyways cant wait for the next release from you to see what mods you've added."
,Ibrahim001,2011-09-23T18:04Z,"Can you please add ""X-ray"" please?

i would be really thankful and i will seed as long as i am alive!

with regards"

I have this laptop, is it good enough to open this?
also do i need any programs to open it?
please help :)"
,kaise123,2011-09-25T05:54Z,"@RolandRedJack; thanks for the good feedback =).
My installer for 1.7.3 (1.5.1) had another version you could install, with the aether, but it causes lots of problems. I may install it again when i do my finished 1.8.1 torrent, but now i might just wait for 1.9 since it will be out soon.

@oorenotsoo; I will definitely re-add the Zan's minimap mod, as i had it in my 1.7.3 torrent, but it was not out when I made this torrent.

@Amelia1987; i have no idea what is wrong with yours; have you tried it on a different PC?, did it auto-update when you ran it? because doing that removes all mods.

@TheGhost001; I'll put one up in a min!

@Ibrahim001; Already has X-Ray. You just need to enabe it in the config. Either add me on skype or e-mail me and i will help.

@georgemills12; Yes that laptop should play it beautiifully, and you need to install java to play it, it is free from their website.

@SRRLSY; Are you ttring to ask a question or are you just showing everyone your specs?
"
,RolandRedJack,2011-09-26T09:05Z,"great news to hear! I read that 1.9 is going to have villages and npcs so im assuming Notch is including the millinare mod! That's cool. I vote for optimine and optifog to make it render better/faster, the HD patcher works great. All the other mods are great too so far. What's X ray? This is the first I've heard of it in the comment's thread here. Id almost say make 3 versions of your installer when 1.9 comes out if its possible. 1 is basically the current modded minecraft, 2 is minecraft w/ ather and maybe 3 would be a aether and nether minecraft only with extra /souped up mobs to fight in a heven vs hell kinda thing. ANyways can't wait for the next upload good show so far"
,Philonetic,2011-09-26T18:20Z,"Love this package, doesn't get much better.  
Anyone have a nice non-hamachi server IP?  pve, pvp, w/e, would be nice to have a place to play cracked version.  can email me at dietrichgamer@hotmail.com"
,Nicky.g.5864,2011-09-28T01:07Z,i found trojans.. ITS A TRAP
,RolandRedJack,2011-09-28T01:53Z,There are no trojans. You're an idiot. If your using Mcaffee or Norton or Avira its going to whine about trojans becuase it feels like it. Been using this since his last 2 releases and theres been no malware found.
,RolandRedJack,2011-09-28T03:26Z,http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=100267 is this included in the mod somewhere? or any chance of including it.
,kaise123,2011-09-28T15:32Z,"@RolandRedJack; X-Ray is a cheat that lets you only see the valuable blocks through others...
Also I'm not sure if i will put the Aether back into this version, as it causes many bugs... Maybe on its own...
Notch is not 'including' MillĂÂŠnaire but there are going to be NPC's in the existing towns (the random villages in 1.8)
In the current pre-release (available here: assets.minecraft.net/1_9-pre/minecraft.jar) They are implemented but do nothing.

@Nicky.g.5864; Shut the fuck up you noob prick (In other words this guy is trying to make you think there is a trojan when there isn't)

@RolandRedJack; :), and SP Commands may get merged, I heard it really good.

,Darkinferno3,2011-09-29T05:32Z,I'd like to add a mod to this... but it dosen't work... i figured it could be that inside the Altloader.jar has a Meta-inf in it... if this is not why the mods wont work... how do you put them in? a specific way?
,kaise123,2011-09-29T10:59Z,"@Darkinferno3; You put the mods into .minecraft\bin\minecraft.kar Unless the mod instructions say otherwise.

The meta-inf in the alt.loader jas nothing to do with it and is necessary for the operation of the alt loader"
