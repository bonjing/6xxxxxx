This Minecraft installer was compiled by kaise123 (Kai)
I take no credit for the loader, which was created by Anjocaido
And Minecraft itself, created by Mojang.
I merely added all the mods and the 'cracked' loader and made a convenient easy-to-use installer that gives you options =)

The mods are owned by their respective creators and I take no credit for their creation. To see the source code on open source projects Google the names of the mods (listed below) 

This is an easy-to-use, user-friendly way of putting minecraft on your computer.

You can contact me via e-mail ~kaise123@gmail.com~ or you can add me on MSN with the same address. Or add me on Skype (kaiwaugh)

Known Bugs:
Using the launcher will often result in a Java Virtual Machine error. Try again or if it becomes intolerable use the Alternative Loader.
To use the alternative loader jar files must be associated with java.

Here is my updated Minecraft torrent for 1.8.1

Changed this version:
Version 2.1.0
For Minecraft 1.8.1
Early Vertsion - Not including most mods and options.
Changed distance for single player mining/placing from 32 blocks to 6 blocks (Vanilla Game has it set to 4)
Added another 256MB memory for the game to use
Added the HD texture pack fixer, now you can install HD textures
Re-Added the resources to the game (Sounds etc) as i realised they only download themselves with a legitemate version of the game

As nobody seemed to read the readme i will keep this small.
Also, this is not the final relese of 1.8.x from me, but a version to keep you all happy while i wait for all the mods to be updated and to make sure a 1.8.2/.3 is not going to ruing all the work it takes to get the mods to cooperate.

This version includes basic unmodded minecraft, and a version with a few basic mods. The mods are as follows;

TooManyItems
Zombe's Modpack
HD Texture pack Fixer
Modloader is included.

The 'Unlicenced Copy' text remover is not included in this version, because it causes the game to crash when loaded with the loader. I will look for a new version, in the mean time you will just have to put up with it.

The controlls for basic minecraft are in the controlls section in 'Options'. Other Controlls (For the modded version only) are below:

F = Fly On/Off
E = Fly Up
Q = Fly Down
LSHIFT = Fly/walk faster (different from 1.8's sprint feature)
F6 = NoClip while flying (SSP/CSP ONLY)
Backspace = Path tracker (See where you have walked)
Numpad + = Advance Sun Time
Numpad - = Detract Sun Time
END = Stop Time (Freeze Sun in place)
HOME = Normalize and Resume time
L = Shows where Hostile Mobs can spawn (Yellow = Night only, Red = Anytime)
O (in the inventory) = Enables/Disables TooManyItems
