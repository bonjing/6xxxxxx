Riesling, Chardonnay, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes can make magnificent wines but there are also many other excellent wine varieties that for many of us are rarely experienced. Vines for Wines will expand the wine loverâ€™s knowledge and appreciation of a great range of wines and help to explore their individual preferences for specific varieties, blends, flavours and styles.

This book is based on the highly successful Wine Grape Varieties, which is an aid to identifying grape vines. Vines for Wines, however, focuses on wines from the average consumerâ€™s point-of-view, introducing the different wine grape varieties and the wines made from them, including blends. Each variety is represented by a colour photograph of the grape variety, its current world plantings, wine produced and notes describing the varietal characters for each wine grape variety.

The tasting terms and wine notes for each variety provide a benchmark for the consumer to assess the quality of wines they drink, and to allow them to share and compare their experiences confidently with other wine lovers.
