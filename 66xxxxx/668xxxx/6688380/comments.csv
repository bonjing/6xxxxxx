,Honken101,2011-09-20T10:46Z,Seriously? A 720p that is only 191 Mb? All are fakes or broken...
,wilhil,2011-09-20T11:37Z,"I don't understand the size - I already have the standard version and watched the first few minutes of this one... Compared to the standard one, the video is brilliant, but, the audio really sucks."
,MrArboc,2011-09-20T18:28Z,Doesn't anyone have a version where the audio is in sync?
,SuperUnleashed,2011-09-20T20:00Z,"For those of you having problems with Audio sync. Open the file with VLC media player, and then go to 
Tools -> Track Synchronization -> Advance of audio over video. change the value of it to MINUS - 0.300s and then you will have audio and video in sync."

Video: 10
Show: 10

Audio is slightly bad, but video and show are just amazing. As for the Ashton, what more to say than that one stoner has been replaced with another :-). He's gonna fit very well with the rest of the crew."
