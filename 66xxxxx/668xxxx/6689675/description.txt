Product Description
- Written by an international group of experts in the field. The book provides a survey of the literature, emphasising
the most useful techniques and reagents.
- In each chapter, step-by-step protocols, essential background
information and key citations in the literature are included
- Topical and less well-known techniques are covered
in a comprehensive but accessible manner for both experts and new comers to the field.

This book has been
designed to appeal to both chemists working in, and new to, the area of polymer synthesis. It contains detailed
instructions for the preparation of a wide-range of polymers by a wide variety of different techniques, and describes
how this synthetic methodology can be applied to the development of new materials. It includes details of
well-established techniques,e.g. chain-growth or step-growth processes together with more up-to-date examples using
methods such as atom-transfer radical polymerisation. Less-well known procedures are also included, e.g. electrochemical
synthesis of conducting polymers and the preparation of liquid crystalline elastomers with highly ordered structures.
Other topics covered include general polymerisation methodology, controlled/'living' polymerisation methods, the
formation of cyclic oligomers during step-growth polymerisation, the synthesis of conducting polymers based on
heterocyclic compounds, dendrimers, the preparation of imprinted polymers
and liquid crystalline polymers. The main
bulk of the text is preceded by an introductory chapter detailing some of the techniques available to the scientist for
the characterisation of polymers, both in terms of their chemical composition and in terms of their properties as
materials. The book is intended not only for the specialist in polymer chemistry, but also for the organic chemist with
little experience who requires a practical introduction to the field.
