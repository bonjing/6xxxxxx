 This is the story of wronged and misunderstood
 Arvasu,a brahman by caste, who has become a   
 performing actor. He loves Nittilai,who       
 reciprocates his love, but seeks approval of  
 her father and her village's elders before    
 marrying him. Arvasu's brother is Parvasu who 
 has been conducting a major prayer ceremony to
 appease Devraj Indra so that their region may 
 get rain. Arvasu's father is Raibhya,who      
 dislikes both his sons, and wishes that he    
 cremate them before his death. Raibhyu,       
 suspects Vishaka Parvasu's wife, of having an 
 illicit affair with Yarvaki,and detests her.  
 Yavarki loves Vishaka, but left her to worship
 and pray to Devraj Indra for 10 years, and on 
 his return found her married to Parvasu.
