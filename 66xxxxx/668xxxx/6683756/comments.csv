,Karsz,2011-09-18T13:36Z,Nothing wrong with the quality. But this fucking movie sucks. Not worth the considerable ammount of time it takes you to download.

,zorenzo,2011-09-19T04:20Z,the trailer sucks
,Lewrid,2011-09-19T10:19Z,"I watched 20 minutes of this so called movie and then I had to shut it off.

The acting is beyond bad, the effects are... okay but nothing special. The script and the editing is really just BLEH."
,NatroXz,2011-09-19T17:22Z,Really bad movie !!!

Oh, so it's a porno. Cool."
,fightthenwofuckers,2011-09-19T23:11Z,THE CUNT THAT WROTE THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE HIS WRITING HAND CRUSHED AND THEN SEWN UP DEEP INTO HIS ARSE. HE SHOULD HANG HIMSELF WITH HIS OTHER HAND RIGHT AFTER ENTERING INTO A RACE AT THE PARAOLYMPICS WHEELCHAIR RACE WITH THE OTHER RETARDS!
,mrsalmon,2011-09-20T01:32Z,Anyone know when the unrated version with all the nudity is coming out?
,LukeScooto,2011-09-20T02:26Z,"I think the fact it was made in the UK says it all. I cant even think of one seriously good movie to come out of the UK, EVER."
,chicken69,2011-09-20T04:54Z,"Just to let you all know that the Fucking movie is Fucking free, stop complaining and be greatful for what you have. Thanks TvTeam for putting it on here for us to download and watch. Good work keep it up, I'm happy with it....."

,goodone1959,2011-09-20T14:05Z,"Agreed...not very good by anyone's standards

,04jberry,2011-09-20T19:50Z,Dont Bother downloading this cucking excuse for a movie it will proberbly be on one of those channels that show nothing but shit films tommorrow but tnx for uploading this movie should be banned.
,timmerv,2011-09-21T03:02Z,Wow. You don't usually see an IMDB rating below 4!
,cryskonig,2011-09-21T22:43Z,I was going to shut it off after a few minutes......but I had my robot do it for me
[V],matimike,2011-09-22T03:03Z,"for what its worth

Avoid like the plague. Snails would've acted better.

Thanks for the effort though, appreciated."
,DTM4888,2011-09-22T18:47Z,"The worst film ever made is The River of Darkness, this movie is also hideous a truly shocking effort. "
,LarryInColumbus,2011-09-23T04:20Z,"The movie wasn't really that bad.  It just looks like something made as a high school film project.

A:10
V:10
M:ZZZzzz..."
,SeanCasey1014,2011-09-24T01:43Z,"@lysergic.acid I think he was saying the movies produced in the uk are shit. There are tons of brilliant british film makers of course but the truth is the best produced movies are made in Southern California like 99% of the movies you listed. We get your movies and bbc america and truth is most, not all, of your shows and movies have shitty lighting, editing, fx and overall production value."
,y3n007,2011-09-24T04:10Z,"I am amazed that this piece of crap actually got a rating on the imdb page, a whole 3.4 but i am skipping this one....."
,rp4826,2011-09-24T09:54Z,"The interest in downloading this was like watching a bad car crash, tough to resist. Free movie after all. Can't be that bad... or so I thought. I WANT THE LAST HOUR OF MY LIFE BACK! TVTeam, I appreciate your work, but maybe next time you should skip uploading a movie this bad. "
,illwrath,2011-09-24T20:36Z,"Lysergic, almost half that list are US productions. Brazil, which is one of my favorites along with Time Bandits, were directed by Terry Gilliam, who's American. 

Not that I think British cinema is anything but top-notch, I just think you had a correction or 2 coming.

How in the hell did you put The Big Lebowski on your list? That's ludicrous."
,never2ool,2011-09-25T06:01Z,Brits are tits!! I know I am one. A/V??
,BiNx44,2011-09-25T06:16Z,why is this movie still in the top 100s
,magooze760,2011-09-27T09:56Z,"American or British made, the movie is still a piece of shit. Lysergic.acid, alot of those movies you did list were just hyped up pieces of shit as well. But half of that credit goes to America for its envolvment."
,magooze760,2011-09-27T09:58Z,Doesn't matter where you live a shitty movie is a shitty movie.
,otksRED,2011-09-28T06:21Z,"funny how people talk shit about american movies. when just about all of the good movies come out of america, with the exception of a few british movies. even fucking harry potter is american made, filmed in gb. "
,walsh9239,2011-11-08T06:37Z,all good thanks works great
