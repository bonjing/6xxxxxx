From the reviews: â€œIn Gamma-Ray Bursts: The Brightest Explosions in the Universe, French gamma-ray astronomers Gilbert Vedrenne and Jean-Luc Atteia have summarized both the observational history and the theoretical understanding of GRBs through 2007. â€¦ Throughout the book, each chapter is packed with references to the original papers â€¦ . This book will be appreciated by graduate students and practicing scientists â€¦ . an important and valuable book for any researcher in the GRB field or in related fields that can be illuminated by GRB results.â€ (Lynn Cominsky, Physics Today, March, 2010)
Product Description
Since their discovery was first announced in 1973, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been among the most fascination objects in the universe. While the initial mystery has gone, the fascination continues, sustained by the close connection linking GRBs with some of the most fundamental topics in modern astrophysics and cosmology. Both authors have been active in GRB observations for over two decades and have produced an outstanding account on both the history and the perspectives of GRB research.
