,pops87pl,2011-09-17T22:41Z,"On August 7, 2011, it was announced that Ministry was reforming and would play at Germany's Wacken Open Air festival, set to take place August 2-4, 2012.[1] The reunion lineup features Al Jourgensen on vocals, Mike Scaccia and Tommy Victor both on guitar, Aaron Rossi on drums, John Bechdel on keyboards and Tony Campos on bass.[2]

Jourgensen told Metal Hammer in August 2011 that Ministry has been working on a new album called Relapse, which they hope to release by Christmas. Regarding the sound of the new material, he explained, ""We've only got five songs to go. I've been listening to it the last couple of weeks and I wasn't really in the mood, I was just taking it as a joke. Just to pass the time at first but [Mikey's] raving about it. It's like, dude c'mon, this is not about Bush, soâ€¦ that parts over. The ulcers are gone and Bush is gone so it's time for something new. I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I've ever done. Just because we did it as anti-therapy therapy against the country music we would just take days off and thrash faster than I've done in a long time, faster than Mikey's done in a long time. He just did a Rigor Mortis tour and said it was easy compared to this Ministry stuff so it's gonna be brutal and it's gonna freak a lot of people out."""

,PublicSecrecy,2011-09-23T20:11Z,"Do you know of any individual albums on TPB? When I search ""Ministry"", I just get flooded with Ministry of Sound results. "
,pops87pl,2011-09-27T02:04Z,psalm 69 and the last sucker can be found on torrents but the rest... I dont think so...
,jerrywexler,2012-01-10T11:27Z,"@PublicSecrecy: if you type a minus sign ( - ) before a word it excludes it from the search. Also, if you use * it works as a wildcard...

For example: Ministry -sound disc*

will pull up all the Ministry Discographies, without any Ministry Of Sound entries pulling up."
