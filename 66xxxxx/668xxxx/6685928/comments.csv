You have uploaded these songs in almost 10 torrents with small variations. I personally am interested in one song; ""video games"". After downloading this track from 3 of your uploads I find (just before and after the 2 minute mark)  you have recorded other shit in the background (which is possible if audio is stripped from the music video clip - I haven't bothered with watching that). I suggest if you are going to create multiple torrents of what is essentially a small amount of data take the time to listen to it first. Frickin' numbnuts!!"
