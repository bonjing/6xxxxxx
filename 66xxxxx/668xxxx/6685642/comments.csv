[T],aularon,2011-09-19T20:21Z,"@thetorrentlord:
Most other releases record the broadcast itself, compress/encode it with their custom settings, mainstream results are ~1.6GB/Hour for 720p.

On the other hand, I, among few others, use the stream provided by the online catch-up service, which provides a pre-encoded h264 stream, which, as I see, is fine tuned, and produces a really good quality compared to it's size, as you can tell by looking at the screenshots. The stream is ~1.1GB/Hour at 720p.
You can try downloading two releases of a program (maybe pick either some 1/2 hour 720p or 468p program so you don't waste much bandwidth for comparison's sake), one by me and one from the other people 1.5x larger releases, and compare the quality, and probably give an advice for others here and in a dedicated topic in the forums.
