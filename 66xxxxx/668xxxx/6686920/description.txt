Seventh Tree is the fourth studio album by English electronic duo Goldfrapp, released in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2008 by Mute Records and the day after in the United States.

Goldfrapp described the album as a "sensual counterpoint to the glitterball glamour of Supernature", their previous studio album from 2005.[ They claimed that the inspiration came from paganism and surreal English children's books.The album received rave reviews and became the band's most critically acclaimed album since their 2000 debut Felt Mountain, with critics praising their new sound and the band's bravery for abandoning the dance atmosphere of the previous two albums.

The album's first single, "A&E", was released on 11 February 2008, charting inside the top ten in the UK.The album also charted high in the UK, peaking at number two, despite having leaked onto file-sharing websites in November 2007, three months before its official release.
