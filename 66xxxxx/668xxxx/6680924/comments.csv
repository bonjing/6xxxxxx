I don't know anything about your problem "
,DudeType,2011-10-01T13:18Z,"Just speaking for myself, my anti-virus found and deleted multiple threats in the 'data' folder, rendering the entire download useless.
ho-hum...."
,c71ck,2011-10-02T08:44Z,"Thanks, worked great, been looking for this for a while. just a heads up to any future DLers, when you finish downloading it, go into the game data file, and run the setup from there... took 15 mins to install, and was up and running... thank you xap4oru"
,masterofstealth,2011-10-05T00:39Z,"this thing keeps crashing like shit. if ny 1 has ny advice on how 2 get this working, i'd be grateful."

,FireFlaminDean,2011-10-09T23:59Z,"I installed via the setup.exe in the game date folder, and everything went according to plan, but at the end of the setup, it said could not find ""data.exe"", so i changed the data.arc to data.exe. Tried it again, and it worked, then said that the data.exe would not work on a 64 bit comp. So i tried to run the game just incase, and it said it could not find the file, C:>Program files 86>Lucas arts>Battlefront2>gamedata>BattlefrontII.exe. So i put the game data in there, and tried a few things but nothing worked, any help?? thanks Dean"
,FireFlaminDean,2011-10-10T00:17Z,It seems to tell me that there is compatibility issues with the system 64 bit. How can i fix this?
,xap4oru,2011-10-10T21:22Z,"i have windows 7 x64 and it works well...

Have you got on your computer an antivirus? Maybe it blocks or delete some setup files."
,aeromessor,2011-10-13T16:34Z,"Is there a way to put this game in Window mode?  I've tried the typical -w and -window, and even /win at the end of the shortcut, and it doesn't run the game in windowed mode.  I also tried the version picker program and a few other things, but there are compatibility issues with the ultimate pack."
,SirRudolph,2011-10-16T18:30Z,"This torrent should be applauded. Nothing wrong, and an excellent pack, for an excellent game. +Q

Ran it in windows 7 x64 sp1 too :P"
,Obsidian501,2011-10-19T08:55Z,"How do you apply the official 1.1 update? mine says it is still 1.0, the unofficial patch worked but there are some naming bugs and such"
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-23T09:57Z,"Well, whomever crafted this sucker together did an excellent job, the launcher is very nice! ""Impressive... most impressive"". Note however that on my Asus 1005HAB, the install takes over 25 mins.

If you kids are having trouble, why not do the common sense thing and grab the keygen/CD hacks from the other torrents? I've done that many times and it's solved issues, all you need is to earmark the subdir where it is. Later, genius's..."
,AntonioCartman,2011-10-26T09:11Z,"damn, this pack is so awesome, it installed with a single click, my kaspersky dind't found a single virus shit.

the only problem - couldn't play online, tried some generated keys, but they didn't worked :(

anyway, thanks xap4oru, may the force be with you"

,_ConFox_,2012-01-11T21:59Z,"Guys, i'm having to play with no sound. Otherwise, the game crashes when i try to load any map. HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELPPP!!! "
,Shadowcat0909,2012-01-15T21:52Z,"It appears to install fine, but the Mods don't work. I have tried removing all the mods, and reinstalling them, but it is still just the default game. Note: It does say the version is 1.1 in the game menu. Please HELP!"
,Dovahkin,2012-02-01T06:22Z,"okay 2 questions, that require answers. first, i run all the mods on the game but when i try to start an instant action map with any of the mod maps it wont event let me select the mod map from the select list ,but, oddly enough, it knows that i am using the mods because it brings up all the extra mod eras, in the era select list. second, how do i play online? whenever i try i get a message that says ""your cd key is not permitted to d this action"" i already generated a key and inserted it but n change, is this a bad cd key generator? or something else? please post asap
and seed for life!"
,Valu123,2012-02-01T10:02Z,"Dear uploader: I managed to download and run the game without a problem, and everything works fine except for the fact that I can't seem to get the mods working. When I activate the mods in the launcher, there is a pause, then command prompt flashes very quickly, I think signifying that the mod was successfully activated. However when I play the game, nothing seems to have changed at all, no new maps, campaigns or units. If you or any other person could please explain how to get this feature working, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."
,nateq25,2012-02-06T04:45Z,Works perfectly. Thanks for the upload.
,NahmanJayden127,2012-02-07T09:41Z,"The launcher is great but I have one problem with it data.exe won't work on my 64 bit windows, so can someone tell me how to fix this or Xap can you please upload the uncompressed data? Thanks
-Nahman"
,xXBadAssDeagleXx,2012-04-04T10:51Z,is it possible to disable the mods?
,jlease515,2012-05-14T12:34Z,"This would be so perfect, if i could figure out how to activate the mods. They never work! Can you tell me how to activate them? "
,unownym,2012-05-24T12:34Z,"Still downloading..
hope this works"
,Energuzir,2012-05-26T02:00Z,Okay I'm having the same problem as some other people; the mods aren't working. I've tried deactivating and reactivating them altogether and the game is still in the vanilla. Can somebody explain what went wrong?
,ihazlulz,2012-06-03T05:43Z,how exactly would i install other mods and maps on this?
