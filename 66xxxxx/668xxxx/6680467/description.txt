This torrent file includes the following:

1.) Full image maps of the regions, pieced together (in paint) from the pdf's supplied here (bmp images). There are gaps and holes as they appear in the pdfs but this was done to the best of my ability.

2.) A total of nine (9) 3E/D20 conversions of the Birthright rules. Many contridict each other as they were made by fans and WotC never released an offical conversation.

3.) All 36 offically released books in pdf format inculding the Books of Magecraft, Priestcraft, Regency, and Naval Battle Rules as well as tracking maps, People of Cerilia, and full map of the Continent of Cerilia, all in bmp format.

4.) A "Player's Secrets of Mieres" in .doc format created by a fan.

5.) A document (.doc) that I made as a crappy printable list to keep up with conquered domains. Feel free to disregard this as at the time, I had no skills.
