I have the Band of Brothers Special Edition Collectors Box Set, so I ripped each disc into MP4/H264 format for ipods and ipads. This is PART THREE, with the other parts to follow. I believe the last part is a special behind the scense thing that only came with the box set, so be sure to get that if you like this movie, the best WWII movie of all time. Enjoy! PS- if i got any parts in the wrong order, or anythings wrong, please let me know.
