,Setrah,2011-09-20T06:29Z,How come it's only 700 MB? Always used to be 1.09 GB for the HDTV 40-minute episodes.
,afkuser,2011-09-20T14:43Z,"Overall, I would expect this one to be more jumpy or have more motion issues in fast scenes.

Here's the difference between this one and a previous season that is ~1GB:

Season 3:
File size : 1.09 GiB
Duration : 42mn 28s
Overall bit rate : 3683 Kbps
Bit rate   : 3297 Kbps
Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.149
Stream size : 980 MiB (88%)

This one:
File size : 702 MiB
Duration : 41mn 58s
Overall bit rate : 2338 Kbps
Format settings, ReFrames : 5 frames
Bit rate : 1907 Kbps
Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.086
Stream size : 573 MiB (82%)"
,jhansonTPB,2011-09-21T07:20Z,Can someone please upload a proper 1GB version?
,amerelium,2011-09-22T15:38Z,"This rip is pretty poor - active sound normalization has been used, so the sound level is all over the place. Picture is also pretty choppy. I'm missing the 1 gb rips of the previous seasons..."
,shad51,2011-09-22T16:47Z,"agreed noticable loss in picture quality over previous seasons, anyone know if they are all gonna be like this from now on?"
