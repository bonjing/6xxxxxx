Nicely different offering from Neil and wife who obviously had quite a good time making this. To quote AMG: ""The polite messiness of Pajama Club winds up as a greater testament to his songwriting skills than the last Crowded House album; as the clichĂŠ goes, his throwaways are better than many artistâs keepers."""
