Whilst on their way to a planet, the TARDIS crew are yanked off course and dropped off in an ordinary â€“ albeit deserted â€“ hotel instead. But this hotel isnâ€™t as ordinary or as empty as it first appears... Thereâ€™s a room packed with party balloons. In another, a gorilla uses the en suite bathroom. There are clowns. And Weeping Angels. All manner of nightmares stalk the corridors, including a ferocious Minotaur-like monster. And it isnâ€™t even a hotel. Itâ€™s just been made to look like one. But who would mock-up an Earth hotel?
