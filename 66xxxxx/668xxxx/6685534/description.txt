Cryptozookeeper a graphical text adventure for Windows, Mac and Linux. Created by XYZZY-award winning author Robb Sherwin, it merges interactive fiction-style puzzles and narrative with cryptid creation and fighting. It features over 60 cryptids to make, 200 characters to encounter and a soundtrack of over 70 songs. A character-driven piece that is a blend of sci-fi and comedy, it is one of the best advances in graphical interactive fiction in years, and a fine successor to the Infocom and Magnetic Scrolls tradition.
