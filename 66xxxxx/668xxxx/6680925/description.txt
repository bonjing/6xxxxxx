new RES patch update !
Patch updated for v6.8.6.0 cause there was a error which caused settings not to be saved!
However i never got this problem for my personal experience.
Therefore this new patch is only for those who still get a problem to patch their soft in certain cases or conditions so.
This new patch should definitively fix your problem then.      
sorry for the inconvenient.
Note :
On Vista and Win7,patch must be use as administrator.
 

Enjoy and sorry again

cheers
