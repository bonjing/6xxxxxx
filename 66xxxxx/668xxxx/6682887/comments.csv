,CaptainJacSparrow,2011-09-17T19:29Z,"Sample looks good, thanks......."
,Evilution,2011-09-18T00:37Z,"sample looks nice, much better than the http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6682656/Kung_Fu_Panda_2_2011_R6_LiNE_720P_HDRip_-_MEM upload."
,starvg95,2011-09-18T13:43Z,"Sampe looks good, but looks like the speed has been a bit reduced or it might just be due to  different sscenes threaded together, would recommend downloading. V-8.5 A-9"
,starvg95,2011-09-18T13:47Z,Quality is good but size is too big- a 4.36GiB movie!!!
,beliha,2011-09-19T20:36Z,"To the dude complaining about the size being too big: 4.3 gig is not too big! 
This is the least size required for an HD movie!
As a matter of fact, I'm waiting for the 8 GIG version.
If you don't like it, go download a DVD or CAM rip, that's more your speed."
,Endless-,2011-09-19T20:52Z,I agree with beliha. 4.GB is a minimum for HD Quality
,kingdoosh,2011-09-20T07:40Z,thanks endless your soooo helpful
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-20T16:45Z,x.x
,tryingtobebest,2011-09-21T05:35Z,"I think its not a BD rip

V - 6.5, A-9"
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-09-23T15:06Z,"Agreed. Definitely NOT Bluray source. Looks TS bad. But as a TS, good."
,begoniatw,2011-09-26T16:28Z,"quality is ok, but there's a very strange vertical  transparent line (just like water drop) near 1/3 from the left of screen."
,redalert007,2011-10-01T00:35Z,"TS quality, its not Bluray."
,dbludvl,2011-10-06T08:38Z,No 5.1 audio?
