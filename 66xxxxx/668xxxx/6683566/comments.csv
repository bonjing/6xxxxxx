Emily Browning, beautiful girl!
I remember when she played as Violet on Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, I was 12 when it came out and I thought, DAMN!
I wish I was famous so I can have HER!
Haha, well, enough of that, awesome upload, excellent quality, as usual!
Thank you for giving me Emily Browning on the GO, for my GO!"
