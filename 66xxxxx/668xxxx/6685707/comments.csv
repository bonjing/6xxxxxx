,Prosperine,2011-09-19T04:06Z,"Guessing not an update to 1.3, but it would allow us with 1.2 to play lan with each other using hamachi etc?"
,douchette,2011-09-19T10:30Z,"@Prosperine 
According to wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_island)
Dead Island is only on version 1.2.0"
,Xorakka,2011-09-19T12:03Z,"Thanks for this. Sadly, I am waiting for an for Update 4."
,brianxxx,2011-09-19T14:31Z,"Last patch was officially recalled by Sony. Check any gaming forum and there are tons of pissed people waiting for this patch mess to get sorted and for the next patch to come out. 360 is done but PC and PS are still not released. 

No doubt this game will be worth playing once the fixes are done.

So hang tight...the next official patch coming...LOL"
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-09-19T18:13Z,"I'll keep my RSS feelers out for U4, keep an eye out ;)

If you spot it, post it as a comment here and I'll put it up again with a webseed and as a direct download mirror (Oxymoron?) on my hosting site :P"
,KaramjaHead,2011-09-19T19:37Z,"My server on Hamaci is

dead island dude"
,Prosperine,2011-09-19T23:32Z,"Sorry it was a dumb question, by that I mean if it fixes the issues with playing mp etc. thanks anyways, will try hamachi again. "
,derpicide,2011-09-21T07:24Z,"Hey, i dont have update 2 yet. Can i skip to update 3 without it? If i need #2 can i has link to it?"
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-09-21T08:39Z,"Shouldn't need update 2, I just applied this to a fresh RELOADED install.

Noticed surround sound issues (Base game and with  this update), fixed by forcing stereo in the Control Panel (Dead Island? More like ""Dev Island"" >:( ) Just follow the instructions in the archive and it'll work flawlessly"
,thcfreak666,2011-09-24T01:00Z,"Thanks for Nothing.
""Steam is required !"" 
Appcrash

Fake !!"
,thcfreak666,2011-09-24T01:06Z,"Thanks for Censoring  but i say the Truth and i repeat: This is a Fake !

Steam is Required and Appcrash"
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-09-24T03:00Z,"Did you read the instructions?

Try that before calling something fake, morons."
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-09-24T03:14Z,"Ever tried reading readmes?

Extract the contents of SmartSteam141-fix.rar to your steam dir, run smartsteam.exe and then play."

I dont think it matters but im using appID: 42510"
,fadumbo,2011-09-25T11:50Z,"hipolipolopigus, remove ""steam_appid.txt"" ,than ppl wont have problems with patch ;)

P.S.-removing/uninstalling ur steam, would also remove save files

cheers"
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-09-25T20:20Z,"Not sure why you'd be having problems with the AppID, that just lets steam know the game's ID number (Which doesn't vary by patch/etc)

Going to make some perfectly and irrevocably clear intructions for future re-res that can't read an effing readme;
..Install Steam
..Install Base Game (From whichever source, I used the RELOADED release)
..Extract this archive to the base Dead Island directory (Contains ""DeadIslandGame.exe"")
..Extract ""SmartSteam141-fix.rar"" to your Steam directory
..Run ""SmartSteam.exe""
..Run ""DeadIslandGame.exe""

If you can't follow that, don't you dare call this fake. I used that method exactly."
,fadumbo,2011-09-25T22:04Z,"my ""patched game is in ""..\steamapps\common\DeadIsland"" so steam saves it under ""..\steam\userdata\app-id"" ,so changing id somehow sc**ws with save file...

if u play it from start(lvl1) ur manual works like a charm :) 
...if u played b4, ppl will have problems with it..i had..repatching without that txt, did the trick, and save was up and running with your ver of game :)

cheers"
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-09-26T09:10Z,"Ah, I see... Sorry lmao :P"
,tiboka,2011-10-10T23:35Z,Thank you!
,mattofqc,2011-12-16T03:36Z,"Never commented before because I read instructions and haven't had an issue before.  However, I'm having one now.  You're torrent worked like a charm, and after playing through to chapter 1 I was able to access the game lobby.  I came back to that today, and now the game lobby is once again grayed out.  I know that I did mistakenly ran the real Steam before I started today.  Would that be a problem, or do you know what might have happened?"
,ZainBari,2012-04-08T22:00Z,"thanks uploader and thanks fadumbo your comment worked!
BTW I had a save file that suddenly disappeared from the game before the update. But I still have 
the save file at this location :
C:/Program Files (x86)/Dead Island/out/save

but new saves don't appear here! Any ideas people?, thanks"
