,ghandi253,2011-09-17T10:23Z,"Thanks, man. +1 for the upload. The best quality one I have seen so far and the audio seems to be perfect. And I should know...my kids love Kung Fu Panda and I have sorted through countless torrents in search of one decent enough to download."
,ghandi253,2011-09-17T10:27Z,"And I think Starv is being a little too harsh. Yes, I agree. It isn't a perfect ten, but it is definitely better than 7.5. I would give it a solid 8.5. Not quite DVD quality, but damn near it. Download in peace sharers."
