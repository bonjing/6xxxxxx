,Trancemasters,2011-09-20T11:02Z,"MRsouleater27 - what planet are you on? there are at the moment I write this 434 seeds! This is the real world,and the moment you began your download,you were distributing it ""illegally"" - so don`t preach!"
,Shaka420,2011-09-20T16:32Z,"@MRsouleater27

Can't expect ghetto cheap pieces of shit, to go out and buy the album. But I agree, I think anyone who is a true fan, should go out and support J.Cole.

Great album, but there is a little confusion with the actual Track List. Some sites say ""Who Dat"" isn't supposed to be on here, and some say it is a bonus, along with Cheer Up not being on the album, but some saying it is. "
,hesone,2011-09-20T19:12Z,JCOLEEEEE THE REALEST MOTHER FUCKER ALIVE. DOWNLOADING THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW BUT I ALREADY PREORDERED A COPY TO PUT ON THE SHELF
,MODERNdayHIPPIE,2011-09-20T19:19Z,"To Everyone Saying ""Go buy the album, he needs our support""...... Man fuck that! What planet are you guys from? J.
