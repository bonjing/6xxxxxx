,micmac33,2011-09-17T01:04Z,"Thank you for sharing.
Mostly great quality, but parts of it are pixelated.
Would gladly go for a bigger file size."
,derbuzz2001,2011-09-17T18:09Z,I don't know if it is just me butttt....This sound is great all the way up to 24:25 when they are launching the travel boat. The sound skips just a second or to and they it dont come back. Instead it starts the audio all over like from the beginning of the movie. The subtitles are fine they are not effected but the audio is WAY OFF with 3 different media players.
,TheChariot,2011-09-17T18:48Z,"Same as derbuzz2001, how do we get the problem solved Yify??  "

,drhank,2011-12-04T13:35Z,"It is irritating when a file doesn't play properly using a well-regarded player, such as VLC, but I did find this movie played normally using Gom player."

At 24 min. and 24 sec. the audio gets WAY out of sync with the video. YIFY has the best torrents on TPB but don't download this one. Everybody makes mistakes :) "
