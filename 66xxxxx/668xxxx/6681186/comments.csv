this was dvd qlty, not 1080p qlty like listed. if you look below it says 1920x816 if it were 1080 it would say 1920x1080. but it works so i cant bitch too much just wish it was the real 1080p."
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-19T20:35Z,"@Bren0man - you're right...
The guy above you should have at least read the description...
Clearly says ""[RESOLUTION]:...................[ 1920x816"""
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-19T20:36Z,"Oh and good quality torrent, thanks!"
,aowie1,2011-09-25T04:07Z,"NOT 1080p, go somewhere else for real HD."
,rissawag2,2011-09-27T00:11Z,Oh stop bitching! It's FREE! Thanks for the upload man!
,Hi.Jack,2011-09-27T15:35Z,Superfast download. Thank you

The Text intrudes in to the picture and can not be removed."
[T],Francisco1206,2011-10-02T13:34Z,"for noobs:
720p must have at least 3000 kbps bitrate
1080p must have at least 6000 kbps bitrate
watching a 1080p with only 1 gb size is just fooling yourself"
,Sarmatae1,2011-10-29T07:45Z,Glitchy.
,southak,2011-11-11T10:38Z,"Bunstuffe is right, no 1080P films are 1920 x 1080 because of the black bars at the top and bottom. Commonly the resolution refers to the actual picture excluding the bars so 1920  x 816 is about right. Having said that Francisco is right also - if you are expecting Blu-Ray quality sound and vision, you are not going to get in in a 1GB file. In that case look elsewhere."
,killergilly,2011-11-14T11:29Z,"wow. now a person cant even make a simple comment without being ridiculed.
 Its obvious for people who do know, that MIKECOMPOLI video knowledge isnt 100%. Big deal. 
I wonder if these guys smack their kids around for asking to help them with their homework. Stick to arguing with your reflections in the mirror."
,killergilly,2011-11-14T11:34Z,"and I specifically meant ""bunstuffe"".

(is that what you get on the weekends??)"
,Lindsee,2011-12-08T18:34Z,"i have to say i dont think i have ever read so many gay and negative comments. like someone wrote before. its free so dig the sand out of you vag and stop bitching. if you want a PERFECT picture go buy the fucking thing. others wise be greatful there are people who go through this crap so people like us can watch it! 
thanx a lot NetExp. always happy to have a great movie to watch!"
,seedlikecrazy,2011-12-30T02:02Z,"Greatly seeded torrent! 36 seeds per peer! Hard even to get 1 of ratio. 
Keep up the good work, NetExposed! You're doing it perfectly. 
You have my hammer to support any torrent of yours. 
Cheers."
,seedlikecrazy,2011-12-30T02:12Z,"@Francisco1206

You're a faggot. This is free so shut the hell up and start thanking. 
You look like those stupid people who think size matters. ""720p must have at least 3000 kbps bitrate"" is the most stupid comment I have ever read here in TPB. If you like Xvid crap, than go and download a torrent that has 3000k Xvid on a 6GB .avi file. I don't care, is your time, brandwith and hard disk that is being wasted, not mine. You can get the same image with a 1000k h264, using only 1gb. Nuff said."
,jdbebegurl,2012-01-12T15:33Z,not good enough.. chappy!
,epimansg,2012-06-10T06:54Z,SeedLike....takes one to know one. As the kids say.
