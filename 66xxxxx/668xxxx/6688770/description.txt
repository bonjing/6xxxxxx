Jennifer [Brooke Larele] isn't happy with the way Jack is trying to control her life so she kicks him out into the sunlight. While Jack burns up, Jennifer notices that her own skin isn't reacting to the sun. When news of Jack's "spontaneous combustion" reaches the newspapers, reporter Sean Flynt [Glen Meadows] becomes interested. So does vampire Victor Chamberlain [Ty Winston]. But Jennifer is more interested in finding out why she didn't react to the sun, so she reads up on vampires in the local bookstore. She learns that she is a "pure" vampire (a mortal who was "pure" at the time of turning can become a "pure" vampire with superpowers and the ability to become mortal again if she falls in love with a mortal who also falls in love with her) and that her powers will be at their greatest during the next solar eclipse which, coincidentally, happens in four days.
