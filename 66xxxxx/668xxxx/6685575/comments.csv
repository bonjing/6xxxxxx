Finally after close 2 weeks of the movie coming out is available in a nice possible cam as usual this movie and the curiosity about this one was great enough after reading the basic storyline .

Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a 2011 American horror film written by Matthew Robbins and Guillermo del Toro and directed by comic book artist Troy Nixey. The film stars Guy Pearce, Bailee Madison, and Katie Holmes, as a man, his daughter, and his girlfriend moving into a 19th century Rhode Island mansion, where his withdrawn daughter begins to witness malevolent goblin-like creatures that emerge from a sealed ash pit in the basement of the house. It is a remake of the 1973 ABC made-for-television horror film of the same name that starred Kim Darby.

SO , for who likes nice horror films certainly ok to watch this one and a last appointment to the general good rank of this movie on the 1st 2 weeks on US movie charts .

Enjoy and happy movie to all of you . "

[V],globeplus,2011-09-19T09:16Z,"Both of the mentionated sites have milions of subtitles available to the users scanning lot of the available sites for subtitles around the net , the new movies normally takes one week or two to start having subtitles available because the needed time to make them with the exception of the original DVDs with external subtitles in types more convencional or that can be converted but the timing of this DVDs start beeing available to be bought on the stores can oscilate , what i mean is that sometimes we can get surprised with a really recent movie cam that have already the subtitle available for some language and that can happen because the DVD release have them included and someone shared them on the net , so getting subtitles for new movies it is a matter of unknown time in the shorter period possible that can be a few days or maybe a couple of weeks or more ... who knows ?... 

Happy movie to all of you and please donÂ´t forget to take a look on the suggested sites for searching subtitles ."
