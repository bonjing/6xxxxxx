* Plot :
 
A gruesome prologue set on the night of October 1910 shows the home's deranged first owner, artist and biologist Emerson Blackwood, luring his maid, Miss Winter, into the dungeon-like basement and removing teeth from the mouth of the terrified young woman. As he carries out the atrocity, he explains to the young maid that they, the goblin-like creatures, have taken his son and will only give him back in exchange for teeth. As the young woman screams, whispering can be heard all around the room from the sealed up fireplace. Blackwood makes his way over to the fireplace and offers the teeth in exchange for the return of his son, only to be told his offering wasn't acceptable and he is pulled into the fireplace. The basement is sealed and forgotten over the generations.
 
The movie then opens with a young girl, Sally Hirst (Bailee Madison), moving into Blackwood Manor, the Gothic mansion being restored by her architect father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes), an interior decorator. Her father is renovating the house they live in, in hopes of having it on the front page of a known magazine. Due to the fact that her mother recently abandoned her, Sally has become a distant child with emotional vulnerability. Although Kim tries to befriend her, Sally alienates herself from her.
 
One day, Sally hears voices calling her name and follows them â€” finding a hidden basement with a fireplace that has been bolted shut. She is drawn toward the fireplace, as she can hear voices that beg her to open it, promising friendship. One day she sneaks into the basement to open the fireplace, but her father stops her before she can get the door completely open. The creatures escape, however, and begin to torment Sally at night telling her to turn the lights out.
 
As the days progress, Kim finds several of her dresses shredded, and Alex's straight razor goes missing. Shortly afterward, a teddy bear that Kim gave to Sally is found destroyed underneath her bed after she yelled for her Dad having been scared by the creatures. Sally claims that someone (or something) else is to blame for these things, but her father does not believe her and is preoccupied with renovating the house. Kim, however, begins to believe her claims, as strange incidents occur more frequently.
