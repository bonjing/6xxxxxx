Version 2.1

At the time of this finalized version at 9/17/2011, the Archive has been downloaded 32,861 times.

This will be a 2 part update. I will add in the new pictures now, then go through with a sweep of the archive itself for 2.1 which should also be released by the end of this month/next month.

Introduction

The main reason I made this was to combat porn threads by giving those who want to fap, a whole collection of porn that would normally be on /vp/. I don\'t care how you use it, hell, post it on /vp/. But it\'s probably a better idea to just fap to yourself anyways. Please share the /rs/ link in porn threads, optionally sage and report.

&gt;&gt;&gt;/rs/Gary+Oak

                                         SHARING IS CARING!

Useful Tools

7-Zip: Better than WinRAR/zip and FREE!
Link: http://www.7-zip.org/

uTorrent: Piracy ahoy! Also, a neat tool for fast legit downloads too! I recommend the v2.X, though v3.0 works fine too.
Link: http://www.utorrent.com/

4chanX: A nifty CSS script that adds a lot of user options on 4chan such as refresh, backlinks and quick posting. It requires greasemonkey on Firefox/Nightly, and Chrome/ium users can install it right away.

Garynator: The program I used to sort most of the archive. It\'s many times faster than sorting manually and saved hours of labor. Full keyboard support, and a navigation mode for easy viewing. Still in a beta, but it\'s still quite workable. Courtesy of wat. For the Archive, it is in navigation mode by default. DDL users can find it as a DDL .7z on the /rs/ page.

You can find the program and Readme in the Garynator folder, or for torrent users, in the root folder for the archive.
