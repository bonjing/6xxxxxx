[V],scene4all,2011-09-27T03:53Z,Did you run the keygen as admin?
,Seed_Demon,2011-10-12T07:12Z,"Are you SURE this is CLEAN??? I know these often trigger false positives, but i ran this on my other machine almost a week ago, and am STILL trying to clean up the mess from a root kit, infection that damaged the boot sector and MBR, and although i recovered this, most programs are broken, in as much as i launch it, up comes a screen or so you think but it is a flash and its gone and nothing runs, and no errors, they just run the spinner for a sec,and they disappear...am hoping something i just downloaded will help with the recovery. 

BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND WHY I don't want to go through this a second tine on the presumption it is a false positive, and not another infection like this.... my head  is spinning from so many restore attempts all night every night LOL!

Thanks for any confidence you can supply. it would be appreciated, this is the one thing worse than Spammers, are virus dropping up-loaders, you know? "
[V],scene4all,2011-11-02T23:10Z,"If the keygen was packed with a rookit I'm sure Kaspersky would have flagged it, All my uplaods are scanned with Kaspersky and they are all clean, if you still don't trust me then get sandboxie and run the keygen under it. I seriously don't have time to upload fakes nor have the time to upload virus infected crap."
,lNuTTzl,2011-11-05T22:00Z,Dose not work even when u run as admin... also avg shows infected which was not the keygen showing false positive.. After i uninstalled and deleted I ran spyware/virus remover and got a few hits. I just ran this last night and the only thing I have downloaded since then was this file so it had to of came from this...
