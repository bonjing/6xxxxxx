,vikingbones,2011-09-19T19:50Z,thanks for another quality upload.
,rjamesbe,2011-09-19T20:56Z,file crashes windows explorer when trying to open or move. First time this happens with the great web uploads.
,timetoes,2011-09-19T21:44Z,Thanks for the up!
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-19T21:53Z,There are no issues with this file :)
,TwinTurbo997,2011-09-19T22:09Z,"Thanks!!!
Breaking Bad + WEB DL rip = awesome"
,CakeMonster,2011-09-19T22:28Z,"@rjamesbe 

Use splash lite player which is a free player to open the file

Splash lite player!

,baretoof,2011-09-19T22:39Z,web dl releases rock!!
,balanced,2011-09-20T01:03Z,Thank you very much for this UNRARred and good quality version it was worth the wait and I encourage everyone to boycott RAR crap to encourage this sort of thing.  NNTP-heads need to adapt or be ignored.
,pixejoule,2011-09-20T05:14Z,have i told you that you're the best?
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-20T10:51Z,"Maybe.

But it's still nice to read it :p"
,sa_nick,2011-09-20T11:25Z,"rjamesbe was right, there's something wrong with the file. I usually watch the show on my PS3, which requires putting the mkv through mkv2vob. Everytime I try the program just crashes. It's never happened before.

Plays fine on PC though."
,Pirate_P,2011-09-20T14:40Z,"Somebody give this guy a kiss so I don't have to. ;-)

Real Quality. :-)"
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-20T20:48Z,"There's nothing wrong with the file. There's something wrong with your setup.

,redfox88,2011-09-20T21:39Z,"As rjamesbe and sa_nick have said, something with this file is a little off. While it plays fine via the PC, it will not convert via MKV2VOB, which has never been an issue before."
,redfox88,2011-09-21T00:08Z,"Wanted to help those having issues with this file regarding mkv2vob. Download a program called MKVtoolnix, which you can get with a quick search of Google. Add the Breaking Bad mkv and then select the video portion under the Tracks, chapters and tags heading, then go to the area under it with the labels General track options|Format specific options|Extra options and click the Extra options tab. Then click None under the compression tab. Repeat for the audio portion and click None again for compression and then click Start muxing. After it's all done, run it through mkv2vob again and you should be all set. Hope this helps."
,farkstick,2011-09-21T01:45Z,"Or instead of all that, install the K Lite codec pack, right click the file, select the Open With option, pick Media Player Classic, and enjoy.

This works fabulously with WDTV Live, thanks as always for the upload."
,kurtly,2011-09-21T13:41Z,"there is no problem with my setup Insinuendo, however there IS a problem with YOUR FILE - file crashes Windows Explorer when trying to open or move."
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-21T20:27Z,Get bent
[H],politux,2011-09-21T20:54Z,"Thanks insinuendo for a perfect upload.  

Nothing wrong with the file at all.  Don't let the haters get you down.  :)"
,sa_nick,2011-09-22T02:51Z,"I'm not trying to get him down, I'm just trying to explain that there IS something wrong with the file. I'm not saying people shouldn't download it either, it looks and sounds great when played on PC, but something inside the packaging of the file is corrupt or missing, making it impossible to demux for playback on other devices.

insinuendo, Being an Aussie I'm grateful I can even watch this show so soon after it airs in the US, but don't go around telling people there's nothing wrong with the file when there clearly is, even if it's something that wont affect everyone watching.

""There's nothing wrong with the file. There's something wrong with your setup.""

That just makes you sound like an arrogant jerk. Multiple people have posted problems specifically with this ONE web-dl after all the rest worked. We're not saying you suck, we're just giving you some feedback so maybe next time it wont happen, that's all."
,artvandelay2007,2011-09-22T14:37Z,"I believe the people who say they have problems with converting the file for use with PS3.

I guess I'll be the first to mention that this episode wasn't done by TeddyBlue, but by someone (group) called ""BTN""

Having said that, I had no issues with playing this on a PC or converting it with Handbrake for my iPad."
,fish121,2011-09-22T19:08Z,"File works perfectly in WMP.

A/V = 10

thank you much !"
,SuperMuna,2011-09-23T01:17Z,"something is definitely wrong with this file, first time I'm experiencing crashes/errors. Thanks for the upload nonetheless."
,Tropius__B,2011-09-23T07:18Z,"Wait, you're watching it on a Sony Playstation and then whining about problems? Well, DUH. 

Get a clue, chump - how about maybe watching it on the platform you downloaded it on, then seeing if it works?

This stripe of BB is routinely higher quality than the other 720p versions I have seen for the last couple months. 

The idea that someone is bitching on The Pirate Bay about some hideously DRM-crippled proprietary system not being able to play a file is fucking ludicrous. 

Why not show some brains and use a micro-PC or mac mini for your living-room TV? If your brains are already shriveled beyond hopeless, well, just think of all the good you will do for the environment not burning a disc each time you want to watch something. LOL."
,truthy,2011-09-23T16:54Z,"having read the various comments here (and also the solution) ... to summarize:

- nothing wrong with the file (header removal compression is a mkv-container feature, unfortunately most standalone players don't support it and therefore won't play the file)
- solution: remux with mkvtoolnix/mmg (file --> options --> mmg --> check disable header removal compression for a/v tracks by default --> ok)"
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-23T21:02Z,"@ Tropius__B

Couldn't've written it better!

:lol:"
,truthy,2011-09-23T22:48Z,"ah and btw the current version of mediainfo tells you if header removal compression in an mkv is used or not: if there's the line ""Muxing Mode: Header stripping"" in any of the audio/video tracks it means that it's used and that you'll have to remux to make it standalone compatible. (or that you can use it in eg mkv2vob for ps3)"
,kurtly,2011-09-25T14:58Z,"wow alot  of angst from people... Firstly i want to say thankyou for the upload its people like insinuendo that upload for all of us to enjoy stuff we might not otherwise be able to enjoy. 

Secondly I laugh at those of you who are ignoramus. You assume that 1 there is a problem with my setup, 2 iam using a ps3 and 3 that because you dont have a problem there is nothing wrong with this file... WRONG , wrong and guess what? wrong again. There is a problem with this file PERIOD. I cant touch this file - i try to move it, copy it open with any program and it crashes windows. I am not the only one experiencing this. I cant even delete the fuckin thing. So... before you all run your mouths and tell me what I am doing wrong and what I am using is wrong, take a deep breath and think for a moment , maybe just maybe these people saying they are having issues with this file actually KNOW what they are talking about."
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-26T00:55Z,"Well, i guess I'll simply refrain posting future episodes because a few morons have issues with the files..."
,RubbingHood,2011-09-26T06:09Z,"Haters gonna hate what they can't imitate.
Keep up the work. Ep. 11 should be up soon, right?"
,quilan614,2011-09-26T13:06Z,"Cheers man work fine for me.
I love how people bitch about something free and that takes efforts from others to be made. Like my gran say If you're not happy with it, do it yourself and don't whine about."
,artvandelay2007,2011-09-26T16:34Z,"Ep.11 is up

Nothing wrong with file. Works fine on PS3, which is as good as any other standalone player when burned properly. No problems using VLC either.

,devrimCHE,2011-09-27T23:36Z,"hey man, where are you? you're not around for some time. without you, the site is lacking, you know??"
,fecklessman,2011-10-12T02:02Z,"as far as i can tell, it's only this one file that isn't working. won't play on my sony bd player off a flash drive. gonna try demuxing. annoyed that i may have to download a crappy quality version of this episode just to watch it on my t.v. [which kind of defeats the purpose of watching it on my t.v. in the first place]. no big, but i don't know that i'd say there 'isn't anything wrong with it.'"
