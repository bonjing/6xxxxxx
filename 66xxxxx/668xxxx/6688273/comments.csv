,SoundAdviceCT,2011-09-21T21:53Z,"First of all, thanx for the great ups!

Hey idjit, ""sykedd""... if you took a couple of minutes to actually check instead of instantly mouthing-off based an erroneous thinking, you'd know that these ""eztv"" torrents are RIGHT ON TIME!

The ONLY possible confusion is that there wasn't an original airing on Sept. 5th, when you might have been expecting S07E11.  Can't BELIEVE some of you folks who have the temerity to gripe about something that's FREE!"

,shawnaldo,2011-09-22T23:33Z,"sykedd, you're an idiot. The show itself took a week off, that's why there was no episode on September 5th, EZTV is right on time when the episodes get aired (as usual). Do yourself a favor and look up episode lists on wiki or imdb instead of looking like a complete moron. "
,heliosphoenix,2011-09-26T23:22Z,"hey..did anyone notice a torrent for episode 13?...coz i did and now its gone
