Colin Murray introduces highlights from one of the biggest games of the Premier League season, 
Manchester United v Chelsea at Old Trafford. Between them they have won the last seven league 
titles and it was United's 2-1 win in this fixture last season that all but clinched the championship 
for Sir Alex Ferguson's side. Plus highlights from Tottenham v Liverpool, Sunderland v Stoke and 
Manchester City's match at Fulham, with City looking for a repeat of last season's emphatic 4-1 win.
