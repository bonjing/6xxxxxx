,BMcM2000,2011-09-17T20:17Z,"Thank You Very Much Man!!!  I'm Out of work right now and cant afford ""The Extras"".  I really wanted this badly.   Looking forward to the Extra Discs as well..  "
[V],DownTYU,2011-09-17T21:04Z,"Its the full retail bluray not a compressed rip.
Plus it has extra audios commentary, menus...and stuff."
,chawumba,2011-09-18T01:57Z,"The file listing doesn't have Revenge of the Sith, but I'm guessing it's one of the two listings of New Hope (the others only have one listing).  Does anyone know if it is, and if so, which one?"
[V],DownTYU,2011-09-18T08:06Z,"The 43.3 Gb new hope is revenge of the sith.
He he...sorry these things happen sometimes."
,chawumba,2011-09-18T23:47Z,"No problem, thanks for the clarification."
,jtalas,2011-09-19T01:15Z,Please seed. It says it would take 2 years... :(

,Burkey0307,2011-09-27T16:39Z,"Episode I doesn't play in English for me, but it says theres English audio in the description. Is there a way to swap the audio?"
,Darthmullet,2011-10-02T05:37Z,"All of the movies play in another language; I've tried to change the player's language setting, but it doesn't change anything. How do I get it to play in English?"
,envisaged0ne,2011-10-04T16:22Z,"To play the movies properly, where you can get the menus, change the audio/subtitles, etc...
What I did was create an iso for each movie.  Then mount the iso using daemon tools.  Then use a media player that can play bd (I use Corel WinDVD).  From there, it'll play the movies exactly like playing them on a blu ray player"
,Darthmullet,2011-10-05T05:10Z,"I had tried that and it didn't work, guess it was the video software I tried to play it with because Corel works fine, thanks a ton man."
,swfanman,2011-10-05T05:24Z,"this may be asking a lot but, can someone hardcode the alien dialogue subs into the picture with both commentary tracks? Smaller size as well perhaps? If someone already has done, point us in the direction."
,thegr8luiz,2011-10-15T01:52Z,Thank you very much for your time and effort to share this with us.

,rakapung,2011-10-23T16:23Z,I'm having problems with playing the movies.. My first time downloading Blu-ray. Which file am I suppose to mount??
,cacalo,2011-10-27T03:42Z,"Coming down at 0.6 kb/s

 Seeeeeeeeeedddd!!!!!!!"
,thegr8luiz,2011-10-27T12:31Z,This is one of the best uploads ever but it has awful download speeds. Why is it so? It is only five weeks old.
,envisaged0ne,2011-11-01T12:17Z,natebigboygunn - I used UltraISO
,thegr8luiz,2011-11-17T12:12Z,"456 hours downloading this and I finally have it all. My connection is fast enough to do it in about 40 hours, but for some reason no one seems to be sharing this at high speeds, specially those who already have the whole thing. ThatÂ´s too bad.

Video and sound are superb! The files play flawlessly with PowerDVD 11, but first you make each of the six folder names smaller. That's all you have to do."
,Kenfolk,2012-02-12T02:21Z,"Alright so I just finished d/l'ing this. What exactly am I converting to .iso? I used alcohol120 to convert the entire Phantom Menace folder to a .iso using alcohol120 and tried playing it on corel and powerdvd and it wouldn't play on either, said it was an unsupported format. So I then went and turned just the BDMV folder into an .iso format but I got the same results. So what am I doing wrong?"
,dragondagoth,2012-05-02T16:33Z,"First off awesome download, nothing short of expected, and everything you can expect from blu rays.  Since this is the first time I downloaded a real blu rays from here I figured best to look at how others were attempting to watch them, and tried their solutions by mounting ISO's to no avail.  I used an alternate method and this works for me.   Using DvdFab (I have version 8) go to the option that says ""Blu Ray Ripper"" here you will see an assortment of options, I chose ""MT2S"" copy and paste/ drag the/  your Star Wars Blu Ray folder to the designated area.  Once you have done this step you will see an assortment of files to select with ripping, since the only language I am familiar with is English I leave the settings as is; moreover I am not interested in hearing George Lucas voice overs so I have not selected anything to hear it, and I am presently unaware of which of the files will grant users this ability, I just keep it simple. From this point select the folder you want the rip of your Blu Ray to go to eg. your desktop, documents etc.  After this is complete I have tried to watch these movies without tinkering around to figure out what settings will get it to work on the following:  DivX Plus Player, this seems to crash on me. Windows Media Player, does not work for me.  Cyberlink Powerdvd 10 seems to work, and so does VLC Media which seems to have a much better visual aspect for watching these films.  I hope this helps."
,Arsik36,2012-06-01T15:57Z,Seed please!!!! i have 1.1GB left from such a huge amount. I can't wait to download and watch it :)

,IndigoAK,2012-06-03T14:25Z,Are episode III and IV simply mislabeled or is there two copies of the same film in here?  250GB is a lot to download if there's an error in this release.
,chilldog123,2012-06-09T01:15Z,"I've never d'led a full blu-ray rip, so I am new to all this. Can someone please explain to me what I am supposed to with all these video files and stuff? THANKS for the upload btw."
