Nikki Jean

This monthâ€™s installment of the Webby and MTV O Music award-winning Internet series, which last year made its broadcast debut on WGN America to impressive ratings, finds Nikki Jean joining forces with Daryl Hall for a set that includes five songs from her debut, including â€œSteel and Feathers,â€ an unfinished Dylan song from the â€œShot of Loveâ€ era that she finished with his blessings. The two also perform â€œHow to Unring a Bell,â€ by Philly International great Thomas Bell, â€œMy Loveâ€ co-penned by legendary Motown tunesmith Lamont Dozier, â€œPatty Crash,â€ a collaboration with Paul Williams, and a Carly Simon co-write, â€œSex Lies and Sunshine.â€ The duo also tackles â€œMy Mistake Was to Love You,â€ the 1973 duet featuring Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye, and the 1983 Daryl Hall & John Oates Top 10 smash, â€œOne on One.â€

Says Daryl Hall: â€œShe is a real ball of energy, and I canâ€™t believe she wrote such great songs with all of those amazing writers! Itâ€™s quite an accomplishment for an artist at any point in his or her career.â€

Coming off appearances on Late Night with David Letterman, WNYC's Soundcheck and NPR's Weekend Edition, Nikki Jean debut has received glowing notices in the Wall Street Journal, and People. The N.Y. Daily News said, admiringly, "You'll have trouble suppressing a smile."
