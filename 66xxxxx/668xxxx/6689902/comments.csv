Probably the best R5 of the movie so far.
Definetely recommended!

Yes, this is better than the other R5 LINES realeased at present as the audio hiss/crackle has been cleaned up well, very well in fact... 
HOWEVER: i have had some major playback issues with this mp4 file version. 
Playback often lost audio for about 20-30seconds if you paused playback then resumed, or the same if you skipped forward or backward (as if it was ""trying to catch-up"" with itself and resync, and this sort of effect happened with every media player i tried using (Media Player Classic, VLC Player etc etc) and i have never ever experienced anything like this with a collection of over 1650 avi, mp4, mkv, m4v, etc video files. 
My PC is a 2.80Ghz Quad-core with 4GB DDR3 memory and GeForce 512mb graphics card, K-Lite codec pack installed and i know enough to say it's not because of a newbie issue etc. 
Nero Vision created an awful DVD from this - audio went right out of sync.
Just curious to see if anyone else experienced this...
I found that it played perfectly from start to finish if it wasn't touched (paused, resumed, skip forward/backward etc) 

Credit to .BONE. regardless - you are one of my fave uploaders and respect is due to you."

Re-downloaded and it's now behaving like every other mp4 file. Guess it got slightly corrupt? 
Obviously was my fault then lol!"
