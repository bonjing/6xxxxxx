Building with straw bales is being embraced by amateurs and professionals for its versatility, comfort, environmental friendliness and high insulation. New methods should expand its growing worldwide popularity.

Practical Straw Bale Building describes the best of current practices and introduces new ideas in a practical step-by-step approach, supported by technical data and analysis. Starting from how straw bales are made, it describes the building of both in-fill and load-bearing walls, discusses the properties of materials used to plaster the walls, and details how particular features are incorporated, such as windows, doors, arches, plumbing and electrical. It especially describes new methods that enable the construction of straighter, thinner and easier-to-plaster walls. The book provides a wealth of information and ideas for immediate practical application and as a basis for further development of straw bale building methods.
