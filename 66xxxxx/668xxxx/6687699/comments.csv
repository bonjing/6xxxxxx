,brianxxx,2011-09-19T22:15Z,I love Skidrow and don't mean to be cruel...but damn have they been getting sloppy lately. Seems like they regularly have to release fixes for their stuff.
,GoatDancer,2011-09-19T22:28Z,"Oh c'mon dude don't be like that. We're all taking video games for granted. We're playing something that costs around 70-80 euros for free, so what if it takes a few tries to make it perfect? I personally am very grateful to Skidrow and all the other scenes that crack games I'd otherwise have to pay to enjoy."
,johnniebrasco,2011-09-19T23:01Z,"brianxxx: so why dont you show'em how its done? since youre obviously much better at it:) I for one am happy with the work skidrow is doing, and if you dont have the time to wait, buy the game!! Thank you skidrow!"
,tody_poo,2011-09-19T23:37Z,"@GoatDancer. Where the fuck do you buy your games?, 70-80 euros???? this game is like 50 euros on steam....."
,BigUglyMotha,2011-09-20T01:40Z,âŹ50 is for the normal version of this game but the augmented version and the collector versions (60-100âŹ) both cost more. So yeah thnx Dude !
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-20T06:38Z,Does this fix the crash issue some people seem to have during start up and/or during dialogues?
,Elhao84,2011-09-20T14:35Z,@ZtorkX86: I have tried it with 2 conversations that caused crashes before and it seems to fix the problem (for me) :)
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-20T17:10Z,Elhao84@ That's good news. :)
,ZtorkX86,2011-09-22T12:35Z,I just started playing with this crack. Works flawlessly so far. :)
,axayd,2011-09-27T08:51Z,"i dont know about stutters or anything, but it certainly works fine. only use for me really was skipping the credits at the start. thanks .dude!"
