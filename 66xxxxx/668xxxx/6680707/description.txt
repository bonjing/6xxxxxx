Pt. 2: Noam Chomsky on Libya, Israel & GOP
Presidential Candidates Utterly Outlandish Positions

In our extended interview with Noam Chomsky, he argues
that in Libya, "you could have made a case for a no-fly
zone and protection of civilians, but I think itâ€™s much
harder to make a case for direct participation in a civil
war and undercutting of possible options that were
supported by almost the entire world." Meanwhile, in the
Middle East, Chomsky notes that Turkey and Egypt have been
key allies for Israel and that the deterioration of their
relations "contributes very substantially to Israelâ€™s
isolation in the region." Back in the United States,
Chomsky says that while he is no fan of President Obama,
the position of the Republican presidential candidates on
issues such as climate change are "utterly outlandish."
Chomsky is interviewed by Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman,
along with producer Aaron MatÃ©.
