As requested, I've created a torrent with all the 'Dexter' books by author Jeff Lindsay. This is current as of 'Dexter is delicious' 

There are 6 files in this torrent they are listed below (random order):

dearly_devoted_dexter.epub
dexter_by_design.epub
darkly_dreaming_dexter.epub
dexter_is_delicious.rpub
readme.txt
dexter_in_the_dark.epub

All these epub books are retail copies, so they will work on all eReaders that support ePub docs as well as iDevices (4.3.3 and up)

I really enjoyed these books, and I am a big fan of Jeff Lindsay's writing style. If you've watched all the TV series you should still read these because, as always there is more in the books then you see in the show!

Thanks for seeding!
