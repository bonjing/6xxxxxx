Check out my other auctions, or just type in Band of Brothers in the search box, im uploading all 10 parts from my Band of Brothers collectors edition. I think the series itself is 9 parts, and the 10th part is behind the scenes and interviews with veterans. 
Im also working on getting the full WWII in HD series and ripping it and uploading it. If it wasnt for them old salty bastards we'd all be speaking German or Japanese right now. Thank you for your sacrifices...
