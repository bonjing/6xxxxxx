This is one of the most memorable film soundtracks ever, a rival for that other great example of the art `The Good, The Bad, The Ugly'. Sergio Leone's direction was a breath of fresh air, and his use of music in his films was an integral part of his style and the films successes. 

Morricone would often write the score, then Leone would film around the music, integrating it into the film in a way not really seen before. A prime example of this is the scene where a standoff is played out to the tune coming from a pocketwatch. Doing things this way added an extra depth to the film and packed a real punch. 

Despite the reliance of the film on the score, the score can be listened to in complete isolation from the film with total enjoyment. Here we have a suite of tunes that defy my attempts to describe, but are an eminently enjoyable suite of orchestrations taken directly from the film. 


Enjoy and Seed!!
