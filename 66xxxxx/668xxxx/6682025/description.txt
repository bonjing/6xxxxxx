The Best Of Go West (1993)





Guitarist Richard Drummie and vocalist Peter Cox formed the duo Go West. Backed by the likes of Austrian keyboardist/producer Peter Wolf and a cast of West Coast studio musicians, they've produced several albums of high energy dance pop. Although their 1985 debut was a polished set that produced two Top 40 singles ("We Close Our Eyes" and "Don't Look Down"), their biggest hit was "King of Wishful Thinking" from the Pretty Woman soundtrack.
