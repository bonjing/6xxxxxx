It\'s Halloween, and Disney\'s irresistible talking puppies are back in
an all-new movie that takes them far across town to a mysterious
mansion where something very spooky is going on. With the help of some
unexpected new friends, including a friendly ghost, this trick-or-treat
adventure is howling-good Buddy fun.

In a race against the Howlloween Hound, the Buddies and their new
friends, Pip, Zelda, Rodney and Skip must stop Warlock the Magician
and save the world from his dastardly deeds.
