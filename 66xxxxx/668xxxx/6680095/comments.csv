Once you start the game, it asks to enter your credentials (user name and password), and immediately after that it asks for serial. So, it is obvious, we need a crack for this one."

,RadiantB,2011-09-18T14:01Z,"guys
a key from a keygen isn't enough to play the game; it's needs a crack too, just like trackmania united needed one
so wait for an official crack, don't search for virus infested keygens of look on websites that make make money of naive people "
,asdasdqweasd,2011-09-18T22:03Z,Any groups even working on the crack?
,RadiantB,2011-09-19T11:35Z,"tbh, I bought the original Trackmania and Sunrise, but I never played online with it.
I'm not very competitive, so I'm okay with trying to beat gold or author times, which is extremely difficult anyway.
The real reason to keep playing it, is the ridiculous amount of tracks you can download and the free expansions you get. (powerup, sunrise extreme, united forever, nations forever, startrack are all free upgrades)"
,xarrro,2011-09-19T14:47Z,"All this trackmania canyon releases are like:
""Oh,ive made a post in pb of a book but have no pages"".......why posting this if this dont work and dont have what is supposed to have?? Use your brains and time for something better."
