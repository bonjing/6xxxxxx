,ryanspeck,2011-09-30T23:48Z,"Or just buy the shorts DVDs.

Economical and convenient."
,restoringcomedy,2011-10-26T01:03Z,"FYI: You do know the shorts are already synced up right?? Not preaching, just correcting. I'm all for piracy (but also donating when possible!). Party on."
,InternetJesus,2011-10-29T00:02Z,"Say, isn't it about time for part 6?"
,restoringcomedy,2011-10-29T08:48Z,I would be very appreciative to find out what makes things float. =)

So it's either pirate or not watch them at all.
