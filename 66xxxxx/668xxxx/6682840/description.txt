The Pink Floyd Story: Which One's Pink?
Celebrate the most low-key music act of all time. They began by turning pop songs into open-ended sonic experiments, pioneered spacey prog rock and were the kings of the stadium performance. The storyâ€™s told effectively by the band members themselves in documentary The Pink Floyd Story: Which Oneâ€™s Pink?, which culminates in the bandâ€™s reunion at Live 8 in 2005, but the best stuff comes earlier with footage from the archives featuring the legendary Syd Barrett.
A celebration of the band's history, featuring interviews with David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Roger Waters and Richard Wright, as well as rare archive footage. Other contributors include Bob Geldof, who reunited the band for 2005's Live 8 concert, manager Peter Jenner, producer Joe Boyd and graphic designer Storm Thorgerson.
