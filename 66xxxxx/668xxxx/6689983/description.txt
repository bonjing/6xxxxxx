Lyrics:
Cause you can dance can dance your life away
Cause you can dance can dance not think about tomorrow
Cause you can dance can dance don\\\'t be afraid
Cause to be free you need to dance away your sorrow

You got secrets that you hide underneath your smile
No one knows your feelings he\\\'s got lovers in disguise
You wrapped around his lies it\\\'s your heart that\\\'s breaking

Oh I\\\'ve been there before yes I know that it hurts
But it\\\'s time to let go
Tonight let\\\'s strip of your past
Get naked at last
And we all know 

Cause you can dance can dance your life away
Cause you can dance can dance Not think about tomorrow
Cause you can dance can dance don\\\'t be afraid
Cause to be free you need to dance away your sorrow

Stop wasting all your time crying out your eyes 
When the club is jumping I told you once before 
It\\\'s time to hit the floor cause the music\\\'s pumping 

Oh you know that I\\\'m right it feels good inside
Just to let go
Girls tonight is the night 
we\\\'re looking so fine 
Let\\\'s turn on the show

Cause you can dance can dance your life away
Cause you can dance can dance Not think about tomorrow
Cause you can dance can dance don\\\'t be afraid
Cause to be free you need to dance away your sorrow
