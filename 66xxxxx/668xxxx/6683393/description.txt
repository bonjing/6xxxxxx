The first of two albums made by the Martyns in America, circa 1970. Warner/Reprise (their American label at the time) and Island (where Martyn was a folkie fixture) thought this Scottish/Brit husband/wife team would take off in the states and set them up near Woodstock, NY, a major music hub in the days after the 1968 festival. There they forged friendships and recorded with members of The Band and their proteges. But this album and subseqent "Road to Ruin" failed to catch on, and the duo, whose edgy marriage was soon to fall apart, went home. Beverley dropped out of sight and John moved on, increasingly drawn to blues and jazz.
