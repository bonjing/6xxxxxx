  The TfL London Stage 8a sees the reintroduction of the individual     
  time trial to The Tour of Britain for the first time since 2005, and  
  for the first ever occasion in central London.                        
                                                                        
  The race of truth will see the battle for the IG Markets Gold       
  Jersey go right down to the wire, and play a crucial role in who      
  succeeds Michael Albasini, and joins the role of honour as Tour of    
  Britain winner.                                                       
                                                                        
  The Tour of Britain concludes with it's now traditional circuit       
  race, giving spectators at The TfL London Stage a number of           
  opportunities to see the riders, as they complete ten laps of the     
  iconic central London circuit.
