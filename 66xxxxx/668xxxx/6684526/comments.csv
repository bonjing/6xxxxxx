,hanzo2,2011-09-18T16:19Z,Is this with Erik Morales fight ?  
,Xanthium1,2011-09-18T16:50Z,"Thanks alot scene4all and RUDOS, looks like you posted the HBO version with undercard judging by the frame rate and the length.  Too bad for me that I already watched the british version and on top of that had the undercard results spoiled too during the commentary. I'm such an impatient retard!!!"
,JOR23,2011-09-18T18:09Z,@hanzo2...answer is yes...
,NewMex52,2011-09-18T19:10Z,"Though I predicted Mayweather was going to win this fight by decision, ko, tko, etc.  I never imagined he would win this fight the way he did.  It looks like referee Cortez is now working for Vince McMahon - cause he sure did a classic WWE maneuver, paying more attention to what's going on ringside than what's happening inside the ring.  GIVE ME A HELL YA!  cause I am AWESOME."
,MeXiCaN21PiMpIn,2011-09-18T19:45Z,look people... let your shit SEED!!!!!!!!! its not going to hurt anything if you let the file seed while your watching the video or try to download other stuff. stop being ass holes and SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,actionwilliams,2011-09-18T22:26Z,"hey NewMex52, what kind of cnt would write a comment giving the result? You, you fkn cnt. Keep your irrelevant comments and opinions to yourself.
scene4all - many thanks for the UL."
,Nergalsyn,2011-09-19T01:18Z,thanks a lot 
,thorfrias17,2011-09-19T02:23Z,Who's next Mayweather? Pacquiao? 
,Xanthium1,2011-09-19T02:39Z,"Since a comment in this list has already spoiled the results, I'm going to chime in on this situation.

Floyd mayweather is a punk, a piece of shit punk ass bitch.  I was actually a floyd fan coming into this fight but now I hate that motherfucker, he showed his true colors in this fight, this shows that he's as big of a piece of shit as we all suspected, but which all along he claimed to be an act... his ""money mayweather"" persona.  This guy is basically shit on legs, if he didn't have kids I'd hope that manny pacquiao literally kills him in the ring if that punk ever decides to step up and fight him.

Now that pacquiao has agreed to full random blood and urine testing, this mayweather cunt is claiming that only USADA can do the testing.  The only thing that this would accomplish is that manny pacquiao would then not be able to conduct the first half of his training camp in the philippines like he always does, and ritual and routine are both important to mannyâ€¦ itâ€™s the exact same test!  What a fuckin joke, he's not fooling anyone now, he's a cunt ass fake, egomaniac coward fuck.  I'm not no manny nut hugger either, all this is pure fact.  It's gone too far, if floyd doesn't agree on a 50/50 cut and random drug testing done by WADA which would allow pac to train in his own country... then he's a flat out, undeniable, 100% coward cunt bitch!  I've defended floyd for so long now but I'm done, I hate this fucker, I was wrong about him.  Everything's on the table now and it's obvious what's going on at this point.  Heâ€™s going to get what he deserves just like margarito did.  PS... the HBO announcers were way too light on him for what he did, that was fuckin garbage, rippin off the fuckin fans and making a joke out of boxing.  Thank God that I didnâ€™t waste $70 on it."
