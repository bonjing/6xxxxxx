Jimi Hendrix Experience - Winterland
4-Disc Deluxe Box Set
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
released: September 13, 2011
Experience Hendrix, Legacy, Sony Music
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winterland is drawn from six stellar shows recorded over three days (October 10,
11 and 12, 1968) at San Francisco's historic Winterland Ballroom.
These special performances celebrated the two year anniversary of the
Jimi Hendrix Experience and came just as the groundbreaking album Electric
Ladyland was released.

Winterland presents some of Hendrixâ€™s most spectacular guitar work and the four
CD set is filled with rare live versions of classic songs such as "Manic Depression,"
"Are You Experienced?," "Tax Free," and "Little Wing" that are not part of any other
Sony Legacy release. Fans will also enjoy Hendrixâ€™s dramatic interpretations of
Creamâ€™s "Sunshine Of Your Love" and Howlinâ€™ Wolfâ€™s "Killing Floor"
[with the Experience joined by Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady] as well his
rendition of Bob Dylanâ€™s "Like A Rolling Stone," which has been selected as the
lead track for this special release.

This special deluxe box set features never before released music from each of the
six unforgettable Winterland performances. The new standard and deluxe editions
of Winterland are markedly different from a single disc compilation, long out of print,
that was briefly issued by Rykodisc in 1987 and 1988.

The deluxe edition also presents a rare interview with Hendrix recorded backstage at
the Boston Garden a few weeks after the Winterland performances.
This previously unreleased bonus provides fans with a unique window into Hendrixâ€™s
views about his background, his approach to the guitar and songwriting and future
direction of his music.

The deluxe edition also features a 36 page booked filled with previously unpublished
images by acclaimed photographers Robert Knight, Allen Tannenbaum and Jim Marshall
as well as an essay by noted Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke.
