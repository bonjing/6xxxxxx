,dustin24,2011-09-19T16:34Z,"Okay I'm sorry here I am again, but I have a problem: I opened everything with 'Dirt 2' in it's name but everytime I come to the serial page, it says: Dirt 2 could not be run because the file ''data/actionmap'' is missing from the installation...

Anyone?"
,seb057794,2011-09-19T23:23Z,"@dustin24 ==>

Past Dirt2 folder in Applications
When finished replace the file with patch
If ask serial number, just click ok then play"

,hazzahex,2011-09-27T16:50Z,"I have a macbook air and i cannot seem to do anything with the toast file that i downloaded, i have got the toast program and have tried changing the extension of the file etc. what am i missing and why can i not open the file at all?"
,dustin24,2011-09-28T17:48Z,"People, read the damn explanation and installation. I've had problems too with the installation so I know what i'm talking about. Drag the whole Dirt 2 folder into the applications folder. Mount the dirt2.toast and use the cracked.zip instead of the dirt2. dmg

Succes
My apologize for my agressive way of talking"
,Ben_D.,2011-09-30T02:14Z,"Hey, torrent works beautifully, works on both snow leopard ( original 13 inch macbook alum ), as well as lion ( brand new 27 inch imac). only question i have, is where is the save file located? 

and for those having issues, heres what i did to get it to work. Open it with toast, then copy the ENTIRE folder into your applications, take out and remove the old program file, not the data one, unzip and insert the new one. and it works great"
,Petgan,2011-10-04T21:07Z,"I keep seeing open with toast, but for the benefit of us greenies who don't quite know how to do that, can someone please explain. I have toast but am lost as to how to do it. Thanks."

,4342tiks,2011-10-26T23:05Z,"When I hit play it comes up with the message ""Dirt 2 could not be run because the file ""DATA/actionmap"" is missing from the installation"".

What do I do?"
,nickthenack99,2011-11-11T17:21Z,Thanks man works 100% A++++
,nickirado,2011-11-29T00:32Z,"ok, I had problems with mounting the .toast file, what happened was osx claiming that there was a ""checksum""error, well, the ONLY way out of this is actually onpening it with toast titanium. the link is in the comments, after downloading and installing, all there is to do is open it and, through finder, control-click and open (file) with toast, it will then ask you to mount it. just do it and there you go, move it to your applications folder and replace the patch taht came with the torrent. Great!!  thanks @seb057794"
