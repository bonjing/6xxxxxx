Downton.Abbey.2x01.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 267MB]

[/b][/color] The Crawleys have been the Earls of Grantham since 1772.
In the drawing rooms and library and beautiful bedrooms, with their tall windows looking across the park, lives the family, but below stairs are other residents, the servants, as fiercely possessive of their ranks as anyone above.

Some of them are loyal to the family and are committed to Downton as a way of life, others are moving through, on the look out for new opportunities or love or just adventure.
The difference being that they know so many of the secrets of the family, while the family knows so few of theirs...
