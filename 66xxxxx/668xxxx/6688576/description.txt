
"The Silver Whistle" was a Broadway play about a resourceful tramp who enters a home for the aged on the false pretense that he is elderly and proceeds to turn the place upside down.  This play was adapted to become the third and last appearance of Clifton Webb as "Mr. Belvedere," the disruptive self-styled genius that previously appeared in "Sitting Pretty" and "Mr. Belvedere Goes to College."   Several performers from the play reprised their Broadway roles in the film.
