,denys555,2011-09-18T02:01Z,All the books from this uploader are on the hysterical end of the spectrum. 
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-09-18T02:56Z,"denys555, spoken like, well let's see - flat earther, alchemist, middle age American white guy....  May you live long enough to see the hatred in the eyes of every young  person you know, and are destroying with your selfish ignorance.  Dr. King spoke of you - 'Nothing in all the world is so dangerous as sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.'"

The same area features 2.5 billion year old fossil Stromatolites.

HOW, WITHOUT HUMAN ACTIVITY DID THE AREA IN QUESTION GO FROM VULCANISM TO TROPICAL OCEAN TO ICE WORLD AND THEN A CONIFEROUS FORREST?"

,scflats,2011-09-20T04:29Z,"Oh you evil deniers.  Don't you know denying global warming science fiction is racist?  

Global warming science fiction is settled science fiction.  

To deny it is the equivalent of saying Star Trek and Star Wars isn't real."
,dead97gsx,2011-09-20T13:40Z,"I really don't think that many of you understand the underlying science.

Been on a scientific survey or ever done research?

Do you know what ""Holocene"" means?

How about the term ""glacial minimum""?

Climate change is constant, if it were not, Canada would still be a sunny tropical ocean."
