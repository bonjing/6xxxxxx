A: 10
V: 10
English Subs: 10

Just a note, the bottom half of the video in The Mummy 3 pixelated around 1hr 37min for less than a second. Aside from that, picture was great!"
,Bouncewitit,2012-01-26T18:06Z,"Great rips! thank you. Only prob is that in order to know what they are saying when they speak a different tounque, you have to have your subtitles on. this means when they are even speaking english, you have subtitles :( is there a player or way to fix this? I've tried, wmc reg and classic, and vlc. at least with vlc i can resize them so they are not as bothersome."
,Bouncewitit,2012-01-26T18:09Z,"A: 10

English Subs: 0, only for the simple fact that I have to have them on to know what they are saying when they dont speak english."
,mdh99,2012-04-08T03:55Z,Great rip. However needs subs for non-english parts only.
