 Expect some thunder and lightning on the dancefloor, for the second 
 installment of the Ä¹Hands On ArmadaÄº series is in safe hands of 
 German duo Dabruck & Klein! Brace yourself for a ride into diversity, 
 deep bass and mind-blowing new versions of the (future) classics 
 youÄºve come to love. 

 The first Volume of Ä¹Hands On ArmadaÄº was launched with the expertise 
 of producer Alex M.O.R.P.H. It brought something refreshingly new and 
 creative, pointing out the art of remixing and showcasing the sound 
 of the German producer. Volume 1 featured 19 of ArmadaÄºs old and new 
 classics, given a fine remix stir by Alex. The Ä¹Hands On ArmadaÄº 
 series brings together the past and present, providing longevity of 
 music. 

 Old and new go hand in hand on Ä¹Hands On ArmadaÄº. ThatÄºs exactly what 
 makes Dabruck & Klein the perfect candidates for the second Volume of 
 the beloved series. Working together for more than 10 years, earning 
 their stripes as DJÄºs, producers and label-owners and creating 
 remixes for the likes of Armin van Buuren, Axwell, Sebastian 
 Ingrosso, Roger Sanchez, Mark Knight, Moby, Bob Sinclair, Public 
 Enemy, Tocadisco, Joachim Garraud, Dada life, to name but a few, has 
 made the Dabruck & Klein sound hot property. Within a flash of 4 
 years, the Dabruck & Klein have remixes more than 60 tracks, so be 
 sureÅ¯these guys know how to handle the tunes! 

 Last year, the duo has released their debut album, Ä¹2:48 AMÄº, an ode 
 to that peak time moment on the dance floor. Expect to find that same 
 diversity of sound on Ä¹Hands On Armada Vol. 2Äº, as Dabruck & Klein 
 rock you with remixes of high quality prog, house and trance. Dabruck 
 & Klein have put their hands on legendary classics such as Ä¹Veracocha 
 Ä¾ Carte BlancheÄº, Ä¹The Ultimate Seduction Ä¾ The Ultimate SeductionÄ¹, 
 Ä¹Ransom Ä¾ My DanceÄº and some of todayÄºs hottest productions,
