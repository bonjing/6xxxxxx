High is the fourth and most recent album from The Blue Nile, released in 2004.

From the opening repeating piano dirge that opens the heartbreaking "Days of Our Lives" to Buchanan's last exhortations on the eight-minute plea "Stay Close", there is not a single wasted moment on the entire album. Often when bands spend too much time refining their material in the studio, the results are drained of emotional immediacy. This will never be a danger for the Blue Nile as the band carefully composes and produces their songs for maximum emotional impact, using the studio to enhance rather than smother the painful core of Buchanan's songs.
