This is a reupload of a previous rip I did. I didnt seed it right before and still learning. So im redoing it and seeing it alot longer. Most people just hit and run, and it leaves me uploading 20 movies at a time, and I just dont have the bandwith to give everyone high speeds. So be patient, you will get the movie, even if it takes 2 days, lol. It would help if others helped and seeded, instead of just grabbing the movie and not seeing, then go around TPB and troll on peoples pages about how theyre so great, even though they do nothing to help the site but take take take. 

This is another DVD rip in MP4/H264 format for ipods and other devices. Its very good quality like all my rips, nothing wrong with it all. Any requests? More to come, enjoy!
