I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.

Ancient and Beyond - The Hilliard Ensemble Discography


After a long search I made it to complete the discography of 

The Hilliard Ensemble
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hilliard_Ensemble


They are an english ensemble performing since the 70s and orbiting around a basic quartet; they are perhaps one of the most highest singers of Ancient Vocal Music...

Sincerely I really don\'t know what to say more, \'cause while building this torrent I had the unique experience to hear their entire repertory (only few albums, where they were but guests, are missing: in short, I didn\'t find them) and I remained quite speechless... But they really help me to understand that our whole western musical tradition started simply from the pure voice...

So, if you like... dig Perotin, Desprez, Machaut, Dufay, Schutz, Bach and many more from the ancient times until their collaborations with avantgarde and contemporary composers as Bryars, PÃ¤rt, Kanchely, de Bondt... 

If you have a basic ear for music you won\'t be displeased... believe me :)


All the albums have a sampling of 320kbps, except Giya Kancheli - Abii Ne Viderem which is VBR. Enjoy
