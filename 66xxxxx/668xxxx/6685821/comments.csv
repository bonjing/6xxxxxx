,pandoraspurgatory,2011-12-24T20:08Z,This is an awesome collection! I was wondering if you could possibly rerip at least the full albums in a higher bitrate (FLAC preferred if possible)?
,MeNu25,2012-01-13T02:57Z,"How would I convert to FLAC/re-rip etc. i am not a quality genius or anything haha, also i have about 4 more songs to add to this."
,deko105,2012-04-08T08:30Z,A discography of Ghost Mice  would be great if you have it.
,CaptainFuckingCody,2012-04-25T04:59Z,I have never commented before and I've had an account on this site for a few years. I just had to tell you thank you so much for this torrent. You are awesome.
