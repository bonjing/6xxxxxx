Visions of Atlantis is a symphonic power metal band from Styria, Austria, founded in 2000. The original line-up consisted of Werner Fiedler (guitar), Mike Koren (bass), Christian Stani (vocals), Chris Kamper (keyboard), Nicole Bogner (vocals) and Thomas Caser (drums). Inspiration came both from successful symphonic power metal band Nightwish and from the myth of Atlantis. The equal combination of male and female vocals distinguishes Visions of Atlantis from Nightwish though and is more reminiscent to bands such as Lacuna Coil.
