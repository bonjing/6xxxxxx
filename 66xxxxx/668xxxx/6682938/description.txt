My thanks to the original seed on Demonoid for most of this lot, the latest and greatest video hits dated September 2011.   

If you are using this lot professionally please take care to sort out the aspect ratio's which all default mostly to 4:3.  

The majority are 16:9 and one time before I die Promo Only and others may actually get there heads round the FACT that the majority of Video music venues are using flat screen 16:9 ratio technology and rip there video's in full wide-screen and not favour the 4:3 Cathode Ray Tube user as they obviously still do today sigh...

2 x 4:3
Rest are 16:9 mostly all full screen but 3 are letterbox
Audio 192 Kbs
MPEG2 or VOB
Promo Only titles

For track listings please look at the torrent files.   All are tagged and good to go.
