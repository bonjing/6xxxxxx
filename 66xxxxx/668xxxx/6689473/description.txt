Sweet Tooth is an American comic book ongoing series written and drawn by Canadian Jeff Lemire and published by DC comics Vertigo imprint. Dubbed by some as Mad Max meets Bambi, it takes place in a mostly rural post-apocalyptic setting where some creatures are human/animal hybrids. Although the story is initially set in Nebraska, the landscape is inspired by Lemires past home of Essex County. 

Sweet Tooth, as a post-apocalyptic parable, is rife with influences such as Tim Trumans Scout: War Shaman and the Winterworld three issue mini-series.As well as art influence by Richard Corbens A Boy and His Dog written by Harlan Ellison and The Punisher: The End, written by Garth Ennis.
