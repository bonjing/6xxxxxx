Cool... Except that those who have an account there (unlike me) would probably already have found it. And from what I understand, those who do not have one won't be able to make one anyway, due to the forum's policy. So unless there is some way of creating the account (Though it's not like I don't understand the logic behind blocking it), this bit of information is entirely useless :P"
