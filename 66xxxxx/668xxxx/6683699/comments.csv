,Downzy,2012-05-01T14:43Z,It won't play full screen for me. Does anyone share this problem?
,Grailknight,2012-05-17T09:59Z,"This is a low blow! Gog sells this for about 20$ without drm and they are optimizing it/making it playabel on newer OS-es. They also dont belive in DRM!

If there is one company that deserves support it is GoG.com."
