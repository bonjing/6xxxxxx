,Nitroman2009,2011-09-17T01:24Z,Could you make Minecraft 1.8.1 with a lot of the best mods ( like this ) and with the best HD Tex pack ( From your opinion ) . 1.7.3 is kind of old right now . Thanks Man 
,ptlk,2011-09-17T01:39Z,"Well... 1.8.1 was released like 2 days ago = no mods yet, certainly not the big ones like towns or engdame equivalent exchange... I think i will upload 1.8.1 when those mods i included are all ported to 1.8+... also i will include a HD textures fix, but don't think will seed a repack with skins cause of the size..."
,Nitroman2009,2011-09-17T03:36Z,"Thanks man , I will be waiting For you when these mods will be updated to 1.8 version . I Really love your repacks ( it make thing more easy and more safe lol ) ."
