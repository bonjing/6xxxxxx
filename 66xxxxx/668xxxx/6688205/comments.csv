,Dulle,2011-09-22T02:53Z,"Omg, seriously this cliffhanger is lame."
,eightyth_attempt2register,2011-09-22T23:12Z,"Thanks to all who warned it's a cliffhanger.  I'm not going to watch it until season 5, which probably won't be till spring 2012.

Thank you Pirate Bay.  If it had been watching it on TV, I'd be screwed."
