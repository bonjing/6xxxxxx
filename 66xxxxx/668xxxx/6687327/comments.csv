,reeldeel,2011-10-06T19:07Z,"thank you, and
PLZ KEEP SEEDING THIS !!!
respect the work done"
,chitchatid,2011-10-08T23:15Z,how long can i complete downloading these files with 384 kbps download speed shared? can you separate it by one season for one torrent. this shall encourage others. thank you for the efforts.
,reeldeel,2011-10-09T01:55Z,"Isn't it better to have all the seeds at one place?
Will it really encourage more ppl to DL?
I'll UP it then... Which season do you want first?"
,reeldeel,2011-10-15T15:04Z,Has anyone downloaded yet? How is the speed and how many seeds do you see?
,chooochooo,2011-11-15T13:37Z,Great quality. Thank you very much for the huge work done here.
,chooochooo,2011-11-15T13:40Z,"@reeldeel: I see 3 seeders, including myself. It took me 9 days to complete the dl. Very slow, I know but we need more seeders here for such a great torrent."
,reeldeel,2011-11-24T08:50Z,"I have like 2x40Mbps connections and all u can DL is 100-200 KBps?
U should enable [DHT] and [peer exchange] for this torrent, this torrent is hosted at a private tracker where there are at least 30-40 seeds and about 50 leechers. Me and few other users are acting as a bridge connecting u to them through DHT and Pr Xchng. Your speed should then rise significantly."
,reeldeel,2011-12-04T11:23Z,"OK. I see this is going nowhere, u r dl'ing to slow.
I uploaded videos to MF (HTTP), first season for now.
Use download managers for higher speeds."
,reeldeel,2011-12-04T11:25Z,"Here's the link
me dia
fire
do t
co m
slash
?1hm4a8c3h6qrz
or simply add this to MF url
?1hm4a8c3h6qrz
If anyone downloads I'll upload the rest.
As always leave your comments.
I hope you will come back here to seed after DL'ing."
