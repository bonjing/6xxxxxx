With techniques for achieving a flawless portrait, this manual shows how to create stunning, professional images in any setting. Tips on how to delicately discuss and evaluate a subjectâ€™s appearance and his or her specific concerns combine with examples on how subtle changes in lighting and posing can flatter subjectsâ€”by slimming the waist and hips, enhancing the bust, narrowing the nose, reducing a double chin, and concealing baldnessâ€”helping portrait photographers sensitively downplay perceived flaws. Also illustrating how the latest in digital imaging technology can fix problems, this up-to-date resource shows how to digitally eliminate acne, whiten teeth, remove braces, and fix unnoticed clothing problems. Techniques for processing RAW files and for optimizing JPEG files for quick, but consistent, shooting are also included. With hundreds of new images, before-and-after sequences, and informative text, this is the ultimate reference for creating beautiful, flattering portraits.
