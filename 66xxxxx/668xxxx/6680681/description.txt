Minecraft Beta 1.8.1 Portable.

1.7.3 here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6607101 (or torrent number 6607101 if TPB removes the link)
This version uses batch files to put files in the right place. No manual moving needed.

1. Unzip
2. Run Minecraft.bat
3. Click Play Offline.

I\'ve been thinking of making this self-extracting, but that\'d be too easy for you.

There aren't as many mods in this release as in the last one. Single Player Commands isn't coming out for a few weeks (until the bug fixes finish)

If you like it, buy it. Seriously.

I\'ll seed as long as I can, or get it off Dropbox and put it in your torrent downloads folder. The link is in the feed in the torrent comments.

Many thanks to the Mojang and the mod developers. Sorry for distributing :)
