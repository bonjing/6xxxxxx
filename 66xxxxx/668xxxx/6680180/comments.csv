,crossfire6,2011-09-17T18:46Z,"froggie thank you so much for all that you do for us.  Many of us rely on you for top quality ups.  Maybe it was my system somehow, but the sync was lost again in the video beginning at the first visit to the Dr.  And seemed to be pretty noticeable throughout most of the rest of the film.  But it was by far the best of anything that has been offered so far and I appreciate all that you do."
,Marshmont,2011-09-18T05:10Z,"unfortunately it is not synced after the first half of the movie, rendering the rest of the movie pretty much unwatchable. the video is pretty good however so once someone get good audio this should be good to go. "
,mondocrat,2011-09-18T07:03Z,"Fuck you ingrateful lazy ass fucks. Froggie, .BONE, extremez, and about a dozen others upload tons of shit every week and you bitches are complaining? Froggie is the last person you should be whining about his uploads. STFU and bother some other schleep leech like yourself to UL the 1 you want.

BTW, I agree w.no more requests. Leave the  backbone of PB alone, they do 100x more than you or me."
,mondocrat,2011-09-18T07:17Z,"And another thing. You do know The Debt was just released 2 wks ago in the USA/Canada? It was filmed in 2010 but wasn't released here until Aug. 31, 2011.

Besides, it was a good flick. I'm not a fan of jewish superheros, as I've had more than my fill, but if you can remember IT'S FICTION,  it had a good cast &  a thriller set in 1970's East Germany. A period that fascinates me as a US observer. IMO, we now live under a STASI modeled ""police state"" w/ perv TSA patdowns of 6 yr olds & a Dept. of Homeland Security, & people don't even realize it. IT's even worse cuz of Tasers.  Now they even have PSA's trying to make a nation of snitches. ""See Something? Say Something!"" I's worse than George Orwell."

Get it knobend?
I'm as sick of people complaining about the torrents as i am about the pussies who fall on their sword ( in this case pork) to defend strangers who put illegal files on an illegal site.
Take ur own advice and STFU moaning!"
,labotimy,2011-09-19T08:06Z,"@mondocrat /sigh i hate clownshoe motherfuckers like you. its pretty simple, if your not gonna put even a little bit of fucking effort into the UL DONT FUCKING BOTHER. sit there with your dumbass fucking rant about lazy this lazy that, when the UL itself is a piece of shit waste of bandwidth and yet you defend it for the hell of it. simply put your a fucking joke and so is this UL."
,billyboy999,2011-09-22T00:10Z,"@mondocrat ...GFY ..How hard is it to copy and upload a piece of shit ,out of synch torrent onto the pirate bay and you're talking about laziness??? Go and rant somewhere else.If I wanted a shitty green skull all I'd have to do is upload other peoples crap day in day out....I'm grateful to the original up-loaders .Not these green skull fuck-wits who are too lazy to even fix the un-synched video b4 uploading it.Take you're rant and shuv it."
,QWESTSUX,2011-09-26T11:03Z,"only English subs I could find caption the english portions, and half the movie is in German...i was lost the first time she went to the Krankenhause"
