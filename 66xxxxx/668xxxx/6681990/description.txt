Book Description
JBoss in Action is the first book to focus on teaching readers in detail how to use the JBoss application server. Unlike other titles about JBoss, the authors of JBoss in Action go deeper into the advanced features and configuration of the server. In particular, it focuses on enterprise-class topics, such as high availability, security, and performance.This book walks readers through the JBoss 5 Application Server from installation to configuration to production development. It shows how to configure the serverâ€™s various component containers such as the JBoss Web Server, the EJB 3 server, and JBoss Messaging. It also provides detailed insight into configuring the various component services such as security, performance, and clustering. Beyond coverage of the core application server, the book also teaches how to use some of the â€œhotâ€ technologies that run on top of the application server, such as Jboss Seam and JBoss Portal.

The authors, both seasoned professional experts at developing and administering JBoss, provide meaningful explanations and background on many topics which they tie in with their own practical, real-world advice from their collective experience. These uniquely comprehensive explanations and the wide coverage provided in this book surpass any other content currently available in any other book, article, or documentation on the subject.
