,sora1203,2011-09-18T20:17Z,"Good day! I'm actually new to reading comics (new 52 encouraged me to read) and I've downloaded some of the new and old crossovers such as Flashpoint and Final Crisis, was just wondering if you have any idea of Zero Hour and Final Night. I mean, are they must reads? So far, I can see that the must reads are the Crisis events as well as those related to them. Thanks for the UL btw, downloaded this and GL rebirth because I am a fan of both of them. "
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-20T13:59Z,sora1203:Sorry for the late reply---in my opinion Zero Hour and Final Night are definitely not must reads...hope this helps...
