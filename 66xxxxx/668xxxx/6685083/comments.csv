Yea Europe is also the birth place of the slave trade but that doesn't change the fact that this movie was put together poorly does it?? Get off your high horse and maybe you will see that just because this movie had amazing visuals and an all-star cast doesn't mean it is Oscar worthy or that it will ""change your life"".... At best this movie is an abstract way for people who lived in the 50's to feel nostalgic about their childhoods.... And as for xniggler's comment about the acting, Brad Pitt is the only one who actually did a good job... Hell he was the only actor who was GIVEN A CHANCE to do a good job... I mean Sean Penn had what, only 3 fucking lines the ENTIRE movie?? And it was pretty much the same for the rest of the cast... I know viewers who liked it will get on me with ""oh it wasn't about the dialogue, it was about the awe-inspiring national geographic segments and the subtle body language between the family!!"".... Really?? A 2 hour film about pictures from space and a troubled father/son relationship.... Everyone has problems with their parents at one point or another, but that doesn't mean they should make a feature-length film JUST about that... I mean you can't blame the people who enjoyed this because now-a-days there are too few TRULY beautiful  pieces of cinematography out there, so when they think they sense a HINT of true beauty (in cinematography) they jump all over it.... All in all this movie is just one giant acid trip of visuals blended with sporadic monologues and no sense of a plot... Oh and I was actually one of the people who had really high hopes for this movie when I first saw the previews.... Disappointing"

,yzaj,2011-09-23T03:45Z,"Thanks EZ for yet another great rip -- A9/V9! I'm very grateful for not wasting my money.

The movie is a superficial glance at the Problem of Evil, and other rudimentary philosophical and mythical (i.e. religious) tenets. With all the depth of a screensaver, it's embodied as a bloated sump of disjointed vignettes, overlaid with whispered prayers, a best-of opera collection, and some Discovery-channel archive footage. I love a challenging, intelligent film, but if this mess of pietistic, lugubrious, and spoonfed vagaries qualifies as a ""thinking film"", then I'm obviously a hopeless fucking moron."
,emiralen,2011-09-23T03:56Z,"I made a comment on page 4, almost 24hours later (now) i will give you my recomendation.

i watched 1hour 58minutes.... had to stop watching it. i recommend it only if your high at cannabis and want to chill, this movie made no sense and understood nothing for that long of time.

to be stoned and watching it wont matter whats it all about, i think the colurs and sights will be just wow and is actually a movie where you wont loose track of the story when your high couse theres no storyline.

Enjoy peeps!"
,mcrackin,2011-09-23T06:10Z,What a horrible movie. I can't believe this received a 7.5 on IMDB.
,themancminsh,2011-09-23T11:21Z,"Wow I can't believe you are all so thick, I was transfixed by this movie and no I don't drink or do drugs (i think this might be the problem - TPB is full of dropout stoners) Ok there may not have been a car chase every three minutes to satisfy your 15 min memories. But what you do have is an emotionally charged portrait of a boy, going through the complexities of childhood.  We see this through the prism of his adult guilt looking back to what begins as an idyllic world  and then as his siblings are born he is cast into a world of responsibility of being the eldest, competition for attention and or power. His younger brother being effortlessly talented and adorable is a threat for his motherâ€™s affection  which manifests as something almost sexual in his desires. His fatherâ€™s dominance also emasculates him which becomes murderous feelings in the young boy. I may have understood it because I have two brothers close in age and we grew up in such an environment â€“ an idyllic world. I was the talented affectionate second btw. Maybe itâ€™s because we all live lives of concrete, steel and glass far removed from our childhood Eden, maybe in our slave office jobs we long to get back to a time when we ran free with nature and realised the interconnectedness of all life- the tree of life, and our place in it. From our towers of glass we look back and mourn our loss.. this film made me  cry for these reasons, we miss the great flame that is our youth and hear it only through those whispers that are our memories of it. From the big bang every atom in our bodies has been racing out to coalesce here, at this moment and upon death will race away as if nothing ever happened. Watch again not as a background but as a complex journey through the memory of the author."

,TheobaldDancelot,2011-09-23T17:06Z,"lol you are all a pile of whining, whingey babies! Have any of you ever heard the expression ""If you can't say something good, keep your mouth shut"". Its a pretty common expression passsed down from most good parents.

If you don't like the film, fine. No need to tell us a huge story about it, and then have the cheek to say malick had no need to make a film about subtle family problems.. lol. Pot, kettle, black.

I didn't like Pirates of the Carribean.. but you won't find me in the comments screaming about my opinion. cos i wasn't raised that way

The Pirate bay comments sections is mainly used for rating the audio and video... no one really cares about your opinion of the movie, as people tend to form their own opinions.

Taking the time to come on here and bitch about a film that you don't like just exposes you to be a total idiot.. no matter how intelligent you think you are and how sophisticated you can throw words together.

malick for the win!

Secondly, @TheobaldDancelot, I believe it is ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."" I guess your ""most good parents"" weren't intelligent enough to teach you how to use the english language properly. But it seems you have a problem with the ""bitching"" on this page and yet you couldn't do anything better than to come on here and bitch bitch bitch yourself. So while you're looking up the word HYPOCRITE, you should probably go and take some midol or change your tampon you annoying BITCH."

,ashen77,2011-09-24T14:58Z,"dydog2, Europe is the birthplace of the slave trade? What a complete morons you are. Slavery has been around for eons. Ever here of mesopotamia or Ancient Egypt? Just because your poor excuse of an education system blames all slavery on white people and Europeans doesnt mean it true. Infact, ther worst perpetrators of the black slave trade were other black people. ie, the rulers of African tribes, who were selling theyre fellows for brightly coloured cloth. Please learn more about history than you can fit on the back of a stamp. Rant over.

Film was pretty boring. Art is a beautiful sculpture, an intriguing painting, a thought provoking poem and so on. A nice bit of art should or could be viewed a thousand times. Who the fuck would sit through an ""arty"" film more then once?"

And I never said Europe was the birthplace of SLAVERY did I?? 1-0 Me..... Secondly, ""Slavery has been around for eons?"" hahahahaha I take it you don't know what an eon is do you??

,wayneking,2011-10-13T00:49Z,"good quality V + A, but I turned the movie off halfway through, which is something I haven't done for several years with any other film.  I'm all for artistic cinematography and new styles of direction, but the style in which this film was shot ruined it totally for me.  There was little continuity and I found most of the art, art for its own sake i.e. meaningless and a waste of time.  I loved ""The Fountain"" I liked ""A River Runs Through It"" and I have tolerated many other slow and/or artistic movies over the years without giving up half way through, but this time it was just a step too far.  Nothing at all in this movie served to hold my interest and I think I may have committed suicide had I pushed mysef to watch all the way to the end.

Like many others, I never felt a need to review a movies content, rather than it's AV quality, but if i could sum up this movie in as few words as possible, i would have to say this: it's pseudo-intellectual garbage. 

As a philosophy major, I have to say that the ""deep"" questions posed by this film are the kind of things you tackle in philosophy 101. But to people who have never encountered the problem of evil, the existence of god, fatalism, nihilism, moral relativism, or even stopped to consider their own significance in the grand scheme of the universe, these things might seem like amazing new ideas to them. 

Another thing that made the movie so terrible was the visuals - the space and beyond pictures were pretty much a run through of Messier objects and hubble shots - once again pretty amazing if you have never seen them. 

Plot wise this movie tackles nothing deeper than what the average person will experience in his or her life - death, acceptance, family, forgiveness, etc. The movie doesn't even present them in a way that is creative - and instead retreats to screensaver-esque visuals whenever storytelling becomes a choir (see 95% of the movie) 

That being said, it's the kind of movie people who think they think deep thoughts brag about to their neighbors (or the internet) about watching. 

Take away the visuals and you are left with perhaps a paragraph of dialog and a film that mostly consists of people standing around and feeling uncomfortable with each other for various reasons. 

To me it reminds me of those awkward per-pubescent school dances where everyone stood against the wall instead of dancing, only with some ""mysterious, deeper"" meaning perhaps written on a balloon somewhere in a school gymnasium. 

The only differences is, after several hours of searching for this deeper meaning, you realize that the whispered questions don't lead to some significant answers for the story's characters, but instead become the focal point for some serious intellectual masturbation that is more concerned with the questions themselves rather than how the characters answer these questions for themselves."

NO! Shut the fuck up. Going past AV quality, if you're reading movie reveiws at TPB, , and can't decide if you want to download or not - Remember, your stupid enough to read movie reviews at TPB. If Mike Tyson fucked PeeWee Herman and they had a kid, s/he'd be writing movie reviews at TPB and you wanting to date he/r would count on it. LOL, wtf dumfucks"
,1dissident,2011-10-18T02:57Z,"What's stupid about reviews on TPB?  It sounds like you're assuming that one person is actually more qualified to review a movie than another - which is actually just a silly projection offered to keep film critics employed.  Taste in films is much like taste in music, or food for that matter - totally subjective.  One person loves it, one person hates it, and really neither one of them are right because it's about what the artistic expression means to you, relative to your own experience in life.

That being said, I actually do read what people have to say about a movie.  Chances are if ten people in a row say ""this movie is shit!"" then it's probably shit.  You never know, it may be awesome, but in my experience there's usually something to what people are saying, even if it is subjective.  No one is an expert in taste, since it means something different to everyone - so reviews made here are essentially the same as reviews made by anyone, even those we consider ""experts""."
,808russian808,2011-10-18T04:27Z,"Thank you extremezone for another quality upload. You always do superb work, but this movie can lick my sack. Sean Penn is one of my favorite actors of all time, but he doesn't say a fucking word, so why even list him in the movie!! If you are too bored to fuck your dog, then this is the movie for you. Get your crotchet needles out and shove a dildo in your ass and you might be entertained. This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched it because my girlfriend wanted to and at the end we both looked at eachother and said WTF. I would highly suggest that you just flick your balls really hard than watch this movie or call your partner a different name while you're fucking. K, I'm done."

,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-10-24T14:08Z,"Wow, this movie has been incredibly underappreciated.
Though not a fantastic film (and understandably boring for some people), it wasn't nearly as bad a movie as to be expected after reading 95% of the opinions here.

What this movie needed was additional cutting of footage in those more drawn out bits - namely at the end.

Great quality, though i felt an audio channel was missing for some bits, though i'm sure it's what the film intended.

,teo51,2011-11-02T17:10Z,"I have this account for five years and this is my first comment. 
This is not a movie. This is a piece of art. It has no message as well as no story. But what it does have is nice images and it poses the deepest, most difficult existential questions we, humans, can conceive.  I think it, as a motion picture, is just a ""time out"" for us to think about those questions... But it is not for everybody. I think you need a few philosophy and psichology notions before you can start understanding what is going on. I love this. 
But on the other hand... It is useless... Utterly useless. As Socrates said, ""all i know is that i know nothing""."
