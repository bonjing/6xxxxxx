a/v : 9/9

Writing social realism and dramas is the easiest way to money. You don't need any special twist or sinister plot. Just emotional tension, whining, tears, shouting, a mute talking furry animal, a troubled kid or two, and you got yourself a bestselling chickflick."
,spifkitten99,2011-10-21T18:22Z,"Hey guys, you don't have to tell us what you think about the movie. Go to imdb for that.

Just tell us about the quality of the video.

I couldn't care less if you actually like the movie or not."
,Kovo1,2011-10-26T20:54Z,Excellent quality as always
