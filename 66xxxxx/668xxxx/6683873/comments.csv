There are other uploads that allow the choice and SUBS are also 'included' but damn it, hard coded subs are just EASY!!   I always try to look for embedded subs, if I can.  Sometimes it's just too many problems ripping it to a DVD cause my memory stick won't play subs on the player!!"

M=6.8/10 in IMDb (I agree)
