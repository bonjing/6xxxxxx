“Audio outputs temporarily muted. Do not adjust the playback volume. The content being played is protected by Cinavia™

[T],TvFreak,2011-11-09T20:33Z,Thank you man ;)
,Brotelho,2011-11-14T14:16Z,"Oh that Cinavia crap again? 

If you want to get rid of the watermark, use a video converter and it should remove the watermark. 

Any format compatible with your PS3 will work. Just convert it."
