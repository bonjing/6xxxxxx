Luciano Pavarotti - The Duets CD - 320k and bonus tracks (musicfromrizzo)

I couldn't see how a CD called "Pavarotti- The Duets" could possibly
omit he best of his performances - doing "Caruso" (with singer
songwriter Lucio Dalla) and new York New York (with Liza Minelli)- 
so here is the CD that many seem to love - with these added
songs for you - so you aren't any more doing without core 
essentials as it were!

enjoy!
