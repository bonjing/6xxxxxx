,derrylc,2011-10-12T05:49Z,"The answer is probably a resounding ""NO"", but... is there a way to login to UPlay with this cracked version?

I notice that when I try to login, it says ""Can't access the internet"", presumably because its ability to ""phone home"" has been intentionally removed."
,derrylc,2011-10-12T05:52Z,"The game runs GREAT on my quad-core iMac with 8GB RAM. Beautiful, full-screen, all settings maxed.

However...... the keyboard issues are a friggn pain in the ass!! Fortunately I have several keyboards (wired + wireless) as well as mice –– so whenever I start the game I need to check each of my peripherals to see which one it decided to cooperate with on any given day.

Major fuck-up on Ubisoft's part. But if you're gonna play a game for free, I guess there's no room for complaining :p"

I reopened it for a couple of times and none of it worked. I'm on a 2011 MBP corei7 OSx Lion 10.7.2 right now? Any help pirate guys? It would be of much help from you guys. Thanks in advance.

@hitmanrocks- Up's to that bro. Anyone that has a working ubisoft game launcher for us 10.7.2 user, if you don't mind please share :))

@Limasierra- Thanks for the tip bro! But sadly it won't work for me. I can't locate any action ""show package"" when I right-click the folder ACB.

@Apokarteron- As always, awesome awesome torrent from you bro! Thank you so much but yeah, I can't play it so if you happen to have some ACB Launcher just like what you did with your AC2, THAT WOULD BE SO SO GREAT FOR ALL OF US. As always, great job and thanks!"

,suneyes27,2011-11-11T17:18Z,"Hi, thanks for the torrent. The game works great, but for some reason doesn't accept my usb keyboard. It accepts my usb mouse, which works off the same transmitter, but doesn't recognize the keyboard at all (btw, I'm typing with said keyboard so I know it works). I'm also trying to use my Wii remote on this (as I have for several other games) but it doesn't seem to register that either. 

Is there some kind of workaround for this? I don't know much about altering game files but maybe in some of the software settings that one would open up in Terminal? I'd like to know what any of you out there might think.

Thanks!"
,suneyes27,2011-11-11T17:35Z,"UPDATE: I at least figured out how to get the keyboard working! To anyone who is having problems with this, go to keyboard preferences in your mac preferences. Go through the prompt that asks you to hit certain buttons on the keyboard. After this, it should work in-game. 

Still trying to figure out the Wii remote though; it won't even recognize the cursor."
,suneyes27,2011-11-11T21:09Z,"Also, after doing the prompts at the keyboard preferences menu, don't hit any keys again before going into the game. That should work!

If anyone has any ideas on how to fix the Wiimote problem, I'd be glad to hear them!"

,trist1995,2011-12-30T05:06Z,"ATTENTION ALL THOSE WITH 10.7.2
I have a fix! What you do is you go to applications>assassin's creed brotherhood>show package contents> contents> mac os> abcmp_sf. click on this. it will open a terminal command, and you have to type in ""solo"". voila! you can play it now! to avoid having to do this every time you want to play it, i duplicated ""abcmp_sf"" and named the duplicate ""assassin's creed brotherhood"", copied the image from the application, and dragged the duplicate to the stacks folder so it will look like it was on the dock."
