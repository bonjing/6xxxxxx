  Warriors Head Coach Michael Maguire has today named his 19 man squad  
  for Sunday's Qualifying Play-Off tie against Saints at the DW         
  Stadium, 2:45pm kick off. Wigan welcome back both Ben Cross who has   
  recovered from a broken forearm and Lee Mossop who has recovered      
  from a shoulder problem to the squad for the game replacing Chris     
  Tuson and Eamon O'Carroll in the 19 that defeated Crusaders last
