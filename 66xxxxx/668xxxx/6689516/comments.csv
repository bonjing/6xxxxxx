,neCso,2011-09-20T17:53Z,"john4551, you're noob. GOW3 is XGD3 format. At this time it's not rippable and not playable on XBOX 360. Try some googling before you post your questions."
,FucHollywood,2011-09-20T19:35Z,Or be like me buy Gears of War 3 & wait on the sidelines. I was just glad there was no new dashboard updates
,Fan1,2011-09-20T20:19Z,"Just curious about something thought id ask it here for better answers: i plugged the internet cable on my xbox and the window where 'an update is required' popped up. I pressed No. However, i had an old game in the dvd which worked b4. Only now it said 'Play DVD' and 'Mixed Media Disc'. I took out the internet cable after i saw this and closed the xbox. When i restarted it everything was back to normal again and i could play my old game. So, knowing this...is it safe to update or am i really asking for it already? "
,BZRK01,2011-09-20T22:35Z,"@fan1:
Updating to the latest dashboard, either by connecting to Live or installing the update from the latest games WILL REFLASH YOUR DRIVE BACK TO STOCK!! So if you don't want to take the hassle to reflash with LT1.92 then wait for LT2.0 to come out. "
,dibb1e,2011-09-20T23:04Z,"i have LT +1.91, if i install update on disc will it reset my drive back to stock?? "
,dibb1e,2011-09-20T23:14Z,is this another new dashboard update or same as the one that reset my last drive? i have just updated to LT +1.91 so will it reset my drive back to stock again?
,BZRK01,2011-09-21T01:13Z,"@dibble:

Go check your system menu version on your xbox. If it's already running on v2.0.13599.0 then you should be safe, if it's still under v2.0.13146.0 then you'll need a reflash after updating."

This is work or not? "
,DucatiHaSSe,2011-09-21T16:59Z,"@asboth6 (All)

It works perfect (RF) no problems. But read the text above about the dashboard versions cause it WILL update it and a risk that it flashes your DVD-ROM firmware to stock!

Been driving all night (zZzZz) ;) GREAT Game, feeling & dream graphics. Yet, no complains.
THIS ONE IS A BUYER!! as soon as it is released over here in Sweden. Didn't buy the first one cause of many flaws, but NOW!

IT LOOKS PERFECT, THANKS CodeMasters ;)

Just one thing, PLEASE make the H.U.D. as it looks on BBC-One!!"
,sjaakhoogen,2011-09-21T17:24Z,"I downloaded the game en put in in my Xbox but now my XBOx is stuck on the update  it says the status code: 3151-351F-B300-0F00-C000-0013

,andymalmo,2011-09-21T19:07Z,"Just need to be sure it is safe to play this and do the update if i have LT+ 1.9 and version v2.0.13146.0 my son will be so happy if we can play this

Thanks for help"
,BZRK01,2011-09-21T20:07Z,"@sjaakhoogen:

I fixed my own xbox yesterday, had the same problem after a disc update on the Monkey Island game. Keep in mind, your drive will be reflashed to stock during the proces, but since you're stuck on the update screen you don't have much of a choice right?

just follow these steps:

1 - download either the May 2011 or July 19th dashboard update from microsoft (google: 2.0.13146.0 for May, 2.0.13599.0
 for July)

2 - Extract the RAR file, you'll end up with a folder called ""$systemupdate""

3 - Put the entire folder in the root of an FAT32 formatted USB drive (make sure the drive is empty)

4 - Put the disc you had in your tray during the failed update in your xbox and plug in the usb-drive in the controller port

5 - Open and close the tray once, after this the update should resume (at least it did in my case)

6 - You should be able to start up your xbox normally after this. Update to the latest dash and you're unbricked

7 - Reflash your drive to play backups again, since the new MS update reflashes your drive back to stock. 

Worked for me, so it should work for you.


@andymalmo:

Depending on what drive you have in your xbox your firmware will be either safe or reset to stock. This game installs the latest dashboard (v2.0.13599.0). The second to last dashboard update (v2.0.13146.0, which you're already running) reflashes all disc drives back to stock firmware. The latest update (July 2011) only reflashes DG-164DS drives (mostly found on 360 slims). For more info on the different dashboard updates check this wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_system_software"

,chronic2011,2011-09-22T19:05Z,Ok guys here's how it is. TO PLAY THIS GAME U NEED LT+1.91 AND DASHBOARD VERSION 13599.

Use hex editor to get the key back as jungleflasher won't show you the key.
I found my key and reflashed the drive.
The problem is though you will be stuck in a update loop unless you get f1 2011 original to complete the update before you reflash.
Took my half hour to rectify"
