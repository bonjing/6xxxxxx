By the way, i think you ripped this from mx-life.tv ,  is the video quality good on this site? like can you watch the race and replay in 720p? cause i'm thinking of getting an account"
,mxfanboy,2011-09-22T00:14Z,"Hi. Indeed this upload come from mx-life. What you see on these videos is the best quality you can have on the website. It's not 720p, more like 480p. Get the account, they have done a really good work all along the year and it's not expensive. And you can watch qualifying races, european championships..."
