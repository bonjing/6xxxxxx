@ashen77 and to all the racist idiots, please do us all a favor and follow MindDepth's suggestion"
,ashen77,2011-10-05T15:39Z,"I'm not racist. Its just black american comedians that says the words nigger and bitch in almost every sentance do my fucking head in. Saying the word nigger doesnt make me a racist... calling some one it, would.

Dont worry J.R.Dobbs... you cant help having a shit sense of humour (or being a cunt).

As for MindDepth's suggestion... as tempting as that sounds, i'll give it a miss for now.

Now, if you wanna see a FUNNY black american comedian (who doesnt say bitch of nigger in every sentance) Reginald D. Hunter's DVD is out soon. Now that is one funny fella."
,mister15,2011-10-07T09:10Z,"I agree with ashen77. 99% of black standup comedians talk about race, being black, how it is, what it is, the different ebonics they speak, and how white people don't understand them. It was funny the first one, two times I saw it. Now it's so overused it's not funny anymore. "
,80cent,2011-10-08T15:48Z,"im white an i laughed, kev is funny as hell. so to people saying since they're black its funny well here i am saying im white and it is hilarious."
,mister15,2011-10-08T16:55Z,"80cent...your name is probably (correct me if I'm wrong) connected to 50cent? Which means you listen to jiggaboo music? 

Laughing at black comedians is ok! I like Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior and a couple more. But MOST of todays black comedians have too much race related material. It's all about being black, and how that affects their lives. Which seems to be pretty much everything. I have seen hundreds of stand up shows, and every time a black comedian comes up, I can pretty much tell what he's going to talk about...that he is black. Funny some times, but like I said, after a while....hearing ni**er this and ni**er that, like Chris Rock does. Wow, who needs sleeping pills? 

So, 80cent, get yourself another 20 cent and stop listening black music, stop laughing at black comedians who exploit their ""blackness"". Have some self-respect. Don't only BE white. ACT white. "
,dnbkid303,2011-10-08T17:44Z,"Sorry, but I'm with ashen77 on this one too... not because I find the word offensive, but because it is a played out shtick... also I fucking love how nobody sees how fucking racist most black Americans are and invent this idea that 90% of white Americans are in some kind of hate group! Well I have to say I live in Seattle and the only racism I EVER see is those of other color segregating THEMSELVES and hating on EVERYONE! I haven't met one white racist in my life... weird."
,PorshaRenee,2011-10-09T02:32Z,@dnbkid303 and mister15 / Racism and Ignorance at its finest!!!!!! If you dont like black comedians or Kevin Hart...Dont waste your time downloading/watching the shit! Plain and simple!!! 
,mister15,2011-10-09T08:00Z,"Porsharenee@ I actually think that you're the racist here. As I said, most of the black comedians today are MOSTLY focues on race when they do they routine. The whole black culture, especially in music is SUPER-RACIST, SEXIST and RUDE. Have you even listened to any black music - like rap or hip hop? Actually read the lyrics? If not, you should, before opening your mouth. Black stand-up comedians are among the most vile, racist people out there. After listening to Chris Rock, Dave Chapelle, Katt Williams, Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence...it's all about black this, black that - spiced inbetween by ""bi*ches"" and ""h*es""... Real classy...."

(again, i am not racist, but if i was Avincy is not doing a very good of proving a stereotype to be false) keep up the good work!"
,mrmr87,2011-10-10T21:55Z,"never write comments on here, usually just read them and laugh. but i would just like to thank my ancestors for choosing england as my homeland where its still not acceptable or funny for black comedians to use the term ""nigger"" i like comedy, go to alot of comedy clubs in england and they have black comedians but they tell jokes that are funny and not all about race....i watched this, tried to like it but he just isnt funny"
,PorshaRenee,2011-10-10T23:33Z,"@mister15 You are soooooo dumb you make me laugh!!! Yes I listen to Hip Hop, and just like in Rock and Roll and Country, you have people who talk about dumb shit and people who are on a more intellectual level. The WHOLE black culture is not super-racist, sexist, and rude. Theirs plenty of racist,sexist, and rude WHITE PPL,SPANISH PPL, AND ASIANS. So stop being an ignorant dumb ass because your making white people look bad! And Like I said before if you dont like black comedians and if you think they are ALL one dimensional then DONT FUCKING WATCH IT!!!! toodles"
,mister15,2011-10-11T10:39Z,"Porsharenee@ Why do you laugh at black people like Kevin Hart who calls his own daughter ""bitch"" in his show. His wife is a bitch, his mother is a bitch, his daughter is a bitch, his father had a long dick and it was really funny when he was high on drugs, and on and on... wtf? 

As I said, and as other posters here commented too...it was funny when Murphy did it..or Pryor...but when nr 432 does it and just ups the ante with more crude ni**er, bitch, ho, pimp, dick, ass ""humour"", it just becomes sad. 

Of course - as you said - I don't have to download it if I don't like it. But there is a real problem here for black people, if this is how they want to show themselves to the rest of the world. How are they going to rid themselves of racist stereotypes when this is what they produce? THe same goes for todays movies, where 50cent of all people is their new moviestar...and only plays in movies involving drugs, shooting, hoes and whatever. I would say 80% of what comes out from black artists is derogatory (music videoes with black women shaking 'dat ass), music like hip hop with lyrics only about getting it on or getting high or da muthafucking po-po, or like this guy here - talking about ni**er this and that and his fathers dong. 

If they want to be respected, they have to start respecting themselves first."
,insanityensue,2011-10-14T01:04Z,"i hate everyone.... fuck color, if its your thing to be stuck in the past then fuck off. i hate that people have to get stuck on race. so the blacks were slaves a LONG time ago, guess what so were irish, german, jews, scottish, french, english, and a lot of others i cant think of right now. WHO CARES? everyone that keeps talking about it keeps the shit alive. stfu about it abd it will die!.

nigger is just a word, just like cracker, kyke, swammie, nazi, and a whole shitload more. again if someone considers these words racist then guess what, others will too. i dont give a fuck what gets said. they are only words!

and one more thing, don't fucking focus on nigger and bitch this and that so much, it kills the real humor of the comedian's material. how many of you laugh when a comedian says ""man, us niggas love fried chicken. i called my homie the other day and he said i want original recipe"" ALL OF YOU DO, hypocrites."
,djtfc3s,2011-10-14T17:08Z,"insanity ensue you hit the fucken nail on the head I hate everyone equally also. It's not like you here jewish comedians out there joking about the holocaust or being slaves to egyptians, why cause that shit isn't funny black rights were funny when Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby and Eddie Murphy did stand up cause it was current it isn't anymore stfu about it. Native Americans have more problems than any African American has ever had at least negros have had voices like Martin Luther King and so on who the fuck stood up for the so called ""indians"". every race on this earth has had pain at sometime in their lives get the fuck over it and move on and live in the present instead of the past as you said words are only words listen to Eminem the best fucken rapper in the world who will never be recognized as such cause he is white, now that's racist. I also think he is a better comedian than this clown, anyone who listens to Eminem's insane lyrics and doesn't laugh now and then has no sense of humour as he says it's all lyrical content free speech and such you don't hear him being racist do you, no he wouldn't be funny if he was. and to all you dickheads out there no I'm not downloading this shit I like Russel Peters better I thought this guy was someone else than the guy from I'm a grown little Man or whatever his last shit was called, fuck you midget man"
,Riaken,2011-10-15T11:45Z,"People will always live in the past. ALWAYS!!! I'm black, I find this shit funny cause its in the past. Do I admit its hard being black in America still, yeah it actually is. do I admit that back comedians still joke about it a bit to much, Yeah I do but thats not to say its not funny. Howeve rI've seen white comedian, pakistan's people and every other comedian (you to white people) use their race for a joke, NUMEROUS times. Kevin does NOT only talk about being black. In ""seriously Funny"" it was mostly based on his family life. Kevin is actually very universal. so he decided to use being black this time, ight so? People laughed, and at the end of the day thats all that matters. You didn't like it? Ok go find something else to get yer giggles. this whole comment war on black comedy and shit is rather played out in itself, don't you think? Also to the two above me that say you ""hate everybody"", grow up little kids. Your not cool."
,Riaken,2011-10-15T11:51Z,"On a side note mister15, this is Television. ""Black people shouldn't show this side of themselves to the world"" and they shouldn't. Heres some info, not all of us do. BLACK PEOPLE would imply we all do it, but we don't. ""Oh, he called his wife daughter, etc. a bitch =O"" Yeah you do know that there's alot more than black people that do that right >.> You could say its emphasized in the black community but don't make it sound like its only us. You know what, remove us. Were all human, and at the end of the days if HUMANS want to be respected, than they should stop doing it. Not BLACK people, my good man."
,deeZey,2011-10-15T15:43Z,"hmmm....another meaningless argument. where to start. i dont know what tickles me more, the fact that the people with argumentative points against the movie seem to have MORE knowledge on the movie than the ones arguing FOR it. and i understand ppl often have free time on their hands. but it shows a lack of character to take SO much time out of your day to vent about an already VERY controversial topic of race in American culture. it baffles me that we live in a media-craved WORLD that yields SO many entertainment related options and in a country which has based its moniker on freedom, we still OFTEN attempt to mold others to our beliefs or likings. In this case we have an issue as EASILY resolvable as: downloading YOUR favorite comedian, watching something tuned to YOUR liking, or possibly re-creating something similar with YOUR on personal preference and marketing. Im not going to get into the many points that would unveil the lvl of ignorance being spread bkuz many net debaters feed off of being ignorant as well as the bias it may produce towards blacks, but what you watch and/or listen to is a personal preference and you have options. There isnt ONE song or movie who's topic matter is accepted by every1 in the world. If you arent liking the story/topic/theme/etc., just know there are many people who are. 15 Mil ppl (mostly white) felt it was worth paying money to go see this guy ""exploit his blackness"". The worlds most popular city and largest city in the US doesnt even have 15 mil ppl. (and of course that doesnt include the ones who went out and bought a copy or the guys sitting here downloading and watching ENTIRE show then starting racial/ignorant arguments on the movies wall lol."
,deeZey,2011-10-15T15:50Z,"and on another note. tpb needs a ""like"" button. i dont usually post on here but i like to read comments sometimes and i applaud the ones civil enough to leave educated argumentative points instead of bashing their opposing debater (although a lot of times, such as this, the argument should have never even developed)"
,cjolwd,2011-10-16T11:24Z,"@mister15 I think your memory is playing tricks on you.. Richard Pryor & Eddie Murphy both have/had very race related comedy shows.

,camo12345,2011-11-02T07:15Z,"why is it that black people tell the same jokes over and over and over... they always bring their colour into it... you're black, we get it, we don't care. Being black doesn't make you special, it used to when people were racist, but now you aren't... so stop using it to make jokes. Same goes for the orientals and middle easterns, we don't care that you talk like an asian. And the same for women, all they do is make jokes about being a woman. White male comedians don't do any of that and they're still funny, probably the funniest, in the UK anyway. Most Americans are over the top and will laugh at anything... we're about 15 years ahead of you guys in comedy."
,camo12345,2011-11-02T07:54Z,"And to the guy who said 15 million people went to see him... no they didn't you idiot. It made $15 million in ticket sales. How much were his tickets? $35, maybe more... that makes it less than half a million people. 

Americans are so stupid.... I watched a guy interviewing random Americans on the street asking them what they think the worlds population is... none of them knew it was around 7 billion. None of them were even close, some were saying ""umm, i definitely know it's in the millions, maybe a billion"".

I have no problem with a opinion because their are funny ass white comedians but saying the other one isn't funny at all base on race means you can't relate to them, so I consider that o'kay. It's racist, and bitchassness when you say racist comments on a website behind a computer, but wouldn't say that shit to no black persons face. It's easy to type and talk shit. I give more respect to racist that are upfront about it than what all ya'll do on blog sites and website where you can leave a comment because at least they leave us alone, and mind their own business, and don't have time or want to look up anything dealing with black people.

Ive seen funnier one-liners at funerals.
Download, save it to disk and then burn the disk.
That will get you more laughs than this movie."
,ANGRYUNIBROW,2012-01-16T22:21Z,"So instead of commenting on the quality of the torrent you comment on the comedian, making racist remarks and slurs?

GROW UP"
,skyline35,2012-01-19T02:24Z,"shut the fuck up you stupid british mother fuckers. Calling us stupid and uneducated, what the fuck you talking about? I recall it was an America that kicked your ass in the Revolutionary war and were smart enough not to stand in lines and shoot instead we used some fucking tactics to take out your army. And then's whose little bitch asses came back trying to make peace with America? You British morons. Would you like some tea and crumpets? Bitches! How about some beer and a hot dog motherfucker!"
,skyline35,2012-01-19T02:26Z,"ohh @heffy001 you wanna know who was rubbish? your mother, when she was in bed with me last night. "

Except the big ass fucking constant time stamp at the bottom corner, which is annoying as hell, it's a good torrent."
,skyline35,2012-01-19T10:18Z,"@thestigiam you are a poor excuse for a human being. Hasn't anyone taught you not to see in color? We are all humans here, no matter what color, race religion, ethnicity, whatever we are all equal. Dr. MLK cringes knowing that people like you are still alive. I think you were born in the wrong generation my friend. Here as long as you can make a name for yourself, you may not have to be talented but you have to do your job. Hart gave here what his audience wants, if you don't like it GTFO!"

""you stupid british mother fuckers"" - @skyline35

Ah, irony. So much of it in two posts made within hours of each other by just one person!

I'm an American citizen born in NYC to British parents. I love my country, but to be honest it was only in the past 10, maybe 15 years or so that the quality of our beer has come close that of Great Britain, or, indeed, just about any other European country (and many, many others throughout the world) and almost all of the various types of beers made in America are based on beers pioneered in other countries. Finally, many of the best American breweries are run by brewmasters from outside of our country.

That so many Americans have for decades called Coors Light ""beer"" is a source of unending humiliation for me, as it should be for the rest of our country.

Finally, it's curious you mention hot dogs. Hot dogs - also widely known as frankfurters and wieners - are a food whose history is mostly centered around Germany, and the first known seller of sausages in rolls in America was a German immigrant on Coney Island."
,Heffy001,2012-01-21T04:22Z,@skyline35 - Is that why she wasnt home when i went to see her. Also probably explains why she was mumbling something about being sick of guys having a really tiny penis.  Cheers for letting me know mate.
,Noffilli,2012-01-22T15:33Z,"LMAO at all these fake people on here. It's so easy to talk shit over the computer.

,BobbyT911,2012-02-04T06:39Z,"Ok some comments are just retarded, but I do get where some are coming from it has been done to death. On an other note it seems as though its OK to be proud to be any race except if your proud to be white your called a racist. Regarding the negative stereotypes that comedy like this gains it has nothing on any real life crime show in the US. Its gotten to be a joke. I watch the first 48 on A&E and it seems like most murders are by some black guy with a stupid nick name like Dolla or Streetz. So back to my point about stereotypes this is real life and it does more damage to black image than any comedian I've seen.   "
,Shining69,2012-02-07T07:13Z,"Im not racist, so many bad remarks on this torrent download ... please see Eddie Murphy delirious ... amazing ... About the american opinion .... yes ... the WORLD think that most Ãmericans are really dumb ... you are in a college crisis ... you have the best and the worst student conditions ... and the worst students"
,halofubar,2012-02-08T00:01Z,"Bunch of sick mofos making racist comments where they don't belong (not that they necessarily belong anywhere). Think this rancid stench of putrid ignorance has turned me off from ThePirateBay entirely... if moderators don't just up and delete/ban people who make these comments, this site isn't worth visiting anymore."
,Mister22,2012-02-09T00:31Z,"Haloafabread - Why don't ya'll blacks make your own torrentsite...called....Wheresmymofotorrentat.com or freehandoutstorrent.com. What about Chickenandwatermelontorrents.com? 

There's no racism in saying that Kevin Hart sucks donkey ass. Lot's of white people suck too. We just don't complain that much.

Now let's get some ethnic jokes going here folks..."
,halofubar,2012-02-10T01:43Z,"Mister22, I'm only talking about the racism being wrong, so if you disagree you're probably racist. The fact that your attack starts off assuming that I'm black just proves that even more (and I'm white by the way, not that it matters)."
