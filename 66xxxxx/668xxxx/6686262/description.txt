Release Notes:
Ok here we go with a nice dvd screener of kevin Hart Laugh at my 
Pain. Thanks to Tranz / PA for passing the source files over to work 
with..
Over all its a nice screener but only runs for 55mins which leads to
think that the actual cinema release / dvd release may have some 
bonus footage, but all the show is there from start to finish.

Hope you all Enjoy
