,digibyte234,2011-10-21T01:18Z,"Downloaded from somewhere else, but I just wanted to say that this is a fantastic application--beautiful interface, very useful, and lots of features.

Only a few tiny problems that keep me from buying it, mainly the fact that you can't schedule classes on a bi–weekly schedule (not a problem for everyone tho)"
