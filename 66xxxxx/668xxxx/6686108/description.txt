Old PC apps I've been collecting since 1997. Cracks/serials are included if required. I don't have time to create and upload separate torrents for each one, but feel free to do so yourself once you've verified each app works and have scanned for viruses. If you search for my name (twijjit) you should also be able to find my collection of old games. :)
