,RMJ13,2011-09-17T18:05Z,"SAVE FIX

you can use other,s game save's too with this method and this works with any version of the game

 go to game save folder c/program files/steam/userdata/what ever large # you have here, and what ever your save file is, 57940 was the one we used to use .

 delete the remotecache ""vdf"" file

now create 13140 and copy the ""remote "" file there,

restart smart steam 2 times,

then start the game you will see no saves!

turn game off, restart smart steam,

restart game, game save should now be there!

this creates a new "" vdf "" file for the save and that makes it work"

,ValcX,2011-09-21T21:22Z,"I'm stuck at 98.8 percent, it was going fine and steady and now no matter what i do it won't go past a few bytes per second, also looking at the other leechers, alot of them are stuck at the same spot, I'd suggest a different torrent for those looking to download"
,yoimtehreal,2011-09-24T01:45Z,"@ValcX 
that is mainly because there are no seeders seeding the file even the creator isnt seeding wich is weird"
,piraya007,2011-09-30T18:23Z,"@RMJ13

,demonicpanthoen,2011-10-27T01:08Z,once this downloads il seed for aslong as possible
