Alf is a perfectly ordinary 12-year old kid. He loves to read comic books and hang out with his younger sister. But heâ€™s also a bit soft-spoken, making him a perfect target for the gang of bullies at his school. Toke, his classâ€™s â€œfat kid,â€ has it even worse though. Thanks to some inspiration found in one of his comic books (â€œWithout an ally, Iâ€™ll stay small and weak,â€ says the mangaâ€™s hero) Alf teams up with Toke to combat the tormentors head-on. But Toke turns out to be a dangerously apt pupil.
