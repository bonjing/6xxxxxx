Crashing the Lines 3 of 3 - iPod

DVD Rip to iPod

Producer: Christopher J. Petrilli

Trained in the Philippines by Filipino legend Grandmaster Ciriaco \"Cacoy\" Canete himself, 8th degree black belt Christopher Petrilli has distilled his knowledge of Japanese aikido, Indonesian silat and Filipino Doce Pares eskrima into an elevated system of stick fighting that goes far beyond anything previously captured on video.

Volume 3 wraps up with several more locking and throwing lines, going from over the arm to under it. Finally, he takes the stick away, teaching you how to do the same techniques empty-handed to the same brutal effect. For information purposes only.

Show someone you love them, hit\'em with a stick!
