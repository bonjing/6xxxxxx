All the codecs you need for Vista to play AVIs, DVDs and more! It does not contain a 
media player and it doesn't associates filetypes. With this package installed you will 
be able to use any media player, limited only by the players' capabilities, to play 
DVD's, movies and video clips of almost any filetype. Streaming video is supported in 
all popular web browsers. By default you won't need to make any adjustments to enjoy a 
variety of media content immediately. Users have the ability to choose what is installed 
using the public redistributable or after an unattended install, you can select to remove 
specific portions without removing the entire package. Future releases will recognize 
previous releases and are capable of performing upgrade installations. 
The Vista Codec Package is also compatible with all versions of Windows XP.
