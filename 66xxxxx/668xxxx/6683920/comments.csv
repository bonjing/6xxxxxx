It installed fine but it did take over all my previous associations made for VLC and Media Player and I had to re-associate them one file-type at a time. No big deal and I would have been happy with it as it did play everything in media player.

Problem 2 however was a doozy. Instead of Play being at the top of the right-click menu (on right-clicking a playable file), it has instead a programme I have installed called 'CD Check' - so to play a file I couldnt even double-click it as CD Check would open up.

In the end to play a file I had to choose the right-click option to 'Open With' even once the associations had been set correctly as I could find no way of removing the 'CD Check' option form the right-click menu.

In the end I un-installed it. I am unsure as to why it did this on my system, it may not do it on yours but I still wanted to let others know and to thank RedDragon for the share."
