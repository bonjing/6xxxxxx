,NaNz_97,2012-01-08T15:31Z,"This really makes the job accomplished! comrades, just mark ignore to the comments sticked before.This really works! to any of you having an obstacle about making it going, here's that secret key:

1.Download this CS stuff
2.After downloading, transfer this to your hard drive and let it be on install
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6635602/CrossOver_Pro__amp__Games_[NyaTaku]_OSX_Lion_Compatible  - the provided Crossover with this CS
I probably use this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6133614/CrossOver_10_Pro   (nothing's gonna be on crisis, choose any link for Crossovers)
3.Simply expose your CS folder(Cs1.6_MacOsX_CrossOver)
4.After it, right click on 'CS1.6cxarchive' > Open With > (you probably have to click on 'Other' or there will the cooked stuff already, named 'CrossOver (default)' CrossOver (default)
5.Going after with that, CrossOver window enters, name it anyway of your requirement and then click on 'Create'
6.After that, there would be some kind o' loading and stuff.
7.Across the 6th step, if your Mac's pretty apace enough, you'll get it running smooth on your screen.

NO requirement to touch the 'Counter Strike 1.6 Non Steam (CS16)' it's got shiz and nothing in the interior and probably crap, it won't work as directed in the .txt stuffed stiff 

Hope it got employed!"
