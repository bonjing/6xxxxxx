World's Most Dangerous Roads 
BBC's new Sunday night series looks to be quite an entertaining way to pass an hour for the next few weeks. Has Celebrities tackle some of the world's most infamous roads after having a brief few hours training, before departing on the Adventure of a Lifetime. It turned out to be a bit more challenging than they bargained for!


1)  Part:1 Alaska 
Comedian Sue Perkins and adventurer Charley Boorman travel across Alaska to the notorious Dalton Highway - a dirt track built in the 1970s as a supply road to support the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Highway maintenance is a full time job here with avalanche units operating throughout the year. As Arctic conditions close in on them, the pair have to rely on the help of hardcore truckers for whom the highway is home. The rules of the road are: keep the CB radio switched on, don't exceed 50mph, and when an 18-wheel truck comes thundering down the rollercoaster of a road towards you, get out of the way!

2)  Part:2 Nepal 
Comedians Rhod Gilbert and Greg Davies attempt to drive through the mountainous, landlocked nation of Nepal. Starting from the chaotic border with India, they travel across the country's most important roads, from highways that maintain its cities to freshly-dug dirt tracks that connect to isolated communities. There are uplifting stories throughout, but it is a journey that is fraught with danger. Besides having one of the world's highest rates of road traffic accidents, floods and landslides are an everyday occurrence, blocking traffic for days on end and claiming dozens of lives every month. After days of swerving overloaded buses, dodging trucks and clinging to crumbling mountain roads, disaster strikes within sight of their final destination.

3)  Part:3 Peru 
Adventurer Ben Fogle and comedian Hugh Dennis drive a historic route from the Peruvian Andes to the depths of the Amazon, along roads built to conquer and exploit the natural wealth of Peru's rainforest. It's a rollercoaster ride of 2,000 foot drops and hairpin bends on one-lane dirt roads, stretching from mountains high above the clouds to the muddy, humid trails of the jungle. At the end of this epic journey they hope to find the lost city of Constitucion. To get there, they will have to endure some of the most remote and dangerous roads in South America. It's a journey that will test them both to the limit and beyond.
