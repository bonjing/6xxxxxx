50 old PC games I've been collecting since 1997. Most of these games are ripped (i.e., had extra content removed), and cracks/serials and install instructions are included with each one. I don't have time to create and upload separate torrents for each one, but feel free to do so yourself once you've verified each game works and have scanned for viruses. If you search for my name (twijjit) you should also be able to find my collection of old apps. :)
