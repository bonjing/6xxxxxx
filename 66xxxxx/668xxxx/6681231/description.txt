 RELEASE NOTES                                                      
                                                                         
 King Arthur: Fallen Champions bridges the gap between King Arthur I and
 II with a tale of three brave souls. Sir Lionel, a brave knight on a    
 quest to rescue a damsel in distress. Lady Corrigan, a creature of the  
 voices in the night.                                                    
                                                                         
 A knight, an enchantress, and a prophet - these three will become      
 champions of a forgotten battle that began long, long ago.              
                                                                        
 The gameplay relies on a story-based, mission-to-mission plot. Players  
 will choose missions and upgrade heroes. Each hero has his own          
 storyline and each of these storylines incorporates three battles,      
 the major foe in the 10th battle.                                       
                                                                         
 The battlemaps are very diverse both in visuals and in construction:   
 tactical-RPG situations (with a limited number of elite units and       
 heroes), tactical battles (with huge armies on the field) and massive   
 battles against a general AI under very unusual circumstances.          
                                                                         
 Features:                                                               
                                                                         
 Follow three unique heroes, each with their own storyline featuring     
 adventure quests and epic fights. The fates of these three heroes are   
 intertwined, and their quests lead up to one massive battle under       
 extraordinary circumstances                                             
                                                                         
 A variety of battle types fought on unique, beautifully crafted         
 battlemaps, ranging from smaller tactical skirmishes to grand           
 engagements against superior numbers                                    
                                                                         
 A dark and gripping fantasy tale that bridges the gap between King      
 Arthur and King Arthur II, set in an ancient region of Britannia,       
 beyond the well-known territories of King Arthur Ã» The Role-playing     
 Wargame.
