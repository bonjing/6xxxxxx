,foxeiy,2011-11-13T11:59Z,"no offence people, but fuck y'all, the people about spamming and the ones who support him, and this is why

Kid you go potential, and unlke the others telling you to go somewhere with this, I'm telling you to SIGN A FUCKING RECORD LABEL AND START MAKING MONEY! I'd buy it

And i know this isnt the actual kid who is seeding this, but still, in case you read this"
,stevieb1,2011-11-29T17:39Z,thanx :D
,w00tbie,2012-01-04T04:17Z,"great beats, thanks for sharing your music. 

a comment on the spamming, i don't mind it (it's a fair trade) but you might consider being less verbose about it. it's currently taking up half the comment area - like walking into a room and screaming your message. you could just provide a link for those who want to know more. cheers. "
,HangingPaper,2012-02-17T22:13Z,Tbh i dont care if he spams other torrents. His music is great and how else do you think he could get big without forking out thousands in advertising?
,Made1985,2012-02-24T09:42Z,stop with all the hating people if you dont like it dont click on the link if he didnt spread the word i would not have downloaded this.fucking haters should all be shot in the fucking face! thanks jjdubstep!!!!
,migikion,2012-02-27T12:36Z,"stop all you bitches to pretend you give a shit about the artist. He is spamming every f@#king torrent. There's a lot of people out there making great music. Should they all start promoting on PB? 
P.S Foxeiy, you f@#king hypocrite. If you were willing to spend a single dollar on buying music you wouldn't be here."
,ANGRYUNIBROW,2012-03-17T01:44Z,Your endless spamming is the only way you have become slightly popular.
,JoabW,2012-04-02T03:16Z,"I'm conflicted. There are some great songs. But I fucking hate the spamming
