THIS GOES AFTER BATMAN - YEAR ONE

Batman: The Man Who Laughs is a one-shot prestige format comic book by Ed Brubaker and Doug Mahnke, released in February 2005, and intended as a sequel to Batman: Year One.

It tells the story of Batman's first encounter with the Joker in post-Crisis continuity. The storyline is based on the Joker's original introduction in Batman #1 (1940). The story "Images" in Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #50 (September 1993), taking place some time after their first meeting (according to Batman), is tied into continuity as Batman's second encounter with The Joker.

The title is a reference to the movie The Man Who Laughs, whose star, Conrad Veidt, was an inspiration for The Joker.
