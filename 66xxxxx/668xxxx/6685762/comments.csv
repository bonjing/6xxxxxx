the quality that used to be put up, now most of the tiime is not worth the effort or time...

,scoobydont,2011-09-19T04:17Z,"luke, you are the one who posted that (and you only mentioned retagging it, which i didn't). i didn't see any cropped versions up yet so i spent about an hour of my time working on it, is there a problem with trying to help out? it isn't perfect but this is what we have right now so go get something better or find something to do other than sit around and say ""i told you so""."
