,DCANova,2011-11-02T06:17Z,"This program worked perfectly!  I was able to install the full version on one computer, and then a ""view only"" version on another for viewing the logs sent by email.  Worked 100% with the tested serial code."

Have you guys really ever been as far as decided to use go want to do look more like?

All kidding aside no, this is not a virus. Your antiviruses may pick it up as a virus considering its a fucking KEY LOGGER INSTALLER. If you got any other virus alert than a keylogger one then maybe you got a virus from another torrent, just because you got a virus doesnt mean you got it from the last thing you downloaded."
,mybabyko,2012-04-16T00:49Z,I hate to say this but i think it is a virus... If you download the non-cracked or clean version from the maker of this program your virus detection program will not say it is a virus but if you download this one it does. Lets not forget about the file size is way to small. 7.19MB the real program is 17.2MB thanks but no thinks... (VIRUS)
