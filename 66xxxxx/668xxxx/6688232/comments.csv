,MikeXRyan,2011-09-20T04:51Z,Stop uploading this piece of crap.  This show is dead. Ashton Kutcher is a douche. They are paying him $15.4 million for the freakin' season and he's not worth a thin dime! 
,rokomo,2011-09-20T06:39Z,"They did a really good job introducing Ashton onto the show. Like it is very hard not to like the character. He is straight forward about his sexuality, honest, and pretty goofy guy. The other characters on the show are like ""I like him."" Anyways this new character seems interesting so i am going to continue watching till i get bored."

,devlicious,2011-09-27T23:14Z,"Haha, i'm just downloading this to see how the show will die... 
Nothing wrong with Kutcher, but usually when a main character leaves the show dies... 
And we all have to agree, Sheen made this show!

Thanks for the up! "
