This biography profiles bohemian priest and scholar John Hus, who's given short shrift in the history books despite setting the stage for the Protestant Reformation in Europe. A century before Martin Luther, Hus broke with church canons and sewed the seeds that ultimately blossomed into the Reformation. But Hus refused to recant, was incarcerated and burned at the stake in 1415 for his heresy.

Jan Hus (1369 - 1415), often referred to in English as John Hus or John Huss, was a Czech priest, philosopher, reformer, and master at Charles University in Prague. After John Wycliffe, the theorist of ecclesiastical Reformation, he was, before Luther, Calvin and Zwingli, the first actual Church reformer.

He is famed for having been burned at the stake for heresy against the doctrines of the Catholic Church, including those on ecclesiology (the branch of theology concerned with the nature, constitution and functions of the Church), the Eucharist (the most important Christian sacrament), and other theological topics. Hus was a key predecessor to the Protestant movement of the sixteenth century, and his teachings had a strong influence on the states of Europe, most immediately in the approval for the existence of a reformist Bohemian religious denomination, and, more than a century later, on Martin Luther himself.

Between 1420 and 1431, the Hussite forces defeated five consecutive papal crusades against followers of Hus. Their defense and rebellion against Roman Catholics became known as the Hussite Wars. A century later, as many as 90% of inhabitants of the Czech lands were non-Catholic and followed the teachings of Hus and his successors.
