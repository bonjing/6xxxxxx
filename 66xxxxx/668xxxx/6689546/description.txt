Two Secret Service agents, the intuitive Pete Lattimer (Eddie McClintlock) and the by-the-book Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly), are assigned by the enigmatic Mrs. Frederic (CCH Pounder) to the mysterious Warehouse 13, in the South Dakota badlands. There they work with Artie Nielsen (Saul Rubinek) to gather mysterious artifacts and bring them to Warehouse 13 for safe storage. They quickly discover that each strange item has a story...and often the stories involve the supernatural, the extra-terrestrial, the fantastic, and/or the downright bizarre.
