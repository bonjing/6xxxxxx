plot info.
While on the way to Nimbasa City, the group comes across a trainer named Georgia who claims that 

she is a Dragon Buster and can beat any Dragon-type PokÃ©mon. Iris challenges her, saying that she 

is training to be a Dragon Master. Langley sends out her Beartic, with Iris afraid, but sending 

out Axew to fight it. Axew is easily beaten, and Iris sends out Excadrill next, but he will not 

obey her orders. Georgia taunts her before she leaves. As Iris tries to comfort Excadrill, he 

curls up into inactive mode once more. Iris tells Ash and Cilan that like long ago, this time, 

Excadrill was defeated by the move Rock Smash. She tells Ash and Cilan how she captured Excadrill 

when she first found him as a Drilbur bothering other PokÃ©mon in the forest around her home town 

many years ago. After she saved him after he nearly fell off a cliff, Drilbur became Iris's 

partner and trained under her, eventually evolving into an Excadrill and winning a tournament in 

her home. Drayden, a Dragon Master, tells Iris that he is impressed. She challenges him to a 

battle, and says it will be their 100th victory, and she wants it to be against a Dragon Master. 

He accepts her challenge, but when Excadrill fights Shaga's Haxorus, none of its moves appear 

effective, and he loses the match. Upset, Excadrill shut itself off from Iris and has not listened 

to her. Cilan says that it is not disappointment that is causing Excadrill's behavior but anger at 

Iris for forcing it to fight a match that he knew that he would lose. That night, Iris apologizes 

to Excadrill, saying that she did not try to understand his feelings. Excadrill listens in 

surprise, remembering how Iris never gave up trying to beat him, and her words of encouragement. 

He moves out of its inactive mode, but Iris is already asleep. Excadrill goes into the woods to 

practice its Focus Blast move, until Iris wakes up and sees it, deciding to help him master the 

move. The next day, Georgia comes across the group again after she has eaten their breakfast, and 

Iris challenges her to a match, again. With Excadrill's trust once again formed with Iris, and his 

newly learned Focus Blast, he is now an even match for Georgia's Beartic, but both defeat each 

other at the same time, resulting in a tie. Georgia, although upset, still claims she is a Dragon 

Buster. she tells Iris to meet her again one day in battle, and Cilan to prepare a better meal for 

her. Iris comforts Excadrill in the draw, saying it was a great battle. Excadrill hugs her, and 

she hugs back, saying that she loves Excadrill. In the end, Excadrill and Iris are once again good 

friends.
