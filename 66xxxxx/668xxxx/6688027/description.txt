The Allman Brothers Band
Washington, D. C. 11/12/10

OFFICIAL LIVE RELEASE [320k MP3]

This show at the magnificent Constitution Hall in our nation's capital showed why the Allman Brothers Band is a national treasure!  They say that when the ABB open a show with Mountain Jam, they mean business, and this show is Exhibit A.

After a blistering opening sequence, the opening set settled into a bluesy groove for a great run of blues tunes.  From 44 Blues to The Same Thing, any blues lover will be in heaven!  Guitarist Larry McCray joins the fun on That's What Love Will Make You Do, adding his own funky/bluesy style to the tune, and this version of Ain't Wastin' Time No More lives up to the title with an inciendiary performance.

The last few songs really put this show over the top, with overpowering versions of You Don't Love Me and Black Hearted Woman setting the stage for a reprise of Mountain Jam that wrapped the show up in a nice Mountain Jamwich!  How do you top that?  With Whipping Post, the greatest encore of all time, of course.

An absolute must-listen show, and a strong contender for show of the tour!
