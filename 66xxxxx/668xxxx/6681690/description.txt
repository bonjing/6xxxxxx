Instructor's Solution Manual (ISM) for "Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 5th Edition Extended" by P. A. Tipler and G. Mosca (c2004). For the extended edition (41 chapters). Solutions only (problem statements not included). Small bookmarked PDF file (19 MB).

Comment: Perfect for the 5th edition but will also be useful with the 6th edition of this txtbk (chapters numbered and named the exact same way in both editions).

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
