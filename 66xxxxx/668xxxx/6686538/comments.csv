I have my upload max set to 0 (unlimited) so I don't know what else to do. If anyone else knows, please help me out. I'd like to upload these torrents for you as fast as possible. Thanks! :)"

,watbol,2011-10-29T09:18Z,"To seed faster, under options/preferences there's
Bandwidth, and Queueing.
Set bandwidth/global number connections at 500
or so. and maximum peers at 500 too, and
number of slots at 70 or so, and check use
additional slots box.
Set Queueing/maximum active at 55 or so.
Hope that helps :)~
