The nfo file doesn't open, and the movie doesn't play.
Think this is the first time I've come across a corrupted upload here.
Not to worry, keep up the good work DownTYU."

I'm using the latest Combined-Community-Codec-Pack-2011-07-30 with Media Player Classic Home Cinema, and CoreAVC 2.5.1.
I was getting a blank screen, and the movie going straight to paused.
However, I cleaned it up using MKVmerge 4.9.1, removing the extra audio tracks, and all subtitles, as well as disabling 'header removal compression for audio and video tracks'.
For a second there, I almost installed VLC.
Sorry for troubling you, my mistake. :)
Thank you for taking the time to reply, promptly too."
