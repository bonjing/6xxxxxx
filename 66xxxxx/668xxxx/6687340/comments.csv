,arranger12000,2011-10-14T05:31Z,as maniak242 said.. any problems with track 11 Eagles. songs plays for 5:10 and then goes silent. if i drag is manually forward then another song plays. but only on manual drag and not automatically.
,arranger12000,2011-10-14T06:06Z,track 11 plays for 5:10 initially then is silent for 8:30mins and then plays again from 13:40 till end. and the track length is 19mins. well i like the song but find it strange. looks intentional.
,sniperkris28,2012-04-30T07:33Z,Thanks dude!
