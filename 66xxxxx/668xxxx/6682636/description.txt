This record is a wonderful surprise. Iâ€™ve long enjoyed guitarist Liberty
Ellmanâ€™s playing, having heard him both in the great Henry Threadgillâ€™s
ensembles and on his own recording Tactiles (which seem filled with promise not
quite realized). A fluid, clean-toned player with a very advanced rhythmic
concept and an ear for synthesizing improbable idiomatic combinations, Ellman
proves on this disc that he can flat out write.

His unpredictable, ever-wending guitar lines form the root of these pieces; but
they all bounce and shuffle and swing and funk, sitting at the intersection of
Threadgill, Steve Colemanâ€™s Five Elements, and â€“ yes â€“ Warne Marsh. Heâ€™s joined
here by an exceptional band, with saxophonists Mark Shim and Steve Lehman, tuba
freakazoid Jose Davila, bassist Stephan Crump and drummer Gerald Cleaver. The
two saxophonists place an intriguing stylistic contrast (roughly between
Shorter-like reserve and Braxtonâ€™s antic angularity) front and center, with the
separate axes of Crump/Cleaverâ€™s turn-on-a-dime and Ellman/Davilaâ€™s serpentine
linearity pulling in their own directions. The compositions are all about the
reconciliation of these momentums, not so much finding a common denominator as
housing them in elaborate rhythmic structures that still possess ice sculpture
brilliance. Hear this most notably in the discâ€™s title track, whose Very Very
Circus oomph is buoyed by some serious funk.

Much of the music indeed has more bounce to the ounce like this, but itâ€™s
neither slick nor one-dimensional. For example, on â€œYou Have Earsâ€ the
quirky-jerk arrangement of disparate lines and rhythms is both immediate and
brain-teasing (with Lehman and Shimâ€™s blue flames crossing back and forth). On
the coiled funk of â€œTarmacadam,â€ Ellmanâ€™s out-of-time runs are both slyly
subversive and marvelously apposite. But this is a far richer album than some
mere collection of grooves. Consider the ominous electric clouds of â€œSnow Lipsâ€
or â€œBorealis,â€ the aching ballad â€œAestivationâ€ (with an insanely expressive
Lehman solo), or the slinky noir â€œChromos,â€ whose counterlines and held tones
are perhaps the discâ€™s strongest moment.

Itâ€™s a fully realized statement by a wonderful improviser, composer, and
bandleader. A sure sign of improvised musicâ€™s vitality and passion, this disc is
a lock for year-end â€œBest ofâ€ lists.
