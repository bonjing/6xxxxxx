I gotta say I like how they kept the look of Gargamel as a typical villainous Jew like in the cartoon.  I figured they would have changed that up since they own Hollywood and ""wash out"" history's truths about Jews.  Bravo."

,looneycooney,2011-10-09T16:53Z,"Really can't see we would wait for a dvd-rip release, this one is just great ! Audio is great , video is how it should be...
a: 9 v : 9 m: 8 ( especially a kids movie offcourse) 

ps: ptv83 ...you probably have the wrong codecs installed or something, or a faulty vidcards , since this vid is just faultless by it's specs ...


Thanks for uploading this one !

,mw1987,2011-11-23T19:26Z,"A = 9
V = 8

Best quality vs filesize out there, with best codecs and settings used.

Why the 25 fps encoding on a 24 fps bd rip? Could have saved ~100Mib ;-)"
