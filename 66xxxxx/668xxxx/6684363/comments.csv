,ointment,2011-09-18T17:53Z,Perfect!!  Thanks
,Mayfoev,2011-09-18T18:44Z,"@GoodFilms and @others : If it is such a great film, why not buy it to reward Terrence Malick, Emmanuel Lubezki and the rest of their team for their work. I will never understand the looting of so fragile works, that have been so difficult to finance.. Blockbusters don't suffer from piracy. Fragile masterworks do."
,zmajcekBo,2011-09-18T19:38Z,"Looting. :D It's called torrenting, i.e. sharing."

,TYSeedRs,2011-09-25T12:31Z,"I dont understand Mastroka Video!!! It wont play on my PC with Winamp, VLC, DivX Player, Windows Media the audio is static on windows media classic Player and I cant convert the movie to any other format using media convert master. Is it PC hardware or software that I need, do I need to burn it to a certain disc. Why is Mastroka Video so useless to me? "

Matroska is a container format

You need to download a codec:-

Personally I use the k-Lite mega codec pack"
,ps2demierda,2011-09-28T11:52Z,"movie is weird, I'm retarded so I didn't get half of what was going on. nice to watch since the picture is pretty, tho."

,SergeantSpoon,2011-10-01T22:48Z,"Quality is great.
V - 9,5
A - 9.5
M - 9.5

Very orignaly shot, very well acted (even the kids). Very dreamy feel to it, but realistic plot.

Voice-overs could feel a bit emptey at times, but nice overall. Would still prefer it over not having it. 

One of the best movies this year. BUT be patient with this movie! Or you will not enjoy it, try not to skip scenes.

,musashi23,2011-10-02T13:54Z,seeeeeed damn it
,M1ck3yM1ck3y,2011-10-07T17:05Z,"Wow the quality is amazing!!!! I wasn't going to download such a large version, but I came here after a comment from one person in the 700mb version, and I think this was totally worth it. It took a long time to download, but the quality more than makes up for the wait. I can't even call it impeccable. The breathtaking visuals make the rip seem more than life-like!!

Thank you very very much aoloffline!:D:D:D This is an awesome upload!!"
,osoboso,2011-10-09T22:16Z,One of the most pretentious movies I've ever seen
,osoboso,2011-10-09T22:20Z,...and I liked the fountain
,kyp0001,2011-10-11T00:31Z,"I sadly did not like that movie. It was overall quite sad and motivated by sadness. 

For existentialism and purpose of life questions i can recommend ""The Man from Earth""(2007). Still Nr.1 in that kind of subgenre ;)"
,PublicSecrecy,2011-10-11T20:44Z,"I watched this film on my laptop while having a poo in the bathroom. I fell asleep, so I don't know if it was any good. 

The upload/quality seemed fine, though."
,lifx6,2011-10-13T22:20Z,WHAT THE HELL is wrong with this people who made this movie!!!
