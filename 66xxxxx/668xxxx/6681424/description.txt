    No movie plot , im too tired atm. But what i want to pay attention       
    here, is I did a proper rerip from another company dvd source, with      
    srestore, im pretty happy to give you people a perfect dvdrip. So,       
    how .. eh, about 5y late? This is how much i care about nukers nuking    
    a working release. You won't see a .repack. or shit from me within a     
    week from nuke, thats for sure. Thinking about older pre of this,        
    it's not dubbed, but the original theatrical italian was a dubbed        
    one, that was the italian way back then, and that got into iMDb too.     
                                                                             
    Nuke FiCO or nuke not, we are not going to stop. Cheers ;)
