Editorial Review from Publishers Weekly

Psychology professor and dog person Horowitz was studying the ethology (the science of animal behavior) of white rhinos
and bonobos at the San Diego Zoo when she realized that her research techniques could just as easily apply to dogs at
the local dog park; there, she began to see \"snapshots of the minds of the dogs\" in their play. Over eight years of study,
she\'s found that, though humans bond with their dogs closely, they\'re clueless when it comes to understanding what dogs
perceiveâ€”leading her to the not-inconsequential notion that dogs know us better than we know them.

Horowitz begins by inviting readers into a dog\'s umweltâ€”his worldviewâ€”by imagining themselves living 18 inches or so above
the ground, with incredible olfactory senses comparable to the human capacity for detailed sight in three dimensions (though
dogs\' sight, in combination with their sense of smell, may result in a more complex perception of \"color\" than humans can
imagine). Social and communications skills are also explored, as well as the practicalities of dog owning (Horowitz disagrees
with the \"pack\" approach to dog training).

Dog lovers will find this book largely fascinating, despite Horowitz\'s meandering style and somnolent tone.\"
