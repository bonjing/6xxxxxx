Xotic is more than just killing enemies. Players can compare their shooter skills with their friendsâ€™ on the leaderboards as they rack up chain combos by shooting targets like the life-choking Scab plants around each level, picking up Orb Essence, and, yes, blasting enemies. Balancing all of these elements while attaining the best time in each level is the key to becoming the top scorer. In their quest to become number one, players will also earn experience points that they can use to upgrade their skills and weapons and can pick up power-ups around each level.
