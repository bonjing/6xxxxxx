,schreckles,2012-03-26T05:32Z,"I'd be weary of PhoneMyPC in general. The dev team is extremely unprofessional and just generally childish assholes. A lot of users have been complaining lately that they're being spied on with PhoneMyPC. If you want it, though, definitely torrent and don't pay as the devs are pieces of shit, but I'd recomment Unified Remote/TeamViewer or any of the other free/cheaper remotes that work just as well (if not better) for Android."
,biocrono1000,2012-05-01T03:05Z,Team Viewer... It's free and works AWESOME
,Mav88DLC,2012-05-08T14:49Z,"Legit torrent, GREAT APP. Works awesome on Windows 7 64bit, + Droid X 2"
