@mumeet
I got no problems on my LED tv and no problems on my Samsung LCD series 5, maybe you should get a mobile video HDD or asus media player or something like that"

Update the firmware on your TV.  If you  cannot, then purchase a media box to be the interface between your files and the TV.  This will not be the last time you are going to experience this, since software is always evolving.  I would suggest that you buy a media box that can be updated to accommodate the ever evolving video/audio codes."

,Stonecon,2011-09-27T03:15Z,"I also have an lcd tv.  55"" LG.  I use the tv as my desktop monitor.  The tower sits on the floor next to my entertainment stand.  This way the tv plays anything my computer will.  I do have a problem with VLC not playing MKV files.  The video starts and it starts to blink in grey screens.  I downloaded a convertor.  Any thoughts on the VLC issue??"
