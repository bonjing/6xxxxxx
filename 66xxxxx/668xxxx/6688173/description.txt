The Allman Brothers Band
Boston, MA 11/19/10

OFFICIAL LIVE RELEASE [320k MP3]

The second show at Boston's Orpheum Theatre was a scorcher from beginning to end, with Bruce Katz adding a lot to the mix on keyboards on several songs.

Bob Dylan's classic Highway 61 Revisited made its first appearance of the tour, and fans got a double shot of Dylan with his tune Blind Willie McTell also being played.  This song has quickly become a heavy rotation favorite for the band, and their version is really coming into its own.  Sandwiched in between the two was a red-hot version of Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad, with Warren and Derek trading licks in a guitar lover's dream!

Bruce Katz really did add a lot, especially to Jessica and Desdemona, each worthy of being the centerpiece jam of a show.  Other second set highlights include Brother Gregory's stunning vocals on Desdemona plus the Muddy Waters tune "I Can't Be Satisfied," a tune from his upcoming solo album that has quickly found a home in ABB setlists. 

Add in a magnificent Les Brers and a stirring Southbound encore and you've got another great show in Boston!
