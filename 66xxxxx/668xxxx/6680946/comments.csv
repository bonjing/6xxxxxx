,.Bones.,2011-09-18T13:30Z,"Everybody, this works perfectly all you need to do is download and mount using Damon Tools(Google)
Then use the keygen for reason 5 included in the torrent and you have reason 5 free thanks mate it worked perfectly the only real free way to get reason 5!
Thanks King Of Pwm 
5 Stars trust this download!"

,Skibum42O,2011-09-22T21:55Z,"wow thanks a lot!!! ive been looking for a program like this its just what i needed, much appreciated! will be seeding respectfully "
,Tiddlyfisher,2011-09-22T22:18Z,Thanks for the program! Working great :}
,KBKILLA27,2011-10-02T05:35Z,@bones   alright so i downloaded it but i dont know how to mount it could you explain how ?
,some-young-guy,2011-10-04T03:18Z,"@ KBKILLA, you need to install a virtual CD-ROM software and mount the ISO image to it.  Daemon tools is good, PowerISO is another good find, both of which you can find on this site.

A virtual cd-rom drive is the same as a physical cd-rom drive except the virtual is only a program, but they function exactly the same.  Hope this was helpful."
,pierat9,2011-10-05T22:48Z,"Cheers ears, quality torrent"
,enyceBurns1,2011-10-06T11:04Z,ok so i downloaded and installed this but after i entered the company & license it asked for disk 5.in the folder it only has setup 1-4 so what do i do?
,enyceBurns1,2011-10-06T11:09Z,forget my last comment i read it wrong but it still wont oopen because it says to enter reaso 5 cd but i have everything installed already so i dont understand why it wont just open
,LordMarbury,2011-10-07T13:39Z,"@enyceBurns1 You need to mount the image using DAEMON tools or something similar. If you use ULTAISO or something like it,it doesnt actually mount the image. I had the exact same problem. Installed daemon tools lite and mounted the ISO file. Re-launced Reason and it found the disc. Follow these steps if you are using a program that doesn't actually mount the image to open the ISO. "
,TeRrAhMuZiK,2011-10-08T13:58Z,"Great upload, Great program, works perfectly once mounted. THANK YOU !!!!! "
,xxspade,2011-10-09T07:15Z,Don't understand how this works at all.  Not finding any ISO file anywhere in here and when I used the better torrent (from theLEAK) the mounting didn't work from Daemon Tools.  Someone explain what's going on.
,some-young-guy,2011-10-18T15:11Z,"xxspade, are you sure you have your torent client installed properly?  When I click the ""DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT"" icon, then past the ""OPEN WITH"" window, the only file available is called Reason 5.ISO.

Assuming you did properly install your torrent client, then daemon tools or Power ISO (or other) will give you the function to ""Mount"".  The ISO is a virtual CD-ROM that requires a virtual CD-ROM drive, i.e. Daemon or Power ISO.  Once the ISO is mounted, go to;
Start Menu/Computer/CD Drive (X:).  (X:) represents the letter(s) you assigned to the drive(s) that were created when you installed Daemon/Power ISO.  You will also notice that in that virtual drive that there is already a virtual CD installed just as if there would appear if you actually put a CD into your CD Drive.  Open it and locate the setup.exe and run it."
,some-young-guy,2011-10-18T15:13Z,"I also used to use Daemon, but recently it stopped working due to them charging for the devise.  If this be the case for you too, I suggest finding Power ISO here on TPB and using it, works exactly the same and I believe does other shit as well."
,some-young-guy,2011-10-18T15:15Z,"Everyone else, Im having a hard time with Reason and only because I found the owner's manual in 

C:\Program Files\Propellerhead\Reason\Documentation\English 

I was able to overcome some of my hang ups.  Any suggestions for mapping out a 6/4 drum beat in the 16 step button area in the Redrum?"
,some-young-guy,2011-10-20T00:41Z,"If not for free torrents, I'd be reaming a salesman's ass for this program.  I can plainly see that it is geared more towards a professional setup where you have a separate drum machine, separate keyboard, separate mixer etc etc and import those recordings into Reason.

When trying to create a beat in even 4/4, I am hard pressed to edit further than 16 notes per measure.  Any thoughts of a solution or better program?"
,thecurlinator,2011-10-20T17:48Z,"I did the following:

1) Download this torrent
2) Launch the torrent
3) Installing PowerISO and mount reason5.iso. I put  the extracted file in (F:).
4) Opening that file (reason 5.iso in (F:) ) and put all the files in a map on my desktop.
5) Run the setup.exe (that on my desktop is).
6) Opening my just installed reason.exe file
7) Using the keygen to get my validation-key
8) Opening reason.exe again

AND THEN
I got a window saying:

___

Please insert the Reason 5 DVD

Waiting for disc...

[Option: Quit ]

___

How can solve this ?"
,Kingofpwm,2011-10-23T17:42Z,"@thecurlinator
1:Remove your Internet connection, try install now.
2:Try another keygen.
3:Don't put the files on your desktop keep them in the ISO file."
,whb456,2011-11-01T18:48Z,"Let me explain the mystery as to why it is asking for the DVD, first of all all you need to do is keep the ISO file mounted until all is finished, it asks for the DVD so it can install the sound bank files, which are located in the ISO, once they are installed it will take you through a series of questions until the install is complete, then you can Unmount the ISO, and another thing i have been noticing people referring to, and that is that people referring to Magic ISO software, as the program that is used to mount the ISO, it is not Magic ISO that mounts the ISO, but it is called ""MagicDisc"" and this programs DOES work in mounting the ISO file, i have used this numerous times to install Reason. I do not mean to be critical to those who have no clue, but you should do your home work in the things that relate to the things that involves the computer, you do not have to have a degree in working with computers, I for one taught myself what i know about these things, and have built a successful first build in 2004, and have learned many many things on my own and with the help of forums, anyway, and one more thing i installed version 5 from my E: drive, and not the desktop."
,xtrchess,2011-11-02T06:38Z,"steps to install:
1. using a virtual disc program (magicdisc) mount the ""Reason 5.iso"" file do not unmount until further notice
2. once mounted open the virtual drive you should see several files including the setup.exe
2.5) lol shut down your internet access for your pc at this point
3. run the setup.exe this will install Reason 5 click finish when it is presented
4. find the reason 5 start up icon on your desktop double click it this will begin to load sound files etc onto your hard drive.  Eventually you will see the ""enter your lic"" popup leave it alone do not close it.
5. find the KEYGEN.exe in the virtual disk that is still mounted. Run the KEYGEN.exe it will pop up with a pull down that is pretty much self descriptive.  Once the key is generated it will be auto highlighted just control-c to copy it
6.find your reason ""enter your lic"" popup and control-v to paste it into the lic number box (i left the first two pull downs concerning name and corporation etc alone)
7 it will ask you if you want to register your product...the answer is NOT click the already registered button.
8. at this point it is installed and ready but there are some configs you can make for your audio card used, any midi keyboards you want to use etc. This is up to you - follow the product manual at this point.
9.You could unmount the virtual drive but i would leave it and mount it everytime you want to run Reason 5 just to keep the hassle down, turn on your internet access and seed the torrent as well as provide good comments...now...and don't be a selfish turd

@kingofpwm - thanks for the awesome application "
,Keenus,2011-11-06T17:27Z,"Ok so I mounted it and everything and even disconnected it but when i try to run the set up i get a pop up message saying:

,m4x420,2011-11-30T19:41Z,"@thom1818

I have exactly the same problem. Have you found the solution? Or does anyone else know how to figure this out?"
,marlinman630,2011-12-22T11:33Z,awesome! should you register when it asks you to? I didnt think it was a good idea to register it so I just hit register later for now
