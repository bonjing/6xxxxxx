What should i do?????"
,JakePirate25,2011-10-07T01:54Z,"Like what akcphp said, I'm having the same problem with Dreamweaver.

Is there another crack for this one?"

,zavir,2011-10-10T16:36Z,this is a trial version.
,1337chaos,2011-10-13T23:37Z,"It's not a trial version. If you move the DLL over to the directory, it cracks the trial into lasting forever. Every time you close and restart Dreamweaver, it asks you if you want to start a 30 day trial. Just restart the trial every time you load. Unless you keep Dreamweaver open for 31 days straight, you'll never have an issue."
,prdx07,2011-10-19T21:35Z,Awesome works great. thank you!
,bennyy04,2011-10-19T23:00Z,thans works perfect!! 
,skviper,2011-10-21T22:16Z,I downloaded this and everything seemed to work fine but then when dreamweaver gets to about 22 or 23% it gives me the blue screen of death. I have even tried it with the trail from adobe and it still happens. I have installed photoshop cs5 and that worked. Does anyone know how I could fix my problem?
,Kenny80,2011-10-23T09:14Z,"For everyone who dosen't know!

You are not suppose to supply a serial number, just pick trial in the installation and after it's done, replace the dll and you good to go."
,mozbius,2011-10-27T02:15Z,"I was getting tired of seeing the Demo warning every time that I would open Dreamweaver. So I went in c:\Windows\System32]drivers\etc\hosts and added :
127.0.0.1       activate.adobe.com
then used the serial from rajanu :
1192-1605-6787-9739-3936-2870
Looks like it's all nice and dandy for me now."
,sn6622,2011-11-02T12:55Z,"visit the given link:       ,wait for some  time and downed the zip file. open the zip file and extract one of  the amblit.dll file and paste in installation directory.
e.g.  C /Program files/ Adobe/Adobe Dreamweaver/ and replace the original one."
,almazrooei,2011-11-04T13:20Z,"Thanks for the download 
and rajanu
thank you soo much for the serial !"
,ianbrannan,2011-12-02T06:43Z,dont use persons stuff when asked legitimate questions he refuses to answer.
,Mr_si,2012-01-06T23:55Z,editing the hosts file and using that key worked perfectly. Thank you!
,babyfabiola,2012-01-07T11:34Z,"rajanu Your my hero

Thanks, thanks, thanks"
,skribent,2012-01-08T16:38Z,Thank you all - works just fine. From a danish copymist: A new religion in Sweden :)
,carlynn,2012-01-17T20:21Z,"I don't know what I can be doing wrong as I have replaced the ddl file and I still get that this is a trial and every day I have one less day till the trial runs out.  I have even replaced it more than once and it still will not work.
Any suggestions are welcome.
I am using windows 7 64 bit."

,tlg7312,2012-02-04T11:41Z,"@DaveDeez 

Thanks!

Guys do this...and it will work!"
,lmack002,2012-03-21T02:45Z,"Guys, please i need help. I had originally downloaded this torrent but then it expired. I then tried to place my dll into the directory like many of you are saying, but it doesn't work. I have a 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate. What can i do now? I removed and downloaded it like 2 times already but nothing works. It still asks for a serial number and the one that rajanu provided, doesn't work."
