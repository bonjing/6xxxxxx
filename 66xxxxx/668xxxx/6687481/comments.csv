,EndGenius,2011-10-30T04:31Z,"Installation instructions
(root not needed)
1) Copy the APK file you want to install to your phone's memory card in your Android phone.
2) Go to Android Market and search for Apps Installer or apk installer, i use""APK Installer"" by Graphilos, find one and install it.
3) Open it , navigate to the APK file and click on the Install button.
4) After it is installed, just open it like any other App. 
5) Stay 1 step ahead of the cops.

Works on HTC sensation, G1, wildfire"

,SpikeModZit,2012-04-21T11:05Z,"Ok, no idea why this is like this but if you want the app to install correctly, before you transfer it to your phone, change the filname. Remove the very last word and insert the "".apk"" file extension, otherwise your handset/device won't recognise it. I did it and that's confirmed on Samsung Galaxy Mini."
