,dassse,2012-01-12T02:39Z,"I can even understand people making piracy of software that costs thousands of dollars only to be outdated in one year... And giving companies huge margins of profit. 

But to share GTS videos that cost often less the 5 bucks and take months to produce by people like you and me... That's really ignorant!.. You guys will end up ruining the production of GTS videos yourself. You will be the end of what you say you enjoy so much.

Thanks but no thanks!.. I will buy all my GTS videos. It's one less beer at the end of the month. Can only do me good!

Now, do you have something worth pirating?.."
