,Hirudinea,2011-12-13T04:28Z,"In this shockingly bad, uninspired low-budget ""horror"" ham-fest, ditzy bikini girls and dorky jocks spend their time having boogie sessions (no, that's not a euphemism) on the beach, then being attacked by a lethargic, strangely man-shaped ""monster"". Failing to find its weak point (the zip up the back), they are ""clawed-up"". Cue the police, and more laughable dialog. Then a few more dumb things happen.
This supposed ""sexploitation"" movie has no nudity, and no other redeeming features either.
Not recommended. Possibly watchable for laugh value with the assistance of copious recreational drugs."
