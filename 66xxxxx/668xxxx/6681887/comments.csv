We all managed to download only about 30-50% of these season 2 episodes before you stopped seeding them all and now we're stuck:( Would you please seed the ""Supernatural.S02..."" torrents for another day or two until at least a couple of us are at 100%? I promise I'll keep seeding them for at least several weeks/a few months after I'm done downloading, I always do.

Thank you so much in advance and also huge thanks for all your great work, I love your torrents!:)
