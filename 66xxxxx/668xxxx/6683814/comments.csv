,Damien74,2011-09-21T10:01Z,"Serial works just fine.
Make sure to shut down internet during install. Which you should with most apps btw."
,techranjit,2011-09-21T12:05Z,"This Serial only works in the beginning ,if you restart your computer it doesn't work,it shows that this is expired application.the other solution for this is block the application with firewall.but suppose any point of time you uninstall your antivirus  or make any changes to your firwall ,again the same issue will occur.best solution is keygen ,if anybody has a keygen pls let me know???"
,Brad88,2011-09-23T12:25Z,"oh why oh why? ...... i disconnected my internet when i installed this and blocked it's internet access in my firewall, but when i restarted my pc .... kabooom! it's expired waaaaa .... is that a failure or the folder lock company got smarter? .... i've been using cracked folder lock since version 6.5.1 and this is the first time it happened :(( .... i cant use the provided serial anymore after that :(("

,lena7168,2011-09-27T11:37Z,block on the firewall
,techranjit,2011-09-30T10:47Z,"follow these Steps!!

uninstall all your folder lock appliction from your computer
clean your registry with c cleaner or any other registry cleaner
restart your computer
1)disconnet your internet
2)check your firewall setting and set it in normal or agressive mode .
3) Now insatll folder lock 7(dont launch)
4)now Connect your intenet
5)launch  your folder lock
6)yourFirewall will ask your permission to block folder lock or allow,you should block it permanently.
7)Thats it,It will work
8)In Future if you switch or make any changes to your antivirus firewall ,you again get the expired notice,so make sure your firewall is blocking this application always!!!"
