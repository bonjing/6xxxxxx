My thanks to the original seeder on Demonoid where the full ISO can be downloaded. 


I have selected the better tracks and tagged them and split the ISO into tracks for professional Video Discotheque or VJ use.

Well done to the original seed for keeping the quality as original, a rare thing these days were everyone seems intent on compressing video's to within a pixel of there very existence. 

Mostly all 2.4:1 screen ratio but some full 16:9 Widescreen so there is hope yet that America will get the picture and realise than NO ONE uses CRT 4:3 screens in Bars, Clubs and public places in EUROPE any more sigh...

There are a few surprises in this lot and some excellent fresh new music.  Enjoy.

Rigmar Radio uses OtsAV Pro, the Professional choice.
