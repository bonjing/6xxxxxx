Great audio, but like any vid of this size, there's some video artifacts. Overall very good rup. 

One note: I don't know who did the subtitles for this but they're awful. English must be their 3rd or 4th language. Examples: spoken ""and love is smiling through all things""/ subs: ""And love to sonrrie through all things"". Spoken ""he died when he was 19""/ subs: ""he died when I was 19 years"" Talk about totally changing the meaning and context of a line. Spoken: ""she wants to get back together"" / subs ""He wants us back together"". Since a middle-aged man is saying that, it's easy to infer that he's talking about his estranged wife. The subs make it meaningless. That was all in the first 15 minutes. The whole movie is like that. There are mistakes almost every single line. They don't even say what's on the screen, it's almost all reworded (poorly). Every few lines they just skip a line and it doesn't show up. If you need subs for this film, look elsewhere. "
