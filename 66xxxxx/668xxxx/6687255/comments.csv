,yoashmo,2011-09-19T22:48Z,"@ spectra13  
im pretty sure that is not the correct imdb link. same plot and such but not the right movie.
according to imdb this movie is called 51 and the link to that is http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629439/ 
thought the plot is the same."
,yoashmo,2011-09-19T22:59Z,"@spectra13
thats not the right imdb link. according to imdb this movie is actually called 51, not Area 51.

@Tyrm77
i dont know what that crap is your peddling. but either way it has nothing to do with the movie except the title. but like i said above this movie is not even called area 51.

anywho the correct imdb link is here http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629439/ 
its the same plot, and seems like the same movie just another remake of it, as spectra13's link."
,piratepobe,2011-09-19T23:03Z,"i believe this is the syfy tv movie, not the oren peli area 51."
,The.Norse.Crown,2011-09-19T23:08Z,I saw this movie on Syfy once... Time I will never get back. It was horrible.

,pxpierre,2011-09-20T05:30Z,".BONE, there is NO ""Area"" in the title of this movie. Please take down the torrent & start a new one with: 51.

Kinda bait & switch IMO as the real ""Area 51"" (2010) was great."
,negativethree,2011-09-20T11:05Z,Thanks!
,ayleycat,2011-09-21T01:05Z,thanks bone great as usual!
,csabaxb,2011-09-21T17:34Z,"Something is not good, i downloaded 51 and Area 51 from two separate torrent, and it's the same movie ! ???!!!"
,LarryInColumbus,2011-09-25T07:53Z,"yoashmo is correct.  This is a SyFi ""made for TV"" movie named ""51"".  Low budget and all the crap that goes with it (Extra Cheesey).  Yoashmo's IMDB link is accurate Also."
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-09-25T12:04Z,"This movie is totally shit. Don't waste your time, I couldn't even finish it is was that bad..."
