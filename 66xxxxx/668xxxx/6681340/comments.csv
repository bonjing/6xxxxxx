,gylgamesh5000,2011-09-19T09:37Z,"When you look at the list of the files, it shows you some of the parts are bad."
,stupidcorn,2011-09-20T00:36Z,garbage. what a waste of time. 
,gadriam,2011-09-28T08:32Z,"So much download, so few viable bytes... 

Why .rar? What's the fucking point of making .rar archives? It saves a few bytes in transfer, doubles its size on the HD and maximizes the fuckup-potential. QED."
,Mr_Gamer,2011-10-22T08:48Z,"As I've understood it (this could be Internet Lore), Torrent and RAR go hand in hand. Downloading several smaller files is faster than one big one since the chuncks are better suited for download. This should not be taken as truth though. Secondly, the files are in small portions because the original packer is not always the releaser, and having several RAR-files is a good way to both send it (usually via FTP) as well as for the releaser to do a CRC-check. If one file is damaged, he just downloads it again instead of downloading the whole enchilada. So try to understand this from the packers and releasers point of view. But it is true, this torrent HAS 0-byte files. So why scenebalance even released it is a mystery."
