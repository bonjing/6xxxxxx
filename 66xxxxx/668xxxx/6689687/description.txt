Fuduntu Quarterly Release

The Fuduntu quarterly installation ISO image (14.11) is now available for immediate download.  As with all Fuduntu releases, this release continues our tradition of small incremental improvements.  It is important to note that existing Fuduntu users will roll up to this version through the normal update process, and do not need to download or install from this media to benefit from this release.  This release is considered the first official Fuduntu 'rolling release' ISO.
Major updates included in this release:
Linux Kernel 3.0.3
Chromium 13
Flash 10.3.183.7
VLC 1.1.11
This quarterly release also includes a roll up of the latest patches.
