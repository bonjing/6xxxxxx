The foremost guide to the design of environmental control systems
Updated and expanded

For more than seven decades, Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings has been the preeminent teaching and practice reference for building environmental control systems. Now this classic text has been updated and expanded, and continues to help prepare generations of students for their careers in architecture, architectural engineering, and construction management, and to supply professionals with inâ€“depth information to assist them with their decision making in practice.

With over 2,200 drawings and photographsâ€”more than 200 of them new to this editionâ€”the Eleventh Edition covers basic theory, preliminary building design guidelines, and detailed design procedures for buildings of all sizes, and also provides information on the latest technologies, emerging design trends, and updated codes.
