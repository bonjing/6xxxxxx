[V],smbdownload,2011-09-18T15:40Z,well looks like the FLAC snobs are at it with the negative ratings - I personally love FLAC - and use it often - but the fact of the matter is that most people DO NOT and WILL NOT - so why not share in the format that people want and take the care to make them sound as good as you possibly can within the confines of MP3 [which I know I do] - if you don't want MP3's... it's simple don't download them - there are many other sources for FLAC if that is what you desire....peace
,zoso5150,2011-09-18T21:07Z,Rock On!!
