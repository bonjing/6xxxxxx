,Oxygenus,2011-09-20T07:36Z,Is this working ?? pls tell me :)
,Hezkore,2011-09-20T08:33Z,"Nope, doesn't work.
It tells you to connect to the servers once before being able to play offline.
And you can't make a new account and you can't use the account that comes with it."
,Oxygenus,2011-09-20T08:42Z,Thanks :)

,VaiDuX461,2011-09-20T16:56Z,"says that ""youre conected from different pc""
some asshole is still conected and can't' let anybody to connect now, i think (he's playing connected and forgot to start offline at second try, because ineternet is not needed when conected only first time)"

,N4N4KI,2011-09-21T01:14Z,"@AlcatrazSVK well then you are a dumb fuck cause the hosts file is just a text file without a .txt extension.

this method (editing the hosts files) is used for lots of cracked software to prevent the program phoning home (i.e. photoshop)

I don't even understand how you would get a BSOD after editing your hosts file unless you did something really wrong (lets face it editing a text file is not hard)"
,ArizerXion,2011-09-21T02:39Z,"Can we hack that we can create profile too, but offline? and like TMUF? thx"
,anujeith,2011-09-21T08:49Z,"hey sniperwarrior . i need your help pal

and then i reinstalled the game but it doesnt work , it says      cannot connect to the server  (12029)
  ... i dont know what am i doing wrong ,, any help would be highy mattered :) thanks"
,SunKaz,2011-09-21T09:23Z,Where is that 'folder with the profiles' ?
,N4N4KI,2011-09-21T09:55Z,"@anujeith

You need to select ""play offline""

with this release you cannot play ""single player"" as that needs you to be connected to the server, 
however you can play by yourself on the 1600 included fan made maps by choosing the ""Local Play"" option and then choosing ""solo play"""
,AlcatrazSVK,2011-09-21T10:17Z,"N4N4KI, shut the fuck up. I'm not that stupid In these stuff, but when I saved it, ran the game my PC froze. I tryed to use CTRL+ALT+DEL, nothing... Then I reseted the PC and it showed me BSOD and reseted again, then the PC ran normally like nothing happened. If you think im stupid, I am not stupid in these kind of stuff, but I'm stressed out and can't think straight at all, I'll try it again, but i would rather buy it..."
,anujeith,2011-09-21T10:34Z,"@N4N4KI when i open the game it says cannot connect to the server (12029)
then after 2 options oppears , to stay offline and to connect online , when i select stay offline it says choose your profile . after i select my profile it says unable to load trackmania canyon  you must connect once to mania planet server to activate , aquire or update this title , then after selecting OK it says cannot install or update its title files and after hit Ok . it says this title isnt playble "
,N4N4KI,2011-09-21T10:38Z,@AlcatrazSVK well go fucking buy it then and stop complaining on a pirate message board.
,N4N4KI,2011-09-21T10:41Z,"@anujeith you need to find wherever that profile folder is and delete it, 

I had no such issue as I blocked the exe from accessing the internet before I ran it for the first time

sorry I cannot help further."
,VaiDuX461,2011-09-21T11:46Z,"Nope... doesn't work, still geting same message. Done what sniperwarrior said."
,Legacy301,2011-09-21T12:04Z,Trackmania 2 Canyon is Awsome
,mcmanic,2011-09-21T12:32Z,"works fine here, thanks"
,AlcatrazSVK,2011-09-21T13:06Z,"N4N4KI, where did I complain? Tell me where? I only said my problem and you start to talk to me like I am your bitch or something, chill... If you can't help, then shut up..."
,hamdocar,2011-09-21T13:10Z,thanks man.. works great..
,ArizerXion,2011-09-21T13:25Z,"Thank you, but I download in other mirror.
It's work, when I open by trackmaniaca profile.

Btw...

Can we hack that we can create profile too, but offline? thx..."
,sniperwarrior,2011-09-21T14:54Z,"After re-installing, when it says Trackmania 2 Canyon is trying to connect to the internet, there you have to cancel it, so that windows prevents it to connect to the internet every time you launch it.

To do it manually, go to,
Control Panel\Windows Firewall\Allow a program or feature through windows firewall\

Make sure that you have deleted the profile folder. By default, it is in your user documents."

i removed the game....

ok so, sniperwarrior said, go to system32, drivers, etc, host. i open host with notepad and i kopie the words u said and past it in the host file at the end of the line.

Instal the game again...

when the setup is around the 98% it gives some russian errors. and then i can't run the the game anymore, after uninstal, reinstal still same prob and now i did systemrestore and have back the old game.

"".dude""
Listen guyz,no need to complain!
Atleast something is better thn nothing..

For those who cannot get it to works,follow these steps:
1.remove ny previous installatio using a good uninstaller.
2.reinstall the game.
3.run the game.(if u r using windows 7,ur firewall automatically asks whether u want to allow it to connect or not,so just cancel it)
4.in configure-- select single profile.
5.press on advanced-- go to networks tab..uncheck (check internet connection)
6a. Remember DO NOT CREATE OWN PROFILE, use the russian profile you see already.
6.play the game.
SOLO and Multi would not work..they require an internet connection.

You can only play Local-- campaigns. 

I also did the firewall block of the exe and the hosts file edit."
,sputnikwood,2011-09-29T02:07Z,"follow these directions, also do not create new profile, use the profile thats already there:
