A HANDBOOK OF EGYPTIAN RELIGION
BY
ADOLF ERMAN
WITH 130 ILLUSTRATI0NS


THE volume here translated appeared originally in 1904 as
one of the excellent series of handbooks which, in addition to
descriptive catalogues, are provided by the Berlin Museums for
the guidance of visitors to their great collections. The handbook
of the Egyptian Religion seemed especially worthy of a
wide circulation. It is a survey by the founder of the modern
school of Egyptology in Germany, of perhaps the most interesting
of all the departments of this subject. The Egyptian
religion appeals to some because of its endless variety of form,
and the many phases of superstition and belief that it
represents ; to others because of its early recognition of a high
moral principle, its elaborate conceptions of a life after death,
and its connection with the development of Christianity ; to
others again no doubt because it explains pretty things dear to
the collector of antiquities, and familiar objects in museums.
Professor Erman is the first to present the Egyptian religion
in historical perspective; and it is surely a merit in, his work
that out of his profound knowledge of the Egyptian texts, he
permits them to tell their own tale almost in their own words,
either by extracts or by summaries. His pages are particularly
free from theory, and no theory is needed to enga, oe our
attention when the facts and views disclosed are so attractive.
The author has written a special preface for the English
edition, and has modified one or two points in his text as
regards the degree in which burnt sacrifice was customary. A
few of the illustrations that were in the original have been
omitted, and their places taken by others. Mr. Hilton Price
has especialiy to be thanked for his generosity in lending blocks
employed in the catalogue of his collection.
