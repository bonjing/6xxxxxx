[V],phatwarez,2011-09-21T01:43Z,"I wrote all your requests down. I'm still having sync problems with the games i've recorded, evidently the fix I applied for beta2 encodes refuses to work now, i'm looking for other ways to guarantee audio sync."
,chong67,2011-09-21T02:38Z,Thank you.  Went to bed thinking the Falcons going to loose.  So I am downloading this to watch.  Thanks phatwarez!
,DaBears37,2011-09-21T09:28Z,Thanks for the effort! I don't even care if the audio is out of sync =)
,nik09,2011-09-21T13:46Z,"The Audio out of sync wasn't a problem for me last week, played in VLC.
Dunno if it's the same problem now, but saw some comments on that last week.

I don't care if some seconds off if that's the problem."
,Romoworld,2011-09-21T15:58Z,"these are great games but do u have the Chiefs vs Lions game, that would be greatly appeciated if u could put it up."
,lifes_been_good,2011-09-21T17:27Z,"Please create Week2 Browns @ Colts .... 

Week 1 was great ...

Thanks so much in advance!"
,MasterEro,2011-09-21T18:20Z,"Great job on uploading games man. I've been following you since last year. 

Personally, I mostly follow the games of Miami Dolphins, Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots and since they don't show NFL matches in the country where I live in, I would really appreciate it if you could try to upload some of their matches ^^."
,PGaither84,2011-09-21T20:54Z,"I will seed any Patriots games you upload. Thank you for this and keep up the great work!

I played Week 1 Patriots at Dolphins in VLC Media Player and everything worked perfectly."
,youngdst,2011-09-21T21:20Z,"Your uploads are awesome....i would absolutely love the Lions vs Chiefs game. I saw it was already requested. Once that's up I will definitely seed all the Lions games you post. Thanks again! It is much appreciated for us ""displaced fans""!"
,flubflub,2011-09-21T21:48Z,"This and your week 1 Dolphins torrent were my first ever sports torrents. Fantastic quality, good job. Again, VLC player played both files perfectly, if that's of any use to you.

I'm a Dolphins fan who can't access any of their games, so another polite request for Dolphins games, please! :)

Top torrenting!"
,nogard1070,2011-09-21T22:40Z,"Thanks as always. I agree with the comment above about the audio. It is not a big deal being out of sync, especially with VLC. Just want to watch the games. Steelers' game as always. Thanks again."
,thebvan,2011-09-21T23:00Z,Any chance you'll be uploading the Bills/Raiders game?
,nik09,2011-09-21T23:11Z,"We are all hitting refresh search ""nfl"" on TPB 300 times every day waiting for our games.
We all want them, and know that Phatwarez will deliver :)

If he wants the torrents perfect, I understand.
He is a BEAST when it comes to NFL torrents, and has a good rep. 
Why put out torrents that has some audio quality when it can be fixed? I understand !

We know the games will come soon, and they will all be perfect!
Just gotta wait a bit, and try to avoid spoilers from the games xD

[V],phatwarez,2011-09-22T03:36Z,"Thanks for all your interest. I'm re-installing Windows for the third time now due to another dead hard disk so there is gonna be an extended delay.

Again if anyone has any TYT logins I can repost some games in the meantime while I work on this."
,nflfan,2011-09-22T08:59Z,"Hi phatwarez

Firstly, well done for persevering. It must be very frustrating. You've got more patience than me.

Secondly, I personally think the sync issues should be sorted out before uploading, especially if the sound comes before the pictures.    

Unfortunately I doubt if you'll get any TYT logins here. Most of us have either had our TYT accounts disabled or can't sign up. That's why we're looking here.

Good luck!

,nflfan,2011-09-22T10:43Z,"Also, as Nik09 said, please avoid any spoilers, even comments that may not be but could be construed as such, like chong67 above. Thanks. "
,lifes_been_good,2011-09-22T16:56Z,"take your time, phat. we all understand if you're having computer problems.  

we can all wait for the high quality work you offer.
"
,99jay88,2011-09-22T20:12Z,Any other week 2 torrents coming? Hoping for the Broncos Bengals game
,99jay88,2011-09-22T23:01Z,Sorry for my comment Phat.  I hadn't read all the other comments first.  Good luck with your technical issues.  And THANKS for posting football games.  Our family REALLY appreciates it.
,Manila2011,2011-09-23T21:54Z,Thank you a lot phatwarez for all the NFL posts! Good luck with your computer problems.
[V],phatwarez,2011-09-24T05:38Z,"I'm waiting for new hardware to arrive. Once I have a working PC i'll be able to continue work.

,DaBears37,2011-09-24T13:18Z,"Is there still hope to get week 2 games when you get your new rig, or are those lost?"
,eduardo5525,2011-09-25T05:54Z,"thanks for all the effort! i don't care when it goes up, so long as you can get em uploaded. i'd love to see the cards v. skins game if you've got it"
,nflfan,2011-09-25T09:48Z,"Hi phatwarez.

Hope you're able to fix your various problems.

Personally I think week 3 games should now be the priority. Texans@Saints, Giants@Eagles and Packers@Bears look great match ups and would really be appreciated.  "
,nflfan,2011-09-26T16:24Z,"Jets@Raiders and Falcons@Bucs look good match ups too, but obviously this looks like a very lengthy interruption. "
,jowalls69,2011-09-26T21:54Z,I like to thank you for games you are putting on and hope your computor is up soon so we can get games we miss
,PGaither84,2011-09-26T23:40Z,"Thanks again phatwarez. I look forward to the rest of week 2 and week 3 games. I really enjoyed Week 3, and the Match ups for week 4 looks really good."
,j4z278,2011-09-27T06:29Z,"Hi Phatwarez,

I really appreciate you getting these games up, i live outside the states and this is the one feasible way of me seeing these games and following my team.  You make my life better. "
,egghandz,2011-09-29T13:33Z,"Cheers for making the effort to put these up, hope you're back in action soon. Looking forward to seeing the week 3 packers@bears game ;]

God speed sir!"
,PGaither84,2011-09-29T17:12Z,"Just like j4z278, I live outside the USA now and this is the only realistic way to watch the NFL and my teams."
