,fillinthisspace,2011-09-20T10:40Z,"Sorry, my already slow internet connection has been running like a dog since I uploaded this so it's taking a while.
Mind you.... I've uploaded nearly 900MB of a 450MB file and I'm still the only seeder. I'm not sure how that works...."

Excellent job keeping these torrents alive mate. Will seed and hope others will do the same. Thank you for the near-instant upload as I'm following the dates of upload. So far..

Keep up the good work. 

Seed Guys!"
