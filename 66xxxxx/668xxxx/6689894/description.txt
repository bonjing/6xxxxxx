Explore the rich verdant beauty of the wettest spot in North America. Enjoy the first jewel drops of dew dangling on fern fronds and refreshing mists of cascading waterfalls. Watch salmon spawn in streams that flow through one of the most beautiful, temperate rainforest valleys on Earth. Fill your world with the sounds of birds, frogs, squirrels, and flowing waters. Sink into the sublime stillness of the mystically lit forest floor to improvisations of Eric Satie's Gymnopedies as interpreted by master musician Raphael Sharpe.
