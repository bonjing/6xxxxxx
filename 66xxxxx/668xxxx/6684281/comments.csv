,J.R.3,2011-09-18T14:28Z,You skulled pussy. This is the one from the guy who taped it with his IPhone. Lazy ass mother fucker who just re-uploads what others have done. Grow a fucking pair for once.
,Popas13,2011-09-18T14:53Z,"No credit to the original pirate?  A non skull who took it upon himself to be the first on the net?

tisk tisk tisk.

The quality is better then you would expect from a phone, but not really good."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-18T15:44Z,"J.R.3: I downloaded it from a scene site,so just shut the fuck up,grow up!"
[T],Calypso127,2011-09-18T16:38Z,Thanks Brother!

[V],.Dude.,2011-09-18T16:50Z,.
,MASSIVEclouDs,2011-09-18T17:55Z,"It's bitter sweet. The quality of the picture off an iphone was surprisingly good. However the the 2 chairs and the constant drifting of the camera cutting off most of the screen and the missing audio, pretty much dampers the overall quality. The movie was good...but unfortunately hard to watch. Future note...iphones are great bootleggin cameras."
,phoenixcomm,2011-09-18T18:57Z,"Ok, on the video = dude did not zoom to fill the screen, looked like it was done on a phone.
audio = some missing, not bad
Qual = 2.5/5 watchable though fast dl "
,pinzmoo,2011-09-18T19:26Z,"ya this source shouldn't of been used, I can see wanting to push this movie out first cuz whoever does will most likely get mobbed by downloaders but give me a break I can see exit signs and 4 rows of theater. this source should of never been used.

On the bright side, cams are normally blurred and or out of focus having the camera zoomed this far back takes care of that problem looks pretty good... o ok looks like he fixed the 4 row problem but now I can see 2 tiles of the ceiling.

vid 5 cuz shots not synced to size
aud 7
movie ? dont know not watching this source."
,jahnee,2011-09-18T20:21Z,"lazy ass mother fuckers get your own source, this is one shit crap recording with the chairs blocking the view, gtfo and record your own shit"
,fragomatic,2011-09-19T03:17Z,"Audio quality 5/10.
Video quality from 2.5/10 to 5/10.

The cam starts out at 5/10, you can see the seats, the walkway, the EXIT sign in the cinema. The camera man has to hide the camera between 2 seats to film the movie so the quality falls to 4/10 and we can't see 35% of the image because of 2 seats blocking bottom left and bottom right corners. Eventually, the camera man is filming the sealing because he is busy watching the movie. The camera man does not use a tripod. Watchable but of extremely poor quality."
,burt64nyg,2011-09-19T03:28Z,Thanks .Dude!
,creffield,2011-09-19T04:01Z,IT IS THE SAME AS THAT M4V CRAP. DUDE IS A FAG!!!! GO SUCK YOR MOMMY'S DICK DUDE
,altonina,2011-09-19T05:32Z,"THANK YOU for putting this out there for others to download. Thanks to your efforts I do not have to:
wait for the DVD or pay for the movie ticket...
download any more fake encrypted torrents that scatter suspicious files around my hard drive or... enter personal information into form after form trying to navigate out of some chump maze of coupon offers successfully so I can watch it online for ""free""""!!! Most of all I don't have to waste my time anymore...I AM HAPPY...TU!!!"
,sopark4000,2011-09-19T08:09Z,.dude Thanks for uploading but honestly you should have at least credited the original uploader/pirate
,bokeatong,2011-09-19T09:19Z,"Video: 3/10
The video is not cropped. You can see the theater and for the better part of the movie you see seats in front of the movie.

Audio: 4/10
The audio is low and for about 5  minutes of the movie there is audio loss. In some parts its really hard to make out what is being said.

Movie: 4/10
The concept is good, but it was poorly executed."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-19T11:05Z,"sopark4000: Go check my other uploads,i do give credits if i really nw who it belongs to..but in this case,i took it from a scene site and just copied the whole info.Nothing else was mentioned,is that my fault?

creffield: Better lick your mothers cunt b4 commenting on my torrents,asshole!"
,Pelce,2011-09-19T14:16Z,"Don't Bother Down Loading This Movie!!! The Copy Is A {C O N T A G I O N}!!! I Wasn't So Bothered By The Beginning Of The Movie, When You See The Theater Chairs. The Copy Got Even Better When The Screen Was Centered. The Bootlegger Then Gets The Bright Idea To Move Closer To The Screen & Record Between The Seats!!! Now The Picture Is In A ""T"" Shape Because Of The Seats On Both Sides Of Him/Her!!! I Was STILL Dealing With It!!!  The Camera Then Gets Lowered So ALL You Practically See Is The Theater's Ceiling For A Good 10 Mins Or So, But The Clincher For Me Is When The Sound Drops Out For OVER 10 Minutes!!! I Had To Take The DVR Out Of The Player & Break It!!!! ENJOY THE SHOW!!!!"
,sansyeux,2011-09-19T17:58Z,is there a rip of Drive[refn] around?
,ChasUGC,2011-09-19T18:18Z,"This seemed like it was going to be a decent movie. But, this crappy rip is going around. Sheesh. It's a disgrace to pirated movies. Shots between the seats and 10 minutes of missing audio! Who uploaded this crap, the RIAA? Good way to discourage, thats for sure, Best idea yet. lol."
,never2ool,2011-09-19T21:26Z,pya niger shite
,jtnewhou,2011-09-19T21:37Z,"I found this copy watchable especially since I have been waiting two weeks for a copy to come out.

Yes you have theater seats in the way. Yes it isn't cropped.  Yes the sound drops out for about 4 minutes. And yes there is a few minutes missing in one spot.

But honestly given the type of film that this is with little to no action sequences, I didn't mind.  Watching this copy wasn't any worse than going to the theater in person.  Thanks to whomever had the guts to film it."
,luisfatal,2011-09-20T01:05Z,"Que raio de treta é esta? até se ve as cadeiras do cinema...
já vi coisas más, mas como esta nunca...
