,bil_gr7,2011-09-17T09:15Z,"Its plot is similar to fast&furious 3. You know with all the ""After an accident at an illegal street race, he is sent to a small town to live with his estranged father"" stuff."
,yazz00,2011-09-17T09:21Z,looks like a crappy fast and furious wannabe

,tufactor,2011-09-17T10:39Z,"Are you guys fucking serious? Have you seen this guy's name? ""AngryJap""? Clearly he's a fucking troll, and he's probably not even fucking Japanese you imbeciles.

Good job getting this shit trolled out of you, now shut the fuck up."
,tr99tr,2011-09-18T00:30Z,shutup you bellend heads an tell me a/v
,celtqueen,2011-09-18T00:44Z,"the movie is (as yet) unrated on IMDB, stars American tv actors and, i think, it's a straight to dvd release...this should give you some hint as to the quality of the movie. as for a/v quality of this actual rip, if these idiots would stop the pissing contests for their countries, we might find out.  by the way, ""angry jap"" was banned from tpb for his inflammatory comments and has now signed in with a new screen name, starting the same ole shit. don't be stupid and let him incite a ""riot"" - he's trying to control you and appears it's working.  duh"

,xXNnNXx,2011-09-19T07:24Z,"This is an AWESOME movie, nothing to do with fast and furious... By the way, this movie was written WAY before tokio drift and they needed sposors for funding. I reccomend watching it and buying the DVD when it comes out in your area because this is not the typical commercial thing we have polluting cinemas nowadays.

,sopark4000,2011-09-19T08:04Z,"While I appreciate the effort of the uploader, this movie is absolute fucking garbage. This is essentially a shitty low budget version of the fast and furious movies and those movies also fucking suck sooo yea that should give you an idea.

,Dexter101,2011-09-20T14:52Z,"I haven't watched this. I dont care what people say about this film before I watch it.
Thanks neonrainbow. :)

I've just read the first page comment.
LOL.
all you racist Americans really can talk shit.

I dont get it, why would a person just started commenting with Japanese bullcrap.?
and proudly telling everyone that you are a red neck??
dude, u definitely need a black shrink. :p"
,red989,2011-09-21T03:47Z,"Americans are racist? How does that even make any sense? America is a country not a race you ignorant fuck. 
America is one of the most culturally/racially diverse countries in the world. Don't get pissed off just because your green card application got denied."

,supersteve2345,2011-09-22T04:12Z,The 2 main guys look like total retards lol 
,ashen77,2011-09-22T20:32Z,"red989 your a moron. having been to the USA a number of times, and to dozens apon dozens of other countries, i can say that the USA is the most racist place ive ever been to. Its fairly obvious, as you all have to categorize each other with terms like *afircan american* or *irish american* even though theyve never stepped a foot on either the continents or the countires.
All the yank bible bashers seem to think that Jesus (if he existed) was a white guy, rather then a dark skinned Jew, which he clearly would of been. i could go on and on and on, but I'm boring my self here."

,camo12345,2011-11-02T21:08Z,"America is full of racists! More racists than any other country!! 

You rednecks haven't evolved as much as the rest of the world... I guess that's what Big Macs do to the brain"
,ahadafzal13,2011-11-27T05:49Z,gud print
,Philonetic,2011-12-21T21:07Z,"@ashen77
I believe you mean ""you're"", you know, the compound of you and are.  Not ""your"", which is possessive.  Furthermore... it's upon, not apon.  It's African, not afircan.  Countries, not countires.  Rather THAN, not then, a future tense.  And ""would have been"", not ""would of been"".  Stop trying to sound things out.  Didn't you maybe notice the wavy red line underneath all of your misspellings?  If you can't respect a language enough to use it properly, then don't fucking use it, ignorant peasant. "
