Although I just converted these from CD for you they are ancient 78rpm
era phonograph recordings preserved for you - although a couple of the
shorter tracks are barely audible and you have to wonder if you should
bother keeping them, that said it was an era when folks were more 
romantically inclined, had better ideals and notions of family commitment
and showed more feeling in their singing too.

So for those that still care and are devout fans of perhaps Ireland 
greatest Tenor back then too, here you go!

The CD is called "Come back to Erin" and we have a bonus track on here
for you "Moonlight and Roses" to better show off the talent of this great 
man

enjoy and cheers!
