Connect your phone and copy accross the two directories, 'apk' and 'igo', I used the card root, and that worked nicely, so best to follow? These two are 2.3GB so you wait awhile!
Then use your favourite on phone file manager to navigate to the 'apk' file in the 'apk' folder. Install using app manager, and as I said, worked spot on twice for me. No cracks, no serials, easy!"
