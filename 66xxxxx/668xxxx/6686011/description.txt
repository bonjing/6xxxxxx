Radical Theory/Critical Praxis:
Making a Difference Beyond the Academy

"Drawing on their own experiences of seeking to ground radical theory through critical praxis, the contributors vibrantly explore the role of the academic in society; the relevance and meaning of 'making a difference' beyond the academy; the relationship between academic praxis and activism; and the neo-liberal threat to enacting certain kinds of critical praxis."--Publisher's preliminary webpage.
