        |   SSERC, the Scottish Schools Equipment Research Centre, has         |
        |   combined its collection of science and technology graphics from    |
        |   15 floppy discs onto one CD. This has enabled the graphics         |
        |   collection to be offered in all of the formats which were          |
        |   previously only available as options: Draw, text-to-path, sprite,  |
        |   and DXF. The graphics are also provided in Vector libraries for    |
        |   use with the 4Mation application, Vector. In addition, the CD      |
        |   contains composites of circuits and experimental set-ups, a range  |
        |   of BASIC programs and utility applications, sample logged data,    |
        |   and collections of molecular models produced by the SSERC Chemical |
