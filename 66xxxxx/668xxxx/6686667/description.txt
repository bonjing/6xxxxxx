As with Transformers: The Game, Revenge of the Fallen features two separate campaigns; one depicting the actions of the Autobots, and the other the actions of the Decepticons. The game expands on the movie plot with additional missions and characters. Unlike its predecessor, Revenge of the Fallen features a hub-like, non-linear mission progression. This allows the player to choose what missions they would like to accomplish and where in order to further drive the story.[2] Multiplayer features five different modes. \"Deathmatch\" allows players to choose any character in a free-for-all battle. \"Team Deathmatch\" features Autobots vs Decepticons. \"Control Points\" features gameplay similar to the Star Wars Battlefront series, with teams battling for control of specific areas to gain points. \"One Shall Stand\" is similar to Team Deathmatch; the difference is that the objective is for a player to take out the enemy leader (Optimus Prime or Megatron) while protecting their own. The final mode, \"Battle for the Shards\", features Capture the Flag-style gameplay; teams search 
for shards of the AllSpark and return them to their base to earn points.[2][3].
