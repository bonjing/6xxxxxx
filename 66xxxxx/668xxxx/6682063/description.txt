***I know the film is not available outside the DVD Region 2 area, but that needn't stop us from going to amazon.co.uk and buying the DVD, even if we can't watch it on our current DVD players. Please consider it; think of all the nice new suits Benedict could buy with our cash! Plus, the quality of this is less than perfect. It has had a hard life, ripped and uploaded and downloaded and spliced and uploaded again. All the more reason to buy the DVD!


BIG BIG thanks to Danielle (http://danflan.tumblr.com), who was the one to actually rip the DVD and get it out in the open. I'm just the idiot who spent the day yelling at my computer until I managed to trick it into doing the things I needed.
