 THE TREE OF LIFE IS OUT ON BLURAY.....
   PLZZ DO IT I CANT WAIT DYING TO SEE....."
,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-08T06:29Z,"Mr. YIFY....Love your collection & obviously, you're an expert at blu-ray compression....But I think this particular movie needs a bit more MB....The outline of the animated characters are somewhat fuzzy & fraying....Same goes for your ""Mad Max"" collection....It, too, needs a bit more MB...However your Chaplin Collection is absolutely EXCELLENT!!!....Aaanyway, I give this a ""V"" rating of 7.5....Certainly watchable but the visual aspect is below DVD quality...."
