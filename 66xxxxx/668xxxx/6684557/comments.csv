,amartya61,2011-09-23T10:27Z,What's the matter.. Torrent - 1080 bt description 800..?????
,MrDude645,2011-09-29T09:12Z,"@amartya61: this torrent is 1080p but due to the 2.40:1 aspect ratio of this movie, the vertical resolution has been reduced to 800 to save data. there's no point using data to encode visually useless black bars into the top and bottom of video, it's much better to use the freed space on better quality for the remaining video."
,Daiichi1,2011-10-18T11:25Z,"Bad torrent, fist of all, hard coded swe sub, not only that, the sub sucks realy bad, not done propperly, second, the audio is out of sync at some points during the movie, third, the screen goes blurry some times during the movie too. people are better off with another torrent.
