,fuckjews,2011-09-28T22:25Z,thanks for the upload
,emonemo777,2011-10-31T01:18Z,"umm you should probably download a ISO maker, (powerISO, UltraISO, ImgBurn, or ISOTools), and then copy the disc file into the ISO program, and then upload the resulting file as a torrent. This works a lot better than installing the program and then uploading the EXE.. because the EXE needs everything else, and, once instaalled, will ONLY work on the device that it was installed on."
