its a sh!tload of swearing to be editing out

,pirateman2,2011-09-19T12:39Z,"yeh, I wouldnt wanna download a movie that has been censored and/or looks out of focus, anyone that has downloaded and watched this movie, please come back and comment on the A/V quality and censorship."
,scottsasse,2011-09-19T18:35Z,"Yes please, somebody come back and say if this copy has all curse words removed. Uploaders should have their skulls revoked for failing to mention such a travesty!! Never got a bum torrent from .BONE. before and he marked his as an R5. Yesterday I downloaded .Dude.'s mis-labeled and poorly Censored piece of shit copy of what he claimed to be a DVDSCR, needless to say, it was an unwatchable gross disappointment!!"
,scottsasse,2011-09-19T19:07Z,Oh and you can't tell from the sample because all the cursing in the movie starts at the point where the sample ends:(
,explorerfreak,2011-09-19T20:57Z,skipped through the whole thing.....totally censored.  WTF??
,explorerfreak,2011-09-19T20:58Z,yes.....censored to death.
,Tanlic,2011-09-20T04:03Z,"Instead of fuck you get ""uck"" which is a bit annoying but well worth a watch. Dempsey at his very best. Thanks for the upload"
