This is dr. Neal Barnard's amazing video lecture Breaking the Food Seduction (2003) where he explains the hidden reasons behind our maniacal food cravings and how certain food can be as addictive as any other drug. Why is it so hard to resist the temptation of chocolate? Because chocolate triggers the release of natural opiates in the brain. Cheese also releases mild opiates during digestion - no wonder we crave it. Barnard helps you understand and overcome your food cravings. He explains which foods "hook" us the most and why, and what to do to break free when you want to decrease the calories and fat that accompany these seductive foods. Cheese, for example, is about 70 percent saturated fat and has more cholesterol, ounce for ounce, than a steak. Barnard offers seven steps to breaking your food cravings and presents guidelines for healthy eating using vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains. Find out what triggers your food cravings and how to finally get rid of them. 1h long. A must see for everyone.
