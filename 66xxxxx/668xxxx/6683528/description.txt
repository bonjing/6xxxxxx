'There's a room here for everyone, Doctor... even you!'

The God Complex co-stars David Walliams and is one of the Doctor's scarier adventures, 
featuring eerie ventriloquist dummies, the Weeping Angels and a monstrous presence 
stalking endless hotel corridors...

The episode is written by Toby Whithouse (School Reunion, The Vampires of Venice) 
who told us, 'I'm thrilled with it. It's my third Doctor Who and it's the one I love 
the most, by far. It's beautifully directed by Nick Hurran - a genuinely wonderful 
piece of work. He's imbued this bland domestic setting with genuine terror and creepiness.'
