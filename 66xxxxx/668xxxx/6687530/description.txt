    Over at the castle of Countess Dominova, swinging couple Bill and        
    Lisa have just checked in. They've "made it" all over Europe and have    
    decided that a spooky old manoractually the rundown set from a        
    rundown horror moviewould be the perfect place to continue the        
    physical expression of their love. Naturally, the minute they settle     
    into this moldy old abode, goofy ghoul stuff starts happening. Bill      
    is raped by a trio of she-demons (he doesn't put up much of a fight).    
    He also witnesses the Countess shape-shifting into a Count. Of           
    course, the big surprise comes when the perplexed paramours want to      
    leave. Instead of allowing them to check out, their scantily-clad        
    hostess demands they take part in a Black Mass sex party that's so       
    perverse that Anton LeVay would denounce it as "disgusting." All Bill    
    and Lisa wanted was an atmospheric place to gyrate their genitals;       
    what they got instead was Terror at Orgy Castle.
