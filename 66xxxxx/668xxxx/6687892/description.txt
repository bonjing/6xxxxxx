Hymn to Life is the second solo album by Timo Tolkki. Unlike the first one, Classical Variations and Themes, Hymn to Life does not present Tolkki as a fast and classical heavy metal guitarist, but as a diverse songwriter. The album deals with Tolkki's personal beliefs and thoughts about life and encourages the listener to believe in him/herself. Despite some song names, Tolkki uses strong criticism against religions.
