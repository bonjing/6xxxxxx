Enter the weird and wonderful realm of legend in Oddly Enough: Piped Piper, an enchanting hidden object adventure that puts a quirky twist on a classic tale. For hundreds of years, the story of the Pied Piper has ended with the rat catcher luring the children of Hamelin out of town, never to be seen again. Oddly Enough casts players as a wayward traveler who agrees to rescue the youth.

To reach the foreboding tower in which the piper is holding the children ransom, players will interact with memorable characters and complete quests that open new areas. Deciphering mind-melting codes, repairing bizarre machines, and cooking up strange concoctions are just a few of the tasks that lie ahead. Along the way, players will experience a new kind of hidden object gameplay that challenges them to find the pieces of essential objects. Packed with compelling puzzles, masterful mini-games, and stunning design work, Oddly Enough: Pied Piper leads players down the path to a satisfying casual gaming experience.
