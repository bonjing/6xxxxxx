Check it out:

It is one of the worse movies ever made. Producers splashed cash on a total insult to most people's intelligence. Do yourself a favor, this movie is not worth your time! You might be better off staring at a white wall for a couple of hours. The humor is absolutely horrendous, most of the actors are as bad as it gets, screenplay is non-existent, directing... suicidal. It starts off by being simply boring, but when they try to be funny they just miss every time and go from bad to worse. They try to copy some American comedies, but without any luck. Alex tries to build this gangster attitude but fails, this second-hand actress Whitney Anderson proves why she is not yet famous and Dragos Bucur just put a big stain on his CV. I haven't seen the end as I could not bare the ordeal any longer, but somehow I know I couldn't have missed much. Apparently Romanians are much better at creating cinema art, rather than entertainment.

;D"

Not because it's Romanian (although I'm sure that didn't help), but because it's managed to distill the worst aspects and stereotype in Hollywood comedies and use them like it's the recipe for success. All in all, it's more than a waste of time, it's an abomination and you should thank the uploader that it save you the ticket money and the horror of being stuck in a movie theater while this giant turd fest was on. Also, last two commentators, eat shit and die."
