Future History finds Jason Derulo moving seamlessly from ultra-sexy urban dance tracks to poppy love songs, once again offering up a unique genre-blurring blend of varied sounds deeply rooted in pop. This time, production is handled by The Fliptones, including the first single and instant summer anthem Donâ€™t Wanna Go Home as well as hitmakers J.R. Rotem, Frank E, The Dream, and Eman.
