320k(musicfromrizzo)

Rod Stewart has done a fine job with more conservative traditional hits
in his Great American Songbook series - here they are all complete 
volumes I through V so "the best of" this series is inclusive as that
goes without saying of course too. enjoy this great singing from a mature
artist that's been around for quite a while now (since my days in high school
back in the 70s wow!)


enjoy these fine older song selections done more recently
by Rod Stewart here for you!
