Product Description: This Second Edition of Modern Electrochemistry 1 includes everything that made the First Edition a classic - rigor, clarity, and completeness - but it has been thoroughly revised to include: - the modern theory of ion-solvent interactions - new methods for determining transport numbers - room temperature liquid electrolytes - computer simulation and new spectroscopies, and - an updated bibliography. Problem set, explanatory diagrams, derivations of equations, and appendixes make this book an excellent undergraduate text and a useful reference for professionals.
