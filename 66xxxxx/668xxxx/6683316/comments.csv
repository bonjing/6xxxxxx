I ripped these off the internet right around when it first came out so some of these episodes had different resolutions.

1 and 2 - 854 x 480
5 and 12 - 416 x 304
Everything else - 720 x 480

There not the greatest but keeps the size small and easy to seed.

I believe there is HD dvd rip here:

but it looks dead.
