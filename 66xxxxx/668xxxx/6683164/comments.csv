,DarthPS3,2011-09-19T02:57Z,"I am downloading this right now and have the following question. Are there hardcoded subtitles for the few alien language parts in the films?
As always, thanks to the uploaders and the seeders."
,Gatepc2,2011-09-19T21:42Z,Excellent torrent thanks! Will be seeding.
,rgmontejo,2011-09-20T13:35Z,Seed pls!  I'll seed after...
,NeegroJohnson,2011-09-21T00:53Z,Guys don't download the new transformers because as soon as its done friggen paramount will send a complaint to your service provider and your internet will be cancelled 
,SkyMason,2011-09-21T07:18Z,"I download Transformers 3 about a week ago and nothing happened. Maybe it was just that one link you went to. Go here for it. https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6646695/Transformers_3_Dark_of_the_Moon_2011_PPVRIP_IFLIX

Some of the comments say that the quality is bad but I've watched it and there's nothing wrong with it that I can see. Sure there might be better ones, I haven't seen any others so I can't say for sure but this one has, from what I can tell, has good video and audio. And I'm kind of picky because I have vision and hearing problems. If I can see and hear it most other people should."
,xseyss,2011-09-24T03:57Z,thanks. much better than the chinese version (in both resolution and subtitles included)
,rhsjr7,2011-09-26T07:40Z,"What's w/ the seeders? I always seed for a few days; at least, after I get something so huge. Please be Kind and Seed."
,rgmontejo,2011-09-27T07:04Z,I guess there's something wrong with all Star Wars torrents coz whenever I start downloading them transmission and vuze stops working.
,demonicpanthoen,2011-09-27T08:09Z,"will seed for aslong as possible, thanks for the upload!! \m/"
,Arthur75,2011-09-27T14:18Z,How come this torrent is so slow ????
,davidvb,2011-09-28T18:41Z,"@SaM
Another excellent torrent, thanks!

@NeegroJohnson
stfu moron. I've downloaded hundreds of movies and have yet to receive a letter or get my internet canceled. Stop trying to scare ppl and go back to your dick-sucking job at Dreamworks. I'll send you some knee pads."
,drumber42,2011-09-28T23:37Z,"@davidvb

Chill dude, sometimes torrents can get tagged, and if you download it you do actually get a letter from your ISP or the production company itself. NeegroJohnson could be lying but he's probably just trying to warn people, what could he gain from people not downloading someone else's torrent?"
,BlueBrown,2011-09-29T01:18Z,"The download is slow because there is over 10x's as many Leachers as Seeders, duh."
,chefgeek,2011-10-02T03:18Z,"For those worried about letters from ISP ect on any movie download, install Peer Block, or an older version Peer Guardian2.  I had problems in the past with getting internet shutoff due to downloads, but since installing, not a single issue.  Do a little research, Google will show you the way. or you can download from: http://www.peerblock.com/releases"
,kal442,2011-10-02T21:53Z,Can you guys please seed these for a bit after
,Richdick77,2011-10-03T17:47Z,"Great quality, just doesn't have the alien translated harcoded subtitles."
,Polymathj,2011-10-07T03:19Z,"I've got a few letters from Comcast over the years.  I installed Peerblock but really, it's just a warning.

Now back to my D.S. job at Dreamworks.

I can't believe I've been outed by @davidvb, man with the worlds smallest functional penis."
,moldybudz,2011-10-09T18:07Z,"@Polymathj: That's because Comcast has a cap and actively works to analyze the traffic running over their network from high downloaders. Comcast sucks. Read up on their history with torrent traffic and you will know I speak the truth.

I recently moved from Comcast to FIOS. What a difference. No cap, no BS, and 5 MB/s downloads. Yes, Mega BYTES, not bits.

Peerblock is great though. I run that all the time. For downloading movies, though, I signed up for ipredator VPN service. Downloads are slower, but it gives you piece of mind since all traffic running over the VPN is encrypted. I use it whenever I download movies. Especially big name movies that are more likely to get tagged by ISPs or movie studios (such as this one)."
,VWheathen,2011-10-09T23:58Z,Come on people please seed. 
,gamerluke7,2011-10-18T02:20Z,Where would I be able to find the deleted scenes and stuff?
,disimagery2,2011-10-22T08:00Z,"are these the theatrical or extended versions...
anyone who knows please respond.

ps - can also use jdownloader and get new movies via ddl [direct download] sites; you are not part of a torrent swarm - you download directly from a secure server - is where most of what you get here comes from first...good luX!"
,hostage24,2011-10-23T18:02Z,I wish some would would seed this torrent! I have been downloading for two weeks now. I thought we were supposed to be sharing on this site?

,RogueRoger,2011-11-11T00:03Z,Can we get some comments about the quality? It is taking days to DL and wonder if it is worth it. I will be seeding this if it has quality.
,menotiko,2011-11-24T04:25Z,MKV? Yeeaaaaannnnnnnnnoooooo.....no
,mexicowpants,2011-12-05T22:44Z,"This has got to be the slowest goddamn torrent in the entire bloody universe. Over a week now, and still not even one of the movies has completed. Don't be tightarses, SEED for a while after you've downloaded. Uncap your upload speed, and don't try D/Ling and U/Ling too many torrents at once."
,jake2593,2012-01-30T22:39Z,ok people. you can download this right. but you wont take the time to seed. you non seeders are stingy and should b kicked off tpb fo real.
