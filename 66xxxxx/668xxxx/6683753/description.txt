Civilization V Trainer v 4.1.2 for Civilization 5 v 1.0.1.348 ..by DelphiUniverse

-------------
4.1.2 Changes
-------------

* Will now reduce cpu overhead while trainer is waiting for
  Civilization to load.
* Turning off hotkeys will now properly terminate keyboard
  polling and reduce cpu overhead accordingly
* Will now remember and save the state of the sound checkbox
  and keyboard button to Settings.ini so that you don't have
  to change it manually
* Added hotkey for shutting down the trainer, use ALT + F12 to
  remotely shut down the trainer. If sound is enabled you will
  hear a dropping sequence of notes played. If sound is disabled
  the trainer will quit immediately.
* You no longer have to minimize the trainer in order to lower the
  priority of the trainer. Now it will lower priority as soon as
  the window loses focus and restore priority when it gets focus.
  Civilization will also get high priority when trainer loses
  focus and idle priority when trainer gets focus again.
* Changed default value of resource hotkey inside Settings.ini from
  80 to 500.
* Changed defalt value of Modifier from 50,000 downto 10,000 because
  the old value gave way too much gold income, a lower default value
  is definitely better and more healthy
* Sometimes when running the trainer, some controls would be graphically
  corrupted, appearing teared or missing graphical parts. Will now update
  the client area if needed during startup.
* Reduced size of about & quit buttons
* If sound is disabled in Settings.ini it will not load midi libraries
  anymore, saving alot of memory and lowers amount of threads. Will now
  also unload midi libraries when unticking the sound checkbox. Midi
  libraries and functions takes up a few megabytes of memory. So if you
  want to save a few megabytes of memory, turn off sound.
* Removed / simplified some code

WOW64
-----

WOW64 is an emulation software layer that emulates x86 applications on 64 bit windows.
Some people report problems when running trainer using this layer, but I can confirm
that this trainer works flawlessly on win32 platforms.

About Trainer

Installation
------------

1. Create a new folder anywhere you like.
2. Extract archive into that folder.
3. Done.

----------
How to use
----------

Start Trainer or Game in any order you like

--------------
Run Priorities
--------------

Here is a detailed description of how the trainer manages priorities, both on the trainer and civilization:

When trainer is Un-Focused:  Trainer gets a very low priority and Civilization gets the highest priority setting.
When trainer is Focused: Trainer get normal priority and Civilization gets idle priority.

---------------
Switched Cheats
---------------

BEWARE: Always turn off switched cheats before making another turn. ALT + BACKSPACE will quickly turn off all switched cheats.

1: MOVEMENT SWITCH:
This cheat gives unlimited movement points to units. Set initial movement points in the editbox, this is not necessary as it already is set to a good initial value.

2: EXPERIENCE SWITCH:
This cheat gives experience to units. Set the experience value you want in the editbox then click your units you want to apply this value upon, one after another. You only need to click them once, you can also scroll quickly through all units with the arrow buttons.

3: HEALING SWITCH:
This cheat will set health points on your units. Set the health point you want in the editbox on the left side (it can be in the range of 0-10 where 0 is no health and 10 is full health) Then click all units you want to set this health value upon.

4: CITY MODIFIER SWITCH:
This is probably the most complex cheat to use. (It's really not that complex). This cheat will set the city modifier value (it is in percentage %).

It will set the modifier value on 3 things: Production, Science and Gold. To have this cheat work you will need to buy OR sell a building that affects any of these 3 areas. Thats it.

Quick hints: I recommend buying:

University	(to enable modifier for science)
Factory		(to enable production modifier)
Stock Exchange	(to enable gold modifier)

You can also sell buildings that affects these areas, the modifier will update that way too.

UpDown Controls
---------------

I have added Up-Down controls to all edit boxes in the program.
You may change values in an edit box in many ways:

1: Click a button to choose a predefined value.
2: Click the edit box and type a custom value.
3: Click the up-down control buttons to change values.
4: Use the up-down arrow keys on your keyboard.
5: Use mouse wheel to change values.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Q1: Trainer doesnt work?
A1: Use only with Civ 5 version 1.0.1.348. It will not work with other versions.

Q2: Trainer still doesnt work?
A2: Your firewall/antivirus blocked it or sandboxed it. Unblock it, shut down trainer and restart it again

Q3: Trainer is still not working?
A3: The 6 primary cheats will only update after you click a city or any operations that updates the display

Q4: I use WinXP and the trainer runs and quits almost instantly?
A4: Try to run it using Win98 Compatability mode.

Q5: The trainer is running with very high cpu activity, why?
A5: The keyboard polling routine is responsible for this, it will be lowered to 0, 1 or 2 percent cpu usage as soon as the trainer window loses focus. This is nothing to worry about. Read "Run Priorities" further up in this readme for more information about this.
