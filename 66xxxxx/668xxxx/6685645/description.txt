There are a couple of local affairs that stand out in the npower Football League this week. 
In the Midlands, Nottingham Forest take on Derby County. Forest, now managed by Steve McClaren, 
missed out on promotion through the play-offs last season, while Nigel Clough's Derby have made a 
very good start to this campaign. Meanwhile, it's derby day in the capital as West Ham cross the river 
to meet Millwall. This fixture last took place in 2004, a game won by Millwall by a single goal. 
Manish Bhasin presents.
