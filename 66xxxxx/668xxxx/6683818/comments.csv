,hycker,2011-12-06T22:25Z,"Well, ok.

After installing I would follow the steps above, but When I Execute ""Licgenertaor.exe"" it returns a black cmd without any code. Help?

@maddogx it's a program used for building flowcharts and simulating those. U can also transfer the flowchart into a PCB drawing."
,hycker,2011-12-06T22:33Z,"nvm, works just fine. 
The suggestions appeared after hitting my keyboard  with a few (like 23) numbers.

Thnx for upload :D"

,rndprnd,2012-01-29T16:42Z,"If you are having difficulty: make sure that LicGenerator.exe is being run from a location that it has privilege to write to. This is because it writes the .lic files to the folder in which it is located. For instance, if you are on a system with UAC, it will need to be run as administrator if it is located in C:\Program Files. Also, I placed the files in Program Files, and I had to run multisim.exe as adminstrator the first time. If it is not working, try this.
Also, thank you, very nice torrent."
