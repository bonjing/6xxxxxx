I got a Collussus card 12gig ram , capture using Arcsoft software captures into .ts in HD but file is like 12 gig big but excelent quality , best way ive found to compress is  the .ts is using AVS video convertor makes it about 2 gig in size but lose the quality wat do u use plz bro ?"
[T],shemyaza,2011-09-20T21:16Z,"@seedbag: Your .ts files are just plain old mpeg2 files boet. Convert as you would any DVD to .avi or mp4. Your masive file size could be due to capture settings but for HD it is about right. AVS is good for SD, just tinker with the settings. For HD it will be ~ 4 - 7 gig. "
