,Insomneac,2011-09-17T01:42Z,"Could someone who has this please answer the following:

Does the Reloaded installer create start menu and desktop shortcuts?

And does it create an uninstaller?

Reloaded's latest ones only just extract to an install folder, which I can do with WinRAR."

It just says ""Install the game.""

That means you install it normally. With a ""cracked installer,"" they always tell you you need to use their cracked installer to enjoy the game."
