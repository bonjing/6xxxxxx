Generally the ""contents"" of the new update zip files are merged with the existing ROM zip files... to produce a new updated ROM. Are these already merged like that? Thank you for clarifying before I mangle the entire collection lol! And thank you very much for your hard work, btw... very much appreciated, you've inspired me to once again update everything :)"

This means that update zips are full romsets (split/merged to be precise) including all roms, not even added/changed ones. So nothing more than described three steps is needed to use them (ClrMamePro is not needed). Zips which names are no more used/are renamed, are included as zero size files, which allows, after replacing original ones, to simply identify and delete them, again without need of ClrMamePro."
