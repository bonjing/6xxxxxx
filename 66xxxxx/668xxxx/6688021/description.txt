Plot: Ditte (Lene Maria Christensen) owns a gallery, has a loving boyfriend (Pilou AsbÃ¦k) and her dream job in New York is within reach. But Ditte is also the youngest generation of the famous bakery dynasty, Rheinwald, and when her beloved, but dominating father (Jesper Christensen) comes down with a serious illness, Ditte is faced with the grueling decision: To pursue her own dreams, or to continue the legacy of her family. A Family is a moving and modern story about complicated family ties, the new wife, the new kids - and about following your dreams to find your own place in history. (IMDB)
