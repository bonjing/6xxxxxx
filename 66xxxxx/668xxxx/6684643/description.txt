"Free as a Bird" is a song performed by The Beatles. The single was released on 4 december 1995, as part of the promotion for the release of The Beatles Anthology video documentary and the band's Anthology 1 compilation album.
The song had been written and recorded as a demo by John Lennon in 1977.
Paul McCartney asked Lennon's widow Yoko Ono for any unreleased material by Lennon, and "Free as a Bird" was chosen as being the song in which all three remaining Beatles could be involved, as they could finish the arrangement and write extra lyrics.
