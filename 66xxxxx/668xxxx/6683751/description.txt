Another of Max's many media projects, this one airs on Iran's Press TV.

In this edition of On the Edge, Max Keiser interviews Danny Schechter from Newsdissector.com. He talks about the President Obama's jobs bill, how the media is covering the domestic economic crisis and the large protests expected this weekend on Wall Street.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
