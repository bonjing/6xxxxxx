,TGOD_ROB,2011-09-19T05:33Z,what kinda download is this
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-19T05:37Z,"it's an iso file which is archived in rar files.

Meaning you will have rar files, and you use http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6595354/WinRAR_v4.01_x86__x64 to extract them. Then you will get an iso file and if you have an xbox and have burnt games before, you will know what to do, if you haven't you might want to look up a tutorial or your gonna screw up your xbox."
,TGOD_ROB,2011-09-19T05:42Z,okay but why is it only 4.1 gb theres another one up thats like 7.3 ??
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-19T05:50Z,"It's compressed really good! If I'm not mistaken, when you extract it, it will go back to normal size 7-8GB...

Basically it's made smaller so people can download it and share it faster but the actual thing in the end is gonna be the same size. :)"
,TGOD_ROB,2011-09-19T06:17Z,aight mate are u gonna have gears of war 3
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-19T06:33Z,"Well you see, not all game ISOs can be compressed that much... 
But I'll check it out, if other people don't upload it here on TPB, I will... 
Don't worry, you'll find a copy either way, and thanks for the comments, hope you seed."
,TGOD_ROB,2011-09-19T14:48Z,how do i seed mate and is there any other web sit where i can download torrents ??
,TGOD_ROB,2011-09-19T15:51Z,and this is a working game mates download took no time
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-19T17:41Z,"see seeding means sharing the file with other so they can download it as well. Basically you don't close utorrent or stop the torrent even after it has finished downloading so it will show that you're upload speed increasing and that means you're uploading [sharing the file with other people].
You can always not seed, and leave the torrent after you finish, But that isn't fair and I wouldn't recommend it."
