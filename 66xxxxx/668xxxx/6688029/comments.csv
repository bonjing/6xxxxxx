You'll need Daemon Tools Lite to mount the ISO, or some other form of ISO mounting software. Ignore the cracks already in the ISO and go about the normal installation process, then follow the Instructions.txt"
,garycooper,2011-09-20T02:07Z,great up thanx Seclude
,The4X3R,2011-09-20T06:18Z,"great one, thanks"
,GamerKnows,2011-09-20T16:24Z,"This doesnt work for me. It installs but when I click the exe after patching and copying over the crack you said to copy over the game doesnt launch , but the EXE is running in task manager."
,Seclude,2011-09-21T02:58Z,"This was made with Windows 7 x64 in mind. Make sure that you're running it with admin and ensure that DEP is disabled for that particular executable. Make sure that you're copying it to the proper location. 
Souldrinker's EXE should go to the Sierra/Homeworld 2/bin/RELEASE/ folder."
,munkman,2011-09-23T02:47Z,"Disable DEP? I've downloaded hundreds of games and you're saying that only yours requires an essential service, which protects windows files, needs disabling? FUCKING SERIOUS? Smells like virus..."
,Seclude,2011-09-23T06:00Z,"If it crashes on startup with a BEX error, that's generally related to DEP being retarded about something. I can ensure that there's no virus in this torrent, and I've had it verified by the administrators."
,tonebag1,2011-10-24T21:13Z,"Works like a charm...no virus here.

Just make you you copy and paste the contents inside the ""souldrinkers fix"" folder into the ""release"" folder
The ""release"" folder is located in the ""bin"" folder

:)"
,kyleb63,2011-12-16T13:47Z,"I can't get the DEP to stop blocking it. It installed and patched fine and then I copied souldrinker's exe over the original one, and I added an exception in the DEP for the new exe, but it still won't work. When I run the new exe it looks like it's going to launch, i.e. screen flashes up black like it's going into a full screen program, but then it just cuts back to the desktop with no error messages. It does this wether I have DEP enabled for it or not. Anyone else had this problem?"
,EWSULL,2011-12-23T05:43Z,I am having the same problem as kyleb63. Ive installed game ran update copied fix exe into release folder. Im not mounting the image i just burnt it to dvd. And im running win7 64 bit. I installed it on my laptop with win7 32 bit and it ran fine. But the that laptop blows. I would much rather play on my desktop. Please help. Dose it just not run on 64?
