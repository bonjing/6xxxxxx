Deleted/Extended Scenes: In total, there's about an hour and a half of deleted footage, almost all of it new. Worth noting is that the deleted scenes previously included on the DVDs is not included here, so you might want to hang on to those if you're a completist. It's clear that instead of trying to be comprehensive, the focus in compiling this material was to bring as much new footage to the table as possible. And there's some great, previously unseen footage here. For the prequels it's mostly in the form of rough animatics and generally unfinished sequences, but the original trilogy includes several alternate cuts and excised scenes that we be of real interest to fans, including Luke's trip to Tosche Station. (No, we don't see any power converters.) Additionally, all the film footage has been scanned in 1080p.
