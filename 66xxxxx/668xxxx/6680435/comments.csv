Which, BTW, people prefer better, since they don't have to keep a rarred version for seed + unrarred to watch, and use x2 double harddisk space. Most people will soon delete the rarred version and the torrent will have less seeds, and soon less popular content will just die due to no seeds.

Feel free to post links on my torrent and tell people that there's a rarred version and there it is *link* instead of flaming people and talking stupid."
