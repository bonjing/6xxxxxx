The frustrations of raising a child can lead parents to discipline by shouting, shaking, or spanking, behavior that all too often escalates into abuse. InJoy's all-new Positive Discipline series shows parents a different way. Using real life scenarios, this video contrasts harmful, reactionary parenting with more effective, positive-parenting techniques that are proven to be healthier for kids. After watching this program, parents will be able to put these new skills into practice and bring harmony into their homes.
