Finally a proper scene release by SKIDROW for â€œDeus Ex: Human Revolutionâ€. I think itâ€™s definitely one of the best games in 2011 till now, i really enjoyed playing this peace of art because it do aim for something good and gives you the option to choose in everything even the end of the game youâ€™ll be the one who decide it knowing the consequences of each ending. The game was developed by Eidos Montreal and published by Square Enix. Enjoy!
