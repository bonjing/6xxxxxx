[V],.Dude.,2011-09-19T03:31Z,"Fixes:
- We have addressed various issues that can occur for players that would result in â€˜stutteringâ€™.
o Stutters that are the result of graphics driver shader processing are now removed or significantly reduced.
o Stutters that are the result of data streaming have been removed or significantly reduced.
o Performance has been improved and made more stable on dual-core systems. This could previously also result in stuttering.
- Fixed issue where some players couldnâ€™t complete the Motherly Ties side quest.
- Fixed an issue where doors in Omega Ranch sometimes wouldnâ€™t open.
- The TYM medical card should no longer fall through the table if an NPCâ€™s body comes into contact with the card. Players already stuck in this area will need to revert to a previous save before the card fell through.
- Occasional hangs for some players during video-playback have been fixed.
- A crash on startup when running DX11 on a single-core CPU has been fixed.
- An issue causing Eyefinity setups to not be correctly detected for some players has been fixed.
- Fixed an issue where the HUD would get permanently disabled for some players.
- Fixed certain issues that caused the mouse cursor to be able to leave the game-screen on multi-monitor setups.
- Fixed an issue that caused the mouse cursor to not be visible in-game when the user has mouse trails enabled in Windows. We still recommend disabling mouse trails for a smoother in-game mouse cursor.
- Fixed issue where ammo count for collected guns is incorrect when Adams weapon is augmented.
- In DX9 mode:
o Fixed error message for some users when trying to use FXAA Medium or FXAA Low anti aliasing modes.
o Fixed shadow-mapping â€˜linesâ€™ on some graphics hardware when using anisotropic filtering.

Feature Additions:
- The Enter and Numpad-Enter keys can now be bound to game actions in the keyboard control menu.
- Intro logos can now be skipped on all but the first run of the game.
- Added windowed mode.
o Selectable in the menu, and can be toggled between windowed, fullscreen, and fullscreen windowed using ALT-ENTER.
- Added an option to change the text language of the game. This setting only changes the text language, the audio is controlled by the language option in Steam."

I already started downloading..."
,bbutton1,2011-09-20T23:53Z,I click on the .exe or the shortcut after applying the new crackfix and it just won't start. Maybe it's just me.
,JustinDx17,2011-09-21T06:47Z,"I feel dumb for asking, but it's gotta be done. I downloaded and mounted the iso (running Windows 7). After running the setup, I tried to run the game and I got a warning that said I needed to have Steam client running, so I opened that. I can't play the game... It brings up game trailers and won't open the game itself. Is there a step I'm missing somewhere? Any help would be great! Thanks in advance."
,Garlantec,2011-09-21T07:03Z,"Man, if at least half of the Leechers wouldn't be such fucking douchebags and actually seed instead of running off with their finished DL, lots of people would have a much easier time getting this game.

So Thanks!

,mig092,2011-09-21T07:55Z,it's kind of ironic how this torrent hasn't showed up in some of the most well known private trackers. most people seem to be happy with the p2p version...
,bbutton1,2011-09-21T11:58Z,"I don't know. This torrent is on my private tracker(lasttorrents.org).

Unfortunately, I can't run the game."
