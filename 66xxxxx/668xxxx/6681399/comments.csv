,atik0786,2011-10-03T15:53Z,"@spykar7:look man there is no kind of compression software..its and encoder called Megui by which we uploaders encode the movie to smaller size but still mainting the quality...it takes around 6-7 pretty long hours to encode a movie..this is the link of the s/w..if u want then download and use it:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/megui/"
