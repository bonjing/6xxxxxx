Will seed."
,Sinister181,2011-09-20T21:35Z,"Unplayable. The game has some sort of AP where it just freezes, or the wiimote stops responding. Even when it's booted through cIOS 222 it freezes and probably requires an alternative .dol patch. I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned this."
,Corbael,2011-09-24T02:30Z,"No one has said anything because it does work just fine. You need to update your IOS. Install ""cIOSX rev21d2x V6"" on 249. The issue your having is IOS Reload and that's now a thing of the past thanks to V6."
,Sinister181,2011-09-24T06:54Z,"Thanks! I'll try that, and see if it makes a difference."
,Corbael,2011-09-25T13:30Z,"No problem. If you happen to have any questions just do a Google search for ""cIOSX rev21d2x V6"" and GBAtemp has a great form set up that has step by step instructions. I would also suggest installing a loader build that uses IOS 249 as default because I have never had any game not work flawlessly with cIOSX rev21d2x V6. Good luck to you!"

Great games!  I bought ""Beat"" when it first came out on WiiWare, and have been curious to try the others.  Thank you!  "
