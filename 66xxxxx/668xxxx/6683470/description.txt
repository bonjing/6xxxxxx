When building an entertainment centre, woodworkers have to take into account the size of the space it will fit in to, how many electronic components it will house, the style in which it will be built and the materials needed. Design and Build Your Ideal Entertainment Center, shows woodworkers how to design and construct an entertainment centre that will fit their own personal needs. Using step-by-step instructions and full-colour photos, they are shown how to install built-in cabinetry, how to create chases for wires and cables, and how to include specialty hardware. The ten projects include a variety of style - modular, mix-n-match, knock down and even an old ice box. Readers will end up with a one-of-a-kind entertainment centre suitable for all their needs.
