#######          WORLD OF WARCRAFT - WOTLK 3.3.5a (Mac Intel Version)         #######
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a CLEANSED version of a previous World of Warcraft - WOTLK 3.3.5a torrent
which can be found elsewhere...  This version has has all the patch installers, cache files, user data, and add-ons removed so that it is as compact as possible.

NOTE: This version of WoW is already configured to utilize logon.molten-wow.com as
      the realm server and more information / registration can be found at
      www.Molten-WoW.com ... However, by changing the realmlist.wtf file - it can be
      configured for other servers (tested, working).
      
Many gigabytes of unnecessary data were removed and there should be no problems with
the unzipping of this file now.  Also, this version is for Intel Macintosh systems
only, and has been tested with OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and OS X 10.7 (Lion).

EXTRA INFO: To unzip, right click on the .zip file and select 'Open With -&gt;' then use 
            'Archive Utility' (green icon) to unzip the folder...  Do NOT use The 
            Unarchiver or StuffIt Expander as these do not work properly.

Thanks and enjoy!!
