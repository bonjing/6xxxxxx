  Stage 5 Summary Exeter to Exmouth 15 Sep 2011                         
                                                                        
  Stage Five will be the first Tour of Britain stage to be held         
  entirely within Devon since the race was revived in 2004, making the  
  15 September a special day for cycling fans in the county.            
                                                                        
  Starting off in the heart of Exeter under the watchful gaze of the    
  opposites of the ancient cathedral and the new Princeshay shopping    
  and leisure development, the stage heads out of the city and across   
  the River Exe via Fore Street and immediately uphill, setting the     
  tone for a tough first half to the stage.                             
                                                                        
  Quality is poor on this one, ITV changed their schedules at the last  
  minute to accomodate the Rugby Union World Cup on their sporting      
  channel, so we bring you this crappy WEBRip, for stage completion     
  reasons only. Hopefully enough to keep you hardcore cycling fans      
  until reasonably happy until stage 6. See you on Stage 6, definitely  
  in WS.PDTV!!
