    Mrinalini, an aging actress, writes a       
    suicide note. As a performer, the first     
    lesson she had learn was timing - the       
    perfect moment for making an entrance       
    or an exit on stage. On the stage of        
    life, her entrance had been outside her     
    control; but she wants to choose the        
    moment of her exit at least. However,       
    before taking the pills that will put       
    her to sleep forever, she decides to        
    destroy all her memorabilia - letters,      
    photographs, newspaper cuttings, knick      
    -knacks pertaining to the past - lest       
    they fall into the hands of the press.      
    She has been a victim of media attention    
    all her life and wishes to be spared        
    that at her death. As she looks through     
    the old box that contains relics from       
    her past, memories flood the night.
