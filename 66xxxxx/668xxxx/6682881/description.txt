 [Release Notes]

 Source = http://www.radioventuresinc.com (Closed down, company stopped 
 business) 
 Why we do an INT pre ? 
 The new scene rules sucks big time. This kind of rlses are not accepted 
 anymore. Look at our last nukes. Radio Ventures isn't a valid store 
 anymore. It's true, Radio Ventures isn't a normal shop, it's a radio 
 service, delivering promo's. You got to have a licence to have access, 
 work for radio or be a registered prof. DJ. What happened to the scene 
 lately ? The scene used to be the place to find all the latest promo's 
 before they were in the stores. Isn't that allowed anymore ? We are now 
 in 2011, record companies won't deliver promo cds anymore, it's all 
 downloaded. And Radio Ventures is one of those places. So how can we tag 
 this rls ? As a -PROMO_WEB- ? That option seems to be forgotten in the 
 latest rules. We were never asked to discuss about those new scene 
 rules, and we didn't sign them either (never asked). So we are left with one option, to release all our Radio Ventures stuff as an -INT-. We are 
 not happy about this, makes us sad and frustrated, we used to do this 
 for fun. But were's the fun lately ?
