  The Somerset stage of The Tour of Britain is a stage of two halves,   
  with the first mainly flat as the race makes its way across the       
  Somerset levels, punctuated only by a couple of short climbs. After   
  reaching Cheddar and the edge of the Mendip Hills the stage changes   
  its complexion, with two large Category One Skoda King of the         
  Mountains climbs taking the race into Wells.                          
                                                                        
  Much better quality on Stage 6 than the WEBRip of Stage 5!
