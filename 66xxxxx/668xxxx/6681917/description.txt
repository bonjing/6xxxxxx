Highway Call is the first solo album by Dickey Betts (under the name Richard Betts) of The Allman Brothers Band. It was recorded in 1974 in Macon, Georgia at Capricorn Studios. On this album, Betts further develops and perfects the country sound that emerged on the Allman's 1973 album Brothers and Sisters. The standout tracks are "Long Time Gone", "Highway Call", and the extended country jam "Hand Picked". Guest musicians include Vassar Clements on fiddle and Jeff Hanna on acoustic guitar.
