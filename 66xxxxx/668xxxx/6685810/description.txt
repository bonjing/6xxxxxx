Some guy (he prefers not to mention his name) released latest cracked update for Deus Ex: Human Revolution. He has pretty nice reputation so you can expect that this will work 100%. I think nobody from the scene will release this update because of things that have happened with releasing the game. Itâ€™s impossible to crack it in any other way except first P2P, so sane grps just wonâ€™t release it. Anyways, here is the changelog!

Description:
An issue was found that caused some users to be unable to start the game on specific machines. Specifically, the presence of older ATI/AMD drivers, also on machines with NVidia hardware, would cause the game to crash on startup. This patch is a hot-fix for that particular issue. On top of this, it also increases the number of save-slots from 20, like on the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, to 99.


Install instructions:

Use with cracked steam or steamclient.dll based emulator of your choice!
