This works 100% :)"
,grupgrup,2011-09-19T05:41Z,"Has anyone scanned this? I know .Dude. is a trusted uploader, and no offense to you, .Dude., but the last version of this update that I downloaded had some serious trojans in it. Also the description is for the previous update, NOT this one. And this part: ""Some guy (he prefers not to mention his name) released latest cracked update for Deus Ex: Human Revolution. He has pretty nice reputation so you can expect that this will work 100% ... "" seems slightly suspect ..."
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-19T06:03Z,.
,doneffa,2011-09-19T09:03Z,no problem or?
,Netarangi,2011-09-19T12:34Z,Works fine.
,MiniZaggy,2011-09-19T14:12Z,I assume this doesnt work witht he shitrow release right ?
,druid513,2011-09-19T14:21Z,"why some trainer show 1662, and update is 12630?
is there a 1662 update or 12630 trainer? or are they same thing?"
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-19T14:36Z,that trainers are for the old release.
,brianxxx,2011-09-19T14:37Z,"Here are the patch notes directly from Eidos:

Fixes:

    We have addressed various issues that can occur for players that would result in 'stuttering'.
    Stutters that are the result of graphics driver shader processing are now removed or significantly reduced.
    Stutters that are the result of data streaming have been removed or significantly reduced.
    Performance has been improved and made more stable on dual-core systems. This could previously also result in stuttering.
    Fixed issue where some players couldn't complete the Motherly Ties side quest.
    Fixed an issue where doors in Omega Ranch sometimes wouldn't open.
    The TYM medical card should no longer fall through the table if an NPC's body comes into contact with the card. Players already stuck in this area will need to revert to a previous save before the card fell through.
    Occasional hangs for some players during video-playback have been fixed.
    A crash on startup when running DX11 on a single-core CPU has been fixed.
    An issue causing Eyefinity setups to not be correctly detected for some players has been fixed.
    Fixed an issue where the HUD would get permanently disabled for some players.
    Fixed certain issues that caused the mouse cursor to be able to leave the game-screen on multi-monitor setups.
    Fixed an issue that caused the mouse cursor to not be visible in-game when the user has mouse trails enabled in Windows. We still recommend disabling mouse trails for a smoother in-game mouse cursor.
    Fixed issue where ammo count for collected guns is incorrect when Adams weapon is augmented.
    Fixed error message for some users when trying to use FXAA Medium or FXAA Low anti aliasing modes (DX9 mode)
    Fixed shadow-mapping 'lines' on some graphics hardware when using anisotropic filtering (DX9 mode)

Features added:

    The Enter and Numpad-Enter keys can now be bound to game actions in the keyboard control menu.
    Intro logos can now be skipped on all but the first run of the game.
    Added windowed mode - selectable in the menu, and can be toggled between windowed, fullscreen, and fullscreen windowed using ALT-ENTER.
    Added an option to change the text language of the game. This setting only changes the text language, the audio is controlled by the language option in Steam."
,Fermi97,2011-09-19T15:36Z,Downloaded and tested. This is NOT the latest patch. It's the same patch and crack included with SHITROW version of the game. The game is still version 1.1.622 after i aplied this patch. So...FAKE.
,grupgrup,2011-09-19T17:26Z,"I couldn't get it to download from this link for some reason so found it elsewhere ... and it is the latest patch, so far as I can tell. Automatically skips all the opening videos which I know the latest patch is supposed to do ... some improvement with stuttering as well."
,grupgrup,2011-09-19T17:29Z,Not fake. This is the correct patch.
,Wotter,2011-09-19T17:30Z,"Works fine with the v 1.1.622.0 PROPER. Simple copy and paste. All saves are still playable if anyone was worried.


Thanks .Dude."
,AL13N13,2011-09-19T17:43Z,Works fine with TPTB version. Thx for the ul
,MiniZaggy,2011-09-19T18:17Z,"Unrared in the game directory (shitrow version). Works fine, the game starts, i can play it and all... good work i guess!"
,desertlizard,2011-09-19T18:39Z,"Might want to use caution applying this update. In Eidos forums some say this update helped with stuttering issues, others say it made them worse, and there seems to be equal amount of both."
,gouji1032,2011-09-19T20:06Z,update 1.2.630 made it worse for me. the stuttering is more terrible..... im starting to wonder if those debuggers in eidos really know what they are doing or its all guess work in their part. hmmm
,sp4rk13,2011-09-19T22:11Z,"fermi is lying, this is a good torrent, the second update to DEHR.  It smoothed the fps for me."
,vincentdesrd,2011-09-20T03:00Z,Game clearly shows 1.2.630 on the lower right after applying this patch. Good clean torrent.
,AznAssassin,2011-09-21T10:49Z,This doe not work with Kaos' version :(
,Nitsus,2011-09-21T22:47Z,"For me, this update made the game extremely laggy, rendering it unplayable. GeForce 9800GTX+ (drivers v280.26), Core2Quad Q8400, 4GB of RAM, Win7 64-bit."
,paladin181,2011-09-22T07:50Z,"Good torrent, works for me."
,EndFED,2011-09-22T20:05Z,"Hi, this update doesn't help the game to work on my computer. (*Pentium 2 333 MHz *128mb of ram *ATI Rage IIC PCI 4MB graphic card) "
[T],FatFreddy756,2011-09-22T23:18Z,"for those with NVIDIA cards that are experiencing the stuttering, update your video card drivers to the beta version 285.27 ones and a lot of the stuttering will go away. 

Im using a kinda old GTS 240 and updating to that driver made the game run a lot smoother compared to the 280.26 driver i previously had."
,GAHDOOSH,2011-09-23T22:19Z,This doesn't seem to be working for me. Downloaded and copied into game folder (SHiTROW version) and got a blank dialog box with a big red X in it. HELP?
,kaliver,2011-09-26T02:40Z,the problem GAHDOOSH is experience is likely caused by incompatible patch files.
,kruddydude,2011-11-08T08:05Z,"Works 100% with Shitrow release, lessens load times and removes frame stutter :) all happy here!"
,Persason,2011-11-12T20:30Z,Fantastic. This is no installer guys its just a drag and drop of two files. It works with all releases without messing up your save games.

PLEASE tell me you're just trolling."
