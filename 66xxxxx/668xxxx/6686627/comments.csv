,MuserClair,2011-09-19T12:20Z,"thanks for the fixed ul :-)

for those who'd dl'd the other torrent and don't wanna re-dl good files, i found files 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 on the original torrent would not open.
(Also just noticed a few appeared to be incomplete when reloading into utorrent despite seemingly opening fine.. ..4, 9, 10, 11.. ..although i guess this could just be me) :-)"
