
The Hillbilly Moon Explosion - 4 albums {MP3}

The Hillbilly Moon Explosion are a pan-European rockâ€™nâ€™roll band with much flair 
and a fast growing fan-base. Theyâ€™re fronted by the Italian-Swiss songstress 
Emanuela Hutter and English exile singer and slap bassist Oliver Baroni, ably 
backed by English guitarist Duncan James and Swiss drummer Luke â€˜The Pukeâ€™ Weyermann.

Emerging from the rockabilly scene in their home base of Zurich, they recently 
turned down an invitation to be the Swiss Eurovision entry. Known to some for their
mini-hit â€˜Johnny Are You Gay?â€™, a recent retrospective has propelled them gigging 
across Europe, including TV shows and a tour supporting Jeff Beck climaxing at the 
legendary Paris Olympia.
