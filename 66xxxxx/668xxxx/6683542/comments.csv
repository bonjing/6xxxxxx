Then once you get that downloaded, pause all but #2, so on and so on. Once you have all 10 parts, please seed for a little while and help me out. Im using 4GB a DAY in bandwith and im gong to hit my cap. I believe Comcast is capping everyone now at 250GB then they throttle. If it happens every month, they will terminate your service. Thats only about 8GB a day, which im coming very close to using if you add in the movies, songs, and ebooks I download for myself."
