Red Giant Software -=- Adobe CS5.5 Compatibility
================================================

We are working hard on updating all of our installers for CS5.5 compatibility. 
With over 60 installers to update, it's going to take a little while! In the 
meantime, we want to make sure that you can install your product for CS5.5 
so we've created a little utility you can use that will allow you to install.

Saying that, we have tested all of the plugins themselves and they work without 
issue once you have them in the right place for CS5.5. Here's what you need 
to do while we work our way through the installers:

Step 1: If you have Adobe CS5 installed as well
===============================================

If you have both CS5 and CS5.5 installed, run the Red Giant CS5 installer for 
the product you wish to install. Once complete, copy the plugins from the CS5 
directory to the CS5.5 directory. For complete  instructions, please see our 
FAQ on this subject here:

http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/company/contact-us/support/faq/226/


Step 2: If you only have Adobe CS5.5 installed
==============================================

1. Run the CS55Tool.exe in this directory.
   a. CS55Tool.exe creates some registry entries that our installers expect to find. 
   These entries will point our installers at the CS5.5 directories when you 
   choose the CS5 installation options.

2. Run the Red Giant CS5 Installer for the product you wish to install.
   a. When you run the installer, choose the CS5 installation paths and the product 
   will be installed for CS5.5. You will not need to copy any plugin files as we will
   install to the correct directories.

3. Enjoy!"

,TwixyPie,2012-05-26T04:00Z,Everything works perfectly! Amazing! Thanks so much!
,TwixyPie,2012-05-26T04:02Z,"Everything works perfectly! Amazing! Thanks so much!

@elasher
I thought I had the same problem. I have CS5.5 too. So, you have to go to the CS5.5 folder and run the tool. Then, go back to the CS5 folder and run the installer from there. There is no installer in the CS5.5 folder."
