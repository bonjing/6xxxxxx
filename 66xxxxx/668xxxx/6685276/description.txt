â€˜Wounded Rhymesâ€™is Lykke Li second album. The second single from it its called â€˜I Follow Riversâ€™ and will accompany â€˜Get Someâ€™ as a second consecutive suggestion that the naive and youthful Lykke Li we heard on 2008â€²s â€˜Youth Novelsâ€™ has taken a dark and ominous turn in the three years since her last release. Her voice is not so much fragile as resilient on the new tracks, and where â€˜Youth Novelsâ€™ might have seen a reverb-soaked piano ballad, â€˜Wounded Rhymesâ€™ seems more accustomed to the tribal, upbeat and passionate side of Lykke Liâ€™s musical character. Judging purely on the two tracks at hand, there seems to be a lack of colour not only in the artwork but also in the music, which displays a certain new-found mechanical drive at its roots, a drive rarely touched on before now.
