Limahl - back in the spotlight, reunited with Kajagoogoo and touring in Europe!  This is a 2007 remaster of his 1998 solo album.

Lamahl's career started in the early 80s when he joined Kajagoogoo as lead singer. The band hit the "limelight" with the release of "Too Shy", which became an international chartbuster.  Limahl is perhaps best known, however, for his performance of "The Neverending Story" theme on Giorgio Moroder's original soundtrack album.
