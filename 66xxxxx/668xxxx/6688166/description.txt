plot info
After the battle with Trip, Ash decides to do some special training with Oshawott to get him to open his eyes underwater. They go to a lake, but when Ash forces Oshawott's eyes open while they are swimming, he gets upset and uses Water gun on Ash and blows him out of the lake. At their campsite, Iris is watching over the other PokÃ©mon while they are playing a game. As Emolga and Snivy get in a fight, Scraggy wanders off and finds a group of Foongus that he angers by using headbutt. The Foongus use Poison Powder that hits all of the PokÃ©mon. Cilan, Ash, and Oshawott go out to find a herb that will cure the poison, but it only grows at the bottom of a lake. Ash takes Oshawott with him into the lake, where they are spotted by a wild Palpitoad, angered because of it's encounter with Trip. The Palpitoad instructs a school of Tympole to attack them, and Oshawott cannot fight back because he cannot see them. He holds his own until he gains enough courage and opens up his eyes, scaring the Tympole off. However, Palpitoad calls upon a Stunfisk friend that uses Discharge to force Ash and Oshawott out of the lake. Cilan decides to use his fishing skills to get the Stunfisk out of the water, drawing Palpitoad out as well. Oshawott battles against Palpitoad while Cilan uses his fishing rod to get Stunfisk KO'd. Oshawott finally is able to defeat Palpitoad when he opens his eyes during Aqua Jet, allowing Ash to capture Palpitoad while Cilan captures Stunfisk. Oshawott dives into the lake once more and finds the herb, which they bring back to camp to heal the others. Oshawoot manages to earn the full respect and gratitude of all the PokÃ©mon.
