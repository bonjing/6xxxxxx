,RPO1973,2011-09-19T18:56Z,"Thanx for the appreciation.
I'll do all 6 movies. 
Unfortunately I can't upload at hyperspeed and the Force isn't much help either in these matters...
Patience young Jedies :-) 
""Return"" is scheduled for tomorrow.



BTW, if anyone prefers the three extra disks with westen-Europena subs etc. I'll do those too."
,nil1410,2011-09-19T23:08Z,"in new hope english audio is DTS HD.
Why this one has only DTS."
,RPO1973,2011-09-21T06:50Z,DTS MA= DTS HD Master Audio
,nil1410,2011-09-21T14:15Z,"oh is that so.
my mistake.
but please upload all 9 disc.
bonus discs are uploaded by someone of 89 Gb but dont know it is edited or compressed or as it is."
,RPO1973,2011-09-21T18:09Z,"I forgot to put in th ""HD""part...will correct for next uploads.
Will upload all, incl bonus disks.
BTW, don't know about the 89GB. 
I put put bonus disk one on my HD and it's only +/- 15GB (and very worth watching)"
,Warshine,2011-09-21T18:16Z,"Ohhhh I LOVE YOU!!!

This haves Spanish?

Latin American o Castilian?

You can upload a sample???

Anyway AWESOME JOB!!!"
,RPO1973,2011-09-22T16:17Z,"@ Warshine: Spanish and Portugese are not mentioned on the box, but my BR-player shows them as available. 
Can't check now, ripping ""Return"" atm.
I guess the disks were produced for the western-European market, so ""Spanish"" would not be Latin-American."
,RPO1973,2011-09-22T16:18Z,"Forgot: sorry, no samples. 
Don't know how to.... & too much trouble."
,Warshine,2011-09-22T16:34Z,"@RPO1973
