,Costel93,2011-09-29T14:18Z,"Hey VeroVenlo, thanks a million for uploading these, I've got a question though, can you pls respond? Shouldn't the audition be 1 hour and 20 minutes long? At least those from season 7 had that lenghth.. these have between 45-55 minutes.

The auditions are split in half in the weekend. So 1 episode is displayed saturday and sunday = 1 audition. 
At least the US episodes are 1 hour and something long 

Ty for reading! Pls help me"
