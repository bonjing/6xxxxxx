Storyline: Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) wakes up from hypersleep by a power surge to find himself alone, with no memory of who he is or what happened to the crew of the 60,000-passenger sleeper ship Elysium. Another power surge manages to awake Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) who is also suffering from amnesia. They are unable either to access the ship's bridge or to communicate with anyone else, including the three-man flight crew team they are supposed to relieve. With the ship wrecked by power surges from a failing reactor, Bower assumes he must be a technician automatically awakened by the principal on-board computer in order to effect repairs.
