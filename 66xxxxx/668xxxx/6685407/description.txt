The rediscovered films of the pre-revolutionary Russian director Evgenii Bauer, characterized by Symbolist and Decadent motifs, are stunningly original in their use of mise-en-scÃ¨ne and lighting to convey story. The Crimea serves well for both Paris and the Riviera in this opulently staged film about idle bourgeois life in the salons of Paris. Film critic and screenwriter Valentin Turkin wrote in 1918, "Everyone remembers the characters in Bauer's films, figures quietly slipping by or sitting, lost in thought, the tardy, passionate, first embrace of lovers, life quietly passing by, suddenly interrupted by a cry, a fall, death, which leaves in its wake peace and loneliness in empty halls and at the silent cemetery." Bauer died following an accident during the making of The King of Paris and the film was completed by the actress Ol'ga Rakhmanova, making her the first Russian woman director.
