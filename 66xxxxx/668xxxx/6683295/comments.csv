[T],L3G3ND,2011-09-17T21:48Z,"this is a collection of 3d imax movies.

Need more info go to the above link"
,shadowgp7,2011-09-26T20:30Z,"All the movies are in 3D SBS?
Because from some screenshots they look just 2D..."
,margalo,2011-09-28T16:04Z,"When open torrent, it's all mkv
I suppose not in 3D.
I don't want to download  56gib if it's not in 3D."
,kdreamx,2011-09-30T04:27Z,"margalo//
Iz all 3D......mkv has nothing to do with vids being 3d or not. 
Also,.......it says ""S.B.S""............................"
,jonmobrien,2011-10-06T07:08Z,"The best quality HD 3D container is mkv, so I would have been very upset if these files were not mkv! Look at the uploaded-by person - PrimE-RulZ - his other 3D uploads are fantastic, so why wouldn't this be? If in any doubt, just download one 3GB file and when you see it is a real SBS 3D mkv file, feel free to download the rest."

,margalo,2011-10-08T16:03Z,"sorry, i'm looking for real 3D not S.B.S."
,jonmobrien,2011-10-09T09:40Z,"I am deeply curious as to what margao considers to be ""Real 3d""??? Do you want analglyph red/cyan???"
,margalo,2011-10-13T17:45Z,"sbs reduce horizontal resolution image
full 3d (or real 3d) reconstruct a full 3D image, high quality by the uniformity of its components
so, i personnaly prefer full 3d"
,boboblob1,2011-10-14T02:39Z,"This torrent is MISLABELED. Africa, Amazon, Australia, Antarctic, Alaska, the Alps, Coral Reef Adventure, Solarmax and Blue Planet are all NOT in 3D (of any kind). [I did not download the others, so they may be in 3D]"
,jonmobrien,2011-10-14T06:18Z,"Hi, first let me clarify - I never confirmed these are 3D files, I just responded to others saying about downloading all 56GB to find out, I said download 1 or 2 first, and that PrimE-RulZ other uploads were true.

HOWEVER - I have downloaded 6 of these titles and I can concur with boboblob1 - NONE of these titles are in 3D. In semi-fairness to PrimE-Rulz, he did not make this pack, he simply downloaded it another site that mycutzu uploaded to and PrimeRulz simply re-uploaded it - apparantly without checking it whatsoever for authenticity, thereby putting his own name to a FALSELY labelled product.

PirateBay moderators - this pack needs to be MOVED out of the 3D section to the 2D section and relabelled, and every title with 3D in the filename renamed.

See my comments I made on the other site - it is aparrent mycutzu genuinely ripped these from the actual 3D discs, but simply ripped only the left-eye or right-eye file from the disc, and neither included the other-eye file nor muxed them together into a SBS mkv file.

Thanks for the FullHD 2D pack, which is glorious in 2D, but anyone wanting 2D will not look here because of the mislabel, and us wanting 3D are misled. Shame on Prime-Rulz for not checking before putting it here.

Note: Prime-Rulz other uploads are good - he has uploaded a separate Hubble 3D file which is in brilliant 3D, and a title not in this pack, Imax Dinosaurs - Giants of Patagonia is in brilliant 3D.

Note to margalo: there is no such thing as FullHD3D in portable compatible files like mkv with today's TV technology. It has nothing to do with the mkv format whatsoever. See my notes on the other site, you can in fact make Full-SBS mkv files from your rips, but no technology today can play it, so whether labelled as SBS or Half-SBS, every SBS file today is Half-SBS. The only way to get Full 1920x1080 left-eye frame and right-eye frame is through a BluRay disc and a BluRay player. There are various titles out there with full ISO images of the BluRay discs that you can burn onto a BD disc and load in your BD player, but these file sizes are massive, and they are ONLY suited for people with a BD burner, which are still very expensive, and I have not met anyone ever whom I can sit down in front of a 65"" 3D screen, and play for them a FullHD 3D BluRay title, and then switch to a Half-SBS mkv rip of the same title, and tell me which was which. I bet in a double-blind test, you could not.

However, while it is fair for you to want FullHD-3D, it is not fair to criticize uploaders for putting up Half-SBS files that are a fraction of the size of ISO images and are compatible with 100% of 3D TV owners compared with about 1% of 3D TV owners who also have a BD burner. It is also  inappropriate for you to be complaining whilst being totally inaccurate in your complaint. It is non-sensical to say ""True 3D"", ""Real 3D"" - of course SBS is truly really 3D. Even analglyph is 3D. One could even argue Analglyph is truly FullHD, as the left and right eye get the full unstretched image each, just with color blurring. So by your nonsensical definition, analglyph is ""True3D"". But I have determined what you are really after is ""Full/True/Real HD 3D"". As I said, it is fair enough to desire that, just be accurate in saying it is what you want.

Personally, I think it is way cheaper to buy a 3D title than to buy a BD burner and blank BD discs, and even a BluRay player if you don't have one, since you don't need any of that, not even a BluRay player, for Half-SBS mkv files. I have bought many 3D BluRay discs (Guardians of Ga'Hoole, Open Season, Pirannah, several others), and will continue buying titles I want to keep.

In all honesty, the common opinion on the web is that: anyone uploading a BluRay ISO image is NOT doing it to give that 1% the opportunity to have FullHD-3D to burn to BDs, no, the common opinion is that that person while trying to be helpfulin getting 3D titles out there, is either too new to 3D rips to know what to do to make SBS files, or too lazy to do it themselves, leaving it to every leecher to re"

,phishead,2011-10-27T18:53Z,@ jonmobrien Bluray burners are cheap. You must be a poor bastard. I bought one 2weeks ago for $80 off of newegg. Bluray DL discs are about $10 a piece and single layer Discs are about $1.
