Sherlock Holmes and the King's Evil
by Donald Thomas
read by John Telfer

In these five tales, Sherlock Holmes is shown at the height of his powers: he co-operates with a young Winston Churchill in the famed Siege of Sydney Street, helps defeat a plan for a German invasion outlined in the Zimmerman Telegram, establishes a link between two missing lighthouse keepers and the royal treasures of King John, contends with a supernatural curse places upon an eccentric aristocrat, and discovers a lost epic of Lord Byron. But it is all in a dayâ€™s work for the great detective, who continues to defy the odds and lives to fiddle and ratiocinate another day.

Here is another Thomas and Telfer audio book again divided into one mp3 for each story. Sadly I don't even think the CD set is out in the UK, for me to rip for Demonoid, but I've grabbed this 2 part download version and edited it (without decoding) into story mp3s. You would think that the place from where this originates (need I say the name - oh by the way I've also removed the 'this is audible' guff at the start and end) could at least do the editing themselves. No wonder we don't all shop there (and no wonder people turn to torrents!)
