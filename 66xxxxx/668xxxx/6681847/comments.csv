On DSL or cable Internet connections, latencies of less than 100 milliseconds (ms) are typical and less than 25 ms desired.

What Is Network Latency?

Bandwidth is just one element of what a person perceives as the speed of a network. Latency is another element that contributes to network speed. The term latency refers to any of several kinds of delays typically incurred in processing of network data. A so-called low latency network connection is one that generally experiences small delay times, while a high latency connection generally suffers from long delays.

Of course, this is not magic...but it clearly optimizes your network params for them to deliver the maximum bandwidth available"
