Once you copy the exe file in the application directory, and try to start it, it asks for a samsig50.dll file. Which doesn't exist nowhere. The original .exe uses a samsig521.dll.

I tried both the machine and the user based installation just to see, and as I suspected, it didn't work either. I think you forgot to supply the dll with your crack."
