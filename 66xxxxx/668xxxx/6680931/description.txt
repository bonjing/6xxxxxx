An anonymous love letter leads to a slew of misunderstandings in this lighthearted comedy starring Audrey Tautou (Amelie). When Emilie opens a heartfelt love letter from a secret admirer, her first instinct is to throw it in the trash. The skeptical salon owner has a change of heart, however, when she realizes what such a sentiment would mean to her lonely, despondent mother Maddie (Nathalie Baye). On a whim, Emilie forwards the letter, and goes on with her day. But later, when Maddie happens across Jean (Sami Bouajila) - a smitten Arab handyman and the original author of the amorous note - the mother and daughter find themselves in a heated competition for the same man.
