,jahnee,2011-09-17T18:06Z,"bro if your version is missing audio and has chairs blocking the view, don't upload it... the last thing we want are skull users re uploading this crap, those lazy ass fuck once there's a copy out those fucks are to lazy to try record a better version, instead they apply their shit ass 264 enconding, instaed of fucking buying a 720p cam "
,whatnm1,2011-09-17T18:33Z,I let you know in advance.  For some people it might be better than nothing.  Actually I think its pretty good considering it was on an iphone.
,FamilyMan82,2011-09-17T19:09Z,alright!! sweet!! Ive been looking for this on here for a while now. Thanks!  ...........Anybody know where to find 30 minutes or less Ive been looking for that one too
,GrosShadock,2011-09-17T19:15Z,"How long are the parts missing in the middle ? A few seconds ? 1 min ? 10 ?
If it's real thanks a lot, that'll do for me for the moment since it will only be released in several weeks in my country ! :-)"
,LukeScooto,2011-09-17T19:17Z,I couldnt agree more with Jahnee.

nice chairs"
,LukeScooto,2011-09-17T19:28Z,"If its real ill update in about an hour or two, im checking it out now. No seeders though so this could take a long long time."
,1fuzzyone,2011-09-17T19:31Z,jahnee - shut the fuck up - get over yourself m- go buy your own fucking cam if your going to bitch - i hate whinney lil bitches like you jahnee - thanks for the attemped - uploader its better than nothing - ignore the dumn fuck jahnee - what a bloody douche bag!!!!
,whatnm1,2011-09-17T19:39Z,"Yeah, I guess I agree.  I'm usually grateful for anything.  I'll say my holding the camera isn't the best that it could be.  I'll have to figure out a better way.  I got tired of holding it on my knee with my legs crossed.  The phone cut the video off after about 45 minutes which I didn't know.  There are only a few minutes missing I think.  The weird thing is that imdb says the movie is 106 minutes long and mine is 137.  Not sure.  For the missing audio, the phone rotated one clip vertically so I had to rotate that.  The second clip had the audio slid to the front and a part of it cut off of the beginning.  I've read of this happening with iphones and couldn't find out why.  So I rotated the one video, connected them, shifted the audio and exported to a smaller size.  The audio level might be a little low but after 2 hours to export I didn't feel like going back to fix it."
,nickopolis1777,2011-09-17T19:39Z,Ok so this has been in theaters for a week now and this is the first real version. Great attempt with the Iphone. Thanks for the upload and the guts to sit there recording this when no one else would. 1+
,whatnm1,2011-09-17T19:52Z,"Yeah, my isp upload speed is limited.  Once some people get it it will get better."
,LukeScooto,2011-09-17T19:56Z,"What have you uploaded ifuzzyone? Ive said it before and ill say it agian, if you dont upload ANYTHING EVER, whatever you say means NOTHING. Just words, no action. You take and dont ever give. But you sure can swear real good."
,whatnm1,2011-09-17T19:58Z,Thanks
,LukeScooto,2011-09-17T20:00Z,"Quality:
V: 5 (ive seen worse, the quality itself isnt bad at all, its the chairs that are a little distracting)
A: 7 (some is missing, little quiet in parts)
Overall its watchable if you've been waiting forever like everyone else. ITS REAL. Thanks to WhatNM1, nice job for having the balls to at least get it when all the skulls are too pussy to do it and will just copy this and put their own tag on it."
,hfi788,2011-09-17T20:05Z,"It's the real deal. Just watched the first few seconds, look decent. Seen much worse. Thank you.
"
,GrosShadock,2011-09-17T20:09Z,"LukeScooto, I don't understand why you said it's a fake at the beginning... what made you say that ?"
,dirtygrundies,2011-09-17T20:48Z,"At least it's apparently real, yeah the quality might suck, but at least this uploader isn't filling your computer full of virus bullshit."
,LukeScooto,2011-09-17T20:50Z,"Sorry my bad, I was just going by the the 138 previous fakes that most of which were uploaded by anonymous uploaders with no pervious ups. Totally my bad, sorry about that. Usually a movie like this is uploaded first by someone who has done it before. I give major respect to Whatnm1. "
,whatnm1,2011-09-17T21:06Z,"np, the covers are getting better at making it difficult to determine if its real or not"
,J.R.3,2011-09-17T21:18Z,"Dude, thanks for the effort. It is really appreciated. I will try to go to a theater this weekend and get a better copy, but you have earn some major respect from my part. Thanks!!!"
,1fuzzyone,2011-09-17T21:44Z,"luke i am trying to upload stuff - i have 4.5 terrabyutes of media been im 42 stole molly hatchet flirting with ddisater in 1978 on an apple 2 plus - took 2.5 hours so what do you want i think i got it - have over 5000 movies, 85,000 songs - have numerouys entire tv series - you want some thing let me know - - trying to teach myself - but - either way your bitching about something someone did - your an ungreatful piece of shit for that!"
,1fuzzyone,2011-09-17T21:49Z,ok here is what im doing - ziping the file(s) then using u-torrent to create new torrent - and i cant find it - put futurewolrd and westworld together (70s) flicks - so what did i do wrong.. and i learned to cuss in the military - you get mightyt verble when getting shot at!
,whatnm1,2011-09-17T21:56Z,If someone finds a camera that you can attach to your glasses that works with iphone let me know
,LukeScooto,2011-09-17T22:14Z,"@Whatnm1 thats a good idea! Ive seen a bunch of those glasses, but im not sure about any that work with an iphone. Most of the ones I see on ebay just record independently. I was going to get a Flip HD that records 2 hours of 720p and try that, but I was going to hang it from my neck like a necklace, and then just put it under my shirt when the movies over, but my concern is making sure its recording the movie perfectly and not cutting any part of the picture off. Probably will just take practice. I like your idea though
@1fuzzy, you have more media then I do then. I only have 500+ mp4/h264 dvd rip movies, no songs, some tv series, etc. Im working on getting more tv series and more movies, maybe some music too. I wasnt really just criticizing you, as more everyone who constantly has their two cents to say, whatever it might be, but they never upload a single thing, and as soon as thier down is done, they dont even bother seeding. They just take take take and never give a thing, but sure have alot to say. I might not have a ton uploaded, but im working on it, at least ive done something. Its good to hear that you have media waiting to upload at least. Thats more then most people. I would walk  you through the process, but i barely have it figured out myself, lol. I use BitTorrent if that helps any, it makes creating and downloading torrents super easy. Give it a try. "
,MASSIVEclouDs,2011-09-17T22:15Z,"Need more seeders. C'mon, this is the only one we got out. Dont be a d!ck and dump it."
,GrosShadock,2011-09-17T22:27Z,"Waou, I didn't knew filming in a quite dark room with an Iphone would work this well.
I hope this will give ideas to others.
Too bad that, in my country, movies are dubbed so we see them usualy 1 or 2 months after everybody (the time to do the dubbing), or else I think I'd gladly cam some of them too (but I'm probably not bold enough to use an Iphone, I'd rather buy some spycam hidden in a tie or something like that... they are sooo cheap in China !)."
,1fuzzyone,2011-09-17T22:27Z,whatnm1 - thank you - finnaly completed - tell me how you upload please - i tried and cant seem to do it - i have so many classic movies and tv shows and tons upon tons of music - but i guess im an idiot - just missing a step please give me instrutions how to upload - and thanks again for getting a copy of this out there - and congradulations on being the first one :)
,1fuzzyone,2011-09-17T22:46Z,"ok luke now i can say im sorry for calling you names ... im sorry lol, i use utorrent and also tried to upload on here but took forever and page never changed - i have many zip programs - freearc,rarzillia,7zip and have several ways to encode a movie - i use cyberlink media suite, wondershare converter, and have vlc media player - have bluray burner all that stuff - disabledvet have a ton of time on my hands - but i click on create a torrent in utorrent and load the ziped file and it says in utorrent it is working but cant find it on pirate bay  - will try bit torrent - think it is same as utorrent in the long run but thank you for your input and sorry again for acting like a 3 year old - have tons of sci-fi stuff and classic westerns and tv shows- some very hard to find in not impossible"
,FamilyMan82,2011-09-17T22:47Z,"if the cam was zoomed and framed properly this would be a top notch cam but the fact that you can see chairs and people and the ceiling of the theater really ruins it, but if you want to see this movie that bad...go for it. the parts of the screen you can see really are pretty godd quality"
,whatnm1,2011-09-17T23:01Z,"Yeah, I'll have to do better at filming.  To make it I just put the files I wanted to upload in a folder, create the torrent file in the same place with torrent or whatever client, upload the torrent to pb and fill out their form.  It can seem difficult the first time.  There is a tutorial in the pb forum for basics for beginners faq and how to upload."
,tuffyturner,2011-09-17T23:05Z,thanks for the effort i truely appreciate it:)
,chyna11,2011-09-17T23:28Z,ty i been waitin 4 this movie u rock!!!!!!
,1fuzzyone,2011-09-18T00:15Z,"thanks whatnm1 still trying and failing got 25 meg broadband cant figure it out
'"
,ChasUGC,2011-09-18T00:40Z,"Why upload this crap? Four minutes of missing audio, sheesh. It's like saying that the Broncos lost by 21 points, otherwise it was a good game. We need to start with the complete audio and video in decent quality, at least. Sorry, my opinion, I had to say it. Although, I do appreciate the uploaders, I really wanted to see this one. "
,hooverd78,2011-09-18T01:21Z,"TY to the up loader! Not a good copy at all but have been wanting to see this! Did not see the 'missing' parts but the start has chairs, like a real movie experience!!! LOL! Not fake. Thanks again to the up loader, will still look for a better copy! Oh and will seed like crazy for the people who can watch without complaining! Lol"
,suggestausername,2011-09-18T01:44Z,"THANK YOU.  However, still want a better copy...  :)  Was getting so desperate I was trying to think how I could do this.  STAPLES, the office supply place, has a free return policy.  Meaning, they don't charge a return fee when you return some expensive electronic item.  Like a camcorder.  :)  But how to hold the thing for hours without shaking?  What seat to sit in, at the theatre?  I assume the middle section would be best, but down in front or closer towards the back?  Does anybody ever get busted while at the theatre?  And most importantly, again, how to prop the camera up for two hours so that it doesn't shake???"
,suggestausername,2011-09-18T01:49Z,"Maybe I could pretend to need a crutches, and use those as a tripod?  How is everybody else doing this?  Shaking, and getting only the screen without all the chairs and people's head, are the main problems."
,whatnm1,2011-09-18T02:14Z,"if you want a hand fuzzyone I'll be in the pb chat room as jeffmr.  Yeah, after a while I got tired of holding it on my leg so I rested it on my chest and breathed lightly.  Like I said glasses with a camera on them would be best because you'd be looking at it.  But I've looked at mini tripods and holders and even some kind of necklace.  For seats, sit in the back and middle and make angry faces at people that come up to sit there especially old people."
,suggestausername,2011-09-18T02:44Z,"Okay, stop seeding.  Seriously, just stop.  This is not even the full movie.  Huge gaps were missing, it was obvious.  The scene from the offical movie trailer, with Gwenyth Paltro, wasn't there and huge chunks were missing because the plot made no sense and then it just stopped."
,suggestausername,2011-09-18T02:57Z,"Also, it's called FOCUS.  seriously.  zoom in.  oh, maybe an iphone doesn't have that option?  ah well, great first try on a long-anticipated movie but no cigar.  :)   And frankly I'm kind of disappointed.  Dystopian movies should have lots of scenes of people dying.   HUGE CHUNKS MISSING.  I saw maybe 30 minutes worth of film between the opening credits to the final credits.  Now sorta agreeing with the people who said don't bother uploading this, but at least now my curiosity is sated (crappy dystopian movie) and can wait for a better copy."
,whatnm1,2011-09-18T03:39Z,let us know when you upload your next fake 709mb copy
,suggestausername,2011-09-18T03:58Z,"Okay, correction.  After playing the original, as originally downloaded, the ""missing"" gaps have magically appeared.   I didn't know if it was okay to watch the original *as it was being seeded*, so I made a copy and was watching the copy.  The copy had gaps but the original doesn't.  Apologies for the confusion."
,jahnee,2011-09-18T04:24Z,"BRO, can you maybe perhaps try to record this one more time? lazy ass skull users are not lifting up their asses to provide for the community, they just wait for the shitest copy so they can run their 264 encoding software, lazy ass fucks"
,dredre27,2011-09-18T05:10Z,"Thank you for your hard effort and contribution, something none of us have ever done at all or done correctly. Your efforts are appreciated, after all none of us paid for this so we have no right cursing or complaining. Much thanks."
,1fuzzyone,2011-09-18T07:29Z,"WHATNM1- tell me more - i must be an idiot - pb chat room - wow thats what i need - tell me more --- and still thanks for the upload - and i guess someone cant burn an h264 encoded download- jahnee - go download cyberlink media suite and wondershare video converter - also get the vlc player  - then you will stop your whining - you can burn, play,edit, encode, any file out there - so first get educated then get the proper tools and if you fail you have only yourself to blame.. thanks again and more info anyone ansf"
,johnsmithq,2011-09-18T07:33Z,worst cam ever way off center the audio sucked you have no right to upload such crap now usually i think people are to harsh about comments but really man through your camera and computer out and take up a sport because this is not the thing for you peace wanna be
,fileadjustor,2011-09-18T14:59Z,whatnm1  how do i get in touch with you as you page isnt comign up?
,krazyfeline82,2011-09-19T00:14Z,Cant watch this on any of the 5 programs on my computer. must have to watch it on a handheld or something. doesnt work with miro or vlc
,rubak48,2011-09-19T08:38Z,i love chairs
