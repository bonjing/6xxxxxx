Made in 1977, and only finally released in 1987, this is Sokurov's first feature-length film.  Extraordinarily beautiful, utilising an array of unusual stylistic devices, it seems as if Sokurov's style was fully formed from the outset.  A sublime meditation on love, loneliness, life and death, it still stands as one of his finest achievements.
