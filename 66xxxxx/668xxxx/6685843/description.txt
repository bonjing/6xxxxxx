              Tommy Fawkes wants to be a successful           
               comedian but his Las Vegas debut is a           
               failure. He goes back to Blackpool, UK,         
               where his father, also a comedian started      
                 and where he spent the summers of his           
                 childhood. He starts to search for a            
                partner, a comic relief, with whom he can       
                be famous.
