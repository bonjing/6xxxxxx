One Morning Left is a five-man engine driven out of hiding from the colder parts of northern Finland. Founded in 2008 the band found itself recording itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first material just after the second practice session and have since released the charged EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Panda <3 PenguinÃ¢â‚¬Â.

Combining elements of eurodance, hardcore, metal and electronic music this five-piece orchestra delivers a fresh new experience that is guaranteed to rock your socks off. One Morning Left has played shows within the borders of Finland as well as in Europe and has already acquired quite the fan base through modern medias, like Myspace with over 300 000 profile views and 50 000 friends.
