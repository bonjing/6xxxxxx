,Sick_Jargon,2011-09-20T23:37Z,"Thanks for the upload VTV.

This is unusually slow for an Alphas download. I've been downloading the episodes since the show started and they've all been quick...

Nearly 12000 seeds, you'd expect this to be a lot quicker :("
,rj32202,2011-09-21T06:26Z,System really needs to changed.  Heck of a difference in seeders and people who have downloaded the file.  8 seeders not 8829 as reported.  Makes the information useless at this point.   Who cares how many have downloaded if they are not seeding it means nothing.
