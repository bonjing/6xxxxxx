,scottsasse,2011-09-27T02:38Z,WHY do you call it a CAM when in your description it says R5 XviD-playXD????? I am sure this is the same shitty DVDSCR that others uploaded that are edited for all the cursing for some reason. This makes the movie intolerable because the audio is muted repeatedly!! I would rather have a CAM than an edited copy. If I'm wrong then please let me know at  DrWynnScott@gmail.com THANKS!!
