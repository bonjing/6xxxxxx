,Babelardo,2011-10-05T01:34Z,if this happens to be the film by Bela Tarr I implore you: seed! Its freaking impossible to find... If anyone is kind enough to do this for me I pledge to grow a mustache in his honour

Yes, this is the real thing. Good quality, apart from the fact that there is a VCR-type ticker going on all the time which doesn't distract at all times. Very good quality, long movie, typical Tarr stuff, recommended for hardcore fans. 
Many thanks for this upload."
