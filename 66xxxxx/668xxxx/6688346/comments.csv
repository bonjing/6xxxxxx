,mantikor777,2011-09-20T07:58Z,Everything sceneline puts out is somehow screwed up and will not play directly on my blueray player - most others have no problem.  Something is screwy with these guys - I wish they would fix it.
,chewster,2011-09-27T02:45Z,mantikor777 - why would you be playing these with a bluray player?!  spend $90 on a WDTV box and you'll never have any issues playing these files!

Set in 1961,[4][5] the series centers around the employees (known as Bunnies) of the original Playboy Club operating in Chicago.[6] NBC announced on May 12, 2011 that it had picked up the pilot as a series.[7][8]

The Playboy Club was canceled on October 4, 2011 after airing three episodes.[9][10][11] It was the first cancellation of the 2011â€“2012 television season.[9] NBC continued to film the series until October 10, 2011, hoping to sell the series to another network.[12] Both Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner and show creator Chad Hodge have expressed the hope that the series will be picked up by Bravo.[13][14]

When production wrapped on October 10, 2011, Chad Hodge and Laura Benanti both confirmed that they had finished seven episodes including the pilot.[2] Benanti further stated that the seventh episode has two endings, one of which is more final to the series.[3]
