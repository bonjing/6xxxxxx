From circuit design to finished product â€“ a guide to selecting tools, techniques and components with step-by-step explanations of the essential practical techniques
Product Description
As a step-by-step guide from circuit design to finished product, this practical electronics book actually explains how to select the right tools and components for the job, use a soldering iron, etch a printed circuit board and mount the finished product in a case - and puts skills into practice through simple self-build projects.

Whilst most electronics texts focus on theoretical knowledge, Keith Brindley presents a genuinely 'practical' bench guide and reference for electronics experimenters. The straightforward, interactive style of this book makes it ideal for home electronics work and particularly suitable as an introduction to university lab courses for students who are not familiar with hands-on electronics construction. The book also lends itself as a self-contained resource for secondary school and vocational course classroom projects.

* Master the practical techniques of electronics construction, from using a soldering iron to etching a printed circuit board, and mounting the finished product in a case
* Apply practical electronics skills through a series of simple self-build projects
* A bench reference guide to selecting and using the right tools, techniques and components, whatever your project
