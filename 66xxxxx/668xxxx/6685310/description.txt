Installation:

This is a russian release (the software is ENGLISH), so the /crack directory software is in russian language. I\'ve dissected that piece of software and found nothing peculiar in the code.... if you don\'t speak, read or understand russian, there\'s a english file called CRACK_EN.txt.

This release contains about 120 vendor directories. The previous I released about 107.

Mount image in UltraIso or DaemonTools, installed via AltiumInstaller.exe, replace dxp.exe, edit AD10.ini to the instructions in CRACK_EN.txt, run the (russian software) from left to rigt. The three buttons is \"Read AD10.INI\", \"Create ALF license file\" and \"Exit\"...

Whereas previously there were previous versions use AltiumUninstaller.exe, just might have to hand delete the file C:\\Users\\User_Name\\AppData\\Local\\Altium\\ AltiumInstaller.ini - in Win7, in WinXP you must remove the same file AltiumInstaller.ini, location of a similar, but for XP - a descent can not remember, use the search file. If AltiumInstaller.ini not to remove, then reinstall to begin with the former place.
