,Plutarco90,2011-09-20T02:48Z,Hey fellow... Why do we need a 8GB dvd when ISO weights only 3.8GB? .. is this ISO a compressed file?
,Plutarco90,2011-09-20T02:52Z,why 8GB dvd if ISO is only 3.6GB? .. is this file a compressed ISO?
,sv504,2011-09-20T08:16Z,"Thanks, will share at least 2:1. Instructions aren't completely clear: what filename should the .ALF file get, and where should it be placed? And what's the ""BP"" in point 4?"
,sv504,2011-09-20T08:21Z,"@Plutarco90 - The ISO is 6.7GB, but was RARd before uploading."
,longword,2011-09-20T15:38Z,"@sv504: What do you mean with ""BP""?"
,sv504,2011-09-20T18:23Z,"@longword - in crack_en.txt the 4th point in the install procedure says ""4. Start the BP""."
,zujapan,2011-09-20T22:12Z,"wrong translation

-> 4. Start the AD"
,sv504,2011-09-21T08:16Z,"Thanks, zujapan. Any idea how to name the .ALF file and where to place it?"
,longword,2011-09-23T17:45Z,"@zujapan: Thanks! I'll keep that in mind on the next release.. 

Rest: You can place the .ALF file wherever you want. You have to import the license file to the altium designer license manager. Do this under the menu DXP / My account / Add standalone License File, and select the license file you want to add."
