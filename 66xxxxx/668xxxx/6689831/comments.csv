,FatFreddy33,2011-09-21T13:06Z,"@Master3055 - it was spam, and I'm guessing it was for the PC version...
I have no idea why people come on on an 'xbox' torrent with stuff about the 'pc' game."

You need the original f1 2011.
Hire it from blockbusters to complete your update then you need to reflash your console.
Use hex editor to find your key and it will be in e030 or e040"
