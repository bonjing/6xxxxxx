Donâ€™t just drink beer: Experience it. All of it.
Discover the extraordinary culture and history of brewing: the remarkable craft that reaches back before written history. Visit legendary British pubs now fading sadly into memoryâ€¦and the craft breweries, corporate boardrooms, and home brewers that are the new future of beer. Learn how to tell a great beer from a good oneâ€¦find surprising new research on beer and human healthâ€¦uncover beer in the Bible (and other unlikely places)â€¦and discover divinity and transcendence in your very next brew.

Yes, thereâ€™s more to beer than you ever imagined: It is the most complex, subtle, and remarkable beverage humans have ever created. Its story deserves to be told with love and passion. Charles W. Bamforth brings all that, plus a lifetime of brewing knowledge and wisdom. Read his book, and youâ€™ll agree with Benjamin Franklinâ€™s apocryphal quote: Beer truly is proof that God loves us.
