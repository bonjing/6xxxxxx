STORY
Lucy and Edmund Pevensie return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader. Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarves, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world.

Video
added bit brightness,contrast,sharpness,rgb colours,chroma and denoise. This movie has some intense water/flying scenes along with fog+darkness combined i had to encode some these intense parts with higher bitrate than the rest of the movie. So the main movie parts have bitrate 1800 and the intense scenes have bitrate 2500 to reduce pixelation.

Audio
cleaned the line from lot of hiss,noise and hum, adjusted noticable loudness inbetween the left and the right channel. cleaned the russian track from voice and embedded the line into the russian 5.1 track.
