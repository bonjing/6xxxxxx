,jerkie,2011-02-22T09:53Z,There is no virus - I uploaded the file to http://www.virustotal.com/index.html  (this site checks for the viruses with many commercial anti virus software) and the result is negative.  This free BurnAware is a neat application - I used it to burn DVDs several times now and so far so good.
