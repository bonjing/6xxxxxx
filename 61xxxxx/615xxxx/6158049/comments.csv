These comercials are ATACKING you at the subconcious level. YOU your FRIENDS and your CHILDREN. Do you know that THEY make the shows you watch JUST SO YOU WILL WATCH THE'RE COMERCIALS?  and also did you know That a 30 second comercial costs 100 times more then 30 seconds of the movie ? THEY are CONTROLING YOU."

,Tomskeet,2011-02-08T16:02Z,"Jaydomspacepirate, is a butt pirate. If you don't like them, don't watch them dummy. Sounds to me like YOU are trying to control the way people think by telling them how to feel about commercials. Thanks for this great torrent."
,captainginko,2011-02-09T07:22Z,"@JayDomSpaceIdiot - THEY are controlling us. But they aren't controlling you or your grade 2 spelling and grammar. The word is ""their"" not ""They're""  Commercials. Stupid Dink! Don't watch or download them."
,Euryale,2012-02-07T01:02Z,"No fucking shit, JayDom. That's how the TV industry works. If there were no commercials, there'd be little to no shows. Next you'll be complaining that you have to work to get money. YOUR employers are controlling YOU."
