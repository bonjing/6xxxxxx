Pink Floyd Live in 1971.  Recorded at the BBC Paris Theatre in London.  This is the best bits of two concerts from 16/07/1970 and 30/09/1971.  Full stereo sound, better than Ummagumma in places, this is the peak of Pink Floyd's Space Rock era. Come on EMI get on and release this properly so we can all go out and BUY it!  Tracks are all in WAV format, carefully remastered by ME on Cubase and are as follows:

1. Green is the Colour/Careful With That Axe, Eugene [best live segue ever](10:43)
2. Embryo [the GREAT lost track](10:03)
3. If [rather dull but rare live] (4:27)
4. One Of These Days [barnstorming](6:30) 
5. Julia Dream (2:25) [delicate and utterly beautiful]
6. Fat Old Sun (15:36) [impressively long but lousy quality, sorry]
7. Echoes 25:31 [stunning, just stunning, better than studio version]

Enjoy!
