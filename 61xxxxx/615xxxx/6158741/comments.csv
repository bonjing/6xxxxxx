I'm already quite a long time trying to download this file, however, it stopt at 63.5%. I could really use this book for my reseach, I think its an awsome document! So, is there a way you seed it or just send it to me by mail? That would be awsome! thanks in advance, and all the best. Geert Kooistra, geertkooistra@gmail.com"
