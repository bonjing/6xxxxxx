Only if I delete these files, I'll be able to upload some more and still precious material. In three or four days's time I'll do this to upload different things. So be alert and seed these movies, please. with the restrictive rules of the country given can I see no other solution whatsoever. take care. Let there be a God and help the Japanese. "
,chungwa,2011-04-09T03:39Z,Thanks for sharing these amazing films. I think some of the trouble you are having is due to the lack of compression and resulting file size. Once downloaded these files will take up most of my disk space so I will need to stop sharing fairly soon so I can use my comp again. 
,devrimCHE,2011-04-09T19:54Z,"chungwa, you're welcome. yet the problem is to do with my restricted upload speed, not with compression. you see there are some good-movie freaks (including me) and we'd like to have the movies in full DVDs. that's it, man. otherwise, I am aware of what I upload. anyway, cherish the movies. cheerio.."
,chungwa,2011-04-25T12:56Z,I'm on a ratio of 1.5 and yet can't even get to 100% of disk 1. People need to stay on the line and seed this torrent after snatching it.
