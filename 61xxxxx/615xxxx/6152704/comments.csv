,ZealotFX,2011-02-05T22:57Z,"Very slow download rates for Real Time(6-9kbps), seems that since the show was packed it has lost a lot of downloaders/seeds, but today is rediculous. 
Thank you for your decoding and uploading, hopefully next week rates are better. :-)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T09:12Z,"@ZealotFX: 25400 kB/s is not slow. One need practically ONE MINUTE TO DOWNLOAD WHOLE PACK.

You can be blocked by many or simply have wrong settings."

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T13:54Z,"@hakuna_matata: It is coincidence, not a rule. However, frequently group LOL use same cuts and transport streams as ""p"" versions, from other groups. If somebody need subtitles, those for ""p"" are the right ones, NOT for XviD ones."
