The imagined and imaginary propaganda from Salazarism, during the World War II, preached the achievement of neutrality due to Salazarâ€™s genius. According to this propaganda, which claimed the absence of war in the midst of war, even with the influx of refugees arriving in Lisbon, Portugal was a paradise of peace and tranquility, a â€œpeaceful oasisâ€. That feeling that this propaganda transmitted was from a war that only effected the Portuguese according to its survival difficulties. The propaganda, set to extremes on the â€œJornal PortuguÃªsâ€ chronicles, helped creating a kind of protective unconsciousness that would be funny if it was not tragic.
