                                 About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has reached the stars, joining the vast galactic community of alien 
species. But beyond the fringes of explored space lurk the Reapers, a race of 
sentient starships bent on â€œharvestingâ€ the galaxyâ€™s organic species for their 
own dark purpose.

The Illusive Man, leader of the pro-human black ops group Cerberus, is one of 
the few who know the truth about the Reapers. To ensure humanityâ€™s survival, he 
launches a desperate plan to uncover the enemyâ€™s strengthsâ€”and weaknessesâ€”by 
studying someone implanted with modified Reaper technology. He knows the perfect 
subject for his horrific experiments: former Cerberus operative Paul Grayson, 
who wrested his daughter from the cabalâ€™s control with the help of Ascension 
project director Kahlee Sanders.

But when Kahlee learns that Grayson is missing, she turns to the only person she 
can trust: Alliance war hero Captain David Anderson. Together they set out to 
find the secret Cerberus facility where Grayson is being held. But they arenâ€™t 
the only ones after him. And time is running out.

As the experiments continue, the sinister Reaper technology twists Graysonâ€™s 
mind. The insidious whispers grow ever stronger in his head, threatening to take 
over his very identity and unleash the Reapers on an unsuspecting galaxy.

This novel is based on a Mature-rated video game.

                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is some places where the audio tones out and in. And some places where 
there's maybe a little chop in the sound. Nothing major. It's just in some 
places. The source was like that. So I can't do anything about it.

Enjoy!

Yeah, and the audiobook is split into chapters.
