,Lugubrizione,2011-03-08T18:59Z,"Nice rip, SUCKY movie.

We've seen it all before:
Lovable simpleton charms cynical bastard and together they endure hardships on their way to a happy end.

Sadly, the story is filled with plotholes and unbelievable twists and turns. The ""funny"" stuff has been done before, over and over again.

If you want to smoke a bucketload of weed and need something more than a screensaver to stare at, then maybe this one will meet your needs. Everyone else, stay the heck away from this CRAP."
