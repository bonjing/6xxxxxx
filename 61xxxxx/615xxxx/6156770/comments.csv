,Nukecell,2011-11-27T11:39Z,"Great Collection my friend! I had quite a few of these myself when they came out in paperback. Used to collect them for nearly a decade till water damage took em out, and mold got the rest after. This torrent made my day. Much Thanks!!! You can also read these on your comp with YBook Reader. A nice little bit of freeware with a simple UI"
