,hellobye,2011-02-09T11:03Z,"HR,
Could you please upload my soul to take in ipod version. Thanks in advance."
,KARBANi,2011-02-09T18:08Z,"hey HR, 

Dude seriously, my whole family and I are indebted to your amazing work.  I wish there was something I could do for you in return.  

I wanted to know if there was a way to get the movie poster to show up in itunes for some of your older ipod version movies.  I try attaching artwork but it never ""sticks;"" it gets deleted when I close itunes, and I try doing ""find album artwork"" which retrieves nothing.  Is there anything I can do?  

Thank you for being so dedicated to your fans and staying true to your cause.  I wanted to know if you could also possibly find a film called ""The little traitor."" the IMDb link is: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0818170/

thanks again "
[V],HolyRoses,2011-02-09T20:11Z,"Thanks, but I will not do your film due to it not being new and lack of my interest.

If you want to do something for me then please make the cold weather go away.  You could also give me the winning lottery numbers for next week."

,DFigotin,2011-02-11T02:50Z,"Hey HolyRoses, I was wondering why you never did Lottery Ticket since you want that winning Lottery Ticket. And how come you never did Going the Distance. Im Curious since you did to a crappy movie like Pirranha, Going the Distance wasn't half bad. Me and my girlfriend loved it together, would be nice to watch it via the the apple tv thank you if you choose to do the movies! :)"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-02-11T15:17Z,lottery ticket didn't interest me.  going the distance looked iffy.  ill give it a look.

,BetterThanLife,2011-02-12T13:55Z,"HolyRoses is by far the greatest! It's refreshing to see other people are starting to realize this... and Going the Distance was fairly enjoyable, but I'm a Justin Long fan"

,justneustis,2011-02-19T21:18Z,any chance I can send you a lotto ticket in return for a rip?
,vCJv,2011-02-21T22:41Z,"A* quality as always, thanks.

Just one Q. Is there a big difference between your 2-3GB files, and the 6-10GB files online?

I like good quality picture, and I can't fault your uploads, but wondered if the larger files are worth it."
,ItsNotPro,2011-03-03T08:47Z,"Hey HR thanks for uploading this one in MP4 because most of the movies i like are in .avi and i have a mac and avi wont work on burning it to a dvd and wont play on xbox, just weird noises and a green screen"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-07T02:16Z,"larger file is likely better.  but you will probably not notice the difference.  biggest part of the 5gb file is the dts audio track which is at 1536kbps.  mine only 384kbps dolby digital.  i am satisfied with these, you likely would be too, especially if you owned an apple tv.  then it is a  no brainer."
,ace145876,2011-04-19T19:01Z,thank you so mach man this was great
