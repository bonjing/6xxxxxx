2010 - Inner Firmaments Decay

Ethereal melding with Symphonic Prog is a happenstance that makes this album so much interesting and unique.
All Over Everywhere is a collaboration between Dan Britton (Cerebus Effect, Deluge Grander, Birds And Buildings) and the more classic and folk music influenced female companion Trinna Kesner, who did the main songwritings. The music is floating very well with good melodies and great harmonies. You will not easy find a comparable album of that kind. It\'s pleasing and interesting at the same time.
One negative point is the production style. Do not play this album very loud - headaches are bound to occur: The nice female vocals (Megan Wheatley) are excessively midtone-emphasized and so are some (not all) instruments. Believe me, there is nothing wrong with your amplifier or headphones.
