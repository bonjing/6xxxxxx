,Blitzbok,2011-02-07T20:29Z,"6 Nations? As in the poofs who couldn't even compete at Super rugby level? I agree that Southern Hemisphere Rugby Union is the most brutal sport, particularly the brutal brand the Boks play, but American Football is every bit as entertaining and not that far off the physicality level. For all you Americans, the 6 Nations is known in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia as the tin cup, because it's a competition made up of teams who annually receive a thorough ass plumbing by the three Souther Hemisphere giants. do not take these blowhards seriously. And thanks to the yanks for introducing me to the NFL, haven't enjoyed a sport like this since the late 90s!! Nobody beats America for grandiosity \m/"
,kkbop,2011-02-08T08:00Z,"To steevo-be-thy-name. I have not played rugby or 6 nations, but I have played american football. Also, 4 friends of mine have played both. They all say that american football is rougher. Why do people think that one wears pads and helmets in this sport? Also, one must recognize the fact that american football is more explosive (due to plays/downs) and that rugby has a continuous flow. Therefore rugby does not have as hard hits. But, of course, playing without equipment makes rugby players more injury prone.

One must recognize the fact that doctors call american football a collision sport, and rugby a contact sport.
But, I do like rugby as well."
