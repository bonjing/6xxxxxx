Encoders Notes:
I made a small avs script to crop, resize & sharpen.
I dropped that into vdubmod,
then i lowered the brightness & saturation.
After that i increased the contrast & gamma.
I then changed the colours with a rgb eq.
Finaly i muxed my encode to T0XiC-iNK's line.
Well i didnt crop it too much, as the first bit of the film doesnt have much of a border
but later in the film there is quite alot.
The source was over cropped so parts of thier heads are missing.
Its also a bit blurry.
Overall its watchable on your laptop/p.c screen but prety poor on your t.v.
Hopefully a better video source comes along soon.
Enjoy another Kingdom Release.
