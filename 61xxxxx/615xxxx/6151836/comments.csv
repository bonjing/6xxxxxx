,kurei604,2011-02-06T19:02Z,"its asking for product code, can anyone help?"

,Dvanson00,2011-02-13T20:18Z,Need key code. Won't let me continue install without it.
,banxii,2011-02-18T23:42Z,hey what is the product code?
,keeper33,2011-02-19T05:40Z,"Don't use the autorun/setup.exe, it installs a bonafide virus as you open it (some sort of trojan), and it doesn't work anyway, it'll load up Steam and ask for a key. Use ""Installer.exe"" on the image instead.

How'd a SKIDROW release let this go through? That's pretty weak."
,banxii,2011-02-19T17:04Z,Ok now it worked I just got 1 problem... it says that the ?getNumPromotionInfos@CvGlobals@@QAEHXZ could not be located in the dynamic link library CvGameCoreDLLFinal RElease. dll . I like to know who can I fix this?

Caught by AVG."
,Blacklordheaven,2011-02-26T12:42Z,"What kind of an upload is this? Why would you separate the ""essential files"" from the image? This makes no sense. 
I can't get it to work either way :/"
,DiogoSwan,2011-02-27T16:09Z,"""3. Install""

Yeah, it's easy to say! How can I install it if it needs an ACTIVATION CODE? Please, someone tell me what's the damn code!"
,LordRaz12,2011-03-01T07:08Z,"I'm getting a message when I try to install saying:

The installer failed due to an internal error:
00050000

Make sure you have all the required files and have the neccessary permission to install them.


I've run as Administrator in Windows Vista but that didn't change anything. I'll try redownloading, maybe something got corrupted. Let me know if there's a solution to the problem."

I redownloaded and the problems gone. Thanks for the upload man; and the speed. Downloaded the entire 3Gb in 40 minutes. Damn."
