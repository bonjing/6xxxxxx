The Killing S01 E05 E06 = Day 5 & 6 (of 20) I am missing the first four episodes  myself.  Anyone know where to find them?

Sarah realises that Nanna's friend Lisa may know more than she has let on, and something indicates that investigators ought to focus their attention in a different direction. Things are looking up for Troels and his political campaign, which advisor Rie is trying to control with an iron fist. But his hardships may not be over just yet. Pernille deals with her grief in her own way, while Theis finds it hard to hold himself together.
