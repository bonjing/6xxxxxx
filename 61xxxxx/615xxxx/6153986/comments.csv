,Frice,2011-02-06T08:24Z,Disabling comments is a good idea. To many trolls out there that are content to ruin fights.

,Frice,2011-02-06T09:23Z,"@ Heretikos
Live streams are shit quality and thats a fucking dumb suggestion. 
Go elsewhere because one asshole-troll needs to shit on everyones day.
That means he would win.

Anyone to comment that this is the full, real deal event? I hope it is since I'm going to be waiting a while. Anyways thanks a lot DibyaTPB!

Cheers"
,Frice,2011-02-06T10:26Z,"99% sure this is legit. 
The single fight (silva.belfort) vid he posted was decent. 
(a-8.v-7)

No seeds though cuz of the high demand."
,Boovan,2011-02-06T10:41Z,"max speed i got so far is 70 kb/s... anyone comment yet on the quality and the completeness of fights? hope it has all the prelims from spike and the ppv fights to include the main event big three fights... Thanks again for the upload, however slow it may be... "
,Boovan,2011-02-06T10:43Z,"oh, this is off-topic, but does anyone update tracker to try and increase their speed?"
,Rivven,2011-02-06T11:09Z,"Alot of the time most of the prelims are separate from the main downloads, they usually pop up online by the time the main cards are underway.

Speed is bouncing around 80 kB to 350 kB, probably be done in 1.5 hours. Will Seed 5x or more though.

Thx Uploader."
,Boovan,2011-02-06T11:12Z,"oh snap, full show is upped on torrentday dot COM by the Lord of uploaders - FREAK!!! That place is the fastest and most trusted.. LOL 2 seeds and I'm still going twice as fast on their pvt trackers !

,accolyte,2011-02-06T15:46Z,Deathtrooper30: BREEDING. If you're going to ridicule a persons intelligence at least spell correctly.   
,Heretikos,2011-02-06T17:25Z,"@ Frice I'm dumb for suggesting a stream not to have it ruined?! Wow, I actually saw it live on regular PPV. Any real MMA fan would rather watch live. You are a loser man. You don't even have $10 to go get a beer and watch it at BW3's or hooters? What a fucking loser. Don't even have 5 friends to chip in $10 to watch live? You're a loser man. Don't call me dumb because I like to watch the shit live. Loser. "
,Heretikos,2011-02-06T17:27Z,"HA HA Price, I saw your starcraft uploads... No wonder.... You're too much of a nerd to actually go out and watch it. And not really a big enough MMA fan to want to see it live. What a loser. "
,gellis2010,2011-02-06T18:58Z,Dont read the comments until you have watched the event!!!! It really is not that fucking hard. 
,kyler274,2011-02-06T19:00Z,Heretikos needs to close his cum dumpster mouth and worry about himself...I would like to see a live fight between me and him
