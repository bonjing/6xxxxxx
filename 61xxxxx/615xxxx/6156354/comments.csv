,bintish,2011-04-13T11:02Z,Hi there why won't any of your torrents start uploading? I'm a registered user.  Am I doing something stupid?
,bintish,2011-04-13T11:23Z,Sorry if I'm repeating myself but my comment seems to have disappeared.  I'm having trouble downloading any of your torrents which just won't start.  Was wondering what I'm doing wrong?
