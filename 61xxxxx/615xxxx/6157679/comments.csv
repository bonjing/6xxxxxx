Only if I delete these files, I'll be able to upload some more and still precious material. In three or four days's time I'll do this to upload different things. So be alert and seed these movies, please. with the restrictive rules of the country given can I see no other solution whatsoever. take care. Let there be a God and help the Japanese. "
,chungwa,2011-04-09T16:21Z,"I have thought about compressing it to 3 avi files, but the dvd has some nice features that allow you to watch the films in different programme streams and that would be lost. 
It's therefore a nightmare to share. I've got one of the 3 disks and already my HD is full, nobody is downloading it so I can't get a good ratio, offload the first disk and start downloading the next one. 
This a great DVD set and costs only ĂÂŁ18 on Amazon, which is a very good price given that it is on 3 DVDs and contains amazing films. "
,overlookhotel,2011-11-28T22:13Z,how on earth did you manage to rip the DVD? i've always had problems ripping BFI discs - they are the only ones that none of the ripping software i know can do. any tips graciously received!
,cinesimon,2012-04-27T06:22Z,"Hello, could someone please help me convert these 3 VIDEO_TS files to .iso?  It is incompatible with DVD Shrink, an 'invalid data' error comes up.
What software will successfully convert these either to .iso or .img? 
Either to DVD5, or uncompressed - I have DVD9s I can use - but there should be enough of a bit-rate to shrink to DVD5 without image degradation.

Anyway - I look forward to someone helping me(and others, I'm sure) out."
