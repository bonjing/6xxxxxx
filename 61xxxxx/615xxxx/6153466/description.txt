World oil markets and their structure.

In this edition of On the Edge, Max discusses world oil markets and their structure with the English energy analyst and consultant, Chris Cook. Cook believes that the current rise in oil prices is because many funds and investors have took out their capital from the dollar market and invested it in the oil market. He says if it was not for this matter the current price of oil would be no more than 50/60 dollars. He promotes a new market structure in which there is no middleman and producers and consumers are linked directly. He says in this system the middlemen turn into service providers and it benefits them in the sense that they do not risk their own capital. He claims that the idea of the Iranian Oil Bourse is his.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
