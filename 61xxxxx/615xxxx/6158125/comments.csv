,bposaune,2011-02-08T05:44Z,I'm getting no sound.  I hear sound during the intro but no sound when you actually start the game.  Any ideas?

Also just click the magnet link and then update the trackers, that's what i did."

,BigSkip21,2011-02-08T16:22Z,"Thks, does work but the mouse control makes the game worth not playing, but might be my memory as my lap top only supports 2meg.  Thks again guys!"
,Strikefear13,2011-02-08T17:48Z,"Yeah, I'm going to have to wait for some patches.  Mouse lag is killing me in this game."
,dsafjaly69,2011-02-08T19:04Z,"Game works fine,  but equipping the heath packs and right clicking a character to heal them doesn't work, contrary to the tutorial. So, I CAN play the game but can't heal my characters. Glitch? "
,ViSKo0,2011-02-08T22:40Z,Same heal bug here! 
,SBL,2011-02-08T23:17Z,"ain't a heal bug...

first aid kit don't heal you, just stops you from bleeding (check the char icon, after getting damage it will splash ""blood"", after first aid used, will stop"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-08T23:20Z,"not sure bout the healing yet, but i cant right click, drag over enemies to select them. i right click and i drag, i get the red box, but it does not EVER select ANY of the enemies. when i get hit/injured i'll attempt to heal myself and try to remember to post back about it. as for mouse lag, i dont get any. perhaps the ppl with it need better computers, or a few upgrades? or it's a compatibility issue."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-08T23:47Z,the healing doesn't work either :( hopefully some patches will be released soon enough. without being able to heal it's kinda not worth playing. i mean you can get so far but im pretty sure at some point your health will get pretty low.
,bposaune,2011-02-09T01:04Z,"I'm getting no sound. I hear sound during the intro but no sound when you actually start the game. Any ideas?

Not a computer issue cuz I hear sound during the intro.  I think it's the software."
,lostlegends,2011-02-09T02:06Z,The healing does work. If you use the Doctor! other chars can just patch wounds. the doctor heals. If you look at your chars in the bunker it shows you the skills they have. Also before others start complaining levels dont work. Once you are in the bunker you have too choose the chars to go on a mission before the start can be clicked.
,lostlegends,2011-02-09T02:09Z,Healing works use the doctor! Right click works hold shift as well!
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-09T08:35Z,"@lostlegends so you're telling me that the first guy you start out as, cannot heal himself? i mean i even grabbed a med pack (no options to play as other characters yet), and the game told me to equip the med-pack as a weapon and click on the character i wish to heal. so that guy cant heal himself, even though the game tells me he can????? then wtf are the med-packs i grabbed for? i have to save those till i reach a bunker?

also, the game tells me that i can select multiple enemies at a time to attack by right clicking and dragging the cursor over enemies, this also DOES NOT WORK. can you explain that to all of us?"
,lostlegends,2011-02-09T11:15Z,"@FuCtUpPuNk hey i didnt write the game :)

quotes from in game help 
""This is a first-aid kit use it to stop bleeding""

""To deal with multiple opponents at once, Hold down the LEFT SHIFT KEY and drag a rectangle around the enemy group with your right mouse button""

""your characters have diffrent abilities that you should make use of"".

To clarify, When you get too the bunker, if you hold your mouse pointer over a character you can see his skills. The starting player has a first-aid skill of almost zero. The doctor you find in the wheelchair at the hospital has almost max first-aid. So the starting player can only stop bleeding with a first aid kit, the doctor can heal health as well. Althought the game says equip first aid pack and right click too heal. You actualy Left click.
To multi select enemys hold left shift and right click drag a box around them. Just right click and drag selects multiples of YOUR characters.
in practice this works well if your using guns, but with melee weapons your character doesnt chase opponents he waits until they get within range.
Hope this hellps Punk.
Got too say for such a small game this one is supprisingly good, and I will be buying it as soon as I can find where too get it. Nice upload Thanks"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-10T03:15Z,"thanks alot bro, i'll have to try that later. i missed the ""hold shift key"" part in game. :)

the med pack thing kinda suxx though, i try using it with my character (starting guy) and nothing happens at all. guess i'll wait till i hit the bunker. thanks again."
,Kimovec,2011-02-10T10:18Z,"It works and the game is great, but mouse is lagging like shit!!! Please Skidrow make some patch!!:)"
,danyzd,2011-02-10T13:05Z,"There is bug in mission when BO must get to the generator. When BO arrived near generator, nothing happens, nothing to click. Is there way to avoid that?"
,danyzd,2011-02-10T13:09Z,"in meantime, game works flawlessly on w7 64.
still waiting for BO generator mission BUG fix...."
,NIZI,2011-02-11T14:04Z,"Hello. Seems like i can't connect to my roommates host on lan and he can't connect mine. There is no firewall at all on either computer and we can browse files on LAN etc no problem. We can see the servers on serverbrowser but while we try to connect the game does nothin, you can only press back. Any solutions to this?"
,rudnir,2011-02-13T23:21Z,"I've had a hard time finding this so there u go: bo genertator bug fix:  ""http://hot+file.com/dl/103733738/664bb4/TDPatcher.zip.html""  (checked legit and works)"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-14T08:18Z,"game seems to be unbeatable. im stuck at the level right after you rescue the guy asleep and weak that was stuck in the crane. the next level i can walk through the fence that you start out right in front of, it looks like that area (on the other side that i can walk to) is supposed to be the end of the level but when you walk through the fence, nothing happens. i have been through the rest of the level and ran out of doors to go through and zombies to kill.

it looks as if im supposed to be able to open a garage door where a car is, with a dead human or zombie under it. but i cant press the button on the wall or do anything else in that room.
if there's something im missing than please fill me in.

BEST DESCRIPTION OF THE LEVEL I CAN GIVE.
you start out in front of a fence that on the other side im pretty sure is the end of the level cause it has the sewer that is already opened. this level has the shooting rang. it also has a garage with a car that has a dead human/zombie under it, in the garage is a button on the wall that looks as if you should be able to press it but i cant. ANY IDEAS?"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-14T08:20Z,shooting range in it******

Just a white browser window with the text: No input file specified. 

Game looks interesting though."
,civoniz,2011-02-21T00:14Z,"As Blaze69 states, just google this hash:

and start the torrent from there.
Thx Blaze69"

ok, so the game itself doesnt seem to start right for me, I meet the requirements and meet no errors,but:
When starting, the game screen just stays black, not even starting the game in safemode, works.
There is sound though, I can hear the opening .wmv and it seems to run, its just all black :)

I'm referring to the Blaze69 one, not extremezone's!

,civoniz,2011-02-21T23:48Z,"/\
All i had to do was wait around 1Â˝ min. for the Opening to finish. Then the game starts normally!
thx."

Ty for the upload."
,Levov,2011-02-25T13:23Z,"When I click either start or join game in the main menu, the game just freezes. Exit works fine.

Please and thank you for the help."
,Levov,2011-02-26T16:33Z,I found that my problem was being caused by my Comodo Security. Setting TD to trusted fixed it.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-25T09:06Z,"ok i uploaded the game too. i also beat it. my upload contains the latest patch, along with the full game. this is the full game too but you cannot beat it due to a glitch/bug in the game that doesnt allow the generator at the army base to be set off when ur character stands next to it. that is fixed in my upload."
