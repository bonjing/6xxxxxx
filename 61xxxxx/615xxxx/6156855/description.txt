I am proud to present to you my album Bloody Love, I have been working on it for quite awhile now on and off since last year. This is not the full album, and I doubt I will release the full album on piratebay, but it may end up here anyways :P
I believe in the right to freedom of music, so therefore I present this as a gift to you, every one of you.  Thanks to all those who made this music happen and Greetz to my fellows over in Myrtle Beach with their new band UnderthecoversMB.  You can find my band page somewhere on m y s p a c e, just type in the artist name. Thanks to Piratebay!
