MashrouÊ¼ Leila is Arabic for Ê»an overnight projectÊ¼ lusting out a microphone, a violin, a bass, two guitars, drums and keyboards. It started out as a music workshop at the American University of Beirut in 2008, an open platform for students of architecture and design, somewhere to experiment with sounds and make things audible. In the various performances, MashrouÊ¼ Leila is a constant attempt to taste and produce, more than happy to harvest anyone from the audience as a guest in their encores. They have performed around Lebanon since 2008, playing in various venues in Beirut. The music in their debut album, released in December 2009 with B-root Productions is a reclamation of the aftertaste; sequel-ing a dose of Beirut. (Adapted from a text by Raafat Majzoub)
