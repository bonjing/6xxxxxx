,Gaijyne,2011-03-18T10:33Z,I don't have problems with this. How come it does not work on yours?
,siupod,2011-03-20T01:22Z,Ya its not showing this save under my saved games. Any ideas?
,Gaijyne,2011-03-21T16:13Z,"Are you really sure that you've put the save file on the following directory:

C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\My Documents\EA Games\Dead Space 2

Note:
Replace [username] with your computer's user name. Mine was C:\Documents and Settings\Gaijyne\My Documents\EA Games\Dead Space 2

I've no problems with this. How come yours doesn't work? This isn't a corrupted file and definitely not fake. This save file was complete. All weapons, suits etc..."
,swarnatpb,2011-05-04T19:14Z,"Same with me, the save game is not working. It is not shown in the game."
,Nightmaker,2012-01-01T15:24Z,Anybody who thinks the savegame is not working... don't load a game but choose newgame+
,AlanCray96,2012-05-21T16:33Z,"wait...so, i have to play it at new game+? in order to try out all the new weapons?"
