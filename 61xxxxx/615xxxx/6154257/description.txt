Put the save file on the following directory:

C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\My Documents\EA Games\Dead Space 2

The "Elite Advanced Suit" has a problem identical to the "Zealot/Security Suit" safe issue. It cannot be kept in the safe at the same time as the "Hacker Suit"; one will be deleted upon equipping the other. In order to get the deleted suit back, you must find its schematic again. So, be warned.

Have fun and enjoy!
