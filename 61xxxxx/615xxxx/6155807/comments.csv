Can I ""produce"" a PDF with AcroX?  I briefly tried some weeks ago and failed.  I quickly concluded that the text file that redirects the program back in on itself hinders my ability to produce pdfs.  Any thoughts or suggestions to remedy this?"

,burrus1,2011-02-16T07:26Z,"I have a question about the hosts file. I watched the video you made about replacing but is that suppsed to be my IP address and the I put activate.adobe.com or is it adobes server's IP? One other thing too...for whatever program it is that you do that for, how do you know the exact URL to put there? Tweet me cause I'm having trouble finding how to message you directly. Thanks"

if you tried with this version: thepiratebay.org/torrent/6179036, then you are using what I am using and it works perfectly. Rip it out, do a search and destroy for all things Acrobat and Reader (don't forget hidden files), run a registry cleaner (hell, run two of them!), reboot, and follow this guy's instructions to the letter."
