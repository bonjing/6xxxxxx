Have not seen it, but thanks for hunting down an oddity."

An absorbing and daring plot and excellent acting in the main roles, including Linda Hayden who was just 15 at the time. Admittedly I think she's gorgeous, but honestly her acting talent really shows here. Shame about the very poor video quality but still worth watching."
