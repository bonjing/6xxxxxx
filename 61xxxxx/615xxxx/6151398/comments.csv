Thanks uploader for all that you do sharing this!"

,nesco1801,2011-03-04T00:36Z,Anthony Wiener - that guy is hella funny
,baybreeze,2011-03-04T08:49Z,"Time Warner Road Runner sent me a warning of infringement by HBO. The only HBO I have is this. Too bad. And by the way in case you wonder how they send the email...you turn on your computer and try to surf and instead a page takes over your browser that is a yellow  with black print letter that states the complaint about my possible p2p sharing and infringement of HBO property,then you have to click okay in order to get the page down so you can browse. The okay is agreeing not to use p2p sharing. Is utorrent p2p ? I've only had roadrunner for 2 weeks. I had ATT for 10 years and never had a warning but the service was terrible."

Time Warner owns HBO.
Time Warner is your new service provider.

Either use an annonymiser or get your internet service through another company.

Preferably both.

Downloading in the USA is just asking for trouble if you are not careful."
