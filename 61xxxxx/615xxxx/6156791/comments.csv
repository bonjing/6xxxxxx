,nedswife,2011-03-03T13:45Z,"Thanks for the upload Bone, nice one.  One question for anyone out there..... I already have some of these items installed as s3pack.  Do I have to physically uninstall them one by one?   I have other CC content in s3pack format, and hardly know which of them is store stuff and which is not.  What should I do?  I do prefer to use the package format."
