This must be one that many people have been looking for. These songs are great in the genre, but they are nowhere on the internet and certainly not ripped like this. I have collected and ripped the cd's myself and they are all in the best mp3 quality: 320 kbps in CBR, constant bit rate. Why upload anything less than the best? Besides, if you want less space you can always convert down to VBR or so. I prefer only this quality and the music deserves it.

Cd's included are:
25th anniversary collection, The Seventies part 1 and 2 and the eighties part 1 and 2
Soul Show Classics volumes 1 and 2
Soul Show cd boxes volumes 1-5

I appreciate comments, to see if all works ok and if you like the music! Please seed!
