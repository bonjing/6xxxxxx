,verritas,2011-02-20T06:31Z,"Hi there, sorry i'm just wandering, how do you 'Mount"" the bin file""

i've never done this before 
thanks!"
,verritas,2011-02-20T06:38Z,"hi can you tell me how to ""mount"" the game file thanks"
,walkerone,2011-02-21T01:16Z,"to verritas: To mount the image, download a mounting program. A good one is here: http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm
1. Download that program.
2. Install the program.
3. Open program and mount the proper file.
4. Open the mounted file (it will be in My Computer) as a CD Disc. 
Hope that helps.
Btw, thanks for upload FuCtUpPuNk."
,JT408,2011-02-21T01:46Z,"hey guys, if anyone is having trouble with the .bin file use this program to convert it to ISO to use with Daemon or whatever you use. just putting this cause i had a problem with it so in case anyone else is here ya go!

,TBSmith,2011-03-06T16:06Z,"Thanks for the torrent, it works great, and feels like a classic torrent. However, I need the crack files again; I was hoping you could create a temporary torrent containing them, and post a link. Thanks again, TBSmith"
,ust2,2011-03-09T08:45Z," Last time I ever burn a game for later use ever, fricken cd's are corrupt after only a year and i'm forced to redownload again anyways!

 rabble! rabble! rabble!

 Thanks for the active torrent everyone, really appreciate it!"
,ust2,2011-03-09T09:15Z," Wickid fast dl speed :D Works as it should too, thx again will seed atleast x2.


 Just like to add a bit of info on a tip given in the comments.

 Daemon tools can mount and read any disc image format.

 All you need to do is while looking for the file to mount, goto the drop down menu the corner and select ""All supported images"".

 You'll be able to see and select it to mount then."
,Dimmis80,2011-03-15T10:56Z,Great speed and its working great to.Thanks dude.
,TheBacon1984,2011-03-15T20:53Z,"I downloaded the direct play version of this and it worked great but as far as I can tell there is no way to install the repec mod,can anyone confirm that the respec mod works with this version? I would like to know before I put anymore time into the game so a quick response would be very much appreciated."
,TheBacon1984,2011-03-15T20:59Z,can anyone confirm that the respec mod works with this version?

,koopatroopa_15,2011-03-20T17:43Z,"This game runs *perfectly* on win7 64bit. I have played whole game through the ""End Boss"".

It is an absolute blast to play. Super mindless fun. 

I found myself taking breaks from Shogun 2 just to play more Torchlight !!!

If you enjoy action rpg then you want this. If you don't enjoy action rpg... Try it anyway. 

An exceptional game that runs perfect. Many thanks to FuCtUpPuNk !!!"
,awza,2011-03-24T11:09Z,"Great torretn, i just have one problem.
Whenver i try to start the game, Steam pops up and asks me to install the demo...
Is there any way to fix this?"
,jztrotter,2011-03-25T09:04Z,"Amazing speed on the download and amazing game quality! Thanks for taking the time to upload this, I'm very impressed!

@awza; I had the same problem at first too, but the fix is easy. Make sure you copy ALL of the files from the 'Crack' Folder into the directory to which you saved the game. This includes the application crack as well as all of the .DLL files. Enjoy!"
,britton27,2011-03-28T06:58Z,"@FuCtUpPuNk: Great upload, nice colorful game. 

Has that Warcraft III meets Diablo II feel. Was so tired of playing Diablo II and this is just what I was looking for to tie me over until Diablo III is released. 

Uploading now along with the other seeders so you should have no problems downloading this. "
,breberaving,2011-04-03T20:36Z,Hey so okay I downloaded it and stuff... but I have no clue what to do next can someone please help me!!!  I tried to extract it with the 7-zip thing but when i try and get the folder it says it cannot open it what do i do!!! HELP ME!!! 
,tzagiii,2011-04-09T21:33Z,"Works great, thanks!
Could've trimmed 200MB by removing useless DX and using ISO instead of bin, but hey, broadband is everywhere nowadays, isn't it?"
,tieten1000,2011-04-10T15:07Z,"I installed everything like everybody says, but when i run the application nothing happens....can anyone help me?"
,rotxam2,2011-04-14T06:47Z,"Hey everyone.   This is on supersale for about $4USD right now.  If you love this game, then you might also get the legit version. :)

,britton27,2011-04-17T09:31Z,"@breberaving and anyone else who can't figure out what to do with the files you downloaded. 

It's really simple, treat the .bin file, which is the bulk of the data in this torrent, as a compressed archive like a .zip or .rar file. I used a program called AlZip to unpack the bin into its own folder. It dumps out yet another torchligh.bin file which you again extract to the same folder your already in. Then it will list out the files that your looking for, the setup, autorun, etc.

Why the uploaded didn't just make an ISO to mount is beyond me. I think you can mount a bin file with Daemon tools but I've never tired it."
,FernFrond,2011-04-22T08:22Z,Got to be one of the greatest games ever. RUns like a charm. TY 
,Biibs,2011-04-30T06:01Z,"So, I've done everything and when I go to open the actual game it doesn't even open up. It attempts to load it but then it doesn't. No errors or anything...help."
,jaded423,2011-05-03T12:37Z,Thanks for all the seeding. Only took 20 minutes to fully download. I will seed until at least 1:1 ratio. I look forward to playing.
,AGHOR,2011-05-04T18:07Z,Superfast download.....great upload
,Lolwtfthatguy,2011-05-15T04:30Z,"Hello there, I am having a problem with the download. I have installed and done everything according to the installation guide, but I can not seem to skip past this error:

Microsoft Visual C+ Runtime Library

Program:F\Games\Runic Games\Torchlight\Torchlight.exe 

abnormal program termination.
---
So yeah, thats the error I get, it only ever occurs when ever I go to the hardness section after the character selection section. But then once I select easy or normal etc, It will then go into the loading screen, but around 5 seconds in, the error pops up and automatically shuts it down when I press ok. So yeah, is this a problem with the game or my machine? Cause I am currently on my crappy vista laptop. 1.7Ghz processor, 2 gig ram, mobile Intel 965 express chipset family integrated graphics card. Yeah, that's just the basics. Thanks in advance."
,vuca89,2011-05-22T17:26Z,"mount with virtual clonedrive 5.4 install

and the last: copy all file in ./Torchlight v1.15\Torchlight\v1.15 Update\crack
to install dir

,squigglesklok,2012-03-09T02:48Z,"If any of you are getting that stupid c+ runtime error try re-downloading the c+ runtime libraries or making sure you have all your windows updates done as you get them that way too. You can also try installing an older version of Direct X like 9.0c as some games need the older files from it as new computers don't have a few bits from 9 and before in their newer DX packages! May sort it out for you if you haven't fixed it already! I spotted this game through the Acer Games browser on me new PC, it isn't freeware though considering its only a small game, looks cool, will DL/Seed and have a go though!"
,squigglesklok,2012-03-09T02:52Z,Oh and this torrent seems to be almost twice the size of the game itself

where EXEMPLE.BIN is the exact path of the .bin file, in that case : torchlight.bin.
