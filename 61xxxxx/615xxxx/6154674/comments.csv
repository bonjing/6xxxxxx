You probably know about this but this anti piracy Cinavia thing on ps3 and some blu-ray players (including mines) prevents audio from playing on Sony Pictures releases. Do you know any way to get by this? thanks"
,Natezzz,2011-02-07T14:51Z,Nevermind I've read your replies on other torrents now. We will just have to wait for someone to come up with a workaround :(
,willyjinkens,2011-02-10T13:36Z,"Another great release, thank you! Just wondering if you were going to do an AVCHD release of Kick Ass?"
,Gemini_69,2011-02-12T18:03Z,Thank you for the release Excellent as always. Does anyone know what the ending notes said?? They Weren't in English
,CRimsonEagleX,2011-02-12T21:40Z,Could I make a request for Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 in bluray!? :P
,lvnitup,2011-03-05T06:48Z,"hi i need help, i'm a bit new to this, i downloaded the the torent and tried burning it with ImgBurn but their is no BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders (as per instructions), only a ISO file? so add the ISO file instead but the disk shows nothing on the disc after the burn but is no longer a blank disc. i've also tried mounting it on MagicISO and it says ""Windows cannot read from this disk. The disk might be corrupted, or it could be using a format that is not compatible with Windows.""
any tip from anyone as it is doing my head in!"

READ the info given by the uploader... magic iso wont work for mounting, you need daemon tools"
