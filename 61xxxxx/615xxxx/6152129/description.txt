Geometry lies at the core of the architectural design process. It is omnipresent, from the initial determination of form to the final construction. Modern geometric computing provides a variety of tools for the efficient design, analysis, and manufacturing of complex shapes. On the one hand this opens up new horizons for architecture. On the other, the architectural context also poses new problems for geometry. The research area of architectural geometry, situated at the border of applied geometry and architecture, is emerging to address these problems.
