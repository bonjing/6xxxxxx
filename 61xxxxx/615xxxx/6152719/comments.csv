,michaelrwatson,2011-02-06T20:09Z,"Ok, so i answer my own question--flicker is not the worst i've seen but is bad in bright scenes, of which there are many. Hence, this is a CAM not a TS. 

Also, there are NO SUBTITLES FOR THE FOREIGN PARTS.  Hence, this is a total waste of bandwidth, unless you like to ruin good movies."
