,PeteGC,2011-02-05T12:39Z,"Thanks Dean. Really appreciate your uploads. Have lived in Madrid for 10 years now. When I first came over, got my brother to tape episodes, VHS, send them in the post - but he understandably soon got tired of doing this..! 
How archaic, mad was that?! Anyway, like I said many thanks. "
