Kahrizak detention center is a detainment facility operated by the Judicial system of Iran in southern Tehran.

Authorities first made plans for the Kahrizak detention center in 2001. 

The center's cells, located underground, were apparently built without free access to fresh air and toilet facilities.

Reports of inhumane treatment of the prisoners at Kahrizak were released, with some comparing the conditions there unfavorably to even the notorious political ward 209 of Evin prison. 

Opposition groups have published unverified reports of human rights abuses and as many as 28 deaths inside the prison during the years 2007 and 2008.

The release of some prisoners from Kahrizak on July 28, 2009 was followed by a number of testimonials in the foreign and opposition press on conditions inside the prison. 

Various news articles have reported on cramped and squalid cells where prisoners were routinely verbally abused and beaten by guards, some to death.

The crimes were so grave that even several well known conservative politicians like Ali Motahhari expressed concerns about them.
