,D-RAWKCITY,2011-02-06T20:16Z,Mr. Basil...  the last series was amazing and i would love to see the new one.  could you keep posting these please/thanks.
,BasilBrush,2011-02-20T02:07Z,"All 25 episodes in Xvid and 720p HD are currently being seeded.

You'll find all the torrents at MVGroup and cross posted to Demonoid. The HDTV torrents are also being cross posted slowly to eztv.
eztv also has all the Xvid cross posted.

The easiest place to get them from is forums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org
You have to signup but the torrents are free.

All the subtitles are also available for the Xvid - the 720p has them already merged into the MKV files."
