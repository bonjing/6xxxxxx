i recorded this film off my t.v years ago then i copied it to dvd then uploaded it the quality i think is good considering and as far as i know it cant be got on dvd it has not been released by mgm. anyway it stars david janssen as a cop who is kidnapped by 3 teenagers one who is a girl who fancies him, there is a huge forrest fire later as one of the teenagers discards a cigarette, i have watched this film since i converted it and i think the quality is good, it wont spoil your enjoyment, as i am new to converting and uploading i dont know how to edit so there is 2 episodes of the fugitve season 4 on the end of this film so maybe someone can edit it and re upload it or the episodes
