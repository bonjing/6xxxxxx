,AtheneWon,2011-02-06T03:05Z,How come there's no comments? Is this legit or not?
,AtheneWon,2011-02-06T05:02Z,"Okay, well, I downloaded it and it's awesome. Seeding."

+1 from me. Looking forward to more torrents from you.

,Rapier_Wit,2011-02-07T15:18Z,Anyone tried this on a PS3? Most of the BD rips of this have Cinavia copy protection and PS3s crap out during playback. Thanks for any info.

,MkVMe,2011-02-09T05:00Z,Thanks a ton DiNoDoOp! I'll be sure to release more BRRIPS with compact size and high quality.
,Etariplol,2011-02-12T20:24Z,"At first, I discarded this torrent as a fake, because it claimed to be a 720p rip of a 2 hour movie, in only 570 MB. Then I read the comments and though ""heck, let's try it out!"".

After watching it I must say: MkVMe! You're my hero. How you managed to put that awesome quality into such a small file is beyond me! Keep up the good job! I've already bookmarked you and looking forward for more :-)"
,MkVMe,2011-02-13T03:40Z,"Thanks Etariplol, I wont disappoint you!"
,ddn7,2011-02-14T20:18Z,This is awesome quality. Man upload more movies with such great quality and small size. But I wanted to know which software you use coz i want to use it to upload some cool stuff.
,MkVMe,2011-02-14T20:44Z,"Check out my other torrents, all small size and high quality.

This quality is TOPS. Great download, and much thanks to MkVMe."
,reach,2011-02-14T22:36Z,"Sometimes it's really hard to find a trustworthy source but take it from me, Mr. Critical of everything:

This quality is TOPS, especially for the size. Great download, and much thanks to MkVMe."
,MkVMe,2011-02-14T23:14Z,"Thanks reach, I appreciate that! :)"
,ddn7,2011-02-15T17:34Z,MkVMe I want to know which software i can use to convert my videos to MKV format with high quality and small size before i upload. Thanx.
,MkVMe,2011-02-15T17:53Z,"I use handbrake, but you can use MeGUI or anything, you just need to tweak the settings to your likings.  Do tests with a small HD video and keep retesting until you get that small size and quality you want."
,AmonGoethh,2011-02-17T01:43Z,Your wonderful! All your uploads live up to my expectations. Please keep up the good work.
,Stormy4757,2011-02-21T02:00Z,What are you all using to convert this? I have ConvertXtoDVD4 and it started out fine but then hung up with a few minutes left. My computer is brand new with Windows 7
,OrpheusDude,2011-02-22T04:56Z,"Sorry to spoil the party, but the audio is basic 2.0 stereo.  When the hell is someone going to post a good DVDR of the commercial DVD (not a screener) with proper 5.1 Dolby?  It would be a small miracle if the second disc of extras was made available too."
,doron_doritus,2011-02-22T05:04Z,"Screenshot links not working, but the quality really rocks! Thx man!"
,thezffz,2011-02-24T02:54Z,"Worked great, but after i downloaded i soon got an email from my ISP and Dtec Net Sony Antipiracy

DO-NOT-DOWNLOAD"
,limeguy,2011-02-25T13:34Z,"^That's your fault for not using BASIC bittorrent encryption. Every good client has a way to encrypt your connection so that it looks like, say, Skype video traffic (which happens to be encrypted.)

So, blame yourself for getting DMCA'd. It's your fault you downloaded it anyhow."
,ForAnAngel,2011-03-01T01:48Z,The video looks okay but the sound is pretty bad. Only 48 kb/s!

,bdummer88,2011-03-04T22:21Z,"I've tried achieving the same kind of quality at this file size using some of my bd's in handbrake, but I don't seem to be able to achieve anywhere close. Any chance you could share your settings? Maybe export your preset so others can use it."
,Xlemonad,2011-03-06T23:08Z,"Terrible quality, pixelated and jerky picture. What's the point in making 720p rips with such a low bitrate? High resolution alone doesn't make for a good viewing experience. I'd rather choose an 700 meg Xvid/.avi rip over this any day. I don't get you people..."
,bdummer88,2011-03-08T00:00Z,"I do not agree with Xlemonad. I did not find this video to be choppy and detail was far better than the SD releases I have found so far. The closest I found was an SD which was 1.2 gb. This one is only 577 mb.

Also, watching this on my computer, I had no idea that the audio bitrate was so low. I didn't react at all and was quite surprised when I discovered it, so no reason for concern there.

Great work."
,MkVMe,2011-03-10T02:03Z,"Thanks bdummer88!

It's just haters, obviously they know nothing about encoding.  Do a side by side with this and a 2.8gb 720p release and tell me this doesn't look almost exactly the same."
,ho3in.h.n,2011-03-12T17:37Z,"Hi Mr MKVMe , I need two movie ! Can you insert them for me Please ?

a/v:8/10"
,MaximilianKohler,2011-03-31T01:55Z,ty so much MkVMe!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,chicalleje,2011-04-12T07:25Z,"Amazing quality, I still can't believe it. 

Maybe you can make your rips 600mb-650mb and give more bitrate to the audio or maybe even put a 5.1 at 700mb. 

I will try to rip some stuff using your settings on this movie, they are incredible. Please, keep teaching us what a good ripping is. "

,NimRoddos,2012-04-01T14:56Z,"Man what a quality !!

48 kbps (VORBIS) is far better than 320 kbps (MP3)

now that some encoding !!

great work dude"
