Hodgepodge collection from various sources and in various qualities, from 64kbs to 320kbs, even at least one flac thrown in. While I appreciate the effort to combine them all to mimic the collection, it would be nice if it was actually described as such. And it's also being tracked like it was the real deal."

,platonios,2011-08-10T07:03Z,"@ScubaGolfJim : unfortunately you are right.

@roadrunnerside8 : thanks for the try but the quality is not good."
