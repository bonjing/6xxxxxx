It was inevitable that a comedy about a Jamaican bobsled team would have a reggae soundtrack. What is surprising is that it is so enjoyable in a light, unforced way. Worl-A-Girl note the unlikeliness of Jamaica having a bobsled team; Diana King covers Bob Marley's "Stir It Up"; and Wailing Souls cover Talking Heads' "Wild Wild Life." Best of all (if somewhat redundant), Jimmy Cliff got his first chart hit in 23 years with a cover of the 21-year-old "I Can See Clearly Now," by Johnny Nash. ~ William Ruhlmann
