From Wiki:


Silverchair is an Australian alternative rock band.[1] The band formed as Innocent Criminals in Merewether, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, in 1992, with their current lineup of vocalist and guitarist Daniel Johns, bass guitarist Chris Joannou, and drummer Ben Gillies. Silverchair has been highly successful in the Australian recording industry, receiving the industry's flagship awards, the ARIA Awards, a record 21 times.[2] The band has also received six APRA Awards.[3][4]

They got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by SBS TV show â€œNomadâ€ and Triple J. The band was soon signed by Murmur, and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages. In 2003, following the release of Diorama, the band announced a hiatus, during which time members recorded with side projects The Dissociatives, The Mess Hall, and Tambalane. Silverchair were reunited at the 2005 Wave Aid concerts, and went on to release Young Modern and play the Across the Great Divide tour with Powderfinger.

Silverchair's sound has evolved throughout their career, differing sounds on specific albums steadily growing more ambitious over the years, from grunge on their debut to their more recent orchestral prog-infused chamber-pop. The songwriting and singing of Daniel Johns has been noted as improving steadily while the band has developed an increased element of complexity in later works. Silverchair have sold in excess of six million records to date.








Frogstomp 1995


Frogstomp is the debut album of Australian rock band Silverchair. It was released in Australia in early 1995, when the members were only 15 years of age, by a subsidiary of Sony Records and reached number one on the album charts. On 20 June 1995, Frogstomp was released by Epic Records in the U.S. and has been certified double platinum.

The album's recording process was quick because all of the songs had been written since 1992. Silverchair originally wanted Nick Launay to produce Frogstomp but he was unavailable. They revealed in a January 1995 interview with Smash Hits magazine that their the album was to be named Llama's Revenge.[1]This title was dropped in favor of Frogstomp, in homage to a Floyd Newman song from the 1960s. Singer Daniel Johns was familiar with the song. The album name may also have been inspired by Frogstomp preschool in Newcastle, which the band members attended as young children.

The liner notes state that "no llamas were harmed in the making of this album" and "apologies to Toad the Wet Sprocket". The booklet contains pictures of the frog on the album cover in different colors to represent the band members.

The record stands as a testament to Silverchair's initial Grunge musical style and the vast, striking difference between the rock music of Frogstomp and the orchestral fusion experimentalism of later works such as Diorama (2002) divides fans. However Frogstomp, both as a lone work and in the context of Silverchair's career, remains one of Australia's most nationally successful albums, and arguably the most popular post-grunge album from an Australian group.

Due to the album's status as a monument to their grunge-influenced teenage years, the band choose to ignore a majority of the tracks on this album during recent live sets in favour of the more original and stylistically diverse music written later in their career. Johns has admitted to disowning Frogstomp and its successor Freak Show, claiming that they were not written by Silverchair but by "their high school band". He has also admitted that the anger seen on those two albums is not how he wants to write anymore because of the lack of anger at his age.

Neon Ballroom 1999


Neon Ballroom is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair and was released on 8 March 1999. The album is certified Gold in the United States and contained the singles "Anthem for the Year 2000", "Ana's Song (Open Fire)", "Miss You Love", and "Paint Pastel Princess".

Neon Ballroom was an overhaul of the band's musical style found on its first two albums, Frogstomp and Freak Show. "Anthem for the Year 2000", for example, retained much of the band's youthful rock energy but featured a new rock song structure and various electronic effects. Eight years after the album's release, Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns would say: "To me, I honestly feel like our first record was Neon Ballroom. I've never felt any different. I don't feel like our first two albums were Silverchair: that's our teenage high school band. I don't like them at all. I listen to them and go, 'That's cute', especially the first one, because Frogstomp we were 14. But the second one we're like 16, I'm like 'You're getting older. You're running out of chances'".[3]

"Spawn" was first released on the 1997 soundtrack to the film Spawn. This particular version is a remix of the original version; hip-hop group Vitro added various electronic bleeps and blips to the song. However, the origin of "Spawn" dates back to 1996 when it was originally recorded for inclusion on Freak Show but was later omitted. The Pre-Vitro mix of "Spawn" is not the Freak Show version but a later version recorded when the band demoed tracks for Neon Ballroom. The Pre-Vitro version is also notable because it lacks an entire verse pertaining to "animal liberation". This version was included on the Neon Ballroom Limited Edition bonus disc, The Best of Volume 1 (2 Disc Limited Edition) in 2000, and the Rarities 1994 - 1999 compilation in 2002. The recording of "Anthem for the Year 2000" is slightly different on the Australian release than the one found on all other releases (including singles).

"Satin Sheets" was originally called "Punk Song #3" and "Paint Pastel Princess" was "All the Same to Me". "Emotion Sickness", "Ana's Song (Open Fire)", and "Miss You Love" are on The Best of Volume 1. An acoustic remix of "Ana's Song" was released on the Best of disc that also included the Rarities bonus. Eight tracks from Neon Ballroom appear on Live from Faraway Stables.

The album has been released in a double pack along with Freak Show. Johns wrote all the songs on the album except for "Spawn Again" (Johns-Gillies). The vinyl version of the album was limited to 5,000 copies worldwide.

Diorama 2002


Diorama is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair. Released on 31 March 2002 by record label Eleven, the album was co-produced by Daniel Johns and David Bottrill. While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands, Diorama marked the first production credit for lead singer Johns.

Johns wrote most of the album at the piano instead of his usual guitar, while the band took a 12-month break following their previous studio album, Neon Ballroom. Silverchair worked with composer Van Dyke Parks on Diorama; the album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads, a change from the post-grunge music typical of their earlier work. The album's title refers to "a world within a world".[11] Five singles were released: "The Greatest View", "Without You", "Luv Your Life", "Across the Night" and "After All These Years". All except "After All These Years", a promotional single, appeared on the Australian singles chart.

Diorama was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band's earlier albums. It reached number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart and received a 71% rating on review aggregator Metacritic. It was certified triple-platinum by ARIA, selling in excess of 210,000 copies, and won five ARIA Awards in 2002. Diorama was nominated for "Highest Selling Album" in 2003, and three songs from the album were nominated for awards over the two years.
