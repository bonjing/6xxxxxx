"Grossman has spent so many years producing videos and how to books on 

acoustic guitar, it's hard to think of him as a guitarist himself, which is why 

albums like this are so valuable and reassuring. Grossman can back up 

everything he says and believes musically, with an encyclopedic knowledge 

and feel for country-blues, rags, and fiddle tunes as demonstrated here. He 

runs through a gaggle of fine-sounding instruments, alternating between slide, 

12-string, and fingerpicked six-strings in a plethora of tunings, and never fails 

to deliver top-notch playing on every track. A must-have for folk-blues guitar 

enthusiasts. "
