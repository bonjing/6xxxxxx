,Kennyg22,2011-03-02T05:15Z,Does this work without the CD
,noobst3R,2011-03-04T22:14Z,of course. :)
,films_uk,2011-03-09T08:18Z,"noobst3r, have downloaded your games and they work just fine.  Only one error went in, a missing or corrupt file in legend, but the game plays just fine.
May I ask if you pre cracked these games yourself?  If so, may I ask how?  and also I like your menu, have been trying to find a program that makes just the menu you have, may I ask what program you used.  "
,aylinstr,2011-03-26T13:45Z,I can't download torrent when I click there :O
,Zannafar,2011-04-03T19:11Z,This Pack includes Stronghold Warchest?
,Zannafar,2011-04-03T19:24Z,This Pak includes Stronghold Warchest?
,Zannafar,2011-04-03T19:27Z,"Sorry by doublepost
My browser hates me : ("
,noobst3R,2011-04-04T18:58Z,"There isn't much to say about the cracking, but you can make menus in simple code like Visual Basic or C#. You should try Visual Studio by Microsoft, google is your best friend when you need something about code.

I think Warchest is a collection of some of the games included, so yes. This contains every Stronghold game released to date.

Also, sorry about the title being cut off, but my browser hates me, and the Torrent editing function is broken, just like the link, but in the second comment there is a link. :)"
,Bunseth,2011-04-09T05:56Z,Nice!
,Bspar12,2011-05-05T03:22Z,how do u get a rar file to work? x.x
,noobst3R,2011-05-28T23:16Z,"Open it with WinRar: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm

Or install some other program that supports .RAR"
,TheOriginalDaniel,2011-08-06T12:54Z,I'm downloading now using the link in the comments getting a fluxing but decent speed of like 500-850kb/s when my normal max speed is 2.5mb/s anyway keep seeding folks! and greetings from Australia :P turns out the Stronghold Collection isn't allowed to be released outside the us and the original trailers claimed world wide release available Last Year >:( so since i couldn't buy it anywhere online i thought Screw them for not allowing the rest of the world these awesome games :)
,meridianas,2011-09-03T18:45Z,"noobst3R it's great what you have maked. But I'll try to wait this: https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=59107
