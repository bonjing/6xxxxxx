,Kaikelx,2011-03-16T14:03Z,"A screen for step 4 would be very helpful actually XD.

One question, the files in the (Crack) Data folder, do the go along side the files in the original data folder, or replace them completely? I think that may be our problem."
,ugur3D,2011-03-16T18:40Z,"Okay i will upload screenshots for better understanding

,jack1993,2011-04-13T11:45Z,"Do not copy the whole Crack folder into the installation directory...
Only copy the map thats in it.
Called: Data
when you want to copy that folder he askes if you still want to move or replace the folder... 
Click yes to all"
,ugur3D,2011-04-13T18:26Z,"Jack 

Did the game worked for you?"
,HK88,2011-05-01T00:55Z,"What you gotta do is go into the ""Crack"" Folder then into the ""Data"" Folder within that. Copy all the files in this folder.
Next go to where you installed RA3. In this directory open the folder ""Data"""
,HK88,2011-05-01T00:57Z,and paste all the files into here. Just click yes to all when it asks if you wanna replace existing files.
