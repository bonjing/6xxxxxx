When Henry Malloy, one of Detroit's respected philanthropists and humanitarians, is found shot in his car moments after receiving the key to the city, Fitch is targeted as the main suspect. Even as Special Agent Jess Harkins interrogates the members of the squad about Fitch's possible involvement in the headline-making crime, Fitch and Washington are busy investigating a bizarre case... Three murder victims are found on a public bus with thousands of dollars floating around the crime scene. But the case takes an even stranger turn when the detectives try to track the money, find the missing bus driver, identify the victims and discover a kidnapping gone awry. Will Fitch's usual no-holds-barred effort be enough to bring the murderer to justice? And what will Harkins' investigation of the driven homicide veteran uncover?
