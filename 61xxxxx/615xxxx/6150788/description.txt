The first of three short films, to be released this year. These movies give further insight into the concept of Within Temptation's fifth studio album "The Unforgiving" and are based on the comic storyline; the characters are impersonated by actors. Each film is followed by a band performance that, all together, form a dark and compelling tale of life, love, revenge, rage, and regret. The first movie, titled "Mother Maiden", ties in with the band's first single & video for 'Faster', introducing the main characters of the narrative
