This is a total conversion Doom II channel which makes it look like Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64. It changes everything: levels, weapons, enemies, sounds, music and more. You do not need the original Doom 2 to play this as it will run on it's own. The 001.app in the wad has been converted for use on the GP32 by Will Schaller (mr twit). The Goldeneye 007 banner and sound was made by Tichinde925.
