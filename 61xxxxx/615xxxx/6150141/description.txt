"Shit-kicking honky-tonk... Leaving, TX bristles with raw emotional energy." - Raleigh Independent "Compared favorably to Drive By Truckers, Reckless Kelly, and Steve Earle... And not without good cause." - Maverick Magazine "One of the strongest contenders to emerge on the alt.country scene in years." - Ontap Magazine Gripping vocals, intelligent lyrics, and songs filled with memorable hooks are what you will find with the LEAVING, TX. This original alt.country outfit delivers a clever blend of cutting edge twang-rock mixed with a healthy dose of raw, whiskey-soaked country. The band is driven by songwriter Chris Patterson's rugged, in your face vocal style, ripping telecasters and sweet pedal steel... All anchored by a tight, driving rhythm section. This powerful group of musicians allow Patterson's songs to really shine.
