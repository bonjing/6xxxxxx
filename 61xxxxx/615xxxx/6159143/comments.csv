,traineetorrent,2011-02-08T16:04Z,"@rickyno1

this episode of raw is good"
,the-dude1982,2011-02-08T16:52Z,"rickyno1 grow up.
I didnt spoil the Royal Rumble results.
I excited to see Booker T & Diesel.
But the next time i swaer to god if you act like kids i'm gonna spoil..so GROW UP...peace."
,the-dude1982,2011-02-08T17:50Z,"LOL i don't & won't spoil PPV matches,of course i know who won the matches the day before the PPV's but i don't post the results like the other jerks do here on.
But @rickyno1 likes to insults alot to others when they're excited to see something unexceptable.
@ rickyno1 what's the deal,i'm not arguing with you or anything,i didn't spoil the result last week & told you who won cause i'll be JACKASS if i spoiled alot...all i wanna say is don't insult unless it's spoiler alert PPV & peace :)"
,rickyno1,2011-02-08T20:03Z,did i say you posted a spoiler the dude. for your info there as been a lot of spoilers on wrestling torrents over the last month on pirate bay and my comment concerns all of them. not just yours.
