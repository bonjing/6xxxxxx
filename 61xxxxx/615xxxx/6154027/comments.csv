,dark_defender,2011-02-06T10:48Z,Oh man..Not again this minus bullshit fucked-heads. Arrhhh
,bender1110,2011-02-06T12:38Z,"yawn - 20/40 - says more about the stupid haters than it does about you.

DEAR IDIOTS: If you think the size is too small for you (quality wise) - WHY DO YOU EVEN COME HERE?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T13:23Z,"You get things wrong. It's not about loonies, I couldn't care less for getting minuses from personification of minuses.

It is, totally, about full swarms (at least hundredth of people) on all my torrent this morning - who have loaded my torrents, dozens have finished downloads - but calmly watched how minus rating grows.

It about so called ""normal"" people, to whom I made perfectly clear what would happen if they allow to be over-voiced by raging and rabid lunatics.

It's about dignity too, if someone knows full meaning of that word."

It's about this site, where hundredths of VIP and other uploaders get minuses for good or perfect uploads. Quality rating button is just a sand-box for crazies, nothing more. Anyone who defends such Rating should insert a direct link from all pages on TPB to some MPAA agency - result is the same... and should start to visit some good psychiatrist even before...

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T13:35Z,"First Comment was from IE, second one from Firefox, there are differences."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T13:58Z,@doyll: Fourth paragraph.
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T14:10Z,"@doyll: ""cannot see how any ""normal"" person could honestly post a minus on your work""

No, they are - mute. That's what I wrote. 

""Minuses"" always came from mentally ill persons, no one sane could not have anything less than appreciation only for work of all uploaders. For sake-of-god, I bought my connection in 1998. but never ever even crossed my mind to write ""motherfucker"" to some stranger.

But, number of normal people rapidly goes lower."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T14:27Z,Seeding restarted.
,dark_defender,2011-02-06T15:52Z,"@twentyforty: I thought you would remove this torrent like the last time and re-upload it. But now that you are seeding it again i hv just started downloading it. I don't understand but this has happened second time to my requests.(Thanks to Lunatics)

Anyways i understand the agony as a result of this. 

Thank you for entertaining my request...+1
**Thumbs Up**"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-06T16:36Z,"Mentally ill people often resort in religions. ""Creation"" (-176 this summer) and ""Zeitgeist"" acts like waving with red scarf, been dressed in t-shirt with ""target"" sign on it and having a large hole on back-side of the pants in the same time.

I find it amusing, to some extent. And certainly gave me opportunity to say a few."
,spiritualiste,2011-02-06T16:48Z,"Once again and again and again...+1 (i never get tired to...)
Thanks a lot for sharing your ÂŤunique-piece-of-artÂť work. We (your regulars) understand the time and love you put on your shares and that's what makes your gifts so appreciated...
Live long and Prosper Twentyforty."

negative logic? ;) regardless of wat the rating says, ur regular downloaders would get it anyway.. so y bother?! "
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-07T13:08Z,"@tylr: Empathy differs humans from any other creatures, that's why. There is no empathy without ""bothering"". There is no ""bothering"" without judgment. Humans ""judge"" to be ""bothered"" (making distinctions what is right and what is wrong, is it eatable or not, is it too hot to touch, is it too high to jump, and so forth...).

Now... do not teach me nor preach about logic. You have posted yesterday IMDb link two inches below me, just to make me look bad. This morning you called me out for not posting the IMDb link for cartoon - but you haven't used that rare opportunity to post a link you've found. Nope, it is more likely to get insulted by words or actions than to expect and get help. Got that?

Point begin, logic is something what normal people do poses. And act upon. And you have no right idea what logic is."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-07T13:11Z,"ERR

begin = being

Sorry."
