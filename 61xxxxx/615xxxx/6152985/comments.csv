,retep150,2011-02-06T22:46Z,sorry for the noob comment but since some of these apps you have to pay in order to install do you have to pay if you download it from here? in other words if i install these apps will it be completely free

,BabyHash,2011-02-26T00:09Z,It will be much better if it isn't in a rar file or why don't you just made a list of what apps are in there...

,bluema9ic,2011-05-09T14:57Z,"once install, does anyone knows how to update the apps?"
,luntyboi,2011-07-06T20:49Z,"hi guys, to reptep150, no you dont have to pay, just put them on your sd card then in file manager click to install. and to blue, most apps like this you shouldnt install. as doing so will make it force close all the time, and wont work till you uninstall then reinstall. but hey chances are if you like a game or app, and you see there is a new version out you can normally find it somewhere online anyway :-) cheers for the upload squire, this looks epic so far dude :-)"
