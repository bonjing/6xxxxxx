John Wisdom wants to make good, but he'll never get the chance. Convicted of felony car theft, the earnest 23-year-old finds closed doors of opportunity. So he turns bank robber - with a twist. Armed with an Uzi and nervous bravado, he's a criminal for the people rather than against them, a modern-day Robin Hood rescuing debt-ridden folks from the system's grasp by destroying bank mortgage documents. 
 
Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore star as idealistic outlaws in a provocative thriller whisking you on an explosive cross-country odyssey in the lovers-on-the-run tradition of Bonnie and Clyde and True Romance. Writer/debuting director Estevez delivers all the crisp action, electrifying stunt work and sweaty tension required to keep you at seat's edge as you ride along.
