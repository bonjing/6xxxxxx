Duck Sauce
Greatest Hits (2009)

Responsible for the impossibly infectious Boney M.-sampling party anthem "Barbra Streisand," Duck Sauce are the side project of Boston superstar DJ Armand Van Helden and Montreal turntablist A-Trak. Van Helden is one of the most successful artists on the commercial dance scene, having released six studio albums, a U.K. number one with "You Don't Know Me," and several iconic remixes including Tori Amos' chart-topping "Professional Widow." A-Trak, aka Alain Macklovitch, the younger brother of Chromeo's Dave One, is the founder of Fool's Gold Records, was Kanye West's personal tour DJ, and has produced records for Kid Sister and Lupe Fiasco. The pair teamed up in New York in 2009 to create a dancefloor-friendly sound that incorporated filtered disco, old-skool hip-hop, funk, electro, and late-'90s French house, and often sampled '70s artists such as debut single "Anyway," which borrowed the melody from Final Edition's "I Can Do It." Following the release of their Greatest Hits EP, their second single, "Barbra Streisand," which sampled Boney M.'s "Gotta Go Home," became one of the biggest tracks at the Miami Winter Music Conference and went on to reach number three in the U.K. at the end of 2010.
