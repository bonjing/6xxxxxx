Better in the Dark is the third studio album by Australian dance group Rogue Traders. It was released in Australia by Columbia Records on 13 October 2007 (see 2007 in music). The album was produced by band member James Ash â€” who has also produced the band's previous albums and the lead singer Natalie Bassingthwaighte described the album as a step up, a bit older and more grown-up. Better in the Dark debuted in the top ten on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and is their second highest-selling album to date. The album has yielded three singles: "Don't You Wanna Feel", "I Never Liked You" and "What You're On". The album was never released in the U.K., although the album was released in China, with "Voodoo Child" replacing "Better In The Dark" and the word "Traders" being removed from the front cover.
