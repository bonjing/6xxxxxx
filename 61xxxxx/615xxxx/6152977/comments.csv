[V],DeGun,2011-06-07T16:23Z,"@@ NOBODY 2007 : i did think EXACTLY the same .

@@ OlderBudWeiser : sorry for ya mate . 

@@ ESTHERZANTEN : good upload ! but plz ADD MORE KEY WORDS to the torrent title like for instance the name of the album .. if MP3 320 or FLAC ... 

As well it is important for people to find your stuff all over the web to ADD SOME TAGS ! same again key words like hard,rock,trash,metal,accept,rock,guitar,album name etc etc etc AS MANY AS YU CAN .

I think you are doing a great job sadly you have no seeders as NOT TOO MANY USERZ can find your torrents ... be more precise and it will be perfect ! 

Keep on da great work , all the best .
