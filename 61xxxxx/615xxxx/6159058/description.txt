"Goggles and Hicks"

Badly bruised and exhausted, The Cape (David 
Lyons) heeds advice from Max (Keith David) to 
take some time off to recover. Determined to 
finally kill The Cape, Peter Fleming (James 
Frain) hires a tech-savvy team, including 
Goggles (guest star Pruitt Taylor Vince) and 
Hicks (guest star Chad Lindberg), to track 
and destroy The Cape. Meanwhile, Orwell 
(Summer Glau) faces digital challenges 
against the teams' strong expertise and Dana 
(Jennifer Ferrin) becomes more involved in 
uncovering the truth about Vince's case.
