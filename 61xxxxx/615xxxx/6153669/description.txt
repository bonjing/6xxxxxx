Guitar Player Presents Secrets From The Masters

These are just some scans I made for myself and sadly is not the complete book. However, if you're a guitarist or a fan of rock or jazz then these interviews may be of interest. Cleaned as best as I could. The book was old but the quality is passable for a quick read.
