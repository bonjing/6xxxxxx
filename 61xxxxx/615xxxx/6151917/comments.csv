[T],Games4theworld,2011-02-15T19:10Z,"Hello,

@MizBiz

Yes, we're aware of this problem, but there's currently no fix. I had the same problem when I installed the game and I did try reinstalling, but that didn't give any result. I recommend you just wait for a new update (or expansion), as it may fix the problem.


@jaekoINC

Please apply this fix and see if it solves your problem: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-latest-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems"

@MizBiz

Someone on the Forum just reported that if you uninstall Fast Lane Stuff, it may fix the problem."

[T],Games4theworld,2011-02-19T18:36Z,"Hello,

I see. Then I think you'll need to wait for an update for the game or so. 
Or try uninstalling, restarting and then reinstalling. (Without Fast Lane) It may work."

,ThereseK,2011-02-21T16:43Z,"I have a problem with the download. Or... Not the actual download, but the game that I have installed.

I've tried to do what MizBiz says, and the game started, but when the main menu comes up, the game again says I have to insert the cd.

What to do??

,Teato0o,2011-02-23T20:36Z,"Hey, and thanks A LOT for the torrents! :P
I am having a problem that I can't install downloaded items.. =/
I had the ORIGINAL Sims 3, not downloaded, I had the CD and original CD-key, etc.
I downloaded your High-End Loft stuff and Outdoor Living stuff. But whenever I try to install downloaded items, they say it is installed but whenever I close and open the launcher, nothing is installed. And, evidently, when I play the game, I can't find the items.

Thanks :)"

,damin26,2011-02-26T02:13Z,"Hello everyone! I am writting this in order to let you all know how to install this game correctly and have NO PROBLEMS! 
First af all I wanna thank the *Games4theworld* team for their torrents! 
I installed the game and played 3 hours with no problems. Here are the steps that i followed to install the whole game:

1. Downloaded The Sims 3 basic game (The *Games4theword* version). I installed it following the instructions given, but did NOT apply the crack. Then through the Sims 3 Launcher i downloaded the latest update.
2. Sims 3 World Adventures: DO NOT apply ""Crack 4"". Update to the latest version using the Sims 3 Launcher.
3. Sims 3 High End Loft Stuff: DO NOT apply the crack. Update to the latest version using the Sims 3 Launcher.
4. Sims 3 Ambitions: DO NOT apply any cracks. Update to the latest version.
5. Sims 3 Fast Lane Stuff: DO NOT apply any cracks. Update to the latest version.
6. Sims 3 Late Night: DO NOT apply any cracks. Update to the latest version.
7. Sims 3 Outdoor Living Stuff: Follow ALL the instuctions given step-by-step applying the crack.

That's all! I guarantee that this will work 100%! I hope you all enjoy the game! And thanks again to the *Games4theworld* team! :)

*Sims 3 World Adventures, High-End Loft Stuff, Ambitions, Fast Lane Stuff & Late Night are optional."
,Fira246,2011-02-27T16:18Z,"First, I want to thank you for all of your great uploads. I've never had any trouble with your other Sims 3 EP's/SP's until now.

I tried installing OLS about a week ago, but my game popped up with the standard ""No Disc Can Be Found"". After reading through the comments, I tried the fix provided on your website and I was able to make it all the way to choose which save I wished to play. Halfway through loading that save, my game crashed. I removed all of my mods etc and still it crashed. So, I uninstalled everything, restarted my computer, reinstalled my legal basegame, updated it and tried reinstalling everything as well as updated all of my mods. Now, I can get my saves to load, however I always get a pop up saying ""You've added modifications that don't match with the core, etc etc, Uninstall or update them or your game may crash."" I click continue and my game runs fine until I press my start button to get to my desktop (sometimes I multitask and switch from my game to something else). When I do this, my game closes down completely and I don't know why. I've never had this problem before installing OLS. Is there any fix for this? Should I have manually updated to a certain patch instead of updating all the way to 1.19? Or should I just uninstall everything and only install up to LN?"
,BDSMers,2011-02-27T19:48Z,"works fine, misses happy it works alongside retail copies of game plus expansions"

[T],Games4theworld,2011-03-01T00:47Z,"Hello,

@Stavrialena

No, this just adds an extra expansion to your game. If you do have any problems though, Ã¡lways feel free to contact us or visit our Forum.

@Wisper83

Well, if you install this expansion and apply this fix afterwards, your game should have the latest version, including all bug fixes: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-latest-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems

@ThereseK & @yourangel56

Apply this fix please: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-latest-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems

@Teato0o

Sorry, I don't know anything about DLC's and CC's. Please look for someone who knows something about those. I know there are some users on our Forum who know some stuff about them; you should look for help there.

@geekluv

 Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

@damin26

Thanks for sharing your clear instructions. What you can also do, if you accidentally applied the cracks or don't want to reinstall everything, just apply this fix and you'll automatically have the latest version of the game: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-latest-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems

@Fira246

Well, the problem is really the [CTRL] + [TAB] switching, because when you do so, your game will crash and you'll be forced to close it. The only fix now is to just don't multi-task while playing the game."

I tried to download your fix aswell, but it was hard to understand how to do it in a few of the expantions. since in ambitions and 2 more i think, you got a folder with crack 1 and crack 2. so i didnt know how to do it there.. since in the other ones, i could just copy it right into the folder, since there was just 2 cracks there, no folders. 
I really need help! The stupid problem is that the game tells me that it cant find the cd. its probably a very easy solution to this, but since im a veeery blond and dumb girl, i dont really understand what to do now.. please help me as fast as possible, this is really annoying me -.- really want it to work...!

Games4theworld; no instructions are provided in this torrent. Nor are any serials. And if they are, they are quite well hidden!

Also, why package this as an ISO? Why not just a folder with all the files? Makes more work for us.

Thank you for the upload, though."

[T],Games4theworld,2011-04-16T14:01Z,"Hello,

@shadowzuzi

Please look in exactly: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Wow6432Node > Sims > The Sims 3

@sereneecho

Downloading the EADM is optional, but you can not use the online features if you do not own a legal copy of The Sims 3 base game, since this is a cracked version of the game.

@Doubtpb

No, we won't upload it as a torrent, since it gets updated from time to time. If you download from our Server, you'll always have the latest version of the Fix.
If the link isn't working, just try again in a few hours. The link should be working now.

I've followed your instructions (perfect btw, easy to follow), but as I start a saved or a new game it quit and send me back to my desktop. I could play the base game normally so I don't think it has to do with my computer/graphics. Do you have any idea? Thanks in advance."

,Warsun,2011-07-29T14:47Z,"ill answer the question.

To install download PowerISO first then install.Download it from here somewhere.

Now once you have installed PowerISO the icon of what you want to use looks like a gold DvD.It is recolonized for use.Right click on your file an Set up around 4 mounts.Set this file as your Mount.

Now right click on the icon AGAIN an click Open.
This will load it too a temporary location which it will be safe to load.Click on Autorun or whatever .exe file must be loaded.

Let it load then it should run as a DvD.As long as it is mounted you cannot move the file so make sure it is in a area off your desktop.If you have multiple programs the other mounts will cover those.Mount the others with the options.

It is best to use this one
