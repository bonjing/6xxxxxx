,Killa632,2011-03-27T04:58Z,"hm works for me, might be the version of daemon cuz i have lite, dunno"
,Caleb205,2011-04-07T20:15Z,"Yeah, I'm having the same problem. Downloaded, extracted, mounted the image (daemon tools lite) and everything starts up fine, till I try to begin a game, then I get a message saying CD not in CD drive. Any advice?"
,Blacksmith1992,2011-04-20T02:50Z,"@caleb205 & @takeonelastbreath the same happened to me, all you have to do is go to your Device Manager and Disable the DVD-RAM or whatever disk reader you have on your laptop/computer. Then just Enable it when you want to use your disk drive again."
,Blacksmith1992,2011-04-20T02:52Z,to disable. right click the disk drive and select disable.
,dingdini,2011-05-20T16:45Z,"Tried to disable the dvd-rom. Didn't work.
Do you have any other suggestions?"
,McNekki,2011-06-23T10:02Z,it just doesnt work installed run perfectly up until clicking begin game then like everyone else asking for cd to be inserted this is just an awful rip so will be ignoring it from now on
