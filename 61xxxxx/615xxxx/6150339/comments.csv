,wayneking,2011-02-09T18:20Z,"decent quality rip, but as above noted, the very end is missing.  Bit disappointing after watching the whole movie.  Thanks for the UL, but should really advise people that some is missing and how much, even if it is only a minute at the end.  I have to DL this elsewhere now or it will really irk me as it is actually a very enjoyable film."
