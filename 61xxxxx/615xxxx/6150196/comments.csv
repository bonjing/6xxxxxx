it was quite a short movie and 720p source was gud enough...so i went ahead and encoded it..
I hope it's ok.."

,X3MEX,2011-02-05T08:24Z,"@RajMahal
absolutely fine, the last screen cap says it all..Thanks much 

just one thing though, u dont seem to indicate the audio bitrate of ur rips, i tried Mediainfo, still doesnt show up, what say u? :D"
[V],RajMahal,2011-02-05T09:17Z,"@ X3MEX 
 I don't know why...i will try to add it manually from the next encode..
The Audio BitRate on this one is 256 kbps

[V],prashant22,2011-02-05T15:27Z,"when using mkv, mediainfo wont show audio bitrate..it also wont show the exact maximum video bitrate obtained...
it does this with mp4 bt nt with mkv...

one question though rajmahal why do u use mkv...if u were using dual audio or 2ch as well as 6ch audio then it would hv been understandable..."
[V],RajMahal,2011-02-05T20:56Z,"@ prashanth

I will try to do mp4 from now on bro..
Thanks for the suggestion !!"

The only problem, even if it's small, is that in the English subtitles the "" i "" character, was always shown as "" l "" "
