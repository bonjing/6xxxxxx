Usually, their limit is about ten a day or so, varying by one or two either way, depending on your recent ""ADD"" activity.

I received one notice about ""adding too many friends"", which I thought was kinda' stupid, considering that the whole IDEA of FB is to network and make new ""friends"", and then the next day, I added three more people and WHAM!--Deactivated and had to start all over again....."

The ""Gather ID"" portion works with both interfaces. However, the ""Friend Request"" and ""Wall Poster"" only work with the browser, and the ""Messenger"" doesn't work at all.

Has anyone else experienced this problem? I am running Windows 7. The browser that the program launches is IE (mine is version 8)."
