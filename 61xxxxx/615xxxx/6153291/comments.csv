,fresh_idea,2011-02-19T12:13Z,"not a real dvd, just an xvid converted to dvd. audio a bit out of sync when played on powerdvd. no subtitles included"
,OrpheusDude,2011-02-28T15:21Z,"Is this from a screener, with studio watermarks throughout?  What's the audio? 2.0 or 5.1?"
,OrpheusDude,2011-02-28T15:23Z,Stupid me: at 1.59 GB it's obviously not a DVD rip.  Wait for the real thing.
,mskoczek,2011-03-03T12:20Z,I did not say that is a DVD or DVD Rip only quality DVD
,Damien74,2011-03-05T01:50Z,If you convert a DIVX to DVD you do NOT get DVD quality. Buy some sense on Ebay.
,nomadik,2011-07-08T13:07Z,quality dvd and dvd quality imply 2 different things and it says dvd quality...so you did say it!
