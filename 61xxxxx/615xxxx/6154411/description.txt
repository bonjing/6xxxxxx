 This is the soundtrack to Alan Lomax's acclaimed book of the same name.
Recorded between 1933 and 1959 by Alan Lomax, Lewis Jones, John W. Work, John A. Lomax, and Herbert Halpert. Remastered to 24-bit digital from the original metal and acetate discs, and the original paper and acetate-backed tape recordings.
Alan Lomax takes us on an adventure into the "bad old days" of the post-slavery, Jim Crow Mississippi Delta â€” the birthplace of the blues â€” when railroads and levees were being built and cotton boomed at the expense of Southern working-class African Americans.
Singing of their misery and their barely concealed rage, the Bluesman enlisted their African heritage to keep their souls alive and in the process created the first satirical song form in the English language...
