I have an idea, next time you're online trolling for more American movies why don't you google American inventors. Since I'm such a dumb American pig, why don't you print off all the pages of information on them. I could never figure that out!

It's literally been a non stop ride since 1776 carrying the entire world. And Americans rarely complain about donating more food to third world countries, sending aide to places like haiti, japan, etc, and putting up with the rest of the world's problems.

At least I got to know that there really are people like you in america who actually THINK you are superior to other countries! That is fascinating, really.

So I have an assignment for you, my friend: Pick a european contry at random and put yourself in that country's perspective of the world. Why do they think the way they think, why do they speak that language they speak and why is that country a great country? In what way is this country superior to america?

The measure of a countryâ€™s greatness lies not in a list of inventions. There are probably such lists in most countries, and these inventions stems from or on some other idea. 

If greatness is measured in education, transportation, healthcare and home ownership then Mauritius is the greatest country on earth. There, education is free for everyone, as is healthcare, transportation for children in school and 87% owns their own home. If you measure in education, health, quality of life, economic dynamism and political environment then Finland is the best country on earth. Thereâ€™s always someone better or someone worse. 

Youâ€™re free to think America is great, and I am free to think Sweden is greater. Behaving badly and childishly though, and Iâ€™m not sure what your point was, only leaves a negative impression and enhances whatever prejudices people already have of the usa.

First off every Country in the world today puts money before the individual and insurance companies scam everyone these are true regardless of race or nationality. Our system is a capitalist one so we do not let these foreign students we recruit and through our need to stay competitive encourage the worlds smartest people. Which is why 95% of the invention list have Norwegian, Swedish, German, Italian, English sur names.  As for us being superior COME ON every conquered or fallen nation says that about the current super power.  The French said that about the vikings. The Egyptians said that about the Romans. the English said it about France. India said it about England Europe said it about the Germans. Now the world says it about us.

I am Swedish and I know that we have alot of faults also so i am not running around and saying that Sweden is the best country in the world that would be ignorant in my oppinion.

By the way,,, I happend to enjoy old Hong Kong action much more than the massproduction that excists today:)

,domsdngja,2011-06-18T17:49Z,"So, Kyle, I take it you are proud of your country. At least proud enough to go on about it in a piratebay thread about a Norwegian horror flick. Good for you.
So, thanks for inventing the light bulb and beating the Nazis, I guess.

But you know, if you love your country, you should be concerned about its decline, and weep for the stupidity that tears it apart. 
Look, your country is bogged down by debates on creationism, birth control, health care, homosexuality and the death penalty. All civilized countries have sorted these out long ago, they have literally been non-issues for at at least two generations now. This is where you fell behind, some time soon after landing on the Moon. And now running out of money isn't going to make things easier. I say this without gloating, as Europe certainly isn't going to be better off for America's decline. But this is what happens to all empires, you rest on your laurels and before you know it, history will have moved on without you. 

Imagine you were Greek for a minute. Would you be proud? Yes. Could you list tons of things your ancestors have done for civilization? Of course. But this wouldn't change the fact that Greece has been a corrupt oligarchy for centuries, and now ran out of sanity, dignity and money all at the same time. If you need to base your patriotic pride in the deeds of your ancestors, it's a sure sign that you have no future."

Look Kyle, seeing as your vast amount of movies to choose to watch, why choose the one you're most likely to pick a fight about. I am not narowegian, I'm swedish and I still can't understand what the people in the movie say, but thanks to the subtitles it's possible. So if you're making such a big fuss about the language of the movie, maybe you should sue them, or send the director a video instead of taking it out on people who actually enjoy the movie, you can't really change our opinion if we like it so why bother. This is a very childish thing to talk about and the way you talk about your own country is quite a bit insulting towards the US. I honeslty don't understand how you could degrade your own country. You say hollywood makes the most money in show-biz but you seriously think that matters in this case? This movie was funny, interested, and it had trolls. What else can you ask for.

Did you even realize while listing up all the ""American gifts to the world"" how wrong you are in many of those cases, and that a vast majority of your listed inventions aren't really anything to be proud of (i.e. napalm, cotton candy, cigarettes) due to being of negative nature to human society and/or the environment.

Also, the US health care, education, legislation, taxation law (i.e. import and export law), government spending, racial, religious and sexual ""parity"", barriers for private entrepreneurs, government intervention in environmental issues (and so forth) lack stability and are very inefficient in many cases, but most importantly they are unfair and have a severe lack of general planning and logic. These are few of the reasons why many countries such as the Nordic countries have a higher standard of living that the United States. And as comes to e.g. the Swedish system with free education and healthcare, reasonable direct taxation, government welfare etc. I see no reason for arguing why the United States of America is based on a superior foundation than many other nations in the world.

I prefer living in a country which cares for its citizens; where succeeding isn't impossible and where your tax money is an investment for your children's full education and your family's potential future illnesses. Rather than living in a country which exploits its citizens monetarily for every choice they make, for every misfortune they happen to be exposed to.

It could be a very educational experience for you to visit another country, stay there for a year or so, try to learn the language, try to understand the system, the culture, the history and heritage, and make new friends.
For narrow-minded, stubborn people like yourself it might be difficult and possibly frightening to learn to accept that the system within which you live, is not the greatest in the world, although your glorious nation is powerful and a vast contributor to modern technological advancements, that I don't deny.

My family is 3 generations in Canada now, still 100% Norwegian blood, (no inbreeding), and we are still very proud of our heritage. I have traveled extensively, ended up marrying a Polish national (lived there for 1 yr) and have developed a great respect for other cultures and languages.

However that all had to change after reading these hilarious comments by the American! The Scandinavians and the other Europeans totally annihilated you! They speak actual intelligence and have by far been the most enlightening and most factual out of the whole rant!! Yes this whole rant is pathetic and I don't even know what your first point was Kyle but I can't sit back and read this shit that is actually being formulated in your brain!! You are Brainwashed, Its evident even your fellow Americans agree!! I am English and will say now i don't care about my country being better than yours and all this shit, I can easily say England or The Untied Kingdom Is fucked at the moment we are not the great nation we use to be but don't go around pumping propaganda into our children's heads about how great we are, being Christian is the only way and all this bollocks!!! Any Brit will say we are by the far the best at the moment in time!!! I have been to every continent and travelled to a lot of different countries and I love the different cultures and agree, knowing the local lingo is so vital and much appreciated by the locals!! Yes i love going to America and have been plenty of times, as well Sweden! But i will tell you now, some of the most retarded people i have ever met and spoken to (well tried to) have been AMERICAN!! I was actually asked such things as ""Do you wear a skirt? (I think she meant kilt and Im not Scottish) Do you use the American Dollar in England??!!  WHERE IS ENGLAND?? Is it in The USA?? Do we only drink tea??? The list goes on & on & on!! Not saying all of Americans are retards but the majority I have spoken to don't have a fucking clue about the world outside of 52 states of the USA!!! (Cant complain about the women though.... DIRTY!! :D) I love Canada if I am honest!!! So much better!! Basically the same as America but without all the SHIT! And also how can you say about your government being all gravy and top notch when if i wake up tomorrow and found out I had cancer, my Doctor and the NHS would happily help me and fund everything whereas vice versa you wouldn't be so happy!! FINALLY my countries government didn't plan, organise and follow through with mass genocide of their own people! Then create the worlds biggest SCAPEGOAT!! Watch the Zeitgeist films then maybe you will learn!!

Wow!  Like Diggers42 I'm a Brit who's honestly never felt the need to register and comment before, I was just really looking forward to this film that will be easy to watch because I can read. But after reading your comments I can only summarise that you're either a complete cretin or you're doing a really good impression of one.  Unlike a few others on here though, I don't feel sorry for you. You just make me genuinely angry, as well as sad that people like you, arrogant, stupid, small-minded people like you, actually exist.  Some of my friends who are from the U.S. would be appalled at the shit you're coming up with.  You're not helping your country, all you're doing is reinforcing the very wrong stereotype that all Americans are stupid.  Well Mr Greatest Nation in the world,  no nation is perfect, no nation has all the right answers, and no nation should begrudge the amount of aid they give to other countries or boast about their many accomplishments, which is why as a spokesperson for your country, you are utterly shit.  Don't feel bad, but that Foreign Affairs position in the House of Representatives probably won't be going to you. 

However, seeing as you're doing such a good job of being a stereotype, we're just going to have to treat you like one.  So, if you're not too busy watching Transformers, eating fried chicken while buttfucking your George Bush sex doll in a Colonel Sanders outfit, why not try reading a book about countries which aren't America, and ways to be more tolerant of them.  You might just make a few more friends.    "

I on the other hand regularly sink to the lowest levels when I need to confront assholes like you, I don't like it one bit but I find the whole process, nerve-soothing to say the least.

First of the only reason you got in WW2 was not to save your European forefathers but to entrap them in a huge debt which in return fueled most of your post-war boom. 

Oh and let us not forget that if you hadn't intervened sooner or later you'd be speaking German as well, not that it'd have done you any bad to learn a foreign language you fucking hicks! 

You know what I call America? The empire that never got to be. And never will probably because now you got real opposition to worry about. The Yellow Flood is coming and I as a European would side by them any day of the week and twice on a Sunday. I may not be a huge fan of communism but they're not real communists anyway. Not to mention that lately they seem to be beating you in your own damn game, capitalism.

You, and people like you should get their heads out of their asses. USA is going down and fast. In another 50 years you'll be nothing more than a second class world power and nothing more. Which is for the best if you ask my humble opinion cuz that's where you belong actually. 

The rise of America was something like a freaky accident in world history and these accidents tend to mend themselves pretty fast.

Oh, and another thing. Yeah, we got about the same ratio of pathologically stupid to normal people as you do. Only difference is we don't vote them in as Heads of State like you did. And if by terrible mistake that ever happens once in a while we certainly don't give them a second term as well.

Oh, and good job on being the stronghold of capitalism. If only you knew what the fuck you are doing! Maybe then you wouldn't have dragged the rest of the world into the fucking pit with that credit-crisis we're all going through lately.

Go shoot some tin cans, join a cult, ride some bulls or bang your stupid heads against the wall or whatever the hell you and your brother-cousins do for fun. There's not much worse you can get than you already are anyway.
