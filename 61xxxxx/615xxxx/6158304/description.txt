Play as Dr. House and the skilled staff at Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital, as you race to unravel medical mysteries. Based on the popular TV show, fans and casual gamers alike can now experience what it is like to conduct patient care while successfully solving five unique cases. Every piece of evidence reveals part of the solution, so careful observation and analysis is key. Track down the correct diagnosis by interviewing and examining patients doing lab tests, surgery and more. The clock is ticking, but be prepared for multiple twists and turns before you solve the case?
