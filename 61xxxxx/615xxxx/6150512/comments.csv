,chaiyont,2011-02-06T11:11Z,"Loader hung after installation so I installed the Hazar loader. After that, it is working fne."
,chaiyont,2011-02-07T02:21Z,"One other thing about this and some other current W7 versions. Automatic updating is on. There is that mysterious update that only says that you will need it to receive for future updates.. that is almost certainly a delayed validation check. Don't download it. I woke up one morning to find my system was ""not genuine"" and not updated in weeks. I am pretty sure that one is the reason why.

I would just turn off updating completely. W7 is mature enough now it shouldn't be necessary. "
,dinodig,2011-02-08T03:34Z,"@extremezone

In the third screen shot of yours in 'some themes' category, the screen looks incredible. I mean is it really true? Can you tell me its name or upload only the theme(I have too many W7 DVDs burnt and cant go for another)

Tnx in advance"

,liamf91,2011-02-13T16:06Z,"chaiyont is right, microsoft did do an update so that they can tell if you dont have a genuine install...

im not sure if you can manually download updates from the microsoft site. 

but this download looks good if you dont need to be online with it constantly"

,samtheman66,2011-02-27T12:44Z,"for those having trouble installing
-use daemon tools to mount iso
-copy files to a dvd or usb drive
-make sure that the dvd or usb is made to be bootable

worked a treat for me"

,mhatthei,2011-03-08T06:05Z,"I don't want to piss anybody off or prevent someone from downloading this... but for me it didn't work. 

It boots (burned the image with image burn ""imgburn"") but after I select x86 (32 bits) and english language it says ""Window$ cannot access the installation sources. Verify that the installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation."" 

What kind of problem could it be?"

,mhatthei,2011-04-03T10:09Z,"OK forget what I said previously... this copy of windows 7 installs perfectly! I was trying on a too old laptop, with unsufficient RAM and so on...

I aslo tried to install other copies (different than this one here) on the same old laptop but they wouldn't install either... so I put Ubuntu on it instead... all the pain was taken away instantly!

But like I said, this copy was successfully installed on a desktop computer (more recent)...
(The activation and license key were already installed with this copy of windows 7, I was able to do windows updates right after the installation was finished...)

So my apologies for my previous posts, and thank you a lot extremezone!"
,Seeyaflying,2011-04-13T09:48Z,Extremezone you say on the 64 bit one of this it does not need a serial number but when in deed it does... it ask for one and it says validate windows before 30 days... can you please help me with this... Thanks
