Thanks a lot to seeders and uploader/encoder (as Jon writes)..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-07T14:36Z,"LOL, I know. You got 74.6% from me and rest from my nephew. However, one peer from Bosnia have joined later, and he has finished too. Enjoy."
,t.trikiti,2011-02-07T14:55Z,oh man! thanks a lot!
,t.trikiti,2011-02-07T14:57Z,are you going to do the super bowl?

Oh! So you found your file!
Thanks to you, your nephew and Bosnia seeder...
: )"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-07T15:17Z,"@t.trikiti: Nope, sorry. Extremely low-bitrate H264 doesn't encode live events well."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-07T15:20Z,"@spiritualiste: Yep, I found it later on external drive."
,t.trikiti,2011-02-07T16:00Z,"ok, no problem, I understand! thanks for answering anyways. "
,etowhid,2011-02-07T21:25Z,"Thanks a lot for Glee.

I saw the first episode of Glee's first season  just a week ago with a friend, & I got hooked. He had the whole season, & I spend the entire weekend watching it. The first place I looked for Season Two was you (you're the best, right!), & I have two requests.

One - Why did you do the first two episodes in 272p instead of 480p? (You did the same thing with Fringe's first two eps, if I remember correctly) If possible, can you do them in 480p?

Two - You made separate torrents for episodes 1-4, & they have decent number of seeders, but for episodes 5-10, that's certainly not the case. Can you seed them for a while?

Hope you don't get too bored with this long message. Thanks! :)"

Will seed as long as possible of course"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-08T07:03Z,"@etowhid: My old ""home"" was closed and I came on TPB right then. And I have 272p fan base at the old place."
,etowhid,2011-02-08T17:54Z,I see your point. I wish there were more seeders for episodes 5-10...I'd hate to go to eztv for them; twice the file size = 2x waiting time :(
