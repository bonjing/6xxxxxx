I think this new engine they talk about means they fucked up the game. Either that or this game is a bolocks copy.

Played for 30 minutes and the game isnt as realistic as the first one to be honest. This one looks more like cartoon/fantasy, and yes driving this is crap"

,skydree,2011-02-08T09:25Z,"Everything is working just fine here @ win 7 x64. Thanks for the great release. Just follow my instructions:

1. Optional* Disable Network connection.
2. Mount or burn image with Daemon Tools.
3. Install with the serial: 7ADW-EDYX-WH9-5GU7
4. Do not start the game after installation!
5. Copy the file 'TestDrive2.exe' from TDU2 torrent folder to the game installation.
6. IMPORTANT* Block 'UpLauncher.exe' in your firewall to prevent the game from being updated.
7. Now you can turn on your network connection again.
8. Start and PLAY the game from 'UPLauncher.exe', not from the cracked 'testdriver2.exe'
9. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!

And for you guys getting an window error message with no text. Just follow the step 8, i mean open the game from UPLauncher not from testdrive2.exe.

Why mess with a system that works IE TDU1 which I still play to this day in Hardcore mode. To remove the game mechanics that make it awesome sucks to say the least. IF only they could hire people that knew about games to help them make games instead of probably outsourcing cheap game designers that just do what they are told. Where were the BETA testers on this WHY DIDN'T YOU SPEAK UP.....

,whistlersmom,2011-02-08T21:35Z,"@ IcIrIs

 There were plenty of beta testers ( I  was one ) who tested this game , found bugs , flaws , issues , places where it could be improved , tested driving feeling etc etc. There were alot of people giving feedbacks to the company on closed beta forums. Trust me , it was not due to the beta testers that this game is not what its ment to be, WE SPOKE UP xD

They did not run the server's 24/7 for testing and there was NO offline play , wich ment that the game was elibeble for testing about 2-4 times a week for about 4 hours. Many of these test's took time during the hours where ppl in america had work to do , leaving out plenty of testers. 

The beta closed in November I think, still having a shit load of bugs and the game just being incomplete. The producers having postponed the release once already , probably got sick and tired and thought "" Hey fuck it , lets just release it like this and ppl will buy it , I mean they bought the 1st one and loved it so they will most likley buy the 2nd one"". 

Lack of respect for the beta testers , and producers who dont care = a game not so good."
,Unit431,2011-02-08T22:33Z,"Yeah, fuck this. Deleted the installed version, will still seed in the hopes of a miracle patch or mod which fixes the fucking hopeless car handling."
,BarrySoetoro,2011-02-08T22:58Z,"Don't know what you people are whining about... works fine, runs great with all the settings maxed on my rig, just like every other game out there... maybe you should reevaluate your systems instead of springing for the propaganda. Actually do some research before buying parts.

Yes, they fucked up the keyboard controls... and the graphics are only marginally better than TDU1. But really, you will get used to it if you give it a chance. It's nowhere near as bad as SHIFT for keyboard control, that's for sure. I picked it up after a bit. The only issues I have are on roundabouts / traffic circles... can't track smoothly at all. But they are few in numbers, and easy enough to avoid.

These things will be addressed, by third party if necessary. I think this is one of those games that will get better with time, and patches. It has potential.

Wish they had made it more classy than flashy, but whatever... once you cut through all the shit, the driving is fun enough.

That said, I'm not buying it... not until some patches are released, and it's cheaper. Just like all the games I play, a year after their release. It's the only way to truly enjoy them.

Thanks for the up, works perfectly."

Runs smoothly on my machine which would be a middle end machine.

gameplay's like no other racing game i've seen, so if anything i'd say check it out fer sure (if your computer can run it that is ;] )

If you're curious, it's a 7.2/7.9 in the Windows Experience Index, so people please stop bothering me with it, kthx ^.^

PS. THIS ^  is how a comment is supposed to be, especially if you're whining the game(or torrent) isn't working for some reason or another, ESPECIALLY if it's 'laggy' or 'slow' or w/e.
If it's really that much of a hassle, type your specs down in notepad or w/e text program you're using, and save it in your docs or somewhere easy to access, then copy and paste it. There is no excuse for laziness ;]"

I am also running directx 10 and it says that directx 9 is required....Would Directx 10  make such a huge difference?

,fleebus,2011-02-15T12:29Z,"This works fine, not slow like everyone else said. I think the thing is, most *youngins* these days think they're pc technicians just because they figured out how to ask for the most expensive video card possible for x-mas, and then install it. Thing is, despite what some people might say, getting triple or quad core IS worth the investment. Even games that weren't *optimized* for quad core WILL benefit from the extra power.  Gone are the days of only upgrading your video card and letting the rest of your system lag behind.   Anyway, nice upload. THNX.

Btw i'm running it all max settings (anti-aliasing x4 (not 8! I know) with a 9800gt512mbddr3, AMD Athlon II x4 640, 4gigs of ddr3.

,The77s,2011-02-16T08:27Z,"This game has just been released, it's not well optimized for Dual or Quad Core.

It's also not optimized for Nvidia or ATI, so please people, stop complaining so much and arguing about your PC's.

Anyhow, the Handling in this game, sucks, I've tried Hardcore, which was Terrible, so I went to Sport, and that sucks too, I then changed some settings in Sport and it's slightly better, but still terrible.

Basically, wait for a Patch to fix a lot of the Bugs, Glitches and Handling.

To be honest, I wouldn't pay for this game any way, this is a pre-BETA game, the amount of Bugs and Glitches prove that, they don't even have the Handling done well.

Developers are starting to release games earlier and earlier just because they know that they can just release Patches.

Also, the week TDU2 came out, they released DLC for it.

1 f*cking week and Atari is all ready releasing DLC for the game they've yet to FIX, never mind DLC.

There is less and less companies I'm willing to purchase products from, Atari is now one of them."

Sorry for fucked english .."
,pr0nDL,2011-02-18T18:31Z,"Problemfix:

Let the game update, THEN use the old crack and block updater from firewall :)"
,caspianseez,2011-02-18T20:18Z,"@ pr0nDL

that doesn't work.
if you let the game update to v082 and then replace the new EXE with the old crack, the game doesn't recognize your save data and makes you start over. if you quit and try to start the game again, it will try to update the EXE again whether you are connected to the internet or not. this is an endless cycle. the current cracks are all broken, none of them can fix this.

right now the only way to really fix it would be for someone to crack the TDU2.EXE itself. we need a way to bypass the UPLAUNCHER, it's the UpLauncher that causes the problem because it checks the games files even if you are offline. someone needs to bypass the UpLauncher and make it so that people can run the game just using the TDU2.EXE"
,caspianseez,2011-02-18T20:20Z,"seems like none of the cracks work.

the game uses UpLauncher to check the files even if you are offline. we need a way to BYPASS the UpLauncher and run the game just using the TDU 2 exe directly."
,Flawz777,2011-02-18T21:01Z,"crack errors, an empty error, blocked up lancher"
,dzoni83,2011-02-18T23:33Z,"I said it before, and I'm saying it again:
Re-install the game and disable the internet, and keep it disabled if you want to play.. 
No net -> no update -> no update no need for a new crack. "
,pr0nDL,2011-02-19T00:45Z,"@caspianseez:

For some reason it worked for me. I don't know why. But im waiting for a new crack :) "
,_Sensei_,2011-02-19T01:47Z,works fine if I recopy the testdrive2 file from the crack into the game directory each time
,Wallboy19,2011-02-19T02:25Z,I got it to work with the crack. At first it told me that update was unable to install. So when I tried to run the game it just closed back to desktop. So I deleted the DownloadCache folder in the TDU2 folder and then when I launched TDU2 it redownloaded the patch without giving me an error. Then I closed the launcher and did not click play. I then replaced the TestDrive2 exe with the cracked one. And then the game worked.
,Wallboy19,2011-02-19T02:36Z,"Also, after exiting the game now and reopening it, it sees that the exe is different and tries to redownload it. So you have to replace it again with the cracked one every time you play the game. Guess thats the temporary workaround until a proper crack for this patch."
,nark0z,2011-02-19T05:13Z,Fucking horrible game.
,Wisper83,2011-02-19T13:09Z,"i dunno why but even fire-walled it still connects to internet i probably do something wrong.. 

anyway let it update! this way you will get cloudy weather!

then disconnect from internet and then apply again the crack it it worked well for me  :D  and from now on start the game without internet ..."
,palonazo,2011-02-19T15:36Z,"@Whisper83 I have tried all that, i even downloaded a Skidrow crack for v3 (they patched to V4 today). I turn my router off, and then i get an error from the launcher saying it cannot update. I cancel that, i tell it that im ok with playing offline, but when i hit play, the app just shuts down, no matter what cracked exe i use."
,palonazo,2011-02-19T15:39Z,"Where i said v4, i meant v083 build4 (that's the current version today)

This is the first time i've had problems with a cracked game, as when they work, they work."
,palonazo,2011-02-19T15:51Z,"Now, even if i install this torrent's version while disconected from the internet and apply the cracked exe, the uplaucher will complain about not being able to update. I cancel that message, the play button goes clickable but when i click it, the whole app closes down."
,iamrudyani,2011-02-19T19:07Z,"Yup, you'll need to copy the crack each time, if it's updated.  Otherwise, you can disconnect your Internet while launching the game."
,caspianseez,2011-02-19T23:48Z,"disconnecting from the internet does not stop the UpLauncher from checking the games files offline.

until someone actually cracks TDU2.exe we are going to have this problem of playing cat and mouse. update, crack, update, crack, etc.

the only way to break this cycle is for someone to actually crack the game .exe directly. we need a way to start the game without using the UpLauncher."

,__D_R_I_Z__,2011-02-24T22:43Z,"I admire the skills of whoever Skidrow Ã nd Reloaded might be,
a little less the skills of people who upload their files in here,
because I doubt those are the same people, for legal issues and stuff.

Though, the people I don't admire are those who seem to feel joy in acting aggressive on people who need help and people who need help that don't take the effort of checking if their answer is nowhere to be found yet.

But, I do need help.
My problem, thÃ t I have found with others to, but no solution so far.

1 To be clear: I did everything by the rules. If you want to check; here's what I did:
I did use the newest version of Daemon Tools. I did copy all the files when mounted to my C: drive. I have installed everything with the exact instructions that came with the Skidrow-files. I didn't let it run directly after. I did copy the crack to the installed files (which amazed me; it had the exact same size of the original exe, but anyway) I have blocked everything from the internet using Firewall. I rebooted to make sure. I did try first with the testdrive2.exe and later with the uplauncher.exe. Reinstalled, rebooted several times. I also just tried with this crack also uploaded here on the Pirate Bay, also claimed to be Skidrows, and again I noticed; all options, same size. It just doesn't work.

2 My exact problem has been mentioned as I said earlier in other comments:
when I try to launch anyhow, I get the same error with nothing but a red cross as some other people.
I want to be honest with my future helpers, so I'll admit I'm using a bit of an older laptop,
my windows 7 is a Pliek (but very good) copy :) and to see at the little stickers here, I have Intel Centrino Duo, my laptop was designed for XP but capable for Vista, and my graphic sign says nVidia Geforce'Go 7600.

So, I'll make 3 a bit of my conclusion:
Is anybody smart enough with computers, or hack once in a while, I don't really care, to assist me on this problem.

,unimportant01,2011-03-03T11:00Z,"wow...just wow, some of the help requests here are just...wow! so anyway this is how i made this work: (and yes it does work, if you are having a problem then it is likely you did something wrong or are missing something needed to play or if you do manage to make it work but are having problems like lag in controls >>, then your computer is just not up to the task of playing modern games, my computer has the exact same specs as the minimum requirements and it runs it perfectly at 1680*1050 at highest settings) So anyway the instructions:
1. Mount/Burn image using software like daemon tools or alcohol 52/120 percent or power iso etc. (and if you need help on how to use these programs then look for help on the respective software developers websites, don't whine here!)
2. Install the game using the provided key, hopefully thats a simple enough instruction without needing further clarification.
3. The Crack file is called ""TestDrive2.exe"" it should be outside the image file, it should be one of the files you downloaded. Copy the crack file and paste it into the folder you installed the game in."
,unimportant01,2011-03-03T11:01Z,"4. You can either be disconnected from the internet or make your firewall block the game from connecting to the internet when playing. To make your firewall block the game you have to block the file called ""UpLauncher.exe"" (Again if you need further help with this refer to your firewall makers website)
5. Launch the game using the ""UpLauncher.exe"" file, a window should pop up saying welcome to tdu2 and blahblahblah...give it a few minutes and it should come up with a dialog box saying something about being unable to connect to tdu2 servers or something, with 2 options retry and cancel, obviously you want to press cancel. give it a few more seconds and it should let you press the big ""Play"" button located at the bottom of the original popup, press the play button and tell it that yes you want to play offline.
6. If the game launches in windowed mode then press Alt+Enter to go to fullscreen.

PS - A hint about updates, it may or may not work after letting the ""UpLauncher.exe"" update the game, it worked for me, it even had my old profile still there, but obviously i had to recopy the crack over the updated file it downloaded. If it doesnt work after an update then obviously you will have to reinstall and not let it update the game!"

@unimportant01, thank you :)
1. Mount/Burn image using software like daemon tools or alcohol 52/120 percent or power iso etc. (and if you need help on how to use these programs then look for help on the respective software developers websites, don't whine here!)
2. Install the game using the provided key, hopefully thats a simple enough instruction without needing further clarification.
3. The Crack file is called ""TestDrive2.exe"" it should be outside the image file, it should be one of the files you downloaded. Copy the crack file and paste it into the folder you installed the game in. 
4. You can either be disconnected from the internet or make your firewall block the game from connecting to the internet when playing. To make your firewall block the game you have to block the file called ""UpLauncher.exe"" (Again if you need further help with this refer to your firewall makers website)
5. Launch the game using the ""UpLauncher.exe"" file, a window should pop up saying welcome to tdu2 and blahblahblah...give it a few minutes and it should come up with a dialog box saying something about being unable to connect to tdu2 servers or something, with 2 options retry and cancel, obviously you want to press cancel. give it a few more seconds and it should let you press the big ""Play"" button located at the bottom of the original popup, press the play button and tell it that yes you want to play offline.
6. If the game launches in windowed mode then press Alt+Enter to go to fullscreen.

PS - A hint about updates, it may or may not work after letting the ""UpLauncher.exe"" update the game, it worked for me, it even had my old profile still there, but obviously i had to recopy the crack over the updated file it downloaded. If it doesnt work after an update then obviously you will have to reinstall and not let it update the game! "

3: After it's installed, it will try to update. Don't !
4:Copy the crack across

6: It will try to check for updates, but can't. Say play in offline mode.

,fetishgod,2011-07-10T19:35Z,"Game works but it's very annoying. It downloads the main executable file every time you start it. So you have to wait for the download to finish to unlock the ""Play"" button, then copy cracket one to the install directory. And every time the same. Game itself is worthless. Good graphics but there is no realism to the driving. To anyone that drove a car in the real life it will be like walking on the slippery floor full of oil. Cars slide on every single surface, grip is virtually non-existent. If you want to piss yourself off, download it, any other way: it's a massive waste of time!

,longhornfan,2011-09-09T05:07Z,"REPOSTING 'unimportant01's words!
@unimportant01, thank you :)
1. Mount/Burn image using software like daemon tools or alcohol 52/120 percent or power iso etc. (and if you need help on how to use these programs then look for help on the respective software developers websites, don't whine here!)
2. Install the game using the provided key, hopefully thats a simple enough instruction without needing further clarification.
3. The Crack file is called ""TestDrive2.exe"" it should be outside the image file, it should be one of the files you downloaded. Copy the crack file and paste it into the folder you installed the game in.
4. You can either be disconnected from the internet or make your firewall block the game from connecting to the internet when playing. To make your firewall block the game you have to block the file called ""UpLauncher.exe"" (Again if you need further help with this refer to your firewall makers website)
5. Launch the game using the ""UpLauncher.exe"" file, a window should pop up saying welcome to tdu2 and blahblahblah...give it a few minutes and it should come up with a dialog box saying something about being unable to connect to tdu2 servers or something, with 2 options retry and cancel, obviously you want to press cancel. give it a few more seconds and it should let you press the big ""Play"" button located at the bottom of the original popup, press the play button and tell it that yes you want to play offline.
6. If the game launches in windowed mode then press Alt+Enter to go to fullscreen.

PS - A hint about updates, it may or may not work after letting the ""UpLauncher.exe"" update the game, it worked for me, it even had my old profile still there, but obviously i had to recopy the crack over the updated file it downloaded. If it doesnt work after an update then obviously you will have to reinstall and not let it update the game!"

The ""Hardcore"" mode (simulation) is not even close to the actual physics of a real vehicle. If you want a real driving game, go with Need 4 Speed The Run, it is incredible and waaaay easier to install and run.

torrent works perfect, no problems with install and play, great game, but looks like the old TDU :(

How many torrents you have actually uploaded? Almost all of my games are from you. Keep it up! :)"
,Graves69,2012-05-19T16:12Z,"When I try to play some Welcome screen pops up and it says ""This software must be authenticated online prior to use. For activation a valid serial number and an active Internet connection is required. 

Please visit our support homepage for additional information: https://support.securom.com/PAunlock/?c=3000""

Then I click ""Next"" and it wants me to enter serial, but the one in the ""key"" notepad file isn't valid anymore! When I write it there and click ""Activate"", it says ""Activation Failed"". Then it says this on the message:

Activation process has been terminated 


The SERIAL was not found in the database. Most likely the SERIAL has been entered incorrectly. 

Press 'Back' to retry activating (please verify the correct input of the SERIAL) or click 'Cancel' to abort. 

If the problem persists, please visit our support homepage for possible solutions: https://support.securom.com/PAunlock/?c=1200

Under that text it just has the options ""Back"", ""Active manually"" and ""Cancel"". What should I do?
