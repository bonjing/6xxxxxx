This is a Caesar 3 disc image.

Follow these steps:

1. Use disc utility to burn this image to a CD or whatever.

2. Afterwards, put into the a PPC Mac of your choice.

3. Install it, preferably full install.

4. Leave the disc in and play.

There is no "NO CD" crack that I am aware of, you'll just have to play it with the disc in, no big deal.

Have fun!
