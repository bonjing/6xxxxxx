,scottielass,2011-02-19T15:33Z,Thank you again- the series is brilliant.
,IngesFingers,2011-03-21T09:46Z,"Robston, I've found that all six of the series you've uploaded in this format are not universally playable. Actually, they are unplayable, unusually for mp4, on PS3. Can't say for xbox.
Thanks all the same uploader, but for me it's a case of having to re-encode each file for streaming to PS3.
Bummer, eh!"
,konoyarro,2011-04-01T02:20Z,"@IngesFingers: Ever heard of PS3 Media Server? It works on all PS3s and you can even play 720p mkvs (and maybe even 1080p mkvs as well, if your connection is srong enough), no re-encoding involved whatsoever. I use it all the time, and best of all it doesn't even need to use my PS3 hard drive. "

The files are direct web-rips and primarily for iphone. I use PS3 media server all the time and is an excellent choice if you struggle with some files.

[T],Robston,2011-04-03T20:32Z,"Update re: PS3 playback, use mkvmerge to put it into an mkv container, leaving you with a .mkv file (takes about 2 minutes). 

Then play the file using PS3 media player. Worked for me and stops the speeded up playback you get with original file.
