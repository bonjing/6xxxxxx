Alan Hess

Alan Hess is a San Diego-based commercial photographer specializing in concert and live-event photography. He has photographed hundreds of concerts three songs at a time.

Alan's work has been published online and in print in the following outlets: Associatedcontent.com, Bruuce.com, Dead.net, Glidemagazine.com, Jambands.com, Jambase.com, MarkKaran.com, MiaBrazilia.com, Poughkeepsie Journal, Mill Valley Herald, Otherones.net, Pauserecord.com, Philzone.com, Photoshop User, Ranch & Coast Magazine, Rat-dog.com, Ratdog.org, Relix Magazine and Vintage Guitar Magazine.

There are many challenges to shooting concerts. Photographers have to deal with variable lighting conditions, moving subjects, tight spaces, and a limited time to get the shots they need. Concert photographers Scott Diussa and Alan Hess share some of what they have learned during their years of experience. They talk about their choices for camera gear, their shooting styles, how to anticipate shots, how to get a photo pass and signing releases, working around obstructions, lighting considerations, and the importance of shooting in spot-metering mode. The bad news is that it's tough to make a living as a concert photographer, but both of these instructors agree, it is a very rewarding hobby as a photographer.
