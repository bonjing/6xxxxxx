[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-05T01:28Z,Every episode from every season DVDRip + all the extras including additional episodes. This is the most complete collection on the internet.
,kaidokido,2011-02-05T04:36Z,"Good pack...thx.

Do you have any reality show pack, such as real hustle,My Big Friggin Wedding......"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-05T04:55Z,"Not really, I usually just stick to US tv shows. Click on my user name to see what's available."
,Redwinger815,2011-02-09T18:47Z,"how do i get the sound to work on the episodes, it works on the extras but nothing else, if you could help me out that would be great"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-09T23:44Z,"It will be your codecs. In the file, there is a notepad doc called 'TSV'. In there is a link to get free codecs, install that and you're done. It will take 10 seconds. "
,Mejjad,2011-02-20T15:47Z,"""Texted language(s): English""

Really? I can't see any sub-files and they can't be hidden, since it's avi and not mkv... I'm looking for subtitles."
,shmoney1,2011-03-07T14:21Z,"Can I get a seed please????
"
,calo2019,2011-03-10T02:46Z,please please seed. 20-70 kb/s is not a fun wait...
,oagronomo,2011-03-20T05:30Z,"review   S03_E19 S03_E20 ,  I might be wrong"
,maxandre,2011-04-05T13:45Z,"All DVD rips? You wouldn't think the DVD came with a british voiceover talking about whats coming up next......
""Season 3 Episode 20 - The Black Vera Wang"" is missing. The file named as such contains the previous episode.

Otherwise a great download. Use VLC to avoid soundproblems. Have not seen any subs."
,SorrowExe,2011-04-11T03:10Z,"Subtitles for all seasons here http://subscene.com/user/Profile.aspx?UserID=50033

,jackiss83,2011-05-18T21:43Z,Terribly slow. Takes weeks. 
,phil0s,2011-05-22T21:39Z,Thank you! Decent quality.
,agoss70,2011-05-24T15:55Z,"If you can get some acceptable speed from this torrent it is worth it, quality is ok. 
Unfortunately I have been getting 0.1-2 kb/s for a week so I give up. "
,ruthlessdeirdre,2011-06-11T23:20Z,"Season 3 error:  the episode labeled ""The Black Vera Wang"" is just a repeat of the previous episode.  I hope another torrent has the actual episode by that title. Thanks for the rest."
,jackiss83,2011-06-15T21:00Z,It finally finished after 4.5 weeks. I'll seed for the next several weeks. Higher speeds at night when I don't need the bandwidth so let them run over night and you will get it at FAR faster speeds than I did of no faster than 30k.  During the day I will do at least 200k.  Night unlimited. 
,cane53,2011-07-06T11:36Z,"some titles are woefully off the correct episode titles.

i recognized it in at least season 4 and it may be more rampant

two off the cuff are ""Swiss Deplomacy""
and ""The Calfornian 46th"" while that episode is titled ""the California 45th""

10/10 good troll"
,christo7,2011-07-10T08:11Z,"Hundreds of seeders and still insanely slow. I've been downloading the same one single episode for a week, just ONE EPISODE and some days it doesn't budge, yet I connect to many seeders and many more leechers. Fuck this torrent."
,lopote,2011-07-12T07:52Z,Sorry for my English. Now I'm down and perfect thank you very much 10/10. I registered just to tell you how happy I've done.
,christo7,2011-08-06T06:29Z,"Well I upgraded uTorrent to 3.0 and suddenly the torrent is flying along at 100kb/s, like all the rest of my downloads, so I'll quit bitching. Thanks!"
,flg8rfan,2011-08-13T19:34Z,"Just confirming these comments:

""'Season 3 Episode 20 - The Black Vera Wang' is missing. The file named as such contains the previous episode.""

""Season 3 error: the episode labeled ""The Black Vera Wang"" is just a repeat of the previous episode."""
,CakeMonster,2011-09-16T22:38Z,"Season 3 episode 19 and 20 are the same, so episode 20 is missing :("
,CakeMonster,2011-09-16T22:48Z,"Get the missing episode here

Dont forget to reseed you parasites"
,SpinCharm,2011-09-25T02:21Z,"This is not a DVD rip collection.  Season 3, for instance, is taken from UK TV (proof is that at the end of episodes, the Channel 4 logo pops up and the announcer talks about what's coming next).  "
,Ronaldspa,2011-10-06T01:06Z,"It looks that there are so many seeders but the upload is so slow. Please seed more.
Poster: Thank you."
,coolestfree,2011-10-13T07:31Z,I cannot hear the sound. Any suggestions?
,onion513,2012-02-29T12:58Z,Good that they are all here in one place BUT quality is questionable. Some episodes look like they have been sped up (just the video).... Def not a DVD RIP
,Sweetprincess,2012-03-26T12:54Z,"For all the people bitching about speeds. Downloaded within about a week for me having it on on and off. It must be you, so give TVS the respect for doing this in the first place. + TVS love what you've done with the torrents pack. Downloading a load more now :)"
,Sweetprincess,2012-03-26T13:37Z,"Saying all that, I had trouble playing with the standard codecs, installed shark 007 and seasons 1 - 5 play with horribly distorted? (if that's the right word?). Any suggestions?"
,ricochet22,2012-06-27T21:57Z,"SEED PLEASE!!

for the love of GOD, SEED!"
