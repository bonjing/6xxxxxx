Why uploading this when you don't want to seed yourself, Saki33? I read you don't like TPB because people don't seed as much compared to leeching. Is this your punishment? How on earth can someone seed if you make it impossible for them?"
,Saki33,2011-02-08T14:47Z,"I am seeding it and have devoted my entire bandwidth to just the Larry Sanders Show for now, all six seasons. That is 16 GB, and I have already seeded all of it over 150%. 

You have misunderstood my feelings about TPB. I love this site! My problem is with the people who don't love it, the people who don't seed back as much as they have downloaded. It is very discouraging to see so many drop off as soon as they complete their download, and it's a very high percentage. I have over a 2:1 sharing ratio myself, and I get very fast downloads. There is a reward system, and people who don't share much will get slower downloads and less likely to connect to me and the other seeders. 

I am sharing this series because I think it is really good and saw that others were having trouble finding it. There are other places to download, but some people won't find it if it isn't here. That is why I uploaded it. I had hoped by now that dvd rips would be available, but until that happens I will make this available.

I am sorry that you are having such slow speeds, but your own download speed is out of my control. As we gain seeders your speeds will increase and you will complete it. I guarantee that I will seed as long as there is even one person who wants it.

And, a word to the wise, get PeerBlock and always open it before youn open your torrent downloader. Nothing can protect you 100%, but PB can help."
,Saki33,2011-02-08T18:34Z,"ChurchAlarm, for your info, I am looking at the statistics and so far less than 25% of those who have completed their downloads of the other five seasons have seeded for at least 24 hours after they finished. That is typical of the average person who uses this site. Many more takers than sharers. Thanks to those of you who have done more than your part."
,ChurchAlarm,2011-02-09T00:33Z,"Thanks for your comments, Saki33. The situation has improved enormously since yesterday. 

I think the pirate bay is more popular in countries, where bandwidth is expensive.

As I have to pay 2.50 USD for every Gig I can't seed as much as I want, but I will always keep a ratio of 1:1 in general.

This means I will seed less where there are hundreds of seeders, but I will keep it much more than 1:1 when there are just a few seeders. This to keep less popular torrents alive and show my gratitude.

Cheers!"
,Saki33,2011-02-09T01:31Z,"ChurchAlarm, that seems like a sensible plan. Hope you enjoy the series. Some of the episodes are a little disappointing, but overall it's a good series.

I put the six seasons on another computer yesterday, with two uploading at the same time. It does not increase the speed of course, but if I need to reboot there will be no interruption."
,Saki33,2011-02-18T17:15Z,"It's up to you guys now. I have seeded every season for two weeks, 76 GB. Now I need to share my bandwidth to seed back the torrents I want to download for myself. If you appreciate it then help seed. Some of you have and thanks to you."
,hugekent,2011-08-19T14:17Z,Do you season one by any chance?
,hugekent,2011-08-19T14:18Z,Don't worry I found it haha
,Saki33,2011-10-19T18:28Z,Glad you found season one. I uploaded it first and realized later that I should have named it better. I have tried periodically to edit it but edit has been disabled like forever.
