The Strong Man (1926) Silent with English Intertitles, B & W

Director: Frank Capra

Under the direction of legendary director Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life), Harry Langdon is at his charming best in this handsomely produced and utterly hilarious film that vividly represents the great tradition of American slapstick.
After a tour of duty in the No-Man's-Land of World War I -- where he repels the Huns with a trusty slingshot -- a witless young Belgian (Langdon) comes to America and seeks out the dedicated pen pal (Priscilla Bonner) whose letters lifted his spirits during the heat of battle. But for Paul, the land of opportunity turns out to be a world of confusion, as his quest for Mary Brown leads him from mishap to comic disaster.

He falls into the clutches of a crafty pickpocket (Gertrude Astor), who lures him into her elegant bedchamber and violently vamps him in an effort to retrieve a wad of cash she dropped in his pocket while evading the police. Undaunted by this near-fatal seduction, Paul resumes his search and embarks on a side-splitting crusade through an artist's studio, a small town corrupted by gamblers and bootleggers, and finally ends up on a music hall stage, where his performance as Zandow the Strong Man literally brings down the house in an uproarious, unforgettable climax.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
