BBC Sound Effects Science Fiction Vol.1
WAV/PCM 44100Hz | 81 tracks | 1 CD



BBC Sound Effects No. 26 - Sci-Fi Sound Effects was a 1981 compilation of sound effects and atmospheres created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. It was the second in the BBC Sound Effects series to be credited to the Workshop. It featured sounds from popular television series Doctor Who (all from Season 1 and Blake's 7, as well as effects for the first series of the radio versions of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and James Follett's Earthsearch. In 1991 it was re-released on CD as Essential Science Fiction Sound Effects Vol.1.

Although seemingly a compilation of merely incidental effects, the album influenced pioneering electronic band The Orb enough for them to name their 1989 single "A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld" after one of its tracks.
also contains a detailed list of all tracks sorted by name

A Review:

Quite why someone would need seven different sound effects of snoring, or the clicking noises of an Eastern Grey Kangaroo, is a mystery, but 6,000 Sound Effects is nothing if not thorough, and, at best, itâ€™s worth several chuckles. This CD-ROM is aimed at those who want to use sound effects for presentations, on Web sites, desktops, or just for fun. Divided into nine categoriesâ€“explosions, machines, household, animals, nature, cartoons, people, windows, pot luckâ€“the sound effects are also searchable by keyword.

The Explosions category is chock-a-block with various war-related sounds, ranging from old-west style shootouts to the eerily realistic sounds of an air-raid nuclear siren. Household noises range from the scrumptious sound of bacon frying to the spot-on rendition of brushing teeth, perhaps useful for a dentistâ€™s Web site. Highlights of Animals is the positively diabolical growl of the Tasmanian Devil and the Persian Catâ€™s plaintive meow, though Bach causing a dog to bark is very Stupid Pet Tricks. Nature has its share of feel-good soundsâ€“brooks babbling soothingly, crickets on a hot summer nightâ€“and weather porn: tornadoes, hurricanes, and a cold hard wind straight out of Little House on the Prairie. The Cartoon and People sections are rather gag-centred: boings bonks and beeps, or the sound of a kiss, scream or slap. 6,000 Sound Effects is good value for money for those designing jokey Web sites, cheesy presentations, and comical sounds for the desktop.
