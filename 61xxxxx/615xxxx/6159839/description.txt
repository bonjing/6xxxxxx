SecureUninstaller 3.0 Portable

SecureUninstallerâ„¢ is your best bet at thoroughly removing any unwanted software from your PC. This includes 'hard-to-get-rid-of programs' that the standard WindowsÂ® Add/Remove Program feature can't seem to uninstall from your system. Unwanted programs put a big strain on your computerâ€™s resources. They occupy valuable disk space, which slow down your system. And if you try to uninstall them and they are not meticulously removed from every nook and cranny of your PC, these 'traces' pose a security threat to your system.
