,OmniNegro,2011-02-08T02:03Z,"Are you people retarded? This download gives you everything on Earth for free? Sure. I believe that. Let me guess, it requires a credit card but will never charge it too? And it polishes your boots as well.

Perhaps it really does work. But then they may as well say it cures cancer and to ignore your antiviral software because this is so great that it causes false positives too."

,Yamcha67,2012-05-10T03:33Z,"I just finished downloading this, and I'm pretty sure this is a virus.. After double clicking on the file nothing happened except the .EXE file disappeared..

That leads me to believe this file that this moronic idiot is sharing is indeed a virus..

However not an issue for me as my primary OS is Mac.. And I don't really have any important information on my Windows drive..

Anyways I would download this with caution.. I know theres a legit version of pacsteam.. But don't download it from this idiot.."
