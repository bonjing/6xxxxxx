The dramatic rescue of a Special Forces team trapped by Iraqi soldiers while on a reconnaissance mission deep inside Iraq during the first gulf war. The only help available are F16s armed with anti-tank cluster bombs, not suitable for close air support. The team calls in strike after strike; each one closer and closer. Any strike is as likely to wipe out the team as well as the attacking troops.
