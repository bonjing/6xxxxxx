After the miracle that was Dragon Quest VI, I was quite curious as to if Koichi Sugiyama could keep the quality of his work up. While the Dragon Quest VII Symphonic Suite is not nearly as cohesive and does not have the same kind of thematic continuity as Sugiyama's previous efforts in the Dragon Quest series, it is still a very enjoyable suite. The thing that makes this album stand out among the rest of the Symphonic Suites is the fact that Sugiyama's experimentations, mostly in orchestration, have reached their peak here. There are some truly inspired combinations to be found here, with "Screams from the Tower of Monsters" standing out as a particularly noteworthy effort. There were only two recordings of this suite, the first by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the most recent by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra. In this review, I will focus on the enjoyment of the tracks by themselves and also compare and contrast the two available recordings.
