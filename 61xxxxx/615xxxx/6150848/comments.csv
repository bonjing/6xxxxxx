,Kiberia,2011-02-05T11:16Z,"Sweet pancakes, 8th one!"
,omnislasher7,2011-02-05T13:13Z,i was playing the game online without cracks or anything and now i installed this shit and it wont even load the game..it shows me the magicka steam page...
,aparateq,2011-02-05T23:33Z,How to play in multi? 
,omnislasher7,2011-02-06T08:53Z,with update 7.U just have to not install the crack of the game or the update.Then make a file in ur magicka folder called steam_appid.txt and enter inside it  73050 save it and then run stean then run the game and ur set to go.
,DeLmoniKo,2011-02-06T10:49Z,Can't launch. Transfers me to Magicka steam page. Where's the problem?
,Sius_,2011-02-06T12:37Z,"AFAIK cracked version does not allow co-op or online play.

To get that just:
1.) Install the game (do NOT crack it)
2.) Install latest update (also NO cracks)
3.) Create ""steam_appid.txt"" in the root folder of the game
4.) Type ""73050"" into the .txt file, save and exit.
5.) Restart your steam
6.) Enjoy online and co-op gameplay

Note: Do not download steam demos nor try to add game into steam library as non-steam game. Simply download and install skidrow version of the game with latest update, do not crack it, restart steam and run the game. Worked for me, should work for you too.

Last tested on Update 7 and worked flawlessly for me. "
[V],DutchReleaseTeam,2011-02-06T16:54Z,"this is the first time i am trying this game , after installing the game, update 8 and copying the crack files all i get is a blackscreen , cursor and sound

,Schlarb,2011-02-07T04:11Z,"I've done everything as I should, but when I click the launcher, nothing happens, it's as if I didn't even do anything, I have Windows 7 64 bit, any help on this?"
,globalwonder,2011-02-07T10:16Z,"My PC was infected with a nasty malware which I believe I received either from this download (update 8, which I was installing when my computer crashed) or from the original SKIDROW installation. It seems others on here have been installing it with no problems, but just a warning to others, I have malwarebytes and AVG internet security and neither protected me"
,RoadVictim,2011-02-07T12:08Z,"Sius_

Yes, that worked for me aswell on update 7. It does not work on update 8. Try it yourself."
,marcebol_88,2011-02-08T02:14Z,"yup.. same here.. installed update 8 and it doesnt work anymore, reinstalled update 7 and its good again.. any other way of making 8 work??"
,nebojsa986,2011-02-08T03:04Z,"Install update 8 with upd7 exe, use the exe as standard crack."
,marcebol_88,2011-02-08T10:01Z,ok.. this update sucks! until somebody tells me how to make it work..
,didii,2011-02-08T18:50Z,"WARNING: Online won't work anymore with this update! If you've already installed this update don't worry: just install update 7 (again) and it will work again.
For those who don't know how to play online, check above. Or go to the download for update 7 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6145982/Magicka_[Update_7]_[SKIDROW]_[Freeisland.org]) first reaction if it is unclear here.
Thanx for the upload though."

,ReaperOne1Two2,2011-02-09T18:38Z,"@Globalwonder 
Yah, I'm going to have to agree with you on this one. Of three torrents either an old popular  Adobe Cs2 one everyone used to use Update 4 or Update 8 torrents one of them have a malware in them somewhere. I'm leaning twords this one but investigating the problem at the moment. Everyone who is using Msn/hotmail/live messenger if you installed this double check to see at the top of your window if it says something like 2 places. I'm using Security Essentials which didn't pick it up on auto detect either not even a false positive. Will post back when I figure more out."
,Torbax,2011-02-13T21:36Z,I got a problem after defeating the Boss at chapter 6 ... It just crashes to desktop .. I looked for fixes but nothing of that seems to help...anyone here knows as solution maybe??

Tried the multiplayer instruction, doesn't  work! Game always crashes when i tried to launch it! Pls help, for love of god.."
,negativesexy,2011-02-16T18:34Z,"I've installed the game and this update. When I run the game all I get is a momentary black screen.

Anyone able to help?"
,Ifyouare,2011-02-17T12:06Z,"So, I finally got online working and stuff, but I can't seem to get past the Chapter 1 Boss fight because of the cut scene. Are there any other updates besides 7 that work online? 8,10 doesn't work, I've already tried."
,hennytheman,2011-02-28T13:15Z,so... what is the status on the update version working with lan play?
,yotis,2011-03-15T19:01Z,"If you have problems with black screen on startup:

1. Uninstall ALL NET Frameworks 3.5 or lower
2. Install fresh Framework 3.5

worked for me"
