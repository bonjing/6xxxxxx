U218 is a good collection of songs. It was designed to fit into almost everyone's taste. There's not a `wrong' song on it. Why?...well, just because every song on this compilation is a hit. Long time fans will condemn it to perdition, they will tell you that THE BEST OF 1980-1990 and 1990-2000 are better collections...and it's true! but that's not a reason to say that this album is a bad thing. 

It opens with "I Will Follow" and then the chain of hits is unleashed: "Beautiful Day", "With Or Without You"...etc. The album offers two new songs. Both of them could've been better, I think neither the collaboration with Green Day or "Window In The Skies" are going to become U2's classics. 

With this recent U218 celebration, there's a lot of stuff being offered. A single CD, a CD plus a DVD, a DVD...but the best of them all is the book "U2 BY U2"...that was designed for the long time fans!. 

But U218 The Singles is a good choice por those who want to have all the best known songs in one record. The booklet has the lyrics and the packaging is a nice one. So if you're looking for that good gift for these Christmas, this one is going to make it for you.
