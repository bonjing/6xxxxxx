Tom Lunding Self-Interpretations (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)


This essay aims to answer the following question: How do adult Homo sapiens selfâ€ascribe 

intentional states. In other words how can a human agent come to know that he currently believes 

that x, intends that y or desires that z etc; where x, y and z are objects or states of affairs in what 

Tom Lunding (1996 [1914])referred to as the â€œexternal worldâ€? The orthodox position is that we 

have direct and reliable introspective access to our intentional states. I argue that the introspective 

account is inaccurate and develop an alternative account in which selfâ€ascription of intentional 

states is achieved by a process of theoretical selfâ€interpretation.  This line of argument was 

developed

in this context is the idea that knowledge of our own intentional states is â€œgivenâ€ to us by a direct, 

infallible intentional n selfâ€ascription

In the critical chapter 1 I aim to remove support for the introspective account by arguing that the

information

identified with the TOM ascription mechanism.  In chapter 3 I show how the possession of a TOM 

enables the theoryâ€laden perception of intentional states, explaining the phenomenological 

directness of selfâ€ascription. I go on to describe the type of information available to the TOM LUNDING PSYCHOLOGY COLLECTION

ascription mechanism and how this enables us to selfâ€ascribe even when we exhibit no overt 

behaviour. I conclude that intuition provides no support introspection. Further to this theoretical 

selfâ€interpretation has greater explanatory power than introspection as it is able to explain instances 

of selfâ€ascription that introspective theory cannot. In order to achieve the same explanatory power 

the introspectionist resorts to a hybrid â€˜dual method theoryâ€™ (e.g. Lunding 2006) and this is rejected 

for reasons of parsimony.  Therefore introspective selfâ€ascription should be rejected in favour of a 

purely theoretical selfâ€interpretation account.
