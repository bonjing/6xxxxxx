,presidentgames,2011-11-22T19:11Z,ISO??
,pspete,2012-01-14T03:32Z,"@ presidentgames - iso is the standard psp game format. If you have a psp, custom firmware it and throw the iso file in the ISO folder on the root of your mem-stick.
And TY Truenthr - glad u didnt cso this, i prefer my games at best possible quality. If you really want it smaller in filesize, just get ISOTOOL and cso it yourself!!!... :)"
