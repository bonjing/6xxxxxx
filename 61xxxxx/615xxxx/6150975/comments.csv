You said ""This DVD is designed for non Apple hardware""

does this apply for burning DVD's using toast or image mounting/burning to ext-HD using Disk Utility?  Basically I get this message when I try to burn image to firewire HD:

""Restore Failure: Could not find any scan information. The source image needs to be imagescanned before it can be restored.""

I usually burn DMG files on my mac and burn ISO on my PCs (which this image is) but right now my PC is an unbootable hackintosh from trying to upgrade from your 6.2 - 6.5 and I figured making a DMG from ISO was a waste of time.  Thanks for your patience :)"
