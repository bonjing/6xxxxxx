,TryAgainLOL,2011-05-20T11:54Z,"What a fucking disturbed little cuntshit you are. From your fucking ""keygens"" it's painfully obvious you don't know shit about programming: textboxes are unlocked, random seeds are not initialized - so everyone will get same fucking key, you fucking idiot, you don't know how to compress exe and how to compress audio and embed it, so you make fucking 30Mb ""keygen"". 
But, wait, wait how can such a fucking retarded person disassemble and reverse programs to make keygens? Well, sure it can't. It just takes (steals) a bunch of keys from actual working keygens (of course without crediting those people who do shit), adds some shitty emo .wav, slaps his name all over it and calls it his superawesome ""keygen"". Fucking idiot, what is the fucking point (besides your fucking obvious public masturbation)? 

Here is first 5 keys you'll get from this crap (you can see them stored in exe in plain text @1349300):

3603-47067-6809
2168-93212-1453
2664-93214-1292
3507-47015-7956
3507-47015-7956

Fucking butt-raped little twat."
,TyMod,2011-05-28T00:42Z,Look bitch.  I didn't copy anyones keys.  These are keys I occuried myself and plus you can't copy keygens since they have special agorithems that create keys with the Scene Releases initials in it I.E: 000-000-000-000-RLD So go suck a dick.
