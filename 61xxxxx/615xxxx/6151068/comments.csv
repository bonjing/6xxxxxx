,Mikey320,2011-02-06T04:49Z,"confused on how the keygen works, when i select dvd creator program and then hit generate, it just come up with this really long code/password, but then when i register it it wants a username and the keygen doesnt give me one, someone please help, i dont get it???"
[V],Anacondaz,2011-02-07T02:05Z,"@mikey320
after u install and replace the files in the crack folder
run the keygen and select the product
when u generate
the name near generate key is the username which comes in the key you generated
first copy that name only and paste it
then copy the remaning and paste in the key
done"

,digididme,2011-02-24T13:11Z,"Help! I Dl a while back and for some reason, it came back as your trial has ended, etc. So anyway, I dl this one and tried all the serial's and I guess they are all used up or I am not sure but not working for me.. Tried them all and followed all directions but still not able to use it fully. I am using XP SP3, so that shouldn't be the issue. Not being blocked by Mcafee..I tries STX! and tried from the (L)..No good. Please tell me what I am doing wrong. I really dig this Creator..Thanks for your time..."
,digididme,2011-02-24T13:13Z,"Oh, sorry. I thought this was another Torrent."

,phillyblunt23,2011-03-11T04:54Z,"also for everyone having issues, i used the first part of the generated serial (STX!LZ) as the username (u click on the keygen and generate one for the product of dvd creator) and everything after that part was the serial... if you need anymore help well... i dunno what to tell you...."
[T],dynstab2,2011-03-16T12:58Z,"Suggestion: Wrap your keygens/cracks in an archive format (RAR or 7Zip or...) so Norton File Insight won't detect and remove them half-way through download, urging newbies like me to abort. Thanks anyway."
,Cgoff87,2011-05-05T18:31Z,"Works perfect. Whoever put that -5 on this needs to be put down...

+1 Thank you very much!!!!"

,Adamattard,2011-07-09T12:58Z,"This is very difficult to understand. But after a bit of mucking around i got it. first of all install xilisoft dvd creator, once you have done that close dvd creator and open the keygen. Once the keygen opens select Dvd Creator from the drop list then click 'make key.' Leave the keygen open and open dvd creator. Click help then click entre license code. for your username put:   STX!LZ and for your licsence code put:     STX!LZ64747125420EMU9858-59FD-BC73-B87A"
,mamaLee,2011-07-15T21:46Z,Thanks Adamattard! Works perfectly. Awesome program. Will update if it stops working

,pepper150,2011-11-24T20:26Z,"ok started working (i think) i didn't notice the crack files you had to put into the xilisoft folder, you should put that in the description for all the newbies."
,GIlover,2012-03-13T10:14Z,it works..the BIG BUT!!! is if it is a quality dvd creator im using it now currently burning i'll tell if it is worth a time :)
