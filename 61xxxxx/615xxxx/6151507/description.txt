Running Time: 1 hour 32 minutes (approx.)



In this version I\'ve removed somethings that were deemed unnecessary. You can enjoy a different feel to the movie with the changes I\'ve made to it.



Plot: Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) a transferred Officer, just arrived at Detroit P.D. is told to suit up, meet with his new partner Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) and head out on patrol. On patrol they encounter Clarence Bodicker (Kurtwoord Smith in his most iconic role as a baddie) and his goons.

They track him down to an abandoned factory, and enter it. Murphy is separated from his partner Lewis. He is caught by Bodicker\'s Goons and literally shot to pieces.

His is airlifted to a hospital, but his wounds are too great and he expires.

His body however is transferred discreetly to Omni Consumer Products (O.C.P) and they have a different agenda on their minds for Murphy....
