,m8cet,2011-03-13T21:45Z,"This version of INSTALL.EXE is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need a x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.

I am using Windows7 Ultimate x64...I dont think the information given here is right.....This is a 16bit program and there is no way x64 systems (win7) will be able to run it with truncated DOS support."
,m8cet,2011-03-13T22:05Z,Okay our time is not that bad...Here's a way out...but this installer provided here wont help....If you are following the below page's instruction you have to use its own installer....
