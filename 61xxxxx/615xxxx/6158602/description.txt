Synopsis:

Well,  I don't think I am qualified enough to describe the plot of this movie. You've got to watch it to understand it.
All I can say is, this is the movie which features the cult classic "Yab se hui hai mohabbat"

Many thanks to Neelouli for sharing this classic with us. All I've done is joined all parts in a single file and created a torrent.

You can watch the same movie in parts on Neelouli's channel on You Tube.

Bonus: 21 seconds of special deleted scene from the movie DVD. 

Encoding-
Video: DivX
Audio: mp3

Quality: CD or a VHS Rip, not a crystal clear quality, but watchable. Has 3-4 clicks where the video was joined, and has a small splash screen for "Neelouli Presents", which last some 3 seconds or so, nothing too distracting.
Sound quality is bad in the beginning, specially during songs or loud background music, but sit through that, and I promise you, you just cannot stop watching it, until it's finished.

File Size: 775 MB, No change in Audio or Video quality from the original.

Enjoy.
