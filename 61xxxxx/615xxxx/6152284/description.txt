Vincent Eugene Craddock (February 11, 1935â€“October 12, 1971), better known as Gene Vincent, was an American musician who pioneered the styles of rock and roll and rockabilly. His 1956 top ten hit with his Blue Caps, "Be-Bop-A-Lula", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly. He is a member of the Rock and Roll and Rockabilly Halls of Fame


This excellent Gene Vincent best-of is programmed to split the difference between his wildest rockabilly performances (the over the top "B-I-Bickey-Bi, Bo-Bo-Go") and his stabs at commercially calculated teen pop ("Wear My Ring"). Through it all, Vincent gets impeccable backing from the Blue Caps, a fierce and precise outfit.

Axeman Cliff Gallup deserves his legendary status for his litany of notes on "Race With the Devil" alone. Drummer Dickie Harrell is unable to contain his abandon. 15 years old and given to spontaneous fits of screaming (check out his outbursts on "Be-Bop-a-Lula"), he brought an extra dose of anarchy to the band. To hear just how good they were, pay special attention to the previously unreleased backing track for "Rocky Road Blues."
