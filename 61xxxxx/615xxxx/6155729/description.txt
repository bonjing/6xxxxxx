Notes: These are new recordings.

The BBC never played most of Series 01 & 02 http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/steptoe_and_son.html

(These might have been in the "LOST" by the BBC (Lost = They binned them)
I found many of the missing and cleaned them up and posted as a torrent.
6 Months+ later and the BBC also seemed to have found them.
Not the first time I've noticed the Beeb find missing stuff after a torrentv of them has been posted

Assuming they did find them or used a better cleaner than I have; I decided to re-record them.




Wiki:

Steptoe & Son is a British sitcom written by Ray Galton & Alan Simpson about two rag & bone men living in Oil Drum Lane, a fictional street in Shepherd's Bush, London.

Characters
The father, Albert Steptoe (portrayed by Wilfrid Brambell), is lazy, stubborn, narrow-minded, foul-mouthed, & has revolting personal habits. Albert is content with his place in the world, utterly unpretentious & downright cynical. He can be extremely vindictive & does everything he can to prevent Harold, his son, improving himself ¶ especially if it means him leaving home.

Harold (played by Harry H. Corbett) is also obstinate, though prone to moments of enthusiasm about an idea. He wants to move up in the world ¶ most of all to escape from the family home & his stifling relationship with his father. Harold has aspirations. He likes to see his business as being in antiques rather than junk. He is a dreamer & idealist. Politically, Harold is a Labour supporter who is appalled at his father's reactionary views. He aims to improve his mind & his social circle but always fails, often thanks to Albert's deliberate put-downs or sabotage. Harold's exasperation & disgust at his father's behaviour often results in his repeating the catchphrase "You dirty old man."


Situation
The episodes often revolve around (sometimes violent) disagreements between the two men, Harold's attempts to bed women & momentary interest over things found on his round. As with many of the best examples of British comedy, much of the humour derives from the pathos of the protagonists' situation, especially Harold's continually-thwarted (usually by the elder Steptoe) attempts to "better himself" & the unresolvable love/hate relationship that exists between the pair.

Extras:

The Galton & Simpson Playhouse - S01 - E04 - The Offer - (Remake)
(cast: Freddie Jones, John Thomson)
Quite strange to hear this as it's played more straight than a comedy, & comes over quite dark in places. Best listened to after hearing the original.

Steptoe & Son At Buckingham Palace 10 minutes made for ?. (Royal Variety Show)

Steptoe & Son Down Under. Assume it was made Down Under as many big UK TV actors went to Australia to plug shows - More of a St&-Up than a show. 

Galton & Simpson Interview

Very Nearly An Armful - The Galton & Simpson Story
Stephen Merchant celebrates the writing partnership of Ray Galton & Alan Simpson, the ground-breaking duo who brought social realism to British comedy and helped lay the foundations for modern day classics like The Office, Peep Show and The Thick Of It.
