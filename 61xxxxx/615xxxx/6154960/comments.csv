,m3n3t3k3l,2011-02-16T00:01Z,is there a non-FLAC version?
,thrillajacko,2011-02-21T17:11Z,"how come flac is bcoming so popular these days? isn't mp3 better and can be used a lot easier (ie, can be played on more playyers, smaller in size, easier to convert to 128 bitrate, etc)"
[H],politux,2011-02-21T17:26Z,"People prefer to listen to music in FLAC because it employs lossless compression.  This means it maintains the same sound quality as the source. 

mp3 uses lossy compression and even at higher bit rates it will lose some of the subtlety of the music.  

If your music player doesn't play FLAC, I suggest getting one that does.  Otherwise you can look for a torrent that is already in mp3 or convert these files."
,thrillajacko,2011-02-25T18:19Z,"Politux, thanks so much for that info! By the way I appreciate all your hard work and the fact you have uploaded what you whatever the format! My ipod does play flac...i think but i have a LOT of music lol so i always try to convert it to 128 bitrate - that way it sounds ok and economical with space!!! i LOVE music man so much! :o) thanks again!"
,thrillajacko,2011-02-25T18:22Z,ps. i already have some software but was wondering do you have a best converting software you could recommend? i prefer to lose all tags and when i put into itunes or whatever just tag them the way i want. some software lets you convert but then retagging each track individually takes some time! :o)
[H],politux,2011-02-26T01:13Z,"Not sure if it will help you as I use Linux, but I use a free program called ""Sound Converter"" that came with my distro.
