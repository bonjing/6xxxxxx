ABOUT THE SHOW

Bit fÃ¶r Bit (Bit by Bit) was a Swedish TV-series about
computers. Six episodes were broadcasted in 1989 as part of
the youth segment called Unga TvÃ¥an on Sveriges Television
(SVT). It was a mixture of education and entertainment,
where each episode had competitions in games and demos, and
usually an educational clip and examples of CGI-animation.
There was a slightly confused hostess (Gila Bergqvist) and
an animated co-host called Orcon (sp?). Orcon would slightly
change his voice, personality and role inbetween the
episodes. John Minson was a British journalist who did
exclusive reports from the UK. The last episode was hosted
by Jan Trolin.

Bit fÃ¶r Bit was the first, if not only, TV-show that brought
the demoscene into the public eye on a frequent basis. They
displayed demos as backdrop to the hostess, showing unedited
scrolltexts with greetings, fuckings and so on. Each episode
showed a collage of Amiga demos, supposedly sent in by the
demo groups, and in the following episode a winner was
announced. The winner was selected by a jury. Several famous
demoscene groups appeared: Fairlight, Rebels, Defjam,
Kefrens, Phenomena, Byterapers, etc. In E01 and E02 the
vertical synchronization was off, so the demos were displayed
wrong. The end credits was a part from a Phenomena megademo,
with the song Let's Party by Firefox.

Every episode had a gaming competition called "teledataspelet."
The games played were GeeBee Air Rally, California Games, 
Paperboy and RVF Honda. They were played using the phone as
a joystick. The beeps of the phone accompanied the sound of
the game, and the commentry of the hostess.

There were examples of CGI-animation in most episodes. Just
like the demos and games they were badly credited but they
were made by for example John Lasseter and Jeff Minter.
