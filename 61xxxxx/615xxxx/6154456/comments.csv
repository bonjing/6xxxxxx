(they also released a 720p copy)

 By all means, if you enjoy a {C_P} release forward it and re upload it but please DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME,
 it is dis-respectful to the person who captured and encoded the file.
 If you want to re upload a {C_P} file you can add some screenshots or another txt file to the folder to change the hash but not change the filename and remove the tag of the group who created it.
 You are more likely to get yourself a poor reputation than a good one by doing this kind of thing, if you have nothing of your own to upload re upping other ppls work is fine as long as you do not change filenames without doing anything yourself to re-encode or improve it.
 Changing filenames so it looks like you encoded it is just lame."
