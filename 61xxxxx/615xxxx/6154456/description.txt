Ash, Pikachu, and company stop by in a house where they intend to watch a match of the PokÃ©mon Baccer World Cup between the evolutionary line of Elekid and Beldum. Brock explains about what the PokÃ©mon Baccer World Cup is, and an image of a mysterious man shows up after the match in the TV and exhibits its team formed by a Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, that quickly drags the spinning-top shaped object in the floating pyramid, making the gang want to see them live. Recognizing them as legendary PokÃ©mon, Team Rocket starts getting excited that they should capture them. A Nurse Joy then shows up, saying that she is also very excited for the match. Ash then proposes to reach Crown City before the day's end, where the next PokÃ©mon Baccer World Cup will be held.
Meanwhile, a Zoroark rests in a large carrier plane, and Zorua fumbles out of Zoroark's hair, who seems to be the child of Zoroark. Suddenly, an automatic door opens, where Zoroark and her son find themselves face-to-face with Raikou, Entei and Suicune. Behind them, the business man Grings Kodai and his assistant, Rowena, stay in a chamber. Rowena tells Kodai that the final adjustments are ready. Kodai then tests Zoroark's use of illusions by commanding the illusions of the legendary PokÃ©mon to attack Zoroark. Zorua tries to attack Raikou, but Zoroark stops him and puts him into her hair for safety. Kodai asks Zoroark if she cherishes her son that much, but Zoroark quickly transforms into Raikou. Zoroark fills the area with thunderclouds that ascends to Kodai and Rowena. At the same time, Kodai activates an illusion in his bracelet. The thunderclouds penetrate them, but Kodai reveals that he and Rowena are illusions, and that the cameras were also fooled by the illusions.
Kodai's bodyguard, Goone, soon announced that they will be arriving in Crown City soon. Kodai dismisses the illusions of the legendary PokÃ©mon, and Zoroark transform back to her own form. After such, Zorua jumps from his mother's head and foresights the zone. Kodai says that the test is over and that Zoroark did a marvelous performance. He sends out a Ninjask, and it captures Zorua, paralyzing Zoroark in place to prevent her from saving him. After Zorua has been taken away, Zoroark immediately rams the ceiling, trying to go after the Ninjask, but fails. Kodai threatened Zoroark, that if she wants her son back, she will need to stay obedient, in which Zoroark roars at him in response.
Unknown to Zoroark, Zorua managed to escape from his PokÃ©mon captors consisting of Scizor and Ninjask, and falls out of the carrier ship. During the fall, he finds a group of Hoppip, Skiploom, and Jumpluff. After a while, Zorua falls off, but quickly transforms into a Skiploom to float safely towards the ground. Inside the plane, Goone confirms to Kodai that Zorua has escaped, but this hasn't changed Kodai's plans, since Zoroark is unaware of Zorua's escape.
Elsewhere, Zorua angers a group of Vigoroth after falling on top of one. Ash and his friends arrived and called out their PokÃ©mon to stop the fighting. The Vigoroth soon lose interest and run off. Zorua claims that he didn't need any help, to which Ash, Dawn, and Brock argue with him until they all realize that Zorua is talking to them through telepathy. Zorua then says that he is going to Crown City where his Mom, Zoroark, is. Ash and his friends agree to help him, and Zorua shows off his ability by transforming into Ash. After Kodai blackmails Zoroark, by using an illusion image of Zorua, Zoroark began destroying Crown City in the guises of Raikou, Suicune, and Entei.

She then reveals herself to the gang while telling them everything she discovered. She tells them how 20 years ago he not only tampered with the ripple gaining his visions but he attacked Celebi reversing the flow killing the greenery. His power, however, is rapidly leaving him.
While Celebi plays in the tree, one of Kodai's machines discovers it. Soon, the PokÃ©mon begins to fight against him. Before fainting, Zorua sends one final message to his mom before fainting.
