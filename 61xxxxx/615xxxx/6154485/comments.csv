[V],Anacondaz,2011-02-07T01:34Z,"@noel_lee

and run it for vista and 7 run it as administrator
all my uploads are scanned with bit defender total security 2011"
,noel_lee,2011-02-07T07:59Z,"sorry,but i dont seem to understand ur twisted procedure of applying the patch.would be better if u explain the steps..when i run the patch as admin,and the target file is there by default..but when i press button start,it says ,FILE NOT FOUND.thanks anyways."
,klee777,2011-03-05T16:51Z,am i allowed to update the application?
,aliciap,2011-03-14T21:26Z,"1) Install""alarm_clock_pro.exe"" normally
2) Do not automatically start the program
3) Apply the pack, serch for the .exe program in the place you have install

Works fine in windows 7

Can I update?"
,Ragdim,2012-01-23T04:11Z,"@aliciap Followed those steps, but it says alarm clock pro has now become unstable when I try to launch it. Wtf?"
,suazeey,2012-03-21T02:01Z,"I get the 'unstable' message as well, despite all the common compatibility tricks.

Windows 7 (64-bit) tells me it's an issue with color/display agreement between the program and my settings. The program changes the settings for as long as the error message is up. They revert on [ok].

Insight, anyone?"
