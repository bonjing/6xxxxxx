,thienkle,2012-02-27T12:46Z,"I cannot view the files! What must I download to open the files? Am I missing a codec? I have tried Media Player Home Cinema, VLC, and Windows Media PLayer but nothing works. PLEASE HELP."
,divinunn,2012-04-01T22:19Z,"@thienkle -open the window that holds your video file and click on help. Check the prob your havin. No video or audio? One or the other? More than likely a codec. they're free but your ""help"" will tell you exactly where to go:)"
