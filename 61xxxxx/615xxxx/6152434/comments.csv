Thanks."
,sabian.ro,2011-02-22T22:26Z,Anything for Win7 SP1?
,truenorther,2011-02-23T01:22Z,Just tested 6 of the activators that have worked on new Win 7 SP1(Build 7601) today. They're all dead in the water now. Good thing is a system restore got me back to build 7600 & the activation worked again. I would turn off auto updates and wait a month or so for a new activator. DO NOT UPDATE!
,cpt.greenshirt.2011,2011-02-24T03:05Z,can someone tell me how to use this?
,unbaiat,2011-02-24T15:53Z,VIRUS!!!

,vermintor,2011-03-01T10:24Z,"to turn off windows activation technoligy....
run/servises/ then scroldown list untill you find windows activation. right click it,goto properties and disable, you can still use windows update.
only do this when you have activated your copy.
if services is not showing windows activation you will have to wait untill it installs as a update, dont worry this can be turned off.

hope this helps you all "
,verlou,2011-03-03T10:35Z,"I downloaded your activator, & now my windows won't boot!!!!!"

,skate_1_boy,2011-03-17T04:34Z,Working on Windows 7 Starter x86 SP1 Thanks!
,illtrick,2011-03-18T07:53Z,"This worked well. Then SP1 came along and screwed things up.  Also KB971033 somehow flew below the radar and was installed.  I've since uninstalled 1033.  However despite this I can NOT get this activator to work again!  Now I've got Microsoft threatening to sue me unless I come up with a way to sell the millions of unsold Zune players.   Okay. so maybe not yet, but it could happen if I don't get this sucker re-activated!  Help would be appreciated!"
,pckanjer,2011-03-19T10:46Z,"Worked With Windows 7 Ultimate x64 SP1

,GigaBoii,2011-03-24T01:07Z,Does this work for the updated service pack? Would be a disaster if the update ruined my computers. Please let me know.
,gomatto,2011-03-25T05:10Z,Working on Win7 Ultimate b. 7600. Just remember to keep internet unplugged until activation is successful. No virus I can see.
,CaptainSpike,2011-03-26T05:46Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD! This Torrent freezes your system at the Boot level. 
,gomatto,2011-03-26T09:07Z,Works on my mac (vmware fusion) but on my old computer (pentium 4 lol) when I run loader crack it keeps resetting. I had to clear mbr which consequently put back to 29 days remaining. Internet doesn't work. Which loader is the best in manual mode?
,gomatto,2011-03-27T10:35Z,"Updated to SP1 w/Windows Update, works fine."
,CodeFanatic,2011-04-02T21:02Z,"Do not download. It created my system to hang at ""Verifying DMI Pool data""

This issue can be caused by any of the below reasons.
    Corrupt boot files on the computer.
    Settings for hard disk drive are not correct.
    Floppy diskette or CD in computer causing issue.
    Boot devices not set properly.
    BIOS corrupt or misc. setting not set properly.
    Connections loose or disconnected.
    Bad Hard disk drive or other bad hardware."
,Languine,2011-04-03T19:30Z,Works fantastic! (Windows 7 w/Service pack 1)
,gomatto,2011-04-04T16:01Z,"@CodeFanatic one pc I did this on which was an older pentium 4 began rebooting at verf. Dmi pool data but I reinstalled win7 and didnt activate and it worked fine. Ran loader and it fucked up again. It's not persistent enough to be a virus, but it just doesnt work on some hardware. Works on MacBook through vmware though."

,harvengure,2011-04-25T05:15Z,"It was very quick to download and was a one click solution.  I clicked Loader and it went to work and now my Windows 7 Ultimate is activated.

Word to the wise, write down and store your product key in a safe place.  I did not and the sticker is faded and my windows got fubard so I had to resort to this."

There are two activators in the torrent, just extract, and run one, if that one doesn't work, try the other.
