,gmjh,2011-02-06T16:42Z,This file stops working after a few seconds on VLC and keeps breaking up on other players. Is it just me this happens to?
,gmjh,2011-02-06T18:56Z,actually it looks like the file I downloaded was corrupted somehow. Redownloaded the same file and it works fine
,jox74,2011-02-13T03:37Z,it works just fine for me
