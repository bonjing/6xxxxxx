All files are mpgs, and avi's.

The alphabet is in one file and 

all the other files are vocabulary files

that were originally flash card files which I pulled

off the screen in real time, getting great

resolution and to which I added voice.

So, It came out very well.

Please enjoy, share and seed as long as you can.


Thanks,
