Then Play On is the third studio album by blues-rock band Fleetwood Mac, first released in September 1969. It was the first of their original albums to feature Danny Kirwan and the last with Peter Green. Jeremy Spencer did not feature on the album apart from \\\"a couple of piano things\\\" (according to Mick Fleetwood in Q magazine in 1990). The record, appearing after the group\\\'s sudden success in the pop charts, offered a broader stylistic range than the classic blues of the group\\\'s first two albums.
