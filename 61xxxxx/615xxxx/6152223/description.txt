Dr.Explain v4.1.455

Dr.Explain is an automated help authoring tool for creating CHM files, HTML help, on-line manuals, and printable documentation. It will analyze the structure of your software interface and will generate help topic drafts for it automatically. If you are a Web developer, then the HTML parsing capabilities will help you quickly document all significant parts of your Web site as well. It doesn't matter what technology or tools you used to design your software GUI. The Dr.Explain can make help documentation for any solution. The Dr.Explain tool is exceptionally useful for authoring help files with many screenshots and technical illustrations. The built-in capturing tool analyzes internal structure of captured windows or web forms and automatically creates numbered annotations for all significant GUI elements: buttons, fields, options, menus, toolbars, and so on. You must just add some descriptive text to complete the topic. With other help authoring tools those operations would take hours while with the Dr.Explain you can accomplish it in minutes.


With the Dr.Explain you can easily generate a complete array of user documentation in various formats from a single source file. The Dr.Explain can make CHM help files, HTML on-line manuals and printable manuals in RTF. Electronically distribute your help file with application; put it on your product website; or deliver it as a printed manual within the box. Many software vendors have already appreciated the simplicity of the Dr.Explain tool.
