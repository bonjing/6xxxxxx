After spending several years with the post-punk band Sidecar Kisses, vocalist/guitarist Ritzy Bryan and bassist Rhydian Dafydd left to launch their own group, the Joy Formidable, in 2007. Formed in North Wales, the band later resettled in London, where original drummer Justin Stahley was replaced by Matt Thomas. The Joy Formidable began building a buzz in 2008, making appearances at several British festivals and earning high marks from publications like The Guardian, which recommended the bandâ€™s \"darkly joyous soft-loud racket.\"
