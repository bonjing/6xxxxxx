From the Label
His first electric album is full of the raw and desolate country blues that made Mississippi Fred as famous as the Mississippi River is wide. Whether he played with slides made from bottle necks, or the apocryphal steakbone, Fred's brand of Delta blues was delivered with a solid confidence and an honesty that cuts right into your soul. Fred taught the blues to a generation of rockers; Bonnie Raitt learned slide guitar from him and The Rolling Stones copped "You Got To Move" directly from his original.
