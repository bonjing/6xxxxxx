For instance, Tags, WebNoteHappy, Deskovery...none work.  I've tried using Little Snitch, and I've tried allowing the connection...

I feel for you.. But as with any serial number software, you have to get the version right, and the software companies are not dumb either.

If they seem a serial number in one of these things, they are apt to pirate it, meaning it won't wok even if LittleSnitch is on, and they are not able to connected to your computer,

Consider the Sn's for CS5 master collection, most don't work, but eventually you may be lucky enough to find one that does,

What I do is I runt iSeriaReader, an/or SerialSeeker, if that doesn't give me a code, then I run it through KCNScrew to see if they have a different code - this has worked in the past - good luck!"

I shouldn't be upset about the ones that haven't worked anyway..it's not like I paid for them. :)"
