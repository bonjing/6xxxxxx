PlayStation-Ready HD Movie Trailers
7th of February, 2011


Since there are lots of new TV spots on the Super Bowl night,
it seemed right to make special release of this trailer
pack. So, everything is in HD 1080p, except The Eagle and
Take Me Home Tonight (and Terra Nova, of course): I've waited
long enough for them to appear in HD, but they failed. Enjoy!
