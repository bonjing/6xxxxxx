,ninthcrystal,2011-02-06T18:28Z,"Hi, I'm known online as either Ninthcrystal, Judah420, ExKiller069, EK069 and ak47killa14. 
This copy of the movie looks great and all you need to play it if you are having problems is VLC, you can download it for free, just search it in Google. "
,michaelrwatson,2011-02-06T20:05Z,"Wow, such detailed info--codec IDs, color space sampling, etc, etc.... but NO SUBTITLES FOR THE FOREIGN PARTS.  Complete waste of bandwidth. You dumbfucks."
,werchter001,2011-02-09T16:01Z,"to mwatson: it's free and you complain about a bit you cant understand? I suggest you put in the effort yurself and provide it for all of us anctiously awaiting the bits of subtitled foreign. But i guess you're to big a &^%$^ for that. 
to heist: keep up the good work and thx for keeping the spirit of free sharing alive! "
,PokerPimp,2011-02-11T06:35Z,Just download the klite codec pack for free from codecguide.com and it updates windows media player to play all video types. I have not found a video on this site that doesnt play with the media player.
,choppergirl,2011-02-15T00:08Z,"This film seems to be in a mix of ocassional French subtitles in the film, and spoken Polish, Russian, and American English.  I'm sure it was for dramatic effect, but it makes it almost unwatchable without subtitles in your language, which are absent.

Quality and sound is good.  Sound doesn't begin until National Geographic logo pops up in the beginning, so skip forward to check that sound is workign"

@PokerPimp - The best media player on the market is V.L.C. It automatically plays everything you throw at it...I've yet to come across a file it wont play.Wind media player is imo kinda buggy and less easy to use."

,jiveclive,2011-03-11T04:22Z,"michelwatson is a hostile little man. Poor bugger. I wonder why? Teeny pecker issues, perhaps? Momma didn't love him enough? Still in the closet? I hope you can move beyond it soon, my man. Don't give up, mmkay? "
,bytehog,2011-04-07T03:04Z,"mrwatson has a point about the subtitles, he's maybe a little harsh, but his point is well taken."
