La Petite Manouche â€“ translated roughly as â€œthe little gypsyâ€ is collaboration of Burke Goffe and Robbie Averill, both graduates of the CPIT Jazz School in Christchurch, NZ who have spent the course of their studies having the style of gypsy jazz drilled through their souls by the main guitar tutor Bob Heinz. Consequently, they have come out and formed La Petite Manouche - a guitar duo with influences of gypsy and modern jazz, creating a unique fusion of music. Influences are widespread, ranging from Django to classical and baroque music, free jazz to fusion, celtic and world music, even popular and dance music. Notable influences include BirÃ©li LagrÃ¨ne, Sylvain Luc, The Rosenberg Trio, Ulf Wakenius, Pat Metheny, and Jonathan Kreisberg.
