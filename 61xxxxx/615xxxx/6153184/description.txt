More Ways to Create Equations

* Entering Math by Hand: Enter equations as easily as you would
   write math with paper and pencil! This feature uses the built-in 
   handwriting recognition in Windows 7.

* Point-and-Click Editing with Automatic Formatting: Create
   equations quickly by choosing templates from MathType's palettes and
   typing into their empty slots. MathType applies mathematical spacing 
   rules automatically as you type.

*  Keyboard Shortcuts: Save time using keyboard shortcuts. MathType 
    has customizable keyboard shortcuts for virtually every symbol, template, and command.

* Type TeX or LaTeX: If you already know the TeX typesetting
   language, you can enter equations directly into MathType or Microsoft
   Word documents. TeX editing can be mixed with point-and-click 
   editing so you get the best of both worlds. You can even paste in 
   equations from existing TeX documents.

* Copy-and-Paste: If you created your equation in another application
   or found one on a website, why take the time to create it by hand again? 
   Simply copy-and-paste it directly into MathType, and it is ready to edit 
   or use in your work.

* Save Expressions in the Toolbar: Drag frequently used equations 
   and expressions to the MathType toolbar so they can be inserted later 
   with just a click or a keystroke.

* Microsoft Office 2007 & 2010 â€” MathType Ribbon Tab in Word
   and PowerPoint: MathType takes full advantage of Office's Ribbon 
   User Interface making it easier than ever to do equation operations in 
   documents and presentations. New equation numbering and 
   browse features work with all Word equation types.

* Microsoft Office 2003 and XP (2002) â€” MathType Toolbar and
   Menu in Word and PowerPoint: MathType adds a toolbar and menu 
   to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, allowing quick access to its 
   features and powerful commands to do equation numbering, produce 
   great-looking math web pages, presentations, and much more.

* Find Symbols: MathType's Insert Symbol dialog allows you to
   xplore the available symbols and insert them with a click or keystroke.
Â 

More Control:

* Color: Use color to highlight part of an equation and focus your 
   audience's attention on just the portions you want. Show what changed 
   in each step of a multi-step procedure and make those equations really 
   come to life.

* More Fonts: MathType has hundreds more symbols and templates 
    than Equation Editor. Besides our exclusive Euclidâ„¢ math fonts, you
    can also make use of the 1000s of math symbols in fonts already on 
    your computer, as well as other math fonts you can download from the
    Internet.
