From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes to the show pharmacist and GCN talk radio host Ben Fuchs. Ben's Sunday show, The Bright Side with Pharmacist Ben, features nutritional and wellness information about exercise, diet and supplementation, prescription drugs, psychological transformational tools as well as the timeless wisdom of all the great religions and philosophies. 
[Note: this interview is in large part a commercial for products sold on Alex's new InfowarsTeam.com site.]


Alex also talks with regular Friday guest, Bob Chapman, publisher of the International Forecaster.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
