This book is essential to all of us life scientists. Most university courses around the world include Biochemistry in some way or another in their literature list.

This is (as of the moment of writing) the latest edition of Biochemistry, scanned in high quality. Sadly, the person who scanned it did not use a scanner with character recognition, so all pages are images, making the pdf so damn big. Sorry.
