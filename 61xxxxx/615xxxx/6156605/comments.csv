Secondly, check out these two sites for inspiration how you could get external funding, both for a decent living and for doing what you want to.

,dandmojo,2011-02-10T22:42Z,will gladly donate if you map secure procedure
,FrostyC,2011-02-11T03:43Z,"Wish I could help man. I'm pretty bad off myself. Foodstamps, No Job, living with my Mom, stealing wifi, living day to day. If I had some money I'd help you out man. Seriously. You have no idea how many times I've installed TinyXP on a PC.

C'mon guys I know you're not all broke, HELP THIS LEGEND OUT!"
,XP2014,2011-02-14T23:04Z,"I registered just to say thanks for all your work over the years. I've installed and defended a lot of your releases and it's hard to imagine someone as talented as you going through hard times. I wish I could customize an OS as perfectly as you do so easily. Setup a donation link and I'm sure some of us will chip in. There's no amount of $ that could compliment a well tuned system, M$ should take some hints from you because what you've done is literally priceless. I hope things turn up for you in time.  To the best pirate around, keep your head up."
,doom.ca,2011-02-16T03:15Z,"ditto on the secure donations, i have made money on your releases, and will gladly send you some caps."
,turkeypud,2011-02-17T03:16Z,"eXperience...

May happy and prosperous days fall upon you very soon..
with your skills, and benevolence you can only succeed in my eyes.

shout out to doom!!

,someguyfromhell,2011-02-24T00:22Z,"I wish you all the best. Life is like a roller coaster, there will be up and down times. I look forward to seeing new releases in the future. Thanks for all you have done :)"
,leezaal40,2011-02-27T15:16Z,can you update us with how things are eXPer1ence your still in our thoughts and we would like to help out
,ninjasource,2011-03-12T13:27Z,"yeah... sorry about your situation... im in quite a mess miself.

still - if u put up a reliable donation link ill gladly donate what i can.
(probably somewhere between 10-30 dollar until i get a better income... after that some more donations)"
,thelung,2011-03-14T15:18Z,ey mate!! please update us on how you are doing!!!  
,mobiani,2011-03-25T01:52Z,"happy to donate... setup something with a google checkout or paypal.

for your info there is someone by the name manvan1 who has uploaded a supposedly updated tiny7 and has claimed to be from the same team as yours with a donation link"
,napierdalator2,2011-04-02T13:57Z,"I noticed that ""Windows TinyXP Rev11 - September 2010"" torrent is no longer available on TPB. Was it also a hoax?

By the way, thank you for your work, MicroXP rules :)"
,vo_danh,2011-04-06T09:55Z,"Start a donation paypal link or something. I've used your tinyxp alot and loved it, I appreciate your work and would like to donate as well. Tough times for everybody no shame in taking some back for those of us who have saved alot using what you worked on. "
,jay are two,2011-05-06T06:49Z,"@Everyone wanting to help:

If eXPerience set up a donation site, wouldn't that be painting a big red X on himself with a note that says, ""I'm all yours, Billy""?  Seriously.  M$ would really make out on that idea, no?"
,jay are two,2011-05-09T20:58Z,@eXPerience: www.usajobs.gov search for computer related jobs and you might get something.  If you are in the US that is.
,klu9,2011-05-14T23:57Z,"1. Thank you for all your good work over the years.

2. Sorry to hear about your hard times. I've been there myself, and I'm sure you'll bounce back.

3. Thanks for warning about the hoaxes.

4. Exactly which releases were fakes? I've got TinyXP Rev11, which seems to work OK but which I can no longer find in your list of TPB releases (by clicking on your user name)."
,Naraku77,2011-05-21T11:10Z,"Thanks for the heads up.  Sorry to hear you've fallen on rough times.  Wish I could help but I'm only doing slightly better than FrostyC.  Your releases have not only been useful and time-saving (both for actual and virtual installs), but also very educational when it comes to the Windows modding process.  I'm still using them actually, because they're still easily some of the cleanest, most professionally done mods available.  Thanks many times over and I hope things start looking up for you.  Oh, that's right, the world's supposed to end in an hour according to some nutcase, so, it may not matter soon anyway (yeah, right, in the unlikely event a supreme being exists, he's probably far too sadistic to put humanity out of its misery)."
,shyamsundaronline,2011-07-03T16:21Z,I will help you eXPer1ence... tell me how?
,LightenLhar,2011-09-23T23:22Z,"I'm not rich, but if there's anything we can do for you, please let us know"
,thinlane,2011-10-19T00:55Z,"I would soooo love to help you, but, like you and so many of the others, it's a struggle to have a pot to piss in, too.  You are unbelievably loved by many of us, and I hope that somehow makes a difference to you!"
