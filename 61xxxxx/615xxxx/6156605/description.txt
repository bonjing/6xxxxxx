
 Two torrent releases were recently posted on The Pirate Bay under the
 coveted "eXPerience" brand name, under the exper1ence account.

 Both torrents were "Windows 7 activators" and not actually posted
 by team eXPerience.

 Normal service has resumed... nope, this isn't the words of the hacker
 but eXPerience himself.

 eXPerience crew would like to apologize for any inconvenience this may
 have caused. The offending torrents have now been removed.

 PS people asking about a new Tiny7... I used to live a lot more
 comfortably than I am right now and modding Windows used to be
 a lot more possible. These days I have not got a pot to piss in.
 Modding Windows is one thing but not knowing where your next meal
 is coming from is another.
