A conglomeration of several political activist documentaries together on one "movie" DVD. This is an attempt at packing the biggest "punch" in one DVD title. I call the DVD's, "Awake & Aware" after a similarly titled conference in LA September 2009. Enjoy and please spread around :)

P.S. a few mentionables in the DVD:

The Green Beautiful
Earthlings
Sharkwater
Whale Wars(Intro) - by Sea Shepherd
The Cove - trailers
The End of the Line - trailers
David Icke - On Animal Rights
...and a few others.
