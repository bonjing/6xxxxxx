,davelizewsk,2011-02-06T15:24Z,"yes it is working one hundred percent, under the neon lights embrace me"
,oversoul53,2011-02-06T15:29Z,"hey man, I appreciate u uploading this but... do you think you could upload it as an .avi file? please? I wanna watch it on my PS3, and I don't have any blank DVDs to burn it to"
,oversoul53,2011-02-06T15:32Z,"I don't mean to sound ungrateful, btw, sorry if I do. but I was gonna watch it on TV last night but my gf who's outta state called and wanted to skype, and u know yur loved ones come first. I figured ""that's ok, I can just download it later"" and u can imagine my disappointment when I cam on here and saw that there wasn't an .avi one.... :(

if not, can someone at least tell me if there's a way I can convert the dvd files into an .avi? thanks :) "
,FredFLQ,2011-02-06T16:39Z,"oversoul53 -> What are you using to stream your movies to your PS3? PS3MediaServer should be able to handle most file formats (I don't really know since it's still downloading on my side). If it doesn't, you can always HandBrake to transcode it to a supported format."
,mcdonaldtyler,2011-02-06T16:39Z,"thepiratebay in general is fucking slacking, there has not been a 720p upload for a month, and now only one upload for snl. I found another place for 720p 0 day releases, thanks for the fun while it lasted tpb"
,Daniccus,2011-02-06T17:35Z,"you people talking about dvd files and stuff, how its not avi and your ungreatful and want to know how to convert it or wish they uploader would convert it...what the hell

i look and see that it is scenebalance so i am thinking to myself what the hell could these people be talking about, i click download and just laugh...

you people have the sense to download torrents but you dont know what RAR files are, have you never UNZIPPED anything in your life, thats basic computer knowledge, download an unzip program, learn how to unzip, the art of maybe 3 clicks max, your avi file will be awaiting you inside"
,iamrifter,2011-02-06T20:06Z,Yeah except for one time the rar haters are right.  What was the point of raring a file when there was no space savings from compression?  The size of the rar is just as big as the original! :P This means that it takes up twice as much space.  Yeah so if you don't like it don't download it.  Thanks for uploading anyway.
