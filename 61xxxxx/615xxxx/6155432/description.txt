Bad record deals have plagued Motorhead's career, resulting in countless low-quality live recordings and pointless re-packagings, but 1994's Live at Brixton is one of the rare exceptions. Recorded during the band's 1987 tour, this set was originally chosen for release as their second official live album, No Sleep at All, but at the last minute, another, noticeably inferior concert recording was used. Combining classics from the band's early days ("Stay Clean," "Ace of Spades," "Metropolis") with more recent cuts ("Doctor Rock," "Orgasmatron," "Deaf Forever"), the album's only major downfall is the inclusion of too many mediocre tunes ("Dogs," "Traitor," "Stone Deaf in the USA") from the disappointing Rock'n'Roll album. Brand new track "Just 'Cos You got the Power" is one of the album's highlights; at over eight minutes, it shows a rarely seen, bluesier side of Motorhead. So if you haven't bought No Sleep at All yet, don't! Get this one instead. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia
