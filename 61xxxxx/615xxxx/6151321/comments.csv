According to the name of the N360-v5.0_Patch-v2.0, apparently ""Shady and 
Protection (S&P)"" are divorced. Probably that's because so far most of their 
cracks released in their young career failed. So maybe it's better this way ...

LOLX
+1 for that "

,TheDoc99,2011-02-14T19:46Z,"Thanx for the upload RobbingHood.

I am running into a problem I have used Norton 360's previous version with trial resets for a while now so I'm not with out experience but when I run this crack it doesn't do anything.  The help file says that after running the crack a window with an ok button appears and goes away and then Norton shuts down itself and restarts, this never happens for me!  I've tried and tried but after running the crack nothing happens!  any ideas?"

In case the trial reset is not removed then uninstall it first (as mentioned in the install notes)."

The torrent worked for 1 day, now my  180 days are returned to 0 days! How can I change this again?

What I have already tried:
- I have delete norton with Norton Remove Tool. And I have installed it again, but my days are still 0!

What to do? Thanks."

Try one of the trial resetters, and read the install notes.

,Gizmo20783,2011-03-12T07:34Z,Well I was just about to come on here and give a positive compliment because after I booted in safe mode and used the patch it said it was sucessful. But I can't say that because after restarting I have 0 days. Now I have to do it all over again for 30 days.
,Blackvosh,2011-05-08T02:43Z,"I having problems with the install.  At the very end of the install it said ""Installation Failed"" & explained that N360 detected some kind of error which prevents it from installing.  I unplugged my internet.  Nothing.  I've tried the Norton Power Eraser-it didn't detect anything.  I've tried the Norton Removal Tool program.  Same problem.  Ran the NTR to purge any old Norton programs.  And I get the same installation failed problem.  Do you have any suggestions besides doing a fresh install of Windows 7(86x)?  Which is a last resort.  I was able to installed NIS 2011 v18.5.0.125 with the NTR 3.3.1 & I got the 120 day subscription!"
,iScruuuuge,2011-05-26T00:18Z,"**Problem** Hey Robbing Hood, first id like to thank you for this great upload and like all your others it works perfectly, my problem is that when I installed Norton I had forgotten to use the crack and i let the trial get used up... now usually I just uninstall Norton then reinstall it so I can access the setting to turn off the tamper protection. but when I uninstalled and reinstalled it still claims that the product is used up... ! I booted in safe mode and uninstalled and reinstalled but still it is telling me I need to buy the product! Can you please give me a solution to this as I have looked for hours now but cant seem to find anything... :( 
Hope you get back to me soon, 
      Thanks,
            Me! "
