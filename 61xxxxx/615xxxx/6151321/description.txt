WARNING !!!
***********
Reported by many users is that the previous released crack for Norton 360 v5.x
- N360-v5.0_Crack-v1.0 [180 days] by Shady and Protection (S&P) - expires within 
a few hours/days, and that their Norton 360 got locked.

So use both the crack (by S&P) and this updated patch for N360 v5.x at own risk!

* Reported however is that this updated N360-v5.0_Patch-v2.0 works fine!

BTW:
****
According to the name of the N360-v5.0_Patch-v2.0, apparently "Shady and 
Protection (S&P)" are divorced. Probably that's because so far most of their 
cracks released in their young career failed. So maybe it's better this way ...



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



This version of N360 is NOT the previous Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Beta version !!! 
*******************************************************************************
To check which version this is: 
1. Right-click on the installer of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125, and select [Properties].
2. At the Properties window click on the [Version] tab.
3. In the list of the Item name window click on [Original file name].
4. Check the name at the window next to the Item name window.

Symantec labelled the Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 installers as follow:
1. Original filename of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Standard Beta = N360-Beta.exe
2. Original filename of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Standard = N360.exe
3. Original filename of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 Premier = N360-Premier.exe

Symantec officially did NOT label this version as Beta, based on the facts that:
the name Beta is NOT used in both the name of this installer and at the installer 
its file properties, and also the name Beta is not used in the Symantec download 
links.


The Product Date info at file properties of both the installer of the 
Beta and this version of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 shows as date: 12/02/2010

The digitally signed timestamps of both the installer of the Beta and this
version of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125 show as date: saturday 4 december 2010.
 
However, the N360 v5.0.0.125 Beta was released early december 2010, 
while this version of N360 v5.0.0.125 was released early february 2011.

Also the names of the Symantec download links from this release contain 
the letter combination OEM or ESD (e.g. 60-30 days trial version) to 
indicate that it's not the Beta version. 

This release also comes from an official Symantec download link, 
but for some reason apparently this v5.0.0.125 still is not 
available as download at Symantec itself.


* Conclusion, according the names of this installer and at the installer 
its file properties, and also because of the names of the download links: 
this version is officially NOT labelled by Symantec as Beta. 

The name of this torrent will be corrected by the time Symantec 
officially labels this v5.0.0.125 also a Beta (Public Beta). 

In the meanwhile the name Final is used because so far this version 
is released as Final everywhere else except at Symantec itself.
 
For now this version is also labelled as Final to indicate that 
this version is NOT the previous v5.0.0.125 beta.

Soon the whole discussion on the web about this version will be over. 
For now it's up to you to argue about this version and to decide whether 
this is the Final or Beta version, or whatever version you think it is. 


For complaints or a refund about the current and known "Beta or Final" issue:
*****************************************************************************
Please just STFU, and go bother the Symantec Customer Service. :P

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. Avira AntiVir Premium 
3. avast! Pro Antivirus
4. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
