This is a feature length political documentary which depicts the notorious tax rebel Tim Eyman and his battles with government in Washington State. Through the use of revealing interviews and behind the scenes footage, the 'minutia of politics' is presented in most unusual way. Throughout the film, we see Tim cut taxes, allow more accountability in government and give more direct democracy back to citizens. Taxation without representation, over priced political programs and other issues (such as Boeing leaving the state) are revealed as causes for tax rebels such as Tim Eyman.
