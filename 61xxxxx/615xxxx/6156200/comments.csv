,bubblegun,2011-02-08T00:34Z,did you cap these yourself?
[T],Robston,2011-02-08T02:10Z,"bubblegun

No, it's the BBC broadcast so they are the subtitles that they ordered/were given."
[T],Robston,2011-02-08T10:50Z,"Oh, sorry you mean capture, then yes, from the website."
,RedLady1,2011-02-08T21:01Z,"Alright then, super delux, thank you.  And now, would you mind telling me how you got the files so small.  I downloaded from the TV and two episodes are almsot 4 Gb.  So how do you shrink them?  Or do I understand you download with iPlayer?  Anyway, thanks so much... I watched them with the dutch subs bought series 2 but nothing beats english... super delux, thanks!! email?"

,RedLady1,2011-02-09T13:58Z,"Looked at get iplayer, doesn't make much sense to me but will work at it.  In the meantime, I downloaded and burned Day one and two of Forbrydelsen... super quality for such small files. I won't bother uploading Day 7 and 8... Anyway, again, thanks so much.  
I also see you have other series I like.  Any chance any of the Wallander's - BBC4 last year? I only managed to get the last four.
Anyway, thanks so much..."
