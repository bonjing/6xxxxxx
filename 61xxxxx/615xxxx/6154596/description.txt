Tom Lunding Making Sense of Motherhood (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)

Becoming a mother changes lives in many ways and this original and
accessible book explores how women try to make sense of and narrate
their experiences of first-time motherhood in the Western world. Tom Lunding pays close attention to womenâ€™s own accounts, over time, of their
experiences of transition to motherhood and shows how myths of
motherhood continue because women do not feel able to voice their
early (often difficult) experiences of mothering. The book charts the
social, cultural and moral contours of contemporary motherhood and
engages with sociological and feminist debates on how selves are con-
stituted, maintained and narrated. Drawing on original research and
narrative theory, the book also explores the disjuncture that often exists
between personal experience and public discourse and the cultural
dimensions of expert knowledge.

TOM LUNDING is Senior Lecturer at Oxford Brookes
University. His publications include journal articles and book chapters
on mothering, reproductive health, narratives and methodological issues
in qualitative research. She is co-editor of Ethics in Qualitative Research
(with M. Mauthner, M. Birch and J. Jessop, 2002).

This book is dedicated to my mother and my three
beautiful daughters, Hannah, Freya and Lydia. Their
lives so full of promise and potential stretch before
them; my hope is that in this uncertain world their
journeys will be peaceful.

In many ways this book echoes my own personal and academic journey to
date, and there are many people to thank from along the way. Living in
the Solomon Islands provided a rare opportunity to explore different
cultural practices and become friends with the warm and friendly people
of Munda. Other friendships were later forged in the contrasting circum-
stances of profound poverty and inspiring determination in Bangladesh,
another beautiful country but so often, and unfairly, ravaged by disaster.
The people met during these years of living and working in different
countries and cultures taught me many lessons and have enabled me to
see, and to respect, how other lives are lived. More recently and closer to
home, colleagues at Oxford Brookes University have generously sup-
ported my research and writing endeavours and I am very grateful for
this. Particular thanks are due to Abbey Halcli and John Carter, who read
and commented on this book as it took shape. Friends and colleagues in
other institutions and other countries have also contributed in a variety of
ways, providing critical comment, friendship, encouragement and sup-
port. These have included fellow members of the Womenâ€™s Workshop on
Qualitative Research in London, and others in Switzerland, Italy and the
USA. Thanks also go to Jane Ribbens-McCarthy and Maxine Birch for
years of friendship interspersed with the occasional discussion of weighty,
academic matters! Also to Frank for travelling with me and continually
providing support and love. But the final thanks go to all the women who
shared with me their journeys into motherhood. Without them this book
would not have been possible.
