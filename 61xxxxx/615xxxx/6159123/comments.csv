,SanfordBraun,2011-02-09T08:32Z,"I am trying to seed this but when I click on ""Edit torrent"" I get a message saying ""EDIT - Temporarily disabled !"".  Any thoughts?"
,Hackboy,2011-02-10T15:28Z,"You shouldn't have to edit squat......just load it back up into your torrent client and make sure you have it set for seeding. If you haven't made any changes to the original files or their location, there should be no problem. Hope you get it resolved soon....been sitting at 97.5% for 2 days waiting for this to finish seeding."
