----------------------------------
Plot:
===================
  Ash, Pikachu, and company stop by in a house where they intend to watch a match of t
he PokÃ©mon Baccer World Cup between the evolutionary line of Elekid and Beldum.
 Brock explains about what the PokÃ©mon Baccer World Cup is, and an image of a mysterious man 
shows up after the match in the TV and exhibits its team formed by a Raikou, Entei, and Suicune,
 that quickly drags the spinning-top shaped object in the floating pyramid, making the gang want 
to see them live. Recognizing them as legendary PokÃ©mon, Team Rocket starts getting excited that 
they should capture them. A Nurse Joy then shows up, saying that she is also very excited for the
 match. Ash then proposes to reach Crown City before the day's end, where the next PokÃ©mon Baccer
 World Cup will be held.

Meanwhile, a Zoroark rests in a large carrier plane, and Zorua fumbles out of Zoroark's hair,
 who seems to be the child of Zoroark. Suddenly, an automatic door opens, where Zoroark and her 
son find themselves face-to-face with Raikou, Entei and Suicune. Behind them, the business man 
Grings Kodai and his assistant, Rowena, stay in a chamber. Rowena tells Kodai that the final 
adjustments are ready. Kodai then tests Zoroark's use of illusions by commanding the illusions 
of the legendary PokÃ©mon to attack Zoroark. Zorua tries to attack Raikou, but Zoroark stops him 
and puts him into her hair for safety. Kodai asks Zoroark if she cherishes her son that much, but 
Zoroark quickly transforms into Raikou. Zoroark fills the area with thunderclouds that ascends 
to Kodai and Rowena. At the same time, Kodai activates an illusion in his bracelet. 
The thunderclouds penetrate them, but Kodai reveals that he and Rowena are illusions, 
and that the cameras were also fooled by the illusions.
