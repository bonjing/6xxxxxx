PLAYBOY REAL COUPLES: SEX IN DANGEROUS PLACES


Plot

Attractive, real-life couples handpicked by Playboy share and indulge their wildest fantasies about having sex in risky places. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for these couples to find an unusual place and time to be entirely intimate with each other, and to share it with an audience unlikely to share such an opportunity. In the new tradition of "reality-based" television, Playboy manages to once again break new ground.
