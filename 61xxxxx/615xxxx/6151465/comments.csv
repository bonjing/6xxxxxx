i've posted on TPB help forum and am waiting an answer.
i get a 'hash missing from reply' in vuze and searching google i'm not finding any helpful answers."
,CharlieTann,2011-02-05T19:54Z,"OK, give it a try.
It's working for me."
,CharlieTann,2011-02-05T20:05Z,"UNFUCKINBELIEVABLE!!
It was working for about 3 minutes then back to the hash error.
AAARRRGGG I GIVE UP.
Last solution...upload each episode individually.
I didn't want to have to do 90+ torrents for each year...:(
I'll look into a solution for this problem over the weekend and if I can't fix it then look for each episode next week."
