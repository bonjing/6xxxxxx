Browser-based interfaces are slow, clumsy, and require you to be connected to the internet just to use them. Browsers are perfect for reading web content, but not so great for creating it. If you're serious about your blog, you need a desktop blog editor. If you're lucky enough to have a Mac, nothing is more powerful or more elegant than MarsEdit.

Feature Overview

Rich And HTML Text Editing

* Whether you love HTML or can't bear the sight of it, MarsEdit's editor will
 thrill you. If you prefer the best of both worlds, you can switch easily between 
 the two.


Wildly Compatible

*  Works with WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Squarespace, TypePad, Movable Type and 
   dozens more through standard MetaWeblog and AtomPub interfaces.

Perfect Previews

* Build a template to match your blog, then let MarsEdit's live preview show you
  how your posts will look before you publish them. Use Markdown? MarsEdit  
  will preview that, too.

Your Editor Or Ours

* Combine the power of MarsEdit with your favorite editor. Integrates cleanly with
  BBEdit, SubEthaEdit, TextMate, TextWrangler, and any editor that supports 
  that ODBEditor suite.

Media At Your Fingertips

* Quickly scan your iPhoto, Aperture, Lightroom, or Flickr libraries, and insert
  images into your blog post with the click of a button.

Easy File Uploads

* Upload images and files directly to your blog, or attach them to a post for
  automatic upload-on-publish. MarsEdit will even resize them to suit your needs.
 
Re-Blog It!

* Add our "Blog This" bookmarklet to your browser's button bar. Now when you
  discover something cool, you can start a new MarsEdit post with the click of a
  button.

Offline Freedom

* Write when you want to, without an internet connection. Fine-tune your
  masterpiece on the boat, plane, or train, and publish when you get back online.
