The last nine episodes of Season 2 began airing on June 4, 2010 in the United States (CBS) and were shown in a different order from their original broadcast on CTV. CBS, however, is erroneously referring to these episodes as ""Season 3"". A 13-episode third season was produced in Toronto from January to May, 2010 and began airing in July 2010 on both CTV and CBS.
On May 9, 2011, CTV announced a fourth season of Flashpoint to begin on June 17, 2011; the new season is to be simulcast by CBS"
