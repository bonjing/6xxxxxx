                                 The Complete Season 3


Flashpoint is about an elite tactical unit, called the Strategic Response Unit (SRU), within a Canadian metropolitan police force (styled on the Toronto Police Emergency Task Force). The SRU are tasked to resolve extreme situations that regular officers are not trained to handle including hostage-taking, bomb threats and heavily armed criminals. Equipped with high-tech tools and a cache of weapons and explosives, members use negotiation tactics and intuition to try to avoid the use of force.


Epiosde order

The order of episodes seems to be a kind of confusing matter â€“ so I post the link to the current episode order listed by CTV on their site at present.

CTV's List of Episodes:

Season 4

It looks like there is going to be a fourth season. 18 episodes had been  ordered just before season three started airing and are already in production. They will air on CTV in Canada in their regular midseason timeslot.
In the US, CBS will show the missing episodes of season 3 and the first seven episodes of season 4 in summer 2011. Soon after that ION is going to start airing all 51 episodes aired so far on CBS and finally premiere the remaining 11 episodes of Flashpoint's fourth season.
