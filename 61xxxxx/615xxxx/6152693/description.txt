"We Are The World 25 For Haiti"

[Justin Bieber]
There comes a time
When we heed a certain call
[Nicole Scherzinger & Jennifer Hudson & Justin Bieber]
When the world must come together as one
[Jennifer Hudson]
There are people dying
[Jennifer Nettles]
And itâ€™s time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
[Josh Groban]
We canâ€™t go on
Pretending day by day
[Tony Bennet]
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
[Mary J Blige]
We are all a part of
Godâ€™s great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need

[Chorus]
[Michael Jackson]
We are the world
We are the children
[Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson]
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So letâ€™s start giving
[Barbra Streisand]
Thereâ€™s a choice weâ€™re making
Weâ€™re saving our own lives
Itâ€™s true weâ€™ll make a better day
Just you and me

[Miley Cyrus]
Send them your heart
So theyâ€™ll know that someone cares
[Enrique Iglesias]
So their cries for help
Will not be in vain
[Nicole Scherzinger]
We canâ€™t let them suffer
No we cannot turn away
[Jamie Foxx]
Right now they need a helping hand
[Wyclef Jean]
Nou se mond la
We are the Children
[Adam Levine]
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
[Pink]
Thereâ€™s a choice weâ€™re making
Weâ€™re saving our own lives
[BeBe Winans]
Itâ€™s true weâ€™ll make a better day
Just you and me

[Michael Jackson]
When youâ€™re down and out
There seems no hope at all
[Usher]
But if you just believe
Thereâ€™s no way we can fall
[Celine Dion]
Well, well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come
[Fergie]
When we stand together as one

[Chorus - All]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So letâ€™s start giving
[Nick Jonas]
Got to start giving
[All]
Thereâ€™s a choice weâ€™re making
Weâ€™re saving our own lives
[Toni Braxton]
Itâ€™s true weâ€™ll make a better day
Just you and me
[Mary Mary]
We are the world
We are the children
[Tony Bennet]
Its for the children
[Isaac Slade]
We are the ones who make a brighter day
[Toni Braxton]
So lets start giving

[Lil Wayne]
Thereâ€™s a choice weâ€™re making
Weâ€™re saving our own lives
Itâ€™s true weâ€™ll make a better day
Just you and me

[Chorus - All]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day

[T-Pain]

We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So letâ€™s start giving
[Jamie Foxx imitating Ray Charles]
Choice were making
Saving our own lives
Itâ€™s true weâ€™ll make a better day
Just you and me

[Rapping - LL Cool J, Will-I-Am, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz]
We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
When the earth quakes weâ€™ll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the World united by love so strong
When the radio isnâ€™t on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubbleâ€™s gone
We are the World connected by a common bond

Love the whole planet sing it along

[Chorus - All]

[Kanye West]
Everyday citizens
Everybody pitching in

[Singing - Children & Wyclef Jean]
Nou se mond la
Nou se timoun yo

[Will-I-Am]
You and I
You and I
[Kanye West]
Uh, 12 days no water
Whats your will to live?
[Will-I-Am]
We amplified the love we watching multiply
[Kanye West]
Feeling like the Worlds end
We can make the World win
[Will-I-Am]
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
And now Haiti needs us, the need us, they need us

[Chorus - All]
[Wyclef Jean]
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
