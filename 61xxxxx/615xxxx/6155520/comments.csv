,trippay,2011-03-01T12:51Z,"morons it's not a fucking virus you can't embed a virus in an avi file.  IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

that said, yes, this is the same shitty copy that's been floating around, and it's most definitely not a screener."
,DreaD151,2011-03-03T14:05Z,"Yea trip I hate when i make movies that the dvd is bad or got heat damage and people put it in their computer since their 1999 dvd player is so old it wont even attempt to read it and they say "" Pop ups and adds started coming up it had a virus on it!"" Fuckin idiots this version of The rite is about as interesting as a wet carrot! Someone get The Roommate I got a lousy copy of it too pb doesnt have one yet....."

,Protektor35,2011-03-05T08:17Z,"Actually a .avi can have a virus in it and there have been several proof of concept versions put out by security researchers. They only target Window media player and do a buffer exploit to get Media Player to execute the data that is actually code, but other players see it as junk and don't play it. The other most common one flagged as a virus is when the .avi auto opens a URL without the users consent.  If there are bugs in your browser it is possible that simply loading a web page can get you infected, but that isn't all that common.

,lordtarl,2011-03-23T22:54Z,"@ trippay
I beg to differ. In fact its not even hard to do. And its done quite often because asshats like you think it can't be done and are xompletely safe D-Loading that cool man on goat porn avi..
You are not safe.
In cyber space.. no one can hear you scream.. but we can see you thump your monitor in frustration when Norton says ""What the hell was that?!"" and you system fries like retards finger at McDonalds..
But really.. kidding aside.. yeah it can be done rather easily by anyone with a modicum of computer programming knowledge. "
,dlarrym1111,2011-03-28T06:18Z,"@trippay: Not sure where you get your information from, but a virus or an array of other nasty programs that you DON""T want wandering around your computer, (mainly the ones that goto your hard drive and begin to over write your info. . . major bummer). SO, a Virus, worm, and other hated crap can be put into a .avi container. Seriously, it isn't truly a ""FILE"" like a .txt file or a .exec file. It is a container just like a .mkv is. Think about it, haven't you seen a .h264 video in a .avi container and a XVID video also in a .avi format. IT IS A CONTAINER. . . trippay, you need to get your facts straight. It's not cool to tell people stuff like you are spewing out as if it was the absolute truth. This will no doubt cause someone that is less informed then you to skip checking there .avi formated movies for virus and bugs and the like based on your crap you are tossing out on these comment areas."
