Traffic X is the latest generation of the hugely popular Traffic series of AI traffic programs from Just Flight, and is the new benchmark for Artificial Intelligence traffic expansions.

It includes custom features designed to take maximum advantage of the new capabilities available in Flight Simulator X and employs completely reworked and updated aircraft for FSX with new and more detailed high-quality airline liveries. Traffic X includes 84 individual, different aircraft models with numerous airline liveries and paint schemes â€“ giving a total of more than 1,600 individual aircraft! Featured aircraft include commercial airliners, regional jets and turboprops, business aircraft, GA aircraft, helicopters and - for the first time in the Traffic series - military aircraft.

There are, of course, a host of other new features - the new Traffic Control Centre gives you an easy way to comprehensively customise and expand your AI traffic; ChronoTraffic means every aircraft and flight can now be set for a certain period of years; the all-new Follow-me car and Pushback truck let you explore the airport from the ground; all-new Traffic Radar lets you view traffic information in three different modes about each AI aircraft in range; appropriate aircraft take advantage of the advanced animations in FSX to operate with airport service vehicles, and Spotty the aircraft Spotter has got an even more impressive bag of tricks!
