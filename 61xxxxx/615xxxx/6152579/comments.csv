,dreadgod,2011-02-10T01:02Z,the keygen seems to only work for the base game what about the expansions?
,Lord_Nerd,2011-02-10T17:58Z,"downloaded twice, rar file corrupt."
,Kaosunoburinga,2011-02-11T21:44Z,"So long as you enter the key after you install fleet command and run it to enter the key, then install all the expansions in the directory it shouldn't ask you again. It only asked me for it once."
,dreadgod,2011-02-12T05:55Z,maybe because i used arcen games installers are your installers modified?

Sorry for the wait."
,asdf55,2011-02-12T19:34Z,"Okay, I downloaded and installed. Even after installing the expansions to the game directory, they don't show up. I only get to play the basic game. Am I doing something wrong? "
,Kaosunoburinga,2011-02-13T22:50Z,"No they don't show, but the content will be in the game when you luanch fleet command. No worries it confused me at first too."
,Kaosunoburinga,2011-02-13T23:13Z,So long as there are all 4 uninstallers in the directory your good
,Eudajmonion,2011-02-14T19:01Z,"I have install fleet command and run it to enter the key, then install all the expansions in the directory...
and theres no sind of them in game, version is still 3.0.0.0,  no expansions in its menu neither in settings/expansions

How do you apply them ??"
,qmanjr5,2011-02-15T09:17Z,"Yeah, dude, what the heck. I installed all 3 expansions, to the game directoy, but they don't show up in the list of expansions, nor does their content show up in game. :\
Help?"
,Kaosunoburinga,2011-02-15T23:30Z,"Okay, Look ready carefully.

Let the installer install the location, the expansions should be installed in another folder

Program files/Acren Games, LLC/ for Ai War fleet command.

Program files/Ai War/ expansions

1. To activate the content once you have it installed go to the settings and click the Expansions tab

2. Double click the expansion names and enter the keys provided for the corresponding expansion.

3. Have fun"

,norhuma,2011-04-07T18:54Z,"Hey Kaosunoburinga

Alright, first things first: thanks for the upload! I have two problems with it though:"
,norhuma,2011-04-07T18:55Z,"(1) according to several scanners, the keygen contains a generic trojan, see bit(put a dot here)ly(slash here)guKrNS (link to VirusTotal statistics page for the file). The detection ratio is pretty high for a false positive.




"
,norhuma,2011-04-07T18:56Z,"(2) I have the same installation problem as some of the other posters (and, yes, I read your ""Look ready carefully."" post). Here's what I do, step by step: I install fleet command with the corresponding .exe; then (before even running the game once) I install all the other expansions, in a different folder. Then I run the game, I'm asked for a serial, I enter one of those mentioned below, and the game runs. But when I go to 'settings' --> 'expansions', none of them appears; it just says 'expansion not installed'. I have no idea what went wrong..."
,RedMune,2011-05-05T04:51Z,"Keygen is full of viruses.

,Plutonian101,2011-05-20T05:16Z,"Downloaded this and the other one this guy uploaded (the AI war v5.000) uploaded, and immediately afterwards a little java thing popped up.  Closed it out, played for a short while.  Closed down the game..  and it was off to the races dealing with the trojans.  Don't download."
,Kaosunoburinga,2011-05-25T22:25Z,"You should really know more about computers before you go believing everything a program tells you. Scanners search for files that are easily corruptable or ones that a commonly corrupted. For example a .bas file, which is a type of video file, is blocked on from most computers.
Still more i have no idea how someone could have a profile on TPB and not know that scanners will always say keygens are viruses. 
ABOVE THAT!
I have a .txt file that have serials in it and have posted some, so if your a CHILD then dont download the keygen which was made by Theta"
,Plutonian101,2011-05-28T08:35Z,"Didn't use the keygen.  Used serials posted up here.  I'm also well aware of the difficulties in keygens, which is why I avoid them.

I'll add, in your favor, that the game worked fine and well.  I had no issues with it, and the game itself is legit."
,DarthGamer6,2011-06-09T01:17Z,"A comment on the gameplay!
Riot Control W/ Shield + Parasites = Recruiting Team :)  If the AI were a person, this would annoy the **** out of them.  But, since they aren't, AI Progress levels remain the same. :)"
,De_loused,2011-07-02T06:08Z,"No wonder why Anti-viruses are blocking the keygen... BECAUSE A KEYGEN IS A FUCKING VIRUS... you dumbasses.

Thanks very much Kaos! I played it untill my eyes bled."
,De_loused,2011-07-02T06:09Z,I'll add... Stop trying to blame the games you are stealing for your hacks... ITS COMING FROM THE CHEAP PORN YOU WATCH!
,doomdemon,2011-07-03T02:26Z,"@haosunaoburinga
i just wanted to say that keygens wont always come up as viruses, in fact i am using Nortan 360 premier and it rarely did it, but the recent update for it is making it think most keygens are heuristic virus (google it if you want to know about it) and then deletes them which doesn't make sense (if you THINK someone is going to shoot you and you have no idea if he has a gun or not he just looks ""suspicious"" and you shoot him...well that usually doesn't end well for you) though it is manly happens with cracks

@de_loused
keygens are not viruses they are key generators just because an anti-virus says they are doesn't mean they are unsafe it just means it has a similar programming like viruses"
,doomdemon,2011-07-03T06:40Z,"i am having the same problem as norhuma, i installed the expansion in C:/Program Files/AIWar/ expansions notices it and changed it to C:/Program Files/Ai War/ expansions and that didn't work so i got rid of the space before expansions and again it didn't work tough i updated to v5.0 so mabey that screwed it up"
,rabid_parrots,2011-10-11T09:43Z,"works perfectly!
install the expansions AFTER  installing the updated game (AI war Fleet command version 5.000)

then after starting, it will ask for keys, give it, and play.

no viruses/trojans/whatever detected."
