Long Pants (1927) Silent with English Intertitles, Tinted B & W

Director: Frank Capra

The era of slapstick comedy produced a legacy of imaginative and inventive films, though none, however, are quite as peculiar as Long Pants, Frank Capra and Harry Langdon's fable of a growing boy's clumsy entry into adulthood. An awkward manchild of stunted maturity unlike any character since -- with the possible exception of Pee-Wee Herman -- Langdon's protagonists repeatedly dramatize the hilarious collision of boyhood innocence with the accelerated pace and perilous temptations of the Modern Age.

When a sheepish young man yearning for romance is given his first pair of grown-up trousers, he springs into adulthood and is immediately smitten by the wrong woman, a hard-boiled drug-smuggler (Alma Bennett). When the "snow" queen is jailed, Harry abandons his more sincere small-town sweetheart -- after a feeble attempt to murder her -- and comes to the brazen woman's rescue. Thus ensues one of filmdom's most side-splitting flights from justice, as Harry ushers his fugitive moll (who is nailed inside an enormous wooden crate) through a series of riotous scrapes with the police, an alligator, and a bevy of pitfalls thrown in the path of the idealist by the fast-paced modern world.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
