Faster Redeems a Misguided Career, 28 November 2010 9/10
Author: Gorefather from United States

While I always thought Dwayne Johnson (The Rock!) had potential as an actor, I thought his career choices have been pretty dismal since he left the world of wrestling. Whether throwaway crap like ""The Scorpion King"" or just plain embarrassing stuff like ""The Tooth Fairy"" (we get it Dwayne, you can laugh at yourself - how about getting down to business!), I just never felt compelled to see one of his movies. Until now.

I could tell from the trailer this one was going to be different....

 perhaps a better movie from Dwayne~ thank u for the share 20-40

,gaaraisgod,2011-02-15T16:15Z,"Thanks for the upload 20-40.

btw, Could anyone please post the specs? I'm not one to question 20-40's uploads but BlackJesus's encode is also 480p but @ 700MB (x264, 720x304, 1001kbps, 2ch@88kbps)

I'm wondering what he used the extra 200MB for O_o;"
,gaaraisgod,2011-02-15T16:35Z,Never mind. I'm getting this anyway now lol. I'm too impatient xD;
