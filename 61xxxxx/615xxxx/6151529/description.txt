The original Sisters Of Mercy, Live in Milan 1985.  192 kbps mp3 format. For a bootleg, genuinely excellent sound quality.  Walk Away and Rock and a Hard place are brilliant versions.  It's just a pity that Gary Marx had already left at this point so some of the songs miss the extra guitar.  Wayne does his best....
