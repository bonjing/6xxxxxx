,indiaman,2011-02-05T17:20Z,Thank you Oceanhawk for yet another great upload from you.This is probably one of the best books I've read explaining the complex phenomenon of relativity in such simplistic language and with excellent illustrations.Thanks once again.Please keep uploading such books which explain difficult subjects in such simple language.
