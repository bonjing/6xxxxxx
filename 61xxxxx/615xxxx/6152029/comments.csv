[V],big_dad_e,2011-02-10T00:30Z,ou're obviously a troll and continue to return only to flame my torrents. I've deleted more torrents than you have uploaded and have uploaded more this month than you have since you have been on TPB. If you've been ripping DVD's for 11 years where are they? So you're saying you're a scene uploader now? Ha. STFU & GTFO. 
[V],big_dad_e,2011-02-10T00:34Z,Congratulations for figuring out how to add an image to your torrents.  Now figure out how to upload something watchable you troll.
[M],BigDadE,2011-02-10T02:14Z,"Keep flaming torrents and I'll suggest to a Moderator you be banned from TPB.

Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!

In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments."

I commented on 1 of your torrents, since then you have been abusing me and now you're flaming and negatively rating all my torrents, I have been reasonable in my comments on your torrent, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6156448/Guns_N__Roses-Wel_The_Videos%5BDVDRip%5D%5Bbig_dad_e%5D

The problem is that you have been unable to deal with some constructive criticism. A common problem on TPB unfortunately."

[V],big_dad_e,2011-02-10T23:13Z,"Quality is quite poor, alot of macroblocking in the videos with high motion scenes. Should have individually encoded each video and reduced the bitrate on the audio, 320Kbps audio is overkill. The version of Xvid used for encoding is outdated. Very disappointing considering the file size.

I wish I had more positive comments but I don't, try again do better. "

Buddy, I wouldn't seed your rips even if they were the last available through TPB.

In fact, I want a bandwith refund from you for this particular shit rip that I downloaded and subsequently deleted.

I have been ripping DVD's for 11 years into all manner of formats and I recommend you take alook at what FXG_team are doing with the XviD codec, they know how to do XviD rips to a high standard, you do not buddy.

[V],big_dad_e,2011-02-10T23:18Z,"Since you're a self appointed expert on all things related to torrenting WTF is bandwith?  For the last time STFU & GTFO you flaming troll.  OK, I get it, you don't like my torrent, so stop returning to comment.  Go buy it.  Are you a dick with ears or an asshole with teeth?  Trick question you're both!"
