Benidorm is a prime-time ITV sitcom set in Spain, which features a strong ensemble cast composed of a number of well known faces. Set primarily in the Solana all-inclusive resort hotel, Benidorm follows regulars and first-time holiday makers on their holidays abroad. Despite their disparate backgrounds they all have one thing in common - a quest for getting value for money!
 The first series of Benidorm proved to be a fairly modest hit for ITV - with critics saying things like: "beautifully written and performed" and "a gem of wry observation in withering bad taste". Series Two, which was broadcast in April and May 2008, saw all the main characters return to the Solana Resort for eight new episodes.
 Benidorm returned again in 2009 for a summer special which picked up where the second series left off (with several characters in prison, hospital and disappearing out to sea).The third series, which started in October 2009, was set one year after the summer special as the holidaymakers took up the offer of a free holiday given to them by the Solana Resort. The Garveys are among those to return and soon find themselves right in the middle of the action, courtesy of Madge and Mel (who have setup a shop in Benidorm). The new series continued the trend in having popular guest stars playing outlandish characters. Robin Askwith, Keith Barron, Una Stubbs and Tim Healy all make appearances during Series 3.=
