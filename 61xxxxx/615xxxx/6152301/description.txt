Missing Persons - Windows [Bananas tv show 1983].mp4


HQ Bananas tv show promo music video from an outstanding and very rare 1980's tv show from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's.

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos. 

"Windows" is a song from Spring Session M, the debut album by American new wave band Missing Persons, released in 1982. The title of the album is an anagram of the band's name. Tracks from this album: "Words", "Windows", "Destination Unknown", and "Walking in LA" all had videos created and all received heavy play on MTV and AOR and modern rock radio. 

The singles "Words", "Mental Hopscotch", "Destination Unknown", "Walking in L.A." and "Windows" met with varying success, especially in the local markets of Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The group toured and its shows were well attended.
