System Requirements:

Mac OS X.5.3 and later

If you have a problem with initializing DG in incompatibility with application enhancer, just up the app in the "Exclude Master List" of AE, then relauch it.  You will still get the message, but it allows you "ignore" - This worked in OS X.6.7 for me!
