Video sources - IFLIX PPV - Lu CAM - Thanks
Audio sources - IFLIX PPV - Lu CAM - Thanks


First of all the PPV was missing exactly 1 min 5 secs from the end so cut the end from Lus Cam and joined it onto the end of IFLIXs PPV .The quality of the CAM is totally acceptable to see what actually happens at the end of this movie if you dont already know .

Ran a few filters through this as the PPV was quite badly interlaced and in my opinion its not the greatest vid,did that and lowered the red a touch ran a denoise filter but it still suffers from pixelation during movement ,touched on the contrast and altered the value level.....

With the 1 min of CAM all i did was a resize and join not alot else .The join itself isnt the most subtle but it dont overlap and nothing is missing .


I went with a 4:3 AR as i believe thats how it should be


Was it worth all the work im not sure really as retail is pretty soon but heres a copy with the end intact ..........

Apologies no sample included !

Enjoy !
