This is not my own torrent; it is from another site. I\\\'m uploading it here because I had such a hard time finding it and downloading it. There are plenty of torrents out there for Tiger 2008, but I am absolutely convinced this is a better game. The gameplay is about the same, but I think the interface on 2008 is oversized, ugly, and clunky. The playing screen in 2007 is a lot less intrusive. C\\\'mon, EA, a hexagon motif? Also, I\\\'ve seen complaints about one issue that I was just starting to see, a real bad lag at the end of a hole, where the game just freezes for a while before moving on. 2008 is also a lot heavier on resources in general, I think. I know 2007 runs a lot smoother on my machine, and while it isn\\\'t a gaming monster it is new and it isn\\\'t a slouch.

Anyway, I thought there might be some other folks out there who would be glad to get their hands on this, and hopefully you won\\\'t be getting it from in single-digit download speeds the way I had to. Cheers...
