Absolutely love your payback (giving the FBI their information for free, rather than HBGary charging for it - priceless).

Security Consultants? Nah, typical dumb-ass American know-fuck-alls who believe the lie simply because they shout it loud and often enough."

You do realise that if you were to create a .torrent of the 40,000 files uncompressed, the .torrent file would end up being several megabytes big? The Pirate Bay only allows .torrent files of up to around 200KB I believe."

,bluecar5556,2011-02-22T04:25Z,"Wikileaks, Legitimate Whistleblowers or CointelPro?
You have to ask yourself, is the information that is 'leaked' hurting or helping the government?  Also ask the question, if Wikileaks is indeed a CIA front, if you were infact a whistleblower and went straight to wikileaks, you have essentially been led to the honeypot just as a bee is to a flowers nectar.  All I am doing is asking questions, not drawing lines in the sand so please keep that in mind.

,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-22T06:11Z,"Sorry to say, but the ""watch out"" was quite accurate.  Someone's been trying to get into a few of my friends' computers by using private addresses and port 0 in the bittorrent packets.  If you do download this, make sure you block your private address from sending bittorrent packets to you, broadcast addresses and port 0.  Using a proxy wouldn't be a bad idea either; but you should definitely limit the IP addresses that can connect to you."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-22T06:17Z,"Actually, the hacking thing was accurate. Block your internal addresses and multicast addresses from sending you packets; especially on port 0."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-22T06:22Z,"Someone keeps removing my posts about how to keep someone from hacking you. Block port 0, your internal IP addresses and multicast addresses from connecting to you in bittorrent.  Protect yourselves!"
,bluecar5556,2011-02-22T08:53Z,"wikileaks is more than likely a CIA front as a gateway to perusing the 'Combating Infringement and Counterfeits Act.'  It is called Problem, Reaction, Solution.  They create a problem 'leaked' emails, the reaction is purposing the 'Combating Infringement and Counterfeits Act' which is a more intimidating term for Internet censorship and the solution is to join the rest of the several countries that already have their internet censored.  To put it bluntly, Wikileaks is nothing more than Israeli propaganda by the jewish supremacy that have dominated world media and entertainment, soon to be the world if people don't wake up."

More Israeli Zionist Jew propaganda who dominate the media and entertainment industry.  Alex Jones, the fear monger, will certainly have you pointing fingers at everyone but the Zionist Jews from Israel.  Same can be said about David Icke.  If you want my advice, read the book 'Behold a Pale Horse' by 'William Cooper,' which can be found in pdf format on TPB.  I'll be uploading the book 'Jewish Supremacy' by 'Dr. David Duke' in PDF format soon but the audio book is available for the time being."
