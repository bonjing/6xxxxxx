,PaatPiriet,2011-02-04T20:06Z,"I really love all your orchestral soundtracks, I'am not a big fan of all those VA soundtracks as a long time collector I appriciate your effort so I'am able to listen to the new ones and if they are good I go out and buy them and if they are just OK I keep them in MP3 format. These days there are so many new releases and I can't buy them all. So keep them comming if you can. Thanks again man."
