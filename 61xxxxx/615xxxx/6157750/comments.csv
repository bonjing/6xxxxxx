Install with InfixSetup.exe, ran the program and the activation window opened. Canceled and closed the program. Double clicked on one of the "".reg"" files (I picked SupaSta's key InfixPro.reg) to merge with the windows registry. Re-ran the Infix PDF Editor and no activation window popped up. Works great."
