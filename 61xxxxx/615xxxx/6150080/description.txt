since buying this tape in a bar years ago, Bob Snider has gone on to be nominated for a bunch of different awards, and has released many critically-acclaimed albums in a variety of genres, as well as writing a book on songwriting.

His albums are available on itunes and her website and I suggest you support him there.

This particular group of recordings is not commercially available at the moment, so posting it here doesn't take anything away from the artist.
