Uniblue RegistryBooster 2011 5.0.12.1

RegistryBooster is the safest and most trusted solution to clean and optimize your system, freeing it from registry errors and fragmented entries. Using advanced error detection technology, RegistryBooster automatically identifies missing, corrupt or possibly harmful items in your Windows registry, dramatically enhancing performance and general stability.

RegistryBooster improves your PC by optimizing your registry in two distinct ways. After scanning for obsolete and harmful entries, RegistryBooster will clean and fix your registry, removing errors and improving your computer's processing efficiency. RegistryBooster can also defragment your registry by re-ordering instructions for contiguity. With a clean and defragmented registry, your computer can speed along at peak efficiency, with fewer errors and better performance. Above all, RegistryBooster is fast, effective and easy to use.

One mouse click and our registry cleaner does the rest. And using RegistryBooster regularly keeps your PC free from errors and from obsolete, unused or unwanted files. RegistryBooster is trusted by specialist IT technicians and home PC users around the world to solve all their registry based performance problems.

Have you noticed that the longer you have your computer, the slower it runs and the more it crashes? Often this is because whenever you install or uninstall software, add or remove hardware, or change your computerâ€™s settings, the Windows registry is updated. These changes can leave the registry fragmented, with obsolete, corrupted and, in some cases, harmful files. Over time the registry starts to get bogged down and conflicts emerge. Left unchecked, your system will become increasingly unstable, run more slowly and crash more frequently.

RegistryBooster is the easy answer to Windows registry problems. This award winning software will deep scan your registry to identify problems and errors that can cause instability and slowdown. RegistryBooster will then repair or remove harmful registry entries to optimize your PC for better performance. You can also defragment your registry for extra speed and efficiency.

The registry is central to the health of your computer as it contains essential hardware and software instructions that need to be accessed continuously. While a new computer's registry is clean and structured, upon use, particularly through software removal and changes in settings and hardware, bad or useless entries start to accumulate. To compound the registry bloat problem, data can start to fragment with once contiguous registry instructions breaking up into multiple locations. The result is a loss in system efficiency and a tendency for system slow down, errors and conflicts.
