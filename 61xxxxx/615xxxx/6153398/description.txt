The family stay proved to be quite a mouthful for our Loser trainers.

After arriving to find Camp Biggest Loser empty, Hayley revealed the reason to the trainers: not only would they each have to train a family, but spend a week living (and eating) with them. Whisked away by helicopter to their respective new homesteads, Shannan, Michelle, The Commando and Tiffiny saw their momentous task first-hand, piling their plates in a truly eye-opening, waistband-expanding new experience.  The families were awarded their team colours â€“ Westrens (Blue), Moons (Black), Duncans (White), Challenors (Red) â€“ before learning they would have their first weigh-in publicly, for all their loved ones to see.
