Daniel Bautista is a multi faceted artist. He plays different types of music and he's really good at it. He shreds like a pro, probably goes through lots of guitars *nod nod* - but at the same time he does beautiful covers of classical music - you know, the Beethoven and Mozart and that.

Everything in this torrent and much more is available on his own website which I've listed below and in the torrent's info file. He's also on YouTube and Facebook and MySpace but those links probably won't show up here. They're in the info file though ^^ promise.
