,devrimCHE,2011-02-11T14:20Z,"As I wrote to other pals, I'll keep uploading for as long as it takes no matter how slow my speed is. so patience, please... Tecni-qualities change country to country. This is all that I can say."
,devrimCHE,2011-03-19T22:26Z,"People going in for the movies I've uploaded, including those friends complaining about my speed (I guess I've answered them properly, without breaking hearts, hopefully), must be already finished. yet now new downloaders are on the line. Only if I delete these files, I'll be able to upload some more and still precious material. In three or four days's time I'll do this to upload different things. So be alert and seed these movies, please. with the restrictive rules of the country given can I see no other solution whatsoever. take care. Let there be a God and help the Japanese. "
