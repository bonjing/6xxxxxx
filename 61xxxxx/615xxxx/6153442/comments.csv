[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-06T17:30Z,Thanks for that kuttootta.
,DeadWolfBone,2011-02-06T23:03Z,"Fantastic movie, thanks!"
,osriccc,2011-02-17T21:14Z,"Is it JUST ME GETTING THE GHOSTLY YELLOW IMAGE? I mean, it seems the whole movie has a double image (a yellow ghostly replica at the right) like it was awfully encoded... Or is it something with my PC? The sample doesn't seem to have it but the movie itself... Yes, it does. Please, speak about it someone."
,osriccc,2011-02-19T08:14Z,"I wonder if the people commenting really downloaded this? The video itself is BUGGY, and I'm not talking about codecs and all that stuff, already tried in different players and even updated codecs just in case. The image has this ghostly replica in the left side, yellowish... I'm starting to UNTRUST Gopo's torrents. I know that as a pirate consumer I shouldn't bitch about anything but this torrent is BAD, BAD, BAD. Took days to download just to find out that the video is bad, really, how did Gopo encoded this? First with Curse of the Golden Flower saturated sound and now this buggy image in the video that looks like a TV channel badly sintonized. Keep away from it. Want it for a reasonable file size? Bakcup my petiton to HDLite to release this and other Asian movies."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-19T20:25Z,"@Osriccc
Listen pal,just because the movie doesn't play on your pc that doesn't mean it's not encoded correctly.If you would read the description you would know that I test the movies before releasing them.That means that the movie works on my pc just fine.Why it doesn't work for you,I don't know but don't flame my torrents just because you're the only one with a f***ed up pc!"
,osriccc,2011-02-19T21:00Z,"Sorry, jeez... I tried a fourth PC and it went all fine, it was because of K-lite Mega Codec Pack. But the sound on Curse of the Golden Flower is still saturated."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-19T21:23Z,Dude Curse of the golden flower was released over a year ago and no one complained about the sound as no one complained about the video quality of this movie so again there's something wrong with your pc.I checked Curse of the golden flower a couple of minutes ago and the sound is just fine.Either you get a new pc and start enconding yourself or stop saying my releases aren't good or buggy because I'm doing you a favor by uploading  movies in HD quality not the other way around.
,osriccc,2011-02-19T22:05Z,"I found the real problem with this stuff... GeForce 8300 cards or GS editions, they create those ghostly yellow figures in the left size of the screen. I changed my card recently and I found that was the problem (never had to get a high end card because I don't play on my PC). So dudes with 8300 cards or GS editions will probably get the same. The video IS FINE, DOWNLOAD IT AND SEED IT UNTIL YOUR BALLS HIT THE GROUND. Sorry about that shit before... About Curse of the Golden Flower, well, it's only on the parts where the sound is really high, but I don't know, maybe it's my 2.1 Ch speakers on the PC. Thanks for the rips and sorry again, please keep it up with great Korean movies that everyone forget they exist. Jee-won Kim is a great director and this is indeed the best rip of this movie (my favorite from him). A would recommend A Tale of Two Sisters (2003), The Good, the Bad, the Weird (2008) and Departures - Okuribito (2008) to have this kind of rips too. The first two are Jee-won Kim's films too. I Saw the Devil (2009) is the last one by him, but there's already a 720p rip out there. Others who need this kind of treatment are Ghost in the Shell (1995), Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), Ghost in the Shell 2.0, I'm a Cyborg but that's Ok (2006 I think... or 2008). Thanks again and I'll be definitely downloading your rips again and seeding my ass out as now I can trust my video card."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-19T22:28Z,"Glad to see you came to your senses.I kind of think A tale of two sisters is a bit overrated and it isn't really a horror.It's more of a drama/thriller.I saw the devil was very good in a disturbing way and The good,the bad,the weird was mediocre in my opinion.I'll probably rip Departures sometime soon since I wanted to see it for quite some time."
,fillmalei,2011-07-23T17:03Z,Good quality rip and good movie. Thanks!!!
