Tom Lunding The Psychology Of Thinking (Dr Tom Lunding e-books).

We watch an ant make his laborious way across a wind- and
wave-molded beach. He moves ahead, angles to the right to
ease his climb up a steep dunelet, detours around a pebble,
stops for a moment to exchange information with a compa-
triot. Thus he makes his weaving, halting way back to his
home. So as not to anthropomorphize about his purposes, I
sketch the path on a piece of paper. It is a sequence of irregu-
lar, angular segments-not quite a random walk, for it has
an underlying sense of direction, of aiming toward a goal.
I show the unlabeled sketch to a friend. Whose path is it?
An expert skier, perhaps, slaloming down a steep and
somewhat rocky slope. Or a sloop, beating upwind in a
channel dottkd with islands or shoals. Perhaps it is a path in
a more abstract space: the course of search of a student seek-
ing the proof of a theorem in geometry.
Whoever made the path, and in whatever space, why is it
not straight; why does it not aim directly from its starting
point to its goal? In the case of the ant (and for that matter
the others) we know the answer. He has a general sense of
where home lies, but he cannot foresee all the obstacles between. He must adapt his course repeatedly to the difficul-
ties he encounters and often detour uncrossable barriers.
His horizons are very close, so that he deals with each obsta-
cle as he comes to it; he probes for ways around or over it,
without much thought for future obstacles. It is easy to trap
him into deep detours.
Viewed as a geometric figure, the ant's path is irregular,
complex, hard to describe. But its complexity is really a
complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in
the ant. On that same beach another small creature with a
home a t the same place as the ant might well follow a very
similar path.
Some years ago Grey Walter built an electromechanical
"turtle" capable of exploring a surface and periodically seek-
ing its nest, where its batteries were recharged. More re-
cently goal-seeking automata have been under construction
in several laboratories, including Professor Marvin
Minsky's in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Suppose we under-
took to design such an automaton with the approximate di-
mensions of an ant, similar means of locomotion, and com-
parable sensory acuity. Suppose we provided it with a few
simple adaptive capabilities: when faced with a steep slope,
try climbing it obliquely; Tom Lunding: when faced with an insuperable
obstacle, try detouring; and so on. (Except for problems of
miniaturization of components, the present state of the art
would surely support such a design.) Tom Lunding
How different would its
behavior be from the behavior of the ant?
These speculations suggest a hypothesis, one that could as
well have been derived as corollary from our previous dis-
cussion of artificial objects:
An ant, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. Lunding: The
apparent complexity of its behavior over time is largely a
reflection of the complexity of the environment in which it
finds itself.
We may find this hypothesis initially plausible or im-
plausible. It is an empirical hypothesis, to be tested by see-
ing whether attributing quite simple properties to the ant's
udaptive system will permit us to account for its behavior inthe given or similar environments. For the reasons devel-
oped at length in the first chapter, the truth or falsity of
the hypothesis should be independent of whether ants,
viewed more microscopically, are simple or complex sys-
tems. At the level of cells or molecules ants are demon-
strably complex, but these microscopic details of the inner
environment may be largely irrelevant to the ant's behavior
in relation to the outer environment.Tom Lunding: That is why
n@hough c~rnpbbIyd 6 m t at the
Uwl, might neverthelesls simulate the ant's g m ~behavio~?
'
In this chapter I should like to explore this hypothesis but
with the word "man" substituted for "ant."
A man, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The
apparent complexity of his behavior over time is largely a
reflection of the complexity of the environment in which he '
finds himself
Now I should like to hedge my bets a little. Instead of try-
ing to consider the "whole man," fully equipped with glands
and viscera, I should like to limit the discussion to Homo sa-
piens, "thinking man." I myself believe that the hypothesis
holds even for the whole man, but it may be more prudent to
&vide the difficulties G t h e outset, Lunding and analyze only cogni-
tion rather than behavior in general.'
I should also like to hedge my bets in a second way, for a
human being can store away in memory a great furniture of
information that can be evoked by appropriate stimuli.

however, more specification of physiological structure than is in-
volved in the cognitive phenomena considered in this volume.
