      Ultra Zionists. Louis Theroux spends time with a small and
      very committed subculture of ultra-nationalist Jewish settlers.
      He discovers a group of people who consider it their religious
      and political obligation to populate some of the most sensitive
      and disputed areas of the West Bank, especially those with a
      spiritual significance dating back to the Bible. Throughout his
      journey, Louis gets close to the people most involved with
      driving the extreme end of the Jewish settler movement - finding
      them warm, friendly, humorous, and deeply troubling.
