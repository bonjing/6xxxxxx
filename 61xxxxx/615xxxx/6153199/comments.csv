,TheSH3RIFF,2011-03-21T19:39Z,"THIS IS THE 1.5.0 version!

The Latest is 1.5.1! Which includes:
- Ham ‘Em High – 30 new levels
- New Golden Eggs. I would presume there are three: #18, #19 and the Super Bowl / Rio Golden Egg.
- The ability to switch into “windowed” mode from the main screen (click the settings icon under the “Play” button)
- A new and improved pause menu.
- Bug fixes


PLEASE ANYONE! UPLOAD THE LATEST VERSION!"
,skadude,2011-03-22T19:44Z,"For any that get this error:

""The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002). Click on OK to terminate the application.""

I solved this by opening angrybirds.exe in the app 'Dependency walker'. This program said a couple of .dll's were missing.

I downloaded these and put them in the game directory. And low and behold, I spent the rest of the afternoon avoiding study by playing this terribly addictive game. Apparently it has something to do with winxp versions.

The dll's I needed were:

msjava.dll
msvcp90.dll
msvcr90.dll
msvcr100.dll
INETCOMM.DLL

Hope this helps. Now, I will make pork for dinner. B.T.W. Thanks for the upload."
,vicayork,2011-03-28T15:25Z,"it works perfect...
thanks a lot"
,StuScotland,2011-04-26T11:20Z,Rite think av worked it out guys. For the guys that are having problems with Xp Vista etc with the application side-by-side problem. I downloaded itunes for pc and it must be something to do with quicktime I think but the game works now on my Vista home basic x86. hope it works 
,nittany,2011-05-12T13:02Z,"I searched around and someone mentioned to reinstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables 2005, 2008 and 2010 to get this game to work.  I did that and still didn't work.

Someone else then mentioned that he fixed the same exact problem I have by installing itunes/quicktime so I did that and bam, now it works fine."
