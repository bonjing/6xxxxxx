PlayStation-Ready Movie Trailers
7th of February, 2011


Since there are lots of new TV spots on the Super Bowl night,
it seemed right to make special release of this trailer
pack. So, everything is in 480p, except The Eagle and
Take Me Home Tonight (and Terra Nova, of course): their
quality is not good enough to limit their picture size. Enjoy!
