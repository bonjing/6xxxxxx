"Concentrate and Ask Again" 

When a scientist falls dead after ingesting 
a lethal cloud of blue powder and his bones 
disintegrate in his body, the CDC suspects 
a biological attack. As the Fringe Team 
investigates further, a subject from 
Walter's past with ties to Olivia 
reluctantly agrees to assist with the 
intense case.

Enjoy :)
