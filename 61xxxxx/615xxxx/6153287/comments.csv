Just google for ""tropa de elite 2 subtitles podnapisi"" without the quotation marks."
,Sledge83,2011-02-08T17:49Z,"Thx for a great movie! Heres some subtitles, both English and other. Only the English ones are tried and at least one of them are good for this version.  Give it a shot :)  If experiencing Sync problem while playing in WDTV or other media-players, just make delay.

,alashattu,2011-02-08T18:59Z,"doclucas: The subtitle you mentioned is google translated and grammatically incorrect, also some words are still not translated. I wouldn't recommend watching with those but to wait for proper english subs.. 

Sledge83: the link you gave leads to a subtitle search for the previous Elite Squad movie from 2007. However, subtitles for this movie can also be found there if you search - although they are exactly the same as found behind doclucas' link (google translated).

Does anyone know where to find PROPER english subtitles that haven't been google translated?"
