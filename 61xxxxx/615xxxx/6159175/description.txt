This instrumental album features the Celtic folk harp and Swedish nyckelharpa supported by a rich assortment of acoustic instruments to create a graceful and heartfelt collection of timeless music.
Beautiful, sincere, and relaxing, Two Worlds One is excellent for the healing arts (yoga, meditation, and more).

Features gorgeous traditional and original compositions.

"The meeting of Lisa Lynne and Aryeh Frankfurter isn't just a meeting of two harpists. It's a merging of multi-instrumentalists, a marriage of soulful fantasy with an explorer's heart on a chamber folk music stage of the imagination. Two Worlds One is indeed a new planet of music born from a tangle of strings and two intertwined musical souls." -- John Diliberto, Echoes, Public Radio International
