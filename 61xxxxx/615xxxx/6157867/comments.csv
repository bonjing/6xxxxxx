,XxDarkShadowxX,2011-02-07T22:14Z,"I dont disagree with you that there should be more seeders, but Im seeding 129-120 right now it says there are 25 seeds.  Are they fakes?"
,Pokler,2011-02-07T23:59Z,"129-120 is fine now. 

I'm referring to 119-110. I've seen that one go from 15 down to 4 and it was around 8 last time I checked. Not good, eventhough the torrent is spread so well it is many times complete even without a seed.

This is about the point the image quality of the videos grows less, so it might have something to do with that; but people should seed everything they download no matter if they want to keep it.

,Pokler,2011-02-08T00:02Z,"About the fakes, I've seen even 8 seeds on files I just started seeding and they don't seem to affect the availability of the torrent by being there so that can't be good. Availability goes hand in hand with MY upload ratio every time.

If some people would be helping out they would give a shout out on here me thinks."
