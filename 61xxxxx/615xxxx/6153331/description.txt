These two tracks were briefly available for download from the Achewood Radio section of the now-all-but-defunct webcomic Achewood, created by Chris Onstad.

The Tenmen are Roast Beef's favourite band-- a three-piece outfit of house cats wearing sunglasses and playing Rickenbacker guitars and a single snare drum. Lacking better information, I can only assume these three house cats composed and recorded the two tracks contained in this torrent.

Although the webcomic portrays some Tenmen songs as having lyrics, "Sidewalk Song" and "80" are instrumentals.

Your bemusement is appreciated.
