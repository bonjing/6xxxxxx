,Undietaker,2011-02-07T09:24Z,"I think the end is missing? ends with 2 guys lifting a grate off a drain, cuts out there, not sure if is supposed to be the end or not. Blurry anyway and has iwannadownload advertisement at bottom for the last 30 mins"

,Cathymike,2011-02-19T16:12Z,"that is not how it ends, the end is missing!!!"
,mitschwei,2011-03-10T23:38Z,"Yes it is the ending Cathymike... I saw it in theaters. It is there for suspense purposes, and it is talked about multiple times during the movie to make you wonder. Also, it is worth the watch, it is a good movie (8 1/2 out of 10)"
