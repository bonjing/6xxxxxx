[b]Thx Hive

Source PPVRIP IFLIX
thx

Video: 640x380 @bitrate 1200 2pass
Audio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo
Sample: yes included

Encode:

removed interlace,corrected aspect to the only right 4:3 resolution 640x480.
added brightness,sharpness,rgb,chroma and denoise. cleaned audiotrack from hiss,hum etc.
still the original video suffered from pixelation in movement scenes probably because of the lower recorded framerate of 29000 instead of 29970 which looks like missing frames. cant do anything about that. still good watchable

Lara Brennan is arrested for murdering her boss whom she had an argument with. 
It seems she was seen leaving the scene of the crime and her fingerprints were 
on the murder weapon. Her husband, John would spend the next few years trying to 
get her released but there's no evidence that negates the evidence against her. 
And when the strain of being separated from her family especially her son gets to her, 
John decides to break her out. So he does a lot of research to find a way.
