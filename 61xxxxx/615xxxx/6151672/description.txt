The Sisters Of Mercy live in Detmold 1984.  This is the classic pre-first album set, featuring material from their early EP's plus their usual tasteful selection of cover versions.  MP3 format at 192 kbps.  Definitely an audience recording.  

The sound quality is best described as ROUGH, but it does have real balls and after a while you get into it an no longer notice how rough it is.  Persevere with it!  This is a much better performance than the Milan set also uploaded.  The versions of Floorshow and Emma are intense, and the finale is a 13-minute bone-crunching Ghost Rider/Sister Ray medley.  Best track for me is Body Electric, so much more energy than either of the studio versions.  This is my favourite SOM bootleg by a mile.
