,dessappy,2011-02-08T09:13Z,thank you so much
,winwinwin,2011-02-08T12:57Z,"this torrent doesn't budge one bit.
got this one in under 5 minutes : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6158672/[swelog.net]How.I.Met.Your.Mother.S06E15.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSIO
your torrents seem to have something off..."
,torinogut,2011-02-08T17:33Z,"When it comes to 720p releases, Alex IS the best! Keep up the good work"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-08T22:47Z,"@winwinwin.
highly doubt that.

@torinogut
thanks. I actually thought about stopping my 720p uploads but comments like those make me keep going."
,winwinwin,2011-02-08T23:11Z,"Added to download 11 hours ago, and nothing (not a single KB) has been transferred.
Your torrents have definitely something different from the usual ones..."
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-09T04:44Z,"@winwinwin

what client are you using and have you portforwarded?"
,raghav80,2011-02-09T11:32Z,"Downloaded just fine...speed was slower than normal...But a fine download with awesone print

A=10
V=10"
,winwinwin,2011-02-09T18:26Z,"Using a Synology NAS for the downloading (have so for the last 3 years with no problem whatsoever). The downloading engine of the NAS is based on a customized rTorrent client.
All necessary ports are forwarded (and have been for many years) : TCP 6881-6890 and UDP 6881
Tried a few random torrents from TPB (with seeds), they get to downloading quite quickly, and download rate is acceptable.

I get this odd behaviour for all your torrents I've tried so far... confusing..."
,shaan117,2011-02-09T23:01Z,Amazing thank you!
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-09T23:05Z,"@winwinwin

The only thing i would recomend is just using a different client.

My seedbox ended on the 14th i think. and if i can get enough money, i'll keep uploading the 720p shows and switch to a seedbox provider with more clients so people dont have any issues."
,winwinwin,2011-02-10T04:05Z,Using a different client isn't really an option.
,pong.lenis,2011-02-10T14:33Z,"Great stuff, download only took about 7 minutes"
,Croga,2011-03-04T19:50Z,"Same as winwinwin; useing Synology NAS, torrent won't budge :("
