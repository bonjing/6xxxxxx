This cost me $30 last night at Monster Jam. Toppled with a $8 hot dog plus what I spent on the boys food pissed me off enough to upload this asap to those of you that didnt have the cash to shell out at the event. As if we didnt spend enough.

They are ripped from the 2 dvd set. First one is the racing second is freestyle. The quality is exactly the same as the disks. I burned each to dvd and couldnt tell the difference in my blueray player. My 3 year old has not stopped watching these since we got back. Had to rip them while he was watching the other. 
Enjoy!
