,IZZY-E,2011-03-02T20:00Z,Are you guys retarted? Its a fricken awesome quality movie honestly i give it a 9 in visual as well as audio. It says 720p but since its not a blu ray just like it says then you cant expect it to be HD. 5 and 6 visual and audio is a terrible rating its not like your streaming it cuz thats basically what your ratings say. If you want this good quality then download this 1 if not well thats up to you.
