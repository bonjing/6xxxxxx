Storyline: An Italian fishing boat crew working off the coast of Marseille, France, finds an unconscious man (Matt Damon) adrift in the Mediterranean with two gunshot wounds in his back. When he wakes up, the man comes to realize he suffers from retrograde amnesia, having only one clue to his identity: the account number to a safe deposit box provided by a tiny laser projector surgically implanted in his hip. Traveling to ZÃ¼rich,Switzerland to find the corresponding bank, the man discovers he is skilled in advanced hand-to-hand combat when he instinctively defends himself from two policemen questioning him for loitering in a closed park at night. The man arrives at the bank and finds the deposit box contains a significant amount of cash in differering denominations and several passports with his photo, but with numerous aliases. He assumes the name on the first passport, "Jason Bourne," and leaves as a bank employee notifies a CIA Special Activities Division group"Operation Treadstone" about his visit. Bourne evades the ZÃ¼rich police and flees to the embassy where he is accosted by the officials there but once again manages to elude capture. A few blocks away, he induces Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) with US$20,000 to take him to Paris to the address on his "Bourne" passport.

Storyline: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) have been living incognito in Goa, India for the past two years where Bourne struggles to recall the specifics of his first mission as a black ops agent. In Berlin,CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) runs a "buy operation", spending USD3 million to purchase evidence exposing the mole within the agency that stole $20 million in allocation money seven years prior. Before Landy's operative can complete the transaction, Russian F.S.B.agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the building, plants a fingerprint to frame Bourne, kills Landy's operative and the seller of the information and makes off with the evidence and the $3 million. Kirill then reports back to Russian oil magnate Yuri Gretkov (Karel Roden), who sends him to Goa to finish the frame-job by assassinating Bourne. Bourne spots Kirill coming and flees with Marie in a jeep. Kirill gives chase and shoots at the vehicle to kill Bourne but kills Marie instead, causing the jeep to run off a bridge and crash into the river below. Kirill leaves,believing Bourne to be dead, but Bourne survives the accident and departs for Naples, Italy to seek vengeance.

Storyline: Former CIA covert operative Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), eludes Moscow police and goes into hiding after being shot by Russian F.S.B. agent Kirill (in the previous film, The Bourne Supremacy). Six weeks later, Guardian correspondent Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) meets with a source to discuss Bourne and Operation Treadstone. The CIA begin tracking Ross when he mentions "Operation Blackbriar" on a cell phone call to his editor.

In London, Bourne meets with Ross at Waterloo Station after learning of Ross' investigation of Treadstone. When Bourne realizes that the CIA is tracking Ross, he helps him evade capture by single-handedly knocking out several agents, but Ross deviates from Bourne's instructions and is killed by Blackbriar"asset" (assassin) Paz (Ã‰dgar RamÃ­rez) on orders from Blackbriar's director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn).
