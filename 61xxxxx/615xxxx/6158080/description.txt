WAT Remover For Windows7 By Hazar

Use This IF Windows 7 Loader by Daz 1.7.7 Doesn't Work for you

remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining genuine status and receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender.
There will be no windows activation section in control panel (thanks to nononsence)
