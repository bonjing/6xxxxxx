,Sponxy,2011-02-11T14:58Z,"Good movie, I can see they've gotten some of their ideas from Cloverfield, haha. Subtitles aren't too good, seems very google translate-ish at times, but you get what they're saying atleast, way to go Norway!"
,Rumikosan,2011-02-11T20:48Z,"This is one movie which makes me proud of being Norwegian :)
Hollywood simply can't remake a movie like this into hollywood style. it's just too much Norwegian fantasy and stories in it ;)

Great upload!

Should be downloaded fairly quickly.

Been waiting for this for ages."
,gratefulforthis,2011-02-18T12:46Z,"Very quick download and a quick look shows it's perfection.

To my shock Nero Vision ignores subs (many years using and first time I've needed them lol).

Anyone know of decent blu-ray burning that will allow me to embed the subs, please?"
,Mikkel Rev,2011-02-18T23:25Z,thanx :) (takk)
,gratefulforthis,2011-02-22T01:19Z,"subs fail after 30mins.

DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS UNLESS YOU SPEAK NORWEGIAN. "
