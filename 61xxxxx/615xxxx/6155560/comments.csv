one question thought......
I've tried this avast 6 but Im kinda confuse on the setting of it???
Its really super sensitive....
Its blocking my download move's In bit torret and some of the site.....
keeps on saying error: access deny thingy... ^^
remove the http ports... but it's still doing the same....

do ya have to put it on the exclusion list or what??

(avast 6 is really a site blocker for unsure site's)

can ya give me good pointer's or this is just normal???"

,Tranqd,2011-02-12T21:27Z,"Every time I try and add the liscence file in, it says 'Unable to insert Liscence File.' I'm assuming avast has disabled it. I did it offline and online by the way. Hope it gets fixed soon, I really like avast."
[T],locobot12,2011-02-12T22:07Z,"@tranqd

Its working perfectly for me! i'm using it curently!!

the license is only for Internet security not for pro!
do not insert license to some other already installed version!
download this file completly ,install and then insert license!!

if fails disable avast modules and self defense try inserting!"
