,chem41,2011-02-05T05:06Z,"a request

savin private ryan 1998

size dun matter"
,ladderman22,2011-02-05T06:41Z,"hey how do you decide what movies to do - was this a request?
I only ask cause I already downloaded other rips of both this and middle men cause i didn't know you would do one.
So how do you decide?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-05T07:38Z,"@tylr: Nope. TPB glitch. Maybe he refused posting such low rating. And - I told you - change your way of wording - at least with me. I have not deserved bad treatment by you, right?

@chem41: ""size dun matter"" sounds really funny.

@ladderman22: Middle men was requested by my friend and this one just happened."

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-05T12:40Z,"@nabarun69: I've seen request yesterday.... but I placed REQUESTS ARE ""ON HOLD"" all over the place - every fucking day, several times.

Point being - how people EXPECT me to read their requests if they turn blind eye on my writing? Not to mention stupid thing as - showing  the respect, both-ways..."

,srisuk,2011-02-05T16:35Z,"It's amazing how you can convert so many great video files into such a small size. Much appreciated, I've replaced my Pirate Bay bookmark with your location. Keep up the good work."
,Draco1988,2011-02-05T16:53Z,"@twentyforty:: Why the Heck are you so full of ATTITUDE?i totally agree with you upon the things you are an upcoming Uploader with hardly any Flaws.
i have been following you from a long time; i mean in the early days when there used to be no TV Packs.
You have turned into ""An Organized Uploader""
Most of all You have been Uploading Daily with Tight Schedule.Living up to the Peoples Requests too.
But why the Heck are you so self cherished?
* Thumbs Up * - Please Maintain Your Calm."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-05T16:59Z,"@chem41; I remembered hundredths of idiots who claimed differently, drawing the connection between my small-sized rips and size of my penis. ""Anyone who make small-sized rips must have small dick"" - they claimed, even if psychology for years knows that exact opposite is the fact.
BIG rips, as fast cars and fast driving are here as a compensation and an extension - for all sorts of ""details"", so knock yourself out with WiKi or Melite rip, or find something even bigger - I suggest untouched BluRay ISO which is probably 38 GB. Or even commit a heresy - buy frikkin BluRay...


Harsh? Nope. I have visited Riddlera torrent and read comments from mentally ill people, that made me sick and I suddenly lost the interest. One third of the idiots always claimed that I should learn FROM Riddlera how rip should be done, and if you've find his work as ""disappointing"" I cannot see how I could do better, right?  "
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-05T17:04Z,@Draco1988: LOL. Anyone could go someplace else. And - you insulted me right now and expect better treatment?
,Draco1988,2011-02-05T17:16Z,"No one wants better Treatment from you are anyone else from this community;its not your job to upload STUFF you do it for fun(or are you earning out of this?) either way you cant make me or anyone else go at some other place.
So be it,i gave you an advise *TO MAINTAIN CALM*
you don't wanna lead to that path so FUCK IT.
i am just suggesting to ignore Stupid comments as long as (+)es > (-)es.
Rest i neither want Treatment Nor any MOVIE REQUESTS.
So carry on with the Stuff.
Anyways your *LOL* should be replied as  
::MANNERS PLEASE,right? ::"
,madtown4,2011-02-05T17:35Z,"@Draco1988: LOL. Anyone could go someplace else. And - you insulted me right now and expect better treatment?  

ditto "
,abj642,2011-02-05T18:42Z,"@Draco1988
if you are not happy with twentyforty's uploads go somwhere else instead of whining here.. better upload something and show how it should be done"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-05T19:35Z,"It is about my manners. It is about how I act and react. Quality of my encodes never were mentioned here.

So, it was about the treatment, logic implies, right? No matter denial: ""No one wants better Treatment from you"" - because it's all about.

Basically, calls such as ""*TO MAINTAIN CALM* and :MANNERS PLEASE came usually from the people who think that they have god-given-right to say anything they like and on the way that suits them, but forgot to say ""How do you do"" or ask ""may I come in"" entering someone's home. They have no respect and therefore confusion they spread, every second sentence contradicts to one before, warm-cold, nice-bad, and so on  and on.
And when I god-forbid, treat them as ""unstable"", they wonder, because, in reality, they cannot ""see"" themselves, nor others, nor the world around as it is. I cannot blame anybody for being stupid or mentally ill and not knowing that, but I CAN say them ""Fuck off"" or for ""sensitive ears"" say ""Calm your noodles down"" by same merit as theirs. Does that makes me better? No, of course not. Does this makes me one of them? Not even close. Often forgotten thing is that you all came - to me, not  vice-versa... You came into my virtual home, to get something I have but decided to share - and same rules doesn't apply as for me as for you.

So, as I said: Take it or - leave it."
,justregged,2011-02-06T19:25Z,"Thanks for this 20-40

I wonder who gave the minuses, im guessing it was your long time follower who's on here all the time thanking you for your uploads. Oh no wait the only time he came on to thank you was so he could complain about your attitude. What a tool!"
