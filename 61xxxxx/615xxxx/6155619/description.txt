Duty Calls: Noobs Beware (2011/ENG)
Language : English | PC | Developer : People Can Fly | Publisher : Electronic Arts | 760 Mb
Genre : Action (Shooter)

EA cheered us audacious parody of the series of Call of Duty called Duty Calls. In truth, Duty Calls - a marketing 

ploy EA, Epic Games and People Can Fly to draw attention to Bulletstorm. About this becomes clear after 5 minutes 
through the game, during a demonstration video about Bulletstorm. Here's what he said Epic Games, Cliff Bleszinski:
 "Wow, I'm terribly shocked. This game will transform the military shooter genre." Will laugh lawyers Activision? 
Hardly, although the game developers have prepared in advance: "Duty Calls - it is a parody. It does not apply to 
companies or Activision Series Call of Duty."

System requirements:

Operating system: Intel Pentium 4,2 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 2800 or dvuhyaderny Intel or AMD 1,8 GHz
RAM: 512 MB (WindowsXP), 768MB (Windows Vista)
Video card: NVIDIA Geforce 6600 is better, ATI Radeon
