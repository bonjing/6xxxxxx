Bands of 208 is a collection of footage and material that intends to shed light on a self grown music scene flourishing in the neighborhoods in and around downtown Boise Idaho. It centers itself around three locations; Grandmas House, Baby Sale, and the 208 House; breaching the music and the people interwoven into a moment in time that took place in the summer of 2009. Featuring Music from: Vagerfly, Scarf, Gorilla Thunder, For Fucks Sake, Angels of the Dust, La Knots, Sword of a Bad Speller, Okay Okay, Mere Cat, Castrati and more. "What's great about a subculture is that it's better and sometimes stronger than everything else around, before you even know it exists. Bands of 208 gives music to that murmur in the American valves that wonderfully threatens to become the entire pulse. This is cinema that does what cinema should, play beautifully and dethrone you at the same time." - J. Reuben Appelman
