,chapter81,2011-02-08T05:32Z,"If anyone have problems installing, here's how, explained in another way (and how I did it):

1) Install Autodesk Softimage.
2) Use serial 667-98989898.
3) Use Product Key 185C1.
4) Finish installation and start Autodesk Softimage.
5) Ask to Activate. It will show an error regarding your serial. Click Close.
6) Back to the activation screen, open the correct keygen (using ""Run as Administrator"" command!) depending on the version installed (32-bit or 64-bit). 
7) Choose Mem Patch. You should see a window saying ""Successfully Patched"" (the activation screen must be active/opened when using the Keygen to patch the memory!).
8) Choose ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"".
9) Copy the request code into the Keygen and press generate.
10) Copy the activation code back to the activation screen and don't worry some characters are missing. The software will authorize it anyway.

THAT'S IT, ENJOY YOUR SOFTIMAGE COPY!



*Remember to run the keygen using ""Run as administrator""
*Remember that the activation screen must be active when running the Mem Patch command."

,Nyphot,2011-04-04T11:30Z,++ Product key is 590C1 ++  I encountered an error later on and was unable to activate. After re-installing it worked. I think this may have been the reason.
,Nyphot,2011-04-04T11:35Z,"Other than that, everything works just fine. Thanks for the share. +1"
