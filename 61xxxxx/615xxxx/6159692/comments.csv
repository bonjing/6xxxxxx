,Phov,2011-02-09T01:30Z,"Thanks a lot for those great uploads.

Although, maybe someone can explain something to me... I got season 5 and 6 from here... one episode after the other for 2 years. Everything was going fantastic until lately.

Before, I dloaded the episodes at like 500-600 kb/s and it took me a ridiculous 15 min.

But now even though thereâ€™s 3342 seeders and Iâ€™m connected to like 30-40 or 60 of them... I canâ€™t get over 55 kb/s !!!???

Iâ€™m using Transmission. Seeding like I can (~20kbs). 

Is it my client? I see so many people using ÂµTorrent with a completed download but I see a closed lock beside them??? Do i have to get ÂµTorrent too? Are they using a private tracker? I want acces to that? Help me please...

I mean, donâ€™t get me wrong here, Iâ€™ve been dloading torrents for 10 years now. I know how it works... but this is just not making sense to me."

That maybe happens cuz they're not seeding or, cuz they put some limit at the upload rate!

Just a bunch of assholes!"
