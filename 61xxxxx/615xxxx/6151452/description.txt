A leading light of the contemporary Scottish folk scene, Emily Smith's powerful, clear vocals have gained her award winning, worldwide recognition. As a songwriter she has been likened to `a Scottish Joni Mitchell', but as a collector is equally adept at presenting fresh and evocative interpretations of traditional songs. Smith burst onto the folk scene in 2002 when she won BBC Radio Scotland's Young Traditional Musician of the Year Award. Steering a delicately poised course between the worlds of traditional and contemporary folk recording sessions for BBC Radio 2's Bob Harris, Mike Harding and Aled Jones and was a featured singer on award winning TV series Transatlantic Sessions 4. Alongside her solo career she has worked with artists from the folk scene and beyond including Eddi Reader, Beth Nielsen Chapman and Karine Polwart. Smith's new release, Traiveller's Joy, features songs written on the road throughout 2010 blending alongside traditional material sourced from the travelling people of Scotland. Emily continues to draw inspiration from her home area of Dumfriesshire but this release sees her writing from a more personal viewpoint than before. Covers include `Waltzing's For Dreamers' by Richard Thompson, whom Emily opened for on his UK tour in 2009 and was subsequently featured at London's Meltdown Festival 2010 during his year as curator.
