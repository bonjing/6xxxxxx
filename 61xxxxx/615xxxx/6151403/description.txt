Have started a new blogsite where I will post smaller size versions of all old and new movies. The prints are really good and in most cases you cant even find much difference in quality.The site is 

          h*t*t*p*:*/*/c*u*b*i*c*m*.*b*l*o*g*s*p*o*t*.*c*o*m*/ (without the * :)

Check and visit the site time to time if you want to save your precious bandwidth
without compromising the quality.If you have any request for movies please submit it on the blogsite.

Have uploaded the 300mb version of the movie 127 Hours in the site.If you want to download it directly please follow the link :
