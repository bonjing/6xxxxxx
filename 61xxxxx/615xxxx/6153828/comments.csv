Another question: Do you guys get paid for this or make money in any way? Or do you just do it cuz you like to do it? I'd like to upload a few things but I don't know how... Where could I learn and could I make money from it? 

Just curious... 

As always.... THANK YOU!"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-02-06T19:08Z,I don't make any money.  It's the reverse actually.  It's enjoyable sometimes.
,Hdavila,2011-02-06T19:43Z,"Yeah, I kinda figured that but was curious. Thanks for this and all your work. Very much appreciated. "
