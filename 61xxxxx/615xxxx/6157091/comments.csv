,SnipedSniper,2011-04-29T17:09Z,"Thank you SO much for this torrent. I had sylenth1.2.1 before and it was shit.
This 2.2.0 has about 30 preset banks containing literally about 3,000 presets and it works perfect after importing the file using the Sylenth1 menu.
THANKS!"
,CirezD69,2011-07-15T01:45Z,"Never commented on a torrent before and made this account just so i could thank you. I downloaded this with the soundbank you uploaded and god am i happy. Being using a 16 gig nexus since now and it dosent even compare to the sounds in this program great stuff thanks again!! Cant wait to finish my new track with this. http://soundcloud.com/thomasjamesmcd should be on there soon.

,NIEWQL,2011-07-28T14:39Z,"@CirezD69: Your comment made me download this. Now I'm gonna try it :-) Also listening to your tracks now, nice!

Did you use Sylenth1 somewhere already?"
,Clickheretoo,2011-08-07T21:34Z,I just downloaded this and it says it is only a demo. Is it? Or am I doing something wrong?
,Pezu,2011-09-01T15:51Z,Lichertoo when you unrar the file you see setup and lisence.dat after you have installed you must copy the file into the folder where you have installed the files i hope this helps :)

,mackbeats7,2011-10-04T00:43Z,"I'm getting the demo problem too, any fix?"
,4tehlulz,2011-10-12T20:14Z,"READ IF YOU ARE HAVING THE DEMO PROBLEM:
Drag and drop (or copy & paste) the file ""License.dat"" into this folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\VstPlugins\LennarDigital\Sylenth1

Torrent works like a charm! Thanks for uploading! :)"

,nikmanto,2011-10-25T15:25Z,"I can't get this torrent to work, i have read what to do and so on. But when i open up my plugin it says ""Demo"" and there is no sound.. hm.. :-/ Normally there is sound on the Demo version.. I copy the Licence file into my folder but it still won't work..."
,Get_Lost,2011-12-05T06:10Z,"@Nikmanto: You have to click on the register when Sylenth1 is open, and pick up the license.dat-file from there,- it's not enough just to put it in the right folder.

Anyways,- Awsome collection of sounds, one of the best synths out there. "
,gyynther,2011-12-30T14:25Z,"@SnipedSniper: Can anyone help me to get a few things to work? I downloaded this and only got all the skins and like 20 presets.. How do I get the 3,000 presets that people talk about.. ?

One more thing: When I upgraded from FL 9 to 10 Toxic Biohazard and a few other things stoped working.. their presets disapeared. Is the presets in a wrong map or something...?"
,Wmac302,2012-01-12T05:33Z,"Having the same problem as Gyynther. Installation went fine, I just ended up with the skins and only 20 or so presets...Someone please help us out, would be much much much appreciated."

,xcf,2012-03-13T01:43Z,"@gyynther, Wmac302

In Sylenth1, hit the Menu and hit ""Load Bank (.fxb)"", In the load bank box, you'll see a SoundBank folder (If you don't, navigate to C:Program Files (x86)VstPluginsLennarDigitalSylenth1 ), which contains a bunch of banks. The default factory presets is FactoryBank1.fxb.

The one that's first loaded on the cracked version (only containing 34 presets with the first one labeled ""TEAM Peace-Out"") is the peace-out.fxb, found in the folder containing the SoundBank folder.

If you want to load FactoryBank1.fxb (or any of the others inside the SoundBank folder) when you first start Sylenth1, copy FactoryBank1.fxb and go up a folder. Rename the peace-out.fxb to peace-out-old.fxb (or delete it if you don't want it), and paste the FactoryBank1.fxb in and rename it to peace-out.fxb."
