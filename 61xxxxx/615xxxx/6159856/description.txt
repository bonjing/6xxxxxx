The all-inclusive book on the cutting-edge science driving the medicinal chemistry of the latest drugs The successor to the editors' two highly acclaimed works on drug synthesis, Contemporary Drug Synthesis and The Art of Drug Synthesis, this book provides refocused and extensive new coverage detailing how chemistry, biology, and pharmacokinetics integrate to spearhead successful medical findings. Modern Drug Synthesis carries on the mission of delivering the most up-to-date developments unfolding in this rapidly evolving field by placing a stronger emphasis on medicinal chemistry and pharmacology, in addition to drug synthesis. Other highlights include: 

Chapters are logically divided into categories such as background of disease area, pharmacology, SAR (structure-activity relationships), pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, efficacy and safety, and synthesis Expert analysis of the pros and cons of different synthetic routes A step-by-step breakdown of today's drug discovery process for professionals and students Supporting case studies in each chapter Modern Drug Synthesis shows that whether drug synthesis is in early development or the process stage, the ability to design elegant and economical synthetic routes is often a major factor making a drug a commercial winner. Easy to follow and stacked with valuable information on the present and future direction of medicinal chemistry, Modern Drug Synthesis is the one guide that paints a clear and complete picture of this complex subject.
