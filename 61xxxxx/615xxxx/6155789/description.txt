This is a companion to my previous release of Philip K. Dick's novels for Kindle. These are Kindle-ready .mobi files of the Complete Short Stories of Philip K. Dick, vols. 1-5. For those who recall, there were periods in the 1960s-70s where every single magazine had a short story by Philip K. Dick, and they've proven particularly fertile for Hollywood, providing the inspiration for movies such as 'Paycheck' and 'Minority Report'.
