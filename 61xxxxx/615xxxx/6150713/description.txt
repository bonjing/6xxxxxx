The Emmy-award winning Family Feud first aired in the U.S. over 30 years ago and is one of the most iconic game shows in broadcast history. It continues to be one of the top-rated game shows on the air today. The scoreboard, â€œSurvey Says!â€ and â€œFast Money Roundâ€ have become part of pop culture and are recognizable elements in the video game that is a fun-for-the-family experience. Family Feud Decades challenges players with thousands of authentic survey questions from four different eras (70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s) to fuel the competitive fun. The game features the true-to-TV show sets from all four decades.
