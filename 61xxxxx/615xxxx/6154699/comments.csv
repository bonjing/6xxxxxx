,Nuthinbetr2do,2011-02-19T07:54Z,"I am not getting a message, however, even though I have downloaded the whole movie, it will only play or burn the first minute before it shuts the whole program shuts down.
If it helps any, there is a copyright message that comes up with the ""Jaybob"" torrent.

Perhaps the production company has put the kabosh on this torrent.  Lucky if you got it downloaded before the messages..."

,ili2882,2011-06-02T18:19Z,"For all of you getting threatening messages from your isp's and the MAFIAA I'd recommend moving to Canada or coming back to Europe or where ever your ancestors came from, where I live it's illegal for anyone without a court order to monitor my electronic communication (to get a court order they'll have to prove that monitoring my communication is vital to preventing a crime, freedom of speech is not a crime plus only the police not the MAFIAA might monitor my communication), let the MAFIAA try that here, they'll end up paying me big bucks for violating my privacy. The US might have been the home of the free but now it's the home of the frightened.
Tnx FXG"
