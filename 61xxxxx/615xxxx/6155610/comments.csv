,ShadowJax04,2011-07-02T00:35Z,"Hi, how did you get it to work on a 64bit? 

Thank you."
,zaf.ansari,2011-07-17T12:03Z,"Great torrent, but could anyone please post a summary of the installation process. Am trying to install this on a Dual Core machine with Windows XP 32-bit. I start installation from the setup on cd1. It begins setup showing a progress of 99% and then crashes. Any idea what could be wrong?"
,usmcally,2011-08-13T03:48Z,to fix the insert cd 2 error all you have to do is open the Vampire Patch FR patch file and take the vampire.exe file there and put it into the game directory replacing the vampire.exe file that is already there.
,voraxith,2011-08-27T10:32Z,"Okay, I've got everything extracted, but when I run Setup, it stops as soon as the Wizard initializes.  I'm running Win 7, so can anyone help me figure this out?"
,iownall555,2011-09-03T09:09Z,"For anyone having problems with the setup crashing, try right clicking on the setup program, click Properties, click the Compatibility tab and set the compatibility mode to ""Windows 95"" or ""Windows 98"". Then run the setup again and it might work. It may also be a problem if your OS is 64 Bit (Such as 64 Bit Win 7)."
