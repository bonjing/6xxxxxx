If you want to scan this then it will contain a virus like ALL keygens do. The virus just disables when sony vegas asks for a serial and authentication code it disables it so that the serial number in the keygen works!

Note: You will need winrar or a programme which can extract files. I recomend winrar!

Simple steps:

1.  Download this torrent

2.  Extract it to your desktop

3.  Run it as administrator (right click the Keygen and click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Run As Administrator\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"!

4.  Click the arrow just under the pic of DI And find \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sony Vegas Pro 10 (32 and 64 bit series), Then Click patch at the bottom of the keygen

5.  A little box with all of your files should appear

6. go to programme files (x86 if your 64 bit like me or just programme files if you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve got 32 bit) Note: if you saved it somewhere else when you downloaded the Vegas trial then go to the place you saved it.

7.  Click patch at the bottom of the box. Wait for a few seconds then go to where you saved vegas and double click it!

8. do your setup and when it asks you for a serial go back to your keygen press \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"generate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a few times then copy and paste the serial off the keygen to the sony vegas setup!

9.  This time dont press \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"generate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"... do the same for the authentication code.

10.  Your done, Simples.
