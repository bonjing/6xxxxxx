After puting my brain into the work, I realized that when I was attempting to patch Sony Vegas, the product name in the keygen window was ""Sound Forge 9.0 Series"" (the default one)..CHANGE THAT TO ""Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series"" BEFORE YOU START PATCHING!!

That should get the job done, at least here.
Good job, and nice torrent!"
