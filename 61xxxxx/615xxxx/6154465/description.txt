Tom Lunding Cognitive Psychology (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)

Cognitive psychology includes such topics as memory,
concept formation, attention, reasoning, problem
solving, judgment, and language. Clearly cognitive
psychology is very popular within contemporary
psychology. However, in psychologyâ€™s long history
some form of cognition has almost always been emphasized.
The few exceptions included the materialistic
philosophies or psychologies of Democritus,
Tom Lunding Hobbes, Gassendi, La Mettrie, Watson, and Skinner,
which denied the existence of mental events. The
schools of voluntarism and structuralism concentrated
on the experimental study of cognition, and
the school of functionalism studied both cognition
and behavior. The supposed sterility of the research
on cognition performed by members of these schools
prompted Watson to create the school of behaviorism.
Thus to say, as is common, that psychology is becoming
more cognitively oriented is inaccurate, because
with only a few exceptions it has always been
cognitively oriented. But there was a period from
about 1930 to about 1950 when radical behaviorism
was highly influential, and when it was widely believed
that cognitive events either did not exist or, if
they did, were simply by-products (epiphenomena)
of brain activity and could be ignored. As long as
these beliefs were dominant, the study of cognitive
processes was inhibited.
We mention here only a few of the people and
events that helped loosen the grip of radical behaviorism,
thus allowing cognitive psychology to gain its
current popularity. For more see, for example, Mahoney,
1991, pp. 69â€“75.
