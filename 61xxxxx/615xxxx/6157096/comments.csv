updated?"
,caspianseez,2011-02-18T20:20Z,"none of the cracks work.

the game uses UpLauncher to check the files even if you are offline. we need a way to BYPASS the UpLauncher and run the game just using the TDU 2 exe directly."
,theroni4,2011-02-18T22:32Z,"OK , i solve my problem.
1.Just turn off the router
2.Then run the uplauncher.exe
3.Dont press retry and run TestDrive2.exe"
,__D_R_I_Z__,2011-02-24T22:40Z,"I admire the skills of whoever Skidrow Ã nd Reloaded might be,
a little less the skills of people who upload their files in here,
because I doubt those are the same people, for legal issues and stuff.

Though, the people I don't admire are those who seem to feel joy in acting aggressive on people who need help and people who need help that don't take the effort of checking if their answer is nowhere to be found yet.

Now, I am proud to say I'm either of them.
But, I do need help.
My problem, thÃ t I have found with others to, but no solution so far.

1 To be clear: I did everything by the rules. If you want to check; here's what I did:
I did use the newest version of Daemon Tools. I did copy all the files when mounted to my C: drive. I have installed everything with the exact instructions that came with the Skidrow-files. I didn't let it run directly after. I did copy the crack to the installed files (which amazed me; it had the exact same size of the original exe, but anyway) I have blocked everything from the internet using Firewall. I rebooted to make sure. I did try first with the testdrive2.exe and later with the uplauncher.exe. Reinstalled, rebooted several times. I also just tried with this crack here, also claimed to be Skidrows, and again I noticed; all options, same size. It just doesn't work.

2 My exact problem has been mentioned as I said earlier in other comments:
when I try to launch anyhow, I get the same error with nothing but a red cross as some other people.
I want to be honest with my future helpers, so I'll admit I'm using a bit of an older laptop,
my windows 7 is a Pliek (but very good) copy :) and to see at the little stickers here, I have Intel Centrino Duo, my laptop was designed for XP but capable for Vista, and my graphic sign says nVidia Geforce'Go 7600.

So, I'll make 3 a bit of my conclusion:
Is anybody smart enough with computers, or hack once in a while, I don't really care, to assist me on this problem.

PS: I'm not British (nor boring for people who don't get the joke).

PS2: Excuse me for the long text :)"
