C++ For Dummies [5th Edition] by Stephen Randy Davis

"C++ For Dummies is an introduction to the C++ language. C++ For Dummies starts
from the beginning (where else?) and works its way from early concepts and
through more sophisticated techniques. It doesnâ€™t assume that you have any
prior knowledge, at least, not of programming.
C++ For Dummies is rife with examples. Every concept is documented in numerous
snippets and several complete programs.
Unlike other C++ programming books, C++ For Dummies considers the â€œwhyâ€
just as important as the â€œhow.â€ The features of C++ are like pieces of a jigsaw
puzzle. Rather than just present the features, I think itâ€™s important that you
understand how they fit together.
If you donâ€™t understand why a particular feature is in the language, you wonâ€™t
truly understand how it works. After you finish this book, youâ€™ll be able to write
a reasonable C++ program, and, just as important, youâ€™ll understand why and
how it works.
C++ For Dummies can also be used as a reference: If you want to understand
whatâ€™s going on with all the template stuff, just flip to Chapter 27, and youâ€™re
there. Each chapter contains necessary references to other earlier chapters
in case you donâ€™t read the chapters in sequence.
C++ For Dummies is not operating- or system-specific. It is just as useful to Unix
or Linux programmers as it is to Windows-based developers. C++ For Dummies
doesnâ€™t cover Windows or .NET programming. You have to master C++ before
you can move on to Windows and .NET programming."
