One of the best albums of all times, and I can't find a single mention anywhere regarding the HUGE difference between the original Tres Hombres studio cut and the post 1990 CD release of the ""remastered sounds like I'm in a toilet bowl"" version.  Could somebody please FLAC this album from the original LP??? Sorry about the noob rant but am I the only one in the world who gives a sh*t about this classic???  Audiophiles please comment!!!"
