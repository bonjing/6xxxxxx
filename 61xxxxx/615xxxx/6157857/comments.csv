,famemon78,2011-02-09T01:58Z,dude whats with your torrents?! im not being able to download a single one of them! could you pls. set your upload settings to unlimited?
,devrimCHE,2011-02-09T14:05Z,"famemon78, when I set the upload limit to unlimited, download limit decreases to nothing. what in fact happens is this: my upload limit is one eighth of my download limit. and most of my uploading goes to the files I'm already downloading. the problem (I have asked friends here) is probably to do with my internet server provider. You have any idea or suggestion. do you think trying to send a lot of files at a time can also be a problem?"
,famemon78,2011-02-10T02:20Z,I actually have the exact same situation in my country.. no doubt stopping downloads and dedicating ur connection to uploads will help. but what will help more is if you contact your internet service provider and ask them to increase your upload speeds. i did that with mine and surprisingly they increased it without too much hassle. ofcourse they wont make it as fast as your download speeds but they ll double or triple the u/l speed!
,devrimCHE,2011-02-12T11:05Z,"hey pal. they've already been announcing that download freaks like us are somehow due to be punished. don't know how and when, so it'd be unwise and somewhat telltale for me to call my internet provider. forget about it, man, Revolution in Egypt is much more exciting. I wish the whole world were permanetly Egypt, then we'd download the world in ecstacy, thus finding other fields to get freak about. greetings."
,devrimCHE,2011-02-12T12:05Z,"(silly me) and UPLOAD, of course.."
,devrimCHE,2011-03-19T22:25Z,"People going in for the movies I've uploaded, including those friends complaining about my speed (I guess I've answered them properly, without breaking hearts, hopefully), must be already finished. yet now new downloaders are on the line. Only if I delete these files, I'll be able to upload some more and still precious material. In three or four days's time I'll do this to upload different things. So be alert and seed these movies, please. with the restrictive rules of the country given can I see no other solution whatsoever. take care. Let there be a God and help the Japanese. "
,lunik1985,2012-03-07T17:50Z,"There is only one seeders left, and he seeds for a few minutes once a week. We are all stuck at 89.7%. In this rhythm I estimate I will download this movie in 2069, to celebrate 100 years from the making. Hurray !"
