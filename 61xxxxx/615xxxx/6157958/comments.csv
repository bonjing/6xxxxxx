[V],HolyRoses,2011-02-07T20:27Z,"play wow with me on molten, good time killer."
,holololo,2011-02-07T20:45Z,"NOooooooo.....why?
we will miss you?"
,pinkpetal,2011-02-07T21:02Z,"Awww OOO dang it! Well thanks, you rock. Hope you are successful in your future endeavors! "
,defeatedsanity,2011-02-07T21:54Z,"3xO, Don't quit! I will end up drinking a gallon of bleach if I don't have the movies that you provide so many of us.  "
[T],on.off.on,2011-02-07T21:56Z,@HolyRoses LOL 
,defeatedsanity,2011-02-07T21:58Z,"Also who are the fucking retards giving so many negative votes to 3xO's last couple uploads? The voting system is intended to be for quality of an upload, Not how much a movie blows. "
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-02-07T22:25Z,"3xO, i had a feeling you would have went after that link that ""TKOG11"" posted on your gullivers travel torrent, but please dont let that shit put you off!!! we will all miss your brilliant uploads  :-( "
,TKOG11,2011-02-07T22:56Z,"@yohohoandaBottleofRUM
why you blaming me for this?
@3xO
you will be missed good luck in the future, and i hope you decide to come back soon"
,themadhumper,2011-02-07T23:10Z,"You shall be sorely missed...

Come back soon...

~tmh"
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-02-07T23:27Z,"@TKOG11, im not blaming you, just saying that the content of that link probably put him off uploading"
[T],on.off.on,2011-02-07T23:55Z,oh wait.. i have one last thing to share... stay tuned.. heh
,TKOG11,2011-02-08T00:38Z,"@yohoho
why would it? im sure 3xO uses something in order to stay anonymous such as a proxy or something as is usually the case with major uploaders"
,castrojoshua89,2011-02-08T01:42Z,"no don't go!! ur like the best.. HolyRoses doesn't upload that much like you do.. can you wait for tangled, tron, and yogi bear... pls!!!"
,banukaknight,2011-02-08T02:24Z,"OOO is full of suprices :)

anyws.. can somebody seed for ""Who framed Roger Rabbit""... the OOO torrent"
,defeatedsanity,2011-02-08T04:28Z,"May I ask why you are leaving us? Don't have the time anymore? Too many unappreciative morons that either don't take the time to say thank you or seed your torrents? Morons who have been giving you negative votes of late? Not obtaining a green skull by now that you so justly deserve? Fear of copyright infringements? 

Of course you don't have to explain yourself to anyone, But many of your ""fans"" are just surprised that your leaving and wonder why after 350+ uploads in a rather short period of time you would stop so abruptly.

I, Myself would like to thank you for everything that you have provided us over time. Truly grateful and appreciative for everything you have done and I wish you the best of luck.  "
,Ataractic,2011-02-08T06:39Z,"Why, Why, Why? Please don't Go!"
[T],qwersd,2011-02-08T08:17Z,"really sad that u won't be uploading anymore...:(
thanxxx a lot for all the hard work that u put in...
hope that u might reconsider and return to uploading..."
,jimmyconway100,2011-02-08T13:00Z,"im  addicted to downloading films, but im not sure if i can bring myself to download a musical with cher and christina aguilera in it.  Im going to go out on a limb and say there is no nudity in it right? how come your leaving us on.off.on? you saved my horrible journeys to hoprrible jobs with your uploads???"
,pinkpetal,2011-02-08T17:12Z,"@jimmyconway100 Actually this movie isn't all that bad (I mean the movie itself, not the quality of ooo's up that's always excellent!). And since this is about Burlesque, it's a lot of tease.

@OOO Really, like I said before, you do some of the best work. I'm always happy to seed when I d/l something from you. *sigh* You're gonna be sooooo missed. "
,lakuli,2011-02-08T17:59Z,"Aloha, I'm new to all this but I think I'm lovin it.
OOO ... I have quite a collection of ur movies which are great quality movies so I was thinking if I wanted a certain one I'd ask the best. If its not much trouble I was wondering if u would please do some handhelds ....

1. Remember The Titans

,pinkpetal,2011-02-08T20:18Z,"@ lakuli & @ banukaknight DUDES, OOO has announced he's done and you're doing requests? Seriously? 

All right, I'm probably gonna get flamed for that but so what! You DO NOT request movies from someone who's decided he's done. You thank him and move on. "
,Nikonburn,2011-02-09T00:06Z,3x0 thanks for all the great uploads..sucks that you and moving on. if there is an easy way to explain how you get such great uploads can you share. I have messed around trying to figure it out but can never get the same quality..can get the size but never as good of picture. Any advice before you go would be awesome. thanks again for all the hard work
[T],on.off.on,2011-02-09T10:29Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6134512/Handbrake.Fast.guide.3xO

,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-02-09T18:59Z,"The ""Video>Handheld"" section just doesnt have the same appeal without 3xO   :-(

Come back soon mate we miss you..."
,lakuli,2011-02-09T22:45Z,"@Pinkpetal .... I don't know if ur blind, deaf, or dumb but I think I did mention that I'm new to all this stuff so I wouldn't know that he's done.
Although, I do respect the guy and I applaud him for his great work ... good luck OOO, wishing u luck at whatever ur doing and hope u come back."
,pinkpetal,2011-02-10T03:00Z,"@lakuli, nope I'm not blind. This is proven by the fact that I READ what ooo posted in the comment section. In fact it's the FIRST comment. It's called reading. It's fun, try it once. "

[T],The_Day_Walker,2011-02-18T19:52Z,"Hey guys and gals! I hope to be back in 4-5 weeks. I know i will be starting to upload stuff slowly. I will be seeding stuff from a zombie computer instead of a seedbox.  Anyway, I can't wait! In the meantime check out this person's stuff, takes requests -  http://thepiratebay.org/user/Evol_Gamer_428/ 

And try a few other people's stuff out, cuz we all started somewhere, we didn't start off as trusted, we had to work our way there so give these people a chance to be your trusted source for handheld encodes.
Also, I recently got a used iPod Touch 4G for $20 from a friend, i cleaned it myself (meaning it was hot), so now i can test stuff on the iPod Touch 4G before i upload it. "
