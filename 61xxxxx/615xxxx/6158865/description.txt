PLOT:
On the Christmas Eve in a small town, a stranger enters in the
precinct and tells the Desk Sergeant Gulloy that he had murdered
six people. Detective Alexander Black arrests the man in a cell
and Deputy Jerry Pine, Deputy Jane Hollow, Deputy Toby Sherwood
and Deputy Jack Hawkins are not able to identify him since the
stranger does not have fingerprints. They call him Mr. Nobody
and Deputy Hawkins recalls that he resembles the haired drifter
that they had arrested and tortured one year ago, when the
daughter of Detective Black had vanished. Along the night,
while Mr. Nobody confesses each murder and whistles Lacrimosa
from Mozart's Requiem, each deputy dies. Sooner Detective Black
discovers that Mr. Nobody is a revengeful spirit that has come
to kill them for what they did to the drifter one year ago and
they are doomed to die.
