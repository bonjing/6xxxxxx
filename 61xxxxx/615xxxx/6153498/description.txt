The Grass Roots
All Time Greatest Hits (1996)

The Grass Roots had a series of major hits -- most notably 'Let's Live for Today,' 'Midnight Confessions, 'Temptation Eyes,' and 'Two Divided by Love' -- that help define the essence of the era's best AM radio. Although the group's members weren't even close to being recognizable, and their in-house songwriting was next to irrelevant, the Grass Roots managed to chart 14 Top 40 hits, including seven gold singles and one platinum single, and two had hits collections that effortlessly went gold. The group's history is also fairly complicated, because there were at least three different groups involved in the making of the songs identified as being by 'the Grass Roots.'
