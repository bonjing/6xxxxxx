Red Mass for Mars is a 4 issue mini-series by Jonathan Hickman (with art by Ryan Bodenheim), published by Image Comics, between June 2008 - July 2010.

In "Red Mass for Mars," Hickman lashes out at the media, and at the corrupting systems at work in our world, but against a shockingly different backdrop. In this case, it's (mostly) the world of 2115, a specifically post-apocalyptic world in which radical climate change, mutating super-viruses, nuclear terrorists, and a nano-machine plague wiped out much of the Earth's population. And that was all before the alien invasion occurred.

It's a pretty good read IMHO.

I couldn't find any decent torrent for it (especially issue 04) on the internet, so decided to compile it and upload it. Hope it helps.

If you need any other comic book, mail me at traitorangel13@yahoo.com and I will upload it as soon as I can. 

Cheers,

PS: If you liked it, buy it. Support the industry. The CBRs are mainly for archival purposes and to preserve the state of the book, but should not be treated as a replacement. Just remember, you can read in on your computer only because someone like you decided to buy and scan the book.
