,jozsus,2011-02-14T18:13Z,"I am uploading this just as fast as I am downloading....  but I tried extracting one of the games ""FA 18 hornet"" and I can't seem to get the rars to make a single folder, or I can't seem to compile the individual rars into a coherent game.... even though I know it won't probably work on my 64bit.

Thanks for the awesome torrent... keep uploading and I will keep seeding"

,AvrgDy,2011-04-26T03:01Z,"What's the deal??? I downloaded just a couple of titles to try them out and have had issues with them all. For instance, a game that comes in a four part rar, you would think means it four separate disk images. Doesn't seem to be so, in fact they all contain the same data so why the need for four parts???  But even one of them isn't enough to install and run the game. Am I missing something? Although I know what I'm doing and I don't think I am, but could be wrong. Anyone, any ideas????"
,starygwizd,2011-04-26T11:40Z,Good Job!
,AvrgDy,2011-04-26T18:53Z,"I take it back about the games not working. Some of them don't work still, but most of them do, minus a few incompatibility issues and viruses, YES VIRUSES! However, the bit about pointless multiple parts, for certain games, still stands. From the games I've tried so far, every single one of them that came in parts didn't actually need those parts at all. Heretic 2, for example, comes in four rar files, or parts, whatever you want to call them. But each one of those rar files is identical in name, size and contents to the others within that game's group or parts! So really, only one of them is needed to install and run the game. Maybe the others are for backup, I don't know, but they're not needed for sure. Final Fantasy comes in 10 parts, I think it's 10 or thereabouts, and yet only one is needed!!! So, WTF are they all for??? Why all of the pointless and wasteful data, Mr.Uploadster (ymgve)? Something seems very odd. You could have uploaded the same collection of games for about a quarter of the size, what gives man? I also found a few viruses in the *.exe files on the disk images. Hope these were just careless accidents rather than intentional attacks my friend. Heretic2.exe, for example, is one of the files containing a level 4 virus (pretty harmful virus), and it's not because of any key-gens either. It could be something similar though, I'm just not sure. Just be careful my brothers and sisters, simply a friendly warning. Let me know if anyone has found the same puzzling aspects to this torrent, please guys. Despite all said and done, I think you put allot of hard work and time into this torrent and for your efforts I'm so very very grateful. I truly am !!! This is THE BEST collection of classic to fairly recent games on the net EVER !!! AWESOME JOB !!! It really must have taken you quite some time to put this lot together within one torrent. Thankyou for all the fun we are all going to have with these games. Peace all and VAST VAST VAST RESPECT !!!"
,AvrgDy,2011-05-15T16:35Z,"Just ignore me. I'm a total fucking IDIOT! This torrent RULES and so does the uploader and all the guys and gals sharing it. There is nothing wrong with any of the files (ok maybe the odd one or two) but that's all. As always, I speak before I think. I believe I know a lot when in fact I know nothing and in fact I'm still learning. My deepest apologies to all concerned regarding some of the things I said in my other comments. I should learn to shut the hell up, but I won't and instead will continue to make a fool of myself. Peace all!"
,LarsLaur,2011-09-08T21:47Z,"For future reference and to uploaders... Compressing a file two or more times do NOT make it smaller as some uploaders seem to think.
Alsoo for crying out loud, do fit them into a single ISO, what you risk people doing is extracting what they need, then they DELETE the parts and stop seeding the torrent to conserve disk space...

So provide a simple ISO or a single rar / zip / ace or whatever."
,Oldiesel,2012-04-26T04:02Z,"Those who start the download, same as not complete, seed 1 copy for have seeders ..."
