A fantastic story, published in the Dutch Masonic journal Thoth http://www.ritusentempelbouw.nl/tijdschriftthoth January 2011. The title was: â€œWhy came Hiram Abiff from abroadâ€. For the general public entitled 'The Future of Language'. 
The quest begins with the ancient Hebrew, a language where the verb is central. David Bohm: Rheomode â€“ Wim van der Horst: Technomode. By Socrates, Plato and Aristotle who changed the Greek language, we come to Alexander the Great who practiced the last change in the Greek language learned from Aristotle, and therefore able to think logically. The rise of Alexandria, the decline of Athens and the development of the Latin language. 
All this is a brain process. The virtual movement. The origin of language. 
The 'language body'. 
CONSCIOUSNESS should be replaced by the verb 'TO CONSCIOUS'. 
The future of language in the hands of a bunch of rebellious youth?
