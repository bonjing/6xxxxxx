,pracso,2011-03-01T03:16Z,Sorry.... im computer illiterate and new to TPB. How do you just download the sample? I use Vuze.
,Sharan,2011-03-01T05:23Z,"@pracso: I don't use Vuze, but it should be easy enough. When you try to save the torrent file, you'll get a display of the complete list of files, along with check boxes to select which ones you actually want to download. 

You can then probably go about it in two ways: 

1. There may be somewhere in that interface that you can set the priority order (download order) for downloading the files (check the menu in that window). Set the highest priority for the ""sample"" file. Going by the file sizes, it should be done when the total download has reached about 1.5%. Or, you'll just have to look inside the download folder once in a while. 

2. You can select only the sample file in the download list for downloading (uncheck the other files) and then click ""Save"". When it's done, the torrent will show 100% completed. After you've viewed the sample, if you like it you can bring up that same ""Save"" list again (probably by right-clicking on the file shown in the download window in Vuze, and selecting ""properties"" or ""settings"" or something like that); the full file list should be displayed again, and you can then select the rest of the files to download.

BTW, I checked the sample. The quality is good. "

,gregsir,2011-03-06T03:25Z,"So i looked forward to watching this with the 6 channels surround and it was a let down.
Don't know if my old Technics surround sound hifi is kicking the bucket but it has never suffered this much so i am blaming the copy.

Very bad background thinny loud like a swimming pool echoey sound? 
Up to 45 mins in i was still contemplating packing it in and i am sorry i didn't,i spent the first 30 mins adjusting the audio setting on the tv and hifi but nothing gave.
I turned off the surround in the end which helped.

For me V8 A5."
,Georgie21,2011-03-12T21:16Z,I love how people have the nerve to complain about something they didn't pay for. The video is great quality and well worth the download.
