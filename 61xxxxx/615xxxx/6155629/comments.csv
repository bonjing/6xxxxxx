,SimGameIt,2011-02-06T23:27Z,"A torrent in itself doesnt take up much bandwith. Its essentially just like a small text file. Our website is seeding the files so any bandwith hit will be taken by our website. 

And yea i remember you. Hope you have been doing good man. Im doing this to get us out there again. Were going to be doing more stuff soon and we are awaiting Microsoft Flight to work with it. For now weve been blowing shit up in Bad Company 2. LoL"
,Armagedonn,2011-02-07T13:35Z,"I haven't played battlefield since desert combat (it was an expansion for bf 1942,you probably knew that,but just in case) and the only multiplayer shooter i play is call of duty 4.

And for your future projects,if you need any assistance,I don't do flight dynamics any more,but i am a descent photoshop expert,and would be glad to help you guys out.Also,it goes without saying,If you need any FS files that are payware but don't feel like spending money,feel free to ask. "

,VaticanCity,2011-02-14T00:41Z,the man hes sells shit.you bought it.And now you reape.   Idiots.
,SimGameIt,2011-02-14T17:56Z,"VaticanCity your a moron! First off we arent a company and we dont sell anything.

Hell you werent even bright enough to read the description.

Its simple, some people love what we do, others dont. To each their own. I love the real stuff. Hell i fly FAR103 in real life and own a American Aerolite Falcon UL. But sometimes i like to just have fun. Thats what these planes are modified for. I didnt make them i just repainted them and configured them to fly different."
,jimbob43,2011-02-15T06:05Z,If B.S.was music this guy would be a brass band!!
,SimGameIt,2011-02-15T19:00Z,"Jimbo...Before you go back out to fuck the sheep go to youtube and search for Flying Video HD 9-18-2010. Tell me again im full of shit. You cant back up your claims but i can back mine up. So who is full of shit? Dumbass!
Thats not my plane im flying but im flying a friends plane until mine is finished being restored. Whats funny is my plane will be available soon as a bonus download for the payware American Aerolites Falcon. Look just leave me the hell alone and i wont prove you to be an idiotic liar over and over again."

,SimGameIt,2011-02-23T20:39Z,"raven why do you guys try so so hard? All these years you morons have failed. I know they say try try again but you guys are just born losers. Just cause i was the original one with the ideas of modding the aircraft some of you get all bent out of shape. Look, go back to your mom and dads basement (your bedroom) and use your energy to come up with something yourself. But quit hating others cause of the knowledge and ability they have. Better yet say your shit to me face to face so i can see the look you give when i knock you on your ass! Harrassing someone on the internet shows how much of a pussy you really are!!!"
,SimGameIt,2011-02-23T20:43Z,BTW raven in the US we call that video a joke. And i know of countless people that visit that video for a good laugh from time to time. Myself included. Again your cutting on someone else for coming up with something original on their own. Your a big man over the net. Pussy!
