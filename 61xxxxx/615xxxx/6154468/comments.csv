This shouldnt be in the hi-rez category section at all!

please move it so people dont get as upset as me.

I apreciate your effort that you upload, but dont dare call this a hi rez movie.   Its really REALLY not."

,karakorama,2011-02-07T18:20Z,"Thanks, but the image is very bad, not High res."
,_DvD_,2011-02-07T21:49Z,"Dude, no offense, I do appreciate the fact you have taken the time to upload this. But people look in the Hi-Res section to get some quality picture and sound. This stuff just doesnt cut it. 

It's like putting golden sprinkles on a turd. It may look a bit better, but its still crap, right?"
