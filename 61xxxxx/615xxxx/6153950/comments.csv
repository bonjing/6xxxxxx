,dajman311,2011-02-10T01:31Z,"I made it very clear that this torrent needed to be seeded after it was done. Not a single person after 30 gigs of UL bothered to seed it back. Therefore, I've taken the tracker offline. 

You all had your chance, and you blew it."
,silverkor,2011-03-13T17:10Z,"Humm... Your generosity seems restricted to 4 days (and 30gb) hehe! Just joking! :P

I wish I could have been passing by during this period to download it completely and begin to seed it.

BTW, ""Not a single person after 30 gigs of UL bothered to seed it back."". So 30gb/5.5gb = 5.5 persons... that's a pretty low amount of people, and this may be even lower since some new comers could have tried to get it. See, I've reached up to 68.8% from it with these ""leechers"". 

About this, are you sure that anybody had been enable to download it entirely to seed it correctly? You know, if you had around 8-10 people on it at the same time, maybe no one had the chance to have completed it.

Thanks anyway for the simfiles.
If you feel for it, maybe just a little seeding for a day or two would help to make sure that at least one from us have all of it. ;)

Tell me if you plan to make this since my PC isn't always opened 24 hours a day. I'd be glad to seed it!

Thanks again!"
,dajman311,2011-04-21T05:59Z,"If I get the chance to reupload it, I will. It was difficult to keep it running 24/7 anyway. But I'll compile 'em again and put it back up."
,silverkor,2011-04-22T15:08Z,"That's wonderful to hear!
I've seen a lot of people out a 16 leechers stuck at 68.8%.. Including me :P

Thanks a lot for all the effort you made for the simfiles and the seeding, it's really appreciated!!

I'll do my best to seed it once I'll get it all!"
,KyoKaito,2011-06-08T06:07Z,"I'm seeding what I have and stuck at 68.8%... Come on guys, I need some files for Stepmania here, Let's get to seeding"
,KyoKaito,2011-06-08T06:26Z,Nevermind. Finally got around to reading all of the comments... Ejecting. Peace
,blkwngdangel,2011-06-11T19:17Z,4 months after this torrent was uploaded there are still leechers uploading the 68.8% worth of files they got.  Maybe give these people another chance?
,silverkor,2011-06-12T03:09Z,"It's great to see that this got more interest. I belive this may become useful for seeding correctly this time since the 1st attempt seemed a bit too fast on a short period of time...

Dajman311, let us know once you're ready or please inform us if you create another torrent.
Thanks again for your generosity! :)"

,d124c0,2012-01-01T18:02Z,Also after going through it the folder of ITG and ITG2 are identical.  So this pack contains no ITG2 songs
