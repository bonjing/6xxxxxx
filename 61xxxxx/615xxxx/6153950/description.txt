I noticed that there are no collections of every DDR and ITG simfiles for Stepmania, so after collecting them over the last couple of hours, I've released them back into the public. This set contains every song from the Arcade versions of DDR mixes 1-6, MAX 1 and 2, Supernova 1 and 2, and Extreme (I'm missing X), the Arcade versions of In The Groove (ITG) 1, 2, and Rebirth, the Xbox series DDR Ultramix 1-4, the Xbox 360 series DDR Universe 1-3 plus DLC, the PS3 version of DDR plus DLC, and the Wii versions of DDR Hottest Party 1-3 and DDR Disney Grooves. I haven't had a chance to test every song, as the collection has 1209 songs in total, but as long as Stepmania is set up properly, these should all work just fine.

To install, you can simply copy the entire Songs folder over the original Songs folder in the \Stepmania directory, or drag and drop by folder.

If something doesn't work properly, let me know. AND PLEASE SEED. These can't work unless they get shared out, people, and I've never seen a more complete collection of these.
