[T],metalcore.,2011-02-06T15:59Z,"the concept of ""God"" is not a logical concept, you cannot use logical rationale to explain nor prove the existence of God, ignorant Christians perpetuating their indocrinated BULLSHIT. ill watch for a GOOD LAUGH!!! "
,jiveclive,2011-02-06T21:11Z,"I gotta conced that the first sentence is a good opener.

""A Theologian presents a logical explanation on how to think through the logic that proves unequivocally that there is only one God who is the source of everything in reality.""

Use of ""unequivocally"" is especially compelling. So I decide to suspend all disbelief and keep reading. . .  

That's how I come to find out that  ""If you deny Gods existence then this video is not for you.""

Now that's just funny right there, because what's the need for proving to me unequivocally what I aleardy know? There's not a pinprick worth of logic in that at all. Zilch. Zip. Nada. Diddlysquat. 

But I  keep on reading on, thinking that maybe the halfwit that wrote up til now will become a wholewit soon enough and redeem itself by making no more self-contradictiory assertions or maybe it will cease and desist from using words like ""logic"" when it clearly needs to get itself a clue or two. 

But that was not to be. Instead I get fallacy, which is but the counterfeit of logic. Fer instance, this five watts of the counterfeit of brilliance writes 
""the majority of Americans accept as self-evident truth"" that's not an argument. What the majority of people  think about anything is not of itself relevent to this discussion at all. It's just fallacious to appeal to vox populi. Thats how you argue your position when you are nine. By the time you are fifteen,  that tripe is well behind you. Well, it ought to be. And for sure, if you gonna bandy about words like ""proof"" ""logic,"" you should have your act well together or you will rot in the hell of arrested development."
[T],timelyone,2011-02-07T02:21Z,"Of course God is a logical concept. Just because you say what you say doesn't lend any credibility to people that try to prove that the person of God does not exist. The fact that you ""conceptualize"" God makes it worth of logical examination within its conceptualization. Read my article about my way of prooving God's existence in the description of the video above these comments."
[T],timelyone,2011-02-07T02:34Z,to jiveclive: Whew! You like to tell yourself so much negativity that you will be hard pressed to think clearly. Applying your concept of logical thinking to my way of thinking prevents your mind from expanding to the real way of understanding through meditation. You need to smoke some marijuana and get your endocannabinoid system up to full functionality which will relieve your unhappiness. Then you will be capable of thinking without bias. Be happy and you will be well.
[T],timelyone,2011-02-07T02:43Z,"The reason that I say ""If you deny God's existence then this video is not for you."" is because I don't want to try to prove the existence of God to someone in denial. Why bother? I believe this video is good for people who know God exists but can't explain it to themselves. I am offering explanations for people who are looking for them."
,dsafjaly69,2011-02-07T14:39Z,"To anyone looking for a real scientific look into ""God"" I recommend you watch the premier episode of the documentary ""Through The Wormhole"" (episode one: Is there a creator?) narrated by Morgan Freeman."
,jiveclive,2011-02-07T17:46Z,"Yeah, I'm real negative because i point out the unequivocal lack of sense in your own assertions. 

That makes me a terrible, unhappy person, because I use my god-given brain to be amused by you. 

Dude, you are amusing. It's your gift. Embrace it, man. Who knows, you could become God's court-jester. That's not a bad thing. Seriously. "
[T],timelyone,2011-02-07T20:17Z,"To JIVECLIVE: At least you admit God when you say ""I use my god-given brain to be amused by you."" I like the idea of being God's court jester. The only message that I have from God for everyone is what I heard Him say one time - ""Be happy and you will be well."" I'm more interested in proving that the true God has only one attitude towards us and that is love. The God of heaven and hell is the barbaric imagination of the Jewish mind. Christianity unfortunately brought Mosaic Law over into itself when it should have rejected it completely. The true God is revealed in the Declaration of Independence as the one who creates us equal to Him and endows us with unalienable rights of Liberty. There are no 10 commandments to interfere with freedom. That's God and I get high with him all of the time - and I always stay happy - ready to laugh and expand happiness wherever I am. I wish everyone would be happy and get out of my way as I live my freedom."
[T],timelyone,2011-02-25T01:54Z,For those who believe there is no explanation necessary and for thowe who do not believe there is nop explanation possible.
[T],timelyone,2011-02-25T01:55Z,yes
