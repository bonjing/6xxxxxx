,pigslookfunny,2011-02-07T06:58Z,Can't wait til next week.
,fcalen,2011-02-07T09:51Z,l am so tired ...
,shdwolf1,2011-02-07T13:30Z,"ok, had to be better than last set. But, doesn't this look like an older set, maybe from a year or two ago? She doesn't look as mature, or defined in face/body...maybe just me..."
,mnamna,2011-02-07T14:10Z,This set was boring.
,Duper167,2011-02-07T15:08Z,"I agree with shdwolf1.  There was something about this set that just screamed ""Two years ago"".  I'm hard pressed to believe that the F-G site still has paying customers at this point.  Who would pay for this crap?"
,cult22,2011-02-07T17:25Z,I don't no if they do a mistake for next week but i remember this set...or maybe they try to fool us
,starbug17,2011-02-07T18:26Z,where do I find the preview for next weeks set? is it on the famegirls site?
,polarbear2000,2011-02-07T19:14Z,Previews of the next sets: http://www.imagebam.com/gallery/wbxp1zo25cj7nozeaw9b8c496wep4swn/
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-02-08T02:30Z,"All the FG sets I upload come with a preview for the next weeks set.

For the person who gives me a -1 quality all the time... I do not take the pictures. I do not know the models. I do not decide what the models wear. There is no reason to downgrade my efforts because you do not like the set.

Every week I upload all 3 models here on TPB. Usually within the first 15 to 30 minutes of the set being released. Meaning, I have a membership. I do not have to upload these sets. Least you can do is show some appreciation."
,davidhot,2011-02-08T02:54Z,"webmodelsindex you're the man :)
Thanks!!!
Keep up the good work"
,PlightOfTheInnovators,2011-02-08T03:54Z,I dont know why WMI bothers his arse to up these because all most people do on here his moan about the sets he`s just put up....come on people...your getting BRAND NEW sets the second it comes out! If I was you WMI I`d tell em all to get fucked...(not including the grateful ones of course!)
,shdwolf1,2011-02-08T04:49Z,"WMI...In no way is any negative gripe about the photos directed at you. We're very grateful for the effort and work involved with posting the sets you do. I guess we need to stop and show our appreciation a little more diligently, as a well meaning comment left unspoken benefits neither the giver or the receiver...Thx"
,Rigel71,2011-02-08T05:42Z,"+1, thanks!"
,greaver1,2011-02-08T07:23Z,"Thanks WMI, most of us really appreciate your uploads."
,33wearhilton41,2011-02-08T23:47Z,keep up the good work wsi
,tommy69lvr,2011-02-09T03:08Z,"I like Sandra, but she really is showing less and less skin these days.  Personally, I'm ready to see her do porn.  I don't think she is gonna make it as a legit fashion model.  "
,??abletaste,2011-02-13T23:46Z,I'm with Tommy.  Time for ol Sandra to do the XXX scene.
