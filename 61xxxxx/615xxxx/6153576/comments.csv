The Windows version is supposed to be released in about 1-2 days (As of Feb. 5):   http://thetechjournal.com/electronics/iphone/greenpois0n-rc5-for-windows-releasing-within-2-daysconfirmed.xhtml

So download this at your own risk. "

,The-Duck,2011-02-06T13:06Z,"Just to clear the confusion:
I downloaded this from the greenpois0n.com site and uploaded here 2mins later.
this is just for people who can't reach the main/mirrored sites

Enjoy"
