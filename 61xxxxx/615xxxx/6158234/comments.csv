,PauloFran,2011-10-12T19:53Z,"High video quality for the file size.
Excellent movie!"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-10-23T12:21Z,"I'm not sure how i would rate this...
I don't usually download 700mb files, and its been a while since i have...

Overall i say its decent, but the image seems to sharp, and seems to move quite roughly. 

so, for a 700mb file, i give it
video - 6
a- 9

Smaller res and better bitrate would have been better. "
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-10-23T14:24Z,"Changed my mind.
This looked very good on 1920x1080, 42 inch plasma.
On this laptop it seemed off... even though this laptop was connected to the plasma at the time.

So disregard before, though still slightly low bitrate...
I give, for size,
v : 9.3
a : 8

Good release."

,mikey_51,2012-05-07T23:54Z,"Get torrent, downloaded in about 10 minutes, if that.
Its just a shame it was compressed so much, if they have just made it 720p or just before and the file size to around 1-1.5gb it would have been perfect!"

,Cerebral222,2012-06-06T13:17Z,"Thanks uploader, a 9 all round, +1 from me, cheers."
