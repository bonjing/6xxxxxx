,DTHSECA,2011-02-06T05:16Z,does not even work can't install ask's for bin files thats got in the iso but you have to mount them still no go so dont bother downloading this one
,norttikasa,2011-02-07T11:01Z,"DTHSECA and other folks

The installer will not work. The douche that uploaded this renamed the setup files and they will not work with the setup.exe. Because I'm a stingy bastard and can't be bothered downloading the other one I fixed it myself. First extract the files with 7-Zip, then rename the setup-1.bin files to Mafia2-1.bin, Mafia2-2.bin, etc. You need to download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3917782/Magic_ISO_Maker_5.4_with_serial from there to be able to repack the ISO. Pretty self-explanatory. "

,tristanguy,2011-02-22T01:09Z,"@txhellion You use magic ISO and delete the current setup.bins in there, and then drag the newly named ones in, this will take a while to do and use your hard drive at max capacity. But better than redownloading the game."
