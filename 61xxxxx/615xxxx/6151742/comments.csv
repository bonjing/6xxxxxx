,PLnet,2011-02-13T22:14Z,"Uh oh. I've seen a lot of BSODs in my live, but never one in Windows setup! :) this one throws out a BSOD when trying to access partition table. And since I've got HP PC, I think the HP DVD you used for this was really, really old :)"
,SanctusSecurity,2011-02-14T06:14Z,"I have installed this copy on several computers, and never came across a BSOD. Has anyone else came across this problem?"
,roverens,2011-03-02T15:39Z,"Good idea, but youve removed too much. Keyboard layouts is one thing, so non-US/UK keyboards dont work properly. Even worse is that the driver for the MCE keyboard (which uses the same IR reciver as the MCE remote) is gone."
,superstar909,2011-03-04T09:05Z,"I downloaded this and mounted the iso to a cd . I went through the install and once it was done my computer restarted then went to a blue screen saying that ""To prevent damage to the computer windows has shut down if this is the first time it happened to restart and try again. It also gave other suggestions to check pc for viruses, run the disk check for errors,etc....so this didnt work out for me. Any help would be grateful????"
,Archie2821,2011-03-06T04:23Z,I installed this and I cannot find windows media center. Any help would be great.
,jtwg,2011-03-12T05:26Z,"hey @PLnet the only time i came across a BSOD during install was when the RAM was faulty, i recommend you try memtest86 to be sure (:"

,nithin862001,2011-04-11T09:43Z,this doesn't work. Don't seed.
,HK88,2011-04-24T14:06Z,So I installed it left the disc in for ages after and its still says 30 day trial period under activation status. I then tried using the manual activation following the instructions below however when I open the NEXUS.BAT file a message says that its already installed? any ideas?
,squ4SH,2011-09-03T12:25Z,How come all these Media Center Edition torrents are different size?! Can't you faggots upload a virusfree version!?
,Monthar,2011-10-24T08:36Z,This does not work with a Dell XPS 400 with a SATA hard drive. It says no drives found. I tried this with both a new SATA drive and the one that came with the computer and already had MC edition installed.
,mike18xx2,2012-04-25T03:20Z,"FIRST RULE OF WINDOWS XP CD ""BUILDS"":

-- If they don't support ""repair-install"", then they are:

SHIT.

Why? A clean-install of XP is the biggest fucking pain in the ass if you have anything newer than a Pentium III, because you'll be missing half the drivers, and it'll be a goddamn chore to hunt all the fuckers down.

And every uploader who doesn't say whether repair-install is supported needs to be punched in the head until he shapes up.

(Been looking, for years, for a clear repair-install capable CD of Media Center which does NOT demand a serial half-way through.)"
,hammy434,2012-06-10T00:39Z,"this works on virtual box, tried it on my 1 and a half year old laptop, didnt work, my friend has a old computer lying around (has a vista sticker on it so not too old) and that didnt work either. i have tried changing my laptops bios sata mode from ahci to ide. that was the first thing i did, that seemed to work, then i installed it... it got stuck at 'saving settings' with 3 minutes to go, stayed there for about half an hour so i turned it off, tried to boot from the existing hdd to resume setup, didnt work, reinstalled twice, it came up with an error. then my friend tried it on his computer and after we rebooted it after formatting and copying files on the hard drive, the message 'failed to load operating system' happened. did some googleing and found it was a hdd problem. tried to change his sata mode to ide but we couldn't find it, but we found something to do with sata (sounded similar to mine) and we switched it off, tried again... still nothing. then we did some other stuff and his computer instantly bsod'd and no hard drives showed in the list on setup. then we put everything back and tried once more... still nothing, he couldn't get his partition with windows 7 to work either, lucky it was his old crappy computer and not his new one..."
