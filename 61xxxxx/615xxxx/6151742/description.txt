Product: Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 (SP2)
OS Platform: (x86) (32 Bit)
Size: 580 MB
Setup Type: OS Install
Language: English
Service Pack: SP2





Your Computer Must Meet These Requirements To Run Windows XP...


    300 MHz Processor
    128MB RAM
    1.5GB Available Hard Drive Space
    CD-ROM Drive




Product Key:  HYHV7-W343F-9TCCK-JPCBM-B2FQ8




During the first part of setup, it will say "Microsoft Windows XP Professional". This is normal, and it will install Media Center Edition 2005.

SATA drivers have been integrated into this copy, so you should have no issues installing to a SATA hard drive (HDD) or solid state drive (SDD).

This copy of Windows XP uses a very special method of activation. It tricks the computer into thinking it has booted in safe mode (when it really has not), therefore skipping product activation at log on. It loads the product key into the Windows files, making your computer forever genuine. The best part is that you can continue to use Windows Update with no worries of an update overwriting the patch.



IMPORTANT NOTE: You must leave the installation disc in the disc drive until 2 minutes after your first user log in. Otherwise, this copy will not be activated. Be sure to check your activation status after you have logged in, and if it has not activated, browse to the folder on the installation disc named "APPLICATIONS" , go to the folder "Activation", then "Manual Activation", and open the file "Active Nexus 1.0.bat".



The disc is in ISO (Disc Image) format, so you will need to use a program that burns ISO files. You can use nLite (http://www.nliteos.com/), or some other disc image burner such as Nero.

The disc image we modified before we integrated drivers and updates was ripped from an original HP OEM re-installation disc. If you have any issues installing, please leave a comment. 


The original installation disc was 748MB, and you therefore had to burn it to a DVD disc, wasting valuable space on the DVD disc. We have removed some features that are rarely used to make this ISO small enough to burn to a CD-R or CD-RW disc. Below are the features we removed....




Applications

  - Internet Games
  - Pinball
  - Default Screensavers
  - Clipbook Viewer


Drivers

  - Logitech WingMan
  - Modems
  - Printers (You Can Install Your Own Driver)
  - Scanners (You Can Install Your Own Driver)


Hardware Support

  - Iomega Zip Drive


Multimedia

  - Music Samples
  - Old "CD Player" And "Sound Recorder"
  - Speech Support (You Can Download This Software)


Network

  - MSN Explorer


Operating System Options

  - Search Assistant (The Annoying Dog In Windows Search)
  - Windows Your


Services

  - Indexing Service






VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: During installation, it will ask you for to enter a password for the administrator account. There will be some text already in the box (unmasked, it is "zx132"). ERASE ALL THE TEXT IN BOTH BOXES and continue installing without a password for the administrator account!






If for some reason, you cannot install because setup tells you that you are using an incorect product key, one fix is to download and install nLite, and use it to change the itegrated product key. That should fix the problem. 


TEST THIS IN VIRTUALBOX OR OTHER VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE BEFORE YOU BURN THIS ISO TO A DISC


Please seed!
