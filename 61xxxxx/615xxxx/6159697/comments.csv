,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-02-09T13:56Z,@Psycho: thank you for smoking matey! ;)
,PsychoLogic,2011-02-10T07:54Z,"As soon as a good source for Thank you for Smoking is available I will do it.  I don't consider a HDTV source to be good (The same reason I haven't uploaded my 720p Indiana Jones rips).

I did give links to an x264 rip in a previous thread, here it is again. http://www.capa.me/hdtv/31032-zdes-kurjat-thank-you-for-smoking-2005-hdtvrip.html and http://www.freshwap.net/forums/hddvd-bluray/1546736-thank-you-smoking-2005-720p.html#post1693071"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-02-12T17:26Z,Those links download RAR files which are password protected :(
,PsychoLogic,2011-02-15T16:56Z,"Lame.  Can't find a password for it anywhere.  Try here: h*t*t*p*:*/*/*l*e*t*i*t*b*i*t*.*n*e*t*/*d*o*w*n*l*o*a*d*/*e*7*7*6*1*c*8*0*2*1*7*7*/*Z*d*e*s*.*k*u*r*j*a*t*.*H*D*T*V*.*1*2*8*0*x*7*2*0*.*x*2*6*4*.*A*C*3*.*R*u*s*.*E*n*g*.*S*r*t*.*R*u*s*.*E*n*g*.*m*k*v*.*h*t*m*l for no rar (remove asterixes, tpb doesn't like the link)."
