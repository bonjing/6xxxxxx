In a press release, NIS America revealed the box art for the UMD release of Prinny 2 -- confirming that, yes, the publisher is bravely going ahead with the name "Dawn of Operation Panties, Dood!" Had it been us, we'd have changed all the panties to sandwiches. See the box art after the break. More importantly, NIS also revealed that Prinny 2 will feature a new, easier difficulty called "Baby," for people who thought the first Prinny game was too hard. In other words, people. How many other games give you 1,000 lives right from the start, knowing that won't help?
