,light420,2011-04-26T13:21Z,works fine
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2011-05-20T12:28Z,"I have a vista 64 bit system and none of the themes are working. The program is often unresponsive and crashes when I try to switch back to vista aero. I do this because none of the styles work. They simply force the style to look like it was in default 1995 windows mode. Blech. Not why I downloaded this. It's actually the opposite.

Cracking was fairly easy, but I guess I need to bypass a few more of the security protocols infused in this great OS of mine in order to be able to have new skins."
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2011-05-24T11:50Z,"This also won't uninstall. Great job. Thanks for the hastle. Next time you have a program that you want to upload how about you test it fully before doing so. Now im off to do a forced uninstall. ""tested to ensure it works with windows vista"" LOL. Not compatible."
,yegarboy,2011-06-05T08:49Z,"Just curious..AVG has flagged ""The Enhanced Patcher"" as a trojan. Should i be concerned? Or is this a false positive due to the nature of the program? "
,00jaxx0,2011-06-15T01:58Z,"Most of themes are way too old for Vista and 7.
So... U better find them."
