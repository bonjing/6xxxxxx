* TIME : 01h32m54s * VIDEO : XVID * ~ 1060 bitrate * SMART BRIGHTNESS applied by Dub plugins 1.9.10


* FILE ANALYSIS : the original video file used was too dark and a little bit from the end missing , unfornatly i searched everywhere but the end still like that but about the darkness i get with the correct plugins about 10 to 15% more light on the picture and with that a little bit more enjoyable screenplay , i hope all of you like . Cheers .
