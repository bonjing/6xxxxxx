Michael Kovak, disillusioned with his father and home life, decides to enter a seminary school and abdicate his vows upon completion, thereby getting him a free college degree. Four years pass and Michael is being ordained to the diaconate at the seminary. However, after ordination he writes a letter of resignation to his Father Superior, citing a lack of faith.
While the Father Superior is attempting to catch Michael on the street, he trips, causing a biker to swerve into the path of an oncoming car. The young woman, believing Michael to be a priest after seeing his clerical garb, asks him for absolution. Unable to refuse, Michael comforts her and performs the ritual absolving her sins. Seeing how calmly he handled the situation, Father Superior tells Michael he is called to be a priest, whether Michael believes this or not; he later approaches Michael with an invitation to travel to Rome in order to attend a class on exorcism. Michael reluctantly accepts after being told by Father Superior that he will be levied a $100,000 student loan if he leaves immediately, but that if he still desires to resign from his position after taking the class, then he will be free to leave.

,Feetback,2011-02-05T03:12Z,"A/V3 - This Same Bloody Bad Copy is been floating around  for a while,  just be Patient & wait a Little more for a Good Qualities Available out soon somewhere, otherwise it will really spoils the whole damn moods of this excellent great movie "
[V],globeplus,2011-02-05T07:17Z,"To feetback : youÂ´re right and i said it very clearly on the description , my intention was find out the little bit from the end and glue him to the rest of the picture bit i didnÂ´t find it anywhere and i certainly agree with you with watching in a new copy with everything ok but that can happen in a kind of undefined time and you certainly want to watch , my last observation is that beside that i agree with this point of view to a new copy with everything ok i am still saying too that comparing to the other cam around this one have 10 to 15% more light on the picture giving a little bit more enjoyable view , the best possible of course to get for the moment under the circunstances .

Cheers ."

Here are some periods for the next comment you type..........................................  Please use them."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-05T15:06Z,"To some-young-guy : you don´t know for an instant where is possible to watch the little bit from the end of this movie , don´t you ............................... ?!!!"
,5amjr,2011-02-05T16:10Z,"globe who taught you fukin english?
I have no idea what the fuck your 'kings speech impersonation' above was about!!! lol

Here's my translation of globes comment : Sorry everyone but this is the same unwatchable shit as the rest.!!"
,J-Squatch,2011-02-05T21:31Z,dear all those twats who think they are cool. grow the hell up. Globe I'm a huge fan of yours and you did the best you could as anyone would expect from you. Although the ending is missing this is currently the only version available and the best by far. If you don't like it STFU and wait for a version complete with ending and I'm sure Globe will have it as soon as possible. Thanks for all your hardwork bro
,5amjr,2011-02-06T09:03Z,"squatch take his little minority cock out of your mouth!
Why congratulate and thank someone for uploading an unwatchable file? If that's the case y not thank all the fakers too as you cannot watch theirs either!

It just seems weird to me why a guy would upload a clearly unwatchable file and you want to give him thumbs up for his ""Hard work "".
He's a repeat offender"
[V],globeplus,2011-02-06T22:57Z,"To 5amjr : I WANT YOU TO RESPECT THE OTHER ISERS AND THAT RIGHT NOW , GOT IT ? IF YOU SPEAK LIKE THAT AGAIN YOU WILL GET PROBLEMS , STOP ACTING LIKE A MORRON AND DOWNLOAD THE FILES IF YOU WANT BUT ABOVE OF ALL THIS IS FRIENDLY COMMUNITY SHARING NOT A DISRECPECTING CIRCUS WHERE THE USERS COME HERE TO INSULT EACH OTHERS , GOT IT ? BE DECENT !!!"
,5amjr,2011-02-08T08:03Z,"Please stop with the "" GOT IT "" as the only person who is frightened by your comment is your English teacher!

This is a friendly community and the comments are there to help downloaders make an informed choice of whether a file is worth downloading and this like a few of your others is not.
The day you upload a file which isn't someone one elses with the brightness changed i will thank you as i've thanked many others.

The spellings actually MORON dumbass ( future reference). lmao"
[V],globeplus,2011-02-08T13:06Z,"To 5amjr : NO ONE CALL YOU TO THIS COMMENTS AND START BEEING INDECENT WITH ME OR THE OTHER USERS , YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE FILE ITSELF AND IT IS FOR THAT THE COMMENTS BUT IF YOU REALLY READ AND SPEAK ENGLISH ""MORON"" YOU KNOW BY NOW THAT EVERYTHING IS WELL EXPLAINED WITHOUT HIDING ANYTHING ON THE DESCRIPTION ... BE MORE SOCIABLE AND CERTAINLY MORE EDUCATED !!! AS I KNOW NO ONE INSULT YOU OR REQUESTED YOUR CRITIC OPINION ."
,nova703,2011-02-08T23:26Z,"FUCK THE DOWNLOAD, I AM MAKING SOME POPCORN WATCHING THE COMMENTS FLY...LOL. THIS IS FAR BETTER IN ANY CASE. (5amjr) PRETTY QUICK WIT BRO, I CAN APPRECIATE.LMAO"
,honunet,2011-02-09T18:54Z,"5amjr, how well do you speak his language?  If the answer is what I, and everyone else here know it is, I might postulate the only moron here is you. "
,5amjr,2011-02-10T10:17Z,"honunet nice attempt to sound intelligent but intelligence like bravery is very easy to fake in the virtual community.
I don't know what language he naturally speaks but whatever it is if i was woeful at it and typed paragraphs in the "" YODA "" style i would avoid it and stick to filtering.

In short, Honunet "" TALKING SHIT YOU ARE ""! LMAO"

lmao"
,honunet,2011-02-10T20:00Z,"what a moron, you actually typed out the same drivel twice.  Sadly, the second desperate attempt at coming across as anything but a sad, lonely boy, defecating in a cup by his monitor as not to miss his glee download when it finishes (unseeded of course), has failed epically. 

So you might, and I emphasize might, be better off trying to make ESL downloaders appear to be even more foolish than you, and leave your betters un-bothered.  Although it seems mr globeplus has in fact owned you too.

Globe:  I will give this download a pass, but thank you sincerely for the effort.  I am sure you have individuals like mr 5amjr in your country, and it is my guess you have more latitude on how to deal with them there than we do.  As for us, we just shake our heads and smile while walking away."
,arctica9,2011-02-11T02:38Z,"this is a terrible rip even for a cam, advertising is in there and the movie cuts out well before the end....It's Shite !"
,5amjr,2011-02-11T14:49Z,"Now now arctic9 don't criticise this waste of bandwidth as the cheap poet honunet who thinks pirate bay users are 'defecating in a cup by their monitors' will defend this poor excuse for an uploader who he now calls mr globeplus from your tyranny while picking you up on your punctuation!
He sounds like he lives life at 100mph doesn't he! lmao
Your right it is shite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,Bargetti,2011-02-12T20:49Z,"At least the movie isn't his, so the movie itself isn't his fault, he just copied but I'm not complaining he copied because he did take the time to say its not his in the description. its just to disappointing there isn't another one out there yet this far out from the release."

As far as bravery goes, I wouldn't hold you half as brave as a sidekick that's only use is the occasional witty comeback, even then it doesn't suit you. Translation: YOUR ASS I WILL BEAT "
