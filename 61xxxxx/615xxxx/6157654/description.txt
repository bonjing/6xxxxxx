Set in Poland this is the story of Aniela who lives alone in a rundown old wooden house that saw many grand parties and lovely times in years past. It, like her is now an aging old relic of things that have outlived their expectancy. A developer wants to buy it and tear it down to build a modern apartment building on it's site. Aniela has a 50 year old son (Krystof Globisz) who occasionally checks in to see how his ornery old mother is doing. He is often accompanied by his overweight 10 year old daughter (Patrycja Szewczyk) who Aniela finds as a spoiled, demanding, undisciplined brat. Aniela blames her husband's wife (Marta Waldera) for her son and granddaughter's laziness. Aniela is often taunted by and bothered by local kids. Her next door neighbors run a music academy for kids out of their home that she spies on daily.
