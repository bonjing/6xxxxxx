Not only does it give you the right answer but shows you detailed work with explanations.


Thank you for uploading this brad101, I've been searching everywhere for a program that helps out with Statistics, really tough.

Just wish I could have found it sooner to use for Algebra, Geometry, etc. I will use this in the future though, and recommend it to those who need help with these courses!
I'll be looking forward to using Calc/College Algebra though, maybe even Chemistry!!

Thanks again, will be seeding this. "
