The History of Meat Loaf Live was aired on tv in 1994. It was taped for VH1 / MTV this is a great pro shot performance. Recorded on November 14th in Orlando, Florida. The classic hits from Bat 1 and Bat 2 are performed here and Meat Loaf is GREAT! It was aired on TV in two blocks. That's why you see credits running through Rock and Roll Dreams. I did my best to rearrange the videos into one concert. Changed the order as they were shown on TV to make the set closer to the rest of the concert tour and edited out all the commercial breaks.
