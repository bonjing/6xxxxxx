,famemon78,2011-02-09T01:57Z,Im not being able to download any of your torrents devrimChe! i know it says one seed but for some odd reason i cant connect to that one seed.. its been over a day! can you pls check your upload settings?!
,devrimCHE,2011-02-09T13:56Z,"dude, I want to send a lot of things, yet I'm new at this kind of thing, i.e., I cannot properly decide on the upload/download speed balance. My speed is supposed to be 8mbps, yet it rarely shows that. While I'm trying at this moment to download 10 files, I'm trying to upload 9 files. any suggestion?"
,devrimCHE,2011-02-09T14:27Z,"a new piece of information: my internet provider is said to allow only around 30 kbps uploading, probably to prevent the upload/download traffic. I am in an impasse, dude."
,devrimCHE,2011-02-09T16:35Z,"waiting for one file I've been downloading to get finished (it has just a few seeders, that's why). once that is done with, I'll stop all downloading and only upload. maybe that will be solving the problem. when it comes to oil prices, telephone service and internet service, my country is a hell. it sometimes takes months to download a single file. so I can only say patience. cheerio."
,famemon78,2011-02-10T02:17Z,lol your country and mine ! no prob. ill wait up since i want the tin drum and Prizzi's Honor both reeeeal bad! Thanks for your effort
,famemon78,2011-03-07T23:22Z,don t know if ur still around buddy.. but just wanted to say im not getting ANY d/l from ur end for the last couple of days.. we r all stuck at 76% .. i sincerely hope u havent just walked away after weeks of patience from our side brother!
,devrimCHE,2011-03-11T16:46Z,"hey there, famemon78 and other pals. still here. because my torrents are large, I'm trying to upload the bigger ones primarily. I'll be beginning to re-upload the whole lot today or tomorrow. patience, yes. brother, yes!"
,devrimCHE,2011-03-12T19:19Z,"famemon78, some feedback NOW, man? I say, do not give up. I'll go on uploading however long it takes. Sorry but the whole thing is because of my uploading limit and that I'm uploading 9 full DVDs at once, man. Take care."
,devrimCHE,2011-03-19T22:21Z,"People going in for the movies I've uploaded, including those friends complaining about my speed (I guess I've answered them properly, without breaking hearts, hopefully), must be already finished. yet now new downloaders are on the line. Only if I delete these files, I'll be able to upload some more and and still precious material. In three or four days's time I'll do this to upload different things. So be alert and seed with these movies, please. with the restrictive rules of the country given can I see no other solution whatsoever. take care. Let there be a God and help the Japanese."
,baybeh,2012-02-23T14:39Z,"Is this upload the same as http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3786283 Basically what I'm asking is, does this upload have all the dvd extras? Thanks."
