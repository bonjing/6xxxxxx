dear piratebay agents, the movies I upload do already have tell-tale features. all are of region1 and mostly region2, with uncoded region restrictions. and the pals interested will already be familiar with the movies, movies that can be bought from the amazon sites. so please forgive me for not explicitly stating the technical properties in the description area, about which I have little idea. I don't mean to challenge your rules, but this is just what I am able to do. Gosh bless all, and all who are on the all Tahrir squares of the world. Cheerio.

ps: the videos are in different languages with respect to audio and subtitles, yet all are English-subtitled.
