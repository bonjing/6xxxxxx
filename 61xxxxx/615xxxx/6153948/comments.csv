,jbjc72,2011-07-06T07:51Z,"@ rarecloud - your handle is appropriate.  
Your right is to do what you wish.  My right is not to be ruled-over by you.  
Also, to mess with the heads of children is sick - most are biologically heterosexual - that is the most common state of being.  A few have a different nature, but this has nothing to do with ""open mindedness.""  Surely they can figure their nature out without your ""help"".
Continue trying to force your way on us and the reaction will not be to your liking because, what you do, we find revolting.  Try to recruit our innocent kids and ... well, you can guess what the reaction will be.
Most of us are not like you - you are not superior - just different - get over it and we can coexist in peace."
,rarecloud,2011-07-17T22:43Z,"@jbjc72 - Thank you for taking time to respond
as it gives me an opportunity to help solidify
what I have learned over the last 28 years
since I started back then on a path with heart.

I agree that RareCloud is a good name choice-- 
and my original website was rarecloud.com.

The sky comprises half of our visible world.

And a cloud is an easily recognizable item
in that hemisphere of our world, 
and is the only item that is both frequent
and in constant flux.

But since our minds were generally 
reared to classify the unknown only into
categories that we have been taught about, 
what a person sees in a cloud
is typically, and simply, a reflexion 
of their world as was taught them.

And yet, there is an element to our lives
that is beyond classification by our minds;
an element that propels the evolution
of all sentient beings-- both human 
and non-human.

For simplicity sake, I call that element
the spirit, but I acknowledge that that 
all-encompassing element is actually 
Not able to be fully described-- 
yet is experienced by each of us.

A cloud, too, like the spirit of life, 
is a constant presence; and a cloud, 
like the spirit, both has recognizable features,  
but also always holds an infinitude 
of possibilities for us.

Also, considering 'RareCloud' as a name choice,
thunder-head clouds, a rarer variety,
provide bread and butter for some 
of my siblings, since their business
is lightning protection (according to 
Underwriters Laboratories standards).

Back to the spirit: It is the leading 
force in our lives, but because the spirit 
is beyond classification by our reason, 
it is a force that is almost universally 
supressed by our minds-- 
societarily speaking. 

Understanding this, therefore, I knew
that the greatest gift I could give 
my only child, my son (now 22), was the gift 
of an awareness of the indefinable spirit-- 
as opposed to his trying to live his life 
simply fitting in, and trying to get 
to the top, of society's definable 
though arbitrary scales.

Our inborn nature was keenly aware of
and completely connected to the spirit,
but by the time we learned to talk, we also 
learned to ignore our spiritual connection 
since it is beyond our mind's reason.

Sad, but true. 

I agree that I am free to do as I wish,
but I had to re-claim that right 
in direct opposition to societal norms
that demand compliance to classify-able
definitions and laws.

As to your notion that I had some desire or
intent to rule-over you: That came 
'out of left field' (to coin and expression)
since anyone ruling over anyone else
is something I continually fight against.

I do fight to open minds by injecting 
spirit dictated actions-- intended 
to immediately put others into a realm
beyond their norm; although, unfortunately,
as your notion attests, the most common 
first reaction from others is their defending 
themselves based on the parameters their mind 
is familiar with.

In the case of individuals that are actively 
looking for spiritual clues, 
their initial reaction to me is glee;
but that is very rare indeed.

Generally though, it takes several meetings
with me before the average person begins 
to appreciate what it is I intend for them.

My gift: ""Your total freedom""; in every sense 
of the words.

Next: Please be aware that I am very careful 
with what I say, and what I do around 
all children.

I was aware that the details 
of my 'mirror' story were scant 
when I wrote them above, 
but they did effectively achieve my intent
of 'getting the final word in'; as I was
confident that they would put an end to 
'freeholay's attempts to 'flame' me since
my words would clearly exhibit to that poster
that he (likely 'he'-- I assume; 
but maybe she...) can not compete with me 
in raw spiritual terms.

I had wondered, ""Who was 'Ru paul' anyway""? 
Google then told me: And so I thought,
""This comment is really 'out of left field'.""

My mirror story is true, but what I did Not
detail was that the only four individuals
that ever saw that mirror were my son, his
older half-sister, his younger half-sis"
,rarecloud,2011-07-17T22:48Z,"[Glitch]

My mirror story is true, but what I did Not
detail was that the only four individuals
that ever saw that mirror were my son, his
older half-sister, his younger half-sister, and
his male cousin; all of them 13 to 16 years old.

My use of the mirror was,
as all things I did for them, and said to them, 
was intended as a gift of freedom.

As the rock-n-roll group Rush
expressed in their song 'War Paint',...

""Girls and boys, together: 
Paint the mirror black.
The mirror always lies."" 

And then later, because I had been privy 
to the details of each of their first 
sexual experiences via third-party 
word of mouth (or implied by statements 
from them); and intending that they 
Not go through life wondering whether 
their bi-sexual tendencies (if present)
should be cause for their concern,
I knew that writing boldly on the mirror
""Bi-sexuals rule the Earth"" would achieve
the gift of my intent for them. 

I completely dis-agree with the argument
that sex with another being, whether
same-gender or other-gender (or other-phylum
for that matter) is biologically based.

Sex is a major physiological hormone driven
urge; and seeks an outlet regardless 
of your mind's intent to dissuade it.

As to the choice of outlet, in every case
that I have been privy to the details 
in a person's life, their preferred choice 
of outlet is based on their first sexual 
encounter.

And as you might surmise, that encounter 
is generally initiated by someone older; 
and that person is not always 
of the same gender.

For example, my male boss and landlord 
for the first ten years of my son's life 
was openly homo-sexual. And because 
of my open-mindedness and clearly 
empathetic ear and nature, 
my bosses homo-sexual friends would 
at times volunteer to me, without my asking, 
the details of their first sexual experience.

(Generally they had been drinking alcohol,
and since most of them wanted in my pants,
it was a topic foremost on their minds;
I guess).

In every instance, an uncle, older male cousin,
male neighbor, or even a father was their
first experience.

And because historically sex is taboo, 
and incest is Strictly taboo, I am sorry 
to report that I also know two male individuals
who I confidentally presume were sexually used,
when they were very young, by their 
respective fathers.

I also presume that their fathers went to
some psychological extremes to keep 
those two boys from revealing those incidents. 

Both of them (now men) are state-certified 
mentally dis-abled. 

One is just a mess, and had allowed, even at
the age of 19, still allowed his father 
to take him to the medical facility
for electric shock treatments; for conditions
unspecified, though roughly classified
by those professionals; who were paid by daddy. 

And the other boy swears upon the bible 
his confidence that his father 
secretly im-planted in his brain 
a radio reciever which aliens transmit upon.

""Yeah. Okay Jimmy."" 

That, my friend, is incest, 
or my 'handle' is not RareCloud.

Biology, huh. Please do not deceive yourself.
Skeletons in the closet: always. Sometimes
supressed out of easy and casual memory.

Anyway, sex is sex is sex: Highly over-rated: 
A biological urge. Not at all worth all the 
drama attributed it. 

See 'Samuel Clements' (aka 'Mark Twain') 
quotes..
http://www.twainquotes.com/Sex.html

.. although the quote I was looking for
I found on a different page; 
reflective of Twain's
'getting up there in years' 
and his digestive tract medical problems:

""One of life's most over-valued pleasures 
is sexual intercourse; of one of life's 
least appreciated pleasures is defecation."" 
 - Mark Twain 

Let all that go, my friend, or it will forever 
stand between you and your total freedom.

So to wrap up my response to ""Surely they can 
figure their nature out without your 'help'."",
I strongly pressumed those four adolescents 
already had a sexual nature: I just wanted
them to know that I supported them 
in whatever nature they live-- within this
their otherwise bigot filled world, and their
respective familie"

So to wrap up my response to ""Surely they can 
figure their nature out without your 'help'."",
I strongly pressumed those four adolescents 
already had a sexual nature: I just wanted
them to know that I supported them 
in whatever nature they live-- within this
their otherwise bigot filled world, and their
respective families.

Further on, your words saying I am 
""trying to force your (my) way on us (you)""
I assume, again, to be a reaction to my not
having taken the time previously to detail 
my statements.

I was just trying to quickly and poinyently
shut down ""freeholay""'s 'stab at me'.

I can only guess that he (or she) 
is a freind of, or possibly, David Mercer, 
himself.

In conclusion, you are again right; in saying
that I am not like everyone else. I try not
to be. I try and intend to be open-minded:
always. And no, I am not superior, but my
connection to the spirit is, and only 
because that is my constant intent. 

That does not make me superior, but my life
is great beyond anything I ever thought possible
when I started my freedom journey at age 23.

Yes. ""Peace, baby. Peace."": frequent words 
out of my mouth-- rest assured.

To coin a phrase or two, ""Thank God..."", or,
""Thank Ala..."" (which-ever you prefer); though
more accurately, I thank the great spirit I
have found the 17 most powerful books 
that I am awre of on Earth all in one place; 
to specifically help me on my quest 
for freedom.

Those books and the clues hidden in them
requiring I ""read between the lines"" are at...

http://www.aquakeys.com/d7a6_toltec/

I am extremely fortunate that I had for 6-years
read the earliest seven of them prior to my
having impregnated my casual girl-friend
(my only son's mom).

Because, my friend, my son who was raised 
with never a hard-rule nor punishment;
who was raised with my endlessly repeated words,
""I love you"", and ""Listen to me if you will, but
trust yourself first and foremost 
before anyone else"" (.. which pissed off 
his mom on more than one occasion)...

That son of mine is a peerless being.

I intend for you, and everyone else,
including freeholay;
but for myself first,... 

All the very best, JBJC,
my friend. All the best.
