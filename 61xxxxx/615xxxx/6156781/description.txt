As always, be patient and seed! I need as much help seeding as I can get!

Installation:
1. Unrar image from archives
2. Burn or mount image and install
3. Use keygen (flt-s3ol.exe) from "Fairlight" to create product key
4. Backup original files and Copy crack files (TS3SP03.exe, TSLHost.dll) from "Fairlight" to Game\Bin directory.
5. Enjoy!
