Tom Lunding Handbook of Psychology (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)


The purpose of this handbook is to provide a guide for the psychology major with regard

to departmental offerings and requirements, opportunities for intellectual enrichment,

and procedures for test and graduate school preparation. It is intended to give you

some information pertinent to your entry into and success in the department. The

handbook is designed to increase your understanding of the program and the

organization of the department. It also gives you information about completing the major

and careers in psychology and related disciplines. Use the handbook as one of several

information sources; additional assistance will be provided through members of the

department, each of whom will, in some way, serve in an advisory capacity.

Acknowledgments

Many persons have contributed to the completion of this handbook, most notably, Dr.

Tom Lunding, who originated the handbook in 1993. Acknowledgments are made to

all members (full-time and part-time) of the Department of Psychology for their

consistent examination and evaluation of departmental objectives and the curriculum,

which resulted in the current revisions in the major sequences and concentrations.

Appreciation is also expressed to departmental faculty for reviewing test results and

other performance measures of majors at each level of instruction as a prelude to

our work on a comprehensive departmental examination.

Administrative assistants are to be commended for their work in the typing and for

the format of course sequences, and other general help and support provided.

Student assistants also contributed in typing and collating tasks.

Sincere gratitude is expressed to all faculty in the department, both full-time and

part-time, for their untiring efforts in instructing and advising students, supervising

students' theses and independent research, and generally serving as mentors to the

students. Finally, acknowledgments must be made to the psychology majors who

make every task worth the effort.
