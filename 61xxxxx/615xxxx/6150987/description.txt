The drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to capture video footage, and assemble a movie in mere minutes. Add professional scene transitions, some background music, and a couple of title effects, and youâ€™re ready to show the world your finished masterpiece. Edit and combine popular file formats including AVI, WMV, MP3, MPEG, MOV, JPEG and many more, all on the same timeline. This makes it easy to create something truly unique from multiple media sources. Video Edit Magic can edit AVI, MPEG (1 and 2), DVD video and WMV files directlyâ€”thereâ€™s no need to convert them to another format first.
Video Edit Magic makes movies in the MPEG formats that are used when creating DVDs, VCDs, and SVCDs. You can also output to QuickTime, AVI, and WMV formats. Movies can be made to NTSC or PAL standards.
Video Edit Magic makes it easy to join, split, crop, trim, modify color, and merge your video files. It includes more than 150 professional quality transitions and visual effects. Some popular ones are Rotate, Green Screen, Picture-In-Picture, Pixelate, and Wipes. A unique feature of Video Edit Magic is the volume track, which you can use to adjust the volume of audio clips from 0% to 400% at any point. You can create fade-ins, fade-outs, and merge sound from the two audio tracks for almost any volume effect.
