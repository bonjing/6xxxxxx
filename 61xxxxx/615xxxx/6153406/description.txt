The tables were turned on the trainers, with shocking results.  

The contestants were amazed to discover that in another Loser first, it would be the trainers weighing in. The results were a surprise to all, and not about to go unpunished. The contestants were woken at an unsociable 5am for a gruelling training session, after which they were given their bio ages by resident Doctor Swan. Each family member then recorded a video message to their future selves. That night the contestants were presented with their first Contest, endurance: a three-round, 10km race on the treadmills. Jodie, Leigh, Joe and Jarrod were chosen as the contesting champions, with The Blacks and Whites left at the final round.
