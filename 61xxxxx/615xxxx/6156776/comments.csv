,Damien74,2011-03-21T14:06Z,Outpost is garbage no matter ;)
,aratron_x,2011-03-27T05:55Z,"WARNING!  A few days after I installed this my computer wouldn't acquire a local IP address and I couldn't get on the internet, and I'm sure this is the culprit.  When I tried to remove the network security driver it installed I got a blue screen and windows wouldn't start.  I don't think this is a virus, I think it is poorly written software.  Time to find another firewall :P"
,ocyrus70,2011-04-01T01:20Z,Great firewall total control for the user but one thing i have found if anyone can help. if i go to the more advanced settings in the main menu it says that these setings are only available in fortknox pro but been on the netgate website and there is no pro just personal and this torrent is the up to date v6..
,Damien_74,2011-05-18T18:59Z,Works just fine! But key needs update :/
,Damien_74,2011-05-18T19:00Z,"aratron_x thats something on your end, not the firewall itself.

cyrus70 you need a full licence. Not Pro."
