,imadman,2011-06-08T18:59Z,"If you are having bsod issues if not in safe mode then you either haven't got the proper drivers installed, or your built-in usb controller is simply not supported. The reason being that microsoft didn't want people to do this. You could try finding your usb controller drivers on the website of the manufacturer of your mobo/computer but it might not work(i haven't had these issues myself so i can't know for sure). To killfrenz: the problem you might have is that somehow the drive wasn't properly formatted(you have to do this in advance and its best not to farmat again once in setup). You could also try to format using other tools...
