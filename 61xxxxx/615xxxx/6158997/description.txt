"Family Practice"

Cuddy's mother, Arlene (guest star Bergen), 
is admitted to Princeton Plansboro after 
complaining about unusual symptoms, but 
stubborn Arlene insists that House be 
removed from the case, forcing House to 
come up with non-conventional and illegal
means to treat his patient. House instructs 
his team to follow his lead, and they 
discover details in Arlene's personal life 
that she kept secret from Cuddy and her 
sister Lucinda (guest star Marshall). 
Later, Cuddy places her trust in House to 
ensure that her mother receives the proper 
medical treatment, leading "by the book" 
medical student Masters to reevaluate her 
responsibility to practice within a code of 
ethics and to follow her boss' orders.

Enjoy :)
