,megadudesmash,2011-04-10T09:21Z,Hello! what will i do after the download is finished? should i burn the files onto a CD? pls reply...thank you
,PirateKad,2011-04-18T00:02Z,"OK, so I extracted this with 7zip and now i have no idea what to do... i just see thousands of folders each with dozens of files... how do I run the actual software for a given language?"
,memerablename,2011-05-02T20:23Z,"Hi, I tried using the autorun.exe, but when try the ""run rossetta stone language system"" button, i get an error that the .INI file is missing? what can I do to fix this?"
,love2as1,2011-05-29T17:50Z,"the english US level 2 isnt's working...

when i tried to install it the cd label detected by RS name blank instead of english level 2 do i cant install it..."
,oMikorirui,2011-06-30T04:57Z,"This has been asked before, but no reply, so I'll ask again.
After the download is finished, what the hell do you do? I've put everything from the zip into a folder. Now I've no idea what to do. I tried the autorun. Once it starts it says there is no language data found.
Click autorun (the application) -> Splash Screen pops up -> A window named setup pops up (has ""Run Rosetta Stone Language System"", ""Configure Rosetta Stone Language System"", ""Language Help Documents"", ""Visit web site"", ""Browse DVD"", and ""Exit"") -> Click Run -> TheRosettaStone window pops up. And like I've said, once it starts it says there is no language data found.
I'd really appreciate it if I got an answer so I can figure this out. I'd like to start learning Japanese because I am studying abroad at Japan next year."
