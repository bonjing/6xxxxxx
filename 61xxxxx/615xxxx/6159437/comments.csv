When you start to install each file it will ask&prompt you to instal the ""content"" folder from the main DAZ instalation folder (if you are using XP SP3 and DAZ Studio 3.x)
BTW, no need to load your HDD space with uninstallers if you need more HDD space for content.
Remember to search for a ""content"" folder ,if you cant find it on your OS and DAZ version then install it to a fake folder and drag and drop the files to your content folder which has Runtime folders."
