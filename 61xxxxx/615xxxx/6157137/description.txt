Storyline: The strikingly beautiful but naive young Dorian Gray, arriving fresh on the London social scene, is taken under the wing of Lord Henry Wotton who introduces him to the seedy pleasures of the cityâ€™s life. When an artist paints a portrait of Dorian to catch the full power of his youthful beauty, Dorian swears he would give anything to stay as he is in the picture â€“ even his soul. Dorianâ€™s stunning good looks and charm soon attract the celebrity lifestyle and everything that it brings, and he finds himself slipping deeper and deeper into a world of sin, sex and violence, seemingly without any consequences. But as his actions become increasingly evil, how long can he hide the secret behind his eternal youth?
