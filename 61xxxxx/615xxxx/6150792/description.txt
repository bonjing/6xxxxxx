The Song Remains the Same [also known as TSRTS] is a concert film by the
English rock band Led Zeppelin. The recording of the film took place during
three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City, during
the band's 1973 concert tour of the United States. The film premiered on 20
October 1976, at Cinema I in New York and at Warner West End Cinema in
London two weeks later. It was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the
same name. The DVD of the film was released on 31 December 1999.

Promotional materials stated that the film was the band's special way of
giving their millions of friends what they had been clamouring for ~ a
personal and private tour of Led Zeppelin. For the first time the world has a
front row seat on Led Zeppelin."
