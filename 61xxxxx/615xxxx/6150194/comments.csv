,SFKTeam,2011-02-05T02:49Z,Its been released for a long time mate since November 09 i think. The reason you might not find many torrents is because the game is updated frequently (58 so far) and its hard to keep track.  
,sthlm080808,2011-02-05T13:02Z,I was JK.. this game sucks badass.. just buy it cracked servers are gayness.. and what valid in steam? so my account can get banned ? fuck this shit..

If You also check the links to the tunngle guide inside the read me you would realise we have released all 58 updates for this game without ever releasing a virus with 100s of consistent downloaders. I recommend you change your anti-virus to something better like kaspersky for example, that way you wont get constant false positives"

How do i play with just my friend online"
,SFKTeam,2011-02-27T17:37Z,"Hi guys thanks for the comments so far :).

HEKTIC12 

glad you got it working mate. To play with your friend you and he need to have the same game version 2.0.6.1 for example.

The host

1. The first thing the host needs to do is open game and open there console. 

2. Now they need to start a map so if you wanted to play versus he/she would type:

map c1m1_hotel versus 

3. Now the hoster must give his ip address to the joiner. he can get his ip address by going to whatsmyip in google.

The Joiner

1. Once you have your friends IP you need to open your game and open console.

2. Inside the console window type:

connect (IP) ....

so if your friends IP is  94.106.21.7 you would type:

connect 94.106.21.7

Alternatively you could both use the SFK Server Launcher to join and host games, which will make things a little easier.

what i mean is i own this game in steam and before i uploaded it i validated every file with steam so its working 100%.

Please visit forum links are inside the readme and read the information in the standalone section.

Read the comments, he's mentioned about a hundred times to use latest version of Winrar to extract the files. Also, i think this extracts the actual game folder, there's no installer, so make sure when you do extract, to extract it where you want the game folder to be.

@ SFKTeam

I went to that Tunngle forum, but, apart from the latest SFK Standalone(which is 5.3 i believe) which files do i need? Is the game in the torrent really version 2.0.5.8? If so then i guess i'm fine, i will just download the ""2.0.4.1 and above to 2.0.6.5"" mini update.

,ArKL1Te,2011-05-01T21:24Z,"I can't trust much seeing that I should download 2 "".exe"" archives and 1 readme. No virus, no problem. Virus? never trust them. Remember that.

Now I'll download the torrent and then comment if there's no suspicious action in these exes. :/"

,Burden123,2011-06-07T15:05Z,Well that is a pity. I have download many torrents concerning Left 4 Dead 2. Not even one is easy for update or install... I have to  buy it now and give money to Valve... what a waste of time

,tatuDowns,2011-08-16T04:17Z,I haven't finished downloading yet but i just wanna say I strongly recommend you create a new steam account just for this game. Just in case Steam recognizes that it's a cracked version and bans your account.
,tatuDowns,2011-08-16T16:27Z,"downloaded it in 4 hours. USE 7zip TO EXTRACT!!!
I had to download 7zip because my winRar was giving errors when extracting. 7zip extracted it in 20 minutes. 

Question:
How do you add this game to Steam? When i play it, the Steam tab doesn't appear when i press 'tab+shift' in game. Help please?
(game works flawlessly, thx!!!!!!!!!!!!!)"

,ALLfine,2011-08-31T20:37Z,"hi gamers, let me ask a silly questions, since i'm a newbie in game...

1. Is this version able to play online? what is steam / non steam?

2. i've just download another torrent, here is the link : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6619697/Left_4_Dead_2_2011_full_game_v_2.0.8.3__-_AviaRa_-

this l4d 2 version has didn't have notifications like ""some1 has startled the witch"" or ""tank death"" or ""use the radio"".... so when i play, i usually didnt see the little damn thing called radio n it's annoying to find it manually.
is this l4d 2 support the notification like that?

3. in order to get notification, what should i do? update it or download l4d 2 by SFK team?"
,mousesport,2011-09-02T15:41Z,"Hey SFKTeam

Thanks for Left 4 dead 2 game!! I was able to extract everything in one folder.

But I have another problem...
""No permission to run ""left4dead2""

I checked my firewall and I checked Left 4 dead 2 to go through but it didn't work. So I closed the entire firewall still doesn't work. Help?"
,mousesport,2011-09-02T15:43Z,"Also, I ran as admin on the desktop or in the folder application. It instantly close down and gave me a warning ""no permission to run ""left4dead2"""" after there was a video of 4 people going through zombies."
