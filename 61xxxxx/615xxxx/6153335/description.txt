Plot: A synopsis cannot do justice to this movie. Its beauty just transcends words, and if you've already seen Odete or O Fantasma you'll know that dialogue or plot aren't exactly Rodrigues stronger point, but still here's a synopsis taken from the Cannes Festival site: 

Â«Once upon a time there was a warâ€¦ In the darkness of the night, a young soldier goes AWOL. 
Tonia, a veteran transsexual in Lisbonâ€™s drag shows, watches the world around her crumble. The competition from younger artists threatens her star status. 
Under pressure from her young boyfriend RosÃ¡rio to assume her female identity, the sex change operation that will transform her into a woman, Tonia struggles against her deeply-held religious convictions. If, on the one hand, she wants to be the woman that RosÃ¡rio so desires, on the other, she knows that before God she can never be that woman. And her son, whom she abandoned when he was a child, now a deserter, comes looking for her. 
Tonia discovers that sheâ€™s ill. To get away from all her troubles she travels to the countryside with RosÃ¡rio, on the excuse of visiting his brother. RosÃ¡rio takes the road of his childhood but will never find the right way. Lost, they find themselves in an enchanted forest, a magical world where they come across the enigmatic Maria Bakker and her friend Paula. 
And that meeting will turn their whole world on its headâ€¦Â»
