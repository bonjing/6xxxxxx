,UncleDaddy,2011-02-08T11:32Z,"EAT released more elegant crack for v3.52!

Release name: Sandboxie.v3.52.Multilingual.Cracked-EAT"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-08T17:34Z,"The crack from EAT also is only for 32-bit, and 4 files should be copy/pasted to the install dir. 
This patch just needs to be copy/pasted to the install dir, and only the ""Patch""button should be clicked. That's more easy."
,kzrockz,2011-02-08T20:15Z,gr8 as usual.no problem what so ever.+1 frm me.thnkx.
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-02-11T16:06Z,"Hi, RobbingHood! Thanks again for your ''Xilisof Blu-Ray Creator 2'' torrent. Please, be so kind, help me, because I FAILED.
Xilisoft Blu-ray Creator was working like charm, everything was perfect, but I didn't Block internet access for the program by using e.g. a firewall: 
> Block internet access through ""Program Control"" from your firewall.
> Or set ""Program Control"" to manual (""Ask what to do/Decide yourself""). I just did Uncheck/disable ""Check for Updates Automatically"" at: 
-> Tools -> Preferences -> General -> Update. 
(Do NOT update Xilisoft Blu-ray Creator (do NOT check for program updates!)
Today I opened this program & it was unregistered, so I uninstalled the whole version & deleted manually all the hidden files & folders & registries of it & reinstalled it. I did everything that was written on the notepad step by step, but when I try to register offline then it says: ''Failed to connect Network, please check your device and Network connection'' , when I try to register online, then it says: ''Invalid license info''. Thanks a lot for any help! "
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-11T18:36Z,"@CheckOutEr 

Obviously there must be some reg entries left.

You could try doing a pc system restore to the date before the program was installed, and then try again."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-11T18:39Z,"BTW:

In this case trying to register online is not very smart, and it may cause even more problems to reinstall the program."
,smithcarl,2011-02-12T14:20Z,your uploads always work great.  any patch for PQ DVD to Ipod suite???
,teamkillexpert,2011-03-09T17:31Z,fuck! why don't people do 64-bit cracks? as if anyone stil uses 32-bit systems today.
,Tatletz,2011-03-22T07:59Z,"Yes, I agree with the above comment=>what about us - 64 bit users?"
,i.love.you.TPB,2011-03-23T21:39Z,"THX RH
