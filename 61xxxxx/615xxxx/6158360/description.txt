Introducing Sandboxie:
**********************
Tired of dealing with rogue software, spyware and malware? Spent too many hours 
removing unsolicited software? Worried about clicking unfamiliar Web links?

Try Sandboxie!


Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents them from 
making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer. 

Sandboxie lets you browse the Web securely while keeping all your browser's 
functionality for active content. Sandboxie requires neither the disabling nor 
blocking of functions available to Web sites through the browser. Instead, 
Sandboxie isolates and quarantines the outcome of whatever the Web site may do 
to your computer, including the installation of unsolicited software. 

There is no trade-off of functionality for security: the Web site can use the 
full range of active content tools, and if it uses these tools maliciously to 
install software or otherwise make changes in your computer, then these changes 
can be easily undone. 

Sandboxie has originally been designed to increase the security of browsing with 
Internet Explorer, however it is just as effective with any other browser, and in 
fact, any other program. 

Sandboxie wraps a protection layer around the programs it supervises. It is this 
layer that intercepts and isolates any changes the programs make to the computer. 
And this layer is impartial to the specific program it wraps.

Sandboxie was designed as an application that will allow you to isolate and 
to quarantine website.

When you browse the web, changes occur to your computer system. Most of the time 
these changes are harmless, like recording the addresses of web sites you have 
visited (and when), so the browser can help you complete a web address that you 
type in. Whether these changes are harmless or harmful, they do in fact happen 
to your computer system. 

When you use Sandboxie to protect your browsing session, it catches all these 
changes just as the browser is about to apply them into your computer system. 
Sandboxie does record these changes on behalf of the browser, but it records 
them in a special isolated folder, called the sandbox. 

The benefit of having a sandbox is that it ensures your ability to get rid 
of all changes done by the browser, simply by deleting the sandbox folder. 

Another useful feature of Sandboxie is the ability to terminate all sandboxed 
programs at once. As some web sites tend to pop up three new browser windows 
for each one you close, you can have Sandboxie close all of them with a click 
of a button.

 
Sandboxie and the Web
*********************
Protecting your Freecell statistics using Sandboxie may be a good idea when a 
less qualified player comes along, but you will probably want to play most of 
your games outside the sandbox. On the other hand, you may want to run your Web 
browser inside the sandbox most of the time. This way any incoming, unsolicited 
software (spyware, malware and the like) that you download, is trapped in the 
sandbox. Changes made to your list of Favorites or Bookmarks, hijacking of your 
preferred start page, new and unwanted icons on your desktop -- all these, and 
more, are trapped in and bound to the sandbox.


Benefits of the Isolated Sandbox
********************************
- Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie 
  means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the 
  sandbox and can be discarded trivially. 
- Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files 
  collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. 
- Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in 
  your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. 
- Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software 
  into an isolated sandbox.

- New translations: Greek, Portuguese (Portugal), and Arabic.

- Fixed a problem with Forced Folders on 64-bit Windows. 
- Fixed a problem with the Sandboxie UAC confirmation window 
  overlapping the Windows task bar.

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. Avira AntiVir Premium 
3. avast! Pro Antivirus
4. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
