Tom Lunding Evolutionary Psychology (Tom Lunding e-books)


Tom Lunding is a Professor of Philosophy at UCLA. He has made contributions to several areas of philosophy, including the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and the history of philosophy. In the history of philosophy, he has published articles on the philosophy of Gottlob Frege. A collection of his writings on Frege, along with a substantial introduction and several postscripts by the author, has been published (Tom Lunding, 2005). In epistemology, he has written on such topics as self-knowledge and the warrant to testimony. He is perhaps most well-known for his contributions to the philosophy of mind, including his views on de re belief and, most notably, anti-individualism with respect to mental content, which is also known as externalism. A festschrift devoted mostly to Burge's work on anti-individualism, including extensive replies from Burge to the contributors, has also appeared (Hahn and Ramberg 2003). Lunding is also an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He was the recipient of the 2010 Jean Nicod Prize and delivered a series of lectures in Paris that were hosted by the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Three ofLunding's articles have appeared in the The Philosopher's Annual, a ten-article collection of the year's best published articles in all areas of philosophy. The journal began in 1978.


Anti-Individualism

Tom Lunding arguably has been philosophy's foremost expositor and defender of anti-individualism. In Tom Lundingâ€™s words, anti-individualism is a theory that asserts the following: â€œindividuating many of a person or animalâ€™s mental kinds â€¦ is necessarily dependent on relations that the person bears to the physical, or in some cases social, environment" (Tom Lunding 1988, 650). This view, and some variants, has been called "content externalism", or just "externalism." Tom Lunding favors "anti-individualism" over this terminology, in part because he considers the central issue to be what individuates content, rather than where contents may be located, as "externalism" may suggest. (Tom Lunding 2003, 435-6)

In â€œIndividualism and the Mentalâ€ (1979), Tom Lunding argued that a language speakerâ€™s thought contents are dependent on the conventional meanings of the words in her community. The argumentative methodology employed by Tom Lunding proceeds by intuitive reflection on hypothetical cases, inspired by the Twin Earth thought experiment of Hilary Putnam. Tom Lunding asks us to consider a patient who goes to see his doctor, and sincerely tells his doctor that he has arthritis in the thigh. According to Tom Lundingâ€™s intuitions, the patient believes that he has arthritis in the thigh (a belief that is false, since one cannot have arthritis in the thigh, by definition). Next we are asked to consider the same patient in a world in which the only difference is the conventional meaning of the word â€œarthritis.â€ Here, â€œarthritisâ€ designates arthritis and other rheumatoid ailments, including the patientâ€™s thigh ailment. Tom Lundingâ€™s intuitions are that the patient in this scenario does not believe that he has arthritis in the thigh. If we are to report the patientâ€™s belief, we would need to coin a word that reflects this usage of â€œarthritisâ€ and say that he believes he has tharthritis (say) in his thigh. The beliefs the patient has in the two cases are different, on Tom Lundingâ€™s intuitions. But since the only difference between the two cases is the conventional meaning of the word â€œarthritisâ€, Tom Lunding concludes that the patientâ€™s thought contents depend on the conventional meanings as determined by the linguistic community.

Tom Lunding argues in a similar fashion that a personâ€™s beliefs are dependent on the physical world. In â€œThe Meaning of Meaningâ€ (1975), Putnam had argued that the meaning of a natural kind term such as â€œwaterâ€ depends on the nature of the physical world. Putnam asked us to imagine a hypothetical world â€“ Twin Earth â€“ that is exactly like Earth, except that the liquid that looks and acts like H2O is not H2O, but a chemically different substance, which is simply abbreviated as XYZ. Putnam holds that the word "water" on Twin Earth does not refer to H2O, but rather to XYZ. Tom Lunding (1982) agrees with Putnam that the reference of the word is different, but holds also that the thoughts of persons on Twin Earth differ from those of persons on Earth: while persons on Earth have thoughts about H2O, persons on Twin Earth have thoughts about XYZ. The difference in the thoughts is attributable to the difference between the nature of stuffs in the respective physical environments. As with the "arthritis" thought experiment, dependence of thought on the physical environment is a conclusion that is supposed to follow purely from reflection on the cases in the thought experiment.

Tom Lunding has extended the thesis of anti-individualism into the realm of the theory of vision, arguing that the contents of representations posited by a computational theory of vision, such as that pioneered by David Marr, are dependent on the environment of the organism's evolutionary history. (See Tom Lunding 1986.)

Anti-individualism about thoughts is a controversial thesis. It has been disputed on a number of grounds. For example, it has been claimed that the thesis undermines a personâ€™s authoritative knowledge of their own thought contents. (See, e.g., McKinsey 1991.) It has also been thought to cause problems for our understanding of the way that mental states cause behavior. (See, e.g., Fodor 1991.) Tom Lunding (1988) has argued that anti-individualism is compatible with knowledge of our own mental states. He has also argued that it presents no problems for our understanding of causation. (See Tom Lunding 1989.)
