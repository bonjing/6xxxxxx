,kicsice,2011-06-11T14:18Z,"I found this today I think from the same uploader
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6344981/Chinesepod_Collection 14 GB including this newbie part

in piratesearch chinesepod and chinese pod has different results

1. keep the folder and stuff what you downloaded from this torrent
2. start to download the big collection... after u have the folder ""tree"" paste your newbie lessons
3. make a recheck and around 17% is already done from the big collection...
 u can have both torrents in seed just set up the download locations with common sence
I hope I helped"
