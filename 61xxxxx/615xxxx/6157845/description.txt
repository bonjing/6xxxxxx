This is really a great collection og one of the most influential punk pumg bands to come out of the late 1970's. Covering all their 6 albums released during 1977 till 1985, along with a string of non-album tracks and rarities. 

Their selftitled from 1977 is very well represented with no less than than 9 tracks; even more if you add those from the American version of the album. Most of these songs are simple straight-forward punk-rockers, not very different from the style of the first Sex Pistols album, though thinner in production. One track though, "Police and Thieves" differs quite markedly, and this song shows that the band were capeable of more than just playing simple rock - the reggae influence would be apparent on all their following albums. 

Among the early non-album tracks "Groovy Times", "I Fought the Law" and "Bankrobber" stand out. 

My vinyl version of their second album "Give' em Enough Rope" has a pretty dull sound; fortunately this is not the case with the songs off the album included on this collection. My trhree favourites from the album "Safe European Home", "Stay Free" and "Julie's Been Working for the Drug Squad" have all been included here, so that really great. 

Their 1979 masterpiece double album "London Calling", obviously has not been included in its whole, and several classics from the album has been left out. The songs included are all great, but I would have liked to have "Spanish Bombs" and "Lovers Rock", too. 

Even harder to cover is the extended 3 records album Sandinista from 1980. The album is pretty uneven and some tracks actually do sound like rehearsals or demos. The songs included from the album are all okay; especially "Somebody Got Murdered". I miss "One More Time" and "Washington Bullets". 

"Combat Rock" from 1982 was the last to feature guitarist and songwriter Mick Jones. It has a simpler, more rocking approach than their previous two, and perhaps fewer memorable tracks. "Rock the Cashbah" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go" are classics, of course. 

Their final album, "Cut the Crap" from 1985 is their least successful, and it is only represented by one song "This is England". A very logical choice, since it's really the outsstanding song on the album. 

A fine compilation; really made me consider purchasing "Sandinista" and "London Calling" on CD as well.
