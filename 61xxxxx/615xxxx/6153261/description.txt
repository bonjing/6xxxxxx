                                The Complete Season 4


When strange anomalies in time start to appear all over England, Professor Cutter and his team have to help track down and capture all sorts of dangerous prehistoric creatures from Earth's distant past.

In the third series, Cutter is killed, while Jason Flemyng joins the cast as Police Officer Danny Quinn. Ben Mansfield also joins as Captain Becker, the team's armed support, replacing Stephen Hart. The climax has Connor, Abby and Quinn pursuing Helen through anomalies to prevent her exterminating the human ancestors. They succeed, Helen is killed, but they remain trapped in past eras.

A year later, both in real and series time, Series 4 begins (introduced by a webisode prologue) with Lester now reporting to an industrialist, and with a new team leader, Matt Anderson. Abby and Connor return and have to win back their places on the team.
