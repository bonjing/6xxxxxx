I\'ve owned this album on vinyl since the day I heard \"Janitor\" on MTV one fine day in 1981. The album is hit-and-miss, with \"Janitor\", \"Anything\", and \"Unable\" (all of which are fronted by the band\'s female vocalist Su Tissue) being personal standouts. The whole album is a fun and obscure slice of 1981 new wave.
