,lawson16,2011-02-08T04:47Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, this is fake, this game is not real, you can NOT play this if you download it"
,Domc20,2011-02-08T05:10Z,@lawson16 y cant u play it?
,romanglad,2011-02-08T05:27Z,"game works well.  only problem I have is the graphics tend to glitch out now and then.  problem solved when playing the game if you turn off the ""bench players"" option."
,Domc20,2011-02-08T05:55Z,U can run the performance benchmark setting in the main menu
,Domc20,2011-02-08T19:21Z,in the main menu go to options then video settings and click performace benchmark 
,romanglad,2011-02-08T19:42Z,the benchmark actually made it worse.  torrent is solid - game runs.  just have to make tweaks manually based on system.  thanks DOMC!
,Reijolii,2011-02-09T19:15Z,"Hi guys, i need help!
When i start the program, it works perfectly, sound and grapfic are very good. But then, when i pick the teams and start a game, comes an error to my screen which says:
""The program nba2k11 .exe has encountered a serious problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience. 
This can be caused by a problem in the program or a deficency in Wine. You may want to check http://appdb.winehq.org/ for tips about running this application.""

What i must to do ?????
Please help me, all i want to do is play NBA2k11 on my mac. Thanks! PS! I have MAC OS X 10.6.2 ""Snow Leopord"", if it change something."
,Poeticile,2011-02-10T02:30Z,"Frankly, it's his first port. Don't expect everything to be so perfect. So quit yo' bitchin' and (at least try) play NBA 2k11 in peace. 

@ Reij ~  Literally, the best thing you can do is post the problem on the WINE boards and hope someone comes to the rescue. And then again, maybe Domc20 is a WINE master and can help you out. But, literally, nothing you can do. Try reinstalling. "
,vichetmeng,2011-02-10T12:34Z,His first port? I think he took the wrapper from the portingteam? Lol.
,Poeticile,2011-02-11T09:18Z,"^ Lolz, probably. "
,1reuben1,2011-02-12T18:09Z,"hi guys i got a couple of questions.

1.Is anyone having trouble loading the performance bench mark thing because when i ry and do it it loads a normal game and then tells me it has to abort.
2. what are good video settings for snow leopard 10.6.6.

3. is it possbile to use an xbox 360/ps3 controller with this? if not could i use a logitech dual pad controller with this?

thnx"
,TheFunTime,2011-02-12T18:52Z,@nancyme12345 how do u make torrents at transmission go fast? thx!
,Poeticile,2011-02-12T23:32Z,"That's retarded. PLEASE understand, that there's no real way to 'make your torrents download faster'. Learn how torrents work please. 

More upload, gives you more download speed. That's how torrents function. You can't just click a button to make your downloads go faster, or else what's the point of even having an option like that?It all depends on the seeder/leecher relationship, and how fast your internet speed is. It has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with your torrenting software/additional options. And the most tinkering you can do gives you maybe 5-10 kbps difference. "
,713-2388,2011-02-14T01:13Z,Awesome! Works great! Thanks a LOT.
,Domc20,2011-02-14T20:06Z,"@1reuben1 just let it keep playing when it says abort the messege will change and it'll configure the settings according to your computers setup.

I use a ps3 controller but idk if ther is a xbox 360 driver for mac.... if you find the driver but it doesnt work with 2k11 try downloading controllermate."
,1reuben1,2011-02-15T03:35Z,@Domc20 thank you i finnaly know understand how to do the performance benchmark and the game works well. if you could show me how to get that ps3 controller driver and how to install it that would be great cause i have a ps3 controller at my home. Thnx
,Domc20,2011-02-15T06:16Z,"@1reuben1
go to http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Ps3Controller

Click version 0.01

it works with bluetooth after you install it too"
,1reuben1,2011-02-16T01:33Z,"@Domc20 thank god for people like you. i hate it when people post torrents and then just forget about them. my final two questions are...

1) is there any way to speed up the game(FPS) besides lowering the graphical settings?

2) How can i get roster updates?
THnx i really appreciate it."

,najjaci2K,2011-04-25T15:55Z,"This game works perfectly on my Mac OSX 10.6.7, 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB 667 MHz. 

Only thing I had to do is lower the resolution on 1024x900 (or something like that) and turn off the bench players (their clothes are different while out of the game and it glitches cuz of that).

But I've got one question about My Player mode. It seems that in ""skill points"" section, I can't switch from ""offensive"" to ""defensive"" or others category.

There's option to switch but when I click it, nothing happens ( it looks like this: ""["" and ""]"" ).

Anyone has a solution?"

My performance benchmark: 20 FPS

MacBook Pro 15.4"", dual-core i7 @ 2.66GHz, 8GB RAM, Momentus XT 500GB, mid-2010)

A couple of freezes in 2 months is perfectly acceptable for a wine ported game. Save a lot a trouble installing fucking Windows on my machine."
