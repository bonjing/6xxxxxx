Whose kitchen will rule?

After the New South Wales team, the South Australian team is next to serve dinner. How will it turn out?

It's state versus state, plate against plate, as 12 teams-of-two from NSW, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and, for the first time, Tasmania attempt to out-dine and out-wine each other to see whose kitchen rules.


Enjoy!
