,beerswagger2007,2011-02-08T03:21Z,dont use this on old firmware.kills halo reach/blk ops/and modernwarefare 2
,supagusti,2011-02-08T17:16Z,"Don't flash anything you find on the net to anything you own!

If you need an update just grab it from M$ site."
,zenman76,2011-02-09T00:33Z,"you do not need to download this here, you can get it from m$ site as already stated.. I would say thats the safer bet.

As for the Reach/Black-Ops/MW2 problem all you have to do is run the original ISO for each game through abgx again which will create a new dvd file then burn a new disc for each ""back-up"" with imgburn ;) 

Job done and your back online playing your fave games again. "
