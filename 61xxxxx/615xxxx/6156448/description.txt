Guns 'N Roses - Welcome to the Videos (1998)

Here's a baker's dozen of Guns N' Roses' most explosive and memorable music videos from 1987 to 1993, and what a lesson they provide in the early evolution of visual style on MTV. Looking back, it seems Guns N' Roses embraced almost every "type" of music-video setting: "Welcome to the Jungle," for instance, finds rapid images of the band's stage performance interspersed with a semi-narrative featuring Axle Rose as a newcomer to the big bad city. "Paradise City" is set against an arena sound check, while "Sweet Child O' Mine" is structured around the now-threadbare idea of a video documentary about a video production. A couple of obsessive themes emerge from this anthology, the starkest involving love and watery deaths ("Don't Cry" and "November Rain"). Most interesting is the opiate-like distortions of "The Garden" and the surreal "Since I Don't Have You," starring Gary Oldman as a grinning devil.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
