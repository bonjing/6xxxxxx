PSP. From there youâ€™re able to downgrade should your PS3 be an appropriate firmware version
(3.55 or earlier). PS3Jig v1.00 installs on the PSP like any other homebrew â€” install it, connect the
two devices (via USB), run it, then power-up the PS3. Voila! Youâ€™re in Factory/Service mode. But!
Know this before you do anything: DO NOT USE â€œPS3Jigâ€ ON PS3 FIRMWARE 3.56! YOU
WILL GET STUCK IN FACTORY/SERVICE MODE INDEFINITELY."
