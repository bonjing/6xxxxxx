A/9
V/9
Has English srt subtitles which lay over the original Chinese subs, there still easy to read because there a lot clearer and bolder print than the original Chinese subs...
Excellent movie and well worth the download...
Many Thanx to raymondhome and JAV2ME for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

thanks"
,CockForYourMom,2011-02-07T22:22Z,"Hey Ray, I need this in Jive.  Are there Jive subtitles?"
,patisallano,2011-02-07T23:39Z,"Thanks for the upload and all. Great movie too, but it just seems that the ending is cut short. Maybe to keep down the size of the torrent, but it feels somehow wrong not to see at least the beginning of the credits rolling.

None the less it's the third movie I've encountered lately where the ending has been cut, so I guess it's a new ""Pirate-trend"" to. One thing is the visual and audio quality, but another if people start cutting endings. That is really bad sports and bad piracy."
,epictroll,2011-02-08T01:41Z,"A 9

This version is 95% complete. Some scenes, including the ending, are missing. But this hardly affects the story flow because everybody dies. Good movie overall."
,korkid,2011-02-08T01:48Z,"Be warned: Terrible subs! I don't get it. There are so many shitty subs out there. Why even bother making them. You don't get paid, so the only rewards left are, the joy of giving people a good viewing experience, or some kind of scene cred. You won't get either by knocking out crappy subs. 
Yeah, i know it's all free and I should just shut and buy the DVD, but I just don't get it. "

,omeezy500,2011-02-08T11:53Z,"Yes, about 5 min of the beginning & 10 minutes of the ending is missing & it makes a big difference b/c it includes a flashback explaining what happened between he & his wife ..then shows what happened w/ the remaining monks, the ppl & soldiers left, where as the ending in this version is depressing as f--k. Not raymonds fault tho & God bless him for being the 1st to bring this ;)"

[T],tzanev,2011-02-09T22:55Z,"Is it just me or are lot of the subtitles not displaying properly? I am getting a lot of ""sub duration + a number"". I tried with other subtitles, but the source must be the same - they all do it. Quite annoying, even though it's more about the action than the plot."
,egadz,2011-02-11T10:51Z,"@korkid
Very true about the subtitles. Especially smack-dab in the middle of the film. I went down for a ceremonial bowl of rice just to shake off the idea of giving up trying to follow what was going on, and i even know a bit of po tong hua (mandarin). Still a wonderful copy, and wonderful story, as expected from the producer.

Subtitle variants, including JAV2ME's can be found here: http://subscene.com/Shaolin/subtitles-86554.aspx Does anyone have a better or complete version? Otherwise, with the variants there, one could use Subtitle Workshop to piece a complete version (perhaps out of time) together with JAV2ME's version.

,nondaras,2011-02-13T01:53Z,thank you
,dylbril,2011-02-16T21:42Z,is the an english sub available
,rapid55k,2011-02-20T04:41Z,"Some of the beginning and the end are missing, and a lot of the subtitles don't work. Very disappointing, but I appreciate the effort."
,justregged,2011-02-21T17:35Z,Fuck the subs the blu-ray is out now anyway
,Onlythebest2011,2011-03-08T01:52Z,"@epictroll 

Listen you jack stain, how about you not fucking comment on anything if your going to SPOIL the end of the movie.  Thanks a lot you piece of shit."
,LooseMorals,2011-04-20T05:46Z,"Read the comments on here after I tried to find decent subs for this film. As I got annoyed half way through. Anyway, couldnt find any that fit this version - so I made one... here ya go: http://subscene.com/english/Shaolin/subtitle-430565.aspx"
,LooseMorals,2011-04-20T05:49Z,"Just to reiteriate - these subs are fixed and works with this release of the film, spent the last 4 hours fixing it. http://subscene.com/english/Shaolin/subtitle-430565.aspx
"
,LooseMorals,2011-04-20T05:53Z,"while fixing these subs, I notice the ending is cut short, as the alternative subs I was using had a whole other scene on the end"
,MDBEST,2011-09-18T21:50Z,"The ""Eng subtitle"" is not gud , many text r missing & last 10 min of d movi is disappeared "
