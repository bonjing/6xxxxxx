,dardar6t9,2011-02-05T07:47Z,Globe was hacked a week or so ago with a heap of fakes posted....its probably the same A-holes.....and this is probably fake!!!
[V],globeplus,2011-02-05T08:05Z,"To thadream101 : if you think a bit you have more information than you need on the description and really what it matters on the perspective of the viewer is informed , it is just a matter to read and interpretate correctly the description , so we have an original no matter what is the video type really is , then the Dub plugins did their work correcting imperfections turning the picture more clear and enjoyable and that it is what really counts , nothing else and the basic information about the file is in there and probably with more information than it is really need it with an analysis about the general work , so only donÂ´t understand anything about the file who really donÂ´t make an effort for that , i am not assuming that was the intention with the especulative comment but sometimes read the description without any precipitation help and on this case everything that really matters is well indicated in only few description lines .

Cheers ."

,thadream101,2011-02-06T00:34Z,@globeplus.....i can tell from the description that this is either a ts or a cam...there is plenty of info in the description for someone like me who has been using sites like this for over 4 years.... but for newer users it can be be deceiving ... just saying....not being rude
[V],globeplus,2011-02-06T22:53Z,"To redperil : if you think that don´t get the other files for this movie because this can really be the best around  !!!

[V],globeplus,2011-02-08T13:33Z,"To blaze69 : i hope the users donÂ´t think that this is a VIP users conference or something but happy to see you and i got my green skull a couple of weeks ago , my conscience is well take it because my intention in this uploading years was always presenting nice files with the best work possible and with that contributing positively to the torrent community , about this file , no doubt that it is excelent work , the movie is good with a nice argument and the argumentist really explored correctly the best on the acting , the direction shows a sequence progress interesting too cativating the viewer and the dub plugins work was wonderfull , i really got what i want about the final picture with the original around positive but with particles randomly on the background of the picture giving a little bit more unfocus personality and the dub plugins correct that perfectly and they are really for this type of work that they exist , just a matter to make the correct analysis on the original picture and use them to do the work . Thank you for your comment and beeing a VIP user or not you certainly welcome to the comments of my files . "
