Thanks for sharing your hard work. +1
I was wondering what the size of a bluray file (1920x1080) for a typical movie (700 Meg for an Xvid version) is using your encoding techniques?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-08T13:36Z,"@pirateman2: Every movie-encode I've done lately has detailed nfo. It's not the usual scribbling as usual in nfo files of others, but practically a blue-print with exact encoding parameters. One can replicate the setting even in smallest detail. NFO is only few kilobytes, pick any encode you found as nice and download specific nfo. Nothing is hidden, I do not want that."

Wanted to watch this one when the trailer was out. Dint even know it was out by now. Thanks a ton for the encode & upload...+1
**Thumbs Up**"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-08T14:39Z,Anything with Gemma Arterton in it is worth watching at least once...Thx.
,pirateman2,2011-02-08T15:28Z,@20/40: I did notice your .nfo files but could not find any encode you did in 1920x1080 resolution and that's why I asked. Thanks anyways.

@pirateman2: Sorry, to many torrents I guess...

However, details are absolutely same as for 720p, just bitrate is 20-30% higher. I haven't changed a bit in settings since specific format is encoded for the first time. When something (some new format) is released, all later encodes of the same format have basically same settings (except duration/bit-rate/file-size relation)."
