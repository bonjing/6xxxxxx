Satski for Android 

Satski is set to revolutionise skiing holidays. This â€˜must haveâ€™ ski gadget enables skiers to navigate the piste, record their day on the slopes and speed levels all from their pocket.

Satski is a touch screen colour GPS system which uses â€˜real timeâ€™ while on the piste to plot userâ€™s routes and guide skiers and boarders of all different levels around the resort, providing an easy to use, interactive piste map.

Suitable for everyone, Satski enables beginner and intermediate skiers to plan a full day out on the piste avoiding black and red runs and enabling them to navigate with ease to preferred restaurants and locations around the mountain all in â€œReal Timeâ€.

More experienced and competitive skiers can plot harder runs and measure their speed and terrain covered, while all the time providing your statistics on speed, distance covered, altitude, ascents and descents and much more.

Satski allows users to plot routes from point A to Point B avoiding the runs you donâ€™t like and at the same time will provide animations of the route you have chosen providing information such as, time the route will take, distance of route and more.

The Satski display will show the usersâ€™ current location on the piste, replays previous runs or the full day skiing at a press of a button. Satski also includes useful information on local points of interest on the mountain like restaurants and lifts. Whilst tracking â€˜liveâ€™ statistics on the piste, the Satski receives GPS signals constantly to allow users to navigate themselves in â€˜real timeâ€™.
