,some-young-guy,2011-02-20T13:21Z,"why is the app packed into RARs to the 3rd power?

RAR-a=9 RARs.  Each of the 9 RARs also contain another RAR which in turn contains a portion of the setup.  I'm not seeding this BS."

,Mr.mofo,2011-03-12T13:39Z,"This is a fucking piss take.

How the fuck am I supposed to unpack it?

I extracted nine folders ... and they have another fucking RAR in each one ... and when you try and unpack it, it says it needs the next portion, but you can't fucking extract any of them because it can't fucking read them ...

WHAT THE FUCK !!!"
,Mr.mofo,2011-03-12T13:52Z,"Right on, move the comment why doncha ... ?

THIS TORRENT SUCKS DICK

IT is IMPOSSIBLE to extract !"
,felreava,2011-10-16T15:51Z,"for people who can't understand the simplicity of this... extract all of the original .zips, then just openrg-setup.r00 notice it isn't a zip file? rn the setup inside of that boom your done "
,nomad169,2011-12-16T06:38Z,"As biguns said, Internet is full of Idiots. For those who are finding it difficult to open

1.Extract the contents of each zip folder (You may see them as WinRAR ZIP archive)
2.After you have extracted, open openrg-setup.r00 or openrg-setup.rar
3.You will find an exe file inside it. Drag it and drop anywhere on your desktop for extraction"
