Just DL the zip, extract to an out of site folder, then install from that location.  It will ask you to make up the prefix for your future MACs, then change all the MACs of every device that links up to that PC.  It also will autorun every time you reboot, all you'd have to do is click the RUN prompt on the start up screen."
[T],scuba-doo,2011-02-07T12:53Z,"thnx for the comment youngguy but this will change the MAC address untill changed back to original (so the new mac is kept even after reboot or shutdown).  as for silent, onec done the program does not need to be started...so nothing running in the background, nothing need be done at all at startup."

Well, the manuals for OW, OWD, RD, Enriched Air, Night, Photo, Wreck, Ice and Deep would be nice.

Videos for Ice, Photo and Night would be nice as well. :)

Preferably with Swedish subtitles but its not necessary. ;)"
