Storyline
From Matt Reeves â€“ the director of Cloverfield â€“ comes the new 
vampire classic that critics are calling â€œchillingly realâ€ (Scott Bowles, 
USA Today), â€œone of the best horror films of the yearâ€ (Cinematical) 
and â€œa haunting, touching and unforgettable thrillerâ€ (Pete Hammond, 
Boxoffice Magazine). In bleak New Mexico, a lonely, bullied boy, Owen (Kodi 
Smit-McPhee of The Road), forms a unique bond with his mysterious new 
neighbor, Abby (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz of Kick-Ass), who moves from town to town 
with the man who appears to be her father (OscarÂ® Nominee Richard Jenkins of 
The Visitor). Trapped in the mind and body of a child, however, Abby is 
forced to hide a horrific secret of bloodthirsty survival. But in a world 
of both tenderness and terror, how can you invite in the one friend who may 
unleash the ultimate nightmare?

Based on the Swedish novel, Let the Right One In, â€œLet Me Inâ€ is a 
dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful 
rendering of my novel for which I am grateful.â€ (John Ajvide Lindqvist, 
author)
