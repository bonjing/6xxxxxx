Speedy Soft DIGISTUDIO v9.2.2 Build 18.1.11

Your digital camera can probably generate also small videos. An animalscene, a waterfall, an arrival of railway train, a musical scene can bringnot only life in the static slide show, but also the original sound. Evenvideos on DVD can be played under certain conditions before the staticpicture background. An especially high image quality deliver the already mentioned vector animations. They adapt themselves to the screen resolution and can produce in the full screen every conceivable scene excellently. In addition here one more example. With these possibilities rises DIGISTUDIO well over the usual conventional and digital slide show.
