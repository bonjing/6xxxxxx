5.24Gb in ONE rar on a slow connection is prone to end in tears."
,kludge420,2011-02-08T15:41Z,"Be glad you can't download this. The original X-Men comics are horrible. They were literally written for 10 year olds and not todays 10 year old but mildly retarded early 1960's 10 year olds. Everything is over explained and then over explained again. Then just to be sure everything is over explained a few hundred more times, it's fucking horrible.

It makes you wonder why anyone would think Stan Lee is a good writer. He's shit."
,maverickman-fan,2011-06-01T10:06Z,"@kludge: Well, you might consider most comics during that time, the 60's, were really meant for the kids, X-Men was something new and needed to be explained. 

Comparing same aged readers from different generations, with that GAP, 60's vs '11, oh come on, that's pointless. That's like vintage vs futuresque... pointlessly funny argument. What's your beef with Stan? Why'd you have to bash 'The Man'? I don't get it.

@Crowded: Thanks for the up, I don't know what's in it but here's the link of what I got in the bag. What I'm really missing are the annuals for X-Men [not the Uncanny X-Men but the series that started in 1991, the one that changed to NewXmeN, then back to X-Men and is now X-Men Legacy], thanks:D"
,maverickman-fan,2011-06-01T10:10Z,Well I forgot to paste the link... anyhow all I was gonna show is a list of x-titles I've collected... pretty much everything except for the annuals...
,Crowed,2012-03-14T22:36Z,"OK.... I'm back with this. On a fast wifi. Come get it :D

P.S.: Includes Annuals too."
,Crowed,2012-04-17T17:21Z,"Sorry... After more than a month since I put this back up and a personal share of 7.46+...

No one is helping to seed this.

I have other projects I'm seeding - and am starting a new one soon. I will be removing this torrent shortly to free up bandwidth for a new torrent...

Thank you for your interest,
Crowed"
,Crowed,2012-05-06T15:51Z,"I don't know why there are still people trying to get this torrent...

I pulled my seed. No one ever helped seed this.

Death by Leeches... :("
