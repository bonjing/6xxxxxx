,devrimCHE,2011-03-12T19:09Z,"Let me tell you why, my friend: because (1) this is Turkey, with all her restrictions, which is maybe not China but has enough to make you go mad with all her rules and the like... And (2) check my other torrents, which are all full DVDs. I've been downloading very little myself, just to upload. You think I'm some kind of freak to toil for sth like this? ĂÂą respect TPB's work and I want people to have good stuff (no offence meant for other uploaders), just that. But as far and good as it can get, my friend. Is that clear? Stay cool."
,freddyboy1,2011-03-13T01:33Z,"Ok, no problem. Thanks for your time. 

But you have to agree that it's pretty unusal for a torrent to be seeded at and average speed of 2.315 KB/sec. 

I was just worried the seeder didn't care.

Now I know better :-)"
,devrimCHE,2011-03-17T17:48Z,"freddyboy1, are you cool now? I hope you are finished and cool, man. soon I'll be uploading sth nice. but you already know my problem, don't you? cheerio."
,devrimCHE,2011-03-19T22:42Z,"People going in for the movies I've uploaded, including those friends complaining about my speed (I guess I've answered them properly, without breaking hearts, hopefully), must be already finished. yet now new downloaders are on the line. Only if I delete these files, I'll be able to upload some more and still precious material. In three or four days's time I'll do this to upload different things. So be alert and seed these movies, please. with the restrictive rules of the country given can I see no other solution whatsoever. take care. Let there be a God and help the Japanese. "
