MouseposÃ© 3 is an essential tool for everyone doing presentations or demos. If turned on, it dims the screen and puts a spotlight on the area around the mouse pointer, easily guiding the audienceâ€˜s attention to an area of interest.

Of course, there are other uses as well. If you have a large screen, it helps you quickly locate the mouse pointer when you return to your work after an interruption. Visually impaired people tell us that it helps them as well.

Visualizing Mouse Clicks

One of the most important aspects of presenting is for an audience to be able to follow what the presenter is doing. Clicking the mouse is usually easily missed, so MouseposÃ© 3 now lets you visualize the mouse clicks by drawing a red circle (or two or three depending on the number of mouse clicks) around the mouse. In MouseposÃ© 3, you can turn on a sound to be played when the Mouse is clicked and the right and left clicks have a different color.

Hitting a user definable hot key turns on the MouseposÃ© effect, dimming the screen and putting the mouse pointer into a "virtual laserpointer" that makes it easy to locate. The desktop behind it remains functional, so that apps can be used while MouseposÃ© 3 is turned on. 

With Keynote 3, Apple even added a setting that allows you to use MouseposÃ© 3 with the popular presentation software

Highlight that Window

New in MouseposÃ© 3: When the Mouse stays over a window for more than a configurable time, the focus automatically expands to highlight the window. Your presentation moves smoothly from detail to context.
