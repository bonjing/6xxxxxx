REEFER MADNESS and COACAINE FIENDS 
Yeah I know there is a copy of Reefer Madness out here but non of the torrents have COCAINE FIENDS packaged with it as a double feature. (Ohh and ahhh) 
Cocaine Fiends is another propaganda film from the same era (1935) and is evidently not easy to find because I couldnâ€™t find it anywhere on TPB. 

IMDb regarding Reefer madness; â€œCautionary tale features a fictionalized and highly exaggerated take on the use of marijuana. A trio of drug dealers lead innocent teenagers to become addicted to "reefer" cigarettes by holding wild parties with jazz musicâ€
IMDb regarding Cocaine Fiends ; â€œDrug dealer on the run from the law meets an innocent young girl and her brother, and turns them into "cocaine fiends."

Both had different directors and I assume different writers and production companyâ€™s.
This particular re-re-re-re-release of the movies combined was released by â€œDVD Movie Classicsâ€

Oh MY god protect your children. 
OK the specs.

NTSF and in English Only. Not my choice, just the way it came. . 
Save for the menus both features are in black and white.  

Its an ISO file as you may have already guessed.
If you need the know how as to how to deal with said ISO file I am sorry I just donâ€™t have the patience.

For the first week from the date of the upload of this torrent the leeching will be slow until 5 other torrents have completely been leeched off of my HD.
Just queue it up and be patient please..
