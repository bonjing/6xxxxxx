,vivatpb5776,2011-04-01T11:35Z,"There is a slight video distortion during the opening credits; about five seconds into the movie. The overall video quality is excellent. The audio is in sync with the video; however, there are no embedded subs or included subtitles.

I think it is a bit bias for the uploader to rate his or her own .torrent; however, I cannot find a significant issue with this download.

Video: 9/10
Audio: 9/10 (no subs)

Thank you uploader"
,deathlire,2011-11-01T06:46Z,Thanks. Didn't really notice it on prerun. i see what you mean 3 small blocks for a sec...but i was using WMP to view it. Sorry about the subs I should get those next time for anyone on any new releases. Thanks!
