UK Skins, Season 5, Episode 2, "Rich"

Rich is a heavy metal fan and when he puts his taste in music on at a party, it doesnâ€™t go down well with the other party goers so Rich and Alo get kicked out. Alo, fed up of Rich getting between him and girls finds Rich a girl to talk to who he calls â€œthe angel of deathâ€. Rich talks to her but soon things become awkward. Franky asks Grace to help Rich with his girl problems but Mini and Liv turn up and is not happy to see Franky there. Grace goes to see Rich in disguise and offers to help him but he wonâ€™t compromise and ends up insulting her. Later at a pub Rich bumps into Grace who is dressed as a â€œmetal headâ€ . It becomes clear that Grace likes Rich but he is oblivious to it so he asks out â€œthe angel of deathâ€ but she rejects him. He then buys a record and deafens himself. In anger he rips up his Napalm Death tickets and goes to see Graceâ€™s dance recital and begins to cry during the her performance. Grace has extra Napalm Death tickets so Rich and Grace go together. The next morning Rich gets his hearing back and realises Grace likes him when he receives a text from her. He asks for advice from his dad and confronts Grace about his feelings for her but can't get up the courage to say anything. As Grace walks off with Mini, Liv and Nick she does a sly Rock sign with her hand. Matty is absent from this episode.
