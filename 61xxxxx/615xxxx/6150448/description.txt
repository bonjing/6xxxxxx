This is a beautiful screensaver, fully funtional premium addition, fully customizable, add as many fish as you like, no restrictions.
I had to strip out the apps that came with it (six of them) including tool bars and other programs forced on you for downloading it, no way to uncheck them, so you're forced to uninstall all these apps after install and do a large cleanup.

This has been cleaned and virus scanned using Norton, Mcfee, Avast, AVG, OK....No false positives either.

Follow the install instructions in the "READ ME FIRST.txt" very easy install,
this is a ZIP file, use a zip utility to unzip "extract"

Enjoy!
