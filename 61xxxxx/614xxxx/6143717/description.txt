WikiLeaks.ch CableGate update for February 1st, 2011 (1PM).  This is a second update for this date - the first was at 12:57AM.

The file size continues to grow with every update as new things are released.  It's currently 7.68 MB (8,059,070 bytes) and expands to 247 MB (259,089,476 bytes) containing 4,526 files in 136 folders.

If you're seeding an older CableGate torrent, seed this instead.  The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html

If you run a local WikiLeaks "pull" / "scrape" mirror (search P2P networks for "wikileaks scrape"), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or p7zip for any operating system.

The bad guys can put up blocks to all known / major HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!
