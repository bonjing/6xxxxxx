,lucid657,2011-02-02T15:23Z,"Dude, just buy a 4.7gb single layer dvd"
,Ocelots019,2011-02-02T16:35Z,"Ok so, I saw other rips and the main problem was that there was either no sound, music, or voice... basically this game is nothing without sound,

So when I read the description it says, game dialogue are still there. but ""Videos Are Reduced In Quality~Video Audio"" so does that mean audio quality is reduced OR is it just not present?"
,lucid657,2011-02-02T16:59Z,"Audio Is Still There, i dl this before."
