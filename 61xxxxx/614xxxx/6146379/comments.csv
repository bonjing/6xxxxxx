Nobody else going to stick around and seed ?"
,Cr1t1c,2011-02-10T22:18Z,"Thanks people for seeding.
I am very surprised how so many people want this! 
It's just the media, no serials, and it's an old version :P I had to download this to support someone then found the CD's so if this is the case then awesome. I couldn't jump through Autodesk's hoops and I had a license yet I couldn't download. I had 'to find a reseller' ??
Boo to Autodesk! Let your legitimate customers download the media."

,Cr1t1c,2011-02-19T22:40Z,"This if from ***THE ORIGINAL MEDIA***
MMMkay!"
,Cr1t1c,2011-02-19T22:41Z,@fuzzysapios - ask Autodesk - it's their distribution :-)
,Cr1t1c,2011-03-02T23:02Z,Much love to the seeders! Since I started this people have been seeding and I have been away and it's kept going. Thanks everyone. I'm going to keep this going too.
