,yo.alpha,2011-02-02T16:21Z,woooooo great work! I can find all of my old cartridge games! Thanks.
,Doodoye,2011-02-03T07:05Z,It's clean. NOD32 ;)
,echo.blue,2011-02-03T15:41Z,"I want to mention that all this roms work on your smartphones (I tested with Android and Symbian). 
All you need is to download appropriate emulator for your smartphone, because in this collection are emulators for your PC only.
I hope you like it. :)"
,echo.blue,2011-02-06T21:28Z,"Because editing is still disabled, i need to write here some informations:

-You don't need to instal PC emulators, evrything has already been installed, and tested. RETRO_LEGENDS are play ready, and waiting for blast off!
-IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAVE YOUR GAME PROGRESS AND SETTINGS, YOU SHOULD COPY YOUR ENTIRE VIDEO GAME CONSOLE FOLDER TO HDD FIRST (WHICH IS LOGICAL, BECAUSE THE DVD ITSELF AND ITS IMAGE FILE ARE READ-ONLY). 
-Each video game console is located in an independent folder, so you can move and copy only one of them to HDD, another disc or share with childhood friends.

Have fun :)"

,Trifonic,2011-07-09T19:30Z,"Ok, so is there a way for me to get this to run without having to burn it onto a DVD? "
,XVIIgUnStArIIVX,2011-07-10T10:24Z,nice 1 
,echo.blue,2011-07-17T08:17Z,"@Trifonic, of course.

How to play?

It's easy.
1. First you need to get disk image emulator (if you don't already have one on your PC). Download and install Daemon tools or Alcohol 120%, for example. Then create virtual drive. You can find your new created virtual drive in My computer together with other optical drives (D, E..).
2. monut DVD image file to a virtual drive, using 'disk image emulator' (Daemon tools, Alcohol 120%).
3. When DVD is loaded, access the disc and launch emulator of console that you want to play. Load (zipped) game rom. Play."
,zardoz78,2011-09-10T13:23Z,Kind of lame ROM set. No Street Fighter 2...
,echo.blue,2011-09-11T17:52Z,"@zardoz78, try to use 'search'. There is  Street Fighter 2! Please do not spread misinformation."
,florinu,2011-10-09T16:00Z,did u had to create an iso?!
,SmokeTheChron,2011-10-10T19:55Z,"Yeah I'm agreeing with the others, how ever you managed to find all these game images is blowing my mind, let alone somehow record them to a modern storage device. Regardless, this torrent is incredible work and I'm still seeding this as we speak, 2 weeks after downloading. I plan on seeding this torrent as long as I've got access to a computer and internet, which should be for the forseeable future :D Keep up the excellent work my friend!"
,yoncenator,2011-10-12T11:33Z,I'm guessing that none of these work on a mac.  I hate mac but it's all I have access to right now.
,Haunted_Guy009,2011-12-07T11:20Z,neogeo is not working properly it dosent show all games 
,straitshooterman,2011-12-24T13:19Z,"Thanx Great Torrent. So Glad you still have the integrity to share. Unlike those Assholes who have leeched of the bay for years to accumulate the Torrents they now are trying to make us pay for them. As far as I am concerned, Ban the Fucks.!!!  "
,lowpriest,2012-01-17T17:44Z,thank you!
,DeAdAnGeLsu,2012-01-24T15:00Z,Thank you all games and rooms are working !
,walkthedinosaur,2012-02-12T01:13Z,The fuck? Why did you make a fucking ISO file? Some people want to choose the consoles/roms
