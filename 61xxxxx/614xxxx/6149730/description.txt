The Burlesque Lounge has its best days behind it. Tess, a retired dancer and owner of the venue, 
struggles to keep the aging theater alive, facing all kinds of financial and artistic challenges.
 With the Lounge's troupe members becoming increasingly distracted by personal problems and a threat 
coming from a wealthy businessman's quest to buy the spot from Tess, the good fortune seems to have

though when Ali's big voice makes her become the main attraction of the revue
