HBO television sitcom about Larry Sanders, a fictional talk show host. This show goes 'behind-the-scenes' to reveal Larry's humorous interactions with the producers and guests, usually celebrities playing themselves and not afraid to take some kidding about their persona.

I only have a little over 100 KB/s up bandwidth so it will take some time to get this seeded. I think the best strategy to use is download one episode at a time instead of the whole package. That way we can get the episodes seeded completely in order and have something to watch before the whole package completes. Then to download the next episode, open the file tab in the bottom panel, right click the file, and select priority/normal.

And please, if you appreciate this series, stick around and help seed. If we can get enough seeders I will consider uploading more seasons if the boxed set of the dvd's hasn't yet been uploaded by then. 

Another avenue you could follow is to download the whole series from share the files dot com. Membership is free, but it requires eMule to download. It is a very slow vehicle, but it will complete ... eventually.
