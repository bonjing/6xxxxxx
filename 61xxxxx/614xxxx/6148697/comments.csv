I use it when I can't find something at TPB, or when this site is down. BitChe will let you either open the torrent directly or take you to the web page. "
,Saki33,2011-02-04T20:12Z,"I just discovered that every full season of this show is available at BTJunkie dot org with a lot of seeders. You would be able to download the entire series much faster there.

,chungwa,2011-03-30T20:10Z,"Thanks for the share. this series may have dated a bit (who remembers most of the b-list trash that cameos on the show, or the situations that inspire the political gags in the monologues) but this is still such a great show. Slicker than The Office, more likeable, intelligent and 'look it's someone famous' than any Ricky Gervaise creation and subtler than Steve Coogan. Each of those guys has their place but the UK missed out on two big shows in the 90s - Seinfeld and Larry Sanders. "

,Saki33,2011-04-05T05:49Z,"Hey, that's why I shared it. Maybe not the best thing that's ever been on tv, but the best comedy that's ever aired. Just my opinion. Not every episode shines, but overall excellence. What a great supporting cast too. And I do remember all the dated references."
,Saki33,2011-07-23T16:06Z,"Finally someone has bought the complete dvd set and is ripping it--so far just the first 7 episodes of season one ripped to mkv and 350 Mb per ep (at demonoid). I have compared the quality and the dvd rips are a little sharper and slightly brighter. I couldn't see any difference on my tv, but side by side on computer I could see a difference. One advantage to the dvd is no itv4 logo in the corner and no promotional voiceovers during the end credits. I am not sure that there is enough improvement to make it worth the trouble of replacing these."
