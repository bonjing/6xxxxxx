Just wanted to thank you on behalf of my father & I. Every Arsenal game you upload brings so much joy over here in Australia to us. My father was born in the UK, me here in Australia. We have aussie rules, & it don't come close to the epl. Wish I lived over where you are, so I could take you out on the town & shout you drinks all night.

Thanks mate! ;))"
