,tellme2,2011-02-03T23:24Z,Maybe upload to a file hoster as well as a torrent and add the link here
[V],mirogster,2011-02-04T16:35Z,"It'd be good idea, but it's totally agaist torrent community = sharing. I'm assuming that you're seeding (few hours) after DL, right? 
It's only approx. 200 MB, how long does it take to download? Maybe 10 - 30  mins (dep. on connection)?   "
,jangofette89,2011-02-05T03:08Z,can you please upload these season 2 shows in avi format instead of flv   its playing ok like this but if i skip ahead or rewind the show it takes a long time for audio/video to sync back up again
,lidenbo,2011-02-06T19:05Z,"unfortunately the quality is very bad 44min, video in 183mb = bad sound and alot of pixles. So better quality is my wish.."
[V],mirogster,2011-02-20T16:55Z,"Bad quality? Ohh Yes Honey, I know :(. Guys once more, I'm not living in Canada, therefore I can't get better quality(hd tv rip --> decent avi). What I have = web rip stuff = crappy quality :( - but still watchable. Sorry that's the truth. 
It's a SHAME that noone from Canada can upload better quality. Well that's why ~BLAME CANADAAAAaaa ;)!!!"
