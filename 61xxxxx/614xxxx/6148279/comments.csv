,NitroH,2011-02-15T11:54Z,"big-2522, what's the point of adding a torrent here if you're not going to seed it yourself? 246 peers, no seeds ... I know you've said that you seeded all day, but did anyone actually manage to download the whole torrent to be able to seed it fully themselves? It doesn't look like you've given them the chance yet.  Sure ppl would seed if they could actually get the full torrent and not just a % of it."
,st0rm09,2011-02-16T18:57Z,"please seed i can leave my computer on nearly 24/7 and id love to be able to share this.
thank you"

,big-2522,2011-02-16T22:36Z,"when i added the torrent again from my desktop,, utorrent starts to download it,, but i shouldnt have to should i,, anyway it seems to be uploading aswell,, let me know,, this is my first torrent,, help would be appreciated.."
,NitroH,2011-02-21T14:03Z,"Thanks for seeding again, it seems like everyone has been stuck at 57.7% for days though. Increasing your upload speed will help a few ppl along."
,st0rm09,2011-02-23T07:44Z,"im still at 57.7
please open your upload speed to something higher
ill seed for a good qhile when the torrent is finished, i like ot keep my ratio at 5"
