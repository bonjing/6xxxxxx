RegCure Registry Cleaner â€” Benefits and Features

Backup and Restore
RegCure offers you peace of mind with its backup and restore features. If you are using Vista or Windows XP, there are two ways for you to protect against accidents: system restore points and backup files. Meanwhile, if you are using Windows 2000 (SP4), Windows 98 (SE) or Windows ME, every time you remove a registry item a backup file is created.

Program Shortcuts
Incorrect program shortcuts can cause headaches! They could cause applications to take longer to launch or even stop them from working at all. RegCure finds and removes these incorrect shortcuts and improves your PCâ€™s performance.

Built-In Scheduler
With RegCureâ€™s scheduling feature, you can just tell it when you want it to do its job, sit back and relax. You can set it to scan at system startup or assign it to work on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can even set up more than one schedule.

Invalid Class Keys and Shell Extensions
Non-working class keys and shell extensions can seriously slow down your PC and cause frustrations. RegCure scans to find invalid entries and remove them.

Application Paths
Disk directories that are not referenced correctly can often cause programs to fail.  RegCure will scan and fix the Application Paths section of the Window registry.

Automatic or Manual Repair
You can let RegCure do all the work as this sophisticated registry cleaner can automatically scan for and repair problems. There is also the option to take the power into your hands and manually guide the repair process.

Organizing Windows Startup Items
By letting RegCure manage your Startup items, you can easily improve the startup speed of our PC. You can choose which programs you wish to launch when your computer starts and you can stop unneeded software from starting automatically. As well, RegCure will find and delete missing programs in the startup area of the Windows registry. These missing items can cause countless problems.

Shows Scan Progress
You never have to wonder what RegCure is doing! With an easy-to-use interface, RegCure shows you exactly what is going on.

Removes Invalid DLL Entries
Have you been to â€œDLL hell?â€ If not, you are lucky. Invalid entries in the dynamic link library section of the registry can cause frustrating application failures. RegCure restores and repairs the registry and keeps you out of DLL hell.

Easy to Customize
You can easily set up RegCure to work for your needs. It can scan only the items you want or you can establish and manage an â€œignore listâ€ so that RegCure will not scan for certain items.
