,rolosdad,2011-03-22T21:36Z,god im pissed off...dragon quest DOSNT work with emu.. all goes ok till u get off boat and father gives you map...then it just freezes!!!! just spent 4 hours trying to fix it..really want this game..please if anyone gets it to work past there tell me your settings on PCSX2..
,rolosdad,2011-03-23T13:56Z,sry bout my earlier comment..dragon quest works fine ..just takes a lot of messing about with the emu settings.
,rolosdad,2011-03-23T13:59Z,"come on uploader. we cant seed if you dont upload..only downloading the 3 persona games and magna carta..dragon quest was done in 2 hours. the other 4 been stuck at 55% for 4 days now..ive been seeding over 200KB,s and its not moved off 55% for 4 days..we cant seed if you dont upload them..at least upload for a month so we can get the files then we can seed them.;("
,enders9,2011-03-24T02:00Z,"I have very rarely turned off the upload since uploading this torrent. Maybe a total of 5 times and never longer than an hour or two. And this torrent is always using a huge majority of my upload speed. 

Until more people get the torrent fully downloaded and start helping me seed it, the upload rate will likely continue to be slow going. Sorry there is nothing I can do about that."
,X-Tidus,2011-04-09T10:34Z,"awesome torrent my friend! uploads like this keep ps2 systems alive nowadays :)
i would like to ask you if you can tell me from which region and in which language are Digital Devil Saga 1 & 2 , Nocturne and Final Fantasy XII
thanks in advance and keep up the good work !
"
,enders9,2011-04-10T23:40Z,Those games are  NTSC and in English
,aensland,2011-04-13T13:13Z,"I don't think it's the uploader's problem, I notice that the 3 seeds (now 7?) that I've been seeing in the past few weeks are always there, but my client rarely connects to them. Likely our crap ISPs to blame (in 4 weeks I only have 20GB up/down at a ratio of nearly 1).

I'm getting the rarer titles and have pretty much only gotten 30%-50% of them. But it's ok. Unlike other torrents I feel pretty good letting this one sit for months cuz there are a whole bunch of RPGs I can't find elsewhere. I've even resorted to searching game shops in other states. Crazy I know.

To echo X-Tidus, props to the uploader."
,Spinfx,2011-04-17T05:33Z,"C'mon guys, there were 7 seeds last night but now it's back to the 3 who've been seeding it the past few weeks."
,N4o7A,2011-04-30T04:50Z,"@enders9 is it possible to make a humble request sir? If you have it, do you think you could upload Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance 2?"
,enders9,2011-05-01T03:28Z,"Don't have it, sorry. The only game I have that isn't on this list right now is Tales of Legendia, which I will upload at some point."
,mrjackspider,2011-05-01T15:24Z,which of these games work on PS2 console?
,enders9,2011-05-03T01:47Z,"I assume most of them will work on a PS2 console, but I have not tested any of them on one so I don't know for sure."
,3L1t3,2011-05-26T02:22Z,"More seeders please we need as many ppl that have this torrent link to seed as high of an upload as your system will allow, i plan to seed it as once i get 100% of everything, so everyone please seed"
,Teddy503,2011-06-14T00:14Z,i jizzed my pants when it was done downloading ;)
,enders9,2011-06-16T00:29Z,"I hope you you also are still seeding it ;)


I am significantly upgrading my internet connection in the next couple days (it'll be 6 times faster than it is now) so hopefully that'll help"
