,Ps3shaman,2011-02-06T07:35Z,"register with ps3hax.com John you ll get all the tutorials. BBasically ou update to 3.55, then download the CFW 3.55 install. then you can use backup manager like Rogero or filemanager. The whole process is much simpler that it is lead to believe. look for :Rogero_Manager_v7.9c_Waninkoko_Kmeaw_LV2_v5__3.55__3.41 from a ps3 scene website. "
