The Psychedelic Furs - Pretty in Pink [second promo].VOB


Very HQ rare movie soundtrack promo music video. "Pretty in Pink" is a song by English band The Psychedelic Furs, originally released in 1981 as a single from the band's second album, Talk Talk Talk. The song inspired the 1986 film of the same name and this re-recorded version of the song was included on the film's soundtrack.

The original version of "Pretty in Pink" peaked at number 43 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1981. The 1986 version reached number 18 in the UK and number 41 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart.

This second promo video for the re-recorded version of the song primary features close-up shots of Richard Butler in front of a screen showing pictures from the film with colorized and black and white special effects. Certain scenes are replaced by full screen clips of the film. The version of the song featured in the video is shorter in length, running 4:03, and does not feature the same fade out ending, providing a full version of the end section of the soundtrack version.

The Psychedelic Furs are an English rock band founded in 1977. Led by singer Richard Butler and his brother Tim on bass guitar, the Psychedelic Furs are one of the more successful acts spawned from the British post-punk scene. Their music went through several phases, from an initially austere art rock sound, later touching on New Wave and hard rock.

They scored several hits in their early career, but were launched to international attention in 1986 when the film director John Hughes borrowed their song title "Pretty in Pink" for his movie of the same name. A newly recorded version of the song became the Psychedlic Furs' biggest hit to that time. "Heartbreak Beat" from their 1987 album Midnight to Midnight, was to be the Furs' biggest Top 40 entry in the US.

The Psychedelic Furs went on hiatus in 1991, and the Butler brothers formed a new band called Love Spit Love. The Psychedelic Furs later regrouped in 2001 and continue to perform around the world.
