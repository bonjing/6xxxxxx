"Innocent Man"

After getting a tip from a priest, Harry 
(Kathy Bates) helps defend Jeffrey 
Rollins, an inmate serving life for a 
murder he did not commit. Meanwhile, legal 
woes continue to worsen for the laundromat 
after Adam (Nate Corddry) risks disbarment 
by going behind Tommy's back to offer the 
fired employee her job back. Elsewhere, 
Malcolm (Aml Ameen) and Tommy form an 
unlikely partnership when they team up to 
help an overweight woman sue multiple fast 
food giants.
