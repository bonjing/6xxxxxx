,boyd1234,2011-05-19T18:05Z,Can someone please tell me if the quality is any good? Is it really 720p? And is this the original version? I preffer it over the director's cut version.

Audio-6/10
Sounded a bit choppy, but understandable.
Very fast download, was able to get 2 mbps on this torrent"

,thepiratenugger,2011-10-08T05:57Z,Fuuuuuuck yea mang!!
,BrestigOg,2011-11-18T08:06Z,"Firstable: thanks for the upload.
However, this is NOT the Director's cut! I realized it when I got problems to download the proper subtitles (the french ones); and the only ones that match your version are the subs for the normal version.
Anyway, it's a good thing  that your version is the normal one; since all movies with director's cut I watched so far suck! (if some scenes have been cut,, it's definitely for some reasons...)"
,PickSuger,2011-12-17T14:47Z,"V: 7/10
A: 5/10

Sound is choppy, and has clicking/popping/cracking in it. Very annoying. Also, the video didn't look much like 720p."
,Cassackos,2012-03-25T23:13Z,seed plz  :)
,axo666,2012-04-04T21:18Z,"Hey, thanks a lot. I was looking for this, the original, not-director's cut, because that one sucks."
,kemistit,2012-04-20T23:17Z,"Quality is close to DVD, audio is bit tinny and muffled"
,danprince10,2012-05-04T01:36Z,"I HIGHLY RECCOMEND NOT DOWNLOADING THIS, I did initially because it looks to be the only active torrent of the theatrical version in HD, however people who are looking for an HD version of the film I sure will be quite unhappy with the audio. It sounds like it was recorded from the inside of a movie theater and slapped on the video file, very muffly sounding. Raj I've used a lot of your stuff in the past but can't approve this one -sorry."
