WikiLeaks.ch CableGate update for February 3rd, 2011, 5:04 PM (European time).  For some reason WikiLeaks has released FIVE archives today already - at 12:10 AM, 12:50 AM, 1:58 AM, 4:29 PM, and now this one at 5:04 PM.  I'll archive and seed(box) all of them, but I'm only uploading the third and the fifth to Pirate Bay and other distribution sites.


This cablegate-201102031704.7z file is 8.26 MB (8,663,293 bytes) in size, and expands to 271 MB (285,123,855 bytes), containing 4,827 files in 137 folders.

If you're seeding an older CableGate torrent, seed this instead.  The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html

If you run a local WikiLeaks "pull" / "scrape" mirror (search P2P networks for "wikileaks scrape"), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or p7zip for any operating system.

The bad guys can put up blocks to all known / major HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!
