    In the 1960s, 'Born Free' captured the world's             
    imagination with the story of Elsa, an orphaned lioness   
    who was taken in by George and Joy Adamson and returned  
    to a life in the wild. The book and film sparked a new    
    love of nature that has blossomed ever since, but the      
    true story of what happened afterwards was far more       
    tragic as both George and Joy were murdered.             
    Fifty years on, this emotional and revealing drama        
    documentary re-lives those events - with intimate          
    contributions from Virginia McKenna and David             
    Attenborough.

     This doesnt appear to have a High Definition Broadcast    
     scheduled at present, probably due to the quantity of    
     archive footage, in any case here's the pdtv version.
