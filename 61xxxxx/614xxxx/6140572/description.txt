Josh Woodward is an independant musician from Findlay, Ohio. He writes some mellow acoustic and some more upbeat rock music, but all of it is licensed under the Creative Commons and available for free from his website and a considerable number of other places. There is an info file which is also pasted below (but the pirate bay isn't very good with links to all places) Take a listen and share with your friends! And if you like it, consider donating or buying ;)
