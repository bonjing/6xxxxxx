,Illanair,2011-02-03T08:22Z,"Would you computer illiterate idiots kindly shut the hell up about the serials? It is written clear as day that you need to block the game from accessing the internet, which blacklists the serial."
,zero213,2011-02-03T12:11Z,"anyone have problem to progress Level 2 in campain when you are waiting for heroes?

My Trolls aren't moving Heroes Bodies to prison so I can't progress this first level...."
,scribe20,2011-02-05T04:15Z,"I WILL TRY TO REPEAT WHAT OTHERS HAVE REPEATEDLY WRITTEN FROM THE OTHER ""DUNGEON"" TORRENT:

THE SERIAL WORKS! DO NOT COPY-PASTE IT, WRITE IT MANUALLY....

BLOCK INTERNET CONNECTION USING FIREWALLS(netLimiter)

IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THESE.. BUY THE GAME"
,Mpakaliaros88,2011-02-07T16:49Z,Its the 3rd i download the game and is in deutch how do i change it to english??does anyone knows?
,TheoCZ,2011-02-08T01:12Z,Same problem - game is not in english (otherwise works fine)
,Xordus,2011-02-08T22:13Z,"The game works, as described above just type serial and disconnect internet.

The problem though is the game seriously needs a patch.  Until someone cracks the newest patch this game is almost pointless.  There is a memory leak that makes the game a slideshow after 30 mins.."
,ene831,2011-02-09T00:05Z,Everything works and mines in English so idk whats wrong with everybody else :)
,Urban_Ninja,2011-02-10T18:54Z,"I did exactly what was told to make this game work and it sort of works..the game starts and after the intros then a background picture od dungeons apperas and the music is playing, BUT there is nothing to press on..no game start or options..no nothing..."
,Urban_Ninja,2011-02-10T19:03Z,"Ok i did a reboot and now the screen settings is normal and i can see the menu, but it is in german :s"
,Urban_Ninja,2011-02-10T19:54Z,"How do i change it to english `?

I deleted the ""De"" folder but then the game starts to config and loading some patching apz were it ask for the game cd.

Then i tryed to use deamon tool and the game installed what it was needing, but now it ask for the password and account serial. 

even if i DID block the exe and replaced the files, then they all apears on german again :/ "
,Maelstorm89,2011-02-23T18:34Z,"Okay, you guys seriously, seems many here don't have the brain function to follow those simple steps so let me offer you a different option, PULL YOUR INTERNET CABLE OUT !
and it should work :)"
,Slyve,2011-06-30T16:07Z,"The game is in the same language as you OS, if you have an English version of windows installed, the game will be in English. Seems like you can't change the language in game, but maybe you can change it in the registry - i will try if it works once i finish the download."
