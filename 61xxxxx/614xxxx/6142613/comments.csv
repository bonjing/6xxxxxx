,TaiTheGuy,2012-03-03T18:09Z,"It's been a while since I watched this but it's pretty good & I think goes something like this: [no-spoiler]

It's a speculative, narrated, documentary type film, based 200 years in the future (2210).
It's based on the what-if concept that society had collapsed due to some big disaster and kinda shows our remaining descendants going around with futuristic archeological devices, studying our remnants and decayed buildings.

Like I think ther was a part where they were wondering why so many millions lived in the desert (like L.A.) and assumed that our swimming pools must've been reserves of drinking water."
