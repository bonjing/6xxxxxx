The excellent performances that got Vanessa Peters a nomination for a Texas Music Award for Female Vocalist are back in her 2006 project.  Peters and the band, Ice Cream On Mondays, blend folk and rock feels to create a sound that has become truly Vanessa.  The sounds and the images that are portrayed from Petersâ€™ writing make this one of those â€˜leave inâ€™ discs that can play on and on.  Her best work to-date, Vanessa Peters solidifies her place in Texas music with this album.  Give a listen and get your copy today.
