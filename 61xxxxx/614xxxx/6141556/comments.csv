@babybluetits24 But I like Genetically Modified crops! They require less pesticides by being more disease resistant, can grow more closely in the fields, and produce more per plant! Lower prices, less pollution, and less risk of cancer (pesticides are EVIL stuff)! What's not to like about GM crops?

I stick to Czech, Polish and German beer.
