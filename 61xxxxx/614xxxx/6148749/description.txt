"Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)"

Derek breaks ground on his Alzheimer's 
clinical trial and Meredith can't help but 
feel left out; Bailey's attempt to take the 
hospital into the age of new media with live 
tweets from the OR does not go over well with 
the Chief; and Callie, Mark and Arizona must 
learn to navigate through the pregnancy 
together, which starts off with Callie 
driving her new obstetrician (guest star 
Rachael Taylor) crazy.

Enjoy :)
