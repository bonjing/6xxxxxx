I controled in Utorrent the files nothing found
100 percent
I deleted the files and downloaded again
same result
The rest of the files are good
vid 10 aud 10 great upload"
,Tiswatzo1,2011-11-10T14:49Z,So if you can control the upload It can be a harddisk fault or the file is corrupted bij other users delete the tracks and replace them and/or upload under a new name.  Thank you
