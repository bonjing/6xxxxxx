You guys always have some of the best torrents I have seen to date! Every time I DL anything from you , I always try and seed the files for at least 2-3 weeks to help share the file. Thanks again , and thanks for all your hard work!"

,tank32fb,2011-03-09T15:37Z,"Hey everyone, I'm a newbie to TPB. I downloaded a few of FXGs files (on my mac) but quicktime says, ""You may need to install additional software to open this type of file.""   I am trying to get these files on iTunes for an eventual upload to my iPod. Any suggestions of how this can be accomplished? 
Thanks!"
