When Myra (Sean Young) picks out a dashing rich friend (Lenny von Dohlen) as her lucky future bridegroom, she is unprepared for his off-beat parents. After arriving at the family mansion to meet her future in-laws, the unsuspecting young Myra is at first treated with a certain aloofness and then with straightforward cruelty. After several twists of fate, Myra has an opportunity to give as good as she got.

Under the Biltmore Clock is very good television (1986) movie. It was aired as part of the PBS American Playhouse series. The movie is based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story Myra Meets His Family. It is the story about Myra, a popular flapper around New York who has her choice of young men but finally decides to marry Knowleton Whitney (played by Lenny Von Dohlen) before itâ€™s too late. Myra Harper (Sean Young) is twenty-one when she makes this decision. When Myra visits the Whitney home for a weekend she finds a group of eccentrics likely to scare off the most courageous of women. Myraâ€™s response and a truly Oâ€™Henry ending cap the production.

Most of the actors in Under the Biltmore Clock are virtual unknowns but definitely recognizable. Sean Young has worked in films and television since 1980. She has nearly eighty credits to her name.
