Resumen:
WWII naval warfare is back! With more campaigns, more combat aircraft, new ships and even more fascinating gameplay, PT Boats: South Gambit is setting the bar even higher for WW2 era naval combat simulations.

The original game - â€œPT Boats: Knights of the Seaâ€ - has brought attention to a new and previously little known aspect of naval warfare during the Second World War. Now, with the large-scale self-standing*) add-on â€œSouth Gambitâ€, you will find yourself commanding a lethal torpedo boat and its crew in the very heart of two entirely new theaters of war. The long list of authentic warships, boats, weapons and aircraft available in PT Boats is now further extended with the legendary Soviet attack plane IL-2, the German torpedo bomber He-111H-6, the Italian cruiser Condottieri, and many many more. 

You will join battle in the Mediterranean and transport British troops and supplies to Libya and Tunis, and escort convoys to the besieged island of Malta; just as if you were participating in the real historical operations â€œHarpoonâ€, â€œVigorousâ€ and â€œPedestalâ€. Then you will be relocated to the Black Sea, where some of the most dramatic historical battles were raging. Nazi â€œKriegsmarineâ€ will do its best to disrupt sea communications between Sevastopol and Novorossiysk. So, you and your PT boat will play an important role in night raids against enemy bases and then in artillery attacks on the German Navy in Yalta and Anapa.
