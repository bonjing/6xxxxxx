The handsome family are certainly one of the best alt-country acts , but more than enhance that current trend in american music they also seem totally locked in to the appalachian folk tradition as this record of gothic country and murder ballads confirms . 

Recorded at home once again (although with live drumming and violin added this time round) "in the air" is an even better record than its predecessor and is adorned with several beautifully sad songs , in particular the title track, "a beautiful thing","dont be scared" "my beautiful bride" and that most perfect of songs for alcohol ruined relationships "so much wine" . 

Incredibly vivid writing and performances , and this time he leaves the wifes vocals out which without being unkind seems a good move .
