- just download using this torrent, i assume u r using utorrent. 
- after a while, temporary folder for this torrent will be created. stop download.
- go to temporary folder for this torrent. delete all contents. replace it with file from your old torrent.
- back to utorrent application, force re-check (press mouse right-click, select force re-check!)
- restart this torrent.
