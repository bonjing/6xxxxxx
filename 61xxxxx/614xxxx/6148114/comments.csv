I meant to say Just install the theme 

when a few offers pop-up click decline !!!

My sentence kinda gives the wrong meaning -
""Just install a few offers pop-up like addons during the installation ... just click Decline""

duke should just kick my ass for that!"

that's a crappy thing to do when you have a genuine windows 7 64 bits ultimate
it's also good advice, people who got the same windows version than mine do not try to modify the windows exe just to place better themes, it may be not worth it...

oh and thx for this locobot12 i'm one of the rare REAL fans of duke nukem!"
