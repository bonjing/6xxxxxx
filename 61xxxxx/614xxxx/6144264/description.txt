Dutch:

Johan was een Nederlandse band rondom zanger/gitarist Jacob de Greeuw, opgericht in Hoorn. Vanwege de vele personeelswisselingen in de band, kan gesteld worden dat De Greeuw het enige vaste bandlid was en hiermee de centrale spil is binnen de groep. De band was opgericht als Visions of Johanna in 1990, maar pas in 1996 werd de naam ingekort tot Johan. Johan grossierde in Beatlesque Engelstalige gitaarpopliedjes. Eind 2009 is Johan er mee gestopt, dit werd op 26 augustus 2009 bekendgemaakt.

English:

Johan was a Dutch band based around singer/guitarist Jacco de Greeuw. Their music has been primarily influenced by bands such as The Beatles, Crowded House, and The Byrds.

Jacco de Greeuw founded Thank God For Us in the late eighties, after having played in several other bands. The band was renamed Little Mary Big when joined by Marike Groot. With this band, he reached second place at the Grote Prijs van Nederland, an important music competition in the Netherlands. However, arguments with female vocalist Marike Groot (who later appeared on Always..., the debut album of The Gathering), forced them to break up the band. De Greeuw formed a new band named Visions of Johanna after a Bob Dylan song. In 1992 they competed once again in the Grote Prijs competition, reaching the semi-finals this time.

After some changes in the line-up, the band signed a contract with Excelsior Recordings in 1995 and released a single (Swing). One year later, in 1996, the bandâ€™s name was shortened to Johan. Under this name the band released a self-titled debut album. The album was received well by Dutch critics and became a commercial success.

SpinART Records signed the band for the US region. When legendary record executive Seymour Stein heard the bandâ€™s music he became interested, and travelled to the Netherlands to see the band play. Impressed, he licensed the record from SpinART in order to release it on Sire Records. Subsequently the band toured Stateside with Sloan, but then all went awry. For inexplicable reasons Sire pulled out of the deal and failed to give the album a proper release.

The band planned to record its second release in 1998, but De Greeuwâ€™s clinical depression took its toll. Three more years would pass before Pergola was released, in 2001. The album received rave reviews and got a lot of airplay on national radio stations. That summer Johan featured on the Pinkpop festival. The following year the band even received the Dutch Edison award for Best National Pop Group.

After an international tour, hardly any news was heard from Johan until 2004, when members Wim Kwakman and Diederik Nomdem left the band. Jeroen Kleijn stepped up and became the bandâ€™s new drummer, and Diets Dijkstra became the band's bassist. After this Johan started playing live again, and recorded its third album THX JHN, which was released in May 2006.



The first single of the album, Oceans, became a great success. This was helped by the songâ€™s video in which an actual fan from Argentina travels from her home country to the Netherlands to see Johan play live. The fact that we see a real fan documenting her trip gives the video something special. The theme of fans thanking Johan (THX is short for â€˜thanksâ€™) is also applied to the albumâ€™s booklet where various fans from other countries appear. The videoâ€™s original concept and the question of the authenticity of the clipâ€™s footage made for a serious online buzz.

The single stayed in the Dutch charts for more than 25 consecutive weeks. Johan played a sold-out club tour and released two more successful singles, Walking Away and Sheâ€™s Got A Way With Men. Through a deal with V2 Records the album was also released in Germany and Italy. Although the album deal for the debut with Sire fell through in the 90â€™s, the band still has a steady following in the US.

The fourth album, titled 4, was scheduled to be released on December 22, 2008, but was eventually be released on April 30, 2009, breaking with the tradition of a new record every five years.

On 26 August 2009 Johan announced they are disbanding on the end of 2009. On December 22 they played their last show, at Paradiso in Amsterdam. At this show they received a gold record for 'Pergola'. A DVD of this last show will be released at the end of 2010, according to Ferry Roseboom from Excelsior Recordings.
