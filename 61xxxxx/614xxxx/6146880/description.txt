Delirious - Farewell Show LIVE In London(2009)

On Sunday the 29th of November 2009, five thousand fans were wedged into the sold out HMV Hammersmith Apollo Theatre, 
ready to see history get made as a seventeen-year voyage of worship discovery drew to a close. This was the final gig for Delirious?, 
and there could hardly have been a better celebration of all that God has done through this band. Twenty-four hours later, Martin Smith had this to say:?
 What can I say? It was awesome, sad, happy, and definitive. One can never correctly adjudicate ones emotions at times like this but I feel at peace. 
I feel joy. I feel like I?ve completed an assignment.?

And what an assignment it was. A Dove Award-winning, Grammy nominated, RIAA Certified Gold-selling assignment.
Delirious? helped score a whole new soundtrack for the church around the world, bringing honesty, passion, 
intimacy and heavenly pride back to the church and beyond. And it?s not quite over yet?now we have the release of this DVD capturing the final concert!
