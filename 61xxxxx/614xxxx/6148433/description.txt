"At first, Healthy Anger seems like an oxymoron. But Bernard Golden helps us understand how anger can be not only normal, but essential to healthy growth--if we know how to guide and control it. And Golden shows us in plain, easy steps how to help our children do just that."--Myrna B. Shure, Ph.D., author of Raising a Thinking Child

"Healthy Anger is a comprehensive sourcebook of practical information for parents. A vital message in this book is that anger does not need to lead to violence. Highly recommended."--Charles E. Schaefer, Ph.D., Professor, Psychology Department, Fairleigh Dickinson University

"Golden confirms what I have long suspected--the origins of adult 'toxic' anger reside in childhood. I found the discussion of 'child logic' and shame especially helpful. I will be a better anger therapist for having read this book!" --W. Doyle Gentry, Ph.D., author of Anger-Free: Ten Basic Steps to Managing Your Anger............
