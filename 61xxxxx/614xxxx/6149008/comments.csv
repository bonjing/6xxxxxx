All the bullshit and bad reviews aside, this is actually a pretty good action movie laced with some mythology and magic.  Don't let the name ""Dragonball"" fool you for a minute, though.  This movie has about as much to do with Dragon Ball as Super Mario Bros: The Movie had to do with Super Mario Bros. the video game.  Sure, we have characters with similar names and somewhat similar attitudes, but all and all?  It may as well be named ""Orbs of Magic: Return of Destruction"" or something similar."
