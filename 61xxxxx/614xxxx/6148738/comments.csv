,BadboyJay55,2011-02-04T05:52Z,I don't understand how to watch videos in rars. Do I have to download all the rars or will just one be enough? 
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-02-04T06:20Z,Download them all and exract the first one

No u must download them all.  Think of it like a puzzle thats not put together. So once its downloaded you open up the first rar and there will be a file in it.  Click and drag this file to your desktop or your download folder. Then a winrar box apears and it will show you the status of the files being put together. So winrar puts all the files together for you. Hope this helps."
