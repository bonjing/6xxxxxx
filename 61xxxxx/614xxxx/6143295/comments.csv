,TerFar,2011-02-02T12:07Z,But 95 GB!!!
,afkuser,2011-02-02T13:29Z,"Dude - grow some balls.

Then join the 21st century and buy a 2TB hard drive or 4."
,slayer117,2011-02-06T13:01Z,"please seed! This is a huge torrent, and we need seeders!!"
,ZaClR,2011-02-06T14:10Z,I am seeding when I can. Plz be patient and get what you can from other leechers while I can't seed.
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-08T23:50Z,"Hi, what's the source on these? HDTV? Bluray? Re-encodes? Cheers."
,ZaClR,2011-02-09T18:28Z,"Volume 1 has no watermarks, so I think that's blu-ray rips. The rest are HDTV. I hope you enjoy it!"
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-09T19:11Z,"Okay, thanks! Good to know :)"
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-16T05:32Z,"Never seen this before, I wish though that I hadn't seen the ""pilot"" episode (00) as some of the stuff it contains is rewritten in the real episodes. Can be a tad confusing and gives away story twists too early, and it doesn't appear that much of the added runtime is actually extra footage, as much of it is reused later in the next episodes.

I would advise any one to not watch the 00 episode until maybe after finishing the whole deal."
,ZaClR,2011-02-17T15:37Z,"@KickassWashingMachine
Thanks for the heads up, i totally forgot to say that! But then again, it says episode 0, which basically always means it's an alternative first episode... :P"
,ill4good,2011-02-20T02:40Z,Thanks. Will seed
,FormaldehydeFTW,2011-02-22T19:12Z,"This is a great torrent, but for the fact that only one person is involved with the seeding and it seems that even that person drops the ball from time to time. It'd be great if that were to change, if more of you could keep seeding when finished. After all, one man can only do so much."
,hoppita,2011-03-07T20:20Z,great job! but I want to know if this stuff includes spanish language and spanish subs?
,hoppita,2011-03-07T20:22Z,And also what format is? MKV or BRrip?
,ZaClR,2011-03-11T20:46Z,"A lot of people are at 99,9% now, so if you are thinking of downloading it, NOW IS THE TIME. Enjoy!"
,ZaClR,2011-03-11T20:49Z,"@Hoppita
The torrent does not include any subs, unfortunately. The file extentions are all .mkv."
,thegr8luiz,2011-03-18T02:02Z,Thank you very much for your time and effort to share this with us.
,erikakaalice,2011-03-18T19:25Z,Please seed!
,Letezem,2011-03-23T21:49Z,4 words : YOU ARE THE MAN!
,ZaClR,2011-04-11T01:43Z,"@Hoppita
I may have misunderstood you the first time I answered you. Yes, there is spanish language in the beginning of season 2, and yes, the spanish is subbed to english. My bad. Enjoy!"
,Rldm1012,2011-04-17T13:33Z,"I will seed 500GB if you guys, give me 95 ... nice deal huh? ^^"

,d7om_9,2011-07-21T03:27Z,"To ZaClR : thank you for everything 
But we need seeds 
my speed from 10 to 20kb\s"
,ZaClR,2011-07-25T05:25Z,"I have started seeding this torrent again (although I have uploaded over 600 GB of it already). I hope others will help me seed when they finish, and not just ""hit and run"". Thank you for the appreciation. When more series come to an end, more torrents will come to the bay. 

Cheers!"
,saddampro,2011-08-14T18:25Z,Please seed...
,saddampro,2011-08-14T18:26Z,"Downloading speed only 25kbps, omg it's 95 GB...
seriously need seeders here"
,alex_power3,2011-10-30T05:50Z,Im uploading at 1 mbps... and downloading at under 100 kbps.. :|
,PyroTheGreat,2012-02-26T15:16Z,"Thanks a lot m8. Great upload indeed. 
And to everybody who is getting bad speed: 
1. Have you opened your port?
2. Have you configured you client properly? 
3. Have you enough bandwidth? 
I find that I get good speed on most public torrents with my 2.5Mbit upload speed. But you'll need a seedbox to really get very high speeds here. Try downloading with 100Mbit up and downstream.... :) "
,Gripen221122,2012-03-24T18:15Z,"There is no subtitle on this one, just so you people should know."
