,elbogla23,2011-03-16T20:26Z,i did download but no audio.....
,shadowwolf1917,2011-03-23T04:30Z,"Only thing I see wrong with it is the fact that two characters speak in Japanese to each other and there are no English subtitles. I don't know if it is just the movie or the hard-coded subtitles are missing, but it is kind of annoying not knowing what they were saying. Other than that, great upload! +1!"
,Asyikin,2011-04-21T16:48Z,...is this full sub in english???

- The sound is fine - except that the music and sound effects are much louder than the dialogues and you may have to adjust the volume sometimes. But that is not necessarily a drawback.
For those who sometimes might be  experiencing problems with downloadable movies like, no sound etc, it is probably because of the player you use. Try GOM player which is one of the best and plays many file formats flawlessly!
- At the beginning, where some Japanese characters speak in their native language, it's just for a couple of minutes. After that the dialogues are in english. So, as in most cases, you can always find subtitles from elsewhere and add them to the movie file and there you are. (subtitles at,  http://subscene.com/)
Unfortunately people complain about the slightest thing because they are too lazy to examine and fix something this easy on their own. -.-
- The quality of both video and sound is really good even though the entire file is 1.7GB including some extras from the dvd! It's great that even the soundtrack is included! Seriously, I recommend this torrent. Try it and you won't be disappointed.

~ Thanks a lot for uploading this, vladtepes3176! It is greatly appreciated.
Cheers"
