,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-03T08:06Z,"I never saw this, so am downloading it based on my faith in your good judgement, 20-40.  I have a couple of requests for ""B"" TV shows circa 2000 late night that were actually not too bad, if you ignored a few shortcomings.  In any case, watching them kept me sane right after my divorce, and I have fond memories of them.

Relic Hunter (the best acted of the two)
Queen Of Swords

And yes I know--requests are frozen--so I'm just launching into the cloud, as it were!"
,ThaGoatMan,2011-02-03T08:20Z,Thanks was looking for this one.
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-03T10:01Z,"@azrielle: I can send you .dlc (link-set for direct download from super-fast MU) for jdownloader for Relic.Hunter.S01-03.DVDrip. It's all 66 episodes, and you can knock yourself out. So, if you're interested, find my address in one Long Header and I will reply."
,hunt_0710,2011-02-03T16:40Z,"Which idiot put a -1 for the quality??.... 
20-40 can't get negative for quality.. its impossible..
Thanx for the up mate... +1"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-03T17:51Z,"Pardon my stupidity, but I don't know how to do whatever it is that you're talking about, 20-40."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-03T17:59Z,@hunt_0710: Because I stole the colors - and encoded movie as B&W. [kidding]
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-03T18:04Z,"@azrielle: Just do Google, I cannot post the links. Jdownloader is program for free but automatized download files from file-hosting services. jdownloader dot org, go there. On youtube are videos as instructions. Go there too. Learning begin with one step too."
