I mean, the rip is fine.. audio and video is all good and that, but there are less holes in a bordello than this plot has. at least the acting is so completely average it takes one's mind off the rubbish storyline. enter at your own risk.. you've been warned."
,wizzkid1970,2011-04-17T22:05Z,@wantporn your name says it all cause this movie is extremely well thought out great acting as are all british actors and has non stop action throughout the movie quality is very good 10 and audio a 9 movie is not for the faint hearted tho it kind of hits a raw nerve making you think of what goes n in our cities under our noses that the police dont care to tell us !!
