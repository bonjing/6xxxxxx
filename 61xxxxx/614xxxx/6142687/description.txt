So here comes an update for . There are games that work in their own right but this was intended as an update to "The Ultimate DOSBox Odyssey". Some folder contain no exe but just complementary files.

Startrail is now cracked so saving and loading wonÂ´t need manual references, also voices on intro work now . Some other games got a new #startme.bat to fix issues.

I whould repack these 2 "The Ultimate DOSBox Odyssey"s into a single bundle with split burnfriendly arhieves if my bandwidth whould be better. This might be done later after this one has been seeded. Perhaps someone out there can help with this? 

best regards Fester.

INSTALL NOTE :
Extract with FreeArc, point to the previous DOSBox folder and overwrite all.
