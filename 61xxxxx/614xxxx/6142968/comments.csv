That's all, Hahaha.

This is amazing man, truly crazy.

Only thing that sucks if I've been downloading for three hours now lol... only on 3%.

Thanks for all your hard work!"
,Cervino5,2011-02-22T03:05Z,"it took me 4 days straight to download the entire thing, its just massive.

Only thing that i want to warn people is that a LOT of the track names are emssed up, so fixing all 3000+ songs will take a while, unless you're the type to not care.

anyways, great torrent, im seeding."
