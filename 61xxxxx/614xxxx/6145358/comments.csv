BTW the ""AVG"" note is commented as follows :=

""With so many hits, presumably because people are trying to find answers for this stupid problem, hereâ€™s what you need to know:

FSG is a compression app used by some malware authors since it wasnâ€™t being picked up by AV software. So, AVGâ€™s brilliant error message is really saying you should get rid of the infected file. My suggestion to you is to find the offending file and delete it from your system. About a third of the time or more, it turns out to be a system restore file. A forum post I found points to an article on turning off/on the system restore so you can properly dispose of the file in question. On the plus side, it doesnâ€™t seem to be (so far) associated with a virus, just malware. Trust me, thatâ€™s a plus side.

Now if only AVG would just friggin remove the damned infection, weâ€™d all be able to get some sleepâ€¦
