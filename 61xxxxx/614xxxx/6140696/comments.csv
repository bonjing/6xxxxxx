,fillinthisspace,2011-02-01T18:36Z,"enjoy52,
Thanks for the thanks, although I'll admit I'll be happy to never watch this show again. ;-)

My internet connection hasn't been really happy since I started seeding this... I guess my ISP is having a bad day.... but I just thought I'd reply to also let everyone know if I disappear now and then before I've finished seeding, don't give up. I'll be back as soon as my ISP gets it together...."
,fillinthisspace,2011-02-01T18:42Z,"PS. The episode I mentioned regarding having fixed the luminance level.... it was ""Stars"" but it's episode 4, not 5... just in case anyone cares.
I wonder why The Pirate Bay has disabled the editing of torrent descriptions?"
,sikeorama,2011-02-11T19:11Z,"Hey thanks for putting in the time to make this available.  It's greatly appreciated, even by those who don't share comments."
,worthya1,2011-02-22T22:14Z,no seeds so soon??:(
,ROYALSPIN,2011-03-26T07:55Z,Such an excellent show.I read about how there was talk about replacing the narrator Mike Rowe and hiring some British narrator instead because Mike has demand for his talents.I dont know if I would watch it if he were gone.He really is the voice for the show.I get a bit tired of always hearing a British accent every time I watch a documentary.It would also be nice to see some fresh faces as well.You always see all the same scientist on these shows from The Universe onto How the Universe Works.Seems like they just keep recycling them.Case in point Michio Kaku-He is everywhere on every show now and on the news.I swear he has a clone or two walking around doing his bidding.Of course if they had (full blown hotty)-Dr.Amy Menzer  on I doubt I would be complaining to much.Anyone know if there will be a season 2 ?I haven't been able to find any info on that anywhere Ive searched.
,oggy225,2011-04-06T21:42Z,Thank you for you effort. Quality is great. I wish people upload more 720p and 1080p HDTV torrents ;)
,thegr8luiz,2011-04-08T14:21Z,Thank you very much for your time and effort to share this with us.
,mike_15896,2011-04-25T11:31Z,seed plz!!!!!!!!!!!
,dinodig,2011-05-09T13:38Z,"Wonderful! I was wondering whether someone could invent a time machine, go back some 300 years and show them this show!

I totally agree with oggy225"
,lavaboydk,2011-06-20T17:30Z,saw an episode by chance on discovery... i dont watch that channel as much any longer since its all tatoos and non-science shit. But this show is amazing :) ty for upload
,ovy89,2011-07-30T18:54Z,"uploaded over 200 GB and still rising in almost 2 weeks, and only 20 seeders. Every man on the planet must see this show. Keep seeding. Thank you."
,invictum,2011-08-30T11:08Z,Thank you for your work!!!
,jpdeveau0,2011-08-31T18:02Z,If you like the science show FYI they are off discovery now. They made a whole new channel for then non reality tv ie good shows. Enter 'Discovery Science' Channel.
,LJE111,2012-01-08T00:03Z,Thank you for all your effort and time in putting this together...many people will enjoy it! I will seed for sure.
,fillinthisspace,2012-01-18T17:03Z,"I revisited (watched) some of these episodes myself the other day and realized the audio for episode 5 (Supernovas) is slightly out of sync. Not that it matters too much as most of the program is computer graphics and voice-over, but it jumped out at me bugged me no end. I do recall wondering about the sync for that episode at one stage.... I think I just watched them enough to not be able to tell any more. Anyway.....

If you're fussy like me and want to fix it, download and install MKVtoolnix. It's free and handy to have on hand for fixing MKV files anyway. Just open the episode with MKVMergeGUI (part of MKVtoolnix), select the AC3 audio track and then the ""Format Specific Options"" tab. Type 120 in the delay box (I'm fairly sure the audio needs to be delayed by 120ms or therabouts), then hit the ""Start Muxing"" button. You'll have a new copy with the audio in sync as fast as your hard drive can write the new file.

Sorry about that.

,fullauto223,2012-02-12T10:35Z,"I'm downloading this for my kid, he's only just a year and few months old but I think this is better for him than some fucked up Veggie Tales that my wife gives him.  I can't wait for my kid to walk into kindergarten telling the other kiddies about cosmology."
,fullauto223,2012-02-12T10:36Z,"BTW, this will my on my seeding list for sure, this needs to be shared!!!"
,sazze,2012-03-20T16:47Z,Been seeding now for 150 GB and keep on going. This needs to be downloaded.
