Innersection is a surf movie. The movie is the climax of each Innersection year â€” four rounds of competition, 25 qualifying surfers, a year of interviews and behind the scenes stories. But the final product is always a new Innersection DVD release. This projects stands at the forefront of a long tradition of surf films popularized by Taylor Steele himself. It is the next evolution of Momentum, Campaign and Stranger Than Fiction â€” the yearâ€™s defining high-performance surf film. THE WEBSITE: For the last two decades, the worldâ€™s best surfers have always competed behind the scenes for their own section on Taylor Steeleâ€™s next surf movie. Innersection.tv now takes the action out from behind the curtain and opens it up to the world. Interviews with filmers and surfers. Stories behind the sections. Member voting for the winners. And an ever-expanding audience of active participants.
