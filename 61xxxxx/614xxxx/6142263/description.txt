         Malik finds that his ever-escalating problems are beginning   
         to take their toll upon him when he continues along a         
         downward spiral; Melanie becomes too energetic during the     
         hosting of a charity event for young girls, teaching her      
          a lesson.

         Original had a minor drop causing a word or two to be         
         lost. Took 3 reruns to finally get a clean one together,      
         but now both people who watch this show can enjoy a clean     
          version.
