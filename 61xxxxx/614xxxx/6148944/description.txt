10-year-old Anton is desperate to have a "real" big brother. Ever so often, he has set his own needs aside for the sake of his autistic big brother Buller, and Anton longs for him to be the brother he never had, strong and daring and one to defend him against the bullies at school. But the only thing Buller can think of is space. Though, when a Super Trip Remote from outer space lands nearby, Buller suddenly becomes the super brother Anton has always dreamt of, and powerful forces are unleashed.
