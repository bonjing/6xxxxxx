[b][i][color=red]The film takes place in Hong Kong, 1962. Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung), a journalist, rents a room in an apartment of a building on the same day as So Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), a secretary from a shipping company. They become next-door neighbors. Each has a spouse who works and often leaves them alone on overtime shifts. Despite the presence of a friendly Shanghainese landlady, Mrs. Suen, and bustling, mahjong-playing neighbours, Chow and So often find themselves alone in their rooms. Their lives continue to intersect in everyday situations: a recurring motif in this film is the loneliness of eating alone, and the film documents the leads' chance encounters, each making their individual trek to the street noodle stall.
Chow and So each nurse suspicions about their own spouse's fidelity; each comes to the conclusion that their spouses have been seeing each other. So wonders aloud how their spouse's affair might have began, and together, So and Chow re-enact what they imagine might have happened.
Chow soon invites So to help him write a martial arts serial for the papers. As their relationship develops, their neighbors begin to take notice. In the context of a socially conservative 1960s' Hong Kong, friendships between men and women bear scrutiny. Chow rents a hotel room away from the apartment where he and So can work together without attracting attention. The relationship between Chow and So is platonic, and defiantly so, as there is the suggestion that they would be degraded if they stooped to the level of their spouses. As time passes, however, they acknowledge that they have developed feelings for each other. Chow leaves Hong Kong for a job in Singapore. He asks So to go with him; Chow waits for her at the hotel room for a time, and then leaves. So can be seen rushing down the stairs of her apartment, only to arrive at the empty hotel room, too late to join Chow.
The next year, So goes to Singapore and visits Chow's apartment where she calls Chow, who is working for a Singaporean newspaper, but So remains silent on the phone when Chow picks up. Later, Chow realizes she has visited his apartment after seeing a lipstick-stained cigarette butt in his ashtray. While dining with a friend, Chow relays a story about how in older times, when a person had a secret that could not be shared, he would instead go atop a mountain, make a hollow in a tree, whisper the secret into that hollow and cover it with mud.
Three years later, So and her young son visit with her former landlady, Mrs. Suen. Mrs. Suen is about to emigrate to the United States, and So inquires about whether the apartment is available for rent. Some time later, Chow returns to visit his landlords, the Koos. He finds they have emigrated to the Philippines. Chow asks about the Suen family next door, and the new owner tells him a woman and her son are now living next door. Chow leaves without realizing So is the lady living next door.
The film ends at Siem Reap, Cambodia, where Chow is seen visiting the Angkor Wat. At the site of a ruined monastery, he whispers for some time into a hollow in a ruined wall, before plugging the hollow with mud.

Un uomo e una donna a Hong Kong, nel 1962: storia dei brevi incontri ritrosi tra Chow Mowan e Su Lizhen, vicini di casa che scoprono casualmente che i rispettivi coniugi sono amanti e inscenano, come in una prova, le rispettive rivelazioni. Si incontrano, si chiedono cosa staranno facendo gli altri due, si parlano come se parlassero a loro, si guardano allontanarsi, e inevitabilmente senza dirselo mai, finiscono per amarsi. Il film si basa soprattutto sulla lentezza dei movimenti, sulle riflessioni dei due personaggi che cercano di accettare il tradimento dei loro coniugi, cercando di capire all'inizio come sia potuto succedere, chi dei due abbia potuto iniziare, ma alla fine capiscono che queste cose sono inutili, anche perchÃ© sta accadendo anche a loro, anche se in modo molto velato. Un "amore" che non avrÃ  mai nÃ© un inizio nÃ© una fine sia perchÃ© lei non ha il coraggio di lasciare il marito, sia perchÃ© entrambi temono di essere giudicati dagli altri.
