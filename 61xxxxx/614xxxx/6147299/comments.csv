,volition787,2011-10-15T17:48Z,"@voraxith, have you tried playing it using DOSBox?"
,Backitup,2012-03-26T07:32Z,"GOG.com has a version that supposedly works on Windows XP

As for this version, the original retail CD version, DOSBOX may work. DOSBOX has had a lot of improvements with video and sound compatibility issues. Sometimes, with certain games, keyboard keys are not always in the right place, and because of this, I've had some annoyances with DOSBOX. 

However, I'm sure this isn't really an issue if I actually knew how to use all of DOSBOX's options, which I don't because I primarily and rarely use it for the odd old DOS game I find that might be interesting or that I remember."
