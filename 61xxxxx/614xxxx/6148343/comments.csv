@raindrops...the files aren't RAR'd, you can view all of them in the torrent. If you downloaded them and then realized they weren't a format you prefer then that is your own fault. Your comment is rather childish sounding to me. If you don't know how to torrent please don't whine about it in the comments. moman73 doesnt have to upload and you dont have to download; but without moman73 there is no option but without raindr0ps we lose NOTHING."
,epound,2011-02-05T12:30Z,"@randr0ps ... to view the file names you click in the torrent header where it lists the number of files ... it will then display the files that will download ... also, you may be interested in a program called Universal Document Converter which can convert anything to pdf ... (available on the wonderful PirateBay) ... cheers ... "
,GIJerryO,2011-03-13T22:38Z,@Moman - what a great contribution you have made to those that seek the truth/facts.  While that statement maybe debatable it by no means takes away from your diligence to present resources for all that need a better foundation of their beliefs. An open mind and an airing of cluttered dogma helps (me) as well.  Thanks again.
