This small Wii Wad package contains all you need to get free DLC for Rock Band 2, The Beatles: Rock Band, Green Day: Rock Band, and Rock Band 3.

If you don't know how to install wads on a Wii, google is your friend.

For RB3 users, this will allow you to import Green Day: Rock Band without an import code, as well as all of your legacy DLC from RB2.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask: i check my torrent's comments often."

,twohours,2011-08-24T22:55Z,i don't understand how to actually use these wads- i use wad manager to install them and i get the 1017 error that it says i should get. But then what?
,lunchdog,2011-10-15T05:22Z,"RB3 DLC past September 27 will not be marked ""purchased"" with this pack. I'm currently scouring the internet for a new WAD.  Be on the lookout for a new torrent soon!"
,tomamber,2012-01-02T22:29Z,Nice has anyone found wad for after sep27
,waedel,2012-01-08T04:53Z,"I am confused. I downloaded this back in Feb 011. It still says it was updated 1/28/11, but I see you guys are commenting about songs thru 9/27.  Where are these?  Is it this same torrent is now updated? or where do I get the torrent that has songs thru 9/27 cuz im still stuck with the songs thru 1/28. THANKS A MILLION FOR ALL YR HARDWORK! i couldn't rock out without you"
