"Killer App"

Foster's former patient, one of the 
founders of a social-networking app, 
comes to the Lightman Group when she 
thinks she's being squeezed out by her 
partner. When she turns up dead a short 
time later, Lightman fights against the 
prevailing evidence to expose the truth 
behind the murder.

Enjoy :)
