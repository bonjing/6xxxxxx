,alilo123,2011-02-26T22:59Z,"good quality download (in terms of video/sound/file size). this is a horror movie. most of it is boring. the end is effing creepy. it really gets paranormal with demons and evil spirits... don't let your kids watch it. in fact, if you have little children, better not watch this at all. pick a nice comedy or something. stay positive. don't screw up your brain.

,vreyhr676y,2012-06-03T22:30Z,"ThePirateBay: Magnet to Torrent Script - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/129375

you'll need FIRST to install Scriptish: http://scriptish.org/downloads/ to run the script

You'll be downloading the torrent from torcache.net, but not all magnets have been converted but you'll get the magnet link over there too.

Enjoy."
