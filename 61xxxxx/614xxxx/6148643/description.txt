"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons"

When Jeff (Joel McHale) becomes concerned
about "Fat Neil," (Charley Koontz) a
fellow Greendale student who is a bit of
a loner, Abed (Danny Pudi) proposes that
they invite him to play a game of
Dungeons and Dragons to boost his spirits
and his confidence. But when Pierce
(Chevy Chase) discovers that he's been
excluded, he forces his way into the game
and takes charge, disrupting their
delicate plan.

Enjoy :)
