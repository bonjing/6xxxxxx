Men's Health - March 2011 (UK)
English | PDF | 252 pages | 80.34 MB


Men's Health is a magazine for men, real men. The type of man you shared a flat with. The blokes you play golf with. The type of guy you share your deepest secret with over a beer. It's a magazine about real blokes and the things that occupy a real guy's mind, groin, heart, body and soul. It dispenses useful information about fitness, health, sex and nutrition with humour, a wink and, occasionally, a kick in butt. You see, blokes need something they can look at, point at, something that says this is what it's like to be a man. You know, like instructions, maybe. Something a guy can pick up and look at, learn from, live by.
