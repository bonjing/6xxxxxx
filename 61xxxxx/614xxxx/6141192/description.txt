A timely examination of human values and the health issues that affect us all, Â¡Salud! looks at the curious case of Cuba, a cash-strapped country with what the BBC calls â€˜one of the worldâ€™s best health systemsâ€™  From the shores of Africa to the Americas, !Salud!hits the road with some of the 28,000 Cuban health professionals serving in 68 countries, and explores the hearts and minds of international medical students in Cuba â€” now numbering 30,000, including nearly 100 from the USA.  Their stories plus testimony from experts around the world bring home the competing agendas that mark the battle for global healthâ€”and the complex realities confronting the movement to make healthcare everyoneâ€™s birth right.

"Cuba also has extremely advanced technology in the development of new medicines, some of them innovative on a world class scaleâ€¦ and their outreach program to other countries is unequaled anywhere in the world."
FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER
