Michael Clark (Kris Slater) is up for a big promotion at work, but there's a catch: he must agree to a blind date with the boss's daughter, Alicia (Kaylani Lei). Both fresh from bad relationships, Michael and Alicia reluctantly agree, but they're both pleasantly surprised to find themselves really hitting it off. The chemistry builds until their respective exes show up to make sure the new couple's night takes a very wrong turn! One hilarious and sexy disaster after another makes this blind date one they will never forget...if they live to remember it!
