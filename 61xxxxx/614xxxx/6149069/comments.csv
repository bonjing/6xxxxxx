Those patches are specific for their release and may cause problems in conjunction with this one.

@the-goose
The only advice I can give is try and reinstall the game. I am unable to replicate this problem. Maybe it is related to your settings. You said the game was working at first so it is unlikely the problem has anything to do with my release.

Anyone else having a similar problem?"

Thanks for the feedback.
You can change your name via rev.ini in installation folder.
I'm guessing you didn't notice but the setup actually prompted for a username (by default system username).

Thanks for the release. I have some questions to ask, if you do not mind?

1. When playing as a terrorist in an offline game, why do I always carry bomb? It must be some kind of bug, since the bomb should be given randomly between the bots and me.

2. Even since Patch 5 onwards, .Net Framework 4 must be installed for the game to be run. Why does it happen? Is this what Valve insists in this game? Is it possible to run the game without installing Net Framework 4.  

Thank you for the information given."
,SkII11,2011-03-21T12:55Z,"@khfe
1. Not sure, but it's nothing to do with the release, it is 100% clean.
2. The patches use .Net Framework 4 to detect whether or not you have CSP addon installed so it knows which files to install. It is not possible to install the patch without .Net Framework 4. You can uninstall the framework after installing the patch if you really want to."

There is no ""Play Game"" Option, if you are looking for a game with a story line this is not it, you are looking for Half Life 2 and all the other games.
You can not play online as you do not have steam, the best thing you can do is play in LAN or with Bots

it is programmed in the game to give the bomb to live players.

Yes, you can. But if your friends don't see your server in the LAN tab, they will have to connect by using the ""connect"" command in the console.

For example, if your IP is 192.168.0.3, they will have to type ""connect 192.168.0.3:27015"" in the console."
