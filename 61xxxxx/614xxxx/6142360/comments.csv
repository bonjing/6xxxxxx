Use VLC instead, or stream it to a PS3 if you have one.
If you miss the audio by converting it, it's probably your own fault."

@SAFukO09
That's great if you start with uploading 720p versions. I know TvTeam did it for a while, but they seem to have stopped with it =/
I'm watching it on a 32"" tv through a PS3, so I always go for the 720p version.

The bad thing is that there is less chance of a 720p version of the PPVs. I hope you can change that and upload the Elimantion Chamber and Wrestlemania (in 720p) when the time comes."
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-02-03T21:50Z,Dont you worry i'll get them in 720p
