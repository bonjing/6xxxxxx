SILENT WITNESS - SERIES 14

Silent Witness is a complex, compelling crime drama and one of the BBCâ€™s most popular and long-running series. It focuses on a team of forensic pathologists: Dr. Harry Cunningham (Tom Ward), Dr. Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox) and Professor Leo Dalton (William Gaminara).
Based in â€˜The Thomas Lyell Centreâ€™ - a hi-tech scientific laboratory set within the grounds of a university - the pathologists painstakingly examine the bodies of the deceased to search for vital clues that may reveal the cause of death. Their expert analysis very often leads to crucial discoveries being made which enable the police to identify and apprehend those responsible for the crime. However, sometimes their passion, sense of humanity and commitment to justice causes them to put their own lives in danger to ensure the criminal is caught.
With average weekly viewing figures regularly above 6 million in the UK, Silent Witness is back in 2011 for its 14th series. A bold, challenging and exciting drama, the show continues to explore contemporary issues through clever and thrilling crime mysteries.
