         A team of top scientists come together with one goal          
         to create the definitive guide to Bigfoot. Does the           
         creature exist? And if it does where is it? And how can it    
         survive without being detected? Using a new interactive       
         map the team has plotted more than 10,000 Bigfoot type        
         sightings from around the world. These sightings are of       
         an unidentified creature which walks on two legs and is       
         covered in a thick layer of hair. Many of theses sightings    
         date back over 100 years. With their expert knowledge         
         of the natural world they are able to dismiss nearly 90%      
         of the sightings, but what emerges is a series of global      
         hotspots that cannot be explained which indicate that         
         something is out there. The team examines these global        
         hotspots and searches for explanations including new          
         theories that suggest we may have been looking for the        
          wrong creature all along?
