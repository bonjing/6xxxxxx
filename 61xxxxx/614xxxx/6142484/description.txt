Mini-series based on two previous one-off thrillers. A man with learning difficulties has his murder conviction overturned, forcing DS Eve Granger to reopen the case. Jailed serial killer Brian Wicklow offers to help with the investigation - and makes her realise she may have been allowing misplaced compassion to cloud her judgement. Matthew Kelly guest stars once more as Wicklow, with Jemma Redgrave, John Hannah and Pauline Quirke.
