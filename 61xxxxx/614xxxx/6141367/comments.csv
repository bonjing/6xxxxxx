I captured this in SD but i'm gonna grab it and see how good this one is for quality.

Great show!!

Another great one is ""SNIPER: Deadliest Missions""
Has some of the same guys about other missions they did that were way badder than what is on this one!!"
,CHAOS1972,2011-02-23T04:35Z,"I am actually amazed more of these don't get capped and torrented!!

This one is actually a bit old as i saw it for the first time at least a year ago."
