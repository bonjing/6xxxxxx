Im having big issues to install another language to this release. It just wont do it. Some kiddy screen stuff when you load windows with a damned eagle insted of the normal windows logo. 

Dono what else, its just pure crap....good though but made for arabs and egypt ppl that can actually use this and dont mind to have everything 'haxed' to their favour..."
