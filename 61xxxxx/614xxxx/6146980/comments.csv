,blammer,2011-04-13T19:55Z,"First of all thanks for the upload and your time. Dont take the following personal.

but...

This is by far the worst collection i ever downloaded. I keep hitting skip track button. There are to many remixes (nothing wrong with a good remix, but this is to simple. Like in the days bubbling was populair, they take many polulair songs and change it in to bubbling).

There are to many frenzy-like songs to chaotic no flow with the rhythm.

Come on dubstep fans. You really have to feel me with this. Listen to some old tracks. You'll hear the difference instantly. 

Take this one for example: youpoop SFu2DfPDGeU

Don't forget what dubstep is all about. Don't let it be like hardcore, speedcore that's for people who doesn't feel rhytm. 

(not all the songs were bad but TO many are, that's my point. many sound like mass production results).

Ok that's it. i'm a critic and i hope to get some normal responses instead of .....

Peace!
