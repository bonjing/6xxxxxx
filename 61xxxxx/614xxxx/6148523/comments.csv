,rogersmith,2011-05-03T13:36Z,"some of the files are larger than others because the run time is longer. this does not account for all of the deviation in episode size.  some of the episodes, like a pilot for example, are over an hour long.  the quality of the episodes that i've watched so far have been better than some of the dvd rips uploaded here."
