,referhead,2011-03-06T18:43Z,ive downloaded and used lots and lots of yours uploads on my jailbroken iphone was ios4.2 and all have worked great EXCEPT this one. it installs to my phone but when i tap it to open it it comes up with the startup screen and then (after about 10 secs) it jus goes back to homescreen. anyone any ideas?
