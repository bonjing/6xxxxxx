Launch the I Am T-Pain app, select your favorite track, and just sing into the Mic on your iPhone. I Am T-Pain will record and Auto-Tune your voice. Then, with a single button, share your song over email, Facebook, or Twitter.

- The App includes many previously unreleased T-Pain original beats.
- Additional songs including On A Boat, Buy U A Drank, and Good Life can be purchased within the App.
- Get five brand spankin' new beats from the hottest producers every Thursday at 3pm. The first 100 to download them get them for free!
- Use Auto-Tune with your existing iTunes library.
- You can select the Freestyle option and use Auto-Tune for singing without companion tracks. Use this option if you simply want to send someone an Auto-Tuned greeting over email (Shawwttay!).
- With the 1.5 Update, you can also create your own auto-tuned videos (iOS 4.0 required with iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4).
- Tired of being drunk dialed in the middle of the night by that special friend who needs to talk? Return the favor and leave Auto-Tuned phone messages with the T-Pain Dialer, new update 1.6.
 
http://iamtpain.smule.com/ features top Auto-Tuned performances around the world, based on the amount of "Love" your songs receive on Facebook or MySpace.

We recommend using the headphones with the integrated microphone that came bundled with your iPhone. iPod Touch 4G users: Because of hardware limitations, we recommend you use a headset or headphones with this product.

Unfortunately, we are no longer supporting iPod 2s with iOS 4.


What's New in Version 1.6.3

Fixes to make the app smooth (just like you)!


Proud to be one of the few new PDA groups who do not steal source from p2p
NEVER have, NEVER will.
Only accept quality ARBiTRAGEPDA release!
