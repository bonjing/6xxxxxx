,danboy1200,2012-03-15T13:10Z,is there only 1 season?
,blackwlf666,2012-04-18T06:41Z,"It's a miniseries. There is no further season. There is, however, a comic continuation currently being scripted. It is to be put out by Red 5 Comics at some point in the future. It was expect to be out near the end of 2011, but the writers have been having some personal things that have slowed down the writing."
,tieranosaur,2012-04-20T22:24Z,Why are there 6 episodes listed here and only 3 are on IMDb?
,cracktheskye88,2012-05-06T12:37Z,"@tieranosaur: The series was aired as 3 x 2-hour episodes, but on the DVD it is split into 6 x 1-hour episodes."
