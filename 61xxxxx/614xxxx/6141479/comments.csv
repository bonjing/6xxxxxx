,dumbson,2011-02-06T22:16Z,"no it's not, everytime you click on on the DL it comes up as a broken link."
,obituary_mambo,2011-02-08T15:26Z,Clicking the magnet link will allow you to download the files -- and it's worth it because they are excellent quality!  Thank you ReallyWhy!  ^__^
,obituary_mambo,2011-02-08T15:37Z,"Ooops!  I was confused.  Clicking the magnet link will allow you to add the torrent to your torrent client, but there aren't any seeds.  I actually ended up getting this somewhere else (with bigger files).  However, I'd like to add this version to my collection if it becomes available.  Sorry for the mix-up."
,wishmkr,2011-02-08T22:59Z,Please seed! Stuck on 0.0%. Thanks :)
,dumbson,2011-02-09T04:12Z,reallywhy is a fake bitch
,feverfive,2011-02-10T05:49Z,"gotta be fake, 0% downloaded since adding magnet link 24 hours ago.  don't waste your time or aggravation"
