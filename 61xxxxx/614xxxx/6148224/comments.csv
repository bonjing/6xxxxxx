,StepRazor,2011-02-07T16:41Z,"""The content is important not the form...""  ???  The so-called protocols have been proven to be a fake/forgery for well over 125 years!!!  Are you posting this shit for ""entertainment"" purposes, or a far more obvious nefarious intent?"
,DragonKP,2011-02-09T06:32Z,"Sure that content is important!!!

It is NOT proven that protocols are forgery !!! Look around and see what's going on and compare with protocols - for me if it quacks like a duck then it's rather duck and not an eagle.

Check this info so maybe you will be enlighted a little bit.

I agree with him:
In my opinion, the outlawing of Protocols on pain of death in Bolshevik Russia and its execration in the West today proves its authenticity.

On the other hand it looks like another keeper of purity of thought and political correctness opened his mouth here. I do not think it's place here for discussions - just download what you like and do not bother others to download what they want (by the way - you DID NOT POST A SINGLE TORRENT - another Pro-Zionist police thug sticking nose around the net?)

Bye!"
,StepRazor,2011-03-03T10:22Z,"Of course I haven't posted a torrent ... with this username.  I use other user-ids for that.  And no, I am not ""another Pro-Zionist police thug sticking nose around the net"".  I'm not Jewish, I too hate ""police thugs"" (most other police as well).  I'm not a ""keeper of purity of thought and PC"", I just have this dirty habit of questioning everything - extensively, and I don't think people should pass off faux documents as historical fact 'cause, well, I've done my research on the subject quite a bit in fact.  And I came to the conclusion that its a ridiculous fake.  But most simply, I'm just not a mouth-breather like you.  You're just another jingoistic propagandist with an agenda of hate.  "
,DragonKP,2011-03-16T17:41Z,"So you got at least this right - these books are posted here for anyone's own research and if you have working brain you can sift out what's true and ring a bell with you.

And questioning everything is basis for so called critical thinking what you lack in your comment. Better learn about Trivia first (I suggest you put stress on second art - Logic)."

Pretyy damn incriminating regarding thei intentions and METHODS.  "
