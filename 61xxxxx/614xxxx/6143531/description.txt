"What works:
-Graphics acceleration
-Accelerometer
-Wireless!
-Touchscreen
-Buttons
-Sleep/Wakeup stuff

Doesn't work:
-Sound (sadly! Despite my efforts the last hours I didn't get it working properly yet)
-DSP e.g. no hardware video decoding

The whole thing is based on the honeycomb emulator images, the B&N V1.1 kernel+modules+driver, pieces from the upcoming CM7 and manual patching ARM assembler in libraries and writing ugly scripts to hack around various issues.


Use this on your own risk! I'm not responsible for any damages!

The unzipped image is around 4gb. I use it on a 8gb sd-card. In principle the image should work on a 4gb card."
