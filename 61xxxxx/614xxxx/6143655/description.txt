The Cars - Let's Go [promo].avi


HQ very rare promo music video. "Let's Go" was the first single from The Cars' album Candy-O released in 1979. It was written by Ric Ocasek and features lead vocals by Cars bassist Ben Orr. The single peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the U.S., but the song was an even bigger success elsewhere. In Canada, the track reached #5, and remains the Cars' highest ever charting single in that country. Similarly, in Australia "Let's Go" peaked at #6, and remains The Cars' highest charted hit in that country.

The song's signature hook, a series of claps followed by a shouted "Let's go!" is derived from the 1962 instrumental of the same name by The Routers.

The song tells the story of a 17-year old girl and her budding interest in "the nightlife". It is told from the perspective of a teenage boy who wishes to ask her out for a date. She refuses any and all of his advances.

The Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the early New Wave music scene in the late 1970s. The band consisted of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The band originated from Boston, Massachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records in 1977.

The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s.

On October 21, 2010, The Cars confirmed that they have reunited and are recording their first album in 23 years. Greg Hawkes will fill in on bass for Benjamin Orr, who died in 2000. (Source: Billboard)
