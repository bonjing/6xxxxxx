,g-apple,2011-06-07T10:21Z,"I lack the words Malikjee to praise your passion and devotion to Hindi Classical Cinema. You are reviving an age. The more I write, the more it is less considering your magnanimous efforts.
God bless you."
,bigdump,2011-06-07T21:52Z,this page incorrectly states that this movie has english subtitles.... there are no subtitles....
,many4me,2012-06-13T19:35Z,"Hi MalikJee, After watching a lot of English Classics, I thought of watching gems from our own industry. Seeing you sharing many classics, I see I can pursue my interest. Thanks Sir for the great Job and I will seeding whatever I will be downloading that u shared."
