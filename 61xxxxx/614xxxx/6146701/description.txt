All my discogs feature 500x500 album art, and 100% complete % accurate tags (a best as possible)

Ozzy!! Needs no introduction!

This is a mostly complete Ozzy Discog, I did not include all the live albums, as its just rehashed stuff, when I complete a Discog, I try to have as little redundant content as possible.

Studio Albums
1. Blizzard of Oz*
2. Diary Of A Madman*
3. Bark At The Moon
4. Ultimate Sin
5. No rest For The Wicked
6. No More Tears

9. Black Rain (Tour Edition)**
10 Scream  (Tour Edition)**

Limited Ed. Numbered Promo Only:
The No More Tears Demo Sessions,
Track 6: Mrs. J, (Zakk Wylde Instrumental)

# of * is note#

Note 1: These are the '95 Remasters. NOT the 2002 re-issues with re-recorded drum/bass. But I also include the bonus songs from  
        the re-issues. I know this because I ripped it personally from my own copy, which was purchased way before 2002.
Note 2: Alternate Cover Arts included here.
Note 3: Only those that do not contain content elsewhere in the Discog
Note 4: With the Exception of 3 songs, this is basically the same as disc 4 in "Prince" Box, I included "Changes" in it as the 
        Jap release contains it. And don't knock this release, Ozzy did it as a bonus, in spare time between shows. Sony only 
        wanted to release the 1st 3 Discs. He feels his fans have been screwed over by the record company. Sony, another Evil 
        empire.
Note 5: I have included full size cover arts here as well.

Enjoy, please help me Seed!
