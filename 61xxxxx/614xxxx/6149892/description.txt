Hello my fellow Pirates!!!


iNet shows the devices connected to your local network, e. g. com put er or router, along with their name, IP and vendor. You can find out the name, vendor and IP of the con nect ed devices as well as the kind and number of running Bonjour ser vices on that par tic u lar device. You can also perform a classic portscan on the choosen device.



ENJOY!!!
