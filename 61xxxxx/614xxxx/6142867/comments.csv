Lawnchair Generals are present in the older releases ;)

And I don't care for labels. As long as the music is good, it doesn't matter to me on what label it is"
,totaljackin,2011-02-06T13:12Z,Good call lol look forward to your next upload cheers

,littleplumber,2011-03-10T06:43Z,"Hey man this is ridiculously good!!!! THX a tonne. Question for ya... I have a mix that the dj refuses to give up even what a single track of it. its from 2006 so trax will be from right around that period im assuming.  Its a little older but exactly this type of stuff. I was wondering if I could get it to ya and maybe you could recognize some of it. I got a few but im new to this style of music. One track is (wes - make with the names) I cant find it anywhere haha, Do you possibly have it?? I mostly Dj tech house, but love anything funky!!  "

I'm pretty bad at track IDs, but I can try if you post it somewhere...

@ splatmonki

When I'm ready :P"

Also, you can try your luck over at the Track ID forum of Discogs. I also have there a thread going for almost a year now. It's a very active forum so chances are, you'll get some IDs

,littleplumber,2011-03-11T22:13Z,"Thx man. I posted it up there with a link.

I took a listen but could only ID one track at 29:40... it's Body Perspective from the Oriental Funk Stew. That track is present in this edition of my house torrents ;)

Sorry, couldn't ID any others. About the Discogs thread, make sure to bump it up after 5 days if you get no replies. If you bump it before 5 days, chances are you'll get the thread locked by a mod. I had that once happen and had to contact a mod to unlock it."

Mate if you can get the mix to me I can see if I can ID some for ya my mate has been in this for years and has got tracks that just blow me away all the time so chances are he has got em  "
,frogski,2011-03-12T18:13Z,"@totaljackin
