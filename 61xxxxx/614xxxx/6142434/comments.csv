Aside from that though does ANYBODY know when will a friggin patch be released?Cause Late Night Brought a GAzillion bugs and i noticed that this Stuff pack didn't come with patching priority!"
,weezell,2011-02-02T03:44Z,Thanks man!  Took a while for me to download but will seed for a while.  Great file.  Keep up the good work!
,sizlac,2011-02-02T04:39Z,"For everyone lost on where the Fairlight folder is.. it is on the iso, just explore it.  Also inside that folder, the 'flt-s3ol' file is the keygen."

,Z3tth,2011-02-02T18:01Z,"Hey, can some1 write down the keygen? My norton keeps blocking the flt-s3ol file. Btw.

,SatansSprite,2011-02-02T20:15Z,"to RhymesMatter:

There is a difference between this and Late Night. Late Night was a full EXPANSION pack, introducing a new city, new careers, vampires and many other things. Outdoor Living is only a STUFF pack, just simply introducing new items to use inside the worlds. It has a very small chance of causing any major problems."
,asp8807,2011-02-02T22:11Z,help when i try to do the update it keeps telling me update error invalid file found then it says set up has detected that the installed region for this up date is incorrect update requires a different game region in order to be installed
,mpark90,2011-02-02T23:35Z,"Sorry to be a bit blond.. but im new to all this

where are these files? :S

sorry and thanks for great torrent, im seeding


----------------------

It means, in order to no-cd crack your sims you have to replace content in C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Outdoor Living Stuff\Game\Bin 
with the content from the fairlight folder which is located in the folder you extracted from this torrent. (Mine is at: C:\Users\Kasutaja\Desktop\New folder\Fairlight)"
,Eliise258,2011-02-03T11:47Z,"^Oh and it's better if you don't replace the files, but switch there places for safe keeping of both of them. When updating your game, you may need them to be the original files, if not it may or may not give an error: corrupted files."
,Eliise258,2011-02-03T11:49Z,"^Oh, and it's better if you don't just replace them, but keep both the files and there counterparts.
Losing them may or may not give you an error of corrupt files when updating your game."
,leyea,2011-02-03T22:21Z,"Thanks for the download, it works and I installed with the keygen left from Z3tth.
This file was so messy though, I had to dig through the files to figure out which one was actually to be installed. 
Thanks again! I love free games :D"

,tysfamily,2011-02-07T01:27Z,"It's easy Burn  ""flt-s3ol' ISO to a DL DVD or Mount the ""flt-s3ol' ISO with Daemon Tools or Power ISO.
Install the game.
Open the ""Fairlight"" Folder which is on the DVD or Mounted ISO
The keygen is in side of the Fairlight Folder
Itâ€™s ""flt-s3ol""

Copy the crack content from the Fairlight folder (Which is on the ISO) to your addon
install folder GameBin , overwrite original files
Play
 But a Mini Image would be so much nicer so that the game could still be updated with out reinstalling the next time a new Exspantion came out."

,thebeav111,2011-02-12T08:00Z,"tysfamily: for any game you crack, save the original files, takes 2 seconds, and saves a long reinstall (just move the originals back to update, then get new crack).  Mind you doesn't work if they don't crack the updates..."

All this is is a pack of junk D: It would be cool if we could get just the items and their scripts instead of all kinds of updates to the other games and crap. Why can't they just release it as a ""stuff"" pack instead of a whole new EP that is not an EP? I just don't have the space anymore for this D:"

,Dave_247,2011-04-05T15:41Z,"Thanks, works fine.
You can update the game and the expansion packs as long as you can find cracks for the updates, which there are out there.
Just keep the orignal exe and dll files otherwise it will complain if you try to update."

,gandlaftheslightlypurple,2011-07-05T19:35Z,"Thanks works great will seed for a month

to philly12: 

All i could suggest is keeping the files deleting the torrent and reloading it into your torrent handler and force recheck the downloaded files, if the problem persists the only thing you can try is to totally re-download

Hope this helps

Happy hunting

,aeristilheartly,2012-05-22T21:52Z,"ALRIGHT listen up here people who are having problems, this is what you do!!!!

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!
