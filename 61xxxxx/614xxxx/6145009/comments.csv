Speaking for myself, ChattChitto is an uploader who I trust as I have used plenty of his stuff. While I respect others who can do this sort of thing please dont try and dictate who can or cannot upload as it takes away from what sites like this do for others. This guy does great work across the board so try and show a little gratitude.
Thanks for the up CC"
,PI0XMATE,2011-02-02T12:02Z,Fantastic CC ! Thanks a million :D
,onelittledinky,2011-02-03T07:22Z,"Hello and ty for another great torrent!  normally i dont comment but i figured i would because ive been Dl your torrents for a very long time and they are just awesome and easy to use.  i have a question as well there is a program which is not available on this site that has a free Dl but not cracked and has a hefty price tag called Java Obfuscator DashO - 3.2 link to free dl is below.

look up any movie, there are tons of everything and some of them are bad, like the one you're linking.  get off your high horse and try something that works"
,LouCipher,2011-02-05T11:34Z,"@theuploader9999  You must be new around here, otherwise you would know how highly regarded ChattChitto is and how many ppl will happily wait for an up from him before downloading some other rubbish"

,djpark1,2011-03-07T00:21Z,"When I go through the steps it does not work for me.  I get that the version is not licensed and stuff.

I also have no .key or .chk file to go in and delete.  

I am running Windows 7 64bit"
