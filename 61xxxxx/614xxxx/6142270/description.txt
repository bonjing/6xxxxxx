Amelia's Dream's second album, Love Tattoo, picks up where Here in the Rage left off, showcasing singer/songwriter Amelia's clear, expressive soprano and thoughtful lyrics on songs like "Push the Button," "Honey-Dream," "Footprints," and "Trust Your Gut." The group's update of Santana's "Evil Ways" is another highlight of the album, which will please fans of Lilith Fair artists as well as classic female singer/songwriters.
