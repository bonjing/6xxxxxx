,Dogcoat,2011-01-31T16:54Z,Over 4000 downloaders and 6 comments come on guys whats it like A? V?
,Oinkycane,2011-01-31T17:43Z,"V-8...I don't think so.  It's a cam, good quality cam, but still a cam.  "
,vsjane,2011-01-31T18:13Z,"Rating a TS, insightful one and not a rip; only morons confuse apples with oranges..."

,richardpa,2011-01-31T20:41Z,"Ok CAM copy and a fast download...
A/6
V/6
There's focus and flickering issues and the audio is pretty tinny and echoic plus the image has been badly cropped too...
Many Thanx to TvTeam and TOXiC-iNK for the effort and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
,idkeither,2011-01-31T21:54Z,its 2011.. invest in HD camera. =)
,enrique1988,2011-02-01T02:43Z,yea its 2011 investing in a hd cam is great but if u really want a good copy go watch it in threaters or go buy urself one and get ur own copy =-]
,itzMarco,2011-02-01T03:16Z,"its 2011.. invest in the movie if u really want to watch it.. if not this is good enough
Y is it that all of the torrents for this movie are dead

,rayzoredge,2011-02-01T04:42Z,"Thanks, TvTeam keep up the great work."
,piazza7,2011-02-01T10:24Z,this quality is a disgrace
,Vacum66,2011-02-01T11:43Z,Thanx TvTeam!
,Ambisane,2011-02-01T13:54Z,"A - 8 (Very Clear and quite loud), V - 5 ( blured a little) but definatly watchable quality."
,idkeither,2011-02-01T23:15Z,HAHAHA @ my response on the HD cam.. see the whole point of comming to TPB was not to spend any MONEY just to watch a movie. 
,abcdcy,2011-02-02T01:46Z,Thank you TvTeam!
,camo12345,2011-02-02T08:19Z,"All calm down, I read the comments for quality purposes but on every single movie I see you people insulting each other. If someone says something that insults you, don't write back insulting them, that's exactly what they want! The only reason they come here is start an online argument because that's how they get their sexual release. Don't give them the pleasure and just shut up.

Movie: 

A - 8 It's clear but not perfect

V - 7 I'm saying 7 because it's a cam and its pretty decent video for a cam."
,DarthExile,2011-02-02T12:52Z,just get a 50 inch and then these cams look great thankgod for TVTEAM they should ad a donate button on pirate bay so i can give some chips to TVteam thanks for all the great work and saving me thousands on fresh media

,IanNS7,2011-02-09T11:17Z,"TVTeam, you were quick as hell uploading Fighter, True Grit, and Mechanic.  All your work is appreciated by everyone.  I had a favor to ask.  I'm living in Korea and I don't want to have Scream 4 ruined on me.  Korean theatres won't get the film until about a month after it's initial release.  Are you able to upload a really good rip of the movie close to it's release, or aren't you?  If y"

V-4/10
A-7/10"
,googaloop,2011-02-16T12:03Z,"I guess no-one notice that the movie stops short. If feels like it should end soon, but that was a little too soon."
,googaloop,2011-02-16T12:06Z,"BTW- anyone recieving annoying letters from Comcast threatening to take away your service, two things you can do.  Look up the EFF online, electronic frontier foundation- they have a form letter that basically tells comcast they can fuck off, cos' it ain't illegal. The other thing to do, change your settings so that is encrypted peers only on your torrent software."
,datanyc00,2011-02-17T13:01Z,"To: allymoy  

All you need to do is use peerblock. Read up on and you would be okay. "
,dr_niggles,2011-02-19T04:47Z,My dumbass forgot to start up peerblock and got a few copyright infringement letters.. but it works when I remember to run it lol
,jake3436,2011-02-28T00:31Z,"LACYWEST@

Comcast can not monitor what you download. Its illegal. Some companies can see what sites you go to but it can not see what you download."
,Munchgin,2011-03-11T23:22Z,"After being caught and having my internet shut down for a few days.. I have chose to use ""Peer Guardian"" and works great... Also changed my ISP.. Now with comcast and so far so good.. Have blocked over 104 P2P's!  Screw all those torrent downloading haters!"
,gtx580,2011-03-13T18:03Z,"I have been using this site for years.
I had to register to tell you that this torrents audio is absolutely not okay.
There is a constant buzzing all the time!!!!"
,drmonkeyboy,2011-03-22T20:36Z,yeah worst R5 i've ever encountered
