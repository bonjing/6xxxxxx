,rickyno1,2011-02-01T15:37Z,"Thanks for the spoiler. Come on guys, not everyone has seen the rumble yet. Leave comments for quality and so on eh!"
,afgaviria,2011-02-01T16:23Z,"its a shame the low quality of this avi, but it is watchable"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-02-01T16:50Z,"Heres the problem if you claim we are spoiling the rumble, you just downloaded the ultimate spoiler, they tell you everything about the previous ppv on raw, so you can't be complaining to them cuz you're downloading raw."
,rickyno1,2011-02-02T16:13Z,i download them both and then watch then as there only afew hours apart. so posting results you are spoiling you dumb fuck. not everyone can watch them the minute it airs and downloading and seeding as soon as possible helps everyone else. look at the facts before giving a weak excuse for your stupidity
,traineetorrent,2011-02-03T07:52Z,"@rickyno1

,rickyno1,2011-02-04T16:29Z,just pointing out a fact is all. so no need to chill
