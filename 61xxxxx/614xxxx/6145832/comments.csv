,anilm3,2011-02-03T20:22Z,"Hi Meech thanks for you great uploads!

Is star trek enterprise in your list of future uploads?
"
[V],meech,2011-02-03T22:14Z,"Yes, most likely.  Just not on the immediate future list.  There are some bluray torrents out there for Enterprise if you're looking for some good quality rips.  However, I may do it in the future just to round out the Star Trek genre...and for those who want smaller size than bluray, but better quality than the standard 350mb xvid rips.

Next is a non-sci-fi cop series called The Shield (if you like Sons of Anarchy, you would probably like The Shield).  All seasons are already ripped and encoded, so it should go up quickly.  After that is Quantum Leap which I already started ripping.  So once again, they shouldn't take too long.  Other future ideas are Smallville, Dr. Who (original), Stargate Atlantis, maybe the original Outer Limits (if I can find dvds).  That should keep me busy for a while.  To anyone hoping I'd do Babylon 5...sorry...don't shoot me...but I just couldn't get into that series for some reason.   Thanks for commenting on my torrents.  Enjoy!"
,anilm3,2011-02-03T22:56Z,"Great!

I'm looking forward to it!"
,unbreak11,2011-02-04T00:05Z,"please consider doing the enterprise ones too... its only 3 seasons... and I will have the complete collection in your very good format!

I was avoiding wathing enterprise but IF you make your version, I will watch it!

Thanks for the last season of voyager I was really anticipating it!"

,uthacalthing,2011-02-04T11:40Z,"Hi meech,

Thanks again for all of the fantastic rips you've done, I have almost all of them now (took me almost two months), and they are all top notch!

And yes, I've seeded them past 1:1 to anyone asking.

I'd like to second unbreak11's request for Enterprise.  I'm starting to run out of space on my home server (the 370 Gigabytes of meech releases I've collected lately might have something to do with it :-), so I don't really want the full BluRay rips, nice though they might be... if I have to spend money on another hard disk just to fit them in, then I might as well just go and buy the box set...

And, of course, Atlantis, when you're ready :-)

Thanks again, in my book you're the best uploader here at the Bay... (with raymondhome a close second)"
[V],meech,2011-02-05T15:09Z,"Oh...I also forgot to add...that I will be doing Sliders in the future too for any fans of that show.  It was slightly cheesy, but I remember enjoying it, and I haven't seen it in a while.  I have some misc movies I want to put up in between...but just wanted to let you know that Sliders is on the list as well."
,Duder82,2011-02-06T03:32Z,"Thanks!

Heh, Sliders. I remember watching a few episodes here and there, neat that it's on the list.

One thing that I'd like to suggest is Stephen King's The Stand, from 1994. It's a miniseries, so if at some point you feel like taking a break from these long running series', that might be a good one.

Another really good miniseries is The Lost Room."
,sammaful,2011-02-09T00:40Z,noooooo meech how could you not get in to babylon 5 it was awesome :-) also meech im blaming you for the fact your awesomeness has made me finish of filling up my 1.5tb external drive :-p will have to order a 2 tb now hehe
,piper1,2011-02-10T10:48Z,Awesome work meech. Thanks.
,mupphead,2011-02-10T22:01Z,Hey Meech your work is amazing and I really appreciate all the work and effort you put into it. I wiil be looking forward to the Smallville torrents better than the rest. I would like to ask bout a couple series that I've been looking for and can't find. It sort of old school. They are Xena: Warrior Princess and the Hercules. Any help finding them I would be deeply grateful.
,dormany,2011-02-13T16:52Z,Do you have all 5 seasons of Sliders on dvd? I know the 5th season was only released in germany. Very rare. I have never come across dvdrip of that season yet.
,4k7,2011-02-24T20:04Z,thank you
,leptoone,2011-03-27T07:38Z,Gah I wasted two days downloading this... Thanks for the annoying ass subtitles.
,Sith_Lord_13,2011-03-27T13:52Z,"@leptoone

You can turn off the subtitles you know. So don't be a jerk to someone who's doing us all a favor.

@Meech
Thanks man. You're awesome."
,canopener,2011-06-14T17:32Z,"+1!! Thanks for these excellent rips!! All 7 seasons of them.

One small complaint - wish all 7 seasons were in one large torrent so that it would last longer. I have a feeling a season here or there will not have enough seeders to sustain them.

Thanks again!!!"
,lpop64,2011-07-06T12:51Z,Great series and nice rip ! Thanks for the upload meech !
,reacharound,2011-09-12T04:22Z,beautiful!
,SwedishMeatball,2011-10-17T17:20Z,"Meech: 
Thank you for the wonderful torrents. I have only watched the first episode and it is awesome. Keep doing single season torrents, it makes life much easier. However, might you be able to do a torrent of the extras for the entire series?

Downloaders:
My first few downloads, I was concerned about exceeding my data allocations or slowing the downloads by using uploading for the available bandwidth. I set the uploads to 1kb/sec max.

I found out that my provider wasn't going to slow down or stop my internet access and that it did not affect my downloading speeds. So, I opened the uploads up fully. 

The other side of this is that I have noticed a huge percentage of leechers. I am seeding everything that I have downloaded, until I reach at least 2/1 ratio. Please give back to the community! Trek attitude says to give as much as you can, because it makes you a better person!

My uploads are set to unlimited, most of the time, on torrents I have completed.

The ones I am still downloading, I am throttling the upload back, if my download speed is less than my upload speed. So, if you are downloading this torrent, set the upload limits to 0 (zero) so they are unlimited! I will respond in kind!"
