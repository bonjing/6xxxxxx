,tre.fire,2011-04-12T16:48Z,"this morning (my time) 40 people have 98.2% of this, which would be workable if there weren't so many incomplete files. rudilocke, can't you make this more available? It would probably take 10 minutes for another 30 to get all the files and then at least 2 people, myself included, would make it available for a while. The rest will of course grab and run like most do on thepiratebay (most of whom are the most vocal supporters of the site...), but a couple of us will keep the files going."
