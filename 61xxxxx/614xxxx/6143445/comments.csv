this is all i can get for you"
,Snowwie888,2011-02-02T02:48Z,"Thanks so much, if you wouldn't cap this, we couldn't see the series at all. 

Except for the other 500mb+ low res crappy upload. 

You should try Virtual Dub, it is so easy to get out the commercials because you can select to the frame. And the program is very easy to use. Start Virtual Dub, load your (raw) video, press HOME for the start mark and END for the end mark. Press delete to remove that part. Select video, full processing mode, select your video codec (xvid, divx whatever) and do the same to the audio codecs. Very easy to work with. "
,freeholay,2011-02-02T05:33Z,"You know... I kinda figured OCC was on it's last legs when Jr. was strangely sent on his own and the law suits seemed to be designed to isolate Jr.'s business holdings. This isn't the first time that OCC pulled this kind of stunt as a decade ago they did something similar when their iron works business was going under and they magically bought all their own bankrupted stock for almost nothing.

Hmmmm something smells fishy and I wouldn't be surprised to see the Tuetals buy out OCC under Jr.'s banner and make another killing by questionable business tactics."
,brassN,2011-02-02T07:23Z,"Absolutely. The way both sides almost seemed working in sync to advertising PJD while trashing OCC's reputation is suspicious at best.

Mikey, who doesn't work for a living, did not side with Daniel on the matters of OCIW. Why side with Jr now and get cut off by his parents? His own employment and income situations did not change. "
,Ward.,2011-02-05T16:52Z,"Personally I think there trying to make out that jr's 20% is worth nothing to get it back without paying out. 

ps thnks for the up xD"
,Quark-F,2011-02-08T21:45Z,"merci
