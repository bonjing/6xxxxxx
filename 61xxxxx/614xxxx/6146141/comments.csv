,jeromycraig,2011-02-08T05:15Z,"Yes, because with a name like ""Hatchet II"", OBVIOUSLY you should go into it expecting the next ""Citizen Kane""."

,zookap,2011-04-10T02:24Z,"Of course this movie is stupid. Did anyone see the first? It is the kind of movie that you watch when you are too stoned to even follow the story, not when you are looking for a ""good"" movie. This, being the sequel, is expected to have an even DUMBER story. Not one person downloading this is expecting it to be ""good."" "
