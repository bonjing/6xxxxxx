KNOWN ERRORS & LIMITATIONS
â€¢ Software downgrade with Tucson system is only possible for BB 5.0 products supporting the Data
Package 2 concept.
â€¢ Flashing with setup FLS-5, SS-46 and product specific adapter is not supported anymore
â€¢ If you install old DCT-4 data packages, Flash Update Package File installation path may be wrong. This
is caused by very old DCT-4 data packages which contain Flash Update Package and overwrite current
information during installation. If you experience problems when updating FPS-x prommers, please
check that Phoenix â€œPrommer maintenanceâ€ is looking for the files from the correct location which is
â€œC:\Program Files\Common Files\Nokia\Tss\Flashâ€. If not, Phoenix will show error â€œUpdate via ini â€“ file
failedâ€. In this case, select â€œUpdateâ€ from that Phoenix â€œPrommer maintenanceâ€ â€“ UI, browse to correct
directory and select â€œfpsxupd.iniâ€ for all other prommers except the FPS-8.
â€¢ Refurbishment flashing and product code change for RX-51 product requires SX-4 card to be available
â€¢ FPS-21 flashing for RX-51 works only with TCPIP connection. FPS-21 prommer with new HW version
is needed to correct this, and it is estimated to be available by the end of 2010
â€¢ Please refer to product specific documents and instructions concerning the limitations of the RX-51
product
â€¢ RX-51 flashing does not work when CU-4 is used
â€¢ RX-51 Product Code changes work only without FLASH option, please flash phone separately
â€¢ When version 2010_12_8_42304 or newer with FUSE connection manager is installed on top of older
Phoenix versions, there may be an additional delay of several minutes when you start Phoenix for the
first time. Please wait patiently; Phoenix will start after configuration is finished.
â€¢ When using Data Package download functions with online connection, download times may
occasionally be long. This is not caused by Phoenix (or Care Suite). The download speed from online
servers is occasionally is known to be slow, depending on how data is buffered on caching servers.
â€¢ Note concerning the installation and use with Administrator and User rights
- If you install Phoenix, start Phoenix and configure connections from FUSE connection manager as
Administrator, you may not be able to start Phoenix after you log off and try to use Phoenix with User
Rights afterwards

- Log on as Administrator
- Deleted Fuse folder and its contents from: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
Data\Nokia\
- After this Fuseâ€™s connection list will be empty and it can be used directly with guest/admin rights.
- This has to be done only once.
â€¢ After you close Phoenix, it may not restart. To rectify this:
- Use Windows Task Manager to manually shut down phoenix.exe and FuseService.exe processes, or
optionally restart your PC
â€¢ Mass memory content file flashing does not work for all products over USB â€“ FPS-10 or FPS-21 Flash
Prommer must be used!
