,ThreatSignalQc,2011-03-06T12:02Z,Noob... 1920x800=1080p... Black bars are counted as pixels.  The movie was filmed in that ratio cuz it allows for more to be recorded from left to right rather than cutting off some of the width to create the same ratio and fit the screen properly.  Same shit as when you had Â«widescreenÂ» dvds...  Do some research before saying dumb shit like that.
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-03-09T18:03Z,"@bajbaja the resolution is about height and width. When a movie is presented in widescreen the height may be smaller aka letterbox, this is def 1080p. I also prefer the native 1280x720 (720p) and 1920x1080 (1080p) res over the letterbox format but it's up to the film makers. 

Thanks for the up!!!"
