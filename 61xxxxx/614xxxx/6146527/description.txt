A music video for the single was shot and directed by Chris Robinson. The president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine, told MTV News, "We're still trying to work out the date for the next video with [Nicki] and Drake for the 'Moment 4 Life' video. That's the next project." "Moment 4 Life" is the first music video shot in a string of music videos to be released for promotion. In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating "Obviously, Drake and I, weâ€™ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so people have come to be kind of intrigued about us and itâ€™s where weâ€™re shooting the video together. So I was like, there has to be some sort of romantic storyline. Itâ€™s Drake and me." Drake additionally added "I mean, itâ€™s a fantasy video. Youâ€™ve got a very regal environment, and youâ€™ve got Nicki doing what she doesâ€”big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. Iâ€™m not going to lie to you. The twist of it, the concept of it, I donâ€™t want to give it all away."
