,xxRipperxx96,2011-02-05T09:39Z,ap25?
,dragongfx,2011-02-05T12:48Z,"It,s not AP25. And the game working like charm. "
[V],Morck22,2011-02-05T14:45Z,"@salazam our Black Ops works fine for the 99,99% users that download it.

@FucHollywood for sure, 2 weeks aprox."
,zenman76,2011-02-05T15:55Z,"@salazam there was an update that ""blocked"" Black-Ops, MW2 and Reach for anyone using back up discs. Are you sure this is not what caused your problem

If so, the solution is to simply run the original ISO(s) through abgx and create a new DVD file. 

I never got a bad file from Morck22 (and should have offered thanks by now also.. So, many thanks man) "
