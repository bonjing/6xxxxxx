Planet Calypso is a colonist MMORPG with a real economy

You are invitied into the future to join an open-ended social, economic and political action-adventure as a human colonist on a distant alien planet. Explore over 1500 square kilometers, developing more than 200 unique skills, as you follow you own unique story with others from around the world.

You will enter a new chapter in CalypsoÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s story. After an exhausting five year conflict with an invading robot enemy, the long awaited promise of peace and prosperity on Calypso remains elusive. With the robots mostly repelled to their home world Akbal-Cimi, cracks in colonist solidarity are emerging.
 
The war-time economy has produced industrialists with the resources to buy up CalypsoÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s precious land, while disgruntled ex-soldiers are left to wander Calypso, hunting and mining for their survival.
 
Have you got what it takes to stake a claim on Calypso?

This is a pretty awesome game but they have some problems with the downloader, so I created this torrent to combat the download problems for others who are trying to play this game.
