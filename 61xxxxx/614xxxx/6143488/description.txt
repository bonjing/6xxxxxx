Kristian Vikernes was born on the 11th of February 1973 at 21:58 in Bergen, Norway. In 1993, he legally changed Kristian to Varg and later started to use the name Varg Qisling LarssÃ¸n Vikernes as his pen-name. Varg, which means "wolf", says that he''s related to the Quisling family, a name that even became an international word for "traitor" (similar to "Judas") after Vidkun Quisling, a Norwegian political leader during the second world war, who founded a collaborationist pro-Nazi government.
