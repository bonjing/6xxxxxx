WikiLeaks.ch CableGate update for February 3rd, 2011 (1:58 AM).  For some reason WikiLeaks has released three archives already today, at 12:10 AM, 12:50 AM, and 1:58 AM.  The Pirate Bay also happened to be down at that time, so I'm going to skip uploading the first two, but I'll still seed(box) them.


This cablegate-201102030158.7z file is 8.24 MB (8,642,637 bytes) in size, and expands to 271 MB (284,312,020 bytes), containing 4,816 files in 137 folders.

If you're seeding an older CableGate torrent, seed this instead.  The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html

If you run a local WikiLeaks "pull" / "scrape" mirror (search P2P networks for "wikileaks scrape"), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or p7zip for any operating system.

The bad guys can put up blocks to all known / major HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!
