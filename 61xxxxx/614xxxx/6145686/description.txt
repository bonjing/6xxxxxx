Violent clashes broke out just before our broadcast when supporters of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak attacked anti-government protesters in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Reports are that more than 100 people have been injured. "The entire square is surrounded by thugs, and more are on their way," reports Egyptian activist Nazly Hussein. "I have seen people come out injured â€¦ coming into the medical center injured." We get live reports from Hussein and Democracy Now!'s senior producer Sharif Abdel Kouddous who are both in Cairo.


- Voices of the Egyptian Revolution: Democracy Now!'s Sharif Abdel Kouddous Speaks with Demonstrators in Tahrir Square at "March of Millions"

"We are one hand together": More than a million Egyptians throughout the country, the majority in Tahrir Square, celebrate their show of unity and continue their call for immediate change to their government. "Finally, I feel this is my country, not the country of the police or the ruling elite. I'm really proud to be an Egyptian today."


- As Mubarak Pledges To Finish Term, Egyptian Protesters Stay in Streets Demanding Immediate End to Regime: Democracy Now! Reports Live from Cairo

Democracy Now!'s senior news producer Sharif Abdel Kouddous reports live just blocks from Tahrir Square in Cairo where supposed pro-Mubarak crowds are descending on the peaceful demonstrators. He interviews University of California-Davis Professor Nora Radwan about the current situation in Egypt. "The emotional response of the people on the street is we did not come here to negotiate with him, but to ask him one thing, which is to step down," Radwan said. "The Egyptians understand that there is no guarantee that Mubarak and his government can deliver any constitutional reform or any meaningful change in Egypt."


- Noam Chomsky: "This Is The Most Remarkable Regional Uprising That I Can Remember"

In recent weeks, popular uprisings in the Arab world have led to the ouster of Tunisian dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the imminent end of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime, a new Jordanian government, and a pledge by Yemen's longtime dictator to leave office at the end of his term. We speak to MIT Professor Noam Chomsky about what this means for the future of the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy in the region.
