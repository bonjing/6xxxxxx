,ednum5,2011-02-07T18:55Z,There is no such thing as Thai.dmg. The language files are the same for Mac and Win. It is the application files that are different.
,P33P3RS,2011-02-08T14:58Z,How do i install this (i know it sounds retarded) do i just burn each disk dmg to a disk? I am using the latest version of rosetta :)
