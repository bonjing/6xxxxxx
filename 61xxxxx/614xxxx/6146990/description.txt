John Boorman's epic version of the King Arthur legend takes all the important elements - the sword in the stone, the Knights of the Round Table, the quest for the Holy Grail, the love between Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot - and holds them together in a single sweeping story. Nicol Williamson stars as a camp Merlin and Helen Mirren makes a suitably sinister Morgana, but the most memorable aspects of the film are its art direction and cinematography.
