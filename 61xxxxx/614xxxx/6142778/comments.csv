,Jadeite12,2011-02-03T06:40Z,Hi! Thanks for the upload! Could you tell me if even though this was meant for a recovery can I still use it as a normal Windows 7 installation disk? Is it preactivated and will it remain that way?
,bflorin,2011-02-03T11:04Z,"yes! you can use it for installation, u can select what language to use for installation, it has English, French, German, Romanian, and a ""few"" more. It's activated on first boot and has logo and dell themes,i haven't used it yet because i had the operating system installed, but i browsed the DVD and i saw that it's genuine dell and will be activated automatically. If you have any problems please reply and I'll help you!"
