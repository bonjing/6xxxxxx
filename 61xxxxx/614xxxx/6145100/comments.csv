,jobriathboy,2011-02-08T22:25Z,"doesn't seem to work for me :(  followed instructions, registered the key after install with program not running and no net connection... got this message when i restarted anydvd:

""This version is not licensed.  Please install a valid license key.

Registered to [name] [email address]
Serial: 12827009 Free updates until: 5/28/2011""

only options were to order, or cancel, which shut the program down.

am i doing something wrong here?"

@scurvypirate1234, @jobriathboy

Do a search for ""anydvd.chk"" and delete it or rename it (I renamed it to anydvd2.chk just in case i needed to restore things later), you will have to enable hidden files and folders. the locations are as follows:

for xp the location is:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk

for vista:
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

for windows 7 the location is:
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

Make sure the Program is closed but you have already run the initial registration (so this is once you already get that error you're talking about). Once you do this, start the program and it should work.

I had to go through a lot of versions of this and one finally had this info. I don't remember which one though, so I'm thanking all of you!"

Tried another another torrent and it worked."
,afgaviria,2011-02-24T20:49Z,"so far it seems to work fine with me, thanks"
,Zephyroz,2011-03-04T22:52Z,"Thanks for the great upload, but it seems you're found out:P The cracked key you so generously provided is now a blocked one. Good effort, though.
PS: That probably sounds sarcastic, not my intention."
,Skram0,2011-03-22T05:03Z,"Works great for me. Thanks for the upload. Follow the instructions, and remember to disable internet update checks. And don't try updates manually either, just keep it at v6.7.8.0. Run the program how it is and it'll always work."
