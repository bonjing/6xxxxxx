That depends which 88 year crack you mean. 

Is that for NIS, NAV, N360, Adobe, Cyberlink, etc etc .......... ???"

[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-02T01:09Z,"General info for everyone:
********************** 
1. The crack was tested using the included 60 days OEM trial version of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125. 
2. The crack will/may fail on the 30 days trial version of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125."

,avatar_24,2011-02-03T09:40Z,"First,thank you for the up!
Second-i have XPSP3 running on VMWare and crack is working until second or third logon to my machine.Then,after that 0 days remaining.I cannot go to settings to disable tamper and run crack again.Well,anyway i try it and now i'm sure.Norton 360 is buggy as hell!:-)No way that i'll recommend it to anyone-i'll stay with the best-KIS 2011.That's just my opinion and feedback that'll be maybe useful to someone:-)"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-03T12:41Z,"@avatar_24
On which version the crack was used?

Super Help Guide ""Rupert77"" posted two links here, and the link with the word OEM in it is 
the 60 days trial, which of course means that the other link with ESD in it is the 30 days trail.

Right now apparently ""Rupert77"" can't even tell for sure if this is beta or final, so most likely he
also doesn't know which is the 60 days and 30 days trial version of his own links.


As I earlier wrote about the crack:
1. The crack was tested using the included 60 days OEM trial version of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125. 
2. The crack will/may fail on the 30 days trial version of Norton 360 v5.0.0.125.

This torrent includes the 60 days OEM version, which I also already wrote. The 60 days OEM version is 141 MB,
and the 30 days ESD version is 106 MB. The 60 days OEM is only larger because the 30 days ESD version needs
to update the extra updates (included already in the60 days OEM) after installation. 

Except for the trial days and size both the 60 days OEM and 30 days ESD version are exactly the same. 


Note: right now Super Help Guide ""Rupert77"" must be very tired and confused about this torrent, 
so I'd suggest to let him rest for a long while. In the meanwhile maybe he'll find out on his own
if this is beta, final, or OEM, ESD, or whatever. And maybe he'll even find out the diiference
on his own. And that after all the hard work of finding two links. Anyway, sure is that it's
not an easy job .........."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-03T13:54Z,"TORRENT UPDATE INFO: 
********************

1. There's a new released 90 days ""Patch N360 5.0 By Protection"" (v1.0) - Size: 1,15 MB (1.216.101 bytes)
According to the name of the new patch, apparently ""Shady and Protection (S&P)"" are divorced, 
probably because most of their crack released so far in their young career failed. 
So maybe it's better this way ........   

2. 90 days is not worth a patch, so I ain't gonne post the new 90 days patch.

3. Some people reported that the crack included crack in this torrent expires within a few hours or days.

4. In case it's sure that crack included crack in this torrent expires within a few hours or days
this torrent will be removed as soon as possible.

5. In the meanwhile be extra warned when using the crack included in this torrent.

So I have downloaded ur NTR by Box and reinstalled N360 and applied the NTR as said and right now I am seeing 180 days of subscription. I have applied only NTR and not ur crack. I am going to update this N360 now and if tomorrow it says again 0days in the subscription area I am going to uninstall it and give a -1 on the quality. Also, during the installation, as expected I had to create a fake norton account which says the following things about my N360:


Product Name:	Norton 360
Expiration Date: Trial
Protection For:	1 PC
Remaining Activations:None  
Product Key: Not Purchased
Product Serial Number: 
Registration Date: Apr 9, 2011
Product Language: German
Hope these are okay...Just that trial is giving me an itch.

In your crack you have asked us as a precautionary measure to disable automatic update of program version. If we have to do that, I think we are putting the whole computer at risk as it like updating the AV partially. And in that case I will have to say ur crack is pretty lame and you need to work a bit harder to make things a bit more effective."

--Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.3.1 by BOX! (Works with Norton Internet Security, Norton AntiVirus and Norton 360)--

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6191150/

1. Uninstall Norton & restart.
2. Run NTR to purge norton.
3. Install Norton
4. Turn off 'Norton Tamper Protection' (it will automatically turn back on once cracked)
5. Install NTR v3.3.1 By BOX!
6. Once the crack is installed, create a Norton account to get rid of the nag or log into your account
And your DONE :-)

Its actually quite quick to do really.
