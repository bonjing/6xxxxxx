Nat King Cole
Sings The Blues (1963)

For a mild-mannered man whose music was always easy on the ear, Nat King Cole managed to be a figure of considerable controversy during his 30 years as a professional musician. From the late '40s to the mid-'60s, he was a massively successful pop singer who ranked with such contemporaries as Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, and Dean Martin. He shared with those peers a career that encompassed hit records, international touring, radio and television shows, and appearances in films. But unlike them, he had not emerged from a background as a band singer in the swing era. Instead, he had spent a decade as a celebrated jazz pianist, leading his own small group. Oddly, that was one source of controversy. For some reason, there seem to be more jazz critics than fans of traditional pop among music journalists, and Cole's transition from jazz to pop during a period when jazz itself was becoming less popular was seen by them as a betrayal. At the same time, as a prominent African-American entertainer during an era of tumultuous change in social relations among the races in the U.S., he sometimes found himself out of favor with different warring sides. His efforts at integration, which included suing hotels that refused to admit him and moving into a previously all-white neighborhood in Los Angeles, earned the enmity of racists; once, he was even physically attacked on-stage in Alabama. But civil rights activists sometimes criticized him for not doing enough for the cause.

This LP was first released in (1958) as the soundtrack to the movie "St. Louis Blues". It was re-released in 1963 as "Nat King Cole Sings The Blues". It was ripped from the latter. I have included both LP covers. Notice the misspelling of track 4 - "Friendless Blues" - referring to it as "Friendliness Blues".

The filmed version of W.C. Handy's life, St. Louis Blues, is a fictional abomination full of every bad clichÃ© that Hollywood could come up with. Its one saving grace was the dignified performance given by Nat King Cole in the lead role (even if Handy was never a singing pianist). This LP, in addition to featuring Nelson Riddle's "Overture" from the film, finds Cole singing ten of Handy's finest compositions (including "Beale Street Blues," "Careless Love" and the title song) while backed by an orchestra playing Riddle's arrangements.
