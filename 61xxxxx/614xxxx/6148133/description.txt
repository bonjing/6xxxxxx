This performance video is a collection of highlights from standup comedy routines made during a tour across America during the summer of 2002. Directed by C.B. Harding (The Osbournes), The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Movie also incorporates behind-the-scenes segments with the individual comedians. Along the same lines as The Original Kings of Comedy, but marketed toward a radically different crowd, this comedy concert headlines the top names in so-called "redneck" humor: Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy. This film arrives after the four performers spent two years on the road and released the best-selling comedy record Blue Collar Comedy Tour Live.
