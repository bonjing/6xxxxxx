Storyline:


The comedic stylings of four sort-of famous funnymen are brought to the big screen courtesy of this 2002 documentary.

Hilarious stuff here, friends and neighbors. And the laughs aren't just aimed at folks who think Caddyshack is where ma and pa park the car. 'Cause the little secret behind the #1 comedy concert of the past two years is that its topics - marriage, kids, traveling - are so universal. And so wackily warped when seen through the perspective of standout stand-ups.

This concert movie captures the fellas on stage as well as during off hours. So hunker down and catch each of the comics in a solo bit. Then see them in a kind of 4-man comedy jam. Jeff Foxworthy's "redneck", Bill Engvall's "Here's Your Sign", Ron White's bad-boy tales, Larry the Cable Guy's bumpkin yarns - they're all here. And all gall-durn funny!
