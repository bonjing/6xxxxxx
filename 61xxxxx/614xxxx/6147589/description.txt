___________  Romancing the Landscape, Part 2  ________________

by Moose Peterson

In the second part of his landscape photography course, Moose Peterson continues his tour of the southwest United States, taking shots of the beautiful buttes, spires, and mesas in Monument Valley. Join Moose in the outdoors as he takes his shots and then follow Moose at his computer, processing the images in Photoshop and Camera Raw. Along the way, Moose talks about finding your own style, one-image HDR techniques, ultra wide panoramas, his choices for gear and gadgets, black and white processing, and image processing. Let Moose teach you how to bring home the big vistas so that people at home can enjoy them through your images.
