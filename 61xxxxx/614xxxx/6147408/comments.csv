,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-03T18:19Z,"Thank you for this.  Have downloaded Jdownloader, working on JRE, understand MU reference, don't understand reference to ""one long header"" for your address (could give you mine--facebook or email or..?)"
,r-0987,2011-02-03T18:47Z,Thanks! Will you be doing Goodfellas?
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-03T18:54Z,"@azrielle: ""Long header"" is right here, on this page. It is a text and begins with ""Click on ..."". 

You need to scroll down a little (using the mouse wheel and your pointing finger) or by sliding the finger on laptop's touch-pad. More... more... more... right below the line which is comprised of many, repeated, so called ""dash"" signs. You can recognize them as they look like this - . OK? 

Now, count 8 (eight) paragraphs (lines of text grouped together) below that. Suddenly, you would spot the line beginning with
""My ""regulars"" can reach me""...
My e-mail address is right there.

Do we have learn something from this lil' exercise of many virtues we posses. I hope so. Maybe how the time I spend writing these lines cannot be brought back. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-03T18:59Z,@r-0987: Nope. Sorry.
