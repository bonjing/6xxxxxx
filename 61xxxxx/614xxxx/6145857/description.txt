Antenna Web page Design Studio 3.5.500

Antenna enables you to make great looking web sites rapidly.
Create a professional web site to promote yourself or your
company. Publish your site online or distribute on CD as an 
interactive CV. Be seen - make a good impression - get noticed!
You can create your own web pages and digital photo galleries 
in minutes, without any HTML knowledge. Antenna's powerful 
editor is entirely visual, and pixel accurate - putting you 
in control. Wherever you drag & drop text, pictures, buttons,
flash animation and movies on the page, that's exactly where 
they will appear in the web browser.When you are ready to publish
your site, you won't need to buy any additional software - 
Antenna has its own publisher built in, and it can be set to 
publish changes only, so you can update your site very quickly.
You can also create smooth gradient backgrounds and attractive 
glossy buttons without switching between applications - it's all
built in! Give yourself a competitive edge and dip your toes into
the international scene at any time - make any part of your web 
site multilingual. And if you need a hand there's a set of free 
online tutorials and expert tips, a comprehensive 100 page fully 
illustrated colour User Guide and free technical support.
