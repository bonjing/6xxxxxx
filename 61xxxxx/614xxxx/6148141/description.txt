 Mississippi, just before Pearl Harbor. Two brothers,    
 Pete, about 19 and Willie, about 10 years younger. They 
 are clearly close friends. The news arrives, and Pete   
 goes to enlist. Willie wants to come along, but is told 
 he cannot. After his brother leaves, the boy walks 30   
 miles to the nearest town, where the sheriff eventually 
 puts him on a bus to Memphis where his brother is. At   
 the recruiting office, Willie proves even more          
 determined to see his brother; eventually, sympathetic  
 Col. McKellogg takes care of him.
