,tylr,2011-02-02T07:13Z,thanks man..
,tylr,2011-02-02T07:35Z,"dude.. consider an opinion,
for movies with daring visuals, something like 'transformers'  'iron man' 'step up3' etc., a 720p is welcomed..
..similarly, for movies like 'due date'  'Enemy At The Gates' 'Devil' etc., u can release them in the similar format u had released Due date, low size.. good qualty~ its like in these movies, only the story matters and not the visuals
..id like u to reconsider doing all the movies in 720p/550mb+ , for wen i jus collect the releases in a single folder in the comp.. id like to refrain myself from deleting the old movies i've downloaded jus to accommodate new movies ive downloaded.. temme ur verdict."
