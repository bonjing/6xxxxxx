Great Lives is a BBC Radio 4 biography series. Produced in Bristol it is presented by Matthew Parris. A distinguished guest is asked to nominate the person they feel is truly deserving of the title "Great Life". Matthew and a recognised expert (a biographer, family member or fellow practitioner) are on hand to discuss the life. The programmes are 30 minutes long, broadcast at 16:30 on Tuesday and repeated at 23:00 on Friday. There are usually nine episodes in each series,

NOTE: There seems to be an issue naming these.
BBC GL site is way behind and looks like they have given up on keeping it up to date.
Radiolistings has decided to name series as he thinks they should be, and not by what the BBC are using.
