,kylebay,2011-04-11T08:51Z,@nuggster do you mean the file is damages? cause i see over 35 seeders right now and i don't think any one would seed if it was damaged ... do you have the right player for MKV files? may be that's why you can't play it .. i recommend installing k-lite mega codecs pack which include media player classic and if the file isn't corrupted then this is going to play it for you :)
,kylebay,2011-04-13T01:10Z,@nuggster  ... i just finished watching this after downloading it and it works fine on my pc and even western digital live media player... get the k-lite mega codecs pack and it should work for you too
