,sam_3971,2011-04-10T01:42Z,"Guys, you don't need a firewall for this. Just add this to your HOSTS File

127.0.0.1 activate.uniblue.com

You can get the HOSTS file via this directory: 
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\ETC\HOSTS"

,sam_3971,2011-06-01T19:42Z,"Hey guys, IK this is currently working but like most programs this connects to the internet to validate the serial at random times. I found this in the old 2010 version btw. To fix this you need to add this entry into your HOSTS file:

127.0.0.1 activate.uniblue.com



To mod your host file open notepad.exe(Right click and select ""Run as Administrator"" Vista/7) then browse for the file HOSTS in ""C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\ETC"" and add the above entry then hit save. Now your copy should not get deactivated in an event that uniblue blocks the serial."
,Lonelytravler,2011-06-20T23:23Z,"This generates a Product ID 
(PS-E9J3T-HHJSM-PV3RM-REXGT-EPJK4-PBTF4)  and is the only one you get when clicking the Serial but can't use it, says invalid ID. So at this time I find this program usless till I can find a new ID Code."
