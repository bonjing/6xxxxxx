,duckie7,2011-02-07T05:17Z,im havin the same problem davenez is havin i cant find a copy that works on ps3
,duckie7,2011-02-07T05:40Z,i tried it on my PS3 and the video file doesnt even show up cuz its a MKV!! to watch it u need a converter like ashampoo so davenez ur better off finding a psp version and watchin it on ur ps3
[T],drock232,2011-02-17T04:12Z,Like I said it works on my ps3 just fine I have it networked through my router and the movie is on my external on my computer so Idk why its not playing on yours maybe mkv doesn't play on ps3's but it plays on my ps3 just fine.
[T],drock232,2011-03-05T16:12Z,you just need the correct codecs to play it
