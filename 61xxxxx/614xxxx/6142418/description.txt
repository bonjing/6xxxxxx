A libre version of Archlinux
You've reached the website for Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, a project aiming to provide a fully free as in freedom Archlinux, the lightweight and flexible GNU/Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.
Currently we provide the official libre packages from Arch, plus our own libre replacements when necessary, all of them optimized for the i686 and x86-64 architectures.
You can find us on IRC at irc.freenode.net/#parabola.
