,lastleech,2011-08-17T01:21Z,"Thanks for seeding but I've got a problem.
Whenever I try to open iSubtitle and load a movie, the screen turns white, and the only thing i see is the subtitle. I have early 2011 macbook pro 15'.
On a 2010 iMac i used this app with no problem.
Anyone knows why? Thanks a lot"
