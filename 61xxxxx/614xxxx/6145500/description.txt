The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole

Adrian Mole (Gian Sammarco) is an adolescent schoolboy who is constantly bewildered by the trials and tribulations of teenage life.

His major worry is the increasingly precarious state of the marriage of his parents, George (Stephen Moore) and Pauline (Julie Walters).

When they're not embarrassing Adrian, they seem to devote most of their energies to destroying what's left of their relationship.

Adrian's other main concerns are his constant battle against acne, his pursuit of the lovely Pandora Braithwaite (Lindsey Stagg) and his attempts to do good by helping to look after cantankerous old Bert Baxter (Bill Fraser).
