Description
Where happily ever after is just a dream.

On a mist-shrouded rig in the sea, Krank ages prematurely because he lacks one vital function: the ability to dream. And so he kidnaps children from the harbour town, to steal their dreams. 

Return to the fantastic world of the creators of Delicatessen, and journey with One - a former whale harpooner and circus strongman - and the orphan Miette, in the quest to rescue little DenrÃ©e from Krank's evil clutches. Meet the sinister Octopus twins, Irvin - the brain that floats in an aquarium, The Inventor and his army of clones and the fleas that are trained to kill.
