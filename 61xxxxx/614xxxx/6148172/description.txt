Now, with a simple download of the DPS Plug-In, you can attack the audio signal at the source and remix it on the fly for optimized playback on your existing hardware. Itâ€™s like having your own personal recording engineer living inside your computer. And if you use high-end accessories, they will sound even better.

DPS is not a one-size-fits-all audio solution. It is a revolutionary technology that enables our engineers to create living, breathing, custom profiles to fit your listening experience.
