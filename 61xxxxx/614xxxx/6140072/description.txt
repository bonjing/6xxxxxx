Aliens

Storyline: Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the only survivor of the space freighter Nostromo, is rescued and revived after drifting for fifty-seven years in stasis. At an interview before a panel of executives from her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, her testimony regarding the Alien is met with extreme
skepticism as no physical evidence of the creature survived the destruction of the Nostromo. Ripley loses her space flight license as a result of her \"questionable judgment\" and learns that LV-426, the planet where her crew first encountered the Alien eggs, is now home to a terraforming colony.

Alien 3


Storyline: Following the events in Aliens, the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco experiences an onboard fire and launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop who are all in cryonic stasis. During the launch, the ship\'s medical scans of the crew\'s cryotubes show an Alien facehugger attached to one of the crewmembers. The pod thencrashes on Fiorina \'Fury\' 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates with \"double-Y\" chromosome patterns and histories of physical and sexual violence. After some inmates recover the pod and its passengers, an Alien facehugger is seen approaching the prison dog. Ripley is taken in and awakened by Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison doctor, and is told she is the only survivor of the crash. Many of the ex-inmates have embraced an apocalyptic, millenarian version of Christianity, and Ripley is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, (Brian Glover) that her presence among them may have extremely disruptive effects

Alien Resurrection

Storyline: Alien Resurrection takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned on the outer space military science vessel USM Auriga using \"blood samples from Fury 16, on ice.\" The United Systems Military wants to extract the Alien queen embryo that was implanted in her before her death in Alien 3. After successful extraction of the embryo, the scientists decide to keep the Ripley clone alive for further study. They raise the Alien queen and collect her eggs for further use. As a result of the cloning process, during which Ripley\'s DNA was mixed with the Alien\'s, she develops enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and an empathic link with Aliens.
