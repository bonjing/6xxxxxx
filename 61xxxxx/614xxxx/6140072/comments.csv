,Blanko2,2011-02-05T22:52Z,"or actually, no, it mightve just been media player classic.
sorry! to rephrase: NOTHING WRONG WITH ALIENS 3, MY BAD."
,Vulgarious,2011-02-08T07:52Z,"please seed! i love these movies, but i wish the download would HURRY THE HELL UP!!!"
,Vulgarious,2011-02-11T08:59Z,the sound quality isnt so great. sounds distorted
,gaaraisgod,2011-03-04T21:26Z,Looks good. Are these all theatrical versions? I'm assuming so given the lack of any subtitle.
,Jakko-Pirkko,2011-05-30T23:33Z,"in aliens the sound has something wrong. music is fine but when somebody start to talk it ""breaks"" begin of it. others are great. tnx enyway for the films."
