Lie to Me is an American crime drama television series that premiered on the Fox network on January 21, 2009.
Based on the real-life scientific discoveries of Paul Ekman, the series follows Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth) and his colleagues at The Lightman Group, as they solve crimes using applied psychology by interpreting microexpressions (through the Facial Action Coding System) and body language. They help uncover the truth for the FBI, local police, law firms, corporations, and individuals. Dr. Cal Lightman and his team are effectively human polygraph machines, and no truth can be concealed from them.
