"The Search"

When Jim (John Krasinski) gets an emergency 
phone call from Helene (guest star Linda 
Purl), he is forced to leave Michael (Golden 
Globe winner Steve Carell) in the bathroom of 
a gas station. Meanwhile, Holly (guest star 
Amy Ryan), Erin (Ellie Kemper) and Dwight 
(Rainn Wilson) set out on a journey to find 
Michael. Back at the office Pam's (Jenna 
Fischer) artwork starts a captioning contest 
that seems to offend Gabe (Zach Woods).

Enjoy :)
