aac - 5.1 is not perfectly compatible with PS3 ..

instead ac3 5.1 is more acceptabel.. 

aac will be read and rendered only on HDMI audio output .. not in optical or anyother way"

For the best experience, I would recommend using HDMI when you can.

This isn't my favorite movie file type, but thank you.
