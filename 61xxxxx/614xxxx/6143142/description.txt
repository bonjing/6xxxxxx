If the stick, on which you want to just save the dates really heal? Exposure of the aging system really cope with large hard drives? and the integrity of data carriers to clarify this, c\\\'t has developed a small program H2testw. It describes the selected disk with test data, it then reads back and verifies it. Connect no mistakes on, is not likely to be capacity-related problems. This H2testw is also suitable for detection of manipulated USB sticks with the wrong size specification, as 2008 came in large numbers on the market. Note: Use this tool only if no important data stored on the drive and it is not the boot drive of the system.
