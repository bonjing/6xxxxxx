While this movie is set mostly in the Black neighborhoods of Philadelphia, many of the Whites are quite prejudiced and many of the actors are Black, this really isn't a blaxploitation film--though Netflix has categorized it that way on its web site. Instead, it's like a more modern version of THE STING with a multiracial cast.

Mel Stewart ("Henry Jefferson" from ALL IN THE FAMILY) and Kiel Martin star as con-men who swindle the wrong man. The old guy they cheat out of $10,000 suffers a fatal heart attack when he realizes he was swindled AND he's the uncle of a mob boss--who now has ordered the deaths of these cons. However, unlike THE STING, there is some rough language, nudity and a very, very downbeat ending. I enjoyed the film and appreciated seeing these two lesser name actors getting a chance to play leads, but hate seeing it branded with the label "blaxploitation" because many take this to mean that the film is cheap and formulaic--which it certainly isn't. Hardly a great film, it is still well worth a look for an interesting story.
