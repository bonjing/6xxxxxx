Bismillah Ar Rahman Ar Raheem
(In the name of Allah, most Gracious most Merciful)

This is my first comopilation of Islamic lectures from around the world. I hope they help give us all, muslims and non-muslims alike, a better understanding of a truly beautiful but misunderstood religion and way of life.

I take no credit for these lectures, they are just my collection of my favourite lectures that I listen to for Hidayat (guidance).

They are all MP3 lectures and are in English unless mentioned otherwise.

If you're not sure where to start, I would recommend listening to:

Sheikh Hamza Yusuf
- A convert (or revert ) to Islam at the young age of 18, he gives very logical points of view and interpretations
  -  Lecture: Vision Of Islam

Sheikh Yusuf Estes
- A former preacher who converted (or reverted) to Islam, he's very funny and puts things into perspective
  -  Lecture: No Brainer

I hope you all benefit greatly from the lectures, and insha'Allah I will be uploading more Islamic torrents soon,

Jazak Allah Khair
(May Allah reward you for the good)
