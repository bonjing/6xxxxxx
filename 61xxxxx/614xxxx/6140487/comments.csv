OK, thanks, 
But there is another torrnt put by Globe (Globe' previous torrents were best)  with 3.32gb size without sound,voices and subtitles. That made very frustrated . Does your torrnt contain all the stuff..????"

pls comment on the torrent....................."
,Kar0oOl,2011-02-01T18:53Z,Game works but in some parts of it there is no voice like when some charachters speak. Creatures yell and scream and you ccan hear your fotsteps but there is no music. Why ?
,Kar0oOl,2011-02-01T18:55Z,Gimme solution cause that game without a sound and that scary music is like a half of the game ;p
,bRIz30059,2011-02-01T22:24Z,dunno if its my comp or what but when i play it dosnt have any voices. all other sounds are still there and the game works perfectly just no voices. but my comp does have a nasty history of being rather shit (thanks to vista) so it may just be me.
,lucid657,2011-02-01T22:29Z,"Game is a rip, not a repack."
,Kar0oOl,2011-02-01T23:00Z,Could anybody help me with those missing voices? When there are a subtitles then you can hear Isaac or another fag but when there aren't any then you won't hear fuckin anything coming out from his BJ throat.

,PATRES.SVK,2011-02-03T00:07Z,WTF?! this is DEMO ? I am in the 4th Chapter ventilation in both sides are locked and can not continue in the game. Excuse me for my English.
,PATRES.SVK,2011-02-03T00:12Z,prečo si mi zmazal môj komentár?
,jh-76,2011-02-03T15:56Z,same problem as a patres.svk locked and no way out!!!!
,Kar0oOl,2011-02-03T16:27Z,@PATRES.SVK I have the same problem. How to fix it ? I'm gettin pretty nervous about that ;/
,Enclave213,2011-02-04T07:12Z,Same sound problem that others are facing. Game works sweet other than the odd dialogue cutscenes and game music. Have all drivers updated so i'm assuming there is some possibly corrupted files in the rip? Good job otherwise.
,add-54763,2011-02-05T12:05Z,"the sound problem have nothing to do with drivers or something like that..
your rip is just fucked..
download a other one guys "
