Game information:

Engineer Isaac  Clarke returns  for another  blood-curdling adventure  in Dead
Space 2, the sequel to the critically acclaimed horror adventure. After waking
from a coma on a massive space  city known as "The Sprawl," the lone  survivor
of a horrific alien infestation  finds himself confronting a catastrophic  new
nightmare. Battling dementia, hunted by the government and haunted by  visions
of his dead girlfriend,  Isaac will do whatever  it takes to save  himself and
rid the  city of  the gruesome,  relentless Necromorphs.  Equipped with  a new
arsenal of tools to dismember  the Necromorphs, Isaac will face  the challenge
head-on.

In  Dead Space  2, Isaac  brings the  terror to  space. Players  will take  on
bigger, scarier and more epic battles that will keep them on the edge of their
seats. Delivering a sensory overload  of sound, visuals and action  sequences,
Dead  Space  2  will  bring  the psychological  thrills  of  deep  space  to a
terrifying new level.
