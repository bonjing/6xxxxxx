School Of Rock

Great movie about Jack Black wich is acting like a teacher to earn money to pay the rent. Its a dull job until he finds out the kids are all genius in playing all kind of instruments. With this class he wants to compete with his former band (where he got kicked out) and beat the crap out of them!
