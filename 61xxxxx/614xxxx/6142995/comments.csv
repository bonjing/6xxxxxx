The economy kinda sucks though, the invited 'experts' don't really understand what they're talking about. A TRULY freemarket economy like Friedman or Hayek envisioned would still work great for 30+ years. What we have now in America or anywhere in the world really is not freemarket at all. Example - the African countries are so poor because of subsidized agriculture in developed countries."

,ozkris,2011-02-03T23:00Z,"Just seeding doesn't make the ""movement"" increase. That would be presuming that everyone in the world downloads torrents. This just isn't true. Us downloaders are a very small fraction of the people out there who have the capacity to download. The vast majority of internet users just don't do it.

 The Zeitgeist films, while interesting, are really just alarmist propaganda inspired by fear. The genius of these films is that they make people believe that they know what they are talking about, when they really don't. The best part of all of these ""documentaries"" was the first section of the first film where they debunked religious myth.

 Interesting does not mean true. Just because somebody took the time to put it together doesn't make it accurate. Do you believe everything you read in the newspaper? Do your own research, don't just take everything the Zeitgeist films at face value. They are reactionary snobs who use the same techniques as the mainstream media to keep you fearful of the world around you. The only difference is that the media does it for profit and these guys do it to be cool."

ct420: zeitgeist (the movies) will never solve the problems of crime and corruption in our world systems as long as they attack the ONLY solution that exists: the God of the Christian bible! You will scoff and use the same old tired rhetoric that has spewed from the mouth of immoral and self-centered men for what seems like forever:""Look at all the wars fought in the name of religion!""

Well, news flash! Wars are fought by MEN, religious or otherwise. God's not building WMD's (weapons of mass destruction). He's not committing genocide. He's not lying, cheating, stealing, oppressing, raping or killing men...men are doing that to their own kind. It doesn't matter that they blame God or name God as the one who tells them to do these things because He doesn't. ""Repay evil with good"" is a commandment from God that few men want to hear and even fewer obey. God commands love for your fellow man...a commodity sadly lacking in today's world.

You want to see all the madness end? Let everyone begin to serve the Lord in all righteousness and a Utopian society will begin.

What the world needs is MORE morality, not less.

Christianity is not working because the counterfeit religion called 'Christianity' which so many practice is not Christ-like at all...it is a church of Satan and serves the god of this world.

God knows that man's heart is eternally wicked and he will never make the world a better place as long as he is allowed his 'free will'.

God will return in MIGHT, ruling with an IRON FIST and SHOW mankind the proper way to live. Until then, enjoy your human rulers and their not-so-enduring peace that they will continuously promise.

Time (or should I say Zeit) will tell if you're right. Though spewing your opinions and ideas about the world as truth is kind of pointless and not much more than being argumentative without an argument. It's a believe system, your religion, not a system based on facts. Not that I'm saying that facts are everything but forcing off your faith onto others have never worked (i.e. the crusades) and yet you're doing exactly that. Even though your intentions are probably good, you're actualy the kind of person that makes people walk away from religion. Check the statistics, more and more people are abandoning the religion they were brought up with... and with good reason I'd say, lack of valid evidence and reason may have been good at some point in our society, but right now people need more than just stories...

Everything that I'm about to say is based on evidence in your bible. I'm not making this shit up.

The god that you claim to worship is either ignorant or a liar. Evidence (paraphrased for shortness, but all of it is in there.): Yahweh told adam and eve that if they eat from ""that tree"", because if they do ""On that day you will surely die."" Guess what, they ate from the tree, and ""Their eyes were opened and they were like God."" Who told the truth? THE SERPENT! He said that they would not die, but instead would be like gods. And they were. (On a side note, since he made the tree, I have to assume that he knew full well that the tree would not kill them, which points towards the lying end of things.)
Your god is a baby killer. Evidence: he burned sodom and gomorrah with all of it's citizens. Now, according to the way that I interepreted what I read, these were fairly large cities. (Correct me if I'm wrong on that point.) Now, since they were large cities, there must have been citizens of all ages, including probably newborns that were born that week if not that day. They cannot possibly be so evil at that age to deserve being burned alive.
Your God is the cause of all strife in the world today. Evidence: According to your bible, at one point mankind was doing great things, and all working together.(Babylon) They were achieving great things. What did God do? He scattered them to all corners of the world and made them to speak in different tongues. Thus creating all the different races, and the strife that went along with it."

,KrshBX,2011-03-19T07:00Z,"Comment continued: (Having some issues, as I said, never posted here before, so not used to the behavior of the posting system.)

Your God is unjust. Evidence: God punished Adam and Eve (And subsequently the rest of mankind) because they ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. But they had no way to know that it was wrong to do so. Yes, god told them not to, but they had no way of knowing that disobedience was wrong, as they had not yet gained the knowledge of good and evil.
Your god is just plain mean. Evidence: The entire book of Job! Yes, it was the devil that did all the things to poor job, but all of it was with god's permission. And why did he do it? To win an argument with someone who betrayed him!"
,KrshBX,2011-03-19T07:02Z,"
The long and short of it is like this: I believe everything in the bible. I do not believe that it is a full account of mankind, and so should not be taken as the final answer in everything. (The age of the earth for example. I have no idea where anyone got the idea that the bible indicates the age of the earth, but I never came across it.) Here's a fun fact for you: the first word used in the bible that is translated as god in all modern bibles is Elohim. Know what that means in Hebrew? GODS! Plural. Another one for you: Adam and Eve were not the first man and woman. (No, I'm not talking about the supposed lillith, I don't know where that comes from either.) But it says that Elohim created the earth, yada yada yada, and they created man and woman, they made them male and female. From just after that point, it starts referring to God in the singular form, and begins to relate the histories of a particular god, and his followers. You want some evidence to support this fact too? Okay, Caine and Abel went away for a while and came back with wives. Where did they find wives if there were no other people?

There are some points that I want to mention completely aside from your religion, but about things that you said specifically."

Please feel free to enlighten me. Are these things not in the bible? Is there another way to interpret it? Doubtful. I have spoken to pastors of over twenty years, and they couldn't answer these. The fact of the matter is that they are there, and you can't deny them unless you start picking and choosing what you believe and what you don't from the Bible. As for God's intentions: I never claimed to know them. I only stated attributes based on observation and study.

Here's a fun little paradox:
If God made man in his image, and God is perfect, then man is perfect. If man claims that God does not exist, and since man is perfect (being made in God's image) he is infallible, and therefore must be right in his assertion that God does not exist, and therefore God does not exist. However if God does not exist then man is fallible, and therefore God may exist despite man's claim to the contrary. However if God did then exist, and is perfect... you see where this goes.

,ITSfun2bBROKEN,2011-04-18T15:11Z,"@KrshBX
when the church says that man is made in the image of God it means Love... Corny yes but thats what the church is saying God is love and as such we are images of love... The whole idea that God is love comes from the fact that God wishes us to be happy, its intrinsic in our nature, to be part of the community, to feel, to be seen, it is all human nature that is being suppressed in this capitalist world...

Over a few decades the Roman Curia developed a teaching that basically explains this... dnt ask me how they arrived at it but hell thats groundbreaking... God is Love, we are perfect images of Love... then why the hell do we kill each other?

Because of greed and various other sins, we are temporal PHYSICAL beings of existance, once we die we move on to a different plane, we experience enlightenment on a different level beyond that of the scope of the human person...

we are bound by the limitations of the physical, the body that has 2/3 of its brain still in the ice ages, we desire all the sins as back in the day those sins actually promoted life and so became engrained in our brains constricting our growth as spiritual beings, as now these sins now repersent all that is ""bad"" in society when truly some sin is actually good for the person as long as it isn't in excess...

Basically it all boils down to the fact that we are physical and cannot see ""God"" as he really is and so we have ""religions"" that promote THEORIES on who and what God is... But since we cannot comprehend God as a whole in our states it can be seen that all religions are flawed inherently in their structures...

just use religion as a vehicle to help you in your search for God and find it on your own, don't rely on others they are all different with different motives, thoughts, etc... 

And you cannot deny there is a god... every physicist will tell you there are patterns everywhere in the universe, patterns that shouldn't be there according to chaos theory or is it heat? anyway patterns everywhere where they shouldnt be working together perfectly, can you doubt there is a God with this evidence?

For example what they say about Egypt and Egyptian gods is completely 100% wrong and any professor will tell you that. In fact every single thing they list as a fact of history is completely wrong and a bit of research would have told them that. Research it yourself and try to find academic support for their facts. The one book they use for support and quote from has been blasted so hard by the mainstream academic world for having absolutely no supporting proof/evidence and for going against known, provable history. The book by Acharya S, ""The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold"" has been blasted so hard by mainstream academia for terrible research, stilted work to a political end rather than pure research, and for listing supporting documents that don't exist. The mainstream academic world considers the book a fraud. The modern facts they quote as also have the exact same issues as well.  I would find the whole thing a very funny joke if it weren't so sad. They clearly have no idea how to do research and so everything just falls apart.

But in all seriousness, please explain where I am wrong, I would like to know.

=============================================================

Your Answer:

Man was created in Gods image according to His 4 main attributes: Justice, Power, Wisdom, and Love.

Man was CREATED perfect and was also given free will. 
Adam did not have to be told ""Do not kill"", ""Do not lie"", because as a perfect creature Adam had no such inclinations.

Adam was told ""Do not eat from this tree"".
The tree was a symbol of Gods sovereignty, His authority over the human family. 
I represented Gods right to tell Adam what was right and what was wrong, just like a good father does while raising a child.

When Adam CHOSE to disobey God and to obey to Satan he was in essence giving Satan the authority over him that was previously reserved only for God.

The moment that Adam disobeyed God, he became no longer perfect, so any children he had from that point on would also be imperfect (aka a sinner). That is why we grow old and die. 

Since God is holy and clean, we can not communicate with him directly as long as we are in our current un-pure state. The human race as it stands, can do nothing, and offer nothing to God to make up for Adams sin because one perfect human is worth more than an infinite number of human sinners, just as one human sinner is worth more than all the cows and sheep in the world.

God's son Jesus sacrificed his perfect body in order the ""cover over"" Adams sin. In doing so, he also proved that his brother Adam, could have remained faithful and not given into temptation, and was not created defective.

Since Adam chose to obey Satan as his father, we live in a system where Satan rules as a god. Man is being given time to work out every possible religion and government to prove positively that ""Man can not successfully rule over other men."" 

Soon, God, through His son Jesus, will destroy this wicked system along with the demons and restore the earth to a paradise. The battle to destroy this system is called ""Armageddon"".

I hope this helps!

Please Note:

Nearly all of mans problems comes from two sources:

1. We inherited sin from Adam: 
    We have deformities, illnesses, diseases, sickness and death.
    We make mistakes, car accidents etc. that lead to injury and death.
    We show a lack of love for others that can lead to conflicts, assaults, rapes, and murders.

2. We live in a system ruled by Satan:
    We COULD design a car that can survive a 60 MPH crash but it would cost too much.
    We COULD have built that levee with concrete and steel instead of earth, but it would cost too much.
    We COULD have built that building to withstand an earthquake but it would cost too much. 
    We COULD build steel frame houses that survive a tornado but that would cost too much.
    We COULD have installed seismic monitors and an early warning system for that tsunami.
    We COULD stop putting chemicals in our food and pollution our environment.
    We COULD ship our extra grain to that starving country but who would pay for it?
    We COULD decide to love our neighbors and trade with them, but instead we go to war.
    Etc... Etc... Etc...

God doesn't cause our pain and suffering.
With Satans help, we do it to ourselves.

What this trilogy talks about is the same exact thing as the NWO, ruled by Lucifer. What could be the purpose of this framework? Well, simple enough, to console you all and make it look like some ""bright future of mankind"" so you accept the NWO and give an oath to serve Lucifer and Lucifer only, as all of you will be required to do according to information on record.

Remember this well: without your agreement, the NWO and a rule of Lucifer can not be established as it would be a violation of one of the most fundamental Laws of existence, which is Free Will. If this is done without your explicit agreement, the punishment to those who violated this Law would be more than they bargained for. This is the LAW! Under no conditions whatsoever it can be violated, and they know it really well, no matter what they tell you, deluding and zombifying you all and converting you into biorobots - functional biological machines.

This whole ""paradise on earth without God"" ideology is meant not to free you but to enslave you and in the most drastic and violent ways. If you agree to it, you will sign your own death sentence as it is planned to destroy at least nine tenths of the world population ""to restore the balance with nature"" and create that ""paradise"" for the ""elite"" of parasites to parasite on the fruits of labor of the rest of you - ""slaves"", in a LITERAL sense.

Conceptually, this framework does not make any sense even though some things seem to correspond to reality. Because someone has to rule it and make decision to allocate the resources, to initiate the projects and make all sorts of decisions. It can not just work by itself. Someone has to direct this grand show, and who would that be but not the same biggest and baddest bankers that change their dress to look like some ""elite"" while controlling the world just the same. What do you need money for if you OWN the whole world?

Can you even conceive of an idea of getting rid off the bankers and their deadly grip on the world? HOW? WHO has any power to force them to accept their own bankruptcy unless they are even bigger bankers? You mean the UN? Well, but the UN is their ""back door to enslave the world"", just as Harold Wallace Rosenthal states in his six hour long interview on record. It is them who created the UN in the first place.

If you can understand this and see it, there is no need to even read the rest of this critical review. "
