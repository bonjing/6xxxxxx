drool was a band which to my knowledge had a demo tape with some cool tunes on it and then this their only cd I know of.

The band had a great live show and a unique sound.  Somewhere along the line the band ousted their lead singer Al and went as a 3-piece.  This didn't work to well and I think they had a few reunion shows with Al but just kind of died away.

Included here along with the album in MP3 format are scans of the cd, back cover and inlay with all lyrics.

My 2nd torrent.  Hope a few people enjoy it.
