   Release Notes:

   Astroslugs is a colorful and soothing puzzle game for PC and Mac that    
   is extremely easy to pick up. It features interesting puzzles which      
   require you to fit a number of different shapes upon a board. You fill   
   all available spaces with all the available shapes to solve each one.    
   We have focused on simplifying the role of placing pieces â€“ there is     
   no moving pieces into place and clicking buttons to rotate and flip.     
   Instead, you use your mouse to draw them into place, while drawing       
   over an already present shape will remove it. Itâ€™s a very simple         
   mechanic which anyone can easily understand. The story of the game       
   revolves around the evil but slightly incompetent Astroslugs who         
   strife to leave their home planet and conquer the universe. Their only   
   problem: They have no source of energy to jumpstart their space craft.   
   Now they turn to you to fix this problem and get them on their way to    
   the stars.
