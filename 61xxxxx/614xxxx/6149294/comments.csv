,dubbman,2011-02-06T11:17Z,"works great on a modded xbox 360.

DO NOT GO ONLINE UNTIL:

A) the game is actually released, 2/8/11 two days.

B) the files are confirmed stealthed with abgx 360.
currently can't be confirmed until someone tests it and uploads the ok, which they are not about to do until the game launches, unless they want to get banned from xbox live.


there is several versions of this torrent all having the same files..  look for one with demonoid listed in the trackers, or add it :)"
,MisterAK,2011-02-06T22:00Z,Works Great!!! Thanks
,mcnob,2011-02-08T00:03Z,"Can't help wondering if all the people that complain about the lack of seeders actually seed completed files themselves.  

Stop complaining...it really annoys other people.  You could always go and buy the game instead.  ;-)"
,marcusabu,2011-02-08T00:23Z,works fine and great game
,mcnob,2011-02-08T02:04Z,"Can anyone confirm if this is ap 2.5 or not?

Thanks"
,lukirossi,2011-02-08T07:35Z,"Actually, this game is pure false advertising. I've been playing it for like 2 hours and it's full of bugs, it doesn't have antialiasing (look at some pics of the game at google, it should have..) and the gameplay is as realistic as the Fringe series ÂŹÂŹ. I don't know if this is an early version of the game, and if it is, this version sucks."
,ntfcAndy,2011-02-08T15:21Z,"NO AP25

enjoy"
,Dareomius,2011-02-09T08:41Z,"Game works fine, no problems. Played it for 3 hours and have to say, this game is bad. Graphics are really bad, but maybe it has to be played on the new Xbox. Car handling is not that bad, but light, signs and and other things undestroyable, thats really bad mistake. But I have to say, that there are better roads, and nice is roof control in cabrios. Will continue playing and see if this game is worth the money."
,robotirl,2011-02-09T10:25Z,abgx360 now patches EAA9C83E5DBC744D.ini and the iso passes all stealth tests
[T],Sunblock.,2011-02-09T14:16Z,"Agree.

Graphics:

Graphics in this game is like going back to PS2 / XBOX 1.

Race / Compete Dialogs / Story is pointless in general. 
The game is more focus on cut our hair/buy clothes etc...and pack it in a graphic graphic engine from the 80th. Very disappointed!.
"
[T],Sunblock.,2011-02-09T14:21Z,"Its a game i will never buy. I have not tested multi player get but with this kind of game play i got bored after 4h. I dont think the multi player will add something interesting or what we already have seen.

My opinion."
,Dareomius,2011-02-10T16:29Z,"Agree with Sunblock. Hope they will impove it with patches, or in next game."
,shanepee,2011-02-10T22:37Z,i cant get the game even started i have tried 3 times to get playing but it has to make a save file and you click okay and it just scrolls threw different pictures with music on and doesnt do anything 
,tieri,2011-02-21T11:49Z,"Thanks for the heads up. Was looking forward to this game, but what I have read, this is not worth the donwload. I feel really sorry for those who have payed for this shit."
,mrnexus,2011-02-27T12:19Z,"CAN ANYONE TELL ME HOW OR WERE I CAN FIND OUT HOW TO MODIFY MY XBOX360 SO THAT I CAN BURN AND COPY GAMES TO DVDS ETC AND THEN PLAY THE CAMPAIGN AND XBOXLIVE  MULITPLAYER.GAMES  ARE SO EXPENSIVE I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP BUYING THEM,THERE MUST BE SOME KIND SOUL OUT THERE WHO CAN ADVISE ME WHAT I NEED TO DO.YOU CAN CONTACT ME BY EMAILING ME ANY INFO TO MRNEXUS13@YAHOO.CO.UK.THANKS VERY MUCH."
,mrkmhtet,2011-03-06T16:23Z,"@mrnexus
Just google or if u wnt some video, go to youtube they will teach u how to flash and mod with jungle flasher using SATA cable. :)
Thnks uploader! for sharing the game with us! The game works fine!
Graphic: The graphic in this game is actually focusing on the landscape/environment and cars, not the character. So I agree its actually kinda suck. But while u r driving a car, it looks real and cool!"
,santanalog,2011-03-25T22:20Z,"hey can someone please help me, how do i get the iso from this file?"
