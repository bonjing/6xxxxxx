All right, here is the complete Earthbound Soundtrack. I\'ve needed the full ost of this game for so long and never being able to find it, after tracking down all the spc sound files, I proceeded to record 164 songs track after track to wav then converted all to mp3 sorted out the tracks and named each song. To say the least it was a time consuming process but worth so much seeing as I truly love this masterpiece of a game and the soundtrack that accompanies it. Originally composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu \\\"hip\\\" Tanaka. For all you Earthbound fans out there I hope you enjoy this, sounds gold all recorded in 320kbps mp3 format. I also tossed in some extras. 

I highly recommend the fan remix compilations like Bound Together http://www.wushuplaya.com/boundtogether/ and Rock Candy http://starmen.net/rockcandy/
