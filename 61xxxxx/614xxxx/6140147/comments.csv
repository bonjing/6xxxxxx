,takk01,2011-02-08T18:01Z,"Does Dvdfab need to be updated every month when new blu rays come out like Anydvd? Also dont see a ""platinum"" version on dvdfab site. Is this an unlocked trial?"
,hmtester,2011-02-09T14:47Z,"I installed it and things appear to be ok until I try to run the file converter program.  When I launch the app, the initial screen says that all of the products are set to ""never expire""  I'm trying to convert an MP4 file to AVI and as soon as I add the file to be converted, I get a message saying that the version of the file converter is outdated and I need to download a new one.  I've unintalled and tried this a couple of times, including manually cleaning out my registery to make sure any residual keys/serials have been removed as well from the registry.  Anyone elase have a similar problem?  I never had this problem with older version 8.0.6.5 or previous."
,jr153,2011-02-09T23:46Z,"CC-
Ive never had any problems with your prgms until now. This version seems to only work for awhile, like a trial version then says ""dvd copy has expired"" plus you can no longer use ""customize"" option anymore. All the versions that say ""dvd copy (gold) seem to expire even though it says ""never expires"". Is there a fix for this? Same thing happened for version 8068.."
,xPhr34k1sh,2011-02-14T17:21Z,Great upload! Thxx
,xPhr34k1sh,2011-02-14T17:22Z,Great Upload! Thxx
,shmellow,2011-02-16T07:54Z,"Thanks ChattChitto for another awesome upload 

If you are having troubles with this program acting like a trial version open CC's program as an administrator and use the option to locate the DVDFab 8 folder"
,pbgm987,2011-02-18T18:05Z,hey plz where can i find bluesoleil ivt bluetooth software by chatt chitto
,MrTTAO,2011-02-20T18:40Z,"It is 2-20-2011... jr153 at 2011-02-09 said ""Hey  I never had problems with your uploads before ... except this one works for a while then stops""...
He has done that for the following 3 (at least) torrents in the same day:
1. DVDFab Platinum v8.0.7.3 + Crack [ChattChitto RG]
2. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6137351/DVDFab_8.0.7.3_-_Final_Preactivated_-ZOO_[TrT-TcT]
3. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6136713/DVDFab_Platinum_v8.0.7.3_Final_Patch

Those three torrents were created on 29th, 30th, and 31st of Jan 2011.

It does not seem plausible for him to have downloaded each one, tried it for a while, then made near identical posts saying how it doesn't work on the same day for all 3. Looks like a shill trying to sabotage piratebay."
,ashpool1,2011-03-02T18:03Z,"Yes, mine did the same thing.  My first dvdfab download from chatt worked for a while before it stopped.  I downloaded the 8.0.6.8.  Just today it told me dydcopy is outdated and to buy.  can u fix this?"
,kroan,2011-03-07T05:33Z,"Thanks ChattChitto! Pretty music along with the crack. ""Ancient Pines"""
,xGoreX,2011-03-13T05:18Z,For every one that is getting the expired message just click the automated cracking for your version of windows. it will fix that issue...
,xGoreX,2011-03-13T05:20Z,"theuploader9999, fuck off seeing as you haven't uploaded a file you really can't bitch about people who have. Enjoy the real deal from ChattChitto. Shut the fuck up and stop crying like a baby."
,NileQT87,2011-03-15T10:55Z,"I updated my old 7.0.9.3 with this, but I found that this version seems to have a bad bug where it fails to deinterlace (say, a rip of a TV episode) and it doesn't crop very well (whereas the other one automatically takes off the black edges).

However, the older one had a problem with audio not coming up on files where the DVD files appeared to be connected to each other (no problem for the most part as I can chop off the unneeded part of the clip elsewhere)--and it bizarrely did deinterlace on this particular clip (I may use later versions when it has audio difficulties).

The interlacing and failure to crop are big issues with this one. Anyone else having these problems?

Back to 7.0.9.3 for the most part."
