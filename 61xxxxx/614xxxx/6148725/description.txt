The Flow's 
Greatest Hits (2003)

Late 60's early 70's NYC power trio with experimental ambitions (not in the same league as Blue Cheer or Grand Funk, but still...) which was strongly influenced by Black Sabbath. Although Pete Fine on vocals cannot compete with Ozzy, the band is very interesting and convincing - two tracks of flirting with classical music (Toccata, Third Movement) show the skills which are well above those of the better established musicians. Basically, this compilation covers the whole history of the group,albeit not so successful - there is enough studio work (sometimes unpolished) on the CD. A good purchase for every fan of 70s fuzz-guitar sound, and a real collector's item.
