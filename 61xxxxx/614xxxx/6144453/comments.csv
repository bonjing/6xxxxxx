,Bjellesau,2011-02-02T07:34Z,"Didn't work for me.
Had 6.7.7.0, installed over, used the supplied keyfile -> NOT registered. Had to go back to 6.7.7.0 -> everything ok again.

Any help?"
[T],SnowCrash05,2011-02-02T07:48Z,"This is version 6.7.8.0 , the key file provided for this one, and it's the final version. If you installed any old version uninstall it completely, install the new version, restart the computer, just double click on the provided key file ,it's registered(Follow the instructions given).Cheers! :)"
,navyjack,2011-02-02T10:05Z,"Worked perfectly for me.

1) unplugged router
2) installed anydvd
3) rebooted
4) allowed AnyDvd to open
5) Closed anyDvd
6) double-clicked on the ""Key"" file
7) reopened AnyDvd
9) Profit!

It seems to be great and working well, and I thank you."
,theuploader9999,2011-02-02T10:25Z,Thanks man!!! its works for me....well done..
,navyjack,2011-02-02T10:56Z,"Adding to my previous comment: Just finished using AnyDvd and Handbrake to make a copy of ""RED"".  The audio and video were perfect.  The only problem I came across was that the chapter title ""Chapter 1, 2, 3, etc"" was imprinted across the bottom of the video.  I'm currently testing some theories on what is causing it, but I don't think it's AnyDvd."

what sud I do?"
[T],SnowCrash05,2011-02-04T16:56Z,"@lacywest  If your PC is having some sort of problems , check your condition of your PC . Am only using original installers from it's official home sites, that's why am also showing hash codes in the description now, Don't post anything fake, if you extract programs  i would recommend you 'uniextract' it can extract almost all sort of software's. If you still feel to complain you can report it in the forum, Am also provided that links in the description. Thank you :)"
[T],SnowCrash05,2011-02-04T20:32Z,"@lacywest Am only saying facts mate, and of course if a new version comes out i will try to upload it, you can catch it up from me or any other good uploaders. Any way thanks for the feed backs mate :)"
,Emi1634,2011-02-12T00:43Z,"Found this on another torrent, verified and it works:

Do a search for ""anydvd.chk"" and delete it or rename it (I renamed it to anydvd2.chk just in case i needed to restore things later), you will have to enable hidden files and folders. the locations are as follows:

for xp the location is:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk

for vista:
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

for windows 7 the location is:
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

Make sure the Program is closed but you have already run the initial registration (so this is once you already get that error you're talking about). Once you do this, start the program and it should work."

,stilljacktwenty,2011-02-25T21:10Z,In my completed download the keygen hasn't got a file type. Nobody's mentioned this. Has the download been corrupted somehow?
