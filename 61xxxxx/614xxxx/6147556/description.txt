FUBAR Destroyer 2011 v5
-----------------------

Here comes a new version of this evil series of applications!

In this version, both the Task Manager and the CTRL+ALT keys will be disabled.


As usual, you cannot run this program by mistake.

And remember: The only purpose of this application, is to DESTROY all files on all harddisks, without letting the user know what is happening.
