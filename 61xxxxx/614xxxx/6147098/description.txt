If the document were indeed a "forgery" as the jewish media claims it to be, why is it that one could be shot and killed on sight for mentioning this document in Bolshevik (jew) run Russia?  Why is it when the first (abridged) version of the protocols was published by Pavel Krushevan, there was an attempt made on his life? 
See HERE.

    After a homicidal attempt by a P. S. Dashevsky, it was reported that Krushevan lived in constant fear, kept weapons close at hand and was accompanied by a personal cook out of fear to be poisoned.

Another man by the name of Sergei Nilus published the first copy of the protocols in full in Russia in 1905. Some information about him can be found HERE.

For this act, he was imprisoned and tortured by the jewish Bolshevik "Cheka", as per this source HERE.


    In 1924 Professor Nilus was arrested in Kiev by the "Cheka", imprisoned, and then tortured. He was told by the president of the court (who was Jewish) that this treatment was meted out to him for "having done them incalculable harm in publishing the Protocols". He was freed afterwards, and detained again a few months later, this time in Moscow; he was confined, and later sent to exile, where he died in 1929.
