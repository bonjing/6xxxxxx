,Jeg_leger,2011-02-04T20:05Z,This movie looks fucking awesome ! thx man
,geronik,2011-02-04T20:20Z,A/V Quality ??
,vsjane,2011-02-04T23:10Z,Slow dl.
,summit182,2011-02-04T23:23Z,Poor quality sample
,vsjane,2011-02-05T01:30Z,Downloads so slow I don't think it will ever finish.
,flextm71,2011-02-05T03:54Z,"4:3 and not good quality. I don't understand why ppvrips are always bad quality. Its basically a tvrip, and tvrips are usually pretty good quality. So what the hell is the problem? And why are most ppvrips 4:3 and not 16:9?"
,DaRkiv,2011-02-05T04:10Z,"The copy's r great but its the people that try to fix them, they seem to damage the quality."
,magmasid,2011-02-05T07:38Z,"quality is good but not widescreen though. also, i think the last part with the two investigators (raining scene) was cut...

great movie also. 

will wait for a better copy but this one's good also."
,RulingCzar,2011-02-05T07:41Z,Its missing the very end of the movie...
,Phatfish,2011-02-05T13:29Z,"@flextm71:

+1

Agree. Makes no sense why they should be so bad and especial 4:3.

Picture is stripy and the framrate seems to be wrong as it jitters terribly. "

,Groffsingen,2011-02-05T17:32Z,What happens in the end ?
,Cindi13,2011-02-05T20:35Z,Second movie in a row with the ending missing. How disappointing!!!!! Good movie though. Does anyone have a full version with decent quality?

this is straight out of the info box from the unloader. u people need to seriously read that shit first before u just jump the fuck into a download. he told you up front about it, so if ur too stupid to read it then its ur fuckn fault and u need to stop bitching. plus, its FREE. u get what u paid for. stupid fucks... thanx unloader"
,epictroll,2011-02-06T06:47Z,"fuck. I was going to spoil the ending, but it wasn't there."
,rauthony,2011-02-06T12:50Z,"At the end, the two detectives open up the drain cover, climb into the sewer and meet a race of alien beings from the planet Meldak who proceed to kill them, eat their kidneys and have sex with their corpses. Then the Russell Crowe character performs the Spandau Ballet hit ""True"" while sitting on an ostrich before spontaneously combusting. I can tell you, I wasn't expecting that. Best ending ever."
,born2b,2011-02-06T21:26Z,The end is missing! 
,errikos13,2011-02-06T23:57Z,where the fuck is the finale 20 minute???
,Vilzen,2011-02-07T00:06Z,"i cant play this , a window pops up with ""media usage rights acquisition""."
,mark215,2011-02-07T06:04Z,"The cop thinks if he can find the button â€“ even three years later â€“ maybe it could bring justice for Lara and prove someone else was there. Itâ€™s raining so he follows a stream of water to a storm drain. They pull out the storm drain, looking for the button. His partner thinks heâ€™s crazy. As they let the storm drain fall back down, the audience sees the button, but the cop doesnâ€™t. Itâ€™s there. Lara didnâ€™t do it.

In the house in Venezuela, Luke is asleep and Lara cuddles up next to him. He kisses her on the forehead. (Remember she was worried heâ€™d never kiss her again?) John takes a picture of the two of them with a digital camera, reinstating their tradition of taking a picture every day."

Another quality release from IFLIX
More to come very soon!""

A Quality release with the ending missing. Awesome. Just because we don't want to pay for a movie doesn't mean we can't complain about an incomplete file. Maybe if the note about the file not being complete was bold, caps or near the top you would have a point. 

As it stands you are a high-horse douchefag."

,tybomb,2011-02-07T17:59Z,"I had to shut it off.  The quality is not the best but the biggest problem is the movie seems cropped badly.  It looks like we're just seeing a small square of the middle of the screen.  You can tell alot is missing.

 Hopefully something better comes out soon."
,-Cortex-,2011-02-07T22:05Z,"@flextm71 Google 'PPVRip', the source for the actual screenings (on the on-demand services in hotels and such) is VHS. There's your answer.

Again, it's not ripping the source that's the issue, the source is simply poor quality. VHS is also the reason for the cropped image resulting in 4:3 AR."
,kot444er,2011-02-08T23:01Z,this is nice copy but the end ist missing a few minutes !!!!
,JonnyMohawk,2011-02-09T03:43Z,"The copy is legit.

Here is a screenshot

I think the publishing company must have hired people to spam fake, an interesting tactic."
,Banana01,2011-02-10T00:51Z,I agree with the people that say this is fake. I tried watching it on Windows Media Player and it asked me to download something and a Comodo(That's my antivirus) alert came up asking me if I wanted to remove some harmful file.
,fuckincrazyness,2011-02-10T04:01Z,it wont play... so yeah i geuss it's FAKE!!!!!!!!   fuck you. vlc wont play it. nothing i have will... you bastard

,fedfam,2011-02-17T05:39Z,"Please, don't upload this crap. I was watching it, ok the video quality is shit, but whats worse is that the ending is gone. I can guarantee it's more than 20 seconds. Yes I know, it's free. But what a waste of bandwidth, the quality is shit, and one of the most important parts of the movie is missing."
,hairyassapeman,2011-02-17T19:07Z,Not going to download since the ending is apparently missing.   Might as well rip the last 1-3 pages out of a book.
,loni90,2011-02-18T22:43Z,"Just wondering if there is a chance of putting up just the last part, where the movie ends in this one...like the sample, but the very last past.

please do that!"
,loni90,2011-02-18T22:46Z,"Must just say:
this is not fake...just PPVrip...not the best quality but still watchable.not widescreen!

the movie itself its just fantastic...to bad i never got to see the end...wich has been cut of!"
