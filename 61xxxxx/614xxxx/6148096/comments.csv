,iPodnano2,2011-02-03T23:24Z,Seed please my upload speed 2-3 MB/s
,61stylo,2011-02-04T00:27Z,I'm seeding 24/7. I hope that people will seed too :). thanks.
,61stylo,2011-02-04T00:40Z,"Ok people , I forgot to mention that when you crack the original gta3.exe you have to mount the disc and copy the directory called ''audio'' from the cd in to your games main directory (ex. C;\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA 3). Have PHUN!"
,61stylo,2011-02-04T00:45Z,"Btw , It isn't necessary to use a crack , just keep GTA3.iso mounted in Deamon Tools that way you can play too."
,sthlm080808,2011-02-05T02:02Z,awesome when was this game released ? never seen it here on TPB.. is this the first upload ? =) 
,61stylo,2011-02-05T22:43Z,It's not the first on Piratebay (At least I don't think it is). There are MANY gta3 torrents but these are NOT direct copies from the original discs and this is a clean CD rip..
,THE_MPAA,2011-02-12T01:42Z,"Finally, a clean rip! Thx a bunch!"
,MistaNervous,2011-02-21T21:15Z,"Thank you SO much for this! I was looking to relive the series again! I will seed 24/7 for a few days, my upload speed is 4-5 mb/s. Thank you!"
