,Omg_Its_Stump,2011-02-04T03:45Z,thanks broseph :D
,ProudMan,2011-02-04T06:47Z,"Clean,working app."
,sudokill,2011-02-04T12:44Z,"I swear they are releasing a new version as soon as hellboy puts up a cracked version, 3.2.8 just happens to come out a few hours later.

I couldn't care about the lower CPU usage in 3.2.8 and the other bugs don't affect me so this is a keeper"

,XNA,2011-02-04T15:15Z,"@ sudokill

Im thinking the exact same thing.Also Fraps is reportedly difficult to crack."
,Itbankrock,2011-02-04T19:12Z,AWWW! FUCK IT! 3.2.8 is released!
,sudokill,2011-02-04T21:39Z,"If they charged like ĂÂŁ5-10 for this program then I'd buy it.

I know it's useful but it's not exactly Photoshop. To the Fraps release schedule team reading this: put the price down please you'd earn more money that way.
It's so easy to torrent it, $37 or a free torrent for a 2MB file, you know what people are going to choose.
People would buy it cheap just for the instant updates alone"
,neoka28,2011-02-05T00:29Z,"xD as soon as this torrent pops up, 3.2.8 which looks like it greatly reduces CPU usage comes out... "
,OnyxgrinD,2011-02-05T01:50Z,I agree if this program was $5-10 I would buy it no questions asked. They're just another greedy company wanting to over-charge for a niche product.
,Banzay27,2011-02-07T03:00Z,"Great contributions, hellboy. First time I'm getting a fully fledged FRAPS. The 30 secs per take doesn't cut it.
Neither do the file sizes, ironically. 30 sec vids already rack up 2GB, gonna have to apply compression, since it seems to record only in avi format.

To those who make a point of keeping updated: what is the goddamn difference? Unless previous versions actually don't cut it for you, stick with what you got for a while. Sure, look for an update when 3.3.0 is out, but are you gonna break your balls over 3.3.7-3.3.8?
Either way, hellboy will pamper us... and both you and I thank him for it."
,billbroke,2011-02-09T20:30Z,"Very very good torrent hellboy! Unfortunately, 3.2.8 is out now and greatly reduces CPU usage, which was a big problem for my last FRAPS (2.7.something), so if you could upload that it would be even better. Until then i'll just use this one...I have to upgrade anyhow, my last version was torrented and it was very very old. I can't wait to use this new one."
,s_t_o_r_m,2011-02-10T20:19Z,I'll wait for 3.2.8 :-)
,jackcaver,2011-02-10T23:41Z,"hm, 3.2.9 has been released today."
,Itbankrock,2011-02-11T06:31Z,3.2.9 released
,KrazyTrumpeter05,2011-02-14T07:49Z,No one has 3.2.8 or 3.2.9?  /sadpanda
,sudokill,2011-02-16T22:08Z,Itbankrock you comment on every Fraps upload about a new release- I think the uploaders know a new one is out you just have to wait for it
,Itbankrock,2011-02-18T09:59Z,"@sudokill
I'll wait, i have patience my men. =)"
,MrZeroGravity996,2011-02-20T03:06Z,Does this software has a more than 30seconds record time?
,Forkinator,2011-02-20T05:48Z,Thank you hellboy. Hope you can crack 3.2.9 or 3.2.8 for us. the cpu usage thing bugs me.
,loledujo,2011-02-23T21:25Z,Fraps 3.3.0 xD
,Itbankrock,2011-02-24T09:57Z,"Fuck it! 3.3.0 released, although i only need 3.2.8 for lower cpu usage
