,killyourself,2011-02-04T03:49Z,Why are people voting negative on quality on my recent torrents? They are all pure lossless rips. Give an explanation.
,killyourself,2011-02-04T03:55Z,"I'll take them all down if no one appreciates them. No point in seeding at a 20:1 ratio just for kids to download who don't know what APPLE LOSSLESS means and freak out when they aren't shitty ass MP3s.

Rant, over. :)"
,pacelli76,2011-02-23T21:02Z,"Great album and kudos to you for the encoding. like they say once you go FLAC you never go back! sounds amazing!! keep up the great work, this girl appreciates you! ;)"
,zerosk8a,2011-03-10T06:01Z,"I upload movies and never get thanked, so i know your frustration. I def do appreciate ppl like you uploading stuff like this, thats awesome. 

In my opinion being one of the ppl that prefer 320kbs mp3 > flac.. its just an easier format and size to quality ratio is a big thing for most people.. not me since i have 4tb of hdd but still.. 

thanks nonetheless for taking the time to upload and keep up the good work.. "

,DESTREY,2012-03-13T06:39Z,"FLAC FOREVERRRRR.

All Your Torrents Are Awesome.

Can You Upload Hot Chelle Rae Whatever Album, Kelly Clarkson Breakaway, And Avril Lavigne Goodbye Lullaby? :O In Lossless Of Course As I Cannot Find Them Anywhere in Flac -.-
I'd Really Appreciate it (:
Plus I Love Your User Name XD."
