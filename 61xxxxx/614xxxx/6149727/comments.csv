[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-02-05T06:10Z,"Works fine on VLC player and also SMPlayer. Just make sure your PC has all the codecs installed.

Install the K-Lite combined community pack or Ffdshow.  If there is a render error, it has something to do with either Directx or your graphics card is not configured properly.
