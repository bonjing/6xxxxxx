Plot:
The team braces for a visit from Special Agent Harkins, who is there to interrogate them about Fitch after Malloy's murder.

Fitch and Washington attend to the case of a missing girl, the granddaughter of a prominent Grosse Pointe man who was found gunned down on a public bus with two other victims. A briefcase with bullet holes and a cell phone help the detectives find out who is responsible and how to get the abducted girl back safely.

Fitch also reveals to Washington exactly why he left his job, wife and son in New York. His excitement over his son visiting him in Detroit is dampened with a phone call from an old associate of his in New York.
