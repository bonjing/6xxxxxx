As Duncan Bannatyne reached thirty, he was still living the life of a beach bum in Jersey. Fearing that he was about to become the oldest swinger in town, and anxious to settle down with his partner, he realised that what he needed to do was to become a millionaire. Five years later, he was one.

In this inspirational yet hugely practical book, Duncan Bannatyne shows how listeners can assess where they are in their lives and start to do something to improve things by understanding what their strengths are. He then shows how to change your life and set yourself on a more successful path. Finally, he reveals his key tips for how to put together a great pitch that could take you into the Dragons' Den, or even past your bank manager, to get the support you need to make your dreams come true.

Throughout it all, he gives fascinating insights from his own career that prove how his ideas have worked for him - and could work for anyone else willing to learn from him................
