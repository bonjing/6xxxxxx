,giantsfan706,2011-02-03T08:28Z,"Here is some other instructions I found:

***Note: Not for banned consoles!***

!!!!WARNING!!!!
While using this map pack on xbox live, there is a chance your Gamertag will get banned from Black Ops servers!!!

Use at your own Risk!!!

Instructions:

1. Open USBXTAF or Modio and explore your usb device. Google either, I prefer Modio.

2. Insert the profile folder into ""Content\"" folder and the game folder into the ""Content\0000000000000000\"" folder. Be patient.

3. Wait for it to finish inserting file, now close the explorer and insert usb device into your console.

4. Turn on your xbox and sign into YOUR account with the first controller.

5. Launch Call of Duty: Black Ops, Select Multiplayer, then connect to XBL.

6. After you're connected, at the screen with Xbox Live/Store/Options/ect. turn on your second controller and sign into the
""Prince of Crack"" profile.

7. After a few seconds sign out of the ""Prince of Crack"" profile.

8. Now select Xbox Live with the first controller and enjoy the new maps!!

You need to repeat this every time you want to play the game and you need to be on live.

Big thanks to Ecko3351 from xbox360iso.com!"

,briggy31,2011-03-29T02:33Z,this totally worked the easy way to do this is you need at least a 2gb usb then put it in your xbox and configure it with the xbox then take and put into your computer. Note i used usbxtaf it super simple so you need to download usbxtaf you ned to download this pack from alexisthebest then once all is done you plug usb into computer open with usbxtaf open device then go to new folder name it Content click to open the folder you just made now open the file you downloaded from alexisthebest you will see two actual files one says dlc and the other is prince of crak or something like that click to open the prince of crak on once till you see a folder named E0000314FA661949 DRAG this to the open folder on content folder you made on usbxtaf now give it time to inject it will tell you when its done after that still on xtaf click to make new folder now name this one 0000000000000000 16 zeros once done click and open that folder now go back to your alexisthebest download files and click on dlc once till you see this folder 41560855 then drag to your  open 000000000000000000 folder let it inject it takes a bit it took mine like 5 to 10 mins dont know i went to the store now the hard part is over eject the usb put it in your xbox 360 and you either upload it to your hard drive but if you dont have a hard drive just leave in the usb go to black ops sign in now while on the start screen sign in a second controler and sign into the prince of hack profile when the avatar select screen pops up hit the middle xbox button in the center of controler and sign the second controler out your good to go if you wanna play online with them sign on to xbox live then use the second controler and sign in then out like i showed you I hope this helps i got it first try here is a video tut to help any questions hit me up on xboxlive           oo cutthr0at oo thats a zero in throat well good luck and thank you alexisthebest very good a ten plus 10+
