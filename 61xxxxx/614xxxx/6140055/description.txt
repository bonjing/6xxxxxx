[W4F PRESENTS]: 
John.OConors.Beethoven.Boot.Camp.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F

[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/01/31

Genre: Arts/Culture


Description:
In this unique film, recorded in Positano, on Italy's rugged Amalfi 
coast, internationally acclaimed concert pianist John O'Conor tries to 
pass on the passion and power of Beethoven's music to the next 
generation of musicians. It's not an easy task - even though this 
group of seven men and women from around the world are hand 
picked by O'Conor for these master-classes, as much for their musical 
ability as for their perceived dedication to their art and their craft, 
the lessons have mixed results.

This masterclass will change the way they think, the way they hear 
and the way they play - and the cameras will be with them all the 
way.
