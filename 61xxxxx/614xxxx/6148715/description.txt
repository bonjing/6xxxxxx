"The Sin in the Sisterhood"

A body disguised as a scarecrow is found 
with a bullet wound in a remote cornfield, 
and the team is forced to work against the 
clock to avoid a storm and potential 
complications that would affect the 
evidence. Booth and Brennan interrogate 
the victim's three wives, who are also 
sisters, and learn that jealousy between 
the sisters and their desire for their 
husband's attention had caused a major 
rift in the family. Booth and Brennan also 
question one relative who disapproved of 
the victim's polygamy. Meanwhile, Cam 
loses confidence in her relationship with 
her on-call doctor boyfriend (guest star
Gold), but they both realize they need to 
make their relationship a priority.
