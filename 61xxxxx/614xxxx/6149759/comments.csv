,UncleDaddy,2011-02-04T17:55Z,Some fake skin in Wn 7.. 
,bratley,2011-02-04T19:41Z,does this have sp 1 ? I like the look and the applied tweaks but see no point in getting it if the service pack isn't included :(
,w00du,2011-02-04T21:18Z,"the uploader is ace
but he doesnot claim his stamp of approval 
now my only concern is not virus but will it slow down the system????????????????????"
,rupankur,2011-02-05T12:38Z,is this  manupulating of win7
,trustedcrew,2011-02-05T18:01Z,this version of window is not good called extreme edition  because there is major problems with this version like system hanged
,tbbtto,2011-02-05T21:46Z,"its jst modified win 7
:P"
,MrSmartyPants,2011-02-06T21:26Z,"@ tbbtto: - and others who criticize. - SO WHAT? The uploader, Extremezone, has clearly stated exactly what it is. A MODIFIED version of w7. So take it or leave it. No need to POINT OUT THE OBVIOUS. @rupankur: Yes, this is ""manipulating of Windows 7"". The uploader (who is a great uploader BTW) has stated that clearly.

What a bunch of dumb-arses."
,yashaka71107,2011-02-06T23:46Z,"this image i burn with nero at 4x speed but can't bootable, am try everything 1st boot from dvd and it not work too, i try other dvd image and it work.can sum1 tell how please. "
,rathspawn,2011-02-07T06:35Z,"THIS .ISO DOESN'T BOOT. Person who created this is a massive failure or this is a fake.
I can't even find where this originated from. Searching for it only leads to other torrent sites."
,paggyone,2011-02-07T15:27Z,it`s just a load of windows 7s on one disc
,aam101,2011-02-07T19:13Z,"Does not boot from disk
will not load or install, seems faulty or a bad dl??
installing win 7 original

My advice is not to dl as it must need fixes?"
,yashaka71107,2011-02-09T03:28Z,"i try many different way to make it bootable, but still won't boot, i try different boot image and it's fine, i guess this is not bootable image at all, other way to install this? i guess i cant find the solution, as long as the uploader tell us what to do, cuz he really said in the description it boot when u burn with nero, but now end up with no boot, wasting 4 of my dvd to try it,not just me but other people too, why dont u answer us when u upload something but you dont know how to show us or answer our question, i thought green skull is cool "
,jeffabe3,2011-02-09T07:45Z,Looks like crap.
,jazzmelody9,2011-02-10T04:11Z,shitty. I used vmware. It's a kiddie crap shit fuck. He's probably gay and ass fucked by his father.
,MrSmartyPants,2011-02-11T10:42Z,"@jazzmelody9:  Sounds like the ol' classic case of 'Someone is gay, but just doesn't want to admit it...'. Your graphic language suggests that you yourself would like to be reamed from the rear-end. Admit it, get 'er done, and accept your sexuality. There' nothing wrong with being gay.

Neener, neener, neener.  :)"

,CBelen19,2011-02-12T23:31Z,Is this for x86 or x64 bit?
,nazinfire,2011-02-13T01:15Z,Hey people if you cant believe this then download Windows Virtual PC from Microsoft.com and test this. It seems cool so I shall try this. Thanks Extremezone
,s_4170_va,2011-02-13T18:14Z,I've spent many times to download this fucking shit....!!!
,liamf91,2011-02-15T13:04Z,wow some ppl do not read the description sometime damn...its basically Windows 7..but slightly different... its a taster of what Windows 8 will be
,Windowsvista,2011-02-16T09:02Z,Horrible GUI. You really fucked up.
,.DORAEMON,2011-02-16T22:31Z,can anybuddy tell me how to comment

,.shinchan,2011-02-17T07:59Z,"is windows 8 is real or freak?

i thought that windows 8 is lunching in 2012-13"
,EatMySh1t,2011-02-18T17:12Z,"Look at all you haters. I assume none of you have made a custom version of windows or even know how. This isn't a mandatory download. If you don't like it, don't download it. Why not try something a little more challenging by being polite, any uneducated fuck can talk shit. 

Step your weight up not your hate up, niggas. "
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-02-19T09:43Z,"... I can't understand why people are asking if this is Windows 8.
How stupid do you need to be to think that? It clearly says 7 with modified theme everywhere. 
STOP ASKING IF THIS IS WINDOWS FUCKING 8!!!!"
,Download4All,2011-02-19T14:05Z,"LOL :)
Wow, is this really Windows 8?? Jeez, extremezone is even faster than Microsoft with this release. extremezone must be god!!!"
,serialhacker,2011-02-20T17:22Z,Really good version. Problem i have is after a few updates it has changed the personalized icons on the taskbar etc. But all in all its a nice version. Thanks :) 
,aski,2011-02-20T22:11Z,"Fuck Off, your fucking gay. It's fakeeeeee  I have traied it now and this is fake not boteble, old ver.2009. Kick him off."

Fuck Off, your fucking gay. It's fakeeeeee I have traied it now and this is fake not boteble, old ver.2009. Kick him off.

You twat. It clearly says it isn't actually windows 8! read the description. Secondly it is bootable your just a noob that can't even burn an image correctly. It is perfectly fine, use power iso or image burn to burn it! nero sucks IMO."
,Th3Dragon,2011-02-22T02:48Z,Not bad. Only thing is its only x86 (32 bit). Not x64.
,Dallas.Maverick,2011-02-22T03:46Z,I installed this program to replace a year old version of Windows 7 64 bit and it is working great.  No snags and I didn't need to touch the keyboard throughout the setup process.  It did take about 30 minutes to complete but it works great and looks good.  Now I'm trying to decide if I should put it on my new laptop I just bought.  Just remember to bypass the serial number and hit enter and your set.    Thanks ExtremeZone for sharing this Torrent.
,gaalen111,2011-02-25T17:35Z,"I cant boot with dvd. says ""Not Bootable Image"" in powerISO when I'm about to burn the iso"

,crossfire6,2011-02-27T17:46Z,I'm going to give this a try because extremezone rocks.  He always has.  And many of us out here appreciate him.
,crossfire6,2011-02-27T18:50Z,Unfortunately it does appear that this is non-bootable.  And also during beginning of desktop setup it does say that this is a July 2009 release.  Is that the latest release?

,eric205,2011-05-16T01:35Z,"I'm having the same problem as everyone else. I changed my bios settings so that it boots the CD first, but it just continues through to Windows 7 Home Premium (what I have right now). I tried installing it by just running setup.exe on the disk, but it just lists Windows 7 Home premium, Windows 7 professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, etc under where it asks which one you want to install. Any ideas?"
,Sjakiesjaak,2011-05-25T08:37Z,"You have to make a bootable usb-stick. Then copy all the files from the .iso to the usb and plug usb in pc and change biossettings so usb is first to boot.

Then it will start installing. At least this worked form me, because I had the same problem with a not bootable dvd."
,nicpurdo,2011-06-11T15:15Z,so its pretty much a face lift with a few minor OS changes?
,mearshadhasan,2011-07-03T21:58Z,"OK people the following method is sure to work 4 all. btw thanks extremezone 4 this wonderful torrent upload.

1- Burn the ISO file onto a dvd (i reccomend poweriso) using any speed. If you have already burnt the dvd but r unable 2 boot no problem ....(ur dvds are not wasted :D)
2- As in my case and most others you might not be able 2 boot by restarting.
3- Turn your pc on then insert the dvd ...right click the dvd drive and select open.
4- Run the setup.
5- Installation takes 30-60 mins (me 30 mins)
6- That's it install like a normal software ...select do not update and custom installlation is better.
7- Then activate windows (make it genuine) using any loader (i reccomend Daz loader).

ENJOY!

ALSO PLEASE RESPECT extremezone -ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTED UPLOADERS. IF A TORRENT HAS extremezone's NAME ALONG WITH IT THEN YOU CAN BLINDLY DOWNLOAD THAT TORRENT..WHETHER ITS A MOVIE OR A GAME OR ANYOTHER THING extremezone ALWAYS UPLOADS THE BEST PRINT, PERFECT CRACK ETC. SO PLEASE NEVA SHOW YOUR VULGARITY AGAINS'T THIS PERSON. "
,cwarrior,2011-08-14T15:37Z,It's asking me to register and stating i have 20 days left. I saw someone else asked the same question and there was no reply. Is there a key or should I just DL something else. 
,PESSO114,2011-10-02T13:45Z,I'm not seeing any changes except a new crappy looking taskbar and some slightly changed menus
,BearMosal,2011-11-21T22:16Z,Any chance of doing a x64 version of this used it and liked it but have 8 GB of ram so would need x64 to use all of my ram... Thanks Extremezone
