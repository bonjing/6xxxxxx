,the_shroud,2011-02-02T02:21Z,"Thx for GG. 
I was wondering if you'd consider Strange Days (movie directed by K. Bigelow n written by Jim Cameron). Doesn't seem to have any quality copy around tpb. Never mind small size...."
,cindal,2011-02-02T06:12Z,thank you!
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-02T08:38Z,"@the_shroud: When Ms. Bigelow won the Oscar for Hurt Locker I remembered seeing Strange Days years earlier and thinking: ""From clichĂŠs straight to Hollywood heaven"". Combination of Cameron's love to use and combine everything out there in night mare of perpetual deja-vu and Ms. Bigelow early inability to get off the acid, resulted in - strange Strange Days. Bad movie - to cut long story short, and I trashed BluRay back then. Sorry."
