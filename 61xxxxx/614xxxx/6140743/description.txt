The Royal Air Force Station Laarbruch was completed in 1954. In the following years the RAF stationed bombers and interceptor planes alongside the ever combat-alert Canberras. In a case of war those could have very quickly dropped nuclear bombs on different targets in the Soviet territory. After the downfall of the Iron Curtain, RAF Laarbruch was mainly used for operations in the Gulf region and the Balkans. As a result of the imminent withdrawal of the RAF from Germany, a concept for the future of the airbase had to be worked out.

2003 - four years after handover to the German authorities - commercial traffic commenced.
