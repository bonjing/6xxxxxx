I need help finding a movie (released in theaters this year--may not be out yet?) my daughter wants to see. 
I'm looking for the name ... The movie is a love story about a boy and girl growing up in a small town. They live next door to each other and go to school together. That's all she could tell me LOL! If someone can help that would be great!"
