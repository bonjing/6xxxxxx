I wonder if you can help me with my subtitles issues; I watch your movies on my mac using vlc and it worked perfectly, but know the same movies from yours, vlc shows the subtitles by rapid flash so itÂ´s impossible to read, I have been looking the on the vlc forum and elsewhere without solution, are you familiar with this problem?
Thanks again!"

,holyheck,2011-06-24T14:06Z,"Mounted the image with Daemon Tools virtual drive (could have extracted it this way too) and streamed the movie to my PS3 with Media Server. Then burnt the image to a DVD to archive it.

Perfect format and absolutely superb quality. Thanks HD-R-US!
