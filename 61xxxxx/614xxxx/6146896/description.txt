	Chaplin At Keystone: An International Collaboration of 34 Original Films. Vol. 2 (1914)
This is the DVDR and I have run it through FixVTS. I will upload the other DVDRs as I finish encoding the shorts to xvid, then upload all the xvids together.
I will not be archiving the DVDRs forever so keep that in mind.
