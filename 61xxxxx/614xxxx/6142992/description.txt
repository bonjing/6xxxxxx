Chaplin At Keystone: An International Collaboration of 34 Original Films. Vol. 1 (1914)

This is the DVDR and I have run it through FixVTS. I will upload the other 3 DVDRs as I finish encoding the shorts to xvid, then upload all the xvids together.

I will not be archiving the DVDRs forever so keep that in mind.
