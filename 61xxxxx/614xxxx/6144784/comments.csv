He was one of the first very low key voices on exposing the absolute fiat money system we live in & helped me to take the fight to the IRS for their brutal SS tactics to destroy peoples lives. No one is more well read with factual & expertise knowledge on how to reclaim your birthright as a free person in America. A true American patriot.
