American political writer, author, biographer, historian and the last surviving protÃ©gÃ© of the 20th century poet and political activist Ezra Pound, Eustace Mullins died February 2nd, 2010. 

Eustace Mullins (March 9, 1923 â€“ February 2, 2010) is a veteran of the United States Air Force, with thirty-eight months active service during World War II. A native of Virginia, he was educated at Washington and Lee University, New York University, the University of North Dakota and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, Washington, D.C.

While studying in Washington, he was asked to go to St. Elizabethâ€™s Hospital to visit the nationâ€™s most famous political prisoner, Ezra Pound. The outstanding literary figure of the twentieth-century, Pound had seen three of his pupils awarded the Nobel Prize, while it was denied to him because of his pronouncements as a native American patriot. Not only did Eustace Mullins become his most active protege, he is the only person who keeps Ezra Poundâ€™s name alive today, through the work of the Ezra Pound Institute of Civilization, which was founded shortly after the poetâ€™s death in Venice.

Eustace Mullins was the first writer to have a book burned in Europe since World War II; the first person to be fired from the staff of the Library of Congress for political reasons; and the first writer to reveal the true historical details of the Federal Reserve System, with which as become the source for the majority of all present-day information now available on the Federal Reserve; compiled from information obtained almost exclusively from the Library of Congress.

Published in 1952 by Kasper and Horton, New York, the original book on the Federal Reserve (published under the title Mullins on the Federal Reserve) was the first nationally-circulated revelation of the secret meetings of the international bankers at Jekyll Island, Georgia, 1907-1910, at which place the draft of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was written.

The author of such influential books as "Secrets of the Federal Reserve," "Murder by Injection," and "The Curse of Canaan," was harassed and kept under daily surveillance by the FBI for thirty-three years, without ever being charged with any offense.
