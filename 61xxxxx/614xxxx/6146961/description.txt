American History X (1998)

Director: Tony Kaye

Controversial topics are always likely to make powerful cinema. However if such a film is made badly it can be particularly bad. Fortunately American History X, which deals with the story of two Neo-Nazi brothers as one questions his convictions, is an exceptional film. A film on this topic was never going to be trivial but whilst some scenes are excruciating to watch, it is nonetheless compelling. This film makes a strong statement about the futility of racism and intolerance in general without the message getting in the way of the story at any point.

The realism of the portrayals due to brilliant acting in the lead roles means that whilst you may loath the characterâ€™s attitudes and opinions you realize that they are people not just stereotypes. Rather than seeing these young white kids as hideous fascists, you realize that they are more of a lost generation desperately seeking an identity in all the wrong places. They are the victims of exploitation as much as they are the promoters of intolerance.

This is the film that cemented Ed Norton as a superb leading actor after a string of excellent supporting roles and the underrated Edward Furlong also sensitively portrays his character in a very difficult role, leaving you with an unsettling mix of sympathy and abhorrence. There are a number of films on the same theme such as Romper Stomper and Made in Britain but American History X is the standout example of the group. Itâ€™s hard to believe that there are really people like this in the world and if any other film told me so I wouldnâ€™t believe it. American History X however is exceptional.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
