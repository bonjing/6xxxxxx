      Sir Gerry Robinson helps two families torn over what to
      write in their wills. Raymond is desperate to protect the Kent
      farm he has spent a lifetime building up and wants to leave it
      all to his sons, who work there, and leave out his daughter, who
      doesn't. But wife Jane isn't convinced this is fair. Meanwhile
      devout Muslims Khalid and Sara have raised their two daughters
      to be equal to their son, but the Koran states that boys should
      be left twice as much as their sisters. Khalid and Sara face a
      dilemma over making a will that is fair to their kids in
      contemporary Britain, while remaining true to their faith. Sir
      Gerry is assisted by top lawyer, Sue Medder, who sets out the
      legal options in each case, and writes the final wills. Sir
      Gerry gets all the family involved in the debate, because
      keeping problems secret is no way to solve them. Deciding who
      gets what in a will can be one of the toughest choices anyone
      can have to make. But making no decisions at all and dying
      without a will, can cause rifts that tear families apart.
