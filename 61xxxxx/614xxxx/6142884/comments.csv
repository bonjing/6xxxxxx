,olufsen01,2011-02-01T12:57Z,why is my coments hide?  SEED!  and have this plane 2d panel? i use 4 screens in my cokpit
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-01T13:04Z,seeding @ max
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-01T13:05Z,"yes, i think it has 2d paned"

,A380-800,2011-02-01T15:14Z,REQ dangerous Airports 1!!
,Capt.Jambo,2011-02-01T15:47Z,"Hello!

Thanx for upload.

For those wondering if this add-on has 2d panels, IT DOES NOT HAVE 2D PANELS.

@ NvidiaPhysX, If this is your own release why don't you share the latest version? something like V 1.22?"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-01T16:02Z,"@Capt. Jambo 

why not? "
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-01T16:06Z,"@a380-800

I will! but give me some time, I have to buy and before doing so I have to transfer money to another empty account that requires lots of paperwork etc. etc... don't worry I will do it but still don't know when"
,pumpernickel,2011-02-01T18:02Z,Just for info: It has no 2D panel - only in 3D.
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-01T18:06Z,thanks for seeding
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-01T18:20Z,thank you for seeding
,Capt.Jambo,2011-02-01T18:29Z,"NvidiaPhysX 

I do not understand your answer. Am I supposed to guess?

Once again thanx for sharing."
,Capt.Jambo,2011-02-01T19:09Z,"ok NvidiaPhysX, I have download this and read the info you made. Can we expect you to upload version 1.22, because we cannot download the updates from Aerosoft and the info stats that the crack will also work with updates.

Thanx again"
,BasilHoneycup,2011-02-01T19:25Z,"1.22 is already to be found on TPB, the FMC is more or less a luxery version of the GPS. Aerosoft did a great job on system simulations and graphics except for the FMS, no SIDS/STARS etc etc.. For you whom are used to PDMG or Wilco this AirbusA320 is like the Ariane B737 = it looks beautiful but is very incomplete. Thx for the upload "
,Thyx747,2011-02-01T19:47Z,Thanks NvidiaPhysX. Was waiting for this good upload
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-02T10:51Z,"@Capt Jambo

the v1.22 update requires v1.21 which indeed requires v1.20 which is shipped as a payware.

I have to buy v1.20 first.
All you need to do is wait for few hours and next comment in which there is link thank you"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-02T13:09Z,"@ Capt. Jambo

as per your request

v1.20, v1.21 and v1.22 are here

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6145294

req: aerosoft dangerous airports 1"
,Capt.Jambo,2011-02-02T20:01Z,"@ NvidiaPhysX

That indeed is an answer I was expecting, strait forward. I'm already downloading v 1.20, 21 and 22 from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6145294.

Once again thanx a lot for taking time and money to provide us with this bird.

As usual, I will seed full speed all torrents I download, this one will be no different.

RESPECT"
,moonknight,2011-02-03T14:21Z,"good work, very kind from you mate."
,placemat1212121,2011-02-06T18:57Z,"This installs and works a treat!
No 2D panel for those who are asking, but vitual cockpit is the only way these days for ultimate reality.
Superb sound and flight dynamics.
Thanks very much for the kind upload NvidiaPhysX!"
,STA122,2011-02-21T22:49Z,FMC isnÂ´t working with SID/STARÂ´s and when on Final at 200ft trim take nose down. Your upload is a fail
,CaptBigMac,2011-03-10T17:39Z,Thanks works great!
,rasta2465,2011-12-28T23:02Z,how can i uninstall this? because i want to install your 1.20 version. Thanks
,Head5hot,2012-06-04T19:35Z,Any chance for Extended Edition?
