I'm not too proud to admit that I'm shallow but I think the Stephen Hawking style delivery made it particularly hard to keep my attention. Furthermore, the presence of spelling errors etc seemed to diminish its credibility.


Don't get me wrong. I'm grateful for their efforts and I will continue to seed this; but I'd suggest that potential d/lers may want to just grab one of two excerpts and see if it appeals to you.

Again, all respect to the appropriate parties, but I thought I'd offer this suggestion to potential d/lers."

Again, thank You for helping seeding this ^^) btw, check Zeitgeist: Moving Forward ;)"
