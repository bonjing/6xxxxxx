,batman0129,2011-02-02T05:43Z,can you let me know step for step what i need to do to play this....i already have my xbox modded
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-02T09:05Z,"So i guess you need a profile that is associated with the DLC if you dont have Jtag.

so here's the version that doesnt require Jtag (it comes with the profile associated with the DLC)

,jaywhiz,2011-02-21T22:43Z,Hey Guys Sorry for sounding noob but I'm a little confused. I have a BenQ xbox 360 with LT+. Can I use this DLC? Don't know what Jtag is but I know my xbox can play backups even ones with AP2.5. Can someone please respond to me and let me know if this DLC will work for me? Thanks in advance for your time and patience.
