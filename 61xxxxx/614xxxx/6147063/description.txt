                       ----------------------------------

"The NeverEnding Story" (titled "The Never Ending Story (L'histoire sans fin)" in the French version) is the title song from the English version of the 1984 film The NeverEnding Story. The English version was performed by Limahl and Beth Anderson; the French version was performed by Limahl and Ann Calvert.[1] It was a success in many countries, reaching No. 1 Norway and Sweden, No. 2 in Austria, Germany and Italy, No. 4 in the UK and No. 6 in the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

Background and writing
----------------------
The song was composed by Giorgio Moroder with lyrics by Keith Forsey, although it (and other electronic pop elements of the soundtrack) is not present in the German version of the film, which features Klaus Doldinger's score exclusively.

Beth Anderson recorded her lyrics in America separately from Limahl's.[1] Anderson does not appear in the music video; frequent Limahl backup singer Mandy Newton lip syncs Anderson's lyrics.

As a reference to the film and its title, the song has no distinctive beginning, nor an end. While many songs fade out, NeverEnding Story not only fades out, but also fades in, thus making it "never ending".

Lyrics
------
Turn around - look at what you see.
In her face the mirror of your dreams.
Make believe on everywhere
get it in the line.
Hidden on the pages is the answer
To a never ending story.

Reach the stars
fly a fantasy
Dream a dream and what you see will be.

Rhymes that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon the rainbow is the answer
To a never ending story
story.
Show your fear
for she may fade away
In your hands the birth of a new day.

Rhymes that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds . ..
Never ending story
never ending story
never ending story . . .
