I understand your uploading issue.
I am an uploader in TPB since 2004, i never had such an issue till 2010.

From 31st December 2010 to February 5th 2011 i had the same issue, I was able to do every thing except uploading.

I asked in suprbay but no one replied to my post,
Finally it got fixed by itself on 5th february.

I kept trying every day, But no luck.

Researched in google but no one had this problem ever, This problem remained like an unsolved puzzle for me.

Best of luck.
