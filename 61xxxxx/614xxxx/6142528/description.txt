Shruti (Anushka Sharma) is a 20-something no-nonsense girl from a middle class Delhi household.
Focused and determined with preplanned ambitions, her goals in life are well laid out by the time she reaches her final year of college.
Bittoo (Ranveer Singh), on the other hand, has no real aim in life. As a final year college student of Delhi University, he whiles away his life having fun with his buddies, barely scraping through his exams.
