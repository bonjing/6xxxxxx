From the Infowars web site ::

 
Alex welcomes back to the show Michigan attorney Kurt Haskell who was a passenger on Flight 253, infamous for the so-called underwear bomber. Haskell blew the whistle on the sharp dressed man who delivered patsy Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to the flight. Mr. Haskell says the government is lying to him and his fellow Americans about what really happened. 



Alex also covers the latest news on Wikileaks, Egypt, and other breaking news stories....

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:
sebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
