Winter is not the most popular season for taking landscape photographs, but Bill Fortney shows us that there is still plenty to capture at his favorite spots in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. While grand landscape photography captures the beauty of a large scene, intimate landscape photography focuses on small, unique parts of that landscape and extracts from the overall scene. During this course, Bill recommends equipment for getting started with landscape photography. He talks about image composition, the importance of texture, and how he uses lines of direction when composing his photos. In later lessons, Bill takes viewers into his digital darkroom to talk about his favorite processing techniques and software. Follow along as Bill teaches photographers how to find, compose, and create wonderful, intimate landscape photographs.
