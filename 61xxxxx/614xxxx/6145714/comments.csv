If you had the comprehension to fully read my post, in no way was I being a quote-unquote ""#*&%$"". It wouldnt play in WMP, who gives. I USED VLC (like I said in the original post... make sure you read that part) and still had colour issues.

For anyone who actually cares and/or has similar issues:

Using Win7 32-bit
VLC v1.1.6

Thanks for your help tho >.>

PS Fix your broken screen link. Its basic e-knowledge how to link stuff. 

Have a nice day."
