,dinraat,2011-02-15T04:34Z,There is no file in the crack folder. Please leae detailed instructions to install software.
,Torent.Spy,2011-02-19T05:15Z,"dinraat and other:
once you finish download 
click on crack folder
click on patch icon
click on install
after installation completed
click on patch and navigate to location where spotmau was installed  and you are done.
don't be confused with  setup folder don't use it.
everything you need to do is thru crack folder and patch icon.
thanks carter67 again"
,jondola,2011-02-20T23:07Z,I tried as you said and when I click on the patch it says dynamic library bassmod.dll cannot be found. What's up with that?
,MCHass,2011-02-24T19:18Z,I second the missing file.
,dragongator,2011-03-03T02:29Z,"Followed instructions, did not click on anything else, but when I click on the patch it says dynamic library bassmod.dll cannot be found. So, what's your suggestion? How comes other guys can get it right? Where that f*****g bassmod.dll disappeared? Why it's not there? I'd very like to get this stuff up and running. Any help?"
,dragongator,2011-03-03T02:43Z,"Ok, guys, make sure you right click on crack file and run as administrator, otherwise you will end up with '' dynamic library bassmod.dll can not be found''."
,torz02,2011-03-14T15:36Z,can i reset windows 7 password using spotmau?
,itworks22,2011-03-26T08:14Z,"Downloaded and installed following instructions. 

Created myself a bootable CD with repair tools on it and within 30 minutes of the download, had fixed a troublesome computer that had boot problems (hitherto I would have had to format such a situation).

Very pleased - thank you."
[T],carter67,2011-03-26T15:36Z,@itworks22 Glad it did the biz for you

,dragongator,2011-04-19T15:24Z,@carter67 -Thanks a lot for great upload. Downloaded it second time for my other PC. Works brilliant on Windows7 Ultimate. Just what I needed. 
,maxximilan,2011-04-21T01:51Z,"trouble first time..""can't find Bin-0"" something like that. so redownloaded and works great. be sure to install from the patch!

thank's carter67"
,mike18xx2,2011-05-04T01:15Z,"I certainly hope that the incompetents at Spotmau have finally made a version that will work on a Netbook (whose odd screen sizes prevented previous versions from working because Spotmau's un-sizable screens had the ""next"" button dropped off the bottom edge of the screen)."
,mike18xx2,2011-05-04T02:02Z,Bad news: Spotmau is still incompetent. Apparently it has never occurred to them that someone might want to attach a USB optical-drive to a netbook.
,wizzkid1970,2011-05-13T23:31Z,"very bad program nearly fucked up my 2000 pound computer !!  i used the registry cleanup and it seemed to be ok until when i restarted the comp it wouldnt boot up!! had to use my 64 bit repair disk to restore the comp to the previous day , too scary as i have 700 gigs of programs intalled for my work , so dont use this for 64 bit i dont know for others"
,Pursacat,2011-07-03T21:55Z,I agree there is a file missing. I can use most of the program but the registry cleaner. It freezes up and a notification pops up that a dll file is missing. 
,jabunk20,2011-09-11T00:44Z,THaks ya fella 
,jabunk20,2011-09-11T00:45Z,Hope i can handle this 
,Anna_Flactic,2011-10-09T22:39Z,Same problem as the others. no bassmod.dll   It w happens even if I run as adminisrator...maybe crack won't work on Vista...
,Shockle,2011-10-23T04:32Z,"Those of you that cant find Crack.exe in the crack folder then you like me are lucky, because norton 360 removed it as i was downloading due to a Trojan in the file.

Everyone else without good anti virus software has been infested.

To the uploader: Stick your virus torrent up your ass you sad excuse for a human being. 

Get a life.  FAKE"
,Shockle,2011-10-23T04:33Z,VIRUS
,derrycummins,2011-11-15T18:09Z,"u dumb-ass noobs know fuk-all!!!

Norton & other virus checkers show most patches & code gen's as virus's but are in reality false positives.... u need shut down ur virus checker before u download/open this & many other files on thepiratebay. To do this safely, read feedback from other users. Now, this is where dumb-ass comments like yours confuse people.....    Before you post negative feedback like yours, take the time to LEARN what the fuck it is YOU are doing first, & if u dnt know what it is your doing, KEEP IT SHUT!!!

Thanks loads carter67 for your time in sharing this with me & all the others.

To all piratebay users:
Remember, thepiratebay isnt just a site for downloading free stuff for fuk-all.... it's a file-SHARING site, so if your not contributing files for others, PLEASE SEED! & help keep this system working for when you come back here."
