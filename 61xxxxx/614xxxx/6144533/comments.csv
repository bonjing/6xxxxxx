,kats76,2011-02-06T04:06Z,can you plz tell me were to get the 18.1 patch
,xS5daZ,2011-02-14T10:01Z,"LOL @haydn70ac

Did it even occur to you that perhaps all those other uploads you happen to see on this website, might be from other individuals who have for one reason or the other decided to contribute anonymously instead of under a user profile.

You are such a retard!!!"
,xS5daZ,2011-02-14T10:09Z,"To the anonymous uploader.

Thank you for the newer version. It is very selfless of you to claim no credit for your contribution. My best wishes to whoever you are.

I will seed to keep your torrent alive as long as I can, or until the subsequent version comes out.

And to people who are successfully running the previous cracked version 18, you need not uninstall it in order to install this one. Just install this over the previous copy and it should update, bypassing you the need to activate it again."
