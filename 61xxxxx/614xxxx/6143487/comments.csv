Buffy.The.Vampire.Slayer.S08.BluRay.MOTION.COMIC.480p.H264

and category should be... let say... different.

Sorry."

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-01T19:51Z,"@è¶³dark_defender: Yeah - but movie is 2h50 long, even as 480p would be 1.37GB and - probably doomed by that, as happened maybe month ago with U-Boot (just Hit&Runs and mutihanebi and me as seeders. 
Don't get me wrong, but no, thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-01T19:55Z,"mutihanebi = muthineni

Plain typo, sorry."
,jon4fun,2011-02-02T00:44Z,"Excellent stuff and well worth the DL for any fans of Joss Whedon.
20-40 has worked his usual genius and really high quality in a relatively small size for what you get.

I really enjoyed this and can't recommned it highly enough to fans of Joss.

,ankit280,2011-02-02T15:10Z,"thanks.. 
could you please consider 
Outside Providence
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125971/
it's one of the best movies of Amy Smart apart from Road Trip obviously"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-02T17:34Z,"@ankit280: Amy is one of the prettiest actresses, no doubt about. I like watching her in movies, but  Outside Providence was released on VHS and on very hard to get DVD only, never was aired in times of HDTV nor released as BluRay.
I have my personal fav with Amy and Anne Faris (with single decent role of Ryan Reynolds in his life) - Just Friends from 2005. Incredible funny and best rendering of Brittney Spears from Anne Faris ever seen. That one I can encode and maybe I would find some DVDrip of Providence."
,ankit280,2011-02-03T10:20Z,"thank you man.. even a dvdrip would be great.. and yeah Just Friends is good too.. i have it but please encode for other Amy fans here
thanks again for the reply :)"
