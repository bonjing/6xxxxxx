     A Theologian presents a logical explanation on how to think through the logic that proves unequivocally that there is only one God who is the source of everything in reality. God Exists. This video is for persons that are sincerely interested in understanding how to explain what they already know to be true: namely that God does exist and creates all everything and sustains everything. If you deny Gods existence then this video is not for you. If you would like to believe in God then listening to and understanding this video will satisfy you. It takes a lot of concentration to grasp what is being said in this presentation so I would recommend you find a quiet place where you can watch the video undisturbed.
