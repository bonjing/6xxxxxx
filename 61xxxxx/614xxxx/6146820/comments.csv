[T],timelyone,2011-02-05T11:33Z,"Last I heard I can post anything I want and you don't have to even look at it because you are also free to post what you want. Do you think posting stuff about God is bad like porn? Or what is your problem? Thoreau said ""you can tell a person's level of spiritual maturity by the amount of truth they can take without becoming angry or upset."" Why do you waste your time even making a negative comment? Watch the video over and over until the light comes on. Be happy."

Im not christian myself but find stuff like thiis about historical and mythology interests. Many good morals are in it as well not just bad.
