run/servises/ then scroldown list untill you find windows activation. right click it,goto properties and disable, you can still use windows update.
only do this when you have activated your copy.
if services is not showing windows activation you will have to wait untill it installs as a update, dont worry this can be turned off.

hope this helps you all "
