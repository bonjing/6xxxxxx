,highcall,2011-02-03T17:39Z,"cant find the patch and crack also, only system information files, maybe its not compatible with win 7 x64?"
[T],rlf-rls,2011-02-03T18:38Z,"Your antivir blocked these files, make an exception
because i see all files in my win7 x64"

I'm thinking this is because v1.18.9 didn't offer a Late Night update.. any body else have this problem or am I missing something..?"
,bobbie23,2011-09-11T05:49Z,when i try to install patch it says i don't have the game installed. i think it may have something to do with me upgrading to windows 7 and i don't want to reinstall/re-download the game. any thing i can do?
