momonkey89, it can't be ""tracked"", it goes threw too many routers, fake IP's, everything. So smd and call me lucy. 
And ""Slicknsly"" Don't be such a faggot. Go download a fucking converter and quit being a little bitch and trying to say that ""themanuel08""'s shit is bad, it's probably good quality and your the first in like 12 comments to say it was shit. so go get laid by a horse you cock mongrel."

,MoonFangSkyImpact,2011-09-04T00:34Z,"I has problem. No audio on half of them. (mkv plays fine until this season, and only half of them have no audio"
,Illkryn,2011-09-13T03:07Z,"MKV > AVI
MKV is vastly superior to AVI as, unlike AVI it can hold multiple audio tracks, subtitles and video's.

Also, unlike AVI, it can be in bluray quality.
If you REALLY want to watch it on your tv, get a HDMI cable if it's a HDTV or a Svideo cable.

If you somehow have trouble with MKV files, besides the fact you deserve to die for being so stupid, download the K-Lite codec pack, it is far more updated than CCCP and is still actively updated.

http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm be sure to use Media Player Classic that comes with it, it's much better than Windows Media Player or VLC Media Player."
,zach96100,2012-01-06T06:41Z,half of them don't have audio and others have parts where the audio isn't very good at all
,Mdultra,2012-06-03T18:42Z,"If you want to play mkv files on windows media player without problems install the cccp package.
