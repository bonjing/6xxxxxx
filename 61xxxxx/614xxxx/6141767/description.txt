Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years

Adrian is now in his thirties and living in London, where he works as an offal chef in a trendy Soho restaurant, Hoi Polloi. Divorced from a Nigerian wife, he has a five-year-old son, William, who lives with Adrian\'s parents, now reunited, in Ashby-de-la-Zouch. Pauline Mole is resentful and bored, husband George is bedridden with clinical depression emanating from long-term unemployment and impotence. Rosie, George\'s foul-mouthed daughter from his relationship with \'Stick Insect\', also lives with them. Pandora, meanwhile, with a university doctorate, has become a power-crazed Tory-in-disguise \'Blair babe\', standing as the Labour candidate in Ashby and duly winning her seat in the House of Commons. Adrian, who has become something of a whiny nerd, is still profoundly in love with Pandora, and he constantly envisages himself as crucial to her future, in either a political or matrimonial role. She, however, verbally cruel and relentlessly ambitious, will have none of it. Her father Ivan, with unfulfilled sexual urges, is not shy to cross the bridge, though, dallying with Pauline Mole.
