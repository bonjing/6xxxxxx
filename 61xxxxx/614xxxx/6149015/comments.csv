,Ainokami,2011-02-05T11:04Z,"jesterjive: This is a musical though, so it benefits from better sound more then an action movie would.

Good quality, definitely DVD rip. Gotta admit I loved the movie. It was corny but great. Will be buying it."

,Bron80,2011-02-06T09:38Z,"I don't doubt that anything from extremezone isn't real....  the reason i asked if it was real was i've downloaded things that have said dvdrip, while its still on at the movies, and i get 30 seconds on and it sayd codec error.  I just wanted to make sure i was getting a true rip.

Btw...  I've only been using TPB for a couple of months...  Maybe you people with more expeience with downloading torrents should remember that not everyone has been doing it forever!!!"

,9GustavBecker9,2011-02-07T10:27Z,"The French have a saying, it's, ""I wanna fuck you in your pussy, then whip it out, slap your pretty face cheeks, then bust my chillshlockmafathakookie all over your face."" This famous phrase got its origin while repeatedly being chanted in the theaters where the girls performed. Thus the entomology was created, and the words have obviously stuck... literally. Please chant this phrase while watching this movie, if not for your own satisfaction, but to let the girls know you still care. By the way..., if you listen close, you can hear the showgirls farting when performing a strenuous dance move. The French call this, ""fanny fart for fuck, stick shaft suck suck suck; titties tush to trot, bitch bum butt boom barf; mouth meat munch my mastrubator, pussy pound pop plop...., see ya later."" Yes, the French are beautiful. Arevoiur!"
,Steven633,2011-02-07T15:03Z,"Cheers Gustav, I was quite recently thinking about the origin of the word ""chillshlockmafathakookie"". In fact, rarely a day goes by without me thinking ""where does that word come from?"" Now I know. I think I will spend the rest of the day going about telling random people the meaning of this fab word.

Cheers mate. :D"

,madmunk83,2011-03-05T03:45Z,"For all the geniuses that decided to start downloading material without a bit of research, here it goes....... If you don't like burning to 2 disks then you obviously don't have a good converter software, if you were to dl a converter  it would put everything together on one disk for you, same thing goes for you guys with no sound and all those other assorted problems. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD AND BURN A GOOD MOVIE THRU YOUR MEDIA BURNER WITH OUT CONVERTING THE FORMATS FIRST......  So quit bitching at the up loaders because of your noobie mistakes dumb ass's...
Thanks and have a nice day.

...idiot - that's just some ""fuck you"" way of saying ""my internets is faster than your internets""

300 - 400kbs down is still considered pretty fast, especially when you consider that as many as 50% of torrent users are still getting speeds of less than 20% of that.

quit yer bitching and be thankful you don't have dial-up speeds - i remember when films took days to download at less than 3kbs!"
