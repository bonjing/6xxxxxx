is the reaction of anti-virus programs on the protector, which are protected cracked files. disable av or to file exceptions to the Anti-Virus.

clemlenain,
install all from folder Support. and check content.dll, may antivirus has blocked or deleted this file.

2all: read above written."

Disabled AV during install, 1st run, and a torrent ""Force Re-Check"".  I did not have the Bing toolbar installed as reported. Thanks for trying guys."
