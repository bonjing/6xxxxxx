A/9
V/8
Ok teen slash/horror movie...
The picture get's a bit pixelated in some of the darker scenes, but it's mostly ok...
Many Thanx to .BONE. and MegaPlay for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

Compare the runtimes:

On IMDb it's listed with 96 minutes. The ""DVDRip"" has 89 minutes (@ 23,976fps). So about 7 minutes are missing. Don't waste your time. Apart from that, the movie is shit anyway."
