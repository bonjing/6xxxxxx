,ekarth22,2011-02-02T05:27Z,"ya dude but you uploaded this in a wrong section.

put it in GAMES>PC"
,ThuyDez,2011-02-02T09:36Z,"ekarth22, It's a program, not a game."
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-02T11:26Z,"@ekarth22

Yeah, seeing as how it is just an application, a trainer. I didn't put it under games, as it isn't a game.

@ThuyDez

Have you used it yet?"
,ThuyDez,2011-02-02T11:46Z,"I'll try it when I get home, don't wanna torrent it on the schools wifi.

the crackfix that Black_Dragon(or something) uploaded only works to chapter 12 on the drill for me, so I only have like a 10-minute try-out on it."
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-02T13:42Z,"@ThuyDez

Use this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6136984/Dead_Space_2_CRACKFIX-FLT

I've beaten the entire game using it. It works just fine."
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-02T13:53Z,"A lot of people have already DL'd it, but most aren't seeing, for the 27 others seeding along with me, thank you.

Sadly, no one has commented on what they think of the trainer yet, or said thanks :/

oh well, guess I shouldn't have expected much in the first place :D"
,ThuyDez,2011-02-02T15:53Z,"Tried both the trainer and the crackfix, both worked without a hitch.

Could've added an on-trainer text to open game first, then trainer, but other than that there's really no complaints here, Thanks. +1"
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-02T18:37Z,"@ThuyDez

Ahh, yeah I probably should have added that in the first place, my bad D:

I'll remember to add it in future releases!

Also, I'm glad everything worked for you!

Enjoy!

:D"
,erabu,2011-02-02T19:52Z,"great work man, tested it and works like a charm, many thanks and dont be disaponted because they dont comment or say thank, sharing is about giving without expecting others to give back keep up the good work "

Pull it out of the rar first, then execute it.

Tell me if that works."
,Griften,2011-02-04T03:50Z,Does this unlock the Rivet Gun?
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-04T05:26Z,"@Griften

No. DLC unlocks can not be done with trainers unless it is content that is included with the normal game, but is hidden. The rivet gun is part of another data file not included in the base version.

This trainer is mainly for people who are struggling, or have beaten everything in the game and just feel like raping shit."
,TheChaosKing,2011-02-05T20:29Z,It wont even let me drag it out of the Rar when I do nothing happens

,DeadooDeadooDeadoo,2011-02-07T16:40Z,"thank you Sil3nt Pr0digy!

works like a charm :) works fine with new game+

just run this as admin and make sure your anti virus software isn't blocking access. Just open this before you run the game and then use the numpad on the main menu. That's what I did and it works perfectly.

Just one thing you could add on to this trainer, Infinite health ;) 

cheers "
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-08T02:33Z,"@DeadooDeadooDeadoo

I would love to, but as I said earlier, the visceral team did some funky things with the numbers. And while I am very good at code injection, I still have problems following multi-level pointers to the base number struct for the player. As such I cannot find the root values for the player, such as health.

:/

Sorry, I tried tho :D"
,ThuyDez,2011-02-09T15:34Z,"I wonder if it's possible to unlock armors and weapons that you get from Newgame+ and Hardcore mode (such as Riot Security Armor and Foam Finger Gun) with a trainer.

speaking of the FFG, cleared out Hardcore with the Collectors Edition (MULTI-3) and newgame+'d Zealot, no FFG. I assume it's the version bug they've been talking about, but it shouldn't be that hard to make a trainer about it... right?

and as for Health... well yeah, any new game has Health on a Float point (on my Cheat-Engine, it says this)
Address: P->16051F28
Type: Float
Value: 40

Hope that helps."
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-09T20:25Z,"@ThuyDez

yeah but the real health variable is under a lot of pointers, i will try to make my trainer versions in the future have it, but i can't guarantee anything.

And no, extra suits and things like that can only be unlocked if you have that version (like zealot suit can only be unlocked if you have CE) because it contains extra data in the .DAT files."
,ThuyDez,2011-02-09T23:23Z,"then how about a trainer for the CE version?
would that work?"
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-12T03:55Z,"@ThuyDez

The zealot suit should already be unlocked if you have it :/"
,shad3333,2011-02-12T11:28Z,Thx mate ... you rock .... kip up the good work :)
,garryzen,2011-02-12T18:23Z,dude d trainer seems 2 be workin fyn but the option of 99 items doesnt working properly
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-12T22:42Z,"@ garryzen

Have at least 1 of the item in you inventory, turn on the option, then use it, it will turn the 1 item into 99.

I've tested it with all items, semiconductors, ammo, and even weaps, it works.

If you are still trying and having difficulties tell me exactly what you are doing and I will do my best to walk you through it."
,hellastriker,2011-02-13T08:54Z,"I cant seem to get it working.

do you have to load the trainer first then launch the game? or maybe the trainer doesn't work on hardcore mode."
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-13T15:03Z,"@hellastriker

The trainer does work in hardcore mode. Make sure that you do not have an anti-virus blocking it, that very well may be the problem."
,infernoic3,2011-02-15T17:01Z,"i wanted to know does this work with the FairLight crack ver? cause i don't get how to use it that well. i turned on the game, ran the app, loaded my save and try pushing the keys and nothing shows? or no pop up or anything."
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-15T18:01Z,"@infernoic3

I didn't include pop ups or sound effects because most people tend to find them to be annoying, the effects still work, simply press them once, they are turned on, push again to turn off.

The crack from FLT works perfectly with the trainer, I tested it all myself.

Simply turn it on, press one, and go into a no oxygen environment, and you should see your oxygen limit set to ""343.0"" a little nod towards my lucky number. Same for Infinite Ammo (No Reload) simply turn it on, fire your weapon, and the ammo is set to 343."
,althea2216,2011-04-19T10:09Z,cool thx man
,MonkeyPirate419,2011-05-07T04:34Z,"Doesn't work with the new patch.
Update please?
Other than that, this is an awesome trainer, great job, but could we get some indication of what is enabled? I know with oxygen levels they stay at 343, but money and nodes is a little harder to tell. Last time i played with these, my money was at 343,000 and then it shot to 999999.

,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2012-03-08T12:36Z,"Sorry guys, I've been busy. If you guys can tell me what the latest patch is, I'll patch my DS2 and get to working on updating it."
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2012-03-08T14:35Z,"I checked both my cracked, and steam versions. There has been no patches for DS2. If the trainer isn't running correctly check to make sure that your anti-virus isn't preventing it's code injection. You shouldn't need to run it as admin either, but if it helps, go ahead."
