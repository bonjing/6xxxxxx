*Release Notes...: It looks like this show changed networks mid-season during the first season causing some confusion as to what
		   the current season is.  As far as I can tell, this is the first and only episode aired on Discovery and all
		   the following episodes were National Geographic including the current season.  So what was previously
		   released as season one episodes ('The Hustle' and 'Prison City') are actually season 2.  Sorry for the
		   mix-up.
