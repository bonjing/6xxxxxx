[color=Red]IMPORTANT NOTES[/color]
PLS READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING
-----------------------------------------
I need to apologise to everyone who has already downloaded version 1 of this torrent, I discovered there were 2 episodes missing 
shortly after I'd started seeding it but rather than stop and restart from scratch I decided to let it finish and then issue this update.
 As things worked out tho it means I am able to substitute the current copies of episodes 225 & 226 with the new copies I have just finished
 encoding from a new source I found last night, they are far better quality than the current resized copies of the NATV release.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[color=Red]Instructions for loading existing torrent folder[/color]
---------------------
When you download the torrent file for this updated copy of the series you need to make certain that the download location is the same as the existing 

folder,
 ie C:/user/.././My Videos/Batman the Brave and the Bold Seasn 2 complete{C_P} 
this can usually be done on the box your torrent client opens when you open open a torrent file, if you have a default folder set it should find the 

folder automatically but you may need to stop the torrent and right click on it and select "advanced >" then "set download location" from the dropdown 

menu.
Once the folder location is set as the same as the existing one your client should automatically check the files and will load everything you have 

already downloaded, if this does not happen automatically right click the torrent again and select "Force re-check", if it does not load the existing 

files re check the download location.
Another way to do it is to allow the torrent download enough to create a new folder then stop it cut/paste all the files from the existing folder into 

the new one, making sure you select "replace existing files" when asked and again force the client to do a re-check.
 Once your client is showing the 22 episodes that are identical in both torrents it will then only need to continue downloading the 4 new, updated 

files.
Once again, sorry for the hassle but the new copies of 225 and 226 wioll make it worth the effort.
