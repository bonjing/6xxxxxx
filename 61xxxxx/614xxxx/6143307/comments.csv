,th3dd,2011-02-04T08:29Z,"Gave the doubleclick a try after McAfee said Office 2010 Toolkit.exe was clean. First thing: I'm asked for elevated permissons, I say: No. Instantly a file called vbc.exe is blocked by the firewall. I kill it and go check for system changes: 4 files are placed on autorun: 

663explorer.exe	 	
555explorer.exe
359explorer.exe
714explorer.exe

Should mention that two of them have the same icon as the exe in this torrent. 

Not in the mood to see what theyÂ´d do if launched.

Files are placed on C:\Users\username\appdata\roaming and are +H so youÂ´ll only see them if youÂ´re showing system files. 

I did set a restore point before running the file, because of this very silly request on the readme.txt

mosca34, my guess is that you used a translator to put a braziliam portuguese sentence in english. Poor effort, give the community some credit and go try to infect your classmates "
