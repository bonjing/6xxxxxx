,sonambula,2011-02-01T19:47Z,I have a feeling that the two shows story lines will begin to be different eventually.  There are slight differences in the two shows.  For example Sally (US) can't leave the house while Annie (UK) left the house in the original pilot episode & saved George's girlfriend & since then has had no problem going outside.  In the US version Aidan finally got Josh's voice mail and saved Josh's sister. Still I don't think the US show can be better than the UK version.  I don't see the point of two versions. Maybe it would have been better if the new British webisodes would have been set in the US & that was the US version that aired here. It would have made much more sense than just starting a whole new copy cat version of Being Human.
