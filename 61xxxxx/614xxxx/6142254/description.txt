This is not the Kevin Bacon movie! I've only got a 128kbps upload so this may take a while, but super seeding is on.

One of the most retardedly fucked up movies ever, from the crew of the Jason Ellis show on Sirius/XM.

It's the story of group of teens going out to the Australian bush for a drug filled vacation, only to find out they are not alone...
