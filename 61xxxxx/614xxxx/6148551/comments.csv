Other than that little snafu... all is well!!

After installing whatever version of Windows 7 you want, run all updates EXCEPT for 971033!!

Then run the Windows 7 Loader."
,knight717,2011-02-04T23:13Z,"After running the updates, remember to permanently disable Windows Update in System Properties and to go into Action Center and turn off notifications that Windows Update is turned off."

,blahgirl,2011-02-11T02:05Z,how do i boot from this disk?
,knight717,2011-02-11T05:46Z,"It is a bootable image, just burn it using ISOBuster, Nero or MagicISO."
,liamf91,2011-02-18T22:04Z,"say u burn at max speed, or faster than x4. will affect the install.... i downloaded a different version
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6150512/Microsoft_Windows_7_Ultimate_EIRR_x86-x64_v10.12.27

it has the .iso and 3other files... well i burned the iso onto a disk and ran it on to a blank hdd.. it goes into the installation, but when it is on the ""expanding file"" part it says ""not all allocated file are available""...

now it gives me an error message everytime i boot saying no BOOTMGR ctrl alt dlt to restart

any suggestions?"
,liamf91,2011-02-19T17:25Z,"well this torrent doesnt seem to want to work at all 

i can burn it to dvds, but cant set it for a bootable file... every time i try to boot from it, it brings up the no BOOTMGR error."
,liamf91,2011-02-19T19:05Z,"well just opened the ISO to see whats in there.. it had an ISO in it... tried to extract that, to a folder, nothing in there..just a waste of a download"

,Prosperpexa,2011-03-06T15:15Z,Windows 7 Loader is recognized by my AV as a trojan.
,NoZen,2011-03-13T12:37Z,"Works perfect!
Thank you....
I'm running it in virtual box on my macbook pro..

Burnt to disc with Mac's Disk Utility at 4x speed..

I have a question though... At the registration page I didn't put anything, obviously, and hit continue... I haven't been receiving any messages to update....how do I run the windows loader?"
,Exagerative,2011-09-08T04:33Z,Does this work for mac bootcamp? Thanks in advance.
,vginamite,2011-09-28T16:32Z," yeah, I too tried to burn the winRAR: but I finally remembered to (non-f*cktardly) burn the iso instead. So lucky I got the ""gormet expensive"" dvd-rw discs. Eat Vaginamite with But -ter."
