With almost all of the first year tapes erased 
by the BBC, this is the start of the 2nd Season 
of The Morecambe & Wise Show, which as with the 
3rd year is a joy to watch because we get to see women 
(such as series regular Ann Hamilton) in miniskirts again.

There were only 4 episodes made for the 1969 season, 
making it the briefest of them all.  The fourth of these 
with Edward Woodward was the first one I uploaded in January.

This was the first year that heavyset Janet Webb started 
thanking the audience at the end, for a show she otherwise 
had nothing to do with!  ::)
