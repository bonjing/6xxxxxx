Anybody care to translate to english?"
,665w4w2d,2011-02-05T19:42Z,whats a good site to get subtitles from?  great up btw..
,tapper101,2011-02-06T01:35Z,"Holy shit. It's not often a sequel is that good, omg. City of God is still the best Brasilian move though."
,SoloParaEstaVez,2011-02-06T03:24Z,"If you must watch the movie before a descent Eng. sub file is released, you can do this:

Download the Port. srt from http://www.subs.to/ (Just search for Tropa de Elite 2 and you'll find it).

Then open the srt in a text editor and copy everything, including time codes, into a translator (I used Google translate).

Finally, open a new txt file, paste the translated subs, and save as an srt.  (Before doing this I had to change all ""->"" to ""-->""  ...for some reason Google translate changed this on me.

Once you change the extension of your newly translated subs from txt to srt, VLC player will read it just like any other srt.

*Of course, there are other ways to do this, but you get the idea.  The translations aren't perfect, but it's the best we can do until a real translation is released."
