,StillSmokin,2011-02-02T11:57Z,"I've decided to put out a fixed version where i fixed some errors.  I would like to wait a couple of days so people could report any more glitches.....so if you find one leave a comment and i will try to fix it.
Also when i upload the fixed version i will try to leave a link on this torrent in the comments."
