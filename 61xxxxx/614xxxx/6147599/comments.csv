:)"
,Rugburn54,2011-02-05T13:23Z,Great up. Can't complete without a seed though. Thanks again.
[V],Scrufuss,2011-02-06T03:24Z,"I was waiting for that. 
My client has NEVER been off line for the last 4 days. Its been seeding everything, wait your turn."
,Rugburn54,2011-02-06T03:53Z,It's really nice of you to respond regardless of the accuracy of your statement. Your server may not be offline but it's not seeding this torrent. Thanks just the same.
,sparky280260,2011-02-08T22:14Z,Hi there. could someone please seed - been stuck at 84.6% for days now.  thanks in advance
[V],Scrufuss,2011-02-13T08:19Z,Ive uploaded over 3 gigs of this 2 gig torrent. ITS ALWAYS been seeding. Never stopped.. I DO NOT know why it would not let finish since I haven't messed with any settings or ip filters or whatever
