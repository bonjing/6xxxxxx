They have all sorts of tutorials to help for things like this.
Knock yourself out.
You will have a more pleasant experience if you look for the
answers yourself before you ask the admins.


There will always be at least 1 seeder of these .ISO files for at
least 3 months after posting so don't complain about no seeders and all leeches or it is too slow or not moving cus if you do its easier for me to delete the torrent then to listen to you wine. :)
