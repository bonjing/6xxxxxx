,orangetj,2011-09-13T23:05Z,i wont critisize you for it but the reason why they include the multiples of songs in discographies is because 90% of the time from  album to album they change up the songs sound like changing the bass resonace and all to give it a new sound
,thescruffy,2011-09-17T23:26Z,"Cool Story Bro.. well if you want, feel free to change the EQ on your Ipod so u can also change a song & give it a whole new sound :|
FFS i dont give a fuck.."
,CallMeJHWH,2011-10-11T03:22Z,"Cool, thanks man. I mainly wanted this file just for ""Superstar"", but im trying to beef up my music playlist. currently up to 15,000 songs. 

i'll seed 2:1, as usual. It really is important to seed. At least do it for the Karma."
