Almost perfect video and audio. Hard coded chinese subtitles and silly english subtitles. 
Better ones to be found here, http://subscene.com/english/Shaolin/subtitle-407284.aspx
although they'll be displayed on top of the hard coded chinese ones. Still pretty decent reading."
,DaVitsche,2011-02-03T16:03Z,"The available subtitles go out of sync after 0:56. It is as if 1 sec is cut off the previous scene, the music in that scene stops abrupt as well. Subs go well up untill that point."
,tempid123,2011-02-04T19:31Z,"Why the hell Chinese film should have hard coded Chinese subs... :-)
Which idiot does that... Why cant u put english subs"
,SelectaAssassin,2011-02-11T11:40Z,"Still not a complete movie. Stops abruptly, same as the others. Why doesn't anyone have the complete movie?"
,patisallano,2011-02-11T15:03Z,"I know this is free and I know it pirate and all that - but to upload incomplete movies should be punished somehow. It's the only criteria I have - that the movies are complete. It is nice with higher quality and all, but not as important as a complete storyline.

,Conxile,2011-02-18T20:09Z,"@tempid123 Because there are two major languages in China, Mandarin and Cantonesee. The symbols are very similar but the verbal part is different where a Cantonesee can barely understand Mandarin (speaking out of personal experience), that's why there is subtitle."
