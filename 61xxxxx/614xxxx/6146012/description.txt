In the film, Bea Pullman (Claudette Colbert) and her daughter Jessie (Rochelle Hudson) have had a hard time making ends meet since Bea's husband died. Help comes in the form of Delilah Johnson (Louise Beavers), who agrees to work as Bea's housekeeper in exchange for a room for herself and her daughter Peola (Fredi Washington). Bea comes up with a plan to market Delilah's pancake recipe. The two soon become wealthy and as the years go on, their friendship deepens. Their relationships with their daughters, however, become strained. Ashamed of her mother, Peola seeks a new life by passing for white. Bea's love for her daughter is tested when she and Jessie fall for the same man. 

The film was released by Universal Pictures on November 26, 1934, and later re-issued in 1936. A 1959 remake with the same title stars Lana Turner.
