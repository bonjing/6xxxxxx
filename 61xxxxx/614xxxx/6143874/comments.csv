Can not install easily my contryÂ´s keyboard without the use of a ~500MB MUI.
So i rather make my own Lite XP SP3 with nLite."

now, if burn it on a CD it will ask for a registration key again in as a physical machine?
thanx "
,mattdamn,2011-10-20T08:01Z,"Hello madblue, your version of winXP fast and lite is the ***BEST*** small operating system
that I have ever used.  It loads fast and smooth with most drivers included.  Once it is loaded,
it feels GOOOOD!  Click-Move_Click-Move_Click-Move --- Yes it is GOOD!
Why did you include 2 very distracting item?  Your ***username: and password:***
Each time that I use this wonderful prog, I have to go back and BLANK or REMOVE your password.
Please, I am begging you, make a new copy, that does NOT include a ""password"".
Thank you very much,
mattdamn"
