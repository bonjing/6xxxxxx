Howard Jones - Look Mama [promo].VOB


HQ rare promo music video. Released as the second single from Howard Jones' 1985 album Dream Into Action, "Look Mama" reached #10 in the UK Singles Chart. It was not released as a single in the US, but a different mix to those issued in the UK was included on the US-only remix album Action Replay.

The introduction to the song features some spoken dialogue sampled from the 1974 film Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.

"Look Mama" is written from the standpoint of a child pleading with its over-protective mother to be allowed greater independence and room to develop its own personality.

Howard Jones (born John Howard Jones, 23 February 1955, Southampton, Hampshire, England) is a Welsh musician. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, "Jones is an accomplished singer-songwriter who was a regular chart visitor in the mid 1980s with his brand of synthpop. Jones, who was equally popular in the U.S., appeared at Live Aid". 

Allmusic journalist, Stephen Thomas Erlewine adds, "Jones was one of the defining figures of mid 1980s synthpop. His music merged the technology intensive sound of new wave with the cheery optimism of hippies and late 1960s pop. Jones racked up a string of hits in the mid and late 1980s, before he retreated into being a cult figure in the 1990s".
