,jesterjive,2011-02-04T07:10Z,"whats the audio, 5.1 or 2 channels??"
,flextm71,2011-02-04T23:41Z,What is the audio and resolution?
,jesterjive,2011-02-07T09:38Z,pathetic 2 channel audio...n the same video quality as arrow....waste of time and bandwidth...y to rip in the 1.2gb format when you get the same quality for 700 mbs...
,watbol,2011-02-16T00:04Z,"Too bad it's ""letterboxed"" in full screen mode.
I was hoping it would fill the screen... not have a black border around the whold movie.
As for the torrent and effert...
Very Good, Nice 16:8-WideScreen movie.
Keep up the Good Werk¡!
