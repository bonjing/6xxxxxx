Great. LiG very good upload best one yet. Please redo how to train your dragon so it's more like this one please (dragon judders and mild delay between left and right screens give a nautious effect when watched). "

,rip111buddy,2011-02-05T17:37Z,"I tried many other despicable me .rar PART files 
but this one WILL work like a charm and i am sure about that !"
,rip111buddy,2011-02-05T17:38Z,can u please upload ICE AGE 3 in 3D !
,Gogul69,2011-02-06T13:28Z,"Sorry LiG did you say you already have re jigged How to train dragon? I got it about 10 days ago and it still has the problems, did you re-do since then? Appreciate all the work you have put in already though, just hoping to get a good copy of this as I cannot get the disc unless I buy more un-needed glasses!"
,LigGeorge,2011-02-06T16:05Z,"It's ready but not uploaded.Als you can't buy it anymore,because inside those glasses is a vouther to order th movie but the offer expired 3 months ago.Now samsung sends shrek forever after and soon Megamind.Anyway you can find it on ebay for 70$ at least."
,Gogul69,2011-02-06T17:15Z,Ha too true I hope the prices come down soon but refuse to pay that much on principle that I think it's a swizz. Cheers though hope you put it up soon I will assist in seeding etc
,Gogul69,2011-02-07T13:16Z,"On another note LiG, how did you encode the files so small, I want to back up my blu rays and I see some as low as 5gb files. I have a mac and windows laptop with an external bluray burner. Any tips would be great. I have dvdfab for laptop"
,mrroot,2011-02-11T16:38Z,"HELLO EVERYONE,I HAVE A QUESTION IF I CAN SEE THESE MOVIE FILES IN 3D..IN A COMPATIBLE PROJECTOR IN 3D..

             THANKS TO ALL...."
,Gogul69,2011-02-12T15:02Z,"that depends on the projector to be honest. In theory, yes but these are side to side 3d files (two pictures next to each other that are merged with the options on the persons tv). If your projector has side by side picture options then yes you should be able to. Depends on the glasses as well because tvs that use side by side are active shutter by nature but have seen sports bars using the reald technology to show football matches in 3d from sky (sky uses side by side also). You would have to do some reseach into projector tv's first to know for certain. Sorry am not much more help but projection 3d really is a new and extremely rare set up."
,Gogul69,2011-02-12T15:40Z,"Projection tv's are very difficult to understand as the tech is even newer than the tv's. it depends on what your projector can display really, can it convert side by side films into 3d? if so then yes the projector will work. if you have glasses that work with the projector it's a different story. I would suggest looking around at other sites that are able to tell you more about your projector and what it can do ultimately."
,Gogul69,2011-02-12T15:42Z,apologies for sounding like a parrot but the first post didn't show up for a half hour so felt i had to rewrite it.
,freeworkman3,2011-02-22T17:00Z,Upload alice in wonderland and piranha!!!!
,hopko682,2011-02-24T05:48Z,After looking around I have concluded that LilGeorge is the king of 3D torrents! Looking forward to whatever you load up next!
,hotys221,2011-02-26T05:15Z,Thanks for the upload!!!!! i will waiting for yor next movie in 3d!!!
,Dragoon_Jefy,2011-03-04T04:18Z,This is the first comment that I've ever left.. And the only reason I want to do so is to say this.. YOU ARE AWESOME LigGeorge.. I have followed 3D since the old days of shutter glasses and I have both the nVidia 3D Vision + Samsung LCD 3D. You are a true pioneer and (as far as I can tell) the only one fueling our needs!  Keep them coming.
,cap80001,2011-03-05T20:00Z,hi i have downloaded all of your torrents as have just bought a samsung 3d tv although not sure how to to play them correctly. iv been plugging my laptop into my tv using hdmi and playing them using vlc player although 3d isnt working properly. do you know how i can watch them? plz help thought maybe of buying an external hard drive and plugging that into the tv. do you think that will work?
,danman91,2011-04-17T22:32Z,"@powerman5000ca

when you say you need the 3D DVD player, do you mean I have to burn this file on a bluray disc first? any chance I can run this in 3d by directly connecting me laptop to the tv??"
,AtkinsD,2011-04-18T16:37Z,Awesome Side-By-Side Stereoscopic Copy! Thank You!
