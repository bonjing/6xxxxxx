"There's a crisis in the Florida Everglades as giant pythons are threatening the alligator population." -- from IMDB

This is a Syfy original movie, "MEGA PYTHON VS GATOROID" which aired on Saturday 29-Jan-2011. 

It stars Debbie Gibson and Tiffany as the main characters!! Anyone who grew up in the 80s should want to see this, as bad as I predict it will be. (I haven't even watched it yet, just skimmed it to make sure it was a good AVI.)

NOTE: I did not rip or encode this. I couldn't find a torrent for this but I was able to find a full (!!) download on one of those filesharing sites. Amazingly, it allowed me to download the whole thing for free. Just an obnoxious 10 second wait at the beginning. Here's what info I could gather from the file:

VLC said something about a bad CBR header but it plays fine.
