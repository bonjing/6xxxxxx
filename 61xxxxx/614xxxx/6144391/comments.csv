,maigaard7,2011-02-04T19:32Z,"Help. I am running this game with Winewrapper, and I can run it alright, no problem there, but when I play it both the in-game cursor and my regular cursor show up on the screen and I can move both but not at the same pace. If my regular cursor touches the side of the screen, the in-game cursor freezes and then it appears somewhere completely random when I move my regular cursor away from the screen.

It's probably just a bug but it makes the game unplayable."

,A.Lopez,2011-02-12T16:24Z,"Sometimes the game will close down because it recognizes it's open somewhere else. Remember this is a port of a windows game so it's going to have some issues of course. But there will always be a fix. 

Anyways, try opening a new finder window. Go to your applications folder. Find Fallout NewVegas and right click it. Open package contents. Double Click on wineskin. Then select the advanced tab. On the bottom of this there an option to kill all wineskin processes. Select that. After it finishes it gives you a prompt saying it's completed.

I have Fallout 3 also and it runs way better than this does. I understand that New Vegas has better graphics and whatnot, but its a little ridiculous. For the first 10 minutes of the game it runs beautifully, and I had high hopes for it. Then I left the opening tutorial area and it I couldn't move my cursor a few centimeters without having to wait for the game to catch up. If you have a super awesome computer, this may be worth it, but for us poor people with basic computers, its not."

Suggestions? "
,erinnl,2011-04-16T04:48Z,"Okay.  The reason you can't click on advanced screen is you have to make sure you are in the CORRECT Wineskin.  Go to the one you copied to your harddrive, not the one in your applications or anything
Second point?  I spoke with Wineskin tech support.  There is a FIXABLE reason this crashes as much as it does!  The person who created this used a VERY buggy beta of Wineskin.  Sadly it's so buggy that you can't update it.  (I've been trying all day) You can try to create your own wrapper, but I even had trouble with that. 
The solution?  The person who created this has to make it with the new updated version of Wineskin. 
The reason this won't happen?  'Anonymous' gave us a website if we have any support issues.  NOT to be nice.  To get us to go their site!  Evil marketing....but, eh, it's the internet.  What do you expect?  You don't get anything for free
SO go to Wineskin for your support. Don't go to the site listed on the torrent unless you want to be taken in by whoever put this up.  
Good luck!"
,Heatperu,2011-04-16T15:42Z,"HOW TO PLAY IN FULL SCREEN MODE!!!  

Open Appications folder and find Fallout New Vegas, next double click and click show package contents. Then open Wineskin. Click Set Screen Options and check the Fullscreen box. Thats it, and enjoy the Mojave in Fullscreen!!!  c:"
,RggeCwby,2011-04-18T15:46Z,"Ok, I figured out how to play this game without too much aggravation...

1. Follow the steps outlined for 2 or more cores, obviously the higher your system specs the better it will run.

2. Click on the app while holding down option/alt.  This will open wineskin without opening the game wrapper.  Change the display options from automatic to custom and set to the resolution that fits your screen.  Set graphics to low or medium.

3. Play the game!!!  Remember to save often as it does crash occasionally.  If the game is glitching up during play, simply load from the last save and it usually fixes the problem.

Thanx for the upload!  I am enjoying the game...

,UserName6,2011-09-03T19:24Z,"Okay I made an account just to comment on this torrent! Here are my specs:
Macbook Intel Core 2 Duo
Processor Speed: 2.13 GHz
Chipset Model:	NVIDIA GeForce 9400M
2 Gb of Ram
ON LEOPARD 10.5.8
Here's how to get this game to run without lagging like a motherfucker:
1. After mounting the .dmg file, drag NewVegas into your application folder.
2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6532914/Fallout.New.Vegas.Update.7-SKIDROW
and any DLC you want
3. Hold down the option key on your keyboard and click the New Vegas app. This will bring up the wineskin menu.  Click install windows software and choose the Update exe you downloaded. Once that's installed to the default location, right click the New Vegas app and click show package contents.
Then Drive C. The Program Files, Bethesda Software, Fallout New vegas. Once there, drag the other .exe files from the update you downloaded into that folder and have them write over the older filers."
,UserName6,2011-09-03T19:31Z,"Continued-
If you downloaded any DLC files, open the Data folder within the Fallout New Vegas folder you have open and drag them in there.
4.Hold the option key and open the New Vegas App.  This brings up the wineskin menu again. Click set screen options, then override, fullscreen, and choose your native resolution (mine is 1280x800).  Click done and then quit.
5.Double click the new vegas app.  This will bring up the launcher.  Click data files and make sure the DLCs you want are checked.  Now go to settings.  Click Low on graphics.  Make sure HDR and Bloom are off (click none), and turn vertical sync off if it's checked. Now click play.
6.  In the game menu click on settings, Display, and then turn the actor fade, item fade, and object fade to about the middle.
7.  Quit the game."
,UserName6,2011-09-03T19:36Z,"Continued-
8. Open finder.  Click on documents.  There should be a folder called My Games. Open it and the New Vegas folder and find the file FALLOUT.INI
Right click it and open with TextEdit.Find bUseThreadedAI=0 and change it to bUseThreadedAI=1
Press enter and Add iNumHWThreads=2 after bUseThreadedAI=1
Save the file and close it.
9. Now you're fucking done! Enjoy the game, you should buy a copy too though Obsidian is worth supporting.  OH by the way I'm pretty sure you need X11 installed which will be either already installed on your computer OR on the disk you got with the computer, just pop it in and click on optional software, install x11. Hope this has been helpful!"
,UserName6,2011-09-03T19:39Z,"Oh yeah, if you ever want to access the launcher again, hold option while opening the new vegas app, click on advanced, and change the Windows Exe to FalloutNVLauncher.exe
This file is found by hitting browse, then program files, bethesda software, New vegas"
,UserName6,2011-09-04T04:54Z,"another note: When you download the update, you want to have a program that will open .rar files.  Click on the rar file and it will make a folder.

,nickthenack99,2011-11-09T05:13Z,"What are u guys talking about!!!

NO LAG, NO CRASHES just perfect gameplay =D"

,mrrabbitlauncher,2011-11-11T23:14Z,I've tried to play this game at least 50 times and it either doesn't open or comes up with the message *the file FalloutNV.exe has encountered a serious problem and needs to close* can anyone help? 
,dagdagiron,2011-11-16T09:59Z,"I created account here to ask this one question. I hope some one answers, becouse I cannot solve this problem by myself.

My Fallout New Vegas crashed yesterday for last time. For this long it has only crashed, then I am able to start game again. Now the game does not start at all. Usually I get message *the file FalloutNV.exe has encountered a serious problem and needs to close*, and I have to restart. This time it might had something to do wineskin, that it could not open again.
When I try to click to start game, it does not do anything, and seems like it does not even open x11.
Help me."

@dagdagiron if you open your activity monitor in utilities you can 'stop process' for the various Wine processes that will still be running after the crash. This should let you start the app again."
,daredvl666,2012-03-16T20:49Z,ok im trying to start up the game and it says error launching wineserver failed no new wineserver PID found. what do i need to do??
,ringworm74,2012-03-17T12:27Z,"l've noticed that when I quit the game through the menu it will crash every time and I'll have to hit cmd-Q.
@daredvl666 try restarting your mac as this will definitely stop the wine processes that may still be running. The game should start up again, at least it does for me.
I think because this was wrapped with a beta version of wine that these issues might be here to stay. Someone would need to re-wrap and re-post I reckon."
