Game Description:
The series makes its way back to its West Coast roots in Obsidian's upcoming postapocalyptic role-playing game.

There will definitely be gambling in Fallout: New Vegas. Whether or not the other wonders of Las Vegas--like buffets--will be included remains to be seen, but for now, we were assured that once you make your way to the strip, there will be a variety of ways to give up your hard-earned cash. At the Bethesda Gamers Day held in Las Vegas, Obsidian presented an hour-long demo of its upcoming role-playing game set in the dry and desolate Mojave Wasteland. Several members of the development team came from Black Isle Studios--the creators of Fallout and Fallout 2--so the game's story and setting will likely feel more familiar to those who had played the first two games.
