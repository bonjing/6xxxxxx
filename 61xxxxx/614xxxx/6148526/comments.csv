,ninjapiratez,2011-02-24T21:35Z,"This activator works 100% with any win7, even if you installed Service Pack 1. make sure kb971033 is uninstalled and do not download it from windows update after installing this"
,Darsholn,2011-02-25T10:39Z,Tried it on a Windows 7 Ultimate x86 install. Working so far!
,chungwa,2011-02-25T16:01Z,"Arse: won't install without .net 4, which won't install at all, possibly because I'm not allowed updates without authentication? Anyway, another waste of time. "
,placemat1212121,2011-02-26T20:23Z,"THIS IS GREAT! I actually purchased Win 7 Ultimate, and Microsoft suddenly blocked my key after 5 months of using it. At least I can carry on now with this patcher! Many thanks carter67."
,nazrac,2011-03-01T19:32Z,Works (Win7 64 SP1). Thanks
,mr1black,2011-03-02T08:44Z,"Agree. Afther installing SP1, my RemoveWAT didn't work. I followed all the steps for installation, downloaded/installed .net framework, and everithyng works fine. Tried Win Update - works"
,_rawrohhnine_,2011-03-06T22:12Z,"downloaded and intalled.. next morning my pc couldnt start up.. yeah greaaat torrent man.. plus picked up as ""harmful software"" by avg"
,MulliganM,2011-03-08T04:06Z,"Did avg pick it self up as virus?? Cause it is... AVG sucks sorry.. It just doesn't use 50% of your ram at random moments it find every crack/keygen as a virus, cause they won't you to think they are doing something. Anyways your computer wouldn't start cause of something else.

I ran this on 4 different computer and it works well even after downloading win7 Sp1 Thanks!"
,dr.applepie,2011-03-10T17:50Z,"does not work with sp1.... or atleast didnt work for me, using x64 ultimate..."

Defitnition of trojan-

A Trojan horse, or Trojan, is software that appears to perform a desirable function for the user prior to run or install, but (perhaps in addition to the expected function) steals information or harms the system.[1] The term is derived from the Trojan Horse story in Greek mythology.

,slartie60,2011-03-18T14:02Z,"Here you can see the listing of virus total: just AntiVir and Symantec disclaim this crack as unclean. There's no trojan or any other malicious code inside. For any Antivirus-Programs it is just a potential unwanted program.

,Shadow Master,2011-03-20T23:07Z,Worked great on Windows 7 Ultimate x64.
,theeenik,2011-03-21T10:55Z,"it is da best windows 7 activator 
i have used tons of but this works like charm
u must use it"
,Psybercastor,2011-03-26T10:21Z,"This worked fine for several weeks, but now I get:
""A change occured to the Windows License file
You must re-type your windows product key to activate online.""
When I write the product key found in HAL7600 the it says that it's the Windows default product key, and that I need a different key. What should I do?"
,slartie60,2011-03-27T19:55Z,"@Psybercastor

Have you deinstalled and blinded up KB971033? After this, SP1 (KB976932) will offered again for installation. If you have already installed SP1, blind up KB976932 too.

Activate again with HAL7600_1.2 and follow strictly the instructions!"
,MajestyZ,2011-03-31T20:31Z,"Thanks a lot for this dude. Does it work kinda like RemoveWAT? 'Cause I don't like those KMS activators running at start up and stuff..

Works perfectly on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, with all the new updates installed (SP1 included).

Thanks again mate."
,Tyrranosaurus_Rex,2011-06-19T18:20Z,"I tried everything to activate Win 7 Ultimate X86 7600.. nothing worked. did a lot of reinstalls... 

But this worked like a charm.. the BEST.. Awesome Carter.. Just AWESOME"
,Tyrranosaurus_Rex,2011-06-19T23:10Z,"by the way, i had to install the .net framework... but it was worth it considering the number of activators i downloaded with no positive results.. will keep you posted as to what happens as i update windows"
,Adkturn,2011-10-14T02:00Z,"Removed KB971033, ran HAL7600 and it worked like a dream on Win 7 Home Prem 64-bit fine for a few weeks. Then installed SP1 and after a month got the black background on desktop and ""This copy of Windows is not Genuine"" watermark. How do you blind up KB976932?  "
,Adkturn,2011-10-16T13:42Z,Recovered from 'this copy of windows is not genuine' black watermark. Hal7600 great tool.
