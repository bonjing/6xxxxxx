About:

With the new year comes a new release from the team that brought you Chew-WGA and Chew7, now partnering with secr9tos and Fibonacci from The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (known for their development of R2 Converter). We present a new era of activation technology in our release of HAL7600, affectionately named after the HAL 9000 sentient on-board computer of the Discovery One spacecraft in Arthur C. Clarke's fictional Space Odyssey saga.

Main Features:

   * Provides an alternative way to activate Windows offline and privately.
   * Works on most builds or Windows (7, N, Server, Enterprise), including SP1.
   * Works on 32bit or 64bit system architectures.
   * Turns on activated and genuine status: LicenseStatus = 1; GenuineStatus = 0.
   * Validates with WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) online.
   * Resets the rearm count and then freezes the evaluation countdown (grace period time remaining).
   * After the initial installation reboot, no further reboots are required to keep it activated.
   * A simple click installs or uninstalls the program. It couldn't be any easier.


Included Tools:

   * Patched status checker, so you can see at any time if the system is still patched correctly. NEW!
   * Advanced patch cloaking, to hide any system mods from SFC and other resource digest checkers.
   * Disable (or re-enable) Windows Defender or Microsoft Security Essentials.
   * Change Windows Update settings easily.
   * Query the WMI database for product name and key, license and genuine status, etc. with ease.
   * Check for pending system file repair / update jobs, and clear them from the queue.
   * Initial Configuration Tasks / Server Manager activation status patch for Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Home Server 2011 (code named "Vail").
   * Windows Embedded Standard patch to remove evaluation text from logo.

Installation Tips:

   * Disable all anti-malware programs (anti-virus, anti-spyware, etc.) before installation, and exclude any resource blips that these tools warn you about. There are no viruses or malicioius code of any kind in HAL7600. Additionally, it was created by credible developers: Fibonacci, anemeros, and secr9tos.
   * Make sure your system clock is correct. Run "timedate.cpl", click the "Internet Time" tab, click the "Change Settings" button, select the server appropriate for you, then click the "Update Now" button. If it fails, try again and switch servers if necessary.
   * Ensure that all other activators are uninstalled, including Chew-WGA, Chew7, IR4, RemoveWAT, Daz's Loader, and any other loaders or BIOS mods. After uninstalling potentially conflicting software, also run "SFC /scannow" in an elevated command prompt, let it finish scanning, and then restart the computer before installing HAL7600.
   * Run "services.msc" to open the Microsoft Management Console services snap-in. Then verify that the startup type for "Software Protection" is set to "Automatic (Delayed Start)", and then verify that the startup type for "SPP Notification Service" is set to "Manual".
   * Uninstall KB971033 unless you need it, or rename WatAdminSvc.exe until you want to use it for something (can't imagine why anyone would need WAT in the first place, but hey).
