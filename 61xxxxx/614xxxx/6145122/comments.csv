,NSRacer,2011-02-02T13:45Z,"is there anyway you can find a working version of the airsimmer a320? i don't have any new fsdreamteam sceneries, only the ones from this website"
,gotbutchi,2011-02-02T14:08Z,"As far as I've searched,it is quite ""hard"" to crack the AirSimmer A320 as it uses new kind of validate checking.

Besides,the a/c has lots of bugs. At the moment I recommend wilco-sms/overland merge or wilco-projectairbus"
