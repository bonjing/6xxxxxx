I double-clicked the newly mounted disc in the ""Computer"" folder and a blue rotating disc appeared next to the cursor. It spun a few turns and then disappeared, nothing more happened. I browsed the disc and found out that the auto launcher launches the file ""launcher\LAUNCHER.exe"". So I set the compat mode for the file to XP Sp 2 and tried to run it again with the same result. 

Is it a dead race, or is there anything else I can do? I really like this game and want to be able to play this on my Win 7(64bit) HP ProBook.

In other. The download was quick and painless. And I'm really glad you've uploaded this marvelous game. If only I could get it to run!"

In this case, I'd try another mounting program, like Power-ISO or so. Maybe you can try installing with the .exe in the language folder of your choice? Good luck and have fun!"
