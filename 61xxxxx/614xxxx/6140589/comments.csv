,risingfire1,2011-02-01T15:22Z,"Worked like a charm, just follow the instructions and read em in full, if you have problems look over them, because theres a 99% chance you did something wrong or stopped halfway through the process. Thanks to the poster for an awesome torrent."

,krokieman,2011-02-11T10:23Z,"Quick question...  The program works, but once I tried to add more than one game to the ""game box"" it keeps telling me I have to re-register, but the program is still saying it's the premium version.  Is there a way to fix this or get around it?  It's not a huge deal to not have them there, but I like them there."
,fefemcq,2011-02-13T06:40Z,"im having the same problem that ""krokieman"" have can only add one game at a time.. if i try to add more it says i need to upgrade..

,ninja3546,2011-03-15T22:19Z,i got it installed and everything but when i go to put the key in it says it cannot connect to there servers..shuld i unblock it from my firewall or something?
,AcidGlow,2011-03-16T11:32Z,"Btw for those that have problems adding more than 1 game shortcut to the ""gamebox"" instead of using the Add another game"" button simply create shortcut on your desktop (or wherever), point to the ""gamebox"" so that the selection window pops up, and then simply drag the game shortcut onto the selection window. Should be able to add as many shortcuts as you like that way."
,studentagain,2011-03-21T04:30Z,"i installed it perfectly, thanks carter67!

but the gamebox that appears on the lower right of the screen isnt showing up, i tried changing it in the options (unchecking ""hidebox"", ""transparency"", etc) 

i tired restarting but still it doesnt show up with the shortcuts to games"
,rnguyen13,2011-03-23T04:27Z,"Works fine except, when I try to patch it, after it's done, I open Gamebooster and it says the file is corrupted. I followed the instructions : Run everything as admin, block app from firewall etc. But it says file is corrupted and I have to re-install it. Anybody got a solution to this? (BTW I'm running Windows 7 32-bit)"
,nourddine84,2011-04-16T15:01Z,"how to block the application on windows 7
i cant find game booster on firewall"
,HardcoreAndMore,2011-05-19T19:47Z,"I am very sceptical about this. But i do think this does improve. i havent tested it our on LoL(League of Legends) because i am in a queue now.
But as i saw the steps i had to take befor it launches the game, it should actually work. It cleares RAM, it enables power mode, and you can Defrag your games.

For the windows 7 users that cant block it on Firewall:

PUT OUT YOUR INTERNET CABLE AND THEN INSTALL EVERYTHING

Ir will say 'Unable to connect to server' if you put in the serial. But after a restart(of the program) it worked."
,HardcoreAndMore,2011-05-19T19:48Z,"Oh, and thanks Carter67! :)"
,Angut2006,2011-05-20T12:11Z,"Nice TROJAN in the patcher! Be careful.
