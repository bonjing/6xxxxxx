,mig092,2011-02-02T01:34Z,is there any difference between this one and the Fairlight crackfix?
,GLMC,2011-02-02T03:54Z,i cracked this one and it can go through the whole game no matter what language or multi version
,Toxina,2011-02-02T12:56Z,the FL crack crashes at chapter 7 corridor after you destroy mainframe
,mig092,2011-02-02T17:43Z,"fairlight had already released a crackfix for the chapter 7 bug. they did it the next day to the first release and as far as I know the whole game is playable with it, also in every language too. I just want to know if there are any significant differences between this one and fairlight's..."
,mig092,2011-02-02T18:04Z,"mmmmmm, your ""crack"" has the exact same file size as fairlights crackfix...."
,techgeek25,2011-02-03T07:26Z,crack crashes at Chapter 12. after you hook up the driller and 2-3 minutes after it starts drilling into the cave. i tried FLT and all the cracks. i played the same level 4 times. none of the cracks works... including this.
,somedude.1001,2011-02-03T12:08Z,"This seems difficult to crack perfectly. SKIDROW, RELOADED, all the good cracking groups havent released anything for it."
,GLMC,2011-02-04T01:49Z,Ill try and get a good one hang on!
,p2pPirate,2011-02-05T13:42Z,"Are you sure you cracked this game not just renamed someones crack?

,cheatoman,2011-02-05T16:00Z,"how do you get this to work... I extracted the rar and got an exe file. when i run it, i get a black screen and nothing happens :D"
,WierdDuDe16,2011-02-05T18:48Z,let's hope this crack works bcause i was a Chapter 7 and i couldn't enter the Zero-G room for the Solar panels
