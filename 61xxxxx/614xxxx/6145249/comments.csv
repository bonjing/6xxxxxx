,Thor-csf,2011-06-23T16:40Z,"The audio is no stereo, it's mono! WTF?!"
,Thor-csf,2011-07-17T05:25Z,"Furthermore: why did you attach subtitles to the movies if you included .srt subs?? It makes no sense!
My HDTV's media player can't stand movies with attached subs; only with external ones, like .srt. :("
