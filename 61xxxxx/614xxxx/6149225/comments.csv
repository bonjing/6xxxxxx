so i say a fake again "
,hello40204,2011-02-04T13:30Z,"but looking at other uploaders more than one , i retract what i said and say there is a good chance this is the real stuff, sorry for the confusion ."
,some-young-guy,2011-02-04T14:35Z,"I'd have to concur with your latter posting as Scenebalance, TV Team, Raymondhome, Safcuk, .BONE, neonrainbow, and quite a few others are always posting quality torrents every day for us.  I even think TV Team and scenebalance are controled by the same person as they usually upload in unison.

All the uploaders I named above I consider to be trusted uploaders even though they only brandish the green skull now."
