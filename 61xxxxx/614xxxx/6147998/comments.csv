,Puerto28,2011-02-12T01:43Z,Will this play through windows media player?
,tristanguy,2011-02-14T00:52Z,The last time I saw a HD Blu ray was 20 GB...
,aafz02,2011-02-17T13:24Z,"@Puerto28...  no it won't it is possibly the most UNusable format for streaming, watching on a computer, etc...   *fact*"
,aafz02,2011-02-17T13:25Z,"""this format .. the most all-round usable format""

Sorry but that is nonsense; AVI, MPeG, or any one of many other formats are more widely compatible than Sony's PS3 and MKV (or AVI) would be better for HD.. This format will not play on older DVD players no matter how you burn it UNLESS it's converted to another format. "
[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-18T00:56Z,"aafz02 - you have just proved that you know nothing about... anything, in one paragraph. That takes some doing - congratulations."
[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-18T00:58Z,"Puerto28- mount the image on a virtual drive, browse to the BDMV/STREAM folder, and play or stream the 00000.m2ts video file. Simple as..."
,benbon88,2011-02-19T08:40Z,TS why my media player cannot load the subs? n i cant find the pgs subs..help me please..i mount the image using power iso
,aafz02,2011-02-19T12:56Z,"@HD-R-US interesting response, my apologies I didn't mean to insult you but this format is not at all ""the most all-round usable format"".

I did make one mistake in my other reply about AVI supporting HD however, if AVCHD is so widely ""usable"" how come every brand of new LCD/Plasma TV supports MKV while the same is not true of AVCHD? "
,aafz02,2011-02-19T12:58Z,"cont.. Also, in your own words you state.. ""Please note that regular DVD players ... will NOT play this movie without re-encoding it.""

What percentage of people, globally, do you think own SD players versus HD? So you believe the wider audience want to sit and watch a HD blockbuster on a 20"" PC screen with media player and not on their 40"" HD LCD?  ok.. have it your way..  lol!"

[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-19T18:08Z,"aafz02 - the word you are missing in all of this is ""all-round"". Does an MKV or AVI container have the file structure to be burnt to a playable disc? An AVCHD formatted movie CAN be watched on a computer, or a stand-alone HD-DVD or blu-ray player, and wtf are you talking about LCD televisions being MKV compatible or SD players?

Every word you type displays a person that knows-it-all, but in reality knows nothing, so if you know so much, it would be nice to see you contributing to the community, and actually uploading something, rather than trolling TPB making yourself look a fool."
,aafz02,2011-02-20T18:34Z,"@HD-R-US - I am not trolling nor am I suggesting I know-it-all. On the contrary I am, if anything, wondering why you would do so much to help the PB community while at the same time reducing the numbers of those that would benefit from your efforts. And while I admit I do not upload torrents I do my part by seeding at 1Gb u/l speed well beyond my d/ls."
,aafz02,2011-02-20T18:36Z,"@HD-R-US It seems that the quality of your uploads is unquestionably good, and yet others here are getting bigger hits? One in particular is at circa +4000 seeders as I type this. "
,aafz02,2011-02-20T18:36Z,"@HD-R-US If AVCHD is the most all round format, how come I can't watch it unless I buy a.) A HD DVD player, b.) a Sony game console or c.) some additional software for my PC? It won't play on my SD DVD, or my brand new Samsung 40"" TV (w all latest codecs updated) or my PC with latest codecs installed."
,aafz02,2011-02-20T18:42Z,"Apologies for the split posts and if any if anyone can answer..  Why can't I post comments more than a couple of lines? I have to split them into sections or they just won't post. I've seen other posts on PB like a Women's Only problem page get through. I've tried Firefox and Chrome, same problem. "
[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-20T21:29Z,"aafz02 - it isn't a numbers game to us, nor are we trying to copy or out-do what anyone else is doing. It doesn't mean that some of our releases aren't as popular as other people's, or even moreso in some cases. Our release of Grown Ups for example - with almost 100,000 downloads to date has been more popular than any other release over 1.1Gb on any torrent site. 14 of our releases were in the top 100 Hi-Res Movies here at one point - We have our audience, and that is fine.

The amount of seeds/peers for a movie has many determining factors - how quickly it was uploaded after it's initial release is the main one, and because 720p TV's are still widely used in the US, 720p downloads will usually hold their own against the same movie in 1080p."
,kennard1986,2011-02-24T15:55Z,"VLC player every time, it plays pretty much anything and even repairs broken files.

works for me :)"
,Triketra,2011-02-25T12:19Z,"@HD-R-US you just seem pompous to me, I WILL not DL ANYTHING from you. Grow the fuck up, what you Up/L is on you, but you seem to not be able to take crit very well even though you say ""it's not a numbers game to us"". Grow the fuck up, you lost a D/L by your immaturity and any sort of donation if you had wanted one, I would rather D/L a Toilet after readind all the posts rather than something from you. AND YES I haven't uploaded anything yet, but it would surely be better than any crap than you could with a M17x2. Instead of flaming or posting bs take your crit, otherwise FUCK off and get off PB "
[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-25T16:25Z,lol - and that's my loss? ~rolls eyes~
[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-25T16:40Z,"Triketra - people like you do make me laugh, telling others to grow up, when it's you that's ranting and swearing like a child. Criticism is welcome when it's constructive and refers to a torrent's quality - people waving their ill-informed opinions around for the sake of it isn't."
,lvnitup,2011-03-05T12:32Z,"hi i need help, i'm a bit new to this, i downloaded the the torent and tried burning it with ImgBurn but their is no BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders (as per instructions), only a ISO file? so add the ISO file instead but the disk shows nothing on the disc after the burn but is no longer a blank disc. i've also tried mounting it on MagicISO and it says ""Windows cannot read from this disk. The disk might be corrupted, or it could be using a format that is not compatible with Windows.""
any tip from anyone as it is doing my head in!"
,EGOKHAN,2011-03-06T02:54Z,"Hey,can i play this on BS.PLAYER without doing all this confusing stuff(burn,extract e.t.c)?"

is there anyone same as me?"
,Kakarot69,2011-03-12T11:04Z,dont even let these idiots get to u HD your rips are some of the best ones i've gotten here that fact you put all yours in iso i love it it makes burning them out 1000times easier keep up the good work if u take donations let me know 
,ashumaloz,2011-03-13T03:31Z,"For Ubuntu users, use this to mount the image.
sudo mount -o loop -t udf path/to/bluray.iso /media/cdrom
Where media/cdrom is an arbitrary folder.  You can then copy and paste the m2ts file somewhere so that you don't need to mount anymore.  The m2ts plays perfectly with VLC."
,ra1961,2011-03-22T18:30Z,"I used Power ISO (Downloaded from Pirate Bay) and then played the M2ts file with VLC player...works great! Thanks!

Your work is very good but I wished your choices of movies was a little better, anyway thanks and keep up the good work!"
,ElementBling90,2011-04-10T05:04Z,"HD, how's it going holmes? Soo.. I'm not real savvy with this whole File Type lingo, all I wanna know is will this play through a PS3 with ordinary sound? Any info would be helpful. Peace"
,Rossalli,2011-04-17T00:21Z,"Can you upload Avatar, please? Thank you!"
,soccermaniacguy,2011-04-17T08:58Z,"@HD-R-US LMAO!!! Don't listen to these complaining noobs. Kids need to grow up and be thankful for what they get. I mean are you serious? First of all it's free. Secondly if you don't like this one, go find another Iron Man 2 1080p torrent. Thirdly, if you have a computer that can handle HD videos, you don't deserve it if you don't know how to even play them."
,dani969,2011-05-04T17:50Z,"I just burned this on to a DVD5 by following the instructions given and tried to play it on my Xbox 360 Slim but it did not work!
Either I did some thing wrong or its just that the X360 slim doesn't support HD DVD!
Some body please help me because i want to play it on my xbox! "

,pmfabri,2011-06-23T23:15Z,"stop fuking uploading movies as isos. nobody wants to see this shit. there is no way to stream this shit, and it can't even be extracted because u fuked with it."
,holyheck,2011-06-24T14:04Z,"Mounted the image with Daemon Tools virtual drive (could have extracted it this way too) and streamed the movie to my PS3 with Media Server. Then burnt the image to a DVD to archive it.

Perfect format and absolutely superb quality.
A:10
V:10

@pmfabri  ...Actually what nobody wants to see is some ignorant numpty like yourself that has no clue about anything being able to post comments."
,abajaj2280,2011-07-17T08:36Z,"first, i would like to thank you for the torrents, you've just gained a new follower.

second, i wanted to know what program you suggest i play the movie with. i played it with VLC on my computer perfectly fine, and i have the K-Lite codec. when trying to load the subtitles, i can't load it correctly. sometimes, the progress slider skips through the entire movie and ends. also, another english option shows the subtitle for a fraction of the second, and then it disappears. i also tried finding subtitles online and loading it into VLC, but that didn't work either.

is there a solution to this? thanks in advance!"
,RE91,2011-07-18T00:55Z,"Watched it with BS Player and it was just fine.
Movie is Found in Stream folder and for some reason i couldn't get subtitles working in hope for translating russian and other possible languages spoken in the movie.

Video 10/10
Audio 10/10
Movie 8/10

Movie was good, but it wasn't as good as the first one in my opinion. Nothing new in this.

Thank you for seeding! :)"
,alikalv,2011-08-01T19:45Z,"fucked up quality bull shit 1080p

guys try another torrent "
,magnus_lo,2011-08-25T20:56Z,"@HD-R-US

Neither of the three subtitles work on VLC, it was the same thing with your release of Godfather II. Any ideas?"
,vortextk,2011-08-26T21:54Z,Yup no ability to play subtitles on regular pc media players. Kind of worthless for me that way.
,holyheck,2011-08-27T08:36Z,"Why do you noobs bother with VLC media player when you have already pointed out one of it's limitations and there are plenty of others?

KMPlayer: right click screen, left click Subtitles/Load Subtitle, browse to the .srt subtitle and you're done."
,magnus_lo,2011-08-30T21:30Z,Because I've never had problems with subtitles until now. I am a noob though so I will try your suggestion.
,magnus_lo,2011-08-30T21:34Z,"Also, I can't find any subtitle file."
,EntropyKC,2011-09-03T20:34Z,"@ aafz02 and Triketra
If this torrent is so bad and unusable, why not go and download the other 1080p versions of this film? Please just stop commenting on torrents if you are just going to nit-pick about why people SHOULDN'T download it.

If the film quality is bad or the audio isn't synced then sure, say so, but don't complain about the file type or how ""pompous"" the ULer is...

@ HD-R-US
Thank you for uploading this"
,EntropyKC,2011-09-10T21:19Z,"The quality is fine and the download was quite quick (even with only a few seeds), however I can't get the subtitles to work. I've tried the Shark007 and K-Lite codecs and have renamed the .srt file to the same as the movie (ie ""Iron Man 2.srt"" and ""Iron Man 2.m2ts"") but it still doesn't work.

Any ideas?"
,CASERIA,2011-11-28T08:47Z,Thanks awesome quality...please make transformers dark of the moon
