,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:07Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramps is FANTASTIC ripping software!"

,ionlydownloadlegalshit,2011-10-15T04:36Z,"Ummm HiroPro2.... chill the fuck out. Look at this track in like SoundBooth or Bias Peak or something... It's the most overproduced, oversampled, end-to-end VU ear-bleeding inducing piece of shit. Who the fuck cares what it was encoded at.. it left the studio distorted as hell..."

,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-04-07T00:04Z,"It's depressing to know that while all the ""sheeple"" are listening to this horsesh*t, bands/musicians with actual talent are forced to perform on train stations and in the back corners of pubs..."
,Wuzzard,2012-04-25T23:49Z,"I love all the people jumping on the bandwagon yelling ""sheeple"" at people downloading this, when they're clearly just trying to fit in with the crowd. 

Has it ever occurred to you that some of us ""sheeple"" might have a degree in classical brass performance, or sound engineering? 

Don't assume so much, some people are just more capable of being open to new ideas than others. "
,D3C3PT3C0N,2012-05-05T23:18Z,"Actually music is meant for experimenting, expressing your points of view, letting the world know about your emotions, or all of them together. LMFAO does none of that. Public Enemy, and Gang Starr express their points of view. Tiesto, Datsik, 12th Planet, and Skrillex experiment with new sounds and effects. Korn shows extreme emotion in their music and let the whole world listen to Jonathan Davis's emotions. Nine Inch Nails and TV on the Radio express all three. LMFAO does not. Don't even tell me they experiment because their sound is sketchy. I'd rather listen to Christian music than listen to LMFAO. There is always good music in every Genre but LMFAO is a joke. And it's pretty sad that despite Wuzzard's degree in music, he/she does not know how to define good music. Artists like LMFAO, Drake, Lil' Wayne, etc. are slaughtering music and changing into something unbearable. The world needs to stop ""following the leader"" and needs to start being original because our originality is what defines us."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-05-25T22:52Z,"@Wuzzard

I love how most of the people on here sharing their opinions haven't uploaded a single f**king torrent. Uploading music/movies/whatever should be a REQUIREMENT of having membership on TPB."
