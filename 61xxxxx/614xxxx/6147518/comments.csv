,teamball,2011-02-09T12:50Z,"This is not good, it looks like i've knoobed it up. This is my first up since the demise of mininova.

I saved the folder to my desktop.
Created a torrent via utorrent, saved it to my desktop. Then came here to piratebay and up'd it. Its showing up in my utorrent as a download - Why? Any help here would be appreiceted to kick this one off....
Sorry for the wait leechers...I'll seed as soon as someone can help me sort it."

,teamball,2011-02-19T06:27Z,"Thanks for the effort and help in getting this torrent of the ground DJB73, leechers everywhere salute you."
,memeshare,2011-04-12T10:59Z,"Hi Teamball,
thanks for this motherlode of awesomeness!

I want to give a copy of this to a friend as a little gift, so I was just wondering...

When you say:
""inferior songs have been trashed and replaced"", does that mean there are any songs missing that were on the original lists?

Have you just replaced the actual audio with versions with higher sound quality, or have the actual creative works been replaced by songs you think are better artistically?

...I just don't want to tell my friend ""this contains all of them"" if some are missing! 

(Great work either way tho! Sharing, sharing....)
"

,winksie,2011-05-17T14:25Z,"Hey mate I will be leaving this one to seed indefinately especially for all the Aussie fans of the J's. 

Wicked torrent well done!"
,rainbowprof,2011-09-26T13:39Z,"great torrent. Good effort, teamball. I've uploaded 2 Tb of this torrent so far to almost 200 people- but it looks like piratebay isn't tracking it anymore as its not listed as a working tracker in utorrent. What gives?
Anyway, enjoy this jjj at its best. Listen to the JJJ Like a version set too. Well worth it!"
,dogshark,2011-11-28T21:53Z,"Wow! I was thinking 10 gb was big for 30 odd cd rips..... 

Almost every song ever to grace the Hottest 100!!! HOT S#!T

I have been thinking about putting something like this together for a while, Thank you very much for beating me to the punch. This one will not be removed from my torrent client. Ever."
,dogshark,2011-11-30T00:00Z,"This is a massive mess! All in one big folder. Not even divided into years!Titles are all messed up, with artist name as well as song name and no hottest 100 ranking!!! 

Most of the bit rates are under 200kbps, so little better than a radio rip...

This is going to take ages to fix. 

What a disappointment!

I think I will recompile rather than edit every track.

I can't even use this for a party mix...."
,matty1010101,2012-03-27T11:31Z,"mebbe you could organise it into a more effective folder and naming system and re-up it like a good contributing member of pirate society rather than yelling at poor old TeamBall for this lovely upload 
but thanks for the heads up"
,matty1010101,2012-03-29T16:40Z,"the id3 tag info has correct track numbers, and hottest 100 year in album column so it takes about 20 seconds to sort it however you want it ya drongo"
,missblithe,2012-04-29T11:24Z,"teamball, you bloody legend. thank you so much for putting this together!"
,Zoophiliana,2012-04-30T22:45Z,"hey just having a bit of a problem with this torrent: I download it to 100%, it renders, then it goes back to 87% again and it takes aaages for it to be downloaded! What's up with that?"
