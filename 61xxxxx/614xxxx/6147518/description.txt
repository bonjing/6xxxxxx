Triple J's Hottest 100 - 1993-2010


Every year since 1993 Triple J has tallyed the fans votes and announced the hottest 100 songs of the year on Australia Day. This torrent started as a collation of other downloads but evolved into a labour of love with all songs painstakingly renamed. Many gaps have been filled, inferior songs have been trashed and replaced with as high quality as possible. All yours to enjoy, if you want it now and apprieciate it once its downloaded then show it by seeding for as long as you can - Cheers -
