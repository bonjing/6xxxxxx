FunkMoguls reign and rule from Brno, Czech Republic. Through their production and teamwork, they're helping to bring that Nu Funk sound to Central Europe. When experiencing them live, they bring a level of excitement and energy second to none. Deeply rooted in hip hop, they never forget where they came from. You'll always find elements of scratching, DJing, MCing and phat beats. As well as focusing on making club bootlegs and mash-ups, the FunkMogus are working hard on their own material that is soon to come.
