*****GAMEPLAY*****
Dead Space 2 is a survival horror third-person shooter. The player controls Isaac Clarke from a third-person point of view, looking over the character's right shoulder. The game features no HUD elements, relying on holograms projected from the player character and his weapons to show information such as messages and ammunition count, respectively. Player health and stasis is shown by a visual indicators located on Isaac's back. Isaac must fight an alien organism that infects and takes control of human corpses, turning them into "Necromorphs", mutating their bodies. Necromorphs must be dismembered as the alien organism controls host bodies via tentacles extending into their limbs. Other, larger types of Necromorphs that cannot be dismembered will often have yellow, glowing pustules, indicating weak spots. Occasionally, when an enemy gets close enough to Isaac, they will grab a hold of him, and the player must repeatedly press a key to fend off the enemy, with failure to do so leading to death of the player character.

The player acquires two modules; a "stasis" module, allowing the player to slow down enemies or objects, allowing for otherwise insurmountable moving obstacles such as active heavy machinery to be slowed down, allowing Isaac to safely pass, and the "kinesis" module, which allows Isaac to manipulate objects, machinery, and panels obscuring important circuitry, which Isaac can then tamper with in order to open doors and gain access to otherwise restricted areas.

The player may upgrade their weapons and armor at work benches, using nodes found throughout the game. In-game stores may be accessed where the player may buy and sell various items and attain new weapons and suits.

The player encounters zero-G environments, where Isaac is capable of maneuvering with thrusters attached to his suit.

Dead Space 2 offers five difficulty levels; Casual, Normal, Survivalist, Zealot and Hardcore. Hardcore mode is unlocked once the game has been completed. Hardcore mode can only be played from a fresh start and the player is limited to three saves in the entire game, with ammunition, health, supplies and credits being very difficult to find, and enemies are very challenging. There are no checkpoints in this mode.

*****PLOT*****
The game begins in a hospital on the Sprawl, a densely populated metropolis built on a shard of Titan, one of Saturnâ€™s moons.[11][12] Isaac Clarke has no memory of the last three years, having just been released by Franco, the protagonist of Dead Space Ignition. However, before he can remove the straitjacket, Franco is killed and transformed into a necromorph, leaving Isaac to escape on his own. He is later contacted by a woman named Daina, who guides him to her location. He is also contacted by another patient, Nolan Stross, claiming he and Isaac can destroy the Marker. Ignoring Stross, Isaac fights his way across the city, making his way to Daina. Upon his arrival, two guards seize Isaac as Daina reveals that she is a Unitologist sent to â€œrecoverâ€ Isaac, claiming that he is responsible for building the Marker that is causing the current infestation and that they need him to build more. As they are about to leave, Titan Security officers gun down Daina and her associates, allowing Isaac to escape.

Stross contacts Isaac again and he reluctantly decides to trust Stross, as his only mission now is to destroy the Marker. Stross tells Isaac that the Marker is located in the Government Sector under lockdown. As he makes his way there, Isaac comes across another survivor, Ellie Langford, a CEC officer who eventually joins their mission, deciding that she needs their help to survive. As they progress through the Sprawl, the stationâ€™s administrator, Hans Tiedemann, throws several obstacles in their way to stop them from getting to the Marker. Later, Strossâ€™ dementia gets the better of him and he attacks Ellie, gouging out one of her eyes. She survives, and later Isaac is forced to kill Stross in self-defense. As Isaac fights his way to the Marker, his visions of Nicole become more vivid as she tries to deter him from his task. Eventually he comes to accept that he cannot run away anymore, and that his destiny is to sacrifice his life to stop the Marker, causing the Nicole visions to become friendly.

Upon reaching the Government sector, Isaac sends Ellie away alone on a gunship. Once inside, he releases the doors holding back the necromorphs trying to get to the Marker, who overwhelm Tiedemannâ€™s men. Issac eventually comes upon the Marker, which is surrounded by necromorphs. As Isaac looks on, the Marker begins Convergence, an event foretold by the Unitologists. With the vision of Nicole guiding him, he comes upon a machine that unlocks the blocked Marker-infected parts of his mind, which Nicole claims will help him. He then fights his way to the Marker, where he encounters Tiedemann. Tiedemann wounds Isaac but he fights back, turning Tiedemannâ€™s gun on him, and killing him. Isaac then approaches the Marker when the Nicole vision suddenly pulls Isaac into his own mind. There, Isaac encounters the parts affected by the Marker and the Nicole vision, who then reveals that the only way to make the Marker "whole" is to absorb the body and mind of the one who created it. After a lengthy battle, Isaac is able to destroy the Nicole vision and rid all traces of the Marker's influence from his mind, destroying the Marker in the process.

Upon exiting his mind, Isaac slumps to the ground, ready to accept his fate as the Marker is destroyed. Suddenly, Isaac receives a call from Ellie, who crashes the gunship through the ceiling. As the Sprawl is being destroyed, Isaac makes his way onto the gunship and they escape.

After the credits, an audio transmission is heard between two people, an unknown subordinate and his ranking superior (known only as "the Overseer" from one of the text logs that can be collected during the course of the game). The subordinate relays that Titan Station (which was Marker Site 12) and the Marker has been destroyed. The Overseer replies that the other sites will then have to â€œpick up the piecesâ€.
