,zipadedoda,2011-02-06T18:42Z,"Installed fine. However, game is in Russian once installed. How do I change to English? Do I have to reinstall? Thanks."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-06T19:27Z,"@zipadedoda READ THE INSTALLATION.txt, and yes you have to reinstall. a readme is included for a reason, it's there for people to read. if you'd have read and followed it, the game would be fully in english.

i'll post it here too, there is 1 screen on the installation that is in a different language (russian), on the screen there are 2 options to mark, 1 is already mark which is the top option (russian), the bottom option is english. mark the bottom and BAM, you got english.

but bro, for future reference be sure to read the files included in the torrents

TO ANYONE ELSE, if you like to cheat or need a trainer to get through the game, they do work on this version, just snag any english trainer, i have tested all the ones out that i could find, including the one up here on tpb as a torrent, they all worked."
,zipadedoda,2011-02-06T19:52Z,Thanks FuCtUpPuNk.

Also when i installed it would not start giving me an error about missing file dxd9 or something like that.  I just went into download file and installed direct x file and it starts up fine.  no need to reinstall game like windows said.  Just in case anyone else has the same problem. "
,samsamson,2011-02-07T05:56Z,"I got it working in english like this: first install in russia then run the game go back to windows re-install the game in english, then it should work fine, in my case there wasn´t any strange language when I strated installing there was just reading install in english or russia, but as the guys have sed allready you have to first do it in russia it just takes wery long time to unpack the files but it´s worth it"

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-07T22:42Z,"@wisdom90 everything works, including audio and videos. no missing voices, not downgraded videos. everything is there and all errors fixed besides personal pc errors that some people may get or not, but they'd get those even if they bought the game cuz it has to do with their pc.

@cursed_worm if you really are getting that problem, then im pretty sure you're the only one. but i highly doubt you are getting any such error

@waistcoat no i dont think you can play it online, maybe lan but im still not fully sure of that too."

,thecurve92,2011-02-08T07:07Z,Ok guys I'm still really new to this and I'm having a problem. I have the game itself installed and all. I extracted the crack and replaced the one already in the program file. I try to start the game up and i'm getting a system error saying that the program can't start because d3dx9_43.dll is missing from my computer. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm seeding!!

I never saw a thing. Please do respond"

I'm halfway thru playing the game-no crashes-works beautiful, thanks again. Besides the various txt files there is a game folder, click twice on it, the crack is in a 7zip file, open it with 7z app. Click twice on the setup file and install game, copy crack to where you installed game and overwrite the existing exe file. Follow the info and it will work. If you don't follow the instructions you may be playing in Russian language. "
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-12T07:28Z,@devueh you prolly have a really shitty anti virus or you are lying. case 1: you have a shitty anti virus that is far to over protective and detects things that aren't even harmful. it prolly deletes the exe files. case 2: you are lying.......you are lying. :) lol 
,nittany,2011-02-12T11:33Z,"If nothing is removed, how can this be 5GB when the other FLT version is over 10GB?

If it comes down to just file packing, why didn't FLT compress his files smaller and save people from downloading 5GB extra?

I'm not sure if I trust this torrent, I wish the uploader would have put in the description what he did to make this so much smaller."

and lol, just because a program is tested and working for one person, doesn't mean it will work for every person.  there's billions of possible computer setups.  if people are experiencing crashes, it could easily be something to do with their computer.  not because they are dumb, or newbs, or whatever you feel like immaturely calling them"

I tried both languages install none work same error.

Every time the installer is run once it uttorent then shows the torrent as missing 16mb of data if you force a recheck but after redownloading same thing happens installer is corrupting the data it's self what a waste of download and time 

Stick with Dead Space 2 FLT at least you know 100% chance it will work, with this you can try your luck but better of spending the extra 5gb download on FLT as I now will"
