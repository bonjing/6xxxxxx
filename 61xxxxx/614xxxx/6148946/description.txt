"Heaven Can Wait"

Addison plans Bizzy and Susan's wedding while 
trying to keep her distance from the overly 
flirtatious Dr. Rodriquez. Sam is concerned 
about the care his longtime patient is 
receiving, and Sheldon refers Charlotte to his 
mentor and friend for psychiatric help.

Enjoy  :)
