btw If you are on the Upstairs Downstairs torrent, please note that many have come
through with a fast enough completion in that they were willing to share their seed. Some seemed to leave with 40% completions even! That's a sad waste.
Oh well we hope this will work out yet - having made the point here today. 

Many others have simply quit, as there isn't enough sharing that is occurring and
so they leave frustrated. We cannot pump in seed if the torrent wont take any more
when not enough sharing has occurred. That's how the software works that we all use.

So whether its Rumpole or any other major torrent, please join in to share -
even after you get your download - if you are willing to promote culture at
its best!

This movie today is from Israel and looks at religious dogma in what are the 
implications of the teachings of sacrifice as related in the story of Abraham
which all are asked to celebrate and appreciate for what it is supposed to mean
even today.

The effect on all concerned in this sad movie about a great kid who
although has kindness shown to him - as that is Jewish culture - caring
for children is all they are really in fact taught in modern days equally -
the effect has to be seen as clearly dissonant as it isn't easy enough to 
rationalize in order to truly make sense of it all - I suspect.
