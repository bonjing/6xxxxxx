Some may have the chance to get a copy of a movie a log time before its release through working for a big time studio in HOLLYWOOD or They might have worked for a TV show that reviewed movies, (SISKEL & EBERT), and got access to movies long before the release time. ANYWAY, IF these lucky people revealed who they were or there exact means of how they got hold of a movie that long before its release, they wouldn't be doing it any longer, they would be arrested. SO, my point is that SOME people DO INDEED have the ability to get ahold of movies a long time before they are released. Just because YOU (@jzaw) do NOT have a way to get a movie a LONG TIME before it is released is not a reason or even the tiniest bit of proof that it can't or doesn't happen. You are the kind of person that has ZERO ingenuity and could NEVER figure oout on your own how to get a movie before its release date. . .  or find your way out of a paper bag!!! LMFAO... IDIOT. JUST for the record, I can't prove HOW it happens (movies getting posted here and being the real movie, long before they are supposed to be out), but I have seen it here on this site happen a lot more then you might think!!!! DON't ask rediculous questions. NO ONE in that has this ability would EVER explain it online. Its there secret and it should always be that way. This may be a FAKE upload, but you shouldn't ASSUME that ALL movies that are uploaded here before there release time are ALL fake. . .  you will miss out if you do that."

Actually this is real, I just got it downloaded and it looks like a video game or something like that. Maybe a prequel to another CGI animated movie based on a video game. The graphics are only so so, but it is as real as the rising sun!!!!"
