eventually do it yourself if you can - you even did not manage to upload a SINGLE torrent.
I'd vote such leeches and parasites off here obviously.

The content is important not the form, and if you do not have what you like, you like what you have. Learn a little bit of history and stop bullshitting! "
,DragonKP,2011-02-07T12:18Z,"tickles39 you are a dumb ""form purist"" - attacking me and audio format and not content itself! It is nicely called ""ad hominem"" classic logical fallacy.

If you are not sure than download one chapter and check first. Anyway there is no proper category for computer generated voice, and audio books is the best available.

And many people care more about subject itself than how nicely it is read, what is MUCH better than reading hundreds of pages yourself.

Next time I clearly mark in description that it is computer generated voice.

Bye!"

My main goal is to allow the knowledge to be disseminated more easily, and because people are rather lazy this days, the audio book is a kind of solution.
Content is important - and they figured out some stuff long time ago, but people are not listening, nor even hearing !!! "
