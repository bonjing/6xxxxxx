1. Run avast, and at Settings-> Troubleshooting disable avast! self-defense module. 
2. Exit avast! UI (Stop AvastUI.exe and AvastSvc.exe through Windows Task Manager).
3. Run the patch and follow the instructions.

If avast! self-defense module can't be disabled before rebooting then reboot,
disable avast! self-defense module, run the patch and follow the instructions.

thanks
