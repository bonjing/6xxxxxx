Morris Minor and the Majors was a band led by the comedian and writer Tony Hawks (not to be confused with the skater Tony Hawk). They were made vaguely famous by their 1988 song, "Stutter Rap (No Sleep 'Til Bedtime)". The song aimed to parody the then popular Beastie Boys. The other two members were Rusty Wing and Phil Errup (real names Paul Boross and Phil Judge).

It reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart,[1] No. 14 in Canada and was a No. 2 hit in Australia. It sold over 220,000 copies, but earned them the title one-hit wonders.

The Stutter Rap single had a joke B-side titled "Another Boring B-side", the lyrics of which parody the B-side itself of being typically devoid of inspiration.

In Australia, they had a second charting single with "This Is the Chorus" (No. 22), which parodied Stock/Aitken/Waterman; although it did not chart in the UK.

A TV series followed from this, Morris Minor's Marvellous Motors, written by and starring Hawks. In it the fictional bandleader attempted to maintain his pop career while running a garage. It ran for one series in 1989.
