Comedians Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy return to the stage in this sequel to the successful concert film The Blue Collar Comedy Tour. In The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again, the four Southern comics perform separate sets in which they present their "redneck"-style humor unfettered and uncensored, and also team up for some group funny-making along the way. This release will fulfill your minimum daily requirements of the expressions "Get 'er done!" and "You might be a redneck..."
