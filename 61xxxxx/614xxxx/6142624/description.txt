Ayumu Aikawa is a zombie, resurrected by a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe after being killed by a serial killer. As he tries to make the best of his undead life, he encounters a masÅ-shÅjo named Haruna and inadvertently takes her magic powers, being forced to become a masÅ-shÅjo in the process.

Episode 02: No, I'm a Vampire Ninja
A week after the Megalo attack, Ayumu's dinnertime is suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a vampire ninja named Seraphim who requests the assistance of Eucliwood. Wanting to replace Ayumu's role as Eucliwood's servant, Seraphim challenges him to a fight which Ayumu just barely manages to win. Seraphim decides instead to become Ayumu's servant and live with him so she can be close to Eucliwood. Ayumu recalls the night when he first met Eucliwood. Later that night, Ayumu came across a house being attacked by a serial killer, and was stabbed by a sword in the process, before Eucliwood revived him as a zombie. The next day when Haruna gets into an argument with Ayumu and tells him to die, Eucliwood slaps her, saying death isn't to be taken lightly, so Haruna apologises to her.
