Episode 824 - Shmoocon 2011 - Custom Bluetooth Hacking Hardware

This time on Hak5 we venture back to DC for Shmoocon and meet up with Michael Ossmann of GreatScottGadgets.com to find out about project Ubertooth - a custom hardware device for sniffing and injecting bluetooth packets.

Then Shannon finds out the latest from Hackers For Charity with our good friend Johnny Long.

Look out for even more Shmoocon coverage next week as we wrap up Hak5 season 8.
