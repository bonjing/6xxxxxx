After four long weeks, the "unknowns" move to the ranch and are reunited with the other contestants, who get to meet the new trainers for the first time. Host Alison Sweeney explains that the ranch contestants will be safe this week if they collectively lose more than 48 pounds, but for the "unknowns," they will be facing their first elimination all season. And both teams only get to see their trainers once this week. The "unknowns" experience some surprises while settling into their new home, and a secret is revealed about how one contestant has lost so much weight. A challenge involving weights shows which team stacks up to be the best, and later, everyone weighs in and finds out whether one or two players will be going home.
