This is a video Privacy International commissioned as part of their European Privacy and Human Rights project.

Because of our limited resources, we are unable to host this video on our own servers, so we have to use a third-party service (Vimeo) which uses third-party cookies and web bugs which are beyond our control.  One day, we hope, this will not be necessary, and we can either host our own content or third party providers will not use third-party cookies.

As such we have decided to create a torrent for this video to give people the choice between privacy and convenience.
