Stargate Atlantis Season 1 disk 1 of 5 


Its a ISO file. 


NTSC format. English by default but not the only option.

The audio sampling is standard surround sound. I changed nothing. Its all good.


The ISO image is the entire DVD with the directors narrative
on every episode plus the behind the scenes or bonus features
where applicable... Its a sci-fi geeks dream come true.. Almost 
nothing was removed from the original DVD. To make the compression
ratio stay above 50% a alternate audio track lingo may have been dropped. Other then that I am too lazy to make an avi file.



ANY questions about how to mount or burn the ISO file?

They have all sorts of tutorials to help for things like this.
Knock yourself out.
You will have a more pleasant experience if you look for the
answers yourself before you ask the admins.


There will always be at least 1 seeder of these .ISO files for at
least 3 months after posting so don't complain about no seeders and all leeches or it is too slow or not moving cus if you do its easier for me to delete the torrent then to listen to you wine. :)
