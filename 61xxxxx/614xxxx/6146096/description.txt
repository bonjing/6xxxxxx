 NOTES:

  Well since we can't prove that the VAMPS release is just another p2p
  recode and not really a dvdrip,we decided to go ahead and release a 
  true retail xvid rip internally for those of you who care about quality.
  Oh yeah,picture proof included in proof dir for this and for TWiZTED's
  1080p BluRay.
