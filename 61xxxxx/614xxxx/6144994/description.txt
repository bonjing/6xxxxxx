Set amongst the backdrop of the towering, concrete-clad estates of south London â€˜Zebra Crossingsâ€™ blends a diverse mixture of characters that all share one thing in common: The incredible loneliness of living alongside 7 million other people.

Hard-hitting would be an appropriate phrase to describe this tale of four South London lads from writer and director Sam Holland. Not only because their lives are depicted completely without compromise but also because these boys solve most problems with their fists.  They are the children of the council estates, urban thugs with little chance of release from the concrete coliseum that surrounds them.

Fuelled by anger and a hatred of the society that made them, their lives are characterized by petty crime and violent retribution meted out according to their own bigoted rules. Having long stopped hoping for tomorrow they live for the moment, relying on the transient pleasures of drugs and loveless sex.
