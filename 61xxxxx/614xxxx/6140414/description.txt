 Plot Outline:	A group of hot young drama students are recruited to work in a new â€œhaunted houseâ€ attraction by flamboyant, impresario Walston Rey, whose revolutionary holographic system allows monstrous creations to be projected in an infinite number of scenarios. As a marketing ploy, the house Walston has chosen was once the scene of seven horrible and gruesome murders committed by Janet Darrode. Now Darrodeâ€™s angry spirit wants to continue her killing spree by hideously murdering each student in diabolically insidious ways!
