@rockyRD
I got the same problem with Wyvern installer, it doesnt start to install.
The big problem of 3D DAZ content is that the content is created specialy for DAZ 2.x or DAZ 3.x or DAZ 4.x .. if you dont have the proper version of DAZ , it wont instal.
Some POSER content it ignores the application version and it starts to install but youll have to do some manually changings like converting from .mc6 files to .pp2 if you are using DAZ.More tips find on DAZ forums and more content to try on ""gfx"" sites.DAZ 3.24 remain best version as DAZ 4.x is still in beta versions and DAZ 4.0 came out to fast .."
