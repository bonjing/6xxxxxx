3D models for Daz 3D Studio and Poser with Creatures from Sci-Fi;Fantasy area.
When you install them make sure the path is x:\your DAZ main folder name\content.For Poser..srry i dont have it,but should select same path to install.To see location of each creature in Daz you can run a Search for new content or navigate into ReadMe's Folder and search for object name for more details.
Some models may require few models allready installed.
Example Biguana - Riding Lizard require Victoria 3.0, David Base, Aiko 3.0 Base, Hiro 3.0, Michael 3.0 Base, Stephanie 3.0 Petite Base , so make sure you have read the install notes in order to get a fully working model.
Wyvern 2.0 installer might be broken ,does not start,at least for me, feel free to test or delete and search on google for another upload maybe sharing websites.
