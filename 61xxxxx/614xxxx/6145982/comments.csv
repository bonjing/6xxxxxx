,m0u5e,2011-02-03T20:10Z,what do you mean by it must say you are playing the magicka demo? Do you download the demo and run that too? Or add the magicka.exe file as a non steam game and name it Magicka demo?
,MekoX,2011-02-03T21:16Z,"@m0u5e...well what I did is download the beta,download this 7 update and replace everything on the beta folder with this update..worked here"
,MekoX,2011-02-03T21:23Z,"Well..what i did is first download the beta,then download this update, then copy-paste and overwrite everything from the update7 folder to the beta folder.and that steam_appid.txt thing and type 73050 on it. then start it from steam.It worked for me"
,dopeydave420,2011-02-03T21:32Z,"to many stupid people not enough bullets.

this update works great, as have the past 7 of them , people are just retarded, no viruses, and i highly doubt steam bans, unless he did something completley retarded. if ur that dumb u shouldnt be using pirated rips."

Clicked on magicka Icon BĂM! Game crashes. All the time! I'm desperate. I Haven't cracked it or anything after installing..."
,Vallhael,2011-02-15T14:35Z,"Ok FFS tried even to just crack the game, it still wont launch!! wtf is wrong, god damned.."
,Ifyouare,2011-02-17T04:48Z,"@Deathwalk
How do you create a steam_appid.txt file. And where is the root directory?"
,Imgaerion,2011-02-17T12:17Z,".txt file is a regular notepad file, so you just create a notepad file with the steamidd name, then type in the number. As of directory, i would guess into the game-directory!( haven't done it myself yet)"
,Ifyouare,2011-02-17T22:19Z,"I figured it out and it works. So everyone can see it:
1. Install SKIDROWS version(Don't crack)

2. Install Update 7(Don't crack:Apparently, the other version aren't working online)

3. Open ""Notepad"" and type in ""73050""(Without the quotes) then save it as ""steam_appid.txt""

4. Put the ""steam_appid.txt"" in the main folder, usually located in Program Files.

5. If Steam was running in the background previously, restart it.

6. Don't do anything with Steam besides open it. After you open it and log in, leave it running in the background.

7. Run as Admin(some people have to do this)

8. There you go, it should be working."

,Landazar,2011-03-14T04:09Z,"Followed instructions (didnt put crack, only update) and it doesnt start."
,xxphantom,2011-03-17T14:32Z,"For some reason I can't install Microstonf .NET Framework 3.5 on the original Magicka. It just says error.

I think that's the reason when I click on Magicka it takes me to the Magicka store page on steam. (Yes I installed update 7 without a problem.)"
,stefanius98,2011-03-19T09:29Z,i downloaded the skidrow version and instaled it and it sais (the aplication failed to instalize properly)wtf
,baserun,2011-03-19T19:03Z,when you use windows 7 dont put .txt after your file name at least that worked for me
,MalFusiOn,2011-04-17T01:07Z,"doing this on steam will eventually get u caught and banned, maby worse for $10 to play online its not worth it, ima stick to single player and if i want online ill buy it"
,Blaze-Viper,2011-06-02T21:34Z,@cdub6959 You really have no idea what you're talking about.
,AuraxMark,2011-06-06T21:19Z,Help! Magicka stops working when it gets to the first cut scene!
