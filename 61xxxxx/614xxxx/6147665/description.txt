Toy Story

Storyline: Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll, is the leader of a group of toys that belong to a boy named Andy and come to life whenever humans are not around. With his family moving to a new home and one week before his birthday, the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy receives a space ranger Buzz Lightyear action figure, whose impressive features soon see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody is disappointed and resentful at his replacement, while Buzz does not understand that he is a toy, believing himself to be a real space ranger, and sees Woody as an interference in his mission to return to his "home planet". Andy's next door neighbor Sid Phillips has been kicked out of summer camp earlier and Woody explains to Buzz that Sid is a person who tortures and destroys toys just for fun.

Toy Story 2

Storyline: Woody prepares to go to cowboy camp with Andy but his arm is ripped, forcing him to stay on the shelf. Later when Woody was put on the shelf, he finds a broken squeeze toy penguin toy named Wheezy, who is to be sold at a yard sale since his squeaker is broken. With help from Andy's dog, Buster, Woody sneaks out and saves Wheezy, but falls off before he can make it inside the house. He is eventually found by a greedy, enthusiastic toy collector who ends up stealing Woody when Andy's mother refuses to sell him. Buzz Lightyear and the other toys recognize the thief as Al McWhiggin, the owner of Al's Toy Barn, and set out to rescue him.

Toy Story 3

Storyline: Andy is now 17 years old and packing for college, and his toys who have not been played with in years feel forgotten and abandoned. Andy decides to take Woody with him to college and intends to store the other toys in the attic. By accident, Andy's mom throws the other toys away, making them think they are no longer wanted; they escape and decide to climb in a box to be donated to the Sunnyside Daycare. Woody, the only toy who saw what really happened, is forced to follow the others and tries to explain they were thrown out by mistake, but they refuse to listen.
