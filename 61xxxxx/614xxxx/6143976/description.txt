This is the only song actually by The Fat Boys on "The Disorderlies" soundtrack from the 1987 movie that they starred in. The Fat Boys were famous for their HUGE part in inventing "beatboxing" and along with The Beastie Boys and RunDMC they all played a BIG part in inventing rap music. Enjoy say thank you and for muthaFLACking sake SEED back at least what you get!!!!! Love, DrScott
