The first CD has Introductory, Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced and the second CD has a ""Super Advanced"" section as well as an ""Archival"" section.  The second CD has a long 50 minute workout that combines everything you learned from the first CD.

I lost my JP Performer VHS videos, and the Universal Reformer seems like it is very similar so these exercises should work with that.
