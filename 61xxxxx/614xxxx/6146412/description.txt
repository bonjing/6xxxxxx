From the Actor
Classical Pilates technique videos feature two of the most renowned Pilates professionals in the world, master instructor Bob Liekens and commentator Alycea Ungaro, who uphold the tradition and high ideals of Joseph Pilatesâ€™ original New York City Studio, which began during the 1920s.
BOB LIEKENS, Artistic Director & Master Instructor, is from Belgium. In 1983, he traveled to NYC to further explore his dance career and started Pilates training at the original studio. He initially pursued studies at the Graham Center for Contemporary Dance; he became one of the first certified teachers in the technique in 1991 and taught at the school for two years. Romana Kryzanowska invited him to teach the Pilates method in 1986, and he has been teaching under her inspiration ever since. He was instrumental in building her Teacher Trainer Certification Program, co-created the Training Manual, and originated the current exam system. Bob is internationally recognized as one of the most renowned leaders of our profession, and conducts instructor training seminars, as well as continuing education programs. In the fall of 2000, he joined the team of the Power Pilates Studio in NYC.
