,fakebest,2011-02-02T02:26Z,"@joshfb your so dumb.  you should just get killed because your worthless except for being a burden and people download stuff not only because it is free which wastes less money, but becuase you can get most stuff before it comes out in stores, you can get use it faster than getting a retail copy from a store usually, and the format is usually easier to use but even if all that other stuff is not true for you the free factor will win every time unless your some weird rich guy. also this game works fine and nothing is wrong with it but I would wait until updates stop coming out or at least slow down to maybe once a month or something because since the update is integrated in the full game with every release you have to get the whole game every time.

,OmniNegro,2011-02-02T08:45Z,"People download games and patches so they can experience if it is even going to work. And if they like it. They can buy it if they like it.

Trolls are obvious and pathetic.

Even for a petty ten dollars, if it does not work, I do not want it and will not pay for it."
,wings2011,2011-02-02T09:00Z,"We're downloading here the 6th update of a game that was released like a week ago, because the developers like using their customers as beta tester and then some of you have the guts to tell others to buy the game?! You're funny!

No, intelligent people only consider to buy a game after the beta testers, in this case the customers, are done testing."
,Kiberia,2011-02-02T17:47Z,"@Deathwalk
