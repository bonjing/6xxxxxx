,vermintor,2011-03-01T10:28Z,"to turn off windows activation technoligy....
run/servises/ then scroldown list untill you find windows activation. right click it,goto properties and disable, you can still use windows update.
only do this when you have activated your copy.
if services is not showing windows activation you will have to wait untill it installs as a update, dont worry this can be turned off.

hope this helps you all "

Only thing I loaded after install was this Loader from Daz. During installation I noticed some strange background installs going on. IE had several hijackers install afterwords and the gadgets on the sidebar would not load properly b/c of certain registry entry. Took a lot of cleaning with spybot, ccleaner and avast to get everything straight. Still don't know if its completely clean. Seems to be a lot of crap lurking in this torrent. Don't know if it was added into some of the other stuff in the torrent or packed into the loader itself. Just beware. "
