Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973)

Director: Sam Peckinpah

Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is an oasis of calm after the mayhem of Peckinpah's earlier The Wild Bunch, although it still contains enough spitting and shooting to count as a classic Peckinpah western. The story of how Pat Garrett turned from outlaw to criminal and hunted his former partner Billy the Kid, is an archetypal western legend, and the film's structure and dialogue presupposes a knowledge of the story.

Watching Pat Garrett feels like looking at a fascinating old photograph in which you can read the whole lives of the people captured. Peckinpah's use of freeze-frames to break up action scenes creates a feeling of melancholy for times irretrievably lost, as do the long dialogue scenes between Pat (James Coburn) and Billy (Kris Kristofferson). When Billy asks Pat how it feels to be wearing a badge, and he says, "It feels like times have changed", we see that they both know that there is no going back. The world no longer has a place for the kind of men they used to be, and they can either accept this and change or be destroyed.

Bob Dylan puts in a strange appearance as a silent, squinting vagrant; more important to the film is his thumping, scratching musical score which hangs in the air like dust throughout. There is also a rather unpleasant chicken-shooting sequence, although animal-rights activists should bear in mind that Sam "never shot any animal, man, woman or child that he didn't eat himself." Well worth seeing for its performances, unique atmosphere and integrity.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
