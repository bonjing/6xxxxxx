Noam Chomsky: â€œThis is the Most Remarkable Regional Uprising
that I Can Rememberâ€

In recent weeks, popular uprisings in the Arab world have led
to the ouster of Tunisian dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,
the imminent end of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarakâ€™s regime,
a new Jordanian government, and a pledge by Yemenâ€™s longtime
dictator to leave office at the end of his term. We speak to
MIT Professor Noam Chomsky about what this means for the future
of the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy in the region. When
asked about President Obamaâ€™s remarks last night on Mubarak,
Chomsky said: "Obama very carefully didnâ€™t say anything...
Heâ€™s doing what U.S. leaders regularly do. As I said, there is
a playbook: whenever a favored dictator is in trouble, try to
sustain him, hold on; if at some point it becomes impossible,
switch sides."
