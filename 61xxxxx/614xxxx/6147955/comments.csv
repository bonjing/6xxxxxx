,BP32,2011-08-22T13:43Z,"please help me I downloaded a trainer for Mafia II, it said I need update 4 so it could work, I installed this update on mafia 2 and the everytime I activate the trainer it crashes my game!!
please help!!"
,RadleyGH,2011-09-28T07:00Z,"This doesn't break the game you fucking retards. After you update you must apply the new crack from the skidrow folder.

If you're missing a .dll, it's because your antivirus deleted it. Just google the DLL and you can find a download link for pretty much any of them."
,deadone,2011-12-02T20:11Z,"Does anyone know what version the game is with this, I want to use a trainer with it but I do not know what version this takes it to.
Anyone?"
,boygamer,2012-01-10T06:22Z,"binkw32.dll problem has got to do with directx update that you need to get. BTW, does anyone have this problem where Vito's weapon keeps changing to his hands?"
,boygamer,2012-01-10T06:26Z,"http://www.directxupdate.com/
Its weird that a windows update could ever fix anything, but this one does.... just make sure it installs the latest redistributables; I fixed my computer with an installer from a different source, which I unfortunately cannot find at the moment.... this should work, though.
BTW the Binkw32.dll error might show up on computers with bad graphics - make sure you have proper specs."
