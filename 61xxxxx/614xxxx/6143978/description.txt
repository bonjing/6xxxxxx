Der MÃ¶rder Dimitri Karamasoff (1931)

Symopsis
Young Dimitri Karamasoff, on leave from  the army, returns home to ask his father for money to get married. When he arrives he finds that his father has become smitten with a young woman of extremely questionable character named Gruschenka. His father gruffly rebuffs Dimitri's request for money. Dimitri immediately seeks out his fathers lover to demand that she break off the engagement. Things get a bit more complicated when his anger towards her turns to infatuation - and eventually obsession. Dimitri and his father are both mad for Gruschenka, but she doesn't want anything from either of them - except their money. Things come to a head when the old man is found murdered. Did Dimitri really commit patricide? Or is there more to the story?
