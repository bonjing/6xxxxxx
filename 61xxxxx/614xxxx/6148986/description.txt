In the Fall of 1989 Hurricane Hugo swept through the Carolinas. Fortunately it came through during the night when most people were in bed which minimized the number of people injured or killed.The path of the hurricane reached deep into the piedmont area of the Carolinas where the threat of a hurricane was largely ignored. If you did not listen to the radio or TV that evening chances are you went to bed unaware of the bad conditions coming, much less the threat of a hurricane. It is doubtful that anyone slept soundly through it though.Stepping out the next morning into the havoc it created was a sobering experience. So many trees and telephone poles were knocked over and debris scattered about. Yet most of it fell near but not onto the houses and spared the homes and lives of many people. That was something to be thankful for.The title song of this album came from the memory of that hurricane and the devastation it brought.
