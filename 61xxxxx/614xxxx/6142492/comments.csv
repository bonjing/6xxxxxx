[T],SgtRlee,2011-02-01T11:56Z,You're welcome Shane :) i just found this promo a few days ago along with a few other videos from her. I'll get some of those posted also when i upload another time.
[T],SgtRlee,2012-01-25T04:14Z,"Just a quick note on this video and the current Media Player Classic, and that is that i'm getting a playback with an aspect ratio of 16/9 when the properties clearly state an aspect ratio of 4/3, and this also happens in a couple more promo's i posted, like ""A Flock Of Seagulls - Space Age Love Song [promo]"", so you might want to force a 4/3 aspect ratio when playing it. The promo she did on the German show ""Bananas"" is much better than this one, so you might want to check that out also."
