Kim Wilde - Love Blonde [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Love Blonde" is the first single from the Kim Wilde album Catch as Catch Can, released in 1983.

The song sold moderately, restoring some of the ground lost from her previous release "Child Come Away" and is reputedly about Wilde herself.

It marked the first occasion where Wilde released a 12" extended version of one of her singles, and indeed the first time she released a 12" single in her home country (she had previously released 12" singles in Europe, but merely featuring the "normal" version of the single). The UK edition of the 12" single included a free poster. The version on the 7" single was slightly shorter than that on the original LP.

Kim Wilde (born Kim Smith, 18 November 1960 in Chiswick, west London) is an English pop singer, author and television presenter. She burst onto the music scene in 1981 with the new wave classic "Kids in America", which hit number two in the UK Singles Chart. Major U.S. success eluded her until 1987, when she topped the charts with her version of The Supremes' hit "You Keep Me Hangin' On". Since 1998, Wilde had an alternative career as a gardener, whilst still being active in music.
