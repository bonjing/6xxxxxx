,Wisper83,2011-02-06T07:37Z,"does this update allows the ""stealth"" bomber to upgrade and to take skills every lvl ?"
,Moreau,2011-02-06T19:06Z,I got the same error and its cuz i installed the update to the wrong directory. make sure you select your civ v installation directory ^^
,hannumantibba,2011-02-09T17:10Z,"After installing this update, the game has become much less responsive, and it has crashed a couple of times."

Uncheck read only and hit apply and redownload the patch and reapply content in crack folder."
,Furious1964,2011-02-15T16:52Z,Why is the version number the same as Update 6?

,a_simplyreminder,2011-04-17T15:43Z,"Same thing here: the game crashes some times and it is often VERY SLOW when loading other players moves after own turn.
DonÂ´t install this!"
,i7dualBoot,2011-04-22T04:22Z,Hugely grateful to SKIDROW and their continuing support - just wondering if anyone here know of news re: update 8? Current version is supposedly 1.0.1.221 released 28th of March 2011..

,Bvrns,2011-05-15T23:20Z,killercarver: Is that torrent a proper release from SKIDROW?
,killercarver,2011-05-16T08:47Z,"Bvrns:  I want to say no..all you get is the files that need to be replaced, the danish add-on, and there is a skidrow.ini, but that's it.  been playing with procylon's call to power mod and I was actually able to finish a game!!  Just finished another on a HUGE map!!!  WOW!  you can tell when memory gets lows as things will stop displaying or start jumping, but restart and you're right back in it.  Also loads a hell of a lot faster and there isn't 10 mins between turns."
,Vieraldi,2011-05-21T04:08Z,"@killercarver

I was pleased to see Kamehameha and Harold Bluetooth as leaders, but there is an error in the beginning where you decide to pick a research. The format is messed up and thus can't pick any research. The update basically screwed up any chances to get past the first turn. "
,killercarver,2011-05-21T07:45Z,"@Vieraldi 

Definitely not having that problem.  What are you playing as? I'll try it out.."
,Bvrns,2011-05-22T06:14Z,"killercarver: Thanks for your reply! Vieraldi, I am not facing the issues you speak of; I just started test games with Bluetooth and Kamehameha, and completed about 30 turns each. Maybe a reinstall is in order?

Boy, this is my first Civ game, and I am definitely buying it in the Thanksgiving Steam sale! Am also saving some for Diablo 3... once that thing is released, goodbye outside world! :D

Sorry, got carried away."
,Vieraldi,2011-05-25T06:29Z,"@killercarver

I tested with Bluetooth first, then the original leader Nobunaga, both issues are found, so I presume the entire game is affected. Though, I got past around it by means of choosing an era other than the ancient one. I do have to bear a few issues including the introductions where he narrates and welcomes the leader. That's all the information I can give out now. "
,Dr.Jake,2011-05-29T21:46Z,"Does anyone know when Skidrow is gonna add the Polynesian, Spanish, Incan, and Danish Civilizations? I haven't installed the torrent yet but they say they've added the Spanish and Incan scenario packs but I'm assuming that doesn't include the respective civilizations?"
,Bvrns,2011-05-30T17:39Z,"Dr.Jake, here is my install order; my Civ5 is complete in ALL respects:
1. Original Civ5 (SKIDROW) ISO
2. This update (Update 7 - SKIDROW)
3. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6378870/Civilization5_update_1.0.1.275_and_viking_dlc

Yes, all those civilizations you mentioned are playable."
,Riotdrone,2011-06-08T11:19Z,"I have the skidrow release patched to the latest version without any bugs or issues at all. If you install this and your game starts bugging out, happened to me at first, install the next update:

After that my game is fully updated and bug free."

,wowme,2011-09-11T14:37Z,"I've downloaded the Skidrow version, cracked and it works. 

Then i tried to install this update and i get this error. 

""The existing file is marked read-only"" and i am give the option to abort, retry and ignore. 

Abort exists the installation, retry doesn't work and ignore keeps changing files, so i can't possibly ignore every single file in the installation.

The first file this happens is the browserutilities.lua or something. 

Anyone else has any idea what this is about? Maybe i shouldn't crack the original game before i update and then use only the update crack? 

Thanks for reading. "

,DavidJerk,2011-11-26T17:58Z,Missing .dll files can be easily downloaded. Just search for the missing file and you'll find it. It's quite common to miss a few files. 
,DiogoSwan,2011-12-16T18:36Z,"Oh, finally! Thanks for the SKIDROW, my Civ V is finally working! I'm playing on a huge-set map and I've got almost 70 cities, but the game is now playing smoothly. :D Yeah, it is still slow as hell, but it doesn't crash anymore. But I am still traumatized by the numerous bugs It had to fix, so I play every turn as it was the last one, always saving my game before the worse happens.

But, until now, everything is perfect. Thanks, Skidrow!"
,Aninduil,2012-01-05T13:44Z,Lets hope the game won't crash after creating a new game. :S

Any thoughts or suggestions?"
,rabby23,2012-02-06T20:31Z,"Hey, I solved my problem.  I deleted entire Civ V directory, re-installed SKIDROW's cracked Civ V, but before I copied over the cracks, I installed this update, and used the SKIDROW folder that came with this update.

Just wanted to say this is a quick and easy update and crack.  I ran into zero complications.  Bravo.

Opened update folder, ran update file as administrator, doubled-checked install directory, installed, opened Skidrow folder, copied everything there, pasted to Civ main install directory (that I previously doubled-checked), played game.  

Also, I didn't have to uninstall in order to apply this update/crack."
