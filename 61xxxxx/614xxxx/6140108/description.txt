Players will be distinguished from one another through a sophisticated database that evaluates and grades each players skill-set over 36 attributes and 57 traits, compiled by 1700 scouts around the world. Real Madrids Kaka will deliver crisp, creative passes, Barcelonas Andres Iniesta will utilize tighter turns and close control to dribble through defenses, Manchester Uniteds Wayne Rooney will hold off defenders and strike shots from distance with pace, and top-flight defenders like Giorgio Chiellini of Juventus will anticipate, predict and react to offensive players to win back possession.
