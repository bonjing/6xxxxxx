,copperleaf,2011-08-24T18:29Z,"works with magnet link:
1. right click Magnet Link
2.choose Copy link address
3.open you torrent client (like microtorrent)
4.go to File and choose Add Torrent from URL (or some like that)
5.the client should already see your magnet link, if not right click Paste
6.That's it, it would dl like a normal torrent, took about 2 min.for me"
,upload69,2011-09-22T02:15Z,"404-not found

How do i get this with transmission newest version on mac?"
,phbl,2011-09-26T00:01Z,extremely poor quality by means of a frame rate that reminds me of watching streaming video from a canadian internet connection. don't waste your time downloading this unless playback is unimportant to you.
,Erich505,2011-11-01T19:03Z,Any comments about quality or is it just a bunch of klembakes giving out bogus info to the clueless?
