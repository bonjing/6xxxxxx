Making the Connection 



We wanted to deliver the facts but in a relaxed and informal way - to produce a contemporary and upbeat look at the benefits of a plant based diet. We selected 11 diverse contributors to maintain to the films pace and featured music from two Internationally renowned vegan hip-hop artists Promoe and Jah Sun.

If you would like a free DVD of Making the Connection send a SAE (UK only) to the Environment Films office.
