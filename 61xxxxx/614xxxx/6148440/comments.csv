It is abit small but 3242kib/s was the best we could do with this movie

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_rar_protected_torrent_files

- If you see an torrent whois asking you for an password, membership, email address or similar.
PLZ report it to suprbay.org.

Sorry butt ;) Google Translate:

It lives on, in addition, it helps if you get corrupted files
 - You do not need to download the whole Iso or IMG again.
 Only the broken block. - rar47 for an example.

 The ""groups"" , SRT in this case, still do it in this way.
 So the person who puts up such a movie here on TPB, do it as it was an original.
 - In my opinion the right thing. To honor those who have actually done the job.

 The problem is:
 - You need the double diskspace.- Then later you del the rar`s. Problem solved.
 - Who reseed, mignonette, with the rar files intact?

btw: A lot ? of the torrents you may find hera ett TPB, is kind of stolen.
Kinda markt NOT for the public eye, just beetwen frends in an exlusiv Club.

P.s.
I Am from sweden and i am crazy too.
Mabye wrong gradma/grammar, but i`ll still love her.
- The Old Pirat Lady, Den med forummet Piratbyran ,in svenska.

,blipoids,2011-02-05T14:03Z,"I kind of split the subtitle to match the .VOB tracks, so if anyone wants it, let me know (I don't know if I'm allowed to post links). This DVDR deal is a bit of a b*tch for me, because I can't really use VLC because the subtitles look really awful, and my other player only plays individual .VOB files... 

@ alderbaran:

What the freckles was that all about? Anyhow, I got the idea, but man oh man, a whole lot of other ideas too... Thanks, I guess. "
,bander49,2011-02-05T16:58Z,"Så nettopp denne filmen siden jeg har sansen for Otto Jespersen.
Men dette var hverken morsomt eller underholdene.
Dårlige ""dokumentar opptak"" mørke nattscener, løping rundt i skogen med troll i hælene, trenger jeg og si mer?"
