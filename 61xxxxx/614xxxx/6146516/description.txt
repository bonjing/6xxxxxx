This book is really help ful to maintain a healthy body by just spending 30 minutes a day.................

For years I have seen Martial Arts Master Teachers who look like they just left a donut eating contest and won it for the 50th time in a row. Fat out of shape disgusting. These people might know how to kick and punch, but they are out of shape and not a credit to the fitness of the martial arts. This book will show you simple 30 minutes exercise programs designed to keep you looking great. Specific exercises for each body part. It even includes diet information. Sections include exercises for men and women I am so thankful for this guide. This probably more than any other one of Dr. Ted's books has changed my life. I like many people had simply let myself go. I had gained over 100lbs of fat and flab that I slowly packed on to my 6'4" frame over a period of 5-6 years. Man I tell you it is amazing how it can sneak up on you. One day you look in the mirror and want to throw up! You know its a slow process, those you love don't say hey wow look how fat you are getting, that's horrible. (Sometimes I wish they would have!) No, people just pretend not to notice as you blow right up in front of them. Thanks to the information and guidance in How to Develop and Perfect Body in 30 Minutes a day, I am thinner and in better shape than I have been in years..............................
