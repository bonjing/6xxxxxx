& thanks wiwit42 for ur ""warning"" but i'll download it and check it for myself then confirm or deny what u said
anyway, just have to check it myself
thanks mantesh for all ur uploads"
,akaismac,2011-02-23T16:52Z,"wiwit42 is right,
don't bother downloading
the pictures used in the pdf about the workouts are B&W and aren't clear 
try something else
there are plenty of fitness stuff in tpb, just gotta look
u can check the insanity workout by shaun.T, it's great, i'm using it so i know it by experience
peace out"
