Thanks for the comment and add of this FLAC version in my MP3 version of this album.

( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6136531/Bright_Eyes_-_The_People_s_Key_%282011%29%28ADVANCE%29%28Conor_Oberst%29%28In )

Can I be so frank and ask about the source of the FLAC you have uploaded? Is it a legit cd copy? (as the album is being released on feb 15th) or is this the mp3 version converted to flac?

Thanks again!
Cheers!"

,SoundbaronPirateBay,2011-02-04T16:01Z,"Thanks for the quick answer!!
I've compared the mp3 with the flac version and the flac version sounds a lot better indeed!!
Thanks for the info and this copy should hold me over untill the cd arrives!!
Thanks and have a nice weekend!"
[H],politux,2011-02-04T17:06Z,Enjoy!  Long live FLAC.  :)
