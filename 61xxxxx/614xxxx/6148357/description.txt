Diehard fans might find it hard to believe that Bright Eyes could produce anything better than 2005s simultaneously released Im Wide Awake, Its Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn. But in retrospect, those albums feel less developed than The Peoples Key. It starts off as a largely experimental and conceptual record, opening with a strange but fascinating commentary on the expanding universe, time travel, UFOs and the origins of life. But this isnt an overly affected art-rock album that takes itself too seriously. It is Bright Eyes most infectious record to date, with captivating melodies and rhythms.
