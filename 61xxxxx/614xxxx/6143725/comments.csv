,OrpheusDude,2011-03-04T00:00Z,"This is the Decca recording with Antal Dorati conducting the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.  It was originally released in the USA on the (now defunct) London label, and was probably the first digital recording of ""Sacre"" made.  It's an OK performance; there are better recordings out there (try any of the three recordings conducted by Pierre Boulez on Ades (French National Radio Orchestra; very hard to find), Sony/CBS (New York Philharmonic) or Deutsche Grammophon (Cleveland Orchestra)."
