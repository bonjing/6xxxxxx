EVEREST Passes the Torch to AIDA64
BUDAPEST, Hungary - November 21, 2010 - FinalWire Ltd. today announced the acquisition of diagnostics, hardware monitoring, network audit, and benchmarking software, Lavalys EVEREST.

â€œToday is a significant step forward in our progress to deliver a class-leading diagnostics and benchmarking solution,â€ said Tamas Miklos, managing director of FinalWire. â€œThe addition of Lavalysâ€™ customers and technologies will enable us to accelerate investments, meet a wider set of customer needs through a richer solution set, increase efficiencies and significantly expand our opportunities for growth.â€

Beginning immediately, FinalWire will execute on the planned integration of the two companiesâ€™ technologies and customers to ensure a smooth transition that will deliver immediate value for customers, partners and investors.


Descriptiption:
64-bit benchmarks & 64-bit System Stability Test
All CPU, FPU and memory benchmarks are fully ported to 64-bit, utilizing MMX, 3DNow! and SSE instruction set extensions, and scale up to 32 processor cores. An enhanced 64-bit System Stability Test module is also available to stress the whole system to its limits. For legacy processors all benchmarks and the System Stability Test are available in 32-bit version as well.

Hash benchmark with SSE2 & SSSE3 optimizations
A brand new 64-bit security benchmark to measure CPU performance using the SHA1 hashing algorythm. The Hash benchmark is optimized for every popular AMD, Intel and VIA processor core variants by utilizing the appropriate MMX, MMX+/SSE, SSE2, or SSSE3 instruction set extension. It is hardware accelerated on VIA PadLock Security Engine capable VIA C7 and VIA Nano processors.

SSD database with SSD-specific SMART disk health status
AIDA64 further extends its exhaustive hardware database by adding 300 solid-state drives (SSD), making the database count over 115,000 entries total. On top of the usual ATA auto-detect information the new SSD database enables AIDA64 to display flash memory type, controller model, physical dimensions, and data transfer performance data. AIDA64 v1.00 also implements SSD-specific SMART disk health information for Indilinx, Intel, JMicron, Samsung, and SandForce controllers.

Fine-tunable Alerting module
Overheating, over-voltage, and cooling fan alerts are now fine-tunable with alert sound and emergency application launch.

In AIDA64 alert methods are individually customizable for each alert triggers.

DIMM thermal sensor, QST 2.0, Koolance TMS-200 support
The real-time hardware monitoring module was further improved by adding Intel QST 2.0, Koolance TMS-200, Koolance TMS-EB200, and DIMM thermal sensor device support. Improved cooling fan speed measurement on Fintek, ITE and Winbond sensor chips. Sensor support for the latest Fintek, Nuvoton and SMSC hardware monitoring devices.

Support for the latest graphics technologies
Graphics processor and GPGPU details, temperature and cooling fan monitoring for the latest GPUs: AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5430/5450, AMD Radeon E4690, AMD Radeon HD 5550, AMD Radeon HD 6850/6870, nVIDIA GeForce GTS 450, nVIDIA GeForce GTX 460, nVIDIA GeForce GTX 465, nVIDIA GeForce GTX 580. Exhaustive Direc3D and OpenGL video card capabilities detection with DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.1 support.  

What's New:
detection of AMD Catalyst 11.1 driver
detection of AMD Catalyst 11.1a driver
extended reference OpenGL Extensions list (for AMD Cayman)
improved hot-plug storage device support
improved disk temperature measurement for Intel ICH/PCH RAID controllers
improved disk temperature measurement for JMicron RAID controllers
chipset information for Intel ICH8 Series (with Pineview)
