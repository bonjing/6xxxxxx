Video: H.264, 960x400, 23.976 fps, 1000 kbps
Audio: OGG/Vorbis, 2 ch, 48 kHz, 160 kbps
Track 1: Film with RiffTrax commentary
Track 2: Just the film
Subtitles: English
Runtime: 02:28:07

Process: The video was re-encoded from a 720p BluRay rip of the film. The
RiffTrax commentary is sync'd up with the film's audio and then all
DisembAudio sync lines are silenced. The film audio is run through
compressor and autoduck filters to make the commentary most prominent but
keeping the movie audible when the riffers are not talking. This provides,
it seems, the best riff-watching experience.

(even if you don't download it) so they know which riffs are the most
popular!
