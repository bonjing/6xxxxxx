This is what was included in 2 discs that came with my college algebra textbook.  The author is Blitzer, and it is from the 5th edition.  

These are the solutions to all chapter test questions in the textbook.  

If you have a stupid professor who doesn't know how to teach, like me, then these will be very helpful for you. 

Please keep this torrent going by seeding when you are done, or whenever there are peers connected. 

If you would like more instructions, www.coolmath.com helped me.
