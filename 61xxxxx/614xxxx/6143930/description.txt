Plot:

De reeks draait rond FBI agente Olivia Dunham, de gestoorde professor Dr. Walter Bishop en zijn zoon Peter, die worden belast met een aantal vreemde zaken die over de hele wereld gebeuren. Al die vreemde gebeurtenissen zijn blijkbaar op de een of andere manier aan elkaar gelinkt: er is duidelijk 'een patroon' te herkennen dat over alle zaken heen loopt. Het patroon kan tevens gelinkt worden aan Massive Dynamic, een firma die een aantal patenten houdt op een aantal nieuwe technologieÃ«n en enkele mysterieuze onderzoeken doet. Alle zaken draaien rond Fringe science, een tak van de wetenschap die zeer speculatief en omstreden is. Voorbeelden van deze tak van de wetenschap zijn levitatie, telepathie en onzichtbaarheid.
