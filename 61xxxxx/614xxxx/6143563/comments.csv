,-Cortex-,2011-02-10T17:45Z,"Dude, they never said it was 720p! It says it's just a DVD!

It clearly states that the source is 720p, but that the result is 480p.

You muppet."

,DontPissMeOff,2011-02-20T15:11Z,"If you put 720p in the title it means it's 720p - not that the source was 720p! lOl
Nevertheless, if the source was 720p, why didn't you upload 720p NLUPPER002?"
