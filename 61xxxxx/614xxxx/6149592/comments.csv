,AARRGG,2011-03-05T07:43Z,"autorun viruses can be stopped by the following means

autoplay should be deactivated in windows because of transferrable viruses that infect via external hard drives such as flash drives and portable hard drives. the viruses like this are made to replicate themselves onto the pc and then retransfer to any external data storage device to keep the spread going. 

go to start menu and press run
type in gpedit.msc

navigate to computer configuration/administrative templates/system folder and locate ""turn off autoplay"" in that folder list. right click and go to properties. set to enable and change the newly highlighted area to ""all drives. press ok and close all group policy windows. done"
