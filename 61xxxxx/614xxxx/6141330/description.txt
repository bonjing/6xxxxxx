Holy Fuck is an electronic rock band based in Toronto, Canada. Their current line-up includes original and core members Brian Borcherdt and Graham Walsh along with Matt Schulz on drums and Matt McQuaid on bass.

Holy Fuck uses live drums and bass along with a myriad of toy keyboards, guitar pedals, mixers and even a 35mm film synchronizer to mimic modern electronic music, consciously avoiding modern fail-safes like laptops and programmed backing tracks. They have brought their live show to festivals like Glastonbury, Roskilde, Coachella, Lollapalooza, Fuji Rock and All TomorrowÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s Parties. And theyÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ve toured and supported artists such as M.I.A., Wolf Parade, !!!, Mouse on Mars, Cornelius, Super Furry Animals and Phoenix. All the while using the same duct-taped keyboards, film editing gear and all without rehearsing.
