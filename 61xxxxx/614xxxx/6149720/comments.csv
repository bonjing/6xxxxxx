Btw, thanks for all your latest torrents."
,muk0690,2011-02-05T19:18Z,"Pls have a check on the description if you have time. The source is same as yours.
Peace \ /"
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-05T21:11Z,Sorry about that but I can't edit the torrents.Maybe a mod can check them out.
,turlis,2011-02-22T07:30Z,Been finding a lot of fake 720p releases. This too is an upscaled 420p version. At least the subtitles aren't total crap.
,sheghost,2011-03-03T13:28Z,"""I'll ask everybody to stop with the ""it doesn't work"",""it's out of sync"" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine""
i am sorry to annoy but it doesn't work on my mabook - tried on different players (quicktime/miro).
maybe its a mac issue."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-03-12T03:09Z,"I don't know about Macs,maybe it is an issue from it but on a regular pc or laptop the movie has to work.Try KMPlayer and see if it works."
,thelusmcneely,2011-05-08T23:56Z,"I downloaded several versions of this movie. This is the best quality release that I could find. It's not really good quality. Worst than average 720p but way better then the best dvdrips out there.

I hope they release the hole Ghibli collection in bluray. Such masterpieces deserves that."
,thelusmcneely,2011-05-09T00:02Z,"I am a mac user and it plays fine for me on Plex. VLC has some problem with it, it hangs a little on seeking but manages to play it in sync nevertheless. In my old macbook I had stopped using VLC and used only Plex for performance and sync reasons. Maybe you should try it. It's free."
,Golemur,2011-06-08T20:04Z,"the video quality on this is the best i've seen so far but i'm sorry to say, that the video- and audio-stream don't match. actually after about 5 minutes in i get video from over half an hour into the movie."
,jiraia,2011-08-28T07:48Z,No problem with the video and audio. Superb Kriss Kringle. :)
,SnusOchFilm,2011-09-27T18:28Z,Thank you my friend!
,JawDroppinDroopBallz,2011-10-16T22:53Z,"I agree this is the best copy, I had no problems. All these Studio Ghiblis' deserve to be quality I'm happy to part with any size GiB as long as they are good, their collectors items after all... +1"
,MaskWhoRU,2011-11-07T23:07Z,TY so much - really the best copy!!! a/v/m 10+ naturally))
