Eddie Zip does it again in his second release. 

When you talk about great New Orleans singers and piano players today, Eddie Zip must be included. Eddie is a musicians musician; songwriter, producer, and arranger. It was not about the money, that musical greats played in his bands. There is a common thread that runs through Eddie Zips work. Itâ€™s soulful New Orleans.

It all started for Zip at age two. His mother taught him piano while he was still in diapers. His Grandmother was a great Ragtime piano player. She had family jam sessions every Sunday in her living room in New Orleans.

Vocally, he loved Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. And itâ€™s easy to tell by his heart felt way of singing. Just listen to the soulful velvety vocals on â€œThe Letterâ€ and â€œAll These Thingsâ€. Note the melodic and vocal phrasing on â€œSunset Boulevardâ€. And you wonâ€™t miss his awesome display of raw funk on â€œRidiculousâ€ and â€œI Like Your Kinda Loveâ€. He has also collaborated with Dr. John
