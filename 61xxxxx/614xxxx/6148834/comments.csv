,coffeeboy2k,2011-02-05T03:31Z,"Hey YIFI. All your uploads and rips are awesome! May I ask what program you use to convert/rip? They're all so clear yet so small a file size. :)

P.S. ""Gilmore Girls"" upload would be awesome! But maybe you can post them one season at a time so the upload/download wouldn't be so massive."
,reach,2011-02-17T05:05Z,"Great file size for quality. I love this movie, thanks for the upload/download, all's well."
,gabrage,2011-05-13T11:59Z,Thanks! :) (more seed please)
