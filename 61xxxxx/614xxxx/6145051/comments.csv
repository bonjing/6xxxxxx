[V],ua3,2011-02-02T11:01Z,Yes you did put it under Right section. Keep up your uploading work.
[T],teslaman,2011-02-02T12:16Z,"Thanks ua3. :) I also left you a comment on the other torrent about that whole category thing. ;)

Additional note: Usually the category would change on me after a day or so, I can't remember exactly. It has been a while since I tried the correct one again. It will be nice if it doesn't do it anymore! :)"
[V],ua3,2011-02-02T14:54Z,"@teslaman

Don't worry i will keep an eye on your torrent category from now onwards.And i have read the reason in Suprbay."
[T],teslaman,2011-02-02T16:17Z,"Ah ok, cool and thanks. :)"
[T],teslaman,2011-02-09T08:57Z,"Just in case anyone checks here during the next few hours looking for episode 5.... It will be delayed since the first scene rip has bad audio. I'm grabbing the PROPER rip now. ETA about 3.5hrs from comment post time.

Sorry for the delay. :("
