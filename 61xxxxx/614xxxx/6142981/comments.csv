High bitrate, sorted labeled and dated, category directories for studio and other material, complete, album art, everything kept as separate files instead of a .rar, with a thorough description. It's all here, and there's nothing I could suggest to improve it. Torrent creators take note.

Thanks l.diliberto."

,theroyalist,2011-05-05T10:29Z,"Great quality, ridiculous amount of effort obviously went into this gem. Thanks so much.

However, just noticed Technical Ecstacy songs wrongly labelled - e.g. Rock & Roll Doctor is actually All Moving Parts.

Before anyone b!thces about that, get off your @sses & label them yourselves!

Thanks again!"

,christo7,2011-08-09T21:48Z,"Not all 320. In the compilations, you have ""1978 Black Sabbath - Greatest Hits 1970-1978"" labeled ""@320,"" but it is 192kb/s.

That's all I downloaded, so I can't comment on the rest. Not complaining, awesome job."
