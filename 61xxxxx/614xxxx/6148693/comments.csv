Golden Rose Of Montreux Award.

It failed to win, but the results are partially a ""Best Of"" clip show.
Some of these sketches and bits you may not have seen if you saw their Christmas specials (I did recently but I didn't save those, which is why I won't be uploading them.)

The one guest star showcased in a very weak comedy bit that probably didn't help at the awards festival is lovely blonde vocalist
Nina Van Pallandt. She also sings a song."
