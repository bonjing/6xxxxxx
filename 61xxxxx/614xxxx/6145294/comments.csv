Thanks, but when i push F4 she won't move!!!

Why is that?"
,mickyfinnny,2011-02-02T18:38Z,"Well done  NvidiaPhysX i didnt get any errors with GPSModule.dll, as i did with other dloads and fmc is working fine.Many thanks.Marvellous aircraft,...I can now get rid of all the other copies ive managed to aquire over the last 2 weeks.Yippeeee:+}"
,Capt.Jambo,2011-02-02T19:49Z,"@ lorum

It is essencial that you have a joystick with throttle in order for it to function, otherwise the plane wont move.

@ NvidiaPhysX

Thanx a lot for this, now we can test the birb as is, to find out if it is worth the money.

RESPECT"
,Fipspilot,2011-02-02T20:01Z,Maybe you can upload the Aerosoft Huey X?
,lorum,2011-02-02T21:33Z,"Capt.Jambo

joystick!... what a shame! and very strange if you can´t use the keyboard."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-03T10:00Z,"the throttle problem is basic, you need to have a joystick and latest fsuipc. you can take some look at the aerosoft forums"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-03T10:04Z,"I am glad you all liked it!!!

@lorum

you cannot assign the throttles with keyboard, for using throttle with mouse wheel, you have to get the latest fsuipc and inside it you have to deal with LUA script, dunno exactly.If you have mouse with mouse wheel, mathjis KOK can help you out!
Ask him on the forums of aerosoft!"

thanx"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-03T14:57Z,"@fsxomz,

run as admin and did you use the crack which I provided!"
,fsxomz,2011-02-03T15:52Z,installation is successful but when I run as admin an error window said unknown version can not run third party module fsx crashed
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-03T17:12Z,"@fsxomz

is there any previous version of airbus x installed, I mean there are some torrents which offer airbus x rip version, you just uninstall and reinstall, search your fsx directory for other remnants of the bird (you can use Windows Installer Cleanup Utility, but manual method is one which I prefer), eg: there may be other gpsmodule.dll or something in effects folder would have left as such.Tell me if it worked for you! I am ready to help you until it works!!!"
,fsxomz,2011-02-03T17:52Z,"modules\gpsmodule.dll  CRC32 is F79C8463, is it the same with yours?   "
,DIzzyhat,2011-02-03T20:59Z,"wow, just wow!

Thanks man, you've got us some of the best addons and i'm very thankful. Keep on cracking!"
,mickyfinnny,2011-02-03T21:07Z,"@fsxomz after installing V1.20, copy ""gpsmodule.dll"" (Modules Folder) and the ""Navigraph"" Folder(Main fsx Folder)to desktop.Then install other updates.Copy back from desktop""gpsmodulle.dll""on its own first,see if that works.This worked for me earlier,when  the 1.21 version was out.Hope it helps"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-04T10:01Z,"@fsxomz

if it remained even after uninstalling, delete it manually and then reinstall"
,fsxomz,2011-02-04T14:34Z,"finally got it to work, uninstall then del those bin files beside dll.xml,then reinstall. "

This is a very good product actually, but the throttle only works if you have the hardware for that.

It would be the first high quality Airbus addon for FSX which will include fly-by-wire, a fully functioning FMC etc. It will definitely be close to PMDG quality!
