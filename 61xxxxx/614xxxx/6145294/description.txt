Cracked ascrypt_pro.dll and SERIAL key included.

Version 1.20 contains the following updates/ This will not be shipped as an update but as a full new build.


FIXES AND CHANGES IN VERSION 1.20

    * AUTOBRAKES CHANGED
      Should not work even when flaps are retracted too soon and when wheel brakes are just used for a short period of time. We still advice the flaps to be retracted when leaving the runway, not before.
    * OUTER WING TANK QUANTITY GOING NEGATIVE BUG REMOVED
    * ADDED AUTOTHROTTLE DISCONNECT SOUND ADDED
      When Autothrottle is disarmed the caution light will go on and caution chime will sound.
    * AUTOLAND IMPROVED
      Flare is now smoother, but make sure you are at a suitable weight!
    * WING VIEW ISSUE SOLVED
      The whole wing is now visible.
    * QNH IN MCDU NOW ACCEPTS InHg
    * LAN LIVERY INCLUDED
      With thanks to Carenado!
    * BETTER CLIMB PERFORMANCE, BETTER TAKE-OFF PERFORMANCE
      climb to 30.000 feet in 15 minute now possible, see below.
    * NOSEDIVE ON MANUAL LANDING SOLVED
      Disabling AP on final no longer a problem.
    * SPEED TAPES CORRECTED
    * WHITE BOX FOR 10 SEC AROUND FMA-ANNOUNCEMENT
      For 10 seconds after each change there will be a white box around the FMA announcement.
    * ND NOW HAS HDG BUG
      The ARC mode now also shows the HDG bug.
    * SPOILER ARMING REDONE TO NON FSX STANDARD
      Allowing spoiler arming under all conditions with the right mouse button.
    * MCDU PERF PAGE NOW SHOWS DURING PREFLIGHT
    * THR RED ACC & ENG OUT ACC ALTITUDES NOW DEPEND ON ALTITUDE
    * SPEED CONTROL ADDED FOR APPROACH STAGE
      Approach mode will automatically be armed once starting descend with all AP functions in managed mode. Start of descend must either be triggered automatically when reaching TOD (A lower FCU altitude than Cruise altitude should be set) or when starting the descend in managed mode by pressing the EXP button. It can also be armed on the PERF APPR page by pressing LSK6L - "ACTIVATE APPROACH PHASE" will then change to "APPROACH PHASE ACTIVATED". This also happens when changing automatically. Once below 7200 ft AGL speed will be reduced to flap 1 speed setting, extending flaps will reduce speed further until flap 4 where speed is set to Vapp.
    * DAYTIME LIGHT ARTIFACTS REMOVED
    * PFD AND ND DISPLAYS NOW REFRESH FASTER
    * FLIGHT DIRECTOR HEADING CORRECTED
    * ROLL-OUT MODE INCLUDED
    * IN MANAGED MODE, THE FMA SHOULD SHOW [SPEED] AND NOT [THR CLB] AFTER REACHING CRUISE LEVEL.
    * IF "CONF 3" IS CHOOSEN ON PERF APPR PAGE, THEN LANDING CHECKLIST WILL COMMAND FLAPS 3 INSTEAD OF FLAPS FULL


KNOWN ISSUES
These issues are scheduled to be fixed after the 1.20 release (no guarantee though)

    * VLS is always higher than Vapp, this is not correct
    * A/SKID switch triggers seat belts sign
    * Airbus X Connect update


KNOWN ISSUES
These issues are know but are not easy to solve.

    * ND-range from "20" to "10", the flight-track gets cut off
    * Note that the F/O displays do not show all information, this is by design to lighten fps load
