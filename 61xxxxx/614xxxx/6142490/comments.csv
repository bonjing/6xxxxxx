Ties in nicely with the WikiLeaks and, in particular, Countdown To Zero doco's.

I am bit disappointed. 
Your movie is not compatible with xbox 360 :(.
Quality is great but i cant watch it on console."

,aimeri,2011-02-27T23:21Z,I was watching it on my LCD Tv and the quality is great but halfway through the sound stops
