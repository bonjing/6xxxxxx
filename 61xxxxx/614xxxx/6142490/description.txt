Requests (or re-seed requests) should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of newest torrents.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if circumstances allow (i.e. free slots open up).

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.

             ONLY for PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, 
             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).
             WATCH from 6-8 ft. distance at low-res settings of display.       
      272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds
             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems
      320p = frame-size 576x320 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, or 576x240 for 2.35:1
             (movies/theatrical AR)middle-format, playback
             ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however,

      720p = for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV and movies) frame-size is 640p or 1120x640
             (because of my own limit of 1400 MB per encode)  
             or 1280x528-544 pixels for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR),
             hardware intensive
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.       
      NAMING RULE: name.source.year/season/episode.frame-format.encoding-type
      
NOTE 2: 352p and 480p encodes use new tool-chain and new encoding type.
        320p, 360p should be considered obsolete.
        272p would remain because of compatibility with portables, but soon
        would be abandoned.
        Practically, ALL "wide-targets formats" would be abandoned, and
        only PC-PS3-Xbox formats would be encoded.
        I would like to keep PS3/Xbox/standalones compatibility - therefore, 
        I need feedback from users of PS3/Xbox and different standalone 
        MP4 capable players.
      
      
      Most problems people have are with frame-sizes 1280x720 (720p). I recommend 
      and have used one system for years - CoreAVC for H264 
      http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5910023/
      ("Deblocking" set to "Standard") and part of DivX7-8 for AAC - 
      AAC DirectShow filter.

      Both are proved perfect, fastest and provide seamless playback up to 1080p 
      on new generation of computers. Newer NVIDIA graphic cards processors (GPU)
      decode H264 using dedicated subroutines directly served from CoreAVC 
      (I have an ATI card, just in case you were wondering).
      
      New DivX8 is maybe 18% slower than Core AVC and very common, 
      and in order to use DivX8 H264 and AAC DS filters outside DivX7 or 8 player 
      (as in Windows Media Player or Media Player Classic), Haali spliter 
      must be installed. Beware, however, that video quality could be very much
      degraded on encodings where extremely low bit-rates have been used.
      TIP: Switch back and forth between Core AVC and DivX H264 DS filters by marking
      and un-marking Core AVC "Preferred decoder" setting.
      
      Problems one can have may come from either one of the following 
      and-or a combination of these:  the playback system itself, a 
      malfunctioning device or lack of knowledge. 
      
      For instance, any so called "jerky" playback of "system-heavy" 720p comes
      from insufficient CPU and graphic engine power or simply - overloaded 
      computer. Use of ddshow filters and "codecs" is suicidal. This is not 
      Russian 720p Matroska format ("official" 720p) and completely different 
      setup is required (extremely high bit-rates of .mkv 720p to some extent
      "hide" bad encoding style). In low bit-rate H264, such as mine, 
      those errors and bad technique cannot be hidden and therefore are avoided as 
      much as possible.
        
      Any "blurriness" of video comes from less-than-recommended media player. 
      VLC  and a few other players are the most versatile and, generally speaking,
      good - but quality is 10-20% lower.
      Any "blockiness" comes from "system-too-slow" situation, when
       decoding engine of ones device become over-capacitated and cannot 
       process all frames as it supposed to.
      On "I have no video" and "I have no sound" I don't waste my time as this 
      is generally a complete lack of knowledge and/or understanding. 
      RTFM is the best response I can give.

      MP4 is absolutely ISO 14496-1 compliant. There are no B-frames, no CABAC 
      entropy in 272p and 360p, no strange filtering and no AV weirdness of 
      any kind.

      Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).
      If you watch on HighDef TV or new HighRes monitor - take a proper watching
      distance - 6 to 8 ft. (It's a must then, I KNOW how ugly it looks with nose
      in front of screen). LCD panels, especially cheap and affordable ones 
      "hate" low bit-rate encodes. 
      I have two monitors connected and same encode looks ugly on
      LG LED LCD but looks fantastic on normal CRT Samsung one. 
      So, move your bottoms few feet back - or download GB big encodes.
      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
      I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system 
      and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones 
      with Line In of any Stereo rack).

------------------

Please be aware that the download manager called Flashget, Transmission under v1.9, Xtorrent (any), generally malfunctioning Miro/libtorrent, uTorrent lower than 1.8.3, Azureus/Vuze under v4, KTorrent, BitLord and ANY other "wrong" or hacked/patched/"tweaked"/"with-wrong-settings" torrent-program - can and WILL  get you blocked by me.

I will not be re enabling people if they have been using ANY of the above applications; there is NO discussion on this. Please treat this as the ONLY warning you will get about it!

If you have used it, do yourself a favour and get a NEW and proper torrent program.
In light of recent events, I have no intention to discuss or listen to someone's comments/complaints such as Oh, but I am used to it. or I have this-or-that settings, this is good program for torrents.

It might be true for you, but that's not what I see day after day.
Recommended torrent applications are: BitTornado and new uTorrent/BitTorrent!!!

Also, stay AWAY from newly upped torrents, still in the phase of initial-seeding IF you have upload speed below 50kB/s and CANNOT or WILL NOT set UL/DL speeds at 1:1.
Wait until at LEAST five (5) stable seeds are present.
If you have a problem with my initial-seeding rule then go elsewhere to source your files.

You have been warned, my torrents therefore my rules. There are a million other sources to go to if you do not like them.

-------------------------

NEW RULE: Show that gets "-" (negative) rating is on the way out. 
          Let me be clear: 480p is BETTER than XviD:  half in file-size,
          but quality is not half of XviD, right?. 
          480p has BIGGER frame-size ("picture" size) than 272p MORE THAN TWICE 
          (2.16 times) - but file-size is bigger just by silly 10% (15 MB approx.).
          Also, 480p has by ONE THIRD BIGGER frame-size than XviD.
          So - new rule: any complaints came from your head only.
          IF you are frustrated with your life or mentally incapacitated - 
          vent someplace else out. My files are perfect - in given category.
          IF you do not think so - here's the deal: Turn around and go away. 
          Forever.
          SUB-RULE: Normal people! Do not let be over-runned by idiots! Not again-
          Do not allow to be over-voiced. Again.
          IF you like my encodings, you CAN say so - by Rating and by Thanking.
          
          And yes - it is matter of vanity. That's me. Live with that.
