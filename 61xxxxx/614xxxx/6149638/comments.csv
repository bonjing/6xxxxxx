What's up?"
,Monroville,2011-06-30T01:19Z,"You REALLY need to redo this.  Both MKVmerge and Handbrake 0.9.5 give ERROR messages when trying to remux them: 

No Title(s) found:
Your source may be copy protected, badly mastered or in a format Handbrake does not support."

,Biomecha,2012-04-21T07:54Z,"Has anyone tried using Subler ( http://code.google.com/p/subler/ - Mac only, but I'm sure there's a Windows equivalent) to re-wrap the video and audio in a new MP4 container? I will be using it anyway to quickly insert metadata and cover art to the file.

MKV and MP4 are often encoded with the same video codecs, so a program like Subler can turn an MKV into an MP4 in minutes just by recreating the wrapper instead of re-encoding the entire video and audio channels of the file.

It may be able to recreate the MP4 wrapper in minutes and fix the public atom issue."
