The old BitComet crap that you are using has been obsolete for years."
,mysterio12,2011-02-04T06:26Z,thanks fr telling me.im kinda new 2 this.and does my client make any difference on ur speed?????
,prophan,2011-02-05T13:00Z,"No, not really. But Bitcomet generates some extra files (u don't see but us) with no use for every other torrent client. For 6.89GB it's maybe 50MB everyone extra for everyone.

Many thanks btw :)"

,gOlIas,2011-02-09T23:46Z,"I have lots of broken files from this download, plus files all titled like this example. 

""_____padding_file_15_if you see this file, please update to BitComet 0.85 or above____""

How can i repair the broken files by incorporating the padding files?
Cheers in advance"
