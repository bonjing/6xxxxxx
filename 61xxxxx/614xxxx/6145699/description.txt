Glasgow, 1973. On the brink of adolescence, young John McGill is about to start secondary school. He is a bright and sensitive boy, eager to learn, but the cards are stacked against him. The McGill family is working class. His hated father is a drunken bully. His teachers â€“ punishing John for the â€˜sinsâ€˜ of his older brother Benny â€“ are down on him from the start. John is on his own.

And then there are the gangs. The NEDS â€“ Nonâ€“Educated Delinquents. The bad boys with weapons and attitude: cheap drugs, glam rock, fumbling sex, the violence and the camaraderie of the streets. Local monsters. Local heroes. Bennyâ€˜s fearsome reputation buys John protection, and then a way in. Scared, resentful, full of rage, John makes his decision. If no one else will give him a chance: f!*& them.

John takes to the savage life of the streets with a vengeance. But as his rage and frustration spin him further and further out of control, he is left facing a blank wall. No future. With one extraordinary chance of redemption.
