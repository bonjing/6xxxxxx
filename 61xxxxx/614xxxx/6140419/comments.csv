Good job!
I downloaded, this, watched it, and was not bothered by bad audio,Video, Codec problems, or Virus problems.

Thumbs up!

Arrr, Haaarrr, harrrr!"
,DawgedOut,2011-02-28T15:34Z,Can anyone tell me why after the download when I play this movie back I can't get any sound? I am new to this and think I didn't do something right. I have deleted the file and redownloaded twice!
