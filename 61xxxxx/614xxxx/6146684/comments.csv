,burt007,2011-02-04T08:42Z,"Thanks, but that is not the same book. I am looking for c not c++. But thanks for the suggestion senbas."
,moar55,2011-03-18T12:02Z,thx alot the book sounds awesome and i think it will be very helpful
,RottOrang,2011-04-07T20:46Z,"I think this is fake. 

The torrent contains a 
.zip, which contains an apparently identical zip, and so on. "
,DarkSydeKlyde,2011-04-24T03:41Z,This torrent is not fake. If you dig deep enough (keep extracting the .zips) you will get the full .pdf file. I can't comment as to whether this is virus free as I am a Linux user with no AV installed but the book is definitely there. Thanks uploader!
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-10-19T01:49Z,"The book is there and fine, although the facts that it is inside of a zip file withing a zip file is stupid, but its probably just a mistake the upper made when creating the torrent. "
