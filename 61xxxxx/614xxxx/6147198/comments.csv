PS: I can see in the title its 1080p, I'm not retarded, but it's still nice to make sure ;D"
,3lionsteam,2011-04-10T17:55Z,"i gotta say i found the video kinda GRAINY.  

Width                            : 1 920 pixels
Height                           : 818 pixels
isnt that supposed to be?
W:  1 920
H:  1080

or is a litlte grainyness just what u get when u change the blue ray file from its original 30 something gigs to these smaller .MKV files?"
[T],ILPruny,2011-04-24T15:46Z,"IS 1080p with 2,35 AR. so divide 1920 to that."
,snaketus,2011-10-08T00:47Z,It's 1080p. 1920x1080 is 16:9 resolution. This movie is 2.35:1 so it's not 16:9 do the math and you get the resolution of 1920x818. So yes it is 1080p full hd. But now the thing what I have been wondering with these 1080p NL sub uploads. Why only NL subs? What's the point remove everything else? They do NOT take that much space. Considering you are about to download 8 gb anyways. What's the problem with one mb of subtitles?
