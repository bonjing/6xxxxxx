Art of Fucking

aka: Evolution of Man


Following a request from \"big sexy\" himself, sharing this to help men like myself and others that want to better themselves in this aspect of life.

AoF (Art of Fucking) is a 2 day seminar, of about 8 hours a per day. Run by the guys at LVO3. This was Sean Messenger\'s love and relationship company focused on transforming men into their better selves.

Basically the seminar works on getting in touch with your masculine self, getting in touch with your body, excercises to achieve this, and how to turn sex as you know it into a transformational experience between you and your lover. Regardless if you want to find a single special someone, or have a handful of girlfriends.

Please seed this. This is probably not going to be as available as much, so please pull your weight and let this amazing seminar be available to the world as much as you can.
