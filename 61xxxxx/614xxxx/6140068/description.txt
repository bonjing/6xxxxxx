Capcom Classics Collection Remixed is a very classy compilation that gives you the chance to check out some of the company's strong arcade roots. And these roots go beyond the obvious choices, like the Street Fighter II games. With quirky, interesting games like Speed Rumbler and Varth in the collection, you might even uncover a few games that you missed the first time around.
