The Asphalt Jungle (1950) B & W

Director: John Huston

John Huston was a filmmaker of quite exceptional ability. A versatile talent, he turned his hand to a wide range of subjects and concerns. Over the years his work has received massive critical and commercial approval. Among his cinematic triumphs are The Maltese Falcon, The African Queen and The Misfits. To this list can be justifiably added his 1950 thriller, The Asphalt Jungle.

The film concentrates on the (largely unsympathetic) characters involved in a large-scale diamond heist. Heading the cast is Sam Jaffe, playing a high class German jewel thief recently out of prison. He has an apparently fool-proof plan for a robbery. Five assorted individuals soon join forces with him to fulfil his dream. Nothing can go wrong, can it?

The Asphalt Jungle is a very well constructed film. Tension builds minute by minute. The characters (principal and secondary) are well drawn and strongly delineated. The ensemble acting is terrific. The superlative cast includes such stalwart character actors as Steriing Hayden, Loius Calhern and James Whitmore. The director uses the camera remarkably assuredly, creating a tense atmosphere which perfectly complements the nature of the plot. Watch out for a young Marlyn Monroe as Calhern's mistress! 

In 2008, The Asphalt Jungle was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
