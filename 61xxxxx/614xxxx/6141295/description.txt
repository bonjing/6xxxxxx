Description:

Undeniably the quintessential observer of the human condition, best-selling Morris casts his discerning eye upon the feminine form in this top to toe tour of all things female in a continuation of the inquiry he began with the seminal The Naked Ape (1967). Scrutinizing everything from hair to feet, Morris explores the evolutionary, cultural, and biological traits and tendencies that have caused woman to become the creature she is today. Morris is positively giddy with admiration for his subject, stating that the human female is far more advanced than her male counterpart, the result of evolutionary developments that make her the most remarkable organism on the planet. And yet, Morris avers, woman has not come far enough at least in some global cultures, where male domination runs counter to human biological imperative. Thus, each chapter, which correlates to body parts as subtle as the brow and as expected as the breasts, examines how each characteristic has been shaped by social authority. Always entertaining, Morris takes a complex subject and cogently dissects it in fine detail for a critically enlightening experience.
