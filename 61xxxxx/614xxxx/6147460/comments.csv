,Kb1325,2011-02-14T00:19Z,"Very nice quality... resolution is good too.  And the movie is good as well, lol. 
I don't know if you take requests or not, but I have a couple if you wouldn't mind taking into consideration:

Rising Sun 1993 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107969/
There is a copy on TPB that I downloaded. It doesn't have English subtitles for the Japanese parts though.. Good movie too.

The Mask Of Zorro 1998 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120746/
Good adventure/action film starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins & Catherine Zeta-Jones. Would be a good one to add. 
There is a copy on TPB that I can download if you don't want to do it. Just wondering if I can get it in your quality.

The Mighty Quinn 1989 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097880/
Pretty good, it won't be a disappointment. There is a copy of it on TPB but it has Swedish subtitles...

Major Payne 1999"

,stluniverse,2012-05-07T03:44Z,for some reason my copy was fine until halfway through the movie suddenly sub titles came on & wouldnt go off...i know someone will probably respond to this about what an idiot i am because it didnt do it to them or some reason or another but i'm just giving my feedback
