,chaoshon,2011-02-19T19:13Z,"Sorry for being a bit of a newbie, but how do i install? I've downloaded the files that jackblues gave (thanks, btw), but I can't figure out how to install. What should I do with the BGL files in the original rar? What should I do with the files jackblues gave?

Thanks!"
,chaoshon,2011-02-19T19:17Z,"jakeblues*

Another thing.. When I select the destination for the exe file, should I select the FSX folder, or any place I like?"
,chaoshon,2011-02-19T19:42Z,"My problems (which happen since I use win7 64bit):

1. There is no such destination: C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Administrator\Application Data\Microsoft\FSX, even though I can see hidden files.

The closet I've found is:
C:\Users\Chaoshon\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX
Is this correct?

2. After I reach the destination mentioned above, where should I add the lines written in the ""read me""? In the FSX.cfg file?

3. I've got a problem with the following line that I'm told to add:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\VistaMare\ViMaCoreX.dll 

Why? Well, everything I install to my FSX is located in: C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Games etc'.
So should I add the (x86)?

A HUGE THANK YOU will be given free to whoever helps me lol."
