eventually do it yourself if you can - you even did not manage to upload a SINGLE torrent.
I'd vote such leeches and parasites off here obviously.

The content is important not the form, and if you do not have what you like, you like what you have. Learn a little bit of history and stop bullshitting! "

,DragonKP,2011-02-07T12:23Z,OK - I will mark it next time clearly in description.
,MitziKatz,2011-02-09T21:15Z,"Audio quality is acceptable.
Some people will enjoy, some might not...
thanx for upload!"
,DragonKP,2011-02-25T22:21Z,"Thanks for a kind word :-)
My main goal is to allow knowledge to be disseminated more easily, and because people are rather lazy this days, the audio book is a kind of solution.
Content is important - and they figured out some stuff long time ago, but people are not listening nor even hearing !!!"
