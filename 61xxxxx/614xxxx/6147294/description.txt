WarLord och HellVomit was the two freaks behind this project that was alive around 1993-1997. Songs were recorded but never really released as a whole to the public now to be found on the internet is a best of thing reaching between 1994-1996 with various songs to listen to.
Also their, at least from what people know, last recording Virgins, Beer And Anguish can be found online in some peoples shares.

Its shitty as hell, angry as hell, and with lyrics your mom wouldnâ€™t wanna hearâ€¦

style of music is best described as hardcore punk/black metal, death metal and grindcoreâ€¦

There isnâ€™t much more to say about this band. They hailed from the dark forests of Sweden but noone really knows who they were! Sources claims they were from somwhere in VÃ¤rmland, Sweden but thatâ€™s not 100% certain.

This is the last known recording of this band that is known.
It contains 7 songs of shitty, fast, brutal, insane music!
