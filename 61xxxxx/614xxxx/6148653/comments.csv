But could you please use something else than rutorrent to create your torrents?
Every single torrent you make is faulty.
Really annoying!

The bug in rutorrent is mentioned here:

no other client available.
Budget seedbox so yea.

Sorry bout that tho, i see how it would be annoying.

If i can get enough money for a better seedbox then i'll switch to one with more clients, but for the next few days, this is what i have."

[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-04T09:38Z,"@anglaport

Nobody does them often so i'm filling in."
