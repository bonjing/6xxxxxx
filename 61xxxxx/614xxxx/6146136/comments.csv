[T],raidy,2012-03-28T04:36Z,"Hi cluder12.  Sorry you don't like the rip. I checked, and you've *never* shared a single torrent with us. As this one is fucked up in your opinion, why don't you share an uncensored copy?"
[T],raidy,2012-03-28T04:45Z,Update: We're going to re-rip and re-issue this. While it came from amazon (as most of our stuff does) it may be a censored version. Our apologies for the mishap. We don't intentionally release censored or non-retail albums (unfinished) We'll leave this one up for those who are seeding it.
