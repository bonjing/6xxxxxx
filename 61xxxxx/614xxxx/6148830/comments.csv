,frijolito,2011-02-25T00:20Z,"From IMDB: ""The little dialogue (mainly in French and Gaelic; I don't understand either) is pretty easy to follow, but during the end of the film I was left cold when I misunderstood small phrases."""

,Owen_L,2011-02-27T21:06Z,"This animated film uses an old script by ""Jacques Tati"" well known as a writer/director/actor in his more or less wordless comedies from the 30:s and forward.
This is ment to be in that tradition and if you find and use subtitles I don't think there's going to be a lot of them in the film. Mr Bean would be a modern example of that kind of storytelling."
,faizalum,2011-05-11T20:09Z,excellent quality! thanks! and for those wondering if u need english subtitles..no needed at all..it's meant to be understood by the visualization rather than than the monosyllabic dialogue..most of which is in english already.
