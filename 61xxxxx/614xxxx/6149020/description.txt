RockMelt is a proprietary social media web browser developed by Tim Howes and Eric Vishria. The project is backed by Netscape founder Marc Andreessen[1]. RockMelt integrates a unique technique for surfing the web that focuses on Google Search and Social Media, in particular Facebook and Twitter[2]. The browser launched in private beta on November 8, 2010[3]; in order to download it, users are required to connect their facebook account to the website to receive an invitation email[4], RockMelt supports Windows and Mac OS X platforms.
RockMelt is based on Google's open-source project Chromium, a cross-platform family of browsers (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) that use the open-source web layout engine WebKit[5]â€”jointly built by Apple, Google and the open-source communityâ€”but have the JavaScript engine replaced by Google's own V8, also open-source. Version 3+ of Flock, an older social web browser project and therefore a primary competitor to Rockmelt, is also based on Chromium.
