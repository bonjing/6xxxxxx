KORS Orcas Island is the third airport for Orbx Pacific Northwest by well-established development team
Andreas Hegi and Heiko Glatthorn, whose previous collaborations include the acclaimed YHBA Hervey Bay
Airport in 2009 and 1S2 Darrington Muni and 3W5 Concrete Muni Airports in 2010. These two talented
developers have gained a reputation for creating charming GA airports with real character, and they always
strive to add those extra touches with every new project they deliver. KORS is no exception to that rule,
offering a rich audio visual experience in a unique island setting. SEED!
