High-strung father-to-be Peter Highman is forced to hitch a ride with aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay on a road trip in order to make it to his child's birth on time. 
Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) must get to LA in five days to be at the birth of his firstborn. He is about to fly home from Atlanta when he is arrested by the Air Marshall, and he is put on the "no-fly" list. With no luggage, money, and ID, Peter has really hit rock bottom. Desperate to get home Peter is forced to accept the offer of Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) to hitch a ride with him cross-country to Hollywood. For the next several days, Peter is going to regret his decision, because he will be harassed by endless personal questions from Ethan and embarrassed by Ethan's comic antics and offensive behavior. Peter is about to have the most terrifying and agonizing journey of his life.
