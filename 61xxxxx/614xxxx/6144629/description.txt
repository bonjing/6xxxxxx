A B O U T
=========
NightSky is an action-puzzle game that provides players with an ambient gameplay experience where cerebral challenges fill uniquely designed, picturesque worlds. Each of these worlds is broken into different areas in which the player must manoeuvre a mysterious crystal sphere by using realistic physics to advance. There are no enemies, no bosses and no violence in NightSky. An intuitive experience, NightSky is friendly for casual and mainstream gamers alike. It also offers a formidable challenge for hardcore players, with an unlockable Master mode. The original soundtrack by experimental jazz musician, Chris Schlarb will further heighten the surreal experience.

CLOSING COMMENTS
================
NightSky is a nice place to visit. The physics-based gameplay is clever, but the real draws are the beautiful scenery and the ambient electronic soundtrack. It's recognizable at a glance, which isn't something that can be said for every game.
