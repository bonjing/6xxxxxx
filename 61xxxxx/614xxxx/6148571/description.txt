This is a collection of Kurt Vonnegut novels formatted for Kindle that I've been gathering over the past year.  A few are my own personal fixes of shoddy epubs that have been out there for a while. Contents are as follows:

Bluebeard
Breakfast of Champions
Cat's Cradle
Deadeye Dick
Galapagos
God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater
Hocus Pocus
Mother Night
Player Piano
The Sirens of Titan
Slaughterhouse-five, or The Children's Crusade
