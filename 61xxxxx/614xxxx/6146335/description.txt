From the Everything Louder Tour to promote the Bat Out of Hell 2 album this is a great concert from Toronto, Canada. Meat Loaf is in great shape as he performs the greatest hits of both Bat cd's. This is an audience recording of the show and although the sound is good the picture quality is common for a 1993 video recording. The Position of the camera is pretty good and gives a view from the center of the stage
