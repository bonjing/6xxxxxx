,CalumMc,2011-02-01T22:04Z,Many thanks for this however there is a good 20 mins of crucial video missing the film skips a few scenes and makes it hard to understand
,Phatfish,2011-02-13T16:52Z,"A/V - Great. Especially for being a screener.

M - Well, first I thought it was just me being way too stoned but then I read the info and comments.

Obviously crucial material is missing from the movie. It's pretty butchered or/and scrambled.

However if you where not planning on see this movie anyway and have nothing better to do its watchable.  Otherwise I would wait for I movie that makes more sense. "
