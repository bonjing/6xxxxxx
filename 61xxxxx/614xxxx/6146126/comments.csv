I already have all these insinuendo, but thanks for a great share...... it's nice to have them all in one place!"

,Tiazi,2011-02-06T21:54Z,thanks for this torrent man. One of the best bands I know. Radiohead moves me :)
[T],rjordan21,2011-02-08T03:43Z,"-13....... ?  I don't understand.  Is this a poor recording? (I doubt it if insinuendo posted it)..... very silly.

OR,  someone enlighten me as to why this torrent should be negatively rated..... please.

7 albums.....in one shot.  Come on."
