Review

by Andy Kellman

This simple, attractive, reasonably priced box set (issued in the U.K.) houses 1993's Pablo Honey, 1995's The Bends, 1997's OK Computer, 2000's Kid A, 2001's Amnesiac and I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, and 2003's Hail to the Thief -- each full-length Radiohead release on Parlophone. (The label released the box, marketed as "limited edition," between Radiohead's pick-your-price download and physical release of In Rainbows.) Each disc is in its own sturdy, foldout digipack sleeve, containing the original artwork in full, and they fit into a black sheath that slides snugly into a white box. No remastering took place with any of the recordings.
