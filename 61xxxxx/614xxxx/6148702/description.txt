Steps of installation:
1. Turn off internet connnection
2. Install from setup.exe, name doesn\'t matter, and serial is as follows: two capital letters then five random numbers, ex: SC54321
3. turn off uptodate then go to the following directory: \"C:\\Users\\[yourname]\\UpToDate\\app\" then open \"param.xml\" using your notepad, then change SC54321 to SC54320 (i.e. keep changing the number randomly, a good method is to change the last number only 0-9 \"excluding 1 in our example\")
4. run uptodate, and press \"activate\", if it doesn\'t work, try to activate again till it works or \"3-attempt\" message shows. in the latter case, go back to step 3, otherwise ENJOY!
5. Still not working? uninstall and reinstall using other 2 Capital letters (ex. RE45321)

DISCLAIMER:
* I claim no credit for this, I just want to share it!
* There\'s a high possibility that you may fail to install uptodate!!
* a patch for 18.1 is out there and could work for this version as well (or so they claim), but the method above worked for me.
* This file has been compressed to .rar file using \"normal\" mode, if you already have uptodate, please compress and seed!
