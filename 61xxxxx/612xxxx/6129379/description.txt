In the early Fifties, Zuzu Bollin, a journeyman jump-blues singer-guitarist from Dallas, cut four superb sides for the tiny Torch label before fading away. Despite a deep, charcoal voice and a guitar style that, at times, echoed the poetic precision of T-Bone Walker, Bollin was somehow forgotten by all but the most avid blues collectors. That changed, however, in 1987 when it was discovered that Bollin was still living in the Big D and anxious to return to the blues after a thirty-five-year hiatus.

The propitious find led to a recording session and the local, vinyl-only release of Bollin's first-ever album, Texas Bluesman, in 1989. But Bollin's comeback was short-lived; he died in 1990 before he had the chance to resuscitate both his career and a big-band blues sound that had disappeared in the Sixties.
