Deterioration of soils and aquifers has become evident in the last few
years as a result of inappropriate final disposal procedures for all
sorts of waste materials. Oil exploitation, uncontrolled fuel spills, popractices for final disposal of industrial wastes, overuse of pesticides,
and operation of sanitary landfills are some causes of pollution of
soils and groundwaters.

In the course of the last two decades a wide variety of technologies
has been developed for clean-up operations of contaminated soils and
aquifers. They can be classified in terms of their principle of operation:
physicochemical, thermal and biological. Among the biological
technologies bioremediation has evolved as the most promising one
because of its economical, safety and environmental features since
organic contaminants become actually transformed, and some of them
are fully mineralized.

The success of bioremediation techniques is directly related to
the metabolic capability of involved microorganisms and can be affected
by the surrounding microenvironment. This chapter describes the
mechanism of bioremediation; an overview is presented of its virtues
and weaknesses
