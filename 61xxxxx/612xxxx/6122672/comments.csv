,eXon_,2011-01-25T02:22Z,I hope there will be a HQ version of Star Trek TNG...
,sammygm,2011-01-25T03:58Z,@eXon I think he already made all TNG Seasons in HQ
[V],meech,2011-01-25T13:11Z,"@exon:
Yes, I've already uploaded Star Trek Next Generation.  That was my first upload.  Just click on my user name in the Torrent Header (or click here: http://thepiratebay.org/user/Meech) to see my other torrents.  TNG is on page 2."
,Duder82,2011-01-26T14:47Z,"Thanks man.

What application are you using to rip these, btw? And what kind of settings exactly, if you don't mind me asking.
I've been meaning to rip some DVD's as well, but don't really have any idea what's good and perhaps easy to use."

Sorry haven't gotten back to you yet.  Life has been busy lately.  I will send you a message through piratebay with the information about encoding settings.  It would take up too much space to do it here through a comment.  Will try to get back to you before the weekend is up."
,Duder82,2011-01-28T20:39Z,"That's cool, no hurries.

I'm mainly looking to just reclaim a lot of shelf real estate by ripping the DVD's and stashing them in storage somewhere."
,unbreak11,2011-01-29T21:09Z,"Hello...

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE!!!
I had been looking all over the place for good quality videos of star trek.. 
Can you please finish the season 7 of voyager? LOL im watching the season 6 and almost done with that...

also, do you have any intent of doing star trek enterprise in this high quality too?

THANK YOU AGAIN!"
,eXon_,2011-01-30T01:09Z,Thanks man! I had no idea that you had ripped TNG already and I also found an old favorite of mine Space above and Beyond... Big thanks for all these series I enjoy so much!

I can't seem to get into my piratebay forum account.  So I will post here.  Sorry to others for taking up so much space in a comment.

I use a great free program called Handbrake.  It is powerful, but also one of the easier encoders to use.  They update it usually on a daily basis with ""nightly"" releases.  The settings I use are listed below in the next comment. Note: these settings are very high and may take your computer a long time to encode if you don't have a powerful computer.  My i7 takes almost 2 hours for each 45 minute show (2-pass encode).  The settings can be adjusted to speed things up a little bit.  I would do some research on their website as to what settings affect encode speed vs. quality.  There is a lot of info there.  Some of the settings, in particular target size or RF value (for constant quality setting) can take some trial and error.  I usually start by doing a constant quality RF (read up on what that means) of 18.5 for movies and for the first couple episodes of a series I'm ripping to see what size 18.5 gives me.  Let me know if you have any other questions."

,SwedishMeatball,2011-10-17T17:27Z,"Meech: 
Thank you for the wonderful torrents. I have only watched the first episode and it is awesome. Keep doing single season torrents, it makes life much easier. However, might you be able to do a torrent of the extras for the entire series?

Downloaders:
My first few downloads, I was concerned about exceeding my data allocations or slowing the downloads by using uploading for the available bandwidth. I set the uploads to 1kb/sec max.

I found out that my provider wasn't going to slow down or stop my internet access and that it did not affect my downloading speeds. So, I opened the uploads up fully. 

The other side of this is that I have noticed a huge percentage of leechers. I am seeding everything that I have downloaded, until I reach at least 2/1 ratio. Please give back to the community! Trek attitude says to give as much as you can, because it makes you a better person!

My uploads are set to unlimited, most of the time, on torrents I have completed.

The ones I am still downloading, I am throttling the upload back, if my download speed is less than my upload speed. So, if you are downloading this torrent, set the upload limits to 0 (zero) so they are unlimited! I will respond in kind!"
