SYNOPSIS

Seeds follows a circle of young Tibetan friends on the eve of the controversial 
Olympic torch relay 2008 in New Delhi over a span of one day. It focuses on six 
characters caught in their own midst. A rebel, who doesn't have much of an ambition 
and prefers following his friends. An escapist, whose only dream is to flee India 
and find a better life in America. A hesitant, who beside his call center job that 
pays off his living, is desperately looking for a change. A patriot with a strong 
traditional mindset who can't stand his younger sister being an extrovert. Yet his 
sister, a dreamer, sees her life bigger than reality and shares it with her 
friend who on the other hand fears to have destroyed her life and doesn't see 
any future for herself.

The film describes the frustration of the Tibetan youth living with the 
responsibility of freeing their country yet caught in an attempt to catch up 
with the modern world.
