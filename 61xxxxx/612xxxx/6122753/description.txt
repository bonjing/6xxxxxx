Delivered with a voice that silently, slowly creeps in on you, Steady On is not 

that noted when it comes to listing the best folk rock albums. It should be 

there, somewhere. Yes, Shawn Colvin's debut lacks the whispery seriousness 

of Suzanne Vega's early works but she's a marvelous lyricist and the songs here 

straddle the line between folk and pop and a little country. "Ricochet in time" 

is piercingly emotional. The title track is bracing in its affirmation.
