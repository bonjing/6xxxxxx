Putting ""axxo"" is like stamping it with a guarantee."
,arthoheen,2011-02-13T15:19Z,"TvTeam has a green pirate symbol by it's name, so what's the use of fake-using axxo's name?"
,anjumrajkhan,2011-03-05T06:16Z,"so how do u people know that  they r using fake ""aXXo""???"
,dredeuce86,2011-03-10T08:19Z,Why fake to be someone else????  Build your own legacy!!!

,redactedwv,2011-03-23T22:02Z,"[aggressivesarcasm]Golly gee whiz, @ caroltimmings - Your conversational tone assures me that you're not some vile spammer trolling the thread for your own gain! So friendly! So natural! Gosh, your selflessness is truly inspiring... Trying to 'save everyone's time' with your CLEARLY community-minded link. [/aggressivesarcasm]

Hyuck hyuck) But seriously, caroltimmings - I hope spontaneously combust in the very near future.

Been looking, but to no avail - anyone come across any eng subs?

Thx for the up, TvTeam - sincerely appreciated."
,redactedwv,2011-03-24T04:26Z,"BTW - I consider myself to be fairly picky quality-wise, and imo this doesn't deserve the pair of 7's it received above. It's at least a 9/9, probably by most standards a 10/10. Credits are clear and defined. So...to split the diff i'll go with:

a/9.5
v/9.5"
,cujo31ne,2011-03-29T23:05Z,"Great rip, no problems, thanks a lot!"
,chrisyeCollieroz4,2011-04-02T00:19Z,quite slow which is wierd because axxo torrents are usually fast went to idvdrip.info to see it in the end
,azrealdivine,2011-04-09T05:44Z,please i have to get Cowboys and Indians: The J.J. Harper Story n some native movies please i pray to the pirate gods
,coheedvscambria,2011-04-20T08:00Z,"aXXo no longer posts any torrents and anyone using that name is a liar.. aXXo stopped uploading many years ago... go to wikipedia and search ""aXXo""."

,greenbottle,2011-05-19T05:04Z,This is one the best Australian movies I have ever seen.
,stiffrichard,2011-07-09T23:59Z,axxo was assassinated 12 years ago.  no but seriously the axxo wiki says some shit about axxo taking down every torrent he had uploaded to thepiratebay.org so they are all fake apparently.  of course it would be in the movie industries best interest to make us believe this. or actually even just pay off axxo a few million. supposedly 33 percent of all downloaded movies were axxo downloads so it would save them a couple billion probably!
