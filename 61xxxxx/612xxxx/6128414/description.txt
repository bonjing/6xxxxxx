The princess of a demon kingdom called Evuu, Aspacia, is a cute 15-year-old
girl. Suddenly one day, she became unable to use magic. Her father, the king,
said, "Ah, that. It must be because your mother was human!"

Her father tells her that to regain her power, Aspacia must gather the power
that grants the wishes of humans.

After two months of travel, she arrives in a desert kingdom.
