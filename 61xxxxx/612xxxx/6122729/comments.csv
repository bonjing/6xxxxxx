First time I get a consolaatope's PS3 gme that doesn't run. PS3 says I must have 3.5 FW.
I have the 3.41 and am looking for a possible eboot.bin in order to fool the machine and play the game.
I use JB and Gaia 1.04 and Backup Manager, and all has worked so far.
Thanks for the upload, I shall share if I find any eboot.bin that works here."
,S111or,2011-01-31T22:02Z,"OK. eboot found.
I have replaced the original file ( after backing it up om my pc) and the game with OFW 3.41, jailbreak and form an external drive I had the game running.
It shall ask if one accepts PS3 to force the PARAM.SFO file.
Accept.
OK.
Amazing game, by the way, just like the first."
