The highest ranking by a female singer/songwriter on RollingStone 500 Greatest Albums of all Time is #30... and this is the album. Blue deserves every accolade hoisted upon it. Had this been Mitchell's only album (and hallelujah it isnâ€™t), induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame would have been assured. More importantly, through Blue, the emotions and honesty of Mitchell the singer, the writer and the musician are indelibly written on the soul of anyone who listens with an open heart. If you donâ€™t have this album, or if you do but donâ€™t get it, you desperately need to.
