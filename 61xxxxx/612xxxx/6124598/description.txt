Charlie (Keitel) is an Italian-American man who is trying to move up in the local mafia and who is hampered by his feeling of responsibility towards his childish and destructive friend Johnny Boy (De Niro). Charlie works for his uncle Giovanni (who is the local mafia caporegime), mostly collecting debts. He is also having a hidden affair with Johnny Boy's cousin, Teresa, who has epilepsy and is ostracized because of her condition - especially by Charlie's uncle. A major figure in the plot is the conflict between Charlie's devout Catholicism and his Mafia ambitions. As the film progresses, Johnny becomes increasingly self-destructive and disrespects his creditors more and more. Unable to feel redeemed by his actions in church, Charlie finds redemption through self-sacrifice on Johnny's behalf, long after it ceases to be reasonable or deserved.
