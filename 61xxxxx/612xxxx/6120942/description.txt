INSPECT ANY HOME INSIDE AND OUT--WITH HELP FROM AN EXPERT!

Written by a professional home inspector and fully updated throughout, The Complete Book of Home Inspection, Fourth Edition, shows you how to determine exactly what's behind, beneath, above, and around a house before you make an offer. If you're selling your home, you'll learn how to accurately evaluate its condition prior to setting a price.
