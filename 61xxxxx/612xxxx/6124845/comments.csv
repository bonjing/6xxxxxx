,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-01-24T20:39Z,"OOO, i downloaded a good program from this sight called DVD-FAB, its the dogs balls for ripping the .VOB from a copy protected dvd, worked far better than dvd-decryptor & dvd-shrink, i highly recommend it!!! 

Another nice upload btw  ;o)"
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-01-24T20:47Z,"Just search ""dvd fab"" in the 'windows-applications' section, and then download a program called 'Handbreak' both these programs together will give the same top quality results as OOO, i will write a step by step guide if anyone needs it..."
,sgrrock,2011-01-24T22:44Z,can u get the sopranos thanks.
,defeatedsanity,2011-01-25T04:23Z,"Thanks 3xO, you are an incredible uploader!

@sgrrock: The Sopranos would rock! Easily one of the best television shows of all time, But lets be honest, The entire Sopranos collection is over 35 gb and would take an eternity to convert.

And OOO, I know pink skull, blue skull, black skull, whatever color probably doesn't mean a whole hell of alot, But nobody deserves a green skull more than you do for all your contributions. Please keep it up and Thank You!"

They end up being 550 mb. I know that isn't normal. Can you tell me the steps you take. or make that video you told everyone you were going to make."
