 I received this about ten years ago back in my â€œtape tradingâ€ days.  I will forewarn you, it is not very good quality visually but the audio isn\'t too bad.  When I received it, all I got was a dvd that said, 
â€œGrand Funk Live @ Madison Square Garden 
Grand Funk: Live In Japanâ€ so I\'m not extremely sure where it is from and exactly what is on it.  I think I\'ve narrowed the first part down being from this:

The second part is labeled â€œLive In Japanâ€ and I cannot find anything on this part anywhere.  Technically speaking, the video quality is much better than the first part (although I prefer the earlier stuff and their clothing is rather flamboyant in Japan).

I split it up into 2 mkv files for easy viewing but I can upload an iso or DVDRip if enough people ask for it.
