One, I stated in the description (that somehow got jumbled up) that A/V are not amazing.  Which leads me to two; please point me to a Grand Funk dvd that is better.  I've searched up and down and can't find anything that the band has released which is why I was excited when I found this.

I guess you could say this is for the Grand Funk enthusiast or someone that has never seen a video of the band live."
