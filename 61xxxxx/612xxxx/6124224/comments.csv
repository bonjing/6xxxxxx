Cheers ... Have fun !"
[V],globeplus,2011-01-24T13:07Z,"To the possible interested users that have doubts i have the next thing to say :  if you check other torrents you will find 4.35 gb iso files for this game and the same iso you get on that files , it is what you get on this one then you can ask me : with this size ? Right ! because it is compressed and the file have instructions for in few minutes the iso be ready to a real WII or just start play immediatly on the emulator ."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-24T13:33Z,"Beside the only few minutes to have the complete iso ready to the WII , it is possible to use the RegionFrii to change to NTSC if that it is a problem , i repeat the same iso that is getted on the 4.35 gb iso files , it is what the user get on this one ."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-24T14:17Z,"I know that what will say now can sound a little healthy crazy but it is the next thing : the difference between this game file and the other files for this game is more than 4 gb beside that it is exact the same thing : why ? because the wii dvd really need 4.37 gb iso to be burned but the real size of the game can change depending on the game , this game is about 400 mb but because i make a compression i get the 290 mb and after 5 to 10 minutes decompression the user get exactly the same iso on the 4.35 gb iso files and this is true ."

[V],globeplus,2011-01-24T18:48Z,"To bfpg8989 : thank you and i donĂÂ´t mind to spent another comment , in the way that i wanted the possible users get the correct feeling about the file , anyway , we are talking about a 4.35 gb game file that can be getted in absolute normal way and complete without anything touched for 290 mb , i realise that the game maybe not recent as that but still a nice adventure entertaining game for the wii and i got the game and saw that on the emulator was ok too then find out that the game itself it is close 400mb (290 mb with compression) , so it was evident that just a compressed file do the trick and to decompress that it is easy to do with the emulator is between 5 to 10 minutes to get a full 4.37 gb iso to be burned to a disc for a real wii , so the users can reflect a moment and ask after seeing the size of the file : this is the full game with everything ok , only 290 mb ? and the answer is yes it is because independtly of the wii isos need to have 4.37 gb , the games itselfs can have less than that and on this case much less but still a nice adventure game , i remember as an example the pokemons for the NDS where the users get big adventures in playing time and that for only 128 mb generaly speaking , so close 400 mb for a wii game still some size anyway ."
