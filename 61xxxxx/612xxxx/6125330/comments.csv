,Phatfish,2011-01-27T06:15Z,"A/V - Good

M - Well the story in it self is obviously EPIC but as far as movie goes it was actually surprisingly good as well. British flicks are (for some reason) usually not very well put together but this works well, probably due to absolutely excellent acting from all parts. 

DO watch it!

Thanks 4 the up!"

,jamestheinsider,2011-01-28T18:40Z,"As a follow up...

Great Rip - V10 A9

But either watch the film, or read the book - Don't do both! You may be as dissapointed as I was!

IMHO"
