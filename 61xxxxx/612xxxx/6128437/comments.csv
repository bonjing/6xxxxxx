,bijoy_s,2011-01-27T17:08Z,"SAM PLS upload ""FASTER"" (2010) movie...Starring ""THE ROCK""

IMDB - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433108/"
,dlarrym1111,2011-01-28T04:50Z,"@bijoy_s - are you serious. . . .The ""ROCK"". . .  I never got the whole wrestling thing. The scary thing is the fan base!  It ranges from 12 yr old boys to 25 yr old males that are high-school and college dropouts. The real question is WHY on earth would a bunch of MEN want to watch other MEN that are super steroid monsters that get sweaty on a bunch of ""mats"" (as in mattresses LOL!!!!) in a ring and RUB there bodies all over each other.  VERY strange indeed.
@bijoy_s : why don't you upload your Dad's cock into his mouth and watch the dust fly!!! Yes dust. . . Your tounge is made of sandpaper and your Dads dick is made of wood, so dust is the result!!! LMFAO!!!!! You must admit, @bijoy_s, COME ON. . . you KNOW you set yourself up for that one. ""uploading"", and ""THE ROCK"" in one sentence, I couldn't help myself. Its only a joke, nothing personal. In fact if I leave myself open for a crack like that I will be fine with that, I am good sport!! EVRYONE, one, you must admit, that was funny!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-01-28T04:53Z,"OH. forgot to mention the movie.It is ok plot wise, and the quality is great v9/a9. . . as is All of SaM's uploads. thanks again SaM!!!"
