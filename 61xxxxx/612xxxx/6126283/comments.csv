,MyFootHurts,2011-01-31T23:08Z,The ability to make a file with the same video quality as one half the size is a testament to the strange choice of video codec.

,MajorRazor,2011-03-09T04:12Z,Thanks BlackSam. Downloaded today. Plays well. Great video. Clear sound. More power to you.
,UsedDildo,2011-03-13T02:01Z,"Very good video and audio quality, however every 10 minutes the words ""property of the weinstein company - do not duplicate"" (in upper case) appears at the top of the screen for 15 seconds. The words first appear at 0:10:00 then every 10 minutes until the last at 1:50:00.

Didn't stop me watching and enjoying the film, and certainly will not make me rush out and pay for a copy. It's just annoying so i'll keep downloading other torrents of this film until i find one without the words.

Thanks again to the uploader for this torrent, it is an excellent film."

Looks like it's had de-interlacing applied to it, erroneously."
