,JollyBlue,2011-02-22T01:40Z,"Question:  I have a 64-bit version of Win 7 Home edition.  I want to downgrade it to 32-bit and YES I know that means wiping my PC clean.  My question is, do you know if thats possible with this rip you have?  Any compadibility issues?  Also, can I get all the upgrades I need from microsoft?"
,Win7nerd,2011-02-22T03:58Z,"NO issues at all the boot from disc takes a bit but it has SP1 integrated, plus yes you can get updates from microshit lol :) "
,Exaskryz,2011-02-22T18:50Z,"A comp was total shit with all the crap I had installed on it, and decided to just wipe it. Snagged this for installing Win 7 Ultimate on it, and had no hiccups.

To anyone new to it, since this was my first time, obvious step to some, but burn the DVD and boot the comp you're installing it on from the DVD, not the HDD. The normal upgrading after you've logged in and stuff didn't work for me, said BIOS was incompatible with the upgrade.

Thanks Win7, great stuff. Will continue seeding this for a good while."
