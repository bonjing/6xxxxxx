PLOT:
The fight between mankind and his most powerful creation leads to a revelation with the power to alter the course of human history. 300 years ago, mankind created a new breed of being though genetic engineering. But we abused our creation, and in time it gained the will to fight back. After centuries of struggle, the descendents of that genetically engineered race, now known as the "Ghen," have gained the upper hand over their human adversaries. As mankind is forced into slavery on the surface of the Earth, the Ghen live comfortably in sprawling underground cities. And though a small pocket of human resistance fighters refuse to admit defeat, ambitious Ghen Crecilius Pryme politician pushes for the complete annihilation of the human race. When Pryme reveals a secret that's been buried for centuries, its powerful implications shake both races to their very core.
