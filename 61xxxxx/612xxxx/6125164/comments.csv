,darkbyke,2011-02-25T06:15Z,You need a CD to play 1.50.  The newest update to 1.51 is where you won't need CD. 
,killzonee12,2011-03-09T12:53Z,hey i need to put out the instal CD and then put it back in to play it but i dont have that CD so what am i need to do?
,napolien,2011-03-09T15:39Z,"Dude, does it works emulated on Daemon tools or I do need another emulation tool to make this go on ??
I tried several times and received the same message: ""Please inset game disc"".

I think we need more than a ""Warning"" here..."
,Hokrollo,2011-03-13T15:01Z,Completly dumbass uploader - this is freaking waste of time if you don't evne know yourself how to install.

I've never had a problem installing any game in my life tell now."
,Madorbaul,2011-03-15T03:04Z,i DID IT WOOT IT only took me all day
,frabato_01,2011-03-28T19:12Z,"I found a way to install it.
1- Copy entire folder ""Battlefield 2142 Razor"" somewhere on your disk
2- Open setup.ini in that folder with notepad and find line with CheckMD5=Y, replace Y with N, save changes.
3- create an empty file named Thumbs.db and copy it to these folders (the installer will stop with request for disc if the file Thumbs.db is not present at required locations, so you if you missed something you will see where that file is expected to be, so just put another copy of it where its needed)
--- Support\EA Help\WebHelp_Skin_Files\XP_Silver
---Support\European Help Files\* - put Thumbs.db into every single folder here
4- run setup.exe from the copied folder, proceed with installation as usuall

Good luck."
,_D3T0X_,2011-04-01T19:41Z,"guys, all you need to do is run the setup.exe file in the battlefield 2142 razer folder. go online and find a cd key and enter it. install the game. then open up the exe in the main folder and go through the patch, as well as the crack and profile thing. it should work."
,_D3T0X_,2011-04-01T21:14Z,"forget my previous comment above.

follow the instructions that frabato_01 gives. if you are unclear on how to make an empty file here's how:

1go to CMD (search for it in the start menu)
2right click on it and hit run as administrator
3type the following: fsutil file createnew C:\Users\\Desktop\Thumbs.db 1024
4go to your desktop and the file should be there. copy into the folders that are listed."
,lolmegod,2011-04-09T21:02Z,it won't make a empty file
,crimson85067,2011-04-13T01:25Z,u guys dont know how to mount a virtual disk???lol u ARE noobs
,Dime-420-Bag,2011-05-14T00:42Z,"how nice....got it to install from the razor setup, even found a txt file with serials in the 'doc' folder and after all that it just hangs at insert disk 1? what a fucking joke of a torrent"
,Tornadoxxx,2011-05-20T02:02Z,"Like i said ""Advanced Installation""  so it's NOT for Noobs !!! 

For that unforeseen error -> put all files on an .iso then mount and play "
,irfinity,2011-06-27T08:27Z,"Alll done with installation. The only reason I wanted this torrent is for patch 1.50 thought ther will be a crack to that too. But unfortunately just like before after I installed from this torrent too, I cant play the game after I install the patch. Any ideas? I pasted profiles and also the cracked file bt no use in the patch."
,irfinity,2011-06-27T09:41Z,"New problem. I Installed patch 1.5 as advised, installation successful, the game also runs but when I click on offline player razor1911 it just gives me the old maps :(( I need new maps pls help!!"
,ikie18,2011-08-12T17:07Z,"if you want change your name from razor1911 to yours then you must go to a file thats named profiles and open him with wordpad. 

delete razor1911 and put yours in.

i have done it ,,, now its my name"
,ikie18,2011-08-12T17:08Z,nice
,lottar,2011-09-25T03:03Z,Warning : This installation pack is NOT for noobs.... typical what noobs say... i say nuke this torrent and nuke Tornadoxxx
,himegoto,2011-12-20T00:51Z,"Im sorry to bust your balls but this torrent is bullshit. I've installed countless games and theres no real way to get this working. ""not for noobs"" my ass there isnt even a readme file present unless its again hiding somewhere not easily accessible. "
,kattwuver202a,2012-02-05T07:21Z,"im having a problem that i have with many games that i crack and then patch. as soon as i start the game it just blackscreens and gives me error message, i cant even get into the menu.it blackscreens as soon as i click on launch bf2142."
,alanko,2012-04-05T18:43Z,WTF? am bloody expert .. i ever see an arrogant person like Tornadoxxx... sorry i tried as advised by frabato_01.. but it ask me for bloody disc 1 when installing .. i did lots of patchs for EA games .. and i included self install .. for a cocky guy who claim this is for expert .. show me your balls and do a self installer or at least bloody put a description of what to do. what a waste of time downloading this $hit.. 
,alanko,2012-04-05T19:22Z,ur file is corrupt man .. this is why it ask for bloody disk1.. you Mr cocky arrogant .. am just using another download iso i have from another torrent and that will make me at least past stage 1 .. thanks for text of instruction i found inside folder called document  
,alanko,2012-04-05T20:10Z,not working .. start then crash .. did u just copy and past original Razor exe on 1.5 patched one !! the file size of patch one is 8mb urs is 6mb !! given that razor ever did one for 1.5 .. u just assumed it will work !! Mr Advanced installation my A**?
