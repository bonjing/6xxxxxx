Kenneth Clark "Kenny" Loggins (born January 7, 1948) is a Californian singer and songwriter known best for "soft rock" and "adult contemporary" music beginning during the 1970s. Originally a part of the duo Loggins and Messina, he became a solo artist and has written songs for other artists.

Loggins continued his career into the 1970s. After attracting the attention of fellow singer-songwriter Jim Messina, the two began a duo career as Loggins and Messina, which lasted until 1976. During 1977, Loggins produced his first solo album, Celebrate Me Home, which included the successful song "I Believe In Love", sung originally by Barbra Streisand in A Star Is Born. Nightwatch, a popular album released during 1978, included the smash "Whenever I Call You Friend", a duet with Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac, though co-written with Melissa Manchester. He followed it in 1979 with Keep the Fire.

Loggins also wrote the song "What A Fool Believes" with Michael McDonald. Each man recorded his own version of the song, with McDonald's recording his version as a member of The Doobie Brothers. Loggins's version was released first, but The Doobie Brothers' version achieved greater success, scoring #1 on the popular music charts. During 1980, Loggins and McDonald received a Grammy for Song of the Year for "What A Fool Believes".

During 1979, Loggins and McDonald wrote "This Is It" for Loggins' ailing father, who had to choose between life and death. The song earned Loggins a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal. NBC used the song as theme music for its coverage of the NCAA men's basketball tournament in 1980 and 1981.

During the next decade, Loggins recorded many successful songs for movie soundtracks beginning with "I'm Alright" (#7 in the U.S.), "Mr. Night", and "Lead the Way" from Caddyshack. Hits followed with "Footloose" and "I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man)" from Footloose; "Meet Me Halfway" from Over the Top; and "Danger Zone" and "Playing With the Boys" from Top Gun. Loggins also performed "Nobody's Fool" from the movie Caddyshack II. He also performed as a member of USA for Africa on the famine-relief fundraising single "We Are the World".

During the 1990s, Loggins continued his album career, including the popular 1994 children's album Return to Pooh Corner, which included the title single, a reworking of "House at Pooh Corner", written for his newborn son Luke.

During 1991, Loggins recorded and produced Leap of Faith, which included the single "Conviction of the Heart". Former vice president Al Gore billed this song as "the unofficial anthem of the environmental movement". 1993's "Leap of Faith Tour" included vocalist/guitarist Dick Smith. On Earth Day 1995, Loggins performed at The National Mall in Washington, D.C. before a live audience of 500,000.

During 1997, Loggins released the album "The Unimaginable Life" based on his book which was co-written by his wife Julia. Tracks include "Now That I Know Love", "The Art of Letting Go", and "One Chance at a Time". The album was produced by Loggins and Randy Jackson with background vocals by Skyler Jett, Lamont VanHook, and Howard Smith.

During 1998, Loggins recorded a version of the popular Sesame Street song "One Small Voice" for the ABC television special, Elmopalooza.

During recent years Loggins has continued to record and produce Adult Contemporary music and scored a #1 single on the Billboard AC chart during 1997 with "For The First Time" (his Oscar-nominated song from One Fine Day). His last movie song was The Tigger Movie song "Your Heart Will Lead You Home", which he co-wrote with Richard and Robert Sherman.

During 2005, JD Ryznar started web series Yacht Rock, in which Loggins appears played by Hunter Stair and shows Loggins' rise to fame. The show helped with the revival of Loggins' music.

During 2005, Loggins and Messina performed a successful nationwide tour that resulted in the CD and DVD Loggins and Messina Sittin' In Again.

During 2007 Loggins joined the new recording company 180 Music for the release of his How About Now album. That year he was also inducted into Hollywoodâ€™s Sunset Boulevard RockWalk.[2]

On July 31, 2008, Loggins appeared on the TV program Don't Forget the Lyrics! and performed "I'm Alright" and "Footloose".

In 2009 Loggins issued a new children's album entitled All Join In but it was delayed due to his summer tour with Jim Messina.
