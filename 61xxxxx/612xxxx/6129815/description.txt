Synopsis by reviews-

It\'s Jack\'s birthday, and he\'s excited about turning five. Jack lives with his Ma in Room, which has a locked door and a skylight, and measures 11 feet by 11 feet. He loves watching TV, and the cartoon characters he calls friends, but he knows that nothing he sees on screen is truly real - only him, Ma and the things in Room. Until the day Ma admits that there\'s a world outside ...Told in Jack\'s voice, \\\\\\\"Room\\\\\\\" is the story of a mother and son whose love lets them survive the impossible. Unsentimental and sometimes funny, devastating yet uplifting, \\\\\\\"Room\\\\\\\" is a novel like no other. \'Emma Donoghue\'s writing is superb alchemy, changing innocence into horror and horror into tenderness. \"Room\" is a book to read in one sitting. When it\'s over you look up: the world looks the same but you are somehow different and that feeling lingers for days\' - Audrey Niffenegger. 
\"Room\" is one of the most profoundly affecting books I\'ve read in a long time. Jack moved me greatly. His voice, his story, his innocence, his love for Ma combine to create something very unusual and, I think, something very important ...\"Room\" deserves to reach the widest possible audience - John Boyne. 
I loved \"Room\".Such incredible imagination, and dazzling use of language. And with all this, an entirely credible, endearing little boy. It\'s unlike anything I\'ve ever read before - Anita Shreve.
