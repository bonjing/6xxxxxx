,Erich505,2011-07-14T23:53Z,"You wont find subs for this flick anywhere. some of these jokers will talk about where you get subs for this movie, but they're spammers, and you'll have to sell your soul to get subs, i.e, join some club, get a password, and the providers seem suspect as hell. Be advised: No subs anywhere for this film. "
