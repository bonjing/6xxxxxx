,custard123,2011-01-25T14:41Z,"come on guys. the comments are uncalled for. yuo need to research why this occurs before commenting.
the file is still hd. the reason you are seeing 546 is that the black bar information has been removed from the file to keep the size down. the video is not 16:9 so that is why you see 546. it is still hd as the width is still 1280."

,jogomezz,2011-02-09T14:18Z,"For those complaining that this is 546, keep in mind that 1280 x 546 is 2.35:1, which is the CORRECT aspect ratio for movie screens."
,rastas959,2011-05-18T10:05Z,"To all that doubt, I believe that this is a 720p HD rip mainly cause SaM is a TRUSTED member of TPB which aint easy to obtain"
