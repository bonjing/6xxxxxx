The Personalysis theory developed by the Manatec Research institute
has long been obscured in political correctness in what is their
current jargon and euphemistic use of political correctness employed
to obfuscate the basic findings so as to deprive humans of the real
worth of this most important body of evidence as to what makes people
what they are individually and collectively too.

As a former Human Relations coach and Personalysis user, I am happy
to bring you this timely and most crucial document to what is our 
present situation on this planet that want for a better world than is
unfolding in the absence of this vital research in Social and
Humanistic Psychology from recent decades.

Read and determine why certain ideas of "multiculturalism" and all 
notions of "affirmative action" should be disallowed in your 
community on any basis at all!
