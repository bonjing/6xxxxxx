This is a really, really rare scan of a guitar lesson featured in a 1984 issue of Guitar Player. I haven't really found this anywhere else, so I thought i'd give you Ed-Heads a treat. This is a simple guitar lesson from the master himself, and a transcription of Eruption by Steve Vai. Enjoy!

Scanned by my guitar teacher.
