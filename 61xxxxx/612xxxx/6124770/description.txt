Much has been made of Micah P Hinsonâ€™s turbulent life. From teenage drug addiction, jail and homelessness, the Texan already had a reservoir of experience from which to draw the doleful country-folk songs of debut â€¦And The Gospel Of Progress. Four years and two further albums on, press interviews have shown him intent on losing his image as a reformed fuck-up, but astute enough to realise it makes a damn good backstory. 

With that in mind, itâ€™s tempting to read more into this new record. There appears, for instance, to be a recurring theme of letting go, while simultaneously questing for things he fears unattainable. â€œConstantly craving something that isnâ€™t mineâ€, he sings, against the urgent hum of a Hammond organ, on â€œTell Me It Ainâ€™t Soâ€. At other times, heâ€™s haunted by thoughts of dying alone and, as on â€œYou Will Find Meâ€, the idea â€œthat these are dreams that I only dream/ Do I dream alone?â€. 

But the real beauty of this wholly engaging record is the contrast between Hinsonâ€™s dry basso profundo and the (almost) euphoric banks of strings that swell behind banjos and acoustic guitars. The chamber music-noir of â€œI Keep Havinâ€™ These Dreamsâ€ sounds like a despondent relative of â€œEleanor Rigbyâ€, while â€œWe Wonâ€™t Have To Be Lonesomeâ€ has the â€˜60s sweep of a Spectoresque teen ballad. 

As does â€œSunrise Over The Olympus Monsâ€, whereby Hinson mutters â€œOh love of my lifeâ€ into the infinite space of a drained shot glass. Imagine Jack Nitzsche producing Silver Jews.

Of course, nobody does solitary quite like Micah P either. His own peculiar, twilit world is evoked strongest on â€œThrew The Stoneâ€ and â€œThe Fire Came Up To My Kneesâ€, his bony voice backed by the faintest of guitar figures. Rich in its moods, this could well be Hinsonâ€™s best yet.
