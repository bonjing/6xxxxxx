,Wopatoolie,2011-03-10T09:43Z,"id get this cuz i liked the show when i was a kid for the first few episodes, sitting around w a huge plastic bowl of cereal in front of the tv on sat mornings. but i seem to remember that the animation changed at some point, and it just wasnt as quality as when it started and i got disinterested after a while."

Not nit-picking but what company released this set? If this is NOT the Mill Creek Entertainment release (2009) then on the episode ""The Dragon's Graveyard"" (generally considered to be the best episode of the entire series) then the musical score has been changed to a less powerful one on the BCI-released.
