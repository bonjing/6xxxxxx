,sawatts,2011-07-20T09:30Z,"Sorry to say I had weird problems with this torrent.

The main MKV (d/l to a Linux NAS) appeared to Windows as ""in use"" so couldn't be renamed or moved.  A copy of the file had the same issue.

Main MKV did not play on the DLNA BR system (which does support MKV).

Possibly just a corrupted d/l - no one else reported any issues."
