And, by my research, an explanation of the "Mystic Mixes" releases.

*Note 1: As noted, this is actually a fake Enigma album, the 1st 2 songs are Enigma, and that's why they are included here, but the remainder of the album was other artists that sounded similar, or intentionally trying to copy Enigma.

**Note2: Part of the"15 Years After" Box Set, but I listed it as it's own album. 15YA is just a bundle of all albums released to that date, also contains 2 DVDs of all videos to that date.

***Note3: Razormaid, a DJ company remixes popular songs into thier own versions, and they are usually very hard to find in a torrent. Was also difficult to find the correct Album Art.

As always, my discog's have 100% completed ID3s, and 500x500 album art.
ENJOY again.
