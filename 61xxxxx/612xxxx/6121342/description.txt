From the liner notes:

Possibilities started out with Herbie Hancock asking, What if?

What if he made a short list of artists he admired, had crossed stages with on tour, or simply been curious about and extended an open ended invitation to join him in the studio?  He had no overarching concept in mind, no absolute agenda, no preset track listing, just the desire to find performers, who, like him, might be eager to step away from defined roles or familiar territory and make a creative leap of faith.

Carlos Santana:

Herbie has an incredible and confident way of playing a melody and improvising the grooves.  More importantly, he is a great and encouraging human being.  He stands for not just some profession in music, he stands for the beauty of the human spirit and what great potential a human being has to create beauty for the rest of the world.
