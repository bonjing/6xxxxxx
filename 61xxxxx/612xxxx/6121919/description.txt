Half-Truths | Sybil Hawthorne | Claire Adams | PD   + Pics

They say you cannot serve two masters. Sybil Hawthorne thought that she had found a way. Once PD and Claire Adams begin making demands of her, though, she very quickly learns otherwise. There is not even enough time to regret the lies she has told before they start to punish her. She knows that neither of them knows the meaning of the word mercy. She knows that begging for it is futile but she cannot stop the words or the tears that are pouring out of her.
