Itâ€™s quite difficult to put the â€˜Shoogle Soundâ€™ into words â€“ after a couple of minutes of waffling on about â€˜acid croftersâ€™ and â€˜celtic fusionâ€™, I normally end up saying to people, â€˜just go, youâ€™ll get it when you hear itâ€™. What you do get is a wonderful blend of traditional music and funky dance rhythms, which just make you want to get up and start reeling and jigging. The â€˜back row of guitar, bass and drums, provides the ideal foil for the â€˜top lineâ€™ of fiddle, banjo and mandolin.
