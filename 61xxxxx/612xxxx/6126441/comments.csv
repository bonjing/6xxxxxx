,linux21st,2011-01-26T10:38Z,"@YIFY

Sorry that I am using this space to post about the Spartacus series.

The video quality of the Spartacus is superb and I enjoyed it. 

Is it possible that you encode the missing audio and post it? Since it's mkv container, I think it's possible to 'de/mux' using Haali media splitter and swap the audio portion.

Thanks."
,Djalma,2011-01-27T00:22Z,"@ linux21st
I did remux the videos using audio tracks from another torrent and create a torrent with said tracks: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6130026
