The Burkiss Way is a BBC Radio 4 sketch comedy series that was broadcast from August 1976 to November 1980. It was written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, with some additional material in early episodes by John Mason, Colin Bostock-Smith, Douglas Adams, John Lloyd and others. The show starred Denise Coffey (series 1 only), Jo Kendall (series 2 onward), Chris Emmett, Nigel Rees and Fred Harris. The series had three producers over the years, announced as "Simon Brett of Stepney", "John Lloyd of Europe", and "David 'Hatch of the BBC' Hatch".

The series had its roots in a pair of half-hour sketch shows entitled Half-Open University which Marshall and Renwick had written with Mason for Radio 3 as a parody of the real life Open University programmes. The first of these shows, broadcast in August 1976, spoofed science, while the second, in December, lampooned history.

In a similar vein, The Burkiss Way was originally based around a fictional series of correspondence courses by "Professor Emil Burkiss" entitled The Burkiss way to Dynamic Living, and each episode, or "lesson", had a number and a title based on one of the course's fictional subjects: "Lesson 1: Peel Bananas the Burkiss Way", "Lesson 2: Pass Examinations the Burkiss Way", and so on. Although these numbers and titles were maintained throughout the show's run, an obvious and rapid change of style early in the second series saw the notion of a radio correspondence course become a hook rather than a narrative device, and it was thereafter mentioned only in passing. From here on the programme continued in a more obvious "sketch" format, though it was to use increasingly Pythonesque devices including surreal, stream-of-consciousness linking, back referencing and aggregation. Like the Pythons before them the writers lampooned and tinkered with the very medium on which the show was broadcast. Radio 4's continuity style was often spoofed. Many later episodes had false endings, sometimes cunningly disguised as genuine continuity announcements. Both the opening and closing credits might be placed anywhere within the show. One particular show ran "backwards" from the closing to the opening credits, while another was allegedly dropped and broken, and subsequently glued together with a tube of BBC coffee, resulting in a disjointed running order with many of the sketches beginning and ending in mid-sentence.


[b]Notes: The 3 in red in series 01 I have spent some time on cleaning up.
Not a lot I could do but make them more gentle on your ears.
You sould remove the 3 from your Burkiss folder before starting this download.
Once your happy they are better; discard the old versions.
I had many PM's saying The Half-Open University should be included as it's the Pilot, so I have.
