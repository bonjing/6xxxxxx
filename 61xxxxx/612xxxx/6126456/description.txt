Designing Tube Preamps for Guitar and Bass is the world's first comprehensive guide to the design of tube-based preamplifiers, specifically for musical instrument use, in a single volume.
From the input to the phase inverter, this book discusses the inner workings of every part of a conventional guitar preamp, including the use of triodes, pentodes, tone controls, effects loops and much more. Eliminating all 'guess work' and 'audio myths', this book reveals the science behind good tone.
Not intended for beginner, it brings intermediate-level circuit designer to advanced level, with over 200 circuit diagrams and figures, as well as new research into the distortion mechanisms of tubes and unique tone-manipulation techniques. An essential reference text for any amp enthusiast!
