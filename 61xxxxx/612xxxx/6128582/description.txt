Sarah (Erin Cahill) was a psychology student who hosted a late night radio show with her lecturer. Her life undergone a drastic change after she witnessed a horrific sight of her best friend, Audrey (Nikki Sanderson) been strangled to death by a monster a.k.a The Boogeyman.

With everyone assuming that Audrey had killed herself, only Sarah knew what happened exactly. She realized the legend of Boogeyman as told by Audrey before her death might be real after all, but none of her friends believed the myth. When those with suspicious minds of the possible existence of Boogeyman went missing from their dorms, Sarah knew she had to do something! In her vivid nightmares, they were murdered in the most horrific ways possible, but their bodies were never been found. Everyone thought Sarah was paranoid: neither her best friend, Lindsey (Mimi Michaels) nor boyfriend, David (Chuck Hittinger) buy her â€˜Boogeyman Killed Them All!â€™ remarks.
