  Dr. Vasi invents a super-powered robot, Chitti, 
  in his own image. The scientific body, AIRD     
  , that must approve the robot, declines it      
  based on its not having emotions and the ability
  to make rational judgment. A sudden flash of    
  lightning evokes emotions in the robot, and     
  Chitti is seemingly ready for integration into  
  the human world. Then, Chitti falls in love     
  with Dr. Vasi's fiancÃ©e Sana and turns on his   
  creator.
