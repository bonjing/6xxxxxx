I have an URGENT request!
Please add this torrent on TPB and seed for just a liiiiil bit...

Burlesque-Soundtrack[2010-MP3-Cov][Bubanee]

I'm stuck, along with dozens of others at 91.2% for some time now.  I've added all the trackers I could find on this torrent, but to no avail :(  Please rescue us!

Thanks ahead :)"
