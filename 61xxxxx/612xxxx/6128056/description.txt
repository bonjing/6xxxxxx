Dragon Ball GT closes the popular series in Dragon Ball with an introduction to another set of dragon balls and the reintroduction of Emperor Pilaf. Dragon Ball GT, short for Dragon Ball Grand Tour, first aired in Japan on January 7, 1996. Akira Toriyama, the creator of the Dragon Ball series, did not lead in the production of this series. It is believed that the only reason for the creation of GT was so that people would still be interested when the new Dragon Ball Video game Ã¢??Dragon Ball: Final BoutÃ¢?Â was released. Since the success Dragon Ball, new producers lead in the productions of GT without Akira Toriyama heading in the productions. The first few episodes were not popular with the viewers for the lack of action and story line, interest picked up as the Z warriors traveled across the galaxy
