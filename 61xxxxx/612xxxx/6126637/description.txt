Description / Review:
------------------------

Plastic palm trees. Beach scene snowglobes. Airbrushed neon sunset
hotel paintings. All shining examples of potent Fake Escapism at work,
in real life. And if you've ever wondered what the audio equivalent of
this kind of cheap coastal utopian simulacrum is, take a good listen
to the recorded works of Mr. Matt Mondanile aka Ducktails, a crazy
talented suburban New Jerseyan who serves up masterpiece after
blasterpiece of shimmering, smoke-and-mirrors exotic fantasia, rainbow
psych-pop muzak for imaginary helicopter rides over crystal lagoons
and lost waterfalls. His self-released tapes dropped over the past
year-plus have seen his basement guitar/rhythm hypnosis instincts
gently arcing upwards into a total art form, and this, Ducktails'
debut full-length CD, is the absolute zenith of the vision. Lazy
island percussion loops under blissed horizons of hovering synth
colors, warm jangly wah-wah guitars lap like waves alongside casual
hammock-chilling vocals; song titles like "Beach Point Pleasant" and
"Dancing With The One You Love" further articulate Mondanile's mood
agenda: maxin' & relaxin'. A few numbers get a bit more tripped/spaced
in a loosely post-Pacific City model, but those parts function less
like a drug ride and more just like the hazy time of night after the
beach bonfire's burned out and you pass out on the sand, holding hands
with someone special, staring up at the stars. What do you see?
Endless blackness? Or a new BFF? CD mastered by Graham Lambkin (of The
Shadow Ring) in a 4-panel digipak with cover artwork by Jan Anderzen
(of Kemialliset Ystavat/Tomuttontu), plus comes with a bonus song not
featured on the vinyl version of the album. Edition of 500.
