,55trucker,2011-02-08T04:29Z,Has anyone else found the same video stutter that I am getting? File will not play smoothly right from the opening studio logo intro. Will not play properly in WM6.4 Cinema Series or VLC or B.S or Gom. If the audio is extracted it will play properly on it's own but the video will just fail altogether.
