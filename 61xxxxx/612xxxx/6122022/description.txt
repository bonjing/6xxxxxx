Plot or synopsis
A young woman ditches her boy toy at the airport and runs into her ex with his present girlfriend and moves into their new home, which brings back happy memories with this and several other exes, and ignites that old flameâ€¦. Director Heiward Mak, who also co-pens Love in a Puff in this festival, demonstrates the sharpest eyes and ears in the trade for capturing the lingo, mannerism and mindset of todayÃ¢Â€â„¢s youth. As the pretty young thing hobnobs from one romance to another, telling herself that itÃ¢Â€â„¢s all part of a sentimental education and a journey, the film steps back to look at a soul going around in circles with true candor and honesty.
