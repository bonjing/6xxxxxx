Release Notes:
I dropped the ball on episode 28. 27 recorded but my HDD ran out of space during the commercial break before 28 started. I was away when it was airing so I didn't notice until I got home. I have included two versions of episode 28 instead.
House of Anubis 28 (web) [ws] is a widescreen (16:9) 'web-cap' and was captured at a frame rate of 25 fps.
House of Anubis 28 (sdtv) [fs] is a fullscreen (4:3) 'SDTV-cap' and is encoded at a frame rate of 23.97 fps.
Two versions, I believe I did a good job on both so take your pick. Screenshots are included below. Enjoy!
