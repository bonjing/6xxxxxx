Awake & Aware - Volume 2 (NTSC Version):
========================================

A conglomeration of several political activist documentaries together on one "movie" DVD. This is an attempt at packing the biggest "punch" in one DVD title. I call the DVD's, "Awake & Aware" after a similarly titled conference in LA September 2009. Enjoy and please spread around :)

P.S. a few mentionables in the DVD:

Freedom to Fascism
Architecture of a Prison Planet
Confessions of an Economic Hit Man
The Fluoride Deception
Secret Rulers of the World
911 Loose Change
...and a few more
