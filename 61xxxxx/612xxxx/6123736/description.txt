Here is the Essential Collection that has been modified a bit. Put this together for a friendâ€™s request. They seemed to like some of the small variations that are in the files. A few of the songs run together but were split up for â€œtrackâ€ purposes. I put 2 of the merged tracks at the end of Volume One. I didnt have enough FLAC source to post in that format... Oh well...  

Label is in the Essentials folder.

Enjoy.
