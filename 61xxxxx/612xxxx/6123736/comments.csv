,MMonterosso,2011-01-24T07:52Z,Uh... I donât know why I left the .CWB & .CWP Files in there? They are not necessary for the tunes.
,Flyfisher61,2011-01-24T22:47Z,"Thanks! CWB & .CWP Files, what is that?"
,MMonterosso,2011-01-25T05:13Z,"The .CWB is an old format of saving Sonar Cakewalk as a ""Bundle"". I used V2.0. It contains some of the blended tracks in .wav format from Volume 1.  I should have ignored those files during the upload. Sorry 'bout that.  The .CWP is a Sonar temporary file that remembers where files are that you are loading to use on a project itself. "

,MMonterosso,2011-01-30T07:44Z,"I guess I should have been more careful when posting. I also missed 2 shorter edits for Wild Child in the bonus folder. A person could pick the version they'd like and put it in the Volume 2 Folder. If I get a few interested requests here I'll take the time to post it as ""Heart Essentials - Wild Child Edits"". Hope everyone is enjoying the tunes..."
,MMonterosso,2011-02-08T19:14Z,I'm noticing all peers getting stuck on 94% download unless I'm seeding from my Vista OS. My Win XP OS matches the incomplete 94% downlaod. Maybe someone else can seed who has it at 100% on an XP OS? Any other thoughts or suggestions I'm open to 'em - Thanks...
