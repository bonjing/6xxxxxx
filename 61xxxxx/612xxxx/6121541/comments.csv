,Nickyboy7,2011-01-23T16:01Z,"As always thank you. I like this show, sad it's the last series. But I don't agree with the mutiny radio show the Kling brothers are doing. Calling for a boycot of other paranormal shows because they lost theirs is childish and quite shameful on their part."
,DeepHole,2011-01-23T19:54Z,"Didnt know about that..
They really lost their show..
its mean that theres no more ghost lab season upcoming...."
,ToneZone,2011-01-27T08:17Z,"Syfy should drop Ghost Hunters International and get Ghost Lab if no other network gets them.  GHI is the weakest paranormal show.  The sinking moment in GHI for me was when they thought it was paranormal for the drinking straw to move in a glass of ice water.

Thanks for the up."
[T],trialNerror,2011-01-27T18:18Z,"I agree.  That was THE MOST IDIOTIC event ever in the history of any paranormal investigation.

Syfy will never take Ghost Lab because of some spoken opinions stated on the mutiny radio show.  The Klinge Bros. probably don't care to do any more TV because they're making more money to pay the bills working regular jobs."

you guys agree?"
[T],trialNerror,2011-02-10T06:41Z,"GA probably is the best, but GL will surely be missed a lot.  New GH coming in a few weeks.  Gotta give credit to the originators.  More places investigated than all others combined.  "
,DeepHole,2011-02-10T23:15Z,originators... i love the english expression... youre right dude and i cant wait to see the next season!
