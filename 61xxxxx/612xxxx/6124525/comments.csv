,10to10to10,2011-02-22T22:42Z,"Hey Kentuky thank you for another awesome upload, i'll seed this till it hits around 5+ ratio since its only 170MB,,

Anyway, i was wonderinng, Im interested in this software so i can record PC gameplay or like from MAME gameplay, so which is best for that task - this or FRAPS?. "
,EricksHinumaru,2011-03-01T20:15Z,"@10to10to10

From someone who has used both programs (though, they were both only the demos) for recording, I'd highly recommend Camtasia over Fraps. Just my opinion, but it's much more user friendly."

,SirDV95,2011-04-30T02:38Z,"Once again, a very good program. Thank you very much!"
,Ezilkannan,2011-05-05T08:54Z,"@EricksHinumaru I dont think that camtasia is better than FRAPS at recording games. I have tried and trust me, it lags like hell in camtasia. So its best to use FRAPS its better and faster as the vid is ready with a simple hotkey. for camtasia you will have to wait once you finish recording. Here is what i do when i make gameplay vids. I record with FRAPS, and then edit that video in camtasia. SO if you are recording games, best to go for FRAPS, if you are recording something else, Camtasia is better for the quality. (But it lags too much for making game vids)"
,GrawCube,2011-05-07T16:46Z,Why the fuck does this quality torrent have so many minus points? This is good shit and stop being a newfag!
,devilboy155p,2011-05-17T22:59Z,"nice, fast download and it works,  Note to all you gamers out there, it will record a black screen if you have hardware acceleration turned on, if you have a kick-ass graphics card. most chipsets don't have hardware acceleration."
