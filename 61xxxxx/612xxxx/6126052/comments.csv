,JonJustJon,2011-09-13T20:14Z,"Many thanks sliptv for all your hard work on this.
I had a USA set and actually had to skip to series 6 as the canned laughter made series 1-5 (almost) unwatchable. At least they toned down the canned cr*p from series 6 onwards.
I raise my Martini glass to you..."
,primalclaws1974,2011-09-30T03:01Z,whats wronged with the canned laughter? thats what I grew up on. I cant imagine how boring and unfunny mash would be wo the laughing in the background!
,Da Bastard,2011-10-01T18:56Z,"Thanks a lot, can't wait to watch the old show again."
,WTC2,2011-11-26T22:06Z,"To all the nay Sayers who object to the missing canned laughter. The show was ORIGINALLY meant to be shown WITHOUT the canned cr*p. (I mean really, they (the network) had recycled the canned laughter from the fifties) After the success of the first two years, the network agreed to a ""Chuckle track"" instead of the laugh track. Still, It was annoying. (No laugh track needs to tell ME what's funny). Once again, and I have already done this.. MANY PROPS to the uploader of these torrents!! kudos! "
