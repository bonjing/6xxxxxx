ALL IS REVEALED IN THE GROOVE TUBE

The most hilarious and wildest movie is here!

A collection of skits that make fun of television. Everything from
commercials to the nightly news are spoofed. Chevy Chase and
Richard Belzer make their screen debuts!

This collection of satirical sketches about television was released in
1974, the heyday of obvious pop-culture humor along the lines Cheech
and Chong.
