The key to victory hinges on the defeat of island strongholds throughout the Pacific. To do this the U.S. army deploys specially trained soldiers to carryout commando-style attacks against the forces of Japan. From sweltering rainforests to sun-baked coral beaches and stinking mangrove swamps, players lead their squad of 12 skilled heroes on real missions with real consequences. Coordinate attacks, sneak into enemy villages, rescue captured POWs and more. Missions can be played single-handedly or jointly with friends over the Internet for cooperative play. It's the authentic hard-edged intensity of the Pacific Theater.
