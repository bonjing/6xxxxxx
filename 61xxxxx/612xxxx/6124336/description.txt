Alan Greenberg wrote This relic from the Summer of Love is an enduring delight. The bold notion to team blues masters Muddy Waters and "Little Walter" Jacobs with rocking rhythm-and-blues king Bo Diddley works wonders throughout, achieving a creative chemistry and energy rarely seen in jam bands of this sort. The vocal and instrumental interplay on every track is intensely competitive in the tradition of jook house "headcutting" contests, with each performer spurring the next on to evermore impressive heights, while soaring through a repertoire of favorites like Muddy's "Long Distance Call," Bo's "I'm a Man" and "Who Do You Love," Little Walter's "Sad Hours," and Willie Dixon's "You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover." With the powerhouse headliners backed by the likes of Otis Spann on piano and Buddy Guy on guitar, this period piece remains a fun and refreshing gem. --
