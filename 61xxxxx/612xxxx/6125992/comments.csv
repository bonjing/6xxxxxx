You cannot mount Windows Installation File When you going to install new windows.

You will need to buy 4.7GB DVD/CD and use ImgBurn 2.5.5.0
Download it here:
http://www.filehippo.com/download_imgburn/

Step1: Insert Clean DVD/CD
and do not do nothing yet with the DVD/CD

Stem2: Open ImgBurn 2.5.5.0
(Vista/Win 7 Run as admin)

Then press there ""Write image file to disc""
Then Choose maximum write speed to 4x (Safe)

Then Press the icon with ""File -> DVD""
(Its big icon near there u will see it)

Then you need to add what file you wanna write to DVD/CD

Find the place you downloaded/Moved then win 7 Ultimate .iso file and doble click on it and your burning must start.

Wait when done and try it."

""Are there any problems with KB971033 in this release?""

Not sure. I noticed a lone anti-piracy update (likely KB971033) amongst the others. Obviously, exactly what you want to avoid installing. Turn off auto updates. When you must, read well and don't install (plus 'hide') updates like these."

2.) After mounting it, do i just have to put in the CD i mounted it to and run the setup and if i have a new computer can i just put in the CD and start the install?

3.) Lastly can this be used for an upgrade, or is it just a clean install.

Im sorry for asking so many questions, im new to mounting and downloading an OS.

If any1 can answer it would be greatly appreciated."
[V],peck1234,2011-05-09T05:24Z,"1. Yes it has both
2. Yes you can mount if installing and just run the setup if upgrading from Vista, however a clean install is recommended

Too bad then, I never cared for auto activating releases because eventually in the future whatever activator you used will be detected and there is no way to uninstall the old activator and get a new one since you have no idea what activator was used on this.

this works on VMWare Workstration.
i know you probably will say, ""of course, it's windows"". this is preactivated, so there are some parts that are probably edited from the original version. dont know how 86x and 64x can be combined all together, and i dont know how it works in the installation session.
i dont really mind anyway. because i only need Windows to use Windows to use some softwares that can't be used on Linux's Wine or Ubuntu.

Installed w/out error in ~15 minutes, then proceeded to download *every* available update (not just high-priority) and two language packs without a hitch.

-120 votes my arse -- this is flawless. Thanks Peck!"
