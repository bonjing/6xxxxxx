[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-26T16:04Z,All episodes from every season + all the extras. Please seed for as long as possible.
,boneyboy0,2011-01-26T16:08Z,"Live long and prosper :o)

thanks fpr the up"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-26T16:43Z,"No worries boneyboy. I couldn't find a proper torrent with decent quality episodes and all the extra's so I thought I'd make it so by doing one myself. All the extra's are in Hi-Def and most of the episodes are 720. Despite this they're still a reasonable size (350Mb per episode). Let's keep this show alive by seeding it. If you don't, I'll set Q on you. Warp factor 9.4 on the upload speed, engage."
,kyleb001,2011-01-31T00:12Z,"Thx for the seeds all, I'll help seed this as well for quite a while, I want to see some good availability on this one... I love this series :D"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-04T16:00Z,"Come on everyone, seed. Don't be selfish, you got a great show for free. At least do some seeding."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-10T03:00Z,"Hundreds of people have downloaded this and there are 3 seeds. Is there any point going to the trouble of uploading and seeding a tv show if people are just going to download and run? If you're not willing to seed, please don't download this. It's a big file and you're wasting my bandwith. You get a show for free and you won't even seed. Thanks. "
,billylopez,2011-02-23T16:28Z,pls seed guys
,PaperWar,2011-02-24T00:34Z,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED!!!!!
I promise I will send for a very long time, IF I ever get it.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE"
,jaydee78,2011-02-24T07:24Z,"Seeded ~300GB before i got it down. Stopped seeding right after it got to 100% as i never got over 400kb/s in download and NEVER went under 400kb/s in upload....

Sniffer_V : A big thank you!!!"
,shabbyp,2011-03-01T21:35Z,"How long has it taken other people to download this torrent?  I've got a maximum download just now of 6 kb/s with peers sharing at a rate of 1-2 kb/s. Normally I can download at around 800+ kb/s, even on new torrents.  I've currently showing 2 seeds (of 73) and 28 peers (of 753). Anybody got a pointer as to what may be going wrong for me?"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-03T06:43Z,"This should be super fast for everyone. How many connections are you set up for? Mine is 500 connections and 200 peers with 16 upload slots. I always seem to get fast downloads. Make sure your protocol encryption is set to Enabled and finally, make sure you use UTorrent, it's so much better than the rest. "
,TheWun1,2011-03-03T08:42Z,"To Steo38;
I have watched 9 episodes so far and I haven't noticed any problems. Are you referring to certain episodes or all of them in general?
If all of them, then you must be UBER-picky to rate the video at 2. If I analyze the video, I confess it looks like very good VHS quality, a bit softly focused, and in dark areas the compression blocks are visible, but I hadn't really noticed until now. I guess I was too busy enjoying the show to look closely at the video quality.

To all: If you're looking for a super sharp Hi-Def version, this is not it, but in my opinion, it is good quality and easily watchable.
I will also download one episode from this guy and compare: http://thepiratebay.org/user/meech"
,TheWun1,2011-03-13T11:02Z,"Compared to the versions that Meech has, these are like 90-95% as good. Meech has slightly crisper video and the audio is a bit crisper too. however, these are 350MB per episode and Meech's are 550MB... so obviously they should be better.
In my opinion, I can barely tell the difference, and for an extra 200MB per episode, I would have thought the difference to be much larger.
If you're really curious, download one episode of each and do your own comparison, but I say both are great and you'll be happy with either one. I guess it mostly comes down to bandwidth and hard drive space."
,Oluutaa,2011-04-02T23:46Z,Please seed this! There are two seeders right now! This is ridiculous! 
,Oluutaa,2011-04-02T23:47Z,"Forgot to mention,

Thanks for all the uploads, Sniffer. I love all your box sets, I just wish this one would download :P"
,Gazooo,2011-04-04T14:48Z,"Super UL, thanks alot Tsniffer!!!...
Great Quality to watch!!!...
You've made me very happy!!!...
Took me a while to DL it though, just like everone else.....
Ok, people, i know it takes a long time to DL and it's a big file to have on your computer, and you just want to quit and run after DLing it, but give a little bit back to others how are DLing too and seed for a while!!!
Thanks again and Greetings from Gazooo in The Netherlands."
,cyril19,2011-04-07T13:54Z,"I'm currently watching the first season and episode 7 is a duplicate of episode 6 (Where no one has gone before), until now everything ellse seems to work great, I'll report back in case there's another error."
,PROTEOUS1,2011-04-09T14:32Z," Really Excellent quality and all episodes are exactly as they are labled.
Total download time 77 hrs. 

Thank You,very much."
,Dramat,2011-04-17T22:10Z,Thank You for this high quality Upload!
,Dramat,2011-04-19T07:27Z,"To all who have same problem as Shabbyp:

Do not download all files simultaneously. Set 3 or 4 last seasons files to ""Skip"". Download ""first half"" and than change prioroty of the rest from ""Skip"" to ""Normal"". That should do the work."
,zesq,2011-04-27T02:03Z,"hi, i'm also really struggling to get these files downloaded, i adjusted my settings per your instructions and am only trying to get the extras at this point (that is, all 7 seasons are on hold), and yet it has still been over 2 days with an average download speed of around 20 kB/s, so even those ""extras"" files won't be done for another 14 hours at this point. is there anything else i can do before abandoning this download? really bumming, i mean, with a few dozen seeders and proper settings and good connection shouldn't this be much much faster? thanks anyway for trying..."
,fourwheelin,2011-05-18T13:47Z,I WILL SEED FOR QUITE SOME TIME...I HAVE COMCAST TURNED WIDE OPEN!...ALMOST UNLIMITED BANDWITH...I HOPE IT HELPS...
,sillyrabbit78,2011-05-27T19:35Z,"I just started downloading this yesterday and I have been playing around with the settings and it says it's going to take 2 weeks and 3 days lol I'm no computer whiz, can someone speak and spell out what I need to do to speed up the download. Yes I am silly =P"
,sillyrabbit78,2011-05-27T20:05Z,"@sniffer I did all this >> This should be super fast for everyone. How many connections are you set up for?

Make sure your protocol encryption is set to Enabled and finally, make sure you use UTorrent, it's so much better than the rest.

,sillyrabbit78,2011-06-01T07:56Z,"I will seed this as soon as it is finished downloading, but that won't be for another few days.... My computer has been up and running for days... I didn't think it would take this long =P Oh well a few more days won't hurt! "
,sillyrabbit78,2011-06-02T00:57Z,Why 0(341) Seeds? I have been downloading this for a week now! SEED!!! PLEASE!!!!
,wyde666,2011-06-05T19:24Z,"guys season 2 its not sync with every english subtitle with anythings, besides why this torrent did not include english subtitle? can you tell me where is proper english subtitle.. ?

long live and prosper (^^)V"
,ineedalifetoday,2011-06-07T09:40Z,Thank You. I shall seed at night :D
,dvdgen,2011-06-08T07:01Z,Thank you very much.
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-07-01T22:57Z,"There are 922 seeds. If the download is slow, check your settings. The audio and video are spot on, I've watched every episode."
,klondikex,2011-07-08T14:53Z,I'm having odd problem: the video is speeded up a lot.  I'm guessing maybe it's a codec.  I'm trying to use windows media classic.  I've also installed CCC.  Could anyone possibly suggest what I might be able to do to fix this?  
,Neo_aeoN,2011-08-13T15:04Z,"@klondikex : Same was happening with my Windows Media and even MPC. Though not with VLC so must not be the actual files. I fixed the last problem I had with this (on Vista HORROR) by changing when Norton would run - auto /time out /idle time or similar. On the slightest chance this helps, great. If not.. Marshmallow (I know this doesn't seem related but I fixed it by advice from these very comments a while back."
,Isadorabelle,2011-08-15T13:07Z,"I'll be seeding ASAP. I have to download in parts, I don't have enough room on my regular hard drive!

BTW, thanks for the torrent!"

,hoojaah,2011-08-23T20:13Z,"Seriously, I've been downloading for 0.3 - 5kbps for over a week now. Can someone please seed this.
Im letting people upload at full speed. 

Please, someone with 100% seed :)"
,gearofwar,2011-09-20T10:49Z,"I wonder if anyone can help me? I'm downloading by season on utorrent, but I can't add season 2; whenever I open the torrent again it just asks me if I want to add trackers, rather than giving me the folder window where I can select season 2 for download...
I'd really like to be able to keep seeding the whole thing, but downloading only 1 season at a time. It seems like the only way to add the next season is to delete the torrent, which means I no longer have it available for seeding. 

Anybody else with utorrent who can help?

Thanks to TsV for the upload."
,maxmaxpayne,2011-09-26T13:46Z,TVS sucks balls. i downloaded this and others made by TVS and there are errors in the videos. I fix them and it cuts out parts of the movie. otherwise it freezes midway. take the skull from this toilet turd

,Cinderella78,2011-09-29T10:45Z,Thanks for uploading this - I will seed once it's downloaded which will be a while as there are many things in the queue. 
,edikkkkkk,2011-10-16T15:36Z,"first of all thank you for posting this wonderful torrent.

i was wondering if i could get some help. i have been on this torrent for 10 days and nothing i try with my torrent client can breathe life into it. i dont get over 12k download no matter what i do. im running latest utorrent, 3.0.
i tried enabling and disabling DHT, encryption, legacy connections.
the interesting part is that there are so many seeds, over 350, and over 2000 leechers, but i can only connect to the leechers, when the seeds are always only 1 or 2.
also, before you say i am a noob and dont know what im doing, i read the comments are it seems im not the only one who is having this issue.
other torrents with much fewer seeds download at 550k no problem. this one though seems stalled.
please advise on how to solve this issue. im a big fan of the original star trek with kirk and spock and would love to watch this one as well.

thank you for your help and for your efforts uploading this torrent."
,schmolch,2011-11-06T15:56Z,"Thank you for this great torrent and thank you to everyone who is seeding. Im download since 3 hours and have an average of 300kb/s.

,polarbearable,2011-12-06T00:56Z,Why are there people out there with 100% downloaded and NOT seeding? Because they're selfish. At the moment I'm getting about 5kB/s. I'll be in the grave before this finishes.
,Cappy73,2012-01-06T13:48Z,What the hell is with the MKV craze? These files suck.

??? ffs

Nobody wants to hear you screaming ""SEEEEEED!!!"" or your reviews on the show!"
,elsmeghead,2012-01-21T22:32Z,"Writing ""SEED"" on this page will NOT convince people to seed, as the leechers have already hit the ""download"" link and will never visit this page again to read your comments.

btw. I'm a 2.0 ratio seeder with ""max torrents (up or down)"" set to 256"

The downloading speed is 5 kb/s which is a speed I haven't seen since the modem days and this is a pretty huge torrent. If you can, help us!

To all who need subtitles: there are no compatible english subtitles out there, I suggest downloading whatever you find and use the Linear Correction provided from SubShifter (an online tool) to correct them and use them."
