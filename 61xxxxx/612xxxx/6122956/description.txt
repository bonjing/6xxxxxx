     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      British comedy's biggest night of the year, where the UK's
      top comedic talent come together to celebrate the past year's
      triumphs. Only Jonathan Ross is brave enough to take them all on
      with his quick wit and acerbic jibes that have made this the
      must-see event in the awards calendar. As the British Comedy
      Awards enter their 21st year, Channel 4 brings the awards bang
      up to date, reinvigorating the brand and returning to a live
      broadcast to inject spontaneity, excitement and edge into the
      already raucous proceedings.
