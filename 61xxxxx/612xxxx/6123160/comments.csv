Early films arent so bad but the later pierce brosnan and daniel craig ones are unwatchable! would recommend getting them seperately. overall 4/10. would advise to stay clear!"

,An_Armenian,2012-01-06T20:03Z,"Wow, on.off.on, I really appreciate this.

This is one of their best uploads you've done, and it really is too bad that you don't upload anymore.

James Bond is my favorite, and I will be seeding this for a very long time."
,Fallen_Gri,2012-02-29T00:15Z,Hmmm for some reason Thunderball won't play (on PSP) and seems to be corrupted as the video/sound are out of synch. Will try to re-download and see if its just me.
