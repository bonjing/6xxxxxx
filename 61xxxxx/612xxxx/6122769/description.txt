While on a job in Iraq, civilian contractor Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is attacked and kidnapped, then awakens to find himself buried alive in the middle of the desert with nothing but a lighter, a candle, a cell phone and a knife. Does Paul have the instincts he'll need to save himself? Director Rodrigo CortÃ©s crafts a tense psychological thriller with sociopolitical undertones that doubles as an exercise in claustrophobic terror.
