Christian Slater plays his typical teen rebel with a cause in this spectacular skateboarding drama. Brian Kelly (Slater) is a skateboarder, alienated from his family, in particular his adopted Vietnamese brother Vinh (Chudabala), a brilliant student. When Vinh is found dead the verdict is apparently suicide but Brian refuses to accept that his brother could kill himself.

With the help of cynical detective Al (Bauer) and his beautiful friend Tina (Luong), Brian and his skateboard set out on a quest to discover the truth and avenge Vinh.
