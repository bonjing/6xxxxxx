2008 saw the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll, Tina Turner return to the live circuit and announce the Tina Turner 50th Anniversary Concert Tour much to the delight of her fans. The tour kicked off in Kansas in October 2008 and continued for six months visiting over ten countries in two continents.
Tina performed an astounding ninety shows, repeatedly selling out, with nightly standing ovations. Millions of fans and critics alike were blown away by Tinaâ€™s age defying high-octane performances showing that the star has no sign of slowing down at nearly 70 years young. The megastar delivered an energetic, powerful, uncompromised two hour set performing classic hits with incredible musicians, vocalists, dancers and ninjas, supported by stunning production, innovative choreography, spectacular lighting, pyrotechnics and much more. 

As Tina finished the final show in Sheffield in May 2009 she said, "I have been overwhelmed, astounded and taken to new heights by the reaction of the thousands of fans who came to see me every night. This has been a tour to remember, to hold dear in my heart and what way to celebrate my 50 years in the business, to sum up; itâ€™s been super!"

The DVD of this record-breaking world tour was filmed at GelreDome, Arnhem in Holland in March 2009 where Tina played to an enormous crowd of 70,000 people.

Directed by David Mallet for Serpent Productions, this breathtaking footage is filmed in HD and mixed in 5.1 surround sound. At over two hours long it features all of her much loved songs including, "The Best", "Private Dancer" and the powerful "We Don't Need Another Hero". A Tina Live CD serves as an accompaniment to this visual spectacular.
