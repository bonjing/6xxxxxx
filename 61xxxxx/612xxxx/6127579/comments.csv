,andyrew93,2011-01-31T12:08Z,"This game is OK. Nothing more I mean the idea is very original and solid. I would give it an overall 6/10.
Pros:
-The gameplay style is awesome, combining different elements is very entertaining. It's definitely a fresh idea.
-Very cool weapons that give you different abilities.
Cons: (more disadvantages than advantages, sadly)
-Has tons of bugs.
-Not enough saving points is very fucking frustrating.
-Frost+Arcane+Lightning+right click is overpowered and can kill anything with no problem. That kind of imbalances the whole gameplay totally. Because of this there is no need for weapons at all.
-The spells you obtain throughout the game cannot be used. Bugged or what? Idk. 

Well it's definitely not worth the money, but it is fun if you wanna burn some time."
,Jegreen,2011-01-31T13:34Z,"Well yeah, the game has some issues... But there is one big difference between this here pirated one and if you but it on steam. PATCHES. You see andrew: When you own the game through steam, patches download automatically and it seems that the developers are well aware of the early problems. There are more savepoints and the spell combos work as they should... maybe they even f*cked it up so that us pirates would have a lousy experience. Who knows? Anyhoo... loved the game. Downloaded it, played it for 10 minutes and then bought it."
,JRollification,2011-01-31T14:03Z,"@joshfb No I'm not stupid but thnks for asking. The reason I ran without the crack was to narrow down where I was having the problem, see if it didnt work before the crack then I would've found it was something not related to the crack.

But at least you tried to be helpful thanks fir the feedback."
,Escabob310,2011-01-31T15:52Z,"Hey, was wondering if anybody could help me:

One thing that might be linked, is that after I install the game, when you're asked to install the 3 other programs (DirectX, .NET FW and something else), If I select them all, the first 2 fail (I get some error relating to the dependencies folder) so I just manually installed the exact same version of them.

Any ideas/help? :)"

2) Install, make sure you tick all the boxes at the end to install the software needed to run the game. DO NOT CRACK AT THIS STAGE.

3) Once installed, update the game with this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6127772/Magicka.Update.1-SKIDROW.

4) Use the crack provided with the update instead of the one with the main folder.

5) Experience the game, then buy it, it's totally worth the measly â‚¬10 to play online :)."

@fomorian27:  The admin thing is for vista/7 users.  Even if you are on an admin account, programs don't have admin access unless you give it to them.  Try going to microsoft and installing the latest xna and the latest directx.  The game uses xna for everything and even supports xbox 360 controller.  If the stuff isn't installed it crashes."

First, turn off windows UAC (User account control).
To make it, open your control panel, type in UAC on the search box and then open it.
If you are using Vista, uncheck the box.
If you are using Seven, drag the control all the way down.
Click ok.
Reboot the computer.

Now, if you already install magicka, uninstall it, both the update and the game itself.

Run the Game instalation.
When finished, mark the two last boxes (Framework 3.5 and XNA).

Crack it.

Enjoy =D

,XLife397,2011-06-26T03:31Z,"Had the ""Magicka has stopped working"" error. Reinstalled and this time made sure to install the XNA Framework at the end of the installation, which made it work. (actually I checked Net framework as well, but I should already have had that installed)

When I started the game I got stuck on a screen showing a PS controller for some reason, though. Might be related to the fact that I installed update 23 before reinstalling."
