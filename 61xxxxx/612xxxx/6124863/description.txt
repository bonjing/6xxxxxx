Plot.............: In this politically charged drama, a self-absorbed film director who
wants nothing other than to make films is arrested by the government and serves a long
sentence. Despite that, when he emerges he still has a lovely modern apartment and his
family is intact. Now that he is out of prison, he is attempting to put another film
deal together and must fight the censors tooth and nail, even being arrested again at
one point. However persistent he may be as a director, his disloyalty to the women in
his life drives away first his long-suffering wife and then his French mistress. Once
the narcissistic director's film is made, he realizes that it will never be distributed
in his homeland, and that it's not likely to interest international viewers -- exactly
the situation that faced this film in real life.
