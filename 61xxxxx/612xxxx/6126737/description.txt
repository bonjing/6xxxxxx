               Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho(1960) With English subs
               ------------------------------------------------


Considered by many to be Hitckcock's best film, the film depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who is in hiding at a motel after embezzling from her employer, and the motel's owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and the aftermath of their encounter.


The film is based on the screenplay by Joseph Stefano, who adapted it from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The novel was based on the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.

Psycho was, by a large margin, the top moneymaking film of Hitchcock's career, earning $11,200,000.

The film spawned two sequels, a prequel, a remake, and a television movie spin-off.
