In 2005, it was remixed by internationally renowned DJ/producer D.O.N.S. who took it to number one on the British Dance Chart.



Cover versions
--------------
Icelandic band FM Belfast made a slow electronica cover of "Pump up the Jam". In 1990, it was parodied with virtually identical music as the German-language Pump ab das Bier ("Pump away the beer!", urging a fellow barsitter to drink up) by Werner Wichtig, stage name for Raimund Thielcke, who actually had brewer training. The vocal has been sampled in the hardcore music Da pump by Da tekno warriors. In 1998 it was remixed by Crazy Frog on the 2005 album Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits. Quebec acoustic cover band The Lost Fingers recorded a cover of the song for their 2008 album Lost In The 80s. Kids Incorporated sang this song on the show's 7th season. In 2009 the song was interpolated by rapper Pitbull in the song B-Day Suit. In 1992, "Weird Al" Yankovic made a short polka version for his medley "Polka Your Eyes Out".

Lyrics
------
Pump up the jam
pump it up
why your feet are stomping?
And the jam is pumping
look at it get the crowd jumpin'

pump it up a little more
get the party goin' on the dance floor
see 'cause that's where the party's at and you fine dinning, to bad

(chours)
I want a place to say:
"get your booty on the floor tonight"
make my day
I want a place to say:
"get your booty on the floor tonight"
make my day

make my day (x5)

Yo! Pump up the jam
pump it up
why your feet are stomping?
And the jam is pumping
look at it get the crowd jumpin'

pump it up a little more
get the party goin' on the dance floor
see 'cause that's where the party's at and you fine dinning, to bad

(chours)
