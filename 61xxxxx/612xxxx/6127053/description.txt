Hooverphonic, live on 23/01/2011 in Club 69
An incredibly good concert, I was there on the front row!

Here are all recordings I could find:
- 2 Wicky
- Anger Never Dies
- Club Montepulciano
- Heart Broken
- Identical Twin
- Mad about you
- Norwegian Stars
- One two three
- The Night Before
- Vinegar and Salt (UPDATE!! ADDED THIS ON 25/01)

MP3, 128Kb/s, but they sound pretty good!
Enjoy!
