,Bleazle,2011-01-26T06:37Z,"Hi Slick, you're (still a) legend! Thanks for making these files available :-) Any chance of making 480p versions (i.e. as well as the 720p copies) of ALL races not just the live broadcasts? - the download ""speed"" here in New Zealand is freakin' stupid, right now I'm only getting 1.2kb/s (not 12, 1.2!) and it's very rare to get anything over about 100kbs (or to even get that high!)So it would be great to be able to download a smaller file (if people will seed it..).."
,projekttm,2011-01-26T10:45Z,Thanks for sharing :-)
,akito76,2011-01-26T11:54Z,"First a 1000 thanks from Denmark. 
I sit every sunday and wait for the torrent. I can not watch mp4 on my old thing, but i convert to mp2 1280x720 and it is great. DL speed i DK for me was around 750kb/s last night. 
You upload makes my Monday gooooood.
Thanks"
