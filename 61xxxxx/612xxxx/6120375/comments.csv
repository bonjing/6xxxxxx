DAMN!!!! back to the drawing board.... i will give dvd-shrink a blast...

mind you, the convert was absolutely beautiful apart from the directors commentary, so i must be getting pretty close  ;o)"

,defeatedsanity,2011-01-22T20:50Z,"O.O.O. when you get some free time, Please provide us with some quick screen shots of your handbrake settings, advanced settings etc.. So some of us ""aspiring"" encoders can get the same top notch quality that you provide us.

Thanks for all you share."
