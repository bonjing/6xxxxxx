â€œSweetheart, Keep Your Chin Up,â€ is co-produced with Salim Nourallah (The Old â€˜97s) and expands on the sound they have become known for:a blend of rootsy pop jangle and country noir. Like its predecessor â€œLittle Films,â€ â€œSweetheart, Keep Your Chin Upâ€ is something of a concept album, taking fairy tales and myths and putting a modern spin on them, giving voice to such characters as Odysseus, Penelope, The Sirens, the Wicked Witch of the West, and others.
"Sweetheart, Keep Your Chin Up," has been well-received by critics on both sides of the Atlantic and debuted at #12 on The Euro Americana Chart. Peters and the band played 100+ dates in 2009 in support of the new album, including shows at prestigious venues such as McGonigel's Mucky Duck in Houston, The Green Note in London and Folk Club in Torino, Italy.
