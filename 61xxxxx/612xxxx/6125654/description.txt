"Knockdown"

Old wounds are reopened when the retired 
lead detective on Beckett's mother's 
homicide case contacts her with new 
information, but then is gunned down right 
in front of Beckett before he can tell her 
what he knows. The investigation into his 
death leads back to a decades-old 
conspiracy that may hold the answer to who 
was behind Beckett's mother murder and why. 
With the stakes and emotions running high, 
Castle and Beckett take their partnership 
to the next level

Enjoy :)
