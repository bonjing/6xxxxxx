http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6125546/Castle_2009_S03E13_HDTV_XviD-LOL_%5Beztv%5D

This one here is almost three times as large and I was wondering if the resolution and or quality of this one is say twice as good as the other. TIA."

this version is the 720p version

so yes, it's a higher resolution which means higher quality."

Right. I saw that. Thanks for posting. I have seen some poor or only moderate 720p versions of other uploads that appear to me to be only moderately better than their ""cousins"" which is why I was asking if anyone had compared the two. I'll just download and see. P.S. I thought the female detective looked extra pretty this week and I wanted to grab some screen pulls : )"

,VenusAngel9,2011-01-27T04:42Z,"Hi! I wonder if anyone can help me. With this file I only get audio and no video. This happens both in Zoom player and MPC. It only happens with this particular file though. I am perfectly able to play other 720 MKVs. 
Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing a setting or something? 
Thanks for any help. "
,VenusAngel9,2011-01-27T04:46Z,Forgot to add. I'm using CCP with CoreAVC
,VenusAngel9,2011-01-27T05:50Z,"Oh, no worries. It plays if I don't use AVC. Weird but... I'm happy if I can watch it."
,thesoftparade,2011-02-13T01:00Z,Thank you very much!
