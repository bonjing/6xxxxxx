,muthineni,2011-01-24T06:55Z,"thanks for recommending life as we know it.
i would have missed it otherwise. its a good movie. maybe not a never done before but definitely moving and engaging.
the imdb ratings are just  basic helpers but r no standards. forbidden kingdom got a 6.7. i hated that movie in theatre."

,tylr,2011-01-24T14:44Z,"..or rather a 320p BRRip
can u do that?!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-24T15:24Z,@tylr: Nope. It has border-line IMDB (4.5) to be encoded at all (min. 4.4) and that 0.1 has been given by your stupid remark last week (on torrent I therefore have deleted).
