AVG Identity ProtectionT and AVG Firewall (enhanced for AVG 2011)

Provides additional layers of security, keeping your private information safe at all times.
AVG's Firewall protects you from malicious attacks by examining communications on each network port. It recognizes all attempts to invade your system and blocks them immediately, keeping both you and your private information safe.

AVG Identity ProtectionT is the outer layer of security, keeping your personal information safe by shielding your passwords, credit card numbers, and other digital valuables from prying eyes. AVG Identity Protection uses the latest behavioural technologies to identify software that behaves strangely and stop it before it can do any damage.
Keep tough threats outAVG

Anti-Virus, AVG Anti-Spyware, AVG Protective Cloud Technology and AVG Community Protection Network

AVG's core layers of protection make sure you can't receive or unintentionally spread even the toughest threats.

AVG Cloud Technology, new for 2011, constantly carries out tests 'in the cloud' over the internet to identify the latest emerging threats. Once we have identified threats we develop solutions and then update AVG on your computer in near real-time.

AVG Community Protection Network is new for 2011 and is like an online neighborhood watch, helping everyone in the online community to protect each other. Information about the latest threats is collected from customers who choose to participate in the product improvement program and shared with the community to make sure everyone receives the best possible protection.

AVG Anti-Spyware protects you from spyware and adware - the same kind of malware that is often very difficult to remove, which is why we prevent it from getting to you in the first place.

Q: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'
A: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; 
   
   OPTION 1: Download & install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: 

   http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm
   
   OPTION 2: Download & install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded

Q: 'I download a keygen from a user & my AV flagged it as a virus!'
A: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. 

   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.
   
   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user & check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. 

   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.
   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.

   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum & report it here: 
   http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    

Q: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'
A: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum & explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772

Q: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'
A: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701

Q: 'I don't know how to mount an image file. I don't know this I don't know that. How?'
