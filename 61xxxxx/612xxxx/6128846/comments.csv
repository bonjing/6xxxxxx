It is 60gb and its only slow because its a new torrent and people arent seeding. anyway I am 98% done and i have watched most of them, great quality. Took nearly 3 days total D/L but thats great considering this is a 9 blu ray disc release!!! 
Its old, but has been remastered, some of the footage from the 1930s is breathtaking and in colour in parts."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-08T16:18Z,the minus votes are all from one person who simply dislikes me. nothing to do with the torrent.

,ortalab,2012-02-09T09:50Z,"Excellent!! I voted +1
My theory pof the negative voters are that it cannot be played in VLC. I get the error message (in swedish, sorry):
""Ingen lämplig avkodningsmodul:
VLC saknar stöd för ljud- eller videoformatet ""undf"". Tyvärr finns det inget sätt för dig att rätta till detta.""

Basically it says there are no module for decoding the format ""undf"""
