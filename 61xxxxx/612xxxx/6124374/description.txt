  Ik Kudi Punjab Di is the story of a girl who 
  challenges the male dominated society of     
  Punjab and wants to be treated at par with   
  the boys. We all say that there is no        
  difference between a boy and a girl but, we  
  all know that truth is something else. Our   
  heroine understands that her struggle is not 
  going to be easy but she is prepared to make 
  any sacrifice for that. For that she has to  
  fight with her lover, her parents and
