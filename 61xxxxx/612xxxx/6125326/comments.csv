Am I right in thinking you stopped providing Match of the Day torrents because of people re-posting? That would be such a shame. Are you still providing MOTD torrents privately? If so, is there any way I can subscribe? I'll send you over a box of beer or something. Living abroad, I've been so reliant on these torrents from you and before from Albiondeann, it was always something to look forward to on a hungover sunday morning.
