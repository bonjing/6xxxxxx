Currently this IP: 74.111.126.16:6881 is indeed trying to infiltrate this Torrent.
You will recognise it because uTorrent diagnoses that it is using a FAKE uTorrent version 1.8.5.0
Usually it does manipulate the torrent file in such a way that the upLoadings seems never end, locked at 99.8% or so.
Apparently it comes from the US, Pittsburg !
THE BEST WAY IS TO edit your %AppData%/uTorrent .dat file, to insert this IP (or, better the entire range 74.111.126.00 - 74.111.126.255) and to ask uTorrent to RelaodIPFilter ( rightclick in Peeers Panel)"
