RELEASE NOTES

Magicka is a satirical action-adventure game set in a rich fantasy
world based on Norse mythology. The player assumes the role of a wizard
from a sacred order tasked with stopping an evil sorcerer who has
thrown the world into turmoil, his foul creations besieging the forces
of good.

Players will be able to combine the elements to cast spells, wreaking
havoc and devastation on the minions of darkness. They will also be
able to team up with friends and fight their way through the campaign,
or test their skills in the magickal arts through other challenging
modes.

In Magicka, up to four players take on a grand adventure to save their
world from certain doom using a fully dynamic spell system. The
adventure mode takes the players across three different levels,
ranging from the lush forests of mountain valleys to the frozen halls
of the Mountain King where wits and creative thinking are the keys to
victory.

In the unlockable hardcore challenge mode, players fight off waves of
enemies to earn their place on local and online leaderboards.
