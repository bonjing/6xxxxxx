,LordBastor,2011-01-25T20:12Z,I am not sure if it is from the crack or something but when I do the very first quest objective to heal myself I am already at full HP so I can't continue onward. 
,AFinalDate,2011-01-25T20:31Z,"LordBastor, are you using any cheats? Sometimes that can cause an interruption and halt progression.

Way to go Skidrow. Released 39 minutes ago. +1"
[T],rlf-rls,2011-01-25T20:56Z,"Take your sword, go to the red rope, hold shift and cut the rope clicking the mouse button. Btw the game was released 2h 37m ago :) "
,Randomness65535,2011-01-25T21:46Z,"Downloading atm.
The torrent is legit but some people are saying it's full of errors/bugs, missing texts, some people can't even get past the tutorial. Not sure if it's skid's fault or the developers'.

Oh well, downloading anyway."
,magicka0,2011-01-25T22:24Z,"Hi, thanks a lot for this quick release!

I got the same problem with the tutorial, you dont take any damage from the fall. I played the tutorial on the Steam Demo instead of cutting the rope (i didnt even know how to use the sword). Then i skipped the tutorial in this cracked version by pressing Banana!.

The text is a bit squirky indeed (misaligned, the '-' is a weird sign, etc.) but i havent seen any missing text yet.

I also experience stuttering on full screen, which is solved by playing in windowed mode."
,dafury,2011-01-25T23:34Z,how can u play multiplayer? it freezes everytime when i select new campaing -.-
,elessarGObonzo,2011-01-26T05:10Z,"is it supposed to be other language with english subtitles? that and the text having lots of @ and other signs intermittently are problems i've had. game plays smooth, graphically has run fine so far."
,ParanoiaComplex,2011-01-26T05:49Z,"I can't seem to get it to work. I just installed it and copied the crack over, but it crashes when I try to run it. I'll try to reinstall"
,ParanoiaComplex,2011-01-26T05:55Z,"Ok, it's fine. Forgot to check all of the boxes after I installed the game itself. So far it works great"
,Thebigcheese99,2011-01-26T06:13Z,So ya I'm stuck in Step 4 :'( Can someone please elaborate this part a little more for me :)
,njdss4,2011-01-26T06:34Z,"I followed all the instructions, but the game crashes when I start the game.  I tried reinstalling and installing DirectX, .Net Framework, etc. when asked at the end of installing the game but that didn't help.  Please help me get this game to work!"
,Thebigcheese99,2011-01-26T07:03Z,Well I managed To get the game on but no i'm having the same problem as njdss4
,xtr0v2,2011-01-26T07:25Z,"Support this game by buying it! The devs have been working very hard to get it done! 

The game is not made by a big corporation, but by a couple of guys in a garage like yourself!

Also, if you buy it you would get the newest patches that fixes all the problems that you are having."
,Thebigcheese99,2011-01-26T08:35Z,Well I'd like to try out the game myself :) But I don't have steam and Idunno if there is a demo
,Digger77,2011-01-26T09:31Z,"Wish i could have Steam :( So far ill be playing this pirate version but whenever the box version will come to my stores i will buy it. This guys really deserve some respect. Making games, especialy by small team is very hard. And those guys are soo great. Ive been lurking their forums for months. This is the first time when i have regrets downloading a pirate version of a game."
,Donaban,2011-01-26T14:04Z,"After I installed the game and every other program and copied the cracked content, the game won't start! Every time I try to start it it does nothing but create a text file in it's folder called ""errorReport"" with the time and date. the content of the file is:

,Holloway0,2011-01-26T15:42Z,So did someone manage to get it working online or lan?
,darkbackground,2011-01-26T18:02Z,only 10 dollars to buy. if you like it BUY IT so the small Swedish indie developers of only 8(!) people can continue to support it and so you an try it online :) 
,joaodaher,2011-01-26T22:27Z,"The game was crashing here too (Win7 x64), so I update the game with SKIDROW UPDATE 1 and a set ""Windows XP SP3 compatibility"" to run the game. Now it's working great! =D"
,magicka0,2011-01-27T00:01Z,"Guys, the games industry is not dead because of illegal copies. These devs are making great cash: ""Paradox Interactive has announced that Magicka, an action-adventure title based on Norse mythology, has sold over 30,000 copies across all digital download platforms in less than 24hrs, and is currently on the number one bestselling game on Steam."""
,kevroman,2011-01-27T08:43Z,"For those of you who have the crash on startup error (with or without update 1), reinstall XNA Framework 3.1. Worked for me.
Has anyone figured out how to start a LAN-game by the way?"
,Nemase,2011-01-27T10:08Z,"I cant get mine to work, ive done all that you said but it wont even launch it...."
,joaodaher,2011-01-27T15:41Z,I still can't play on LAN... Anyone made it work? Any idea?
,tj0013,2011-01-28T03:25Z,hey guys i need sum help with step 4 its got my stuck
,tj0013,2011-01-28T03:26Z,i cant get past step 4 can sum1 help
,loongear,2011-01-29T11:16Z,"Part 6 of the install notes says: Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!

Take this into consideration everyone. Support the devs if you really like their work."
,173125411,2011-01-30T00:40Z,"WOW ! You guys are hilarious.

Support them just because they are a small company ? Even though they released a game with shitload of bugs and other crap. Game is great itself, but if they release UNFINISHED game, they can take it up their arse - they dont deserve it, untill they fix it."
,Nemase,2011-02-01T08:45Z,"I got a problem. This is what i did, step for step.

I downloaded the torrent, installed the game, checked all boxes for installing those other programs too (some didnt wanna install) i go to the SKIDROW folder and copy all files and put them into the general game folder, i also downloaded the crack seperatly and put all those files in. Whenever i double click the Magicka program file, it crashes. What did i do wrong?"
,loongear,2011-02-01T11:17Z,"@173125411 Dude if you read carefully, you will notice that I wrote ""... if you really like their work."" Of course, noone is asking or making you to buy a buggy product even if it is a small indie developer in question. "
,blacktener,2011-02-03T20:03Z,nemase I have the same problem. If you will solve it then tell here
,XxBranikanxX,2011-02-12T02:13Z,just a bit of a warning SpySweeper found a System Monitor in this....donno if its a false positive or not but im not taking a chance
,Ifyouare,2011-02-16T13:34Z,"I've done torrents tons of time, but this one isn't working. Everytime I click it, it just says ""Program has stopped working"" I've tried everything and nothing is working. What do I do?"
,exydos91,2011-02-22T21:46Z,"I'm having big problems. And if anyone have the same problems, i would be happy for the answer to solve it.

When i start the game, it close after about 20 sec or so. I never reach the menu before it close. I have installed the game and all its content. Then uninstalled it and re-installed it, but it is the same. If anyone has the same problem or any idea on how to solve that problem, i'll be happy."
,ArcaelFavol,2011-02-26T23:02Z,"The game is not working for me, each time i try to run it it only opens a window telling me the game stoppedworking. i followed each steps carefully but it still won't work... What should i do? can someone help me?"
,ArcaelFavol,2011-02-26T23:15Z,"The game is not working for me, each time i try to run it it only opens a window telling me the game stopped working. And i also downloaded the crack document from the website and when i copy/pasted the files in the main folder, the message stopped but nothing happens at all! I followed each steps carefully but it still won't work... What should i do? can someone help me?"
,roflpimp,2011-03-12T06:20Z,Didn't mount the image did you? Idiots.
,M0053,2011-03-27T07:04Z,"Utter shit: most skidrow releases ain't too bad, but this is nothing more than shit. Followed the instructions to the letter, and nothing. I downloaded the Microsoft files that it wanted thinking maybe there was something wrong with that...nothing. Will not work at all. Fuck this release, I'll wait for someone who knows what the fuck they're doing to upload it."
,kiwi810,2011-04-19T21:33Z,THX
,Zero771,2011-05-24T02:10Z,"@loongear
I get that supporting indie game companies is important but if the game isn't even working for them in the first place NOW what is the point of buying it. Some people don't have the money to buy a game, not to mention the fact that multiplayer is a big factor of purchasing a game and if the people here enjoy the game they will BUY IT IF THEY HAVE THE MONEY. I'm only getting it cause I don't have the money. Shut the fuck up already."
,H.M.M,2011-07-05T21:48Z,If you are so fucking poor you can not afford a game that costs 3.50$ then you really should have other priorities than downloading torrents.
