Gargoyles (1972)

A terrifying tale of ancient evil unfolds as an anthropologist and his daughter battle to save the Earth from being taken over by a clan of grotesque, demon-like gargoyles they\'ve discovered living in the desert. Arguably one of the best horror movies ever made for TV, though this DVD release is from the uncut European theatrical version. Award-winning special effects by Stan Winston (Jurrasic Park, Terminator 2) and Milt Rice (Invasion of the Body Snatchers- 1956, magic Sword).

Note: Mastered from longer European theatrical version.

FYI: Bernie Casey might be hard to recognize as the head gargoyle under all that make-up and also watch for Richard Moll as Goliath...one of the other gargoyles.
