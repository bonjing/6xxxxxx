Malandro Records was an American record label which released albums by respected Brazilian groups and musicians.  The music is simply wonderful.  They released about 25 albums circa the 1990s. Some of it sounds like "smooth jazz", featuring saxophones, flutes, clarinets and clean-sounding guitars. Some of its sounds like MPB. It's all great.
