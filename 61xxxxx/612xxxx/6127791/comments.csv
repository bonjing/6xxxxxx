Only in PAL at the moment.

Release dates for UK and North America

    * UK February 4, 2011

    * NA February 7, 2011

Just wait a few days and maybe the NTSC will come out before the actual release date."

,EduardoLorenzo,2011-02-13T14:57Z,"I've got a problem playing the game.

I've got wiid with system update 4.3E and burned it with speed 4x.
It shows the start menu and secure-wriststrap-part, butwhen he's loading it gives the error: Can not read disc
If I restart my wii the disc can't be read at all anymore. However, if I wait for a few hours and insert the disc again I can again get to the loading part.

Does anybody know what the problem is and how I can fix it?"
