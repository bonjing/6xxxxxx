This is a disk image under 75MB (Really, there is only 40 MB of data, I don't know why it's showing up that way on my PC) for use with low-end PCs. It is preloaded to run MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 when typing "win" at the c:\ prompt. This is NOT for installing Windows, but rather a tool used for diagnostics, since it has Norton Utilities packaged. Feel free to add any useful app and notify everyone of the changes.
