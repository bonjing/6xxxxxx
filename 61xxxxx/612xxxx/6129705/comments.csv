Please stop limiting your UL speeds, it has no real reflection on your DL speeds and, in all reality, is just a pain on everyone. So please stop."
,steveycrow,2011-02-06T10:21Z,"why are DL speeds for most of these games so low?! Films I get up to 1mb/s - games with 400+ seeders, I am lucky to get just over 100kb/s?! It says to me that game console owners are selfish loner tosspots who sit in their darkened bedrooms jerking off and smoking pot, whilst film d/loaders are more sociable and pleasant people. Seed you bunch of pricks!"

which category do you think you fit in"
,Wottsits,2011-02-10T20:35Z,"Im getting 0.9kb waste of time to try unless you got a life time may as well buy lol, nevermind worth a try :) Thanks anyway :)"
,EduardoLorenzo,2011-02-11T21:05Z,"I've got a problem playing the game:
I've got wiid with system update 4.3E.
I've burned it with speed 4x.
I inserted the disc, he gave the startmenu. I even got past the wrist strap secure part, then he was loading when he suddenly said: disc can not be read. So I reinserted the disc, but he couldn't read the disc at all anymore.
So after many tries I burned it again, which also can't be read.
Does anyone have an idea whats the problem and how I can fix this?"

So.... most people call there things by, ""She"". 

Example;

This car is a b-e-a-utiful thing. ""She"" has some major ponies under ""her""

Now, let put in ""he"" instead of ""her"".

lol

,masterangler,2011-02-19T15:39Z,"my download speed was good ( usually 500-600 kb/s ) however like some of the comments said on bitcomet, I was not able to play the iso file on my wii. It all went well till I put the disc in the wii and it will not load. I have a wii key2?? I hope you all have better luck, but I will not seed this any longer! Good luck all, and thanks for the many others!"
