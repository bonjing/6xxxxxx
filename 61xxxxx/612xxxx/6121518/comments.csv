,lolpp,2011-01-23T09:58Z,Seriously ??? 17GB omg
[V],Mbb15,2011-01-23T10:04Z,"lol this is 3gb more then the PS3 version, that because the PC is becoming the main game platform with the best graphics soon"
,Free-Sharing,2011-01-23T10:34Z,mbb15 sinc u know all sort of stuff tell me this. will gears of war 2/3 ever come out for pc?
[T],swebarb,2011-01-23T11:59Z,i dont think so 360 excluse.
,kimjongwil,2011-01-23T13:10Z,"wow - weird - mbb, the graphics on the PC versions depends on the computer - if u have a good enough computer then the graphics are almost always MUCH better on PC - it also depends on how the game was made and if it is optimized for PC - at minimum you can at least get much higher resolutions - the other platforms are convenient and popular so they are the standard - every platform has different exclusives and advantages."

,lucid657,2011-01-23T16:33Z,"Ok, does anybody know whether core game files are still encrypted, I wanna rip the game, but i dont want to waste my time doing so. Also, I bought the game, and the preload is 8.37gb, and uncompressed is around 11gb. "
,enduin387,2011-01-23T16:40Z,anyone else having installation issues. I used the Install_English.bat and it started up fine but then nothing happened and the .bat file then disappeared. thanks for any help in advance.
,Mindblast,2011-01-23T17:12Z,"Can ANYone who understood and got ILEFX's fix working describe a STEP BY STEP of how to do this?

I can't find the deadspace_f_activation.exe, but I can find the activation.exe...

...but my HEX editor tells me the lines that need editing do not exist.

Can anyone help me?"
,Mindblast,2011-01-23T17:13Z,"I cannot get ILEFX's fix working. 

Can anyone describe a step-by-step? Does it require a hex editor and if so which one?(and which settings...)

Any help apreciated!"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-01-23T20:13Z,"thanks ahead! been waiting for this one.

@ Mbb15 :pc has been on top for games and everything else for years. don't know where the f*ck you've been hiding."
,phebix,2011-01-23T20:47Z,"@ Mindblast: The ""deadspace_f_activation.exe"" is in (XP) ""C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Temp""

Do you think they could be different for diff languages? im using EN "
,zerkz,2011-01-23T22:26Z,"Im using EN install, and located f_activation. can't find the hex's you said though. "
,calin05,2011-01-23T22:40Z,So it's a way to make it work for now ?
,AsssKisser666,2011-01-24T00:56Z,"Best Action game I ever played. 5 of 5 score from me. Im att the end boss (on xbox360), and have enjoyed every second of it. If you liked the first game, you will absolutely love this one! I almost, almost feel ashamed that I didnt buy it as they deserve every damn penny. For me its even the best game Ive played in a long time!"
,Blackluc,2011-01-24T01:22Z,"What do we do?  Can anybody explain, I'm not sure...  It's hex?  Wich lines do I replace with what?  Anyway... Thanks, hoping to get some help ^^"
[T],swebarb,2011-01-24T16:23Z,pointless to bother before 25th  since u need the decryption keys no matter how hard u try or good are is impossible before date.
,gvazdas,2011-01-24T16:52Z,"I get an error:
The installer has encountered an unexpected error.
The error code is 1639.
Can anyone help?"
,shiverz718,2011-01-24T19:03Z,"Same error here -  When I run the English.bat I get ""The installer has encountered an unexpected error.
The error code is 1639.""
The installer doesn't unpack the .DAT's and after the error, it deletes the install.bat's
Any help?"
,shiverz718,2011-01-24T19:11Z,And also the Dead Space 2 folder when unpacked is 17.6GB - exactly the same size as the .rar's.  Am I doing sometime wrong?
,no1453,2011-01-24T19:46Z,"@ilefx - found deadspace_f_activation.exe, but it doesn't go up to 007C2FAA.  Mine ends at 00738557 hex.   ?"
,angryhawk55,2011-01-24T20:41Z,"@gvazdas

you have to paste the entire folder of the game en install from di9sk 1 ea setup, don't touch anything else"
,Blackluc,2011-01-24T22:28Z,"I think everything is installed fine and now I'm looking forward to the activation...  Where the f*ck is deadspace_f_activation.exe or what ever it is, I can't find it in any temps or anywhere else.  Mind giving a bit more info...?  And can anybody confirm about the hex editing?"
,Blackluc,2011-01-24T23:26Z,"Ok got the .exe but hex finishes at 73852C, anybody knows what to do?"
,ice02,2011-01-25T13:21Z,"I had the same problem as ""gvazdas"" and ""shiverz718"". And i accidently deleted the source files as well. Is there anyway that i could get only the deleted .bat files???  "
,angryhawk55,2011-01-25T15:24Z,"@ice02
there's a way:
you must download the same torrent (it works if you don't remove folder game in the incoming folder (""ares"" bittorrent"" ) and before start to download again check only the files than you lost, it take only 1 minutes or 2 to finish download.
when you get the files taht you missed again install the game again using the ""EAsetup"" in ""DISK1"" folder"
,angryhawk55,2011-01-25T15:26Z,holly mother of fuck!! why i can't see my comments!!!
,gvazdas,2011-01-25T19:01Z,"Hey guys, I know how to fix the 1639 error:
go to your preferred install.bat (for example english.bat)
Right-click and edit with NotePad.
Change the world -silence- with -quiet-
It should work now."
,shiverz718,2011-01-25T19:11Z,@gvazdas -  err this is not a fix.. it's the same thing as opening EAsetup.exe - The installation folder is still only 10 megabytes and the DS2DAT files are NOT extracted.
,cyborg34573,2011-01-25T19:41Z,"Lol exactly. Installing the game using the batch files and EaSetup doesnt make a difference. People expect the DAT files to be extracted in installation but its not like that.

The DAT files will decrypt/extract when the games cd-key is activated online. Thats the DRM protection.

We need to wait for a crack that somehow lets us decrypt the files in order to play."
,shiverz718,2011-01-25T20:10Z,@cyborg34573 - Gotcha.. Thanks.
,moz912,2011-01-25T23:52Z,I replaced the main exe file with us decrypted exe file and now goes straight to activation... I guess that means more waiting...

,Erstok,2011-01-28T07:28Z,"If homebrew can be made for PS3, if games like Assassins Creed 2 or even any other damn game where developers claimed it couldn't be cracked, were all cracked within a matter of time.  What makes Dead Space 2 any different?  Nothing what so ever.  Now if you'll excuse me going to play Wii on my computer while listening to downloaded music and jacking off to free porn, because once it's on the internet.  It's free for any and all people to debase and use as they see fit."
