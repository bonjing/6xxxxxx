A short word from the authorÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Âª

Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´I donÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³t believe this guide needs a Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£sales pitchÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³, to be honest, but if I had to describe the eBook?

IÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ve written it in a way which is easy-to-digest and relatable to everyone Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ afterall, thereÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s absolutely no use telling people something that they need to read twelve times to understand.Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥

Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´FM2011 is a game reaching to be as accurate a simulation as possible; itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s not an arcade game anymore. You can no longer be successful under the old Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£click, click, click and play a matchÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ mentality; so, if you want to be good at this game and get the benefits from understanding it, you need to grasp the real concept of football management Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ and this is what the eBook aims to provide.

Ultimately, I just hope people enjoy reading it and learn how to enjoy their games like I do.Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥

Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´This unofficial guide contains everything which the official manual should. Wonderkid has done well to give familiar users a reference to help refine their knowledge about the game Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ but it also gives new and casual users a foundation to get to grips with what is become a more and more complex game each year something that has hugely been missed officially in the past.Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ - Thomas Levin, Football Manager blogger at FM Pundit


Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´I have read through the book and loved it. One of the best things about the book though is that it has been organised in a way that you can easily find what your looking for, by looking at the contents for a specific section of just using the search tool. The Ultimate FM Walkthrough Guide really does what it says, and will be useful to all fans of the game, just like me.Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ - Daniel Monksfield, Football Manager blogger at Aid The Boss
