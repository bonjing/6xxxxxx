,Fallerup,2011-02-05T07:36Z,"having watched the first 5 minutes of this movie, my conclusion is that, for a telesync, this is ok. But lets face it, the quality is terrible. I've watched better telesyncs than this to be honest. If you want an example of a superb telesync, here is one: 

Avatar 2009 TELESYNC H264 AAC-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release) 

very good, a pure 10, just for being what it is, but, then again, it also fills 2.11 GB.

But since I've downloaded it already, I'm gonna watch it all, I hope the rest of the movie is better than the first dark scened 5 minutes, otherwise, I would wait a little longer if I were you. the audio is very good, thats all I'm gonna say for ow, will comment again when I've finished watching. "
,Fallerup,2011-02-05T09:13Z,"I stand by what I said.

the dark scenes are unwatchable, they are blurry and of course dark, when you have both of those you cannot see anything. This however is not the case everywhere, as the sample shows. The Scenes that are not dark are very watchable. The sound quality is very good. So my final rate I'd say A:7-8 V:2 and 6 (2 being the dark and 6 being the light scenes).

the sample should have shown the first 5 minutes of the movie, but what is does, is show right after that, which is very watchable. 

you usually make very nice copies Ray, this however is bad. "

,Cgoff87,2011-02-26T21:35Z,"Thank you Team Serenity serenity for the rip, and thank you raymond for the up. Good quality worth the download, unless your an HD fanatic. regardless it did the job for me.

:Satisfied:"
,Cgoff87,2011-02-26T21:48Z,"@Fallerup You are seriously trippin. The first five minutes during the hanging of the witches was an all light scene, very well lit might I add. After that it goes into a dark scene by the bridge but only for about 2 minutes, and it wasn't that bad.

 Next time, increase your brightness and don't bitch. If not do a better job yourself nextime, or don't expect shit. Hell go buy the movie then you cheap fuck, you can't bitch about free that bad, and this is not nearly the worst I've seen."
,Joseph2dogs,2011-03-01T04:40Z,not a great movie but great download thank you raymondhome always a wonderful job.
