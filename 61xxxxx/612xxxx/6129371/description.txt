ZOOT SIMS FOR LADY DAY
Release Date: January 1, 1991 
Label: Pablo Records
Format:Flac

Tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims and pianist Jimmy Rowles\' tribute to Billie Holiday is melodic, tasteful, and largely memorable. Together with bassist George Mraz and drummer Jackie Williams back in 1978, they perform 11 songs associated with Holiday, including quite a few that would have been lost in obscurity if Lady Day had not uplifted them with her recordings. Highlights include \"Easy Living,\" \"Some Other Spring,\" \"I Cried for You,\" \"Body and Soul,\" and \"You\'re My Thrill.\" A lyrical and heartfelt tribute.
