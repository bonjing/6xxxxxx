Entpacking the RAR again delivers an MDF â€“ MDS image like in the other torrent here. A format that unfortunately cannot be burned to DVD using the standard burn software like the one integrated in Windows or Nero. Requires software installed like Alcohol or a special freeware.
I donÂ´t want to overload my PC by installing again another mounting/burning software. But it is possible to extract that MDF using unpacking software (such as 7 ZIP) which is usually required and installed in any PC.
Unpacking the MDF delivered the following files:
EUROPA_10600_2413.DB
GPS222.DB
kN101EUx08R2G32d.DB_
kN101EUx08t01.DB_
SPE060504EUWS3.db
Burnt the files using standard burn software such as Nero on a simple DVD, inserted it into my Audi â€“ works fine!"

Same thing applies for this here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6127525/Audi_MMI_high_2G_Navi_2011_Europe 

Its the same file (MDF/MDS image) just smaller in size as it comes as a RAR"
