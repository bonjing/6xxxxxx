,jaanek20,2011-02-25T23:54Z,"thanks dude. i'll seed for a while.
i downloaded source and i could play over a month, then i couldn't play any server. update problem i think."
,Spamalt,2011-02-26T08:22Z,"I install and update fine, but when I try to run it, it comes up with 'No permissions to run 'cstrike'. I'm using Vista 32 bit if that helps."
,bisops,2011-02-26T13:34Z,hi it search only some server 120 - 130
,Spamalt,2011-02-27T01:23Z,"Doesnt let me run as admin, the option doesnt even come up."
,Spamalt,2011-02-28T11:42Z,"I think it might be steam blocking it? Because every time after the error comes up, there's the steam ending advert."
,Spamalt,2011-02-28T11:44Z,"Nvm I found out why, thanks for uploading."
