In September 2010 Emma's Imagination was the winner of Sky 1's Must Be The Music, a TV series aimed at discovering genuine musical talent. Entering the competition on a whim after walking past the local auditions in Glasgow, singer-songwriter Emma Gillespie, performing for the show as Emma's Imagination, consistently wowed the judges; Dizzee Rascal, Jamie Cullum and Sharleen Spiteri--and became the audience favourite with performances of self-penned songs "Focus" and "This Day" during the show's live final at Wembley Arena. The show offered a cash prize rather than a recording deal but, having caught the attention of both Gary Barlow and Polydor President Ferdy Unger-Hamilton--who describes her as a 'brilliant, original artist'--Emma signed to Polydor/Future Records. She recorded Stand Still in London with producer Martin Terefe (KT Tunstall, James Morrison). The album displays a lusher sound on some of the tracks, giving them the fullness Emma always heard in her head when playing them on her guitar.
