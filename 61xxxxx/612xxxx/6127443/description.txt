user review

One of the reviews I once read of this marvellous film dismissed it as \'kohl and overacting\'. No way. It has so many scenes that live in the memory as I write, not having revisited the movie for quite some time. The wedding sequence with all its lights; Guinevere, beautiful in her wonder of the magical land where leaves \'blow away altogether, at night, of course\'; If Ever I Should Leave You (not sung by Franco Nero, as I understand, really, but you\'d never guess); How To Handle A Woman (\'what\'s wrong, Jenny? where are you these days? I don\'t understand you ...\'); creepy Mordred; and the ending (run, boy, run) which is terrific. I have heard Burton as Arthur and have to say I was disappointed. They made the right casting choice for the movie. A pity some of the songs got cut (except it would have been even longer then, good for us who like it, intolerable for those who don\'t). Also interesting to compare with other Lerner/Loewe movies with their themes of magic, understanding, and change (My Fair Lady, Brigadoon, Gigi and Paint Your Wagon). As they sit together as a body, Camelot is one of the best.
