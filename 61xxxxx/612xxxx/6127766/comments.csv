and poeticile i didnt understand the last 5 point. what does it mean * hint for increasing performances???

,danielsonjam,2011-01-26T23:16Z,i put it in the wrapper and this shit is not working i got to the main menu and then tried to start the game all i see is the fps in the top left for like 20 min 
,Poeticile,2011-01-27T03:02Z,"@swabibek:

When you download a .dmg file, double click it. It will mount on your desktop, and a file like a flash drive will pop up on your screen. Double click that, and the application should be inside, ready to play...

@danielsonjam:

? - Just drag into applications, click and play....and some computer specs would be good, other than just some random bashing... 

Yes, the load time is long. Mine was eight to ten minutes for the first launch. Other took about 1-5. "
,MacManJr.,2011-01-27T05:58Z,how do i get to config... i don't understand it :P where is it?
,Poeticile,2011-01-27T07:19Z,"It should be placed in the directory as :

,vichetmeng,2011-01-27T11:25Z,"I can open the game. In main menu, i can run the game at very good fps, 120 fps. but after I start the game, it stuck at the black screen, like, forever. Helps."

,vichetmeng,2011-01-27T11:34Z,I just realize that the game is only weight 4.5 gb? I thought the window version of the game is already 6-7 gb? I think we all stuck at the black screen after start the game is because the window version of the game in the wrapper doesn't have its full contents.
,Xsdeaf,2011-01-27T18:24Z,"it plays pretty well in the new wrapper...but in the first mission, i have to use a knife and knife is mmb! how do i use mmb onna trackpad?"
,Poeticile,2011-01-28T00:33Z,"Note from Dem. : On my iMac (late 2007) 2.4 GHz, ATI HD2600 256 MB, 4GB RAM, OS X 10.6.5 I have average 15 FPS in 1024x768 LOW and 10 FPS in 1920x1200 LOW - not great but playable on old Mac.

First game scene (and first Aurora mission in general) is very effects-intensive (bombing, etc.) - just landing on the beach I get 20-25 FPS in 1024x768 LOW when looking to the sea and 5-7 FPS when looking to the shore. The FPS value will increase when you leave trenches and go into the woods.

You can enable onscreen FPS counter with ""ShowFPS"" = ""Y"" in the 'Ñonfig' file (~:Library:Preferences:BFBC2 Preferences:config).
NOTE: ~:Library:Preferences:BFBC2 Preferences folder is created after first run.

Tweaking config's [d3dgl] parameters may disable some effects (shadows, smoke, fire, waterfalls, ...) increasing your FPS but it is card dependent.

The performance can be a bit low as most ingame effects are enabled in Cider's 'config' from the very start.

'Fan goes nuts.' - should be coincidance.

As for your MacBookPro/ NVidia/10.6.6 case I should probably ask other PortingTeam members to test for this crash - don't have it. Till now I got such confirmation reports on NVidia/10.6.x:

,rambambula,2011-01-29T13:26Z,"Lags bad on my iMac. Tried everything included in instructions. No luck. I'm guessing it should be run on an nVidia machine rather than an ATI. It's good as long as I don't have too much land infront of me ( excellent fps when I'm looking on the ground ), but as I look toward where I'm going it starts laggin enough to be unplayable. I had the same problem on a PC back when COD5 came out, solved it by getting a new Graph-card...which isn't really possible in this case...

Once I restored the backup file I got FPS around 15-20, sometimes around 10 which is barely playable. Still gonna try some things though."

,potah,2011-02-09T09:07Z,"First of all, Thanks a lot for this torrent!
I have a Mac Pro 8-core 2,8 and a the new Ati Radeon 5770 and Snow Leopard installed.
So i thought that i would get better fps than the MBPÂ´s but i cant say that i did, i played it in 1600*1200 on my Dell U2711, 2560*1440 was not playable at all of course.
I got at most around 25 but mostly around 10-15fps.
Playable but mostly frustrating. So i guess i should really install Bootcamp and play games in windows instead. :)
But thanks for the torrent!"

,Andrewskoff,2011-04-30T23:19Z,"@dustin
I already purchased it in the windows store like i mentioned above. It did not ask me for serial but i logged into my EA account and retrieved my profile perfectly.

I'd be glad to try it out and let you know how it works."

The fans kick in instantly when the game launches and I'm getting extremely low FPS making it unplayable even with the lowest settings set in Advanced mode.  I also tried multiplayer, I have a genuine account because I have it on my Windows PC.  I agree with Andrewskoff, the server list doesn't appear even after enabling punkbuster and other options.  All I receive is the loading of death icon lasting forever."
