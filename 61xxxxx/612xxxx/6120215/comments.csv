,jixepo,2011-02-11T16:17Z,"hey when i play this movie it gets interrupted several times, tried this with 3 diff. dvd players (vlc, windows media plater & nero). the screen gets often blurred (spots appear on the screen) and sometimes the movie even gets stuck (not the audio, but just the screen)...what's wrong? this is my 1st blu-ray dowload so dunno if i need any extra software or...?"
,chowchig,2011-02-11T22:34Z,"@Jix 

Your computer may not be capable of running blu-ray try getting a computer with better specs. (More ram better processor etc.)"
,-Cortex-,2011-02-16T18:50Z,"@TPBComment This encode has 5 channel audio, rather than stereo. Your player is not downmixing the five tracks in to two, so you're not hearing sound from all channels. Try VLC, it will downmix automatically.

@mathaithepirate Someone got hold of a bluray before distribution, the actual discs are produced in advance to make sure there is enough to meet demand on release date.

@chowchig 'blu-ray' is not a format, per-say, it's a set of standards. Their computer cannot handle high-bitrate high-profile x264. It's not that their computer 'can't play bluray'."

I've had a few issues with newer mkv releases using mkv2vob for the PS3. You may need to re-mux the mkv into two separate mkv files using mkvtoolnix, then run those two new mkv's through mkv2vob.
