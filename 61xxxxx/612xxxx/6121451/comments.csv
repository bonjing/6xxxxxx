,erinkrysta,2011-01-30T22:35Z,How do i copy it to my harddrive if its say file is to big i think is the psarc file any help?
,mylifesux,2011-02-01T05:13Z,First you need to format the 1TB HDD to a FAT 32. Then using the PS3 splitter file you need to split it because there are files larger then 4GB and it wont copy to the 1TB HDD. Then after you split the file and copy it to your External you need to copy it to your internal for it to work properly.Use open manager or Multiman on your PS3.

,Beowulf1211,2011-07-30T23:19Z,"Guys, this game ONLY works for me ONE way. Install this game on External HDD. Then start Multiman 2.00 above. Go to the XMB menu of Multiman and change settings to Hermes. Google it if you don't know how to. After restart of MM, click X on ur game. allow multiman to ""Pre-process your game""
Thats it."
