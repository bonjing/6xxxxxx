Man made climate change is so easy to disprove a 6th grader can do it.

Photosynthesis

or: Plants love CO2 so much the eat it 

Every 5th grader know that plants live of CO2 and create oxygen , most fertilizers are CO2 based and it help plants to grow more rapidly.

The more CO2 in the atmosphere the more plant grows with in turn consume CO2 and produce oxygen.

Now this fact alone is an instant game set and match win for us who are interested in real science where sound scientific methods are more important than this para religious alchemy the IPPC tries to sell to people in order to finance the NWO trough CO2 taxes with are not payed to you government but to the UN.

Climategate

Ask yourself the following question: Why would the UN/IPPC lie like we have proven they do in the Climategate scandal if they had any evidence to support their claim? Another game, set and match win for real scientists.

CO2 emission of an human being.

A human being produces 3 times as much CO2 just by breathing than a middle class. car does during its lifespan. Cows and larger mamals much more.

Again a game, set and match win for real scientists.

I could go on and on, but so called science has entered the fringe and metaphysic realm where scientific evidence created by observable facts are no longer needed or even wanted. This is called alchemy something we should have left in the middle ages where it belongs.

The Alchemists are claiming things like that nothing exploded in a giant nuclear explosion and created everything, real science does not approve of such nonsense.

They are further more claiming that a single cell organism evolved from a soup called the primordial soup with they cock from stones, water and lighting-strikes.

Get a grip and stop this religious crap folks, don't believe the hype the NWO wants to brainwash you with. Stick to science facts, observable science instead of believing in alchemy."

Sorry dude, you're not seeing the big picture, cars don't only produce CO2, there are other pretty nasty compounds in there. I'm pretty sure humans can revive each other via expelled breath but I'm not sure pumping exhaust fumes into your lungs would help much. 

I'd recommend you stick to the fifth grader science you enjoy quoting, it seems to be the right level for you.

You clearly didn't pass the 9th grade, so attacking the science you so readily ignore.


""Every 5th grader know that plants live of CO2 and create oxygen...""

The thing you didn't mention is that plants also produce CO2 through respiration. The net absorption of CO2 of plants is very low, as both processes do a good job at cancelling each other out.

Photosynthesis:
6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l) ----(light, chlorophyll)--> C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(g)

Respiration:
C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(g) -----> 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l)

Presenting just one process and not the full picture is the same reason you allow yourself to believe the warming process of Earth is entirely natural. It is clear from observable, empirical evidence that CO2 has an effect on temperature.   It is not the only source of warming, as climate models show, and there are many natural causes of the global warming trends we are observing. These natural phenomena (Milankovitch cycles, et cetera), however, can't be changed. We can't control these natural processes. We can control our output of CO2, and if we do we can lessen the effect of climate change.


""A human being produces 3 times as much CO2 just by breathing than a middle class. car does during its lifespan...""

Again, we can't control our breathing, nor can we make it more efficient. We can control our use of CO2 producing cars, we can also improve them using SCIENCE so they produce less CO2. Also, saying that humans produce a lot of CO2 compared to cars does nothing to reduce the credibility of the science of climate change, nor does it give any leverage to deniers. (Except in your twisted mind).


""The Alchemists are claiming things like that nothing exploded in a giant nuclear explosion and created everything, real science does not approve of such nonsense.""

First of all, it wasn't a nuclear explosion.
Secondly, The cosmological expansion theory is REAL SCIENCE. It is based on real, observable evidence. Hubble observed the red shifting of planets and concluded that galaxies are travelling away from us, and they are doing so in proportion to their distance from us. This means that the universe is expanding. If we follow this expansion back in time we conclude that the universe must have started off as a single point.
Cosmic background radiation also supports this theory.


""They are further more claiming that a single cell organism evolved from a soup called the primordial soup with they cock from stones, water and lighting-strikes.""

I'm not quite sure what you're trying to prove here. Abiogenesis is the only reasonable explanation for the origin of life. Why are you so pissed off that science is trying to explain things about the natural world? ""God did it."" is not reasonable. Next patient please.


""Get a grip and stop this religious crap folks, don't believe the hype the NWO wants to brainwash you with. Stick to science facts, observable science instead of believing in alchemy.""

I will stick to my ""science facts"". The fact is CO2 increases global temperature; average temperatures have climbed 0.8 degree Celsius around the world since 1880 and this rate of warming is increasing; glaciers and mountain snows are rapidly melting; coral bleaching is real and people like you exist.

97% of published scientists believe global warming is real. If you had cancer and went to 30 doctors, would you listen to the 29 of them that tell you to get treatment, or would you listen to the 1 that tells you to ignore the problem? 

At the end of the day, facts will prevail. The comments section is not made for you to engage in rampant anti-scientific propaganda, it is there so people can comment on the torrent and it's content. (And slap the shit out of nonsensical, frivolous lunatics).

Cool torrent, A++"
