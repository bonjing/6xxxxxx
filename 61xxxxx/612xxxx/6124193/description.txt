This mini-album consists of eight tracks. The title track as Richmond fontaine fans will know is one of the stand out tracks from the "13 Cities" album. Obviously those who have the album might question whether this collection is worth buying,the answer is resoundingly-yes. the other seven tracks show a number of the different faces of a quite remarkable band
