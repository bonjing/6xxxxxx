,scissored,2011-02-16T15:11Z,"The last episode is missing the audio, otherwise fabulous torrent!"
,IllogicalGamer,2011-02-24T03:14Z,"Downloading currently, more seeds would be great! 

I will seed forever once this finishes, I will also leave A/V Ratings. "
,Tash_Alistair,2011-03-18T12:14Z,"sorry, yes, japanese audio and english subs, sorry about the last episode, it is working for me, but i will re encode it and update this torrent asap."
,Tash_Alistair,2011-04-12T20:53Z,"okay, all audio is working for all eps., use Media player classic or vlc (i use classic) ALSO! episode 6, i dont know what happened, but you have to go into options, and select subtitles, and then tic english. sorry for the that one, but it all works. "
,iRed,2011-04-19T10:18Z,None of them worked for me... and the language was japanese and the only subtitle option I got was japanese.
,EnigmaSpirit,2011-05-18T23:11Z,Ok...where are the english subtitles? I'm not understanding a single thing...
,EnigmaSpirit,2011-05-18T23:18Z,I didn't understand a single thing! Where are the english subtitles?!?!
,Tash_Alistair,2011-05-30T21:09Z,"alright... to people getting the ""no subtitles problem"" i believe this may be an issue on your ends, i would suggest using either Windows media player classic, or vlc media player. i had the same problem with the no subtitles for one episode, all i had to do was go into MPC under options, then video and subtitle options, select the first choice. then you are all set, as for the other episodes not having subtitles, this is the first i have heard of this. i suggest re downloading the files, as something may have gotten corrupted on your end. for troubleshooting sake, i am removing the ones i am seeding, and re downloading this one. if there are any errors, it will be fixed promptly."
,FluffyBunyAlpha,2011-06-16T02:31Z,"@Tash_Alistair
 you seem to be one of the few that acctually give a damn about the people your uploading for. I respect people like you. great upload, thanks"
,RengokuNoTenshi,2011-07-17T21:30Z,"I didn't have the subtitles in any .mkv movie either, however my problem was solved by downloaden the k-lite codec pack.
Maybe something to try too :)"
,Takucei,2011-09-01T08:44Z,"Language: Japanese
Subtitles: (soft) English"
,Tash_Alistair,2011-10-07T04:18Z,"Just wanted to say that having the k-lie codec pack is probably the best thing you can watch your videos with, not just this torrent. also, a big thank you to all of the people helping me seed this."
,Arenennas,2011-10-22T03:06Z,Hi! Does anyone know if this is in 480p or 720p?
,Tash-Alistair,2011-12-02T01:56Z,"Sorry guys, i need to re-DL this, TPB for some reason will not let me log into my account, so i had to create a new one, i will be doing this for all of my torrents, i am truly sorry for the inconvenience."
,fairy12me,2012-02-21T11:52Z,"The only file with problem is episode 5 ([SubDesu] Kuroshitsuji II - 05 [1280x720][46CBD82D])
In real player, windows media player and windows media player classic the audio is fine while there is no video. In media player and nero show time essentials, the file cant be played at all. In gom player there are no sub titles though the video and the audio is fine. I tried choosing from the subtiltles option, but no matter which caption I choose ( there are three) the subtitles does not show up. In vlc media player the video and sub titles show up but no audio. I use windows xp by the way. Please could help me out? I really want to see this episode properly."
,blackrose565,2012-04-01T14:18Z,"do you think you can upload this in avi format? i have hamster video converter and i tried to convert to avi format but when i tried to play them on my ps3 like a regular avi file, it says the data was corrupted. >."
,chuck606,2012-05-07T22:23Z,Tash-Alistair if you have the raw iso can please upload it or do you maybe know where I can get it?
,Saiya1093,2012-06-01T14:22Z,Thank you for the Upload ... ^ ^
