They delete anything and everything that is unlawful, obscene, or against their wishes.

My suggestions: 
leetleech - unrestricted, permanent uploads allowed."

The images generally aren't deleted, but they are blocked as links from The Pirate Bay. If you copy and paste them into your browser's address bar (or drag and drop them) they should work."
