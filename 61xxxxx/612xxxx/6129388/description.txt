ERROL GARNER CONCERT BY THE SEA
Label Columbia 
Original Year 1955
Format: Mp3@320

Garner's place in the history of jazz piano is unusual. He demonstrates no obvious influences of any other pianist, he appears to have influenced no-one; and yet his is such a thoroughly engaging, happy, always enjoyable style. Here, he deftly picks his way through a sprightly selection of songs. Throughout, the Elf happily indulges his love for lengthy introductions that defy listeners to identify the coming tune, yet, when he finally arrives at the song as the composer wrote it, everything seems just right. Ageless music in an impishly droll style that defies categorization; it's just Erroll's way.

Recorded live in Carmel, California on September 19, 1955.
