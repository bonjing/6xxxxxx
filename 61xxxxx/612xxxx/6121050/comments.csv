,Ichigo_Kurosaki,2011-01-23T11:08Z,No idea. Even the magnet link won't work.
,Ichigo_Kurosaki,2011-01-23T18:17Z,The forums are fucking worthless.

,konk684,2011-01-24T04:22Z,Got the torrents posted within the Jerry DL! Good idea ~ thx green frog!
,Ichigo_Kurosaki,2011-01-25T21:28Z,"I found a way.

Go to: http://bitsnoop.com/atk-hairy-ynez-001rwl-20-sets-q21721429.html

Download from Mirror #2 link, THEN click the Magnet Link.
It sounds, weird, I know, BUT, it worked! I was able to get the .torrent AND the tracker list and, now, I am FINALLY downloading the content.

Thanks, thegreenfrog, for the re-up."
