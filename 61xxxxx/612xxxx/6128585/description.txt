"Two men that I love are dead ... because I bought a lie,
the lie that you can get something for nothing.
Well you can get nothing for nothing...."

Years ago over lunch in Brentwood, I talked to the veteran actor, Dean 

Jagger, about his role as head of the "Bell" another Faustian Fraternity that 

was patterned after the Skull & Bones in the film Brotherhood of the Bell. 

Later still, I discussed it with Glenn Ford, his co-star in the epic piece. 

Both actors seemed unaware of how close the characters they portrayed were, 

to those who actually are members of this Cabalistic Cashist Club.
