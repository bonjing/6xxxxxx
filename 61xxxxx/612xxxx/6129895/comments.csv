,Dragonite_9,2011-04-02T23:40Z,"Can I have your attention for just a minute please! Please read this for all ours sake! 

SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte 

blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

MVH.

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

,bihsethy,2011-04-16T12:45Z,"Quality:
    +9 / -21 (-12) 

Is this torrent real 1080p (not some up-scaled version)?? Why is the quality rating so low ??"
,xcmstackerx,2011-04-17T13:15Z,Uploading speed 3.8mbit/sec and download speed 1.2mbit/sec so I dont see what you guys are talking about
,necromonyi,2011-04-20T03:59Z,"Thanks a lot!!!
This is a super contribution!!!

Let me finish it of downloading the file and i'll write again."
,white8ball,2011-04-23T00:27Z,"Amazing quality, true 1080p, but you can't turn off the subtitles..."
,necromonyi,2011-04-23T01:49Z,"Super nice!!!!
Thanks again!!!

100% quality!!!

if you dont want subtitles, just turn off the option... easy!"
,necromonyi,2011-04-23T01:50Z,use the zoom player or BS player!
,white8ball,2011-04-23T02:43Z,"Ya thanks, I just looked up mkv format on wiki. I wasn't aware that it was capable of ""storing"" multiple subtitles, videos, and audios. I'm downloading a player right now that will allow me to turn off the subtitles.
So to correct my previous statement: Amazing quality, true 1080p!"

,rob007123,2011-05-22T14:42Z,what fuck retard uploaded this i can understand some people might want a bluray rip but they could of converted it to a different 1080p format like .mkv so much easier and smaller download size
,yiannis090807,2011-05-22T22:21Z,Seed Pleaaaaaaaaaase!!!!!!!!!!!!
,bolbi6,2011-05-23T21:52Z,"Great torrent! The audio and video are both perfect. I was getting an average of around 350 kB/s with spikes of 1.1 mb/s for around a minute at a time. It was a bit slow at the end, but it's all good :)
Took a total of 2 days to download. Not too bad for 37 gigs!

I'll definitely be seeding this!"
,hustlebird,2011-05-23T23:07Z,"Thank you, I'm getting 10.1 mb down and 7.8 mb up, if you use cheat engine, choose bittorrent or whatever you use, enable speed hack and set to .1, no higher, your speed will increase about 10 times"
,hustlebird,2011-05-23T23:26Z,What happened?  No one seeding anymore except a few at like .2kb/sec
,bolbi6,2011-05-23T23:41Z,"It's because no one likes you ;)
I should be uploading at around 100 kB/s"
,hustlebird,2011-05-23T23:53Z,"Me too now, like 300 kb or so, cause not really downloading, down to 3.5 kb downloading, uploading everything else around 5 mb for some reason though.  "
,bolbi6,2011-05-24T00:00Z,"Actually, I think someone fucked with the trackers..."
,hustlebird,2011-05-24T00:12Z,"Maybe, getting a little better, no on uploading has 100% either"
,bolbi6,2011-05-24T00:21Z,"Anyway... I'll be seeding for a long time.

I'm almost certain someone changed the trackers. Most of them are broken...
Noobs eh?"
,hustlebird,2011-05-24T00:29Z,"Most of my trackers are ok, I updated all most reconnected, stupid noobs"
,yagiz20,2011-05-25T14:58Z,"video:10

,yagiz20,2011-05-27T13:24Z,thank you
,thibitus,2011-05-29T14:56Z,there are no seeders slow as hell 1 kb/s 
,atk444,2011-06-02T20:01Z,"Though it does seem like people are bleeding bandwidth off of others (100%downloaded but still at 1.5MB or higher) but enable IPv6, increase available global and peer connections, set upload limit to 0 (unlimited), and then update trackers...

I averaged 1.3MB/s even with all the leeches so obviously all that are bitching are experiencing a user error... And before you rant or bitch here about speed learn how to fucking configure your torrent client!

Some retards shouldn't be allowed to breed...
Thanks Uploader!"
,Cro_Cop,2011-06-09T04:44Z,"Great torrent.

so please seed"
,734Ch3r4u,2011-08-31T20:00Z,"I have not watched the movies entirely yet but did watch the beginnings of each of the 3 movies and they appear to be prefect quality.  
A=10
V=10
Judging by the Seeder to Leecher ratio, most people don't understand the importance of seeding.  Therefore I will seed to a ratio of at least 10 to make up for at least some of the douche bags out there.  Thanks to the uploader for a quality torrent."
,tielandje,2012-02-13T15:08Z,please seed!
,JohnnyJackWhite,2012-02-15T21:27Z,"PLEASE SEED it's downloading between .5 km and 2 km a second! Please fricking seed! all it takes is for you to leave your computer on! This torrent buisness doesn't work unless you pitch in, please and thank you!"
