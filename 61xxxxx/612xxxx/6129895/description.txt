Release notes:
--------------
We Love Movies.

The previous release by hV was done with a faulty mastered disc of this movie.
Several scenes had framing errors. Compare both samples or check this site:

Disney is to blame. Not hV.

SiNNERS did a -PROPER- of 720p after the corrected version was released.
We now provide a very very late -PROPER- of 1080p. Enjoy :)

due to starving the bitrate. Enjoy!
