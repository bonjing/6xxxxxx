When Alice sees the white rabbit run by, it occurs to her that she's never seen a rabbit with a watch before. Burning with curiosity, she jumps up and follows him into a rabbit-hole. Then she falls down a long way. She is down into the world of the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Duchess, the Cheshire Cat and the Mock Turtle. She is down into Wonderland, where an ordinary little girl can have the most extraordinary adventures.
