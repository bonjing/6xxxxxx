,VargaZ74,2011-01-24T19:45Z,"it's good... but best the older version (HD 480p, together MX1 and Lite)... ;-) Please, please, please...  THX!     www.mxfoto.hu "
,slicknick610,2011-01-24T22:58Z,@VargaV74 I would like that too if every race was live. When they are not live they are shown in 2 seperate hours and sometimes on 2 different stations.
,MxLuvr,2011-01-25T00:19Z,"As usual, excellent audio and video quality. Thanks for making it possible for those us without access to watch the best ever year for supercross. that talent pool is incredible. Only wish Ricky the Goat was in the mix too.

Yeah folks, CBS events are sucky due to them catering to old ladies and very young kids. This is what one has to put up with when it comes to network broadcasts, including the really lame music and boring interviews. But hey, at least they're making this accessible to elderly ladies."
,vp203,2011-01-25T10:19Z,can anyone answer when the lites will be showing?
