                       -----------------------------------

Red 7 was a short-lived rock group, formed in 1984 as a side project of Mike Rutherford (Genesis, Mike + the Mechanics). The three core members were Michael Becker, Gene Stashuk and Paul Revelli; Rutherford himself played bass on some of their songs and sang in the choir on one song, "The Way".

Red 7 recorded two albums. Their self-titled debut Red 7 was released in 1985 (MCA LP MCA-5508). Two cuts from that album were used in popular movies: "Less Than Perfect" was featured in the soundtrack to Joe Dante's 1985 film, Explorers ("Explorers: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack", MCA LP MCA-6148) .

Arguably their best-known song, "Heartbeat", was featured in Michael Mann's 1986 thriller, Manhunter.

The second album, When the Sun Goes Down (MCA LP MCA-5792) was released in 1987.

Both albums are now somewhat rare as the band lost their contract to MCA soon after the second album, and disappeared from public interest (their debut album is particularly rare, as it was only released on cassette and vinyl).



Lyrics
------

I can hear your heartbeat, knocking on the window,
I can felt the weight deep down below.

I can hear whispers,
Coming from the shadows,
Touch me like hot tan on my soul.
I can hear your tip toe,
I can hear the door close, anticipation in me grows.

Sometimes I,
Sometimes I,
Sometimes I, understand it very clearly.
Heartbeat, hearbeart, listen to my heartbeat (x4)

I can hear your tip toe,
I can hear the door close, anticipation in me grows.
I can feel your dark eyes, touch me in the darkness,
Understand the message never sent.

Sometimes I,
Sometimes I,
Sometimes I, understand it very clearly.
Heartbeat, hearbeart, listen to my heartbeat (x4)

Listen to my heartbeat. (repeated several times)
