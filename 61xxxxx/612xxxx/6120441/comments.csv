,Olly9000,2011-06-20T07:57Z,"Ah ffs Im havin the same problem, could it be cos of windows 7? or just a dodge upload. Anyone got a solution????"
,Olly9000,2011-06-20T08:07Z,"I fixed it, its the crack. All you need to do is look on the image in Support\Arch and replace the .exe file in the game directory with the one on the disk, or just use the original exe"
,olafurhh,2011-08-04T22:11Z,"I downloaded Silent hunter 5, but the drm prevented me from completing missions. So I'll just play this one instead. Loved the first game in the series. Did not know there where sequels until recently."

Many thanks, bro!!!! You are right!!!
I instaled Omega drivers and other stufs, but didn't help me. Your solution is correct.

People, do not use a crack!!! Take .exe file from image  Support\Arch and overwrite it in game dir!!!   
Thanks to uploader and Olly9000!!! 
Regards"
,Sonicbacon,2012-03-06T07:41Z,"Game works perfectly on windows 7 home. Forget about crack just update game to patch 1.4 and run game. Many thanks rokkyo, keep up the good work!"
,wutzthedeal,2012-03-26T17:28Z,"Oily9000, bingo.  Begs the question; why the crack in the first place?  Anyway, works now, although you can forget about good training, even in the tutorials.  Find out how to play on walk-through sites.  Fantastic game overall if you are the patient hunter type.  (I got pinged by a destroyer, and decided to surface fast and just confuse him; started looking through my pariscope before we even surface and I see the hull of his ship all up in my face; two torpedoes knocked him out; two more for his buddy behind him before they could even man the deck guns or get depth charges off, then I dove cuz the convoy was comin' ahahaha... good times).  (And that was a fucking training mission, sons.)"
