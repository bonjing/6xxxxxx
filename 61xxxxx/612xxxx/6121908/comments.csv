,ShadowBoss,2011-05-29T06:54Z,"for everyone who is having troubles playing the video on que with the audio, use this software called

YAAI (Yet Another Avi Info v2.0.3...might be a new release since ive downloaded it)

(as a precaution always have a copy of the video file before you edit it) you can sync the audio file with the video either by delaying or speeding up the audio or video by miliseconds, seconds, minutes, until you feel its fixed, then saving the file with the new edits play it using VLC or w.e you use, and it'll play proper. I use it all the time when necessary. and yes its a free program so no need to torrent it."
