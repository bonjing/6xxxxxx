No matter what rolled in on the tides of time, California surfing buddies Matt, Jack, and Leroy knew they'd stick together. And that they'd be ready when a rare 20 foot swell hit the coast at last...

Big Wednesday celebrates surfing as much as the most dedicated kid who ever waxed a board. It's also a fascinating 1962-1974 chronicle of friendships and lifestyles in transition. John Millius directs and co-scripts with a passion for the ultimate ride and a truthful feel for those turbulent times.
