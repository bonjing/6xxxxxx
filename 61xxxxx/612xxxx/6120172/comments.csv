,skip741,2011-01-24T08:13Z,"i have the same question as press2010,  how did any of you get this working? would u mind offering a detailed explanation to the rest of us? what is meant by ""switching to Darwin Snow.iso""?  i found no instructions included with this torrent and i am using it with the latest vmware workstaion, cpu is intel q6600, but i get an error when either clicking on the easy efi icon or the osx 10.6.6 icon, which says""The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system""....help would be appreciated from either the uploader or anyone who has gotton it to work, otherwise what is the sense of bothering to upload something  thats not working. i have used many other vmware mac images with no issues at all.. thanks!"
,evilspam,2011-01-24T14:20Z,"Very good image. From my side it runs fine.

It has Darwin/x86 boot 5.0.132 - Chameleon 2.0 RC5pre12 R115 (2010/02/24).

IT runs fine on my Intel i5 machine with 2GB of ram under VMWare (win 7).

At first it was hanging on boot, but I had change the number of cores to 4 and put 1.5MB in RAM and the Mac OS 10.6.6 boots on the virtual machine fast enough.

Once you boot, I think the first thing to do is change the screen resolution. "

,luisoes,2011-01-24T19:02Z,"Hi all, yes I should have been more descriptive... the CD-ROM device of the vmware machine should point to the .iso file provided with this torrent... but since it didn`t work for me, I pointed it to the Darwin.iso included in this direct download:

After that, like evilspam, I needed to try several CPU configurations on the virtual machine to ensure that MacOsX boots properly every time I start the vm.

,skip741,2011-01-26T08:14Z,"this is to hopefully answer some questions..press2010 i have hotton other snow leopard and leopard vmare images both from here and newtorrents. as far as which its been a while since i downloaded them,they varied in size from 2.8 gig to abt 8 gigs, some can be even bigger.I think what was important was the small iso file thats included in those vmware downloads it was called darwin.iso and is abt 25 megabytes. i just copied it into the extracted directory of this torrent.there was no such darwin .iso included ,,,only the efi iso file.  once copied into the directory with the vmware files, u need to change the settings in vmworkstation to boot this darwin iso under the cd/dvd settings so it will boot from that darwin iso file..thats it!
but again ill mention that adobe flash will not work properly in 10.6.6 and will freeze browser every time u click on a link with flash requirements .. as for snow leopard torrents that Do work, id recommend any from 10.6.0,  10.6.2 all worked great for me even when updated, flash worked without issues. im sorry to not have the exact torrent names,its been a while  sinece i got them.hope all this helps"

****************************************************

Steps:

1. Install and Register VMWare Workstation 7.
2. Restart, and enable ""Hardware Virtualization."" (If you do not have this in BIOS then you cannot run image, sorry :( )
3. Download this torrent.
4. Download 7 Zip or any program like it.
5. UnZip/UnRar/Un7Zip files to a location of your choice.
6. Launch VMWare Worksation.
7. Select ""Open Existing VM or Team""
8. Browse to where you extracted files.
9. Select ""MacOs10.6.4."" (If it asks you to ""Take Ownership"" do so.)
10. First Run, do not change settings.
11. ""Power on this virtual machine.""
12. If screen opens asking you whether you ""Moved it"" or ""Copied it"" the default is the copied option but I would choose the moved option.
13. It will do some booting things.
14. When you see the empire efi screen, click on the screen so that you are ""In"" the virtual machine.
15. Press F5.
16. Using your arrow pad, hit the ""Left"" arrow to chose the ""mac"" named hard drive.
17. On arrow pad again, hit the ""Down"" arrow.
18. Go down once more to the ""Boot Verbose"" option.
19. A whole bunch of text will show. Maybe even some errors, don't sweat it!
20. Mac Screen should pop up about 60 seconds later.
21. OH NO ITS RUSSIAN!!!!!
22. On the bottom of Mac desktop, hit the gear looking icon (system preferences.)
23. In the top category select the thing that looks like a flag, should be on the far right.
24. Click and drag English to the top.
25. Go to next tab and chose the top two tabs to ""U.S. English"" and ""English (United States).""
26. Exit out of that screen.
27. Since you must log out to make changes, on main desktop page hit the Apple symbol in top left corner.
28. The ""Log Out"" option is the very last one at the bottom of the list.
29. After you log out, it will ask you for your password.

THERE IS NO PASSWORD! JUST HIT ENTER! THAT'S ALL!

Hope this helps everyone. It worked for me.

,xNameless,2011-04-18T04:19Z,"For anyone that doesn't know, this is a pre-created image to be opened with VMWare Workstation or VMWare Player (or perhaps other virtual machine programs, I'm sure).

I'm not sure how, but I got this to work by doing what emeshbi did above: change the value smc.present = ""TRUE"" to smc.present = ""FALSE"".

After that, I booted using the darwin_snow ISO downloaded elsewhere (see above comments about darwin_snow and how to use it).

After that, it worked fine. I'm afraid to shut the VM down or hibernate it, because I fear it won't work again...but that's what I did to get it to work at least once!"
,xNameless,2011-04-18T18:07Z,"Update: Still works! I'll reiterate what I did, see if it helps you:

Right-click the ""VMWare Virtual Machine"" file (the one that you would otherwise have opened within VMWare, it has the .vmx extension) and open it with WORDPAD or other basic text editor (make sure you un-check ""make this the default program"").

CTRL+F to find the command line smc.present = ""TRUE"" and change ""TRUE"" to ""FALSE""

Then, when you have the virtual machine loaded in VMWare, click ""Machine Properties"" and find the ""disk drive"" option. Select ""Use ISO"" and load ""Darwin_Snow"" WHICH YOU MUST DOWNLOAD ELSEWHERE (see above comments for more detailed instructions about Darwin_Snow ISO).

Keep in mind, to get the Machine to show up in VMWare and allow yourself to make changes, you'll probably have to try running it first, let it fail, then go back to VMWare and select the machine (Reminder: ""Machine"" means the virtual machine you're trying to make work).

When you have Darwin_Snow loaded in the Machine's disk drive, start the machine again.

When you get to the screen where Darwin_Snow and Apple logo are next to each other, highlight the Apple symbol (using the arrow keys) and scroll down to ""Load Verbose.""

After this, it worked for me, so I have no further instructions for you, I'm sorry.

If this doesn't work, try downloading the full Mac OSX 10.6.6 and installing it manually (torrent is also available here on TPB).

Good luck!"

So this is how I got it working for me. Also note, I'm running Windows 7 x64 on AMD and VMWare 7.1.4.

1 ) Download and unpack the archive to your location, add it to VMware
2 ) Because I was unable to login with the given ISO, I downloaded ""EmpireEFI4AMD.iso"".
3 ) Change the (IDE1) CD-ROM to boot with EmpireEFI4AMD.iso, not the EasyEFI v2.2 ver.3
4 ) Boot, F5 and left key over to boot
5 ) If you get to the pretty desktop, continue, otherwise this guide wont work for you
6 ) Outside of your Virtual Machine (still running though) download ""darwin_snow.iso""
7 ) Change IDE2 to darwin_snow.iso (eject if anything is there)
8 ) VMware Tools should popup on the Mac desktop. Double click and install
9 ) Continue with the forced reboot. Unmount darwin_snow.iso after reboot
10) Done.

Thanks guys for this, awesome work. Thanks to the other commenters who helped me figure this out. Hope this helps other people out there too."
