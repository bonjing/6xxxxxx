Instructions (assuming you have WinRar installed):

1) Navigate to your Application Data Folder
On Windows XP and Vista: C:\Documents and Settings\*your username here*\Application Data\Roaming
On Windows 7 C:\Users\*your username here*\AppData\Roaming

2) On a second window open the folder containing the minecraft_stratubas rar file.

3) Right click and hold the rar file, move the mouse to the application data "white area", release the mouse.

4) Left click "Extract here".

5) In your application data folder find a folder named ".minecraft" and open it.

6) Double click "MinecraftSP", insert a nickname, press "Enter Game"

Done.


Singleplayer works fine. Multiplayer works on private servers (servers that don't check if you have bought the game).
The default IP that you find if you select multiplayer is an example of such a server.


Enjoy! And please seed :-)

PS: I tested this on XP and it worked. If you encouter any problems, feel free to comment.
