This thesis, entitled "In Search of Teachers", has been written by Herman Kruijer of the University of Amsterdam's International School for Humanities and Social Sciences, and was supported by Education International. It is a report of Kruijer's research in Tanzanian primary education during the months of February until May 2008. With an interdisciplinary perspective of Educational Sciences and International Development Studies, this research focuses on the issue of shortage of teachers in primary schools in Tanzania. 

As a result of successful policies for free primary education almost all Tanzanian children are enrolled in primary schools. This is one of the causes for an urgent shortage of teachers in primary education. The aim of this research is to provide more knowledge how to attract young people to teaching and how to make them stay in the profession. The research results indicate that a lack of alternatives forced most students to enrol in teacher training colleges. Poor living and working conditions as well as professional conditions are the most important reasons for attrition of teachers. Furthermore, teachers are discouraged in their work and professional role in society, because they perceive little respect from government. Some suggestions for policies that aim to increase the number of teachers are: (a) advocacy for the improvement of professional conditions is equally important as the promotion of living and working conditions, (b) support teachers in their efforts to reclaim the profession, emphasising their authority as actor in society and (c) put teacher training at the centre of policies to improve the quantity and quality of the teaching force.
