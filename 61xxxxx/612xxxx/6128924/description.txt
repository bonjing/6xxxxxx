dimlans marvel chronology is a great piece of work. i know that the only older files missing on here are now 70, 71, and 72, and when i found 71 and 72 on another site i thought i would save dimlan a little effort (he works so hard for us after all), by upping 71 and 72 for him to this site. therefore the only gap left is no. 70 (which i'm sure he'll get around to when he has time).   many thanks for your hard work dimlan, it is much appreciated !!!
