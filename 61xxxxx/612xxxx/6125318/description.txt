Rx Notes
-----------------
Video.Source....: The.Green.Hornet.TELESYNC.German.720p.x264-PFD (Thanks!)
Audio.Source....: IMAGiNE (Thanks!)

The PFD 720p was pretty nice as was. Felt it had a little to much contrast though, so lowered that. Adjusted sat and levels slightly. Lowered the red, etc.etc. For the audio we used IMAGiNE's from their TS and synced it to our encode. Once again synced for us by our good friend m4t1, THANKS ALOT M8! Anyways hope you all Enjoy!=]
