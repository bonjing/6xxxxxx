IMAGiNE NOTES
The video was a touch dull looking and lacked some life and colour.also thought the colours were slightly off aswell. Workdone... well first thing was to filter the video so we made a script to crop,resize, sharpness, brightness, contrast and chroma. Had to crop due to the thin black border and a weird thin blurry line across the top aswell. Also then used a white balance and rgb filter. Audio now for this we used the russian for the intro and end credits then we used our own line, but there was some issue @ 12min mark so we needed to swap the audio for 30secs and then swap it back.
