All works well with the exception of PC Booster not accepting the serials provided. None of the Serial combinations work with PC Booster. The other progrms all accepted the serial combinations 

For your info:
Also after restarting the programs, they all insist on being upgraded. All the programs I updated are Okay and work fine. If you choose to not upgrade the programs, they wont start."

App can't force yo to update or upgrade, because there's nothing to upgrade.
All these apps are the latest version.
You have to block the app(s) with your firewall, and uncheck ""check for updates"" . NEVER check for updates in main screen."
