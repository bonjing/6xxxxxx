,jon4fun,2011-01-22T17:01Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers
Jon

Thanks for RT with Bill Maher, The CF show, The Ricky Gervais Show, Portlandia (sounds promising) & Fringe. Finally [10 o'Clock Live] is the reason that Ch.4 dropped The Daily Show from it's line up; haven't seen it yet so will reserve judgement.

Thanks for all your work 20-40."
,jon4fun,2011-01-22T17:13Z,"@ 20-40 - Thanks for [Let me in] also. Missed that first time looking at DL's. 

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2011-01-22T17:21Z,"@ 20-40 - and thanks for [The Middle]

Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-22T17:24Z,"Thanks.
Spartacus shouldn't be here, to be honest, there was to many insults throughout season one. I would not put this show in Schedule and we would start from there and here...

@Jon: To my surprise, I admit, 10 0 clock was very funny.

Whoever like the work of Ricky Gervais should watch the interview aired last night on CNN."
[T],houruoha,2011-01-22T17:26Z,"thanks
will try 10 O Clock Live
:)"
,coolasad,2011-01-22T17:44Z,"Thanks for Adding ""The Middle"" back in your Schedule."
