160dB's follow up album, Hawaii Live-O, was the spontaneous result of a recent binge of recording sessions located in drummer Kris's parents' spare-room [above their lounge, might I add] and was recorded one evening in the May bank holiday weekend before an outing to the pub via a cassette-tape recorder and mic, duct-taped to the wall. Present for this performance were Kris's brother and his friend, Kris's cat [deceased], long-time bike-lover Jon and possibly one or two others. In the words of the band's guitarist, Alex: "...it kinda translates as some fucked-up modern-day Let it Be idea, but with a lot of punk contained there-in. I think we went a bit overboard on The Beatles considering this is supposed to be punk, but I guess that's what some might call progression. I don't know what we're doing, really..." This really is 160dB warts and all, 100% sticky tape, no smoke, magic tricks or mirrors - just raw, rough and funny as fuck jams.
