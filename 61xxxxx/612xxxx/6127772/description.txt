RELEASE NOTES

Note to nukers:

There is nothing wrong with our previous crack for the full game, it\'s
just the developer/publisher that shouldn\'t have released a such bugged
game

Maybe seeking a little inforamtion before nuking would take the heat of
your nuker fingers, as this update fixes the problem you previously
gave as nuke reason
