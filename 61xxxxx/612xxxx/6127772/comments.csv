,elturbo9077,2011-01-26T03:52Z,already an update
,xtr0v2,2011-01-26T07:27Z,"Support this game by buying it! The devs have been working very hard to get it done! 

The game is not made by a big corporation, but by a couple of guys in a garage like yourself!

Also, if you buy it you would get the newest patches that fixes all the problems that you are having."
[T],rlf-rls,2011-01-26T10:23Z,It works for me
,zaqaz,2011-01-26T11:31Z,"It keeps closing to desktop after launch for me to, any solution?"
,motley666,2011-01-26T12:57Z,"Buy a game you cheap rascals, support some developers who work hard, they are not all like blizzard swimming in dollars."
,luuke,2011-01-26T13:32Z,you're an idiot if you don't buy this game lol it's 10$ and so badass multiplayer... 
,Holloway0,2011-01-26T15:42Z,So did someone manage to get it working online or lan?
,pero85,2011-01-26T15:56Z,"I installed magicka, then the update. Installed newest XNA Framework too. Copied crack to the install folder.
When I double click magicka.exe, game doesn't start and I got and error report 

RenderThread
Microsoft.Xna.Framework.NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException: Could not find a Direct3D device that supports the requested features...."
,pero85,2011-01-26T16:00Z,"Or do I need to have Steam on my computer? I thought this crack thing enables the game without Steam.

Please help, I waited a long time for this game, probably will buy it, but wanna try it first"
,daemon1129,2011-01-26T22:22Z,Does Lan works?
,Chiitah,2011-01-27T00:24Z,Please shut up about buying the game already. You hypocrites leech stuff for years and then cry and whine when suddenly you think someone should be supported.  Maybe all the crap you leeched and uploaded should have been supported too.  You guys finally buy one game then get all righteous about it *rolls eyes*.
,motley666,2011-01-27T01:27Z,"Chitah we buy and we leech and we upload and we don't cry, it's just that sometimes buying is a good idea you know, to keep companies alive so you can leech. Have you bought any game? When you give your money and then share then come here and show it, till then shut up."
,Cunz,2011-01-27T03:02Z,"right after launch it crashes

CLR20r3 problem, doesnt matter if i install the update or not it keeps crashing"
,pero85,2011-01-27T11:33Z,"motley666  First of all this game is rubbish. It's full of bugs and errors, and the multiplayer don't work. Many of us have problems even to start the game. And YOU are expecting from us to give them money just because they are small and they don't have millions like Blizzard or EA?? Let them first release a WORKING GAME and them we will talk about buying it. "
,motley666,2011-01-27T13:24Z,"Pero85 my comment applies as a general rule, not specifically for this game. If this is a mess then stay away and pay for something better."
,xefiik,2011-01-28T16:28Z,"Why magicka don'T work on my windows 7 64-bit

,Elfkrigen,2011-01-29T19:54Z,"If anyone wants play Via hamachi

,Elfkrigen,2011-01-29T19:56Z,"anyways, I want to test LAN

,Detkado,2011-01-29T20:39Z,"Hi,

,joshfb,2011-01-29T23:14Z,"can some one tell me if i need steam to play this, and will i get in trouble by using it on my steam account??

,Elfkrigen,2011-01-30T03:23Z,They will BAN your steam account ...
,Elfkrigen,2011-01-30T03:45Z,They will Ban you account
,joshfb,2011-01-30T04:48Z,"Well if you download this, it dont use steam.. so i dont see how unless explain??"
,Elfkrigen,2011-01-30T11:32Z,There's another version and they have alrealdy banned me

,joshfb,2011-01-30T13:12Z,well ok but its not this version though right?? cause i dont see if using my steam account at all so i dont see how??
,minalear,2011-02-02T13:59Z,"@joshfb
Yea man, stop trolling.  He's just messing with us trying not to get us to download this game.  Who knows, maybe he tried to run the game without cracking and ACTUALLY put in his steam info. LOL, then he could have had his steam account banned."
,joshfb,2011-02-03T00:51Z,"um no dip shit your wrong i did torrent copy the game then i bought the game cuz i liked it soo


keep cryin and raging me lil faggot BOO HOO

keep talkin shit bitch!!!"
,minalear,2011-02-03T14:44Z,"@joshfb
Raging you? I didn't even mean to type your name, mother fuck.  Dude, don't get pissed so easily, life will flow a lot easier.  I would pay for this game, if it wouldn't crash every time I get out of the tutorial, which is probably the game itself not the crack. 

And another thing, you asked if this would ban you steam account, and I said no.  'Elfkrigen's account probably got banned because he was retarded enough to put in his steam info."
,joshfb,2011-02-03T22:13Z,ok dude next time get your facts straight!!!
,minalear,2011-02-04T02:16Z,"Well, I'm sorry for the confusion.  I think rlf-rls would prefer us not spamming his upload, so I'll leave it at that.

As for the actual upload, really great quality and easy install.  Skidrow always comes through in the end.  Kind of sad the game itself has so many bug or I would probably actually play it."
,joshfb,2011-02-04T20:46Z,"i agree this torrent is good, but watch out for the Fakes Hench how someones account got banned all im tryin to say here, belive me if you all like!!

although ive already bought the game so what ever "
