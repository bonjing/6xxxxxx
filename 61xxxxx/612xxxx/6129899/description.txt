Hades......Fact or Fiction?
---------------------------

"This CD Tract is about a place called "Hades" or what many refer to as Hell. The listener will hear various testimonies of individuals who've either died and were later revived or were supernaturally taken to this horrible place. They all were allowed to return for one reason only....to warn the living that "Hell is Real"!

Eventually, Hades or Hell along with Satan and his demons will be cast into the "Lake of Fire". Do not make this your final resting place. Your abode goes from bad (Hades) to worse (Lake of Fire).

Jesus tells us in His Word....

2 Pet 3:9: "The LORD is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to REPENTANCE."
