Can you confirm that there IS english subs for the foreign subs?... hard coded?"
[T],extremezone,2011-01-26T15:18Z,not hardcoded but it is
,godswallops,2011-01-26T19:14Z,"Thanks, excellent quality.

Bugger about the hard subs though!  The subs provided as .srt files work but overlay the hard subs :(

Still a great copy, thanks!"
,ppereira1,2011-01-26T21:44Z,"he said it's not hardcoded :o
and you got a .srt file saying ""non-english only""


thanks max =)"

,stuntdriv3r,2011-01-27T01:50Z,For some reason ConvertXtoDVD won't let me use either of the .srt's. Kept saying it couldn't re-open the file??? So I had to convert it without subs :(

,XSCounter,2011-04-01T23:30Z,Good quality BUT occasional hardcoded russian subs were annoying. English subs that come with the movie are a bit out of sync. Thanks anyway!
