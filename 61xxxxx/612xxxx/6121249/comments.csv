Really bad cheesy movie made entirely with clichĂÂŠs, unbelievable actors & a few stupid comic reliefs & horse & dog pet tricks scenes thrown in that have nothing to do with the (thin) plot. Sub-Disney cowboy movie. :-("

Did it really need to be zipped though?

A:9

Could only be better if it was bluray!"
