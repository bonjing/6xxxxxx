Twilight Hotel
When The Wolves Go Blind (2011)

Hailing from the fertile music scene of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Zdan & Quanbury have been combining their talents for 8 years and now make their home in Austin, Texas. In 2008, they released their sophomore album Highway Prayer, produced by Colin Linden. Highway Prayer has received critical praise both nationally & internationally including a debut at #2 on the Euro Americana Chart , a Western Canadian Music Award for Outstanding Roots Album Duo/Group, a 2009 JUNO nomination for â€œRoots & Traditional Album of the Yearâ€.

Twilight Hotel is the musical partnership of Brandy Zdan & Dave Quanbury. Together they possess an elusive chemistry and musical style that is dark, moody and rooted in some kind of nostalgic passion for scratchy records and vintage guitar tones. They combine a rock n roll sensibility, compelling songwriting, and haunting arrangements while standing comfortably outside your predictable genre box.

In late 2009 Zdan & Quanbury made the trek across the New Mexico/Arizona desert from their new home in Austin, TX to Los Angeles, CA to record their third album â€œWhen The Wolves Go Blindâ€. They holed up in Kingsize soundlabs for 3 days and laid down the album live off the floor.
