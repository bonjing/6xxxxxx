,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:00Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Charity is a duty unto every Muslim. He who hath not the means thereto, let him do a good act or abstain from an evil one. That is his charity.

When you speak, speak the truth; perform when you promise; discharge your trust; commit not fornication; be chaste; have no impure desires; withold your hands from striking, and from taking that which is unlawful and bad. The best of God's servants are those who when seen, remind of God; and the worst of God's servants are those who carry tales about, and do mischief and separate friends, and seek for the defects of the good.

Whoso hath left debt and children, let him come to me; I am their patron, I will discharge his debt and befriend his children.

Every good act is charity.

Doing justice between two people is charity; and asisting a man upon his beast, and lifting his baggage is charity; and pure, comforting words are charity; and answering a questioner with mildness, is charity; and removing that which is an inconvenience to wayfarers, such as thorns and stones, is a charity. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:00Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Every good act is charity; and verily it is a good act to meet your brother with and open countenance, and to por water from your own water-bag into his vessel.

Your smiling in your brother's face is charity; and your exhorting man to virtuous deeds is charity; and your prohibiting the forbidden is charity; and your showing men the road, in the land in which they lose it, is charity; and your assisting the blind is charity. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:01Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

When the child (of Zainab) was brought to Muhammad, dying; its body trembling and moving; the eyes of the Apostle of God shed many tears. And Sad said, ""O Messenger of God! What is the weeping and shedding of tears?"" Muhammad replied, ""This is an expression of the tenderness and compassion, which the Lord hath put into the hearts of His servants; the Lord doth not have compassion on and commiserate with His servants, except such as are tender and full of feeling.""

The Apostle of God wept over Sad b. Ubadah. And he said, ""Have not you heard that the Lord doth not punish on account of shedding tears, not from sobs of the heart from the afflicted?"" He is not of the people of our way who slappeth his cheeks and teareth his collar, and mourneth like the mournings of Ignorance.

There is no reward but Paradise for a Muslim who suffereth with patience when the soul of his affectionate friend is taken "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:02Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Once Muhammad went together with some of his companions to Abu Yusuf, a blacksmith who was the husband of the nurse of Muhammad's son Ibrahim. And the Apostle of God took Ibrahim and kissed him and embraced him. On another occasion they went to see Ibrahim, when he was in his dying moments. The eyes of Muhammad were fixed, and flowed with tears; and Abd-al-Rahman, son of Auf, said to the Messenger of God, ""Do you weepand shed tears, O Apostle of God?"" He said, ""O son of Auf, these are tears of compassion, and feeling due to the dead."" After that he shed tears again, and said, ""Verily my eyes shed tears and my heart is afflicted, and I say nothing but what is pleasing to my Benefactor; for verily, O Ibrahim, I am melancholy at being separated from thee.""

Muhammad said, ""Do you think this woman will cast her own child into the fire?"" Those present said, ""No."" Muhammad said, ""Verily God is more compassionate on His creatures, than this woman on her own child."""
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:03Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

When one of the family of Muhammad died, and the women assemnled, crying over the corpse, Omar stood up to prevent them from crying, and drive them away: but Muhammad said, ""Let them alone, O Omar, because eyes are shedding tears; and the heart is stricken with calamity and sorrowful; and the time of misfortune near and fresh; and the crying of women is without wailing."" 

A man asked Muhammad what was the mark whereby he might know the reality of his faith. Muhammad said, ""If thou derive pleasure from the good which thou hast performed and thou be grieved for the evil which thou hast committed, thou art a true believer."" The man said. ""In what doth a fault really consist?"" Muhammad said, ""when action pricketh thy conscience, forsake it.""

All actions are judged by the motive prompting them."
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:03Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Remember the lord in retirement from the people and make prayer thy sleep, and hunger thy food.

Kill not your hearts with excess of eating and drinking.

Illumine your hearts with hunger, and strive to conquer yourself with hunger and thirst; continue to knock on the gates of paradise by hunger.

The world is sweet in the heart, and green to the eye; and verily God hath brought you, after those who went before you: then look to your action, and abstain from the world of wickedness.

The nearest to me are the abstinent, whoever they are, wherever they are.

A keeper of the fast, who doth not abandon lying and detraction, God careth not about his leaving off eating and drinking.

A man once said to Muhammad, ""O Messenger of God, permit me to become a Eunuch."" He said, ""That person is not of me who maketh another a eunuch, or becometh so himself; because the manner in which my followers become eunuchs is by fasting and abstinence."" The man said permit me to retire from society, and to abandon the delights of the world."" He said, ""The retirement that becometh my followers is to live in the world and yet to sit in the corner of a mosque in expectation of prayers."" "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:04Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

A man while fasting must abstain from all bad expressions and must not even resent an injury.

Torment not yourselves, lest God punish you.

There is no monasticism in Islam.

S'ad b. Abi Wakkas said: The apostle forbade Uthman b. Mazun from avoiding marriage: and if he had permitted that to him, we would have become eunuchs.""

The man I most emulate is a Muslim unencumbered; a man of small family, and little money, a performer of prayers and a perfect worshipper of God in private, one who is unknown, and hath enough to supply his wants, and when he dieth, he will leave few women to cry for him, and few legacies.

Keep fast and eat also, stay awake at night and sleep also, for verily there is a duty on you to your body, not to labor overmuch, so that ye may not get ill and destroy yourselves; and verily there is a duty on you to your eyes, ye must sometimes sleep and give them rest; and verily there is a duty on you to your wife, and to your visitors and guests that come to see you; ye must talk to them; and nobody hath kept fast who fasted always; the fast of three days in every month is equal to constant fasting: then keep three days' fast in every month.

Thus saith the Lord, ""Verily those who are patient in adversity and forgive wrongs, are the doers of excellence.""

Once Muhammad was asked, ""O Apostle of God!"" How many times are we to forgive our servant's faults?"" He was silent. Again the questioner asked, and Muhammad gave no answer. But when the man asked a third time, he said, ""Forgive your servants seventy times day.""

There is no man who woundeth and pardoneth the giver of the wound but God will exalt his dignity and dimish his faults.

That man is nearest to God, who pardoneth, when he had in his power him who would have injured him.

Do not say, that if the people do good to us, we will do good to them; and if the people oppress us, we will oppress them; but determine that if people do you good, you will do good to them; and if they oppress you, you will not oppress them. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:15Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Whoever loveth to meet God, God loveth to meet him.

God saith, ""I fulfil the faith of whoso putteth his faith in Me; and I am with him, and near him, when remembereth Me.""

God saith, ""Whoso doth one good act, for him are ten rewards; and I also give more to whomever I will; and whoso doth an ill, its punishment is equal to it, or I forgive him; and whoso seeketh to approach Me one span, I seek to approach one cubit; and whoso seeketh to approach Me one cubit, I seek to approach him two fathoms; and whoso walketh towards Me, I run towards him; and whoso cometh before Me with the earth full of sins, and believeth solely in Me, him I come before with a front of forgiveness as big as the earth.""

God saith, ""The person I hold as a beloved, I am his hearing by which he heareth, and I am his sight by which he seeth, and I am his hands by which he holdeth, and I am his feet by which he walketh.""

God saith, ""O Man! Only follow thou My laws, and thou shall become like unto Me, and then say, 'Be' and behold, It is.""

God is One, and liketh unity.

We were with Muhammad on a journey, and some men stood up repeating aloud, ""God is most great,"" and the Rasul said, ""O men! Be easy on yourselves, and do not distress yourselves by raising your voices, verily you do not call to one deaf or absent, but verily to one who heareth and seeth; and He is with you; and He to whom you pray is nearer to you than the neck of your camel.""

God sait, ""I was a hidden treasure. I would fain be known. So I created Man.""

Do you love your creator? Love your fellow-beings first. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:16Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

If the unbeliever knew of the extent of the Lord's mercy, even he would not despair of Paradis.

God's kindness towards his creaturee is more than a mother's towards her babe.

If you put your whole trust in God, as you ought, He most certainly will give you sustenance, as He doth the birds; they come out hungry in the morning, but return full to their nests.

Trust in God, but tie it (your camel).

God is not merciful to him who is not kind to mankind.

""Do none enter the Garden of Bliss save by God's mercy?"" Muhammad said, ""No. None enter save through God's favor."" ""You also, O Messenger of God! Will you not enter Paradise save by God's compassion?"" Muhammad put his hand on his head and said thrice, ""I shall not enter unless God cover me with His mercy."" "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:22Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Beware! verily there is a piece of flesh in the body of man, which when good, the whole body is good; and when bad, the whold body is bad, and that is the heart.

Muhammad said, ""O Wabisah! are you come to ask what is goodness and what is badness?"" Wabisah said, ""Yes, I am come for that."" Then He joined his fingers and struck them upon Wabisah's breast, that is made a sign towards his heart, and said, ""Ask the question from thine own heart."" This he repeated three times aloud and said, ""Goodness is a thing from which thy heart findeth firmness and rest; and badness is a thing which throweth thee into doubt, although men may acquit thee.""

,O0oo0,2011-02-01T07:02Z,"Sayings of the Humanist Robert Green Ingersoll:

""Every religion has for its foundation a miracle â€” that is to say, a violation of nature â€” that is to say, a falsehood.""

""I cannot see why we should expect an infinite God to do better in another world than he does in this.""

""The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of infidels.""

There is no god. Praise be to Allah that he does not exist. No sin. No judgment. Just freedom, i.e. responsibility."
