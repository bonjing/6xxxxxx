Not a fake and it did work for me.

I had found a copy online but I was unable to put on my Ipod. Something about the conversion to .mp3 was done incorrectly. I'm not terribly technology sabby but I ripped this from the CD and was able to put it on my Ipod. I hope it works for everyone.

Good Luck!
