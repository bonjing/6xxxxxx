,Revolver31,2011-01-22T19:11Z,nice one m8 good for you 12gb size keep em comin.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-22T19:27Z,size doesn't much matter to me.  I never in that big of a hurry anymore.  Thanks for the share.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-22T19:33Z,"should note though that most people do not need a 1080p file.  Average laptops are 1280 width for basic models.   A lot of the TV's in use are probably 720p TV's.  Unless you have a newer 1080p television then there isn't much benefit for you to get the 1080p file.  You also need some way of watching the 1080p file natively.  The 2010 model samsung LED tv's play MKV 1080p with DTS audio natively with the builtin media player.  Its a good choice if you are thinking of upgrading.  The first gen Samsung LED tv only supported AC3 audio (though that could be fixed in a firmware push now).

,Gibbonfiddler,2011-01-23T16:57Z,1920 x 800 = 1080p?!
,kgvg988,2011-01-23T19:02Z,Best way to play these files on a HDTV is via something like LaCie cinema connect HD connected to TV via HDMI + optical to a surround sound system.  Download movies directly to a portable HD and then either stream or connect HD directly to the LaCie with a simple USB lead - plays like a dream!! Thanks for these quality downloads.
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-23T19:12Z,"The movie was shot with an aspect ratio of 2.400:1, so yes, 1920x800 is 1080p. It would only have a screen resolution of 1920x1080 if the mattes/letterbox were kept, or encoded into to video file itself - do you homework.

Cheers for the upload, aoloffline."

,RGBeffect,2011-02-13T11:43Z,1920 x 1080 = 1080p by the way!
,-Cortex-,2011-02-14T19:28Z,"@RGBeffect Well done, numb nuts, so are 1920x800 and 1440x1080. I can point out irrelevant facts too!"

,iamneo33,2011-04-30T18:23Z,"HolyRoses: what are you talking about?  most hd tvs(1080p) up to 46 inches are on sale for less that 600 bucks.  With this price, everyone I know has one...?  720p movies are fine but does not do my 110 inch HD projected screen justice.  or maybe you hinting for all us to chip in and get you one... lol

12 Gig - not too big... should of seen the file size for the 3d version of avatar...

aoloffline:  thanks for the up, have not see it, but from your previous torrents, I know it will be a good one...

,WellBeSerious12,2011-07-26T22:51Z,"@aoloffline

Would you PLEASE use 1920 x 1080 next time? Besides, the only disc that can fit this file is anything above a BD-R.

Thanks~"
,Nick02111989,2011-07-31T12:52Z,"Not sure if this was something i was doing or not. but this whole movie's video was jumpy and pixelated and down right poor quality. sound was great.

just so you know, i played the file straight onto VLC on my Core I7 Laptop, played via HDMI onto my 1080p Plasma.
if anyone can give me any tips, it'd be much appreciated. :)"
