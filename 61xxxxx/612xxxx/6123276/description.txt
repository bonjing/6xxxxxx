Notes:

1) It's my first torrent. Woohoo! I'm happy to finally give back as I've gotten so much from such generous people here. Thank you.

2) I highly suggest to skip to 5:45 when starting to play the movie as the first almost 6 minutes before this is nothing but spoilers derived from the content of the rest of the movie; it's like watching a trailer before the actual film. No idea why they did this but had to include it for completeness.

3) The are a couple of places where the codec briefly goes pixelly but other than that it looked good (playtested on a 53" TV.) I used the "official" XviD code from http://www.xvid.org/ . Feedback is always welcome. :^)

4) PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SEED as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.)
