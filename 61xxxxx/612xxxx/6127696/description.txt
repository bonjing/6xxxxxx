Village fisherman Miguel is married and about to become a father. However, it turns out he has been having a secret romance with an artist and outsider, Santiago. When Santiago drowns suddenly, he returns from the dead to ask Miguel to find his body and bury it according to the village rituals so he can be at peace. For Miguel, to fulfill Santiago's wishes means he would have to reveal his affair, and in turn, ruin his marriage and his reputation. But failing to do so would sentence him to eternal limbo.
