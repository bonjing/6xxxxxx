Directed by Andy Tennant. 

Starring Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, Dougray Scott. 

The "real" story of Cinderella. A refreshing new take on the classic fairy tale. 


I think Ever After was a great movie, and a must see for everyone. It's not just a "kiddie movie". Drew Barrymore plays a great and convincing Cinderella, or as Margerite called her, "Cinder Girl". It isn't like the Disney movie, way different. For example, the girl is named Danielle, not Cinderella. There is a nice stepsister.. and there is no Fairy Godmother, but Leonarod Da Vinci, a guide to Danielle and the Prince.

The thing that really made me want to see this movie is what Drew Barrymore said in one of her interviews..

"It's so wonderful, because all girls love Cinderella. She is really a positive rolemodel. From everything to being fiercely loyal, and incredibly smart, and well read, to not only not waiting to be rescued, but to rescue other people, to take the pain that she's experienced in her life, to only have it strengthen her. And, also the fact that her heart and her mind is what is attractive and intriguing to this wonderful prince, and not the way she looks."
