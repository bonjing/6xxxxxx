Nil Lara is an exceptionally gifted singer, songwriter and guitarist. If his career was handled differently you would probably see his name mentioned among Marc Anthony, Ruben Blades, etc.

Lara was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Cuban immigrants, but much of his childhood was spent in Venezuela, moving to Caracas at the age of 7. He plays the tres, the six-stringed Cuban guitar, and the cuatro, a Venezuelan guitar.
