downloaded many times, and the same result while there is a professional codecs pack installed.. :(
hope there is another good synced version and without the pixels dots in some scenes, i guess it was from an original upload error in some pieces,
Also hope if there is a version for Christmas carol 2009 in  Anaglyph 3D"
