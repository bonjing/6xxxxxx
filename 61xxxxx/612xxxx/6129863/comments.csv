no problem

some people finished so hopefully they'll keep seeding

sadly extremezone has uploaded the game, and because he's more known, he'll probably get more of the people going to his download even tho everyone downloading this torrent is WAY ahead of anyone on his.

oh well

that's just how it is i guess

Thanks to anyone who downloads from me :D"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-27T00:10Z,"it seems as tho my torrent is dead.

since i'm not VIP, people dont stick around to seed, and see extremezone's upload is starting to have more seeders and more peers.

,Indigo666,2011-01-27T03:15Z,The game exits after i play a round on the singleplayer mode . When i finish the stage it exits and a send dont send error apears ...
