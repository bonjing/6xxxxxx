Russian Circles is a three piece instrumental rock/metal band from Chicago. Russian Circles play instrumental, sprawling music which runs the gamut of heavy discordant metal, to soft delicate passages. They are also known for their energetic live shows, which include tours with Minus the Bear, Chin Up Chin Up, Coheed & Cambria, Mono, and Pelican. They were also the opening band for Tool while playing in the United Kingdom for their 2007 tour.
