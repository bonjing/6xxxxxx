extremezone-please upload a working Bluray copy, love this movie. Thanks."
,UNDER8ED,2011-02-12T03:19Z,"Please ignore previous post. VLC Media Player seems to be the ONLY player that will play this file. You can download it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6146055/VLC_Media_Player.1.1.7.final.updated(windows_all).aaaevilacharya

*(In the past PowerDVD 10 played ALL my Bluray movies; but not this one :|)* "
