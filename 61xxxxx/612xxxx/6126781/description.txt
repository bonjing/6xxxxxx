Soleil has a relaxed view on file sharing (it's a digital release it's bound to happen anyway so 

enjoy ^^)but if you would like to support the music and future album releases you can still buy 

the album on either bandcamp or i-tunes. In the future, album release purchases will enter you 

into a raffle to win rare collectors items signed by Arai Tasuku and Nicole Marie. 

If you see torrents that DO NOT have this 

text file then you know it was not from us. (Oh well shit happens) If it gets stuck in your head 

though... you can always stalk our bandcamp/itunes (and other distribution) or stick a comment 

down on the blog. 


Thanks for listening.
