i went to see this at the theaters a while back as a second choice since no other movie was open and well, i didnt regret it... i actually cried a few times because i felt exactly how the kid was feeling.
its kinda funny, sad, calm and romantic haha. 
loved it though
now i have a copy to watch at home when im feeling down.
thanks!

[if you put it on a flashdrive then onto your playstation 3's harddrive it looks MUCH MUCH! clearer than it would if you wasted 20 minutes burning it to a dvd., looks alright on a 1080p 60 inch tv, but it looks amazing on a standard def tv thats around 480-720p]"

Nah, but I loved your mother, she caters to idiots like me who don't understand social rules and reinvents the medium of sucking dick.

,Infalk,2011-01-29T14:01Z,"Checks himself into an adult psychiatric war?

Well that sounds both intriguing and dull.

And whilst I'm picking holes in the description, is there a difference between depressed and clinically depressed? Aren't they both depressed? And surely if he 'checks himself in', then he isn't 'clinically' depressed?"

,bilper,2011-02-01T23:46Z,"K-PAX was more realistic than this.

1) Once you are in a psych ward you canâ€™t get out â€“ the doors are locked.
2) All visitations are supervised. Some visitors are even searched.
3) A patient who exhibits destructive behavior (i.e. knocking books off a shelf) is immediately subduedâ€“ not with Ativan but with an injection of Halcion and Benadryl that knocks you out in as little as 15 minutes. After that you are placed on powerful antipsychotic medications probably for the duration of your stay. 
4) â€œTherapyâ€ sessions are brief â€“ they only want to know if the meds are working and how much they should increase the dosage â€“ they donâ€™t give a damn about psychotherapy.
5) This movie depicts a country club compared to the real thing. You are either completely compliant or you they wonâ€™t unlock the door to let you live your life.
6) It will take you about a year to wean yourself off all the drugs they put you on so you can live a â€œnormalâ€ life.

Major Depressive Disorder â€“ Itâ€™s not in the least bit funny."

,bilper,2011-02-05T19:20Z,"It’s just a silly, ‘fanciful’ movie in which all suicidal patients are allowed free access to the roof of a psychiatric facility."
,nemaca,2011-02-07T14:24Z,"@highlander777: and you should probably be castrated so stupidity won't spread.

Interesting movie.

And ofc, the movie is aimed at those that live in the dream called Society. From now on, depression... is kind of funny... so it is OK to be depressed."
,bilper,2011-02-07T17:48Z,"Dear highlander777,

The Nazi's succeeded in doing that very thing for the mentally ill as well as the mentally retarded before they later decided to just euthanize them. Might I suggest you burn your Swastikas and try behaving as an adult? I did not hurl unwarranted and inappropriate insults at you. I merely voiced my opinion."

,fightthenwofuckers,2011-02-16T11:32Z,THE COMMENTS SEEM OK BUT I CANT DOWNLOAD IT COS THE COVER LOOKS TOO FUCKING GHAY. IT LOOKS LIKE A FAGGIT FILM.
,dasky,2011-02-16T22:05Z,"Welcome to the internet fightthenwofuckers.
Just FYI, there's a button on the left of your keyboard that will take care of that annoying ""all-caps"" issue you're having. 
(Sorry, I can't help you with your attention seeking problems.)

Anyway, I thought this movie was excellent and quite realistic, despite some of the earlier comments.
 3 North is not a prison and you are free to come and go as you please, provided you sign in and out. This ward is for persons with moderate to severe depression who need a safe protective environment and a little ""time off"" from real life pressures. It's not prison, it's not a mental institution.
The doors are not locked during normal hours and there is no subduing anyone with forced halcyon injections. That commenter must have been in a special ward for patients with severe mental health issues, definitely not 3 North!
The characters in this story are very realistic portrayals of the characters you might find in any 3 North in any city. Harmless souls who just have problems dealing with things sometimes,and express their needs and moods  in unusual ways. If you've been there, if you know someone who's been there, if you want to broaden your understanding of depression, or just want to watch some honest entertainment, take the time to watch this one. 

Thank you very much for the upload extremezone :)
