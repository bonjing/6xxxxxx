This is just great. Meat Loaf only gave two concerts in the U.S. in 2001 and they were back to back in Caesar's Palace, Atlantic City on Sept 7 and 8. For some reason the recorder taped the last part on Sept 7th and the first part of the concert on Sept 8th. I put them in the right order of the set list and what is left is just a fantastic concert. Okay some songs are incomplete and it's missing 1 or 2 songs but besides that this is one of my favorite fan DVD's. This concert is the bridge between the Storytellers Tour and the Having Fun with Friends Tour. And Meat is having a ball. Great set, great interaction with the crowd and for an audience recording great video and sound! This is one to enjoy!
