,SEoF,2011-01-24T17:59Z,"Buketsful: Whilst I agree with the point you are trying to convey, incorrectly using our language and subsequently producing complex sentences where the point is simple does not help.

The point made could be put across as ""America, stop ruining our (UK) TV shows!"" Note the word ""our"" rather than ""are"".

EZTV: thanks for the upload, staying faithful to UK shows as well as US!"
,neuromonkey,2011-01-24T20:27Z,"Also, the word ""you"" has three letters."
,Feetback,2011-01-25T04:01Z,"Thank You - GMT, you Rock - i love this Original TV Show -    :) -                                                            Absolutely Agree Totally! always Try Copying & steeling ideas from other Country - LOLL"

Whilst teaching people (without request I might add) English over the internet, try using it properly yourself. 

""incorrectly using our language and subsequently producing complex sentences where the point is simple does not help.""

Do I need to correct your grammar in this sentence? No, Also... Irony!

Try saying instead

""I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'll give it a go, in order to win some superfluous point against some internet entity that will neither respect me, or possibly even know that I've left it.""

p.s. hope you read this 

ciao"
,Charmed3,2011-01-30T14:55Z,I'm glad the series is back on... I'm not even sure if it's available where I am. I've seen the preview for the rip-off and I will not watch it all seems in poor taste. Thank you for sharing!
,vvfireflyvv,2011-02-15T05:21Z,"So is the actually season 3 for the UK show??
i am Canadian, and wont watch the US version. Agrees that US needs to stop trying to replicate the British shows."
[V],matimike,2011-02-19T03:42Z,a/v 10 thanks
,kilrbny,2011-02-22T03:34Z,"buketsful , you dumb shit, this is the original BBC version all you have to do is click on the preview pic, but i do agree, the American version of..anything the u.k. has done is just crap and horrible, and that's from an American lol, thank you EZTV now i don't have to wait for BBC America to air these"
,chunguloo,2011-02-26T00:51Z,"LMAO at everyone stressing over ""territorial domination"" TPB is a platform that allows us to be ecstatic about getting movies that we sooo much want to see and enjoy that we probably wouldn't get anywhere else.  It erases borders and boundaries created by countries, age, class, religion or race. we don't need to turn this place into the rest of the world with all the hate and fighting. Can't we all just get along. Goodness!

P.s  I deliberately spelled the word ""so"" with three Os just in case someone creates a riot out of my spelling. LOL "
,GavinS,2011-09-20T14:52Z,"First of all, ""eztv"" you ROCK! 
Now to the show ""Being Human"" Yes, It may have been the British that aired it first, but then ""Cricket was also a first from UK... Which year did England win a world cup?? oh ya... They still haven't won one! US Movies & TV shows are way better than the British ""Ruubbish"" out their. The cast & the dialogue are so much better than the UK ""Original"" BTW Using ""U"" for ""you"" is totally acceptable in the 21st C. Some of you hear must be as old as ""Aidan"" & as dumb as ""Marcus""   TPB, eztv, axxo, bone - TY, TC & GB. these guys here are gonne be like, WTF... lol"
