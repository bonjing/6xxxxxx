,uflinks,2011-01-26T17:39Z,"Hundreds of scientists at major universities and academic centres have courageously stepped forward to show their scepticism about Darwinism and sign ""A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism.""

The list is growing and includes scientists from the US National Academy of Sciences, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, Indian, Nigerian, and Brazilian National Academies, as well as from universities such as Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and others.

So it's not about Dokuz Eylul University in Turkey. 

It's about academic freedom, not restricting science to materialistic explanations and not imposing materialist ideology and worldview upon the evidence!"
,Pastafarian101,2011-02-07T16:48Z,"Regarding the comment about ""Dissent from Darwinism"", I have a few pointers to make:
1) A vast majority of those who signed it, did not have degrees/PhDs in a bioscience related subject
2) The term ""Darwinism"" is trying to imply something, a term invented by creationists to make it appear as if we worship the guy
3) Scientists accept many established THEORIES, do they remain skeptical of them? Yes, why? Because our knowledge/theories do not give a complete picture, we expect the theory to expand.

Evolution is a fact of life, the reason why certain Christians and most Muslims have a problem with it, is because it challanges the literal interpretation of the bible/koran.
