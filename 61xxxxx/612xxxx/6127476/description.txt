Starred Review. Grade 5-8â€“Hitler's plans for the future of Germany relied significantly on its young people, and this excellent history shows how he attempted to carry out his mission with the establishment of the Hitler Youth, or Hitlerjugend, in 1926. With a focus on the years between 1933 and the end of the war in 1945, Bartoletti explains the roles that millions of boys and girls unwittingly played in the horrors of the Third Reich. The book is structured around 12 young individuals and their experiences, which clearly demonstrate how they were victims of leaders who took advantage of their innocence and enthusiasm for evil means. Their stories evolve from patriotic devotion to Hitler and zeal to join, to doubt, confusion, and disillusion. (An epilogue adds a powerful what-became-of-them relevance.) The large period photographs are a primary component and they include Nazi propaganda showing happy and healthy teens as well as the reality of concentration camps and young people with large guns. The final chapter superbly summarizes the weighty significance of this part of the 20th century and challenges young readers to prevent history from repeating itself. Bartoletti lets many of the subjects' words, emotions, and deeds speak for themselves, bringing them together clearly to tell this story unlike anyone else has.â€“

From AudioFile
This Newbery Honor book is enhanced by the narration of Kathrin Kana, who voices the facts and information as a compelling story and leaves the listener to gradually become aware of the implications of Hitler's plans for Germany and the Hitler Youth. Hitler's exploitation of Germany's young bought their devotion to the Nazi cause while blinding them to the true motives behind his quest for power. Kana's steady voice propels the narrative to its conclusion without diminishing the story's brutality. A concluding slideshow of photographs (to be viewed on computer) adds an important dimension to the narrative and demonstrates a meaningful innovation for audiobooks. An added bonus is an introduction and epilogue spoken by the author, which add power to the presentation. L.D.H. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award Â© AudioFile 2007, Portland,
