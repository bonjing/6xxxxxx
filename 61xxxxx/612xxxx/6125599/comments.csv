Skins has received a lot of publicity this last week from the far right wrining their hands over child pornography.  WTF is wrong with them?  Get a grip you idiot Christians.  This is a GREAT series.  Take a look at your OWN teenagers!  This is their life in a nutshell!

Grab this before they pull down the whole damn series!

(Now back to shutting OFF Javascript on TPB! ARGHHHHH!)"
,Bobthedeadly,2011-01-26T00:01Z,"*sigh...* thanks for the great upload, though i wish they would shut off this sad excuse for a television show. why does america feel the need to put their special scent of shit on every little thing?

by the way, i have no moral dilemma with the content, i watched the shit out of the real skins (which is much, much more graphic than this) and i loved it. i just think the show is shit, i'm only watching it because i have to write about it for my site :P"
