The Master Cleanser, or "The Lemonade Diet, is the widely popular fasting diet described in the book "The Master Cleanser - with Special Needs and Problems" by Stanley Burroughs...

Excerpt from Chapter 1:

"For the novice and the advanced student alike, cleansing is basic for elimination of every kind of disease. The purpose of this book is to simplify the cause and the correction of all disorders, regardless of the name or names. As we eliminate and correct one disease, we correct them all, for every disease is corrected by the same process of cleansing and building positive good health. Man's mastery of disease will only be final when ignorance and fear are overcome by proper observance of all laws pertaining to the creation of bones, flesh, and blood."
