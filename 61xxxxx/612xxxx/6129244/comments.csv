,akaismac,2011-01-30T15:09Z,"haven't tried it & will definitely not
apparently too many downsides
many people get back the weight they lost before that and more
i'll try P90X of tony horton 
it's the best workout + nutrition plan there is but very difficult, i'll do the light version xD

,akaismac,2011-02-03T21:54Z,"i changed my mind actually
tried it now for 5 days
i'll finish 7 days since i'm invited to a friend's :s
i'm tired most of the time
i don't know if i lost any weight since i still haven't weighed myself again
and i rarely feel the hunger
i used the organic honey instead of maple syrup
Enjoy
Peace Out"

well did the master cleanse for 7 days, it was harder on the first 2 days but everything ended great.
I didn't weigh myself, i had some sore muscles and pain on the knees before but not anymore after.
i'm trying a workout program ""Beachbody insanity""

it's great u can try it at home, no weights needed nothing at all, just a bottle of water, sneakers and a strong will
u should try it, even the nutrition plan is much cheaper than all the ones circling around
anyway, that's what i think of it
c ya"
