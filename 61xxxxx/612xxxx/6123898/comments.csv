,knox666,2011-01-24T18:42Z,Single player campaign is only roughly 10 hours long I don't understand why it is 17 plus gb/s but i'll pass and wait.  http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/114/1145296p1.html    it has a good review thuogh. 
,knox666,2011-01-24T18:48Z,@ The4XRus Some peeps have to pay by the gig sometimes a dollar per gig from the isp `so it may work out to be close to paying half of the price of the game so technically your not getting it for free and where I am running unlimited bandwidth I now have to pay for anymore than 60 gb's a month because they passed a law up here in canada stating anymore than 60 is a doolar a pop per gig . :(
,apowers_1,2011-01-24T19:51Z,"Wow, I'm in Canada, and I dont get charged per Gig. or over 60Gigs.
Where you at, roughly.... thats crap bro."
,qumahlin,2011-01-24T23:56Z,"""because they passed a law up here in canada stating anymore than 60 is a doolar a pop per gig . :( ""

If by law you mean thats what your ISP decided to do then yes.  The canadian govt does not regulate bandwidth (atleast not yet)"
,viperstrikes,2011-01-25T04:16Z,@The4XRus I'm not whining. It is just surprising as this is more than double the size of the last game. BTW any info about crack as I've started downloading this.
,chungpuiho,2011-01-25T14:22Z,Get me the damn crack for godsake

I think knox66 was referring to the recent ruling by the CRTC, however his numbers are made up.

,svadilfari,2011-01-26T20:17Z,the day my countries ISPs limit download im gonna have to live in another country hahahhahaha
,knox666,2011-01-26T21:33Z,@ svadilfari You would leave your country because of crappy ISP bandwidth limits? If you say so bud HAHAHAHAHAhehehoho! WTF'ever 
,svadilfari,2011-01-26T23:40Z,dude im not even joking. If tomorrow a law gets passed which prohibits ISPs to offer more than say 10gb a month im outta here
,knox666,2011-01-27T22:33Z,It is a freaking retarted law especially with companies as netflix is just becoming popular. Hey canadian government rats if your reading this way to have your pulse on society fuck bags and don't forget who hired your fucktards you fuck with the peeps you will get owned. Time for a canadian refrendum on this shit settle all this crooked fucking politicians once and for all.
,knox666,2011-01-27T22:36Z,"Sorry about my bad writing but i
m half drunk right now WOOHOO!"
,Furious1964,2011-01-28T19:32Z,"The CRTC ruling only applies to the smaller ISP that offer Unlimited Bandwidth and are operating out of the bigger ISPs. Videotron, Sympatico and Rogers don't offer unlimited, they offer packages of 60, 90 or even 100 GB per month. I'm with Sympatico and for $10 more, I bought an extra 80GB. So now, I have every month a total of 170GB per month of Bandwidth."
