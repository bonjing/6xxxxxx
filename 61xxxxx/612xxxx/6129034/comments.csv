,Quarantine.X,2011-01-26T21:15Z,"The ROM works perfectly so far, but your NO$GBA setup doesn't work, I had to use my own. Good upload though (: I'll seed."
,Quarantine.X,2011-01-26T21:19Z,The ROM cuts out after the Introduction sadly :(
,mariosA7x,2011-01-26T21:40Z,"@Quarantine.X
I really dont know why.. it works perfect for me..
Check your settings on no$gba and try to play it with no$zoomer.. thats how i play it so far without any crash"
,Quarantine.X,2011-01-28T13:57Z,"Thanks, I will give it a go :)"
,Quarantine.X,2011-01-28T14:03Z,"It working now, thanks man. I feel dumb haha XD. Great upload!"
,Titanium9533,2011-08-24T13:21Z,If this works I will seed for a year. (I have good upload speeds.) I have been trying to find a soulsilver that works for ages. I'll let you know once I've played it. The furthest I've got on other ones is slowpoke well before it freezes without any way around it. 
,Titanium9533,2011-08-24T14:03Z,"Just one thing- When playing with no$zoomer the image looks blurred. I fixed this by going into the options and under the render tab changing it from DirectX 8 to OpenGL. Great so far, I'll keep you updated as I play."
