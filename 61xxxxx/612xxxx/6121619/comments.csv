Can you or somebody els help me please."
,derkevevin,2011-12-29T04:28Z,"@Tutitox
you should better go to youtube and find a new hamachi network to find people to play, OR you make a network and a video and paste the link here maybe.

@dashiellbell do u have -windowed or something similar in the game shortcut? if so, try without it. if i remember right ive put -windowed in the shortcut that came with the game because fullscreen likes to crash when u minimize the game to chat or whatever...

@jari123
make sure to close shitsteam, then try again ;/

@all ure gelcome muys ;/"
