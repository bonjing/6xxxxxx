Topless Prophet -- The True Story of America's Most Successful Gentleman's Club Entrepreneur

By Alan Markovitz with Thomas Stevens

Alan Markowitz has owned high-end strip clubs in Detroit since the 1980s.  He's currently the owner of The Flight Club, The Penthouse Club and All Stars. He also owns the popular strip club listing site, TUSCL (The Ultimate Strip Club List.)  For these reasons alone this book is worth reading. On the other hand, the repetition and self-aggrandizement in this self-published autobiography make it tough sledding at times. The book combines Alan's life story with some glimpses of strip club owner politics in Detroit since the 1980s. Add to that Alan's stories about the two times that he's been shot, once by a dancer and once by an off-duty Inkster cop, and the contract that his partner in BTs took out on him and the ensuing trial in federal court, and there's enough meat in here to keep you turning the pages.
