He gives us hope in the form of the knowledge, that we are the ones holding all the cards, we just need to realize this fact, come back into our power, and work together to stop the corruption around the world. It really would be just that easy.

We don't need everyone awake, all we would need is a significant number of people. I mean a million people sounds like a lot! And with a million people we could do a LOT of good around the world. That is 0.01538% or 1/6500th of the population, or not very many of us.

Though not a unique perspective, Max offers guidance in the form of self empowerment, by connecting with source and the people around us we can remove fear from our lives and over come the problems that we face very easily. All we have to do is step back into our power and work with each other for the common good.

Imagine if one day, everyone started helping everyone else around them. And then they just kept doing it. Imagine what we could achieve if we simply worked together and helped each other?"
