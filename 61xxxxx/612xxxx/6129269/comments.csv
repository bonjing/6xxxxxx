hey just a question - why do you do this?
Why do you spend all the time and effort necessary to rip, encode, and upload all this stuff for people?
Do you make money off it somehow or are you just the most giving person alive?"
,nitrogun,2011-01-27T09:14Z,"@20-40
Thanks again, but not sure if I will ever get them dl'd as connection here at house is maxing out at 8kb/sec, more usually 5.

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-27T11:00Z,"@ladderman22: I don't like money, I don't have the money (except for paying the bills), and I don't know any way to earn money with  this (torrents have public trackers only). I am going to bed hungry every night - but happy and feeling better because I made for someone some good.

Pure altruism, I guess, and sort of my last rebel against injustice all around."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-27T11:08Z,"@nitrogun: Well, my friend, at the end of the month, when you fell onto dial-up, you should download one show daily maximal, avoid movies altogether and eventually come back when new month begin - if specific torrents are alive at all."
,the_shroud,2011-01-28T06:07Z,"Being Human's back! Brilliant :) Thx 20-40.
Really can't see the point of the American Version"
