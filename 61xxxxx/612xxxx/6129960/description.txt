Yoga as Therapeutic Exercise is a practical guide to prescribing yoga exercises therapeutically for common health problems. The book is aimed at all manual therapists, as well as yoga teachers working with beginners and physically restricted or older students. It describes how to modify yoga postures for a wide range of patients and conditions, integrating relaxation, stretching and strengthening. Written in an accessible style and with a very practical layout, it describes the principles and aims of this exercise approach before providing groups of exercises for specific areas of the body (feet and knees, pelvis, spine, shoulder girdle, neck, arms and hands). Exercises are classified from basic to advanced level and supported by clear illustrative photographs and precise descriptions.............
