This is pure science and total fact. This guy has clearly an attitude that he accepts the use ofï»¿ marihuana when not used too regurarly. Its really the same thing with alcohol. I have no problem with people drinking and being drunk a couple of times in month, but if they do it several times in a week you start to notice problems. Im not against drugs, I just think that people should KNOW their drugs."
