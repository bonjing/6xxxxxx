,kpurple17,2011-01-30T23:21Z,WORKS PERFECTLY THANKS!!
,loosbroos,2011-01-31T19:31Z,"i had a lot of problems with CS5 giving an 'Invalid Serial Number' message each time I opened it - then the last serial didn't work anymore so i had to find another

anyway i have now found a crack that works perfectly:

GOTO: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6076932/Adobe_Photoshop_CS5_Extended_Activator_by_Carlos_Manuel_Virus_FR

many thanks to carlos manuel for fixing this problem

btw i didn't open the 'Open This.bat' first as instructed (see the Readme in the download) - i just ran the 'CS5 activation DLL.exe' and it worked anyway"
,GlennMc,2011-02-15T02:22Z,Thanks again.....all working A1 on my pc !

,prognosticon,2011-03-11T08:32Z,Works like a dream! But I wonder if itÂ´s safe to let Adobe to do updates and also if itÂ´s safe to creat a Adobe-id?

,chiepsilon,2011-05-02T12:31Z,thanks great torrent :D
,CDLX5342,2011-05-02T13:23Z,"everyone having trouble with the disk error, I installed this on my comp and it worked perfectly, just putting the complete folder on my desktop then running the .exe, after this I burnt it to disk to install for my dad on his computer, but it gave me the error, so Im thinking that it may solve your prob if you put the complete folder on desktop, as it may be a location assossiation error. hope this helps and good luck!

P.S thanks very much uploader, great torrent and great program. keep up the good work! :)"
,CDLX5342,2011-05-02T13:31Z,"for those having trouble with installation asking for the insertion of the disk, I had the same prob, but managed to get around it by simply placing the entire folder on the desktop, and running the exe file inside the directory. afterwards you can remove all the installation files from the desktop and burn them to disk for backup (or however you back up IF you do back up programs) hope this helps everyone!

P.S thanks very much uploader, great clean program. keep up the good work! :)"
,weasel94,2011-05-02T23:15Z,where is the image file? i use roxio home creator and i cant find any image files in any of the folders... help?

,killzoomer,2011-05-24T15:17Z,"none of the torrents titled ""Photoshop CS5 Extended"" are actually extended...I've downloaded Photoshop from like 5 different torrents and none of them are extended!! they're just regular CS5 so dont expect 3D plugin"
,lattreid,2011-06-01T14:31Z,THANKS!
,Rush1,2011-06-04T20:21Z,"Hi to all,
I dled CS5 from ""thingy"" and followed the instructions accurately during installation........
it installed perfectly but as soon as i'd open a file the prog would crash.....i tried 
copying the dll files to the prog folder and even uninstalled and re-installed CS5.....still the same
problem......fed up, i uninstalld it, then dled another torrent from ""AngRdz"" and tried it......still the same f***ng issue of crashing.. ..... i was going nuts trying to figure out a solution......then i remembered 
that a few months ago i had the same problem with another software, and a friend had asked me to try
running the app in ""compatibility mode""........so now, i tried that with CS5 and  BINGO !!!.....no more crashes....
works just perfect........(i've got Windows7 and now running CS5 in Windows XP-SP2)

if you have Win7 and facing similar problems dont curse the uploader.......these guys are doing a fantastic 
job getting these softwares for you practically free!!!......what you should do is>>
>> right-click on the program launch exe 
>>from the options select ""Run in Compatibility Mode""  or ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"" 
>> in the window that pops up click ""Try Recommended Settings"" 
>> in the next window click ""Start the Program""
>> program will start 
>>go back to the Program Compatibility window and click ""Next""
>> in the next window click ""Yes, save these settings for this program""
>> you're done........hereafter you just have to click on the program icon and it will run with the saved settings.

THANXX    TO  'the thingy""   and   ""AngRdz""  for  GREAT UPLOADS !!!! ........Keep up the Good Work !!"

,Verkil,2011-06-12T02:18Z,This installer no longer needs to edit the host files unlike others? Just install and use the serial here?
,Squilbo,2011-06-20T03:18Z,"Every time I load the program, it wants a serial number, saying the old one was invalid.  Also, whenever I open a file or try to start a new one, the program crashes.  This is extremely irritating."
,Haparanda,2011-07-07T15:50Z,"After the install, i close the program and start it again, i enter the key, then i need to login with my adobe id? how can i get around it?"

I installed this torrent on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, then used one of the serials in Carlos' torrent.  From Carlos' torrent, I clicked on the ""open this.bat"" (batch file) and then ""CS5 Activation DLL"".  Restarted the system and bam, I'm using CS5.  "
,ViolentC,2011-07-21T11:03Z,"Working as intended. Windows 7 64bit. - Thanks you. I used this install method. no mounting required.

,misteragez,2011-07-27T01:46Z,Can't get past this Adobe ID!! I even created an Adobe ID and it still won't let me open the program so this is pretty much useless to me. Is there a way around this?
