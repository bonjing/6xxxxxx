Nothing like an impulsive act to take you down a path you hadnâ€™t expected in life. For engineer Peter Riedel and his interior designer wife Mary, their sudden whim was to purchase an 1870â€™s church for $20,000. It wasnâ€™t even upright at the time and all they got was a pile of boards. Still, it captured their imagination and a plan took shape to re-build the church on their property, overlooking Wilsons Promontory and convert it into a house. Like putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle, their biggest challenge is the number of pieces missing.
