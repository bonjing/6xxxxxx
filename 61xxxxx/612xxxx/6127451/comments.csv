nah, just start it in the evening and it should be complete before dawn."
,phrozenstare,2011-06-26T05:54Z,seriously? not everyone has fast Internet like fiber or possibly cable. if your Internet is DSL and only have 7-10MB bandwidth for downloading a 20GB file its going to take way more than an evening to download it
,beardownUA,2011-06-29T08:19Z,"Thanks a ton for this. Great film, and I've been looking for the remastered bluray release. I'll comment on video/audio quality once it downloads"
,Zeptinune,2011-08-25T21:55Z,"Dunno what age you guys are living in. I downloaded this in about 2 hours or so. I pay 35â‚¬ a month for internet...

I have to say though that I'm used to getting movies in about 20 minutes so coming back after an hour and seeing it only half done made me check what day it was.. seriously.

This is without a doubt the biggest movie I've ever downloaded. It's even bigger than the Extended 1080p Avatar movie I downloaded which was only 15Gb. But the quality is well worth it. This is amazing quality. I think my 37"" inch LED TV actually got a run for it's money.

,icepax,2011-10-06T12:58Z,"Not 1080p cause video resolution has to be 1920x1080 which this torrent is not...

It's 1920x816..."
,icepax,2011-10-06T13:21Z,I think the torrent label is misleading - this is NOT 1080p as it only has a resolution of 1920x816...
,thewoodishard,2011-10-09T16:47Z,"Thanks for the upload, this is the biggest film download i have ever done, was worried it would take forever with my 8mb dsl but amazingly did 15gb in under 7hours over night. did the rest the following night"

I know its been a couple months but I thought I'd explain. 1920x1080 is 1080p. 1920x816 is also 1080p because it's the exact same movie just with the black bars cropped off. Because it starts with the resolution 1920, it means its 1080p. Just like if you were grabbing a 720p movie. 1280x720 is 720p but if you grabbed a movie that was 1280x544. It's still 720p just with the black bars cropped off the top and bottom. Hope that helps :D.
