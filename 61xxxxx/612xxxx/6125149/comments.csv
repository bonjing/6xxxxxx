,complexness,2011-03-06T21:34Z,"Haven't read the book yet, but OCR quality. 4.5 average in Amazon, of 2 reviews.

These are the chapters, though: Miscellaneous math, Fractions, Decimals, Percentages, Algebra, Geometry. Those are pages 1-156. Answers are pages 157-220.

I guess I was hoping for something that targets to people more advanced in math. I guess at 5am in the morning without sleep, I forget that this kind of title probably won't give me that."
