TurboTax Accurately Guides You Step-By-Step To Your Maximum Refund. Guaranteed.1

Just like a GPS in your car, TurboTax literally maps out your return as you make your way to your maximum refund with these handy and helpful features:

   * Mapping icons: Know exactly what stage of your return you're in, and how far you need to go to finish
   * Set flags anywhere: Easily mark sections you need to revisit, so you can find them again later - without getting lost
   * Accuracy check: Double-checks your return for errors, helps you correct them and ensures every tax-saving opportunity has been found



What does this mean? It means that you can have confidence knowing your return is accurate. It means that you'll know exactly when one section is complete and you're ready to start another. It means that you'll know exactly where you are in your return, and how far is left to go. And it means that you're in control over how and when you prepare your return.

Imports Data From QuickBooks.

You can import your QuickBooks income and expense data directly into TurboTax 20.

By importing data from QuickBooks, you:

   * Enter less information than if you started from scratch
   * Lessen the room for errors
   * Save time while improving accuracy
