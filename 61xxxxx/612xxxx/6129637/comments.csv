,strowg9,2011-02-28T21:56Z,Keygen doesn't work. Download this version instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6104371/Turbotax_2010_Canadian
,strowg9,2011-02-28T22:03Z,"Sorry, actually looks like the directions are just off by a bit. The other link I posted above ends up including the same keygen--you have to select PLATINUM as the version instead of PRO 20 like is outlined in these directions.

Thanks for the upload nick_512, it's always a little tricky getting software specific for Canada!"

,jonybravo01,2011-05-24T07:34Z,"Guys - I need some expert advice. I followed all the instructions listed, and when I add the Computer Key from the Turbo Tax program to Key Gen and click (+) sign on the KeyGen; it shows me the machine number on top and the other details (so far so good)

When I go back to the turbo tax program, it still asks for Activation Code and does not let me hit 'Finish' key or next key until I put the Activation code from KeyGen to the program. Once I do that, it says 'Bad Activation Code' and that the code you enetered is invalid.

Am I doing something wrong or missing something .. Your help will be greatly appreciated. "
,Deadaus,2012-03-24T20:33Z,"Hate to bust everyoneâs bubble but TurboTax is checking the serial you use to see if it is valid or not this year. Meaning if you use the keygen, you will be able to use the software and complete your taxes but you will NOT be able to print in PDF and you will NOT be able to Netfile or Telefile. Which most people need to file their taxes.

At least they give you the option to save you return for all the hard effort you put in. Just have to go and buy a valid copy"
