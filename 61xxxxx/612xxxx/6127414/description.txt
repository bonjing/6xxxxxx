An external scrape of WikiLeaks.info (expands to just 160 KB), mirror.wikileaks.info (188 MB), and file.wikileaks.info (1.9 GB).  Some links don't work right.  The .orig files are in place, so you can also update with `wget`.		

This is somewhat less important to seed than the WikiLeaks.CH scrape -- see http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6126315/ -- and of course the semi-daily "cablegate-YYYYMMDDHHMM.7z" snapshots.
