Speech by Hollie Greenwood at the Health and Freedom Conference.  It is a phenomenal speech on healthy eating in the spirit of Weston A. Price.  Weston Price traveled the world documenting cultures that have longevity and good health.  He found that a natural diet resulted in healthy and happy people with none of the degenerative diseases of modern society.  Hollie encapsulates much of this extremely well in her 1 hour speech.
