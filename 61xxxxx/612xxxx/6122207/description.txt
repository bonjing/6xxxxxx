Why have the Castaneda MOVIEs and his adventures with the shaman Don Juan not been made? 
They could be as exiting as Lord of the Rings etc.

The closest shot, I guess, is this film about Carlos life: Enigma of a Sorcerer.

Enjoy and please upload all you got with Carlos 
(and by the way: Matirx 6 has come, by Val Valerian, but where is it?)
