In the United States, its debut marked Spears as the second artist in history to debut at number one more than once, behind Mariah Carey. The song also made her the first female and third overall female to score #1 singles in three consecutive decades: the 90's, 00's, and 10's. Additionally, the single has reached number one in Finland and has charted in the top ten in countries such as Australia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom, while still impacting on other charts worldwide.
