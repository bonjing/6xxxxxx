I had problem installing the cd1
I got this error :
Invalid JeppView serial number. Please re-enter your JeppView serial number.
If anyone has the serial, please help us ! Thanks."
,warloot24k,2011-01-31T02:11Z,"to: yass_pl

As always.... this has been the problem of new users ever since..... 

You need to uninstall the Jeppview program 3.5 first.... then install it again..... but before you install the latest update..... (that is what they usually do that is why it is asking for the new keys) download the update 01-09 cycle (you can get this here in piratebay) then install this.... so when you register, the old key will be accepted (KCAB-R00D)...... after you have successfully registered jeppview.... then that is the time you can install the latest update (1102).  Goodluck!"
,pilot320200,2011-01-31T04:50Z,"Hey! Downloaded the torrent one more time, used MagicIso and Disk#2 worked this time, so thanks a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,yass_pl,2011-02-02T02:09Z,"I finnaly get it working, here is the tip, i just copy that from a forum, thanks a lot guys!!

 1.Disconnect Internet
 2.Set computer clock for Jan 10, 2009
 3.select both Jeppview and Flitedeck programs
 4.use as name : PILOTS
 5.use serial  : VNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F ( this will give you Full Worldwide access )

now you need the other two CDs.
you MUST get version 01/2009

install CD1 using following 2 serials:

for VFR Europe : 217AN22318
for Full Worldwide : 217AN22319

install CD2 (no serial here...)

 6.Do not reboot
 7.Run Jeppview or Flitedeck
 8.Program prompts for 30-day free use or Activation
 9.press NEXT
10.Select ""by phone"" option and press NEXT
11.use the code R00D-KCAB (r-zero-zero-d) not ROOD (r-o-o-d)  !!!!

12. set now the current date on computer clock !!!
