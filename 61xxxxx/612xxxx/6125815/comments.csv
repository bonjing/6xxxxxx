,Blazer92,2011-01-25T06:45Z,PLS Enjoy and refine this torrnet if u can please make it one file with all the features intact Thanx
,Blazer92,2011-01-28T10:20Z,Please Seed!
,Blazer92,2011-01-30T03:46Z,I have alot off people stuck at 99.8% the torrent wont finish so they cant seed. what can do to help complete the download
,nyder,2011-01-31T23:23Z,"ya, no shit.  I've been at 98.8% for a week now, I'd be seeding it if the original seeder would actually lower his number of seeds so this can finish on someone.  when I connect to him, i'm lucky enough to get 1.5kbs"
,nyder,2011-01-31T23:25Z,"ah, sorry, blazer, didn't realize that was you who posted this.  I will seed if for sure, if I can ever finish it.  It might be you have too much stuff seeding and can't get the bandwidth going to for anyone to finish this.  lol"
,steeton,2011-02-01T06:01Z,"Can somebody seed, its been on 99.8% for 3days and not moving"
,024N,2011-02-02T10:30Z,There's something wrong with this torrent. I have same problem with steeton. It's been stuck on %99.8 for days now. When i start my computer in the morning it connects to the one and only seed downloads slowly for a while to the %99.9 and it stops and back to 99.8

,Blazer92,2011-02-10T10:33Z,Ive stopped seeding all my other torrents lets see wat happens
,Blazer92,2011-02-10T10:58Z,im uploading at 120kB/s and im still not gettin any to one past 99.8% wat now
,theRealOnes,2011-02-18T23:52Z,"It seems like everyone is stuck at 99.8%. If you want, you can upload these files (THE_OFFICE.Title10.mp4, THE_OFFICE.Title10.sub, THE_OFFICE.Title11.mp4) to an HTTP host and I'll seed it."
,Blazer92,2011-02-19T08:57Z,How do i do that?
,theRealOnes,2011-02-20T03:09Z,"I am trying to post instructions here, but TPB won't let me. Hit me up on twitter : theReal0n3"
,theRealOnes,2011-02-22T16:50Z,"You have a corrupted piece, Blazer. So no matter how hard you try to upload it, everyone on the receiving it will discard it upon completion because it fails the hash-check.

This is never going to finish."
,theRealOnes,2011-02-22T16:51Z,"You could verify that by stopping the torrent, right click on it, and run ""Force Re-check."" You'll see that you have a corrupted piece."
,Blazer92,2011-02-23T13:13Z,i deleted the torrent ill get around to uploading again hopefully with a lil better luck this time
