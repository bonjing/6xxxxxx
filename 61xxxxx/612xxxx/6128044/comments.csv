,Traziz,2011-01-26T16:09Z,Last night's show was only a 1hr episode (minus the commercials) the next episode is tonight I do believe.
,fakeasdf,2011-01-26T16:27Z,The state of the union was on this week which is why it was a 1 hour episode and the next episode (which will be 2 hours) will be on next week.
