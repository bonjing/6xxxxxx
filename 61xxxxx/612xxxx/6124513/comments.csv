I recently downgraded my Comcast cable internet to its new ""economy"" option which decreases the overall speed so I expected it take a while but this is insane.  In comparison, I downloaded 5 seasons of the tv show Supernatural (14.41 GB) in about 2 days.  I'm seriously doubting that having this movie dubbed in English is worth the wait.  I'm not waiting for this long for ""Hornet's Nest,"" instead I'll suck it up and read the subtitles."
