,LTComm,2011-01-26T19:02Z,"Graphics - good , dialogues - good, idea/plot - awfull. As though no one played dead space while making the movie."
,yetti12,2011-01-26T21:59Z,"Can i make a request plz..

1. the dilemma
2. No strings attached

Thank you, and thanks for all the uploads!"
,Akademien1,2011-01-27T00:04Z,"When does this take place in the storyline? Don't want to spoil anything before playing Dead Space 2. If it's set after the game, that is :P"
,AKAtheA,2011-01-27T01:38Z,1280x528 is NOT 720p!!!
,disimagery2,2011-01-27T02:10Z,it is 720p- is more extremely letterboxed [2:35:1] is all [go to imdb and do a bit of investigating before jumping on their backs mate]!
,kimjongwil,2011-01-27T03:15Z,where's the crack for this? haha
,Rottern,2011-01-27T03:53Z,"@Akademien1

Its place in the storyline in just after the end of Dead Space, when the USG O'Bannon is sent to investigate the Ishimura. The movie is meant to bridge the two games and show what happened in between."
,R3ZBAK,2011-01-27T12:27Z,Is this the second movie? or the first movie for this game? 
,hugh-jass,2011-01-27T15:51Z,"can this be watched straight on laptop or does it gota be burned to disc and played in an actual bluray player?? sorry im new to bluray rips!
