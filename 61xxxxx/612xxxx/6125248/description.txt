Description

Swipe it, swirl it, twist it, twirl itâ€¦ It's a top, but not like any from this worldâ€¦ It's cosmic!


Cosmic Top is a virtual toy, a 3D audiovisual physics simulation of a spinning, wobbling, and sometimes morphing top.

Seeming to float among stars, the top can take on unlimited shapes and sounds which appear to glow and hum from within your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch.

You control the top with your touch and can experience its sights and sounds at any angle by moving your device around.


HOW TO PLAY --- Simple and intuitive touch and motion gestures give you full control.
- Swipe around the top's center to generate a kaleidoscopic spin
- Swipe through the top's center to produce a tumbling spin
- Hold with one or more touches to brake and stop it
- Hold and swipe at the same time for a special spin that gets the top spinning on its axis. Once special spin is started, move a single touch to change the direction of the spinning axis
- Pinch in to see a smaller, quieter top or pinch out to experience a bright, fullscreen light show
- Tap to the left or right to navigate among all the unique and colorful tops
- Rotate your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad to see and hear the top from all sides


SETTINGS --- Basic and easy to use settings appear with a tap of an arrow. When the settings are displayed, you can still play with the top.
- Turn off the sound to listen to your iPod music
- Turn gravity on to see it nod and precess like a top in the real world
- Turn the brake off and watch it get cosmic by rotating endlessly like a space station, satellite, or UFO
- Lock the view to experience a different perspective with the stars and gravity's direction fixed within the display
- And best of all, a tap of the cosmic button will randomly create a new cosmos of tops


In no time, the magic of its gyroscopic and kaleidoscopic wheeling, whirring, and whirling will hypnotize you.


FEATURESâ€¨
- Realistic physics simulation via Euler's equations for rotating bodies
- 3D graphics and audioâ€¨
- Simple and intuitive multi-touch control with up to 11 active touches on iPad, 5 on iPhone and iPod touchâ€¨
- Uses Retina display and Three-axis gyro , if available
- Optimized for high animation frame rate for each iOS device
- Unlimited shapes and sounds generated from randomized mathematical functions providing lots of replay value
- Fun for both young and old


Cosmic Top is an entertaining way to show off your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. We hope you enjoy it.
