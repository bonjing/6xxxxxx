,vhordnes,2011-02-12T21:51Z,Are these free to use or do you have to pay in order to install/use the application? Thanks anyhow :)
,Rottweiler-fan,2011-02-16T00:07Z,"to jhnew3. everyone has to start someware...
connect your phone to your pc/laptop then look for your sd card. when you`ve found it copy and paste the .apk file that you want to use onto the sd card. Make sure that your phone settings allow install of non-Market applications. disconnect ur phone when done then search for the application on ur sd card then install. hope this helps mate..
Hats off to you mate and stay safe."
,dezontk101,2011-02-16T11:35Z,"These apps are all free. 

If you get them from here! Otherwise you would have to pay :)

Also once you've installed you can update them from your phone with no issues, no subscriptions, no logins... etc. They just update by themself."
