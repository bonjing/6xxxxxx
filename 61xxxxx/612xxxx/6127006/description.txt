Description


AN ALL-NEW DEAD SPACE STORY â€“ EXCLUSIVELY FOR iOS.

Immerse yourself in events that set the stage for the action-horror storyline of Dead Spaceâ„¢ 2. Featuring a hardcore game experience and a rich audio environment specifically designed for your iPhoneÂ® & iPod touchÂ®, this is an original vision of the acclaimed franchise and a true landmark game on the App Store. 


THE FIRST DEAD SPACE STORYLINE EVER DEVISED FOR iOS

Three years have passed since the destruction of the Marker in the first Dead Space story. Now, experience first-hand the events that unleash the Necromorph hordes once again. Youâ€™ll find yourself on a mission of uncertain purpose in the Mines of Titan. Soon, however, the truth of your situation will become grotesquely clearâ€¦


A CHARGED SENSORY EXPERIENCE WITH VIVID SOUND AND VISCERAL GRAPHICS

Featuring a fully voice-acted stereo soundtrack, plus a movie-quality score and sound effects, we recommend experiencing the game with headphones for full immersion. Hear every footstep in the empty passages and feel the tension build as you are pulled deeper into danger. With cutting-edge visuals, rich in effects and atmospheric lighting, Dead Space reproduces the cinematic horror of the console experience and sets a new benchmark for graphical fidelity on the iOS platform.


SPECIALLY DESIGNED CONTROLS KEEP YOU FOCUSED ON THE ACTION

Intuitive controls have been conceived to maximize the immersive experience of the game on iPhone & iPod touch. The on-screen HUD is seamlessly integrated into the game environment. Navigate 6 varied environments and battle Necromorphs with simple swipe and tap controls that offer accessibility without sacrificing depth. Nothing will break the spell of the storyâ€™s adrenaline-driven suspense.
