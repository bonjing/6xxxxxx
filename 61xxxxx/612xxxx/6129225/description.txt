The celebrated writer and philosopher David Foster Wallace distills the most important lessons he learned about life in this profound and witty manifesto.

Presented with the challenge of collecting all he believed about life, human nature, and lasting fulfillment into a brief talk, David Foster Wallace wrote this astonishing essay, which is published here for the first time. At the heart of his philosophy are the questions
 How do we keep from going through adult life unconsciously, comfortably entrenched in habit?
 How do we remove ourselves from the foreground of our thoughts and achieve compassion?
While searching for answers to these deceptively simple queries, he offers up comic observations of contemporary American life and probes the deepest fundamentals in human nature. In so doing, he reveals the most basic, most important decision we all make every day - how to think about our world.

Written with David Foster Wallace\'s one-of-a-kind blend of casual humor, exacting intellect, and practical philosophy, This Is Water probes the challenges of daily living and offers advice that renews us with every reading.
