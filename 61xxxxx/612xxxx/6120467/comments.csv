,EmptyVessel,2011-01-23T15:09Z,"thanks for the upload but i have a problem wondering if anyone else is having the same problem and weather they can sort it out, the game works fine untill i start  a mission and its ok ntill i press the select button on the field this makes it crash for sum reason it doesnt do it if i press select in battle but it like to randomly crass aswell, plz help if u can and thanks in advance,"
,R1skbreaker,2011-01-23T15:15Z,hey can you plz tell me if this is USA or EUR ver?
,NitrogenUA,2011-01-23T18:08Z,"I'll quote:

""Fixed it by starting a new game and NOT transferring demo save data.

If your using save data from the demo and it crashs when pressing select on the field i found it is because some of the items you have transfer accross but there names dont so they fill space in your bag but there is nothing there.

I fixed this by going to my item storage and taking out as many items as i could, it even showed up as im holding 16 items but i could still take more out. Doing this fixed the crash problem for me. hope this helps if anyoe else has the same prob.""

R1skbreaker, it is EUR."
,poch18,2011-01-26T05:15Z,"Anyone else having this problem? I was pretty sure that the demo had BGMs but to make sure i played the demo again and yeah,there are bgms but how come this one doesn't?"

,WarDest3ny,2011-09-02T13:28Z,"I know why theres one monster called Buhumut...because its from the creator of Final Fantasy : Square Enix ... im thinking why it name is Buhumut, just change the ""U's"" become ""A's""...its name is Bahamut"
,ust2,2012-04-27T05:39Z," It works perfectly fine, if it doesn't then you're doing something wrong :P Pretty decent game too, not unlike a monster hunter game.

 PS. also used UMDGEN to convert to CSO, it saves some precious space on these pathetic memcards lol.

 I was able to usethe full 9x compression with this one and havn't seen any slowdown."
