---------------Need Assistance-----------
Please suggest any good some converter. Some friend suggested one couple of times (thnks for their efforts), but I forgot the name. 
Is there any converter which can also remove pixelation (to any extent but effectively) in a video?
Tried to google but not much help. Same general softwares out there.
Thanks a lot in advance. "
