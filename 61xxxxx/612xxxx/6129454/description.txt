From Wiki:


Sam Roberts (born October 2, 1974) is a Juno Award-winning Canadian rock singer-songwriter, whose 2001 debut release, The Inhuman Condition, became one of the bestselling independent releases in Quebec and Canadian music history.

Born in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, to South African parents, he graduated from Loyola High School and McGill University. Roberts formed the band that was eventually known as William in 1993. The band's name was changed to Northstar in 1996. Although the band gained some notice in independent rock circles, they couldn't break through to a national audience, and broke up in 1999 after failing to release an album.[1] Roberts' bandmate George Donoso went on to significant success in indie rock circles with The Dears, but Roberts struggled for several years afterward.

After disbanding Northstar in 1999, Roberts promptly recorded the full-length and now very collectable independent debut Brother Down at home. In 2001, Roberts recorded and released a six-song EP[clarification needed], The Inhuman Condition, independently. The EP sold slowly at first, but following a re-release of the EP in the summer of 2002 on MapleMusic Recordings, his first single "Brother Down" became one of the biggest Canadian hits of the year, and the second single, "Don't Walk Away Eileen", followed suit in the fall.

Roberts then signed to Universal Music and released his full-length major label debut, We Were Born in a Flame, in June 2003. That album's singles, "Where Have All the Good People Gone?" and "Hard Road", received a large amount of success, though mainly just in Canada.

The band's second album, Chemical City, was released in Canada in April 2006. In Canada, the first single was "The Gate", which quickly shot to number one on Canadian rock radio. The second single in Canada was "Bridge to Nowhere". "With a Bullet", the third song used to promote the album on Canadian radio, received little attention and no video was made for it.

Roberts' most recent album, Love at the End of the World, was released in May 2008. It debuted at the number one position on the Canadian album chart,[2] a first for Roberts. The lead single, "Them Kids", debuted on iTunes on March 4, 2008.

Sam Roberts is trilingual, speaking English, French, and Spanish. He married his high school sweetheart Jen in 2004, and they have two daughters.[3]

Sam Roberts and his bandmates are finished recording their fourth studio album, "Collider", and will release it May 10, 2011







The Inhuman Condition 2001


The Inhuman Condition is the second solo studio release by Sam Roberts, a Canadian rock musician and singer/songwriter. This six-song EP made Roberts popular in the Canadian music scene. The EP peaked at #32 on the Canadian album chart after just nine weeks of being released. This is due mainly to the success of the first single, "Brother Down". The follow-up single, "Don't Walk Away Eileen", further increased the popularity of the EP in the winter of 2002-2003. The album has sold over 50,000 copies and has been certified Gold in Canada.

We Were Born In A Flame 2003


We Were Born in a Flame is considered to be the first commercially released LP by Sam Roberts, a Canadian rock musician and singer/songwriter. He previously released The Inhuman Condition EP and, in an extremely limited quantity, Brother Down. "Where Have All the Good People Gone?" was commercially released as a single in Canada and had a video made for it. "Hard Road" was also promoted with a video in Canada. Both "Don't Walk Away Eileen" and "Brother Down" had been previously used as radio/video singles to promote Roberts' previous EP, The Inhuman Condition, in Canada. In the United States, "Brother Down" was used to promote the album, while in the United Kingdom, "Don't Walk Away Eileen" was used.

Three songs, "Brother Down", "Don't Walk Away Eileen", and "Where Have All the Good People Gone?", were previously released on The Inhuman Condition. Both "Brother Down" and "Where Have All the Good People Gone?" were rerecorded for this album.

Earlier versions of "Brother Down", "Taj Mahal", "The Canadian Dream", "On The Run", "Climb Over Me", and "Paranoia" all previously appeared on Roberts' 2000 independently released Brother Down.

The album won two Juno Awards in 2004: Album Of The Year and Rock Album Of The Year. Roberts also won the Juno award for Artist Of The Year.
