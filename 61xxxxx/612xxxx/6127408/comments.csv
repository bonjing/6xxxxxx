,Candyman305,2011-02-28T23:44Z,"Everything seems to be working fine except when I use the conversation functions. When I click the record button it detects the sound. However, When I stop it, and try to play it, the button doesnt work, as if it is not saving what I am recording(saying).
    Any ideas for a fix?"
