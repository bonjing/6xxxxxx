 Please ignore the whiners, they will eventually pass through puberty."
,Pap45murF,2011-01-26T04:58Z,"Perfect upload.  But the comments are correct.  This movie is filled with silly, unrealistic things.  Shooting at the emergency button / gas tank comes to mind."

,9GustavBecker9,2011-02-12T06:26Z,"I called the producer of this movie yesterday, and asked him if a more appropriate title would be.... yes, you guessed it, ...""Unfuckable"". The preview commentary would be in the familiar dramatic overtones, and the announcer would read this script- Oh, and sounds will be denoted in parenthesis..., ""It was just another day in the railyard,(fart), the foreman was plowing the secretary up her poo-poo thingy, and since she was moaning so loudly,(moan...moan...grunt...queef), no one heard the locomotive(fart) get a boner and bolt out of the gate like a horny balls drag on floor bull. (burp) Once the large cock-shaft on wheels got going, there was no stopping it; it was pure iron erection, barreling down the track, choo-chooing it's blood filled enormous mass making clickety-clackety sounds resembling the foreman and secretaries pounding noises. Then the barreling hump-fucker approached a tunnel; it was dressed like a big, wet, pink, shaved pussy, drooling with anticipation for the fast runaway cock to train her.(fart)(burp)(moan) But... unknown to our friend the cock-dozer, the townfolk thought to trick the poor speeding shaft slammer; you see, they dressed the tunnel in this fashion, so they could trap poor big basher boner bro, because when it finally got to the proposed pussy perpetrator, the new improved title of this movie would be the yeilding result... (fart), ""Unfuckable"". Thank you and(fart) good night. Make sure you wipe you hinies and shower before you go to bed, too. Bye 'til next bout of limrical shit fuck stuff."
