 Son House's place, not only in the history of Delta blues, but in the overall history of the music, is a very high one indeed. He was a major innovator of the Delta style, along with his playing partners Charley Patton and Willie Brown. This set from Sony reissues the Son House Library of Congress recordings from 1941 and 1942. This material was previously issued on Biograph with a different cover ( he is uploaded in link!). The only real difference, besides improved sound quality, is the reversal of playing order of 'Delta Blues' and 'Levee Camp Blues.' Other highlights among the 15 remastered Delta blues tracks include 'American Defense,' 'Pony Blues,' and 'Special Rider Blues.'
This disc is recommended to anyone who has the slightest interest in early American acoustic blues.
The recordings on this CD were transferred from 50 year old acetate masters. Tracks 1-5 were recorded by Alan and Elizabeth Lomax and Lewis Jones at Clark's Store near Lake Cormorant, Mississippi on August 24-31, 1941 in collaboration with The Library Of Congress Archieve of American Folk Song.
Track 6-15 were recorded by Alan Lomax in Robinsonville, Mississippi on July 17, 1942 collaboration with Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee.
As has been indicated, some of these tracks were done at a country store-and indeed one can hear the train whistle from a nearby railroad, as well as a baby crying. This encompasses just a few seconds.
