This is the concert that was released under the name Live.... + 4. In this torrent you won't find the (+4) cause it was edited out when I got hold of it. It's a VHS rip which means that the quality is not the best but if you're a Frehley fan, it's awsome anyway. It's really worth the effort. ENJOY!
Setlist:
Rip it out
Something moved
Cold gin
Shock me
Breakout
Rocket ride
