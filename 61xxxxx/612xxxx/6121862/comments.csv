,Aftro,2011-01-23T18:19Z,"So this version includes SP 1 and i can install it directly, i dont need to have vista or any other version of 7 installed?
Just so that i know."
[V],thethingy,2011-01-23T18:25Z,"Aftro, yip"
,mcham,2011-01-23T20:02Z,"How is this different from the version you uploaded yesterday:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6120738/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_7_SP1_X64_ALL_EDITIONS_(activated)_[thethingy]

Looks the same to me, but maybe I am going blind..."
,mcham,2011-01-23T20:03Z,"Oh, this version has no activation patch and needs a separate activator (as shown in your links)?"
,riancarlos,2011-01-24T04:24Z,"yes, mcham. thats it!"
,Aftro,2011-01-24T06:11Z,"Yea the other one is already activated, or thats what the title says."
,ljo173f7,2011-01-25T16:51Z,Thanks!!!!   :-)
,BGTSSE,2011-01-29T13:14Z,Why size decrease so much from activated link? As I know it's about 1 MB. What difference from activated link?
[V],thethingy,2011-01-29T13:28Z,"BGTSSE, it's not that much, the activated has a loader + all the manufacturer themes and wallpapers. "
,principlemajor,2011-02-12T11:03Z,"Please seed for others to benefit from this also.

,Mclaren20,2011-04-06T16:31Z,"hi, i really need a product key 4 win7 ultimate sp1 64 bit plz any1 help kindly appreciated"
,createcoms,2012-02-04T21:15Z,Nobody is seeding...I've been seeding very slowly to try to make people share with each other but as soon as they hit 100% they are GONE (and their seed ratio is less than 1.0).  I'm going to stop seeding in another day or two because my ratio is way up there and nobody else seems to give a crap.
,wraithe001,2012-05-18T21:39Z,"Great release, saved me the time of doing it myself. Just curious, by ""all editions"" does that mean OEM & Retail, or just all editions of OEM?"
,sugrud,2012-06-23T16:16Z,Is it possible to beg for seeders on this?
