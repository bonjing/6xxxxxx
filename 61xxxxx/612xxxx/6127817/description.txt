                    Struggling to work for the family and care for  
                    baby Cilla, Micky comes up with a new way of  
                    making money: a fake website capturing credit  
                    card details of unsavoury users of other  
                    illegal websites. In a very Shameless take on  
                    the Robin Hood notion of robbing the rich to  
                    give to the poor, Micky and Aidan take from the  
                    really bad guys and give to those much more  
                    deserving - themselves! But it's not long  
                    before the police are alerted, and the family  
                    face ruin. Meanwhile, a morbid romance is in  
                    the air for Patty, who meets Trevor through her  
                    job on the local suicide helpline. And Libby is  
                    worried that Frank no longer wants to marry  
                    her, while Sita is sexually harassed by a  
                    schoolboy.
