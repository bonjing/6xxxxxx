Homer becomes obsessed with "Thicker than Waters," a 1980s family sitcom written by David Mamet, and models his parenting skills after the show's sensible father much to the chagrin of Bart, who desperately sets his sights on a brand new dirt bike. But when Homer insists that Bart must earn the dirt bike, Bart takes matters into his own hands and schemes with Russian and Chinese spies to provide top-secret information in exchange for the new bike. Later, James Lipton conducts an interview with a television cast on "Inside the Actor's Studio."
