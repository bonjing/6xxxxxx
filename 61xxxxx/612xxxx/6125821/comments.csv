,rakz2cul,2011-01-25T20:43Z,"please increase the video file size by 500mb-1gb...this is just a pure request...at the end of the day you are the boss
you have uploaded ""Takers.BRRIP.MP4.x264.720p"" with 2.71 GiB size while itune offers it around 3.42GB(HD)...just few more megabytes-that's what i'm asking...i know you can do it,even i used Handbrake 0.9.5 version...just few more MBs will not bother any playback issue on any device...you decide  "
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-25T20:59Z,get a lot of people complaining then that the file is too big.  yes its very simple for me to make bigger.  just change 3072 to 4096.
,rakz2cul,2011-01-25T22:39Z,"That's for sure that some people will complain, but you will attract new people too. The people who will be complaining, they donâ€™t care about your files stays alive for longer period or not. They donâ€™t care for seed; they only try to get the files as soon as possible. Just look at the status of your old uploads. I was trying to download An Education (2009) but there were no seeds at all compare to â€œAn Education 2009 720p BluRay x264 ALLiANCEâ€ (uploaded by aoloffline)
You are just uploading files for bunch of amateurs. You are putting really good afford by re-encoding those big files. I am just saying that you can also cater to the pros too. You have the iPod version uploads, that full fill the requirement of the amateurs.
You can relay attract the people who donâ€™t like to download every movie in large file size but conscious about the quality too. I can guarantee you that, these people are very large in numbers
You can become ""-jonny-"",""aoloffline"",""GoodFilms"" on the other hand you can become ""secretmyth"" your choice bro!"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-25T23:35Z,"""-jonny-"",""aoloffline"",""GoodFilms"" only upload scene releases.  aoloffline is popular because he upload scene release.  He doesn't create those files.  Most re-encoder only become popular if they are affiliated with another site that promotes them ""featured download"".  My files do well if they are promoted.  Otherwise they are only mediocre.

head to head the scene release should win everytime.  it is promoted everywhere.  its not about quality, its about advertising.  If my encode was crap it will get very large download if it is featured on the front page of any torrent site.  this is proven time and time again.  look at torrents that are complete crap with high users on them and you will see they are pushed on another torrent site front page.

[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-25T23:37Z,only reason why this torrent is doing good is because ET promoted it for a few hours.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-26T03:10Z,"furthermore these really aren't even done correctly.  they should be done with like a crf 18 and then take the bitrate used from the crf encode and do a 2 pass with that bitrate.  That would produce a far more reliable quality encode.  If this was truly being produced for mass pay market that is how they should be done.   This is faster though just doing a blanket bitrate for everything.  Some material suffers while others are probably too high bitrate.  Constant action movies will suffer, dramas will generally be superb."
,Sarah23au,2011-01-28T00:24Z,Thanks HolyRoses. I really appreciate your smaller files. Cheers.
,rawluck,2011-09-22T21:18Z,"Thanx a lot for the upload. 

What's the point in bigger size, if the quality is already good. Small size always a plus if quality is not compromised. 

Thanx once again."
