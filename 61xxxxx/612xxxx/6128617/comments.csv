Just need to seed it first..."
,ieeka_joe,2011-01-26T12:03Z,Seed !!! 30 leachers 0 Seeders !!
,thisguyx81,2011-01-26T12:17Z,Is this just the songs or a recording of the whole thing from triple J?  I tried to record it but it failed and I'm looking for the whole thing not just the songs.
,supersnazz2000,2011-01-26T12:44Z,"It's from CD's and digital downloads. All V0, not recorded off the air. Won't be too long before the whole thing explodes with seeds"
,sethwish,2011-01-26T14:05Z,"SEED, YOU MOTHERFUCKERS. PLEASE.

,TheStich,2011-01-26T15:08Z,"All good now - although very few seeders, there's enough info out there and d/ling nicely!
Big Ups to supersnazz2000

Will be seeding for a month or two. "
,hilaryam89,2011-01-27T11:29Z,"I love you supersnazz2000. I'd say ""seeeeddd people!"", but that means nothing to all the nasty leechers out there, so I'll just shut up."
,kizegan,2011-01-28T00:47Z,"Thanks for this, can't wait till it downloads. Couldn't listen to it while I was in Washington DC"
