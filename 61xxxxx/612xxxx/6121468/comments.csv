Grant Morrison is great but the story can get a bit weird and hard to follow at times.  This is a follow-on of Final Crisis where Batman died but has now come back traveling through time popping up in various eras.  I brought the deluxe hardcover edition of this while I was in New Zealand for something to read and was really impressed.  Love all the different versions of Batman, such as cave man Batman and Pirate Batman, and the artwork of the Batman variations makes the saga an amazing read.  However, its a shame the story wasn't drawn out more, as the different eras are quite short thus each subplot is quick n simple.

Still Give it a read.  Especially if u have being following the final crisis saga.  I downloaded the complete story from PB but it doesn't include this.  

I hope this was helpful.  "
