,THEPIRATERABBI,2011-03-06T22:32Z,"good movie.
bad quality.
watchable.
thanx any way."
,truthy,2011-06-18T14:30Z,"mhm the video quality is quite bad for it's size. 300-500 mb for audio is just, sry stupid. movie length is from 2h 23m to 2h 48m - if you or whoever encoded this would have used 128 kbit VBR Audio bitrate the video would have been watchable but they way it is now, it's just a waste of bandwidth in my opinon."
,truthy,2011-06-18T14:34Z,a good rip with almost the same size can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425052/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Trilogy_BRRip_XviD_multi_sub_SiNUHE
