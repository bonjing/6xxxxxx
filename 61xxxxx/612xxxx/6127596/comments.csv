,djb3000,2011-01-26T08:38Z,Could people comment please and let me know if this is installing ok? ive had no comments so im assuming its working fine!
,ribbedie,2011-01-27T11:11Z,"It works really well. Easy install if you follow the instructions. (Windows 7, 32 bit machine). Thanks a million!"
,MEgra,2011-01-27T16:01Z,"I've followed the instructions supplied to install it, but when I try to run the program I get prompted to enter a serial number. I used the one supplied but it comes up invalid. Help please?"
,djb3000,2011-01-27T18:29Z,"@MEgra

Do you have facebook? i will talk you through it if you like you can also activate it manually looks like something went wrong."
,MEgra,2011-01-27T20:10Z,"Yeah I'm on fb, but would rather not post my url here for obvious reasons. Is there another way I can contact you which doesn't involve publicly implicating myself in software theft? lol"
,sacropages,2011-01-27T21:20Z,Does this work on 64-bit machines? or will I be the first to find out?
,sacropages,2011-01-27T21:56Z,"yeah. doesnt work with 64-bit. I'm getting an error after running the crack ""0 copies found"" or something like that. and then the serial code doesnt work."
,Lucas_mucas,2011-01-27T22:09Z,"Hey, i really appreciate you uploading this and i desperately need it working tonight for coursework due in tomorrow :( however same problems as the above comments, i enter the serial number, and it says invalid, please offer a solution to this problem :) thankyou very much"
,MEgra,2011-01-27T22:43Z,"Oops forgot to mention, I'm using windows vista, 32 bit machine. When I run the crack program the message 'The system cannot find the specified path' appears three times in the cmd window followed by the ""operation complete, now run registry key, press any key.... etc"" message."
,MEgra,2011-01-27T23:16Z,"Right I have managed to sort out my problem. If anyone has had the same trouble as me (see above comments) what you must do is:

1. Unzip the .rar file fully.
2. Install sibelius by running setup.exe, found in the SETUP FILES folder.
3. Move the files named ""Resources.dll"", ""SARILib.dll"" and ""sibelius.exe"" from the CRACK FILES folder to C:\Program Files\Sibelius Software\Sibelius 6. (make sure the SARILib.dll and sibelius.exe files replace the ones already there).
4. Run the sibelius registry key, found in CRACK FILES.
5. Run sibelius, enter the serial number provided and it should work.

I'm shit with computers and this may be wrong, but it appears to have worked. Only thing is, it's nagging me to register the product online which I'm loathe to do. Any suggestions?"
,MEgra,2011-01-27T23:27Z,"I've searched the internet and there does not seem to be any sibelius 6 product keygens available at the moment. Could someone post a link here if they ever find any?

Oh, and thanks very much djb3000 for the upload =)"
,Yuujin,2011-01-29T22:06Z,the serial number is invalid
,Yuujin,2011-01-29T22:07Z,and it couldn't find the path
,stubbly,2011-01-30T14:19Z,"Doesn't work on 64-bit Windows 7. 

Have copied the crack files manually into the instalation directory and applied the reg fix but still get unspecified error when running the program as admin."
,djb3000,2011-01-30T15:35Z,"Sorry guy's i have not been on my computer for a few days i have only tested this on Windows 7 (32Bit) thats what i wrote the automated patcher for also but it should work for XP & Vista 32 bit also can anybody confirm this?

oh and MEgra glad you got it working in the end."
,eajans,2011-01-31T20:49Z,"Thx djb3000! Got it working but...
what to do with `rigister the product`? HELP"
,eajans,2011-01-31T20:50Z,"Thx djb3000! Got it working but...
what to do with `rigister the product`? HELP"
,djsimmey,2011-02-01T00:42Z,"Hey Guys

Got it working on Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit and also Ubuntu... 

If you have windows 7 64bit try downloading Ubuntu from the Ubuntu website its a ISO image and burn it to a disc then Install it, it will give u the option to split Partitions in your Harddrive so you can have Windows 7 and also Ubuntu operating system...... Then you will be able to use Sibelius :D Simple......"
,Simonlikesblack,2011-02-02T17:56Z,"The serial key wasn't working for me either.. the fix is this. (I followed all the steps first and it didn't work) 
Move all the other files in the crack folder into the 'c:programfiles (x86)/Sibelius Software' replacing them all...
note - The resources.dll went in the resource folder.
after that it worked, didn't even need to type in the serial."
,MarimbaMan13,2011-02-05T12:00Z,"Hi, everything has worked on my Vista, all except playback and sounds in general using sibelius. Help? Thanks!"
,Blitzbok,2011-02-06T03:47Z,The key does not work. I have the folder in C: and the crack will not recognise the path. What more can I do? 
,eajans,2011-02-06T13:54Z,"Hi ya all, I've done what Simonlikesblack said.
And YESSSSS it's working, no SNR needed anymore! 
Many thx and let's make music."
,mikeoxlongerthanyours,2011-02-08T04:20Z,"Sweet, could anyone help by referring me to a good torrent of Virtual Drumline? or could some one upload it? I cant find it anywhere and it would help so much if i had it."
,biblerocket,2011-02-11T03:52Z,I'm having an issue with the serial number. I put the one provided but it keeps telling me it's the wrong one :(
,kevkev12345,2011-02-18T10:20Z,"when i run the run to crack it has 4 lines of th system cannot find the path, little help please? i have copied  the whle file to C Drive so i cant see what the problem is"
,1ns4n1ty,2011-02-21T01:00Z,"@kevkev12345
 If message ""the system cannot find the path"" appears the problem could be that your Local disk(C:) directory is named differently. Try renaming it: just delete any name that is now given (the default name will appear) and try installation again."
,Erik_r,2011-03-03T11:32Z,Thanks megra! Your instructions worked fo me aswell.
,alantom,2011-03-05T19:55Z,"thankyou i can confirm it works on xp
what i did was run setup then run the batch and the registration entry. i tried putting serial in and did not work. then i realised that i had to add the sibelius.exe crack file, sarlib.dll and the resource.dll into the the sibelius program and it works fine."
,dombreguete,2011-03-10T17:42Z,"E ai galera, aqui esta rodando muito bem em win7 64bits. Pra quem está com dificuldade, é só seguir a dica do Simonlikesblack acima, e vai funcionar normal sem precisar de serial. vlw."

,drphildobaggins,2011-03-15T03:44Z,"Follow Instructions in comments for Windows 7 64bit.

Excellent and working"
,DrBob1238,2011-03-27T15:46Z,"I followed all the directions. and i tried what Megra said to do, and when i try to open sibelius it tells me it must be run as an administrator for the first time. when i click ""ok"" it gives me an unspecified error message."
,drphildobaggins,2011-03-28T19:15Z,No Audioscore/Photoscore lite? Thought it was included?
,mythicalflame,2011-03-30T22:30Z,"The serial number isn't working. Any help? I've tried what Simonlikesblack said, but, I still need to enter a serial number. "
,pirate0096,2011-04-09T18:28Z,"I followed every step just fine until this:

5) Now launch Sibelius 6 from your start menu and if required use the following serial number>>> INC111111111111NoPE

When I launch sibelius I get an ""Unspecified error"" and I can't get any further. I'm using win7 64-bit. Anyone who knows what's wrong?"
,goldbergjbg,2011-04-11T00:44Z,"Hey djb3000, i did everything it said all the way up the very last instruction but then when i opened up start and began Sibelius 6, it asked for a serial number and when i tried to use to the one that was given, it came back saying it was an invalid key. So now i have no clue what to do about it... can you help me please?"
,LordRaz12,2011-04-11T09:03Z,"Hey guys, if you're running in to the ""unspecified error"" message like I was, here's what I'd recommend doing:
1) Uninstall the failing version and install the program again to get a fresh install
2) Run the program WITHOUT the crack
3) When prompted for the serial number, close the program.
4) Make copies of the SARLib.dll and the Resources.dll files. 
5) Copy the cracked sibelius.exe into the installation directory
6) Run the cracked sibelius.exe and hit cancel when asked for the serial number (it should continue to open anyway)
7) Close the program, and copy in the cracked SARLib.dll and Resources.dll files. 

It should now work just fine. I have no idea what the problem is but it worked perfectly for me.

Hope this helps.

Also, for those of you who are having problems running the CRACK AUTOMATICALLY bat file (you're running into a file not found problem), the directory to which you installed Sibelius is not the same as the directory listed in the bat file. If that happens, just do this:
1) Copy sibelius.exe and sarlib.dll into the install directory manually,
2) Copy Resources.dll into /resources/ 

Done. Enjoy!"
,dalepizz,2011-04-13T18:48Z,"If you have the error message when trying to run the CRACK AUTOMATICALLY .bat file and you are using windows 7, the answer is SIMPLE! The .bat file targets c:/program files. So just open the program filesx86 folder, find sibelius, right click, select cut, then paste it into the regular program files folder. Then run sibelius and you dont even need the friggin key.  "
,musiclane,2011-04-24T18:17Z,got to the part where i have to open it from your start menu and it ask for the activation code. Copy and pasted and it said it was invalid. i typed it in myself and it said the same. wassup?
,mcandrewsmac,2011-04-25T02:34Z,"Ok guys, i realize this is probably easier than I'm making it, but I'm not the most technically-savvy. Here goes:

I'm on Win7 64bit, so I split the HD and installed Ubuntu. I ran the install like I thought I was supposed to, and then tried to open the CRACK AUTOMATICALLY file, but (as I said, I'm a noob, you'd say) i don't know how to run as administrator (do i even have to?) and it won't open. 
If you could kindly guide us ubuntu users, I'd appreciate it. "
,adonis40,2011-05-31T01:43Z,I also get the message that the serial number INC111111111111NoPE is not a valid number. Then I followed the advise from Lord Raz12. Then everything worked fine without asking for any serial number! Thank you LordRaz12 !
,adonis40,2011-05-31T01:47Z,I did NOT install the second time! It worked anyway. Thanks also to MEgra !

,magicvw,2011-07-13T21:33Z,"I have spent the whole evening trying to get this to work - still no success. The instructions on this are gobbledegook. There are two Sibelius 6 folders for starters, one inside the other, so which one are you supposed to put in C programs? I've tried it so many ways and uninstalled/reinstalled several times, I've tried to follow Lordraz12's instructions but for a noob like me they are unfathomable too. Are these instructions to be followed instead of the readme.txt file, or after part of it, which part? Where is the installation folder? In 4) you say make copies, but then what are you supposed to do with them - if you don't paste them anywhere till point 7? What a shambles!"

Thanks,  Heracles"
,oioioiiksdcfvgbhnj,2011-12-23T03:33Z,"I've worked out what the problem with the sound is.
When you open Sibelius, go to ""play"" in the menu at the top, and select ""playback devices...""
You need to actually activate playback devices to use them."

,haroldcrosby,2012-01-23T18:55Z,After getting assistance with this I am able to get there but it is a 15 trial non saving demo.  A serial number is needed- registration # not the same - Got one? Was it in the instructions?
