,rostbif,2011-02-26T15:51Z,My word that's a really random collection of tracks. How was this lot determined to be the top 1000 of the last 30 years? Oh and the number 1 track will 40 years old later this year ;-)
,stagman21,2011-03-20T01:06Z,"A truly hideous selection, but each to their own and bless you and your effort, Kahrahtaysbeddevil!"
,vertazzar,2011-04-02T18:55Z,"thanks for the effort, very nice collection."
,dommels,2011-04-24T13:52Z,"Uploader is german?
0009. Matthias Reim - Verdammt, ich lieb' dich
0010. Vader Abraham - Das Lied Der Schluempfe"
,NormandyIntl,2011-08-16T05:31Z,Really random but helps add a bit of variety to my collection which i like to use for broadcasting. lot's of german songs but doen't really matter to me. 1k songs in a single DL is pretty good lots of seeders too
