His Sergeant, \"Bat\" Batterson is an opera fan who admires Rossano and wishes Rossano to appraise his sister\'s singing voice. The rest of his platoon as well as the company commander disapproves of Batterson\'s showing favourtism to Rossano by excusing him from normal training. Rossano also schemes to have Master Sgt Batterson allow him to go to New York supposedly to have his manager appraise Batterson\'s sister, Brigit\'s singing voice but in reality allowing him to do a performance.
