,mrd2011,2011-01-25T09:29Z,thanks a bunch! any chance you would do either of the iron man movies? would law abiding citizen be a stretch?
,pc_nerd,2011-01-27T01:07Z,"Thanks for spending your time and effort for all us TPB users. Saving someone's wallet one torrent at a time...

I have a suggestion. Could you include an installer for an ISO mounter, for the people who don't have one?

P.S Just out of curiosity, do you have a quad core processor? If so, how long does it take to re-encode a movie? I'm considering to get one, because I convert videos/movies for mobile use but it takes so long."

,SaraOnDaRocks,2011-02-12T01:18Z,After I downloaded this torrent something or someone contacted my Service provider and filed a Notice of Claim of Copyright Infringement on my IP address. Just letting everyone know to maybe steer clear of this particular torrent!
,demon080291,2011-02-20T03:55Z,awesome quality! I have no trouble streaming the movie on my laptop. Great job! 
,pikagod,2011-03-21T09:54Z,"Hey, I don't normally comment but I had to say thank you for all these uploads.  It's saved me a lot of money and the videos are some of the best quality I've ever seen.  But I'm curious, how do you get this format?  I read that you don't use a program, you in fact do it yourself but is there any other way to get this?   This is the only format I've found that has THIS good of quality (I give it a 10 outta 10) that can stream straight to my xbox without transcoding, which means I can actually Fastforward and the like.  Thanks again :D"
,drewonline,2011-03-31T00:39Z,"Yes, nice thank you"
,pimpsquick,2011-04-13T21:46Z,"I tried playing the video once it was done downloading but when i clicked on [How to train your dragon - Bluray & AVCHD] folder it said..

((The archive is either unknown format or damaged)) 

Do i have to download a program another program thats not VLC media player for it to work or something?"

,Spree2009,2011-06-01T14:41Z,Would be cool if people actually seeded...
[T],HD-R-US,2011-07-11T16:52Z,"@everyone - You're welcome. Enjoy.

@pbxpb- Whether you see the mattes/letterbox/black bars will depend on which aspect ratio a movie was filmed in.

,Dianish,2011-07-25T07:48Z,"Great movie and thanks. Could you upload with danish audio as well ? Would be appreciated. 

""No speeding without seeding"""
,art00rz,2011-08-24T03:13Z,"I get a ""invalid file format"" trying to mount or open this on poweriso."
,art00rz,2011-08-24T03:22Z,"daemon tools lite did it though. I dunno why poweriso couldn't open it, it's not the first time I have trouble mounting images on it that I can mount normally with Daemon.

Anyway thanks!"
,NeegroJohnson,2011-09-18T14:40Z,WHAT THE FUCK!??? After I downloaded this qwest suspended my service they then sent me a email saying that paramount has sent them a notify that I had illegally downloaded a pirated movie. PEOPLE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT
,pschlosser,2012-01-28T00:26Z,"blast it.  I could not get VNC to play this ISO.  Nor, when mounted, would Alcohol 120% show me any files.  Too, bad. "
,CptnKojack,2012-04-27T21:46Z,I'm confused... This torrent is The Bounty Hunter... Not How To Train Your Dragon...
