,nepoelif_2,2011-01-27T15:06Z,"monova works OK, but there isn't any new content from tiki, vera99,sanvirel,TWO,gothica79,etc, that I saw.

I know I'm not going to be uploading any."
,XxlKooLaiDlxX,2011-01-27T15:31Z,"I've been using a image chan site that is great. All the models we're used to, but none of the bullshit attached like here with some trolls. All like-minded people in one place. I would post the site address but I've always lived by ""loose lips sink ships"". I decent enough search should find it though. It's awesome because they have Newstar Krystal sets posted up to 106 and the site is only at 96! My new home."
