,mholmes,2011-01-26T01:00Z,"I tried to install twice and it appears to have failed, since messages are in Russian I canât tell.
So I downloaded it a second time and tried to install and failed again, any ideas?"
[V],kentucky-kid,2011-01-26T06:57Z,"@mholmes

Go to google translate & translate the installer wordings from Russian to English,since u seems to have difficulties in it. Just bear with it during the installation, cause at a later part you will be able to change the language to english :-)"
,tpg_guard,2011-01-27T16:35Z,"Thanx kid, another good one.
Keep up the good work,"

""Your trial has expired"" it says. Is there a new serial number to use?"

,suprdav,2011-02-04T10:43Z,"@ronharding: I downloaded it a few days ago and ran the install file and worked fine for the first use. Now is asks me for a license. Says that the license it has is invalid. 
Any help?"
,ronharding,2011-02-04T11:29Z,"I downloaded and installed this torrent only to find that it installed a copy of Photo-S and not Adobe Acrobat X Pro.
How do I get your Acrobat X Pro torrent?

,theburrus,2011-02-14T02:10Z,WHY IS THIS ASKING ME FOR A SERIAL NUMBER AND NO ONE ELSE HAS HAD THAT PROBLEM? GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A CODE SOMEWHERE ONLINE NOW.... THOUGHT WAS A SMOOTH DOWNLOAD?
,some-young-guy,2011-02-21T20:22Z,"K-Kid is a great uploader, but in the event there are serial issues, perhaps checking out thethingy's upload.  Therein you will find a crack file to paste into the Acrobat directory in Prog Files, plus also there is a text file that has language to be added into the hosts file which continuously reroutes the updaters back into the host folder which is domiciled in your C: drive.  Ergo the program will make outgoing calls, but the Hosts redirects those calls back in house.

I also suggest going into any PDF hit hitting Ctrl/K to open the Preferences Window.  Scroll to the last option and turn off updater."
,some-young-guy,2011-02-21T20:28Z,"Here's a great option to a working torrent.

Thanks for the upload kid! U R the man :)"
,PepsikGTN,2011-03-07T10:51Z,hi anyone. i can't create pdf file. PDFMaker does not work
,sam12771,2011-03-21T16:14Z,can i upgrade from acrobat 9 Pro to acrobat x Pro using this torrent???
,mark2sell,2011-04-12T10:00Z,Great Job ! This worked like a charm for a novice like me. I had tried 3 or 4 other torrent down loads and followed instructions etc and at the end of the day it just did not work. This fine torrent did EXACTLY as advertised. Installed and simply works with no issues. Thanks K-Kid !!!
,jdubb22,2012-04-24T02:54Z,When I install the software upon it's first use it asks me to install a product code.... any fix for this?
