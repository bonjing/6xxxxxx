can u plss provide a working activator for windows xp"
[V],thethingy,2011-01-24T14:29Z,"arulkarthik, whats XP? , easiest thing to do would be to use a xp vl edition then just use a vl key so you don't need to activate"
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-01-24T14:39Z,Hi thethingy! I think that you and ChattChitto are the best uploaders on TPB. I just wanted to ask you that can you crack all the Adobe After Effects CS5 64xbit plug-ins that are on this site: http://www.adobe.com/products/plugins/aftereffects/ It doesn't matter for Mac OS or Windows OS. I ask you this question just because you have a talent in doing this. Please let me know then. Anyway thanks a lot and respect to you thethingy.
[V],Anacondaz,2011-01-24T14:43Z,thanks for ur reply mate

,flowover11,2011-01-26T01:06Z,What's the difference between Enterprise and Ultimate?
[V],thethingy,2011-01-26T01:42Z,"flowover11, same features but Enterprise is volume activation that means you can install the volume tools and additional desktop software"

,cgigate,2011-02-01T03:53Z,thethingy; you are the hero
,flowover11,2011-02-02T04:59Z,"@thethingy

what exactly are the extra tools? is it worth it vs ultimate? activation seems sketchy compared to tools such as 7loader for ultimate"
[V],thethingy,2011-02-03T12:20Z,"flowover11, activations a doddle, I use this one;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6097951

for this and office, it takes like 30 seconds, but the extra stuff is desktop network related and you can install the kms addons also, I use this on my laptop as its supported for 5 more years than ultimate so it should last the life of the laptop. "
,flowover11,2011-02-04T02:00Z,"@thethingy
alright thanks, but while im at it ive got a few more questions that i hope u wouldnt mind answering.

1. Does this enterprise include all previous updates/language packs? Any blocked/not included?

2. is the sp1 like 100% final and will be what windows update will offer for download soon?

3. is there a way to ""properly"" activate office 2010 plus? by proper i mean not having to keep rearming or have that 180 day grace thing.

thanks bro"
[V],thethingy,2011-02-05T01:35Z,"flowover11,

1) sp1 has thousands of updates and hotfixes, all from windows update and thousands that weren't released, no language packs but you will get offered language packs when they are put on windows update, you can get the language packs now though here;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6119895

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6119898

2) Its the same build, this isnt integrated like a update sp1 will be this is a ms sp1 build so no messy leftovers.

3) In the pro + torrents here;

http://thepiratebay.org/search/Microsoft%20Office%202010%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300

you will find in the comments details on how to permanently activate via phone. "
,kaptainsteve,2011-02-05T22:31Z,Thank you very much.
,flowover11,2011-02-06T04:33Z,"@thethingy
alright sounds good. final question

is this basically a copy of the DVD that will hit stores soon? 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6118670/MICROSOFT.WINDOWS.7.ULTIMATE.RTM.WITH.SP1.X64.RETAIL.ENGLISH.DVD

and how does it differ from the OEM? is there a way to activate a retail without changing the windows to an OEM key using 7loader?"
,bfbcr0x,2011-02-23T00:41Z,"Can't get SP1 activated.

Reproduction:
1. Installed Win7 Ultimate via torrent
2. Used RemoveWAT 2.2.5
3. Everything worked
4. Windows Update to SP1
5. RemoveWAT no longer effective as the KB it removed seems to be embedded in SP1.
6. Tried 7loader with default settings after removing RemoveWAT modifications, no success. Seems to work but still gives me ""Not Genuine"" message on login.
7. Tried WOAT_3.2, get an error with option A:
Input Error: Can not find script file ""C:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs"".  Also option B or C fails."
,legolash2o,2011-02-25T05:53Z,"bfbcr0x, Open RemoveWAT and uninstall it.

thethingy, thanks for the upload, is this MSDN/Technet version? Thanks again :)"
[V],thethingy,2011-03-03T17:50Z,"bfbcr0x, your problem is you used remove wat, just use whats linked in the torrent, remove wat is an old unsupported unreliable tool that dont work anymore, all remove wat does is gives you issues. "
,ricard257,2011-03-18T16:28Z,"hi can someone tell me what is the benifet of becoming an uploader/seeder/leecher...
