*I don\'t take requests because I don\'t have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don\'t play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I\'ll ask everybody to stop with the \"it doesn\'t work\",\"it\'s out of sync\" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
