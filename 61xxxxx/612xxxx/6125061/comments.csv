I used imgburn to burn to an iso file then mounted it on a virtual drive and used imgburn to burn to the hard drive of my Dvico Tivx HD olayer.
Playing it through my Onkyo TX-NR 906 it showed `Dolby Digital` and all 5.1 speakers produced sound. I flicked through several tracks from different albums and all sounded great, only problem was working out how to swap between the albums 1-3 (just press right or left arrow on the player!0.Maybe there is an easier way to burn this but it worked for me and I will try burning to a DVD disc and try it on my OPPO 95, will post if it works ok.
Thanks again and will seed."
