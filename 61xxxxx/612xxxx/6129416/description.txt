The Robert Johnson Songbook  was their second album. Green was the founder of Fleetwood Mac and a member of that group from 1967-70, before a sporadic solo career during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The album consisted entirely of songs composed by legendary blues artist Robert Johnson, and featured a guest appearance by Paul Rodgers, ex-lead vocalist of Free and Bad Company, who has lately been working with Queen.
This was the first Splinter Group album to feature Roger Cotton and Larry Tolfree, after the departure of Cozy Powell and Spike Edney.
The album won a WC Handy Award in 1999 for "Best Comeback Album".
