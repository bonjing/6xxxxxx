perfect quality:
Use our quality advisor to adjust the settings of your project to get the best quality.  See before you even start the conversion process what the quality will be and adjust settings for fine tuning. Never be disappointed again by poor quality results!
Blu-ray To DVD also uses our advanced Image Filter to converts images down from HD to SD (for compatibility with any DVD player).  Our image filter has already proven itself to be one of the best image resizing solutions on the market today.

Simplified with Advanced technology:
Our advanced discriminator technology does all the hard work for you behind the scenes.  Whether you want to convert a movie or a Blu-ray series, the discrimintor presents the main files you need and insures the correct ordering of the files.  This means no more sorting through long lists of video files wondering which file is the right one to select - our software does it all for you.  Not only that, but for films with multiple angles, a special preview module helps you choose which angle you want to convert. 	advanced features
	
Extra Fast:
Our software has been optimized for multi-core processors meaning you get even faster conversions.  Blu-ray to DVD uses NVIDIA CUDA technology during the decoding process of the video conversion saving you precious time on your video conversions. Using Cuda will reduce the amount of work done by your CPU by allowing your GPU to it instead.

----------------------------
The result will play on any DVD player.  Create a DVD for PAL or NTSC region and also select whether you want the result to be fullscreen or widescreen.  Create a DVD with multiple audio and subtitle files and select them like a real Blu-ray or DVD either via the menu or by using the subtitle button or your remote control to switch between the languages on your DVD.  A settings and chapter menu are created for easy navigation.  Our burning engine supports all DVD types and brands.
