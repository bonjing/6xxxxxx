                        ROCKY 1V HEARTS ON FIRE VIDEO                           
                        -----------------------------

This is the music video from the film Rocky 4 immediately after Adrian meets Rocky in Russia.

Now that he has her full support, Rocky begins a more intense training program which eventually helps him defeat Drago.



Rocky III and Rocky IV : TALKING POINT.
--------------------------------------


The fight between Clubber Lang and Rocky is more pacier and technically superior than the match between Drago and Rocky. 

If you think about it, in Rocky III, Rocky uses a STRATEGY that helped him defeat Clubber.

In Rocky IV there is NO STRATEGY. The ending fight is edited too much and really is a joke. Why should there be a need to cut huge chunks out of the fight? 
And clearly Rocky needed a STRATEGY to defeat the taller and much stronger and aggressive Drago. 

I also felt that John G. Avildsen (Rocky & Rocky V) is a better first choice director than Stallone. Clearly with Avildsen at the helm this film would have been even more better.


A list of good boxing movies:
-----------------------------
Cinderella Man (2005) based on the true story of boxer James Braddock,
Gladiator (1992), and Brutal Glory (1989) based on the true story of Charles "Kid" McCoy. 


I have seen all of the above. Brutal Glory is one of my favorites because Charles
McCoy seems to me to have all the traits of the legendary Rocky Marciano.
Before he fights, he poses himself before his opponent in an awesome stance. Also the more he is hit the deadlier he is to his opponent. He also used to go go for the K.O. and loved to K.O. his opponents after toying with them in the ring.

You have to see this film to find out more. (P.S this film is VERY HARD TO GET A HOLD OF). Could any one who has it upload it for all? If any of you have have it on VHS consider converting it to DVD and uploading it.
