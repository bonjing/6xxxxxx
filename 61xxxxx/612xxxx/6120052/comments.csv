Does anybody know how many episodes season 4 will include? I can't find this info anywhere."
,SamHefron,2011-01-22T17:02Z,"Sorry...just noticed the ""so far"" in your notes. :-) 

Still keen to know if 11 is it for this season...this info is usually in wikipedia or imdb, but I can't seem to find it."
,DonThomas93,2011-01-22T22:15Z,"@SamHefron,

Try this link: http://www.chuckonline.net/
Contains everything you want to know ;) "
,Magne_1984,2011-01-26T21:53Z,"samhefron: there are 16 episodes in the 4 season, checkout this link for more info http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/episodes#season-4"
,godoflemmings,2011-01-28T19:50Z,you're both wrong. there will be 24 episodes in the 4th season. says it pretty clearly on wikipedia
,DonThomas93,2011-01-30T15:24Z,"I know, that is what they say on chuckonline.net, but you are right, wikipedia also gives this info. And lucky for us that there will be 24 ep instead of 16!"

,Scottboard,2011-02-08T18:44Z,Thank you :)
,Bob__Dole,2011-03-01T03:24Z,"Thanks.

I know this will seem CRAZY, but it's best not to write ""complete"" or ""Season 1-4"" when it doesn't really have the rest of season 4 included.  Better to call it Season 1-3 complete ++"
,Scottboard,2011-03-04T00:42Z,"Yeah i know, but it was the complete season at the moment i made it, the show had a break over christmas so it wouldn't be a new episode until the 17'th of january, i made it in november i think."
,WolfeMasters,2011-03-18T06:30Z,"So far, episode one was corrupted, VLC repaired the file, but it took forever and even then, the episode skipped a lot and the repair did not stick/save.  Don't want to watch episode two until I can see all of episode one, so I have no idea if any of the other files work.  Not going to seed this since it does not appear to be working properly."
,UNDONE77,2011-03-18T15:06Z,there are 24 episodes in season 4
,Scottboard,2011-03-29T23:58Z,"Episode one is working perfectly for me, and I've not anyone else with this problem, maybe it's just you? Well anyway, the others are flawless. It's a shame that you wont seed.."
