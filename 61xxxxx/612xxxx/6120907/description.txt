This is a set of rehersals featuring Robin Trower and James Dewar. Apparently they were working with the new drummer and trying out new material. The sound quality is only fair to good, but completists will savor these off the cuff jams and workouts.

Robin is probably using the same Marshalls he would later use in Stockholm for the recording of the live album there. In my opinion, this is the best sound he ever obtained.

I'm not sure where I got these, and I have no other information about them. Enjoy.
