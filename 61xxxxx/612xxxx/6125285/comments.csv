Between these two burns, I burned NBA JAM alonge with several other titles for 360 and it works perfectly (yes, layer break is set correctly.) I have a hatatchi dvd drive in my 360 with the ixtreme 1.51. It doesn't have to be updated because it's the one firmware that plays any game no matter how it's patched (I don't hook my modded system up to LIVE.)

Any Ideas?"
