,r2007uk,2011-01-25T01:24Z,meh im already 50% thru downloading a different 12gb rip otherwise i would be all over this :
,illiria,2011-01-25T10:08Z,"@ r2007uk

:) Glad to hear, thanks.

I wonder why people download and run away. No one seeds. I've already uploaded 60 gigs, and still only four seeders. But it's fine. I'm not going anywhere."
,harshwind,2011-01-26T01:06Z,someone seed plz am at 99.5% lol
,illiria,2011-01-26T02:07Z,Seeding. I'm slowing down my upload speed while I'm playing the game. And I do that a lot. :P
,harshwind,2011-01-26T02:43Z,ty for seed god done with download ran installer on iso installed game but does not run errors say that physxcudart_20.dll is missing from my computer is there another program i need to run this will check on the cd i recall seeing a few programs to install on the autorun
,harshwind,2011-01-26T02:56Z,fixed my own problem works
,illiria,2011-01-26T03:03Z,"Yes, if it says ""physxcudart_20.dll"", it is NVIDIA PhysX-related. Normally PhysX should be installed with your drivers, so the problem shouldnt appear.

Unless you have ATI card. But then game shouldn't ask for PhysX, I assume? I'm not too good with understanding PhysX requirements. But yes, PhysX driver is on DISC 1, in case you're being asked for it."
,wogwon,2011-01-28T19:10Z,good game
,9178906,2011-01-29T20:08Z,download speed is awful. It'd be appreciated if more people seeded/original poster raised upload speed
,AndyParka,2011-02-03T15:30Z,"Thanks so much for this, I was hoping to find exactly this. an up to date, all dlc pre-cracked copy. "
,crysrn,2011-02-04T11:48Z,"S:L = 16:39 ? :(
5 days for this torrent..."
,quazx12,2011-02-04T20:00Z,"If anyone, anyone at all, has it, I would love you forever if you upped the Borderlands GOTY Mac version. I really don't want to have to port the Windows version, neither does anyone else, so the Mac native one would be really really nice. You'd get bonus points if it was the entirely self contained, no crack or install needed, App Store version. Well, you just need to copy an ownership receipt from any free app and overwrite the one in the Borderlands app for it to work, but hey, that's userland stuff."
,verdult6,2011-02-05T17:00Z,"i have a different message. it sais:

General protection fault!

history: GetOutermost() Address = 0xaad63a (filename not found) [in D:\spellen\Borderlands\Binaries\Borderlands.exe]

annyone knows what to do with this?"
,illiria,2011-02-09T10:05Z,"@ verdult

Well, problem isn't in the game. This issue *used* to be related to graphics drivers. Have you got newest graphics drivers?

Either way, it is likely to be an issue with the drivers, however with which, I can't tell.

Sorry for not being of much help. :/"
,verdult6,2011-02-09T17:52Z,"i installed al the installable things, the directX, the C++ and borderlands, ill try to update the drivers for my graphic card then. 
thanks annyway"
,asdfen,2011-02-21T20:41Z,"does not work for me
I get black screen with what sounds like the game is running

Downloading  GOTY."
,kaz050,2011-02-22T02:43Z,ok im like wtf is going on i downloaded the game installed the frist dvd then when it ask for the 2nd i put that in and then when its done it says fail too sum crap
,RoLLi7Z,2011-02-22T07:00Z,"I'm sorry if this sounds like a stupid question but....
should I unrar the files (discs 1 & 2) or should I mount em? Or is it preference? lol thanks in advance.

P.S. Download speeds are great for me, peaking at about 1.5 mb/s. I'll also seed this for a LONG time."
,nannulars,2011-02-23T23:25Z,"doesn't work for me.. says there is a problem with the binary config for the exe.

anyone have any ideas?"
,illiria,2011-02-25T06:58Z,"@ RoLLi7Z

You should mount the files, orf course. These are disc images.

@ asdfen

Borderlands GOTY won't save you: it DOESN'T include DLC, only the codes to download them. :)

@ kaz050

@ nannulars

No, unfortunately I don't have ideas what might be causing your problems, but it's unlikely to be repack: ive tested on multiple machines, multiple people have downloaded - no problems.

I'm sorry I can't be of any more help. :/

------------

I'm playing the repack on two different computers, even after full reformat, so... it can hardly be blamed.
Just telling about my testing experience. Problem doesn't seem to be on this end."
,fapetifap,2011-02-28T18:40Z,"harshwind, howd you get your problem fixed? im getting the same bullshit"
,illiria,2011-03-03T09:44Z,"@ fapetifap

Simply install PhysX. I already replied on this."
,sadockani,2011-03-04T21:38Z,ill have to give credit to this release. its simple to install and it works right away if you have installed directx and physx. very nice.
,cjoffroader,2011-03-05T07:05Z,anyone else get the error that the program cant start because the application configuration is incorrect? 
,Ozaira22,2011-03-05T09:17Z,"Can more ppl help seed? 
I've been at this download for ages now.."
,jfrench,2011-03-05T11:17Z,dl speed is so good. 1.6 mb. right now. thanks!
,Ozaira22,2011-03-05T13:57Z,"Excuse me for being such a noob. But basically we download the files, burn it onto a disc and install it just like any other disc? 
(First time downloading a game)"
,Ozaira22,2011-03-05T14:21Z,"I downloaded and burned the file onto a disc but when i tried to extract the files in the winrar files, it says  

E:\data6.cab
The archive is either in unknown format or damageed
Can you help? "
,Millerdis100,2011-03-08T17:28Z,It seems to be a perfect torrent. I ask just to be sure.. Has the game patched with the older updates aswell? Like 1.0.1 to 1.4.1 or is it just patched with the latest 1.4.1?
,illiria,2011-03-12T05:41Z,"Sorry for not replying sooner. Yes, all the previous updates are also included."
,illiria,2011-03-12T05:45Z,"@ Millerdis100

Yes, it also includes previous updates.

@ Ozaira22

You don't need to extract anything. These files are CAB files, they are installation files, NOT meant for extraction. Just run Setup.exe.
If the archive is still corrupted, then you need to re-download it."
,baptiser,2011-03-12T23:56Z,"i'm gonna write out my experiences here in case anyone else has this problem, it took trial and error to get this to work.

first, i was using daemon tools lite.

i had to make two virtual drives and mount both images.

the autorun install didn't work, i had to open the folder for the files in disc 1, and run the autorun as administrator, otherwise if i clicked 'install borderlands' the whole operation would crash.

it installed just fine until i got to the insert disc 2 part. it would ask me where disk 2 was, i'd tell it, and it would say it couldn't find the data. i eventually figured out that i just had to select disc 1 again for whatever reason and click continue.

hope this helps."
,educuba,2011-03-14T06:04Z,Multi works on this one?
,Astrumvicis,2011-03-15T06:01Z,"I am haveing trouble with this. I am using magicISO. After i have mounted the Bl disk1.iso and run it, it fails. Any Idea's?"
,SphekS,2011-03-18T16:17Z,"@Astrumvicis
use this one http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html

,Darkscreamz,2011-03-22T17:24Z,"i have windows 7 32- bit and i have started setup and it's working, im just wondering shall i put the two discs in separated virtual discunits (im using DAEMONtools)"
,Darkscreamz,2011-03-22T17:34Z,umm btw it's asking for disk#5 and i got 2 discs so shall i use the second one?
,White_Flare,2011-03-22T21:15Z,Disk #5 = Data package #5. its a file its looking for he screwed up a little labling it. I just successfully installed this last night and played through to killing 9 toes so it works. only issue was i had to duel mount both CD's because when i took the first one out it said i needed to re-insert it so i got nowhere. Mount both CDs at the same time or have 2 CD drives. Goodluck all.
,White_Flare,2011-03-22T21:17Z,P.S. I did this all with DAEMON TOOLS LITE. made 2 virtual drives and ran the auto run. Be sure to check to make sure you have 12 gigs free when u start the install or it will crash without an error.
,.XterN,2011-04-01T14:58Z,"Running the .iso files, I get a warning from my Anti-Virus program, saying that it has just tracked down a virus, and prevents the file from running.
  Do you have any idea of what it might recognize as a virus? Trusting you, I feel pretty certain it just a false positive, but I have to be sure. Is there any files in specificly in this torrent you would think is easily reconized as a virus?

Would be glad to hear from you soon,

,ChikinMan,2011-04-16T08:42Z,"Friggin badass game, works 100% percent for me, thanks a whole lot. The game has an environment very similar to Fallout, good humor now and then, plenty of enemies to deal with, and a HUGE assortment of weapons and armor to pick from. The gameplay is also alot like Diablo in my opinion, only with guns and shooting and stuff. Awesome upload, thanks again :)"
