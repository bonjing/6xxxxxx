First of, I appologize for screaming out "best". It's generally not in my policy to brag or beg for attention, but as far as it goes, it seems to be the best repack out there, and I do want you to have the best.

Competition is always welcome. 



Patched to the latest version (1.41), includes all the DLCs, custom Autorun and Installer. Precracked.


Screenshots:









Languages supported (as stated in Readme): English, German, Italian, French, Spanish.


Contains two ISOs: DVD9 and DVD5. Ready to be burned onto discs.

Also, I urge other repackers to stick to the official game themes in their repacks, and retain the original game paths. It is much more pleasing for the eye.
