wat i meant was.. Notting Hill was ur fav, and it was ok to be in 1Gb.. why everything else(rom. comedy) is around 1Gb? was my concern
..jus a concern"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-25T09:57Z,"@muthineni: Such rating mean just one thing: he attracts crazies and crazies love minus signs more than anything else (they are ""minus"" inside and try to balance out the world outside). 

Point being - Rip is good. Uploader is VIP."
,bcgarant,2011-01-25T10:50Z,"Hey 20-40 I don't know if u take requests but if u do is it possible to upload any of these in less than 500 MB size, Plz Reply if there are any that u will ty

Then will get his rip later. thanks for helping.the negative bastards really got to me.
i hope you find the time to watch the movie as well. my friends told me its a cool movie."
,DevSIN,2011-01-25T12:26Z,"@tylr : 20-40 's fav is notting hill & he upped 1 gig torrent... & rest of the movies r also 1 gig.. 
bcuz he tries to do justice with quality/size ratio... shrinking every movie to 500-700 megs is NOT cool.. 
for gawdsake 1 gig is a very decent file size for a 720p  ... & i for 1 appreciate him preferring quality over size ... XD

@ 20-40  : i got 2 requests bro...
Blue velvet - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090756/
(480p preferred)
The Thing 1982 -http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/
(720p preferred)
please try to do em :)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-25T13:46Z,"@bcgarant: I can do

Ladyhawke
The Sure Thing
Out Of Time
Homecoming 2009
Antwone.Fisher
Summer Rental

as small-sized H264. Halloween has been done last week as 720p and re-rip is out of the question. Rest I have not on disposal.

Problem is, however, lack of free upload slots - I cannot promise a thing, but I'll up them in Movie.Pack as soon as possible, probably next week, maybe."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-25T18:11Z,"@DevSIN: Appreciate that. However, whole damn October I have been shouting that I would left extremely small sized formats, as general encoding philosophy. For encoders out there I've done enough, for five years keeping the torch - and now - probably few dozens quite regular put their encodes out.
Anyone who has computer - can do Google and find almost any title in preferred size.

I can't be anyone's bitch anymore. Shit that is recently present here - insanely high number of Hit&Runs is by-product of such  changed direction (fresh shit attracts flies too, as the light do to moths) - and fucked as is - it's better then listening calls in Comments as motherfucker, shithead and Co. for five years in row, day by day, few thousand times every year.

Those who bitch about sizes - can, must and could look around and they would see how wrong they are - as Others were before."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-25T18:16Z,"ERR
regular = regularly

Sorry."
,bcgarant,2011-01-26T15:09Z,"thx for reply 20-40 will be checking your uploads everyday lol
