ABOUT Brian Doerksen:

Brian Doerksen is a songwriter, recording artist, author, conference speaker and pastor. Born and raised on the west coast of Canada in Abbotsford B.C., he now lives with his family (wife of 25 years Joyce and their 4 youngest children) in the same home that he spent his childhood in.
His songs known around the world in churches of all kinds include â€˜Come, now is the time to worshipâ€™, â€˜Hope of the nationsâ€™, â€˜Faithful Oneâ€™, â€˜Refinerâ€™s Fireâ€™, â€˜Hallelujah (Your love is amazing)â€™, â€˜Holy Godâ€™ & â€˜The riverâ€™.
In April 2008, Brian received a JUNO award (Canadian equivalent of the Grammy awards) for â€˜Holy Godâ€™ (Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the year). His first book; MAKE LOVE, MAKE WAR published by David C Cook came out in the summer of 2009.
He continues to record albums and release them in partnership with Integrity Media â€“ the latest being â€˜LEVEL GROUNDâ€™ (Sep 2010 International release / Jan 2011 US release). This is Brianâ€™s 2nd DVD and features the musicians off stage among the participants, while on the stage people share their grace story.
He has also completed a double album recording of a musical (an 8 year writing process!) with Christopher Greco (a playwright based in Boston) based on Luke 15 called â€˜Prodigal God; The musical tale of two sons and one wastefully extravagant fatherâ€™. Itâ€™s the story of the prodigal son and his father seen through the eyes of the elder brother. The musical features 23 new songs written or co-written by Brian. http://www.prodigal-god.com
