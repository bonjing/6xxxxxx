,gekiganger,2011-01-25T10:33Z,Is this show getting better or worse?
,shredhed,2011-01-26T17:12Z,"This is a really poor show.

Crap hero with no super powers.  Crap outfit, crap special effects, crap script, boring-as-hell plot with pointless filler characters.  I yearn for a decent hero series but this a lame duck.

Shame, as I like some of the cast.

It's getting worse."
