I didn't code it myself, just created the torrent and posted, read description for that.

I know upload speed is crap and that's why I didn't upload anything before, but last week both TVteam and scenebalence were pretty slow to post this and I couldn't find it anywhere else, so I thought I'd get it out there.

Please seed afterwards!"
,theWhiteLady,2011-01-25T17:14Z,I am seeding and the torrent is on my azureus but the tracker doesn't seem to count it... :(

thanks again!"
