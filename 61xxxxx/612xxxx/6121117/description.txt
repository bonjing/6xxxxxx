FTV Girls - Tricia & Michelle - Get To Know Us
			
Michelle:  So sorry guys, I was late there's no excuse for it but there was some major traffic getting up here to the airport.  I live in the Phoenix area, but like an hour away from the airport.  I was pretty tired just from the driving.  So to wake us all up the videographer made us run back and forth a few times at the parking lot.
Tricia:  I'm half-awake from getting up sooo early in the morning.  I flew in from LA, but you have to get up very early to make sure you're at the airport on time for all the check-in and security things.  I wasn't going to miss this day!  But Michelle was late in meeting us here, no excuse for that since she lives here in Phoenix!  So had a breakfast/lunch thing at the airport and I got to flash my breasts just once before meeting up with Michelle.  She's a cute gal from what I could tell at the time, I'd do her hehe.
