,HiroPro2,2011-03-05T01:49Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!"

,neuroxik,2011-04-06T01:44Z,"Thanks!
Question: 7 people clicked Quality as negative, are they rating the quality of the rip or the content?
I'm listening to your rip at the moment on a high-end 5.1 system and the quality is excellent, no audible artefacts in the cymbals (we can often hear it in the hisses and in the bass drum when the quality is lower than 320 kbs)... so I don't see what people are complaining about"
[T],nlx_78,2011-04-06T17:23Z,"@ vortex. Dank je wel man, mooie cd dit. Ik upload zelf films en krijg soms ook mensen die echt van alles een punt maken terwijl ze zelf niets delen. Screw them :)

PS dBpoweramp is FANTASTIC ripping software!
PSS NEVER USE DESTRUCTIVE REPLAY GAIN or a limiter! I use them but they are nondestructive and are stored in the id3 tag fields and calculate track as well as album nondestructive replaygain."
,pm3003,2011-10-24T09:01Z,21 still in the Top 10 on TPB....incredible i've never seen such a success....(i've already bought that album twice...)
