,eiwru,2011-03-03T03:57Z,"Thanxx for the Upload.
Quality is great."
,eiwru,2011-03-03T04:05Z,"But why the incredible long filenames for symphs 9/10?
It causes problems and has no use.
I just downloaded symph 10 and the name of disc 8 is so long I could not move, copy nor rename it with Windows XP and not even with KillCopy.
Luckily uTorrent could move and rename it for me..."
