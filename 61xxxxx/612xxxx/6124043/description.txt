[AIR DATE] 2011/01/23
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/01/24

Genre: Documentary

Description:

Part3 - Despite causing widespread criticism overseas, in the 1950s
under the Menzies government, Australias whites only immigration
policy seemed as popular as ever. Indeed the rise of Communism in
the region added extra justification to the need to prevent Asians
entering the country.


Its the origin of 'Stop The Boats' LOL 
A very interesting history that I didn't know about, seems almost
unbelievable from our current perspective.
