From Wiki:



Genesis are an English rock band that formed in 1967. The band currently comprises the longest-tenured members Phil Collins (lead vocals and drums), Mike Rutherford (guitar and bass guitar), and Tony Banks (keyboards). Peter Gabriel, Anthony Phillips and Steve Hackett also played major roles in the band in its early years. Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.[1]

Genesis began as a 1960s pop band. During the 1970s, they evolved into a progressive rock band, incorporating complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation, while their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, elaborate costumes and on-stage stories. This second phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23 minute "Supper's Ready" and the 1974 concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. In the 1980s, the band produced accessible pop music based on melodic hooks; this change of direction gave them their first number one album in the United Kingdom, Duke, and their only number one single in the United States, "Invisible Touch".

Genesis has changed personnel several times. Stage fright forced founding member Anthony Phillips to leave the band in 1970. In 1975, Collins, then the band's drummer, replaced Peter Gabriel as lead singer after a lengthy search for a replacement. To facilitate Collins's move to lead vocals during concerts, Bill Bruford, and later Chester Thompson, played drums for the band as they toured, with Collins joining in briefly during lengthy instrumental passages. In 1977, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band. After Phil Collins left the band in 1996, Genesis recruited Ray Wilson (formerly of Stiltskin). Wilson appeared on the 1997 album Calling All Stations, after which the band announced an indefinite hiatus. However, in 2007, Banks, Collins and Rutherford reunited for a 20-city tour of Europe and North America, which included a free concert at Rome's Circo Massimo in front of 500,000 fans. Genesis was among five bands inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. 









Three Sides Live 1982


Three Sides Live is the third live album by British Progressive Rock band Genesis, released in 1982.

The title for this album comes from the original world release which contained three sides of live material from the band's 1976 tour, which lasted until 1982. in support of their album Abacab, and a fourth side of studio tracks, three of which formed the British 3 X 3 EP and two B-sides from the sessions for their album Duke. Only the UK release featured a fourth live side of obscure performances recorded during previous tours. "Paperlate", itself from the 3 X 3 EP, became a Top 10 UK hit and a smaller US success.

Upon its mid-1982 release, Three Sides Live reached #2 in the UK and #10 in the US.

Like Seconds Out, the live album which preceded it, Three Sides Live documents the end of another major period in the evolution of the band. Focusing mostly on material from Duke and Abacab, including large sections from Duke's thematic song cycles, the third side contains what had become the centrepiece of their last few tours, the "Cage" medley. Replacing their previous centrepiece, "Supper's Ready", the "Cage" medley melded together the longer song "In the Cage" (from the The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway album), with an instrumental which combined motifs from "Cinema Show" and a changing set of melodies from Wind & Wuthering and The Lamb. From here the song then slowly melds into "Afterglow", producing a medley which lasted over 15 minutes and served to satisfy many of the fans' wishes for older material in the live shows. As a compilation of many of Banks's most popular keyboard solos from the live shows, this medley, a staple of their shows for many years, encapsulates Genesis's strengths as a 'musicians' band. This album also includes many notable B-sides on the fourth side, and despite being a live album, Three Sides Live is considered essential Genesis by many fans.

While the 'fourth' studio side was unavailable on the UK release (and is no longer issued as part of the album), it contained five notable songs which didn't fit onto the "Duke" and "Abacab" albums. "Paperlate," which opens the fourth side, was an instant radio hit. "You Might Recall" is a song describing unrequited love. According to Tony Banks on the 2007 CD and DVD reissue of the Abacab album, "You Might Recall" was to appear on Abacab, but Atlantic Records founder Ahmet ErtegÃ¼n suggested that the band leave the track off in favour of the more bizarre "Who Dunnit?". The quirky "Me and Virgil" has a relaxed, almost country feel which allowed the group to explore rural family themes in a manner similar to Collins's solo track "The Roof is Leaking." "Evidence of Autumn" recreates the moods of the Wind & Wuthering days, and "Open Door" is a quiet ballad which hearkens back to the days of Collins's sparse vocal recordings like "More Fool Me."

In 1994, Three Sides Live was remastered and reissued with the UK edition worldwide. Four of the five additional studio selections from that out of print release would be issued in 2000 on the Genesis Archive 2: 1976-1992 box set (all but "Me And Virgil"), and all five songs have since been included on the bonus disc of the Genesis 1976-1982 box set.
