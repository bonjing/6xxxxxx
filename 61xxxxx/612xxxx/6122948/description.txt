Highly recommended. Superb musical guests join Beppe in cooking up some great bluegrass guitar duets. From the opening tune, Slow Creek, Beppe's signature tune of Salt Creek, to the last, this labor of love is excellent. Thank you Beppe for lugging your recording equipment all over North America. It was well worth it to these ears. Buy the CD! You won't be disappointed if you enjoy flatpicking guitar at its finest.
