@southpaw
EVEN I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION !

this riddlerA is a god !
dont know what converter does he uses to make a file so compressed and HD ??"
,Razr92,2011-02-25T23:44Z,"For the ones who asked which converter , You dont use a converter for the Lossless rips , you need to do it in a Professional video editing software , Plus you should have a video card (not Graphics card) like Canopus or Ati FirePro GL , depending on your budget . That will give you realtime video conversion , input and output. You can guess the rest. I use Avid Liquid 7 Pro , You can buy the soft and the Avid video card that comes in a combo package for some 4K $ , (in my country) ."
,Razr92,2011-02-25T23:47Z,"Sorry for my last comment , been 3 years since I bought my Avid Liquid , the price has greatly dropped to 999$ for the pro pack and the 499 for the standard pack ... Get the details here .. http://library.creativecow.net/articles/harvey_mark/avid_liquid_7_review.php"
,Razr92,2011-02-25T23:49Z,"There are a lot of Pro Realtime Video Card with Softwares out there, it depends on you according to your work, I wouldnt recommend buying such stuff for Just Ripping movies unless you got enough money for entertainment purposes."
,Razr92,2011-02-25T23:51Z,"There are other places where you can get BR Rips at the size of 150mb+ , similar quality , But I dont intend to post the links or names here or spoil RiddlerA's work, you can google yourself if you want"
