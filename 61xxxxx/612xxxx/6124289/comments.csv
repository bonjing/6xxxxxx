I leave a reply to a spammer, but the spammer's comment disappears.  

I reload the page and there is the spammer again, but then my comment isn't there.

So I reply again, and then I don't see the spammer again, etc."
,evilwinchestor,2011-01-26T07:52Z,great d/l but this movie is a serious disappointment . plot of the movie is like the origins of the 1st movie and the paranormal activity hype was the only good thing about these movies because the actual movie itself was a waste of time .

,Tweak076,2011-02-03T22:27Z,Is the theatrical version of part 1 online? Ending: Katie is possessed by demon and dashes at camera after killing her husband. The only version that fits with part 2. In other versions of part 1 Katie is getting killed by police or she slices her own throat. But she comes back at the end of part 2 to take the baby.

,xZxHackNsLASHxZx,2011-02-14T12:23Z,if its got an ip grabber then you just DL it using a wifi connection then they cant do anything about it... because when your ip moves your ip changes... thus rendering all ip's grabed useless... now if it grabs your mac address then your in trouble...

,chaosheritage,2011-05-16T16:01Z,Thanks for the input people.
,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-05-24T01:16Z,if they wouldn't charge 10 to 20 bucks to see the movie/movies in the theaters (with snacks 30 to 40 bucks) or charge 20 dollars or more for a DVD that costs pennies practically to make....then we all wouldn't do this....i say it's worth it. ;-)
,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-05-25T18:40Z,"well, i watched 1 and 2, and i know it's considered bad form to voice opinions for any reason...but these two movies sucked the big wanker...lol....really.
