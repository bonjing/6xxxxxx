Virtutech Simics
version 3.0.31 build 1406
Linux (x86 and amd64), Solaris SPARC and Win32 versions

Virtutech Simics is a full system simulation platform that provides a controlled, deterministic, and fully virtualized environment. It simulates both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems, provides a common infrastructure for a broad variety of tasks, including: microprocessor design; memory hierarchy design; component development and testing; automated software quality testing; SoC virtual prototypes; hardware-software co-simulation; and the development of firmware, drivers, and operating systems.

Keygen included (from v3.0.29, but still works).
License key should be generated for every user account wanting to use this program.
Note: keygen is a Win32 EXE program, but the key iself is platform independent text file. So, you can generate the key on Windows machine and transfer it to the destination.

This software is issued in 2008, therefore, some problems can be expected with more fresh operating systems.
