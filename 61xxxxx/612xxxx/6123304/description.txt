Tonightâ€™s Show: The Curse of Good Intentions (FBN @ 9p/midnight ET)

Last month, I did a Fox News Special titled: "Politicians' Promises Gone Wrong."   The show made some viewers unhappy. This week, Iâ€™ll give my critics a chance to talk back.

In the special, I criticized how politicians favor certain businesses with gifts like tax breaks. Alpaca farmers get tax breaks and I argued that itâ€™s led to a â€œbubbleâ€ in alpaca farming.   Some alpaca farmers called me an idiot and a â€œcloseted bigotâ€. The Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association said they â€œexpect to be given equal time to counteract such irresponsible reporting.â€ So, I invited the Alpaca Association to come on the show to tell me what I got wrong.  They cancelled at the last minute. Alpaca owner Theresa Reyes-Stassel showed up... armed with her own alpaca.

Weâ€™ll also give the critics a chance to defend 3 other programs that were included among my ten â€œpromises gone wrongâ€, starting with Obamacare.

Then thereâ€™s Cash-for-Clunkers, which was supposed to stimulate the auto industry by spending $2 Billion to destroy perfectly good used cars. Progressives, like Tamara Draut from Demos, still think this was a good idea. She will argue with me and Edmunds.com CEO Jeremy Anwyl.

Finally, in response to my argument that the minimum wage kills jobs, some viewers wrote that I advocated â€œslave wages.â€ Christian Dorsey from the Economic Policy Institute will appear on the show to argue the merits of minimum wage.  Small business owner Warren Myer will appear to call it a job killer.

Thatâ€™s tonight on FBN at 9pm and Midnight ET.
