,kcbay,2011-01-24T05:31Z,"thanks a million to your works, skJGZV6z, I just used a few days to grab all the shows from 2010 and replace the youtube version
I suppose there will be a new ones from the 27th and 2/3? so we don't have them until you get back?"
[T],skJGZV6z,2011-01-25T12:52Z,"Assuming there are new STOSSEL's, and assuming my DVR doesn't lock-up (but it very probably could, ReplayTVs very temperamental), I will eventually catch-up the torrents. Fingers crossed.
(Freedom Watch, however, will be skipped entirely during this period, and not made-up later.)"
[T],skJGZV6z,2011-01-25T13:22Z,This show responds to viewer criticism of this show: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6050538
,dackral,2011-01-26T18:38Z,Any chance on getting Stossel's coverage of the State of the Union Address last night?
[T],skJGZV6z,2011-01-27T10:08Z,"So sorry, I missed his airtime after the SOTU."
,hawkx87,2011-01-29T08:39Z,"Oh man!  I was looking for the SOTU thing, too.  haha.


Thanks for everything you do, though, skJGZV6v!"
