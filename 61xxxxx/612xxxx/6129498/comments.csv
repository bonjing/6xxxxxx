,ThrowingTracks,2011-01-27T00:40Z,"Thx for this :)

To stop the game going on line just block the dungeonstarter.exe file with the program control of your firewall, then start the game. No need to have firewall/internet connection turned off once its blocked."

,OmniNegro,2011-01-27T01:51Z,"If you are new to this sort of thing, I will make it simple.

Download Comodo Firewall. It is freeware. Learn to use it to block the executable of ANY and ALL games you play.

Google will tell you how if you ask it.

NO games that are single player or pirated should EVER have access to the internet. Period.

They use the internet to report your ip address and then send a DMCA notice to your ISP.

This is the normal way things work. Get used to it. It will not change.

Good luck and have a nice day."

,OmniNegro,2011-01-27T22:00Z,"I will try to avoid being an asshole. But if you think cracked games should not be blocked in your firewall you are a moron beyond my understanding.

If you want every last virus and/or malware in existence to use your Internet connection to give away all your personal data then by all means do not block it.

If you think I am being unreasonable, think again. This has been the case since Windows 95. It is not going to change. The game is working fine so long as you follow the simple directions provided here.

Block the damned thing. If you want to play an online game, you MUST purchase the game. This has always been the way things work. It will not change just because you are too stupid to use a firewall.

,Neoqpa,2011-01-29T22:58Z,"Well the solution would be wait for the game to actually be released. I'm sure the version that will appear on Steam 10th of Feb will be a lot more playable, and i've read about some nice improvements to the gameplay itself. I think we should treat this version as late beta. "
,dex159,2011-01-29T23:24Z,"@Neoqpa
I guess so as well. Manual said over 300 items for your dungeon and in the game there couldn't be more than 40. The game itself is also really poorly optimized for such average looking title. Dude I really hope you're right."
,OmniNegro,2011-01-30T00:51Z,"To those saying this is Dungeon Keeper in a more modern engine, you are absolutely right. But at least you do not have to run DOSbox to get it up, and the graphics are decent for the genre.

To those having trouble installing it, I have no idea, it installed and runs perfectly for me on Windows 7 x64. I am using a Radeon 5850 for video. What are you using?

To the one and only person saying this is like an inverted Dungeon Master game, Lol. No way. Dungeon Master and DM2 were hundreds of times better games.

To those saying this performs like a late beta, you are quite correct. But that is typical these days. Fuck the developers if they can not manage to release actual working games for sale. I would never buy this garbage until they manage to get it stable at least."
,OmniNegro,2011-01-30T00:56Z,"Also, about the number of items for your dungeon, every last game made in the last decade follows the same theme with regards to availability of stuff. It will have more items available in later levels. Right now you can only get to level three. 

Be patient. Someone will release a patch and the release groups will have it here before it is even available to the suckers who bought it in advance. Just like always."

lol, if the game goes black the second you want to play it, it isnt working well at all.

Anyway, truth be told, this game is, even if I didnt see more than few campaign missions, a huge fail. They took the worst things out of DK 1-2 and barely even touched the good ones.

I soo fucking wish for W7 compatible DK 2 :("
,Ska8ter,2011-01-30T13:10Z,"@OmniNegro
You're so fking right about the devs and the people who publish games these days.
Take a look at Disciples 3, when it came out it was so full of bugs it wasn't even playable. And after all this time they released one patch that fixed about 20% of the bugs. wtf!

I have friends that actually bought the game and they can't play because of an invalid disk error. So basically they got shit for their money.
Fuck these these people if they think I'll spend one cent on these fked up games.

,Neoqpa,2011-01-30T19:18Z,"@eraew51 Have you even played the game? Dungeons is nothing like dungeon keeper. The fact that one question mentioned it means nothing. Go check Dungeon Maker, or play it if you can, you will see that the game has more in common with it than Keeper. What's to keep in Dungeons? Nothing. Monsters don't eat, they don't need any living space, you don't research anything.  Unlike Dungeon Keeper (and very much like dungeon master) you have your avatar and you run through the dungeons yourself. You make goblins dig, but you don't build rooms for yourself or your monsters. The fact that there was a question about Keeper in the form doesn't mean the game is anything alike. "

It also shows how stupid game websites can be, quoting each-other with bullshit data.  Similar situation was with Hospital Tycoon (only that game was really shitty, and Dungeons still seems nice). So the game might get low rates on websites and papers because people there will make the same mistake that everyone else is making. "

,jamesensor,2011-02-02T06:39Z,"Thanks for the upload, i could then formulate some impressions of the game.

It tries to ""stay away"" from dungeon keeper 2 (so did the developers said...) but there are so many resemblances and jokes about it that stink. If this isn't DK2.. why the stupid ingame comparisons? It has a dungeon heart, a keeper, minion helpers, creatures, escavating options, making ""rooms"", omg.. This works mostly as a tower defense game, and it eats a lot of ram (about 1gb process), and since there's a unit limit, when a group of heroes get together it's very hard to stop them with some batties or rats, and you have to scatter some around to expand your influence, so that you get some ""lairs"" to boost up your unit limit, but mostly you have to do the job yourself and even so, getting power has its own lame way. The more you decorate your ""dungeon"" (empty spaces duh..) with crap, repeated crap, your atributes go up, and thats it. You tend not to decorate, but to fill empty spaces with Halloween wallmart crap. Graphics are great, indeed, thats how DK3 should be, but if they are going to take some idea, twist it with another idiot concept like tower defense (i can play these in java on websites, then no thanks. The game ""Evil Genius"" took the good concept of DK2, and made a diferent theme with its own charisma. That's a good and perfectly applied strategy, for example."

My complements to extremezone for uploading this and to Fairlight for cracking it so quickly. Anyone having problems with the internet issue needs to unplug until you boot the game. I tried to block with firewall this didn't work. It seems to still detect the connection. The serial number worked when typed. After install I moved the whole directory to another location so path folders don't seem to be any issue. You don't need the ISO after install which is always a big plus in my opinion. Thumbs up and hats off to these people!

Now about the game... it is a turd. Sorry but to be honest I own Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 and this is just a carbon copy of the same old shit. I am sure the hell glad I didn't pay the $35 retail just to find this out. It was worth the time to DL and try it, but the game play runs almost identical to the games by Bullfrog. I will most likely find the DVD of this for $3 at the used software shop in the near future. Oh and I notice the rating here says ""rating pending or RP"" the official site is +12 so don't go expecting a lot. It is just another garden variety simulation. "

,kyp0001,2011-02-25T03:46Z,"Dungeons PATCH Update + CRACK - from 1.0.0.1 to 1.2.0.0

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6200702

I will be initially seeding it until its well distributed. :]

Dungeons-FLT Version 1.0.0.1 should not have been released like that as it is unplayable without the patch 1.2. 
So finally after 3 weeks or so, after Release, it was actually playable.
...had to finish the game first before the idea came to me about seeding it as a torrent to others :p

(last time I've uploaded patch 1.1.1.0 a fine twat decided to duplicate it as a fake torrent with 1 seed and 99%  for 400 leechers, so watch out about that)"
