 Game information:

  =================

 Dungeons follows the mis-adventures of the foremost of all  Dungeon  Lords,

  who spends his time luring heroes into his labyrinthine creations with  the

  promise of treasure and a good fight -- only to be trapped by his ingenious

  devices. Once they are in his grasp, our Dungeon Lord must look  after  and

  cherish his new found prisoners until they are more comfortable with  their

  surroundings because come the "harvest", happy heroes  have  more  precious

  soul energy for you to  gleefully  extract  via  foul  prisons  or  twisted

  torture chambers!  

 In Dungeons, our protagonist falls victim to a devious plot hatched by  his

  vile, nasty and thoroughly vicious ex-girlfriend and finds himself  at  the

  bottom of the underworld hierarchy and the top of the dungeon pile which in

  this world is about as bad as it can get.

 Our Lord must have his revenge, and make his  way  back  down  the  dungeon

  levels to his rightful place - but first he must deal with his new  bosses,

  the three despicable Dungeon Lords who stand in his way.

  Revenge will be sweet indeed.
