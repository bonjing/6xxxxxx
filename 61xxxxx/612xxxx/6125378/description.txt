If ever there was an ideal place for a Hamptons house outside the Hamptons, the Gold Coast hinterland would be it â€“ wide open spaces, balmy sea-kissed air and a sense of prosperity. For Steve and Lisa Morley itâ€™s the American dream or nothing for their 4,000 square metre block.

They love everything about the Hamptons style, from the warm timbers, to the many windows, pavilion style design, parquetry flooring and classic, soft interior furnishings. Lisa has done her research, designing many elements herself and will stop at nothing to fulfill her dream.
