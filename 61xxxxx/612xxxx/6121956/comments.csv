Very bad quality.

I usually get the 720p version with titles that are this old, as you're lucky if the original print even comes close to 720p resolution.

In this case, however, I have to go with the 1080p version, even if 1080p is overkill for a 1978 low-budget slasher (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6455739/I.Spit.On.Your.Grave.1978.1080p.BluRay.True-HD.5.1.x264-HDLiTE).

This version simply looks like it's a DVD upscale, or VHS handicam. Extremely low effective resolution, jagged edges, poor colors. I cannot believe that this is from a bluray when comparing it to the 1080p version I linked to. At least not the *same* bluray. There's a WORLD of difference between those two releases.

Go with the 1080p! This one looks awful!"
,zackman123,2011-11-19T13:46Z,Kickass is right - this is ripped from the r1 dvd and upscaled - looks awful
