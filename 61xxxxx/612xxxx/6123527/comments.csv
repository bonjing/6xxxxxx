You would be far better off to create 6 separate torrents, one for each season of the show.
Then you can keep the torrent block size small in each torrent, which will make the replication of the data much easier."
,BornAfro,2011-01-25T14:12Z,You do realize that how i met your mother seasons run into the mid 20s episode 14 is not the last for this season.
,DerHakubi,2011-01-25T22:14Z,That's why is says up to the current episode. The next new one airs next week.
,DerHakubi,2011-01-27T22:01Z,"For those of you who want to know, this torrent goes up to episode 14 of season 6."

This is your opinion and not everyone shares it with you. 

Thanks 4 upload!"
,renison7,2011-08-21T15:56Z,guys don't just comment give him a +1 for his effort whoever he is. And about the 99.3% i guess some files are not seeded fully so you better mention those so others can skip them.
