ISO size : 744 MB
Serial     : not included

thepiratebay.org doesn't allow me to directly upload the real torrent file. So I'm uploading threw a torrent. OK

Please help by seeding ..."
,pafc,2011-01-24T21:47Z,why does all your uploads have a negative response???
,jinualex,2011-01-26T16:49Z,"hello pafc
That is really an interesting question? What do you understand from your experience? If it have a negative response but all of them have good seeding(positive response). Isn't it. It shows there are so many good people in this world. Not the uploader only but the our great Seeders are actually sharing and giving life to any torrent.
THANK YOU GREAT SEEDERS.

pafc, I checked the negative responders account and found they didn't uploaded even one torrent !!!
