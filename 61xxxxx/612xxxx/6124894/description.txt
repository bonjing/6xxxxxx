Includes 32-bit and 64-bit drivers for most above-mentioned cards + some virtual NDIS driver for video transmission over a network.

Tested with USB Hybrid Stick 330E .. normally distributed with a lower version of the software ...

As a support it can install Adobe Acrobat Reader 9.0, DivX Player, NET Framework 2, DirectX - usually not necessary, be sure you have a newer version of the system. + some PixieTool do not know what it is ... maybe it's part of the software.
