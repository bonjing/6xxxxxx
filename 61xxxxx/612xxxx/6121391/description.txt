The most telling criticism you could level at this album is that it's never what you'd call 'inspired', but that's okay, because Ritter is such an accomplished songwriter.  Everything, from lyrics to melodies to memorable cadences, obviously comes so naturally to him; he's the kind of songwriter that casually tosses off the kind of idea that others don't even think to try, or have to really work at including.
