This fix will only help if you have the official "wrong" steam checksum (OUMN). If you dont have the official checksum, you should vertify the game cache whit steam.


1. Take the eu3 and eu3game flies 

2. Put them in to the C/Program Files/ Steam/ steamapps/ common /europa universalis iii - complete 

3. Replace existing file

4. Run EU3

5. Start a game/ Load the map (not a save file)

6. Exit the game

7. When you log nex time you should have the official checksum (OJDM)
