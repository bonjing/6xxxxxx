The Latest is 1.5.1! Which includes:
- Ham ‘Em High – 30 new levels
- New Golden Eggs. I would presume there are three: #18, #19 and the Super Bowl / Rio Golden Egg.
- The ability to switch into “windowed” mode from the main screen (click the settings icon under the “Play” button)
- A new and improved pause menu.
- Bug fixes


PLEASE ANYONE! UPLOAD THE LATEST VERSION!"

,skadude,2011-03-22T19:42Z,"For any that get this error:

""The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0150002). Click on OK to terminate the application.""

I solved this by opening angrybirds.exe in the app 'Dependency walker'. This program said a couple of .dll's were missing.

I downloaded these and put them in the game directory. And low and behold, I spent the rest of the afternoon avoiding study by playing this terribly addictive game. Apparently it has something to do with winxp versions.

The dll's I needed were:

msjava.dll
msvcp90.dll
msvcr90.dll
msvcr100.dll
INETCOMM.DLL

Hope this helps. Now, I will make pork for dinner. B.T.W. Thanks for the upload."

,jscore,2011-04-30T00:33Z,"FOR THOSE HAVING PROBLEMS:
I was getting the error message, ""This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect"". First I installed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package ATL Security Update AND Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package. I'm not sure this had any effect because I still got the message.

IMPORTANT:
1) You downloaded 2 folders, go to the folder msvcr100 and copy the the file msvcr100.dll and paste it into the Angry Birds folder. Also paste that same file into C:/Windows/System 32.

2) Now click ""Start"" and then ""Run"" so you're at a command prompt. Enter the following command and click Ok, regsvr32.exe c:\windows\system32\msvcr100.dll

3) A message will come up saying the msvcr100.dll was registered. Click Ok. You're now ready to play the game, go back to the Angry Birds folder and open the game and is should start properly."

1-update your graphics driver to the latest version.
2-in the angry brids folder where the exe file is, there is a file called (config.lua) open it with notepad, **if there is no option to open with notepad depending on your windows, create and open a new notepad file and once open drag (config.lua) file to it, once is open change the following:width = 1024 & height = 600.

once this is done, your game will open. This is Counting that you did the original steps before that were instructed in the torrent. happy gaming!"
