[V],BOZX,2011-01-25T20:53Z,actually its ok to ask for but the problem arises when ppl dont download em along... making the peer as leecher instead of a seeder.. which creates negative thoughts ....
[V],FiNEHD,2011-01-25T22:18Z,howdy. this torrent is out of date http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5070415
[V],BOZX,2011-01-25T22:35Z,@FiNEHD y is that
[V],FiNEHD,2011-01-25T23:53Z,"because the original bluray of gladiator (which your torrent is of) had a terrible transfer, whereas my torrent is of the remastered bluray. compare reviews:
your one: http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gladiator-Blu-ray/4735/#Review
my one: http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gladiator-Blu-ray/14649/#Review
or compare them yourself. the difference is HUGE."
