,dark_defender,2011-01-24T15:54Z,"Hi 20-40,
+1 for the encode & upload.
Wanted to ask if you have you watched ""Legends of The Fall""(Highly Underrated)? Its one of my all time fav movie.

""THIS IS NOT A REQUEST""

Now because i have already used up my quota of requests so i won't place any request for time being. If you think this movie is worth encoding then i wud be very happy get a blu-ray of this.

If you haven't watched it, then watch it - I am almost certain you will like it. Beautiful soundtrack too."
