For some reason this .vob file wouldn't extract properly from the torrent 'Wild Side (1995) Uncut/Unrated (NOT directors cut)'. 

Instead of repacking & reseeding the entire movie, & making everyone have to DL the entire thing again, I'll just offer this one file fix.

The main bulk of the film is here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6117799/Wild_Side_%281995%29_Uncut_Unrated_%28NOT_directors_cut%29

After DL, delete the corrupted file & add this to the existing folder. It works fine, it musta just been a compression glitch with winrar.
