,believenu,2011-01-26T04:16Z,thank you .seeding is sharing Has star gate universe aired since dec?
,WooZism,2011-01-26T05:06Z,"Thanx for Lie To Me

Thanx for the superb quality and small sizes

never ceases to amaze me how every time u freeze or hold requests everyone comes outta the woodwork w/ stuffz they want

@believenu check TVrage.com or Syfy.com for SGU I believe it won't begin airing again till Feb if I remember right and I know the show has effectively been canceled so they'll be finishing this season out and then that is it. Prolly for the best since the not so subtle implications of Intelligent Design really aren't appropriate for sci fi fans IMHO"
