A teenage military trainee at a juvenile offender training camp suffers peculiar symptoms after enduring an intense training course, and mysteriously, his drill sergeant is soon admitted for similar symptoms. Unable to track down the cause of the shared illness, the team searches for clues in the trainee's family medical history, and Masters and House reveal a unique bond between the sergeant and trainee. Meanwhile, when an indecent photo of Chase is posted on a social-networking site following three different romantic encounters, Chase is determined to find out which girl is trying to publicly disgrace him. Also, sensing Cuddy's stress over her daughter Rachel's enrollment at a prestigious preschool, House secretly prepares Rachel for observations and reveals a soft spot for the toddler.
