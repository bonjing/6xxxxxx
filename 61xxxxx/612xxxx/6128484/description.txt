Storyline:


A Nebraska farm community is plagued by a storm with a series of tornados acting against normal patterns. Dan is left at home to look after his baby brother Ryan along with his friend Arthur while Dan's mother is at work. His stepfather goes to check on his grandmother. When a tornado destroys the house, Dan and Arthur attempt to re-unite the family.

The people of sleepy Blainsworth, Nebraska have no idea of the deadly, unpredictable storms heading toward them - rogue tornadoes that will change their lives forever. Young Danny Hatch (Devon Sawa) must begin a long struggle to survive the night and rescue his family...through downed electrical wires, broken gas lines, and a heart stopping final escape from the twisters' fury! Based on actual events and packed with terrifying tornado footage and special effects, this gripping film is both a thrilling look at nature's deadliest force and a testament to one family's struggle to survive against the odds.
