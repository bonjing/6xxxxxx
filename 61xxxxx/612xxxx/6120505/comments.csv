,skurys,2011-01-25T00:32Z,"thingy, it asked about activating over internet during the install, i clicked skip thats right? also i set updates to recommended, and after that a screen was saying the copy is not legal in  a black box and if i paid for the dvd to ask for a refund :) is it normal?"
[V],thethingy,2011-01-25T01:59Z,"skurys, that is normal, once the installer is finished Windows will be 100% genuine, its a message to stop people selling the dvd. "

,nenad285,2011-01-25T04:08Z,"well, i read that windows 7 installation allows you to copy all your current items that you have for example your programs and such and brings it onto your win7, does this also do that?"
,toxic1337,2011-01-25T18:54Z,"Hey thethingy,
I am a big fan of your downloads and know I can trust they are not viruses.

I was wondering if this is safe.

will I still have my files?
will my programs still work?
can I use it normally as if I had bought it?
can I be traced?

A Reply would be much appreciated!"

,melissailene,2011-02-17T15:06Z,"I got this a few weeks ago and installed 7 Ultimate on my laptop. Everything has worked great, except that I can neither find the sidebar to turn it on, nor can I locate anything relating to the sidebar or gadgets anywhere on this system.

This could somehow be my fault, because the first thing I did when installation of the OS was complete was to turn off many of the features and graphic enhancements that I did not use often to boost my laptop's performance. I had also turned the UAC settings all the way down to enable more customization.

 I have been up all night trying to figure this out. Since then I have turned the UAC all the way back up, as I was informed that this could be preventing me from enabling the sidebar. From that point, I was informed to follow Start>Programs>Accessories>Windows Sidebar, and open it from that location. 

However, there is no 'Windows Sidebar' folder there. There's no sidebar folder/files/information anywhere on here, and searches return no results.

Have I somehow deleted this information? Or was the Windows Sidebar not implemented in this version of the OS, or more specifically, this package? I believe I turned of the necessary settings for the sidebar, but I don't understand how I could have deleted it. I expect this to somehow be my error, I just lack the knowledge to confirm it.


Thank you, again, thethingy, for all of this software. It's a very empowering feeling, to wield such tools without fiscal boundaries."

Both jankro and mcrorlando have pointed out that when they try to upgrade their current Win7 (non-SP1) installations, they get this error message:
""get the error message that says:

To upgrade, you need to be running Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 installed. Close the installation, open Windows Update, and then check updates for Service Pack 1.""
I want to do an upgrade also since I don't want to lose all my apps and other configs. Could you please answer this question?"
