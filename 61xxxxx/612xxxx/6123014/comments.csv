,onesoft,2011-02-28T18:57Z,trojan??
,Sajuuk_Khar,2011-03-02T21:44Z,Trojan found in the Patch - trojan win32/dynamer!dtc
,phonemateire,2011-03-09T13:35Z,"I can't get this to work either. When the patch is executed it just goes through the motions and says patched nothing. Am I putting the patch in the wrong place I wonder, help would be nice"
,alekdrake,2011-04-29T06:02Z,You must be doing something wrong. I have been using KK's torrents for years and have never had a problem with them. As for trojans must be a false positive. Your virus scan will see a keygen as a virus for example and if your patch isnt working well thats probably why too. If it doesnt work after you have taken out the so called virus well think about it it must be important. You guys really need to learn a thing or to about using pirated software before you start screaming virus cuz I call bullshit.
