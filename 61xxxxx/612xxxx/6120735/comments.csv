I always seem to mess things up."
[T],locobot12,2011-01-23T09:07Z,"@osaka
there is the install file [.exe] and there is patch .. why do u need instruction!!

but if ur having trouble -
1) run exe file instll completely!
2)restart when prompted !
3)after restart right click on taskbar anti-trojan elite and quit!
4)open patch file - IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE [VERY IMPORATANT]
5)patch will ask to search for TWO fileS
patch accordingly and done!!"
