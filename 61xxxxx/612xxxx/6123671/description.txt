The film contains scenes considered shocking to Chinese audiences, but is beautifully photographed.  After Cape No. 7, Taiwan's most talked about movie of 2008 was probably My So-Called Love starring top actress Barbie Hsu (Connected, Meteor Garden). Casting off her reserved image, Hsu is willful and alluring in her portrayal of one woman's tumultuous search for love over a decade's time. Featuring an original score by Mavis Fan and love scenes that had the media buzzing, the film co-stars three of Taiwan's most popular actors as Hsu's romantic interests - Joseph Chang (Eternal Summer), Eddie Peng (Exit No. 6), and Easton Tung Ming Hsiang (Island Etude). Produced by Hsu Li Kong (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), My So-Called Love marks the feature-length debut of director Leading Lee, a rising star in the industry already well known as a writer and photographer.
