For those who have over 30 ... Writing this, remember the end of this decade and the first meetings with school friends at the home of my parents. And in that time, here in Argentina, it used to have parties that called them "rounds. " The girls and boys working with the food and drink, respectively, had some music cassettes, another brought the equipment to listen to, etc. So it was back then, we had a good, some couples were born at that time (mine, for example) and to this day continue together. Also, this friendship still continues over the years. What good times! I hope you enjoy this album as much as us! A big hug!
