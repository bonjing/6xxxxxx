Woodsman
Rare Forms (2011)

Woodsman are a Denver, Colorado based psychedelic quartet who have been playing a tight mixture of tribal drones and psychedelic rock music since the middle of 2008, and have announced their debut full length, the suitably vague â€˜Rare Formsâ€™ to drop January 25th on Lefse and Fire Talk. Since formation theyâ€™ve released a series of short records: Indoor Days, Collages and Mystery Tapes in a succession nearly as condensed as their CMJ showcase set times (where apparently they blew minds) at the close of last month. Despite being a drummer short of their usual percussive play-offs, their expert manipulation of loops, samples and reverb pedals at the showcase went down very well indeed. The studio sound is equally impressive; vocals are not a necessity but a novelty, and shrill repetitive riffs perhaps discarded by other musicians are looped and bedded by brooding murmurs of electronic noise. The whole effect is sometimes null and sometimes tribal, disassociative of any era or genre other than disorientating horns, splashes of 60s psychedelic folk, and psychedelic rock indicative perhaps of years with The Incredible String Band, Black Moth Super Rainbow and Ariel Pink on their lo-fi vinyl players.
