From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Stephen Gregory, spokesperson and opinion editor of the English version of Epoch Times, about Lang Lang, the Chinese pianist who played at the White House State dinner last Wednesday. China knew hours before Lang Lang's recital that he would play the theme song to the movie â€œBattle on Shangganling Mountain,â€ used as a victory song and depicts when the Chinese fought against the â€œAmerican Imperialistsâ€ at Triangle hill (Shanganling) during the Korean War. 


Author and GCN radio host Webster Tarpley will talk with Alex about the Moscow airport bombing.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
