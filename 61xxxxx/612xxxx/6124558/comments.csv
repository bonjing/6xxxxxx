All worked well with the exception of PC Booster accepting the serials provided.  None of the Serial combinations work.  The other all accepted the erial combinations 

For your info:
Also after restarting the programs, they all insist to be upgraded.  All the programs I updated appear are Okay and work fine.  If you choose to not upgrade the program wont start.

You don't need to update, and app will never force you to update. To keep the serials valid, you have to block the app with your firewall. NEVER check for downloads."
