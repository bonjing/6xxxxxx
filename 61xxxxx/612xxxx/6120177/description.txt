Note:
"NO" one line on TDX speaks about final size video if video + subtitles are used (also for non english spocken releases). So nuke is in any case wrong.

We repacked just for our courtesy, probably the nuker is the only one that still use to masterize it.

Now is a total of about 716.000 (including avi+idx/sub), we reworked audio offcourse from original DVD ac3 audio.

Note for nuker:
Our previously SyncFiX for release named  The.Presence.2010.FESTiVAL.DVDRip.XviD-iLG works perfectly. Release is ALL in sync from start to the end so please check better your configuration or use appropriate codec or just stop to drink  :)  

Note that first sensible rumors start at minute 00.10.00.000 (nothig rumors or words before) and there is NON oos.

00.16.50.000  (first movie speacking) IN SYNC
00.22.07.000  (second movie speaking) IN SYNC
00.24.03.000 till 00.28.00.000 (third movie speaking) IN SYNC
00.33.29.000  (speaking) IN SYNC

etc... etc...

so we repeat stop to drink on the night.... or PROOF what you say..... with REAL proofs and not a lame reasons.
