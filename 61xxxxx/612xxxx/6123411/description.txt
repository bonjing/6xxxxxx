SUMO Hatsu Basho- Day 15 â€“ Jan 2011 (Xvid-AVI)
Here is day 15, of the Hatsu Basho!  Hereâ€™s hoping that Katchi-koshi happens to those worthy!
File Folder contains;
-	Hatsu.2011.15.E.mpg		Original English broadcast *.mpg
-	Hatsu.2011.15.N.mpg		Original Japanese broadcast *.mpg
-	Hatsu.2011.15.avi		Dual Language *.avi (use VLC media player for best results)
-	Hatsu.2011.15.docx		this description, in a document
-	Torrent downloaded from Dem*noid.com.txt		advertising!

Choose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (faster DL).  As with all my previously uploaded Basho, I will continue to seed until the Haru Basho (the second Sunday in March).  Until thenâ€¦  please keep the seed alive!
