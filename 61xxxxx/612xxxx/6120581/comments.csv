,Maurosso,2011-01-22T21:28Z,"it's a multi6, so most likely, the languages have some bulk...and if you choose to install only one of them, other stay on the dvd...so you can have a 17gig instal, with a req of 10gb..."
,Soolgoolg,2011-01-22T21:46Z,"i just unselected anything not EN, the movies take up 4 gigs cuz of the other languages, u can take out roughly 3.5 by removing excess movies, it shud install fine, if not ill just redownload just those files"

,reking,2011-01-23T16:29Z,What do you mean ilefx?
,Mindblast,2011-01-23T17:16Z,"I cannot get ILEFX's fix working. 

Can anyone describe a step-by-step? Does it require a hex editor and if so which one?(and which settings...)

Any help apreciated!


ILEFX: you are way too cryptic for someone who doesn't do this all the time. please elaborate?"
,Voker57,2011-01-23T18:40Z,Can't find such file... Where exactly is this temporary folder created?
,zerkz,2011-01-23T22:14Z,"The thing with his solution , is that it looks to be a hex editing job. The Deadspace 2 f_activation file is in one of the temp folders, under users/temp/local and in mtfs....

However, atleast using the eng installation, i cannot find any hex's that are the same to his."
,halowars,2011-01-23T22:23Z,Has it really got hungarian language??
,LTComm,2011-01-24T12:29Z,Yes. And full hungarian sound :)
,Blackluc,2011-01-25T00:09Z,"@ voker57 I couldn't find it either, but got it now.  It's in C:\Users\*name*\AppData\Local\Temp\mtka_tmp

But can't find the hex lines...  We need more explanations"
,MasterSpeed555,2011-01-25T03:12Z,i can find the lines with cheat engie at memory viewer but i dont know how to save them :-ss
,Blackluc,2011-01-25T04:51Z,"I get the lines too with cheat engine, I don't know yet what's the rest...  I get to 007C2FAA and 007C2FAB but don't know what to do after, with the 74 to 90 and the 12 to 90 thing + what's next"
,Blackluc,2011-01-25T12:37Z,We are the 25 and the activation requires cd-keys
,FistBag,2011-01-25T14:35Z,can some one tell me when the crack is out? damn im bored out wanking here and i wanan play some horror dead space style but the first one got really boring after 7 replays......
,elturbo9077,2011-01-25T19:59Z,ya stupid people shut up skidrow i don't think razor or reloaded is gonna release it becuase it takes like 15 hours to download it from steam plus a hour to crack and then 2 to upload so crack will be release on tow or at later on today 
,dou32,2011-01-25T22:39Z,"come on people, seed for a while so the other 5,000 people who want to play this game can"
,lucid657,2011-01-26T01:59Z,"This game is scary as balls, i couldnt wait so i bought it!"

,ea-drm,2011-01-27T14:44Z,"DS2 can not be cracked, at least for two or three months.
It uses the newest drm technology, 
so the bestway to play the game is to buy it, and give your money away, a pity!

I have a friend who is one of ea's anti-pirate researching team, he told me that 
even the best hacker will find it challenging to
crack this new drm... 
"
,kaliver,2011-01-27T17:01Z,"Ubi's ""latest DRM"" didn't take 2-3 months to crack. Some EA hack's thoughts on their latest DRM doesn't interest me in the slightest."
,yokos123,2011-01-27T19:16Z,"The game is already cracked.  Scene groups just wait allowing publishers to make some money. I wish they would simply stop cracking pc games and force people to buy originals. 
Stop asking where is the crack  the longer we wait , more money the publishers will make , translating to more games for pc if there is a profit potential. "
,tavisjohn,2011-01-27T21:17Z,"I have downloaded cracks or cracked versions of games I own because the DRM is either not compatible with newer computers, OR the DRM makes the game un-playable.

So I do not even consider buying a game until it can be cracked.  Only then will I consider buying a game.  Why?  Because I like to keep my games and play them again and again.  I have some games that are 15-20 years old that I STILL play!"
,crb123456,2011-01-27T22:33Z,so wherZ the HAWX2 crack then...if hasn't already been 2-3 months without crack............
,deadplace,2011-01-27T22:38Z,"DRM doesn't do shit to stop piracy, nor does it help to regionalize a game's release since the amount of piracy seems directly proportional to the High cost, and limited availability of games, as well as unsecured access to scene releases. Since i don't think TPB or for that matter any scene will be going any where anytime soon.... I'd say DRM doesn't offer much more than a backlash from the very consumers these companies are trying to do business with.

Doesn't seem to make any sense to me, especially when i could go and spend 60 bucks on black ops which is at least worth playing for its multiplayer.... screw 10 or even 21 hours of single player game time.... come on people that's just a way to procrastinate..."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-01-28T06:44Z,"(ea-drm), ignore this Troll, he is scribbling his  crap all over the other Deadspace 2 boards, he is a gay, sack of man seed. ignore totally."
,tasospapa,2011-01-28T14:53Z,ea-drm this troll is writing in all dead space 2 torrents in the site dont give him feedback is afucking troll
,optimusprime2,2011-01-29T07:51Z,"Can anyone confirm the procedure that was mentioned earlier about not needing the DS2DAT2/3/4 to play the game in english. My download is not yet complete but if i remove those files along with the foreign languages i can play the game.
Replies pls :|"
,schrade,2011-01-29T19:40Z,"Can someone Please tell me how to get past the part where it asks for a serial key when I install the game? Someone mentioned that I shouldn't need the key.
If thats not true can someone please then give me a working key? Thanks"
,shoshenq,2011-01-30T01:57Z,"Ok guys I went thru registration just to help those who were in my situation 3h ago. You don't need to click on activation (so you don't need a serial), simply copy paste the *fixed* crack from FLT to the main menu and double click to start playing, enjoy ! ^^"
,shoshenq,2011-01-30T01:59Z,"sorry for doublke post, what I mean is that the game is already installed, so DONT clik on activation, replace *.exe and run, voila.

Game works, perfect release, I'm alt tabbing out of it no problem !!"
,schrade,2011-01-30T18:00Z,"@shoshenq
