From Wiki:



Simply Red was a British soul band that sold more than 50 million albums over a 25-year career. Their style drew influences from blue-eyed soul, new romantic, rock, reggae and jazz. Since its early days the main driving force behind the band was singer Mick Hucknall, who by the time the band broke up in 2010 was the only original member left.
