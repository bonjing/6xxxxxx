,qazawe,2011-01-23T08:06Z,":) i'll download n c. um it is suppose to say ""fight for the troops 2"". i think Tribute to the troops was a world wide wrestling thingy, i may b wrong.  "
,Fartalot,2011-01-23T09:23Z,"I wonder if this one is fake, too."
,arnarson80,2011-01-23T09:46Z,"I doubt this is fake, it's from a VIP user and not some idiot like the fake version earlier."
,Fartalot,2011-01-23T10:31Z,"OK arnarson80, you are probably right, but the wrong title (""Tribute"" to the troops?) is slightly worrying.

I am downloading CD1 just to see if it's fine, and will report back. Sadly, the DL is really slow."
,wolf_ink,2011-01-23T10:43Z,Dibya's UFC uploads are always real & always great quality ... DLing now ...
,aCzil,2011-01-23T11:09Z,"it's ok, NO fake, Thx !"
,Fartalot,2011-01-23T11:46Z,"I can confirm, this is genuine."
,arnarson80,2011-01-23T12:06Z,I was thinking the same thing about the title mr Fartalot ;)
,qazawe,2011-01-23T12:43Z,":D yippers this is ufc fight for the troops :D ... lol sowy lol. i thought mayb becoz of the title it was the world wrestling one ww tribute to the troops, but it ain't lol "
,Fartalot,2011-01-23T15:45Z,"Well, this one's a keeper. Every single fight on the card was a good fight, and the guys truly fought their hearts out."
,bandit65,2011-01-23T18:55Z,"Genuine stuff!!
Thanks alot!!"
,Onizuka3,2011-01-24T03:58Z,"It's called Tribute To The Troops 2 because it's the 2nd one you moron :)

Man. People really really worry me >_> They did this last year, or the year before. And so that's the reason why it's number 2 :)"
,wolf_ink,2011-01-24T11:50Z,thanks Dibya ... great work as ever
