,konking,2011-02-06T05:10Z,Direct download kept dropping out glad you uploaded this torrent buddy. Good call.
,KEEVVY,2011-02-14T20:50Z,Hey where can I found the game for free?
,Pyrosite1,2011-03-03T09:06Z,whats up with the game id like to try it and see if its better then the first.
,willis00,2011-03-11T21:40Z,I love Vietnam and the music that is associated with the war. You should add the BFBC 2 trailer song (for what its worth). Also DICE should have added some other songs from the Forrest Gump soundtrack and wake up Vietnam
,Swaffles,2011-04-18T07:24Z,"Dude! I love you man!

I love this game, and have been looking forward to a release of the music in it. You are awesome for setting up this torrent.
