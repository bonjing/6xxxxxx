I have put this copy on here only to speed up its inevitable distribution. Apologies for the crap cornish upload rate.

The makers have stressed that the leaked early copy is not the film they wish distributed, as this is a non profit film I see no reason to go against these wishes.

Please share this film, it is after all the point.

,Untrapuka,2011-01-27T07:04Z,Is there really any difference between this one and the leaked one?
,P2P-ftw,2011-01-27T09:31Z,"LEAKED VS ONLINE Not much diff taht I know of, its the same length, maybe better quality and slightly diff shots, but none of which ive seen... THIS ISNT A OFFICIAL RLS OTHER THAN TO COPY THE YOUTUBE STREAM,  THE PRE RELEASE IS BETTER!"
,P2P-ftw,2011-01-27T09:37Z,"slightly tech diffs, but i havent viewed the full internet/dvd rls, the length alone makes me think it was jargon about differences"
,DarthExile,2011-01-27T15:22Z,omg yess another shill made production and the sheep eat it up 
,sqkmarshall,2011-01-27T15:46Z,"The difference between the leaked copy and original is the first is the film the makers intended to release and the other is not, nothing else.

It is your choice to watch either, the makers ask you regard only the original as it is their privilage to do so.  

This movie is free anyway. "
