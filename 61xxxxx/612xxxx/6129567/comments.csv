Great Movie To Get Warmed Up Before Starting Dead Space 2.

Love How It Used Many Different Animation Styles, Better Than The First Movie."
,kimjongwil,2011-01-31T05:51Z,"wow, terrible movie - seems like the writers and artists didn't play any of the games - style and tone is way off - stross is completely unrecognizable in this compared to DS2 - no real links, and totally irrational/illogical characters - totally infuriating - i thought these spacemen were professionals like doctors and engineers and soldiers - their combined IQ is somewhere around a small bag of cheetos - the kind that are given out during halloween - also, at some point they just throw progression out the window and instantly the ship is completely swarming with all types of monsters - can you say ""cashgrab""? 

the cg looks like early ps2 cutscenes or something. 

thanks for the up, though - quality is high"
,TorrentMonster,2011-01-31T19:47Z,"DONT download this movie, its fucking crap!!!

the 3D animation looks like it was made in 1995 (hell, even the cinematic videos in Diablo 2 looks better than the 3D animation in this movie!) and its not even close to the dead space games!"
,Shadow_Dreamer,2011-02-01T06:38Z,"Q: Will this play off a USB into my LG Plasma? 

A previous 658mb version didn't, and 7SiNS was thanked, so i thought I'd better ask without just blowing 2.64gig on a not compatible file.

Thanks."
,Jayzen_Freeze,2011-02-01T18:35Z,You are joking right the lg only plays pictures and very small video files I do not think it can even play music let alone a blu ray lol
,weaping_reaper,2011-02-01T22:24Z,"@Shadow_Dreamer.. Get a VGA cable man, and sum nice computer speakers, If you don't already."
,somedude.1001,2011-02-02T07:35Z,"According to this movie, the Marker telepathically creates the Necromorphs from dead tissues instead of preventing that to happen like in the original storyline. What the fuck happens to the Infectors? Fucking horseshit, man."

,salzo,2011-02-02T20:43Z,"@Shadow_Dreamer: you are right. Mi LG LE5500 TV can play this kind of files directly from the USB. It supports H264 (x264), DivX, XVid...inside AVI, MKV, etc. Up to 1080p. It doesn't supports DTS audio but you can reencodeit to AAC with Avidemux."
,b0yxjtr4i10,2011-02-04T03:29Z,Nice movie and nice game
,lontrus,2011-02-05T13:23Z,"where can i find a REAL 720p version of this ?
all the retards who write there torrent names to 720p usealy are 526p 528p 544p what is not 720p

if i have fullHD screen that means 1920x1080 and 720p is 1280x720 not 1280x528
720p means the hight of the picture so why on earth you retards write 720p if it's not 720p ???
btw whats the point of wide screen fullhd if all these retards have made the picture so wide that u need 2 screens to watch them without the black edge on top and buttom"
,somedude.1001,2011-02-06T11:37Z,"Man, youre a fucking idiot. These are anamorphic widescreen directly ripped from BluRay. The rippers did not make the videos in that ratio, the BluRay makers or movie publishers did.

Do you really think the massive community of people who work with videos on a regular basic are stupider than you? You sound like an idiot who just bought a cheap ass HDTV yesterday and searched 720p on Google."
,Furious1964,2011-02-09T19:21Z,I'm getting no sound for this. Anyone know what codec I should use?

,cookooshit,2011-02-13T16:52Z,"Can some one help, the movie is 1 hour 17 mins long yet it only plays 56 mins of the movie then ends."
,fightthenwofuckers,2011-02-15T21:13Z,THE CUNT THAT WROTE THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE HIS WRITING HAND CRUSHED AND THEN SEWN UP DEEP INTO HIS ARSE. HE SHOULD HANG HIMSELF WITH HIS OTHER HAND RIGHT AFTER BEING FUCKED IN THE ASS BY A WILD STALLION DURING A FULL MOON.
,romanof,2011-02-18T21:29Z,@fightthenwofuckers seriously... have looked at some of these movie torrents and on 1 out of 4 i've seen you posting the same shit over and over again... Just stop it.
,RBostrom06,2011-02-20T12:16Z,"This was the worst movie I've seen in my life. It is the biggest joke computer generated parts and changing maing styles of anime is just retarded. Why the fuck do people change races? How can you put together a movie and have a white guy turn hispanic? I guess the graphic ""Artists"" can't do colors. And there was obviously no story board... Id say  they spent all of 3 months and 10,000 dollars on this movie. If i were them i wouldnt have made it 720 because now you can just see their fuck ups even easier. Its like they always say... you cant polish a piece of shit. everyone who worked on this movie should be ashaimed."

,Banzay27,2011-02-24T18:34Z,"Whoever finds this torrent is probably too intent on watching to listen to those adivising against the waste of time, seeing as the downloading is fast for most, too.

Well, I'll pitch in as well, nonetheless.
If you must watch to sate your curiosity, go ahead, it's not that much of a waste of time.
But you will be disappointed. The CG segments really are mediocre. The drawn segments differ, they are not all done in the same style and at least one of them is awfully bad.
And then we come to the script - this is absolutely the worst detail. Whoever produced this is below average and has weak creativity and imagination. And whoever directed is about as bad. The movie is meant to give the scares, but it will mostly just frustrate you with its stupidity. Just about every plot development is forced and doesn't come about realistically.

Ah hell... I, for one, liked the game very much and was longing to watch something Dead Space where there's actually more than just the hero and swarm of necromorphs with occasional NPC interactions, but turns out this movie is manages to fall short of the first one.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but if I convince you of the disappointment now, I'm also saving you some time.
Hell, at least we're not paying for it, blessed be the PB. This is the kind of thing you'd feel is really stupid to receive as a gift, utter waste of money.

Now, onto actually good entertainment: Dead Space 2 for the PC."
,Banzay27,2011-02-24T19:18Z,"By the way, Christopher Judge (Teal'c) voices the black guy here. What a waste of talent!"
,wtfronsson,2011-02-25T16:08Z,"this movie sucks so hard. huge letdown, because the first anime was pretty solid. the games are very good too, but this shit... oh man..."
,nekrosis,2011-04-07T17:38Z,Nekrosis will seed as long as computer lives!
,capridrifter,2011-10-02T09:07Z,Why in hell would you have hard coded English subtitles with an English movie?....not only is the movie so bad its funny but the pointless subtitles are horribly distracting. Thank you for taking the time to upload but PLEASE don't waste your own valuable time putting up a movie if its got pointless subtitles!
,Gelious,2011-10-06T17:37Z,"capridrifter, LOL! Do you know that USA and Great Britain  are not the only existing countries? And people which native language is not English? So STFU!"
