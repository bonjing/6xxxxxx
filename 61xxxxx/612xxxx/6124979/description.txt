Venue: CoreStates Center

Recording: AUD
Quality: 9(-)
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments: Master. Single cam on the balcony slightly right of center. 
It's a bit shaky and people get in the way but the picture quality is excellent. 
Partially shot on screen. 
Audio is good and clear but uneven, the right channel goes in and out 
which is very annoying and accounts for a slightly lower rating.
