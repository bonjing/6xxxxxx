,Real1tYofficial,2011-02-25T15:44Z,"really well made documentary if u got the time to watch the whole part, it explains the relativity of universe and take up very important scientific discoveries of science. 
however, it doesnt come with much new info due to the fact that the info that if taken up in this video is already known since before but this movie is simplifing it a lot for me.
