IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Season Of The Witch SERENiTY... :) Thanks Mates
AUDIO: TOXiC's + OWN CAM Audio... :) Thanks Mates

Thanks to our friends SERENiTY Thanks Mates... :) Now first of all there are some issues with autofocus on this one, nothing we can do about that but its still a better video that our last release. We have done our normal filtering to this of white balance, croma, brightness, along with a few RGB color changes. The audio was from our V1 which was TOXiC's line audio so. The reason for the READNFO is because the other video source is missing more than a few small to large chunks of video, so we had to use cam audio to fill in these areas since TOXiC have not released the full audio yet.
