Just the E3 trailer in GIF format.  I use it as my desktop wallpaper and it's a hell of a lot more interesting than a static image.

Beware, it's a bit of a memory hog.  Higher end machines will have no problem, but it does take a few minutes to install to the desktop for the first time.  After that it's been gravy, even on boot up.

Installation:

Once you've finished downloading it, right click on the desktop and select Properties, then select the Desktop tab, click Browse and locate the file.  Double click on it, select the center position, hit apply and give it a few minutes.

Random Info:

Every frame from the trailer is used, played at around 4 centiseconds between frames, which I've found to be a pretty decent speed.  A little slower than normal, but it keeps the performance up and still looks good.  The original video is in 360p I believe.

enjoy.
