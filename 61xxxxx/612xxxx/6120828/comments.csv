you must install the game and wait for the crack.
and install the game doin' this:

copy the entire folder of the game in programs and files in hard drive
now open the folder ""__Installer"" inside there's a folder named ""DISK1"" now run ""EASetup"" (don't forget to install the game in the same folder where you paste the entire game folder)
take like 1 minute or so to install because all the file are already there when your copied the entire folder of the game."

ok, take it easy
step 1: uninstall and delete dead space 2 folders inside EA folder to be sure that everything is gone and we gonna star all over again.
step 2: copy the entire folder of the game that you downloaded in program files.
step 3: go to disk1 in the same folder that you already copied (forget the original) and click in EAsetup.
step 2: the path must be ""where you paste the folder of the entire game""
(program files ""Dead Space 2 MULTI 6 "" or the name that winrar gave it ""
if everything gone well the short cut of the game in your desktop must open the ""date"" window."

Shut the fuck up. Some reasons we pirate are:
1) To test the games on our computer to see how well it performs before we buy.
2)To play long forgotten games that are extremely unstable on any modern computer today and, due to the unstability, wouldn't be worth buying.
3)To test the quality of the game before we buy if there is no demo.
4)If many bugs are present, to play the bug filled version for free until the developer (or even IF the developer) fixes those bugs.

We aren't all assholes. If we really enjoy the game, most of us will actually buy the game. We like developers that put out good products and support it after its release. Like Minecraft. I pirated it, tried it out, loved it, and bought it because I like the developer and want him to be able to continue to work on the game. Garry's Mod as well. I pirated it, had a lot of fun with it, and bought it for the multiplayer."

Lmao. Are you seriously bitching about piracy on a site that probably contains mostly pirates? Yeah you're really gonna get people to agree with you. And who the fuck gives a shit about Halo games being on PC? WHO CARES. Companies make more money by exclusive titles for their consoles. 

Piracy has NOTHING to do with the lack of PC games, it's the console kiddies that are to blame for sucking console dick because they can't handle a mouse and keyboard."

Every single title you just listed as missing from PC was is an 360 game. And more importantly - Microsoft more than likely paid to keep it that way. If you're going to blame anyone for PC being less popular, it's MS, they go out of their way to keep games on their console. It's not like the majority of the titles are particularly hard to port to PC, the 360 runs pretty closely to a pc, that's why XNA games can be ported simply by changing the compiling options.

I would buy more PC games, but for some reason, while console game prices tend to go down pretty uniformly(new release price, recent release price, old game price), PC games tend to sit at the same price until they hit the bargain bin. If developers recognized that by making a game affordable, more people will buy it. Sacred did amazingly well after it was picked up as a budget title by big bytes. It went from a game nobody had heard of to a bestseller. "

Most pirates will download a game, then eventually buy it if they like it. Personally, I will buy something if its done right. Look at the Orange Box for example, when it came out it was listed at 49.99$. But yet you had amazing games in it like Half Life ep Two, Team Fortress 2, Portal, AND it also included a copy of Half-Life 2 AND Half Life Ep One. I mean come on, thats a bargain, I didn't even bother pirating it because I thought it was such a great thing! Other companies can release something like that, but trust me, they're not going to do it because people still buy their stuff for 60$.

I think crack gonna be released 28.01.11???
like european release date?"
,jzenman,2011-01-26T15:24Z,"This is a silly argument whether or not you should buy the game. Some people say the price of the game is too much in their country, some say they try the game out first then buy it, some people just call themselves pirates. 

It's a simple fact that everything about media has changed since the creation of the internet and p2p. The companies that make the games are always going to make money because a large percentage of the people playing games are just not skilled enough to know how to crack games on a PC.

Plus cracking games on an XBOX or PS3 is even more complex and most people don't have the time or energy to hack their box. 

The game, music and movie companies know this and there's not much they can do about it. Look at how Wikileaks has changed news media. Sure the people in power want to shut it down but try as they might the cat is already out of the bag. 

I'm an artist myself and since I get all my music, movies and games off bittorrent I had to give my CD out for free or I couldn't live with myself. I do have a place where you can buy it but I know that's for the people who want the actual CD case and want to donate to my art. 

The fact is I get most of my money from live shows not the sale of CDs. And unless I become hugely famous I won't have a distributor for the CD anyway. And if I did that I only get a fraction of the sales anyway. So I just distribute it myself and market it myself. And if anyone does buy my CD I get almost %100 of the profit. Fuck the corporations. They have been screwing the artists for years anyway.     "
,Pothead808,2011-01-26T15:25Z,"I think it is funny he said this is the end of piracy..think back, in the past 10 years, and all the precautions the developers took to make it Un-pirateable....can you actually think of 1 game that doesnt have a working crack out?!

,KirtDahaar,2011-01-26T16:52Z,"I agree with pothead808 100%. The companies have power to change these things and they are all aware of the situation but instead of doing something about pricing they throw huge amounts of money on protections that don't really work and get mad when someone cracks them.

To an extent so great that they will eventually spend 30 dollars a day to fix the 1 dollar problem. Game developer/publishing companies are no different. They see pirating as a huge threat to their efforts, therefore they release DRM software and whatever other countermeasures thinking they are saving/making so much more money now, when they truly are not, simply because the problem does not exist and/or is completely irrelevant.

There has beeen someone posting fake skidrow cracks for the past 2 weeks so be careful when a new one pops up. Usually its flagged as fake pretty quick so a 404 error will show up instead.
Its taking some time most likely because they need to play through the game first and figure out the DRM. Like in the case with AC2. For now, play something else and keep your mind occupied :) porn works too!"

Nice name......... you must be like one of those loser Ubi developers that came on here when AC2 came out and started bitching about how piracy is killing jobs.... whatever, talk about corporate brainwashing. Ubi's DRM and general customer ethics has made me not purchase a single product ever since.   

Sorry but as it stands, I'm not going to buy Dead Space 2 because its sold at a ridiculous price of 60$+tax. For a few hours of fun, that seems a little excessive to me. For now, I don't mind waiting that long for a crack. I have other games that can keep me busy.  Plus a ton of porn :)
And even if a crack never shows up, i'm not going to buy DS2 unless its on sale on steam.
EA should learn from what Valve is doing, selling their games for dirt cheap and still making money year around. Look at the orange box for example, its original retail price was 49.99$ but it gave you not just one game, it gave you HL: Ep1, Team Fortress 2 and Portal (all brand new games available only on the Orange Box). On top of that they gave you a copy of HL2 and Counter-Strike Source.
Now tell me, if I had to choose between a copy of DS2 with this new ""un-crackable"" DRM for 60$ or a copy of the orange box for 49.99$ with ALL those games, I wouldn't even bother torrenting the orange box because its such a great deal. Tell EA to learn that lesson.  "

Your seriously underestimating scene groups here.
Skidrow cracked even the toughest new DRM Ubisoft put with Assasins Creed 2 and Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands. That DRM was/is the smartess ive seen so far. I dont exactly know the details on how the DRM works but i know that the game needed ""Random"" Files to be downloaded on the fly from a master server everytime, it was hard to crack for scene groups because the files it asks for are not always the same, its always randomizing. Earlier methods included emulating the server , but skidrow figgured it out and released a proper crack. It took awhile but they still did it.

So if Skidrow can crack something that complicated and tricky, they can certainly crack this one. This games DRM Is nothing but a new version of TAGES (solidshied i believe). TAGES is a tough DRM To crack i must admitt, but scene groups have already learnd from it when it was used in Riddick Assault On Dark Athena, it took several months but in the end it still got cracked.

I think theres two steps to cracking this game.
first would be with the online cd-key check it needs in order to decrypt the files. After the files have been decrypted the executable would then need to be cracked.

You think its never gonna be cracked but we'll see in a couple of months.

If you actualy spend 60 bucks + tax on a game that you'll only enjoy for a couple of hours, then your probably not so good with handling money or got your parents to buy it for you. But we pirates, we got more important sh!t to pay for, wer not stupid to just drop down 60 bucks on a game, on a Console port. Have fun licking EA's Balls."
,cyborg34573,2011-01-27T18:59Z,"And btw EA-Drm. Your not seeing the big picture here if your calling us pirates thiefs. EA is making people pay 60 bucks for a game, clearly overpriced for a console port, thats probably not gonna get support or any free DLC. EA is Robbing YOU son."

could also be someone who doesn't work for EA, and who has bought the game and felt so angry about people who are pirating that they feel they have to speak up.

It also my opinion that game makers these days are in fact ripping you off.
For me itâ€™s the same with all media I would buy the original if the prices were fair thatâ€™s why I am a supporter of piracy until those fuckers come to their senses and put some reasonable price tags on the products. There is actually only one game which I am going to buy this year besides Dead Space 2 which I just bought on steam because I am tired of waiting and I only have time this weekend to play it, and that is going to be Duke Nukem because I feel bad for 3D Realms they had such a hard time the last couple of years. Well I hoop they crack it so they can stick it to the man!

,kimjongwil,2011-01-28T02:16Z,"@Leignheart

the bible thumpers reference was an ANALOGY

it applies to any INTEREST GROUPS who proscribe a lifestyle for ANY OTHER GROUP - like, FOR INSTANCE:

people who think euthanasia is OK - vs the minority (as per US stats for all the good that numbers are) who go out of their way to PREVENT the ending of someone's life (usually during MASSIVE SUFFERING) just because they think everyone should live the way they think is right.

it was not a slight on religious peeps overall - even though religious peeps are included.

way to see the forest for the sky

do you find it ""frustratingly stupid"" because you MISUNDERSTOOD THE ENTIRE MESSAGE ABOUT PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND CHOICE? or do you believe I should not be able to say that individual people can make their own decisions without MORAL GUILT TRIPS from people who obviously are here ONLY TO TROLL (EA-DRM - and now YOU).

Well it never used to be like that, the pc used to get all the games, but with the rise of torrents becoming more and more mainstream, theyâ€™ve seen there profits on the pc plummet, I wouldnâ€™t bother making something, thatâ€™s only gonna be bought by 5% of the players, were the minority and they donâ€™t care anymore, i sit here time and again wondering, why have i just spent another Â£200 on another nvidia card (gtx560ti btw) when i could just go out and buy a wave ure arms like a mad parrot Xbox kinnect and have done with it, and have all the games i love and pay that little bit extra for.And then i wake up, come to my senses and think hmmmm, the xbox/ps3 graphics look like ive wipped out my ps2 when comparing it too my pc.I personally think that the pc industry would have been dead already if it wasnâ€™t for steam and the like.Also what corperates like ea, ubi, and so on need to take into account the amount of free advertising torrents create, i cant count the amount of time my friends have seen me playing on a torrented game and then bought it for there consoles, bioshock, fallout, red fraction to name but a few, all my friends have baught these titles because they saw me on a torrented copy, i also buy alot of titles after ive tried the torrent version.Now i come to the end of my rant, the conclusion ive come to is this, if we as pc gamers rely on torrents too much the pc gaming industry will eventually dry up apart for the likes of wow which i hate btw, until a new way of making games comes along i thinks this will be the pcs downfall."

You kids make me laugh thinking you're pro playing FPS games on consoles. I mean shit, nothing pro about having slow ass aiming. Ain't that why most console FPS games have some sort of faggot aimbot built in basically.

Btw the biggest games come out on PC usually. Half of these console fuckwit games you only hear for a year before release.
