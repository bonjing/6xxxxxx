Thats so true, and the whole thing isn't right, it was based on a council estate, i have friends who live where it was originally filmed, they filmed some scenes where i lived as well, but saying that i don't think the americans get our ""dark humour"" and i doubt if they ever will.

look at what they did with life on mars, they fucked that up big style and it was cancelled"

Why do you seem so personally hurt that that Americans ripped off shameless? I admit that the US shameless is a direct copy of the UK shameless...but I think your rant is directed at the wrong place. If you have such a BIG PROBLEM with the US ripping off shameless why don't you direct your rant to the ones who made it possible. The ones who made it possible for the US to rip-off shameless is the rights holder IN THE UK. Showtime can't just ""steal"" a UK TV show, they MUST have bought or licenced the rights from sombody in the UK. Maybe Company Pictures (a BRITISH television production company) or perhaps Channel 4 (a BRITISH television broadcaster). Perhaps when you get back on your meds you can write a letter to the rights holder of shameless in the UK to complain about this injustice. I must say that after reading your rant, I can say that the Americans surely don't have a monopoly on being inbred and stupid...just look in a mirror!"

,alex_power3,2011-03-04T00:52Z,"@cad40 uMadBro? honestly I can see why they would copy everything down to the script of this show; because its fucking brilliant, but the small things that aren't the same are the actors, their accents and the American-ness. honestly when I first heard of this show I downloaded the wrong version and watched the first 15 minutes of the UK version. I was utterly baffled and confused, the show wouldn't be understood at that state in the US, I have never lived in the UK so I had no understanding of the mannerisms, slang or even the small personal gestures until I saw the US copy of it. Think of it as cultural translation.

I'm going to assume not everyone in the UK is as shallow and rude as you, but you sir are being a bad representative of your country.. Man up for god's sake."

,melloblu,2011-06-14T02:51Z,Listen up Britts Americans liked the idea of the show so we used it like everything else we use to create a melting pot of a nation in which you are jealous of. The reason why is because we kicked your ass so many times and we are better than you at everything. Especially when it comes to media. You just wish you could be like us and the fact is you never will be. we are the best and make the best media so any ideas you have we can and will take them and make them better because you suck anyways. plus your accents give the world a headache and since you can never win a fight no one will ever listen to your griping so shut the fuck up. by the way obviously the american actors and the american version of the show is WAAAAY better. dont disrespect america because we are stronger and better. That is just sad.

Likewise jackass

Since you can never win a fight no one will ever listen to your griping so shut the fuck up. 
who saved your ass in world war 2?


by the way obviously the american actors and the american version of the show is WAAAAY better. dont disrespect america because we are stronger and better. That is just sad.

No, no you're not. It came from the UK so obviously the english version is better.


It's all profit and that's why the shows gone overseas, I for one don't have a problem with that but if a show has ratings netwworks will milk it.
Reading you're comment really irritated me. GTFO your high horse. You don't have a clue. Prick. "
