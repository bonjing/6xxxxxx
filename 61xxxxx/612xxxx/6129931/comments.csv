,danz207,2011-01-27T01:34Z,"Downloading now, will post wen done.
Currently downloading at about 10KB/s"
,Skylortrexler,2011-01-27T07:13Z,Singleplayer is the worst part of this game IMO.
,Synish,2011-01-27T10:19Z,"I bought this game, it was only 11 euro on steam, and the multi player is well worth it"
,joonior83,2011-01-27T15:45Z,"I assume, as with most other releases, that you can't play multiplayer?

Heard the singleplayer is kinda lame..."
,danz207,2011-01-28T06:46Z,"It says:
You do not own this game!
Thoughts?"
,danz207,2011-01-28T07:50Z,"soz, 4got to crack :S"
,y3ivan,2011-01-28T15:28Z,why would anyone want to pirate a online game
,OmniNegro,2011-01-30T00:41Z,"Why would anyone pirate an online game? Simple. Loads of games are sold that simply do not work. This way you know before you waste your money.

And if your system is somewhat weak and you are unsure you will enjoy the game you can try it out and see how it performs."
,amfefe925,2011-01-30T02:47Z,can this play online? not worth it if not
,bluexmest,2011-01-31T16:47Z,I'm downloading just to see how the xbox 360 controller work with it in single player game and if it works good I'm going to buy it
,Finuxx,2011-02-05T17:07Z,"i complete a challege and then ""mnc.exe has stopped working"".. what can i do to make the game work"
,Frice,2011-02-06T04:16Z,Anyone else think this is unreal tournament with pixar graphics?
,daneroverg,2011-02-06T15:14Z,hows the multiplayer? working?
,miko1989,2011-02-07T15:14Z,The online multiplayer is not workin no servers are loading but the most annoying thing is the game keeps crashing after u finish a battle or create an online game im sorry i cant judge the LAN cause no one with me to try it. but seriously can u find a soolution for the crashing thing SKIDROW???
,iamrudyani,2011-03-08T19:05Z,"Yup, it's true.  Game crashes at the end of each stage.  Not sure why though."
,iamrudyani,2011-03-08T19:31Z,"Guys, try this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6139301/Monday.Night.Combat.Update.1.Crackfix-SKIDROW_[ALEX]

Keep the previous cracked exe and replace the .dll and other files from this.  It worked for me as of now, I'll update if I have any trouble."
,zhool,2011-03-19T16:40Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6153003/Monday.Night.Combat.Update.2-SKIDROW_%5BALEX%5D

does not req. patch 1"
,zhool,2011-03-20T03:46Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6179689/Monday.Night.Combat.Update.3-SKIDROW_%5BALEX%5D

was uploaded just after my last post aha
again, no prev. patch req"
,zhool,2011-03-20T06:30Z,"Any1 getting the 'failed to delete..' or patching failed etc non-starts (mine is XP SP3): when prompted which OSuser account to run the game with, you have to select the admin account (ie the bottom part of the dialog), and it has to have a password of some sort; it's not the crack - legit users seem to be getting it as well, and its a pain in the arse (well it will be if i have to input a pwd all the time)
Anyway, I've been playing SP for a little while - and it seems it will be a fairly challenging mix of maintaining turret defenses, upgrading skills and frantic botblasting, as the rounds progress. There's a selection of classes and they all seem effective if used correctly, although you can die pretty quickly when it gets hot (i think the support classes will need to rely on building turrets in SP) Of course, the general rule for pirated games is no multiplayer unless otherwise stated, but MP is probably possible using VPN or whatever - try google, however if you like what you see & you're MP inclined, you'll probably get your money's worth if you buy it"
,zhool,2011-03-21T09:38Z,PS update 3 may not work (i get an c++ error)
,Yenrock7,2011-04-20T05:54Z,"@OmniNegro I totally agree, i only found out that this was mainly a multiplayer game after I installed the game. +the crash on endgame = a total waste of bandwidth."
,rik4100,2011-04-22T15:18Z,wtf he says YOU DO NOT OWN THIS APPLICATION 
,gask8,2011-05-17T19:04Z,  good game but lame singleplayer mode.
,jvezirian,2011-05-20T23:14Z,"Hey folks... This fix from the update 3 comments worked for me. I run this now on Windows 7 H.P. 64bit.

,flarnot,2011-05-26T19:05Z,"i new to trorrents and i have no idea how to crack it, any help"
,markofkv,2011-06-17T21:51Z,"if you wanna play this game online, you need update 2 and tunngle"
,pyroclastPRO,2011-06-20T05:59Z,this torrent works! tnx extremezone
,dothackjhe,2011-08-27T03:39Z,The game works on Windows 7 x64 just fine but tend to crash on my average laptop. Nice game nonetheless. 
,dothackjhe,2011-12-01T10:53Z,I tried the game on a laptop with a 64-bit Windows 7 OS in it but had not encountered problem with it except with the issue of hardware limitations of the laptop itself for the game. Then I tried the game on the same OS but this time in a desktop computer with a very able specs for the game but encountered black screen issues when running it.
