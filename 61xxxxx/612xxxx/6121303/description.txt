This collection of "Fractured Fairy Tales" -- which were prominently featured on the celebrated animated series "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" -- retells a smattering of beloved fables in a brave new way. They're like the classic bedtime stories you remember as a youngster -- except they're, well, kind of twisted. "Pinocchio," "Jack and the Beanstalk" and "King Midas" are among the 25 stories included.
