If you want this torrent, check out my original upload with 400 plus seeders here...http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6109688/Gregg_Allman_-_Low_Country_Blues_%282011%29_320_vtwin88cube"
[T],nobody2007,2011-01-23T22:57Z,"Are you sure, that is 320 kbps? Two torrents with the same bit-rate, but different file sizes???"
[T],nobody2007,2011-01-23T23:01Z,"@Backroomproductions

why do you doesnt seed? saving bandwidth?"
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-01-23T23:05Z,"This might be vbr 320. Mine is cbr 320. Which brings me to the thought, why put up a torrent that already exists with the same bit rate? Mine is over 400 seeders right now. Do the math : )"
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-01-23T23:16Z,"nobody2007...good call. Look at his files. This torrent is missing songs 9, 10. 11 & 12. No wonder the torrent is so small!
We must have shamed him into seeding now : )"
