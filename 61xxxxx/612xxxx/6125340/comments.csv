,ggman4real,2011-02-18T03:45Z,any chance of upping S04E14? Can't seem to find it anywhere...
,utke,2011-02-18T18:50Z,will you upload episode 14?
,heartland-fan,2011-02-18T23:11Z,"After a disappointing search for this week's new episode, I have found an mp4 copy of Heartland S04E14. 

It is not nearly as high-quality as the programs that err0001 has provided, but it is very watchable on a computer using VLC media player or Quick Time.

Write to me at heartlandfanUSA@gmail.com if you want to receive this copy and I will upload it to a private tracker. 

Another new episode premieres February 27th.

The season finale will be at the end of March.
