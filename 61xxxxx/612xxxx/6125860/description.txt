Europe is a great melodic hard rock band from Sweden that never got it's due here in the U.S. Those who only remember them from the 80's in their "The Final Countdown" heyday are missing out. The guys have created a lot of classic rock tracks over the past couple of decades and much of it is presented in this 2-disc collection, including an acoustic version of "I'll Cry for You," some rare B-sides and a couple of live tracks. Europe have several greatest hits compilations out there, but to me they are sub-par in terms of track selection and/or sound quality. This release makes up for past mistakes. All the tracks have been digitally remastered and sound great! I highly recommend shelling out the extra cash for the Japanese import as it contains two extra tracks, live versions of "Ninja" and "On the Loose," and a booklet of color photos of the band. To me, the two extra tracks complete a release I've waited a long time for.
