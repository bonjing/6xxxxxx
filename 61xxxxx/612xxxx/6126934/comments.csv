,oandras,2011-01-25T21:18Z,It's FAKE! It's only 7.0 not 7.02.
[V],blaze69,2011-01-26T03:57Z,"Yes Very True.. It's Only 7.0 Pro . Reason For This I Was Working On The One From The Official Download Site When I was Creating This , And Made a Mistake And Named It 7.02, Cuz The Download Free Version Is 7.02 And I Din't Change The Name. Hmm Sorry Bout That. No Love Lost ?"

The reason why such sites exist is because of your price for the software. Give a modest amount to it and people will buy legit copies.

Way to go Captain!"
,dtownbrown,2011-02-01T06:01Z,Quick question when I select many of the added effects they do not have any options no options to activate on deck 1 or 2 ect. Also when I select say 1 beat cut from beside the deck it does not select it. Am I missing additional plugins?

Virtual DJ Controller Kork nanokontrol http://www.virtualdj.com/addons/12496/NanoKontrol_Sampler___Fx.html

,danny_89,2011-02-21T17:02Z,"Great torrent! Thanks dude.
P.S. How can we still have access to the effects and skins on www.virtualdj.com if we're not licensed users? In other words, what's the serial number?"
,Chris93i,2011-02-23T15:05Z,"McAfee found a virus and said it removed it,

Then downloaded it again after finally discovering how to disable McAfee. Avast found nothing."

,nunu22,2011-03-05T12:31Z,@desiboy30xx  I'm very sorry mate. my reasoning for DL Torrents is a Cliche one but it's true. I Want to try before i Buy. And i don't like demo's cos they always lock the features that i would want to use. If i like it i Buy it =)

,P1R4T3D,2011-10-30T03:27Z,"OK PB Newbie alert!
Has anyone had the issue with the decks playing on opposite sides of the crossfader in mixlab V3.1(or any of them for that matter)?
Flick the XFader to the right & get the left deck etc?

Does anyone know if there's an option to rectify this  pls?

Apart from that it's a wicked crack & so far hasn't effected my PC. TVM Blaze69, one of the best VDJ torrents I've used so far.
Peace."

On your controller or mixer you should have a switch that says NORMAL/REVERSE switch that and you should be fine"
