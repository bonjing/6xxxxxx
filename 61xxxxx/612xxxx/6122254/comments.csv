You can also try to delete the UserData folder now and start the game without it. It should create your own files in the Super Meat Boy folder."
,mitsman89,2011-01-25T19:17Z,hmm stil not working looks like game freezing after i play 3 levels no matter what they are... and i dont seem to see any username in the game menus..... any more info on that 1? ;)
