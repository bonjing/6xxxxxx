The concert film Bill Engvall: Here's Your Sign Live features the stand-up comedy of Bill Engvall. To this point in his career Engvall was best known as one of the performers on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. The title of the program comes from the performer's catch phrase and signifies that someone has done something so stupid that they should wear a sign to let everyone else know how stupid they are.
