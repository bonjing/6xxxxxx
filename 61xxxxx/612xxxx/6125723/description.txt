"Heat of Passion"

Harry (Kathy Bates) defends an impoverished 
87-year-old woman who commits armed robbery 
to buy food. Meanwhile, in an attempt to 
impress a beautiful woman, Adam (Nate 
Corddry) takes on an unlikely case in which 
he must argue in favor of a laundromat 
owner's strict "one-child only" policy for 
his employees, but is shaken when opposing 
counsel is none other than flamboyant media 
hog Tommy Jefferson (Christopher McDonald).

Somebody break their hearing aid and/or 
glasses?

Enjoy :)
