I dedicate this tune to all human beings on earth.

The original sound-track was composed by Richard Strauss and later re-made by Eumir Deodato.

The speech originates from the movie "The Great Dictator", by Sir Charles Spencer "Charlie" Chaplin, I thought it would be a great fit, you decide ;) Share it! Spread it! Let's take Charlie's advice seriously!

Disgusting occurances are taking place in such a quick succession and show routinely that we are getting immunised even to registering shocks.

Though gregarious by nature, the human race stands divided. We do not mix up with each other freely.

As a result, there is no mutual love and sympathy, no reciprocal respect.

Lack of respect breeds distrust which ultimately culminates in hatred and consequent violence all around, alienating man from man.

Loss of love is the root cause of a crash of human values and eventually erupts into the form of tension, discord and suffering.

One is bewildered as to what is going to become of the world. 

We have to reverse the gear from violence to love and peace, by realizing the Fatherhood of God, the by-products of which is the spontaneous brother-hood of mankind.

It is possible to realize the prospect of a world family with the unifying bond of love among its members in the wake of realisation of fatherhood of God only.

The apostles laboured hard, the martyrs died in torment, the scholars and the scientists proclaimed the beauties of higher life, the sociologists untiringly inculcated the sense of duties of good citizen, the philosophers pioneered sublime thoughts, and all agreed that God is one and that man's first duty is to realize Him. He is the key to Universal Brotherhood.

Universal Brotherhood is THE way of LIFE. It is an essential part of the very conduct and behaviour of any man, who feels at home in any part of the world. 

He finds himself surrounded by his own people, his own fellow-beings, wherever he goes.

There is no stranger for him. For him it is one house, one goal, one BIG family.

I thank everybody who has in some way contributed and is still contributing to the awakening of the human race, may all of you receive eternal reward in paradise.

All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing!
