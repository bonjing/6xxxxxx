[T],Coolguy33,2011-01-24T19:12Z,Is this ripped?
[T],Coolguy33,2011-01-24T20:09Z,Ok kool
,Raziel24thereal,2011-01-24T20:40Z,Is the installer working?
,rocco_sifredi,2011-01-24T21:42Z,"why you all newbie, teen IDIOTS and alike ask such questions ? The man already said , this is a PC DVD original copy and he added there is NO crack !!! Newbie morons !"
[T],Coolguy33,2011-01-24T21:59Z,"@rocco_sifredi, i'm no newbie pal and i sure ain't no idiot ass face. The reason i asked if it's a rip is becuase this file is 7gig or so smaller than most of the other uploads on here pussy face. Don't be callin people names just for asking questions."
,shatru,2011-01-24T22:22Z,its' just 10 GB. I looked some similar torrents which is 17GB. what's the difference? I know that it is Multi3. but even...
,scyris99,2011-01-25T00:03Z,"I'd just wait for a Reloaded or Skidrow release myself. Also, to answer Shatru, you can save 3-4gb by deleting all vids but english, I am sure there are other big files like all the voice acting that you can drastically lower the filesize by omitting these as well."
,cyborg34573,2011-01-25T04:41Z,"@CoolGuy33

This is smaller because its MULTI3, meaning it only contains 3 languages, so i guess you can call it a rip from the MULTI6 one that contains 6 languages. But still if one knows how to set other language files to ""Do not download"", and just install the english files, the size will be about 9gigs."
,FistBag,2011-01-25T19:12Z,"hmmmil wait for teh crack, its 2 good google has a translation for the site"
,unit56,2011-01-25T19:12Z,"then why dont you guys set it to english only,
it will make it 2 gigs smaller"
,elturbo9077,2011-01-25T20:08Z,i downloaded it and the game is only 9 gigs the languages are useless just download the files that end up with .en
,shatru,2011-01-25T21:45Z,"russian videos was missed. each video section has size of  ~750 so if it is multi 6, it has size of ~13GB.and other language data files are small.so I think about 4GB of missing. can anyone who downloaded this verify that installation is woking fine."
,muratce020181,2011-01-25T21:56Z,wait for RELOADED
[T],Coolguy33,2011-01-25T22:16Z,"@cyborg34573, well 9gigs is sure as hell better than 10gig lol. All in all i think i will either wait for a RELOADED, Razor1911 or SKIDROW release."

,heretic2,2011-01-26T19:44Z,"Wow... still no crack, but thank god skidrow got the crack for magicka uploaded on its release day yesterday, must have taken priority. or on a more serious note maybe it was just easier. maybe tomorrow"
,koentjuh,2011-01-26T22:20Z,"To all the noobs whining about ""bweeh wtf why would you upload something that isn't cracked""; because we can immediately play it when a crack is released, while you are still downloading some reloaded skidrow stuff.

Not to say that those rips sucks, but this one looks good too.

Installing;

ht tp:/ /img54 6.imag eshack.u s/img546/8872/naaml ooscj.pn g

Finished;

ht tp:/ /img 21.images hack .u s/img21/9227/fo mxas1.png

(remove spaces)

I downloaded it in 8h 42m with an average download speed of 342,6 kB/s, so no slow stuff there either.

So the only thing that might be a problem is that it won't work when there is a valid crack released, but till then this looks legit. Good job!"

,heretic2,2011-01-27T20:13Z,"Ok everyone claims to have incredible drm, it's always broken in like a week. DS2 is no different. Has it already been cracked and they are just giving it a couple of days to sell rather than be pirated? Maybe, seems like a respectful thing to do. Useless gesture though because 95% of the people downloading it aren't going to go buy it just because it's going to be a bit longer for the crack to be posted. Some people can't afford to go blow $50 on a game whenever they feel like it, especially when there was no demo released so I have no idea how it will run on my system. But will it take 3 months to crack it? No, just no."
,jimbio,2011-01-27T20:58Z,"@heretic2
That's what I think as well. They are waiting until the game is officially released to release the crack. We just wait to see if this is true tomorrow that the game is out."

,SoulTaker916,2011-01-27T22:41Z,"@ea-drm  

i don't know why you are here. every single person here knows what being a pirate means. but since your new let me explain.

Being a pirate:
1. we know that society deems us wrong and guilty of theft (even if some of us don't agree with them)
2. we steal from the rich and give to the poor/cheep (poor/cheep being ourselves)
3. we don't give a fuck about what corporations say, because we think they are douches.
4. stronger people than you have tried to stop us they were no match for our cannons.


so as u can see, your ""plea"" falls on deft ears, and you are actually encouraging us to download your product more and be more aggressive pirates.

instead of pointlessly attacking us, i recommend that u tell your boss about these people's alternatives that they submit. i suggest if want to make us not pirates, you got to make it worth our while by bribing us and u stop running your mouth."

I think there is a lot of people who can effort $50 for a game but they still download free pirated copy. Why who knows . SO it would be nice if scene would not release crack  for at least 3 months ,forcing people who can effort to buy it . I don't give a shit about people who say the game is to expensive,  there is a lot of things that are expensive and we don't go and steal it.(some do :)) So if you are poor or  a cheap fuck just wait."

,CTM87,2011-01-28T00:23Z,"@blacky12933

I'm not impatient. I'm still replaying the first game prior to starting this one, so I'm in no rush for the crack. I was simply making a comment that rarely do crackers have any respect for game developers - if they did, they wouldn't steal and enable others to steal their games in the first place. I'm not passing judgement either way on the subject, was simply commenting. I do find it rather funny that you're on a torrent site, downloading stolen material and trying to take the moral high-ground though. Let me know how that works out for you. "
,GrimMaggot,2011-01-28T00:26Z,"@ yokos123
People who have the 50$ to spend on a game and don't do it, probably don't want the game, instead they put the 50$ towards a nice dinner or saving it for something else and they just pirate the game.

Me, if a game is good and has single and multiplayer, ill pirate it, play it, and if i like it i will try to buy it to experience the multiplayer. But if a game only has single player? I.E. Dragon Age, Mass Effect 1 and 2, DS1. I will torrent and play the single player. Cause i refuse to spend some odd 60$ for hours of time entertaining myself, i could jack off and have the same amount of fun for free.
"
,Subtracting,2011-01-28T00:39Z,@yokos123 you're really asking why someone who could afford a 50$ game would rather download it for free? um common sense tells me that he would save 50$ lol

I hate EA, but they mainly just slap there name on the box and that's their contribution, I have no problem paying to support the actual devs though.

,ophiuchus1,2011-01-28T07:23Z,"One thing I just want to say. I know a lot of people are in dispute about cracked games and their distribution. I'll say this...I'm sure the majority of people you find looking for cracked games are the people who dont necessarily have the money to buy it which is what started them on the constant path of finding cracked games. Those who have money dont spend time and effort looking for free products they have the money to buy. I am sure this is not ALWAYS the case but sure it applies to most. How is it the game industry is losing money by people attaining cracked games when most who get cracked games couldnt or wouldnt purchase the game even if there was no crack. Therefore the people with money buy them and the people without download cracks. Everyone wins. Except for those few case where you have people who have the money and just dont want to spend it...but those kind of people are the ones who get the crack and if they cant they just steal it so again there is no change in money made and lost. Thats all I really wanted to say. If you're reading this then your looking for cracks which I see no problem with(though the industry may not see it that way)but if you have money to spend on games...spend it, thats what its made for. For those without money(as myself)by them if and when you can and if you lack money....find a way to make it(LEGALLY). Where theres a will theres a way and when theres no way then...theres just no way. LOL! But you wont know unless you try. BYE BYE NOW"

First, are YOU making the technological advances that create and allow others to create these programs that allow people to make it to where you dont have to buy games and software ? If not...then...what are you speaking on such a matter for as if YOU cant be stopped from getting pirated games? There is a system and all systems are governed(some more than others)but the fact that you have no say, power, or control in how the ""system"" is governed(regulated)means your words mean absolutely nothing. If microsft or/and our internet providers so happened to make the decision to increase restrictions of regulations of distribution of programs and internet usage could YOU do anything to change that? If the ones creating these programs where shut down...would you be able to change that?
What we can do and what we do do may be within our control but dont forget that what we CAN do and DO do is reliant upon resources and those resource are controlled by ""higher ups""...not you. Therefore, what we are doing is what we are being ALLOWED to do. Its mighty big headed thinking ""pirates"" and pirated material CANT be stopped because they can be, they just havent been. But just because someone hasnt done something doesnt that something cant be done. People who are ALLOWED to win have no place speaking as if they CANT lose.

any ideas?"

,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-01T16:15Z,"@smidi

I wrote a personal one. It doesn't have infinite life, nor infinite stasis, as it stores the values in an int, for life the number is 16256, which is full life, 16128 is half of max life, and 16000 is 0 life, regardless of how much it is upgraded. It seems it subtracts 16000 from the int, and then divides the remainder by 256 to get a float, then multiplies it by your max life. lol, kind of reminds me of number encryption. I also failed to find the structs within the code :/."

Your trainer contains a virus, says my AVG ????"
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-01T18:12Z,"@smidio it is not a virus, it is a false positive. read the NFO"
,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-01T18:15Z,"@smidio

most anti-virus think that trainers are viruses, because of how trainers work. Trainers inject code, and change how the game operates, which is exactly how some viruses work.

Trainers are not in the allowed part of the AVG, because any commercial Anti-Virus doing that would be breaking the law, yadda yadda, right click options run as administrator etc etc.

the Trainer is legit."

i've been downloadin the thing for a few days, now at the end of the setup, it said I am missing the file

Electronic_arts_Technical_Support.glo
found it in the files when redownloading, but it says 100% of 0 bytes...whts happening?"
,mr357magnum,2011-02-04T13:40Z,"This is a Good Download.
It is not an ISO so you don't have to worry about putting 10 gigs on just one disc but you can if you have a blue ray disc recorder.
I divided it up on to 4 regular DVD 4.7 discs then installed it on my other Windows 7 64 bit computer.
I first made a Folder on the desktop and named it DEADSPACE 2 and then copied the contents of each disc to that folder. I also went ahead and over wrote the Deadspace 2 exe with the FLT Crack fix so that it would install with the crack already installed.
After placing all of the files from the 4 DVD discs into the DEADSPACE 2 folder on the Desktop I installed it. The only thing that happened different was that it did not create a shortcut for the game  on the desktop automatically so I went to the game folder and sent a shortcut to the desktop.
The Game started up with no problems.
I would also suggest running the game in the Windows XP compatibility mode if you have Widows 7 or Vista. Just right click on the shortcut and chose the compatibility.
I have not tried playing online so I don't know if you can or not but since it is cracked I would guess not.
I DO Recommend this download if you want the ENGLISH Version."
