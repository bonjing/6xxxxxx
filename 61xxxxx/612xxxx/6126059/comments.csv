,vtskge,2011-02-07T03:38Z,"Thank you for the movie TvTeam.  It was great quality as well as the sound was great.  Thumbs up to you.

To Zabora: Why don't you just be thankful instead of knocking someone that is helping you receive movies!  Axxo was wonderful, but whether he is fake or real, be thankful you have a movie to watch!"

,davidouu,2011-03-19T06:35Z,"Just a word of warning!!
There is absolutely nothing at all wrong with the quality of the rip, the video, the audio from a technical standpoint.
The problem, for me,lies with the fkking awful English dubbing!
If really dodgy americanised pseudo Swedish accents don't bug you...or you can't read subtitles, then this will be fine for you.....if you would prefer the film as it was intended...search for a Swedish rip with hardcoded English subs.
My thanks for the Team for making this available...my bad for not reading the small print regarding it being DUBBED! "
,ianpark01,2011-04-06T06:32Z,"Anyone seen the ""aXXo"" rip of the girl who played with fire... i cant seem to find it

I found the sceneline aXXo rip of the girl with the dragon tattoo and this one might aswell get all 3 from ""aXXo""

Thanks for this TvTeam ;)"
