if i were to upload the addons alone, then that will defeat the purpose of this torrent. if u get what i mean. =)"

,some-young-guy,2011-02-19T15:31Z,"Imagine this, you wipe your drive with DBAN and there is nothing at all that remains.  On your external HDD, you have an Acronis TIB file that has imaged your complete machine.  Do you have to reinstall your OS, then your drivers, then Acronis just to be able to migrate your backup, or is there a method one can use to imprint the backup image onto the wiped HDD?

I successfully converted the TIB to ISO with IMGburn, downloaded WinRAR but cannot locate the process to convert the ISO to an EXE, or a program I'd need to split the 60GB TIB/ISO file up to burn those frags discs,

Does anyone have a work around?  Acronis sure set the stage for users to greatly depend on their product for all aspects of cloning."

to restore Acronis image, just boot with the Acronis boot cd you created or downloaded here.  then restore from the CD.

Seagate has a free Disc Wizard program made by Acronis and works well also.  not sure which versions of Acronis it supports, but it works with non-Seagate drives."
