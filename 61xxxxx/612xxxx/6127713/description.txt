40 minute documentary exploring the ownership of one of the most famous names in European football Liverpool football club.

Under new ownership in 2007 trouble flared from the outset when Chairman Gillett & Hicks found themselves at odds with the local community and the fan base. The film explored the deep mythology of Shankly and his socialist agenda which had ingrained itself into the city and the fans.

Through the clubs history, mythology and militancy we begin to see the cracks in the modern Leverage buyout models and the implications this rampant debt holds for Football and society.

The film was released on Youtube and Vimeo receiving rave reviews:

\\\"Brilliantly made documentary showing what the club and fans have had to go through in the last few years, very informative and shows what the club means to us all. Well done to all involved.\\\"

\\\"Excellent stuff that, just finished watching the last one top marks to the queuepolitely and everyone else who helped contribute!\\\"

\\\"5 Stars\\\"
