[V],mirrormaster82,2011-01-27T00:41Z,"TucsonRican:my computer got fried only a week ago,so I lost some major collections of comics.Since there are way too many green lantern titles out there you'll have to be more specific about what issues you would want me to upload,and I can't guarantee that I'll do your request anytime soon...sorry,but that's the way it is for now..."
