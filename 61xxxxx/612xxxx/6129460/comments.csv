,prank0007,2011-01-26T19:17Z,"thnks
missin ur 480p rips"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-26T20:40Z,"@prank0007: Every week there is more 480p than 720p by factor of ten.
Maybe not the titles you want, but it is as it is. BTW. number of seeders and downloads is in favor of 720p by factor ten also - and numbers spoke us a truth, like it we or not."

,bcgarant,2011-01-27T02:48Z,Which Halloween (Uncut Version) are you talking about 720p from last week because I found 2 versions of first Halloween small-size 368 MB one by gunnsalius which was supposedly uncut but it was 1 hr 27 mins & 345 MB one done by on.off.on 1 hr 30 mins & the copy i have in a larger size is 1 hr 41 mins.

thats not it?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-27T09:36Z,"
@bcgaran: To clarify:

BluRay was released as normal movie only.

Uncut doesn't exist. Extended version does - but it is not what some think it is - or at least, what is considered as ""Extended"". It was released once in 2001, as ""collector's DVD - sort of ""unofficial""

In that DVD are inserted filmed scenes for TV in order to fill the time slot (12 minutes of additional footage (4 scenes) and has been put into. Scenes were supposedly shot in 1980, when the film was released on CultTV. The scenes were shot using the cast and crew of Halloween II (real downer) and directed by John Carpenter, himself. 

However, BluRay was requested.

720p was requested (DVDrip can be max. 480p by nature).

It is unclear how the scenes shot supposedly in time of filming of One use - the cast of sequel.

""Filling the time slot"" sounds as one shitty explanation - and I ripped original, because it is good as it is.

@muthineni: Thank you. I still don't get it why some people cannot click on my screen-name, on ""twentyforty"" on Page top - or even listen my perpetual advice about bookmarking - and scroll one fucking page down."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-27T10:08Z,"@valu59er: Hi my friend, we all have heard about floods and I know what it brings, however, I hope that good movies can provide some distraction from troubles we all have."

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-27T17:32Z,"@bcgarant: Nope. Sorry. Even my 720p is ridiculously small (however, not the smallest - and I never been after that)."
,bcgarant,2011-01-27T18:20Z,"k thx for reply, what about Jagged Edge (1985)?"
