,Erich505,2011-07-15T00:00Z,"Unless you speak French, do not waste your time. There are no subs available for this movie anywhere. The system hackers are waiting with open arms to provide you with supposed subs and I'm sure you've seen the subtitle spammers advertising in here about where to get them. Be careful with those. Be advised, there are no subtitles for this flick anywhere on the planet.   "
