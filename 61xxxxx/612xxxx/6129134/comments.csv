As for Robot , The dvd is not out as far as i know...if it's out I will upload it for sure 
Peace"
,X3MEX,2011-01-27T05:34Z,"@ all requesting
Try to give us all a favor and search good torrent site (Demonoid, TPB, etc.) first before u ask it to our good uploader.. my point is as RajMhal said ""...but i doubt if anyone is going to d/l as there is already a great rip"" .. hope u people got it..

a  good example is , ALien Anthology, if ur not lazyass and try to do a search ull find various BRrips already from diff uploaders..

Kello (3000bitrate)
HDlite (1900-2700bitrate)
MnM-RG (1400-1700bitrate)
Release Lounge (1000-1200bitrate)
etc.
u want below 1000 bitrate BRrips?
Mr.KickAss (800bitrate)
[TYNYFYD] (600-700bitrate)

but then again its up to RajMahal.. ;D"
,hardik_860,2011-01-27T06:15Z,"@X3MEX :
there is no  link of  brrip of alien 1986 frm kickass..
MNM RG rip hasn't got seeds ..........
release lounge (not 720p)...........
TYNYFYD rip is not that good...........
i think u understand me...
piece out.... mate........
@Rajmahal:what next on list of upload?"
[V],RajMahal,2011-01-27T06:17Z,"As i said earlier pls search before asking for a rip..

My next Uploads :

Internal Affairs 720p

Pride and prejudice 720p

Stay tuned :)"
,Ravlot,2011-01-27T06:46Z,"Hi Rajmahal,

The Bruce Lee uploaded by you is in Cantonese but it will be great if you can upload English version.

And 22 Bullets is also in Spanish but no English version available please help........... "
[V],RajMahal,2011-01-27T07:12Z,"@ Ravlot 

They both were released in Chinese and Spanish and there was no english audio ..even in the blu-rays ( as far as i know)
The only choice is to download them and watch with english subs "
,Ravlot,2011-01-27T18:19Z,Thanks......... will wait for ROBOT (Hindi)

greetings for all great movies fans! "
,ja_iom_jedi,2011-07-31T10:56Z,Can you think of any reason I'm not getting audio on a WDLive box. All others work fine Picture quality is excellent though
,ja_iom_jedi,2011-07-31T11:16Z,"@ me

WDTV doesn't support AAC 5.1, just AC3 5.1

Pity, vid quality is great for file size"
,xkbu,2011-09-24T06:50Z,"uh why did I get contacted by my ISP about DLing this movie???
