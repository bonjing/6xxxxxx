First of all, thanks!! You rock.

However, still some unanswered questions in the comments:

*Is SP1 integrated or is it an SP1 installer launched after install?

*Is the Pro Edition a VL one?

*Lastest Daz Loader is 1.9.7 - is this one the latest as well?

*Does Ultimate Edition work (or was it teasted)? (Because there are some comments saying it hasn't worked)

*SP1 Contains KB971033 (the update that detects 'hactivations') according to the microsoft website. Was KB971033 stripped out of this image, or is the Daz loader unaffected by B971033? I noticed that someone else said they downloaded the 1033 update without any problems. A far as I know, the 1033 update is included in service pack 1, so how does it not prevent activation?

Can I do a restore using this image to remove the message?

Thanks."

,Carobrew,2011-04-10T00:18Z,"{thethingy} Firstly thank you ever so much for your excellent uploads.  I have several of your adobe products and they work flawlessly.  Anyone having issues is simply due to not reading everything and doing the step by step as instructed.  People like you provide a great sercice to this greed infested world.

My question is about this torrent.  I d/l it but when I went to burn it, my burner software (Nero) said it was too large to burn as ISO and I had to burn it as UDF.  This is not for me but my hubby's computer that has no perm o/s.

Will it still install, or has something wacky gone on with my burner?

Thanks in advance!"
,umarnawazkhan,2011-04-10T08:44Z,"what activate do you use? 
1) Daz loader? 
2) remove WAT?  
3) BIE crack?"
,Xian-Pu,2011-04-12T19:19Z,"@Carobrew:
You are trying to burn the .iso as a file to the DVD, aren't you? You probably selected ""New""/""New compilation"" and then ""Data""/Data disc""
Instead you should find an option ""Open"" or ""burn image to disc"" or something similar and then select the .iso file."

I just made an account because I have a question about this:
I am going to buy a custom-built desktop that comes with no os. I wanna download this but is it possible for me to just download windows 7 ultimate sp1 x64, and will I be able to download updates for it in the future without getting the 'this version of windows is not genuine' dialog?
Also after I download this do what type of dvd do I burn the iso on to(e.g. dvd-r/rw etc.), and when I install the windows 7 ultimate into my new desktop do I just need to insert the disc and will options come up or something?

Sorry about bombarding you with these questions but I have never used a torrent before and I'm quite nooby when it comes to computer stuff. I know that your downloads are legit but I'm just making sure that I understand the situation.

Thanks in advance, I await for your reply."

,Slammer94,2011-07-14T06:26Z,"For all you people out there who are tearing their hair out over this, that, and the other that this torrent might/could/should do etc, I recomend grabbing a free copy of VirtualBox on the internet (or a paid equivilent on this site) and testing eberything out using that. You can start over as many times as you want, and even revert tp previous states if something goes wrong. Google it, save us from all your noobish questions :) thethingy is very busy. It's hard being this awesme. 

I don't know how you managed to pack the ability to load every version of windows into this thing, along with personalized manufacturer branding, while keeping it in a size small enough to burn onto a disc, but it's amazing. Blows my mind. You are the standard that everyone else on this site is judged on. Thank you. 

Now I'm gonna take my own advice and see if updating the security fix for hacked windows versions will affect this at all. Thanks again!"

I've never installed W7 before, only XP where you had to install a product key, so I want to be ready for if it might happen while installing this.  Also, will I be able to use this boot image to do the regular departitioning and formating of my hard drive like I have done on XP?"

 Quick question though, while installing Win7 my Anti-Virus says that the file faXcool.exe is a virus. I searched this up online and apparently it's 100% a virus (according to other virus scans online)

Can you reassure me on this?

P.S I'm using AVG AND I know AVG has premature detecting skills but I just want to make sure =P"
,bigbigbuddy,2011-10-18T23:57Z,"Okay so it must have been a virus, the installation failed and says it's missing a required file. I installed this on a different partition as my WinXP OS and I can't even access that. If you can find a fix where I can get all my files back that'd be great."
,Slammer94,2011-10-23T23:59Z,"Ok this is the first time I've ever had any real problem with one of your uploads. But when I try to install this it freezes at ""completing install"" or whatever that last step is. Using an alternate install method, it freezes at 74% of ""setup is installing devices"". Any ideas? I know this probably won't get answered on this torrent, so I'll probably send you a message at superbay... I'm sure this is a problem on my end because it works great for everyone else. "
,M4V88,2011-11-26T18:12Z,"Thankyou very much thethingy, I have used your torrents before, just to confirm THIS IS WORKING WITH NO PROBLEMS! :-) 

I have installed 64-professional. I simply used the Microsoft Store Windows 7 USB/DVD DOWNLOAD TOOL. Works great with DVDs and with USB keys for OS installs. You can find this here (TPB). This works with all updates with NO problems, all updates working, OEM serial key installed automatically, perfect. I am seeding this at full bandwidth allocation.

Turn Off AntiVirus/Anti-whatever when xcopying to the USB to avoid problems.
