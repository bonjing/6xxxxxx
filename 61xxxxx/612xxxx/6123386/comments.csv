Gamespot sucks, do you have your opinion or you need others to tell you what you like? "

Uh... 1.5 dude.  1-point-freakin-five.  I could understand you chiming in with a moral life lesson nobody wants to hear for something maybe a BIT higher... but not that.  It truly is the lowest damn score I've ever seen. It seems most of us don't have your fascinating ability to completely ignore the general opinions of society in favor of making uneducated decisions based on the information you somehow mystically acquire by yourself.  ...yes, mystically.  Like a little faerie.  Or someone with schizophrenia living in a cave.  Take your pick.  Meanwhile, the rest of us will, in certain situations, look to reviews written by other people (some of which are probably written by pissed-off, cave-dwelling magical fairies like yourself after they bought *insert shitty product here*).  So there you have it, guy.  Let those of us who are not fortunate enough to be born with your innate resistance to logic just make our intelligently-formed opinions based on research in peace.  Hopefully, we can co-exist.  Without you chiming in like a douchebag."

Actually the only uneducated fella in here is you, hiding behind a whole paragraph full of bullshit.
Please take a moment and read what and why have you written all of this stuff. Okay?
Congratulations! You fail at life more than the other commentors. Talking about basement dwellers. Irony.

Anyway to the rest and for great justice:
Gamespot is only a basic way to 'judge' a game. Your own experience is the one that will have the final say on the matter. Despite the 1.5, which makes people with no opinion to stay clear, I played the game and I really enjoyed it. And I'm gonna play it again. It's like those movies that only a few understand that they are diamonds in the rough. It's a bargain bin game for fuck's sake and it's a damn good one too. 
It totally worth a download, it's free so complaining about it is plain retarded.
G'day."
,PJHAIGHT,2011-06-24T22:55Z,"Hey guys. STFU. Okay, thanks. I had to get that out of the way! Thanks. I'm really interested in this game. But is there any way I can get this to work? It could have been me that was wrong, but i'm pretty sure the crack folder only contains the cracked EXE, not the starforce files as well. I'm no noob to this kind of thing. I know mounting games and getting them to work like the back of my hand! But this game has kinda frustrated me for the past day or two. I downloaded it, burned it and everything. Maybe there was an error with the unpacking, but idk. Any help or suggestions? They're appreciated.
