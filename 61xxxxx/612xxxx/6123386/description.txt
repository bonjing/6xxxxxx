You Are Empty is a first-person shooter which offers players an alternative
approach to the history of the late fifties of the XX century. Scene of 
action is the Soviet Union. Leading Soviet scientists start a big experiment
that alter human physiology and mentality in order to create super humans
capable of building bright future and communism all over the world. But 
something goes wrong. As a result the whole city, where that experiment took
place, goes on a rampage. The majority of citizens died, and those who 
survived turned into hideous mutants - the only inhabitants of deserted 
streets. You Are Empty immerses you in an exaggerated dark and obscure 
atmosphere of Soviet totalitarianism. Fighting against mutants, that 
obtained super power after the experiment was carried out, the main hero 
tries to gain an understanding of what's happening around and save the day.
