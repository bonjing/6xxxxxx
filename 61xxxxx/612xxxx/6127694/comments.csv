I've uploaded 2x now on superseed but I'll wait until there's at least 2x100%'ers.

Then I'll need to use my bandwidth to upload another part of reds history. "

,CyStefanos,2012-06-06T02:20Z,"Wow, talk about hd. This sure makes 720p enjoyable!

Video: 10  (Comes with 5 different files)
Audio: 11! (Includes 6 or 7 commencements). Also, the default is with no commentator, so it is easier to make projects on it!!

With that said, a big THANK YOU LFC_Seeds for your trully amazing torrent!"
