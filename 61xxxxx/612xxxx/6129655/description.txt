The Mark Steel Revolution:

The politically committed star of The Mark Steel Solution returned to radio with a new format for this series, in which each programme was presented as a lecture on the theme of a historical revolution. Inevitably, there were numerous comic moments, but Steel avoided knockabout treatment of the lecture format (of the kind used by Jeremy Hardy in Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation), frequently playing it entirely straight as he presented his own opinions on the French, Russian, industrial and sexual revolutions, plus the revolutionary consequences of the American Civil War and Darwin's theory of natural selection. In attempting to combine genuine historical comment and insight with sufficient humour to avoid alienating the audience, Steel set himself a difficult task, and it's to his credit that he just about pulled it off. Readings during the shows were delivered by Carla MendonÃ§a and Martin Hyder.

Mark Steel's In Town 


Mark Steel visits the less-famous bits of Britain and investigates the funniest moments in their history. 
He then performs a stand-up show to locals

Comedian Mark Steel visits different towns from across the UK and delves into their history, people and idiosyncrasies to try to work out what ingredients combine to make the place distinctive.

He creates a bespoke stand-up show for that community and then performs the show in front of a local audience in a celebration of the sort of places in Britain which are generally less visited as tourist attractions. Each has their own fascinating stories to tell with inhabitants who are passionate about what their home has to offer.

Amongst the topics Mark touched upon included the canals of Skipton, the concrete hippo in Walsall, and the Isle of Portland's strong dislike of a certain fluffy animal beginning with the letter "R".
