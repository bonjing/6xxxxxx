Plot or synopsis
"This is my revenge." Based on the award-winning novel by Minato Kanae, Confessions (a.k.a. Kokuhaku) is an emotionally devastating drama about a teacher's terrifying plan to avenge her daughter's murder. Writer-director Nakashima Tatsuya presents a strong indictment against modern Japanese society, portraying a dark inner world of modern Japanese youths without any mercy, exploring the horrific lengths one will go in the name of vengeance, fame, and friendship. With films like Memories of Matsuko under his belt, Nakashima is no stranger to telling dark stories with strong visual aesthetics. Seamlessly combining a pulsating soundtrack, slick editing, and powerful images, Confessions takes Nakashima's filmmaking skills to exciting new heights.
