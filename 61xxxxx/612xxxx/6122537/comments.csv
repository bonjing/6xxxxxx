A/10
V/9
Plot: A compelling drama that explores the different meanings of being a parent through the gritty, realistic lives of the struggling, blue-collar Porter's, and the privileged Campbell family. Their lives intersect, intertwine and collide, all for the love of a little boy. This film bravely exposes the humanity in each character reminding us that we each have the potential to be the best and worst versions of ourselves at any time.
Really Good movie too...
Many Thanx to TvTeam and QCF for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

If I had 1 SMALL criticism, it would be that this movie could have been provided with some of the foreign language audio tracks.  But thanks so much once again.  Keep up the great work.  I will seed this for a couple of weeks."
