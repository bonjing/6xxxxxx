,umim,2011-02-11T19:10Z,"Update: Everything is working now! This is what do you have to do...After installation, go to registry, find any  ""n-Track"" entry and change owner setting to YOU. After that, give yourself all ""rights"". Close registry, open keygen and use ""Offline Register"" option. That's all."
,Mukkasa,2011-03-23T18:22Z,"I cannot get this to work! I tried that registry thing but after 45 minutes of changing the owner settings to n- track registry entries I gave up and didn't succeed. I find it hard to believe somebody would have the time to do that to all the entires. 

Is there any other way? Patching the files don't seem to work. Offline register don't work though Im not sure how to do it. Anybody willing to share instructions?"
