PLOT:
A compelling drama that explores the different meanings of
being a parent through the gritty, realistic lives of the
struggling, blue-collar Porter's, and the privileged Campbell
family. Their lives intersect, intertwine and collide, all for
the love of a little boy. This film bravely exposes the
humanity in each character reminding us that we each have the
potential to be the best and worst versions of ourselves at
any time.
