,argusvidicon,2011-01-30T18:33Z,"I would like to discontinue my seeding, as it slows down my network and I have many other things to be involved in.  I will check this comments area to see if my exit becomes a problem.  At witch point I will re-seed this torrent to help someone.  What that means is that when I say Please Seed ! it means if you have 100% then you are now being very helpful if you would seed this torrent."
,DreamerFK,2011-02-05T03:07Z,I'll help seed this & thank you for simplifying the previous files..I've had a hell of a time converting them.
