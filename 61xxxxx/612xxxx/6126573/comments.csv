Video looks great but terrible audio.  

Using latest K-Lite Media codec and player, also tried VLC and the voices are weak and sound like it's on Hall mode.  2 different computers same audio.  Even tried downloading a new AAC codec.  

Stick to ""lame .mp3"" if you're not sure how to encode these."
