,shadowvex,2011-02-16T09:54Z,why the fuck are you recommending k-lite codec pack? this ain't 2005... *sigh*

,dvs_misfit,2011-02-19T07:56Z,"Awesome, thanks!
Worked like a charm.   :D"
,pietjeruk,2011-02-20T13:09Z,"@mc_homes bij 2011-02-17 04:14 CET: Because it gives too many conflicts. Don't use any codec pack and only use vlc, it plays nearly everything and it works always with the best quality because vlc uses its own codecs:)"

,zekaralho,2011-04-08T12:43Z,"....PWS-SPYEYE!ENV.A....This is a Trojan detection. Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate. They are spread manually, often under the premise that they are beneficial or wanted. The most common installation methods involve system or security exploitation, and unsuspecting users manually executing unknown programs. Distribution channels include e-mail, malicious or hacked Web pages, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), peer-to-peer networks, etc."
