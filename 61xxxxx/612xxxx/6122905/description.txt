     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Following a prank that went wrong, Sergeant Thomson takes a
      brief break from his day off to punish Gary and the boys by
      putting them on kitchen duty for the Captain's important dinner.
      Chef works hard to keep them under control while also trying to
      create a dinner good enough to impress Colonel Fanshaw, the
      Captain's father. But when an inebriated Thomson returns to
      wreak havoc in the kitchen, it's left to Gary to ensure that the
      dinner is a success and the Captain isn't embarrassed in front
      of 'Colonel Daddy'.
