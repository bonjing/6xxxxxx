I downloaded several copies of this movie and they all were encoded in such a way that the movie would cycle through a pixelized state while watching on a console dvd player and it made the movie unwatchable. I re-encoded the file using virtualdub and xvid codec for playing on console dvd players. 


After receiving mysterious empty packages inside his apartment, a young computer-programmer (named Simon) begins a personal investigation into their origins. This leads him to discover his odd and eccentric neighbors; an artificially intelligent robot-head, named Adam; a virtual-reality sex game; and a possible corporate conspiracy. As the story progresses, Simon's grip on reality becomes more and more tenuous, while his craving for Nature Fresh milk becomes almost unbearable. Is it all just in his mind, or is something more sinister happening here?
