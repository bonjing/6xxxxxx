,Unloved_Grudge,2011-02-23T18:46Z,"I'm having a bit of trouble. After installing the update and placing the crack, I can't play Stranger's Wrath. I click on Stranger.exe and a black screen comes up and nothing plays. I tried using the launcher, the load screen came up as did the sound of main menu, but the froze at the loading screen, but the sound kept playing. Help?"
