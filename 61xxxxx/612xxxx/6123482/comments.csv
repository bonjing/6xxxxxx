,mentallyours,2011-01-24T09:16Z,srry guys. game is not complete. cuts off at 2:53. i fucked up thought it was the whole game.
,1pirate1,2011-01-24T11:19Z,"thanks anyway!
do you have the rest? Is there any way you can make a smaller one that will be uploaded faster?"
,micklemack,2011-01-24T12:30Z,"Dood, this is like a bazillion megabyte.
That's like a heap!
Man if you could just make it 1gb or 2gb that would be so Gr8T

I think it's like 18gb, with my net speed it will be the superbowl, by the time I get it all."
,micklemack,2011-01-24T12:35Z,18GB will download for me after the superbowl is finished! Perhaps one of the seeders could re-encode around 1-2gb
,mentallyours,2011-01-24T12:47Z,"lol. dudes the big file sux so bad, wish i knew how 2 make it smaller. i aint got a clue. idont hav the rest of the game, used media center scheduled record and it didnt get the whole thing. "
