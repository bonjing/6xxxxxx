.: Plot :.

Neal Caffrey, a con-man, forger and thief, is captured after a three-year game of cat and mouse with the FBI. With three months left while serving a four-year sentence, he escapes from a maximum-security federal prison to find Kate, his ex-girlfriend. Peter Burke, the FBI agent who initially captured Caffrey, finds him at a dead end in his search and returns Caffrey to prison. This time, Caffrey gives Burke information about evidence in another case; however, this information comes with a price: Burke must have a meeting with Caffrey. At this meeting, Caffrey proposes a deal: he will help Burke catch other criminals as part of a work-release program. Burke agrees, after some hesitation. Through the successful apprehending of several white-collar criminals, Caffrey has proven to Burke that he will help him, and that he will not try to escape again. This begins an unconventional, but successful partnership.
