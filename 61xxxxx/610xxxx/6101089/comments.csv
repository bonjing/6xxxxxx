PS3"" as your rips ARE NOT AT ALL PS3 COMPATIBLE. This would prevent much wasted time and bandwidth. Thank you."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-30T16:18Z,whats not compatible about it?  i can't control cinavia protection and neither can anyone else.  there are workarounds on youtube that will make the video play on your ps3.  stop complaining.
