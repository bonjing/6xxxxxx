Thank you .. A LOT"
,DFigotin,2011-01-14T18:11Z,Thank you for your uploads HolyRoses. I was wondering if you could find it and do Hard Target (the Director's Cut) not the uncut or theatrical versions because those I found myself. I thought someone of your higher expertise would be able to find it and do a conversion to .mkv like the rest of your files. Thank you if you can. Thank you for just looking anyway.
,DFigotin,2011-01-14T18:12Z,oh and also the director's cut for Leon the Professional. Thanks.
,Relaxaler,2011-01-16T03:54Z,"Dear HolyRoses,

Could you tell me how to watch with subtitles on an iPod, iPhone or iPad?

Thanks."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-16T05:10Z,when the movie is playing there is a selector to allow you to choose subtitle.
