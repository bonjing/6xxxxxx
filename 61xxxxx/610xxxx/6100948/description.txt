Notes:
The 8th song, previously notated as "unknown instrumental" on Deadlists, is a cover of Freddy King's "Heads Up." The 9th tune, previously listed as "The Same Thing (instrumental)," is definitely NOT that song. Although it is a
standard blues and sounds similar at the beginning, closer listening makes it pretty obvious that it is an entirely different song, title unknown. The Viola Lee Blues on this expanded version is a different version than on the
previous three song version of Pico Acid Test. This is an ongoing mystery, although it should be said that both versions are worth having.
Total time: 74:04
