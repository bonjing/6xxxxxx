,jarilton,2011-01-17T15:44Z,"friend, I downloaded the entire season 2010 Ama motocross / supercross. But it was lacking the Rd 3 of Ama Motocross 450 2010 and Rd 1 Ama Motocross 250 2010. You have these videos? Thank you and congratulations!"
,slicknick610,2011-01-17T17:17Z,"@jarilton. The 2010 250 race is there. I called it lites instead of 250. Also the 450 High point race was posted by someone else. My local nbc station didnt show it. If you search ""high piont second moto"" you will find it."
