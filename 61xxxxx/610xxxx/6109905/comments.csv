2) Transfer the folder to the directory your backup manager uses (either Games, Gamez or some other)
2.a) PS3 doesn't digest NTFS, so you better use FTP transfer (install FileZilla on your PC and BlackBox FTP on the PS3)
2.b) If you have a nice and large external memory device with FAT32 file system, just copy it there, plug into your PS3 and use some kind of a file manager (MultiMan will do) to copy the game from usb to the folder your backup manager uses.

3) Launch your backup manager on PS3

4) Find your game in the list

5) Press LOAD.
5.1)Note that you sometimes need to have a legitimate blu ray inside the PS3

6) Exit to XMB

7) Launch the game that should be loaded by now and look like it's on the bluray you have inserted earlier.

8) Have fun!
8.1) If you have some crashes and hangups - don't panic. Pull of the cord from your PS3 and reinsert it. It happens every now and then, but it's totally fine."

Do you have an EBOOT for this version of ME2? I tried using the EBOOT for the NextLevel version, which is also EUR, but I can't seem to get it to work.

I'm using 3.41 and am running Gaia Manager 1.04, but no luck. Any suggestions?"
