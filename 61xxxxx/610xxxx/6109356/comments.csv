,AbAmerican,2011-04-20T17:47Z,"@ich23bines.
hmm pretty strange.  Had 42 emails who confirm the game works perfectly. Mustafa says it 2. Ive scanned 2 be sure again. No virus in every single torrent i uploaded!!

Next time.  Upload quality uploads urself before you start complaining about things you made up."

 If you rely on McAfee or Kaperski or whatever to decide what is legit software, then downloading pirated games is not for you. Most keygens ALL show up as a trojan. Never fails. I haven't downloaded this yet but im sure its legit. Nothing sound more idiotic than a person who doesnt know shit trying to diss on someone who does."
