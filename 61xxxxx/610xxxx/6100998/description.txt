This is just a plainly underrated record. True, it could have used a little less production (maybe that should take one star from the rating but...), but the songs are, for the most part, amazing. Tempest's voice is at its peak, and Marcello's fretwork is amazing. His blend of melody and shredding in the tasty, finely-honed solos is something not to miss for any guitar fan. I wonder how the record would have sounded, had Nevison (producer) given a rawer edge (and a little bit more space) to Marcello's guitar. The rest of the band sounds pretty tight...although drums are a bit dull at some moments (again, blame it on Nevison!). 
Being a long time fan (or "old" Europe and now of their new sound as well), I have to say that OOTW ranks among their best song-collection, if not the best. 
For those into 80's melodic hard rock, this is a must. For those not into the '80s sound, check out 2004 Start from the Dark and, soon, 2006 Secret Society.
