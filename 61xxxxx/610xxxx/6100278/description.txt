[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
Well I got the genuine 5.1 track so I wen't and grabbed IMAGiNE SCR of this and quickly noticed how blurry
it was, and a lot of noise/blocks. So I decided to use a advanced SeeSaw script to sharpen were it was blurry and used a advanced smoother script to smooth out the blocks and almost completely kill the noise. Also used a tad of rbg filter to even out the colors, make it more realistic. All in all it turned out pretty nice, almost can't tell there release from mine.. looks like different sources. 
Enjoy //iNK
