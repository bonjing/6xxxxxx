Jeonju Digital Project 2000-2008

Various languages all with English if needed and Korean subs. Almost all shot on DV therefore not IVTC'd, only de-interlaced.

Every year since the first Jeonju International Film Festival back in 2000, JIFF selects three filmmakers who are given 50 million KRW to create a thirty-minute digital movie. No restrictions are given to the topic or type of film to be made and many of the results have been outstanding. Now, gathered together for the first time, these 27 films from 2000-2008 have been made available in a 915 minutes, 9-disk set.
