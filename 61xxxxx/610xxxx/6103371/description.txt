formula where a son is separated from his father in childhood. But for a pleasant 

change, the father and son do not have to wait till the climax and rather reunite 

within the first 15 minutes of the film. After that they remain together in almost 

every other frame of the film and (joined by the younger son) share great combined 

chemistry. you guys going to enjoy this movie Alot
