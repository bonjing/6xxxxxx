Elephant on the Run
Park Ranger Tasha has a very important job for delivery agents Tyrone and Pablo (who never fail to deliver a package) -- to get an endangered Indian elephant safely to the Wildlife Sanctuary and to avoid the bad guys (Uniqua and her henchman Austin). Really cute episode with great new songs as the two teams race across the savannah to see who will end up with the elephant.

The Magic Skateboard
Tyrone really wants to be a great skateboarder. He may not know all the tricks yet, but once he finds the magic skateboard, he's going to compete in the Show-Off Showdown.

The Flipper
Uniqua, Tasha and Pablo are the Meteor Watch Squad. But when meteor-obsessed Pablo accidentally spills toxic space goo all over himself, he becomes the super strong, super excitable Flipper!

Super Team Awesome
Tyrone is a tour guide for the world's only lava geyser, Old Gushie. When a loose boulder in the cavern threatens to cause a geothermal disaster, Tyrone calls for help. Not one, but three superheroes come to save the day!
