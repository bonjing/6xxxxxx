,Mr_Gamer,2011-01-20T12:15Z,"Damn. Where is the 550mb Hi-Def TV-Rip from ""DIMENSION""? Yeah, 175mb is watchable, but come on! 

We live in 2011 now, we have broadband and hi-def monitors! We also have the disk-space.

Plus, *.AVI is so outdated, *.MKV is the way to go!

You can have an AVI and an MKV of equal size, but MKV is at least doubble the quality.

I know it's an encapsulation format, but the dudes that code their movies in MKV know what they are doing. 

Yes, there are crappy MKV, but I generally regard it as supperior. If it's crappy, it's the guy that coded it."
,Distortion311,2011-01-27T07:33Z,"For real _gamer.  Not to mention, it's an animated series, and standard definition is WELL more than enough to enjoy the show.  There's been sooo much whining lately by lazy people who've probably never uploaded anything and I bet they never seed.  

It's sad because I can tell it has to be americans. Only we could feel so entitled as to bitch about free stuff.  "

STFU JACKASS. No one gives a fuck if you  
""generally regard it as supperior"". DOUCHE. 

You can't watch MKVs on almost any kind of external player. So you're stuck in front of the computer. 

Keep your worthless opinions to yourself. "
,jackylol,2011-03-29T02:09Z,".avi only works with external drives, but .mkv is the best format, still,
i think .avi is the way to go
    -faster to download
    -and don't need that codec shit"
,mrtetris88,2011-04-16T10:25Z,"i must agree with everyone here,
