Drinking, gambling, sinning, and dying are not only the subjects of Dirty With the Blues, but are the life of Sleepy Eyes Nelson. Ever the recluse, Sleepy recorded the tracks compiled in the album in the hills of Scotland all alone. In the hills of Europe the tapes sat for years until Sleepy's brohter, JB heard them and realized the potential for the music. After a brief release on his own label, JB convinced Sleepy to permit a wider release for the album. Now, the debut LP, Dirty With the Blues by Sleepy Eyes Nelson has escaped the Scottish hills and is quickly gaining recognition as an Americana gem.
