,gofreemovies,2011-03-20T20:35Z,Whenever I enter one of the serial code numbers I get an error message less than a minute later informing me that I am using a bad serial number and that the program can no longer continue running. Does anyone have anyway around this?
,heatgirl,2011-03-31T08:50Z,Yup happened to me too...I tried all the serials and within a minute it reverted back to trial version....
,ffercs,2011-05-16T02:40Z,Here's how to get this to work with the included serials.  Set up an outbound rule in your firewall program or router to block TCP port 80 to 182.50.129.65.  That will disable the license check and the program will work.
