     I am sorry, you must think i am barraging with requests. But i just want you to consider one more very good movie to encode.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216496/

Yesterday only its bluray has been uploaded. If you think its worth encoding then plz do it. If you don't, its absolutely fine. Just wanted to bring to light a good title. Thats it. (Just in case-480p preferred). :)"
,DMVIN,2011-01-16T21:33Z,"Thanks.

Will you be doing the Golden Globes?"
,froglog,2011-01-16T22:14Z,"Thank you for Human remains.

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-17T11:00Z,"@dark_defender: Strange. This movie was released while ago and I remember how I decided not to get BluRay back then. Now I'll get one.

@DMVIN: Yes, I will, because 1400 MB is too big for most of the people. However, as I said million times, extremely small-sized H264 does not like these type of events. quality is always compromised, but size is really small. This encode would be 400 MB as [352p.quark].

@skillet92: I've done it three times (TS, SCR and DVDrip). No plans to re-encode it."
,muk0690,2011-01-17T12:38Z,"@twentyforty: Can you please do the red riding trilogy?

All three were released in 2009."
