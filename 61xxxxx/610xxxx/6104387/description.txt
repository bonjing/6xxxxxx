PGWare PCBoost 4.1.10.2011e 

PCBoost allows you to run programs such as games, video editing software and any software that requires large amounts of processing power to run much faster than the software was originally designed for. With little to no effort you can easily make programs & games run faster on your computer without having to purchase a new computer. Most programs are designed to use a minimal amount of CPU (processor) power which often leads to the CPU being idle and not used to its fullest potential, with PCBoost your computer is able to take advantage of this by allocating more CPU power to the currently active application.

PCBoost automatically takes care of allocating more processing power to applications without you having to lift a single finger. Our software runs in the background and automatically monitors which application becomes the foreground active program, it then raises the CPU priority for this application and also assigns the application to run on a processor core that has more power available to it, this instructs the processor that this application must be taken care of before any other application and allowing it to run faster.

Take control of your computer's processor by installing PCBoost and give your games and applications access to your computer's full hardware potential while doing no harm to the computer in any way. PCBoost does not over-clock or harm the processor, nor does it increase the thermal temperatures or stress on the processor, it simply instructs the processor to give the active application the highest priority and access to specific processor cores.
