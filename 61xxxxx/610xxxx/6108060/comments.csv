,Rivven,2011-01-17T20:32Z,"The A/V is close to the best a CAM can possibly get, only a few notches under a DVDrip in my opinion. 

The movie itself was great, it didnt get super good reviews though, cause most of the people that write the reviews have a stick or two up their ass anyways.

Long story short, movie starts abit slow, but after about midway through it gets pretty fucking awesome. They better make a sequel.

'nuff said."

,chedderz66,2011-01-17T22:01Z,One of the best quality TS I've seen...However this movie sucks big time. Seth Rogen was a terrible choice to play the Green Hornet. It's hard to take him seriously with all of the sophomoric humor and cheesy cliches. Annoying as fuck! One of the worst movies I've seen lately and Hollywood keeps churning these turds out so you know it's pretty bad. I am thankful to the uploaders anyway cause at least I'm not paying for this garbage.

Times are changing, so is the movie industry.

,KickassWashingMachine,2011-01-27T19:33Z,"Great, thanks. Really impressive quality for a TS. Good colours, fairly sharp and very little crop and practically no distortion due to bad angle. Also none of the autofocus shit that usually plagues TSes.

Audio in perfect sync throughout, nice stereo, voices very audible.

@wwtw25: It's a comedy man, you're not supposed to be taking Seth Rogen serious :)"
,sdujay,2011-01-28T08:56Z,Can you make one with mp4 container? H.264
,charlie.harper,2011-01-28T10:56Z,"First off...Thanks for the DL. This has to be about ther best TS I have ever seen. So lets do the e-val on this one.... Everyone will probable compare this to original TV Green Hornet with Van Williams and Bruce Lee. For those of you that don''t know there was also a Green Hornet radio show. The Van Williams character was smart and sophisticated And the Seth Rogan character Was a stumbling Moronic nimcompoop. But hey, that is Seth Regen. Basically what Christian Bale did for the Batman Character, Seth Rogen failed to do the same for the Green Hornet Character. Jay Chou did a good job playing Kato. 

This one shouldn't take too much time to find it in the discount ben at walmart.

Once again. Thanks for the DL. Now I am really glade that I didn't pay big bucks to see it in the Theater."

 It is what it's supposed to be, nothing more or less, and the quality doesn't really even detract anything from the movie itself.

 Great upload, thx."
