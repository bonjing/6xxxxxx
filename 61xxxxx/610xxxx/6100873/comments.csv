,AnWa06,2011-01-14T02:32Z,I'm not sure what method F14Tomkat is using but anyone who plans on uploading carenado planes in the future should use the following method...run the installer and direct the install to a temp folder on your desktop...you might have to copy and paste the fsx.exe into the temp folder for some installs to work properly...all of the necessary files will be in that temp folder...Then upload the plane...it was the same story with the first few uploads of the V35B when it came out.
,jager963,2011-01-14T02:45Z,Yep this still isn't right...tons of textures missing bud. I sure hope caranado arnt getting clever.
,AnWa06,2011-01-14T02:58Z,Hopefully F14Tomkat will read the directions above otherwise I'm sure someone else will upload the plane within the next few days...the folks at Carenado still just don't understand that their planes aren't made out of gold and that $40 is a lot to pay for a piece of software that has a shit load of problems...
,hitchup,2011-01-14T07:59Z,upload the .exe (only)
,noneofyourbusiness1981,2011-01-14T08:35Z,yea if you upload the .exe then someone can have a go at cracking it!
,xorxor,2011-01-14T15:35Z,"F14Tomkat, use (for example) sandboxie to make a RIP + Windows Registry Recovery to open reghive.dat which contains registry entries."
,TestBuy,2011-01-14T15:48Z,"I think F14 is Carenado.
thats why even parts of this ""checkItOut""-Version  are missing."
,rolfi11,2011-01-14T16:03Z,@F14Tomkat: it would be nice if you upload the original installer without your reg datas. should be the easiest way to share this beauty with all.
,noneofyourbusiness1981,2011-01-14T18:50Z,"that statement about him actually being carenado could be right, who uploaded the bonanza's which wern't working"
,rolfi11,2011-01-14T19:21Z,"just my thought now ;) pants off F14Tomkat, muahaha"
,rapterman,2011-01-14T20:12Z,can some one just upload the exe file for this aircraft please
,jager963,2011-01-14T21:57Z,Yep I checked his torrents and he was the one who uploaded the v35 bonanza that didnt work originally. could it be caranado? 
,xorxor,2011-01-14T23:07Z,Maybe he is building IP database :D
,AnWa06,2011-01-16T05:31Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD FROM F14!!!! He is apart of the Carenado group!
,godfitzham7,2011-01-16T19:09Z,"@ AnWa06. 

You may be right with that commentAnWa06. Ever notice that after the upload, F14 never responds to various comments nor requests !! Hmmmm...!!! Interesting."
,juanjomtzp,2011-01-17T06:17Z,"HI FOLKS!!!! THIS IS THE SOLUTION!!!!!! IÂ´M PROUD TO GIVE IT...!

I got warmed!!! after this awesome release of the Cessna C340II so I decided to buy it!!!!! $34.95 bucks spent...!!! what a really AWESOME aircraft 100% recommended is a ""MUST HAVE"" in the hangar !!! really!!!!! is amazing!!!!

Obviously and IÂ´m sorry (I wont upload my exe and even my pass and code and missing texures...) do not insist!!!!!!!!!! 34.95 bucks...is 34.95!! ok?

Before I bought it, I decided to download this ""Cessna C340II Complete"" package 
AND YES!! I CAN CONFIRM THAT F14Tomkat is or was former of the Carenado Group, AND IF NOT...then heÂ´s just uploading the planes at a 50%...

I CAN CONFIRM THIS: LISTEN!!!!! A T E N T I O N
this package (RIP) is missing some textures files in the texture.xxx folders!!! and they are a little bit scrambled...and ALSOOO is missing one texture.xxx! where the xxx means a name of a texture variant... for example like ""red"" or ""VIP""

This is like a ""check it out"" or like a ""preview"" of the original that is missing some folders to have it incomplete...!

anyway, so folks! take it easy! you have 2 options, buy it as me, or wait until someone upload the missing textures that IÂ´m saying

@TestBuy youÂ´re right!! itÂ´s or was a member of Carenado Group!!!
@rolfi11: IÂ´m like you said I WONÂ´T DO TI!! :)

@rolfi11: haha YEAHH!!! pants off F14Tomkat
@jager963: it is!!! all this I wrote is the real solution
@AnWa06: of course is or was a member of Carenado
@godfitzham7: thatÂ´s it..!

Thanks to all of you, now thank me! I gave you the real solution!! ;)"
,rolfi11,2011-01-17T14:09Z,"@juanjomtzp: seems you are another endorser from carenado. nice advertising but useless, lol.
the c340 is already released on several forums and be sure, it will appears here soon."
,jager963,2011-01-17T15:59Z,"I'm always pleased when somone buys the real deal, If no one did then they wouldn't make it in the first place. However, Im a patient man and am quite happy to wait a week or two to get it on here or one of the many other forums these things are posted on....ps to juanjomtzp. You might wanna spend your money in future on English lessons."
,Jimstalk,2011-01-17T16:06Z,"@rolfi11

Already released in the web for free??THEN GIVE US THE LINK"
,juanjomtzp,2011-01-17T20:11Z,"@jager963 @rolfi11
my dear first of all I'm not going to start a fight but I will not stay silent ... IÂ´m not another endorser from Carenado!!! haha cÂ´mon man who you are to say that??? IÂ´m a student pilot who has bought their product!! for continue the training with twin props plane! and I need it! so I canÂ´t stay waiting two or three weeks and even a month!! ;) simply as that..! nothing to say END!
Then you can stay waiting even a year! because youÂ´re just a flight simmer ;) and IÂ´m a pilot so nothing to say! ;)

and it is not useless because nobody on here has bought the plane! ok? and there was no way for you to know this if anyone would have told you! I did the favor! and nobody did anything

Si lo entendiste bien o te lo vuelvo a explicar nuevamente? porque hay tanta gente inepta que no entiende y no sabe ni el mÃ­nimo de otro idioma entonces que hay que repetirles las cosas 8 veces!

DID YOU UNDERSTAND ME? OF COURSE NOT!!! THEN YOU NEED SPANISH LESSONS ;) 
GOOD LUCK! ;)

P.S. Happy 2011! ;)"
,noneofyourbusiness1981,2011-01-17T20:22Z,"@ juanjomtzp

You are actually carenado aswell. I have experience in textures and I can hand on heart say that the upload contains all required texture files needed. Nor are and textures Scrambled. It is simply a case of a model or gauge which hasn't been encluded or has been tampered with to make us see what we are seeing. 

FAIL FAIL FAIL ""juanjomtzp"" complete and utter FAIL... you have also proved to us you are carenado too

The .exe is still required guys... it will only be a matter of time until it leaks onto TPB from the Warez forums. Good acheivment carenado, can't wait for it to uploaded here"

,AnWa06,2011-01-17T21:25Z,it's obvious that there are some folks from carenado snooping around here so here's what i have to say...FUCK YOU! do you really expect us to pay money for your aircraft when they all have the same problems over and over again!?! you make half assed planes and then charge 35 bux for them and you wonder why people refuse to buy them and download them from torrents instead. maybe once you guys stop taking advantage of your customers and start creating planes that don't have fuckin issues we will consider buying them...but until then we will continue to download them for free!
,rolfi11,2011-01-17T21:28Z,"@ juanjomtzp: no further comment, dude.
you can't stop the release of this beauty, whether you have bought or not"
,jager963,2011-01-17T21:45Z,"jaun, if this were a spanish forum then i could see your point but it isnt it's an english written  one so it's the required language. do you see me in your spanish forums? no. Secondly as i said i love it when somone buys a product but don,t get all holier than thou just cause you bought somthing you needed. you wouldn,t be in here if you wern,t in here regulerly downloading everything you could lay your hands just like the rest of us. so take off the halo man your no different from anyone else."
,mOuse_X,2011-01-17T21:57Z,"@Hitchup: I 've never doubted you !

@F14 & juan:
Stay in your Carenado place to realise good 3D planes. Lose no time in making false, we're already interested in this production and we'll get here one day or another :)"
,jager963,2011-01-17T22:14Z,@hitchup   So you have it hey....will you be doing your magic on it? And did i tell you how much we all like you..grovel grovel:)
,hitchup,2011-01-17T22:19Z,for 10 min. in internet I find it......freeeeee:-))))
