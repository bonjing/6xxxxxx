Product: Star Wars: Battlefront
Platform: PC
Developer: Pandemic Studios
Publisher: LucasArts Entertainment



Game Description: I also like multiplayer gaming, so when they announced Star Wars Battlefront for the PC, I was more than a little excited. The idea of playing as Storm Troopers and Rebels was getting me all tingly inside. Since the game spanned every movie yet released, it also would give me the chance to put blaster bolts into some Gungans as well, and if that isn't enough to at least get you interested in this title then I don't think we can be friends anymore.

Of course, if you follow my reviews you'll also know that this was a bittersweet play just because it's yet another multiplayer frag fest with vehicles. Battlefield really has a lot to answer for, and the main pre-release criticism of this game was that it could have been nothing more than a total conversion of Battlefield with Star Wars skins and vehicles. There was a certain amount of nervousness on the part of the video gaming public when viewing this project. So much could go wrong, and yet so much could go right. If the force was not with Pandemic Studios and LucasArts, this title wouldn't be worth the money.

Let's get one other thing out of the way first, there are no playable Jedi characters, so there will be no way for you to wield a light saber in this game. That would have bothered me more if I hadn't spent the last month in heavy meditation before building my own.
