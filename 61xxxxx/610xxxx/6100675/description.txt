Babylon By Bus is a live album released by Bob Marley & The Wailers in 1978. The album was recorded mostly at the Pavillon de Paris in June 1978, during the Kaya Tour. Like the 1973 album Catch A Fire, the first release had something of a novelty cover. The windows of the bus on the front cover were cut out, revealing part of the inner sleeve. As this was a double album, the listener had a choice of four different scenes to view through the windows.

Bob Marley's second live album, 1978's Babylon by Bus, had to be pretty damned good to match the incandescence of 1975's Live!. But with glorious performances on songs like "Punky Reggae Party," "Jamming," and "Is This Love?" Bob Marley and the Wailers came close to equaling Live!. Maybe there wasn't quite the same amount of inspiration, but the Wailers had matured into a tight unit, and Marley was a charismatic performer, as this set captured only too well. And with Marley still at the height of his writing powers, there definitely wasn't a dud song in the bunch. Not so much bus travel as limousine listening, this specially remastered edition makes the glory of the original release even clearer. --Chris Nickson
