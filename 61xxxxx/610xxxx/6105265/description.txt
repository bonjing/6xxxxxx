   Kaalo is based on the story of a Rajasthani  
   folktale about a witch named Kaalo, who was  
   killed and buried by angry villagers of      
   Kaligarh 600 years ago. Villagers believe    
   Kaalo's ghost looms over Kaligarh village.   
   The village has been deserted because the    
   villagers feared that Kaalo's ghost may      
   return to take revenge. In the film the      
   witch targets Young Sweeny's character and   
   is thirsting for her blood.
