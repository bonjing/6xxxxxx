,SeberHusky,2011-02-02T20:11Z,"On the ""Holmes Inspection"" series part of this torrent, the quality is pretty shitty.  The video is foggy, and the audio is a bit scratchy/tinny sounding.

It is watchable though.

The New Orleans series is nice and clear. 

I have not gotten to the ""Holmes On Homes"" part of this torrent yet."
,SeberHusky,2011-02-09T02:36Z,"The ""Holmes On Holmes"" is okay condition.  Is watchable on a TV screen.  The video is a bit grainy in Season 1, but I think that's just because it was filmed with 2001 technology.

Also, for Seasons 1 and 2 so far, the episodes are named in backwards order. I cross-checked with Wikipedia, and that's how I found that out."
