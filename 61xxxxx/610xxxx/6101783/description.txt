JOHNNY COPELAND TEXAS TWISTER
[b]Label Rounder Select
Orig Year 1983
Format:Flac


This is an excellent sampler of Texas bluesman Johnny Copeland's tenure at Rounder Records. Drawn from Copeland's first four Rounder releases, the material is, for the most part, straightforward electric blues, showcasing Copeland's passionate, raw-throated vocals and prodigious talents as an axe-slinger. On all of these sessions, Copeland is backed by an energetic band, with lots of horns adding fat, brash punctuation. Special guests also dot the personnel list, including avant-garde jazz saxophonist Arthur Blythe, who plays a solo on "Copeland Special," and fellow Texas guitar legend Stevie Ray Vaughan, who has a blistering spot on "Don't Stop By the Creek, Son."

In addition to fine servings of traditional down-home blues from Copeland's initial three Rounder releases, all of which showcase his stinging, superbly executed leads, Texas Twister includes three cuts from Bringinâ€™ It All Back Hom, an album Copeland recorded in Africa. Unlike anything else recorded in the blues idiom, these tracks superimpose blues licks from the American South over a rich web of African percussion and Afro-pop textures. These tracks offer a pleasant and intriguing contrast to the more conventional blues fare featured, and suggest that Copeland had a flair for experimentation in addition to his mastery of traditional electric blues.
