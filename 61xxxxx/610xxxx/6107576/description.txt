This is a compilation of Crue demos (4 discs total) from the early Stick/Toast single years through the Vince Neil cover of "I Fought The Law". I upped them a few years ago (as mp3 files) and have decided to upload them again for anyone that had never heard some of these (mostly) amazing tracks. Each disc has it's own cover which I'm uploading for the first time (I'm pretty sure I didn't upload them last time), created by me when I made the collection. I'll also be uploading the Brides of Destruction "Here Come the Brides" demos and the 1958 demos soon, along with another Crue compilation I made around the same time as S.A.TD. called Live Shit (also 4 discs). Open the cover in a new tab/browser to get a better view. Enjoy and please seed!
