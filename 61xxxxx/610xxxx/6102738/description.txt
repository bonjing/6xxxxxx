This is Pink Floyds full studio discography.  This DOES NOT include Pulse or any other live stuff except for disc 2 of Ummagumma.  This is all ripped by me, at VBR high bitrate (averaging 300kb).  Everything is properly tagged.  Also, all the artwork is included, none of the bogus crap that is out here.  

Here are the discs:

1967 - The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn
1968 - A Saucerful Of Secrets
1969 - Soundtrack From The Film "More"
