SON SEALS LETTINâ€™ GO
[b]Original Release Date: April 25, 2000 
Label: Telarc
Format:Flac



When Son Seals' self-titled debut was released in 1973, his tutelage under blues greats like Sonny Boy Williamson and Albert King gave way to an identity as a new master of modern electric blues. Seals's maiden 21st-century release, Lettin' Go, once again encapsulates all the things that have cemented that identity for an international following: painfully jagged guitar riffs, uncompromising, emotional vocals, and chops cut on a lifetime of jook joints and hard livin'. The record represents something of a departure for this notorious traditionalist. An acoustic guitar opens the record, which in Seals's repertoire is a rare sound indeed. Tracks like "Blues Holy Ghost" incorporate gospel stylings and sentiments. There's even a more-or-less straight-up rock track here, "Osceola Rock," and a guest appearance from Trey Anastasio from the rock band Phish. Still, when you hear Seals going to work on dirty, soulful workouts like "Bad Blood," there's no doubt where this man's true talents lie.
