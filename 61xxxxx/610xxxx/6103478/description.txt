This is really a great concert. With a running time of over 2,5 hours this is a complete \'Born to Rock\' concert. It\'s an audience recording taped from the side balcony. The picture quality isn\'t too great but you can see everything. The audio is much better and good for it\'s time. The show has a Happy Birthday performance for Patti Russo and a neverending version of Paradise by the Dashboard Light. This is just major fun. Recorded at May 20th, 1996. Enjoy this great concert!
