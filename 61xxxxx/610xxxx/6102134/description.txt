Show Summary: A comedy series. Based on the #1 Twitter skein and best-selling 
book, $#*! MY DAD SAYS features the caustic musings of Ed, a retired military 
doctor whose cranky one-liners have left him, at 72, with three ex-wives and a lot of time alone in his garden. With two boys, Ed has a soft spot for younger son Henry, a likable slacker whoâ€™s out of work. Unable to pay his rent, Henry takes up his dadâ€™s offer to move home, agreeing to follow house rules. But Ed has a secret planâ€” a second chance to be the father he never wasâ€” if it doesnâ€™t kill them both first.
