A truly hilarious show that seems to have been forgotten in the annuls of time. When I went looking to collect this I had one hell of a time finding it anywhere, to buy or download. I managed to find all the episodes from various torrents around the net and compiled them into this collection.

I never understood why this wasn't more popular. It is funny as hell and lasted 8 seasons, but no one is pining for it to come back. Who knows, maybe having a complete collection available will introduce some new people, and maybe even rekindle interest for this lost treasure.

Season One - You may want to skip this. You miss little of signifigance and it looks as low budget as you can get (think south park season one)

Quality - These are the only versions I could find. Most of them are about TV quality, but one episode is particularily bad. I included it for completions sake (also I forgot which one it is). If you have a better version and wish to upload it I will update this torrent

Aside - Every person who comments "plz seed" or any variation of that message, is a total fucking idiot too stupid to understand that not a single person has ever, or will ever, seed because of a comment to do so. People who have the means, file and inclination will seed, and those that don't, don't.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy Kevin Spencer as much as I.
