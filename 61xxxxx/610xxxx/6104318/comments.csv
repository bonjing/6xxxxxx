,bettienoir,2011-01-17T20:32Z,doesn't appear to work - windows isnt recognizing the files being there and dvdshrink is finding nothing either.

I had same problem, my media players did not like the long label on the download. Suggest you re-name as ""Bruce Springsteen - The Promise"" & delete the rest of the label & hopefully it should then work.

rename all the folders to something shorter & simpler, except for ""video ts"". then it burns fine, thanks."
