,piggypab,2011-01-17T23:06Z,Unable to watch with vlc. Does anyone else have this problem?
,aratron_x,2011-03-11T02:37Z,I had the same problem as piggypab.  It won't play properly on ANY media player I have because it is too high resolution and the AVC codec requires a powerful graphics card.  THE SOLUTION: Get a new video card with at least 64mb vram (you probably didn't want to hear that.) It played fine after I upgraded and installed correct driver with Jockey under Ubuntu.  I recommend using XVID not AVC.
