,Doomer D. Great,2011-03-11T11:12Z,You have done a very good job. But I have to admit that what you might consider a tweak might actually be a very obnoxious headache for others. Never upload modified OS distributions. Keep the as Vanilla as possible. Keep up the excellent work.
,Murdermaru321,2011-04-04T07:51Z,"I would like to personally thank you for this free version of windows 7 ultimate. Also, i think that your personal editing of the program gives it a unique feel that separates it from the initial version. 

All the people who ungratefully critiqued your contribution are worthless and shouldn't be allowed to download anything for free.... if you have something bad to say about someone who is giving you something for free, then just buy the program and shut your rude mouth. "
