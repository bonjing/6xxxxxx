NOTE: Post installer is automatic in this build due to noobs asking how to start it again when they restart before it is finished.
If you don't want a particular app, just uninstall it.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT RESTART WHEN YOU SEE THE "PREPARING YOUR DESKTOP" AT THE FIRST OFFICIAL START UP - THE POST INSTALLER IS FIRING
UP. 

You DO NOT have to run the .net 4 framework at the end of the post installer. If you want to get it done and have about 20-30 minutes to spare,
let it install. If not, just close it when it pops up.
