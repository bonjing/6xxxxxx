,ragman420,2011-01-19T04:07Z,I got a 1.76 GB Sound Bank file from another GP6 torrent. This one says RSE2 and it's 1.07 GB.  Does anyone know if this is a supplement Sound Bank? 
,jackyc123,2011-01-19T21:41Z,"Thanks! Will seed, are you sure this is all the sound banks though cause it doesnt seem to have many bass or drum stuff on there"
,dave1sfx,2011-01-20T00:14Z,"@ragman420
This one is only 1.07GB because I compressed it with WinRAR.  The original is around 1.76GB."
,ragman420,2011-01-20T04:02Z,"Ok, thanks dave1sfx.  It must be the one I have.  Good upload though since the only working GP6 on here didn't have the sound bank."
