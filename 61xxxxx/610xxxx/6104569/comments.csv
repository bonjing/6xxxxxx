,Dragonite_9,2011-02-25T15:26Z,"THANKS YOU!

Ad PLEASE upload the rest from the (unoffical/torrent) ""Immortal"" collection,
 especially Xscape, so damn great.

Would appreciat that SO SO MUCH!!
Thank you in advance!!"
,svennyjacko,2011-04-02T11:03Z,"@Dragonite_9 the so called Immortal collection which consists out of FLAC files is not what it looks like...those files can't have a losless quality because most of those tracks are never leaked as FLAC files, only as mp3's and the 5 tracks in this torrent are the recent leaked ones"
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-03T01:35Z,"Thanks, but yes I do understand they are made up/converted to flac from lower bitrate sources, since on very high volume it cracks in the speakers (=def. no flac) but I can not find these in .mp3, and convert back to .mp3 would just mess upp the cracking even more I belive? (Dont know how to do that either so..)

So please if anyone got those, or just Xscape at least, please upload them, or let me know where to find them! Thank you in advance!"
