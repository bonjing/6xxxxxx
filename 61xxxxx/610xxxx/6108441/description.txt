PLOT
Nina (Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life,
like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She
lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica (Hershey) who exerts
a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy
(Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Ryder) for the
opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first
choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses
Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan
with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and
sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the
personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their
rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with
her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.
