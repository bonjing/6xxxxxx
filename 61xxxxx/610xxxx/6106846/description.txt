Kelby Training Wedding Photography â€“ How to Photograph Beautiful Shooting
Kelby Training Wedding Photography - Shooting Around the Clock

If you want to improve your digital photography skills, you may want to take a look at this. This video package comes with step-by-step instructions on how to take pictures of beautiful landscapes, people, nature, fireworks, night scenes, etc. Learn how to shoot professional photos - just like those you see in glossy magazine wedding covers.

Wedding photographers do not get to pick the shooting schedule on the day of the wedding, which means they may be shooting portraits at odd times, when lighting conditions are not at their best. In this course, Cliff Mautner shows viewers some tips and tricks for creating consistent, quality wedding images regardless of the lighting conditions. He starts with early morning light, tackles the bright sun of high noon, and races the falling sun of dusk. This course is designed to help photographers take anytime light and make good light out of it.
