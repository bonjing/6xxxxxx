This is not a hits collection. Instead, it's a neo-two-fer, containing ten songs written by Bacharach and David, and ten written by Goffin & King. This, of course, contains some big hits and signature songs -- "Wishin' and Hopin',"
"Anyone Who Had a Heart," "That Old Sweet Roll (Hi De Ho)" -- but it's not really a compilation for the casual listener; it's for those who love Dusty and like to hear some of her best material in a different context. This context happens to make a lot of sense, and the end result is very enjoyable, but it may not be necessary for most listeners.
