Where you can express such an ignorant and selfish opinion without being shot in the head in front of your family. I'm not over-reacting, I am just very offended by you and am saddened that you aren't aware of the world you live in. I don't comment like this normally, but it's my duty inform you of how unrealistic your thoughts are. The life you are allowed to live is a gift. It is not owed to you, you owe our fathers for it. By saying what you have said, you have shit on our fathers and the sacrifices they made for us. Nothing I say will get through to you because you can't possibly understand.(this you have demonstrated) Yet it doesn't stop me. Maybe if you ingrates spent some of your life else where you will learn some things. If you can't appreciate our gifts you shouldn't be allowed to participate. Go live with the Arabs ingrates.

,maggotrape,2011-04-22T00:38Z,"OK MONKEYCUNT, I have to speak up now. First of all, The economy. America has until quite recently maintained the LARGEST economy in the world. It took a massive recession to place our economy lower than the EU, which I may add, only has the worlds largest economy because of the fact that all of Europe's piss ant little nations had to join together to come up with a universal currency that could compete with the dollar. Till then, Most of your countries currency was SHIT. When you limey fuckers say things like this it makes me wish our grandparents had let Adolph Hitler SCRAPE YOU Toothless BITCHES OFF OF THE FUCKING GLOBE! Have some fucking respect. Know your place and know your betters. As for your Queen. She is a figurehead and has no power whatsoever and everyone, Limey, Aussie, American and so on knows this. Not to mention she is a hideous fucking crone. As to the Swiss ""inventing the internet"" (you simple fucking fool) (as my American Brother pointed out ""the same technology you are using to bash America while you pirate American cinema, the truth is, the Internet and Transmission Control Protocols were initially developed in 1973 by American computer scientist Vinton Cerf as part of a project sponsored by the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and directed by American engineer Robert Kahn. I could even go on to say, the Internet began as a computer network of ARPA (ARPAnet) that linked computer networks at several universities and research laboratories in the United States. Yes THE FUCKING UNITED STATES! Moron. Next, I think what you were referring to is the ""www"" was invented by by English computer scientist Timothy Berners-Lee for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). That's right a LIMEY in SWITZERLAND! perfect example for my next point which is your country has contributed nothing of value to the world with the exception of this, since the fucking dark ages."

,maggotrape,2011-05-02T01:08Z,"Oh god damn! Look. Again @ monkeycunt. First off, the earliest attempts at airbreathing jet engines were hybrid designs in which an external power source first compressed air, which was then mixed with fuel and burned for jet thrust. In one such system, called a thermojet by Secondo Campini but more commonly, motorjet, the air was compressed by a fan driven by a conventional piston engine. Secondo Campini was an Italian engineer. NOT A LIMEY! The first gas turbine to successfully run self-sustaining was built in 1903 by Norwegian engineer Ã†gidius Elling. Once again you spout about that which you do not know. Second, I am assuming you are referring to Charles Babbage when you credit Brits for the computer, which while he is one of the ONLY Brits I can honestly say I admire, I fear that alas, you are once again, dead wrong. If you read anything, ever, try and find something on the subject. He was responsible for the invention of a series of MECHANICAL computing devices ( the difference engine and the Analytical engine) but only in CONCEPT! He never built them! he had no business sense or conviction and couldn't keep focus. I won't go into him too much but just know that once again you are WRONG. "
,maggotrape,2011-05-02T01:25Z,"Ok, Third point. Robert Boyle discovered hydrogen, who is an IRISHMAN! Which, I suppose, you count as one of your own, now that you are done killing them. One can only assume that who you are once again, so ignorantly referring to, is Edward Daniel Clarke who, wait for it..... IS ACTUALLY A LIMEY this time! What you aren't considering however, is that the 1819 invention on the fucking BLOWPIPE had hardly shaped the infrastructure of the USA. Also, do you know how many things Americans fuel with H2? Not many my pasty, dentally challenged friend. So, while there is a shred of truth to that last one, I would hardly brag. Do we need me to shoot down the financial argument too before you can admit that you've been found wanting? Now onto the next one...
@ sirfightalot....Do not even get me started. SAS is a spec forces group, most of which, from any nation, could take down nearly any regular army barracks from any nation. Let's not even get into military superiority debates here my friend, for you are certain to fall short. The US military machine is BY FAR the most POWERFUL MILITARY. EVER!

Just a couple little questions. You don't want to be a part of OUR WARS? Really? Then why are you there?  Again, you wouldn't exist if Americans had that mentality during TWO World Wars that we didnt need to be a part of either. 
We did not steal the language. It is the language that the First settlers of our nation spoke. Your lanuage, yes, cause we started out Englishmen. couple little things to remember though, Our people quit being your people when instead of taking up the cause of FREEDOM and casting away the yoke of MONARCHY, your people chose to war with your own countrymen. You chose to KILL us because we would no longer bow to tyrants. After having your collective asses handed to you, you still chose the side of tyranny and oppression instead of supporting your countrymen, the settlers, my forefathers. Perhaps you chose wrong? "

And anyway, I for one am all for conquest.  Your Nation was too not too long ago. you just aren't that good at it.
 I just do not see what happened to you people. You Shit on us as long as you could and we forgave you for it. We had a good relationship with you. So much so that we did come bail you out of extinction twice. We did it willingly because even though we had our differences in the past, you are our brothers and sisters. We prospered together and led this world together into the 21st century. Now I'm not sure what they are teaching you about us but it shocks me. Sure Americans are arrogant and cocky but don't we deserve to be a bit? don't you too? But to deny that we saved you from Hitler????!!!!!! Really? I think your own gradfathers would whoop your asses for saying something like that.

Its plain for me to see that we as a human race will find it hard to really thrive with what we have coming. I don't know what is coming but it gets worse with every generation so... Now, we will survive but its not about just surviving its about living well and the only way we will survive as painlessly as possible is to put all this stuff about who's fault it is and who gets credit for all of our comforts and our pain  behind us and realize that we are all humans and we have a responsibility to our offspring and each other to put our survival and our health into perspective.

Easy to hate on America when your countries are so small you couldn't do shit to help yourselves. England is the original enemy of America. Their still bitter because a bunch of farmers beat their whole army. Now lets talk about all the colony's the dirty brits have had over the past 200 years or so. and how they took whatever they wanted and then left. sooo pretty much an America thats way to small to ever mean anything on a global scale ever again. As far as protecting europe.. I wouldn't if the world economy depended on it. We have had to bail you ungrateful fucks out of two world wars and they were won because of us. And I speak English too faggot. but not that ridiculous sounding shit yall speak, but the english that America made...the good one."
,monkeycunt,2011-05-10T15:54Z,"Most americans dont realise this but until pearl harbour america were supplying the nazi's with weapons so dont go on about bailing us out when your just a bunch of racist, homophobic pricks like hitler! And you didn't join the war until it had already got serious in europe, bidding your time so you could come out on top. Didnty work tho since you owe china more money than your country makes in a decade!! Ooops!!"

If you think mighty over the USA in WW2 Europe, us Brits and Russians would eventually end the Reich, Americans were seen as cowards because they denied military help to Poland and France, they grew fat and rich on the Atlantic trades while the entire world was at war. Only after Peal Harbour USA joined the struggle. 

And it wasnt a bunch of farmers that defeated the English at America, it was the French army and the native militias or rednecks with guns (americans). The French actually released America from English govern. Thats why Canada has a English side and French one, same as Louisiana wich has a strong French background. Thats one of the reasons for The Statue of Liberty, its to honour the French and made by a french man

And you complain about english farmers that exploit America during colonization, isnt that the very same USA did to the Mexicans, during the conquering wars.

Shit, you are ignorant.

So you think thereÂ´s nothing wrong with a country/society where terrorists blast airplanes into buildings?

You think thereÂ´s nothing wrong with a country where presidents are assassinated while posing in parades, very much like Reich Marshalls.

You think thereÂ´s nothing wrong with a society where 1 out of 3 people have a weight problem?

And yes, i agree, some people are highly influenced by american trends, lifestyle, music etc. I do enjoy it myself to a point. 

The same way americans are influenced by European, even more. USA is bits and pieces of borrowed cultures. Beeing the European at its summit, because it followed the immigrants when they colonized America.

(e.g.) Thomas Jefferson (you might want to google him) was completly mad about french wine, he had one of the worlds largest collections.

(e.g.) USA bought our bridge, and place it in a fake lake somewhere in the desert.

(e.g.) Alot of the European artwork today is kept by american collectors, curators and macenas. 

Your hatred is so overwhelming that you show no respect at all for the coutry wich is the base of your culture and pilar of your identity, isnt your name James, Steve, Paul, dont you speak English, dont you believe in God (general).

Not to mention the ""thermonucular"" solution you adopt so easilly if pushed. Need i clear it up by saying that we are debating politics and your comment is completly absurd and ignorant. 

Its exacly because of people like yourself and ""Timebomb1441"" that Europe needs to get the fuck away. I actually need to thank you for making it so obvious.

If you want to drop bombs on people and wage mindless wars against God knows what; fine, but deal with the consequences yourselfs and leave Europe/UK out of it.

First of all I never said that there is nothing wrong with my country. Second, the Thermonuclear comment was a bit much I will be the first to admit, however, the spirit of that comment was more the point. Your country has forgotten TWO very important things, WWI and WWII. All you Brits who have been arguing that you would have won WWII without the US to save your asses need a history lesson. All of you who said the Soviets would have won without the US need a history lesson. Well before the US's entrance into actual combat, we were busy saving both of your nations asses. Where in the hell do you think the weapons and equipment that kept you alive once Hitler had driven you limeys back off the mainland to your island came from? What about the fact that Stalin's Red Army was driven all the way to Moscow and its back all but broken and all of a sudden they rallied and threw a renewed force at Germany? Where do you think an impoverished and broken nation came up with the resources to pull off driving Hitler from their very fucking doorstep? That not being enough, we still commited troops and American lives to YOUR sad little war effort. What gets me heated, is your younger generation not only lacks the basic realization that America saved your asses on more than one occasion, but to be so disrespectful on top of that makes me sick and makes me hate your people and the SACRIFICES my people made for you. If you read back I have more than once admitted that our country has issues and like all nations there is room for improvement. But to listen to the way you Brits go on about how you are BETTER somehow!!?!???! WTF? You have got to be high or something. As to America being an ENGLISH NATION??? That stopped being true the instant your worthless decendants fired on their own people rather than defend them against tyranny, all in the name of a stagnant inbred monarchy. You can claim absolutely ZERO credit for the building of this nation. The people that worked to build this nation are from all over the WORLD and your country is the one that threw EVERYTHING it had at trying to DESTROY our country and our ideals when still in their infancy. So, America is an English nation? I think not. Go fuck yourself."
,maggotrape,2011-05-12T15:20Z,"P.S. @ Toxina

The United States of America has had one, that's right, ONE attack on its people, whether by terrorist, or military, since Pearl Fucking Harbor in the 1940's! Ummmmm how many times has your country been attacked since then? and the world hates us? To correct you; Radical Muslim nations and Militaristic Dictatorships hate the U.S. because unlike you, Americans will do our best, whenever possible, to stop people like that from hurting the weak, and committing atrocities. Can we stop them all? No. Would we if we could? Abso-fucking-lutely! We stepped in to save your ungrateful asses more than once. How many times have Englishmen stepped into hostile territory to help the victims of tyranny? I can't think of any that you weren't reluctantly dragged into by the U.N. What about Bosnia? They BEGGED and BEGGED for your help and you sat on your hands and let them suffer countless horrors. Why? Not because your military was committed elsewhere. No, Because your people have always been tyrannical, and so you do not sympathize with the victims of tyranny! But you sure do have your dirty little hands stretched out when somebody shits all over you. You couldn't be more different than us. America is an English country?

So did the Reich, that was completly drained of oil, the main reason for the Soviet mildly planned invasion was to capture oil fields, the Soviet pushback after the Stalingrad Battle was overwheelming, Nazi troops were already on retreat prior to Market Garden let alone D-Day. Americans barely set foot in Britain, Soviets were already kicking ass.

I firmly believe that even without the American landings on Europe, the Soviets and the Common Wealth were capable of defeating the Reich by land. 

At least we didnt play the neutral card unlike Sweden wich supported both sides like a two way street. Besides Brits, Scots, Welsh, Aussies and Kiwis defeated the Axis troops in Africa. And by Axis i mean Rommel.

And yes the British did some awfull atrocities in the past, very much like the rest of Europe, thats why i mentioned EuropeÂ´s/English reputation building up to reliable after all the awfullness we brought on the World."
,Toxina,2011-05-13T00:09Z,"@ maggotrape

I never said America was a English country. Dont mistake the names on the comments please. I said the cultural base and identity is from English influence, nothing more.

USA only came to Europe to fight in WW2 when there was no more dollar to be made, USA exploited the war in Europe, a simple and sad business opportunity. 

Political hypocrisy and business opportunity left England in debt to USA on high interest rate loan that took close to 50 years to repay.

Canada, Australia and New Zeland joined the war as soon at it began in 1939, while USA only joinned in 1942, sucking out the dollar from the half-demolished nations in Europe. 

Today, people barely remember the Canadian, Aussie and Kiwi effort in WW2 wich was by far more honorable, but everyone remembers greedy USA wich crashed the party late only 
to benefit from a half-done job.

But, so highly speaks America in defence of freedom, former ally to Napolean imperialistic blitz that shored the New World colonies. 
Reaching out to gain independence on the shoulders of European despair and French tyranny.

Nothing less then ironic though, the French helped the USA in the struggle for independance only to be turned down at the beginning of WW2. Remarkable

And dont forgett Israhell and how USA completly supports a full scale ethnic clean up. If youÂ´re so eager to fight for other people civil rights, help the Palestinians. 

But maybe in a Hollywood film right mate, because we both know that will never happen. And if it does, Palestinians will surely be the villains, like the Native American Indian.

I wonder if Steven Spielberg is person enough to direct a film wich shows the atrocities done to the arab nacionals of Israel, i wonder if hes person enough to film how good Israelian are at piloting american made tanks, jet planes, helicopters and the overall use of American made weaponary in the etnic cleansing taking place in Israel."
,Micke_the_Swede,2011-05-13T02:36Z,"Toxina. Yes Sweden played the nuetral card because we had no military to speak of no way to defend our selfs. It would have been suicidal to attack germany. And before u drag upp Norway or Denmark keep inmind that they where invaded and had no choice but to fight and as for Austraila and New Zealand they where also in under threat of invasion by the japanese and fought in asia not in europe. And yes Germany had little oil that and food which is why as you said they attacked the Soviets that and the fact that Stalin planned himself to attack germany before they where attaked but he did not have the means to do so before Germany invaded. Anyway to the point Russia could not have defended itself without American aid, and to say it isin't so is to ignore the facts."
,Micke_the_Swede,2011-05-13T02:45Z,"Toxina. About Israel England Started the troubles over there by kicking out the Arabs who lived so that the jews could move in, they weren't asked to move but pretty much forced to move. And your country is to blame for all the troubles there just as much as the americans because u both need them for information and as an ally in the war against terror wich u both suffer from."
,Micke_the_Swede,2011-05-13T03:05Z,"Sorry i forgott something. At the time of ww2 Australia still had very strong ties with England for obvius reasons. So it's easy to see why they felt so strongly about fighting the germans espesually after ww1. On the other hand many where forced to fight for England such as India and many Africans if they had a choice i don't think thay would have.

And i wan't also to say that i am not debating u because i am pro american i am pro facts. Amercas problem are the right wing christians and hard core republikans whom r narrow minded and only see things there way and cannot see that there r other ways to go. I do think that the wars on terror  r nesesary even  though they r horrible but that is the nature of war, how else would the world be rid of saddam hussein and the taliban if the Americans didn't invade none of our contries would have done a thing if it weren't for the U.S i'm sad to say."

New Zeland and Aussie troops fougth in Europe and Africa during WW2. Australia alone fought in Europe, Africa and Pacific, pretty much as USA if not more.  

England was simply colonizing territory in the New World, far from the tyrannical govern that was rising in France wich peaked with Napolean just after the Rev. The same that divided Sweden.

The British mandate in Palestine was not a force out, it was an idea that followed the territorial seperations after WW1. The British govern of Palestine was aproved by the LON or the UN of the time.

The goal was to give the jewish a national home. 

But mandate clearly states that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine. And all went fine. 

Today however, USA clearly influences the politics in the region and shite starts flying eastbound over the Jordan, especially right after WW2 when Israel became Ind.
