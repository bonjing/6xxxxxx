,bullyboy8,2011-01-18T14:34Z,"I've noticed Kash has two sons, rather than one boy and one girl. And Ian has an interest in the military... so you can see where that story is going. But otherwise it's the same. I don't think Debbie looks right, personally... :/

I don't mind though, it's been a while since I've seen the first series and I like the new faces. I'll be interested to see if characters like Fiona get written out, or whether the stories will change after the first series because the American actors are happy to stay. 

P.S. Seeing a penis in the first episode, didn't expect that from an American show. XD"
,Masterfrog,2011-01-18T16:30Z,"Why aren't these newer series released in 720p? I can't even watch anything less any more, it's like stabbing my eyes out with a rusty spoon."

,axismundi,2011-01-22T17:50Z,"@cad40 Law & Order UK is not 'your version' it's the American scripts taken and set in the UK. Seriously, the exact same scripts with locations changed and Apollo added. Still good either way. Who cares if this was stolen from the UK or stolen from the US, it's good programming either way. Also, the U.S. makes some things better, Sanford & Son is far better than Steptoe & Son for example... but the UK will always have better things, like the Doctor."
,axismundi,2011-01-22T18:03Z,"@cad40 as far as school shootings, UK has had them too... like Dunblane massacre 18 dead, also other mass shootings like Cumbria shootings 13 dead,  Monkseaton shooting 1 dead 14 injured, Hungerford massacre 17 dead, 15 injured. But what is that, it's illegal to own firearms in your country... yet shootings still happen. "
,axismundi,2011-01-22T18:04Z,"@cad40 also Scotland, March 1996: Gun enthusiast Thomas Hamilton shoots 16 children and their teacher dead at their primary school in Dunblane, Scotland before killing himself. "
,djslanty,2011-01-24T07:19Z,"Canadians made basketball, and hockey, we canadians also make original programing like that of some places haha.

[T],cad40,2011-01-24T22:18Z,how about black adder 2 awards 1 the young ones won awards red dwarf won awards plus many more also y are most american hit films and series played by english born actors top us show house guess what engish 
,Joel_Matton,2011-01-25T15:56Z,"I've never seen the original, but I love this show so far, possibly the best new show in years - Almost all the good shows on TV started several years ago.

Cad40 - You need to learn to use punctuation, question marks and comma's, it's almost impossible to read a 50 word sentence."
,NitLions,2011-01-26T04:36Z,"Omg stop being such pussy faggots about your little TV show!! I promise you NONE of the Brits that are crying like little girls on here had ANYTHING to do with creating the UK version of the show!! Not even a little! Why they fucking care about a show they had nothing to do with is way beyond me! Quit your jealous bitching about America, you wouldn't care what people in America did if u didn't wish you lived here"
,dezench,2011-01-31T03:48Z,"Thanks for uploading this. Great show. 

@cad40, you have issues. Friendly fire? WW2? Seriously? Wtf? Why would you even bring that up on a torrent thread? If you aren't thanking those who uploaded it then stfu. Americans copy for Brits. Brits copy from Americans. Movies, shows, etc. Who cares?"
,TehWench,2011-02-12T10:12Z,"Oh wow
These comments are retarded."
,Chadly,2011-02-28T17:45Z,"I love they remade these good UK shows in america. Like Skins. The UK versions are hard to understand at some points, with all the british slang. Still good, but I personally miss abit of the story with all the british slang. If your not from around there, its pretty much impossible to undertsand. So I say thank you to whoever brought them over here and redid it with a way we would better understand."
,prinlm,2011-03-27T06:36Z,Thanks man! I love this show.
,candycanegl,2011-03-31T18:25Z,omg shut up. watch the show or don't. nobody cares.
,jesssssee,2011-04-10T08:44Z,"cad40... you need to lighten up. you also should use punctuation. i have no idea what you are ranting about. it is very hard to tell when you won't punctuate! i have watched the US version and now the UK version. i have to say the US one is better. not that either are great. also, american football will kick the ass of any sport the UK can provide. don't try and tell me that rugby is hardcore. it's a bunch of dudes hugging each other hard."
,4Ron,2011-05-19T13:05Z,"Cheers for the upload VTV,

IMO
H Macy plays a shithouse frank, he reminds me of those people you see at parties who have one drink and act smashed.  His voice isn't gravely and he seems fully coherent when he isn't asleep. NOT FRANK AT ALL. UK version shits all over the US version, but i suppose you yanks will never know because you cant understand this apparent ""english slang"" they use?  LOL.   and @jesssssee - check out Gloucestershire Cheese Rolling, if you had that in the USA you'd all be wearing full body armour"
,melloblu,2011-06-14T02:48Z,Listen up Britts Americans liked the idea of the show so we used it like everything else we use to create a melting pot of a nation in which you are jealous of. The reason why is because we kicked your ass so many times and we are better than you at everything. Especially when it comes to media. You just wish you could be like us and the fact is you never will be. we are the best and make the best media so any ideas you have we can and will take them and make them better because you suck anyways. plus your accents give the world a headache and since you can never win a fight no one will ever listen to your griping so shut the fuck up. by the way obviously the american actors and the american version of the show is WAAAAY better. dont disrespect america because we are stronger and better. That is just sad.
,axerine,2011-07-02T21:58Z,This is great. Thanx from Europe!
,MusicLoverAndGleek,2011-09-06T09:53Z,"I'm from the UK and I love Shameless and when I heard the US were doing one too I wasn't to sure about it, Because I didn't enjoy the US version of Skins (Personal Opinion) But this is actually quite good, From what I've seen so far.

And I'm ashamed of some Brits on here saying American's copy us. -.- They haven't just stolen Shameless and copied it the producers and writers of Shameless UK have given them permission to use the UK based show as a stater and develop the characters as the American show writers choose. 

Honestly get off your high horse. -.- 

Oh and, I personally think that people from the UK have a more open mind when it comes to sex, drugs and alcohol because personally I'm 18 (Just turned) I've tried Weed I go out and get drunk and I'm not a virgin and I started drinking and smoking at the age of 12, So I think British people connect more with the story lines in Shameless and Skins ETC... (: That's just my personal opinion. "
