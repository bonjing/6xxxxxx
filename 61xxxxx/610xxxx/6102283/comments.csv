,indy_tx,2011-01-18T07:40Z,"Keep an eye out for the instructor's solutions manual...

The instructor's solutions manual for a previous edition of this book is available in this torrent:

Serway Jewett Physics for Scientists and Engineers 6E + Solution

Some of the problems are the same so that solutions manual can still be helpful."
