Thanks  a million for Tobor
You saved my life...for a while at least
Every day is a struggle
A hard one...
Hell or Heaven...
What to choose?
Have a Great Beautiful Year 2011
You, and your loved ones

And, I want to reiterate my thanks as well for too many wonderful old titles to list, that I didn't even realize I was missing till you posted them."
[T],bitstreeem,2011-01-29T20:02Z,"Thanks so much for the awesome comments folks.  Soon I will start again to put forth more 'classics'.  I've just been going through some life crap lately and just haven't had alot of extra time.  In the meanwhile...Enjoy dammit!

Long live The Bay! "
