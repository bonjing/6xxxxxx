,shmimbadad,2012-03-05T02:29Z,"720p is 1280x536 in that ""super widescreen"" format that most movies use these days, so it's letterboxed, even on a ""widescreen"" tv (or computer monitor). At a regular widescreen aspect ratio, 720p is 1280x720, so with super widescreen, it's the same width, just even shorter vertically. Its like how 1080p is 1920x1080, but in super widescreen its 1920x900."
