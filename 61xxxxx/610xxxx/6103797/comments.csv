,Roqwell,2011-03-08T20:56Z,"Video quality is perfect 720p HD, I wish I could say the same for the audio, which is terrible. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but played it in VLC and sounded awful, converted it to mp4 with HandBrake, played through QuickTime and was still no better."
,spiker87,2011-03-15T06:58Z,"I agree with Roqwell...this audio is absolutely terrible and I'm sorry because the video is great but there is no cure for the audio, something along the line of this rip/rendering went wrong"
,Glowyrm,2011-04-22T05:31Z,The video is great but the audio is pretty bad.
,User897,2011-05-06T03:20Z,Agreed about the audio.  Sounds like an AM radio in a trashcan.  Terrible!
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-05-14T19:15Z,"You must have problems with yours ears! :(

This audio is perfect! :) "
,taviyo,2011-05-23T19:13Z,Poor audio - looks good visually but highly compressed audio means a waste of a download.
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-06-03T21:09Z,AUDIO = 9 :)
,dvjndvo,2011-07-03T22:46Z,"Nope, the sound is absolute crap. Not worth downloading!"
,jknvdfkn,2011-09-24T03:20Z,"Overall bit rate is 2 879 Kbps
Video bit rate is 2 681 Kbps
Which leaves 198 Kbps for 6 channels 48 KHz AAC. This needs to have a bit rate like 3 times higher."
