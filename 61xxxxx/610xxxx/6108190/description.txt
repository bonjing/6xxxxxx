CHAOTES UNITE!

Okay, so you\'ve gotten the sigil/gnosis/etc thing down but... what really makes a chaote? Here, I\'ve done my best to outline the basic concepts and, again, I\'ve done that without all of the mainstream Chaos babble. I haven\'t read all of the PDFs (only skimmed) but i have listened to the audios. I can attest that they are, in fact, awesome.

Everything has an element, a tool, a belief that is useful. It\'s like cooking. Sure you can use some one else\'s recipe or one style but, it\'s not until you make something your own that you create greatness. Brothers and Sisters, never be afraid to explore outside of the Occult to grow in the Occult and Magick.

Honestly I\'m not satisfied with this. I\'ll make a version 2 sometime in the future. Or if you want to, let me know of a good article or book, etc, and we\'ll collaborate.
