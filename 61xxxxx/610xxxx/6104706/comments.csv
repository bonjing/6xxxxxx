Why does THC cross the blood brain barrier?

Why doesn't holding the smoke in your lungs increase absorption?

What causes the blush effect?

What neurotransmitters come into to play, Dopamine, Serotonin, etc?

And that is all glossed over within the first 15 minutes ( when I stopped watching )

Crap, crap and crap. "
