                    Danny applies for the prestigious job of State  
                    Vet. Meanwhile, he attempts to involve Thabo in  
                    his work but does not realise that Du Plessis  
                    is feeling pushed out. A geologist comes to  
                    survey the area, arousing Du Plessis's   
                    suspicions. A rogue baboon causes problems for  
                    the inhabitants of Leopard's Den.
