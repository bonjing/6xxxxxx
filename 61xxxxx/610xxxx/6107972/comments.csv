,43915,2011-01-17T18:10Z,"Recording to familyguy.wikia, this is episode 9. I think the episode ""road to north pole"" isn't supposed to be counted as 2 episodes.

Otherwise, thank you so much for all your uploads, I download many of the most popular series from you as soon as you put them out. :)"
,43915,2011-01-17T18:11Z,"Whops, i meant ""according to"", not ""recording to"". ;p"
,fk_a_alien,2011-01-18T05:48Z,i never write comments on torrents becaus the only thing i have to say is that you uploaders is lifesavers! and i guess you hear it often enough and i feel it's not thanks enough. (plus you probably get so many comments so you don't even read them) but THANKS! keep up the work and i'll seed!
,Wheezy,2011-01-18T05:54Z,"We had this debate last time! Some people name it as a DVD/Production Code release which Family Guy is listed as on Wiki.

However considering this is a TV rip the naming convention should still be S09E09 for this epp. S09E08 was only a split episode in certain countries."
,holyfool,2011-01-18T06:47Z,9-10 thanx!
,ElDigato,2011-01-18T10:51Z,"Whoa! A family guy episode without meg bitching, or brain acting like an ""Intellectual"" and dating sluts or Fagmire's annoyances! There's still Lois' voice. "
,ebud,2011-01-19T04:58Z,"@Wheezy, ya, lol. It's gonna go on forever. I wouldn't even bother answering.
These morons must believe in God or whatever they wanna call ""it"". They might even believe Obama will save America, but voted Bush last election ... hahaha ! Same sh!t, different pile..."
,oikjgbvguiugfc,2011-01-23T04:54Z,"unresolved plot..
(good upload though)"
,dorfpimp,2011-01-24T18:39Z,This is S09E09 not E10. Go to sidereel.com to check out what the episodes are really supposed to be. Disappointing...I was really looking forward to seeing E10.
,fates_eye,2011-01-30T19:28Z,"EZTV: if you can, it would be awesome if you got these from adultswim where they are uncut and uncensored (although a later release), just throwing it out there"
,Kotteeen,2011-01-30T20:04Z,please upload more episodes from season 9!! Thx
,Kobbak,2011-01-31T19:29Z,when is the 11th episode released ?! 
,Wheezy,2011-02-01T10:07Z,"@Kobbak Feb 13th S09E10 ""the hand that rocked the wheelchair"" will air. "
,piratehaxor,2011-02-02T07:06Z,"This is the episode with joyce kinney. Good episode, thanks for uploading!"
,slashcomp,2011-02-03T22:26Z,"why don't they do an episode where brian defecates all over the pavement, and peter doesn't pick it up, and then a kid trips up and falls in it and catches all kinds of diseases, cos that seems like the thing a fatass waste of space would do."
,aldebaran91,2011-02-04T05:39Z,why is there a 3 week break here god damn it
,Burque,2011-02-06T10:54Z,THIS IS EPSD 9!!!
,Kobbak,2011-02-09T14:11Z,"Just 3 more days guys, then the real episode 10 will be on air! :D"
,Kobbak,2011-02-15T22:18Z,"the REAL e10 is not coming out so...they must be making a movie or something...waiting time over a month now c,mon!"
