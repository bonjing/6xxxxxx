With blazinâ€™ performances on the major European festivals and venues like, Roskilde (Denmark), Lowlands (Netherlands),Festineuch (Switserland), Coleur CafÃ© (Brussels/Belgium), Cabaret Sauvage (France) and Super Bock Fest (Portugal) Ziggi proves one again that he is amongst the top few of European Reggae acts.

Growing up on the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius the young Ricardo Blijden was given the nickname Ziggi by his grandparents who raised him. In 2001 Ziggi came to the Netherlands to study. It was in that time when he was introduced to Mr. Rude the owner of an independent studio and label called Rock â€™N Vibes Entertainment. Soon chilling out in the studio with friends became a professional musical career for Ziggi.Since then Ziggi is a signed recording artist to the Rock â€™N Vibes record label and management. The dream team was made...........Quote Mr Rude: â€œZiggi had a vibe from the first time I heard him singâ€
