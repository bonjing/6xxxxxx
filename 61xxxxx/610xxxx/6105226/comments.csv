,Jordy141,2011-01-19T20:47Z,"Dude... the guy that made this, Notch, is an indie developer. He isn't some big company making shitloads of profit. He sells arguably the best game of the decade for hardly anything, and continues to provide free updates. And you distribute it FOR FREE? If it was some overpriced Adobe shit then fine, but seriously.. even hardcore illegal downloaders must have some morals.."
,belutak,2011-01-20T00:47Z,"it works :) thx to uploader
shut it Jordy141, wtf u doing here anyway?"
,Doohl,2011-01-20T02:25Z,"Excellent job, narfdude - the update works like a charm! 

And as for Mr. Jordy141, I think he is completely misunderstanding the purpose of this website ;)"
,Jordy141,2011-01-20T17:17Z,"Misunderstanding the purpose? I use TPB all of the time, and I have no problem with it when it is stuff from billionaire companies, but when you're causing all this loss of profit to a guy who made this game alone and sells it for hardly anything, it gets pathetic, it doesn't even cost much to buy the damn thing. You people are pathetic, really."
,narfdude,2011-01-20T19:25Z,"sorry all. jordy is my pet monkey. i got him a computer for christmas and he finally figured out how to use it. I shall discipline him later by taking away his tire swing.

while we are talking about notch, you know he has sold over one million copies. if the average price paid for each copy is about 10 euros, then he has made over 10 mil in revenue. nuff said"
,greylion,2011-01-20T20:00Z,"Methinks Jordy141 should take a look at what Notch has to say about piracy:

can someone help`?
i definitely installed it correctly and minecraft_name_alt.jar is in the folder too"
,Filthgoblin,2011-01-23T13:01Z,will this update work with Kaens megapack 1.2.6?
,narfdude,2011-01-24T06:46Z,"@atarigamer try using the minecraft launcher to start the game instead of minecraft.jar in the bin folder.

@yebopilot delete the minecraft shortcut you are using to try to start it and make a new shortcut to minecraft_name_alt.

@Filthgoblin No it won't, but you can play this updated one side-by-side with kaen's megapack"
,lavaflav,2011-01-26T19:39Z,"Their are only a few good reasons for internet piracy.  

1: Not sold in my country.

2: Teenager. No credit card. 

3: Games not made anymore.

4: I'm flat broke.
If none apply to you, yeah.  Go buy minecraft.  Other wise.  GET A JOB YA WHINO!"
,tink5,2011-01-27T13:52Z,"hi narfdude,
when I run minecraft it crashes at startup after simulating world during saving chunks,
please can you help I have been 3 days at this, I have java 6 and windows xp
thanks"
,jacobpare,2011-01-27T23:08Z,"I tried everything you've said so far, i have it installed from an earlier upload, and it says ""outdated launcher"" every time i login. Any ideas?"
,narfdude,2011-01-28T00:36Z,"@tink5 your world might be corrupted. try starting a new world to see if that is the problem.

@jacobpare leave the password and username empty when you login."
,tink5,2011-01-28T11:11Z,"no,
 this happens when I start a new world, it runs fine on my laptop but not on my desktop. "
,k123321,2011-01-29T01:51Z,"Downloaded the game, played it, liked it, bought it."
,pasmurf,2011-01-29T12:52Z,"i have downloaded it, extracted to appdata but now what, i can't open it, anyone got any ideas?"
,killakittens,2011-01-30T02:04Z,"everyone needs to stop their whining.. sure notch seems like a pretty cool guy but check out minecrafts wikipedia page.. 

notch had 750,000 usd in his paypal account built up while paypal froze his account.. hes made millions from minecraft personally after little more than a years work, hes not exactly some starving artist with ten mouths to feed as depicted.."
,Quantize,2011-01-30T20:36Z,"Ive actually tried to buy this game, but their website is so fucking shitty that my payment wont go through.

Im buying it when it goes on steam or when they realise their payment system is fucked up and fix it."
,narfdude,2011-01-31T04:19Z,"@tink5 you could post your desktop's specs and i could take a guess at what the problem is. you could also update java.

@pasmurf you'll need the rest of the games files to play minecraft. this is just an update. to get the rest of the files, get a torrent that lists the size as larger than 30mb, or, you could get the updater."
,imrayya12,2011-02-12T15:35Z,to play online use tunngle
,AnderEL,2011-02-14T01:55Z,"Hi if you like to know how to find diamonds iron gold and how to build cool things take a look at my youtube videos my channel name is AnderZEL hope you find lots off diamonds :)

,raidfag,2011-02-18T02:48Z,"@Jordyfag
HEY. You know Markus Persson? Indie developer? Minecraft creator?
Yeah. He's the ONLY guy working on Minecraft. Free updates? Cool. Not making shitloads of profit? LOL. He's got 1320823 individual copies of Minecraft sold. If he sold them at only 10 currency each, he'd have 13208230 currency. What the fuck does one guy do with that kind of money? All of the resources he pays for don't even add up to a fraction of that. So yes. He's making shitloads of profit.
FUCK.
YOU."
,phwp2r,2011-02-22T14:08Z,"I'm getting it here just to try it out.
