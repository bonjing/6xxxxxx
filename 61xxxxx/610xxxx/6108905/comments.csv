You realize how petty you sound, right?
You sound like the sort of person who wins the lottery and screams at the tellar that you wanted it in $100 bills NOT $50's

How bout you try again, and this time try to pretend that nobody owes you anything, and somebody uploaded this for little reward.

(You may want to bring your manners next time)"
