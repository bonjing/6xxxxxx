Godfather is a 3Â˝ hour long full frame presentation. This shit is the perfect example why this section needs a sub category titled ""low bitrate/quality""."
[T],murdoc47,2011-01-14T00:19Z,go fu*k your mother instead
[T],murdoc47,2011-01-15T09:52Z,can anyone confirm if it works on any consoles? and if the subs work. thanks

Agreed.

I don't understand why murdoc doesn't understand that using high res/low bitrate is a flawed concept. 

Though I still don't understand why he/she bothers blurting out a stream of profanity rather than a real sentence."

,dzon_vejn,2011-03-17T15:01Z,"mudroc47 - thanks for this great film!!

[T],murdoc47,2011-03-17T17:01Z,"actually, it's murdoc47 :D

,xxxjoline,2011-06-04T22:21Z,Thanks for the upload! 
,khm_mughal,2011-08-31T00:06Z,are sub titles included in this movie??
,ctrlplusalt,2012-02-08T12:59Z,excelent!
,theo23rd,2012-02-25T21:37Z,"I notice the people complaining are uploading nothing, offering no practical comment or advice, nor are they providing a PB link where they think a better torrent can be found. I don't know yet how good this torrent is, because I am downloading it now. It's fast, which is cool, and it's here, even cooler. Thanks for being cool. Trolls, be gone."
,OMFGItsME,2012-04-10T20:53Z,"Nice quality,
But why are you using mvk?
Lol I'm newb so can u tell me?"
,3atwa,2012-04-15T00:10Z,"why there's lost of mother fu9ers here posing bad reply for 1 of the best HD ribs i had ever seen? 
1- maybe they r blind 
2-maybe they r >>mlevolent"
[T],murdoc47,2012-04-16T16:31Z,"@OMFGItsME: i use mkv because it is the wave of the future (for now). matroska codecs offer, in my opinion, best compression/quality."
,Zapfinger,2012-06-16T15:09Z,"i got this but ive also found a 60gb trilogy torrent here which i am going to download aswell and im gonna write a comment about the quality differences here if there are any to be found which i think will be the case since 60gb looks like pure quality and from my experience it is.. i downloaded apollo 13 once with 17gb and the quality was superb to other 4gb ones like this here is. but lets not be hasty here, i still havent looked at the 60gb one. this one here looks acceptable but maybe the other one is better. we'll see tomorrow probably.
