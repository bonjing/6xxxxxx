,ccglindsey,2011-01-15T00:50Z,"Thank you so much.

Great uploads ALWAYS!"
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2011-01-25T15:11Z,"NFO file included has install directions for AnyDVD..

Win7 users must copy the key into the program directory to get it to work.."
,Bloho_Jo,2011-01-30T03:34Z,"NFO has instructions for AnyDVD, not Hard Disk Sentinel.

No key file.

One rar'd EXE file, opening with WinRAR shows files that have nothing to do with Hard Disk Sentinel.

Too nervous to run this, appears to be a crap torrent."

All his releases work perfectly, that's why he's a VIP."
,Robo88,2011-02-13T08:38Z,seems dangerous - only one exe. I'm not comfortable with this. beware 
,jaybl,2011-03-08T01:54Z,WTF?...Where's the key??...ChattChitto you are killing your downloaders...First provide the key to open..then post installation instructions...
