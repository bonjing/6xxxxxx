 am An Ambitious Trance Electro Ambient Artist From South Western Ontario.This is my 2nd major Electronic album I have released.I think its kick ass how i as a Musician am able to make so much appear from nothing. I enjoy Deep meanings and incorporate ideas and prospects on what is to be and not to be. Best thing to do is check my stuff out listen to the songs fully you will be pleasantly surprised so what i have been told...
