
Luxor Adventures
Travel to the edge of time and back with the Ancient Egyptian gods!

In this hidden-object adventure, follow John and Jane as they travel through the past to keep history intact. When the archaeology duo uncovers the Osiris Orb, they learn that the mystical Stairway to Heaven is more real than they had first believed.

Now, they find themselves tumbling through time and space in a race to keep the deceptive, powerhungry Seth Hisster from changing history forever. Recover a list of items misplaced in time to restore balance to the universe whilst collecting mystical orbs that will help to close the dangerous portal. Along the way, meet legends like Leonardo da Vinci, Amelia Earhart and Benjamin Franklin as they race against the clock to set things right.
