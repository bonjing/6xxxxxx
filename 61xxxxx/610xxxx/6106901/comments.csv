Oh, A/V 10.
Go on, download and waste a little time watching it, you know you want to.
Thanks .Bone"

Very satisfyingly bad movie. It's so utterly repulsive and badly done generally, it borders on revolting.
Love it ;)"

,crudmax,2011-01-17T23:05Z,"oh yeah - Moby Dick 2010

Some of the best Angry acting ever !"
,fngrbang,2011-01-17T23:16Z,"Oh Yeah -Moby Dick 2010 is a cracker.

Angry acting at its finest (go barry bostwick with the sad looking plastic steam punk wooden leg)

Its almost as if . . . . its been made that way intentionally.
Has to be a great return for the investors huh !!"
