Din, champion of the gods, has cursed you into a second life of service because 
you selfishly squandered your first one while causing misfortune to those 
around you. To redeem yourself, you must impress Din by building a reputation 
for helping others. Travel the spacious western plains of Aleria and save 
desperate towns from the brink of annihilation. Until you're redeemed, you're 
doomed to wander the earth alone for all eternity.

In Din's Curse, you will explore an extensive underground, slaying dangerous 
monsters, solving dynamic quests, dodging deadly traps, and in your spare time, 
plundering loot. Quell uprisings, flush out traitors, kill assassins, cure 
plagues, purge curses, end wars, and complete other dangerous quests or the 
danger WILL escalate. Not all is as it seems though, traitors will gladly stab 
you in the back, renegades can revolt against the town, spies can set up 
ambushes, and items might even curse or possess your friends.

Choose one of 141 class combinations and journey to an infinite number of 
dynamically generated towns with vastly different problems. Every game is a 
surprise! Your actions have real consequences in this dynamic, evolving world. 
Your choices actually matter!

Open the door to Din's Curse. Surprising adventures await!
