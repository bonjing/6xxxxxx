Have you ever considered that all it is that we think and do has long
been researched by experts such as Dr Nowland of Texas and placed in 
publications that were long out of reach of most people for reasons of cost
and serendipity?

Why do some people like third world cultures as equal to European? Why do some
people always nag - seeming to want to drive someone insane? Why are some people
always hateful? Why do politicians bosses and others seem to never accept a 
competent suggestion to really improve things? Why does your husband never seem to
want to protect you like in the old days - even when you know he should? Does
he think you should carry weights and now even hold open doors for his buddies
too perhaps! Why does a child never seem to get a caring hug and be allowed to
grow up generously spirited as we once saw human wisdom as?

All this is answered in an e-book which will shock you in its effects upon
the earth soon, as all come to terms with its truth. You'll have yourself
figured out in only a few minutes reading the data and you'll be able to tell 
where everyone else is in the picture too!

Read this short manual and you'll never again accept the wicked theory of
affirmative action, multicultural bigotry or any other forms of unfairness - as 
this theory that's been published indicates precisely what makes such minds tick as
would want to let OJ simpson off since they get to keep the rules and consider what to them is "fair enough" while teaching us how to live to "con-serve their
environment" equally
