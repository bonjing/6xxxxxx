,chungwa,2011-02-05T03:34Z,Is the 'abrupt ending' mentioned in the torrent description the reason why there's only 7 minute of audio on the last disk?
,flackers,2011-03-20T11:27Z,"the last disc only contains 7 mins of audio because nero burning rom split the original audible file into disc sized chunks. after filling as many discs as possible it had 7 mins left so that's why the last disc is 7 mins long.
the abrupt ending refers to the fact that the book feels unfinished. the book ends just as Vic is about to embark on a new chapter of his life and so you're left feeling a little deflated.
I know all this because I created the original torrent on Demonoid.  "
