,Animal98,2011-01-17T20:33Z,Thanks legolash2o for the AIO!!
[V],peck1234,2011-01-17T22:06Z,"Looks good, any activation?"
,Animal98,2011-01-17T22:40Z,Just use Daz Loader 1.9.5
,legolash2o,2011-01-17T23:41Z,"No activation or serial, i was trying to make it 'untouched' as much as possible but i had to use vLite so i could fit it all on one disk :)"
,Animal98,2011-01-18T00:14Z,What all did you have to take out?
,Animal98,2011-01-18T00:23Z,I was wondering how you did this. I was trying myself. I want to do a full AIO with SP1 but fully untouched. I don't care how big it is because it will be going on an USB stick. I install all my windows 7's via usb anyway...so I wouldn't have to take stuff out with vlite 
,legolash2o,2011-01-18T00:43Z,"What i took is listed in the description where it says 'vLite Preset', the latest RT7Lite Beta lets you integrate service packs but to do each one takes time :P

Running ServicePack1.exe /X extracts the cab from within the exe also."
,Animal98,2011-01-18T01:04Z,I was using RT7lite 2.6 beta...but I kept getting errors after about 30 mins of integrating the SP...I'll try again later...what I was wanting to know tho is how to get both x86 and x64 on one install...Thanks!!
,Animal98,2011-01-18T01:48Z,I'm also wanting to create an AIO like this but with Enterprise also
,Achmed2007,2011-01-18T11:07Z,"Why try to fit all into DVD when there is DVD-DL.
Double size and all DVD burners are compatible. The extra price in not ever worth to mention...

But - thanks for your work..."
,biffbaffler,2011-01-18T11:50Z,"@ Achmed2007 - Maybe because not everyone has or can afford to buy a DVD-DL drive...?

I for one am thankfull that someone has put this on a single layer DVD."
,legolash2o,2011-01-18T13:25Z,If you want I can release an untocued DVD-DL version with enterprise on it?
,legolash2o,2011-01-18T13:29Z,Has anyone installed this yet? Is it working fine? :)
,adnan904,2011-01-18T14:43Z,"@Legolash2o, have u removed any driver from this."
,resi10,2011-01-18T15:18Z,"works like a charm, but you must use activation again i found the working one. Cheers =)"
,legolash2o,2011-01-18T15:55Z,Diva Server and Qlogic Fibre Channel Adapter drivers
,rvcybers,2011-01-18T21:07Z,"You did it again, it's working fine like your 1st 
upload. I hope to see ur skull in a few days or month.
Keep up the good uploads. Thanks"
,legolash2o,2011-01-18T21:46Z,"Thanks rvcybers, I will be uploading the same as this again but untouched and includes 'Enterprise' edition (with SP1) hopefully tomorrow."
,Animal98,2011-01-19T02:13Z,Could you possible add Starter and Home Basic as well...I repair computers and having an AIO on an USB flash drive helps tremendously!! Especially when I need to repair a netbook! Thanks!

,happyface_0,2011-01-19T06:15Z,can anyone confirm that this is in fact RTM SP1? (post your windows version number)
,legolash2o,2011-01-19T06:49Z,"Animal, Home Basic is already included, but i will try and add starter."

will come in very handy"
,sole_fish,2011-01-20T01:37Z,Why did I get asked for activation and given a 30 day limit once install finished?
,Animal98,2011-01-20T02:31Z,Because there is no activation on this version. Search for win 7 activation
,dr.dccd,2011-01-20T02:34Z,i joined thepiratebay.org to thank you for your effort>>>
,adnan904,2011-01-20T10:32Z,@Legolash2o the drivers that u have removed from this iso i.e Diva Server and Qlogic Fibre Channel Adapter drivers ....r they of any great importance???????????????
,legolash2o,2011-01-20T14:37Z,"@adnan904, nope you will probably never use them... ever!"
,vintermac,2011-01-21T06:37Z,Thanks a lot Legolash2o..downloading it now...If any1 has probs with activation search for Remove WAT 2.2.6 in google
,adnan904,2011-01-22T08:06Z,thanks legolash2o for this awesome release...
,GeorgeWest,2011-01-22T20:59Z,Am I understanding this correctly? I don't enter a product code during install and I will never need one in the future?
,wask,2011-01-24T23:03Z,People help me! I install this program on mac os through parallels! Daichi Please serial number

,Eagle|,2011-02-24T15:08Z,Is this only Service Pack or does this include windows 7?! :o
,Kira076,2011-02-26T01:13Z,"I wanna make sure before installing... Can you boot from this iso? I'm setting up a new computer, fresh harddrive, so I want to make sure I get a version that can be booted from instead of an upgrade style through another OS."
