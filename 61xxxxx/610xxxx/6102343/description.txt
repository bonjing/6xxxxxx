Icon Collection Pack 2011 (5296 icons) [InterlinkKnight]

All kinds of icon images (computers, laptops, phones, printers, brands, recycle bins, cars, sports, flashdrives, etc.) for windows (ICO), no PNG files.

Most of these icons where extracted from other collections packs (especially from torrent). The difference is that I rename most of the icons to something with more sense, and I delete the repeated icons. Some other icons are made by myself or as been collected from softwares, OS, websites, games, etc. by myself.

Whatâ€™s new compared to the previews version? 533 new icons, dozens of icons re-named for corrections, and also a few repeated icons have been deleted.

Every year I upload a new version with more icons and corrections so you can report any mistake to make the next version better.

If you have the previous pack version, I recommend replacing it for this one. It still has the same icons, although you may find that some icons were renamed compared to the previous versions.

You can also download this file directly (without torrent) from my website:

Enjoy.
