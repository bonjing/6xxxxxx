CE UNIVERSE - This boxed set comprises all of The Beatles' EP's as they were originally issued on 45rpm vinyl in England. Each 4 song CD-5 has been digitally remastered from original sources. The set comes with a 32-page Magical Mystery Tour book. All selections are mono except the stereo "Magical Mystery Tour" EP. The Beatles' impact on popular music is inestimable. They changed the face of rock & roll, introducing new concepts and techniques again and again throughout their career, influencing both their contemporaries and the next several generations of rock & roll. In the early '60s, when the golden age of Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis had given way to prefabricated teen idols and bland, diluted versions of real rock & roll and R&B, the Beatles' brash, effervescent blend of '50s vintage sounds and bold, electric pop saved the world. Not content with reviving rock & roll almost single-handedly, the Beatles continued to innovate. Borrowing a bit from John Lennon's hero Bob Dylan, they pioneered the progression from generic love songs to more personalized, introspective subject matter. Let loose in the studio, they were among the first in the pop world to use backwards tapes, feedback and exotic instrumentation (George Harrison's well-documented love affair with Indian music inspired a thousand sitar-infested pop tunes). Lennon & McCartney (and occasionally Harrison) were phenomenally gifted tunesmiths who merged a pre-rock harmonic vocabulary with R&B influences and a visionary streak to create a timeless body of work. 
The Beatles: John Lennon (vocals, guitar); Paul McCartney (vocals, bass); George Harrison (guitar); Ringo Starr (drums).

www.rarebeatles.com - Released in 1992, this well-designed 15-EP CD box set faithfully reproduced all of the 14 original British EP releases, and even added a bonus EP. Each of the CD's were digitally remastered and enclosed in jackets using the original cover art and sleeve format. The double-CD Magical Mystery Tour EP included a disc each of both mono and stereo versions of the 6 songs, plus the entire 28 page booklet. The sets were released in Great Britain May 26th (CDBEP 14), in Japan June 10 (EMI/Odeon/Apple TOCP-7101-15), and in the USA June 30th (Apple/Capitol C2-15852). Some USA sets include UK manufactured CD's. A nice addition for any Beatles collection.
