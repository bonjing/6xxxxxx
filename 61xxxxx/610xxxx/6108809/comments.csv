Since there are no screens links, would it be possible to u/l the pics without them zipped so we can preview what these are w/o having to get the entire set of pics?  

I mean, it's half a GB of data d/l just to view 10 pics, one from each, taking traffic from peers when it might be deleted later due to not being wanted.  Thanks again."

Adding the pictures unzipped is a good idea, I'm going to do that."
