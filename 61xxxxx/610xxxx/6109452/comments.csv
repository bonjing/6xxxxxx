,PirateJFK,2011-01-18T23:09Z,and is crashing xp or virtual pc?
[T],nobody2007,2011-01-19T23:38Z,"Virtual PC is running on PPC only. Intel based Macs are NOT supported.

According to a Microsoft manager, the adaptation of Virtual PC for Mac to the Intel platform is a great effort would have meant the product was dropped with the release of Intel Macs.

Da nach Aussage eines Microsoft-Managers die Anpassung von Virtual PC fÃ¼r Mac an die Intel-Plattform einen zu groÃŸen Aufwand bedeutet hÃ¤tte, wurde das Produkt mit Aufkommen der Intel-Macs fallengelassen."
,PirateJFK,2011-01-22T04:25Z,Exactly 2007 thanks.
,benjinumber9,2011-02-05T22:39Z,"I got past step one and onto step two, then it asks to put in the cd and I open the 2nd .img and nothing happens. I've tried re-installing it and the same thing happens. I have a G4 powermac with a PPC processor. The virtual switch didn't work but I don't think that has anything to do with my problem?"
,PirateJFK,2011-02-18T18:00Z,"@ benjinumber9

unmount the first image then mount the second.

or burn to a disc but again make sure the first image is unmounted. ""ejected"""
,dipakbhtt,2011-03-11T08:18Z,same problem as benjinumber9 asking for installation disc 2 any solution PirateJFK ???

,iServer,2011-04-23T02:35Z,"PirateJFK

I really need to install this software but I have the same problem, The installation not recognize the CD 2. I tried mounting the Disk 2, burning the disk etc... any suggestion?"
,ebm2011,2011-08-04T00:43Z,Ok everyone this totally works. Here is what you do. Mount the 2nd and 3rd image first. It makes the system think you have the disc installed already. Then mount the 1st image and follow the instructions. And both serials still work as of today 8/3/2011. I have it up and running on a G5 10.5.8
