SUMMARY

The year is 1926, 8 years after the conclusion of the Great Demon War. Tokyo, imperial capital of Japan, has risen to prominence and prosperity under the power of steam. But even after the warâ€™s end the battle with the demons rages on, and cities across the globe have need of special teams to counter the threat. In Tokyo, that special team is the Imperial Operetta Troupe. When these lovely ladies of the theater arenâ€™t staging plays, theyâ€™re staging assaults on demons as the Flower Division of the Imperial Fighting Troupe. Their special spiritual abilities qualify them alone to pilot steam-driven steel armors known as Koubu.[/code]
