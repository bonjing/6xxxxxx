bit how do i install the other?"
,gurmsin,2011-01-15T00:27Z,"I think you can't install both avast antivirus and Internet Security, because antivirus is included in Internet Security. In other words, just install Internet Security for complete protection of your computer. This is at least the case for Norton Internet Security 2011, which I use currently. "
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-15T01:46Z,"@sveinparty1 

avast! Internet Security includes avast! Pro Antivirus, but also it includeds a firewall.
That's not hard to find out, cause it's also mentioned in the torrent description.
Only complete idiots and people who don't read will try to install both. "

[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-18T23:49Z,"@MAX_32 
The ashBase.dll file did not get infected suddenly, but apparently it's been added 
to some virus databases.

It's not that hard to think logical, if you just try to use your brain and read.


@noOrp 
One of the previous cracked ashBase.dll files was also detected as a virus.
As written in the install notes, it's just a false positive if it gets detected."

[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-19T09:17Z,"@donx009 

Just read and learn about false positives. In the future avast will probably add each cracked Ashbase.dll to their virus database, so be prepared."
,DeathIsUnknown,2011-01-19T10:13Z,"@RobbingHood

Thanks for the upload, but I find it impossible to end the 2 processes (AvastUI.exe and AvastSvc.exe) via Task Manager. And before you ask, yes... I ran it as an admin. I managed to end AvastSvc.exe through Control Panel but AvastUI still remains open, not allowing me to apply the crack without a re-boot. When I do reboot, Avast detects the crack as a virus and soon removes it, causing the program to crash from the missing DLL. I have also followed your install notes to the letter, adding it to the exclusions list. Although the exclusions list only works for on-demand scans (not on-the-fly scans).

- That's my problem and most likely the one everyone else has been trying to describe. I know it's not your fault nor problem to deal with, but if you could help... WELL, THAT'D BE GREAT :D

Sorry for the GIANT comment, I just had to write it to stop all of these weak 'help me' comments.

(This is relating to Avast! Internet Security 5.1.899, not Avast! Pro)"
,Brad88,2011-01-19T11:45Z,XD peace RH i didnt mean to say that this torrent is harmful ... as you may know you're one of my idols here in TPB .. i know it's a false positive that's why i just put it in the exclusion lists of avast ... but sad to say it still detect it and still puts it in its virus chest sooner or later XD making it not work anymore because avast will prompt ashbase.dll missing ... that's why i just changed to your AVG and mbam ... it's easier to install ... and i believe that your AVG has the most seeders out of any anti-virus here in TPB ... once again peace RH :)
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-19T11:52Z,"@DeathIsUnknown

In case of problems: Disable avast avast self defense, avast shields etc, go in Safe Mode, 
paste the crack into the install directory, exclude the crack in avast, reboor in Normal Mode.
Something like that should work, cause it works for everyone else.

It's not the first time that avast detects the ashBase.dll, and it's not the first time
that people think that the problem cannot be solved. People should learn to use their own 
brain first instead of asking for help or complaining. That's the best way to learn and to 
become more independent.

That's why from now on I won't reply on problems with the ashBase.dll, cause there are no problems 
with it. All the info and help is already provided if you just read and understand it."
,noOrp,2011-01-19T12:04Z,"@ RH

I know it false-positive,

but isn't there a way to ignore it ?

[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-19T13:51Z,"READ THIS IF THE CRACK IS DETECTED AND REMOVED BY AVAST (CREDITS GOES TO: locobot12):

2. Click on Expert Settings > Exclusions, and click on ""Browse"":

3. Browse to the install directory of avast (by default):
C:/Program Files/Alwil Software/Avast5

4. Add the avast folder or cracked ashBase.dll to the Exclusions list of
""File System Shield"", and make sure that all three options [R,W,E] are checked!

5. Go to Settings > Exclusion: 
http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8898_4.jpg

6. Click on ""Add"" to add the avast directory or ashBase.dll to the 
Exclusions list (by browsing, as described above):
http://www.imagedoll.com/out.php/i8899_5.jpg

Restart avast to check if avast still detects the cracked ashBase.dll.

If the above steps didnt work avast will detect the cracked ashBase.dll 
if it's started, since avast has to use ashbase.dll when starting!

* If still avast detects the cracked ashBase.dll:
- Go to Expert Settings > click on Actions > Virus, and set it to ""Ask"", 
so that avast wont auto-delete detected files:

Yeah, I edited your notes, and mentioned your name in the credits.

,seebee0509,2011-01-21T09:02Z,I've scanned ashbase.dll INSIDE the avast folder and it doesn't detect anything. I've updated the latest definition. It's weird that you guys got false positives.

da worst thing that cud happned if dis virus win32:Trojan-gen stays in your system 
is that you get pregnant, even if you're a man.

BTW: ashBase.dll detected as win32:Trojan-gen = false positive, so it's all in your head only. 


@seebee0509 
The cracked ashBase.dll was recently added to avast's virus data base.
