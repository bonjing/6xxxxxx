,ecosaturn,2011-02-09T15:28Z,Hi..just queued the Spaghetti Western TRILOGY.Finished the first one the good the bad and the ugly..but by default its playing in spanish..if i use VLC feature i can play in english but is there a to shut off the spanish keeping in my mind i would eventually be playing it through hard drive players in my HDTV..also in media player you can here spanish n english both which is quite odd n irritating.I hope the other two r not same in the trilogy.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-14T18:53Z,The first audio track is Russian; the second is English. Select audio #2. Install CCCP.
,super_mario_bros_2011,2011-04-27T18:07Z,"When I finish it, I'm gonna say if it's good or no, but thanks indeed. I'm a great fan of these movie, always wanted to watch 'em at high quality."
,superTuna,2011-05-12T10:14Z,"Thank you heaps for this high quality encode.

Sorry that some people buy a computer and then think they know everything about it then go off at people giving them free torrents because they can't figure out something as simple as playing a video and switching audio.

I just want to know one thing, why the fuck do all the idiots flock to VLC?

But once again, thanks for this brilliant torrent."
,vividh,2011-06-30T03:50Z,"I don't know which torrent is better. 

There is another torrent very similar to this. 
The link is - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6338835/The_Good__The_Bad_and_The_Ugly_[BDRip-720p-Mkv-Ita_Fra-Aac-Eng-A

Which one should I download?"

Because VLC is only for idiots. They don't have to do anything except click and watch, and if nothing comes up, they go bang around instead of working around for a solution!"
,jshityeah,2011-07-31T21:58Z,"In response to "" vividh"" Which Download? In my view, stick with this one. I'm using Handbrake to convert this file it to English as the default. I tried using Hand Brake on the file in the link you mentioned, but Handbrake didn't recognise it. I'm one of those ""idiots"" who doesn't know too much about computers, I like the KISS principle."
,acolla,2011-08-07T18:01Z,"Thank you vy much. Nice copy, great job."
,skiba_,2011-09-15T23:07Z,"English audio is there, just not working with VLC.
I'm using BSplayer and I can select english audio and subs without problems. 

Thanks"
,HerrNiIsson,2012-01-31T14:43Z,Does anyone have the NOT-EXTENDED version in good quality? The extended version sucks!
