,juanjomtzp,2011-01-17T06:10Z,"HI FOLKS!!!! THIS IS THE SOLUTION!!!!!! IÂ´M PROUD TO GIVE IT...!

I got warmed!!! after this awesome release of the Cessna C340II so I decided to buy it!!!!! $34.95 bucks spent...!!! what a really AWESOME aircraft 100% recommended is a ""MUST HAVE"" in the hangar !!! really!!!!! is amazing!!!!

Obviously and IÂ´m sorry (I wont upload my exe and even my pass and code and missing texures...) do not insist!!!!!!!!!! 34.95 bucks...is 34.95!! ok?

Before I bought it, I decided to download this ""Cessna C340II Complete"" package 
AND YES!! I CAN CONFIRM THAT F14Tomkat is or was former of the Carenado Group

I CAN CONFIRM THIS: LISTEN!!!!! A T E N T I O N
this package (RIP) is missing some textures files in the texture.xxx folders!!! and they are a little bit scrambled...and ALSOOO is missing one texture.xxx! where the xxx means a name of a texture variant... for example like ""red"" or ""VIP""

anyway, so folks! take it easy! you have 2 options, buy it as me, or wait until someone upload the missing textures that IÂ´m saying"
