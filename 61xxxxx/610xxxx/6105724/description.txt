Luxor Adventures 

Travel to the edge of time and back with the 
Ancient Egyptian gods! 

In this hidden-object adventure, follow John and Jane 
as they travel through the past to keep history intact. 

When the archaeology duo uncovers the Osiris Orb, they 
learn that the mystical Stairway to Heaven is more 
real than they had first believed. | |

Now, they find themselves tumbling through time and 
space in a race to keep the deceptive, powerhungry Seth 
Hisster from changing history forever. 

Recover a list of items misplaced in time to restore 
balance to the universe whilst collecting mystical orbs 
that will help to close the dangerous portal. 

Along the way, meet legends like Leonardo da Vinci, 
Amelia Earhart and Benjamin Franklin as they race against 
the clock to set things right.
