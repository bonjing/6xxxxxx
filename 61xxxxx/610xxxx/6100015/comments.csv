,LRN,2011-01-29T21:52Z,That doesn't make any sense! Why V-10 A-6? According to the info it's a rip from BluRay. It can't have A-6.
,Arkov,2011-02-11T22:25Z,Audio is slightly out of sync. Shifted the audio in my player (Gom) by 0.5 secs and it was fine.
,Sick3r,2011-02-16T17:52Z,Ok. VLC can sync the audio too so it's probably all good. =)
