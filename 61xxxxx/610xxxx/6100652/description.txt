The Second Chance[2006] with Romainian Subtitle

Same faith. Same city. Different worlds.

Grammy-award winning star Michael W. Smith delivers a breakthrough performance as a polished, out-of-touch pastor whose professed beliefs are tested when he teams up with a street-smart minister (jeff obafemi carr) to confront tragic circumstances in the inner city.

"It's message is simple: being a Christian requires more than just dropping a check in the collection plate every Sunday morning." - The New York Times

"Be prepared to have your heart touched and your life changed." - Janet Parshall, host of Janet Parshall's America!

"The Second Chance reminds the church to stay on track with the business of God. A timely warning to us all." - Max Lucado

"To say that I enjoyed the film is a vast understatement. I resonated with what I saw in this great piece of work. Anyone who has ever had a ministry in an inner city over an extended period of time, has encountered just about every one of the situations that came out in the film." - Tony Campolo
