People like you are jewels and gems of humanity and they should not struggle with any problems in their lifes. I don't have to mention you are a lifeline for all football lovers around the world and you sacrifice your time and efforts just to make other people happy.
Thanks again for your work and all the best!!!"

I'd like to be able to make out faces and names on shirts when I watch the game, so I know who is who. I tried finding some HD football torrents but they all want you to pay for them."
