Any chance to upload his DVD (rip) with landscape photography, please?"
,hyenas,2011-02-11T01:29Z,"First things first: thethingy, you are my hero. I always trust your torrents and they've helped me so much.

So, I've never had an issue with your torrents but when I download this one, it doesn't seem to want to work for me. Any movie files I get, I transfer to my ps3 but with this one I get a file error message. It also had trouble on my computer. 

Any ideas? This is the only Karl Taylor video of yours I'm missing and it would mean the world to get this one."
