Once again back people, i'm coming back to you now with Matt Bianco, for all doesn't know Bianco you should listen to this three of his best creations, not entirely new songs and also a tiny bit older CD but some of best music i heard in decades, listen to Yeh Yeh, best of best from the CD and my favourite, and even better when listening at a pair of active Macky loudspeakers, but this music brings also even the most antique stereo back to life, you can trust me on it..


Modern Talking CD just came in today, but uploading the tracks i mentioned, that will be tomorrow..
