This movie was the most complete waste of time anyone could possibly imagine! The story sucked, the actors was good choices, but daaah they sucked! This whole movie is the complete edition package of shit a idiot could ever dream of!
I would rather cut my head off and tie it to my genitals then see this shit ever again!!!"

,raindog33,2011-04-17T03:02Z,"I don't know what some people saw, but I thought this was an excellent film.  Good performances from James Nesbitt and the rest of the cast and a great Occult-themed British/Irish horror film. 
Thanks for share."
