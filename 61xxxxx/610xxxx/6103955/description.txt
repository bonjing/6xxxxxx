Altoist Donald Harrison gained his initial fame in the late '70s when he was a
member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, following that up by co-leading a
notable quintet with trumpeter Terence Blanchard. Although he never quite became
a poll winner or a major influential force, Harrison has always been a solid
improviser. New York Cool moves his career up a notch and is one of his finest
recordings to date. Reuniting in 2005 with bassist Ron Carter and drummer Billy
Cobham (the trio had recorded Heroes for the Nagel Heyer label in 2002),
Harrison and his sidemen constantly challenge each other, with each of the
musicians feeling free to set the direction of the performances. The repertoire
is comprised of "Body and Soul," "Harrisburg Address" (based on "I Got Rhythm"),
"Easy Living," "I'll Remember April," "Star Eyes," Ron Carter's "Third Plane"
(which deserves to become a standard), and the medium-tempo "Blues for Happy
People." The musicians feed off each other's ideas and their interplay is full
of subtle surprises and unpredictable moments. New York Cool demonstrates that
there is plenty of life still to be found in bebop standards when they are
played in creative fashion. Highly recommended.
