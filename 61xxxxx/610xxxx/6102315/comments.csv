@survey0218:
How can you say this works great if it lags?  Braid does not require a powerful machine, so if it lags then something is really wrong.  Do you want to know what that is?  Of course you do:

If you can get it to launch at all, this app lags because its NOT the app store version of Braid: its a flawed amateur Cider port of the Windows version which has been circulating for a couple of years.  It was a lame attempt to get this app running on the Mac when a native Mac version was not available.  And if you cant figure that out, you dont deserve the real thing.  So DroidIP is either an idiot or a damn liar.  (And what do you expect from some fool who is pretending to be a cracked warez group by re-releasing old broken Windows ports when a native Mac version is already available.)

What we have here is a dumb shit posting trash for other dumb shits to consume.
