I caught a few minutes of it at my senior citizen father's house tonight.  

He proclaimed that the tucson shooting of a congresswoman marks the end of the liberal left and their violent rhetoric.

This is a guy that said people he disagreed with should be taken out back and shot in the head!  Really?

This guy and his followers live in an alternate universe where pulling shit out of your ass makes it real."
