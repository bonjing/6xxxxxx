From homeless and booze to glowing reviews a legend on the streets of Decatur, Georgia, the hard-luck blues musician fulfills a lifelong dream by capturing 'Lightnin' in a Bottle' on his recording debut for Backspace Records. Frequently down but never out, the self-taught singer and guitarist captures the humor and hurt of an authentic blues lifestyle that includes battling drugs, alcohol, loss of family and homelessness. Guitar Red (Billy Christian Walls) is the real deal, a 'busker' who spends most mornings on E. Court Square, where he frequently plays for hours. On a good day, he goes to sleep with a pocketful of tips. But not every day is a good day. No matter. For Red, it's all about authenticity, staying true to who he is. That sort of integrity, not to mention a spirited roller coaster ride of humor and hurt, shines through on the 11 tracks of 'Lightnin' In A Bottle', which he recorded live (with the exception of a guitar solo and clavinet piece) at Backspace Records studio in December 2007.
Best new blues artist & best debut album, 2008.
