This is only with some movies though.....please help..thanks"

,SupremeClientele,2011-01-17T21:41Z,"I've been searching for your uploads, thanks for this. Your ups are the closest thing to retail that I can burn to dics with no problem to play in my bluray. A 10 V10 from past ups, I'm sure this is no different."
,bubuloimare,2011-01-19T18:38Z,"Is OK 100% 
my media player  Dune HD Base 3.0 read as iso-bd"
,SupremeClientele,2011-01-24T19:19Z,"I got the same message as frosty about 30 mins into the movie, playing it on my ps3 and this is the first time I got this with any of your DL's"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-24T20:28Z,"frosty2k11/SupremeClientele - The Cinavia watermark is applied to all movies that are produced or distributed by Sony Columbia now, and it is impossible to remove by re-encoding, so if you are using a PS3, any version that you download will have it unfortunately.

You can try this (works for some, not others):  www*youtube*com/watch?v=2Htgh9L87XY (replace the stars with periods)"

,lvnitup,2011-03-05T06:50Z,"hi i need help, i'm a bit new to this, i downloaded the the torent and tried burning it with ImgBurn but their is no BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders (as per instructions), only a ISO file? so add the ISO file instead but the disk shows nothing on the disc after the burn but is no longer a blank disc. i've also tried mounting it on MagicISO and it says ""Windows cannot read from this disk. The disk might be corrupted, or it could be using a format that is not compatible with Windows.""
any tip from anyone as it is doing my head in!"
,Tomdaboy,2011-03-09T05:49Z,"@lvnitup read the description, get PowerISO to mount the image."
,AtotehZ,2011-03-18T19:31Z,"I've tried 2 different emulators (alcohol 120% and daemon tools lite), but they both say that the image is damaged... and 2 different players with *.iso supported(vlc and mpc) they both launch fine but the timeline is wrong and nothing is happening on screen... 

whats going on?"
,AtotehZ,2011-03-18T19:41Z,i've tried poweriso as well now.. do i really need to redownload this?
,curlymgee,2011-04-01T22:29Z,"HD-R-US, Thanks for the upload but I've burned this onto 2 dvd's and they play fine up until nearly halfway, then it freezes and wont work again unless I skip to near the end. I've never had this problem before, the only thing I'm doing different is, I'm now using a blu ray player. Thanks again though :("
,Ryankleynhans,2011-04-14T08:26Z,@AtotehZ I have the same problem??? can someone please help?
,Ryankleynhans,2011-04-20T11:23Z,"Ok determined that this is fake, try and prove me wrong!"
