About the Artist (Pierre MassÃ©)

Born in Toronto, Ontario, I spent my childhood between France and Canada, discovering the musical cultures of both through my father's vinyl and CD collection, eventually building my own tastes which would come to greatly influence me when I started writing my own music around the age of 14. My first mini-album/EP "Situations" came out in April 2010, and is available on iTunes and other places online, including on a pay-what-you-want basis at pierrotechnique.bandcamp.com. Continuing musical collaborations are sure to produce new releases so stay tuned... More info available at my website massemusic.com and follow me on Facebook and Twitter :)

Hope you enjoy the musicâ€¦

Cheers, Pierre.
