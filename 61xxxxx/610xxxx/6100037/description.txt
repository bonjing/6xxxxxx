[b]My personal rip from the HDDVD. You have spanish subs.
This is a must see comedy!!!! The scene where Peter Lorre try to "place" a ring for Hope to "find" is memorable. I'll guarantee that you'll laugh so hard that you'll fall from the chair :)[/b]

[QUOTE]Baby photographer Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) is mistaken for a private eye; when an attractive brunette (Dorothy Lamour) hires him to find a missing person, he doesnâ€™t mind going along with the fantasy. The director is reunited with Hope for, not a sequel to My Favorite Blonde (1942), but a spoof of all the film-noir thrillers of the period, with the star as a less-than-brave gumshoe who has a wisecrack for every dangerous situation heâ€™s in. Hope is funny and the movie well-paced, even though the story is for the birds. Straight-faced supporting performances by the likes of Peter Lorre help.[/QUOTE]
