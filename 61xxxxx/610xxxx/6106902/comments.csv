That should be a giveaway on what language... LOL"
[T],despo1ler,2011-01-17T15:19Z,so how about you finish seeding this torrent? been stuck at 88% for hrs now :(
,moonwhale,2011-01-17T17:03Z,"Merge it with the other King of thorns torrent same size. just stop it, rename folder and file . then start other torrent. I was also stuck at 88% got the rest.
Ill see if I can get the missing parts out in this one."
,moonwhale,2011-01-17T21:18Z,"Great success! That was fun.. Took some time.. but now the remainding 12% is available. and well distributed..  fun to see it go from 1seeder  to 500 within a few minutes..  bittorrent is awesome tech.
Yaaaarrrrrrr"

I've been trying to move my bittorrent seeds over to utorrent to keep uploading, that's been a thankless chore but I know people will appreciate it in the end. :D"

Just a quick question, well two actually.
You advised to replace the old installation data with the new DVD crack info, but I'm not sure where I'm supposed to install?
Alternatively, if I could ask, when I burn the RLD-FB11 fil, should I burn as an ISO data file or do I need to extract the info first then burn it to DVD?

Not sure how this works for responding so my email is ninjawhelk@yahoo.co.uk

Thanks"
