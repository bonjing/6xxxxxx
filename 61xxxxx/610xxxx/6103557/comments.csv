the question is.... how is it ensured that people who learn ethical hacking... do not end up using it for unethical reasons??... because if it isn't ensured, then it seems like a strange thing to me. What do you say?"""

,alis4210,2011-05-19T02:07Z,"@philanthropic1989:

All of this is a ""course"" in Ethical Hacking. At the start of this course all candidates are required to sign an agreement where they agree to respect the knowledge acquired and not misuse it in any way.

Besides, most people who are just out to cause harm will be discouraged by the amount of work you have to put in to become a CEH. Not to mention the price."

,canagprm,2012-01-01T20:05Z,"@philanthropic1989 ""Hackers"" don't need an Ethical hacking DVD to being with. This DVD is created mostly based on knowledge they have created. The individual using the knowledge on this DVD for evil or unethical reasons sounds an idiot or noob to me.

The information here is mainly to counter cyber attacks."
