Here are all 7 Harry Potter books (American) in EPUB and MOBI. The books include the chapter illustrations, tables of contents, and covers. They have been formatted for easier viewing on e-readers, i.e. letters and articles have been italicized instead of block quoted, and content normally in tables has been linearized.

They have been tested on both the Kindle and the iPad.
