Black Market Ministry- Voices of the Coming Plague (2009)

This is the part where bands inform you, the listener/reader, about how the band formed and what they are "about." It's usually an autobiography, and once I read one of these literary masterpieces, I can't help asking myself, "Is this what the band really think of themselves, or is this what they want me to think of them?" It's both. You have to believe the lie in order for it to be swallowed. At least somewhat.
