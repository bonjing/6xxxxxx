Make sure you move the crack into the ImTOO directory, then run crack, then run program, register use any name and any 40 digit license code say for eg. 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 "

,TheNiceGu14,2012-05-24T03:39Z,"Great, it's working! Thx locobot12 for another great torrent, for people having installation probleme do this :
- Install
- Move the crack in the directory /ImToo/Iphone Transfer
- Run the crack as administrator
- Be sure that the programme is not running
- Patch!
- Run the program
- Write any user name
- Write a 40 degit license code
- Activate
-It should work propely, It did for me!

thx ScottDelta for these information!"
