Bob Dylan - The Times They Are A-Changin' (2005 Remaster) LOSSLESS (XLD-FLAC) [Fixed - no longer stops at 99 percent]

Released: January 13, 1964

Dylan's third studio LP, released Jan. 13, 1964, was his first to feature all original compositions. This is the album that solidified his perception as a "protest singer" (a label he quickly rejected). It's darker and lacks the levity and diversity found on his previous releases, but it's still a fine record. Of course the title track was a big hit, serving (whether Bob wanted it to or not) as one of folk music's anthems for the Civil Rights movement and for the hope that the world wasn't coming to an end.
