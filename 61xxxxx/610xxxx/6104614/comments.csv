,VicVega,2011-02-25T17:01Z,"I'm downloading it because it was just mentioned on CSI :) Btw the sound is 3.3 seconds out of sync and IVTC is bad here and there. Not too bad, but I'll get the DVDR instead."

,tweakmode,2011-11-10T04:58Z,"it didnt work for me, on neither PS3 Media Server nor did it work thru k-lite's bundled Media Player Classic. I will try and re-download, and then post back whether it worked tha 2nd time but i doubt it. tha sample worked fine, but tha main movie didnt."
,gnewube,2012-01-31T08:28Z,"tweakmode: You shouldn't have to redownload completely - if you just right-click the torrent in uTorrent, and stop it, then right-click and select re-check, it should determine if any parts are bad and re-download just those parts. Presumably similar options in other clients(?) Plus I've heard there's a codec or two(?) that won't play on the PS3 media server because it blocks the content due to copyright issues. Trust Sony to do something like that.

VicVega: if some say it's ok, and you have issues like the 3.3 seconds out of sync, you could just be having codec issues... try VLC or uninstall/reinstall certain codecs. (presumably whatever ones this movie is encoded in)"
