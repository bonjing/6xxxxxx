,divxclub,2011-04-08T04:24Z,Currently Downloading. According to poster it's side by side image (AKA 3D Glasses are needed to watch this) SO I Assume this is 3D. Guys I've posted in few releases this question so may be someone have and or can release a new Hubble 3D full 1080p rip in 3D because I hear it's totally amazing !

and yes this is 3d with shutter glasses"

,rajin.33,2011-08-05T20:54Z,is it possible to watch this without the glasses? is it watchable if your tv isnt a 3d ? or will it look like crap?
