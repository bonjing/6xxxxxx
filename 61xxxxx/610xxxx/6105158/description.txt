Amazon.com Review
The popularity and credibility of charismatic news anchor Tom Brokaw 
ensured bestseller status for The Greatest Generation, Brokaw's homage 
to the Americans who survived and overcame the depression and World 
War II. The Greatest Generation Speaks expands his thesis that we owe 
a huge debt of gratitude to those tough and courageous men and women 
for ensuring the freedoms and comforts that Americans enjoy today. Their 
stories, culled from letters, interviews, and personal histories of 
the Greatest Generation and their family members, are anecdotal but 
extremely powerful, showing how men and women were sustained by simple 
ideals of patriotism, family, and fair play. This individualistic portrait 
is exactly how Americans saw themselves: Brokaw's book is a valid reflection 
of the times.

During a period of economic hardship and in a country united by the 
war effort, choices were simple; few people questioned why America was 
fighting Germany and Japan. Adversity brought out the best, especially 
in an optimistic culture like America's. As the soldier who found Beethoven's 
pianos in a Weimar house says after his unit is shelled, "Nothing like 
a close call to make the morning more beautiful." The greatest impression 
that war veterans seem to carry back from war is a sense of comradeship 
that, in spite of pain and loss, render their war years the most rewarding 
of all their life experiences. Modern life doesn't necessarily have 
the same certainties. The Greatest Generation Speaks is a healthy reminder 
of the foundations on which American society is built. --John Stevenson-

From Publishers Weekly
Brokaw's TV anchorman voice is deep and reassuring, with a remarkable 
air of patriarchal authority. With so much puff-chested attitude, he 
launches into this tape's introduction, explaining that the letters 
and comments contained came to him in a responsive outpouring in reaction 
to his book The Greatest Generation, which chronicled the varied experiences 
of World War II veterans. For him, these missives expressed a shared 
sense of "values," since lost in American life. The material itself 
is far less posturing, mostly clear-eyed remembrances from former soldiers, 
medics, clergy and reporters who served in Europe and Asia. From the 
home front come stories from women munitions workers, war widows and 
war orphans. Finally, the author tells of making efforts to reunite 
parties long-ago separated by tragic events. Here, the matters described 
move vividly into the present, giving the program a sense of real drama 
and pathos. Based on the 1999 Random hardcover.
