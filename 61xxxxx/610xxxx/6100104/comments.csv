comment 2 - your mod belongs over at Fallout New Vegas Nexus or some other dedicated mod site. That way it can be evaluated and compared to other mods as well as tested for durability. No-ones perfect - especially with any Fallout mods, considering how buggy the games are in the first place. Good Luck."
,Testiklees,2011-01-16T20:22Z,220kb... No that sounds totally legit... 
,deathtard,2011-01-26T05:37Z,@Testiklees  if it is actually a mod .esp/.esm mod plugin file so 220kb is not too odd.  What is odd though is that I couldn't find this mod on NVNexus...  Why would someone make a mod and chose to make a torrent and put it on TPB instead of putting it on a dedicated NV mod site...  I smell something fishy.

,iztari,2011-01-28T12:35Z,"A new version is available at:

,mrpras,2011-01-30T11:06Z,"Forget this idiot go to the real site

http://www.newvegasnexus.com/

What is the point of taking one mod (out of the thousands available for free) and posting it on a pirate site?"
