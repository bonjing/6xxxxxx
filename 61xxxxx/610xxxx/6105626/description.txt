Until such time as when there might be a decision to release this greatest 
of British genre movies onto bluray for at least a 720p offering to bring you
here, We hope you will find this offering here will tithe you over as it were.

It is sad that Greta scacch - perhaps the greatest actress who has ever filled
the big screen has missed out on so much of what was her due in respect of fame
and fortune - as it appears she has too many that are envious of her greatest
human spirit of the most magnificent beauty known to man. She is in fact equally
Germanic and Italian on her beauty. Lets make more of this genre shall we! 
No sense hiding her movies away by refusing to make them available as the
American studio bureaucrats have done for decades now. No justification for such
inane arrogance from the Bill Gates mindset and its time they didn't have a say
in such grave matters of human concern I say! Not if they are this stupid, huh!

This movie tells a great tale, has some sexy scenes (real steamy I'd say!)
nice courtroom drama, and supreme British culture in the charms of Diana
Calswell (Lady Broughton) as played by Ms. Greta Scacchi.

Directed by Mr. Michael Radford, also starring Mr. Charles Dance
Sarah Miles, Joss Ackland, Ray McAnally, Hugh Grant and John Hurt

Its my most favorite movie offering of all that is British I have to say
without a doubt!
