,Manualist,2011-01-13T16:57Z,"Thanks for these! Shame you won't do Skins, though. I tell you man, you'll be missing half of your life without watching it. T__T"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-13T17:04Z,"Thanks.

@doyll: Nope."
,Killjoy88,2011-01-13T17:06Z,"Thank you so much for Cougar Town.. 

Wondering though - Did Friday Night Lights not get enough thanks last week to stay in your schedule?... shame.. Oh well, thank you again for your efforts!"
,dark_defender,2011-01-13T17:26Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for your encodes and uploads.

I recently came across a Japanese SAMURAI movie series ""Lone Wolf and Cub"". It has six titles in it. I am pasting a link of one possible source

http://torrentz.eu/5208925046d527d8e69e29d93a7394228303b959

There are another out there too.
Take a look at it and see if you can encode and upload them. Its worth watching.

I know your schedule is very tight but if you would need some time, i am in no hurry. If you cannot, then and only then i will DL from another source.

Thanks in Advance !!! "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-13T17:32Z,"@Killjoy88: I haven't been able to get airing last night (HDD died like two days ago). Simple as that. When I get FNL, I would encode it."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-13T18:01Z,"@dark_defender: Sources are impossible to get, maybe some Japanese could get DVD for such old movies, but I cannot. None of the titles wasn't re-released nor converted for BluRay.

We are lucky if these torrents are alive and get them there."
,Killjoy88,2011-01-13T18:08Z,"@20-40

Thank you for your reply, i look forward to your encode. Bad news about your HDD though, did you have much saved on it? 
"
,abj642,2011-01-13T18:10Z,thanks 20-40 for all your efforts
,dark_defender,2011-01-13T18:58Z,@twentyforty: Can you not encode DVDrip in small sizes from the link that i provided? I know Blurays are impossible to get.
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-13T19:08Z,"@Killjoy88: Impossible to move data in sane manner - negative effect of gigantic HDD - and I would need to burn 200 DVDR (if I have them, LOL) - like non-stop for a week... it's ridiculous.

Well, you can imagine what is to loose 1 TB HDD nowadays... "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-13T19:29Z,"@dark_defender: You could assume how 1972. movies ripped to XviD look like, it's better not to touch  them.
4:3 ... black&white - re-encode NEVER turn-out good - only if someone could get DVDs and re-rip them - and I'm not crazy about Japanese cinematography from seventies anyhow."
,dark_defender,2011-01-13T22:02Z,@twentyforty: LOL..Fair enough mate. :)
,jon4fun,2011-01-13T23:12Z,"Hi 20-40,
