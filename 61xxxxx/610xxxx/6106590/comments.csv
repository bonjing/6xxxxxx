People can be manipulated into supporting things that might even be against their own self interest by using ideas and symbolism like patriotism, nationalism, racial superiority, etc.

And they don't even have to know the real purpose, just whatever emotional trigger that gets them to support it."
,PhilLesh12,2011-01-18T00:54Z,"but the people who supported GWB were actually a small percentage of the population, and they were fed lies.

Supporting something that is presented to you falsely isn't the same as wanting whatever is actually happening.

Not many people who now know the truth about our reasons for invading Iraq would support it if we had it to do over again."

Thankyou Rosie."

The fact of the matter is that enough civilians knew about what was happening, that it should never have happened in a million years!!! 

Pathetic!!!
