Anthem trance for dummies vol.1
*******************************

A well-sorted kit for anyone who wants introduction into world of good trance, while skipping hoover screaming trash such as cascada or 'dance' remixes of horrible rock bands, such as roxette. None of the tracks justify degratory "mctrance" label trance overall has earned lately.

207 tracks, ranging from vocal to progressive trance, 90-s to 2000-s, no cheap hoover-party crap. ID-tags by gracenote, album covers included where possible.
