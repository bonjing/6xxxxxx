The guys a bitch, a pansy. ""Righteous Bullshit"" is what i call it. Way too emotional, but hey its still a great anime, funny as well with a bit of romantics thrown in, This is a really good show. 4.5/5 (on account of the stupidity of some of the characters)"
,kynn1232,2011-05-21T00:33Z,This version is censored.
,xtclikeafox,2011-10-08T19:21Z,Anyone know where to download the subtitles from? can't find them anywhere. great quality though and audio synced with visuals perfectly.
