,euejusz,2011-01-29T20:19Z,nice torrent. but @cvjhvj thanks for sharing bro. downloaded mine from there too. works great. 
,loosbroos,2011-01-30T20:02Z,"i couldn't edit the hosts file either - and there was no 'open as administratos' option when i right-clicked on it either .....any ideas?
btw - if you open cs5 with internet disconnected it doesn't come up with the 'invalid serial number' screen - can use it without a problem .....a hassle but will do until i can get it cracked"
,loosbroos,2011-01-31T19:25Z,"since my comment yesterday i found a crack that works perfectly - no more 'Invalid Serial Number' messages!!!
