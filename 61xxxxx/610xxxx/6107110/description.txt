[b][u][a4e] Arc The Lad [Complete Eps 1-26] [Dual Audio] [Eng Subs][/u][/b]


[u][color=Red][b]Got this from a private tracker.

The torrent for which I have added in the folder. You may use it too.

Took me almost a week to complete this. Seeding was kinda slow.

My belief is if it were on the public tracker or atleast enable DHT it would
have been faster.

Sharing is caring SO STOP LEECHING AND SHARE BACK. If i Can share with an upload speed of 30kbps I am sure you guys can. [/b][/color][/u]

Genres: adventure, fantasy


Plot Summary: The story follows Elk, a bounty hunter in some strange futuristic

world. On this world archaic but advanced technology exists side by side with

primitive attitudes, beasts and magic. In other words it's got a bit of

everything. It also has an evil conspiracy who are able to produce powerful

monsters called chimera, who can also appear as human. Naturally it is not long

before Elk has rescued a young female beast-master and gained himself some

serious enemies.
