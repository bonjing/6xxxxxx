,RareNinja,2011-01-17T10:11Z,seems like a TC not a PPv or  TS
,InstantStarFan7,2011-01-18T04:13Z,SO why exactly is this torrent missing like 20 minutes? STUUUUUUPID don't download! 
,music.incorporated,2011-01-21T04:30Z,"thanx SAFCukO09 cause all the direct download links for this at ""fileserve"" are gone."
,shiningwiz,2011-01-24T07:45Z,"This is the best rip out there. I don't know if it really is PPV or TS or whatever, but the video and audio quality are quite good and it's well worth the download.

Warning though, the first 20 seconds or so (Bill Nighy's speech) are cut off, but it doesn't bother me."

,dj-test,2011-01-28T19:10Z,"Quality is OK, but it's cut on top and bottom, so you see like half of the heads very often. I recommend watching TS, if you don't want to wait for R5 or DVDRip."
,puppyup,2011-02-03T10:06Z,More than 20 minutes are missing.
,shiningwiz,2011-02-06T08:28Z,"No, 20 minutes are not missing. The film is complete except for - as I've said earlier - the opening 20 seconds or so of Bill Nighy's speech."
,Junheart,2011-02-11T15:14Z,"v:5
a:5"
,schilsound,2011-02-12T15:54Z,"Audio and video are very very clean, however this runs just over 90 minutes and 38 seconds.

IMDB say: Runtime: 146 min.

I ain't no mathemetizer, but I can say this much- it is NOT a matching set of numbers. . . yea?"
,Valcorbb,2011-02-14T14:44Z,"Ok here's my report:

First of all, there is a part missing in the beginning. This file begins with 'Your ministry remains strong'. You can't see the part where Hermoine enchants her parents, and you can't see Harry's uncle leaving. Also, the speech of the Minister is missing for a part, like i said, you can only hear the 'Your ministry remains strong' sentence.

My rating:

Audio: 7/10
Video: 5,5/10 (too bad there is missing a part)"
,puppyup,2011-02-16T18:41Z,There's the scene missing where Hermione gets gangbanged by two trolls.
,Early_Riser,2011-02-21T02:21Z,"Thanks SAFCukO09. Video Quality is between analog and digital TV and sound is good. To all the complainers out there, if you want better, wait for a blue ray rip."
,Rod321,2011-03-01T05:41Z,"Very fast download. 
I am inclined to agree with Valcorbb that there is some missing at the start & I am not sure at the end as it comes to an abrupt stop with no ""End"" or ""Casts"" displayed.
Not worth downloading in my opinion."
,GDRip,2011-03-01T22:23Z,"One of the best prints I've seen video wise, still not PPV and its cropped a bit, you can see near the beginning when Hermione points the wand at her parents the camera moves quite a bit.  Still okay quality.

,XxxCutterxxX,2011-03-24T06:23Z,its dumb asses like you that kill download speeds. 
,KalviK3,2011-03-26T12:38Z,"Yeah, Broncos, go fuck yourself."
,dlarrym1111,2011-03-28T23:47Z,"@XxxCutterxxX and @KalviK3: you have ZERO clue of how torrents work do you. If a person chooses to limit his DOWNLOAD speed and is keeping HIS PERSONAL download speed to 5kb's per sec. It WON'T and for that matter CAN'T affect you or anyone else's download times. Did you read his comment closely, He wasn't speaking of UPLOAD speed being reduced. . .  SUCH IDIOTS speaking of things they don't know about. . . You made your own selves look stupid weather I commented or not. ANYONE that knows anything can see for themselves YOUR comments about slowing EVERYONES download speed is ridiculous!!!! So watch out, you dick is made of wood and your DADDY's tongue is made of sandpaper so it just a matter of time before you have no dick for your DADDY to nurse on. Take your mouth off your mothers tit and wipe the milk of your face so I can lay my floppy flaccid  dick on your mothers fore head and smack it on her head tell she begs me to fuck her. Then I will jam it in her eye socket and screw her skull till I blow spunk into her brain!!! LMFAO!!!!! GO drop dead you f-in LOSERS!!!!"
