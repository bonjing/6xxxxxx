almost missed that one.. very interesting. will take that too"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-17T18:08Z,"@dark_defender, r-0987, ar1990, ALL:

Taking requests is stopped till further notice.
Number of seeders is - silly.
Number of Hit&Runs is above 97% for last hundredth torrents.

Guys, none of you is to  blame. But - count how many of you have left comments - 38 altogether - and 25675 others have downloaded a file from me during last month only.

See who performs Hit&Run, predominately?

I repeat: TAKING REQUESTS IS HALTED.
"
,DMVIN,2011-01-17T18:53Z,"wow! those numbers are alarming.
come on guys, sharing is caring ;-)"
,odyssey09,2011-01-17T19:35Z,Thanks for The Cape!
,muk0690,2011-01-17T20:02Z,"I'm not gonna request anything.
Now, Im not boasting off, I have been seeding all torrents atleast to a ratio of 2. So, I postpone uploading my rips. So please seed people. The same happens with my torrents too. By seeding you get your maximum download speed for your downloads."
,r-0987,2011-01-17T20:18Z,"those number are alarming! 
will try to seed but max upload speed is 25 kbs!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-17T21:02Z,"Again, NONE of you is a problem. At least, you show up, are registered, logged in, have a ""face"".

 Try to understand that you are few, and I spoke about thousands."
,dark_defender,2011-01-17T21:41Z,"@twentyforty: We all who have a face are against hit-n-run. We appreciate and support your encodes and decisions respectively. We are with you in whatever you do. If there is anything we can do, please tell us."
,jon4fun,2011-01-17T22:03Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers
Jon

@ ALL H & R FUCKS - go away!!!
@ Seeders - thanks for sharing and keep on supporting 20-40."
,Djalma,2011-01-18T01:52Z,Thank you for The Simpsons.
,funpigj,2011-01-18T05:00Z,"thx for the Globes... I want to see what all the fuss was about.

Thx for the BBC fare as well... 
"
,neil_diamond ,2011-01-18T05:31Z,"My friend I always seed back, but lately just coming to pirate bay is a chore, with the 50 pop ups, and the virus that convinces your firewall EVERYTHINGS a threat. And the zedo pop up, and all the other bs piratebay is allowing just their advertisers to do, not to mention all the hackers who keep posting bogus uploads it's getting to be ..just..not..worth it. Then I found a private site that has everything this site has and more. No pop ups! Incredibly high download speeds. and people must maintain a decent seed ratio... or they will get banished from the site. You would be treated like a god there! if you want an invite, because it's invite, only..YOU have but to pm me."
,Ataractic,2011-01-18T06:00Z,"Thanks for The Cape. May I ask you what happened to 'Zen'?
and as far as seeding is concerned, I try to seed for a week, but after 3 days- the upload speed reduces to zero; Maybe because I take one or two shows, but sometimes it is hard to even the ratio of 1. I want o give back, but looks like there's no one to take it form me :P what to do?"
,DMVIN,2011-01-18T06:26Z,Currently I am stuck at 84% of globes done. Not even 1kb download speed. I feel very sorry for your hardwork 20-40
,skillet92,2011-01-18T06:50Z,"I am jus downloading golden globe !
I am stuck at 84.2 %!
I have seeded at around 2gb till now!

any problem wid my utorrent?"
,azrielle,2011-01-18T08:10Z,"'Tis not entirely inconsiderate yahoos, etc., 20-40.  I have used tpb intermittently since ~2006, but only in last year did I figure out how to register--and I don't consider myself technologically inept.  TPB COULD make it easier.  I HAD wanted to leave comments long before, but could not figure out how to do it--even after I registered, it was another 3 months before I saw that I could ""Write Comments""!"
,t.trikiti,2011-01-18T09:28Z,THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
,froglog,2011-01-18T10:49Z,"Hi 20-40, 
I'm stuck at 97.1%, 4 weeks + to complete, i'm seeding at about 50+ KB/s. 
Just woundered why  so slow, are people just not seeding ? "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-18T11:43Z,@froglog: 4 weeks seems like old torrent. You would never finish that - unload it - and you've got what you've got. Sorry tough.
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-18T11:50Z,"@froglog: Oh, if you mean THIS torrent shows 4+ weeks to complete - it's probably because you cannot connect to my BitTornado at 91.121.1.144. It is a must - and if you are blocked by YOUR ISP or gremlins - I can do a shit about. If you run PeerBlock - un-block me."

,froglog,2011-01-18T13:41Z,"Cheers 20-40, yes this torrent,  I have just finished downloading !, I only asked because it was unusually slow for any torrent iv ever downloaded from you in the past. peerblock is set to allow you and wasnât even on.
Looking on my Bittorrent peers list there was over 30 but not many uploading & the ones that were , had very low up speed, which was usual. 
Thank you very much & I will continual to seed.  "
,punk67,2011-01-18T15:08Z,Thanks twenty forty hope your new years going well!take care mate paul x 
,cindal,2011-01-18T15:21Z,thanks!
,neil_diamond ,2011-01-18T17:33Z,"Here's the problem in a nutshell. I wanted to watch the golden globes. Here you have it 400mb a relatively small file. I started last night around 7 pm cet. It wasn't done this morning!

I pop over to my site with...187 seeders, it's a 1.35 gb it was done in 7 minutes! 7 minutes, compared to 12 hours!! you had 1 seed available this morning, 40+ posts by people claiming to be seeders, you had 1..i'm guessing thats you.

They don't seed anymore, nobody forces them to, so THEY DON'T CARE. You can keep complaining about it, or do something about it yourself. Join our site! Right now, we have 187 seeders on that torrent itself!!

I have my download at 94% seed ratio at 3 ratio and it's telling me i have to wait another 22 minutes or so just to get that 6 % This from a guy who can DL at 2mb + per second and i'm hitting 14-16kb 2 days later? NO THANKS!"
,azrielle,2011-01-18T19:26Z,"thanks for Cape and GG.  Will try Young Justice. Dnlded Simpsons by mistake--can't stand them!  Oh well, some other guy can get it from my seed."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-18T20:27Z,"@neil_diamond: I am not to blame. You or your ISP have blocked my server.
That's nutshell.
