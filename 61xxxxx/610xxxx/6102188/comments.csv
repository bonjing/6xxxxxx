,vascalpel,2011-01-16T05:33Z,"Seriously.  Why bother uploading if you don't intend to seed.  I appreciate those that seed and probably your good intentions, but none of the torrents you put up work.  It would literally take minutes to let the larger group get these files and seed.  I am guessing you have a problem? Let us know so we can ignore your ups."
