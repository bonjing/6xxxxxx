You really should do some research before you try to create a Torrent."
,Tazadar3,2011-01-19T14:22Z,"Well actually i did, i followed ""How to create new torrent"" as written on the forums..
And there they said:
TPB automatically adds the necessary trackers, so unless you have a specific reason to add additional trackers, create the torrent without tracker URLs and upload that.

,juancha,2011-01-19T22:16Z,Working at last. Thanks uploader!
,Tazadar3,2011-01-20T01:31Z,Good to hear it works and np :)

,kamposhd,2011-01-30T22:51Z,"this is not the complet season, season 8 has 29 episodes, this is only 23, tho thanks for the tè´¸rrent"
,Tazadar3,2011-01-31T10:02Z,"Well, this torrent has as u see 26 episodes, so ur saying 3 are lacking, witch ones are those ?
(i guess i know what u mean, but keep on reading this comment ;))
I still belive there where only 26 though, coz they sendt some of the old episodes in rerun/reair last year, and someone uploaded them as ""new"" episodes and gave them ""wrong"" numbers..
Like MythBusters S08E16 Busters Cut Viewer Special Threequel wich is old episodes only with Buster pop-ups from beneath, and thats all thats ""new"" with it. Not new myths, episodes imo, so did not include those. Read comments on torrent if u want http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5708057/MythBusters_S08E16_Busters_Cut_Viewer_Special_Threequel_HDTV_Xvi"
,Stevo334,2011-03-07T04:28Z,"What amazes me is Tazdar3 has took the time to create this torrent and all I see is wingeing little pussy's bitichin' .

Dude Thanks for the Upload and F@ck the wingers."
,plibdiggle,2011-03-14T10:56Z,"@Stevo334

aint that the truth.

i wonder how many items the whining pricks have brought to the table?????

my guess is ZERO"
,axesever,2011-05-30T10:34Z,"Hate to agree with faggots, but see this: http://epguides.com/MythBusters/

There is indeed episodes missing. 

01 is from season 7. But as for the rest missing, they are specials called Buster's Cut:(blahblah) and MythBusters Top 25 Moments. 

Great torrent."
,axesever,2011-05-30T10:37Z,"MythBusters Top 25 Moments seems to be included, scratch that. But still not Buster's Cut. But honestly, those are boring anyways."
,Tazadar3,2011-06-15T08:38Z,"I do agree, but not completly, but by 90%. Boomerang Bullet was aired 4th January 2010, next episode in 2010 was aired in march (a long break all of the sudden hehe) and last in 2009 was 28 december(so the ""normal"" week between 2 episodes in same season). So logicaly its part of season 7, but by year its s8. And actually, discovery dont have the episodes in seasons at all, just split up and organized by year. And i have done the same, as said in description :)"
