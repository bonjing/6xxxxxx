For those that allready have Season 1-7
Here is complete season 8

Proper names, episodes organized from first episode in january to last in december that year.
Given episode number after the date they where aired(have used the guide on discovery.com to do this),
the episodes not shown on discoverys episode guide/list are in the right season but are called for.ex:
MB.S08Special.name.of.episode.quality.ripper(when possible).avi.
And yeah i know, some of them actually are ordinary episodes, but for some reason they where not included on Discoverys
list coz they where "Special" episodes, even though some episodes called special are included.. Oh well..
