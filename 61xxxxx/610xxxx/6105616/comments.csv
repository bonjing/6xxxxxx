@xxvalacxx
iThink its a little tilted & cropped a lot

There is a sample, why don't you try it for yourself?"

A/8 
V/7 
Fairly good quality but the picture has been cropped and there is slight focus problems here and there, still a watchable copy and the best Iâve seen... 
Many Thanx to .BONE. and TOXiC-iNK for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
