I think the Kling brothers didn't really have the tv personality that discovery probably wanted. They caused some problems with thier style of investigating, But that was the way they were, and they didn't try to pretend to be something else.

I listened to their radio show, they come across as angry and a bit bitter, but who can blame them. They did have a good show and it should have been allowed to carry on. I just don't think they should have bad mouthed other shows as being poorand getting weak evidence such as Ghost Adventures. GA do get good eveidence, better than Ghost Lab a lot of the time.  But Bagans is getting a bit carried away, calling himself a demon hunter. Anyway, thanks a lot for this."

I've heard rumors that Discovery may still be interested in Ghost Lab.  Even more rumors that other networks have shown interest with picking up Ghost Lab.  I personally think a good place for this show to be is on FX."
[T],trialNerror,2011-01-17T06:25Z,"You are right about them barking about the other shows.  That most likely will turn around and bite them in the asses.  However, like you said, they are real.  They are only speaking their opinions and the last I checked we do have a right as human beings to do that.  And there's a lot of people that have the same opinions as the Klinge brothers."
