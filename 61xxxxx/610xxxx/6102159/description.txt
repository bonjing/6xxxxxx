Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (or simply Never Mind the Bollocks) is the only studio album by the English punk rock band The Sex Pistols, a highly influential and controversial English punk rock band. Fans and critics alike generally regard the album as an extremely important album in the history of rock music, citing the lasting influence it has had on subsequent punk rock musicians and other musical genres that were influenced by such punk rock artists. In 2003, Rolling Stone named it the forty-first greatest album of all time on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

The album was released on 27 October 1977 through Virgin Records amid controversy arising from the use of the coarse slang word (in British English) "bollocks" in its title.

Older versions of most of the album's songs also appeared on a bootleg album called Spunk, which consists of demo recordings the band had made during 1976 and January 1977, and which was released shortly before Never Mind the Bollocks.
