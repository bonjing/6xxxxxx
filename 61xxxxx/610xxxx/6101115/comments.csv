[T],MelloYello,2011-01-17T03:31Z,Look at the screen shots u idiots.  Its pay per view rip.  It is a full screen.  From others I have seen the sound is usually very good.  Remember the 1st good Despicable Me was a PPV rip. That one was fine. Lol @Feetback waiting for a perfect 10.  Its a comedy not some special effects masterpiece.  Why wait?  If you wanted to see it then you would watch it.  I know i'm wasting my time but noobs get to be annoying.
