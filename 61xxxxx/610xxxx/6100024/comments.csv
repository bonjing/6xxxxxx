Intel C2Q Q8200
GT 220
2 GB RAM DDR 2 Geil 800 MHz"

,LeX-o2-15-97,2011-02-20T08:44Z,"yeah this is the moded version of gta vice city
but its pretty cool though"
,Xuz9999,2011-02-20T12:29Z,For Those Of You Wondering What This Is Its Not A New Release Its The Original Just Heavily Moded However For Some Reason The Cut Seens Audio And The Radio Audio Are Not Working I Have Checked The Setting And Still I Canât Seem To Get It To Work If Any Body Has A Solution To This It Would Be Much Appreciated As The MP3 Songs Are Crap And I Canât Play The Game With Out Audio
,mevidek,2011-02-22T10:47Z,"erm, how do you work this torrent? What exe. should I use?"
,mastoras3,2011-02-24T15:33Z,"Not worth downloading. The only different thing from the original are different vehicles, and maybe the radios but I coulnt listen anything on my pc."
,slaiciprian,2011-02-25T09:20Z,"This is GTA Vice city moded. (Cars is changed, but her names, not)
Hellicopter is OZN, hidden object is a lollipop... :-(
Ugly version, but game is stable, no errors."

,cropirate101,2011-03-09T18:37Z,@strandstrand explain what is this game exactly. a moded vice city or what?
,Soneryy,2011-03-11T19:53Z,"THIS GAME IS JUST PERFECT! BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL VERSION! The cars are changed(all the ugly cars are now cool, they are mostly new model cars and fast) + more things like new buildings and stuff... 
But I have 2 problems.
1) I see that you changed the helicopter to something like a jet or something but it just glitches when i wan't to fly with it, it just scrapes on the floor like an spasmed animal and then explodes.
2) Also the mini-helicopter thats in a mission doesn't work either, the same problem happens. the mission were you need to put bombs in a building. You changed in a satellite to make it look cooler but it glitches too and you can't fly with it, I just can't take it under control, it doesn't respond to my commands and does what it wants to do. I REALLY NEED THIS TO BE FIXED OR THE GAME IS JUST USELESS TO PLAY, BECAUSE THAT MISSION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH, AND YOU JUST EVEN CAN'T MAKE PROGRESS IN THE GAME, I GOT STUCK AND ITS SO BORING NOW.

PLEASE HELP I APPRECIATE IT ;D"
,ali123eng,2011-03-12T23:03Z,sicckkkk thanks dude
,xiIix,2011-03-15T09:29Z,"This is pointless. It's much better to mod the game yourself and add the content you want. You can add or change any cars, people, buildings, textures, anything. And the best part is that when you mod it yourself, you don't have to worry about it not working, because it will, because YOU modded it. It's so easy. Just go to the GTA modding sites they have everything you need."
,rockyfan12,2011-03-15T14:53Z,thnx
,Ni-Y-az,2011-03-15T20:11Z,"If there this torrent is modified gta vice city what kind of modifications are there?
