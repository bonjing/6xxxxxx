NO thanks? NO seeding!

It's the Zack Files!! Season two is seeded for the FIRST time EveRRRR!

it's bilingual, in Catalan  (sorry, not Spanish) and English but the Catalan is pretty awful.
The boys (and Katie too) are all done by  really old female voice actors and they sound as fake as a sane Republican.

The show itself is wonderful

There are 36 (THIRTY SIX!!!) other tv shows with an episode named Blast From the Past
