Storyline: It's the year 2035, and the community now has the help of robots.
These robots have three laws integrated into their system. One, they cannot harm a human being or, through
inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Two, they must do whatever they're told by a human being as
long as such orders don't conflict with law one. Three, they have to defend themselves as long as such defense
doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently
jumps out of the tenth-floor window of U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe
that he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the
number one suspect is a Nestor Class-5 robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then that
means he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now
discover the truth before it's too late.
