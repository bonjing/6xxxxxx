If you find those nascar races running in circles interesting... you may find that movie mildly entertaining. :-("
,bilper,2011-01-16T17:22Z,"Stock car racing was the offspring of the southern moonshine distribution network. To stay one step ahead of the revenuers a man would enhance the performance of his car by any means necessary.

If you already no this then there is no reason to watch this movie unless you are having trouble sleeping. This is one of the most boring movies  I have ever seen."
,mikebellski,2011-01-16T22:24Z,Jesus I really gave it a fair shot but it was so boring. It's like a cross between the Waltons and some after school special
,travis20,2011-01-19T00:35Z,"This is an excellent quality picture and sound, however,  the movie must have been made by a new or 3rd rate producer. It is very slow, doesn't really go that much into depth about the moonshine business, and just gives a general idea about how the racing industry started.  It would have been a lot more interesting if they showed more about the moonshine. "

,SHRUDE,2011-02-13T07:30Z,"Great movie, thank!

@ictv

Are you nuts?
How can an Historic movie based on the facts of the origins of Stock Car racing be in any way similar to the crap Days of Thunder was in it's Glitz and Tom cruise bullshit glamour?

The comparison is as weak as your feeble mind."
