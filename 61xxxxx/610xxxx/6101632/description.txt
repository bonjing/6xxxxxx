I have created this torrent as they said that my iso\'s will be deleted within 7 days and i just wonted to share this =)

Info

OpenSUSE 11.3 Server Edition
x86 (32 bit OS)
Squid 3 (3.0.STABLE25-2.1.1)
lighthttpd (Web http) (customize your own error pages)
iptables
clamav & clamav-db (Anti-Virus)

When the server reboots i have created a script whenever the appliance boots so you will always have an up to date malware list thanks to http://www.malware.com.br/lists.shtm
