Heck, if you make it a boot disc using image burn then remove office, update windows then re-install office. It's not that hard.

1) Download this and save it
2) You need Nero Burning ROM or Some CD/DVD burning software
3) Run Nero Burning ROM
4) Go to 'Recorder' in the Menu bar of Nero Burning ROM
5) Choose 'Burn Image'
6) A window pops out and you choose the ISO file of MS Office (this download)
7) Then click on 'Ok'
8) Burn it to CD or DVD
9) After successfully burning you can insert that CD or DVD and run MS office to install it on your PC
