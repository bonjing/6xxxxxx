This CD shreds! Europe has finally put it all together and made their first complete album that is good from start to finish since "Final Countdown." The guitar solos are great and the vocals are steady but less stellar than "Final Countdown." What makes this album is the production. I also thought the production was pretty good on "Start From the Dark," but none of those songs had hooks. These new songs do have the hooks, and better lyrics than any other album in this genre to come out all year. After years of having Nickleback and Godsmack jammed into my face, this is a breath of fresh air. People would be wise to revive this genre of rock music, because there is more going on in this world that teen angst and breaking up with a girlfriend. Take the modern alt.rock/emo/screamo bands and ship them to Siberia, and bring Europe back full force in the United States!
