,WwDesiz,2011-01-17T17:12Z,lolz Simon5000 stop crying be happy with what u get for free stupid.. u dont see me cryin i got a 60 inch LX900 jus enjoy
,balanced,2011-01-18T00:21Z,"I don't really think that just because something is free means you shouldn't try to make it to be as good a quality as possible.  If you volunteer your time down at the soup kitchen do you do a half-assed job or do you do it right?  Nothing's worth doing if you don't do it with the highest quality in mind - regardless of the price.  No wonder there's so much sh*t out there people think there's actually times when you should just accept sh*t.  Total garbage, I say."
,Lemberg,2011-01-18T10:55Z,"Balanced, you don't seem very balanced. You seem frustrated.
This quality is just as fine as anyone should hope for. Looks fine on my 16 inch screen. There are people who feel guilty just owning a computer because of what the use of billions of computers (which is just the tip of the iceberg) does to the environment.
There are people in the third world aware of what the west is doing to the planet and their environment, who eat every other day, but are full of hope, appreciate life, play ball and have loving people all around them, while the rich in the west are frustrated and angry and yell curses at each other over things like the visual quality on their 80 inch wide-screen nuclear-consuming plasma screens, and never seem to be satisfied due to the lack of love and unity, which has been replaced by pods and pads and gadgets alike whose amounts of electricity-consumption make our bodies tense and our minds stressed."
,balanced,2011-01-18T12:36Z,"Lemberg I don't really care what you do.  The point of the matter is to do it right.  360p is NOT 'as fine as any one could hope for'.  I believe that description goes to 1080p right about now.  So whether you got nothing but a rock to kick around or you need to fuel your 80inch nuclear power 3D HD television try and do it with some style, passion, and striving toward better quality.  Otherwise take your fucking rock and just go home because really, what's the point of anything less?"
,balanced,2011-01-18T12:41Z,"Also - last night someone *did* put the 720p version up but not even an hour later TBP page was 404'd.  HOwever I was lucky enough to grab it and for those of you who don't settle for less here is the magnet link:  magnet:?xt=urn:btih:5e91d2035d08fbed7baa19541b0c3e661af0b111&dn=The+Simpsons+S22E11+720p&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%2Fannounce

There, Lemberg - that's doing it right."
,siicboii17,2011-01-18T20:19Z,fucking yanks 1st shameless now skins get ur own shit
,7r0j4n,2011-01-19T00:01Z,"I stand with balanced, anything less than 720p is for the blind, but the mainstream doesnt care or know about anything higher than sd.

also contributors to tpd need to step up with the hd, this is sdtv not hdtv."
,erkiloerki123,2011-01-21T14:37Z,niiiiiceee
,paradox.On,2011-01-22T11:34Z,"i would also appreciate an 720p version. this just doesnt look that good on big screens.

,karlfunk,2011-01-26T23:16Z,"Okay, this is shit. Why no 720p?"
,stOneskuL,2011-01-31T22:17Z,"""if you want something done properly, do it yourself"""
,stOneskuL,2011-01-31T22:21Z,buy the blu-ray or do it yourself.. whining and abusing because someone else isn't serving you is petulant and noxious.
,VOFE,2011-02-07T20:24Z,"Thank you! Looks REALLY GOOD on my 120"" projector screen. Very BALANCED picture, should I say? Really, thanks!"
,unloadedfirearms,2011-11-25T17:49Z,"it's a fucking cartoon guys...you've got quality issues with a free cartoon?  get over it and start seeding some high quality shit. show us how it's done balanced!  Whenever I read any comments about anything on the web, I don't know whether to puke or cry at the level of humans these daze."
,Cheyenne-tgy,2012-02-06T15:37Z,thanks.
