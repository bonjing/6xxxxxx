ESET Smart Security Home Edition Key benefits

Protects you from the unknown - Our Award-winning ThreatSenseÂ® technology uses various specialist techniques, including heuristics, in order to detect the latest and upcoming threats providing you with the most effective protection possible. This combined with our firewall ensures your safety not only from viruses but also unwanted hackers and intruders.

Keeps your machine running faster for longer - ESET Smart Security 4 is lightning fast, so fast you won't even notice it's there. Even disk-intensive operations like performing a "full disk scan" or using a firewall runs smoothly in the background without affecting your computer's speed.

Improves computer performance - ESET Smart Security 4 is "lean and mean," typically using just 45 MB of memory - a fraction of what other products consume. Because it's fast and "light," switching your existing Internet Security to ESET Smart Security can literally be like buying a new computer. Plus laptop users will also benefit from extended battery life thanks to our new automatic energy-sipping battery mode.

Finds malware other AV companies have let in - Typically when a new copy of ESET Smart Security 4 replaces another Internet Security product on a computer our software finds viruses or malware resident on the machine that were undetected by their previous product. Use our free online scanner here to check your computer for viruses.

Time-saving Firewall â€“ The new Learning Mode saves time by automatically creating firewall rules by observing how you use your computer, while offering advanced firewall modes for advanced users.

Upgraded Antispam â€“ ESET Smart Security now takes care of annoying spam with a smaller, faster and even more effective spam filter.

Smarter scanner â€“ Threats don't always enter your computers in ways you expect.

Clean and safe Email â€“ Email scanning for Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Mozilla Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, Windows Mail, Gmail and other POP3/IMAP mail clients ensures your email is free of viruses and other threats.

Removable media security â€“ Viruses can enter your computer from removable media such as USB sticks, MP3 players and CDs/DVDs. For self-running media, ESET Smart Security scans autorun.inf and associated files when inserted, in addition to scanning any file on any removable device when it is accessed or during a full-scan of the media. Advanced users can adjust ESET Smart Security to perform additional levels of scanning on removable media.

System tools â€“ For advanced users ESET SysInspector and ESET SysRescue simplify diagnosing and cleaning of infected systems by allowing deep scans of system processes to find hidden threats, and creating bootable rescue CD/DVD or USB drives to help you repair an infected computer.
