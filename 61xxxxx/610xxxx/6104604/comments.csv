The thing I have noticed the most is that very few who download stay around very long to seed. Whenever I begin seeding I always give that file 100% of my bandwidth, but begin sharing with my other torrents after there are enough seeders. A few of you do help seed and thanks to you guys. I have removed most of my own uploaded torrents because of ingratitude. You can be assured, however, that I will not remove one until there is no one currently downloading and I will personally seed as long as anyone wants it. If you can see this you will know that I am seeding."
,Saki33,2011-02-03T18:05Z,"I see that there are still a lot more people downloading the 6.56 GB file. That's fine if they have a lot of space ... and patience. That is the one I downloaded and resized to make this. It did not lose any quality at all when I resized it. I think it makes better sense to download this one, but if the large one makes you think you will get a better file then do it. It took me a very long time to seed back that one to 100%, which took up valuable space on my computer. This one won't take nearly as long to seed back your quota."
,extinctionspasm,2011-09-05T10:05Z,"Well im that case let me say thankyou. 

I am one of those people who doesn't comment often but should (after using this site for years I have only just joined so as to be able to comment here). 

I do however respect the old values of Torrent etiquette and always seed till a ratio of at least 1 ( at the private trackers I am a member of my ratio is always at least 1.75 and usually 2+).

But alas, this comment is not so much about tooting my own horn (although it is obviously a big part of it hahaha), but more importantly to let you know that there are people out there who do appreciate uploaders, and respect the traditional torrent etiquette which does seem to be lacking for some.

Thanks again and as soon as I have finished downloading I shall post another comment with a quality rating for you.

Cheers!!!"

I would have liked to have a comment on the quality as I thought it turned out well. As I said, the audio isn't great, but neither was it in the original. I think it is interesting to note that Tati added the audio after the fact. He liked to use audio for effect and to emphasize the humor. It is apparent with the tire blowout, and especially the ping pong ball during the card games in what I think is the one of the funniest scenes in the movie.

This one is being seeded about the average for this kind of thing. At least a few people have taken their obligation seriously. I have recently uploaded a tv series, and while after a couple of weeks it is reasonably seeded, it gets frustrating watching peer after peer drop off as soon as their download finishes. Of about 40 or so who have completed it there are still 7 seeders, and that's about average. The most surprising to me is the Larry Sanders Show series. After 9 months there are still many seeders, and those aren't small files. I think it depends on the loyalty of the downloaders. I think they are more likely to stick around and help out for a show they want others to enjoy as much as they do.

This one is one of my all time favorites and I would like for a lot of people to see it too. I was so glad they came out with this version. I have the US dvd, but it cut off  the train scene at the end, which made the ending seem a little flat to me.

I expect to continue seeding it for a long time, but of course no longer give it 100% of my bandwidth. I do have to seed some other stuff. So far I have a ratio of 51.8 on this one.
