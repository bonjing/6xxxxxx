I wanted to send this movie to a friend, but 6.56 GB was too large to send via Pando. I resized it with Any Video Converter and played it on my HDTV. I could not tell the difference from the large file. The sound is not great, but it wasn't very good on the original, and I could detect no difference there either. It's B&W and working from an old print it just didn't require a high resolution. You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear, as the saying goes.

This Blue Ray rip has some restored scenes not on the DVD rip and that is why I decided to share this. I felt that a more reasonable size would encourage those who are reluctant to download a very large file. This is a film worth seeing.
