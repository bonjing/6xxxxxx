Book Description
================
From Publishers Weekly
Brokaw's The Greatest Generation examined an era that brought America 
together, while Boom! considers some of the most divisive years in American 
history. Inviting listeners to a virtual reunion of characters from 
the 1960s (which he loosely defines as the years between 1963 and 1972), 
this compendium of interviews and anecdotes is loosely held together 
by Brokaw's own biographical time line and opinions. His warm, familiar 
voice is still filled with genuine curiosity, which listeners will find 
hard to resist. On audio, Brokaw's diction becomes a little rough around 
the edges, occasionally letting words run together. Brokaw, who has 
been a guest in our living rooms for as long as many people can remember, 
is still welcome to report on the world as he sees it.

Product Description
In Boom!, Tom Brokaw, one of Americaâ€™s premier journalists and the acclaimed 
author of The Greatest Generation, gives us an epic portrait of another 
defining era in America: the tumultuous Sixties. The voices and stories 
of both famous people and ordinary citizens come together in this â€œvirtual 
reunionâ€ as Brokaw takes us on a memorable journey through a remarkable 
time, exploring how individuals and the national mood were affected 
by a controversial era and showing how the aftershocks of the Sixties 
continue to resound in our lives today. In the reflections of a generation, 
Brokaw also discovers lessons that might guide us in the years ahead. 
Race, politics, war, feminism, popular culture, and music are all delved 
into here. Brokaw explores how members of this generation have gone 
on to bring activism and a Sixties mindset into individual entrepreneurship 
, as we hear stories of how this formative decade has shaped our perspectives 
on business, the environment, politics, family, and our national existence. 
Remarkable in its insights, wonderfully written and reported, this revealing 
book lets us join in these frank conversations about America then, now, 
and tomorrow.
