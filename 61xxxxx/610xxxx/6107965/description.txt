When Smithers offers to help transform Moe\'s dingy pub into a more refined and trendy lounge, the revamped \"Mo\'s\" quickly becomes Springfield\'s local gay hangout. With Smithers\' friends and colleagues infusing new life into \"Mo\'s,\" business starts to boom, but Moe inadvertently leads his new bar patrons to believe that he, too, is gay. Afraid that telling the truth would hurt his newly flourishing business, Moe\'s new friends teach him a lesson in acceptance. Meanwhile, Principal Skinner becomes smitten with the new free-spirited music teacher, Ms. Juniper, who inspires the by-the-book principal to take chances. When Skinner finds out that Ms. Juniper\'s daughter, Melody, has a crush on Bart, he uses Bart to get close to Ms. Juniper.
