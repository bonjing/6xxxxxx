,LokiXP,2011-01-15T09:30Z,"This is not BETA, it is OEM RTM!  Shush if you don't know!"
,dcohen6,2011-01-15T10:13Z,"Correct! This is not beta. I checked the hash sum against the actual RTM by Microsoft, perfect match."
,LokiXP,2011-01-15T10:32Z,"Dont forget afterwards to run the following command at an elevated command prompt:

dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded

This will remove old uninstaller information and cleanup your system, however BEWARE if you do this you can NEVER uninstall SP1.  It can save up to 1.5GB of space on certain systems however.  Your mileage may vary on space savings."

,kykyred,2011-04-30T07:34Z,"yup worked great i did a clean install and then did an install of my backed-up drivers and then installed this service pack and i noticed increased system start up time but hasnt frozen sense like the pre SP1 update did so overall i like it 

also i have a T1090 processor x 6 AMD and the overclcok software works with this SP! update but not with the pre update so im thinking a little bit of motherboard compatibility or something maybe software integration or something idk but i like it overall but it does make it into an evaluation copy but just run a trial reset-er and your in the clear , hopefully eventually there will be a permanent activator "
,jakelong,2011-05-23T16:21Z,will dis work on my non genuine windows 7 ultimate 64-bit??
