,BioAcid,2011-01-16T09:00Z,anyone got some A/V reviews please.
,amin12,2011-01-16T12:49Z,good copy for cam rate is A 7 V 8.5 for cam
,godsarmory,2011-01-16T16:41Z,a/v anyone ?
,NeutralGold,2011-01-17T05:33Z,"Audio and Video are pretty nice
I'd say a8/v5
Who ever recorded this left the auto focus turned on, on the camera. So it loses focus quite a bit. There are some parts of the movie that are very blurry. I would have given video a 9 had that not been the case.. 
It is perfectly watchable though. I liked the movie alot but do wish I had waited for a better copy :("
,pacerist,2011-01-17T23:26Z,"What's with the f*cking focus all the time ?
Constant in focus, out of focus, in out,..."

,mycurse92,2011-01-19T01:01Z,When is DVD release?
,jaeaxp,2011-01-19T05:42Z,"Like NeutralGold said and others after, yes the constant auto focus gets on your nerves BUT also the top of the movie is crop'd! most of the time you can't see the actors head, just their body... i would pass on this for now. Unless your that desperate to watch... "
,1and5hark,2011-01-19T11:31Z,"Not great quality but watchable.  Many thanks to the the UL.

Wow LoLong you tell the most fascinating stories.  I'm sure your 14 cats think you are really smart."
,cveba,2011-01-19T19:39Z,"A:8

losing lotsa focus but in any case tyvm for upload very much worth watching even at this stage;)"
,jcferns,2011-01-19T21:27Z,"Thanks Raymond, but in this movie heads are cut off..so most of the times you see faces without foreheads and sometimes without heads"
,roaddog7072,2011-01-20T00:23Z,"Can you get the movie  The Man Who Broke a 1000 Chains starring Val Kilmer. No one seems to have it, not even Netflix"
,oatgarum,2011-01-20T10:42Z,thanks raymondhome  :D
,chris2881,2011-01-21T00:47Z,"lol, who else thought of posing as raymondhome and sending your own address to ozzyfan for a donation!?"
,glowaglowa,2011-01-21T19:33Z,"Problems with focus are not the main drawback of this copy. What makes it almost unwatchable is the weird angle of filming. It causes that the upper part of the screen is cut off and in the majority of scenes you can barely see the faces of the actors. The movie is good so i won't bother myself with this one an wait for something better. 

A:9
V:2(If not this weird angle it would be 6)"
,Titanosaurus,2011-01-22T02:42Z,"@ MrMaxMMA
hi."
,Boostpimp,2011-01-23T03:07Z,"A8 V5
Good enough for me...going in and out of focus at times is annoying."
,BOTplug,2011-01-23T10:39Z,"Do not watch this version or you will ruin the experience of this movie.

The capture is missing the top part of the screen so most scenes will show people without heads.
