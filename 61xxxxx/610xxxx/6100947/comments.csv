,mlkjuggalo,2011-10-18T14:05Z,@dengelkes nope sorry this is only for hd2 you could brick your phone if you try to use this 
,cappii,2011-11-06T07:21Z,"@iartmawd the hd2 is a GSM phone, and does not have an ESN.  GSM phones have IMEIs.  Unlocking is done on a network level.  This ROM will not unlock it.  You will need to consult an unlocking site for this."
