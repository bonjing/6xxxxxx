Software You Will Need

Coreldraw x3 or X5 here\'s a good torrent

Microsoft Office (goes without saying)

CA recommend that you print your documents using
an Epson R800 printer or any printer with high resolution
which uses smudge/waterproof ink.

Use a standard 80gsm A4 paper or choose paper
according to look and feel.

Step 1

Install the CA font pack without it your documents will
look crap.

Step 2
Open the templates in Coreldraw X3 or X5, usually each file
will be shown as master and laser overlay.

Step 3
Edit the laser overlay to show what you want, for transactions
and calculations use MS excel (available in all office products).
copy the transactional data by selecting the spreadsheet tables
that are relevant and paste straight into the coreldraw overlay
file, not the colour master.

Step 4
Print out the colour master front and back using colour printer

Step 5 
Print the corel laser overlay onto the colour master, simply
re insert the colour master back into a laser printer or the
colour one (just use black or grayscale printing this time).

Step 6
Finish the document, hole punches, perforators can all be
purchased from good stationers.

Once you get the knack of it you\'ll be churning out documents
quicker than a print shop. Please seed and share your knowledge
so that everyone can benefit from confidentialaccess.
