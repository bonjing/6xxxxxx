Samuel Beam (born July 26, 1974), better known by his stage and recording name Iron & Wine, is an American singer-songwriter. He has released four studio albums, several EPs and singles, as well as a few download-only releases, which include a live album (a recording of his 2005 Bonnaroo performance). He occasionally tours with a full band.

Beam was raised in South Carolina before moving to Florida to attend school and now resides outside of Austin, Texas. The name Iron & Wine is taken from a dietary supplement named "Beef Iron & Wine" that he found in a general store while shooting a film.

Kiss Each Other Clean is the fourth studio album by Iron & Wine, due out January 25, 2011. It's his first album for the Warner Bros. label after leaving Sub Pop. The first track from the album, "Walking Far from Home," was released on November 26 in CD single and 12" vinyl versions as part of a special Record Store Day Black Friday event and a digital download version was released on November 30. The song "Tree by the River" has also been released, for free download, on Iron & Wine's website. On January 5th Iron and Wine performed all but one song from Kiss Each Other Clean live at the Greene Space in New York City for a live broadcast on NPR's website. The album marks a further change in style. In an interview with SPIN magazine, Beam said â€œItâ€™s more of a focused pop record. It sounds like the music people heard in their parentâ€™s car growing upâ€¦ that early-to-mid-â€™70s FM, radio-friendly music.
