On her way to work Rayveness stops to grab something from her garage, and finds Kris, her son's best friend, fast asleep. Taking a moment to admire how well he's grown up, she decides to call into work, and take the day off to spend some time with the young man. While she's calling in he wakes up, and startled to find her so close to him, starts babbling about being down on his luck, and just crashing there while he gets on his feet. Rayveness doesn't care about any of that. All she knows is that her son's friend looks tasty, that she hasn't had breakfast, she's taken the day off, and that she's going to fuck his brains out. And so she does.
