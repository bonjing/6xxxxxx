,tylr,2011-01-17T20:11Z,"its more of a doubt, than a request..

is it possible to make a additional language pack for the file.. similar to the subtitle pack?? ..actually i was speaking about the ""English Language Pack"" 

..is something like that possible? or the only other way is to make a re-encode of the file in English??"
,tylr,2011-01-18T08:13Z,"..i think it jus might be possible http://94.75.224.58/forums/index.php?showtopic=137321&st=0&gopid=1947470&#entry1947470
