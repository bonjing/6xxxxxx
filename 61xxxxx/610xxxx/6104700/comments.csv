Hats off to you man.. I know what a pain in the ass ripping and uploading is.. I have recommended you to a lot of people i know and they are very happy with it..I'm saying thank you on their behalf.

One of my friends was asking if you could do how i met your mother the previous seasons.. I wasn't astonished as they asked it from you, even if i was one of them i would have done the same. 

Anyway take care, I hope your mom and your dog is doing good. :)"

,Xtraterrestrial,2011-01-15T20:14Z,"Hey. Just registered on the site to forward my appreciation for your torrents. Downloaded quite a lot of your stuff and it's just amazing. Great quality.

I don't really have any requests- you already upload most of the TV shows and films I want to watch. I've been wanting to see 127 Hours for a while though. Gonna keep checking to see if you upload that one. :)

Thanks for your great work."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-15T20:16Z,"@houruoha: ONLY two BluRays were released.

@dark_defender: OK, but later - as I announced, I have some personal picks to encode. Hope you don't mind."
,DSIN,2011-01-15T20:20Z,thanx man...4 all ur hardwork :)
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-15T20:23Z,"@Xtraterrestrial: Thanks, should I qualify our encounters as 3rd or 4th kind then? Kidding.

Regarding 127 - I haven't done it, I would wait for BluRay."
,cindal,2011-01-15T20:44Z,Thank you so much for Shag!Love that movie! It's a tough one to find!!!

@Xtraterrestrial: If you can you should wait for blu-ray, its worth it. But I have already seen it."

,sanyam123,2011-01-16T09:08Z,thanks 2040 :-)
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-16T09:20Z,"@khaada123:

There was Provocateur.1998.DvDRip.XviD-FiCO on alt.binaries, but now is not present.

Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-16T10:16Z,"@dark_defender: Sunday morning gave me opportunity to check for your both requests... and glass is half full... not half empty.

So, Sophie's choice never was released on BluRay disk nor aired in HDTV (both preferred). For worse, out there there is no DVD too, just 2CD rip, small frame (592x320) but fairly big (1.37 GB) due to the duration of the movie.

My encode is 624x352 - smaller than you asked for - but 700 MB. I cannot do a new encode (re-rip) 'cause, as I said, DVD cannot be found.
I would put this encode in one future movie.pack anyway, and you could download it - or not. It's up to you.

A Perfect World cause no problems at all."
,roOgue,2011-01-16T13:19Z,"hey buddy can you rip one movie for me

,dark_defender,2011-01-16T18:04Z,"@twentyforty: Thanks for taking my requests. Sure i will download both the movies in formats you will encode and upload because i know you will encode them in best possible formats(considering size).

Thanks in Advance !!!"
