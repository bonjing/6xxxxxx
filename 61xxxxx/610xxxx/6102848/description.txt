Doro Pesch has always been a natural fighter. One who stays true to herself with heart and soul. She is an icon and a decisive power in the Heavy Metal scene. One who doesn?ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½â€žï¿½t give up when life becomes hard and who doesn?ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½â€žï¿½t shy away from long and difficult paths. She formed Warlock, and Warlock has turned into a legend and a true cult band. Due to songs as "FÃ¼r Immer", "True as Steel", All We Are" or "I Rule The Ruins" their name has become immortal and is still alive. As well ?ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½â‚¬Å“ or maybe especially ?ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½â‚¬Å“ the new Doro album "Warrior Soul" carries on the spirit of the old Warlock times and adapts it to the current times. 

Limited Edition comes packaged in a Digi-book. The new Doro album Warrior Soul carries on the spirit of the old Warlock times and adapts in to the current times. Doro would not be Doro is she did not put all of her heart and energy into Warrior Soul. Once again she had to go a long way. It has leaded her from the already familiar Yellohouse Studio in Wupppertal (Germany), the Atom-H-Studios and the cooperation with Chris Lietz and Torsten Sickert to Switzerland where she worked together with Deezl Imhof (Foolpark Studios) and film director Luke Gasser. A great number of future hits have been developed on her journey for example 'Stranger's Yesterday', 'Above The Ashes' or 'You're My Family' which is dedicated to the many true Doro fans. Mixed by Deezl and the New Yorker Metal Mike Goldberg who have put the finishing touches on it, Warrior Soul is not only the name of the album but it was also done with all soul of a true warrior.
