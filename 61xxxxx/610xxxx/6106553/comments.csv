,TorrentMonster,2011-01-17T20:32Z,"This movie SUCK!

This is like a non action version of Cloverfield, seriously i was hoping for a Survivor movie, cuz thats what it looks like on the cover.
all they are doing is trying to get from mexico to america, it actuely doesnt have ANY action with any monsters (without from the beginning and the end, but thats the same fucking place, monster and time), but the monster you see is a fucking squid, they seriously couldnt be more creative, atleest movies like Cloverfield and Skyline has some original monster/aliens.

I do NOT recommend this moive!

,murrambingi,2011-01-19T01:09Z,"thx for the upload extremezone,

Good quality, but this movie is absolute crap, i think it is cheaply made like a $2 home made porno, and the alien part is just so fucking stupid, a octopus comon seriously, the maker/ writer of this film is a stupid fucking retard who would make such a shit movie and think it would be successful.

Disappointing :( "
,tyrael,2011-01-19T16:08Z,"what is the point in 720p is using XviD instead of h.264?
if someone downloads XviD encode it means he has an old/crappy pc so he might have problems with 720p even if XviD.
so this encode is neither for old pc users nor for quality...
i suggest this, even tho i see this is total crappy movie in terms of plot: Monsters.2010.720p.HDTV.x264.RoSubbed-HDGiRL"
,Frenetz,2011-01-19T22:00Z,"Perfect quality, and a great movie... Thanks!"

,AnonymousBasterd,2011-01-22T04:00Z,"if this movie is freaking crap and ugly and low budget, why the hell is this getting 6+ rating in imdb with so many leechers seeders! the hell. . ."
,yuioooot,2011-01-22T16:43Z,"I see people complaining about this movie and how it stinks and sucks blah blah. Dont listen to them :) 
It's not a sci fi flick. It's more a drama.
If you expect this to be an action packed sci fi monster movie, then dont bother grabbing it. Because it's not.
So grow up, and stop whining like little girls because this film wasnt what you expected it to be.

It's a ultra low budget film, shot with a two man crew. And yet it doesnt come off lit a low budget production.
I liked it a lot, and I'm sure most you will too :)"
,Powerslave,2011-01-23T03:56Z,NO audio on PS3 with HDMI
,Powerslave,2011-01-23T03:58Z,"No audio on PS3 with HDMI, using PS3 media server. My amp shows no audio input, but plays with WMP."
,MrMemphis,2011-01-27T12:19Z,@TorrentMaster: LOL. Skyline was original monsters? Have you seen War of The Worlds? Or Transformers?
,sukdink9999,2011-01-30T10:12Z,"Who ever said it was an action movie?
If you teenage boys can't check IMDB before downloading then you really should hold back your whiney comments.

Thanks for the upload, great film."

Well-said, TorrentMonster. Within just a split-second, you've successfully and efficiently given everyone extreme insight as to the limits of your intelligence and taste/sophistication. If you are the kind of person who loved Transformers, you wont like this. Dont expect a big FX movie made for the mindless masses.

And arent the comments here supposed to reflect the quality, and not the opinions of incredibly stupid lemmings commenting on the storyline?

If you are incredibly stupid, just limit your opinions to the quality of the rip. Cmon, you know who you are. Less is more, you happy buffoons. Just say something like:

V:10
A:9
M:6

or whatever you thought.

Also, if you are as dumb as TorrentMonster, please kill yourself immediately. No really, just do it. It will save a lot of resources that should be spent on productive individuals who have a purpose. If you look online, you can find many effective and painless ways to achieve it. And also, please record it too, so we can at least have benefited from your departure in terms of having amusing video to watch for many years to come. THAT, would be perhaps the only way you could make yourselves useful.

Make sure the images are in focus too. 

Thanks!"

Yes I agree, this is by no means a monster flick.
Although there should have beeen more on the love story. I thought the best qualities of the film were the camera visuals, somewhat artistic.
You should check out: The Road (I thought it had a very deep love story.) and ""Into the Wild""
Not really a love story, but filled with emotion."

,awwgoddammit,2011-03-17T23:01Z,"it actually IS a very good movie. no, it's not a monster movie. get over it, cry babies. not every movie is going please 13 year olds......."
,awwgoddammit,2011-03-17T23:04Z,audio was fine for me. i watched it with VLC if it makes any difference.
,boffy30,2011-04-01T16:51Z,Thanks gr8 upload :)
,f.kruger,2011-04-12T14:11Z,"To all the 13 yr olds who download everything on here. This cost $500k [they spend more on tv adds] to make and it's a romance and has a 'plot' [look the word up]
Thanks for the up ex."
,dlarrym1111,2011-04-29T09:26Z,"It now has a 7.3 out of 10 (bigger number is better plot and story, smaller numbers mean it sucks or has a good chance of sucking."
,darklight1138,2011-08-05T21:07Z,"flatusgass:

And you've just communicated your sickening and shameful level of self-.superiority.

Your attempt at putting someone in their place failed miserably. You think you're smarter than the person you berate but you're not -- not even close. 

And urging someone to kill themselves -- wow, you are one piece of work. You really need counseling and/or medication because for someone to say something like that to a total stranger, it really just yells that you have serious mental and emotional issues. "
,Kooblukhan,2011-09-02T22:45Z,"I think they made a mistake naming this movie.  Every asshole with 2 eyes assumes its the next GI Joe or something.  This is an indie movie.  If you do not like indie movies, you will not like this.  So please go away and stop flaming the comment section.

Now.  Great cinematography, soundtrack, character development, pacing.  Seriously loved the ending once i connected it to the intro of the film.  THE sleeper hit of 2010 if you ask me.  Not to be missed.  A/V based on sample.

A 10
V 10
M 3 1/2 stars

excellent, like a scenic, atmospheric companion to District 9"
,shinobiung,2011-11-12T20:00Z,"oh I have seen this movie a year ago, was wondering what the fuss was about. basically if your a loner with 2 hrs spare to watch a quite movie, then you may enjoy this, if you want a fast life, then dont watch this. Not much SFX, not much budget, lots of travelling though, if they used 2 better actors this would have really been good."
