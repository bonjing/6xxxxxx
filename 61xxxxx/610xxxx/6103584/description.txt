Movie based upon a British TV comedy series starring Leonard Rossiter, Richard Beckinsale, Frances De La Tour and Don Warrington.

Overview: Leonard Rossiter reprises his role as delightfully detestable boardinghouse proprietor Rupert Rigsby in this big-screen adaptation of Eric Chappell's brilliant 1970s sitcom, regarded as one of the funniest British series of all time. Little has changed for Miss Jones (Frances de la Tour), Philip (Don Warrington) and the rest of the colorful tenants of Rigsby's house who constantly find themselves in the crosshairs of their landlord's rancor.

Plot: Stingy English landlord Rigsby manages to scam his lodgers Cooper, an arts student, and Philip, an African jock, making both pay for a room they must share. However Rigsby's favorite lodger, Miss Jones, now flirts with both boys rather then the old goat, despite his pitiful attempts to be generous. Crossed by her still overprotective dad, she actually prefers an affair with slick veteran Seymour, who is really only interested in her money.
