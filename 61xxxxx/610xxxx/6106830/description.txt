Yuri Ilyenko - Lebedyne ozero-zona AKA Swan Lake â€“ The Zone - 1990
Russian - English subs.

    Yuri Illyenko, the master Ukrainian cinematographer who shot Sergei Paradjanov's Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors (1965) and directed the long-banned A Spring for the Thirsty (1965) and The Eve of Ivan Kupalo (1968), based this striking 1990 allegorical film on stories by Paradjanov that were inspired by his long sojourns in prison. The film was shot at the prison where Paradjanov was confined, using contemporary prisoners as extras, and it might be said that the documentary and poetic-symbolic aspects of this movie are equally germane to its overall impact. Three days before his sentence is to end, a prisoner (Victor Solovyov) escapes and hides out inside a giant hammer and sickle that borders the prison grounds, where he is discovered and nursed back to health by a beautiful woman (Liudmyla Yefymenko, Illyenko's wife) who becomes his lover. One of the first independent Soviet productions, partially financed in Sweden and Canada, the film tells its story with a minimum of dialogue and very striking imagery. â€“ Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader

    From Yuri Ilyenko's letter to a friend, Marko Stech:
    "As you undoubtedly know, the art of cinema has no appropriate rendering in the verbal realm of expression. Such in the case with any form of visual art. Hence, my subjugated mind seeks remedy in an image. An image is wiser than a word because it always represents a prophecy that has not as yet bound itself with words. I made this film because it was impossible for me not to have made it. it is about escape - about a prisoner. I myself have always felt a prisoner in a vast zone, together with my entire nation. Escape is the last, desperate hope. Such is also an escape into art."
