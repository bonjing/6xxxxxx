After his wife testifying on his behalf at his murder trial doesn't go as planned Frank McCormick finds himself in a prisoner transport van with a fellow prisoner who has an escape planned. Team One initially focuses on the prosecuting attorney as Frank's likely target for revenge. In a desperate attempt to restore his wife's trust in him, Frank uses his escape to try and prove the evidence presented at his trial is faulty. After capturing the other prisoner and his accomplice Team One change their focus to Frank's wife as the most likely target which in turn leads them to Frank having taken hostage the coroner who performed the autopsy on his daughter. As the standoff ends Ed gets word that his wife is on the way to the hospital due to complications from her pregnancy.
