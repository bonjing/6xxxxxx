,Ign0tus,2011-12-16T00:26Z,"OK, what I did to satisfy it was I mounted the ISO on another box. Then browsed the ISO and saw a file named BOOTDISK.KEY. I copied this file to another USB stick and put that into a 2nd USB slot on the machine I'm working on. On the registration screen, there is a browse button. I hit that button, browsed to the BOOTDISK.KEY file on the 2nd USB stick and selected it and it accepted it and it seems to be working fine. I'm surprised, but glad it worked. Thanks for the utilities."
