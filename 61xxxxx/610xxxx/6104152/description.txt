Kelby Training - Photographing Adventure Sports Tutorial

Join Tom Bol as he teaches this outdoor photography course from the famous mountain-biking Mecca of Moab, Utah. Tom is passionate about adventure sports and Moab is a terrific location to shoot. Follow Tom as he progresses from a simple setup using available lighting and moves on to more complex single-light setups and then on to more advanced lighting. During the course, Tom will be showing viewers how to achieve a decent shot in midday sun, how to freeze and blur the action, how to capture a sun star in the photograph, and much, much more. If you are shooting action outdoors, you won't want to miss this course.
