,billyboyd,2011-01-18T13:08Z,"Ladies man if you've an old dvd player that doesn't play divx format these avi files won't play on your player, but if you're dvd player plays divx just burn the files to disc and enjoy, you can get up to six movies on one disc depending on the file sizes, (6, 700mb files).
If you haven't got a player that plays divx I suggest you buy one, you can pick them up for little or nothing these days."

,drfresh,2011-01-19T21:45Z,"...If you are geek'y enough to mess around here, you should have VLC player installed a long time ago, a 5$ cable between your tv and pc solvs that issue. If you must have a dvd, why not dl a full dvd with menus and subs.

Or: copy your media on to a memo-stick and play via ps3. my 8 year old daughter knows how to do this for crist sake.."
,TheLizardKing1977,2011-01-19T23:42Z,"I have to admit the quality of this movie was outstanding, but the movie was probably the worst I have seen in 10 years. I started ok but just went downhill from there. I'm surprised I managed to sit through the whole thing.

Audio:10/10

Movie:1/10 (Being Generous)"

Good call ... It's all I use and burn dozens of flicks each week  ... I never make coasters with it ... My favorite version is older .... but I have the best results with it ... Vers 2.2 with XP ... it's still out there. Any of them are fine I'm sure ...just my personal favorite ... I run some of the newer versions (3 and 4) on my Vista and Win 7 boxes

A: 9/10
Movie: ℏ/ℏ  ;)

Fucking great film but only if you ""get"" the physics/QM references. I mean, c'mon, a strip club called ""Minkowski's""? … Fucking brilliant.

It's almost like The Usual Suspects meets… I dunno… maybe a Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez remake/rescript of a Brian Greene NOVA episode?"

,Frice,2011-02-09T16:20Z,"New trolling procedure:

Acting like bad movies are somehow to complex to understand."
,triflemenot,2011-02-12T14:45Z,"It's not a matter of complexity. This film is a satire on man's feeble efforts to discover the God particle and unlock the secrets of existence and reality in the four dimensional spacetime observable to humans.

Kestral said ""I knew why we're here the first time I dropped acid."" Later he said ""The reason why we're here, is to learn why we're here.""

Typical acid head hallucinogen logic. Classic.

Perhaps not many people can grasp the full extent of this film. For those under 50, it will be difficult.

,daleel,2011-02-28T19:10Z,"thank you very much for sharing this. hey guys thanks for all ur judgemental, critical cooments!"
,jesse74,2011-03-01T00:28Z,"Funny as hell!
@Frice - even without all of the QM innuendos scattered throughout the movie the basic storyline is still fairly decent with a couple of twists here and there.  If you really, really, really find it that hard to follow I'm sure we can find something more suitable for you.
Like maybe Pixar's ""Cars"" with Lightning McQueen...or better yet - Keanu Reeve's ""Speed"" :-)"
,kokak2010,2011-03-14T03:14Z,Outstanding Audio and Video 10 out of 10 but the movie its bad 3/10
,triflemenot,2011-03-14T17:57Z,"No, the movie is not bad.  But there are bad people, watching a movie they don't understand."
,fourlions,2011-03-18T13:43Z,thanks good one
,InstantStarFan7,2011-04-10T01:57Z,Thank you for sharing extremezone! I appreciate all your hard work and you always have great releases! Much thanks!
,Johnneeeh,2011-05-24T20:09Z,"A: 10 V: 10 M:9

No movie is ever perfect but this deserves a 9.
I don't get the fact that people say it's hard to understand or the ""THIS MOVIE SUCKS TROLLOLOLOL FLAME FLAME"" comments . I think it's a brilliant movie and extremezone did (another) great job.

Thanks"
