,traxstar7,2011-01-15T19:43Z,"So this is just the SP1, not the whole OS, am I right ??

This is used after formating a new Win7 and then installing this SP1, instead of using the windows-update function ???

Thanks "
,misterlim,2011-01-16T17:07Z,"installed it and working fine, thanks 

@traxstar7 yes this is just the service pack
"
,msmmpts,2011-01-17T03:53Z,it is the original one..
,Yubaba,2011-01-18T15:56Z,I've installed it and it certainly looks like the real deal.
,Talon_257,2011-02-23T21:23Z,"So this is the final SP1 release, right?

Can somebody confirm if this works on pirated versions of W7 x64? I assume it does but would like a confirmation before I take an unneccessary risk... Thanks!"

,Godzuky,2011-04-03T06:46Z,"I dont understand.. what is the point of sharing this, if this can not be used on a pirated Win 7.. I mean if you own an original copy of 7 why would you need to do this.."
