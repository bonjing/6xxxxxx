.: Synopsis :.

The movie opens with Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) tending to his Missouri farm with his son, Josey Jr (Clint's real-life son, Kyle Eastwood). Josey's wife (Cissy Wellman) calls to the boy to return to the house. Josey hears the tramping of horses and sees smoke coming from his homestead. Running there, he witnesses marauding cavalry from the Union Army, known as "red legs", killing his wife and son and burning down his house. Josey is struck with a sword by Captain Terrill (Bill McKinney) across the face and is wounded and left for dead. Still alive, Josey surveys the wreckage, buries his kin, and finds his gun in the smouldering ash. He spends some time practicing his aim in preparation for taking his revenge. Confederate officer Fletcher (John Vernon) and a haphazard band of Rebel soldiers, happen upon Josey's burned down farm and Josey joins them, since they are bent on the destruction of as many "red legs" as possible.
