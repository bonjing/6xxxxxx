,P_o_n_y_o,2011-12-04T22:28Z,In order to make the English subtitles work you will have to rename the file with the .ass extension to exactly match the title of the movie (the .mkv file). Just leave the .ass extension unchanged. When both the .ass file and the .mkv file have the same name you will have a wonderful Japanese movie with English subtitles. It will work with VLC but also with other viewing programs. Audio and video quality is superb.
