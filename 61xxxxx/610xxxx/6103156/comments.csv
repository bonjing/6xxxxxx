,teloycho,2011-01-24T12:03Z,what size usb do we need to install this??? 
,some0neX,2011-01-24T17:41Z,"@teloycho How about reading the torrent description before asking?!

@avatar_24
It's a keygen and those are usually falsely recognized as viruses. You don't have to use it for anything since Everest is already registered so you can simply delete it... 

The release is 100% clean, I've tested it. You don't have to believe me, ask the people who use it at ub3r.1337.cx and see for yourself =)"

,Gator420,2011-05-15T19:20Z,@bl3203 I'm in the same boat. I don't have a DVD drive on my net book and I made the mistake of erasing my windows 7 partition when I installed Ubuntu. Does anyone out there know if this can be used a permanent install? 
,pcgamer1993,2011-05-18T18:36Z,"It is not working at me. 
i downloaded it, extracted to my desktop.

i right click installer, than run as administrator.
i select the usb letter by 1,2,or 3.
than it formating my usb. and than i get the message in command translated from dutch to english:

diskpart closing.....
copying windows 7 USB Stick Edetion system files, please wait( takes long time).
The drive with your installation has the drive letter E:
file not found - *
/ file(s) copied
Making your drive bootable...
bootsect is not noticed as intern or extern command, program or batchfile.
The installation is complete, enjoy having a full copy of windows 7 ultimate in your pocket - everywhere!

Now insert the usb drive into any computer and reboot it=>
_
Would you like to burn the universal bootloader to a cd in order to be able to boot your new windows on ANY computer?
type y for yes or n for no and hit enter (Y/N)?


thats the message.
so the problem is, it says it is installing, but copies nothing. and my usb opens, with nothing in it, just empty.
also when i boot, i get nothing.

please help me, iĂÂ´m a kind of noob.

thanks"
,some0neX,2011-05-18T19:34Z,"AN UPDATE HAS BEEN RELEASED (v2.9) -> http://7usb.tk/update

It makes the installation process much easier and fixes all issues, YOU OUGHT TO DOWNLOAD IT!"
,pcgamer1993,2011-05-18T21:52Z,"no, this is not working for me.

i cant open INSTALL Windows 7 USB Drive Edition, becease i get the message:
INSTALL Windows 7 USB Drive Edition is not working anymore. the will be searched for a solution.

there is a problem so the prgram doesnt work godd anymore. the program will be closed and you get a message if a solution is availlable.
(translated from dutch).
so i tried to do the installer again, right click etc.
now it comes so far, that it has to open 7USBEditionByiMortaluz. then i get the message cant read file: ""C:\Users\my username\desktop\7 Ultimate USB Edition x86 v2.0 by iMortaluz\install\7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd"".

so it is still not working. i tried to redownload the torrent and the update, did the same again as in the readme, still the same problem. 
so i hope you have a solution, otherwise i quite with this.

thanks"

I want to use it to install a fresh copy of iTunes to Jailbreak my iPhone.

So my question is how do i modify this Win7 USB version so that it starts unmodified on every boot??? 

-like for example VM Ware / Virtual PC has Snapshots
