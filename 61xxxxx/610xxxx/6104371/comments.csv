,Deadaus,2012-03-24T20:32Z,"Hate to bust everyoneâs bubble but TurboTax is checking the serial you use to see if it is valid or not this year. Meaning if you use the keygen, you will be able to use the software and complete your taxes but you will NOT be able to print in PDF and you will NOT be able to Netfile or Telefile. Which most people need to file their taxes.

At least they give you the option to save you return for all the hard effort you put in. Just have to go and buy a valid copy"
