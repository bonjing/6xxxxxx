No one should seed this because the guy who made it is stupid

Downloading is fine though I've got nothing against Wikileaks"

If you don't seed you don't support WikiLeaks enough to let other people have the files."
,Ingsoc,2011-01-17T23:45Z,"Also, please seed. We only have one seeder and it's very hard to download this. I will seed, please do the same."
,Ingsoc,2011-01-18T00:14Z,"There were some seeding troubles, but I'm back. Don't loose faith!"
,senitary,2011-01-18T00:50Z,"Dude as much as I support the wikileaks shenanigans, the guy who put this up is a total douche.

Download it and repost it and I'd be glad to seed it or whatever taro  keeps bugging everyone to do"
