Encoders Notes:
Ok so i ripped the vobs with DGIndex.
Then i made a small avs script to re-size & sharpen.
I dropped that into vdubmod.
There i changed the colours with a rgb eq.
After that i increased the contrast, gamma & saturation.
I then lowered the brightness.
Finaly i muxed it to the audio.
Its a prety good DVDSCR.
It isnt my type of film, but someone may like it.
I went through the other copys of this film while i was encoding.
At the time RX's was the best copy.
Here is a screenshot comparison beetween my & rx's copy.
