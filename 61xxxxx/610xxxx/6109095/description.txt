Looking for a fast, portable and affordable operating system?
You may have found the solution in Porteus. Porteus is a member of the Linux flavour of operating systems which means it is stable and free. The creators name is Tomas M and he developed a set of scripts that turns your favourite distro into a portable OS that can be loaded onto a portable USB Flash Key, MP3 Player, Camera or even from a hard drive and run directly from it. Tomas M created Porteus from another Linux derivative called Slackware and the result is a lightning fast system that boots from portable media.
Slackware is one of the original Linux flavours and while it is probably not for the linux beginner, it is one of the most stable and customizable types of linux around. The birth of Porteus means that you can now carry your OS in your wallet/bag and use it on any computer by plugging the flash drive in and booting.
