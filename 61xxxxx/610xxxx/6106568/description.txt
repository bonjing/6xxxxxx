Guster

Daryl Hall revisits his 1980, Robert Fripp-produced solo debut, Sacred Songs, for a rare performance of â€œBabs and Babs,â€ with Gusterâ€™s Ryan Miller, Luke Reynolds and Brian Rosenworcel, for the first new Live from Darylâ€™s House web show of the year. The 38th and newest installment of the Webby award-winning Internet series, which recently made its broadcast debut with a 2 hour New Years Eve Special on WGN America to impressive ratings, will debut at www.lfdh.com on Jan. 15.

Guster was formed by Ryan Miller, Brian Rosenworcel and Adam Gardner in 1991 while attending Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Theyâ€™ve gone on to record six studio albums, their latest, Easy Wonderful, came out last year on Aware/Universal Republic and garnered the group some of its best reviews to date. The Wall Street Journalâ€™s John Jurgensen praised the album's "jangly, ebullient rock with lots of bright open spaces [but] in the midst of all that sunny pop, there are shadows lurking." Magnet magazine called the release â€œthe best thing the bandâ€™s ever doneâ€¦ We canâ€™ t tell you how much we love the new Guster album.â€ A renowned touring attraction, Guster performs more than 250 shows a year with the likes of John Mayer, Ben Folds, Nickel Creek, Pete Yorn and Rufus Wainwright. The Oakland Press raved that the groupâ€™s local concert â€œleft the crowd screaming for more,â€ while the Philadelphia Weekly was equally enthused: â€œEntertaining and humorousâ€¦ Whatâ€™s not to love?â€

â€œIt's an awesome concept for a show,â€ said Brian Rosenworcel about his experience on Live from Darylâ€™s House. â€œArtists who mutually respect each other learn to play each other's music and expose it to their fans, followed by a gourmet meal.â€

â€œThis was, for sure, one of the Top Seven Things I Have Done With My Band,â€ added Ryan Miller. â€œJust donâ€™t ask me about the other six.â€

Daryl and Guster joined on a six-song set that included â€œDo You Love Meâ€ and â€œBad Bad World,â€ a pair of tracks from the bandâ€™s latest album,Easy Wonderful, as well as â€œSatellite and â€œHang Onâ€ from their previous release, â€˜06â€™s Ganging up on the Sun, on Reprise Records. The set was topped off with versions of Daryl Hall and John Oatesâ€™ â€œRich Girlâ€ and a rare version of â€œBabs and Babsâ€ from Darylâ€™s Sacred Songs.

â€œThe guys have a great sense of humorâ€ said Daryl. â€œI didnâ€™t even mind that they practically cleaned out my wine cellar.â€
