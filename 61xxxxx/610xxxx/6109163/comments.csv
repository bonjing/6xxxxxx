I suggest anybody thinking about using the above checks out ""http://fileforum.betanews.com/review/1125962534/1/view"" first

[T],kriss_kringle,2011-01-18T15:20Z,Dude what's your point?I can find 10 sites that say it's the best player and it really is because I've been using it for more than a year and I had no problems.If it wasn't any good I wouldn't have recommended it so your comment is pointless and almost like trolling!
,roofspace,2011-01-18T22:47Z,"Is english your second language?
It was an innocuous comment.
That is why it was posted in a section called ""Comments"""
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-01-19T18:31Z,"It might have been ""innocuous"" but do you think I would recommend a player that has playback issues or other problems?"
,Manxome,2011-03-13T14:57Z,"Come on guys I'm sure roofspace didn't mean any offense, just giving more information on aplayer is surely helpful.

I've had no problems with KMPlayer myself but its helpful to know of its issues.

Film is great though, quality is good and at the sweet spot for file size, thanks. "
,vevdare,2011-04-28T10:25Z,Thanks.But no 1 here commented on quality..huh
