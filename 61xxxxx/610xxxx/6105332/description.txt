The made-for-TV Behind the Mask is the true story of Dr. Bob Shushan, a workaholic who disdains any sort of private life--and neglects his family in the process--the better to help his patients at the British Columbian Centre for the Mentally and Physically Disabled. When Shushan suffers a heart attack, his life is saved by the Centre's mentally handicapped janitor, James Jones (Matthew Fox)--and in the ensuing weeks, doctor and patient become closer than any father and son could ever be. Partly out of gratitude, Shushan makes it his mission to locate James' long-estranged biological father. And as a result of his relationship with James Jones, Shushan finally realizes how he has long short-changed his own family, especially his son Brian (Bradley Whitford), whom Shushan has unfairly written off as a failure. The real James Jones makes an appearance at the end of Behind the Mask, which first aired February 28, 1999 on CBS.
