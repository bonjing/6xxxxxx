Please stop slandering torrents you obviously haven't checked out, ""Conan_Fan"". 
Here's a snapshot of this file to prove it IS real:

Thanx to sHoTV (whoever they are) for the rip :-)"

Example fake sHoTV file:

,Conan_Fan,2011-01-15T07:11Z,"You're right. This is definitely not a fake. Just downloaded it, and it works great.

It's just really odd that all the sHoTV releases I've downloaded before were fakes...

I admit when I'm wrong. :/"
