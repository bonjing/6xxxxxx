Lotsa new features. This is probably gonna be my last minecraft upload because enough people have found out about anjocaido's updater.

And for the people who don't know how to make a server, I have also included the minecraft server jar and the properties file that makes it "cracked". It lets you play with friends even if they (or you) haven't bought the game.

The easiest way to set it up is to install logmein's hamachi on your computer and all your friend's computers, create a network, have your friends join the network,
and type in the sequence of four numbers of the computer that is hosting the game (5."number"."number"."number") into the multiplayer screen.
