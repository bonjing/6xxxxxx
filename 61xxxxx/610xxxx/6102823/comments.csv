,kimba007,2011-01-28T01:42Z,I just looked for this and all that showed up was the free version. So I dl it from it's own site [the free version]. Finished installing and it told me the trial had expired!?!?. Looked for it again and I found your torrent. Thank you!
,kimba007,2011-01-28T01:47Z,Can you or anyone out there recommend a good  anti adware program. I'm leery of using Ad-Aware and having all my keygens and cracks deleted! I got  something the other day when I dl Chris TV and I thought I was toast. But I got it going better than before [I was lucky]. Thanks.
