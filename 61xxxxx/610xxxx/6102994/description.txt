           Director Johan Grimonprez casts Alfred Hitchcock as a          
           paranoid history professor, unwittingly caught up in a         
           double take on the cold war period. Subverting a               
           meticulous array of TV footage and using 'The Birds' as        
           an essential metaphor, DOUBLE TAKE traces catastrophe          
           culture's relentless assault on the home, from moving          
           images' inception to the present day.
