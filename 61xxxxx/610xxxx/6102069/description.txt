Television's naughtiest sex addict just got a little sexier. Hank Moody can't keep his pants on Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ literally Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ through most of this hilariously wicked send-up of the hit show about a washed up writer whose libido gets in the way of his career. As if dealing with his teenage daughter and her friend blowing some guy in the next room weren't enough, Hank also has to put up with his ex-wife and her new boyfriend, not to mention his horny book agent who wants him to ghostwrite the memoir of a 25 year old porn star. But when Hank goes to the porn star's party, the Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£meet and greet' takes on a whole new meaning, and Hank finds himself taking the job along with the perks.
