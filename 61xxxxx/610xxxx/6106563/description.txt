Windows 2000 Professional running as a server.

This is a very nice VMWare image for those interested in running a Web Server, Mail Server, File Server, Music Streaming Server and more.

It is completely configured and ready to go. There is no TCP/IP concurrent connections limitation. Anyone with basic computer knowledge can have this up and running simply by booting up this image in a virtual machine (VMware)

-------------------------------
What's included?

-Windows 2000 Professional (NTSwitch'd) (Runs as NT Server)

-Abyss Web Server X2 (Already configured and secured)

-hMailServer 5.3.3 - Build 1879

-HFS File Server v2.7.2

-Subsonic Media Streamer 4.3

-PHP5 packaged for Abyss Web Server (latest version) - ready

-MySQL 5.1

-MySQL Admin Tools


Please note, there is a securitycheck.php file running in the webserver. It can be found in the wwwroot folder. This is a file used to check and test the webserver security. You may want to move this file off of your webserver when you are not performing any test.


Additionally, there is also a phpaccountinfo.php file in the webserver as well. It is used to identify under which credentials is your webserver/php running. As a security measure your server will run under a limited account automatically. You can find details in the Admin Documentation file.


Things to look for when running for the first time:


-Change the IP address/Gateway/DNS server info under network properties. or simply set it to Automatic (not recommended)

-If you change the Administrator account password, please make sure to change the password for HFS File Server service. It can be found by running Firedaemon >> edit service...


Enjoy and please, seed :)
