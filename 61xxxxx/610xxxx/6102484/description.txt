  Born in a prominent Bengali family, Subhas had   
  dedicated much of his younger years by being     
  actively involved in ridding the British from   
  India.For this purpose he joined hands with     
  stalwarts such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas 
  Gandhi, but expressed his frustration,especially
  with Gandhi's slow and painstaking way of trying
  to win over the enemy with love.
