The series follows the story of two alchemist brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who want to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy.

The original FMA started following the Manga but quickly overtook the story of it due to release dates. Therefore the anime creators based the rest of the series on rumours and ideas that Arakawa were thinking of adding. Brotherhood is the Manga story completely followed making fans of the comic much happier.
