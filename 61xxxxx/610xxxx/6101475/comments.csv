,ChefEm,2011-01-14T07:34Z,There is always rom on my hard drive for femdom. Thanks as always Merzedes!
,huvudverk,2011-01-14T18:58Z,"Thanks! Its interesting that Maitresse Madeleine actually realized that Divine Bitches is not as good as Men In Pain...we dont need a story or a theme when it comes to good femdom! All we need is a hot dominatrix, a submissive dude and an empty room with some toys! ;)

I love Isis Love's new boobs! But as Zakimar puts it...maybe she's tired of this business...shes been around for a while."

,h22a1997,2011-01-22T21:19Z,"Thats a good shoot but and you said divinebitches is not as good as men in pain it's not the same level as well. We miss some dom like harmony, and what about Mz Berlin from the old Captivemale site that have made some good shoot to. "
