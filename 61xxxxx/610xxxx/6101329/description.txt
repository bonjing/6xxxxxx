Still relatively unknown within the mainstream circuit, itâ€™s easy to see how Danger is considered one of the most underrated DJs when you take into account the league that he is playing amongst which include such legends as Kavinsky, Sebastien, Justice, and even Daft Punk.

Nonetheless, his vast array of talents and videogames-from-the-80s-influenced beats should not be trivialized as Danger is set to take the world by storm in the near future. Along with an incredible 2009 world tour spanning a legion of cities across North America, Australia and of course Europe, Danger also recently released his new â€œ09/17 2009â€³ EP earlier this month.
