If you're downloading this, it's because you're of a certain age and you're an obscure twat (like me) when it comes to musical preferences, you'll appreciate how hard it can be to find the good stuff. This is the good stuff.

Please seed at least as much as you leach! I've got a crappy connection, so I'll seed for 10x, then I'm doing the next one!

NME Singles of the Week 1992, anyone?"
