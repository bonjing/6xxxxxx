,poolpee,2011-01-16T06:49Z,Since when does Microsoft have ANYTHING to do with A+ certification?
,javaidrana1,2011-01-16T10:00Z,Great Torrent. I was looking for this. Very useful content. Thanks for uploading and sharing.
,Nlightend,2011-01-17T08:38Z,"poolpee - M$ has EVERYTHING to do with A+ training.  I'm taking a CompTIA (Computer Technology Industry Association, not specifically  affiliated with M$) A+ course and I thought it would cover OS's in general but I learned that it covers only M$.  Oh well, anything to score a job in the current economy.  BTW, I primarily use GNU/Linux, but I do have Win 7 installed as a dual-boot secondary OS, tho I hardly ever use it."
,SuperBleatch,2011-06-23T06:22Z,This is the third edition copy righted 2001.  The exam has changed enough that this book maybe a good introduction or reference but probably not the material you want to use if you are trying to get your certification.
,mikelarry330,2011-10-07T10:39Z,it is the old version but still very useful especially for someone who's not to familiar with every bit and piece of the computer. plus it teaches the basics of every computer and has a good binary section too.
