,apple016,2011-01-18T20:44Z,"hey prashant how are you man.
well screens looks good.gonna DL it .
and hell 100th rip is coming,congrats dude.

advice:
(take it if like it otherwise just ignore it :P)

dude movies like 'elf' or some other movie who's rating comparatively low, i mean in b\w 6.5 to 7.5 should rip as 480p becoz by doing this you'll reduce size. Becoz for lots of user size also do matter sometimes for me also lol ,that's why i think lots of users will like this idea.{PC users too}. and 2nd In my opinion Movies with low rating don't deserve 720p lolz.{Mind it I'm not talking about movies like Dark Knight or inception. }"
[V],prashant22,2011-01-18T21:54Z,"@apple
welcome...n ya i should hv done elf in 480p...
i'll see to that..bt till now if u leave elf all other 1gb+ 720p's i hv done deserved what they got..."
,skillet92,2011-01-19T07:55Z,"by wat day and time is Dark Knight up?
Cant wait for it!"
[V],prashant22,2011-01-19T11:30Z,"@skillet
Encoding it right now..it will take 27 hrs(from now) to encode.."
,skillet92,2011-01-19T12:08Z,"oh...great news!
Waiting very badly!
and is there any email i can reach on ?"
,kprakash,2011-01-19T15:31Z,"@prashant22 i really mean it, i had actually watched ur and his rips today only and the movie were just awesome and i thank u guys (GokU61 & RiddlerA)

and Pls dont take it on otherwise............."
,kprakash,2011-01-19T15:37Z,"@prashant22 By the way, What did ""GokU61"" really mean ?

                   ARE u from india (as the name suggest it) ?"
[V],prashant22,2011-01-19T18:19Z,"@skillet
u can join sceneundergroung and can pm me there...
"
,apple016,2011-01-19T19:33Z,"yeah you are correct other than elf or some other movie all yours 720p rips deserves what they got..
ok with all respect this topic closed here. xD
becoz what done is done. we can do nothing about it ryt? lolz
but the point is u liked my advice .thats cool.
and man what did u say ,""Encoding it right now..it will take 27 hrs(from now) to encode.. ""
man u must've got lots of patient. i can rip one movie in b/w 1-2:50 hr and in mean time i got really pissed. But u just said 27 hrs u must've been joking hai na bhai. 
but if its true what u r saying, than hats off to you man. keep it up man.dammm 27 hrs hell......"
[V],prashant22,2011-01-20T05:31Z,"@apple
NO m nt joking...it takes less time as u hv a good processor..
My processor is nt good as urs so for me it takes too much time..
27hrs is the time of 2nd pass 8hrs for 1st pass..
ALthough this is the case with dark knight only as it is a long movie nd resolution is also 1280x720 nt 1280x528..
More the resolution more the time..."
,apple016,2011-01-20T11:32Z,"man now my liking towards you is increased.
becoz with that type of pc doin this type of work really means alot.
lolz for me, ripping is a pain in my ass.
thx for all ur hard work and time"
