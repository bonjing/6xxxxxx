In fact, it's convinced me to preorder the game as soon as I have $30 to spare, just so I can support these awesome guys and have access to more of these weekly alphas. (I'm the kind of guy who loves to watch those ""making of"" special features on DVDs, so having that same level of behind-the-scenes access to a fully interactive game is just all kinds of cool.)

It crashes as soon as I add any characters or switch to ""Rabbot"" mode under 10.5, but seems to work alright under 10.6."

Thank you in advance and I will wait for your reply."
,Shunnabunich,2011-01-19T01:13Z,"@StrifeSilver: This torrent contains only the Mac version. There don't appear to be any Windows versions available on TPB at the moment, and according to Wolfire's blog, the Linux version has yet to be released at all, as it's waiting on the availability of a component called ""Awesomium"" (a Chromium/WebKit implementation? There's an in-game web browser, after all, and the UI is web-based).

Looks like you'll have to either (a) wait and hope someone posts a copy of the Windows version, (b) preorder the game and get it the official way, or (c) enter the wonderful world of Hackintoshery. :)"
,vichetmeng,2011-01-20T08:59Z,To update the game to a newer version. Use this : http://api.appcelerator.net/p/pages/app_page?token=K4pZ06Z6

,FrankOmg,2011-07-29T02:17Z,Please seed! This looks like a fun game! :D
