,LongDistanceStulla,2011-02-19T06:30Z,"I downloaded and installed it alos installed the update but i get the cannot locate the SimCity 4 Deluxe play disk and I should insert it, select OK and restart the game.
What have I missed?
NB. I was getting the message before I installed the update aswell."
,LongDistanceStulla,2011-02-19T06:38Z,"Ohh, one more note, the third disc is infact the same as disk 2, when mounted it has the same name and contents."
,dinumatrix,2011-02-19T14:44Z,"@LongDistanceStulla 

You have to mount with daemon tools or Alcohol 120% to pay the game.

And disk 3 is same as disk 2 but disk 3 is mini play disk it only 23MB."
,DirtySawth,2011-02-21T22:21Z,Thanks! It's been a while since I hadn't play this game!

The UK version was pissing me off."
,yummegatron1412,2011-06-08T12:51Z,"Already installed all of it. Mounted the Play Disk with Daemon Tools but I was still unable to open it, still receiving the pop-up message 'cannot locate the SimCity 4 Deluxe play disk and I should insert it, select OK and restart the game.'?

What should I do?"
,slimescared01,2011-08-16T08:55Z,"made it to work...

1. mount the two image files, i used alcohol on disk 1 and daemon tools on disk 2, 

2. install

3. open the mounted disk 1, when the menu appears, don't click anything. open the mounted disk 2, then click play"
,tropovia,2011-12-16T00:22Z,"how do you add a mod from simtropolis.com? I know the process of downloading it and use the winrar but where do I put it so it works? IT says you have to put it in plugins but apparently it doesn't work, please help!"
