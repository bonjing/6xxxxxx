After Roberta stands Donna up at the school carnival, Donna is hurt when she realizes how much they have grown apart. Donna tries to explain to Cleveland how she feels for support, but Cleveland instead criticizes her parenting skills. Cleveland seems to think he's such a good parent, so Donna decides to let him test his parenting skills on a teenage girl and leaves him to deal with Roberta by himself. In an attempt to win Roberta's approval, Cleveland lets her throw a house party, which ends up causing her to run off with her new boyfriend, Diego, and leading Cleveland, Federline and Raymond on a wild goose chase to save her.
