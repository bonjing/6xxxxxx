Yazoo's Praise God I'm Satisfied is an excellent collection of 14 tracks Blind Willie Johnson recorded in the '30s, including such numbers as "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed," "Praise God I'm Satisfied," "Rain Don't Fall on Me" and "Jesus Is Coming Soon." These are excellent, haunting recordings, boasting some stellar guitar work, but everything that's on this disc and its companion, Sweeter as the Years Go By, is included on Columbia/Legacy's The Complete Recordings of Blind Willie Johnson, which makes this unnecessary for any serious listener.
