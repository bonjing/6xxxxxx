,thclsd,2011-01-23T13:53Z,"Sorry about that, I've got a very slow connection. Last I check most peers were at about 87%."
,Gyo911,2011-01-26T02:36Z,"Thanks for the upload, happy to seed."
,fullauto223,2011-07-05T04:26Z,"I just found this torrent, I will seed as long as there are leechers so long as I can get 100% done.  Thanks and thanks for posting a decent quality version of this."
,fullauto223,2011-07-06T03:03Z,"My download finally completed today, I will be seeding this from now on for anyone that wants it."

Speaking without notes (unlike Dr Dembski), incisive and clear thinking (ditto), unfailingly polite (ditto again), Hitch takes every point in the Creationist/Religious apologist canon and answers it to devastating effect.
