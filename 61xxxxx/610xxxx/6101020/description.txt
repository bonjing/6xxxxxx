                    Karen and Connor return hoping to start afresh,  
                    but on a routine visit to her psychiatric  
                    hospital Karen is shocked to discover Frank,  
                    who seems vulnerable and confused. Frank's  
                    odyssey comes to an end when he finally faces  
                    his deepest self and the sobering truth of his  
                    feelings for Libby. Sita is distraught when she  
                    fails her exams, but the offer of help from her  
                    lecturer Cromer comes with conditions.   
                    Motivated by lust, Carl steps in to help.
