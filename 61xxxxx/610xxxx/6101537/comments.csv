For everybody else that may think this to be suspicious, the majority of AV programs will find cracks and patches to be viruses because of the coding used to create them. Also, what antivirus will ant itself to be pirated?"
,who_m_i,2011-01-20T12:43Z,@LoonyJ how do u stop avast from removing the ashbase.dll at startup
,kic923,2011-01-21T01:42Z,"@who_m_i
you can do that by adding ashbase.dll to avast's exclusion list. From avast main page, go to file system shield-expert settings-exclusions- and add the folder where you downloaded the cracked file.  it is always advised to replace the file in safe mode."
