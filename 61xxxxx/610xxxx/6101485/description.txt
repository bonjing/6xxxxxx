This rom is CM6 for the Verizon Fascinates, its Froyo based on the CyanogenMOD codebase.

This rom is a VERY early alpha! Don't expect anything to work in any way!

Please do not submit bug reports, I know whats broken at this point!!!

EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE A *HUGE* THANKS TO IVORYCRUNCHER WHO DONATED THE FASCINATE TO ME AND MADE THIS ALL POSSIBLE!

Other thanks:
Thanks to Birdman and JT1134 for helping me get up to speed on the Fascinate,
and for their Eclair RIL modifications to get me going on the Froyo RIL!
And JT for pointing out that I commented a line I shouldn't have 

YOU MUST BE ON A VOODOO KERNEL PRIOR TO FLASHING ANY OF THIS!!!

INCOMPLETE LIST OF THINGS THAT DON'T WORK
Sensors
Lights
GPS
Camera
Wifi
Just about all the rest of the hardware

INCOMPLETE LIST OF THINGS THAT *DO* WORK
Calls
Audio
Data
SMS

V1:
BE SURE TO FLASH NEW KERNEL!

Data now works
Sms now works
SDCard mounts properly
A big thanks to jt1134 for helping me through my giant mental block on SMS with his awesome sms patches!
