This is the classic film starring Jeff Morrow and Mara Corday. Fred F. Sears directed this as a straight sci-fi film. but the amazing giant space bird makes this a true cinematic wonder. I read that Jeff Morrow would go and see his film open in the small town he lived in.  He had not seen the giant bird special effect untill he watch the film with his local towns folk. He had to sneak out of the theatre ounce he saw the giant bird on screen. It's amazingly bad.
