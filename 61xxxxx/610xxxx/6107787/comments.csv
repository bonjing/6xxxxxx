It's how the audio is deviced to work. When U run VLC, on the top you'd see a drop down option for Audio, click on that and make sure the setting is set to 'Stereo'. You may not get audio if you aren't hooked up to a home theatre. I know this should solve the problem you face. Enjoy viewing! Cheers"

If you're the kind of person who can only watch films where stuff explodes every few minutes then you should know that this one won't fit the bill in terms of entertaining you by reading the plot description.  It's about finely nuanced acting and character development not mindless violence.

Back to the point.  Haven't had a chance to watch this fully, but the rip quality is outstanding and I can see why Colin Firth is getting such high praise.  Maybe this is the thing that'll turn him from a supporting man to a fully-fledged Hollywood star."

There are plenty of substance films i like too. Oh I get it, 'you dont like what i like so i will call u mindless or patronise u'. A LOT of angry peeps on here i think:).....I know lets all be the same....very interesting lol. I like to eat steak, if u cant understand why i like it then why dont u get all vicious about it lmfao at small minded peeps"
