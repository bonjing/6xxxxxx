Some times you may wish to change the display language of Windows from other languages to English


Your Windows displays text in menus, titles etc in a certain language, mostly in English. It depends on in which country you have bought your PC and Windows. It is done this way because everyone should be comfortable with Windows talking to him in his native language. But Windows is a multi-user operating system, each of the users can be native in the different language or probably you are learning the foreign language and want to train you vocabulary even starting from your home computer interface.


Please note that most applications installed to Windows displays its interface in a language selected in Windows. This way your switching between display languages affects display languages in your installed applications.
