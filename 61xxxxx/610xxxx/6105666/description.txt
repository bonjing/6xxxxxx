Madness - Driving in My Car [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Driving in My Car" is a single by Madness. It was released on July 24, 1982, and spent eight weeks on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number four. It reached number twenty on the Australian Singles Chart.

From the video and most of the lyrics, the track is about a Morris Minor that was used by the group in the early years before band became famous as seen in the film Take It or Leave It. The lyrics, however, do lend themselves to a little artistic license, e.g. the Morris was not built by the Tyne, it was built at Cowley, Oxfordshire.

"Driving in My Car" was the thirteenth in a run of twenty consecutive UK top twenty hits for Madness, and is the only one of those twenty never to have been officially released on a Madness album in the USA.

This promo video shows Madness as car mechanics larking about in their workshop, and in their normal suits driving around in their "Maddiemobile" - a white 1959 model Morris Minor. The members of fellow ska/pop group Fun Boy Three make a brief appearance, trying (and failing) to hitch a ride to their home town of Coventry, which the A45 mentioned in the song passes through.

It has been claimed that the video was an influence on U2's video for "Sweetest Thing" in 1998.
