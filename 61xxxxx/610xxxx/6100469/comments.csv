,retux,2011-01-13T22:23Z,"Kaspersky has been screwing me over lately. I installed it before I got actual keys for it, and I just used the trial key for the first month, why not right?

Within a couple days, Kaspersky blocked it.

Anyways, I used these keys, it worked great. All three are for around the 79 day mark."
