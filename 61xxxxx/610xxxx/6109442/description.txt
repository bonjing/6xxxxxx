Ã›    The primary idea of Octav8r is to create multiple pitch-shifted layers of Ã›

Ã›  the incoming audio. With some twiddling you can get creative with panning   Ã›

Ã›  to generate separation around the stereo field, use envelopes to bring each Ã›

Ã›  each node sit differently in the mix. You can use the tempo-sync envelope   Ã›
