Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys is a 1994 documentary produced, written and directed by Adi Sideman. In the film, members of the pedophile/pederasty advocacy organization North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) discuss why they support sexual relationships between men and boys below the age of consent. The film helped raise awareness of the group. A "chickenhawk," in gay slang, refers to a man who prefers sex with underage boys.
