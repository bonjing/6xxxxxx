,troutsniffer,2011-07-18T15:03Z,"Thanks. I used to play this game 5 years ago.

For those having trouble installing the game, this is what I did without mounting the ISO files etc...

1. Extract all 3 ISO files to folders with 7zip (or whatever other program you use)

2. Open up the CD2 folder and copy all the files to the CD1 folder. You can also grab more files from the CD3 folder.

3. Now just run the setup

4. When installed, copy the crack file into "" C:/Program Files/UnrealTournament/System

5. Now play"
