,Weasel_Weevil,2011-04-20T22:43Z,"I have downloaded this file and there are no viruses and they installed fine. Keygens worked and everything.

But whenever I try to run the game, it just loads, gives me a grey screen and shuts down. No error messages or anything. Just the game shuts down. I am running Windows XP and have mounted it on Daemon Tools. I tried to make it compatible with Windows 95/98/NT/2000 but nothing happens. Any solution please?"

Or you can try updating DirectX / Updating your video card drivers"
