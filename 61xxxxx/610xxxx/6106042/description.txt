The Clangers enjoy the simple things in life, like green soup and blue-string pudding and are happy to share their moon with unforgettable characters such as the Soup Dragon, the Froglets, several Glow Buzzers, the Iron Chicken and any other visitor who may decide to drop in.

Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin, the creators of such classics as Bagpuss, Ivor The Engine, Pogles Wood and Noggin the Nog, made these magical programmes thirty years ago, but they are timeless as space itself and are here, ready to entertain a new generation.
