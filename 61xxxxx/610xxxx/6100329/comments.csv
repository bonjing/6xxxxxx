,camo12345,2011-01-15T22:13Z,"@justcallmejamie: Shut it! 

This film is near DVD quality, by that I mean it's a copy of a DVD rip (or Screener). 

A/V 9/10

As for the movie itself, I thought it was pretty good... i've seen a few films with the same kinda storyline though."

Decent video quality; however, audio was about 0.2ms out of sync with the video. Kinda pissed but there's nothing VLC can't do. Not recommended for anyone with a larger than 1027x768 resolution monitor. "
,gc00l,2011-01-16T04:07Z,"Incomplete movie, stop at 1:08:20."
,romeoluv2539,2011-01-16T06:26Z,"The reason you cant find a link to youtube becuz its unlisted....i will provide it now. This movie rocks.

,walkerneo1,2011-01-16T23:01Z,"@Pilotatc999

Wtf are you talking about? Vlc has two hotkeys for audio delay. I can't remember what they are, but you can just look it up.

@zakimar

I thought devil was pretty good. I'm no fan of movies focused on confined spaces, but I think they pulled it off pretty well. "
,SLiM16,2011-01-17T03:33Z,"@walkerneo1

Pilotatc999 said there's nothing VLC CAN'T do, as in, VLC fixed the audio delay problem for him. Unless of course his grammar is worse than your ability to comprehend English.

A/V 8/9"
,michaelingeorgia,2011-01-18T00:59Z,"Great quality. Thanks to the uploader. Unfortunately, however, the movie itself leaves much to be desired. The premise is similar to Saw, with people who have attempted suicide being given a second chance to challenge fate and ""become reborn"". But there's nothing creative here to make it interesting. The Saw films featured gore at every turn, urban dungeons, and clever mechanisms. Here, it's just a guy with a gun in a nondescript room. Of course, like all such films these days, there is the shocker/twist ending... which is neither shocking or twisted. 

In this case, the fault is definitely that of the writers, who let down an otherwise competent and experienced cast (including a former Bond Girl and veteran actor Elias Koteas). Cinematography and art direction are both quite good. The director seems to have gotten what he could out of the poor script, and there are moments where the direction held promise, but ultimately the director, too, is at fault for nothing bringing something more to the screen. 

Seldom do I simply say to stay away from a film. But I do so in this case not because of how bad it is, but rather because how good it wasn't. Bad can sometimes be fun to watch. But seeing this, and knowing how it could have been fairly good, was just 90 minutes of frustration. Shoot the writers, replace the director, and get everyone else back for the film they should have made in the first place."

,gunbike,2011-01-18T17:49Z,"Pretty decent movie, but I'd stick with SAW.

Good actors, script, and story. Worthwhile download and watch.The one imdb review is misleading so judge for yourself."
,kissing_hitler,2011-01-20T17:53Z,"This film is fucking shite.
Its a cheap version of ""saw"" with no gore.
Dont waste your time. "
