But I could really use the Excercise files though.  If I find them, I'll up them.  But if you do, I'd appreciate it."
,Bendy_B,2011-01-27T18:37Z,>> Anyone know where I can get exercise files from? Thanks!! 
,bobcarr,2011-01-28T20:12Z,"No problem, i wll see if i can get hold of the exercise files and post the link here if i can upload them.. sorry about F4V format, i originally did this for a friend and we both use VLC so dint bother converting them to AVI, but i will do for future ups"
,Joe1Fixer,2011-01-29T01:30Z,"Thanks for that bobcarr.  As for the Excercise Files, if anyone else is looking for it, there is an alternative.  Download this torrent from the bay: Lynda.Com.Adobe.Dreamweaver.CS5.New.Features.5507143.TPB - there is an Exercise File that comes with this tutorial (Also by James Williamson) and it's close to the one used in the ET.   "
,Joe1Fixer,2011-01-31T20:56Z,"Forget the previous post.  Best way to get the Exercise Files is to just grab the entire site at http://www.explorecalifornia.org - google:  WinWSD, a free website download did the job.  "
,bobcarr,2011-02-02T21:29Z,"Good find joe, just tried WinWSD out and it works great"
,19blade93,2011-03-27T11:56Z,@Joe1Fixer: hello i'm a computer science student living in asia and i wonder what's the connection of this site: http://www.explorecalifornia.org to the exercise files and can u give me the EXACT link for me to download the exercise files coz i can't get it and i hope u understand. kinda confused i hope u respond plsss next school year i'll be making websites gaah :(
,crap1283,2011-04-13T15:11Z,"Thanks bobcarr..I found the exercise files! i downloaded this torrent http://bitsnoop.com/lynda-com-dreamweaver-cs5-essential-q10496736.html and skipped every file except the Exercise Files, which is 800MB+ .. Hope it helps"
,Joe1Fixer,2011-04-16T14:20Z,"Hey --blade--, explorecalifornia.org is not a real site.  Rather, it's a ficticious site that was used in a number of Lynda.com's CS5 Dreamweaver related training videos.  Example is this DW.CS5 ET as well as the one by J. Lowery on the Wordpress3 training to setup a blog site; plus few more series I suspect.  

Best to use this free tool from http://www.httrack.com/ to download this extire site to you pc, set it as local site in Dreamweaver CS5 to use as exercise files for the video.  

After grabbing the extire site,  Good place to copy it to is (for WAMP example) c:\wamp\www\explorecalifornia\ .

Hope that helps, good luck in school. "

,G-Unit_Hacker,2011-10-04T16:31Z,"Will it be okay with you if i compress this and re-upload it? I won't delete or add anything, And will credit you in the description. OK?"
,AlexReborn,2011-10-12T12:35Z,Demonoid version has the ex files included.
,tre.fire,2011-10-13T23:38Z,"@bobcarr, thanks for the post

And @ crap1283, thanks for the ex files torrent link. Seems to be good."
,tre.fire,2011-10-18T20:15Z,"Actually, those exercise files are already done starting with CSS. Not too useful. haven't checked the other link to see about those."
