Robust and rip-roaring musical that has stood the test of time as one of the very best. Based on the 1944 Broadway musical by Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Jerome Robbins, and Leonard Bernstein. The last of the three films that starred Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, and the first of three films that Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen would co-direct.
