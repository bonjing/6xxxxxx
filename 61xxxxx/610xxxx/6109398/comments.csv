,grfam,2011-01-18T01:49Z,hope we'll get all :) thanx!
,WunderSpazz,2011-01-18T03:15Z,I will seed for as long as it takes.
,karakorama,2011-01-18T14:01Z,Thanks!
,Jimstalk,2011-01-18T15:20Z,im afraid that i need a new hard disc
,davincighost,2011-01-18T17:20Z,"tip: you dont need to get all 41GB stuf, you can choose what area you like and download only that, look at megascenary site the number of each area, in your torrent look at files and select the files you want to get."
,snapshot88,2011-01-18T19:46Z,Who in hell would download 41.2GB of scenery for just one state? thats retarded. Fill your HD up for just one area.
,WunderSpazz,2011-01-20T14:52Z,"@snapshot88  Well, your more than welcome to not download it then.  I tend to think its totally worth it.  Please take your negativity elsewhere.  "
,carpent,2011-01-23T17:19Z,Any chance for Megascenery Earth Utah from you?
,fsxflyer,2011-01-24T14:14Z,Cheers for the upload 10% left for me to go :>) 
,torro66,2011-01-25T18:59Z,"Hi, Wunderspazz.

Downloaded all the tiles, but the extracter is saying file 33, and 37 are corrupt and won't extract.  Can you re-upload them? Thanks"
,johnsluts,2011-01-25T19:22Z,"file 33 and 37 are corrupted, can someone upload them please thanks"
,torro66,2011-01-25T19:24Z,"Hi, Wunderspazz.

Downloaded all the tiles, but the extracter is saying file 33, and 37 are corrupt and won't extract.  Can you re-upload them? Thanks"
,WunderSpazz,2011-01-25T21:16Z,"Sorry about 33 and 37.  I might have to redownload them myself.  Stand by.  @carpent Sorry, I dont have that one.  I'd very much like to get a hold of it however.  So please let me know if you do find it somewhere."
,WunderSpazz,2011-01-25T21:23Z,So here is a noob question for you guys.  I have a working 33 and 37.  How do I get them to you? Do I recompile the torrent with the new files?  Or do I have to make a new separate one for just those files?
,memphian1,2011-01-26T15:52Z,"It would be easier if you just uploaded files 33 and 37 for now, and maybe at some point, re-up the whole thing. Just one man's opinion."
,torro66,2011-01-27T10:27Z,"Wunderspazz, if you could just add the 2 files and upload, it would be great, and save me downloading the whole lot again.

Thanks"
,torro66,2011-01-27T10:39Z,"Wunderspazz, if you could zip the 2 corrupt files and re-upload, that would be great, and would save me having to download the whole lot again.  Thanks"
,memphian1,2011-01-27T14:02Z,"@sp769 Hey, take it easy my friend... Wunder asked if he should just upload the two files or the whole thing.... I was merely saying that he should upload the two corrupt files ASAP so we could all enjoy it and **MAYBE** upload the whole thing again. I wasn't saying he SHOULD... Just that if he had the option, that might be the way to do it. If that was an expensive option, then don't do it.... I have to be careful with when and how often I seed and upload, as my ISP is one that tends to ""notice"" large uploads and will ""throttle"" the speeds downwards."
,xorxor,2011-01-28T21:57Z,"WunderSpazz,

first of all: thank you :)

second: Do you have all of these .zip files on hard disk (I mean the same .zip files except parts 33,37 of course?)."
,torro66,2011-02-02T08:41Z,"Pulled the files 33 & 37 again, but still the same corruption.  Pls resend.  Ta"
,kevandkaz,2011-03-04T20:32Z,"Perfect, thanx much, i shall seed as long as i can :0)

as for the 2 broken files, i'd upload them seperate i think, just uploading this size file again wouldn't be nice, thanx again"
,_SnakEye,2011-03-08T07:59Z,can some one post here the URL for the 2 repaired 33 & 37 that were reuploaded?
,heli3,2011-04-28T02:44Z,Req: Aerosoft Diamond DA-20 Katana 4X
,shergg,2011-11-16T09:10Z,plz seed 3.5kb/sec
,kamanba,2012-06-08T23:30Z,"someone is talking about files 33 and 37 , are they OK ? thanks ."
,kamanba,2012-06-08T23:34Z,could you send me 33 and 37 please ?
,kamanba,2012-06-11T11:13Z,33 AND 37 please !!!
