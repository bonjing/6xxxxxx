,cochat,2011-01-16T20:13Z,"Yes, please
Thanks"
,legolash2o,2011-01-16T20:25Z,"Ok i will try and upload it tomorrow, it will be an image with both x86 and x64 versions in the same install.wim"
,yashaka71107,2011-01-16T21:32Z,"windows sp1 am already install it and its has only 1.8 gig on x86, why here is 2.8 gig, please explain????????"
,yashaka71107,2011-01-16T21:35Z,"microsoft site i download only 1.8 gig cuz mine got license on x86, 32 bit;"
,legolash2o,2011-01-16T22:01Z,"There is a 1.8GB disk which has SP1 setup files on them ""Windows6.1-KB976932-X64"" and ""Windows6.1-KB976932-X86"", this is the actual Windows installation disk with Home Basic, Home Premium, Ultimate and Profession Editions, all with SP1 integrated.

Useful for those who want to fresh install with SP1 already installed.

I integrated the updates myself and have tested them :)"

I have just noted that in the x86 ISO there is an extra install.wim by accident, it can be deleted :)"
