This must be one of the best, and most beautiful movies ever to have been made.

Before seeing this one I always avoided the romance genre though, as a movie freak, I've seen quite many, but after seeing this one it became a priority to watch the romance/drama combo.

Go for this one, you won't regret it.

And a big thanks to you Jonny for an awesome post."

I'm sure it'll be superb.

Thank you for the torrent Jonny."
