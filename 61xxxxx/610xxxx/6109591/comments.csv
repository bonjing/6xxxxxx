,UKBob,2011-01-18T00:50Z,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but 720 x 400 is not ""Highres"".

Standard def is 720 x 480
The lowest ""Highdef"" is 1280 x 720

Therefore, this aint ""Highdef"""
,onegreatguy,2011-01-18T06:45Z,The audio isn't synced properly... It lags the video by a second or so...
,UKBob,2011-01-18T11:10Z,"AUDIO SYNC is way off.
NOT HIGHRES

I would not recommend downloading this copy."
,Sarah23au,2011-02-08T02:38Z,I also had problems with the audio being out of sync. Thanks for the upload though.
