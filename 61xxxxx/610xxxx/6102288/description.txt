           Based on a true story, this film shares with us a decade       
           in the lives of Jimmie Lewallen and his wife Carrie as         
           they experience the joys of love and marriage alongside        
           the tragedies of war and poverty (1939-1949). Jimmie and       
           his friends, Bill Blair and Fred Harb, find escape from        
           life's challenges in racing born out of hauling moonshine      
           on warm North Carolina evenings and inadvertently become       
           racing's earliest heroes. Ultimately, their antics laid        
           the groundwork for what has become one of the most             
           lucrative sports in the world. A number of racing firsts       
           occur during The Fightin' Forties, making this film a          
           sensational history lesson as well as an exciting journey      
           of romance, friendship and action.
