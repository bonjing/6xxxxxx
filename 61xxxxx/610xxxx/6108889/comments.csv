,mrd2011,2011-01-22T02:05Z,"hey, question. I saw how to burn these using imgburn, but if you don't want to put the file onto a disc, how do you watch it? Blu rays are expensive. I was going to put the movies on an external hdd, how do I turn the iso file into a watchable movie file?"
,thewarkat,2011-01-27T05:11Z,This is great! Do you rip from Blu-Ray? Can we chip in on your Netflix subscription?!? haha!!

Read the notes, schmuck."
,OldBosun,2011-03-17T23:45Z,Simply Excellent-at least as good as the best 5 GB mkv version plus highly desirable dts audio and an unexpected bonus: chapters. Remember what a big hit aXXo was shrinking a DVD to CD size with good quality? HD-R-US is doing a superb job giving us excellent quality HD video/audio that can be burned to a 15 cent blank DVD. Can't be beat.
