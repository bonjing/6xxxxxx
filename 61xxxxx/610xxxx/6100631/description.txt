An album which started an excellent J-Core compilation series of (currently four) albums. This release, the original, focuses more on the trance/hardcore side, along with Hardcore Syndrome 2.The third and fourth focus on gabber and hardstyle respectively. All four in the series are some very well-developed, varied, and high-quality J-Core from the Hardcore Tano*C circle.
I recommend Cascading Emotions (Trance/Hardcore) by Joshka/JAKAZiD as the best track on the album and Warp Attacker (Hardcore) by DJ Champ vs REDALiCE in second. Take it for what it is, the start of a good series, one that has continued to get better with each release.
