,vtskge,2011-01-28T14:32Z,"This is my very first comment, I used axxo a very long time ago and then he disappeared.  Axxo had very excellent reviews all the time with all the work that he did and he made it easy for anyone to use his work.  

I've been reading comments after comments on the movies, and I myself have tried Axxo out and I'm not disappointed in the least.

What I do have to say is this: Whether it is the real ""Axxo"" or someone stepping up to ""Axxo's"" name, is definitely living up to his name.  

Either way, we don't have a right to complain or even ask if it's the real ""Axxo.""  They are doing us a favor by allowing us to watch the movie!  Be thankful for just that.

Buried is a very good movie.  At first, I thought that the movie didn't work because it was black and quiet.  WAIT, this out, does take about a minute, and then you will know why.  

Very good movie, good quality, and thank you for your time for uploading it for my family and I to watch!"
