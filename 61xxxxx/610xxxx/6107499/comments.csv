One question: normally for Enterprise Linux a serial number or something like this is needed. Did anyone tried to install that Linux ?"

,noel_lee,2011-02-28T15:19Z,anyone show me how to install this..
,cPanel.vn,2011-03-18T19:53Z,Downloading. Thanks
,tupacrulz,2011-04-30T10:11Z,how to install???
,MadBOOTer,2011-05-04T17:14Z,"How to install? Ahay Ayay.. if your playing in Linux you should already be skilled enough in the .iso format to either mount the image in VM, or use something like Nero to burn a DVD for you. There is your free help. Great Torrent! Thanks again... you'll never be able to download updates - thats how RH makes its money. But 6.0 works flawlessly. PS - use the ""Graphical Installation"" noobs."
,dentonpirate,2011-05-19T03:46Z,"It never fails to FLOOR me to see other pirates being such dick heads! 

We are here and this is possible because of SHARING! Its knowledge and should be FREELY SHARED MadBOOTer!!

Here, for all the linux newbies out there.....

I wasnt going to download this, but since reading the above posting, I am going to post an ENTIRE ""how to"" install for this torrent..... Once downloaded and everything checks out ok :)

Really, MadBOOTer, its because of someone like me that this site, linux or even torrents for that matter, even exist!

Knowledge is power... REVEL in it!

,dentonpirate,2011-05-19T16:55Z,"Ok... as promised, here it is!

If you are trying to do this in a ""virtual"" environment, Virtual Box is free and easily setup for newbies... Here is a link, though its kind of old the setup is almost the same. http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing

If you are putting this on an actual machine, then just burn the .iso image to a DVD. That sounds complicated, but really all it involves is right clicking the disk image and then click ""burn disc image""...... THATS IT... let it go and soon you will have a bootable DVD. Stick it in the machine and boot to it. Follow the instructions from there........

,dentonpirate,2011-05-19T16:57Z,"For windows, Virtual Box is probably best as its free and easily setup for newbies. 

http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing

If you are burning to disc to actuall be put on a machine, then just right click the is and ""burn disc image""... thats it! Load that DVD into a machine and let it go....

Confirmed working on Win7 x64"
,nark0z,2011-06-14T22:53Z,"^Great stuff. Installing via VirtualBox as we speak :)
Allocated 512MB and 20GB hard drive space. Let me know here if I should allocate more RAM/HDD space."
,donpao123,2011-07-20T21:02Z,"Thanks for the upload, it works on VMware on Win 7 64. The only problem is the registration for software updates, I receive Error Class Code: 70. I guess you cannot register it:(!"

,jaaskocody15,2012-01-28T04:03Z,whats so great about linux anyway?? is it better than windows 7?
,Plan9x128,2012-02-10T18:16Z,@hari111984 Don't unzip it. Just burn it into a disk (using any burning software like Nero or IMGBurn) or you can try mounting and test in Vmware/VirtualBox. 
,The NbL,2012-02-11T12:07Z,"@jaaskocody15
 Linux is free. Programs are free. No driver disks. No antivirus necessary (i run clam). All updates are free. Red Hat is a little advanced for the noob. Try Ubuntu or Mint first. The installs are idiotproof. Learn the magic of the LIVEcd...how to use Gparted. After you get the hang of it you will feel foolish for not coming over to the darkside sooner...you will come to loathe everything ever Windows and all the cash you have thrown at M$ over the years...or is that just me? Tutorials are readily available on YouTube."
