Kaya Dub consists of some wicked instrumental dubs using the backing tracks of Bob Marley's Kaya album, produced by Bunny Lee and mixed by Prince Jammy in the mid 70s. Musicians used on this album were The Aggrovators, a band assembled by Bunny Lee and iThe Wire (p.73) - "These have Prince Jammy at the top of his game, especially on the version of Jackie Edward's take of 'So Jah Sey', with triumphal horns draped across the rhythm and liberal release of the vocals in the mix."
