Encoders Notes:
Ok so the video wasnt to bad, a bit blurry & the colours where off.
I dropped the source into vdubmod.
I sharpened it, increased the saturation then i changed the colours with a rgb eq.
Finaly i muxed my encode to T0XiC-iNK's Line.
It does look better than the source.
It is over cropped which i cant do anything about.
Its watchable & miles better than the cam release.
Enjoy another Kingdom Release
