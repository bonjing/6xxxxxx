In Our Time is a long-running live BBC radio programme in which Melvyn Bragg guides three expert guests through a 40 minute discussion of the week\'s subject. The show\'s tag-line is \"exploring the history of ideas\" and subject matter jumps eclectically from science to history, literature, religion and philosophy. The experts are almost always erudite and able to explain the sometimes-complex material so as to be understandable to the reasonably educated layman.
