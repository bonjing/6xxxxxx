This has seriously bad aspect ratio. Looks like someones taken the screen and stretched it it vertically. 

How can you release something that embarrassingly badly done and waste my time and ratio????????????????"

Nothing is wrong with the movie, good UL Treystar ..
And y cosmikel get yourself a new hobby instead of lying about things when people are kind and upload.
Thanks Treystar for always have good UL
