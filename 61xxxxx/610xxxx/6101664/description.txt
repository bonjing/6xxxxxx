Johnny has come over to his sister's place to fix her computer, which of course she didn't leave for him, but isn't even home. The weather is terrible, so he decides to just crash in her spare bedroom. When he enters the room, he sees Raven, his sisters best friend. She moved away 2 years ago with her douchebag boyfriend. They have always had a connection, and when they talk, its just like old times. She is single now, and he is ready to finally do what they have always dreamed about.
