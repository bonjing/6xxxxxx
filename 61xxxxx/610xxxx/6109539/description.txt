Gordon Ramsay loves sharks, and this passion leads him on his most personal mission yet - to investigate the controversial dish, shark fin soup.

It's estimated that each year 100 million sharks are killed worldwide, and Gordon wants to find out if the slaughter is really necessary. Sharks are both terrifying and beautiful, but experts believe overfishing is threatening to drive a third of the world's open ocean shark species to extinction.

Incredibly, some of the most threatened species remain untouched by international fishing regulations. Hoping to garner support for his plight, and to understand more about these animals, Gordon fearlessly takes a swim with the lethal bull shark. Carrying out his most dangerous challenge to date, the intrepid chef then leads a passionate campaign against the shark fishing industry.


Part of Channel 4's season about the reality behind commercial fishing in the 21st century.
