,jcrboy,2011-01-14T10:55Z,"Quality looks great... standard rip quality.

Big props again"
,TiNiK,2011-01-14T14:39Z,Thanks!
,gogoggbanani,2011-01-14T16:39Z,Thanks and quality is great
,Conan_Fan,2011-01-14T20:41Z,sHoTV is fake.
,bjoernhund,2011-01-15T06:10Z,"Wouldn't say the quality is ""great"" as others commented (the file being a mere 300M says a lot) 
but what ""Conan_Fan"" claims is utter bull. 
Don't know about the other sHoTV rips, 
but this one was real. Here's a snapshot to prove it:

,Conan_Fan,2011-01-15T06:26Z,"I've downloaded many sHoTV torrents, and none of them play in VLC. I've found many comments online claiming they're fake.

Example fake sHoTV file:

You said it worked, what did you use to play it? VLC? Maybe I'll download that one to see if you're right. More than likely it'll be a waste of time. lol "
,Conan_Fan,2011-01-15T07:15Z,"You're right. This is definitely not a fake. Just downloaded it, and it works great.

It's just really odd that all the sHoTV releases I've downloaded before were fakes...

I admit when I'm wrong. :/"
