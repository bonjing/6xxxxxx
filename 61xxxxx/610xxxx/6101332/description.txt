Live At The Cafe Carpe: Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, December 2008 & 2009,is their new venture together which features new and old material spanning such genres as jazz ballads, country, blues, and rock. Release date 01/25/2011.
Since the release of their 2005 album, Redbirdâ€™s enormously popular annual 4 night stands at CafÃ© Carpe in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin have been a highly anticipated event for fans. Redbird Live At The CafÃ© Carpe is culled from their stellar December 2008 and 2009 concerts. David Goodrich, the fourth member of the trio is once again a vital part of this new record, contributing his songâ€š â€˜â€˜Snowed In.â€œ The fourteen track CD includes four originals along with covers of artists as diverse as Rickie Lee Jones, Mississippi John Hurt, Neil Young, Merle Haggard, and Greg Brown. Redbird Live is everything a live album should be- the performersâ€˜ collaborative spark and energy are exquisitely captured, and the material is completely inspired by three songwriters whose musical relationship has only deepened over time and is now on full joyful display.
