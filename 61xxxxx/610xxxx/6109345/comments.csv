Im sorry ur player didnt reconize,  i suggest play it with VLC or just with one of the latest versions of Windows Media Player.
Then all will work

@wardrich
Placed it all in one directory cuz i like to listen them one by one  without have to click and switch from directory to directory.
Tnx for reply guys!
