Speed. Meth. Glass. On the street, methamphetamine has many names. What started as a fad among West Coast motorcycle gangs in the 1970s has spread across the United States, and despite lawmakers\' calls for action, the drug is now more potent, and more destructive, than at any time in the past decade. 

In \"The Meth Epidemic,\" FRONTLINE, in association with The Oregonian, investigates the meth rampage in America: the appalling impact on individuals, families and communities, and the difficulty of controlling an essential ingredient in methâ€”ephedrine and pseudoephedrineâ€”sold legally in over-the-counter cold remedies. 

 
In Congress, a bipartisan coalition has called for international controls on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, either of which is essential for making meth. Many states  have forced cold medicines containing these ingredients off retail shelves and behind the pharmacy counter -- a move that may become a national requirement: these efforts that are blocked by Big Pharma.
