STORY
Maggie (Hathaway) is an alluring free spirit who won't let anyone - or anything - tie her down. But she meets her match in Jamie (Gyllenhaal), whose relentless and nearly infallible charm serve him well with the ladies and in the cutthroat world of pharmaceutical sales. Maggie and Jamie's evolving relationship takes them both by surprise, as they find themselves under the influence of the ultimate drug: love.

BDK NOTES
thanks to SERENITY for such a nice cam. this one was very heavy on the red a little dark and a little noisy. adjusted the red in it cause people dont need to look red also the hue and saturation along with brightness and black levels denoised and sharpened. hope you all enjoy. BDK
