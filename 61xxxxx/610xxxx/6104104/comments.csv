,michaelrwatson,2012-06-25T05:22Z,"Hey twentyforty: WTF?

A 720p rip of Raging Bull..? Good movie, but NOT worth 720p. Even Star Wars, Star Trek, etc. are barely worth 720p. I don't want 90% of my processor power being sucked up to play a friggin movie. (and i'm on a dual core 3GHz machine--a slower machine won't even play it smoothly).

Please get a frickin clue. Thanks."

Are you actually complaining about a high quality torrent someone made, as a service to you?  Are you insane?

You deserve to be slapped."
