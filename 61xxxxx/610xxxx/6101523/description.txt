Notes:
This baby has 4px of a black border on the left side which isn't removable,
removing them will fuckup the pixel AR and thus causing a bad resolution, so
we had to keep them. Better that than no release at all, huh? Rest asure that
we tried our best removing it, it just wasn't do-able.

Casey Ryback has now retired from the Navy and is now a chef at the Mile High
Cafe in Denver, Colorado. Ryback taking his niece Sarah Ryback on a vacation.
They board a train traveling through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to Los
Angeles. Travis Dane takes the train hostage and starts using the train as a
control center in his effort to take control of a top-secret government outer
space super-weapon. Dane built the weapon but was fired by the government
before it was deployed. He has since hooked up with shadowy Middle Eastern
terrorists who have offered him 1 billion dollars to use the satellite to blow
up the Eastern seaboard by targeting a nuclear reactor that is located
underneath the Pentagon. Dane lets the Pentagon know that he's got control of
the weapon by using it to blow up a Chinese chemical plant. Officials can't
stop him because they can't locate his headquarters. As long as the train
keeps moving, his location can't be fixed. Ryback enlists a porter named Bobby
Zachs to help him go after Dane.
