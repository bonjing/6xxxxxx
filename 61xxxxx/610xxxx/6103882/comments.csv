,dlectro,2011-01-28T20:14Z,"There's a WOWOW logo at 29:55 (sucks).
Otherwise it's beautifully clear and sharp."
,wrath954,2011-03-02T11:09Z,"Audio is completely out of quality with video.
Awful."

,Nord1980,2011-11-28T20:05Z,Why does one guy say Audio is out of sync and the rest say its perfect?  Is Wrath594 just a dummy or what?
,altern822,2012-05-01T23:10Z,"wrath954  probably made a bad recording with the software on his computer. 
Or maybe the computer is slow and he just had to play with it, while it was converting.

I had this same issues b4 speeding up my computer with better RAM : )"
