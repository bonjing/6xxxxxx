,smbUK,2011-01-15T11:57Z,Does anyone have the forced English subs for this?
,patsmack,2011-01-16T09:23Z,"Not suitable for play on large screen TVs. 

The blacks (color) are terrible on this rip. "
,User897,2011-01-27T08:47Z,"Looks okay on HDTV, but be advised that the subs ARE NOT for this movie.  They are for the regular release and as a result they go out of sync."
,User897,2011-01-27T08:53Z,"Ah no wonder....

THIS IS NOT THE EXTENDED VERSION!

THANKS FOR NOTHING, ASSHOLE!"

The theatrical version has a run time of 1:30:48.

The unrated extended cut has a run time of 1:33:18.

So you're wrong, this is the extended version.

-------------------------------------------

On to the subtitles issue:

Like countless other HDLiTE releases, the english subs are crap.

So once again I've made properly synced english subs for one of their releases (in this case this release).

You can download proper english subs for this torrent here:

And an A/V/M rating would be nice too..cheers!"

,dbuploader,2011-07-02T22:08Z,"Don't listen to ""ro4eva"". That sub is useless, it's just the english part (what's the point!). After some digging, I found this one that seems to work:
