Background:
Victory is the story of the new Cybertron Supreme Commander, Star Saber,
defending the Earth against the forces of Deszaras, the Destrons' new Emperor
of Destruction. Deszaras desires the planet's energy to reactivate his massive
planet-destroying fortress, sealed away in the Dark Nebula long ago by Star Saber.
The series eschews the story arc-based approach of Headmasters and Masterforce,
returning to the American show's method of episodic adventures that did little to
alter the status quo of the series, with a heavy emphasis on action, complemented
by dynamic animation. Its cast consists almost entirely of brand new characters
(although there are some guest appearances from characters on earlier shows).
