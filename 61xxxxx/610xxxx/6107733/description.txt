Rare Bunuel movie (originally made in French) which tells the old story of an idealistic reformer who is gradually co-opted and perverted by the system. In this case he's the secretary to the brutal governor of a penal colony.

This is a drama unlike Bunuel's later surrealist works, but you can see his touch in the way he plays up the absurd comedy of the situation, as well as the way in which sex is used as a weapon.

It's actally closer to Graham Greene tha Bunuel, but it's a solid movie if you approach it on its own terms. Mexican star Maria Felix (of Dona Barbara) turns in a particularly fiery performance.
