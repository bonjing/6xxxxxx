Fred Bailey has won a slew of folk music awards, and Ainâ€™t Cominâ€™ Back This Year makes it easy to hear why. Bailey has the snap and sound of an old-school folksinger. His lyrics have the polite but reckless fire of Woody Guthrie, while his guitar playing echoes Pete Seeger on a playful day. Baileyâ€™s autobiographical songs make it clear that he comes by his old-school sound honestly, having been there when it was new. But he still sounds fresh; his songs work in any era, and have moved on to deal with the problems of the present as well as the problems of his youth.
