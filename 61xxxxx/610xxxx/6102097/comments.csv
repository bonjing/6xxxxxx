,ThaGoatMan,2011-01-14T14:47Z,"Mr.20-40 is it possible for u to do the original Halloween (1978), please do consider my request,Thanks you and God bless."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-14T15:38Z,"13 finished downloads - 8  hit&runs.

Obviously, this torrent would die in next day or two.

Great, another waste."

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-14T18:03Z,"@spiritualiste: On some way, we all loose.

But, do not worry, I seed 48 hours, and I need less than 100 seconds for 700 MB. Point being, it tells who are the people who come here, in growing numbers every day just to fuck even with ""cruel"" world around. They reap  what they sow, right?"
,prank0007,2011-01-14T18:45Z,"thnks bro
@20-40
yes u r rt its shameless for ppl like that"
,dark_defender,2011-01-14T19:09Z,@twentyforty: Absolutely. It will all come back and trouble them at some point. Stupid Fucks !!
,muthineni,2011-01-14T19:27Z,"@leechers
please dont crap where you eat. please
@20-40
for the first time in my life i understand what u mean coz i tried to seed my request das boot for 4-5 days. first day i was seeding to 50+ peers.second too. but the seeds were never more than 15 at any point. later it just sucked the seeds never showed up and peers came down to 10 and settled.
what im saying is  that if people seeded on the first days then the torrent would have been more popular and the people who come from the search engine later( those who just  type the movie and look for the options and get a well seeded one) would def gets urs and u know so on..

sorry for the long msg.
 so if anyone wants to seed a little extra ,next time do it even after few days "
,tylr,2011-01-14T19:35Z,"""..100 seconds for 700 MB download"" wow! are u in a dedicated Broadband line with fibreOptics?!
^^^ damn! tats jus too much speed.. it took 7.5Hrs before.. now it takes 3.45Hrs for me, couple it with parallel downloads ;D

..99mb for a Looney Toons was never a issue for u - was it?!, apart from taking the pains to 'rip it' in ur comp.. 

..still the Looney toons, Angry Birds were like a 'breather', something out of the ordinary.. from ur Rips, looking forward to some of them.. if u ever change ur mind!
..hav a goodDay"
,tylr,2011-01-14T19:43Z,"can u plZ. tell me wir can i find ip man 1, i have no idea if u had it in some package.. i want linKs for Yip Man (2008) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220719/"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-14T21:04Z,"@tylr: I still have BluRays of both IP man movies, but I cannot every few months rip same movies over and over again - I've been thinking that I made that (and myself) clear about that few days back.

Point being, I cannot do re-rippings next three-four weeks for sure.

Be patient, focus on something else or - find appropriate encodes all around. If you Google, you would find more than three-four dozens of IP 1&2 in sizes from 300 MB - 8.75 GB. I know that for sure.

And yes - I can upload with 27400 kB/s and download even faster, but I use that for sharing only, every day I seed at least 50 GB and most people would need whole month for that.

I use my resources for common good only and for that reason I hardly can accept ""facts of life"" knowing the nature of the people but trying to push them beyond complex limits around them."
,froglog,2011-01-14T21:55Z,Thank you for this one
,muk0690,2011-01-15T08:47Z,"@twentyforty: Yeah, these are facts of life. People are like that. 
btw, thanks for this.
@all:What does one loose by seeding... Nothing.....
Moreover by seeding you get maximum download speed. Google it if you dont believe me."
,azrielle,2011-01-15T09:20Z,"Finally a movie about somebody's life that is more f*cked up than my own.  I think I'll pass on this one.  Still seeding the Looney Tunes torrents, though."
