Haris Alexiou (born 27 December 1950 in Thebes, Greece as Hariklia Roupaka,) is a Greek singer. 
She is considered on of the most popular singers in Greece and has been commercially successful since the 1970s. She has worked with important Greek songwriters and composers, has performed at top musical theatres all over the world and has received several awards. She has recorded over thirty albums and has been featured on albums of other musicians. 
Despite Haris Alexiou is not used to refer to her sales' numbers, according to the Greek discography researcher Petros Dragoumanos (2009), Alexiou holds the no 1 female ranking and totally the no 3 ranking, concerning the sales of the personal albums certified Gold or Platinum in Greek discography since 1970, behind the male singers George Dalaras and Yiannis Parios. 
Eight of her personal albums released between 1977 and 2003 have surpassed 100,000 sales, the only Greek female singer to do so. The fact that most of the above mentioned albums have been of a different music style, produced with different composers and released between constant time periods demonstrates her unique and indisputable figure in contemporary Greek music.

She has lived in Athens since 1958, when she and her family moved there from Thebes. Her grandmother's family migrated in 1924 from Seydikoy, Izmir. (wikipedia.org)
