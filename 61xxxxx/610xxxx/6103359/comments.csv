Hmm, just noticed that. Try replacing the existing .exe with the one available here in the Wolf4SDL 1.7 binary?

,GabrielM,2011-09-15T20:27Z,"Oh yeah, now it's works. Thanks a lot !"
,oopsidoodles,2012-04-06T22:32Z,"ok before i had no sound when i played the game but i downloaded the .exe file and now its okay. also the controls were messed up and so was the size of the screen when i played. I changed controls and the screen size easily. One last thing to help all you guys out there. When you play there is a possibility that wherever there are numbers (health, ammo, points) there will be a black box. I will upload a dll file to fix that as i had the same problem."

Forgot to mention that once you replace the .exe, you have to delete config.wl6.

Sorry.
