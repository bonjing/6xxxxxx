320kbps Mix Set from DJ Shell Shox, Terrace, BC, Canada

Relased September 2010


This mix is dedicated to all those who are stuck in a small town where the population is more akin to listening to AC/DC  than all other types of music put together. Let those who do not experience underground music listen to this. Attempt to rehabilitate those who only listen to the radio.
