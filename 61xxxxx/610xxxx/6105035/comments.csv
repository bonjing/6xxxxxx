,mbljs5555,2011-01-15T21:36Z,i have a question... say you download this from your mac app store but you already own it on your ipod.. does that mean you have to pay $4.99 to buy it? or is it going to be free?
,cdnutter,2011-01-15T22:47Z,"to mbljs5555, you still have to pay, becasue it is a different game area, although if u download, there should be no problem"
