Here is the clock. The Trumpton clock. Telling the time... steadily, sensibly; never too quickly, never too slowly... Telling the time for Trumpton!

So take a trip to Trumpton and join Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble & Grub and the rest of the Trumpton townsfolk in Gordon Murray's timeless classic. Lovingly restored for DVD using a blend of state-of-the-art technologies, this is a piece of British animation heritage not to be missed.

Featuring all 13 episodes, digitally restored!
