[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Love And Other Drugs 720p

Right first off ....this is a rip off the source files serenity so kindly gave us ( thanks ),hence the reason we've done 
a 720p rip.....jst like we did little fookers.
Now the source,whilst really good had some faults,mainly the interlace issues.We tried several different ways but none 
removed them fully and the best way was to separate the fields and use bob +weave but that meant resizing the video and 
losing the sharpness :(
So....we decided to leave it how it was (looks better when on the tv),also the film was cammed at a bad angle and needed to 
level up the video and then when doing that it left a big black border going across the screen at a angle.However we used 
the Quad filter in vdub for to remove it,instead of cropping so we keep as much video as possible.
We also done our usual stuff of brightness,contrast,rgb eq etc....
Audio was our from our good friend and is pretty decent but we cleaned it up some more ths time round and then resynced it to this.

Enjoy folks......

Overall based on a TS v9 A8 .......don't get much better then this :P

PS.. We are working on our server problem and hope to return soon... ;)
