Audio Tracks are all demuxed, so download the ones you want.
Use MPC (  http://cccp-project.net/ ) to automatically recognize & play
the external Audio tracks or mux the Audio in MKV with  mkvmerge 
(  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix ) if you wish to use other player.

With English you got 2 choices (DTS & AAC). Read description."

,baybeh,2012-03-25T07:08Z,MPC and MKV players are such. a. fucking. pain. Why couldn't you just configurate it for VLC and save the world a lot of time and bother?
,baybeh,2012-03-25T12:03Z,"mpc player doesn't play the .m4a file, that is, the commentary while the video is playing"
,baybeh,2012-03-25T12:30Z,"sorry for commenting again and again, but I've spent an entire day trying to figure out how to play the commentary with the film (ie, along with the video) on the mpc player, and I can't figure out. It will be great if someone can help."
