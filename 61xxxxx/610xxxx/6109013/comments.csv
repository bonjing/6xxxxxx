[T],KickAssTorrents,2011-01-18T01:16Z,Hey guys I cant even offer you a sample of the movie because The Pirate Bay system wont let me but hey hoe I keep forgetting this site was online before STONEHENGE and hasnt changed
,LJE111,2011-01-18T02:16Z,"How about using Demoniod? Their DL's have samples all the time. Demoniod is always my first choice as I seem to get tracked less. But since they were shut down back in 2009 they've never quite recovered and are somewhat limited on available DL's. Example: I searched ""Red"" and ""red"" under movies and under ""all"" and received 0 returns. Really? Not a single up of Red? Pretty hard to believe, but this is just one example. "
,LJE111,2011-01-18T02:18Z,"Oops - almost forgot to thank you for the dl -- 
Thank you! Appreciate it with or without a sample - your dl's are always the best (you really do ""kick ass""!)."
,LJE111,2011-01-18T02:27Z,"Ok - I just noticed when I downloaded this that the file came from Demoniod - so you must have uploaded it there also. I have no idea why it won't come up under a simple search. Has anyone else noticed the Demoniod search engine has been seriously lacking lately? Often a search buries the movie in ""similars"" or turns up nothing at all. But I digressâŚ and I should take this comment to the Demoniod site. "
