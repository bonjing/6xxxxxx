,tanwie2006,2011-10-22T11:54Z,"wow man, it works like a charm, you rock men. thanks for the upload, i am able to have all the 60 players available. u just have to extract the game, go to the game directory where the game is being extracted, u will see a file or icon there by name mk vs sf right click on it and send the short cut to the desktop. when done go to desktop right click the shortcut that u sent and click on properties u will see target, just click at the right and and the extreme right just dont erase anything just copy and past this at the right end corner, mind i extract it in my documents so it appears like this ""C:\Documents and Settings\RENE DOLLAR\My Documents\Downloads\mk vs sf v3\mk vs sf v3\mk vs sf.exe"" -r big  the -r big was not there i just added it and then click on applied on i was able to have all the 60 players. hope it helps"
