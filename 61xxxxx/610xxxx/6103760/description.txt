2011 release, the fourth album from highly acclaimed American Indie Folk singer/songwriter Sam Beam AKA Iron & Wine. Kiss Each Other Clean is the follow-up to 2007's 'The Shepherd's Dog and his first album for the cult 4AD label following his departure from Sub Pop. Described by Beam himself as a more Pop-oriented record inspired by '70s FM radio, this looks set to bring his melancholy, literate songwriting to a whole new audience.
