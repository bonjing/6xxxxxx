This is the only seeded ""HD"" version of this I could find, so I decided to check it out.  
Very poorly encoded - why bother encoding 720P into a file that's only 1GB?  That's at barely the quality required for good standard def video. 
The audio is VERY quiet but recoverable.
Overall: watchable, but not good quality.  Finding a good standard def encoding >1GB will probably offer significantly better picture quality and have the original 5.1 soundtrack [this is stereo]."
