ALiCE's EMOTiON
[AECD-012] 2008
FLAC
Hardcore, Happy Hardcore 

A vocaloid album released by ALiCE's EMOTiON consisting of Miku Hatsune for the entirety of the "vocals". Acceptable album, a few nice tracks in there. The most successful track on it is "miku you, fxxk you", a semi-gabber style track, followed by "North Blue Sky", and "Are You Hungry?" -- An exceedingly sweet, so sweet you'll rot your teeth out, happy hardcore track. Not that that's a bad thing ;D

Enjoy.
