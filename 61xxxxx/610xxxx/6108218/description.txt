Printed in 1991, Youâ€™re Short, Bald and Ugly Charlie Brown bears the byline of Dr. Casey â€œSparkyâ€ Finnegan, who at the time was pretty widely known to be Seth, Joe Matt, and Chester Brown working under a pseudonym they got from Canadian childrenâ€™s television. This is kind of publication that makes me lament the slow decline of minicomics. Sure, you could do this on the Internet, but itâ€™d be some group blog or mass Facebook meme and the simplicity of the original intent would be lost. That intent being, in this case, â€œLetâ€™s re-dialogue a bunch of old Peanuts strips to make them horrible and wrong, eh?â€

The mini is divided into three sections, one for each of the three contributors. The strips in the first section are one-off gags where the Peanuts characters talk about periods, anal sex, abortions, cross-dressing, and whatever other taboo subjects a jaded indie cartoonist who probably wears an old-timey hat can think of. As far as shock-humor treatments of beloved family comic strips go, itâ€™s well-done but doesnâ€™t rise significantly above the standards of the genre.

The third section uses miscellaneous Peanuts strips to tell an extended story about Linus developing a gay crush on Charlie Brown. More ambitious, almost on par with Jesse Hammâ€™s redubbing of Family Circus panels with Fight Club dialogue, but still lacking a certain je ne sais quoi. Good work finding a strip of Charlie Brown sitting at Linusâ€™s bedside in the dark to illustrate the seduction scene, though.
Then thereâ€™s the central section, â€œBilliards.â€

â€œBilliardsâ€ is the reason to track this minicomic down. (Well, that and Lucy saying, â€œChrist, that John Holmes has a fuckinâ€™ big dick!â€) An actual odd storyline from Peanuts in which Linusâ€™s family gets a pool table has been assembled into a longform comic and rewritten as if badly translated from Spanish, turning it into something akin to a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel. If I could explain why this is funny, I would have the secret of comedy and would have better things to do than put pictures of comic books I own on the Internet. But I donâ€™t, so all I can say is that by the time the dialogue gets to the rolling and the blood and Child Services being called in, itâ€™s very good.
Sometimes comics are for extraordinary visions, grand statements, wise observations, beautiful pictures. And sometimes theyâ€™re for being stupid. This is a very stupid comic. I hope there are still comics that do stupid as well as this. With that, Iâ€™m off to bed until I get the last of the Comic-Con out of my bloodstream.
