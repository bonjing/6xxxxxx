very nice quality
what can i say ? moar"
,chicalleje,2011-05-26T06:10Z,"Thank you very much, Herakler. It's hard to believe the quality you manage to get with so low bitrate, but I force myself to think that my eyes are not deiciving me.

A question: How small can you make a 1080p rip mantaining the quality per pixel, I mean, maybe you can do a 2GB 1080p rip from agood souce en blow the rest of my mind. "
,22y,2011-09-11T20:02Z,Very impressive work Herakler! Thanks!
,JoshuAble,2011-11-01T18:02Z,"Great torrent NOW, November 1st, getting speeds of 1.0 MB/second, nice download speed.  While there's 24 seeds and 55 leeches now, about 1:2 ratio, people seeding have plenty of bandwidth, and I'll seed for a couple days as well, with high upload bandwidth as well.

I'm interested in the actual rip, as I own the movie and have see it a billion times.  I'm curious what a 700 MB rip that is basically ""720p""... though the rip is roughly (1280x544), close to the 1280x720 ""720p"".  Of course the ""P"" is for progressive, and at 700 MB I'd assume it's turned into an ""interlaced"" video, thus a ""720i"" label (everyone does this though so I'm not stating anything against the uploader).

I hope my large mouth is shut down when the video looks great on my older yet solid LCD 720p 36"" television I hook my laptop up to (via HDMI out) to watch the clips.  It's just the bitrate at 850kbp/s that has me wondering how it could be near ""720p"" quality.

If you achieved this, I will post one more time about your genius! "
,JoshuAble,2011-11-01T18:19Z,"OK, I stand corrected.  Are you a genius? Seriously... looks better than my favorite uploader (private site) who's always using 720p rips that are usually right at 1.4 GB - 2.0 GB in size (depends on length of film) .... twice the size of this torrent though.

You are the new master.  I am impressed by everything, not just the high resolution but the bitrate must be overrated as this flows and looks like I'm watching it on HBO (I have a digiital cable box hooked up to my 720p TV HDMI) and this rip looks as good as watching it on HBO (legit 720p feed at much higher bitrate)....

YOU ARE A GENIUS.  Must be the h264/x264 codecs, BR source in combination with your genius.  My new favorite uploader.


NOTE:  Downloaded this in about 5 minutes, 10 minutes max, even with a 1:1 ratio of seeds/leechers currently.  Will continue to seed, but don't let past comments prevent you from downloading.

Movie: 9/10:  I love this film, went under the radar with a great screenplay, great acting my Farrell and Gleeson (he should of got nominated for an Oscar), but the Oscars are crap, though they did nominate it for ""Best Original Screenplay"").  If you haven't seen it, definitely grab it.  Great film... dark, twisted, funny, sad, and beautifully shot in Bruges (no pun intended).  The cinematography is as beautiful as the musical score (love the soft, slow piano), as well as the more upbeat scenes.

Herakler, you are a genius my friend!"
