,macifierad,2011-01-16T20:01Z,Quite confused. If Im running OS 10.5 and want to upgrade to leopard. Du I just run the dmg or do I have to burn it down to a DVD.. And then WHAT?
,PirateJFK,2011-01-16T23:42Z,"First of all 
You are already running Leopard which is 10.5
If you want to upgrade to Snow Leopard 10.6 which this is, you need to burn it to a DUAL LAYER DVD. 
You can try but it will most likely need to not be mounted from the hard drive its being installed on.
Just buy a DL DVD and be done.

after it's burned (using disk utility)

Since you want to upgrade just double click the DVD from your desktop then a window will pop-up and say ""Install Mac OS X"" click it and follow the steps, it's very simple.."
,PirateJFK,2011-01-16T23:44Z,Oh and if your going to ask all programs and files will remain the same.

please read the notes before asking questions"
,PirateJFK,2011-01-22T04:34Z,"@quik 
yes this will work, that's why i uploaded this RETAIL rip instead, because the other one was ripped from recovery discs that came with that computer.

This retail disc is universal for every intel mac laptop or desktop..
This can be used to install mac os x to a brand new hdd or take an existing system say 10.5.8 and update it to 10.6.6 or what ever is the highest 10.6.X at the time.

again please read the notes"

the first torrent is just retarded, and should only be 5.69GB 

the second one is my first SL upload, but was ripped from the apple restore disc that it came with...not a retail disc (which means it only works on a few computers)

this is a retail copy, and will work on any apple product with an intel chip"
,PirateJFK,2011-02-05T21:11Z,"@elimacguy1208

you can't mount it on your current os and restart and expect it to boot from it..

you need to burn it to a disc..

when you burn it to a disc and click on it
you are simply telling mac to restart and boot from the disc.

(it's really just restarting and telling ""startup disk"" to boot from the optical drive @ next boot.)"

Yes this will work for your macbook 
try burning at a slower rate like 4x vs 8x or whatever ur burning at now.
and make sure your using a mac to burn the dmg
dont try and convert it to iso and burn with a pc.

or you could use a mac to restore the image to an 8gb flash drive and boot from it with ""option"" key.
"
,PirateJFK,2011-02-17T09:57Z,"more @ 0r30

and make sure you go to disk utility when booted from the disc and format the drive there, and then proceed to install. "
,PirateJFK,2011-02-17T10:00Z,"@ jerico2508

yes the boot camp drivers are on the disc.
and if you want a clean install run disk utility under ""utlities"" menu and format before install. "

,PirateJFK,2011-02-17T10:08Z,"@ jConstantine

try reburning at a slower rate like 4x
and make sure that right after you push the power button you are holding ""c"" down. it will take a while maybe even two minutes or longer. it doesnt seem like it's loading but it is. 
or you could go to system preferences>startup disk and select the disk and then restart and it will automatically boot from it. 

if all else fails your dvd drive could be going and you could pick up an 8gb flash drive and use disk utility to restore the image to it and then boot from it using ""option"" key. like i said don't expect it to start booting from it in 20 secs. it'll be a while just wait!
Good Luck"

,Zeptinune,2011-02-25T12:09Z,"I'm about to try this on my Acer Travelmate 5740. We'll see how it goes. After I update my mobo though from the Integrated Intel Chip I'll have to do it again probably. But I need to work a dual Win7 + Mac OS X installation out anyway. So this will be good practice for me.

As for the fuckwit who is telling everyone that they cant install this onto a PC he can go fuck himself. Hackintosh.com and Lifehacker and Tonymac86x all require you to use a LEGITIMATE Leopard Install DVD (Which this is) to make your Hackintosh. Only a wanker would use an iATKOS install... The best Hackintosh Distro is NO Distro.. use the legit CD and get all the benefits, then just work yourself out with Kexts.

Go to Hackintosh.com to start and then follow the guide on the top front page by Tonymac. Install OS X first and then Windows 7. You'll have to start from a blank drive though so don't be a pussy. Back your shit up and then try this.

If you can't work it out even after that then you don't deserve to run Mac OS. This isn't a game noobs, be happy with your nooby little PC's. Leave this to the big boys."
