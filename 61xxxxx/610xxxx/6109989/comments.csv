,JollyBlue,2011-02-22T02:51Z,Can I use this to clean install on my PC that is using Windows 7 Basic 64-bit?  I wanna use 32-bit cause some games of mine won't work on 64-bit.  Also I have 6gb of RAM.  Does this mean that 2gb of my RAM will be sitting idle never used?  Lemme know!
,Fateofman,2011-04-01T21:37Z,"The instructions say to ""Click ""Advanced Options"" and install the BIOS mod,"" is that something I have to download myself or is it included? Is there something I'm just not seeing?"
,SanctusSecurity,2011-04-05T23:48Z,JollyBlue - A 32 Bit version of Windows only supports up to 4GB of system memory (RAM)
