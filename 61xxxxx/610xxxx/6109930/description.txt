Here is a complete upload of the current Geohot.com website, just in case Sony succeeds in their pitiful excuse for a gagging order. Includes the PS3 Master Key and Jailbreak.zip

I would not trust the pirate bay with my life, and therefore would not trust this torrent even with myself (at least for the jailbreak.zip). It is literally a rip of the geohot.com website for archival and backup purposes, and I highly recommend downloading the original files from that website if they are still available. I'm not responsible if this fucks up your ps3 in any way.

Ripped using SiteSucker. Special thanks forever to geohotz and every single other God who finally got homebrew working on my ps3.
