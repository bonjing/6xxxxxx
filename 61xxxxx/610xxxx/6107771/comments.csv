,albatronix,2011-01-25T21:12Z,"Well, I just downloaded all 7.42 gigs (why is it so much?) and when I try to burn it in imgburn it says
""There doesn't seem to be enough space on the disc to burn this image.

 Image size: 7,599 MB
Disc size: 4,488 MB

Would you like to continue anyway?"" (yes/no)


Is this supposed to burn onto blu-ray or something? I'm gonna burn it anyway on my verbatim dvd-r and see if it works.. i'll keep you posted"
,albatronix,2011-01-25T21:15Z,"Okay it didn't work.. I got a bunch of errors and it said ""Failed to Reserve Track! -Reason: Logical block address out of range"" Operation Failed

.. I wouldn't download this if I were you, unless you might want to try it on blu-ray discs if you have them.."

,wolffd,2011-01-27T02:56Z,"And no, it is not blu-ray."
,wolffd,2011-01-27T19:41Z,"Try using CloneDVD2, burn to 8+GB disc."
