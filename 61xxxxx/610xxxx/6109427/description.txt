Complete collection (as of 17.1.11) of videos and text files from freedrumlessons.com

Drum lessons are one of the best out there and you really learn a lot from them, especially as beginner. Collection also contains \"secret\" lessons that are available only through their newsletter (or on youtube). I didn\'t add play-alongs, drum solos and other not very useful material (for beginners) that can otherwise be found on their web page.

Lessons are free anyway, but here is a complete collection for offline usage or perhaps even backuping on DVDs. Videos and text files were copied directly from their web page and are in .avi (h.264 and at least 480x368 resolution) and .pdf format.

Happy drumming and \'break a stick\'... :)
