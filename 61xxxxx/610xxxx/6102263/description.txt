
Modern Talking - The Greatest Hits - Three Double Disc - CD Quality  


Listen to this tracks and become the greatest dancer you've ever seen, swinging the lambada like the great Dieter Bohlen, you really should watch him dancing, not bad at all this guy. Dieter is a guitar man and most of all a real womanizer, this guy had truck loads of the sweetest girls and he changed them like his underwear, boosting himself up daily with bottles of Jack Daniels ruined his carier in the end, but the pop music icoon he is will live through. A little search at the pirate bay shows, there are already a few more downloads available, but announced in my earlier upload here once again all his remastered songs brought on a three double CD, including the magnificent track You're a woman, i'm a man, Dieter's first song, uploaded in PCM CD quality and Covers with track names included..
