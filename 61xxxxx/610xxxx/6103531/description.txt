I love heavily-themed releases, and all the songs on this CD work together perfectly. One of the reasons I love EPs is because, with their short length, they tend to be much more consistent than full albums, and Okkervil River certainly doesn't disappoint there. This isn't B-side material, it could easily contend with some of the tracks on their full releases, it's just a short collection of thematically-related, well-written songs.
