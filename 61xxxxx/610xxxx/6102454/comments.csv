,Deadly_NZ,2011-01-14T23:54Z,"Is this the one thats just been released to OEM/  Also there seems to be a windows update needed to make it run.

,tiboka,2011-01-15T10:08Z,"Thanks for this great torrent!

ps.: DAZ loader 1.95 is working great with SP1"
[V],Anacondaz,2011-01-15T11:30Z,"the sp1 installed fine
but while installing the following happened

any comments on this mate"
,xatzis012,2011-01-15T16:01Z,"@arulkarthik
dude the package is clean.
it is a false positive by your antivirus/security suite.
i installed just 3 hours ago  and it is clean and smooth running till now.

p.s.
i scanned it using ESET Smart Security 4.2.67"
,traxstar7,2011-01-15T19:42Z,"So this is just the SP1, not the whole OS, am I right ??

This is used after formating a new Win7 and then installing this SP1, instead of using the windows-update function ???

Thanks "
,Plan9x128,2011-02-19T13:30Z,Thanks for the torrent..
,taus0901,2011-03-15T20:07Z,"with the new servicepack Your crack will not work anymore!!
You are given 30 days to activate!!

any suggestions?"
,gomatto,2011-03-25T07:28Z,"@taus0901 The crack I used stops windows update from installing any activation updates. When u use this package, it is installing activation updates. Update to SP1 using windows update."
,gomatto,2011-03-25T07:30Z,btw torrentshredder u don't deserve Trusted rating with your shitty attitude. 
,visen232,2011-03-28T09:03Z,"hey torrent shedder what is this sp1 RTM or the final one ,RTM not beta and dont answer my question with your fierce attidude on answering arulkhaltik question"
