final servicepack 1, for windows seven and windows 2008 r2, x86 32-bit, x86, standard 32bit edition (.exe installer).

you need a running operating system to apply this while running it, so similar like normal .exe installer download or via windowsupdate.


prepare your win7 / server box to the latest windowsupdates before applying this servicepack1, also uninstall/clean your previous beta/releasecandidates/alpha of previous servicepack1 installs.



read compatibility, releasenotes and whatnot and dont complain if you fuckup again.


if in doubt, adopt a penguin instead.
