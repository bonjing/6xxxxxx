A decent album from Diverse System, primarily house-based. As usual, unique track patterns and unusual synths. The highlight track is "Symleah (Original Mix)", which is a rival for my favorite song next to "Evergreen" of kors k Ways for Liberation. The whole album is pretty unusual, and is hit and miss for some - see if it fits into your tastes.

01. Symleah (Original Mix) - RIGHT STUFF

Enjoy.

Diverse System is an amazing independent studio, they actually are a company worth supporting. Buy their CDs so they can make more cutting-edge music.
