,john rallus,2011-01-16T20:23Z,"@ ""If you need translation subs visit some subtitles sites""
why not rip the english subs and the video off the dvd all together???"
,DrunkPollock,2011-01-16T20:26Z,"Audio sounds like cam and the vid quality isn't that great. 

If you've waited this long, I'd wait a couple more days for a better version."
,janusgate,2011-01-17T08:41Z,"There is another movie called ""Let the right one in"" it's got english subs and is swedish I think, I thought it was VERY good...Totally different actors and feel..."

,iSeshan,2011-01-18T07:23Z,"Audio sounds like a Cam (it has a echo and is not clear), also there are hard coded Koren subs, I wish I read that before, not like it matters since the Audio is crap I won't be watching this copy."
,pirate_bit,2011-01-18T18:54Z,"Fuck !!! is HARD CODED.
Doubt that is a DVDRip."
,b.koz,2011-01-19T12:39Z,"This is the remake of ""Morse, Let the right one in"" a Danish movie, as usual America copies a masterpiece and then takes credit for it, I don't say don't watch it, but make sure you watch the original too."
,slask1024,2011-01-20T20:15Z,"b.koz! 
The original is not a danish film it's actually a swedish film from the beginning, and the original is better than the remake. The dvd also have english subs., i think it's called l""let the right one in"" It's on the bay!"
,danness,2011-01-21T20:19Z,"@ b.koz
