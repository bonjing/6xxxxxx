,martronn,2011-01-14T09:42Z,Is it any crack in this?? or is it just install and fly??
,martronn,2011-01-14T11:53Z,this dont work! serial blacklisted! somone get a crack for this bird!!!!
,grotter50,2011-01-14T12:07Z,"Just Install and Fly, it's official! ;)"
,grotter50,2011-01-14T12:09Z,You don't need any Serial man! It's a standard installer. Don't tell bad things without know-it please!
,martronn,2011-01-14T12:13Z,when i start FS is ask for activation of QW 757 and edher way what i do it just crashes fs sreit away when i chose the plane. 
,grotter50,2011-01-14T12:35Z,"Very Strange.. I never saw this message or activation, if you need something about my personal files, ask-it for!

Anybody have the Same problem??

Try install without internet connection!"
,belltaco,2011-01-14T13:07Z,"there is no need some serial or activation....because it's a custom cracked installer, not the original one from QW shop"
,koskota,2011-01-14T13:10Z,Hello grotter50. Very nice job. What the rest are saying about serial numbers refers to when one tries to install the updates for qw757 (two service packs actualy). If you can supply one then you will make many people happy.
,koskota,2011-01-14T13:12Z,Great job grotter50. The serial number is required only when trying to install service packs (two actually). If you can supply one then you will make many people even happier!
,grotter50,2011-01-14T19:39Z,"I will upload the crack later, or just upload the service pack riped files. Many thanks koskota for all! :)"
,gotbutchi,2011-01-15T12:38Z,"Very nice grotter ;) I bet lots of people are waiting for this. As I was thinking about uploading my version of QW757,mine already has SP2 included but my internet is very poor. So thanks a lot !
/For those people who can't install this,then google ""how to install exe file"" =)

I'm currently looking for AirSimmer A320 and Real Germany 3. You have any?"
,grotter50,2011-01-15T19:19Z,"Yeah! I've the Airsimmer (purchased obiously) and the Real Germany i'm thinking to install-it!

How you you integrate the SP2 in the exe file? It's the one last from the website?

Best For you! 
PD: The response about exe file it's sooooo cool! hahahahahah, ;) Thanks man."
,koskota,2011-01-16T00:22Z,"Hello Grotter50.
Since you did a nice job with qw757 (still waiting though for your updated/updateable version) do you think you can crack/upload Airsimmer too?
It is the only unbreakable one till today!"
,gotbutchi,2011-01-16T00:59Z,"Hmm. Your file is just as same as the one on my computer. In this case then this should ALREADY INCLUDED SP2,all you guys need is to install the SP2 hotfix ( I haven't tried it yet)

/Any chance upload Real Germany 3? It's the last add-on for Germany that still not available on any torrent website."
,betty118,2011-01-16T14:37Z,"Forgive my stupidity, but I am having a little trouble with this one. The installation is straightforward and the selection of aircraft appear in my aircraft selection menu, but I cannot seem to select any of the 757s. When I click OK for that aircraft, nothing happens. When I click a second time, FS2004 freezes.

A FS2004 error box apparently opens (when I do Ctrl, Alt and Del, it shows there) but I can't get to see what exactly it says.

I'm new to all of this, so it's most likely my mistake, but any help would be appreciated!"
,zabolekarq,2011-01-16T16:43Z,"Hi, now I am downloading it. Will check it out if its working. Thanks to the grotter50, I hope this will work, if not....."
,gotbutchi,2011-01-16T17:01Z,"@betty: do you install any scenery from FSdreamteam? I have heard some people have their sceneries from FSdreamteam and qualitywings sometimes mess up each other. 

If yes,try to reinstall all of those ;)"
,mad_flyer,2011-01-17T06:42Z,"Thanks for this.

I haven't seen it around here, so I'll request:

Turbine Sound Studios A380 GP7000 sound set."
,grotter50,2011-01-17T08:46Z,"@gotbutchi +1

@gotbuchi Airsimmer it's easy to crack, just uploading the license file, and all serials and activation codes you'll have the AS in your FS installed done, but the problem it's the number of activations in the key, and the online control by Airsimmer. If you really want-it, buy-it. I never buy addons excepting thoose onces wich I really know are nice and I want.

@betty118
This error may be caused by FSDreamteam cracking fail or bad errors in FS and Computer Registry, My Personal Recommendation: Reinstall and Everything it's gonna work fine, I Swear!

@zabolekarq Try-it and tell us something! :)

@mad_flyer Hope you enjoy-it, I'll search it in my HDD and I'll upload, I know that I've but I don't know where! :P Best Regards."
,zabolekarq,2011-01-17T09:01Z,"Hey again, as I promised, I will post if this is working torrent. Well it IS! Many thanks to grotter50 for sharing his working product. I appreciate that very much, becouse HE PAYED for this!!!"
[T],stevekasian,2011-01-17T12:03Z,"Livery Manager errors out with a failure to initialize properly error. God only knwos what surprises await me when trying to start FS.

Plz fix this thing or don't bother uploading it here.

grotter50 didn't fucking PAY for this damn thing. He got it off usenet, either directly or indirectly. Nobody on TPB actually goes out and buys overpriced software just so they can share it on TPB. Get fucking real. lol

People will believe anything. Hell, just look at who the prez of the US is... I rest my case. hehe"

,airamerica,2011-01-17T21:27Z,"Thanks grotter50,. works like a charm, although there are some bugs on the gauges,. not as detailed as captain sim.. but the external model is wow! "
,gotbutchi,2011-01-18T04:13Z,"@grotter: thanks for the info :D
@steve: mine working fine,add and uninstall livery like charms

and btw,I don't really care if he really bought it or downloaded it from somewhere else,all I know is that he is uploading it to share to TPB's users"
,airamerica,2011-01-18T17:37Z,"@betty118, check if you have gaugesound.dll & FSsound.dll installed."
[T],stevekasian,2011-01-19T15:06Z,"@gotbutchi: Tnx - MY BAD: It turns out I was missing an element of Windows that was required for the livery app to function,  causing it to error out.

Seems to run ok so far. Thanx grotter50, apologies 4 the not-working comment."
,airamerica,2011-01-19T16:51Z,"Guys, I tried installing the SP2 hotfix, it gave me a CTD, I wonder where the VC/WV combination model is? since this seems to be Version 2? any Ideas guys?"
,truenorther,2011-01-19T19:05Z,"Seems this is already SP2. The PDF doc installed say includes SP2. For those with livery manager error, you need vcredist_x86 or 64 from Microsoft installed on your system for it to work. 

Thx for the upload it's a lot less of a PC melter than the CS one even if it's less detailed."
,djsiryn,2011-01-19T22:40Z,"Anyone else have the problem I'm having? When I select the aircraft in the main menu an error pops up and says the program will not start with active debuggers running, Deactivate or uninstall debuggers and try again. WTF?"

Thanks!"
,gotbutchi,2011-01-21T14:37Z,"Some of you having trouble installing SP2 hotfix,run this installer again and forget about it for a while.

QW757 for FSX...yes I have it but not an installer,it's a RIP and I have no clue if it will work for FSX or not cause I don't have FSX installed on my computer. Will try to upload it on TPB in the future."
,Hacker907,2011-01-21T20:07Z,"I would really appreciate if you upload it, i downloaded RIP from somewhere but it doesn't work, it crashes."
,gotbutchi,2011-01-22T16:55Z,"Perhaps it is the one that I downloaded. Can you tell me more about that package that you downloaded? What are inside..

Getting error when I try to select this jet in FS9.  All goes well when I go into the aircraft selector, go to QW and the aircraft displays and spins as normal but when I click 'ok' I get the message
""For security purposes, this program will not run while system debuggers are active. Please remove or disable the system debugger before trying to run this program again.""
Then when I click ok on that message, I get another one saying
""flight simulator was unable to load some aircraft or software.  you can continue using flight simulator but this aircraft or software will be disabled.  file: guages\qw757.gau.""
