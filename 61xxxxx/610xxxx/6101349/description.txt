Hi all!

I was looking for the 757 of Quality Wings (NO BETA VERSION) Here in Pirate Bay, but I can\'t find-it, fully, working and without any crap inside, so I decided upload-it by me, this is the original version, Bought with only one .exe file autoinstaller (the official one).

If you are looking for the repaints and libraries, just go to this link of the official website and you\'ll get all repaints available yet until 14/01/2011 (sure)

Download Livery Manager Tool and follow the instructions of the application, it\'s very simple and intuitive.


Remember, I paid for you, someday, pay you for me with other uploaded addon! ;)
