Well, was getting tired of waiting for SD release!

Only a rough encode using an encoder I'm not that familiar with - but it does the job fast.

Guessing the source file is 23.976fps, I entered that in for output format, yet it encoded to 25fps?!

Still looks no different to me, actually quite impressed by result from 17min encode on mediocre Laptop.

Size = 332,438,214 bytes
Res = 624 x 352
Bitrate = ~900kbps
Codec = XviD ISO MPEG-4
Fps = 25 (Blame encoder, won't listen when specify 23.976!)
Audio = 128kb/s MPEG-1 Layer3, Joint Stereo.

Enjoy
