,ReVaQ,2012-05-01T18:59Z,"Probably the most important documentary you might witness.

The documentary goes through 4 main categories with its own subcategories. The video explain alot about our society, culture, religion, science and more. It shows great arguments agains a Monetary System, which is the documentary all about, trying to convince everyone to realize that the Monetary System is corrupt and non-good. 
It has really great arguments, and explains well and detailed. 

I hope you spend 13h of your 70.000h of your life, and realize that the system we currently are in right now, IS UTTER BULLOCKS.

+1

P.s. Plus, ITS FREAKING FREE! AWESOME!"
