Happiness turns to horror during Longford's surprise retirement party when the squad learns that one of their own - assistant prosecutor Alice Williams - has been shot dead in a courthouse parking garage. For the victim's close friend, Lieutenant Mason, and the other stunned and enraged detectives, this crime is very personal as they cast a wide net to investigate anyone who could have had a motive. Suspects range from a criminal Williams had once put away to a former boyfriend who may have been stalking her. Closely guarded secrets start to emerge, including Williams' pact with a well-known reporter to build a case against a prominent figure with whom Fitch has tangled in the past. As the plot thickens, the body count rises.
