,head_banger,2011-01-16T15:45Z,I'll add tags and a description as soon as I can (torrent editing is temporarily disabled)!
,vandergraaf1000,2011-01-16T16:42Z,Have downloaded some of this and the tracks dont play! am using vlc and they dont want to play! Any ideas?
,head_banger,2011-01-16T17:11Z,"vandergraaf1000:
I opened the entire folder in the latest version of VLC (1.1.5) and I have no problem playing any of the files with it (nor with any music player - and that includes my portable music player).

I have no clue what the problem can be!
Are sure that your downloaded files are 100% complete?
- Just done seeding a few minutes ago.

- Which tracks have you downloaded concretely?

Please, anybody, comment if you have any problem whit this upload (would be sorry, if it didn't work properly)!"
,vandergraaf1000,2011-01-16T18:22Z,Ive downloaded the whole thing now and the only player they work in is real player! Dont know if I can burn to disk yet! 
,head_banger,2011-01-16T19:13Z,"vandergraaf1000:
I really have no idea, what can the problem you are experriencing be!
- If this helps, I'll describe exactly how I've created these files:
1. Ripped my CD collection using Exact Audio Copy into FLAC Image+CUE files (lossless format)
2. I used Cuetools (http://www.cuetools.net/) to convert the FLAC Image+CUE files into individual MP3s.

- I could send you CUE files so that you could try and convert the MP3s into whatever format you like in Cuetools.

- I'll send you a test Cuesheet (if you want to), just write."
,vandergraaf1000,2011-01-16T21:12Z,Thanks Ive got them playing in media player so will burn them to disc using that.  Its really strange Ive updated vlc and they still wont play in it! :) No worrys great upload loads of stuff id forgotten about! Thanks!

Have been waiting long enough for TPB to enable torrent editing so I'll supply the description here!"

- I made room for the 2 CD edition of Dehumanizer coming out next month if you want to follow my naming conventions and put it in the same folder with this download, in case you get it.
- This way you will be able to seed this torrent, if you choose, while still keeping the file organization intact.


* Please, only download this if you really love Ronnie's work!!!
- Also note that you should buy at least some of these albums!!!
- Ronnie is irreplaceable, both as a musician and person, so I think, that that's the least you can do to honour his memory!!!
* Blessed be the name of Ronnie James Dio!!!
- You're the man!!!
- R.I.P. Ronnie: You rock!!!"
,head_banger,2011-03-07T08:36Z,"I have written the text of the previous comment in january - that was to be the original description of this torrent at the time of upload, so the Dehumanizer part was already out of date then.
Here is the link to the deluxe edition of it (released on the 6th of february):

Enjoy!"
