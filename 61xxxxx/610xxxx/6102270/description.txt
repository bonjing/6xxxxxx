From Head Heritage:

Cope's brand new album celebrates his forthcoming three-day festival of the same name with eight new songs, including three live favourites "The-Way-Luv-Is", "Zennor Quoit" and his eight-minute long Armenian epic "Shrine of the Black Youth (Tukh Manukh)". Featuring Donald Ross Skinner, Doggen and Holy McGrail, this celebration of Copeâ€™s songwriting is the first in years.
