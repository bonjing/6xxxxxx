i get a blank screen. Can someone help please."
,Overflow__,2011-01-21T23:23Z,Does not work. I get the exact same problem as the guy above
,Kibaruk,2011-01-22T16:42Z,"Worked without a flaw, just installed then mounted the server I had from previous version and it just worked.

For those who say ""how can you not pay for minecraft since this dude is an independant and not a big corporation"" and shit like that, for much that I admire Notch, this game lacks optimization and for as good as the gameplay is, for the amount of money he has earned the servers are pretty crappy even for a beta game."
,re0n,2011-01-25T23:38Z,"This is the best version I could find via torrents. Works flawlessly, the bundled HD texture pack is great, has a name changer, and has the server files. If you're getting a crash you need to delete any previous version of minecraft and you have to delete the ""*username*/appdata/roaming/.minecraft"" files but keep the player/save files (not going to explain this further if you can't do that then go buy it). Keep in mind the ""appdata"" folder is hidden by default. Also the server does LAN+Online mode fine. I hosted a server with 3 LAN PC's connected and one guy online at the same time. Including me that was 5 people total. So far all the bugs are caused by the game since it's still BETA. Looking forward to more DJiNN releases when the time comes. "
,armofgod,2011-01-30T02:39Z,Worked fine thx but if anyone has any problems just redownload it if that doesn't work then i'm not sure what could be done to fix it

,mrhackett,2011-01-31T09:20Z,it works but is extremely slow. any ideas on how to speed it up?
,kahoman,2011-02-03T20:24Z,"how do you get this version updated to beta 1.2_02 without losing the graphics of this version ?

and btw, this torrent works perfect, and it's super easy to install, everyone should get this one :-) "
,xProphecy,2011-02-09T21:45Z,"I'm having a bit of trouble getting people on my server. If I want people to connect wireless LAN, do I still need to forward ports and fix firewall settings? I just forward and allow TCP 25565 right? Here's my server.properties file:
#Minecraft server properties
#TeaM DJiNN
level-name=Exile
hellworld=false
spawn-monsters=true
online-mode=false
verify-names=false
spawn-animals=true
max-players=20
server-ip=
pvp=false
server-port=25565
motd=Welcome to Exile
grow-trees=true

If I want it to be on LAN only, I need to have it set on ""online-mode=false"" right?"

Installed minecraft on several pcs, and noticed that on vista, fpt falls drastically. No problem on 7 and XP though"
,sean1135,2011-02-13T01:23Z,"Um you guys are stupid it does work. If you are having problems than maybe it is your PC not the software. I have proof on my YouTube channel.
