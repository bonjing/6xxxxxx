,theeccentrik,2012-03-26T07:49Z,"For those wanting a copy between dvd + bluray this is ok but it's never 720p in a million years! Runs at 34kbps on my sony BD player ( a john carter cam runs at 144kbps) which is woeful and the audio does not belong to this video file and is muffled/tinny.
Now i know why it's under 750mb!"
