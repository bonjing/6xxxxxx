STORY
Travel writer Lemuel Gulliver takes an assignment in Bermuda, but ends up on the island of Liliput, where he towers over its tiny citizens.

Sources: 
Russian video:
Puteshestvija.Gullivera.2010.D.TS.ELEKTRI4KA
Rx synced Audiotrack:
thx for syncing and thx to imagine for supplying the audio

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 1600 2pass
Audio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo

Hive & CM8 NOTES
added bit brightness, contrast, sharpness, chroma, rgb colours and denoise. all creds go to rx for syncing the audio, i just tried to make the russian video better. Video is similar to the witch movie, despite the fact that the video is missing some lines above so that the heads are cutted off a bit its a watchable version. has some autofocus problems and not that sharp as the witch. but its better than all previous cams. cleaned up audio too

credit Hive & CM8 & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
