Tegan and Sara each rise to complement the other's vocal strengths. One plays the clenched-jaw bad cop, taking few breaths between her breakneck assault; the other is the softer, cooing good cop. Their songs work off the yin yang seesaw that the Indigo Girls have down pat, but they update the music for a younger demographic by adding Techno beats to the non-traditional genre of Urban Folk.
