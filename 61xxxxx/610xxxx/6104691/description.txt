           Anthony's family runs a small Italian restaurant in            
           London. When his childhood friend, Dario, dies in a            
           suspicious accident, Anthony inherits a vineyard in            
           Sant'Angelo, the village his parents came from in Italy.       
           Surprised by the large sum of money offered to him by a        
           curious Italian "Master of Wine" for the land he just          
           inherited, and considering the mysterious circumstances        
           surrounding Dario's death, Anthony decides to drive down       
           to Sant'Angelo. Anthony soon feels he's in the middle of       
           something he doesn't understand and wants to leave,            
           but... He gets tangled up in "Love's" web and suddenly         
           finds himself the target of a crazy manhunt. But then,         
           "Who says miracles don't happen?".
