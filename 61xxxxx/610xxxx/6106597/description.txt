About Subliminal Messages
"Subliminal" means below the threshold of conscious perception. The
messages are embedded in the waves, just below your hearing level.
Because you're not aware of the subliminal programming underlying the
waves â€“ the repetition of positive suggestions -- you can't put up barriers
against it. Over time, your subconscious accepts the suggestions as true, and
your behavior changes accordingly.
==========================================
Track 1 Listen to track one anytime throughout the day as often as you wish.
Itâ€™s perfect to listen to while driving, walking, or even while at the office.
This track contains the relaxing sounds of ocean waves, and hidden
subliminal messages (listed below).
==========================================
Track 2 Listen to track two with headphones for 30 minutes a day, while in a
calm quiet place where you will not be disturbed. It contains the same
subliminal messages, with theta waves. Theta waves will slow down your
brain activity into a peaceful and receptive state, similar to the twilight state
normally experience between waking and sleep. In this hyper suggestible
state, your subconscious is very receptive to subliminal affirmations. Listen
to this track while falling asleep or any time during the day as a meditation -
self-hypnosis session.
==========================================
Try these tips in conjunction with this subliminal program.
â€¢ Pick a few of the affirmations listed below and repeat them aloud or
silently to yourself throughout the day.
â€¢ Donâ€™t look at the totality of the task that needs to be done; instead,
break it down into manageable steps and take them one by one until
youâ€™re done.
â€¢ If you feel like taking a break- try to do at least one more step of work
than you think you can.
