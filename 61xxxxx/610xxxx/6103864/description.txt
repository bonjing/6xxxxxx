ViGlance also enables the preview glide which pops up when the mouse pointer is hovered over a running application icon or a group icon but unfortunately doesnâ€™t show the thumbnail preview.

   1. Take control of your taskbar with process grouping
   2. ViGlance groups windows relative to their process.
   3. Enjoy true 48Ã—48 Vista/7 icons from your taskbar
   4. Replace that ugly start button with a 7 Orb replica
   5. â€œGlide effortlessly between tasksâ€ â€“ 7 Style transition effects
   6. ViGlance implements a transition effect system I call â€œGlideâ€. This is based somewhat on the Aero peak feature from Windows 7. Each group is dynamically resized via the glide animation to fit the size of the available information to be presented, allowing you to â€œGlideâ€ between each group on the Super Bar.
