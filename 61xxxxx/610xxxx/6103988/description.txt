The NME was how you used to get to know about new music - that and John Peel on a Sunday night. Every year, they'd issue a tape/CD (for about Â£3 + p&p +tokens) of some of the best singles they'd reviewed on a weekly basis.

It's interesting to note that of the singles of the week CDs I've got tracklistings for, none of the tracks made it to the NME Single of the Year award ...

Guys

If you're downloading this, it's because you're of a certain age and you're an obscure twat (like me) when it comes to musical preferences, you'll appreciate how hard it can be to find the good stuff. This is the good stuff.

Please seed at least as much as you leach! I've got a crappy connection, so I'll seed for 10x, then I'm doing the next one!


Next - Ruby Trax - 40 No1s covered by NME-friendly bands. Jesus & Mary Chain covering Little Red Rooster, anyone?
