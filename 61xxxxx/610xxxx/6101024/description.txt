From Wiki:


SinÃ©ad Marie Bernadette O'Connor born 8 December 1966) is an Irish singer-songwriter. She rose to fame in the late 1980s with her debut album The Lion and the Cobra and achieved worldwide success in 1990 with a cover of the song "Nothing Compares 2 U".

Since then, she has regularly courted controversy with her outspokenness, shorn head, and views on religion, women's rights, war and her own sexuality, while still maintaining a singing career.

Her body of work includes a number of collaborations with other artists and appearances at charity fundraising concerts, in addition to her own solo albums.









I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got 1990 (reissued 2009)


I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got is the second album by SinÃ©ad O'Connor. It was released in 1990 on Chrysalis Records.

The critically-acclaimed album contains her most famous single, "Nothing Compares 2 U", and was one of the best selling records in the world in 1990, topping the charts in many countries, including the US, UK, and Canada. The single "Emperor's New Clothes" found more moderate success, although it did top the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the US.

The album includes O'Connor's rendition of "I Am Stretched on Your Grave", an anonymous 17th century poem, originally written in Irish and translated into English by Philip King. The first song, "Feels So Different", starts with The Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr.

The inner sleeve notes acknowledge Kabbalah teacher, Warren Kenton: "Special thanks to Selina Marshall + Warren Kenton for showing me that all I'd need was inside me."

The album was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 1991, winning the award for Best Alternative Music Performance. O'Connor refused to accept the nominations and the award.[7]

In 2003, the album was ranked number 406 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[8]

The album sold 7 million copies worldwide.

In 2009, Sinead announced the release of a deluxe anniversary edition of the album, with an extra CD of unreleased tracks, B-sides and hard-to-find mixes.
