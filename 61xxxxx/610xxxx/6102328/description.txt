Plot -
Based on a true story, this film shares with us a decade in the lives of Jimmie Lewallen and his wife Carrie as they experience the joys of love and marriage alongside the tragedies of war and poverty (1939-1949). Jimmie and his friends, Bill Blair and Fred Harb, find escape from life's challenges in racing born out of hauling moonshine on warm North Carolina evenings and inadvertently become racing's earliest heroes. Ultimately, their antics laid the groundwork for what has become one of the most lucrative sports in the world. A number of racing firsts occur during The Fightin' Forties, making this film a sensational history lesson as well as an exciting journey of romance, friendship and action.
