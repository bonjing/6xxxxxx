Celebrated songwriter and musician Edie Brickell will release a self-titled album this January on her own independent label, racecarLOTTA Records. The first of two albums to be released in 2011, Edie Brickell, is out January 11th, with The Gaddabouts following on January 25th.
Produced by Charlie Sexton, Brickell began writing her self-titled solo album during her 2003 tour in support of Volcano. The solo record was then put hold to focus on The Gaddabouts, a new project featuring Steve Gadd, Pino Palladino and Andy Fairweather-Low. The group's forthcoming debut is composed of material written by Brickell over the past decade, as well as songs written with the band in the studio the very day of recording.
