Bio:
Blodhemn is a one-man band, formed by Invisus back in 2004. Blodhemnâ€™s old school Norwegian Black Metal is founded on a set of gloomy, misanthropic lyrics and weighty, yet melodic riffs. After a few demos, and with a few extra years of experience, Invisus has gathered a team of skilled live members in Bergen, the â€œBlack Metal capitalâ€ of Norway. Finally, the time has come for Blodhemn to crawl out from the shadows. The first few gigs are already behind them, and the album Brenn Alle Bruer was released july 2010.
