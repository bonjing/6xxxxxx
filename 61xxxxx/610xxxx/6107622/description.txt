    Suh Jung (best remembered for her tragic role in Kim Ki Duk's controversial The Isle) offers another remarkable performance Green Chair. In Park Chul Su's (who won acclaim through his Best Artistic Contribution Farewell My Darling at the 1996 Montreal Film Festival) latest ambitious work she plays 30 plus year old Mun Hee that starts a daring relationship with the teenager called Hyun (Shim Ji Ho). While Mun gets caught and sentenced to a slight penalty of several days of community work for indecent behavior, Hyun waits in anticipation for her release. After their reunification the two fall in and out of love as Mun starts to become conscience-stricken about being together with a guy half her age. However, Hyun desperately clings to Mun causing their feelings to ignite once moreâ€¦

    Park's unique work of art was selected both as Korean competitor at 2005's Sundance Film Festival (which supports and honors non-Hollywood movie projects) as well as at the 55th Berlin International Film Festival where it was also selected as one of the festival's Panorama section highlights. With Green Chair the auteur director that was also responsible for the script of his latest full-length feature movie skillfully proves that Korea is one of the most active places for engaging art-house presentations on today's international film market.
