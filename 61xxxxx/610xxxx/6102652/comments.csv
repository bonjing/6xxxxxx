,sctehking,2011-01-14T20:46Z,AMAZING quality! We just need seeders ASAP! 
,Random-User,2011-01-14T23:31Z,"Very small file size, even for 720p.

The 1080p is better option at 17GB, at least you then get the movie how it was ment to be."
,Curtido,2011-02-16T04:47Z,"The quality is excellent for such a small sized file.

A/V = 9/8"
,Kobie714,2011-04-24T03:42Z,"Just to let everyone know, despite being good quality, this is not 720p. It's actually 1280x528, in other words 528p, and not even HD. Go for the bigger ones if you want real quality."
,OttifantSir2,2011-05-26T16:01Z,"To Kobie714 and others: 1280x528 IS HD for this, as it isn't 16:9 or 16:10 (widescreen), but 2.35:1 or 2.21:1 (cinema). If you want to exclude details on the sides, crop it to 16:9 or 16:10 with your videoplayer of choice, or change the aspect ratio to same if you can stand to watch people with 2 meter long faces ;-)"
