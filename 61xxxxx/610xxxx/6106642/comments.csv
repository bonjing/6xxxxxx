i'll be waiting for a decent upload...from someone who doesn't lie blatantly about cams being dvdrips...
visual: 6.5
audio: 8
i assume the other 4.36 gig version of this movie currently listed as a dvdrip is identical to this one...bah."

Source.............: Love And Other Drugs 2010 720p TS XViD - IMAGINE
TS TS TS. learn where the f*cking letters stand for:
Telesync same as a CAM but with extern audio making the (most of the times) sounds being better quality...
farahad, really... stop complaining and go see the movie in a theatre if you want good quality lol!"
,kabilie,2011-01-20T15:15Z,"btw, good upload again Nlupper :)
