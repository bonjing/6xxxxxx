Branded as renegades for crimes they did not commit, a heroic group of young G.I.s is forced to "turn fugitive" as they battle to clear their names and expose the evil that is Cobra Industries â€” a seemingly benevolent mega-corporation covertly controlled by a rogues gallery intent on creating a New World Order

According to the recent "Hub Exclusive" TV broadcast, promoting this series and the Transformers Prime, homages to The A-Team movie are used in the background of this incarnation of the characters. Most notable is that Roadblock is stated to parallel to B.A. Baracus in size and mechanical aptitude, and Flint is formally an actual officer (First Lieutenant in Army Intelligence) rather than a warrant officer and is specifically used as the officer assigned to arrest the "Renegades", akin to Colonel Lynch of the A-Team series. Also Lady Jaye is sympathetic to her long time friend Duke and provides covert support to the him and the Renegades as was Captain Charissa Sosa in the A-Team film and AAA in the 1980s TV series.

Opening

After two episodes, the series intro is narrated by David Kaye who narrated this:

"Accused of a crime they didn't commit, a ragtag band of fugitives fights a covert battle to clear their names and expose the insidious enemy that is...COBRA. Some call them outlaws. Some call them heroes. But these determined men and women think themselves only as 'Ordinary Joes'. And this is their story."
