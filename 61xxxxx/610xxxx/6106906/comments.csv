,Chadly,2011-01-17T18:31Z,"Yeah if its like Toxic-Ink then its cropped to hell. watchable tho. Funny at one part theyre talking and all you can see is the horses heads, makes it look like the horses are talking lol some spots a blurry as hell but for free it was worth it :) I dont thik I missed much from the cropping... Not worth spending money in a theater for :)"
