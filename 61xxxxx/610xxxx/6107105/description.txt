[code]SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION

Project to mark Yokohama City's 150th anniversary.
On Planet Abel, humans and robots co-exist. One day a mysterious stowaway on a transport vessel tries to invade the planet, but is discovered by Apollo (Hayato Ichihara), a robot that looks like a human; and Mikaru (Aya Ueto), a human that looks like a robot. The stowaway had in his possession a memory chip containing the latest in camouflage software, the mysterious â€œCipherâ€ OS. Apollo takes the Cipher chip simply for fun, but has no idea what heâ€™s getting himself into. He suddenly starts acting strange, but Mikaru has no idea whatâ€™s wrong or that Cipher is behind it. What exactly is Cipher? What sort of secrets does it hold? Apollo and Mikaru will unravel a mystery encompassing the past, present, and future to find out.
