,Armorus,2011-04-08T08:23Z,"It's not uncut, it's 25 fps. IMDb times are for 24 fps"
,Armorus,2011-04-08T08:24Z,"^^ I meant ""not cut"""
,trex1983,2011-05-15T18:09Z,Thanks for putting this movie WITHOUT hard Eng subtitles. More enjoyable if your native language is French.
,KarpoofdaJulii,2011-05-21T13:30Z,"The included subtitles come out of sync towards the end of the movie which sucks since everything else is ok. You can download another English subtitle here and delay to 11000 ms ~

remember to delay 11000ms as they are waay out of sync but are at least consistent."
