,Sissymom,2011-01-25T16:41Z,"Thanks Aimee, 
I am using Bit Torrent. I am so confused on this I am just ready to send my e-mail so that I can just send them to people.  I will try and reload these on the Bit Torrent and just let it run and see if it will seed."

then everyone who download the books wil become a seed. keep seeds alive"
