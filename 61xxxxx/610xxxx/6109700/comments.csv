Strange, I can use the same serial over and over again, had to deactivate my firewall for a while, and of course PGWARE server react and blacklisted the serial, but I can use the exact same serial to register again. (honestly, no B)

Do you need new serial(s) ?"

superRam Registration
superram Tray applet

that should do the trick."
