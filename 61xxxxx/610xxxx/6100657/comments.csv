,peg.leg.paul,2011-06-04T06:38Z,Nothing finer to turn up the volume and bop your head to. Keep up the great work!
,scottsasse,2011-06-21T03:19Z,"@peg.leg.paul, glad I could help!!"
,WellBeSerious12,2011-07-14T19:29Z,Could you PLEASE upload a FLAC version of the full album? Thank you...
,scottsasse,2011-07-23T12:19Z,"@ WellBeSerious12, Actually I discovered that the entire album already exists in FLAC on Pirate Bay. It is the only other Haddaway torrent that is in FLAC besides mine. Here is all the info you should need to find it: http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5597180/Haddaway_-_The_Album-%5BTifon%5D.5597180.TPB.torrent  If you have any troubles or questions feel free to contact me at DrWynnScott@gmail.com or leave a comment here. Thanks for the request but I see no reason to upload something that already exists. Try that first and if there are problems I will then be happy to upload it for you. Also you may want to click on my user-name to check out my other torrents!! Peace & Love, DrScott "

,NAME3456,2011-08-16T09:52Z,"I don't even like the entire song, just the part from 0:17 - 0:32.  I'm making a file that loops that continuously."
,scottsasse,2011-09-12T02:14Z,"@ rockone707 and looneyk2, THANKS for saying thanks and I'm glad to help out my fellow pirates!! ................................................................@ NAME3456, That's ok dude, I kind of both hate and love this song, mostly I hate that I love it!! So by all means feel free to loop ""just the part from 0:17 - 0:32"" and listen to just that until you go legally insane or should I say loopy:):)  Or better yet just buy a techno CD!!!"
