,kennyeveret,2011-01-18T17:32Z,"Good quality and Korean sub pop up's do not spoil film. Thanks i had low expectations for this after all the vampire shit thats about, but is was nothing short of genius.

From Wikipedia: Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote ""Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years."" 

Say no more Chloe Grace Moretz is a star !

Personally this version is pretty much like the original but just not as good."

,gendk,2011-01-20T07:59Z,"Actually, Let the Right One In is a Swedish movie, not a Danish one - definetly worth a watch, though. Semi social-realistic vampire flicks are all too rare."

A=4

Don't download this vhs quality crap."
