BEN WEBSTER SEE YOU AT THE FAIR
[b]Label: Verve/Impulse
Format:Flac


Ben Webster's final American recording was one of his greatest. At 55, the tenor saxophonist was still very much in his prime but considered out of style in the U.S. and would soon permanently move to Europe. Joining Webster on this fine quartet set is Hank Jones and Roger Kellaway on piano, bassist Richard Davis and drummer Osie Johnson. Webster's tone has rarely sounded more beautiful than on "Someone to Watch Over Me" and "Our Love Is Here to Stay."

Recorded at Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey between March and November 1964.
