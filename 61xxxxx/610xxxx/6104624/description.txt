PLOT:


A married woman (Basinger) falls in love with a Benedictine monk. 

After sending her daughter off to school, Jessie (Kim Basinger) finds herself feeling alone and restless in her 20-year marriage. When she receives a disturbing phone call, she embarks on a journey to her childhood home on a beautiful island to deal with the shocking behavior of her mentally unstable mother. While delving into her family's secretive past, Jessie meets and finds herself undeniably attracted to a Benedictine monk. This struggle with temptation, combined with the unearthing of her own history, leads Jessie to undergo a spiritual, artistic and erotic awakening - all which help her discover her true self and what she wants out of life.
