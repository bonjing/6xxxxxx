,anth303,2011-03-26T16:13Z,"not to be rude but how can this be 5.5.4 , when on the official website they are only up to 5.5.1 ??"
,lif3isfr33,2011-07-30T10:38Z,"@anth303 There are different suites on their websites as shown here:

bigwimpie is sharing the Ultimate version while by default, wondershare highlights their platinum version which their latest release is 5.1.3. The Ultimate version latest version is 5.6.0

Thanks bwimpie, works great. :)"

,wrgcsg,2012-03-11T19:15Z,Serial doesn't work for me.....
,ockabatuka,2012-03-27T10:39Z,I just saved $60 on my dvd converting by switching to TPB!!! pun intended lmao. Awesome download bigwimpie!! thanks
,ockabatuka,2012-03-27T11:03Z,"(for those who dont know) double click the download. Then right click the file and go down to open with and mouse over to WinRaR archiver then click that (u will need to download WinRaR or 7zip if they dont appear in open with). now u have access to all the files. all programs accept for winrar need to be closed. click and drag serial.txt to the far right side of ur desktop. double click video converter file to begin the install. if it doesnt automatically ask for serial click register. then open up serial.txt file on ur desktop. copy and paste contents where needed. 

I know this is ridiculous so dont give me shit. this is an awesome download and people should have the full understanding of how to install before bitching about it not working.
thanks again bigwimpie"
