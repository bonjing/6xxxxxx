,Duzzy02,2011-02-02T13:58Z,"I need help. I've followed the instructions the best I can for Assassins Creed, but I keep getting 'Game is not legal' when I try to activate. I'm not sure about step 5 & 6, I just copied the two files (ser & key) to the Gameloft folder. I havn't used X-Plore just my pc. Any help would be appreciated thanks."
,LateMan001,2011-02-02T16:28Z,"Copy AssassinsCreed.ser and AssassinsCreed.key and paste them inside C:/Gameloft.

So that the path becomes like this:
C:/Gameloft/AssassinsCreed.ser
C:/Gameloft/AssassinsCreed.key

Open Assassin's Creed from the menu, and press 'Yes' twice: once for the activation which will succeed, and once for extracting the existing files."
,Duzzy02,2011-02-02T18:30Z,"I've tried that. I have installed to E: mass storage internal memory because C: doesn't have much space if that could be an issue.
Connecting to my pc via usb mass storage mode I have P:\Gameloft and in that folder are the two files (ser & key) and a games folder 'P:\Gameloft\Games' containing the AssassinsCreed folder with only an mp4 file. I also have P:\AC.zip. Activation fails with 'not legal' no option to extract.
Is it possible the activation process has blocked the ser & key file in the torrent?"
,LateMan001,2011-02-02T19:13Z,"Instead of connecting to PC via usb, Install x-plore, Enable view hidden and system files, go to Tools, Configuration, tick ""Show hidden files"", tick ""show system files"". & now look for the directory ""C:/Gameloft/"" & files ""AssassinsCreed.ser"" & ""AssassinsCreed.key"" So that the path becomes like this: C:/Gameloft/AssassinsCreed.ser & C:/Gameloft/AssassinsCreed.key & if these files are not present, paste there. & these all games have to be installed to E: mass storage."
,Duzzy02,2011-02-02T20:04Z,"Well I tried exactly what you said, but I keep getting the same error. 
   I uninstalled and reinstalled, copied the files from PC to temp folder on phone, used X-plore following your instructions, found C:/Gameloft, the 2 files were there so I overwrote them with the ones from the temp folder (from PC). Same error. 
   Originally I was placing them in the gameloft folder on E:, could the activation server be blocking my phone now? Any other ideas? I have a nokia N8 if that makes a difference."
,Duzzy02,2011-02-02T20:39Z,"I just trid Hero of Sparta HD and I get the same error as Assassins Creed. That game has no ser or key file in the folder. 

I used SignSISTool with a certificate from opda. GenialSIS wouldn't sign Assassins Creed."
,LateMan001,2011-02-02T20:44Z,Uninstall Assassins Creed & then install Spiderman. Post if its working for u. 
,Duzzy02,2011-02-02T20:58Z,"I have already tried Spiderman with the files in the wrong place and after correcting my errors I get the same error. I have to go to bed now been up all night, 7am here. I'll try Avatar later when I get up and let you know how that goes."

,Duzzy02,2011-02-03T09:46Z,Avatar works fine but it didn't require activation.
,dRmAA,2011-02-04T08:10Z,"Thanks for the upload man, really appreciated, but Spiderman, assassin creed aint workin. followed the instructions to the letter, tried Freesigner and tired the pc software you kindly included to sign the games on pc, didnt work either, after overwriting the files using the explorer and starting the game it really tries to activate only to find it illegal copy, thanks again man but do have any thing to add that might help?"
,dRmAA,2011-02-04T08:11Z,and I have N8 if it helps
,Duzzy02,2011-02-04T12:44Z,"This problem seems to be wide spread, I've gave up.

Use Google and search for 

Assassinâs Creed Symbian ""game is not legal"" 

You'll find a few other pages trying to deal with problem. None of which helped me."
,LateMan001,2011-02-04T14:39Z,"ok, will upload Assassinâs Creed & Spiderman again with another method of activation which is slightly different from this method, which should work for those having trouble with this method. 
I want to edit some info. but EDIT is disabled !"
