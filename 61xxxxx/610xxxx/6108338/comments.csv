,OrpheusDude,2011-01-20T02:12Z,"Maybe we'll seed if you give us some information:

Is this from a screener with watermarks throughout?

Is this from the commercial DVD released on Tuesday in the USA?

Are there subtitles and if so, in what languages?

Is the audio 2.0 or is there a 5.1 option?

The more you tell us, the better chance you have of getting seeders."
,The.Buzzsaw,2011-01-22T19:37Z,"I don't know exactly what your asking about but this is what I do know. It is ripped straight from a DvD and is excellent quality. The video is perfect and so is the sound. If you watch it, you will see that this and all my videos are excellent quality or I would not put them on here. The only cam quality I have ever done was Faster. All other The.Buzzsaw files are without flaw. Check any for yourself and see. Thanks, and please seed, I would greatly appreciate it."
,igorshin,2011-01-23T12:18Z,"Ready to seed via uTorrent, but cannot download the full file. Just 70.8% has been downloaded :( And I don't see any seeder with more availability percents."
,ejay8400,2011-01-27T22:44Z,This is not a DVD-rip!
,Sir_RUSH,2011-01-28T09:05Z,"It Is a DVD rip but it's a Screener.  It's a poor quality screen.  No Subs, and constant reminders which I am able to handle with 0 challenges.  Decent quality video and SD (Standard Definition) TV quality.  Fine for most people."
,Sir_RUSH,2011-01-28T09:06Z,Thank You for your Share.  I don't wish to come across as though I don't APPRECIATE it.  I Do.
,OrpheusDude,2011-01-31T13:51Z,"To Buzzsaw: Sir_RUSH answered most of my questions: this rip is from a studio Screener, not a commercial DVD.  Accordingly, the audio is most probably in 2.0 Dolby Stereo and NOT in the 5.1 Surround Sound, which is available on the commercial DVD.  And there are apparently watermarks from the studio which released this Screener.  So downloading this would be a total waste of time for someone (like me) who wants to have a good quality copy to add to my library, and not just something to pop into my computer for one or two viewings.  Comprendez vous?   Verstehen Sie?  Ya got it, dude?  Before you do your next upload, KNOW the technical specifics of what the hell you are uploading!  Good luck and thanks for trying."
,OrpheusDude,2011-01-31T13:57Z,"I also noticed that of the 24 torrents you list, 15 are dead, so that may give you some indication as to how your work is being received by te users of IMDb.  If the quality is good, there are lots of seeders for a long time; if it sucks, it dies.  Learn from this."
,The.Buzzsaw,2011-02-01T02:58Z,"Thanks for the advise guys. I just wanna help people be able to see the shows that I enjoy. Any advise to improve my future projects is greatly appreciated. I had to learn this on my own through trial and error, and I keep improving, so thanks and I look forward to hearing from you again."
,jogga24,2011-02-09T20:43Z,"thanks for the upload mate, enjoyed the film"
,guitargod4321,2011-02-16T13:21Z,Avoid this torrent I've just received an e-mail from my ISP threatening cancellation if did remove this movie from my computer 
,The.Buzzsaw,2011-02-19T23:01Z,This Guitargod guy is full of shit. He is one of those fags that go around saying they received a letter. How in the fuck did he receive a letter? Are they stalking his every move? Idiots like that just show how boring some peoples lives really are. He's just jealous because guys like me are the reason that dorks like him can't get laid. The.Buzzsaw Forever!!
