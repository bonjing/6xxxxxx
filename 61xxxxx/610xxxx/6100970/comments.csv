,kebabonline5233,2011-01-14T19:42Z,"It would really help if you explained which particular DLC's that are included, and have why is the ""DLC PACK"" in a .exe file? To fuck up my computer when i run it eh?

If this is an honest upload, i thank you. If its not, i hate you. Simple as that."
,illiria,2011-01-15T00:20Z,"It seems to be my repack. Not the latest though, I've included the latest DLCs in my latest pack also. Its a good repack, you DO NOT need patches - patches install along with DLCs in my repack.
Crack should be installed automatically too. Copy it only if it won't install automatically for whatever reason.

@ kebabonline5233

It is an an EXE file because its a (RE)PACK, dummy."
,tyrune18,2011-01-15T03:03Z,"@ kebabonline5233
Just install all four .exe files and you will have all 20 DLCs out there at the moment at your disposal.
I used Illiria's DLC Pack, which is a fully automated application, to install the first 17 DLCs and that's why it's a .exe file. It might take some time to load, but it will most certainly work and it will not fuck up your pc. Trust me on that: I'm all about spreading the joy that is Mass Effect!

@ illiria
I indeed used your DLC Pack for this torrent, but seeing as it didn't include the Aegis, Firepower and Shadow Broker DLCs, I added them. I couldn't find a DLC Pack on the internet that included all the DLCs out there at the moment, which is the main reason I created this torrent.
As for the included patch and crack: I added them just to be sure. I was worried that the three additional DLCs would overwrite your DLC Pack somehow, but I have verified that following the instructions I provided will work 100%. So no worries."
,lcwjacob,2011-01-15T05:41Z,"After i installed the Mass Effect 2 DLC Pack.exe, i can't install the other 3 .exe because it said that i should install Mass Effect 2 first. What should i do? Does the install location matters?"
,spykidwkc,2011-01-15T06:14Z,"@tyrune 18
your Mass Effect 2 DLC Pack(17 DLC included) didi not work! 
It didn't install all the DLC it supposes to.
The installation ended suddenly after saying ""Execute Command"".
And the game reported that DLC ""Kasumi"" (DLC_HEN_MT), DLC ""Normandy Crash Site""(DLC_UNC_Moment01) and DLC ""Equaliser"" ( DLC_MCR_03) are corrupted .

But  ME2_AegisPack,  ME2_FirepowerPack,  ME2_ShadowBroker are working fine.

To other downlader, you may want to replace the Mass Effect 2 DLC Pack (17 DLC) with this one.

,xiIix,2011-01-15T10:16Z,"I fucking love this game. I've played through it about 4 times already. It's just so damn good. I love great singleplayer games. Too many games are relying on multiplayer these days. The true greats are games like this, GTA4, REd Dead Redemption, Fallout 3/Vegas ect ect..

Thanks for the up. I already have the DLC's but this is a much better package for archival purposes."
,tyrune18,2011-01-15T12:09Z,"@ lcwjacob and @ spykidwkc
Everything should fall into place if you guys just follow my instructions to the letter (it worked for me). If it doesn't then there are a couple of things you could do: 

1. Do a clean install of ME2 and try again
2. Use windows update to update your system (especially .NET framework could be useful)
3. Use Illiria's DLC Pack instead of the Mass Effect 2 DLC Pack included in this torrent

I suppose that for some of you the Mass Effect 2 DLC Pack file might have gotten corrupted during download. If this is the case I apologize and I suggest you (re)download this file using the link provided by spykidwkc"

,tyrune18,2011-01-17T13:49Z,"I can honestly say that I have not encountered any of the the problems reported here myself. The only possible solutions that I can think of are:

- Turn of your firewall/virus scanner
- Obtain an English version of ME2
- Make sure you have administrator rights
- Turn off user account control
Anyway, I'm just spitballing here. For more advice I refer the people that have problems to the comments section of illiria's torrent, which contains a lot of info. Most of the problems reported here seem to be related to his DLC Pack anyway (I just repacked his file).

,Unahim,2011-01-18T21:00Z,"Ok, so, just to help out a bit.

System: Good computer running W7 64 bits.

What I did:

1)Installed game to default location.
2) Installed all DLC .exe from this torrent.
3) Ran the giveme2entitlement thing, noticed the DOS box only mentioned a few DLC, so downloaded and ran this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5489061/Mass_Effect_2__NEW__DLC_Authorization_Patch  in about 10 secs.
4) Booted up game while being un-connected to internet.
5) Everything fine, except corruption error on same three files as everyone else.

So that problem is certainly in the upload."
,Unahim,2011-01-18T22:10Z,"Downloading and installing this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5636177/Mass_Effect_2_DLC__amp__Patch_Repack_%28incl._Overlord_and_Patch_1.02  to overwrite the faulty files fixed all my problems.

Perhaps you could upload the 3 missing DLC on a different torrent, and link to that one for the first 17."

Just wanna ask what files should I make a backup of in case there are new game patches and DLC's? 

Im askin coz I noticed some files would be overwritten and maybe it would be messing up future installs.
"
,tyrune18,2011-01-20T11:07Z,"@jcsj
To my knowledge you don't have to backup anything. When a new patch is released all you have to do is to crack the game again and when new DLCs are released you have to authorize/activate them and that's it. So, no worries then."
,jcsj,2011-01-21T00:41Z,"Also, I noticed that you made an updated torrent of this one. But I haven't noticed it and I'm already half way through.

Thanks for your answer above!"

,tyrune18,2011-01-21T10:55Z,"@jcsj
There are no new DLCs in the updated torrent. For that torrent, I just removed illiria's 17-in-1 DLC Pack file and replaced it with the 17 individual DLC files.
If you want the highest chance of success, I suggest you download the updated torrent instead, because the files in that torrent are the unmodified, original ones."

Know what causes this?"

,tyrune18,2011-01-24T17:20Z,"@Sugram1
Well, I suggest you follow the instructions I provided to the letter. So, after installing the DLCs you have to activate them by running the file ""giveme2entitlements.exe"" (step 8 of the instructions). Just to be sure you can also crack the game once more by repeating step 3 (can't hurt). Once you have done that you can play the game...

By the way, do not forget to complete step 5 before you install any DLCs!"

Try copying the ""giveme2entitlements.exe"" file to your ME2 install folder and run from there.

The file should automatically locate the location where ME2 is installed (using the registry), but I think because some of you have a particular ripped version of ME2 it doesn't work... In other words, the file can't locate ME2 using the registry, so try copying it to the install folder yourselves."

Dude, the torrent you're referring to is also mine!!! It contains the same activator as this torrent, so I don't think that will solve your problem. 
There are more DLC activators out there. Just google them and try them out.
