The theory of evolution is arguably the
greatest idea the human mind ever had, and its proposer,
Charles Darwin, is among the most influential scientists who
ever lived. He changed the way humans view their place in
nature. His explanation of the evolutionary process occurring
through natural selection forms the basis of modern-day biological
sciences, including the applied disciplines of agriculture,
medicine, and, most recently, biotechnology.
There have been hundreds of books and articles about the
life and times of this great man, and I obviously cannot cover
everything there is to know in one short book. If you can read
only one Darwin book, I highly recommend the 1991 biography
by Adrian Desmond and James Moore; if you can manage
two, add Darwinâ€™s autobiography. Here, I aim to present
a more personal look at Darwin the man.
