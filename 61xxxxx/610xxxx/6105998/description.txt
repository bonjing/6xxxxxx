PLOT:
Based on a true story, this film shares with us a decade in the
lives of Jimmie Lewallen and his wife Carrie as they experience
the joys of love and marriage alongside the tragedies of war and
poverty (1939-1949). Jimmie and his friends, Bill Blair and
Fred Harb, find escape from life's challenges in racing born
out of hauling moonshine on warm North Carolina evenings and
inadvertently become racing's earliest heroes. Ultimately,
their antics laid the groundwork for what has become one of
the most lucrative sports in the world. A number of racing
firsts occur during The Fightin' Forties, making this film a
sensational history lesson as well as an exciting journey of
romance, friendship and action.
