This is an ISO of Android 2.2 Froyo (Generic) compiled for use on most PC Systems.

This version is x86 (which is normal for most desktop users), and was obtained from http://android-x86.org - but as the dowload was 7kb/s. i thought i'd offer my services as a mirror :)

The CD ISO will work as both a LiveCD and an installation CD, and the build is dated January 14th 2011.

There isn't a README or NFO with this, just nice and simply an ISO.


For newbies:
- Download and Install ImgBurn (google it)
- Double click the ISO file, which should open imgburn to write it to a CD.
- Pop the CD into whatever PC you want to try it on
- Power the PC off, Power it back on, and press whichever key is required to open the Boot Device Menu (Normally F9, F10 or F11)
- Select CD/DVD from your boot menu

and away you go! :)
