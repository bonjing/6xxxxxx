Thank You, Friend"

This refers to ""ConverttoBD9.exe
You should tell the peepul that such a character exists and is part of the lay out of the land.
I just had a brief look at it in VLC, and the quality is excellent!
Thanx!"

Just found Your legacy of uploads by clicking on Your name - My God, this is just my taste! And the bigness of the files indicate that the qualite is intact.
I guess You'll have me as a customer for a while.
