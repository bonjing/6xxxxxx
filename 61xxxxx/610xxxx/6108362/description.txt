The Tonight Show With Jay Leno 2011 01 12:  Seth Rogen, Brady Barr, Bettye LaVette

The quality is quite watchable, but not as nice as a scene release (for some unknown reason, no scene release has materialized for this). The source was non-HD, was 4:3 and this is not a digital capture. There are a couple of video/audio glitches - one at about 00:15 for about 2 seconds and one at about 31:25 for about 15 seconds.
