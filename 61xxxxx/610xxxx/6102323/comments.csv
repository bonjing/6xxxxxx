,ArtieT,2011-01-14T20:55Z,"Brilliant work again Sir, thanks, and again you promote another  film which deserves to be highlighted - Forrest Gump blatantly nicked the idea to create their 'original', more 'accessible' version, yet Hanks got the Oscar and Sellers didn't. That's Hollywood, eh?!

Compare the almost meaningless line about chocolates from 'Gump with the one at the end of this...

Thanks again!"
