M - Wow, Someone made a move about my life, in spooky detail, without even knowing I existed. Everything fits except the kid and their song.  In my case it was Bob Marley - Duppy Conqueror.

It's the best movie I have seen in a very long time but of course I would say that. 

I lift my hat of for the upload, thanks!"
