Hardcore Syndrome 3
TANOCD-0010 (2009)
FLAC
Hardcore, Hard Trance, Gabber, Speedcore



The most 'angry' of the Hardcore Syndrome albums, it has a few solid hits. Still a good J-Core album by all regards, it has less success than 1,2, and 4. More emphasis on speedcore and gabber, which can be niche tastes.

The three big hits:
No Reason (Trance) - Joshka. Ranked right next to Serotonin 2008 (from Hardcore Syndrome 2) on last.fm, his other big hit.
Irrelevance (Gabber) - USAO. This may be my favorite gabber track, from all of gabber. It ranks around fourth on USAO's last.fm playcounts.
Fuck Me Jesus (Gabber) - RoughSketch. Some really funky gabber, it's hard, it's noisy, and it has some really unique blending.
