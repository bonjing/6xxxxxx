Barnes & Noble Exclusive bonus track

Yo-Yo Ma, cello


This is a collection of somewhat romantic songs by Ma with a wide variety of accompanists. Nothing unbelievable, but an enjoyable album nonetheless. All tracks have previously been released as part of other albums with exceptions of tracks 1, 9, 11, and 12. What seems to be a quality rip of this album is already available here on Demonoid as mp3s (256+kbps); here is a lossless rip for those interested.

This copy was exclusively available at Barnes & Noble (I don't recall whether it was online or in retail) and includes a "bonus" track (16) not found on the original.

Includes all (individual) tracks encoded with flac, cue files, EAC log, m3u8 playlist, sfv/md5 hash files, and complete scans.

Enjoy, and thank you for seeding.
