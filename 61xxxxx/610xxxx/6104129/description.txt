    Francesca is a pediatrician who is dedicated to both motherhood and      
    children, married to another physician, Pedro. Following the birth of    
    a new child, Francesca begins to suffer from postpartum depression.      
    Following the advice of friend and psychiatrist Jean, the couple move    
    to a new home away from the city. But Francesca's obsession with her     
    new baby engulfs her. Regardless of Pedro's and Jean's attempts to       
    help her, she seems to drift dangerously close to madness. And to        
    make matters worse, she is starting to hear and see things. Furtive      
    figures and ghostly shadows start tormenting her. The large house in     
    which she and her family live alone seems to hide terrible secrets.      
    Both the cellar and the attic are locked and barred to the family,       
    and it is from both these places that Francesca receives nocturnal       
    visits that are slowly driving her mad.

    Source had bad hard telecine then interlaced video resulting in bad      
    frames every 3/4 out of 5. We manually recreated and reblended to        
    replace those frames and then manually decimate. Again, this is not      
    an exact science. There will be the occasional blended frame or          
    missing frame. However, we believe our encode is the best you will       
    get.
