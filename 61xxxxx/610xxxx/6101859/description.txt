DUANE EDDY HAVE TWANGY GUITAR WILL TRAVEL
[b]Label: Jamie 
Orig Year 1958
Format:Mp3@320



A pioneer in instrumental rock, Duane Eddy remains an anomaly in popular music. Eddy's distinctive "twang" guitar style complemented the infectious dance beats of his band and drove the viewers of Dick Clark's American Bandstand television show wild, even without a vocalist. This brings up the notion that perhaps pop music fans don't always require the presence of a lead singer; maybe all they look for is musical charisma, and this Eddy supplied in spades. 
Have Twangy Guitar Will  Travel was the first LP released by Eddy and his partners at Jamie Guyden Records. Recorded in 1959, this disc contains 12 rowdy rock & roll classics, including "Cannonball," "Ramrod," "The Lonely One," and "Moovin' 'N' Groovin'," all of which were successful singles. Other songs such as the sauntering "Detour" and the dark, brooding "Stalkin'" round out the set list nicely. A mix of early rock & roll, swing, country, and blues, Have Twangy Guitar Will Travel is a great example of '50s instrumental pop. (The 40th anniversary reissue also includes three superb bonus tracks.)[/color][/quote]
