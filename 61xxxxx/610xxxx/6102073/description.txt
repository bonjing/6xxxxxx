The internet can be a dangerous place just ask Jamie (Kaylani Lei), a nursing intern who is paying off her student loans by moonlighting as a cam model named Justine. One night, one of her sexy web performances takes a sinister turn when she witnesses a possible murder. The police and her husband dismiss it as a hoax. But when Jamie starts receiving threats, it becomes clear that this is not a game and everyone is a suspect.
