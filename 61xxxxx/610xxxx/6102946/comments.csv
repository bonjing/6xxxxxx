the resolution is just messed up when i click to test something it tests it and i could click ok but still it doesn't feel like have tested it and i have nivdia card 7100 with 2gb ram should be well over enough to play this"

it was the windows xp update that works (seemingly) all windows service packs includeing vistia and windows 7"
,thomaz117,2011-01-24T23:26Z,i say you should put it for all vistia people referr to the windows XP update in order to work the game
