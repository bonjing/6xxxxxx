Do you like Deadliest Catch, swords - life on the line, Or BBC Trawlermen???
If So, check this Australian Longline Fishing show out.

A mixture of unbelievable footage and unforgettable characters, Hardliners goes out to sea with Australian long line fishermen who risk it all for every catch, and for their families.
Chasing huge fish, these fishermen must also navigate their way around massive tanker ships and bulk carriers, while dealing with shocking storms and enormous seas, one wrong move could end it all!

It's like the Australian version of "Swords - Life on the Line", except their Target species is the YellowFin Tuna, and they fish offshore waters around Central NSW Australia (Sydney up to coffs harbour).
