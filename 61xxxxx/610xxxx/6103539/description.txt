Memorable Quotes:
Pepper Potts: Natalie is here! 
[Stark's notary enters] 
Tony Stark: I want one. 
Pepper Potts: No... 
Senator Stern: I think we're done with the point that he's making. I don't think there's any reason... 
Tony Stark: The point is you're welcome, I guess. 
Senator Stern: For what? 
Tony Stark: Because I'm your nuclear deterrent. It's working. We're safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can't have it. But I did you a big favor. 
[stands and turns to face the Senate] 
Tony Stark: I've successfully privatized world peace. What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns. 
Senator Stern: [Bleep] ... you, Mr. Stark. 
Senator Stern: [Bleep] ... you, buddy.
