- SPECIAL: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in His Own Words

Today is the federal holiday that honors Dr. Martin Luther King. He was born January 15th, 1929. He was assassinated April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just thirty-nine years old. While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader, he also championed the cause of the poor and organized the Poor Peopleâ€™s Campaign to address issues of economic justice. Dr. King was also a fierce critic of US foreign policy and the Vietnam War. We play his â€œBeyond Vietnamâ€ speech, which he delivered at New Yorkâ€™s Riverside Church on April 4, 1967, as well as his last speech, â€œI Have Been to the Mountain Top,â€ that he gave on April 3, 1968, the night before he was assassinated.
