,cindy25,2011-01-14T03:41Z,"wow, you made it to release log

Well last night due to presidentâ€™s speech about the recent tragedy happened in Arizona, no new episodes of â€œHuman Targetâ€ aired in US. But scene groups seemed to miss the Canada source. Here is P2P group error0001 with the 2 new episodes of the series. Enjoy"

Zap2it for this area shows that ep 12 will air next Wed both here and in the US."
