Human Target S02E10: Cool Hand Guerrero

Guerrero is framed for murder and put in prison.

This episode was recorded in Canada on Jan 12, 2011. It was scheduled to be aired the same night in the United States but was postponed to make way for an address by President Obama. 

The quality is quite watchable, but not as nice as a scene release. The source was non-HD and this is not a digital capture.
