Release Title: Surrogates 2009 BRrip 720p X264 AAC vice (HDScene Release)

Storyline: In the future, use of remotely-controlled androids called "surrogates" 

allows everyone to live in idealized forms in the safety of their own homes. A surrogate's operator is protected from harm and does not feel any pain when their surrogate is damaged. FBI agent Tom Greer has a strained relationship with his wife Maggie, due to the death of their son several years before. He never sees her outside of her surrogate and she criticizes his desire to interact via their real bodies. (Scars on her face imply that she was in the car accident that killed their son but managed to survive.) Greer and his partner, Agent Jennifer Peters, investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed. One of the victims is Jarod Canter, the son of Dr. Lionel Canter, the inventor of surrogates. Greer and Peters determine that a human, Miles Strickland, used a new type of weapon that overloaded the surrogate's systems and disabled the fail-safe mechanisms that shield an operator from harm; killing the operators. After locating Strickland, Greer attempts to bring him into custody. Greer is injured during the chase when Strickland uses the weapon again, and inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone, the Dread Reservation (one of many throughout the United States). Greer's surrogate is eventually destroyed by a mob of humans, forcing him to interact in the world without one. The Dread leader, the Prophet takes the weapon (after apparently killing Strickland).
