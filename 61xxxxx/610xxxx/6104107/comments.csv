None of these files are of my creation. I just simply took them and made them omods, so all the details wont be there for most of them. I give FULL credit of these mods to their respectful owners. thanks for the great mods guys, and the rare lady too :)

I just labeled most of the version 0.0 so ignore that. the ones that arent labeled that, already had conversion data."

I am using Oscuros Oblivion Overhual 1.33.

I do not know if it is also compatible with anything else."
