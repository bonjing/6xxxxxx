This contains my favorite,and in my opinion, best mods for The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

Here is a complete list of the contents of this pack in image form

I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t feel like typing everything out, after I just got done testing each mod and making them all OMODs.


If you are unsure about what a mod does, remember, Google is your friend.

All the mods do their job and what they promise to do.

I also included Oblivion Mod Manager (OBMM), and Oblivion Script Extender (OBSE). Download BOSS, on your own. 


The executable files are totally safe and do their jobs great. if you want more information on anything in the pack, search the name on Google with the word \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'oblivion\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' following your search.

Enjoy! and please comment, I want some feedback :)
