Aaron Dykes talks with Alex about Kurt Nimmo's article, "Is Government Attempting Nixonesque Dirty Trick with Loughner?"
This discusses the case of Nixon and Arthur Bremer, the man who attempted to kill Alabama governor George Wallace in 1972. The Nixon tapes reveal a shrewd effort by the president to spin the assassination attempt and make Bremer out to be a Democrat party supporter.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
