Falkenbach is a one-man German folk/viking metal project created by Vratyas Vakyas (literally, â€œThe Searching Wandererâ€). Vratyas Vakyas lived in Iceland for a considerable time, but now lives in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany again. Throughout the bandâ€™s lifetime, Falkenbach has progressed from a rawer, more â€œblackâ€ sound towards viking-influenced folk metal with mainly clean vocals. Vakyasâ€™ music is nowdays accompanied by session musicians.
