,isvarcreen,2011-01-21T23:03Z,ok fellas its tru its hdef 1080p great torrent but subtitles are missing i understarnd everythin or almost in english but i have no idea of italian could you upload at least the italian part subtitles please?
,isvarcreen,2011-01-21T23:05Z,its 1080p certainly but it has no subtitles for italian parts!
[T],murdoc47,2011-01-22T10:48Z,"it has subtitles for all speech and for only italian parts too. use vlc player and press V (once for all english and twice for only italian parts) or right-click menu and select.
wait for the subtitle font to render (10-20 seconds, only once, never again) and it's there!
hope it helps! other players, i'm not sure, VLC does it!"
,Bera94,2011-01-26T00:01Z,Seed pls
,Bera94,2011-01-26T00:04Z,"Seed pls I will see after I'm done. btw u can download any sub for some languages on http://subscene.com
When u take sub with similler quaility (720 p or 1080, some other) just rename that sub with name exact name of this movie... it will work 100%... just u need to find the one which is sync with this one :)"
[T],murdoc47,2011-01-26T08:48Z,"all 3 godfathers have subs. play them in VLC player and you will see. press V.
oh, and i'm seeding, and so does 80 other people."
,-Cortex-,2011-02-06T18:30Z,"1080p at 3mbit, my fucking god. This officially tops a DVD5 1080p encode of Heat at 3.2mbit.

Nice job, now the noobs will see 1080p thinking they're getting quality."
[T],murdoc47,2011-02-06T22:12Z,"i don't know if you're thankful or bitching. heat is one of my favorite films, and yes, i have that exact copy and it's the best.
did you download this copy of the godfather? did you check the quality? please do."
,and_rew,2011-02-11T19:44Z,Why does the audio not work?
,and_rew,2011-02-11T19:45Z,"I just spent hours DL'ing thus torrent and no sound. How cool....
Plz help."
[T],murdoc47,2011-02-11T22:56Z,"the audio is AC3. use the correct codecs (k-lite codec pack), or VLC player. i'm not sure if consoles support it."
,edm_ddd,2011-02-13T22:01Z,"Thank you for uploading. I don't know a lot about rips, but I wonder if the quality is full hd good even though file size is only 4 gb? No offense, just curious how it works."
,-Cortex-,2011-02-19T18:04Z,"@murdoc47

Just bitching. You're clearly blind if you think a movie encoded at 2.5x the minimum bitrate for 1080p (as defined by the scene) is anyway near comparable to the source.

I'd rather not waste my bandwidth downloading something that looks like shit. I'd be happy to comment on screenshots or a sample if you'd be willing to post them

@edm_ddd

Nope, this looks like shit. 3mbit passable for 720p, just, but for 1080p (twice the resolution) it is *way* too low. Should be at least 8mbit.

I suggest you get the 720p versions available from ADHD (pt1) and SiNNERS (pt2 and 3). Video bitrate for those is 5mbit."
[T],murdoc47,2011-02-21T21:24Z,thank you for your feedback.
,penandpike,2011-03-02T13:53Z,"-Cortex- especialy for you there is yet another great release with 2600 bit rate. check it out.

,youthanasia21,2011-05-31T18:21Z,"very nice quality, love it!

Sadly it didnt worked on divx player, i had to download VLC to watch it, but is fine."
,sturdytoast,2011-07-25T13:33Z,"quality is good here! thanks for the upload, murdoc!"
,hesicad,2012-01-06T06:30Z,how do you play mkv files??? tried alot of things nothing works
[T],murdoc47,2012-01-06T10:13Z,"only on a computer. vlc player, media player classic etc."
,gur955,2012-03-15T21:45Z,"Working perfectly on pc and on home theatre, keep up the work ;)"
,Zapfinger,2012-06-08T23:43Z,"Hey, i would like to watch this on my xbox 360 via the media center extender but i cant get the subtitles to work so i try to burn them in using handbrake but then there are no subtitles at the italian parts even though i have selected those to be burned into the video file so what am i doing wrong? i have had this problem with harakiri and seven samurai aswell were i tried to get the english subs to work for the japanese audio but it didnt work aswell even though i had the right file selected and i had ""burned in"" on ""yes"" o.O so i must be doing something totally wrong here.."
[T],murdoc47,2012-06-10T00:03Z,"sorry, i don't own a console. but you can try this: download an *.srt format subtitle separately, name it ""The Godfather.srt"" and the media center or other player should automatically recognize it and play it. it's just an idea, but hey."
