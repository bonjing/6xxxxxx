,Espana25,2011-01-15T16:59Z,OK i got this downloaded to my PC and now its crashing my FSX something wrong with the GPSmodule.dll file i suppose because thats the error of running it while FSX starts...! 
,beedeejee,2011-01-15T21:22Z,"You need to put this in dll.xml:

Launch.Addon>
		GPS Module
		False
		False
		Modules\GPSModule.dll
		module_init
		module_deinit"

,Cruzu,2011-01-17T23:14Z,Thanks! This one works better than my torrent. :)
,BasilHoneycup,2011-01-18T00:30Z,"Installed fine just the DLL thingy puzzles me, I copied and pasted the stuff written here in the comments but the FMC just doesn't accept entry, after 10 min the A/C is dead and I have to reload the A/C"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-18T06:35Z,this is what I was in need of!
,BasilHoneycup,2011-01-19T10:19Z,"Anybody any ideas?, Is the DLL command written OK ? just asking. W764b, UAC = down"
,Hacker907,2011-01-19T16:06Z,"FMC also doesn't work for me, I can't enter anything on its keyboard (everything else works fine)"
,Hacker907,2011-01-19T16:14Z,"FMC also doesn't work for me, I can't enter anything on keyboard (everything else works fine)"
,Hacker907,2011-01-19T17:21Z,And after 10 minutes it stops working.
,Hacker907,2011-01-19T18:35Z,"Until now I wasn't using GPSmodule.dll, but when I run it FSX crashes."
,Espana25,2011-01-22T16:43Z,Same issues with DLL file FSX crashes the moment it runs..! 
,spyboter,2011-01-23T12:57Z,"How do you make it work? I`ve tried everything :inserting the text into the dll on top, in the end. Nothing worked."
,Hacker907,2011-01-23T16:36Z,For me evreything works except FMC because GPSmodule.dll is probably corrupted.
,spyboter,2011-01-23T22:17Z,Actually the plane itself is SUPER. It works great The only issue is the MCDU. I can`t type anything in it. 
,mickyfinnny,2011-01-24T21:12Z,"The only way ive found to get round gpsmodule.dll error is to install version 1.00(follow the instructions).Then overwrite the folders with this version except dont copy the Module and Navigraph folders(I got a gpsmodulle.dll error at first, but allowed it to run),I can now successfully write into the MCDU....At last"
,spyboter,2011-01-24T21:36Z,"I also managed to fix the bug. I simply reinstalled my FSX. Now i can write in the MCDU. I suspect that if you have other Add-ons that is causing the problem.
Like the Airbus X a lot. Best Add-on ever"
