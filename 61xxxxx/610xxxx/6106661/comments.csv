,drako314,2011-11-04T11:58Z,"Great quality even on a 1080 hi def screen!, and of course a timeless classic, brilliant etc... 

Recommended for those who don't want to download the 1080 hi def version as this one it great."
,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-10T23:47Z,"I only give out V/9 & V10 rating for Blu-ray quality and V/8 & V8.5 for DVD quality....And I don't rate the audio unless it's either fantastic or terrible....This movie gets a very strong 8.5 from me....Or even a 9....Excellent quality!!!...Undoubtedly, the best quality of YIFY's animated collection....... 8)"
