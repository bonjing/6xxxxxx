,The OutLaw Torn,2011-01-17T03:49Z,"EXCELLENT! To the uploader, PLEASE continue to post this series as it's aired! I still have the original 1970's version of this documentary that shocked america! Filmed in the old 16mm film format, it looked much grainier and ominous in nature than this remake. If you haven't seen the original under the title of ""Scared Straight"", you should definitely check it out. I want to see if this updated version of the series is going to hold up to the original. Thanks again for the u/l and keep'em coming! Oh! By the way, the torrent is legit and video and audio quality are:

v: 9
a: 9"
