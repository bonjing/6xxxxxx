This compilation of rare material from The Teardrop Explodes features 16 songs culled from lost recording sessions, demos and the various live bootlegs that have permeated the underworld these past twenty years. Having a bee in his bonnet about the manner in which ex-managers endlessly re-package the same stuff over and over, Julian Cope has located and re-mastered this ancient material for your perusal, delivered as a shiny new album in the Zoo Records tradition of clashing colours and rudimentary graphics.
