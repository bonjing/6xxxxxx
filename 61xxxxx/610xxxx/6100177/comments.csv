,crsxbox,2011-04-10T07:01Z,Please give back by uploading at least 200 kB/s. With 36 seeders downloads should be way faster. I'm uploading around 300 kB/s and bringing between 100 and 200 kB/s. This means everyone is capping their uploads to something measly like 5 or 10 kB/s. GIVE BACK PLEASE  BTW THANK U flaos

A couple of things: ""A Wrong Foot"" won't open for me in VLC, and a couple of files are missing either the left or right audio track.  ""Calculated Coincidence"" also seems to be tacked on to the last two minutes of another episode.

Other than that, this is a fantastic torrent.  Thank you so much.  :)"
