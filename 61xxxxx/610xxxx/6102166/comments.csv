,icebankmiceelf,2011-03-23T19:31Z,ok im not gonna say anything about your upload bein bad cuz that aint my place. i will say that i dont think its cool that your using aXXo's name to try and get more people to use your torrent. aXXo wasnt about gettin people to download his shit he was about free sharing. and aXXo hasnt uploaded in two years because the fuckin mpaa is up his ass about shit. and i can honestly say that your not aXXo cuz my homeboy knows him... and i would have already been told if he was uploading again... jfs... dont make it a popularity contest just keep the sharing free. thats all i have to say
