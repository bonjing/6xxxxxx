Australian Dean Haitani's first introduction to blues music and a big influence on Deanâ€™s blues guitar style was B.B. Kingâ€™s â€œLive In Cook Countyâ€ Album. Practicing 10 hours a day, Dean submerged himself in B.B. and any other music he could get his hands on. Major music influences include: Mark Knopfler, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Tommy Emmanuel, Albert Collins, Johnny Winter, Clarence Gatemouth Brown, Billy Joel, Les Paul, Charlie Christian, Miles Davis, George Benson, The Gipsy Kings and The Bondi Cigars.

Deanâ€™s solo acoustic shows comprise of foot percussion, a variety of guitars (plus octave, delay, distortion, phaser & wah effects), vocals & harmonica. Deanâ€™s band shows range from raw 3 piece to full band (Keys, backup vocals, horn sections). Stylistically, Deanâ€™s music is Roots Music (a melting pot of funky rhythms, jazzy influenced progressions, folk subtleties, country flavours & blues grit.) His music is contemporary, forever pushing the musical envelope, his tasteful, original songs are stories are from the heart & mind, with compassion for humanity. â€œI always try to look at the world in a positive way with all itâ€™s marvels and flawsâ€, he says.
