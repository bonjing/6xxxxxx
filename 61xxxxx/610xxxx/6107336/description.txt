commentary tracks, and scans of the packaging, DVDs and booklet.  See the

Background:
Although nominally occurring in the same continuity as the previous Transformers
series, there was a very obvious effort on head writer Masumi Kaneda's part to
make Masterforce a "fresh start", introducing an entirely new cast of characters
from scratch, rather than using any of the previous ones. To this end, although
the toys are mostly the same in both Japan and the West (barring some different
color schemes), the characters which they represent are vastly different - most
prominently, the toy known to Western audiences as Powermaster Optimus Prime is
known as Ginrai in Masterforce, a human trucker who combines with a Transtector
(a non-sentient Transformer body, a concept lifted from Headmasters) to become
a Transformer himself. The other Powermaster toys (known in Japan as Godmasters)
and the Headmaster figures released during that year were the same: human beings
who become robots.
