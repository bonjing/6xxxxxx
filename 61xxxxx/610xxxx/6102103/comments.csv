,holotape,2011-01-19T21:47Z,What codec was used to encode them?  Having issues
[V],err0001,2011-01-20T23:16Z,"@holotape:

I haven't checked all of the videos, but at least some have various issues: uncropped, interlaced and large filesize. 

In addition some appear to have audio encoded as MP2 instead of MP3 so if you aren't hearing audio, that probably explains why.

If you search for ""Todd Evil"" (without the quotes), you'll see all 13 episodes of season 1 by err0001. All of these files should play without problems.

I'm not putting down the encoder of these files or the uploader. When I started doing this, my stuff was similar. I'm in the same position relative to scene releases - their stuff is almost always way better quality. And if someone has the choice, they should upload scene versions instead of mine if they want the best quality. "
