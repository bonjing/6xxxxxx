                         Advanced English Dictionary
 


Advanced English Dictionary is distinguished from the other (paper, electronic) 

dictionaries in many ways. Not because it contains far more words than a 

conventional paper dictionary, but because it uses a radically new approach and 

technology called WordNet. Instead of just listing the words and their definitions, 

Advanced English Dictionary shows how every word is linked to another. Type in the 

word â€œtreeâ€ and you will get not only the definition, synonyms and opposites, but 

the hypernyms (a tree is a kind of what?), meronyms (what are the parts of a tree?) 

and more. You can also find a list of hundreds of trees, from yellowwood to the 

Tree of Knowledge, and even all words that contain the letters t-r-e-e. This 

WordNet approach will help you to understand better the meaning of words. Linguists 

call WordNet project one of the biggest leaps for dictionaries since scholars sat 

down to write the epic Oxford English Dictionary.
