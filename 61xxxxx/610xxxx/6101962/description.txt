REVIEW:

Scrat and his inanimate sidekick go on their next mini adventure into the unknown. It\\\'s got it all- drama, comedy, action and a fair amount of Scrat\\\'s yelping to boot. Will he finally get his nut and retire happy?

There\\\'s just something about this lovable creature and his never ending quest that always makes me smile. Not his best one but definitely worth a watch for a couple of good moments. Can\\\'t go wrong with a 3 min short can you!

Even if it wasn\\\'t meant to be originally, he is easily the best thing in the Ice Age films and I hope when the next one comes out for the summer blockbusters of 2012 he gets as much screen time as the last one.
