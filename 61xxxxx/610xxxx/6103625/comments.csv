,marcusn,2011-01-15T16:05Z,It's Dead Space.
,Shadeux,2011-01-15T22:54Z,My apologies. I should have mentioned that in the title. This is the first one. 
,Shadeux,2011-01-15T22:58Z,"My bad for not mentioning that in the title. As this is my first ever torrent (not one I own), I will remember that for future references. This is the first Dead Space"
,retkesanyad,2011-01-20T17:30Z,Can you pls seed it? 260mb is come down and stopped.
,sephticle,2011-01-23T03:16Z,"Dude, don't worry. It's their bad for not realizing ""Dead_Space_PC"" = Dead Space 1. Dead Space = Dead Space 1. Dead Space 2 = Dead Space 2. They're just being annoying pricks."
,Sillysauce,2011-01-28T15:21Z,"So does this have the crack.. :P:P:P

Sorry, couldn't help it. :D"
,Shadeux,2011-02-23T05:25Z,"So how did this work our for y'all? Just curious if I should upload more, or just let others deal with it. I'm thinking about uploading ""Due Date"" dvdrip since I haven't seen it here on THB. "
,Shadeux,2011-02-25T20:00Z,*TPB is what I meant...shame on me.
,atgreen10,2011-11-05T23:24Z,Seed please!
,atgreen10,2011-11-16T21:55Z,So what about the registration code before the game runs...how do I bypass that?
,Shadeux,2011-12-15T20:03Z,@atgreen - I posted the code in the info box.
