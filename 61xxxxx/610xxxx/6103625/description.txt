THIS IS NOT MY ORIGINAL UPLOAD! I took 2 different torrents (the Dead Space file from one, the crack and serial from the other) and combined them into one. To make it easier for people to download. The ISO torrent belongs to BYGGBEE while the crack torrent was uploaded by RAZORATOR. Thanks to these two, we have this torrent.

During installation, Dead Space will ask for a serial number. That number is located in the txt file within the Crack folder. Or just copy and paste it from here: 

XLKT-QG7G-QGN6-D29X-CDW3 

After installation, move and replace PAUL.DLL with the one in the installed Dead Space directory. (ex. C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Dead Space). For a safety measure, rename the original PAUL.DLL file to PAUL.BAK if for some odd reason the crack doesn't work. 

Enjoy!
