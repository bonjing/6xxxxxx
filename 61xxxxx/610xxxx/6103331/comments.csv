Thanks mate for quick upload. And hats off to your splendid efforts. :) God bless you. :)"
,GC4516,2011-01-16T02:00Z,"Can I suggest a muh simpler way to APPLY the crack?

After completing the install for a trial period, start windows (XP) in safe mode as administrator and copy the ASHBASE.DLL module into the AVAST directory!!! then restart in normal mode.

,arush1989,2011-01-17T16:34Z,"@ locobot12: is this the final version or more program version will come in near future? Personally speaking your ""insert license file"" procedure in version 5.1.874 was bit simpler and easier than this ashbase.dll file procedure in 5.1.889. Finally it worked.... but i would still like insert license procedure... :-)

aniways thanks a lot."
,hakimouv,2011-01-18T00:07Z,Working good. Thanks a lot 
,YHH,2011-01-18T02:59Z,"@arush1989: i think the ""insert license file"" method is more risky. in the sense, that the license can be blacklisted by avast! if  they sense smth is wrong. this method here alters the registry files in our computer. more assured. i had a friend using the license file method, within a month, his license was blacklisted."
,YHH,2011-01-18T11:54Z,"today, looks like Avast has detected this crack and listed it as a virus. must adjust the settings in the file scanner to keep this program alive. set the first detection option to ""ASK"" . do this ASAP coz the moment u update, tats the moment the crack file will be eliminated! set to ""ask"" then ignore the file when asked for action. otherwise, your program cant run anymore! 

i have  tested the crack file with Avira and no detection was found so obviously, Avast has found out"
[T],locobot12,2011-01-18T14:16Z,"@YHH 

its a false positive ! happens everytime in this ashbase.dll procedure!

u can put it in the exclusion list to avoid avast from scanning the crack file!!

Crack is working perfectly well !!"
,YHH,2011-01-18T15:19Z,got it. first time out i was caught unaware~i had to reinstall the whole software again. got it done. haha.
,danielagger1,2011-01-18T17:08Z,I just had this ashbase.dll 'scare' too.  Thanx for the explanation.  Maybe an additional step for your instruction file ?  Shows that Avast! is pretty good at sniffing out questionable files.
,cutesaladka,2011-01-19T00:23Z,hey locobot everytime when i start my laptop the icon of avast shows free instead of pro everytime i inserted the licence key thas weired :( plz help :)
,panteranegra,2011-01-19T00:59Z,"Thank you very much for your continued efforts to bring us this great AV software.
Oh well. It was fun while it lasted. I'm still getting a run ""for the money"" on win7 (laptop), but in XP I have tried many times to add the ashbase.dll in safe mode, place the entire avast folder in scan exceptions, then restart the PC .... no luck. Within seconds ""Threat has been detected"" =(       I even added the avast folder to the system file scan exceptions as well. I'll just have to run something else, Avast free, or buy it (when $ income levels are flowing). In fact it is the only antivirus I would buy, i.e. with my money. As far as the company I work for: I keep my mouth shut and let them keep paying Kaspersky! "
,donx009,2011-01-19T01:02Z,How do i put it in exclusion??
[T],locobot12,2011-01-19T11:14Z,"@Everyone Plz try this for preventing avast from detecting the threat as malware!

1) open avast  > real time sheild > file system shield


http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8895_1.jpg.html

2) click on expert settings

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8896_2.jpg.html

click on exclusions > u have to add the folder in the list > click on browse >

browse to the c:/program files/alwil software/avast5 and add it!

make sure all three options [R,W,E] are checked!!

3)Click OK

Now this should do it for most of u !

restart and check if it still happens ...
if it didnt work as soon as restart u will get the false positive
since avast has to use ashbase.dll everytime before starting!!

if u are still getting the false positive then -

4)Same go to expert settings > click on actions > virus > set it to ask 
so that it wont auto-delete !!

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8897_3.jpg.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) go to settings in top right corner!

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8898_4.jpg.html


6) click on exclusion and add the folder there 

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8899_5.jpg.html

Step 6 is only for our satisfaction... it may not really work since we are excluding avast folder itself! 
just in case scenario!!

If avast already removed the file.. just follow instruction in torrent to reapply the crack and do all these to prevent scanning!!

@panteranegra 
i dont get what ur exactly saying but if u plan on buying the soft it worth go for it !!
try these steps before buying!!! "

All other bases checked. Unfortunately, every start up lead immediately to ""threat has been detected"". Even as an experiment I checked ""do nothing"" after the ask box. This still resulted in being prompted. I tried all combination of options suggested with win7 and xp (on the desktop). Somehow, for others, they've managed to keep it working (supposedly). I don't know what I may be missing. Oh well. Thanks again. 

I'm not ready to pay for it just yet. I'll use a free AV (maybe even go back to Avast free), until Avast 6 comes out - and then see how that works out. "

[T],locobot12,2011-01-25T14:42Z,"@bart_7672
You dont have to copy the license file or crack from avast folder after it got detected .. its would have been corrupted !
u can simply copy and paste from the downloded crack folder again and activate but set exclusion before that !!

I recommend u follw these steps and do a fresh install - 
Just remove Avast , Reboot , and do a reinstall completely ! Turn off internet before doing it!

Once done dont reboot - follow these 

Turn off or uncheck avast SELF-Defense module first ! 

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/9082_gdgf.jpg.html


If any shields are running Right click on the avast icon in the taskbar and turn off all shields for ten minutes or one hour [u can turn back on once everythings done]!!

Go to task manager  - end avastUi.exe process and stop avastsvc service!! 

go to folder paste the crack with admin privileges!
After pasting when u restart the crack should be applied  automatically if not just click on activate with internet connected it will work! 

but dont restart just yet!!
--------------------------------------------------------
U need to set exclusion first so that avast wont remove the crack on restart

,GAZZA7745,2011-01-25T20:35Z,"Installed over a week ago. No problems. Even updated for a couple of days. It then suggested a boot time scan, so accepted. It restarted my computer and that was the end of that. Computer completely fucked. Couldn't even get my Samsung Recovery 4 Solution to work (that was already built in to the system). Had to download allsorts of boot up discs (took days to finally get one to work). The one that did work was Hiren's, but the only option I had was to clear it back to factory settings. Lost shit loads of stuff (but that's my own fault for not having a backup). I am still installing Windows Updates now. locobot is a trusted member so I am not saying that this download is corrupted. I am just saying it as it is, and what exactly happened to me."
[T],locobot12,2011-01-25T21:20Z,"@bart 
These steps are working fine for windows 7 ultimate !! 
its working for many and i myself using avast with win 7! 
this is probably because crackers and hackers of softs have moved to win 7 platform and xp isnt exaclty the best fit for the latest cracked softs u gonna get in the future!

So i suggest its best u update to win 7 and really sorry it didnt work for u!!
BTW RH has the same crack lol 
if it didnt work here it wont work there either !
Really sorry man!"
[T],locobot12,2011-01-25T21:41Z,"@GAZZA7745 

i dont know wht to say ...ur pc seems to be compeltely fucked!
even though u dont show ur anger in ur comment i cant understand how pissed off u must be!

What might have happened is ashbase.dll crack must have been detected as a malware[false positive] in ur main drive/partition .... as avast is programmed it would have brought up the boot-time scan whenever main drive is infected !

U shouldnt have clicked yes !! 
what has happened avast must have initiallised the scan but before that it would check for the subscription which is the crack but now removed because of the false positive by avast itself!
so u see the prob .. avast is completely stuck !
if u had hit esc immedialtetly u could have recovered but apparently u didnt....so sectors where ur OS was installed  must have been corrupted badly leaving ur comp fucked!

easy solution was to clean Reinstall ur OS on the same drive !
did u try that first???

some of ur files might still be recoverable try ""freeundelete"" software  !  
but if u had wiped drive then not much chance of that !!

Anyways man i am sorry for what has happend!
This has worked for many people but badluck i guess ;(
Also not only trusted user like me but also VIP users of tpb have the same uploaded! 
u can check out ""Robinhood's"" Upload it has the same prob though!!
avast suddenly added the crack as malware to their virus database to prevent us using it !
thats the root of the problem!"

avast must have detected the crack as malware and removed as soon as u downloaded it ....
all u had to do was disable avast and redownload the crack and do it!

@jigjin
i have 1 desktop pc and 2 laptops... each one has different antivirus so it depends... 
The only antivirus soft i would never recommend to anyone is Norton because it has a very powerful scanner that it damaged my hardware TWICE!
But i assure you avast is the best :) "

,YHH,2011-02-04T16:58Z,"after so many attempts on other cracks, i've eventually decided to stay on this one. haha.. we all know why ;).... anyway, locobots buddy, i wanted to ask u, can i do a boot-time scan using this avast?? there has been speculations tat cracked versions would gobble up the OS when boot scan is conducted? your thoughts please??"

READ THE COMMENTS BEFORE SAY ANYTHING FUCKHEAD!


ITS A FALSE POSITIVE AND TO FIX AVAST FROM SCANNING IT U NEED TO SET IT TO EXCEPTION 

I recommend u follw these steps and do a fresh install - 
Just remove Avast , Reboot , and do a reinstall completely ! Turn off internet before doing it!

Once done dont reboot - follow these 

Turn off or uncheck avast SELF-Defense module first ! 

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/9082_gdgf.jpg.html


If any shields are running Right click on the avast icon in the taskbar and turn off all shields for ten minutes or one hour [u can turn back on once everythings done]!!

Go to task manager - end avastUi.exe process and stop avastsvc service!! 

go to folder paste the crack with admin privileges!
After pasting when u restart the crack should be applied automatically if not just click on activate with internet connected it will work! 

but dont restart just yet!!
--------------------------------------------------------
U need to set exclusion first so that avast wont remove the crack on restar"
[T],locobot12,2011-02-13T22:54Z,"Contd.... follow these steps

1) open avast > real time sheild > file system shield


http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8895_1.jpg.html

2) click on expert settings

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8896_2.jpg.html

click on exclusions > u have to add the folder in the list > click on browse >

browse to the c:/program files/alwil software/avast5 and add it!

make sure all three options [R,W,E] are checked!!

3)Click OK

Now this should do it !!

Restart and check if it still happens ...
if it didnt work as soon as restart u will get the false positive
since avast has to use ashbase.dll everytime before starting!!

if u are still getting the false positive then -

4)Same go to expert settings > click on actions > virus > set it to ask 
so that it wont auto-delete !!

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8897_3.jpg.html

--------------------------------------------------------
Do this also- 

5) go to settings in top right corner!

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8898_4.jpg.html


6) click on exclusion and add the folder there 

http://www.imagedoll.com/show.php/8899_5.jpg.html

If avast already removed the file.. just follow instructions Repaste the crack into folder and do all these to prevent scanning!!

THIS SHOULD FIX IT BUT IF IT STILL DETECTS AS A THREAT - 

DO THIS - 

Go to Real-time shield \ file system shield \ expert setting \ scan when excuting \ UNCHECK the ""scan libaries (DLLs) when loadinG""

[T],locobot12,2011-02-23T10:03Z,"@crossbear

THAT license is applicable for the avast 6 only... why would u go and insert to this version.. this is 5.1.889 the previous one!
this torrent comes with the crack .... u cant apply the crack and also the license... u only had to apply the crack and restart the pc...

both crack and another license probably screwed avast...
1st go to safe mode... remove the crack , disable everything and uninstall !
get the soft ""Your uninstaller""... its designed to help in these cases!!

after u uninstalled 5.1.889 just install avast 6 with license i have provided!!

Ok thank you for the extra help, it's very appreciated. I'm gonna try uninstalling now, rereading directions, and then give it another go. Like I said, everything went smoothly till I tried setting up the internet security. Security 6 is compatible with antivirus 5.1 yes? Hopefully I'll figure it out
