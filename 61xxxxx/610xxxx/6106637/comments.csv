,the_duckman,2011-01-18T21:04Z,"everyone said this movie was awesome (they were right btw), so I made myself some tacos for dinner and sat down to watch it... 10 min into the movie, I thought that this seems familiar somehow ^^. I actually knew what would happen after allmost every scene. Then I realised that this movie was exactly the same movie as the swedish movie ""LÃ¥t den rÃ¤tte komma in"". This was just an american remake with exactly the same story, same environment and hell... even the same dialogs.

But anyway, eventhough it was a completely identical conversion from another movie, with a director who must have had the part of his brain that holds own imagination cut out, this is one of the best movies ever made :P"

This American version never hide the fact it was a ""REMAKE"" when they advertised the film it even mentioned it.

At the Cinema when previews were coming of this film they even had it onscreen that it was a remake of the classic ""Let the right one in"".

Either way two damn good films.

Thanks for upload raymondhome!"

,givazo,2011-01-23T13:20Z,"""Let me in"" is the american version from the swedish movie ""Let the right in""
The swedish version was really slow but very deep without showing to much violence, sex ...

So you can imagine what the American version added to it...

its about what you want to do, if deleting ur download right away is what you want to do, do it. but dont complain when there is something you really want and no one is seeding it. seeding does slow down internet connectivity, so i only seed when im not home or asleep. you can pause your seeds when needed.. this particular download has over 5000 seeders/leechers but only about 45 are active... so..."
,nanimo,2011-01-31T20:21Z,Swedish version was sooo much better. But I guess stupid Americans cant understand such things. Or read subtitles for that part either.  lol

,dlarrym1111,2011-02-02T07:36Z,"@Nabarun: YOU ARE WRONG as one can be. the 96khzs refers to the sample rate and means that in 1 second, the signal is ""checked for errors"" almost 100,000 times. Most CD players sample at 44khzs and DVD's sample at a higher rate, 48khz. 96khz means that in just 1 minute, the signal is sampled almost 6,000,000 times!!! YES, 6 MILLION times. How many times is enough. I doubt your ear could even tell the difference between 44khz and 96khz sampling rates. HAVING SAID that, there were a few CD players and a few DVD players that could run audio sampling at 96khz per sec sample rate. These devices that were able to do this 10 years back were very high end.  -part 1-"

,nedram9,2011-02-04T23:55Z,"@dlarrym1111

You seem to be confusing kbps with khzs, my good sir. Always worth checking your facts before jumping down someone elses throat for the same reason. 

96khzs is double the standard broadcast quality audio sampling rate, we usually work at either 44.1 or 48 should the specific project require. (I'm talking TV broadcast here, cinema can and does of course go higher as you correctly pointed out to allow for 5.1 and above sound design and playback).

However, the '96' in question here is refering to kbps - and kbps is a different element of the audio process altogether. 

96kbps is NOT decent quality audio. On a professional level, anything below 256kbps often requires special dispensation from the broadcaster to pass tech check stage. 

Play back 96kbps audio through your computer, or some cheap headphones and you'll be fine. But through anything even remotely high spec and you'll hear the poor quality. The compression at that rate will have a 'tinny' effect and will sound flat. Play a 96kbps audio file through a professional mixing desk and the sound quality is laughable. 

I too am not ""being cruel or mean spirited"" but as you so rightly point out ""others may read your incorrect comments and take them as true. It is my duty (if I see errors or false data being posted) to flesh it out so all can see the truth"".

Regardless, thanks for the upload.

,dlarrym1111,2011-02-05T07:18Z,"@nedram9: No offense taken. If i confused the sample rate vs bit rate and was ranting on the wrong set of numbers, I gladly take any correction esp. if it also points anyone else in the right direction. I wasn't just being a hypocrite. I truly do appreciate your pointing out my errors, so no hard feelings at all. Sounds like you have been, or are in the business of Videography or similar field. Everything is all good as they say. 

I actually came back to comment on the movie an how great a film I thought it is. I know this is a remake and I have NOT seen the original. The very interesting thing to me was how the film makers were able to keep within the genre of HORROR, but in many ways it was more of a tragedy. I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I'll leave it at that. It is well worth watching and as far as how the quality came out, it was very decent as well V- 8 to 9 and A- 8. The korean subs are present and ""hard"" watermarked into this copy, but as another commenter had said, it isn't very destracting. One of the few horror films that at the end makes you feel a sense of compassion for the antagonist or supposed antagonist. I highly recommend this film as far as quality and plot. I wouldn't be surprised if a better rip/version ends up getting posted before to long, but like I said, this is very watchable. Not perfect, but very good.
Thanks again raymondhome  for your usual high quality uploads. walk well!"
