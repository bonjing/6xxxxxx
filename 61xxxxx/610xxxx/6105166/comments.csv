Could you maybe have the slightest idea that the majority of the downloaders have not anymore Classic running on their computer. Could you als perhaps imagine that it would be fair for those people and others, to know in advance that any downloading is SENSELESS??!!
THIA APPLICATION RUNS ONLY ON CLASSIC!!!"
,rhflem12345,2011-01-17T19:54Z,"Hey mtail, do you think that people are so stupid that they would not know that? One look at the title should clue folks in. BTW, some people still run Classic! You are the one who is SENSELESS!!!"
,mtail,2011-01-17T21:25Z,"rhflem,
Don't you think that it would cost just a little effort, and friendlyness as well, that the uploader simply could mention the system requirements, as a polite and civilised gesture?!You call that, turning the world upside down, SENSELESS?"
,STorrents,2011-01-22T11:57Z,"Dear mtail and rhflem12345, It wanted to ad 'classic' when I was finished, however TPB won't let me, I get 'EDIT - Temporarily disabled !'. I thought that the majority of people would know it's only for classic, but it's nice indeed to add it in the description/title.
