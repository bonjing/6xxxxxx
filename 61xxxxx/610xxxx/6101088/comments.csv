Religious fantasy book for child molesters!

Maybe you should check out what you believe b4 you say idiotic stiff like that:

Since you believe that there are no moral absolutes, YOU are the one who believes in child molestation. If you believe that we make our own morals, what's right and wrong, then if a society can find some redeeming quality in molesting children, then it's OK to do. As long as it's legal, then do it. So, if you were in India you'd beat your wife or support spouse abuse? That's your stand. ""The fool has said in his heart that there is no God."" Get ready for judgment day, fool!"

You live in fantasy world grow up and learn to think for your self!"
,DevilNuts,2011-03-23T22:25Z,"Wait... Let me get this straight...

You're using THE BIBLE as the source of morality in OPPOSITION of spouse abuse?

I think that tells us pretty much everything we need to know about your credibility. "

,CapnVon,2011-05-22T07:24Z,"It could be just me but it doesn't take an instruction book to realize why it's not okay to steal, molest/rape or anything else. 
The fact that you depend on the bible on your morals and not actually understanding why it's wrong without it is the scary part. 
And it doesn't help you on your part to say stuff that will make you look like a nut like waiting for an apocalypse for example. Judgement day, right- say hi to the terminator for me."

Maybe... just maybe... If we could get more people to read there bibles we would have more atheists!"

,maggotrape,2011-09-07T06:14Z,"@ Tamarind 
I cannot believe that you are trying to pretend that your religion is not filled with depraved sicko fucks. The christian religion has been responsible for THE most despicable acts in modern human history. The inquisition, the holocaust, the crusades, so all baby rapists aside, how you can talk about "" moral absolutes"" amazes me. Truth is, the christian faith may preach about morals, but most Christians have ""absolutely"" none. Why do you need some fairytale father figure to keep you in line anyway? Can't you just act right because it is the right thing to do? A lot of good your god does the world anyway, I'm pretty sure that ""God"" isn't up there cheering your priests along when they are balls deep in a six year old boy. Fucking nutjob."
,pssyluvr,2011-09-19T20:43Z,"If any of you morons writing comments on here take some time to study how minuscule we actually are in this universe, you'd actually realize that there might possibly be a greater power than us. Besides, as Dave Mustaine said, ""I'd rather go my whole life believing that there is a God and find out there isn't than live my whole life thinking there isn't a God and then find out, when I die, that there is""."
,SorrowExe,2011-09-25T03:08Z,HIOO I once was forced to read bible and now that I cant remember any of it except that it was a good medieval story. They were building houses and shit so Id like to listen to this shit again!!!
,legnaxd22,2011-10-11T03:54Z,Guys you can say all you want but it doesn't change the fact that God loves us all and that's why Jesus  came to die for our sins and rose again that we shall live too.... 80years of cursing is not  enough to trigger God's Wrath... but a minute of repentance is enough to experience His love and forgiveness... BTW thank for the ups!!!

,trapper22,2012-01-16T03:35Z,"I wouldn't recommend this translation. In my opinion it is oversimplified and lacks the nuance of other translations. 

The New King James Version (NKJV) and The New International Version (NIV) are both much better translations in my opinion."
,tracymollett,2012-01-27T22:23Z,"Lord forgive those who do not know you, and father I ask of you to watch over them and try to guide them in the right path....

,John777Berry,2012-02-20T06:22Z,"funny thing is: if any of you who mock/hate/insult God &/or his message actually met Jesus you'd probably really like the guy ... he hung out with loonies, whores & social misfits & had the nerve to expose the hypocritical religious leaders of his day ... really, give him a chance -- true revolutionaries like him don't come along so often"

,liight777,2012-04-26T21:50Z,"Thanks Just Pirate, not sure why all these people are here leaving comments on a Torrent that is against there belief. I also state if you actually thought for yourself, then you would realize that all the amazing things we , the world and the Universes (s) are , how incredible it all is and then you would have to know that random chances were out the window even before it was thought of. Darwin said if more then a simple cell then his own theory was not valid. Christians are perfect by any means, just forgiven, and countless so called Christians were just evil people hiding behind religion/God and still today, everywhere, they don t tell you that their God is really Lucifer or whatever.  Why would so many hate what really doesnt exist anyway, a fat budda, santa claus,  easter bunny or muhammed the evil psycho one ""get it "" dont get so many haters as does the Real Lord who came as a lowly man who was supreme in power and was for the meek and poor, so why would you hate what you say doesnt exist. Think for yourselves and ask how did all this happen, aliens cant make the heavens and earth, this is all so incredible and cant just happen, that is silly so maybe others should grow up and use there little childs brain :o) and stop blaming God for what man does, he is not a tyrant or a puppeteer but he will show his power and judgement when he says and that is all, he doesnt have to answer to little children."
