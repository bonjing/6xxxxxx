Background:
Rather than import The Rebirth three-part mini-series as a conclusion, Takara,
the Japanese producers of the Transformers toyline, opted instead to create a
spin-off of the original series by creating the full-length 35-episode series,
Transformers: The Headmasters. Supplanting The Rebirth's position in Japanese
continuity, The Headmasters occurred one year after The Return of Optimus Prime,
introducing the titular characters to the Transformers universe in a different
way. Whereas in western fiction, the Headmasters result from the merging of a
Transformer with an organic alien being from the planet Nebulos, the Headmasters
of the Japanese series are a group of small Cybertronians who departed the
planet millions of years ago and crash-landed on the inhospitable planet Master.
To survive its harsh climate, a select few Cybertronians constructed larger
bodies called "Transtectors", to which they connected as the heads.
