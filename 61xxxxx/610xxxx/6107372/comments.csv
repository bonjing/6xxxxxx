,Seefer,2011-08-14T08:41Z,"Thanks for the upload but fuckin christ, ended up having to re-encode everything, as japanese+avi=bullshit. Trying to watch it on an LG tv, so I can't just download VLC. "
,SirDread,2012-04-11T18:45Z,"sorry dude, i hate to say theres a thing wrong with this torrent, Video and audio are both 10/10...issue is i can't figure out how to switch audio tracks in vlc as you've put them up as seperate files....maybe im a nubbie, but you also could have left the files intact....nonetheless i get to enjoy Headmasters...even if in japanese"
