With the exception of two songs that have not been found, the complete recordings of singer/guitarist Blind Teddy Darby are on this CD. An expressive if not overly memorable singer, Darby appeared on 20 selections recorded at five sessions (one apiece for Paramount, Victor, Bluebird, Vocalion, and Decca) that took place two years apart from each other. The instrumentation and personnel changed from session to session, ranging from unaccompanied performances by Darby to a jam on "What Am I to Do" that includes cornetist Baby Jay, trombonist Ike Rodgers, and pianist Roosevelt Sykes. This CD gives collectors a chance to very easily have the lifework of an obscure but worthy blues performer.
