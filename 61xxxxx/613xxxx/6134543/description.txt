Pan De Sal's debut full-length album, Bebegurl, is a culmination of the band's four year-long his/herstory. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, "Bebegurl hopscotches from hot-under-the-collar hard rock with scuzzy, fuzzy, fist-in-the-air guitar riffs ("Blk Mkt Ppl") to hooky, light-headed hip-hop with fellow Vegas pop subverts Kid Meets Cougar ("Free Speech") to hypnotic, Far Eastern-sounding electro mission statements ("Borderless") in addition to surveying acres of musical terrain among them all," -Jason Bracelin Las Vegas Review-Journal 2010

Pan De Sal formed in the winter of 2006 as an experimental musical collective with anywhere from nine to twelve musicians collaborating at a time. In April 2007, Pan De Sal played its first show as a trio in Reno, NV and has maintained the current lineup since. Pan De Sal is known for their high-energy, interactive performances and political undertones. They have released one EP, The Bread is Rising (2007); a remix EP, The Revisits (2008); a mixtape, 2000 n'Totes (2010); and one full-length, Bebegurl (2010).
