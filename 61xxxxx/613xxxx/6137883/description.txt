These divx rips are unfortunately not of great quality but they are watchable.  UFOs Over Earth was a better than usual UFO documentary series on Discovery channel several years ago.  It's a shame that only 3 episodes were made.  The eps. are Mass Sightings In Mexico, The Bucks County Flap, and The Fayetteville Incident.
