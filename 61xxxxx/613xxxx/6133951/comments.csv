,guitarblues14,2011-01-28T21:40Z,"Thanks for TVD. I'm not done DLing it yet but I'm sure the quality will be excellent as usual.

If & when you are free would you please consider uploading Friends in mkv format as singular seasons. Someone on TPB has uploaded it but there are hardly any seeds on it & its really difficult to DL approx 19 GB at one go on my slow connection. If you can find the time to do it I would be really grateful. Thanks (:"

,odyssey09,2011-01-28T22:00Z,Thanks for Vampire Diaries!
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-28T22:26Z,"@guitarblues14: I do, very very rarely, season collection of my own encodes, the ones I already have and - from just finished season.
Point being - I wont upload Friends - but I can send you a .dlc (for jdownloader) as a reply to your mail. It's up to you."
,WooZism,2011-01-28T23:21Z,"Thanx for your hard work and dedication!

Thanx for Fairly Legal and Nikita (Took em long enough to begin re-airing the latter lolz)"
,guitarblues14,2011-01-28T23:43Z,"Thanks for the quick reply. Its quite alright if you can't do it, thanks anyways. I'm not really familiar with JDownloader (infact I just googled it to find out what you meant, sorry I'm a bit technologically challenged). You can send me the .dlc if its not too much trouble for you I'll give it a shot & see if I can make it work for me."
