This is a vehicular combat based game, just like Twisted Metal, Vigilante and Carmageddon, but obviously uses bumper car settings. It includes only 15 tracks, 9 cars and 4 weapons, but still is pretty fun nonetheless. This has singe player modes, but even those are heavily based on modern multiplayer. Multiplayer is available up to 6 players and it can be played through GameSpy.

System requirements:
Operating System - XP (I believe that it can work on lower OS, too)
Video Card - 32 MB
Ram - 128 MB
CPU - 800 GHz

Note: I\'m uploading this only because it couldn\'t be found here (at least with seeders), nor on other websites. This is NOT my rip, nor is the crack. (Although I do possess a Russian version of this game)
