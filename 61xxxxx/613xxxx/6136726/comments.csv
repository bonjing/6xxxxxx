,motley666,2011-01-29T23:41Z,Are you MrPacMan36 from you tube? This guy says he will upload it.
,St_Anger1,2011-01-30T00:43Z,"Not at all, in fact, if it matters for some reason, I'm known as StAnger1xD over there."
,motley666,2011-02-07T23:02Z,"Thanks for the game, it works fine in single player but gamespy doesn't list the game so i can't make it work. From the ingame menus, i also don't have the option to find list of servers, only enter ip address. Are you sure that online works? If so, can you give me instructions? Thanks again."
,St_Anger1,2011-02-09T13:31Z,"In-game's provided multiplayer won't work, since the master server is most likely dead and there's no-one playing in the first place. For the sake of checking it's compatibility with GameSpy, I installed newest version of it (GameSpy Arcade, if there's any difference (btw, the GameSpy that was provided in the installation is outdated)), since I don't use it, and manually selected the folder where the game's located and it worked just fine. It's hard to tell why did you have this problem, so all I can say is that you should scan for games in :/program files/bumper wars/."
,motley666,2011-02-11T13:24Z,I scanned the right folder and now the game appears on the list. Of course noone is playing but i guess some of the guys who downloaded the game will try online some time. If you want to set up a match leave me a message. Thanks for your help.
