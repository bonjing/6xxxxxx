I don't mean to be ungreatfull but according to imbd, the episode names are all messed up though."
,moviemovie002,2011-06-04T17:29Z,i believe u r missing episode2
[T],MrDowntown,2011-06-26T07:21Z,"As per the episode order - this IS the correct and logical order. HOWEVER the show was originally aired completely out of order, one of the things that led to its cancellation - people couldn't follow it. And if you read with your eyes you will see that the first episode is a double episode that also includes episode 2. 

THANKS"

,jjf3,2011-09-18T20:38Z,"I would say 10/10 for an epic series, but there appears to be some type of Chinese dubbing going on in some eps. Just a few phrases though nothing important and nothing long. I guess it was a Chinese copy at first....So for audio I have to give it a 9 "
