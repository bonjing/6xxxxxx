,bill71149,2011-02-01T17:56Z,The sample plays fine.  The film however stops after 2 seconds in VLC.  Quicktime has no problems playing this file.  The injected credit title of the film starts of as www.mysilu.com instead of the usual film title and video codec info.

,ecosaturn,2011-02-09T15:29Z,Hi..just queued the Spaghetti Western TRILOGY.Finished the first one the good the bad and the ugly..but by default its playing in spanish..if i use VLC feature i can play in english but is there a to shut off the spanish keeping in my mind i would eventually be playing it through hard drive players in my HDTV..also in media player you can here spanish n english both which is quite odd n irritating.I hope the other two r not same in the trilogy.
