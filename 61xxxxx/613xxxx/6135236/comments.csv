you're welcome. Keep my user URL --->>>  http://thepiratebay.org/user/Oceanhawk/  to check back on my new posts. I primarily try to upload PDF's that i find interesting. But i also post ""for dummies"" that i belive can be of use. I wont post EVERY ""for dummies"" book as those can be found on here very easily. I try and go after quality more than quantity. :)  
Enjoy. "
