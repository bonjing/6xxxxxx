Guitar Pro is first and foremost a program designed to edit tablatures for guitar, bass, and other fretted instruments from 4 to 8 strings.

Its great ease of use and the success of its specific file format have made it a program used by guitarists worldwide.

It now includes editing support for many other instruments like the piano or the drums, a realistic audio engine, and interactive tools to support every musician's practice.

Everything is available through esthetic cd browser (this launcher is my work).
