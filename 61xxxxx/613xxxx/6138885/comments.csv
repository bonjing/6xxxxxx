[V],HolyRoses,2011-02-03T15:53Z,"Playing molten wow right now on frostwolf realm if anyone wants to play with me.

horde - blood elf paladin.

https://www.molten-wow.com/

I used this guys iso

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4904857/

you can fetch the patches here

http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&articleId=21079

start at this patch:

3.x to 3.2.0 full patch

and then apply the remaining 10 patches.  Filefront seemed the best download site.
"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-02-03T16:16Z,"I recommend that you obtain the iso and all patches first.  When you have the iso and 11 patches then disable your internet.  Install the game and then each patch in sequence.

If you don't disable your internet it automatically starts the wow launcher after each install/patch and tries to download new stuff each time."
