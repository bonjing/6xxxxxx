what a huge task & great job you've done!
I'll seed as well, it'll take a while for all 37 files to finish. I plan on using dual layer dvds and 25GB Bluray disks to consolidate, If u want a Bluray consolidated disk LMK & i'll make ya one for all your hard work. Feel free to hammer on all my files as well."
