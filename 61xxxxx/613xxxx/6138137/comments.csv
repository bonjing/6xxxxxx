,xerberos,2011-01-30T18:55Z,"Lol! It's a chinese remake of the Coen brothers ""Blood Simple""! I got to see this! :)"
,DeadWolfBone,2011-01-30T22:51Z,Any chance of a better quality rip of this?
,srisuk,2011-01-31T00:58Z,Love these Asian movies. Thanks
,bender1110,2011-01-31T01:09Z,@deadwolf  - its already 720p - what do u want?
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-31T06:50Z,@DeadWolfBone: Fuck off.
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-31T08:28Z,@tickles39: Why?
,DeadWolfBone,2011-02-01T06:10Z,"Thanks for the ""fuck off.""

I'm just a bit skeptical of 720p @ 700mb when most 720p rips of movies of a similar length are 2-6gb.

I didn't mean any offense, and maybe you know some magical compression I don't."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-01T14:19Z,@DeadWolfBone: You're welcome.
,dark_defender,2011-02-01T19:07Z,"@DeadWolfBone: First you download this, watch and then comment on quality and see this great man for his work. Yes, SMALL SIZE yet 720p with uncompromising quality."
,biggmutt,2011-02-03T15:23Z,"Gotta get this just for the title!,,,,,Also,,,I have to agree w/dkdefender,,watch before pissn&moanin.I've only d/ld 2 of his encodes,amazing quality & resolution in a 700mb file.I usually go after the matroska BR rips,they can get too fuckin big is the downside,,a buddy told me to checkout 2040s rips,,wow,like I said,amazing! I tell my boys,""it's free,shut up & rent yer own fuckin' movies"" Woof!!"
,froglog,2011-02-03T22:25Z,Thanks for this one
,DeadWolfBone,2011-02-04T02:22Z,"Ok, so I downloaded and watched and I have to say I'm impressed. Very good quality for such a small file. Well done, 20/40.

In my defense, I coulda been asking for a 1080p rip in my original comment. But I wasn't, so I'll just say sorry and thanks!"
,kaatje77,2011-02-05T09:21Z,"very good Quality!
How dit you do it?

,Brouhahahohoheehee,2011-02-05T10:12Z,"This does look amazing, at the beginning, for a 700MB 720p encode.  However at about 21min in it starts glitching and never stops for as long as I was willing to stick with it.  I sampled it again about 29min in and it was still glitching.  Where characters should be in one scene a kind of ghost of the same shape but made of pixels from a different scene would move around.  Subtitles would be lost entirely.  Not really watchable once the problems start.  Maybe 2040 will do a PROPER, because it sure looked good up until then."
,Brouhahahohoheehee,2011-02-06T11:10Z,"Update on those glitches...  Updating to VLC 1.1.7 fixed them entirely.  (I was on 1.1.6.)  So to the extent I tested, this is a flawless, awesome quality copy.  I honestly have no clue how 20-40 is pulling this off, using standard H.264 and encoding a 720p hour and a half movie in 700MB.  Technically, it's 1216 x 544 @ 24 fps, but that is definitely close enough.  I'd love to know your secret, 20-40.  Well frigging done."
,biggmutt,2011-02-08T01:43Z,"A/10-V/10,,excellent work and the subs are perfectly in sync.Its sooo nice not having to hunt sub files down myself.Thank you 20-40,from one who hasn't the patience to encode. Itsa a whole lot of work,many try,so few can at your level.Thanks again"
,Feetback,2011-02-08T09:08Z,A/V 10 - Happy. Thank you! - twentyforty - keep eem coming! more please:)
,fakebest,2011-02-28T06:53Z,people are so dumb. why can't they believe that small hd files are possible it's just h.264 codec which has been around for years it's not that difficult and you can make it much smaller than 700mb while still being 720p
[V],lord_terabyte,2011-10-08T23:00Z,sure you can make them small but if you watch the encode on a large screen you will immediately see the massive encoding artifacts
