(It's a syskey.exe and syskey~2.exe)  Them it copies itslef in msconfig in three lines.if you delete from the task manager where it start loading itself , it shuts down the task manager and then rewrites the three lines into msconfig. I tried to to get it out of the registry but it kept copying itself over and over. I managed to get rid of it , by closing first the internet and the explorer interface. Good luck !"
