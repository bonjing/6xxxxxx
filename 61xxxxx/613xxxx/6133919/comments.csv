[T],zeromancer,2011-06-09T14:32Z,no I don't. To clear up things; most of my torrents are anonymous.

,nosing_glass,2012-02-18T00:01Z,"learn what is called hd by definition. just google it.
btw, better a so called ""low"" hd rip, yes, 720p is hd, than a ""low"" dvd rip. especially if the difference is a clearer picture (sharper, more brilliant) and saved bandwidth and free space on the hard drive. "
