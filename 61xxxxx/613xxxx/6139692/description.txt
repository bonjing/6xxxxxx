The go to resource for how to use Excel dashboards and reports to better conceptualize data is here, thanx to group DiGiBook.

Many Excel books do an adequate job of discussing the individual functions and tools that can be used to create an â€œExcel Report.â€ What they donâ€™t offer is the most effective ways to present and report data. Offering a comprehensive review of a wide array of technical and analytical concepts, Excel Reports and Dashboards helps Excel users go from reporting data with simple tables full of dull numbers, to presenting key information through the use of high-impact, meaningful reports and dashboards that will wow management both visually and substantively.

Let Mr. Spreadsheet show you how to:
Analyze extensive data and report it in a useful way
Quickly slice data into various views on the fly
Automate redundant reporting and analysis processes
Create eye-catching visualizations
Create impressive dashboards and What-If analyses

Part technical manual, part analytical guidebook, Excel Dashboards and Reports is the latest addition to the Mr. Spreadsheetâ€™s Bookshelf series and is the leading resource for learning to create dashboard reports in an easy-to-use format thatâ€™s both visually attractive and effective.
