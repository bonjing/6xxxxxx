Go to Start

now you can just rename the original one and then copy over the NEW one in here...or you could just Copy and paste over the old one...up to you.

Double click on the deadspace2.exe

Enjoy"

,fgcity,2011-02-05T23:05Z,The crack has a Keylogger attached to it's procedures. I would not recommend using it and waiting for an alternative unless you want someone to see what you are typing.
