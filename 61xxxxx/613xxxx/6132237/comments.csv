No problem. I think the whole torrent is still available but if you're still around I'll seed it again for a while just to be sure."

Was asked by my mum if I could find Butterflies for her and remember watching it as a kid, so was delighted to find someone had taken the time to create this gem of a download - Great quality as well. Fillin, you've made an old lady very happy :)
I'll continue to seed this one and series 3 and 4"
