Yes Remixes is a remix album featuring the songs of progressive rock band Yes and was released in 2003. Taking material harking back from 1970s Time and a Word to 1980s Drama, Virgil Howe (and son of Yes guitarist Steve Howe) re-imagined Yess music into a techno context, dramatically altering the bands sound. 

From the liner notes:

Then came the moment of truth: playing the Heart Of The Sunrise remix to my highly critical, all-constructive Dad. He listened intently, with a slightly bemused look on his face, until the end, when he smiled and said, You're crazy -why don't you do some more?

I have been a Yes fan for nearly 30 years and probably would have passed on this if it wasn't endorsed by Steve Howe.

Mixed with vinyl.  Interesting stuff...
