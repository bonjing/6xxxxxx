Too bad it ended.

The bad thing is that when I turned 19yo i started to smoke. Camel. 11 years pumping that shit into my lungs.

Now that Camel is not being commertialized here in BR I'm trying to stop my disease. 3 weeks and crazy for a cigar/cancer!   Oh SHIT. That shit is really addictive. damn drug. shit drug. but i don't blame Camel. They gave me an better addiction, that is 4x4. Camel(cigar) is gone for me. but 4x4 is in my veins. ty Camel, and fuck off too.

Let's make a Camel Trophy without the cigar again! That show/championship RULES!"
