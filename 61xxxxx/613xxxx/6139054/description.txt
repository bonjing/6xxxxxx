Land Rover Years

Land Rover Years combines a decade of great adventure, skillful 4WD action and stunning scenery. The Camel Trophy, the worldâ€™s greatest amateur expedition, was the original testing ground for teamwork, sportsmanship and human endurance. Teams from around the world were invited to embark on remarkable and challenging 4x4 adventures, and asked to survive using their wits, bare knuckles and the capable power of the Land Rover.

This superbly photographed production revisits the action from 1989 to 1998 â€“ the glory days of the Land Rover. During this time a range of vehicles was pushed to the limit and beyond as they tackled some of the toughest terrain on the planet. The 110, Range Rover, Discovery and Freelander all made their mark during this period as they battled arctic, tropical or torrential weather conditions.

In addition to the footage from 89 to 98, we bring you superb on-board action from Team UK in 1991, a behind-the-scenes look at team celebrations and an examination of the build of the Defender and the Freelander.
Watch this film and be struck by the physical, mental and mechanical strength that drove the teams to the finish line. Itâ€™s time to pay homage to Land Rover and celebrate the blood, sweat, tears and smiles of a truly heroic era.
