They end up being 550 mb. I know that isn't normal. Can you tell me the steps you take. or make that video you told everyone you were going to make."
[T],on.off.on,2011-01-27T19:32Z,cool to give me a minus before its even shared to anyone.. tells something about how lame the point system is lol
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-01-27T19:48Z,"OOO, if you download this program, you can record your screen to let your fans know exactly how you rip & convert your marvelous uploads...

,pinkpetal,2011-01-27T20:56Z,You're so cool. But you know that already! 
,moviez87,2011-01-28T01:49Z,"Thanks so much for the upload its a +1 from me as are all your other non TS uploads.

Just wondering if you could upload The Scorpion King (2002) and The Scorpion King 2:
Rise of a Warrior (2008) when you get the time.

Thank you."
,touchfay,2011-01-28T05:54Z,"It really isn't a hard thing to do all you have to do is download a high quality version of the movie you want open it up in handbrake set the average bitrate to 400 and the framerate to 23.976
and do a 2 pass encoding and wait the hour. not saying what on.off.on and holyroses are doing isnt awesome and wonderful. I'mjust saying its not the hardest thing to do yourself"
,edici,2011-01-28T07:03Z,"thanks a lot OOO

@touchfay - sad man...are you dumb or what? there are many people who have low speed net connection and have trouble downloading the high quality version...what OOO and holyroses do saves a lot of bandwidth and time for many people...you have never uploaded a single torrent and dont even want to thank those who do...pathetic."
,touchfay,2011-01-28T08:20Z,"hey @edici  
what i was saying in my message was meant not to be a bad comment on either of them, like i say in my message. it was directed towards people who are always asking the 2 of them how to make there movies look as good as theirs 
and i was just giving an answer cause neither of them seem to want to give away their secrets which is what makes their videos so great
so sorry if i came off as a ""sad man"" or whatever
on.off.on and holy roses are both great"
,The_Reverend230,2011-01-28T10:28Z,"@Touchfay, OOO said dont do the two-pass. And also what resolution would you say, I use. "
,banukaknight,2011-01-28T14:05Z,tnx 4 this!
,The_Reverend230,2011-01-28T15:29Z,"hey 3xo can you see this movie and tell me if its good enough? Anything you would change in it?

,vikynair,2011-01-28T20:16Z,can you please for the love of god upload faster movie starring dwayne johnson
[T],on.off.on,2011-01-28T22:54Z,somebody hates johnny depp or angelina jolie???
,SSyar,2011-01-29T10:29Z,oooo great job (Y)
,The_Reverend230,2011-01-29T13:58Z,"@on.off.on Actually after Ricky Gervais dissed this movie at the Golden Globes. People really dont like this movie. Still, -13 is a little overboard."
,defeatedsanity,2011-01-30T00:28Z,"The thing is the rating system should not be for whether the movie is good or not, it should be for the quality of the upload. "
,The_Reverend230,2011-01-31T09:41Z,"I  second that, but I'm not the one who's giving -1. It's probably some fat fuck, clicking with his dick."
,thisiscolour,2011-02-21T16:29Z,could anyone tell me how I can use the subtitles in the other file? the .m4v has no subs as far as I can tell... 
,gillygill2006,2011-03-29T10:37Z,what do u use or how do u tag your movies to show a pictre instead of an orange corn or something?  i tried to remane a JPG but that didnt work...... good job on the uploads
