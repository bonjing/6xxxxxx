,mCihhh,2012-03-21T18:43Z,"Thanks for the rip.

I'm with Audiovore, any chances of getting the other two in 720p?"
,leexiang,2012-04-13T10:38Z,"Great rip, but the reason for the low seeds is that you have to either change the STR (subtitle) name or the movie's name in order to get the subtitles work because the movie speaks Chinese (I think). They have to have a same name. Once U change one of them U can't seed any longer as U may guessed it. I want to seed but it is RED. I changed the STR name. Sad!"
,etiko,2012-04-15T21:00Z,"leexiang just copy the srt file and put with the old name. The folder will have the same files like when you download it. If you have more files inside the folder it doesn't affect nothing, you just can't have less files."
,leexiang,2012-04-19T21:26Z,"Etiko, it works just fine, I guess you made a lot of people happy. Thanks for the tip."
