,ForUniden,2011-01-30T06:07Z,"Hey man, great torrent as always. However I'm pretty certain that 19. Crave You and 6. Teenage Crime are actually remixes and not the originals. If you listen to the official YouTube videos or the countdown you'll notice that they don't have those long intros and continuing beats (I would link to them but TPB isn't letting me...). I've only checked out 6 of the 100 songs so I'll let you know if I find any others when my monthly quota isn't maxed! Otherwise great work and I hope you keep doing stuff like this for lazy listeners like myself!"
,ForUniden,2011-01-31T04:45Z,Went through all of the songs and found 4 incorrect files. They can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6139607/Triple_J_Hottest_100_of_2010_FIX

And thanks to ForUniden for the Fix - this is worth getting, but use the magnet link."
