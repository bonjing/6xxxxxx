Advanced notice gives us time to go through the stages of human emotions and ultimately each can devise the best possible plan for when the shit really hits the fan.  When the grid breaks, many will be asking questions and crying.  what will you and your family do?"
,kimjongwil,2011-01-31T04:26Z,"oo conspiracies are all around us - those ""chemtrails"" are actually normal harmless contrails. there is no mystery.

or am i an agent of the new world order - ooooo - well it is true that i only ride black helicopters and cancer was created by super intelligent monkeys and on december 21st 2012 all of the cancers in the world will combine to form one huge stay-puft cancer blob that will shit out unicorns and CIA agents who will detonate this planet's largest helium balloon which is coincidentally filled with the semen of jeebus thereby splashing 3 or 4 of the most gullible UFOlogists with holy jizzbombs. 

but seriously - wtf is up with all this wild misinformation/paranoia?

considering how unpredictable weather patterns are, and how widespread weather systems/clouds can travel are these conspiracists saying that the chemtrails are targeted at ---- ummmm -- motherfucking ---- EVERYONE????

other than the secret race of albanian molemen hidden deep within the bowels of earth's asshole i suppose. 

stay scared everyone!"
