OpenCloner Blue Cloner v2.60.0.517-CRD
a high-grade Blu-ray tool to back up Blu-ray movies to BD-R/REs or to the hard disk drive, with the same quality to the original video. With the HSTâ„¢ technology, Blue-Cloner 2 greatly improved the Blu-ray copying speed (500% faster). Just four hours, you can enjoy your copied Blu-ray movies with high quality. Blu-ray copy becomes much easier with fast copying speed and friendly-user interfaces

The blu-ray disc is AACS encrypted, pleas run a apiece of crack software first. I have Blu-ray/HD DVD Copy Helper installed as well and it is not helping. 

Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"
