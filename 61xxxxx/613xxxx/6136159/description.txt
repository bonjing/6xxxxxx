Photographs from the Edge of Reality - John Harrington.

Using images taken while on location around the world, photographer John Harrington takes you through the logistics, stories, and behind-thescenes problem solving involved in some of his assignments over the last 20 years. Examining the artistic and business sides of being a photographer, each image and story illustrates concrete solutions you can employ in your own assignments. From a sleep-deprived overnight journey to Warsaw, Poland, fraught with language barriers and demanding border guards, to a Fourth of July celebration in the company of the Mexican ambassador and Ben Vereen, John's unbelievable stories tell the tale of what happened along the way.
