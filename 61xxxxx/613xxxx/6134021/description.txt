INFO
_____________

This took me some time to compile to a good release.

First two seasons are DVDRips. The third season has (at this time of writing)
not yet been released on DVD so it's more limited in quality due to
the fact that its been ripped from a recorder.
You also have to have in mind that this tv series was filmed between 1990-1993
and therefore even the DVD material is not as sharp as todays HD TV series.

This show is a personal favorite of mine so I enjoy sharing it with you all :)




Storyline
_____________

Trendy high school student Parker Lewis, for whom, as suggested by his motto,
"Not a problem", nothing is impossible.

Like his best buds Mikey Randall and Jerry Steiner, and his girlfriend
Annie Sloane, his prime concern is achieving and maintaining coolness during
the turbulent years of puberty.

However, their efforts keep being thwarted by Parker's little sister, Shelly,
and principal Grace Musso.

Apart from various aspects of teenage life,
embedded in a wealth of cartoon-like special effects and camera trickery,
an episode regularly contains more or less subtle references to movies,
politics, and celebrities.
