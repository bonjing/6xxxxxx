Four years in the making, in kitchens, lofts and basements in Toronto's notorious Queen Street West area, Kevin Quain's epic lo-fi booze opera "Hangover Honeymoon" drags listeners through a seedy world of restless corpses, tango-mad ghosts and barroom romances. It's boozy charm and kitchen-sink production has won him fans from Yellowknife toToyko. In August 2000, The National Post selected "Hangover Honeymoon" as one of the 133 "Essential Canadian CDs" of all time.
