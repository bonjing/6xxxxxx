RELEASE NOTES

Monday Night Combat is a class-based, third-person shooter and the
most popular lethal sport of the future! It blends intense combat
finishing moves, and gameshow-like challenges and rewards to produce an
action experience unlike any other. Why fight for "honor" or "duty"
when you can fight for the real American dream: cash, fame and
endorsements?

The Blitz mode pits one player or up to four players online against
streams of AI controlled robots. In Crossfire mode, players play
competitively, six verse six, to destroy the opponent's Money Ball
while protecting theirs aided by armies of robots. Monday Night Combat
also boasts an extensive meta game that allows players to gain new
endorsements and hundreds of new ProTags to show off their
accomplishments
