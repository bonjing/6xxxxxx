If I didn't know any better I would say these have all the tell tell signs of being re-encodes.

a conversion of a conversion for example Xvid to x264, or maybe DVDRip to (a), then another conversion from (a) to (b).

either way, definitely not good encodes when taking into account there large file size, and source supposedly being DVD....

if your looking for HQ DVDRip's of this show, DON'T get these."
