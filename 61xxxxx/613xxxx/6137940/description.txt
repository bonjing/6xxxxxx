IF you already have some encodes (or UNFINISHED dowload) from my TV packs, put them in ONE folder, together - and when you start this torrent, as download location choose that folder, torrent-program would recognize presence of files you already have, Recheck would be done - and you'll download JUST the files you don't have.
For better, you would make seeding easier.

Same tactic could be applied in all cases of Packs of ANY kind. 
Click on "Files" tab (lower part of uTorrent program-window) - right-click 
on file you don't need - choose "Don't download". 
(uTorrent would show "Skipped").
Other torrent-programs offer very similar step.

*** 2-pass encoding for PC, PS3 or Xbox . ***
*** Video is H264; audio is AAC LC and container is MP4. ***
