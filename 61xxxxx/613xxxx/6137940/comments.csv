,TsarB0mba,2012-04-03T10:24Z,"3 hours max? Might as well just leech it outright. I'll seed it until the internet stops me from doing so, assuming I can get it all."

Great video quality for its size. One problem though is the audio. all though not frequent and not on every scene,you can notice the problem during explosions or anything that should make a ""thud"" sound. the problem is that the volume on these explosions are way too soft, sometimes almost no sounds at all. 
Now, I don't know if it's on my end so if anyone can correct me please go ahead. "
