Autodesk Maya 2011 software features powerful new tools for helping create
and repurpose character animation: enhanced skinning capabilities and non-
destructive live motion retargeting. Its new 3D Editorial timeline helps accelerate
pre-visualization and virtual movie-making workflows, while an invigorated user
interface helps improve artistsÃ¢Â€Â™ efficiency and creativity. Maya 2011 addresses
todayÃ¢Â€Â™s demanding production requirements with its high-performance viewport
display of large scenes, integrated color management, scene segmentation,
improved rotoscoping, and new UI toolkit. With support for 64-bit as Windows 
operating systems, Maya is now more accessible than ever, offering artists 
an end-to-end creative workflow at exceptional value.
