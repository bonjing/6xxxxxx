 (Uninstall network adapter before install)"
,santallum,2011-02-10T13:04Z,"I'm having problems installing this
I have followed the instructions to the letter
a few times (fully uninstalling the previous attempt each time)
But Im only getting the version that onlt allows
me to convert the first 3 mins of any file
and even then it would let me guess the user name and pass word
Should I try an earlier verion ?
Is this (another) windows vista issue ?
Can anyone help please ?
Cheers
Ade"
