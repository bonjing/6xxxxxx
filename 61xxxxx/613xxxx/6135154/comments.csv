Also, whatever ever happened to proper spelling and sentence structure.  I suppose some pirates can be an uneducated bunch, gianijoker007 namely.  I was compeled to make that comment.  I partly agree with what gianijoker007 says,but if the writing had been better… well, then I and many other people would take the message more seriously."
