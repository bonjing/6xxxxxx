,Receptionist,2011-12-28T10:32Z,"This torrent is being tracked. I got a letter from Charter because NBC sent an infringement notice. I have only gotten two out of my entire torrent life so I tend to believe them. Last time I got one was for a Harry Potter Deathly Hallows torrent. 

TLDR. Fyi. Tracked Torrent."
,Receptionist,2011-12-28T10:34Z,This is however a great torrent. Great audio with great video. I use K-Lite with TVersity on my PS3. Thanks RajMahal.
