You have uploaded all of them to the wrong category.
They properly belong in TV shows."
[V],ua3,2011-02-02T06:38Z,Your torrent's have been redirected to Video>TV Shows. 720x400 is not 720p 1280x720 is called 720p and they are in Hires TV Shows category. Take care of these thing in future.

@ua3, yeah thanks, I know. For some reason when I had been adding them under ""Video>TV Shows"" they just got changed to the High-Res section. It seemed to happen automatically every time, so I eventually just gave up and put them in High-Res by default. I'll go back to putting them under the regular one from now on. :)

Just FYI, I put my latest one where it should be, so if it changes...I didn't do it! lol :D

Cheers!"
