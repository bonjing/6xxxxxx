PLOT
A suspense-filled glimpse into the dark corridors of political 
power, 'Fair Game' is a riveting action-thriller based on the autobiography of 
real-life undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts), whose career 
was destroyed and marriage strained to its limits when her covert 
identity was exposed by a politically motivated press leak.

As a covert officer in the CIA's Counter-Proliferation Division, 
Valerie leads an investigation into the existence of weapons of mass 
destruction in Iraq. Valerie's husband, diplomat Joe Wilson (Sean Penn), is drawn 
into the investigation to substantiate an alleged sale of enriched uranium 
from Niger. But when the administration ignores his findings and uses 
the issue to support the call to war, Joe writes a New York Times editorial 
outlining his conclusions and ignites a firestorm of controversy.
