Kim Carnes - Voyeur [Musikladen 1982].VOB



HQ very rare "Musikladen" tv show promo performance. "Der Musikladen" (German: the music shop) was a West German music television program that ran from December 13, 1972 to November 29, 1984. The show continued the 1960s Beat-Club under a new name, and in turn was replaced by Extratour.

A normal episode of Musikladen usually featured several live performances by guest musicians, and ran around 45 minutes. Some episodes were longer, and a few were shorter. In the 1980s, music videos were shown along with live performances.

"Voyeur" is a 1982 single release from Kim Carnes's album Voyeur. The album spawned two singles, "Voyeur" and "Does It Make You Remember", which peaked at #29 and #36 on Billboard magazine's pop singles chart, respectively. "Say You Don't Know Me" was released as a promo single in Canada, with no charting effect. In Continental Europe and Scandinavia "Undertow" was released as the follow-up to "Voyeur" and in the UK instead "Take It on the Chin", both of which met with limited success.

This single reached #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts and #52 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. The song also achieved some international chart success too but failed to live up to record company expectations, particularly after the phenomenal success of "Bette Davis Eyes" a year earlier.

In 1983, Carnes was nominated for a Best Pop Rock Performance (Female) Grammy Award for "Voyeur".
