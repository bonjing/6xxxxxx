Thnx in adv!!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-27T20:46Z,"@mnbbv: Well... when the rights (license) for HellGirl seasons 2 and 3 have been sold, specified was only right to produce Japanese audio - no dub.

That what you have watched on Animax Asia is probably their own dub, of Animax, and if no one have captured that specific airing, chance to get English dubbed version are slim to none.

However - even if that one is available - it would be encoded by me only in original language (in case of Dual audio) and eventually subs would be provided. Sorry, that's my policy."
,Djalma,2011-01-27T20:55Z,"Thank you.
It appears that the original from 1978 wil be released in Blu-ray in February, is there any chance you will encode it?
Thanks again."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-27T21:21Z,"@Djalma: Someone in my shoes can't promise a thing regarding February. Best answer I can give is - probably not. It would be too early to encode a remake - and both movies are not the epic ones, right?"
,killeurkilleur,2011-01-27T22:41Z,that actress makes Kristen Stewart look like freakin Meryl Streep...loool...;-)
,Djalma,2011-01-28T03:14Z,"@ twentyforty
Your reasoning is irrefutable.
Thank you for your reply."
