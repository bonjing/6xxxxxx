,abbeluna,2011-01-28T21:43Z,thx man
,gtxSeries,2011-01-29T15:53Z,You're both welcome! :-)
,abbeluna,2011-01-31T08:15Z,"R E 1 is working just fine, but I cant get no sound. How can I fix that?"
,gtxSeries,2011-01-31T08:53Z,"Now that, I don't know, as I've never faced that problem before. Did you try running it in Win95 compatibility mode? That's about the only thing I can think about."
,jbt11,2011-02-01T02:21Z,"It keeps giving me the error ""Some of the Data has been damaged. Please run the setup again"" for Resident Evil 1"
,dadstyle,2011-02-01T07:11Z,"thanks a lot gtxSeries. Resident Evil really brings me back.... 1 and 2 work great. but i was hoping someone coulde help me with the third. it will play the opening scene for nemesis, but then crashes before the menu. if someone, has had the problem and solved it let me know. or if you have an idea as to why, that would be helpful too! thanks again! "
,gtxSeries,2011-02-01T09:54Z,"I really can only think about compatibility modes...
I've been testing all games and their installations a lot and came to the conclusion I found most of the errors - which seems to be wrong. 

For jbt1:
There are two executables for RE1 found in the installation folder, try the other one. One of the two should work.

For dadstyle: I've never had that problem with RE3, so I can only think about this: Press F2 to open the game settings and play around a little with ""Texture Completion"", ""Texture Correction"", and you might also want to try disabling movies. (yes, that has a bad taste for sure, but if it helps...) Maybe enabling ""Voodoo2"" may even help, as a last resort, I can't think of anything else."
,jbt11,2011-02-01T18:23Z,"I tried both in there, one says that the data is damaged, the other says that it requires Windows 95"
,gtxSeries,2011-02-01T22:58Z,"The Win95 stuff can SURELY helped with Win95 Compatibility Mode, try it that way."
,jbt11,2011-02-01T23:17Z,"Ok I ran it in 95 Compatibility mode, its giving me the Data Damage error for that one too"
,gtxSeries,2011-02-02T10:21Z,"Then honestly, I'm out of ideas. It works for me, I used the same installer I made. Back a little while ago I also had the problem while testing, but it wasn't because the game was actually corrupted... I'll try and figure it out when I'm done with my work."
,gtxSeries,2011-02-02T14:59Z,"What I found out so far:

As you may know, the installer makes a shortcut on the desktop for 'resident.exe'. Using this with Win95 compatibility mode seems to work just fine for me. Using 'ResidentEvil.exe' with Win95 mode seems to reproduce the mentioned error.
Using 'resident.exe' without Win95 stops the application for me with a 'The Application has topped working...' error.

HOWEVER! This not always seems to be the case and all the errors seem completely operating system specific for me. I remember, that under Vista x64 I used the 'ResidentEvil.exe' way back...
It leaves you to find out how it works for you by Trial & Error. I'm sorry I can't help any more, but I can't seem to really reproduce the problem."
,jbt11,2011-02-02T19:14Z,"Okay, I got it working finally XD, But now i'm stuck on how to download a Cinepak Codec, What should I use to run the .dll file?"
,gtxSeries,2011-02-02T23:06Z,"If you downloaded this:
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Cinepak_Codec.htm

Then there should be an inf file in the same directory. Right click that and select Install.
That should work."
,jbt11,2011-02-03T00:15Z,"Sorry I keep responding with all my problems XD, but when I right click and go to install, it prompts me to give permission, after I give it permission, it doesnt do anything"
,gtxSeries,2011-02-03T10:53Z,"I guess you're under Vista/7?

If so, the only way I can think of is that you disable User Account Control, just until you install what you want. Then you can re-enable it. You can do so by Pressing [WinKey]+[R] and entering ""msconfig"" there, without the quotes.
There at the ""Tools"" tab, if I remember correctly, you can disable / enable it. (something about UAC)
Install the codec (you propably won't get a 'done' message), then re-enable if you wish - since there's no 'Run INF as Administrator' option, this seems to be the best way."
,gtxSeries,2011-02-03T10:55Z,"By the way: Maybe it DID it actually, but was so fast, that you didn't notice. Usually a command promts just pops up for a moment and it's done, it's installed. (after all we're talking about a single file here).
Did you try the game since then? :D"
,jbt11,2011-02-03T21:53Z,"Well it works fine, it just wont play the videos lol it goes right to the ""They have entered the mansion"""
,VDmaf,2011-02-03T22:30Z,"Hey guys. This is the easy way to solve your LOAD/SAVE issue. 

1. Install the game using Deamon, or just extarct it to any folder all 3 games and do it from there.
2. After Install got C:\ Disk and creat a new folder called RESIDENTEVIL2 so it look like this C:\RESIDENTEVIL2. ( no space between 2 words)
3. Go to C:\ Disk, Program Files, Capcom, Resident Evil 2, (where u install ur game).
4. Click on the ResidentEvil2 ( Looks like lizard eye) it will open AUTORUN.exe 
5.  Click on SAVE GAME FOLDER , if it says error or somethink, it's ok, just wait a little and dont close it until u see it a new window pop up.
6. In that window u have to choose where u have to save ur game so select that folder we created in C:\ Disk ( C:\ResidentEvil2 ) 
7. Run the game in win 95 mode ( Right click on Leaon short cut - Properties - Compatibility. 
8. Then same Lean icon duble click to play.

THIS SHOULD WORK I GUARANTEE !!!
PS You can transport your old save's to the new Save folder and delet the old ""save"" folder or dont, but it should work anyway but just to be sure if it dont. FACEBOOK: Jay Bel"
,VDmaf,2011-02-03T22:47Z,"I also got NO-CD Patch that I got from http://www.gamecopyworld.com/  and it's called Resident Evil 2 v1.0 [US/UK] No-CD Patch. So if save still wont work get this patch and put it in where u install ur game and run the patch. 

To change for better resolution change in game change your screen resolution to 1024x768 ( that's my one when I play). In game u an press F7 or F8 to change the size of the screen. F9 to Exit Menu + F9 Exit to Desktop. 
I hope this helps coz I know how people feel when they want to play so bad but they cant :)) Later ."
,gtxSeries,2011-02-03T23:35Z,"Hi VDMaf!

In this pack you don't need a no-cd crack for any of these, neither of them requires a CD.
And also, Resident Evil 2 includes the 1.04 patch, so using 1.0 binaries would be a bad choice.

Also, as far as I know, the game won't run in any resolution higher than 640x480..."
,KaitoTano,2011-02-04T16:51Z,when i try that resident evil 2 patch that is included it cannot find the movie files and closes just after the intro screen (this game contains scenes of gore)
,VDmaf,2011-02-04T22:09Z,"Hey gtxSeries:)
Yea i know u dont need NO CD patch, but when i click on leaon exe it says ""error no cd, click ok"" or somethink, so u have to press it like 5 times until u can play with pact it run straight away. Thats why im saying it, u dont have to get it:)

Yea res is a bit low, but u can make it ""fullscreen"" with F8. by the way, when i play Clair the graphics seems better, her body too looks better then leon's. Is that the same with u?"
,gtxSeries,2011-02-05T09:28Z,"If you press F8, you'll see that there are two modes that run in 640x480. One is native 640x480 rendering which looks good of course, the other is rendered to 320x240 and then stretched to 640x480 and looks damn ugly. It writes it in the top-left corner when you switch.

By the way, that no-cd error appears only to me, when there's a disc in the drive. Otherwise it starts smooth and quiet.

KaitoTano:
I don't get exactly what are you talking about...
There are no plus patches included with the game, only RE2 has 1.04 patch pre-installed."
,trh2086,2011-02-06T03:12Z,"I know what KaitoTano is talking about. I get the disclaimer at startup but then the game crashes with this error: ""Unable to find file E:\regist\pl1\zmovie\titlece.bin"" This only happens when you try to play the game by clicking ClaireU.exe or LeonU.exe but start by clicking ResidentEvil2.exe and then clicking play game it works but it will be windowed and you play as Leon without the option to play Claire."
,shikhar,2011-02-06T06:51Z,"het gtxseries cn u give step by step instructions,coz i am new to this torrent thing with games.I wanna play these games very badly ...plz"
,gtxSeries,2011-02-06T11:19Z,"Hey shikhar!

I usually don't do this, but since anyone else can read it, it may be useful.
I won't write down how to properly burn ISO images, google it if you need that.
You'll need to download Daemon Tools Lite (if you don't already have it).
It can be found here:
http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon

Be careful when installing! It asks you if you want to install XYZ toolbar, set the homepage, etc, you propably don't need that stuff...
Now since you're installing Lite, just skip the part where it asks for a serial, you don't need itl.

When you've installed it and started the program, look at the system tray (by default at the lower right corner, next to the clock).
There'll be a Daemon Tools icon. Click it and select Device 1 : [Empty] - or somethin' like that - and browse to the directory where you've downloaded this torrent to. Select the ISO image. It will be mounted to a virtual CD/DVD/BD-ROM drive which you can find in My Computer. Open the drive and you'll find all three folders of Resident Evil 1, 2 and 3. Enter each of them and install them using SETUP.EXE in any order you want. You should be able to do the rest by yourself. (if not, GTFO)

If you have any more questions about this release and it wasn't covered in the FAQ or the posts below, I'll try and answer it, but I won't help you with trivial stuff like ""How do I download through bittorrent?""...
Google is your friend otherwise."

How did you fix the problem of receiving the error message ""damaged data""? I am having the same problem"
,alexbenner14,2011-02-12T20:46Z,Hey guys and girls. I am having the same problem as above. Data damaged or whatever its called. I run a windows 7 64 bit system. Any help would be great. thanks
,gtxSeries,2011-02-12T23:11Z,"Actually I don't have a clear solution for resident evil 1's problem. I happened to me too, but then the problem just solved itself and the game started somehow. I don't really remember what I did. And this thing is annoying, because it actually works, just I don't know how.
Annoying, isn't it?!"
,ladyj405,2011-02-13T02:22Z,I am not sure why but the message of damaged data no longer appears. I set everything the way it was suggested and when I turned my computer on the game started to work.
,togetherrising,2011-02-13T02:32Z,I had the damaged data error msg when trying to load RE1 but then I went into the start menu programs and selected the Resident Evil Video Setup and after that it worked for me? Hope that helps anyone!
,togetherrising,2011-02-13T02:45Z,"RE1 plays at about double speed for me tho, even when running in windows 95 compatibility mode, has anyone else had/fixed this issue?"
,gtxSeries,2011-02-13T10:03Z,"I mentioned that in the FAQ as well. There's no clear solution for that as far as I know...
I read somewhere that modern processors are too fast for Resident Evil 1 and that CpuKiller might help.
Check it out: http://www.cpukiller.com/
I didn't try it yet thou, gonna test it however."
,gtxSeries,2011-02-13T10:26Z,"Update: I personally had no luck with CpuKiller, but I guess it's worth a try.
I tried different settings but setting it too low did have no effect, setting it too high had made the game unplayable-it was like skipping too many frames."
,gtxSeries,2011-02-13T10:38Z,"Update #2:
I've been running a little testing just now...
Using the Video Setup in the Start Menu, I tried the following settings:
Matrox Mystique - The game was running at normal speed, but had graphical glitches.
Non-accelerated (Video Memory) - At 640x480 resolution, the game was shitty slow for me, however after pressing F8 a few times (in-game), I came to the setting, where the Screen Resolution is 640x480, but the game is only 320x240 in resolution. This was playing with perfect speed. However, since this is actually rendered by the CPU, the models did look damn ugly - The backgrounds ware fine however.
Well experiment yourselves if you wish.

Oh by the way: I also tried the 3dfx setting, but the game did hang up. I had to call for the Task Manager, but the screen was still left blank, so I pressed Winkey+R and typed ""tskill resident"" without the quotes.
Also, if you wish to run the game in non-accelerated mode, you gotta switch the screen color depth to 16-bit.

Hope this helps..."
,gtxSeries,2011-03-03T23:03Z,"Hey guys! I seem to have found the solution for the ""corrupted game data"" with resident evil 1!
Just before launching the game, set the color mode of windows to 16-bit - it should start properly now!

Confirmed to work on Windows 7 x64"

and i made an account to ask for help getting RE1 to work.  i can only run the game in unaccelerated mode and that is painfully slow.  

when i try the other video modes from videosetup.exe the movies work fine but the menu and the actual game play are all wonky:  it looks like the screen is divided into 4 triangles (top forth, bottom fourth, right fourth, and left fourth), 2 of them are black and the other 2 just act bizarre (i can show you a screenshot if it would help).

the game runs in compatibility 95 mode, i have tried all 8 options from videosetup.exe, tried to force 256 colors, tried to force 640x480, and all other check-boxes in compatibility mode tab.

What do you mean how? Like on all the other RE games: grab an [Ink Ribbon] from somewhere (usually next to a Typewriter), then find a typewriter and you can save there. On Easy mode, you start off with an infinite amount of ribbons found in the Item Box."
,gtxSeries,2012-04-30T05:08Z,"@ MiniStop:

The videos in RE2 (and the other games too) work! I suspect you either didn't install the Indeo codec, or do have some codec pack installed. It is known to me, that ffdshow (including K-Lite Codec Pack) and Haali Splitter cause the videos not to show. Either disable those in RE2 somehow, or get rid of them.
If you just lack the codec necessary, then grab this: http://www.free-codecs.com/indeo_codec_download.htm"
