[About this release...]
Surely, all three episodes of this series can be easily
found on the net, however due to the fact, that these
games ware designed to be run on older systems (Win95?),
it can be really difficult to install, configure and play
them on modern systems, like Windows XP, Vista or Seven.
This is especially true about Resident Evil 2 - if you
want to install it without having to use the game discs,
you have to dig into the registry, copy a lot of files
from X subdirectory to y and so on... it can be pretty
confusing for someone, who doesn't know these things.

...and so I have created this release, including
all three games, repacked into modern installers made
with Inno Setup Compiler. You just install the game and
play it. That's it. No patching, no cracking and nothing
is needed, just install and have fun. Now, this would
sure be very nice to be just like that, HOWEVER there
can be a few minor problems, mentioned down below...


[FAQ]
Q1. Why did you create this collection?

A1. All three episodes of Resident Evil have been
	written to be run on Win95/98 and can be pretty
	hard to install & configre on modern systems.
	
	
Q2. Resident Evil 1 crashes when playing Jill
	at the part, where the first zombie comes
	into the dining room.
	
A2. This is a common issue. The solution is that
	you have to run back to the main hall twice,
	instead of entering the hallway the first
	zombie is in. Other than this, the game is not
	supposed to crash at any other part.
	

Q3. Resident Evil 1 is too fast.

A3. This is also a common issue. Nothing easy done
	can be done about this. Live with it, or not.
	
	
Q4. Resident EVil 1's backgrounds are not displayed
	properly.
	
A4. This game was designed to be ran on specific video
	cards. This should however not be an issue: run
	Start/RESIDENT EVIL Collection/Resident Evil
	Video Setup and select another card. I for example
	have a GeForce4 MX440 SE 64MB video card and
	selecting a "Rendition" card works for me.
	
Q5. Resident Evil 1's videos don't play.

A5. Install a Cinepack codec, but you should be able
	to play it by default.
	
Q6. Resident Evil 2's videos don't play.

A6. Same as above, except this time you need the Indeo
	video codec. This is included with Resident Evil 2's
	installer. At the end of the installation, you are
	prompted to install it - do so. If you still can't
	play it, you propably have K-Lite or another
	codec pack installed and that is the cause.
	
Q7. Resident Evil 2's backgrounds are not displayed
	correctly. 
	
A7.	This problem is similiar to the
	one mentioned in RE1's case - in the installer,
	I set the defaults to a setting that should work
	with most modern video cards - Rage Pro 3D.
	However if that doesn't work for you, go to
	Start/RESIDENT EVIL Collection/Resident Evil 2 Setup
	and select Options. Here you can try other settings.
	
Q8. Saving/loading in Resident Evil 2 don't work.

A8. Another common issue, but this can be solved.
	I made a little BAT file for this issue.
	Run it and follow the instructions.
	Enter the path:
	"C:\Program Files\Resident EVil 2 save"
	on 32-bit or
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Resident EVil 2 save"
	on 64-bit for example.
	This will create the folder as well modify the
	registry.
	
ENJOY!

Note: I inclued the *.iss files, so everyone can see
	  that there's no shit included in the installers.
	  Consider it open source. :)
