Game information:

Dungeons follows the mis-adventures of the foremost of all Dungeon Lords
who spends his time luring heroes into his labyrinthine creations with the
promise of treasure and a good fight -- only to be trapped by his ingenious
devices. Once they are in his grasp, our Dungeon Lord must look after and
cherish his new found prisoners until they are more comfortable with their
surroundings because come the "harvest", happy heroes have more precious
soul energy for you to gleefully extract via foul prisons or twisted
torture chambers!

In Dungeons, our protagonist falls victim to a devious plot hatched by his
vile, nasty and thoroughly vicious ex-girlfriend and finds himself at the
bottom of the underworld hierarchy and the top of the dungeon pile which in
this world is about as bad as it can get

Our Lord must have his revenge, and make his way back down the dungeon
levels to his rightful place - but first he must deal with his new bosses
the three despicable Dungeon Lords who stand in his way
Revenge will be sweet indeed
