Won't even open. Not even an AVI file. I'm calling out all of you bullshit trash torrents mother fuckers."

The torrent both works and is brilliant, as well as being a working avi. A and V 9/10 even though it's under a gig. Good flick too. Thanks heaps for the upload. "
,11western,2011-02-16T06:04Z,"ok then , but I've got a question. @ 79% I try to play it to see how it starts ( I respect the sckull and bones) and the timer says 20+ hrs and even skipping through it the screen is black (kindof) so what gives?
I'm not a neub and have done this hundreds of times meaning good codec's and all that shit. Is this not working on vlc? "
,11western,2011-02-16T06:33Z,"MY BAD!!! I waited till it was finished d/l'ing and tried again.
GREAT COPY!!! Thanks MEGAPLAY
Kind of weird though...that never happened before so tripped me out a little."
