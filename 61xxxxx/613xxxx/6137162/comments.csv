Cheers to all of you ..."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-30T00:02Z,Quick note : don´t forget to enable the subtitles on the options inside the game menu .
[V],globeplus,2011-01-30T00:21Z,"MORE INFO : i removed a couple of Dat files that was supposed to be for some languages , unfornatly with a better observation this file like it is can be called a real RIP , why ? because the subtitles or audio on some videos not working , one of the dat files that is big in size had the english audio for videos too , to play is ok but audio on the videos or subtitles not existant on the game , i am asking to myself , reupload or try to do an extra file by links for the videos audio and subtitles and by the way this extra files have german , italian and spanish too included .

Sorry folks ! This is a real RIP , i will analise what can i do with the missing files but i need sometime , thank you for understand this little equivoc but the intention was with the supression of a few languages get a real nice size for everyone but unfornatly the videos audio and the subtitles was included too on them , i will see now what can i do about that and i tell something later , keep in touch with this comments for more information .

[V],globeplus,2011-01-30T00:38Z,"Unfornatly because it is audio the compression sucks and the size of the file is really close 2 gb with a shit compression not to much less than that , so inadvertdly i probably did the right thing , my advice is go to YOUTUBE and watch walkthrough videos with complete chapters beeing played then you listen the audio and watch how to play , sorry guys , it wasn´t with intention but all the gameplay still available looks like that and working good ."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-30T01:04Z,"To Jridic : i take the opportunity to say what happen : after more than an year with the forum they putted the forum under contestation with a full list of possible motives without specification , what i mean is the correct procedure respecting a long time user of a forum is to send amessage in private giving some time to correct some post or post under contestation or removing hem informing the administartor telling why , in any of this cases the forum still going with normality and certainly i can write posts or making an important notice  talking about one or another incorrect post and the consequences and certainly advising for procediures like that but after more than an year with normal posts not borring anyone and collecting more than 120 possible participants it was offensive and incorrect putting a forum without a specific motive under contestation without contactating first the administartor , so my friend , because this in my opinion incorrect behaviour with the administrator i decided not to contestate and let the message keep in there to the possible users have a feeling what can happen to them if they open a forum on tha site on a shiny day . Go to my blog or here , i donÂ´t have to much time now , this days to make files or forums , i need to get and keep a job really soon or i get in trouble but my sharing hobby now it depends on the few available time that i can get if i get the work , the true is that everybody needs a job to pay the bills and i am not an exception .

you are so annoying!!!
  its not a full rip if you screwed up all the cut-scenes and have no audio for the game moron!!!!!

your videos are so compressed and sized down they look like shit when they do work.!

here is an ideal, the game in english for multi with all other language taken out is only 
10 gigs, you mean to tell me you can""t high compress 10 gigs to 6gigs?

To soldierofthelam : the type of videos on this game is avi vp6 from EA not the most convencional bik videos , i leave it intact all of them , only worked 1 without audio because the converter didnÂ´t include him and removed only a couple of logos that doesnÂ´t matter , so absolute correct and clean work about the videos and watch your language , you donÂ´t even know how it is the videos and started to criticisize

this size is good, but u can take ur time.. i believe with this size, ur release still could be perfect. just take ur time to know more about the files (like which files to make this english only) and perhaps wait for new crackfix (if u havent put it yet).. and video works, i like ur video works actually, small size with decent quality. if im not wrong u use sorenson right? well thats it i'll wait for the better rips from u."

moron!!!
you don't need to compress the game so far down to a low gig, compressing the movies to a small size to the point of a shitty cam video is retarded!!!
a 10 gig game file easily can compress to 6.7 gig or even lower if done right! 
 so wasting peopling time on a game without sound on a video or even a decent video to play the game for the game to make since and enjoyable is a waste of time and download.

[V],globeplus,2011-01-30T15:43Z,"AMAZING NEWS : after lot of research i am starting to get the first indicies of the possibility of a mirror file that it will be the first file presented like this AND NOW ALL OF YOU ASK ME : WHAT YOU MEAN WITH A MIRROR FILE ?

A mirror file is a worked file that have all the conteud of the main file , in this case the DAT0 that have the subtitles and the videos audio with much less size , my first experiences indicates for subtitles and audio on videos fully working on the first chapter , now the only doubt is , this can happen in all the game beside the fact that it is a mirror file ? That can be the answer that the users can answer .

NOW , HOW IT IS THE MIRROR FILE AND WHAT TO DO ?

This mirror file is compressed in a very common winrar file then the user move the rar file inside the game folder and proceed with the extration a DAT0 file will be now available inside the folder and at the next time the user launch the game the subtitles and the videos audio inside the game will work with normality .

NOW , LET`S TRY THIS MIRROR FILE ?

Soon , a link with this file will be available here or at my blog , final question :

SIZE OF THIS MIRROR FILE KNOWING THAT THE ORIGINAL FILE MIRRORED IS 1.99 GB ?

answer : 91.5 MB in RAR FILE TYPE .

soon available ... Thank you ."

that comment was a typo and wasn't aimed at you but if you want to bash people lets get the facts straight. 
Globe doesn't buy the game, but takes other people rips and converts them down,
furthermore there no reason to compress down the video so far a small size that they are horrible.
if your going to rant on someone get your facts straight@@
10 gb can be converted down to 6.7 without tearing up the audio or video,
6.9 gb  can be converted down to 4gb to 4.5 just using 7zip. so ounce again you dumb twat there no reason to destroy some game files on high compression and a shitty video experience while playing the game!!!!"

your right except one part.
its compressed down, not converted down.
the 15 gb game of the DS2 multi version with other languages taken out and video except english can be 10gb compressed down with peazip is easily 7.3 gb without high compression and still retaining video and sound qaulity. now if you broke it down from 7.3 compression and made two solid 3.1 file compressed download time is about the same and still able to enjoy the videos."

come on dude..

hey dude, u rant someone first for something he (me) doesn't care of. and for me smaller is better, and u know nothing about sorenson encoder, it could encode videos to small size with decent quality. so i think why not? i wont force you to like it, but ""moron"" at me? its up to me what to like dude!
and btw dumbass, 10gb can be converted down to 5 gb. i have 3 different version of dead space 2 repack about 4.8gigs without video decompressing with final size about 9-10gb. so i know everything but i believe rip could be smaller then why not i asked globe. so you dumbass i know what im doing.
""so ounce again you dumb twat there no reason to destroy some game files on high compression and a shitty video experience while playing the game!!!!""
hardcore level of stupidness. once again you dumb i never ask or force you to like it and download those kind of rips and never force the world or globe to make those kind of rips, more like you forced me to like it. like u feel threatened by my suggestion and mad at me with badwords like ur life been ruined.

""steals other peoples torrents and redistributes them to a smaller horrible size."" = rips? gosh am i too nice or what have to explain someone who don't understand what rip is in tpb. even ""steals"" is not the proper word to say it. and with your second comment i really wonder how old are you son.. lol.."

You are too funny

bLusiLv is oblivious to any understanding of logic.

what a moron! 
his dumb azz is still writing anger comments, so funny.
and he using that weak azz out of date sorenson encoder. too gdamn funny.


BTW soldier,
 are you still on creativeX.net i need some help with some win7 mods. i luv TheBull and MrGrimm new themes. are you all planning to remap the whole start menu theme still?"
,Prometeia,2011-02-19T10:33Z,"Shoobox and soldierofthelam where are your rips of games and movies and so on?

I like globeplus rips of games because they are soo tiny for me to download and they all work :)

So stop writing comments at globeplus torrents please."
,Shoobox,2011-02-19T14:38Z,"@Prometeia 
don't comment if you can't read.
i do not have uploads of games and movies
only Soldier does and you have to get an invite to be able to download on a private tracker. 
think before typing.

and the whole point of commenting on Globe is that  yes his file size may be small but his videos are lacking or not even there half the time. and also the fact that they are so horribly pixelated that you cannot enjoy the video wich some games need for the play!!

second as stated before you can retain all the game with 10gb compressed down to 7 or break it into halves then compress it down even further to 4gb for easy download.

when people try to give globe a comment without the intention of bashing but good negative reinforcement all globe does is cry and bash people so i say again think before you comment.
move along troll!!!"
,bLusiLv,2011-02-19T18:44Z,"@Prometeia
juz ignore them, i realized i was wrong bcz i wasted my time for replying those zero brain 12-13 year-old emo gay brothers. lol..
bcz they act like grown up but they cant with those ""stay cool but angry inside bcz unintentionally showed lot exclamations"" comments, those ridiculous lies such ""im a ripper with lot video compression knowledge"" thingy and unexsists creativex.net.
believe me, theyre just another gamer'only' boys which mission is to bash globe. nothing else. =)"

you are so funny,
although i am an American too, I won't hold you comment personally: we USA people are arrogant thinking we know everything!

I find bLusiLv  so amusing especially after smacking him in the face after calling you a liar with CreativeX,net too bad he can't show his work to back up any of his claims of knowledge.!!!

oh yea for the record bLusiLv, shoobox is right again, you need my invite to download my material which you my friend will never get now.
so keep downloading a ""redistributed"" not ripped hacked up version of the games from globe!!!"
,SergioKool,2011-02-26T16:35Z,about this rip is to incomplete is playable with to much audio missing and all audio files missing the job could be better if globe dont remove the DAT 1 and 0 files :S still the dat 1 files is where the audio files are and some subtitles too :S
,martiniuo,2011-02-28T18:30Z,"awesome, i've been waiting for this game
thx globe!!!!!!"
,chirssayscool,2011-03-02T04:47Z,no sound
,HriEng,2011-03-03T09:07Z,"@Globe:
First of all thank u very much for ripping this game.
A really nice work.I have have just completed playing the game.
No problem in game play what so ever.
But in some parts (although scarce) there was no audio , no subtitle.I was a little disheartened with this.
But the considering the size of the original game with this ripped version, this flaws can easily be overlooked.
Thank u once again Globe.
One question : Will Assassin's Creed-Brotherhood be ultimately launched in PC????  
If yes....when?????"
,aarJunn,2011-03-22T14:10Z,"Install iNFo:
1. d/l this torrent.
2. Extract the .rar to any desired location to get a folder called Dead Space 2 with an icon.
2. d/l the mirror file (.rar file) as per link provided by globeplus. Inside it you'll find this DS2DAT0.DAT. Copy it over to the extracted Dead Space 2 folder.
3. Now, d/l the crack as mentioned by globe plus. And copy over the content-deadspace2.exe in it to the Dead Space 2 folder.
NOTE: Delete DS2.exe in the Dead Space 2 folder.
4. Start with deadspace2.exe."
