* Gameplay * 

Dead Space 2 is a survival horror third-person shooter. The player controls Isaac 
Clarke from a third-person point of view, looking over the character's right shoulder. 
The game features no HUD elements, relying on holograms projected from the player 
character and his weapons to show information such as messages and ammunition 
count, respectively. Player health and stasis is shown by a visual indicator located on Isaac's back. Isaac must fight an alien organism that infects and takes control of humans, turning them into "Necromorphs", killing them and mutating their bodies. 
Necromorphs must be dismembered as the alien organism controls host bodies via tentacles extending into their limbs. Other, larger types of Necromorphs that cannot be dismembered will often have yellow, glowing pustules, indicating weak spots.
 The player may upgrade their weapons and armor at work benches, using nodes 
found throughout the game. In-game stores may be accessed where the player may buy and sell various items and attain new weapons and suits. The player encounters zero-G environments, which Isaac is capable of maneuvering 
with thrusters thrusters attached to his suit.
