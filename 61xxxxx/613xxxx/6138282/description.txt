Release Notes:

The Norwegian sextet Kaizers Orchestra build cathartic rock songs that borrow
heavily from the dirges of Tin Pan Alley and Eastern European folk music. Formed
in the late '90s in the city of Bergen, the band consists of Jan Ove Ottesen and
Geir Zahl on vocals/guitar/oil barrel, Helge Risa on pump organ, Ã˜yvind
Storesund on accordion and bass, guitarist/percussionist Terge VinterstÃ¸en, and
Rune Solheim on drums. Their signature sound eventually led to a record deal
with Scandinavian label Broiler Farm, and the band released Ompa Til du DÃ¸r in
2001, an album that won the Norwegian Grammy and went on to become the
highest-selling rock debut ever issued in the Norwegian language. Evig Pint
followed in 2003, resulting in numerous awards and even more impressive record
sales than its predecessor. The band signed an international deal with Universal
Germany for 2005â€™s Maestro, a typically diverse outing that boasted higher
production values than their previous two releases. The similarly themed
Maskineri arrived in 2008, followed by a collection of re-recorded versions of
previously unreleased material called VÃ¥re Demoner (Our Demons) in 2009. Now
this is the first out of three installments in a planned trilogy called Violeta
