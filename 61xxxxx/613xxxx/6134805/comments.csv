Please be patient.

I'll have more mags to u/l when this is distributed."

,RecycledElectrons,2011-02-07T00:00Z,"I may have OCRed a few of them, but not many. If the file name ends with "" - ocr.pdf"" then it has been OCRed.

I use the Fujitsu scan-to-PDF to scan them, and I check the docs for missing pages.

Then, if I have time, I use ABBYY Fine Reader to add a layer of (definitely not proof-read) text behind the picture of the page.

My future dumps will have more OCR and less just-text. I'm OCring while things upload, but it takes a lot more time to run the OCR software than to scan.
