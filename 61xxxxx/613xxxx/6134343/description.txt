1975 - Gilgamesh

"One of the premier bands to feature on the Canterbury scene, GILGAMESH was led by the extraordinary keyboardist Alan Gowan, before his premature death. The music is very intricate, and of course keyboard oriented. The first album is quite an excellent fusion prog effort with lots of great synth work from Gowan. Recommended to fans of NATIONAL HEALTH or HATFIELD AND THE NORTH."

"...The album is more or less straight fusion/jazz and more so than any other Canterbury band. Gilgamesh is still very much a Canterbury scene band. They have been compared to National Health and Hatfield & The North. I agree with that assessment. But Gilgamesh is more straight than any of those two bands..."

"...In short, an album that reflects the jazzier sides of an already very much jazz oriented scene. It belongs in anyones Canterbury Scene collection!"
