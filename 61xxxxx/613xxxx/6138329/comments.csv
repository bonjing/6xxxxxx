,Mr_Stoned_the_bootlegger,2011-02-01T02:11Z,Many thanks and in FLAC too. The real collectors really appreciate the lossless FLAC format. :-) 
,ultraVert,2011-02-06T22:51Z,"Glad you like it Mr. Stoned :)

There aren't a lot of things I have that others already don't, except for music... I'll be going through my collection of cd's soon, and will be putting up a lot more stuff.  All rock, grunge, punk etc.  All in flac format."
,PC800,2011-10-23T16:53Z,"Many thanks for FLAC!  Don't understand how people can stand to listen to 128k rips?  I mean, yes it's free, I get that I shouldn't complain, but they sound so shitty. "
,borriffick,2012-02-01T04:09Z,"It's obviously better quality, thanks for the flac format.
The torrents I've made are sort of trying to be respectful of the artist, so I generally don't upload anything under 15 years old, and only have 320k mp3s, so if they want the real thing in their hands at full quality they'll still have to buy it.
However, the music industry can go fuck itself, just like it's been fucking all of us for so long."
