,GonnaFSU,2011-02-13T01:21Z,You know a torrent is legit when it has 42 seeders and 3 comments. Good Job.
,AcidOnboard,2011-02-16T15:00Z,Nice upload man!! thnx!
,Cloud0918,2011-02-25T01:46Z,How long is it supposed to take to install?
,gtx295y,2011-03-28T09:41Z,"Hey! game is not running, displaying error as written below-

....\Postal2Stp\System\Postal2.exe is not a valid win32 application"
,Erx31,2011-04-04T15:49Z,"TNX for the up, i am downloading most of your torrents love your FPS games, does i need special server to play this online?"
,Alenthas,2011-04-25T15:35Z,"gtx is right this doesnt work, I dont see why people are seeding this. it takes more than half an hour to install and its just shit"
,Demon_Cheetah,2011-04-25T18:42Z,Care to explain why my computer found a trojan in the engine.dll file?
,Demon_Cheetah,2011-04-25T18:58Z,"Btw, the last comment was more of a question. A great upload, trojan or not lol."
,fakenstein666,2011-06-12T02:43Z,"Ok this is great install CD lol
If you want faster instal do this:
Extract All files from iso to C:\Porgram Files\Postal2STP and then run setup from there
It will install in 5 seconds"
,m24bm24,2011-06-21T07:33Z,"I think I love you  0_0 In all seriousness, I'll be damned if I don't try this. I stupidly deleted Share The Pain before trying the expansions and your looks great. Downloading now =)"
,KillerBunniezz,2011-07-20T23:46Z,"Hey, I Got A Problem. I Got The Game Fast, installed it. but when i run AWP or ED, it says: 

Ran out of virtual memory. To prevent this condition, you must free up more space on your primary hard disk.

 I have cleared space and it got up to 300mb (my computers old) but still wont work. and also, when i run Postal2 Share The Pain, It comes up with a windows batch file, then dissapears. nothing else. anyhelp would be highly apprieciated as this game is amazing. thx :)"
,j0ket,2011-08-23T22:27Z,Thannksss!
,walkthedinosaur,2011-09-12T03:14Z,Why do you compress an ISO it doesn't save up any space it just makes the installation longer.
,walkthedinosaur,2011-09-12T04:45Z,Hmm nevermind. my bad.
,jonathanmadison12,2011-11-02T03:27Z,Something to play until Postal 3 is released. Thanks for the great torrent :D
,jonathanmadison12,2011-11-02T03:30Z,"Also @KillerBunniezz: 300MB isnt enough space, you need at least 8Gigabytes or so... you will also need at least a 32Megabyte graphics card (16 works too, ive tried it,) and a 750MHz processor. "
,Philonetic,2011-12-20T11:11Z,"Also : 300MB isnt enough space, you need at least 8Gigabytes or so... you will also need at least a 32Megabyte graphics card (16 works too, ive tried it,) and a 750MHz processor. 
@jonathanmadison12  and  @KillerBunniezz

Pick up a 500gb HDD from Ebay for $30
Get a 1GB Graphics card for another $30
Upgrade your processor for less than $10
Get 2gb+ of RAM for under $30
A good motherboard costs $40-$80
Power supply is $20-$40
DVD/BluRay drives are cheap as well.

Anything less than 2gb RAM and a 512mb Graphics Card is just junk, and it's time to upgrade.  I recommend a 2gb Graphics Card, atleast 4gb RAM, and atleast a 2.6ghz duo core processor."
,crougez,2012-01-30T16:47Z,nice game
