White Navigation DVD 4.92 for Honda and Acura.

I don't have a list of models and years, but if you have a white disk its the same.

I think there is copy protection to get around
I have heard you can put an original in first, then put the copy in and it will work.
Maybe someone with a little skill and time can alter the protection.

the zip file was corrupted in my previous post.  sorry bout that... I have checked and double checked all the files in this posting.

Ripped using OS X 10.6.6 disk image windows iso/img mounters will mount these images
compressed to gzip
split to 100mb rar files

sorry bout the multi levels and segments, but if I'm going to seed this I need to use my phone's 4g connection 1mbps ul.  Fat32 file size limits prevent me from leaving it in one piece.  I'll upload to a few other locations that have file size limits, and the program I used wouldn't go bigger than 100mb segments.
will have the pieces
