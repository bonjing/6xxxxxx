,CsRoland86,2011-01-30T01:06Z,is there a way to play this game besides paying online?
,kenshinsars,2011-01-30T11:22Z,"you cannot use this to play the game, as the registration requires a ""registration code"" which comes with the purchase of the game "
,00whistler00,2011-02-08T03:04Z,Well the idea is that now someone can buy a cheap online key and download this although at the sametime they could grab it off another site.

thanks"
,samahir,2011-07-21T14:30Z,u are going great guys .keep on seeding .after completing the download i will keep on seeding it for 2 months :D

Man, I wish I knew that before I bought the game.
But, I'm happy I've found it here, I can always rely on TPB, thanks!"
