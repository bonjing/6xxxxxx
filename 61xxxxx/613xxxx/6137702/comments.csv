when you search back to history, to times of prince (Omar Bin Abd AL Aziz), you will find that those years where islam was the formal religion in arab countries; there were no single poor in all muslim countries, when they collect the Zakah (a must be paid 2.5% of your uneeded money in islam) they did'nt found anyone to give it to him 

islam has solved every social or economic problem a country may had, tell me any and I will give you an islamic text solving it very effectively

but the fact that NOW there is no country at all in the world ruled by islam, let you judge wrongly,
don't tell me arabic countries have islamic rules, I live in middle east and there is no islamic rules, just the name islamic, become an identity nothing more

I'm not against you but against your idea, and I'm just sharing you real knowledge
