Screenwriter Darryl Quarles follows up his smash hit Big Momma's House (2000) with another raucous Martin Lawrence collaboration. Lawrence stars as Jamal Walker, an employee at a medieval-themed mini-golf course who wakes up in 14th century England after a blow to the head. Jamal has soon allied himself with a peasant girl and a broken-down ex-knight to defeat the evil King Leo (Kevin Conway) and his bullying minion, Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson). In the meantime, Jamal busts some modern dance moves on the medieval dance floor and encounters such intriguing residents of the period as knaves, peasants, archers, jousting knights, maidens, a princess, and even a giant. Black Knight (2001) is the sophomore directing vehicle of longtime television producer Gil Junger, who joins Lawrence in replacing the team originally attached to this comic vehicle, director F. Gary Gray and star Chris Tucker.
