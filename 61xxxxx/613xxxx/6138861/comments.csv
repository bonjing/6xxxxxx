,zzGoWR,2011-02-22T12:48Z,"Ight so I tried this on Vista x64bit and everytime I go to launch the game, I get a screen that says ""Installation has succeeded, restart your computer to finish."" Or something similar lol, but every time I restart it gives me the same error.

All your other torrents are flawless though, thank you FuctUpPunk! :D

,thetermnater,2011-03-18T05:46Z,"ok so i've downloaded it with Utorrent and extracted to my desktop, what do i mount? :"
,genomexg,2011-07-27T19:56Z,"Does anybody knows why when i click the ""Online Game"" button everything freezes and i have to use Ctrl+Alt+Del to gain control of the computer?

It's weird because this version is for online playing and it seems that the online playing is not working and worst, it freezes my computer.

In single player it's running just fine, there aren't any bad issues...

So, anybody can help me with this problem? 

Should i get a new copy? I mention that i din't get any errors in the installation process.

Thanks in advance and thanks for the up!

I'm waiting for you solutions."
