,oorocker76,2011-02-03T21:23Z,I saved it as ... in my download manager and now it won't open it say that the video can't be found.  I guess by saving it as ... it created a parodox or something because it won't let me modify the folder either but i doubt theres anything wrong with the torrent just my dumb ass but if anyone has any ideas let me know
