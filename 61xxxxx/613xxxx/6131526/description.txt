BobTheBlob is a game created by a group of mad people, as the final project of the education in their gymnasium.

The game is badly painted, badly coded (though mostly bug-free), won't be updated and hard as hell.

We recommend this to people who is slightly masochistic and likes to spend time solving levels without logic.

Even though it's many flwas, it's quite charming, adn won't take long to download.

I can not provide any guarantees that this is virus free, except for the lack of reasoning required to try to spread a virus through a small (popularity-wise) torrent like this.

And best of all-You can get it for free with the makers consent.

Hardcore or just stupid, you decide.
