My Personal Notes:
This has campaign, single player zombies, and multiplayer w/ bots
All instructions necessary are in the readme.
All the game modes lag like a bitch when you first start them but the fps gradually improves as you play.
Mutliplayer isn't really multiplayer, it's like combat training. (For those of you who don't have the legit black ops game, combat training is when everything is exactly like multiplayer, but you fight against computer controlled enemies)
