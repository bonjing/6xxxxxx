,iPhart,2011-01-31T00:46Z,"is it working for anyone? im thinking that maybe the compressing deleted some crack files... are u guys who are reporting the steam error using the console to start the game?
@assembledwaffles what exactly doesnt open?"
,Istancow,2011-01-31T00:48Z,"Same as assembledwaffles, here."
,Istancow,2011-01-31T00:49Z,The application won't run when I open it.
,AssembledWaffles,2011-01-31T05:55Z,yea the application itself. it just keeps bouncing on the dock for a couple seconds and goes away
,Xsdeaf,2011-01-31T22:04Z,its missing files- theres no black ops.exe
,fpkurt,2011-01-31T23:20Z,"ya ive got the same problem as AssembledWaffles. it will bounce twice in the dock then close...

ive tried locking all the files, unlocking them, moving them, trying to re root them no luck. 

iPHART SAVE US BRO!!! i wanna slay some zombies"
,iPhart,2011-02-01T06:07Z,my version works so im guessing the compression fcked it up. im gonna download whatever the fck i uploaded and i'll make some instructions on getting it to work

- Macbook White

Maybe I locked the wrong files?
Which one should i lock?
Contents\Resourses\C_Drive\Program Files\Activision\Call Of Duty - Black Ops\

BlackOpsMP.exe
or
main\BlackOps.exe
or
main\BlackOpsMP.exe

Thanks in advance!

Thekn"
,fpkurt,2011-02-02T02:44Z,"id assume thats right thanks iPhart!

@ahankala1 this is a mac port buddy go download the PC version

@Theknn read the above comment hes gonna figure out the problem and let us know."
,iPhart,2011-02-02T02:45Z,"@ahankala this is only for mac
@thekn lock BlackOps.exe and BlackOpsMP.exe
but if it makes u feel any better, u can lock the ones in the main folder 2 cuz it wont affect gameplay, its just to prevent an odd bug from happening that deleted those 2 files upon quitting the game"
,iPhart,2011-02-02T03:15Z,"as a quick fix while i download this, ive got a suggestion and a question
Suggestion: download all the files from: 
(tpb wont let me post links so i'll have to describe the site) 
type this out backwards without spaces moc . erifaidem and add /?78rj9mthra57n to the end
use those files to replace the files here: Contents\C_Drive\Program Files\Activision\Call Of Duty - Black Ops\
and see if that fixes it (lock the .exe's after u replace them before you play)

and my question: does the fatal error message only pop up during multiplayer? and if so, has anyone tried the singleplayer? answering these questions will help me isolate the problem and find a fix quicker :)"
,fpkurt,2011-02-02T05:00Z,downloading those files and testing now ill let you know how it goes bro
,fpkurt,2011-02-02T05:53Z,nope still no luck man.
,360hype,2011-02-02T06:24Z,"No more fatal error but now it gets stuck at a black screen with the words ""Shader Warming..."" in red at the lower left hand corner. This occurs after the activision intro. Then after a few mins the black ops title screen appears, then after selecting which type of game you want to play the black screen reappears, but this time after waiting for mins the program closes."
,iPhart,2011-02-02T06:37Z,thanks for trying it. did u try playing it on singleplayer?
,360hype,2011-02-02T06:43Z,"Yeah, i was trying that but it won't get there. I tried copying the BlackOps.exe from your previous torrent (I think the one you uploaded before this) because that was missing in this one. I got it to run, and was able to play both single player and the zombies mode but both were extremely slow. I ended up dying without knowing what hit me lol."
,malofx,2011-02-02T08:34Z,"For those with the icon just jumping!!! 

Copy BlackOps.exe from /main/ to Call Of Duty - Black Ops

I think iPhart forgot to place it in there.

Hope this helps."
,iPhart,2011-02-02T12:31Z,"@360hype zombies in this one is slow? for me it starts out slow but after walking and shooting, is progressively gets better. but thanks for telling me cuz that means its just mp that won't work... odd. after i download it i'll see what i can do"
,sawjonathan1,2011-02-02T13:58Z,it aint workin 4 me too...i had the same with mw2 but when i chenged some files it worked. so imma try it also with this

,Theknn,2011-02-02T15:31Z,"@fpkurt yeah i know, ever heard of specs feedback?"
,Theknn,2011-02-02T15:33Z,"@malofx didn't worked for me

Thanks for you're work!;)

,malofx,2011-02-03T07:34Z,"@Theknn did you restart the computer? I think that might have something to do.

@iPhart, after I downloaded those files, I sill could not play online, I get a message saying, I need to be connected to a PC network.

Thank you"
,Theknn,2011-02-03T13:37Z,@malofx no i didn't do that! I'll give you feedback
,sawjonathan1,2011-02-03T15:20Z,downloaded the files and still not working:S i guess there more missing files.
,sawjonathan1,2011-02-03T15:38Z,"btw @iphart
u uploaded a file called steam_appid.dll
and when i click to open it its almost empty...(it only says:42700) "
,Theknn,2011-02-03T16:17Z,@malofx reboot didn't fix it
,malofx,2011-02-03T17:24Z,"@Theknn I had the same issue, and this is exactly what I did.

1) Copy BlackOps.exe from /main/ to Call Of Duty - Black Ops
2) Set the LOCK box to those two files.
3) I set the wrapper to MP

I really didn't do anything else.

Good luck"
,sawjonathan1,2011-02-03T18:15Z,"well.. i have the same problem as tehkn9
should i try to unzip it again?"
,sawjonathan1,2011-02-03T18:42Z,i did everything again and it still aint working:S
,garsen,2011-02-04T02:37Z,"i moved the exes to the two different locations and locked them.

Any help?"

,sawjonathan1,2011-02-07T14:29Z,"then ur download failed.
i think the only solutiion is downloading again.dunno 4 sure"
,iPhart,2011-02-07T22:46Z,"@albraa jonathan's right, ur torrent client probably forgot to download a couple of kb. hopefully by now u still kept ur damaged .7z file, cuz if u didnt, u gotta redownload the whole thing. if u kept it, follow these steps:
open the torrent file with transmission
transmission will give u a little confirmation pop up that you wanna download it
where it says ""Download to: ~/Downloads"" click the change button and select the folder you put the damaged .7z in
click verify local data
let the bar go all the way across and then click add
it should start downloading the rest of the file

@ everyone status of multiplayer: i redid all the steps to activate multiplayer, but it still gave me the steam error. i also got a fresh wrapper but it still gave me an error. im guessing either the problem is one little file is missing from the program files or treyarch patched it (which i highly doubt). right now im gonna start up the program files in windows and see if i still get an error and see if that helps me. if i run out of ideas, i'll create a fresh new black ops app and upload black ops for the fourth time X( during weekdays i got a shit load of homework so im hoping on getting rid of the steam error by the weekend"
,sawjonathan1,2011-02-08T15:08Z,"@iphart
the most of us cant even open up the app.

i followed all the steps 1 by 1 and it doesnt work.
so im kinda sure there a few files missing."

,ynkhmer,2011-02-08T18:12Z,...dont copy/move the one from the 'main' folder.... i got mine from a friend whos has BlckOps on a windows...all you need to is copy and paste into the Call of Duty - Black Ops folder

Solution for non-starting problems.
Just download a crack for the PC Game (search black ops crackonly on TPB)
and put it in your Black ops folder inside the CiderX wrapper. It works for me :)
Thanks iPhart!"
,acslate,2011-02-08T23:58Z,"downloaded crack, still non-starter. help us iphart, ur our only hope..."
,iPhart,2011-02-09T00:40Z,"k so im guessing the compression deleted the cracked stuff. download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6146391/Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.Update.5.and.6-SKIDROW_%5BALEX%5D
move the stuff in the skidrow folder to C_Drive/Program Files/Activision/Call of Duty - Black Ops
then lock the two exe's

if thats too complicated for u guys, just say so and if 10 people say so, i'll reupload the whole singleplayer part with no compression"
,r-dawg,2011-02-09T01:31Z,"I moved the crack into the BlackOps folder and my icon still bounces on start up. Could the problem be that my graphics card is an ATI? (ATI Radeon HD 4670 to be exact). I noticed it says ""ATI:Gray"" in the game description but i dunno what that means. Thanks"
,acslate,2011-02-09T01:33Z,"still no luck bro... open and immediately close.

can you explain thoroughly the wrapper thing, i've changed the game name in the directory branch below where it says gameEXE, is that correct?"

Hey dude, 

Ive been downloading this shit forever and i finally got it, expanded it, locked files and everything. followed all steps and suggestions in comments and if you could email me or post screenshots of what all your folders and contents look like that would be great. or post a new torrent or something, im afraid i fcked something up somewhere and i really want this game, made an account JUST to ask for help here. All the app does is bounce twice and go away, a problem most of us seem to be having, compression fcked it up possibly? locked files and etc but with the .dat files in the Black Ops folder my mac tries to open it with VLC so i told it to open with Terminal which i imagine would do the job but didnt so its currently opening with textedit. I need this game since my PS3 broke and i need something to hold me over till i get the cash to fix it. 

Please help ASAP mate. 
my email is tommlubeck@gmail.com if ya need it, Im desperate. Save me, iPhart! "

,chmusic,2011-02-28T10:02Z,"Alright so I'm still trying to get this working.

I applied the patch and copied over the SKIDROW files into the main directory of the CoD: Black Ops folder. I also changed the C_Drive file to say ""/Applications/Call\ of\ Duty\ -\ Black\ Ops.app/Contents/Resources/C_Drive"" to fix up the error where it said that ""./Contents/Resources/C_Drive"" was not a directory. Yet I'm still getting the issue where it won't launch, and I have locked the exe files too.

Any suggestions?"

The files didnt work :( ive tried 3 times now, but the game wont even open. all it does is bounce on the bar a couple times before disappearing. I think after 4 days of trying shit its time to give up..."
,MudSwipe,2011-03-01T06:20Z,"iPhart has fucked this up 3 times, no offence 'cos you did a great job with torrent no.2 - the multiplayer and zombies was gone though. Seems like every time you try to fix something something else pops up. Nice work though."
,sawjonathan1,2011-03-02T15:09Z,why is it so difficult to make it work on mac?:SS
,iTzAweshom,2011-03-06T09:22Z,"Hey Iphart, can you please help? I downloaded this for a heck of a long time, did everything it said in the read me thing, and I tried running the Black ops app, but it doesn't work. Can you help me?"
,khajwant,2011-03-09T19:47Z,I cannot resume and quit a game it just hangs and no resume game option in campaign
,iceburn12,2011-03-15T02:16Z,is there zombies??
,staticfuzz,2011-05-12T04:34Z,"I am new to this site, downloaded this torrent, fairly quickly I must say, and I was just wondering, what would be good graphic settings to play it on.  I have a 2011 MBP Intel Quad Core i7, with a AMD Radeon HD 6490m with 256mb.  The game does lag, but I have only started on the first chapter, so if you can post what the best setting would be for video, please let me know.  Thanks in advance."
,callofdutyexpert,2011-06-09T22:50Z,@iPhart hey please respond to this because when i finish downloading it it opend as a text edit and when i poen it the text edit dosn't say anything any help?
,xalax104,2011-06-28T10:36Z,how come when i right click it it doesn't show up 'show package contents'

I downloaded this, and expanded the 7z with Ez7z and got the app locked the .exe(s), but when i try to open the app it shows the icon on the dock, closes with a second icon replacing it, and then that closes to. What did I do wrong?"
,gggarko,2012-02-29T03:09Z,"@IPHART does the single player works smoothly without any lagging with high resolution???i just need the single player only to play...i downloaded all the series of COD from COD1 to COD MW 3,COD WaW and work pretty well with highest resolution,no LAG at all....
