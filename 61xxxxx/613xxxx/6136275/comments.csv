,dukeford57,2011-09-13T07:49Z,Not a remake. It's from 1964. Stars Sir Richard Attenbourough and the 'Awesome' Kim Stanley.
,fLuoXeTiN,2012-02-29T22:18Z,"Thanks for upload but 'tis 1964, not '84.. (by the way; 1984, I'm sure you all know is that ""Orwellian"" year that is always in the near future, am I right or am I right, right?)"
