Product Description
When it comes to photography, it\'s all about the light.

After spending more than thirty years behind the lens working for National Geographic, Time, Life, and Sports Illustrated Joe McNally knows about light. He knows how to talk about it, shape it, color it, control it, and direct it. Most importantly, he knows how to create it...using small hot shoe flashes.

Using Nikon Speedlights, Joe lets you in on his uncensored thought process often funny, sometimes serious, always fascinating to demonstrate how he makes his pictures with these small flashes.
