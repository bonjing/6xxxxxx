Richard Harris made a triumphant return to the screen and received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance in this film. A plot of earth in rural Ireland, The Field is rented and lovingly cultivated by "Bull" McCabe (Harris). When its legal owner suddenly decides to sell the land, a wealthy American appears with plans to develop the area. To Bull, covering the land with concrete is a mortal sin. To the villagers, an outsider owning Bull's field is an outrage that McCabe vows to prevent at any cost. Co-starring John Hurt, The Field is a compelling story of one man's determined battle to resist change and defend his heritage.
