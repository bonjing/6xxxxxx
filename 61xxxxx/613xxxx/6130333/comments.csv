,John_Bee,2011-01-27T05:01Z,"sounds like a good film, Mr. F.Stop --- but when are you gonna start seeding...?"
,scottielass,2011-01-27T15:39Z,This is indeed a good film and Richard Harris is brilliant. Thank you very much.
,f_stopblues,2011-01-27T21:10Z,"@ John_Bee ; I am on a slow connection and only able to seed the torrents over a few days/weeks, so if you're not patient and nobody else seeds once they have 100% well no matter how good the rips are, if others don't bother seeding, the torrents die pretty fast.

Thats the game, thanks for your interest."
