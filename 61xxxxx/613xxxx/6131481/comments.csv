Episode 3 of Ice Pilots NWT. As always it's a rip from website, so don't expect brilliant quality. But so far only this is available. Btw. there's no even dvdrip from Season 1 yet :(. Shame on you Canadians, shame on you!

Quality V:7 A:5.

And as usual: Blame Canada!

Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed Please!"
,tellme2,2011-01-27T16:50Z,no one to blame just praise mate
,izwolle1,2011-01-27T21:11Z,why is it not a avi. ?
[V],mirogster,2011-01-27T22:57Z,"Answer:Maybe you find better copy 4ex. avi? 
Because I don't live in Canada and cannot rip digital hd version from tv-to best quality. Ok?
And if you can't play it, just please spear us whinning, kid."
,xtracal,2011-01-28T09:26Z,nice for uploading mirogster.  But don't be such a wank.  It would take an extra 5 minutes to convert it to Divx for those that don't have the knowledge.
[V],mirogster,2011-01-28T12:04Z,"Once more, for special care people. 
Please do it yourselves (conversion .flv to divx,xvid whatever). You'll end up with bigger file than original. Don't believe me, just do it?!  
So for fck sake,  why should I convert 180Mb ORIGINAL flv file, to 300/400Mb avi? 
Could You explain and convince me somehow? Am I loosing something?
Download, seed or ...well, guess what. 
Cheers :)"
