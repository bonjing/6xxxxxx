Very HQ rare promo music video. "Are We Ourselves" is a song from Phantoms, the third studio album by The Fixx, released in 1984. In addition to reaching #15 on the U.S. pop charts, became the band's first #1 single on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart, staying at the summit for two weeks.

The Fixx are an English rock band formed in London in 1979. They are one of the few bands to have enjoyed significant success outside their country of origin, notably in the United States and Canada, yet remain almost unknown in their home land. The band is best known for their song "One Thing Leads to Another", from their most successful album Reach the Beach in 1983. 

Their other hits include "Red Skies", "Stand or Fall", "Saved by Zero", "Sign of Fire", "Are We Ourselves?", "Secret Separation", "Driven Out", "How Much Is Enough?" and "Deeper and Deeper", which was featured on the soundtrack of Streets of Fire. "A Letter to Both Sides" appears on the Fletch soundtrack.

The Fixx are recording their 10th studio album "Something Ahead of You" due for release in April 2011.
