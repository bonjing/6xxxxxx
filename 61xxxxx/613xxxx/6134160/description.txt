This makes it super fast to take a screen shot of your desktop etc.

I scripted this myself with forum users in mind! great 4 use @ /wg/! 

What I have done is make the print screen button create an image of 

your desktop @ your desktop when you press the print-screen button!

Now you don't have to activate an image editor and create the screen 

shot and save the file while giving it a name! Taking a screen shot 

is now fast and simple, even faster than on Maverick (Linux 10.10).

P.s- It takes screen shots in .png format only due to it's wide use.

Tell me what you think! I wan't to here from ScreenCap.exe users!

Did it help you? is it useful? did it not work? Do you like it!?!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Feel free to request a simple application! i.e- Do you mail stuff 

often? I can make an email client that can send attachments from

your email! Or do you have really private data that needs to stay

Private? I made a script that uses rar.exe to super encrypt any 

file with a 30-70 character password that would take millions of

years to decrypt w/o a password as stated by the makers of Winrar!

For any serious request's, leave me a commen't at -

"http://riograndeforums.dyndns.org/1337/comment/" which is my cheesy

little web site! Just leave me you'r request and I'll get back at ya!
