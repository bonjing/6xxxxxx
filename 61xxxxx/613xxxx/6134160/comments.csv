,JSLR,2011-01-28T18:03Z,"Lmao, I also forgot to mention that it creates a reg key at HKLM\software\microsoft\windows\explorer\run

I'm not sure but it should be at one of the ""run"" key's. its name will be ScreenCap-TPB"
,aKp3,2011-01-29T09:10Z,"Hey brother, this is too good!! I used it and really enjoyed!! U said that we can ask any modifications in this so can u please add a feature of adding watermarks to the capture images!! I'll be grateful if u do. And the best thing of this I liked is it's size!! Thanx bro u rock!"
,JSLR,2011-02-07T15:41Z,"Sorry for the late reply, but yeah.

Shouldn't be to hard. Problem is, what should the water mark be?

Just some default text to appear after you enter it? or should it be another small image at a corner? "

,JSLR,2011-02-07T16:08Z,"I fucking give up, just try to find out what includes are and include file.au3 snd screencapture.au3"
,JSLR,2011-03-31T06:40Z,"I cant believe there's still seeders....

Any way, I'm gonna make an even better version now that I've learned enough about how Autoit works etc. 

Sooner or later I'll post a superior version of ""SpeedCap"" lmao.

I'll include a gui so Its settings can be adjustable and an option to extract its source code so that you can make your own version and shit."
