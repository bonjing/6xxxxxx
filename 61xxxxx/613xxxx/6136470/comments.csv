,telaros,2011-01-30T17:24Z,why did everyone download this? it came up so long ago O.o
,bmxej2,2011-01-30T21:04Z,thats what i was thinking is it any different from the one a few weeks ago?
,telaros,2011-01-31T14:06Z,dont know. If anyone downloads this inform us please
,evillusion,2011-01-31T23:26Z,"I don't know wtf this is...Family Guy's 9th season is up to episode 10.
This is BS."
,zhagars,2011-02-01T01:40Z,"The misunderstanding with the episode nr is caused by the fact that this episode is not yet broadcasted on TV (as far as I understood, cause I'm from Europe). Wikipedia says: ""It will broadcast on the Fox network sometime during the 9th season.""
Meanwhile: ""Both the Blu-ray and DVD versions, titled Family Guy Presents: It's a Trap!, were released on region A and region 1, respectively, on December 21, 2010, Region 4, on December 22, 2010, and in Region 2 on December 27, 2010.""

Hope it helped. :)"

,Ryujinn,2011-02-07T21:08Z,"As far as I can tell it is just the movie, nothing special about it."
,dlarrym1111,2011-02-11T05:55Z,"Mis-labeled, not season 9-episode-21, but season 9-episode-11. It looks like someone accidently hit 21 instead 11 in the episode part of this uploads title. Everyone calm down, it is a simple typo. I saw this same torrent on another site and this was the reason given.  is partly right in that season 9's last episode before this one was in fact episode 10. This one came out the following week and is episode 11. 

Lets all take a deep breath this is just a 22 minute cartoon after all.

Some of you are writing as if your about to have a conniption!!!

Thanks eztv, you 'da' man!!!  :~)"
,Jimipettersson_,2011-02-14T00:05Z,"It is not mis-labeld. According to IMDB it is labeld as ""unkown season"" And that's cause it wasn't broadcasted as a usual episode.. This is the third part of the starwars-themed episodes. I hope I could help a bit."
,tktorrents,2011-02-16T18:48Z,"this episode was released on DVD/Blu BEFORE it aired, this is why the numbering seems off.

This is clearly the DVD rip of the episode availble in stores and NOT an aired version.

This completes the ""Family Guy Star Wars Trilogy"" (assuming they don't attempt to re-tell episodes 1-3 of course).

EZTV, as always, thanks!"
,ebud,2011-05-24T07:54Z,"hahaaaaaaa... that one is good, really!
And the whole thing about Seth Green... hahaha... so funny!
This is the best 'StarWars' remake!"
,ebud,2011-05-24T07:57Z,Iforgot... THX SO MUCH EZTV!!!
,ebud,2011-05-24T08:03Z,"A=10
V=10
E=HOLYSHIT, THIS WAS THE BEST EVER!! LAUGHED THE HOLE EPISODE"
,ebud,2011-05-25T01:27Z,"I wonder, though : How come this torrent has been released Jan29th, but aired in Canada May22nd, calling it 'season finale'??
What the...?"
