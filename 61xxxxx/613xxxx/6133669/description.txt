Ep. 1	"The White House"	December 2, 2010
The team gets to the bottom--literally--of a mystery concerning the cornerstones
of our democracy. Laid by the ultra secretive Freemasons, this landmark piece of
stone vanished. The search for the White House cornerstone has been on for over
200 years, everyone from Harry Truman to Barbara Bush have looked for it. Is it
a coincidence...or is there a secret conspiracy tied to these stones and the
buildings they were meant to support?

Ep. 2	"Secret Presidential Codes"	December 9, 2010
The team investigates the secret presidential codes of Thomas Jefferson and how
they may be partially responsible for the death of one of the world's greatest
explorers, Meriwether Lewis, of Lewis and Clark fame. Meltzer discovers that
although the Lewis family has been working for 15 years to exhume his body, the
National Parks is preventing the exhumation. This episode attempts to answer why
the federal government would want to keep the body buried against the family's
wishes and what really happened to the man who more than 200 years after his
death remains our most iconic explorer.

Ep. 3	"Statue of Liberty"	December 16, 2010
Brad Meltzer and his team thought they knew what the Statue of Liberty stood
for. But now they learn that America's most powerful icon of freedom might
actually be loaded with secret symbols put there by a sinister group bent on
world domination. They investigate claims that the Illuminati, a secret European
society loosely affiliated with the freemasons, turned every inch of the statue
into a coded message, from the torch Liberty holds high, to the rays emanating
from the crown, even to the precise height of the statue itself. Things get even
stranger when a highly regarded numerologist shows the team why he believes the
statue is really a monument to the all-powerful number 7. As they evaluate these
unsettling claims, Brad and the team are forced to reconsider whether one of
America's most enduring symbols is really who she appears to be.

Ep. 4	"The Lincoln Assassination"	December 23, 2010
Brad Meltzer and his Decoded team examine claims that John Wilkes Booth actually
escaped to freedom after murdering President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. The
"official" version of events says federal agents cornered Booth and killed him
just days after the assassination. But Brad and the team uncover glaring
inconsistencies in that 150-year-old account: Why did the authorities hide
Booth's body from public view? Why was Booth autopsy's conducted in complete
secrecy in the cramped confines of an ironclad gunboat? Searching for answers to
these and other troubling questions, the team finds startling evidence that
strongly suggests Booth may indeed have lived into old age without ever facing
punishment for his crime.

Ep. 5	"Confederate Gold"	December 30, 2010
Brad Meltzer and his team dig into one of the Civil War's most enduring legends:
that millions of dollars' worth of missing gold and silver from the Confederate
treasury are still buried in secret hiding places across America. According the
legend, the only way to find that buried treasure is to decode cryptic signs and
symbols left behind by a shadowy Confederate group known as the Knights of the
Golden Circle. Brad and the Decoded team join veteran treasure hunter Bob
Brewer, whose lifetime effort to understand the KGC's secret code paid off when
he uncovered a small fortune in buried Confederate coins. Bob soon shows just
how well he understands those codes as he and the team follow KGC clues to the
location of another possible treasure trove.

Ep. 6	"D.B. Cooper"	January 6, 2011
Brad Meltzer and the team jump at the chance to take on one of the FBI's most
puzzling unsolved crimes: the 1971 disappearance of airline skyjacker D.B.
Cooper, who bailed out of a jetliner at ten thousand feet over Washington state
with two parachutes and two hundred thousand dollars in ransom money strapped to
his body. Working closely with the former FBI agent who headed up the
unsuccessful search for Cooper, Brad and the team examine new evidence that
points to a former airline employee named Kenny Christiansen, whose own brother
suspects he was actually the skyjacker who called himself D.B. Cooper. This sets
up a climactic meeting between the Decoded team and Christensen's possible
accomplice, the man who may have helped D.B. Cooper and his two hundred thousand
dollar ransom vanish into thin air.

Ep. 7	"2012"	January 13, 2011

Brad and team work to decipher the meanings behind numerous ancient prophecies,
from Christian to Jewish texts, to Muslim and Native American legends, even
predictions made by a supercomputer, that supposedly warn of worldwide
destruction in the year 2012.

Ep. 8	"The President's Inner Circle"	January 20, 2011
What if the United States was saved by the most covert spy ring in US History,
made up almost entirely of ordinary people? They were called: The Culper Spy
Ring. This group of code-named spies worked stealthily to steal secrets from the
British, giving the Americans a heads up on surprise attacks and enemy troop
movements. The Decoded team will uncover if this small circle of shopkeepers,
tavern owners and housewives may have played the most important role in
defeating the British in the Revolutionary War more than 200 years ago.

Ep. 9	"Secret Societies"	January 27, 2011
Brad Meltzer and his team try to penetrate Bohemian Grove, one of America's most
tightly guarded gatherings of the rich and powerful. The Decoded team converges
on the group's hideaway in a northern California redwood forest to pursue rumors
of ritual sacrifice and secret agreements that control the lives of everyday
Americans. Brad soon finds out just how difficult it is to uncover Bohemian
Grove's secrets. He knew sending the team into the Grove would be risky, but he
never expected they'd be calling him for bail money.

Ep. 10	"Apocalypse in Georgia"	February 3, 2011
Brad Meltzer and the team search for the true meaning of the mysterious Georgia
Guidestones. Often called America's Stonehenge, this granite monument is located
on a remote hilltop outside Atlanta. Brad and the team examine the multilingual
messages carved into the stones for any clues to the monument's anonymous
creator, who's known only by the pseudonym -- J.C. Christian. The Decoded team
checks out rumors that the Guidestones are really the work of a secretive
religious sect called the Rosicrucians, who've been accused of practicing
alchemy and mind control.
