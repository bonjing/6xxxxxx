C# 4.0 Unleashed is for anyone who wants to learn the C# programming language in depth, understanding how language features truly work. While giving you those insights, you learn where and how to use the features to design various kinds of software. This book not only teaches the languageâ€™s capabilities, it also looks behind the scenes to build a solid foundation to aid you in understanding the .NET platform as a whole.

Bart De Smet offers exceptional insight into the features of both the language and Microsoftâ€™s broader framework. He doesnâ€™t just cover the â€œwhatâ€ and â€œhowâ€ of effective C# programming: He explains the â€œwhy,â€ so you can consistently choose the right language and platform features, maximizing your efficiency and effectiveness.
The early chapters introduce the .NET platform, the tooling ecosystem, and the C# programming language, followed by in-depth coverage of the C# programming language itself, with immediate application of language features. The last chapters give an overview of the .NET Framework libraries about which every good developer on the platform should know.
