,TayzGpa,2011-01-28T21:45Z,Are these trials or are they full versions?
,RumiLove,2011-01-30T02:20Z,"Thanks for this great collection that you have put together, before i download such a large file, could you tell me if all of these come with the serials or registration or are they the trial version.  

Thanks a lot.  Will download when i find out what it is exactly that i am downloading as i already have the trial versions."
,RumiLove,2011-01-30T21:42Z,"Hi I dl this and thankst!  Everything works great!

,D0gmeat,2011-02-05T14:27Z,Don't suppose you have an installer with the menu in English? I'd like to see and understand what I am clicking on. :)
,Zyzyxx,2011-02-28T22:07Z,"Avast detected a ""Win32 Malware-gen"" in the Dutch windmills and Fog lake exe. when I scanned them."
,Danimal502,2011-03-02T17:44Z,"Yea, I scanned entire folder with Avast and it came up clean.. then while trying to install a couple of them they came back as viruses."
,Danimal502,2011-03-02T17:44Z,Is it because their cracked or because they actually have viruses?
,Zyzyxx,2011-03-02T22:26Z,I honestly don't know. I would assume that if it was just because of them being cracked they would all get flagged.

AVG found viruses associated with these screensavers. I moved viruses to the vault and continued. The rest of the screensavers installed with no problems so far. I will keep you posted as long as my computer doesn't crash, my fingers are crossed."
,stormy1,2011-07-20T21:17Z,"So far so goodâŚeverything is running fine, hopefully it will stay that way. I am not sure if those above screensavers have viruses or were targeted for being cracked. If anything goes wrong I will do my best to spread the word."
,awingnut444,2011-10-29T15:36Z,"Do not download: 1. It's in Russian, so you can't read options or instructions within the programs  2. It's Russian, and there are numerous warnings about dll hooks coming up in both AVG and Comodo.  Would you trust Russian software that's been cracked that has all these warnings?  Just asking."
