,malius89,2011-08-10T14:34Z,"don't know how but this torrent was hard for my E-HDD to process, overloaded the cache and i had a lot of hassle sorting it out. ended up havening to close utorrent, ctrlaltdel the process dead then remove all the files and the torrent listing to fix it. not bitching, just letting others know in case it happens to them."
,Meatus,2011-08-10T19:18Z,Great picture and sound.  Only downside is that you can't turn off Brad Pitt's subtitles.  Very small critique.
,Meatus,2011-08-10T19:19Z,I used VLC for mine and only had problems when I was downloading other stuff while trying to watch it.
,gira89,2011-08-18T14:02Z,"AWESOME.
Meatus: You can, there were no subtitles to me whilst watching it. You must have enabled them yourself, on purpose or not."
