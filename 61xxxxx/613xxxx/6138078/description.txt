Fashion photographer Frank Doorhof takes viewers on location with two models to create this photo shoot for Kelby Training. During the videos, Frank talks about why he tries to shoot tethered all the time, the importance of using a color checker, how he directs his models, and how he controls lighting adjustments through the camera and the strobe.
