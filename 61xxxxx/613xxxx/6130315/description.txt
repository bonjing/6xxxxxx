Written and directed by Alan Parker, Bugsy Malone is a gangster musical set in New York, a world of would-be hoodlums, showgirls and dreamers.

A world where you never see an adult - kids play the entire film, including Scott Biao as Bugsy and Jodie Foster as Tallulah.

Bugsy Malone is totally unique: quite simply there has never ever been a movie like it!
