Protests have erupted across Egypt again today with the largest and most widespread anti-government demonstrations seen so far. In an unprecedented display of popular protest, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators are gathering in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Mansoura, Sharqiya and elsewhere. Intense confrontations are taking place with state security forces. The protests come amid a vast security clampdown.

- Global Call To Release Imprisoned Indian Rights Activist Dr. Binayak Sen

An Indian high court is hearing arguments to release the nation's most famous political prisoner on bail and suspend his conviction. Last month, a trial court sentenced renowned physician and rights activist Dr. Binayak Sen to rigorous life imprisonment on the basis of an archaic colonial-era sedition law. Dr. Sen, along with two others, were found guilty of sedition and criminal conspiracy by a court in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on allegations of helping a banned group of Maoists. On Sunday, Dr. Sen's supporters around the world will mark a global day of protest against his conviction. Democracy Now!'s Anjali Kamat traveled to Chhatisgarh and filed this report on what lies behind the targeting and conviction of Dr. Sen.
