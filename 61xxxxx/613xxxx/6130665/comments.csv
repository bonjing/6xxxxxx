i guess you wont be playing this game

since you said ""'ll make sure not to waste my time downloading anything by you, because I'll probably get screwed again. ""


For the rest of you, have fun."
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-28T03:22Z,"and just so everyone knows

DONT UNCHECK THE LAST OPTION WHEN THE INSTALL IS FINISHED

otherwise the keygen wont run right after and you'll be confused and say ""there's no keygen""

if you did do that

go to the your start menu, then where the shortcut should be for the game and there's a folder. click on that and it'll take you to where the keygen is located."

,eMKay414,2011-02-23T15:54Z,"@Diavlis_1, can you please confirm that this version is working 100%???. There is a ""KNOWN BUG"" in this game where you cannot continue after approx 3 hours of gameplay. Bigfish released a new version to fix up the issues.

I have the older version (1.0.3.616 23/11/2010) which was downloaded from another torrent which has the 'trapdoor' bug. Was wondering if anyone can confirm if this one is bugfree...."

,prodi9y,2011-03-15T12:59Z,"Either this game has A LOT of files, or this program isn't going to cooperate with my system. It's been extracting the main application files repeatedly for like 15 minutes. I'm pretty sure it should of finished way before the 15 minute mark."

,eternal_darkness666,2011-11-22T11:24Z,"I installed the game successfully, and the keygen works as well but my screen resolution was the problem so I tried to uninstall it...

then it said that it can't uninstall because there was a problem in the installation and I keep getting a message: ""fatal error during installation"".

How can I fix this? I really want to uninstall it to free some memory..."
