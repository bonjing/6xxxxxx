Alright here it is the Halo Reach Noble Map pack for JTAG. 

The easiest way to install is to just unzip the rars and run Yaris Swap.

You will need to use Yaris Swap to Hex Mod the DLC and if you set it up correctly yaris will automatically upload it to the correct directory.

Otherwise just drop it in the following directory: /Hdd1/Content/0000000000000000/4D53085B/00000002/
