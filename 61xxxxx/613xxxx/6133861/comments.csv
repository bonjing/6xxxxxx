,Stevenmt57,2011-04-23T00:57Z,Well I want to thank you for trying to help with the uploads. It seemed like us DS fans were downloading a lot in the past and then the torrents stopped. We are a faithful bunch and I can promise I will download and seed for as long as needed. I love the old shows. I grew up watching it everyday after school. Thank you again for all that you are setting off to do for us. I will start spreading the news that the show is back for downloading.

Not to mention that they give a solid basis for documenting the series. Uploading a doctored version has degraded the general archive and probably kept others from making proper copies available. What kind of a-hole destroys information by clipping the DVD release and otherwise ""improving"" a valuable piece of television history? What's next, colorized versions of the early episodes and muting the sound when they mess up their lines?"

Carmoni, didn't your parents ever teach you that ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all?"" Just because you have a computer monitor masking you does not give you license to bitch and moan all over the internet. You should be supporting what we do here, not hindering those who are kind enough to share what they have."
