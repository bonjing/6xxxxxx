Modern Times was a Test upload

Coming up fair game"
,tylr,2011-01-30T19:26Z,"honestly.. i was expecting atleast a DvdRip from u, 20-40 did a dvdScr long back.. quite interestingly he too has the same hit-Run blues,
though he followed a rather lucrative technique to handle tat ;)

jus a handful guys in tpb release movies in a rather interesting size with impressive quality, u being one of 'em
im rather expecting a Dvdrip/BRRip from u(400~480mb)"
,tHaus,2011-01-30T19:39Z,"I have ZERO complaints. You are doing a fantastic job.  I hope everyone else shows some respect to you in terms of your dilligence and hard work.
You provide a great product with the best sources you have at the time of encoding.
Thanks again.  I always seed ""til my computer shuts down.  Cheers!!!"

,anaoluser,2011-01-30T19:41Z,"hart's war, bruce willlis . please"
,tHaus,2011-01-30T19:52Z,IF THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE EXPECT SOMETHING A CERTAIN WAY...ENCODE IT YOURSELF AND STOP BITCHING ABOUT SOMETHING YOU ARE GETTING FOR FREE!!!   FFS
,gate2padfoot,2011-01-31T01:14Z,"Will u please upload
Tangled 720p,
The next three days 720p"
,manuel008,2011-01-31T03:00Z,will u upload twilight saga?
,B.KITZ,2011-01-31T07:24Z,I agree with @tylr ..... Up only DvD or Blu-Ray ....
[V],pluto999,2011-01-31T09:56Z,"@tylr: source is different check it for yourself. You even get a TS for 2 gb does that mean its good in quality you even get an r5 in 700mb does it mean bad quality well size doesn't indicate too much about quality.. When Bluray will be out will do that too np!

@tHaus: thank you for stating what i had to say..Its the best deal right now, so grab it or leave it. Choice is yours.

@anaoluser:later

@gate2padfoot: yes both when they are available.

@manuel008: no."

Thanx man keep up the good work"
,woodflute,2011-02-18T23:14Z,I don't get it. Is this just a sound track? Did I do something wrong in the download? I didn't get a film. Thanks anyway.... I guess. 
,jess613,2011-03-21T14:31Z,Will you be doing Beastly or The Rite?
,missJiaLi,2011-04-30T08:52Z,"Thank you so much for this upload!!!
i LOVEEEEEEEEEE being able to find movies at 400 MB!! So i REALLY want to thank you for uploading it at this size!! So many people just assume everyone wants some huge 1.13 GB download, but for me and my connection - and many others!, 400 MB is AWESOME! And the quality was really lovely! 
MUCH appreciation man.....

,chanchan46,2011-06-19T19:38Z,"Hi Pluto666! 
I'm having an issue with the audio, however only with the ""talking"" audio - music audio seems fine. I can't hear when actors are talking when playback, what can I do to fix this?
I'm a newbie at this, can you please advise?
Thank you! :)"
,chanchan46,2011-06-19T19:43Z,"P.S. Tried to use 3 players:

- Media Player Classic Home Cinema - ""talking"" audio very low, scratchy and/or distorted;
- DivX Plus Player - no ""talking"" audio
- VLC media player"
