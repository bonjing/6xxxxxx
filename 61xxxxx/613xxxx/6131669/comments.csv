,frankieanime,2011-03-30T08:09Z,"A little hesitant to download. This is the NEWEST version right? Does it come with Fruity Convolver? 9.0 and under don't have it, it's and IR reader for guitar. It's legit? Feedback would be nice, I would hate to end up re downloading the friggen demo :S"
,frankieanime,2011-03-31T10:19Z,"Well, installed. Works FINE, BUT ONE problem. A dialer was found in the ""Hardcore uninstall"", removed with Emisoft Anti-Dialer, make sure you get rid of it if you download this. Otherwise, works great, it DOES have Fruity convolver. Definetly worth downloading, also it is for sure the full version. Thanks user !"
