              As a feudal war rages in 14th-century           
               Japan, those left behind are struggling to      
               survive. The family of a soldier make           
               their meager living by preying upon            
                 hapless samurai who come their way. When a      
                 friend of the soldier returns to the            
                women's hut, they learn the fate of their       
                soldier, and are forced to deal with this        
               survivor.
