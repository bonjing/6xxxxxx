Many many thanks for uploading this great movie again. Some Pieces of shit tried to defame you last time by hitting minus even before it was out 100%. I hope it doesnt happen this time. 

I can trust you blindly for your encodes and so shall others.
**Big Thumbs Up**"

People who have downloaded first upping of this torrent, can finish the download by:
-stopping and removing the old one from queue - DO NOT delete the data - just the torrent.
- loading and starting this one

Your torrent program would ""see"" the presence of existing files (of course, download location must be the same).

People who have 100% can do the same and help to seed."

,dark_defender,2011-01-28T19:24Z,"@twentyforty: I did not have to remove and load it again. It automatically resumed from there, when you upped it again. DL completed and seeding for long started. Will share at least 3 or 4 times."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-28T20:57Z,@dark_defender: Each torrent differs in hash-sum. If you have not loaded This torrent - you would seed just to the ones who haven't finished download using the old torrent - and then - you'll be seeding to no one. Good luck. Shit I wrote I wrote with purpose.
,dark_defender,2011-01-28T21:40Z,"@twentyforty: Oh, i dint know that. Well now i will remove it from seeding & load it again and then seed. Thanks for telling me."

,nandals,2011-06-17T15:18Z,"Hey man, I've downloaded this movie but it does not open in any other program but VLC. When I open it on quicktime or real player, only the sound comes out. Which is weird cause I've downloaded your ""a river runs through it"" too and it was working perfectly. 
Can you help me???"
