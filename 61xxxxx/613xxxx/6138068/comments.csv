but what really hits me watching this is that meat and steinman were theatre geeks in high school no doubt ... they act like it still today ... except now they think they're cool ... which is sad ... stienman is tolerable since he seems to know he's a geek still and is a bit embarrassed about his teen obsessions that really inspired this album (car crash songs, motorcycle sound effects in songs, and backseat/passion pit tales) ... 

meatload however spends every minute he can on this program singing over the selections to show he can still do it and he is a completely obnoxious asshat ... so that's pretty annoying ...

todd rundgren tho is a genius tho he's recognized as such by only a few people ... he produced it and handled most of the guitar (including doing the motorcycle sound effect ... an amazing piece of info i never knew and it is incredible to hear it separated out of the mix) ... and he's humble and is simply discussing the album as an album and isn't hyping himself up like meatloaf does (which is sad, like someone's dad trying to show his son's friends how cool he is and how rockin' he is ... you know the type) ...

this is a however an interesting program (the entire series is actually despite many artists and albums i could care less about ... as a musician you can always take something positive away from watching a background-exposing program like these) and while meat is obnoxious, the others are very sincere and honest and are not a bunch of self-promoting goons ... 

if you find these programs in this series, BBC Classic Album series, download them ... if you're a music fan you'll always draw something to remember and learn from them ... and the ones about albums you love will knock you out ... 

thanks for the up ... "

get a life!!!!"
,cormaczoso,2012-06-06T18:51Z,"oh and btw, there was that voice/pitch raising software (whatever the name is) used on this album for meat's vocals ... i saw him on the bat tour and he can't get near those high notes

and when he claims that's a 'high C' he's hitting (three in a row! he brags), it's not a high C ... listen to pavarati hit a high C and he's not close to it ... and even as close as he gets it's still fixed up in the studio and probably now live on stage for all i know ... he has a limited range, like everyone, and he cannot do those high notes 

so get off your high horse meatloaf ... you're breaking the poor animal's back!!"
