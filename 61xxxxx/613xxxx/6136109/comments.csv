,NeonRage,2011-01-29T14:59Z,"Downloaded only the crack, as I already have the game itself, however I can say that jejemonjutsu is full of shit as far as the crack goes. 

NO VIRUS DETECTED, scanned using Avast! Antivirus."
,NeonRage,2011-01-29T15:05Z,"Above poster is full of shit.

Crack is the same half-finished Fairlight crap we've been getting, so don't bother downloading unless you don't have the game already."
,NeonRage,2011-01-29T15:07Z,"And of COURSE the comments bug out on me..

Disregard the post above the one that's above this one."
,schrade,2011-01-29T21:00Z,"Can someone Please tell me how to get past the part where it asks for a serial key when I install the game? Someone mentioned that I shouldn't need the key.
If thats not true can someone please then give me a working key? Thanks"
