,RandomDudeee,2011-02-01T01:14Z,"This is to everyone posting a comment complaining about Barryosterburg.

Have the thought ever past thru your mind that he just might not be english and maybe since hes talking about kids hes around 30-50 years old and have english as a second language in his country and if he then is around 40 years old then i understand perfectly that he cant speak or write properly in english since most of old people that have english as a second language really do suck at it. For an example im swedish, i cant say im the best in speaking or writing in english but i manage to get around but my dad he really sucks at it and so does my mom. And keep in mind that many of the balkan countrys such as latvia and estonia and that didnt even study english in the 60's! So dont mark him for that and try to help him instead wtf is wrong with everyone these days. 

Piratebay is a swedish site so what if everyone would start speaking swedish in it and you britts and americans had to learn swedish too. And if there you didnt know to spell a word correctly we would yell at and say ""fuck of learn how to spell"" and ""go back to school"". Be kind to eachother instead and help the ones that needs help or dont comment and fuck off!"

To anyone with a brain in their head they can review his post, and see the use of the words he choose. How certain ones are OBVIOUSLY mis-spelled; and the further proof to his epic douchbaggery comes in full force when he uses words like ""fuke"". 

He knows what, fake means... because he doesn't want a bogus file... yet spells it as ""fuke"".

He's an idiot troll, probably some EMO bitch fag. Loving that all you bleeding heart noobs went to the defense of some halfwit... showcasing you're own stupidity. "

,piratewench2012,2011-02-05T05:09Z,"Just a warning. I'm not against this site or torrents in any way (fuck, no), but I had to warn whoever happens to try this movie (or any from hollywood). 

It finally happened. Charter/Disney emailed my dad with all the evidence that I'd downloaded ""Tangled"", though I forget which torrent I used (might've been this one; who knows?). In other words, Copyright Infringement (Damn it!). Luckily, it was just a warning this time (For fuck's sake, I fully intend to get the Blu-ray when it's released next month.), so I deleted the downloaded file, along with ""Black Swan"" (which was UNAVAILABLE where I am, except for 200+ miles out of the way. Quite imposible at that time.), and the ""Avatar: Director's Cut"", which I just recently ordered via Amazon.com.  

Anyway, hopefully I won't get warnings or worse, busted for those other two as I deleted the content, bought one (and maybe I'll purchase the other, too). Because frankly, I can't afford fines and I'd rather not have my ass thrown into jail. 

It seems the vultures are finding ways to go after users of The Pirate Bay now. Hopefully, they won't care about (some) software programs and lesser known films, anime and the like.  "

Disney would not have this information, your ISP would.... why would you get contacted by disney?!?!?

also, warnings are just that... they prob send out hundreds a month. I know people who have received dozens, but the cost it would take to investigate just one person makes the threat empty. Its more economic to go after the people who uploaded the video originally."

Comcast replied, ""because you're so easy to fuck. We don't gotta spread your ass to get ya!"" I call this story, ""Tangled Fuck"".
