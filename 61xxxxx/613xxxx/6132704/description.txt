Release Notes

MTV's official episode guide at 
http://www.mtv.com/shows/jerseyshore/season2/episodes.jhtml
lists this as part of season 2 so that is how we are
numbering. Apparently they decided to make these episodes
part of season 2 even though they were originally produced
to be season 3.
