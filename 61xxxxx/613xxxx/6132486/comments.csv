,brndneo,2011-02-22T19:29Z,"just registered to say:
Thanks man! this is awesome,never seen such a great collection before.

Just Great
Keep it up"
,pacfish,2011-02-22T20:56Z,"I think the collection is great and I support the notion to do this but I sure as hell don't want 13 gigs of space devoted to seeding this torrent fully.

I also would like to see ISBN so I know if I even need the book.
Having a search / find feature in the book I'm actually using would be super beneficial.
Then again I don't even know how one would obtain digital copies of these books.  Amazon doesn't have any available for the kindle that I can find..."
,brndneo,2011-02-25T16:20Z,"I've downloaded some of 'em & I'm pretty sure I would never find such high quality books anywhere else.
But pacfish is right, each zipped file has at least 2 editions of the book! but it is still worth it, for sure"

So Yeah a lot of Textbooks.  But I have never seen this much material, available freely to anyone who wants it... I'll be seeding for a while"
,cyber-pro232,2011-05-01T12:58Z,Nice collection. I'll be seeding it once I've finished downloading. Thanks for sharing.
,pacfish,2011-05-16T07:21Z,"Great collection, but I'm only 1 of 5 for the books I need and that 1 is not the book I'm actually using nor do I actually need the book for that class.
I will still seed whenever I can though =D
I just wish I could find more of what I need to justify buying a kindle ... other than not having to lug 25kg around school all day in books ^_^"
,btl69,2011-05-25T00:47Z,Holy shit this is for real. Hell of an upload! I only downloaded one file: Psychology Core Concepts. It's the latest and greatest (6th edition). Thanks alexbeane you're a fucking saint!

Please!"
