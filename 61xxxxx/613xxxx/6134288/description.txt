                    The Shining 1980 with English Subtitles
                   ----------------------------------------
The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick, co-written with novelist Diane Johnson, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd. The film is based on the novel of the same name, by Stephen King, about a writer with a wife and young son who accepts the job of off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel. The son, who possesses psychic abilities, is able to see things in the future or past, such as the ghosts in the hotel. Soon after moving in, and after a paralyzing winter storm that leaves the family snowbound, the father becomes influenced by the supernatural presence in the haunted hotel; he descends into madness and attempts to kill his wife and son.



Movie Review By Your Friendly Neighborhood Hyperdrive 
-----------------------------------------------------
This is another signature Kubrick film. You can expect beautiful photography and 
an excellent background music score. The script is well written and the dialogue is freely flowing. Jack Nicholson who portrays the writer and ex-schoolteacher,
gives a professional performance and thoroughly gets into the act. The character 
he portrays literally undergoes a transformation before your eyes. He is complemented well by Shelley Duvall who plays the wife of Jack's character. She portrays a simple housewife who passes her time with household chores and taking care of their only son. Danny Lloyd who plays Jack's son is simply a joy to behold throughout the film. The role fits him like a glove and his acting is simply phenomenal.  

Not to forget to mention Scatman Crothers who always gives his best to us. He is a
born actor and his presence onscreen is very powerful. The film really clicks into gear when he and Danny have a personal conversation about the Overlook Hotel over some ice-cream. And it is here that he mentions about that very special gift: The Shining....
