Hive-CM8 NOTES
Dvdscr was released yesterday! Official Bluraydate will be 29.4.2011! Now here it is :)
a lot of work around 10 hours. writing down subs from dvdscr and inserting into bluray along with adjusting timeframe. Syncing audio to the bluray which took long because of an audioglitch in the screener which forced me to remove 10sec of footage where i had no fitting audio. But you propably wont notice it because its right at the beginning, but to be fair i mentioned it. Hope you enjoy this early prerelease.
last but not least thx to Unevano who made it possible to get me the bluray faster Oh n to that numpty sindakit with all his diff names that says we rename BRrips this HQ is for you lolololol
