Story:
This addon is based on real historical events which took place during the World War II battle for Stalingrad (Now known as Volgograd). A troop of 57th infantry division stayed behind in the city after the Germans had taken it over. A few soldiers led by Gennady Lukovoi continued to deliver diversional strikes in the city and near by villages, which was very damaging to the German military machine. 

After a few months Lukovoi was captured by Germans. He was liberated in 1945 by Soviet troops, but charged with being a traitor in 1947. He was executed by shooting on November, 12, 1947.
