I'm salivating over this. I'm gonna turn of every light in the house including clocks and watch this from beginning to end."

,jacksteffel,2011-05-07T10:05Z,"How do you upload?  Do you use laptop w/ wireless, so you remain untraced?    I haven't finished downloading yet, but this seems to be the most interesting fan edit I've heard of in three years.  This is the only reason I ask: If I sent you an avi, would you upload it for me?
Thank you.
