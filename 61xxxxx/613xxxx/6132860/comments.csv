,B.KITZ,2011-01-28T10:30Z,Great up man ........ Have been looking for these ......
,DevSIN,2011-01-28T10:31Z,"@tylr : use mkvextractGUI with mkvtoolnix.. to extract the streams..then mux again without selecting the dub using mkvmerge (which will be with mkvtoolnix)

@yify : some dubs r okay.. but i already watched ""let the right one in"" & ""the girl with dragon tattoo"" in eng dub... terrible really ... bad lip synching. lesson i learned.. ""never watch Swedish movies in dub"" :D 
p.s. gluck on ur work.. will be waitin for more great movies from u ~V"
