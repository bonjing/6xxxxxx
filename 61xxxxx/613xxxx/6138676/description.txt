Fair Game 2010 BDRip XVID AC3 HQ Hive-CM8




[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Why download a touched up rip of a rip BRrip
Get the real deal BDRip
Enjoy

Dvdscr was released yesterday!
Official Bluraydate will be 29.4.2011!
Now here it is:

VideoSource: Foreign Bluray  
             Thx      
AudioSource: INKs DVDSCR Audio
             thx

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 1800 2pass
Audio: English AC3 5.1 @448
Sample: yes included
Subs: yes own hardcoded for the foreign parts, english subs taken 1:1 from DVDScr

Encode:
a lot of work around 10 hours. 
writing down subs from dvdscr and inserting into bluray along with adjusting timeframe. 
Syncing audio to the bluray which took long because of an audioglitch in the screener 
which forced me to remove 10sec of footage where i had no fitting audio. 
But you propably wont notice it because its right at the beginning, but to be fair i mentioned it.
Hope you enjoy this early prerelease.

last but not least thx to Unevano who made it possible to get me the bluray faster.[/b]

Plame's status as a CIA agent was revealed by White House officials allegedly

saying that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence about weapons 
of mass destruction to justify the invasion of Iraq.
