28.12.09 - Newcastle 1 - 5 Liverpool ! It is in the torrent."
,Scubar,2011-01-28T19:08Z,"Liverpool are a rubbish little club now trying to survive off past glory, 

They wont be winning anything and wont be playing european football next season and then Torres will leave and Gerrard will retire and Kenny will be sacked.

LOL Loserpoooool"

,aesophop,2011-03-27T05:40Z,"im assuming you have the whole games and took these from them, how can i get those games in 720p ?  have you uploaded any of the full games or do you know a different site they're on?"
,CyStefanos,2012-06-09T01:37Z,"@Scubar All you faggots when asked you say ""Oh am with Real or Barca"" but you know nothing about history of football. Liverpool is the most historic club in EPL. Am curious to see your answer when Barca and Real go down, and other big names emerge... ""Oh am with Valencia now, the best club in the world. You losers! You'll just be with what ever team is the best at the moment, cause you can't accept defeat. Defeat is part of history, if by going down means you'll get up!"
