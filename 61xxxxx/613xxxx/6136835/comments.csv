,patr3ck,2011-08-06T09:05Z,For some reason I don't have audio. Playing the vid on divx and I also have ac3filter. Help...

grey.shadow's mp4 files use the a52 codec for audio.
neither windows media player nor real player nor divx player can play the sound for the a52 codec.
only vlc can produce sound for the a52 audio codec in grey.shadows's mp4 movies!!!"
