,Saki33,2011-02-01T02:16Z,"OMG! It's awful! Amateurish is a gross understatement. I haven't seen acting this bad since grade school. Everything about it is bad, including the sound pickup. You can hear footsteps thumping all over the place from my subwoofer--really distracting. The idea for the heist was so novel I thought maybe I could manage but had to ditch less than ten minutes in. It didn't take nearly that long to see how bad it stunk but I hate to give up on any movie. I'll bet very few can make it through this one."
