,Anhelia,2011-01-29T02:10Z,Book I've been looking for for a while.  Thanks!
,thesexxxgod,2011-08-06T12:22Z,I'm a graphic designer and I'm sure this book will come in handy. Lost out on an internship earlier this year because I wasn't able to retouch as well as I do now. This book could only help me learn more. Thanks for the upload!
