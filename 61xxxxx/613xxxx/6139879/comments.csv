,DJkid90,2011-01-31T15:17Z,Can you upload Cyberlink Media Suite 9 ...
,jr153,2011-02-09T23:50Z,"Ive never had any problems with your prgms until now. This version seems to only work for awhile, like a trial version then says ""dvd copy has expired"" plus you can no longer use ""customize"" option anymore. All the versions that say ""dvd copy (gold) seem to expire even though it says ""never expires"". Is there a fix for this? Same thing happens for version 8068.."

FYI, it seems that JR153 is posting the same comment to *all* recent DVDFab torrents, so I would disregard."
,rak2011,2011-02-14T21:54Z,"works great, KK, thanx!!!!!"
,jersson,2011-02-19T14:45Z,"Yepp, very professional as usual, thank's"
,ragman420,2011-03-16T07:50Z,jr153 writes this exact same comment on other peoples DVDFab uploads.  Either he's trying to update the software after he applies the patch or he works for DVDFab.  Thanks kk.
