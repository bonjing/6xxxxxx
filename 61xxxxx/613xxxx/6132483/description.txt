The 7th Guest (1993)
--------------------

In the dawn of the CD-ROM era, a little known company named Trilobyte sets off to develop a software that aims to harness the capacity of the CD-ROM to deliver the multimedia capability of the home computer. The end result is the market hit called The 7th Guest. With its incredible graphics and sound effects, The 7th Guest is considered to be the "killer app" that heralds in the market for CD-ROM technology. Countless CD-ROM drives have been sold bundled with this software to show off the capability of the device. Yet, to some veteran gamers who see through the hype it has generated, the game mounts to little more than a disjointed collection of classic logic puzzles disguised in pretty packages. Whether this title should be praised for its achievement or damned for its failure, there can be no argument that The 7th Guest has written itself onto a page in the computer gaming history.

This time, the terror of Stauf falls on an investigator reporter whose girlfriend has mysteriously been kidnapped while investigating the Stauf mansion. Armed with a hefty production budget, can Trilobyte remake history by hailing Stauf's return? Unfortunately, not quite...
