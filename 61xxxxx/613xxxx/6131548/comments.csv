Share back your download on 20/40 torrents because they are created as small filesize encodes with 56k modem/isdn users among the TPB/torrent community.

Haven't taken one of 20/40's encodes for a while but know that's the prime motivator as to why 20/40 endeavours to the best quality in as small a filesize as possible, as 56k/isdn people get decent quality faster, as less to download.

A noble and worthy ethic and one 20/40 has every right to insist upon.

Peace. : )

And it's a please seed as long as possible if you can, but at least share back to 1 in 1 ratio, pay back what you take.

Peace. : )"

      ""hate"" low bit-rate encodes. 
      I have two monitors connected and same encode looks ugly on
      LG LED LCD but looks fantastic on normal CRT Samsung one. 
      So, move your bottoms few feet back - or download GB big encodes.
      PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.""
