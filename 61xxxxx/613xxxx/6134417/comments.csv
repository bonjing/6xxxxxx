If you've been listening to my uploads, you'll note that I usually edit out the live commecials as well as the music between breaks.

Today, while editing the 3rd hour, I noticed something very strange.  During the first live commercial (@16:49), it sounds like Glenn is having serious issues (pain) and Stu and Pat jump in to assist.  Listen carefully and let me know if you agree.  Not just to how Pat and Stu jump in, but Glenn's voice and sounds.  You can hear it almost happen again after the bottom of the hour break (@19:41).  Glenn is giving the phone number out, and it sounds like he falters and Pat starts to assist again.  He actually says half of the B during the B-E-C-K part of the phone number.

It's times like this I wish I could afford to be an Insider Extremist so I could see the video...

Thoughts?  Am I hearing things/crazy?"
