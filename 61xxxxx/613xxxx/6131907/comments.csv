,nicopicooo,2011-02-08T20:01Z,"Hi everyone
I found the SOLUTION, or atleast for me.

It's as simple as BEFORE you patch you have to Click on the type of program you want the keygen to give you (Select Sony vega 10)
And THEN you patch. 

I suspect that you have patched with the wrong program selected in the Keygen, which probably causes the problem."
,secretkosinski,2011-02-09T00:13Z,"I understand that you have to patch both the Shared Plugins folder and the normal one... but I'm confused as to what patches go where.

for all of you that is using 64x, i would just like to repeat what others have said.
after selecting the correct version of the patch, it will ask you to find two folders. first one is the 'Vegas Pro 10.0"" located in the 86x directory, then it wil ask for the 'Shared Plugins"" located in the 64x directory
@jsho123 normally xp is a 32bit os, but you can check ur os by going to control pannel>system

When you open up the key gen for the first time, you need to click on the scroll bar and select vegas 10. (that step isnt in the instructions) From there i just opened everything as an admin, and all the codes and patching worked!!!

YOU NEED TO SELECT VEGAS 10 IN THE KEYGEN B4 YOU PATCH

THX FOR THE UPLOAD KK!!!

FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS, ALONG WITH THE ONES IN THE TORRENT, AND YOU WILL BE ON YOUR WAY IN NO TIME!!!!!!"

You MUST MATCH the architecture of your system 32bit or 64bit with the installation of Vegas Pro. Otherwise the authentication code from the keygen won't work.

After step 2, you MUST COPY the ""keygen.exe"" file to the installation folder of Vegas Pro and then run it as Administrator. Don't forget to select the Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64bit series) as the program to patch/crack in the keygen window."

Had been trying for 3 hours finally figured it out. Firstly all those who got it right they can shutup THEIR HOLE.  

1) Install the software 32 or 64 bit.

2) Now to patch the program we need two folders first sony vegas pro 10.0 and shared plug-Ins. Now both these folders would be in separate locations one in C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony  and other in  C:\Program Files \Sony.

3)Now copy the keygen and paste it in both above location VERY IMPPP

4) Now open keygen and first of all select Sony vegas pro 10 x32 and x64 bit from keygen drop box--------- REMEMBER REMEMBER REMEMBER--------- to first select Sony vegas pro 10 x32 and x64 bit from keygen drop box now hit patch button and select sony vegas pro 10.0 from C:\Program Files \Sony let it patch and close keygen.

5) Now open keygen from 2nd destination that you earlier copied to C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony then patch shared plug-Ins. when patched close keygen.

6) Now rest is the same copy serial, Internet activation and enter Authentication code and hell, damn program would work.................

,hitler12,2011-04-16T01:46Z,my avg detected virus infections...
,xny675,2011-04-16T07:56Z,"Notes:

* The keygen ONLY works if you install the same version [32-bit or 64-bit] to match your version of Windows.
* Installing the x64 version means losing access to all 32-bit plugins, so if you have 32-bit directx audio plugins that you've been using with an older 32-bit version of Vegas - kiss them goodbye!  They no longer function.  Good luck finding x64 audio plugins [from most companies they don't exist yet]
* Same goes for system video codecs - if you're using 32-bit codecs you'll have to update them to x64 or kiss them goodbye

This is all rather disappointing.  I have Win7 x64, and because I -have- to install the x64 version for the keygen to work, the upgrade is made useless by the loss of all my audio plugins.

If you don't use plugins or exotic codecs everything will work fine if you follow the instructions."
,xny675,2011-04-16T08:21Z,"ADDENDUM - if you need the 32 bit version on Window x64, do this:

* install the 32-bit [x86] version and patch it with the keygen but don't do anything else [don't attempt to register it, it won't work]
* install the x64 version as per the instructions [using the keygen and all]

You now have working 32-bit AND 64-bit versions."

Due to the way some (more and more) cracks and keygens work they will trigger a virus alert.  Often a false positive.  This isn't helped by the fact that anti-virus companies are getting kickbacks for marking the more common types (or specifically known) keygens and cracks as viruses as a means  to combat piracy.

Don't ever bite the hand that feeds you. Even if there was a mistake EVERYTHING is fixable. Your job is just to figure out how if you want the free software.

I had the same issue as you and you are partially correct in the fact there are registry values that are added.

Since you seem to be unable to find these values, I suggest you do it the easy way and install this:
http://www.revouninstaller.com/download-professional-version.php
(If you like the software you can find the full version here, but it is not necessary: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5622378/Revo_Uninstaller_Pro_2.2.3___crack_-TrT)

Once installed, uninstall the Sony Vegas Pro you installed AND deleted all the entries with an ""advanced"" scan when it comes to that point.


Navigate to your installed Sony directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony) and delete this unless you have other Sony programs installed. If that is the case, just delete the Sony Vegas 10 and shared plugins folders.

If you still have the ""Register Vegas Pro.htm"" or whatever you saved the other computer registration as, delete that, where ever you saved it.

Once again install the program following the instructions (Make sure you choose the proper bit program installation based on your system), but this time, make sure you run the patcher with the correct program (Patch the program within programs files and the shared plugins within the x86 program files).

If you wish, uninstall revo uninstaller. If not, keep it and do what you will. It's a helpful tool to those who cannot find the data themselves. Keep in mind that is only a FREE trial version."

1. Disable your anti virus for a little while
2. extract both the 32bit and 64bit version to your desktop

4. run the installer as administrator
5. choose to install this version (dont update)
6. when installed don't run the program yet, but run the keygen as administrator
7. wait 10 seconds and press continue. at the top below ""Product name"" choose ""Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64 bit) series
8. click ""Patch""
9. when installing the 64bit version select the sony/vegas pro 10 map in Program Files and then the Sony/Shared Plug-Ins map in Program Files (x86)
when installing the 32bit version select both maps in Program Files (x86)/sony
10. Once patching is done, DO NOT CLOSE THE KEYGEN. 
11. open Sony Vegas Pro, just follow instructions using the serial from the keygen. register from another computer. register using invalid information. save the reg file somewhere, you can delete it after. use the activation code that belongs to the serial. 

12. you should now be able to start the program.

,quenton,2011-06-20T09:05Z,"Hey mate, well I have found the reason I cant get this to work. For some reason I when I downloaded this torrent , the keygen didn't have ""Sony Vegas 10.0"", only 9.0 and below. Do you have a copy of a keygen that does have 10.0 ? It would be appreciated. Cheers."
,blazemoar,2011-06-20T22:30Z,"follow the instructions to the letter and you will get a flawless install. also make sure to turn off the anti-virus during install (the keygen is safe, but they will complain anyway)

,tech.33,2011-06-23T01:42Z,"Works!! Thanks for the upload. For anyone having trouble follow the instructions from @penusplant they helped me allot:

""bit more detailed instructions:
1. Disable your anti virus for a little while
2. extract both the 32bit and 64bit version to your desktop
3. im pretty sure i have 32bit, but that didnt work for me, 64bit did. so you should try the x64 one first
4. run the installer as administrator
5. choose to install this version (dont update)
6. when installed don't run the program yet, but run the keygen as administrator
7. wait 10 seconds and press continue. at the top below ""Product name"" choose ""Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64 bit) series
8. click ""Patch""
9. when installing the 64bit version select the sony/vegas pro 10 map in Program Files and then the Sony/Shared Plug-Ins map in Program Files (x86)
when installing the 32bit version select both maps in Program Files (x86)/sony
10. Once patching is done, DO NOT CLOSE THE KEYGEN.
11. open Sony Vegas Pro, just follow instructions using the serial from the keygen. register from another computer. register using invalid information. save the reg file somewhere, you can delete it after. use the activation code that belongs to the serial. """

,Liamd11,2011-06-23T17:48Z,"Great torrent!

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO DOWNLOADERS:

1.When installing DO NOT click on the option to download the newer version as the registration with the keygen WILL NOT work, make sure you INSTALL CURRENT VERSION.

2.For people who cannot open the keygen, disable any anti-virus programs like AVG, Kaspersky, Norton etc, and make sure you right click on the keygen and RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.

Many thanks to kentucky-kid for the upload,

Liam."
,Liamd11,2011-06-23T17:52Z,"ALSO, if your anti-virus notifies you as the keygen being a virus (or whatever), IGNORE IT, most anti-viruses try to block keygens simply because they are keygens, NOT VIRUSES!"

After step 2, you MUST COPY the ""keygen.exe"" file to the installation folder of Vegas Pro and then run it as Administrator. Don't forget to select the Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64bit series) as the program to patch/crack in the keygen window.

how do i fix?"
,medikonroids,2011-07-04T15:02Z,"OK I JUST GOT IT FIXED!
what you do is follow the instructions given except a few details are missing.
Before you click ""patch"", first change the product name via the drop down bar to ""Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64 bit) series
then click Patch.
the first directory is **C:/Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 10.0**
The Second Directory is **C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony\Shared Plug-Ins**
If the patch starts to take a few seconds or minutes it means its working (as far as i know)
then folllow everything according to the instructions.
This fixes the Activation / Authentication problem i and most other people have/had...
Hope this helps"

1st you run the program for win 32 or 64
once you hit crack,that bitch with the big tits com on.Whatever code you try is wrong because all SN# start with 1k8.Anyways a windows key code will pop up in your REG windows files.If you are not sure how to change the value.Dont wast your time because you will fuck your pc up.

For the programers
Q. How can I use BitLocker, TrueCrypt or another boot manager?
A. First setup the software and then install the loader with the option selected to preserve the current boot code.

 I installed the loader and rebooted but I'm not activated. The loader application displays the message ""BAD SLIC SIZE"" or ""BAD SLIC DATA"", can I fix it?
A. Uninstall the loader, power down and then boot up the system again. Go to the applications advanced options and select to ignore the existing SLIC and then press install.

All done :P

,miccola,2011-10-24T05:41Z,"I guarantee you this torrent is perfect if you install and patch correctly!  I made some in-depth instructions for anyone having troubles.  (By the way, keygens are very commonly classified as trojans by antivirus software, so I recommend you turn yours off until the install is complete.  This keygen is 100% clean.)

1. Open up the .rar file, extract it anywhere (your desktop).  If you have 32-bit windows, extract the installer and keygen files from the ""x32"" file, and vice versa for 64-bit.  If you aren't sure which you have, right-click on ""Computer"" in the start menu and click ""Properties,"" it will tell you there.

2. Run the installer for Sony Vegas Pro 10.0.  It will ask you if you want to download and install a newer version, but just install the current version instead.  It'll take a few minutes.

3.  When it's done installing, don't open up the Vegas program yet, but instead right-click on the Keygen and click ""Run as administrator.""  Wait for 10 seconds, click continue in the bottom right corner.  (Don't close the keygen throughout this entire process.)

4.  MAKE SURE under ""Product Name"" in the drop-down menu, you change it to ""Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series"".  If you don't change that, it won't patch correctly, won't give you a correct serial, and you'll have to uninstall and reinstall Vegas and do it over again!

5.  Click ""Patch.""  In the first Window, navigate to ""C:/Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 10.0"" and click on that folder, then ""OK.""  In the next window, same thing, but click on the folder ""C:/Program Files/Sony/Shared Plug-Ins""

6.  It'll work on patching the program for a couple of minutes.  When it's done, leave the keygen open, and open up Vegas Pro 10 now.

7.  It'll ask you to register, just copy the serial number from the keygen.  (If the keygen's serial doesn't start with ""1R8,"" you didn't change the product name before you patched, so start over with a fresh install.)

8.  Vegas will prompt you to  ""Register Online"" or ""Register from another computer"" or ""Register later.""  Choose ""Register from another computer,"" click ""Next"" a few times.

9.  This bit wasn't explained well, but put in FAKE info when Vegas asks for your info.  I put ""User"" for the first name, ""User"" for the last name, a fake email, and some foreign tropical country for the region.  If you try to use the US or UK as your region, it won't let you continue!  Make sure the last checkbox is checked and continue.

10.  Save this regfile (HTML file) wherever, I put it on my Desktop.  It doesn't matter.

11.  Copy and paste the Activation Code from the keygen.  If you followed everything correctly, it WILL work.

Vegas Pro 10.0 is now fully installed and registered!  Open it up and start editing!"

,rune14,2011-12-06T19:59Z,"Finally found the solution to activation code problem :

after patching the files don't open vegas pro directly,

first open a notepad and copy down the serial number and activation code then close the keygen

now open vegas pro and follow rest of instructions and copy the code from notepad and complete registration, i worked for me it may work for you too.

I REPEAT DON'T KEEP KEYGEN OPEN WHILE REGISTERING IF YOU GET ACTIVATION CODE ERROR"
,DminDmax,2011-12-07T02:06Z,"Took a little reading ahead of miccola's notes, but it does work and is running.  When you get to the last instruction.. copy the Authentica..., you need to do this as this is pasted in the field when you start SVegas the first time.

Also, That authentication number is not just the number you see, scroll to the right all the way. This is an alphanumeric code of 54 digits, excluding the dashes. So if you come up with only 36 digits, go back.

,Sylerxen,2011-12-11T22:21Z,"Okay, people. Here's the OFFICIAL BREAKDOWN of what to do about the authentication code problem.

1) MAKE SURE WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU DO IT    WITH ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES. THAT MEANS OPEN EVERYTHING AS ""RUN AS ADMIN"".

2) FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS up until you have to activate your KEYGEN. Guy's everything you need is RIGHT IN THE INSTRUCTIONS so don't come back here saying that it wasn't!

3) Make sure that when you click ""patch"" on the keygen that you path in the CORRECT DIRECTORIES! i.e. Patch to VEGAS PRO 10.0 FIRST THEN PATCH TO SHARED PLUG-INS.

4) There shouldn't be a problem unless you haven't been running everything as admin! And you HAVENT BEEN READING THE DIRECTIONS!

REASONS ON WHY THIS DIDN'T WORK:

1) YOU DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.
2) YOU CAN'T READ
2) YOUR COMPUTER IS SHIT
3) YOUR COMPUTER IS A DELL
4) WHICH MEANS YOUR SHIT
5) YOU STILL DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!
6) AND WORST OF ALL YOU DIDN'T READ THE COMMENTS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING!

And something else...If you mess up, don't uninstall and then re-install. Your wasting your time. Simply quit your registration attempt and close the keygen. It'll be like starting fresh when you open both again. And make sure you CHOOSE VEGAS PRO 10.0 ON THE KEYGEN BEFORE YOU PATCH ANY FILES BECAUSE ONCE YOU ATTEMPT TO PATCH ONCE IT WONT LET YOU DO IT AGAIN EVEN IF YOU CHOSE THE WRONG SOFTWARE TO PATCH! Thats where closing the keygen and registration comes in. When in doubt, just close them both and start again.

This is from my real experience not so long ago, guys. Literally it was like 30 minutes ago.

You have to uninstall Vegas Pro 10, since you gave it a serial number when you installed it and that serial number won't be connected to the new authentication code. 

So, uninstall (add/remove program in control panel works fine), then follow the instructions again, but make sure you right click the keygen and run as administrator, and do the same when you run Vegas Pro. "
,mormandy3,2012-03-19T01:20Z,"Having Problems? I can help. First, to the arrogant jerks who said ""if you just follow the instructions it will work, if not you are stupid or your computer is junk"".....

My computer is an I7 sandybridge with SSD raid and 16g of ram, and this didn't work at first? Why? How about this....THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FUCKED UP, not the people having problems. 

What everyone needs to realize is that first of all the ""shared plugins folder"" path in the instructions is WRONG. It is not in program files, it is in program files (x86). Second, there is an omission that really can fuck someone up. It fails to tell the user to make sure to SELECT VEGAS PRO 10 OUT OF A LARGE LIST OF UNRELATED PROGRAMS. If you DON'T do this at first, and then patch with some other program, even though you change the program to the correct one later, it's too late and you can't generate codes that are good because the program was patched incorrectly. If you patched with the wrong program name (wrong program selected by default), you must uninstall the program and delete the Sony folder in program files before starting again. Do it again, correctly. 

As others mentioned earlier, you MUST FIRST, BEFORE RUNNING THE KEYGEN, RIGHT CLICK ""RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR"" AND LET IT RUN THAT WAY. 

If you do these things, it will work. 

Though the instructions were a FAIL and I figured it out as many obviously have, I want everyone to be aware of these things, and more importantly to THANK the uploader of this torrent."

I've installed countless programs with keygens just like this with no problem, but no matter how many times I tried to install this, following all the instructions and reading through pages of these comments, it never worked. Always got stuck on the authentication.

10.) Select ""Register from another computer"", and enter fake info.

11.) Save the file, you can delete after it is activated.

12.) NOW copy and paste your authentication code from the keygen into your Vegas registration screen.
