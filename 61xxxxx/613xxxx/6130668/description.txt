Keedie Green (maiden name 'Babb') (born 21 October 1982, in Wolverhampton) is a British classical crossover soprano, with three octaves in her voice that reaches a top A above a top E.

She was baptised as Keedie because her father is a fan of Kiki Dee. The family moved to Torquay when she was three years old and she subsequently attended White Rock Primary school in Paignton.

Her father had an intermittent work as a painter and decorator, paying for his daughter's vocal lessons while narrowly avoiding bankruptcy, until one Christmas when bankruptcy made the family temporarily homeless. Keedie left school when she was 14 years old to pursue a singing career, signing her first record contract when she was 16 years old, but soon became disillusioned and left to pursue her career alone.
