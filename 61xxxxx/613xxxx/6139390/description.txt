Top gear - series 16 episode 2 BBC HD 1080 30-01-2011

Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May go head-to-head against their  opposite numbers from Australian Top Gear in a car-based version of The Ashes. With disciplines including rallying, drifting and an Aussie version of double-decker car racing, it's an all-out grudge match that will almost certainly end in tears. Also in the show, Jeremy is on the test track in Ferrari's new 599 GTO and another celebrity guest takes their turn as the star in a Reasonably Priced Car.
