,ForUniden,2011-02-01T02:41Z,@FatherBallbag. There seems to be a problem with the link on TPB's side. The magnet link works fine though.
,something_for_kev,2011-02-03T13:37Z,actually the magnet link has no files in it...that's what's wrong
,ForUniden,2011-02-04T01:43Z,"@something_for_kev. The magnet link adds one of the trackers for me (missing the other two). According to the forums, TPB seems to be having a lot of server-side problems at the moment, meaning that the .torrent file was incorrectly hosted and I cannot edit the link. However one tracker should be enough anyway. Maybe your problem is client-side?"
,melvinsp,2011-02-07T21:25Z,"@something_for_kev: I had the same thing; when I opened the Magnet Link in uTorrent, file seemed empty, but left it there and it was downloading within half an hour.  Worth getting, if for nothing else, because the Adrian Lux version is better."

,ForUniden,2011-02-10T08:43Z,@malouphix use the magnet link and be patient.
