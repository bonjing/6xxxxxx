,cm0nster6,2011-01-30T03:04Z,is this for Linux? I hope it is!
,bl0nk,2011-01-30T22:38Z,Working 100% on 64bit Windows7. Thank you.
,ozkan2007,2011-02-23T01:59Z,Thank you! It works with Windows 7 x64
,poo4532,2011-03-13T06:14Z,"easy install, works great on xp tablet edition. thanks a lot!"
,boxplox,2011-04-03T20:18Z,"If the included instructions are not clear enough:
1) Run ""Maple14WindowsInstaller.exe"" or, if you run 64 bits, the equivalent the in 64 bits folder. Do not run Maple already.

2) Run ""Maple1401WindowsUpgrade.exe"" or the 64 bits equivalent if you installed 64 bits. Do not run Maple already.

3) The crack part: copy the cracked maple.dll to:
%MAPLEDIR%/bin.X86_64_WINDOWS/
This folder is where you installed Maple 14 (by default, Program Files. Under a 64 bits Windows, if you installed the 32 version, look under Program Files (x86)).
(this is the 64 bits path. adjust for 32 if needed)
You made a copy of the original in case of screw ups did you?

4) Copy license.dat to %MAPLEDIR%/license/ (again, under the Maple installation folder). There shouldn't be an original ""license.dat"".

You can now use Maple. Is it recommended to disable auto-update (from the options) and disable Maple Cloud. Those instructions are noob proof. If you fail these, you do not deserve to use a computer."
