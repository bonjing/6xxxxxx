US Marshal Teddy Daniels has come to Shutter Island, home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Along with his partner Chuck he sets out to find an escaped patient, a murderess name Rachel Solando, as a hurricane bears down upon them. But nothing at Ashecliffe Hospital is what it seems, and disappearing patients isnâ€™t the only secret the island hides. The closer they get to the truth though, the more elusive it becomes, and the more they fear that someone doesnâ€™t want them to leave Shutter Island alive!
