FreeArc is a modern general-purpose archiver.
Main advantage of FreeArc is fast but efficient compression and rich set of features.
FreeArc works 2-5 times faster than best other compression programs.

Advantages
- Free, open-source, with console and GUI versions for both Windows and Linux
- Includes LZMA, PPMD, TrueAudio and generic Multimedia compression algorithms
  with automatic switching by file type
- Filters that further improve compression: REP (finds repetitions at the 
  distances up to 1gb), DICT (dictionary replacements for texts), DELTA 
  (improves compression of tables in binary data), BCJ (executables 
  preproccesor) and LZP (removes repetitions in texts)
- Special compression algorithms are used in fast compression modes 
  (GRZIP for texts and Tornado for binary data)
- Overall, 11 compression algorithms and filters are included 
  (compared to 3 in 7-zip and 7 in RAR) and this number still grows
- Smart file sorting that groups similar files together and fully customizable 
  sorting order (see below) further improve compression
- Typically, FreeArc works 2-5 times faster than best programs in each compression 
  class (ccm, 7-zip, rar, uharc -mz, pkzip) while retaining the same 
  compression ratio; from technical grounds, it's superior to any existing 
  practical compressor
- Moreover, you can use any external program as compressor or filter as easy 
  as internal ones, with Precomp, ECM, CCM(x), PPMonstr, Durilca, LPAQ, UDA 
  and PAQ are already preconfigured in arc.ini as shipped
- You can fine-tune settings for each compression algorithm, and which 
  compression algorithms are used for each type of files; you can create 
  new compression profiles and modify existing ones; use -dic$ option in 
  order to see all details of compression used

Features
- Solid compression with smart updates (only changed solid blocks are recompressed)
- User-definable solid block size (-s:) and file sorting order (-ds:), including 
  customized filename ordering (arc.groups)
- AES/Blowfish/Twofish/Serpent encryption with keyfiles support and ability to 
  chain multiple ciphers (-p, -hp, --keyfile, --encryption=ALGORITHMS)
- FAR and Total Commander plugins allow to create/browse/extract archives using the 
  file manager interface
- Ability to create SFX (self-extracted) archives and installers
- Ability to list/extract archives directly from Internet: 
  arc x http://freearc.org/demo/arc.arc *.h
- Archive protection and recovery, including recovery over Internet driven by 
  CRCs of archive sectors (r/rr/-rr/--original=URL)
- Ability to test archive before and after any operation (-tp/-t), including
  checking 
  by recovery record and full archive test
- Moving to archive (m), joining archives (j), archive recompression (ch), 
  locking (k) and commenting (-z/cw)
- Select files by size, time/age and name (-sl, -sm, -ta, -tb, -tn, -to, -n), 
  select by/clear ARCHIVE file attribute (-ao/-ac)
- Base directory on disk / inside archive (-dp/-ap), automatic generation of archive 
  filenames (-ag)
- Errors and warnings are reported to stderr and reflected in program exit code; 
  --logfile option saves to the file all the information displayed
- Configurable via arc.ini file and FREEARC environment variable; alternative 
  settings may be selected by means of -cfg/-env options
