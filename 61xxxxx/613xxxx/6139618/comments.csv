,astoncrude,2011-01-31T06:28Z,"@weeping reaper no, you're not. you're a fucking tool. the kind of people like you who get amused by ruining other peoples fun for no reason is fucking bullshit. how do you enjoy knowing you've ruined something that people get excited for? how is that funny? how do you laugh knowing that you're a stupid cunt?"
,fknhell,2011-01-31T06:40Z,At least I won't have to bother watching this crap now. Wrestling is still in the hole it dug 10 years ago.
,weaping_reaper,2011-01-31T07:20Z,"@ Astrocrud, GET OVER IT, 


Ya Jackwagon!"
,hentek,2011-01-31T07:22Z,"if anyone was wondering the quality of the torrent, its good, just a little choppy but still very good"

,GenadiOG,2011-01-31T08:13Z,"Shock weaping_reaper  likes The Miz, it's sad that these shitty gay kids are watching wrestling now. Sad indeed"
,astoncrude,2011-01-31T08:36Z,"@weaping reaver like, how can you tell me to get over it you stupid fucking cunt? i was looking forward to this all week, and i go to download it and the first comment is you spoiling it. what fucking reason could you possibly have? no, i wont get over it, because im fucking pissed off that the drama and excitement of the match will now be taken away because you are a complete fucking cunt. i bet in real life you're a fucking coward with no backbone, you worthless cocksucking piece of shit."
,mattant79,2011-01-31T09:17Z,"Its no good, Dont bother downloading it, Its playing too fast and out of sync, Thanks for spoiling it awsell dickhead."
,TheNarrator23,2011-01-31T10:59Z,"@ weaping_reaper: thanks alot you shithead. Was going to watch it tonight and now my evening is ruined. Why would I even bother watching it now, for those 3 lame title matches, that you already know the reslut of even before they start? Go do something usefull an fucking die, so you make place for people who are fun."

,ecorg911,2011-02-01T01:16Z,"weaping reaper - your a 14 year old fag, that's no reason to spoil it for everyone else. Grow up and get a life."
,luffarungen,2011-02-01T01:42Z,"weapign reaper: when I get hold of your IP-adres, I'll track u down and send u a few viruses as thanks for your spoiler.

then come back and say you still find it funny to fuck with ppl. Good luck, I'll give a 3 days until I make your computer into putty"
,weaping_reaper,2011-02-01T02:14Z,@ luffarungen .. good luck home boi!
,weaping_reaper,2011-02-01T03:58Z,"@GenadiOG, 1. I'm not sad  2. You don't know me, 3. I'm not even close to being fat. and 4. Fuck my mom till the cows come home brotha, I could care less. 

@ecorg911 . I'm 23 dude, 23, not 14. You suck at guessing.. Stop trying. Also... I'm not a ""fag"" you failed again.

@luffarungen... Well you basically just fucked yourself, you better hope I don't accidentally get a virus within the next couple weeks because I have your lil ""threat"" right here on this page.

@Everyone else.. I have the freedom of speech! and FUCK any of you that want to try to take that away from me. If you see !!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!! and you STILL read it.. Then don't get mad at me because yer a dumbass!"
,Junoon46,2011-02-01T21:23Z,"@weaping_reaper 

Why did you do that ?
It was really annoying. The RR is once a year & you spoiled it form the most.
My 1st guest would be that you work at the WWE & you angry with the DVD sales because of the torrent.

Will, whatever was your cause, Your IP is my target, be ALERT>>>>> Like you said "
,Decker74,2011-02-02T05:03Z,"Writing comment so hopefully we can push the comments to Page 2, so therefore the Spoiler won't ruin it for others. Douchebag."
,weaping_reaper,2011-02-05T10:47Z,"So these guys are serious.. I've been attacked by viruses lately, for real.. 
Well, guess what.. If I go down, you bet your ass I'll be on every motherfuckin goddamn WWE torrent spreading spoilers all my Goddamn life... Yeah, So I was drunk one night and decided  to spread the GODDAMN word that a Mothafukkin BAD GUY won the Royal Rumble, So you guys that was hoping a good guy won wouldn't get disappointed. yeah.. I deserve a virus for that? 

If I go down, I'll spoil every Goddamn WWE event from not till I die. Believe That.."
