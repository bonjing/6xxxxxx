I have and NVIDIA 9800GTX+ and I crash at the same spot in chapter 7 at the solar array.
If anyone remembers the same sort of thing happened with Batman Arkham Asylum when it first came out and the first crack was released. You got to one spot where there was an invisible wall that wouldn't let you through. Pretty far into the game if I recall too.
