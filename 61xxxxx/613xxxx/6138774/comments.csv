Well, I kinda made an account to thank you for the great things you have done. So, THANK YOU SO MUCH! lol. I was wondering if you could upload...
Guns of Icarus
and
BioShock.

THANKS - again"
,MacManJr.,2011-01-30T20:24Z,"thanks for all the stuff, but could you start downloading some games :) maybe Bioshock or Borderlands please :D"
,EightLegs,2011-01-31T02:40Z,"Yes, we want games! I feel that everyone can play a game but only a fraction of people can find a use for a specific app. Not to say that apps are not wanted but games are more universal. Bioshock, Call of Duty, or LEGO Harry Potter would be awesome. If those are can't be attained, anything racing would be much appreciated. Thanks droidip!"
