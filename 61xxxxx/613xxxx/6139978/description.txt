One Night Only

I have in my possession a Bee Gee's Concert video and I'll tell you, that it's one of the best performances the Bee Gee's ever done together. It's just an amazing piece of musical and the vocals are legendary! 
I'm fiftyeight today but like going back to those times. 
The special appearances of celebrities at the concert by people like Celine Dion as well as Olivia Newton-John is just a big bonus.
