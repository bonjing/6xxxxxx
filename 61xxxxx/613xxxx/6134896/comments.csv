,oldtimer48,2011-07-16T02:52Z,"Your subs work well, there is no good copy of  the trilogy ""The girl who played with fire"", ""The girl who kicked the hornet's nest"", etc as all comments are critical of the subs not working.  Your subs in Babel and Lebanon are spot on, perhaps you might consider doing the girl who played with fire trilogy as others don't appear to have succeeded with it. Keep up the good work and thanks."
