,martina909,2011-01-30T20:39Z,"if you have not noticed this TPB is a site where torrents are uploaded. no one gives a crap about what you think and if you can jerk off to some actress. if you want to make a comment about the QUALITIY like it's supposed to be do it, but if you just want to make your stupid ass oppinions that no one gives a crap about go find some chat room and write your stupid ass comments to someone that wants to read them.

,Zegunda,2011-01-31T14:36Z,@zakimar- Isn't Anna Paquin married the guy who plays Bill on True Blood?  I don't think she's a lesbo.
,phoenixeb,2011-01-31T14:49Z,"Same here.  The only reason I use Piratebay is because of the comments.  Sure a lot of them are pointless, but I like hearing what others have to say regarding their opinions about the movie.  As long as they try to include something relevant, like A/V."
,ronbabby,2011-01-31T15:15Z,thanks and fast download keep up the great work
,spadlo1,2011-01-31T20:53Z,"Paquin is a lesbian? Funny, she doesn't taste like one."
,starlight_midnight,2011-01-31T21:25Z,"She came out as bisexual, not a lesbian... plus she is married to Stephen Moyer who plays Bill on True Blood."
,bragazar1710,2011-02-01T12:54Z,thanks.
,SpiritWolfe,2011-03-13T10:29Z,@Zegunda - I think so. -OR-  They are at least dating each other. Shit! I would date her too! >:)
,SpiritWolfe,2011-03-13T10:37Z,"@phoenixeb - I agree with you on the comments. This is one of the rare and far between UNCENSORED forum-type boards that we can say 'What the Fuck' and people not give two flying fucks about how and what we say. I mean, like you said, as long as there is something of a point the person's ranting and raving, right?
