The Techniques of Syd Mead 2 - Value Sketching

This lesson introduces the viewer to the process of creating the Value Preliminary. Using a series of grey to black markers, Syd shows you how to illustrate your image once you've determined the picture composition and sketch views. He guides the artist through a step-by-step process of choosing the best view and, using only a series of nine grey markers, he shows how to create a value system for your illustration, explaining that the more you establish your value range at this stage, the more you ensure the visual sense of your final picture. Using felt tip markers of varying values, Syd guides the user through the process of creating detail, blocking shadows, indicating highlights and defining the detail on the Value Preliminary.
