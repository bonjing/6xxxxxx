Is there any video quality loss when converted?

Thank you very much for putting this up, I just don't feel like testing it right now."
,charincol,2011-01-29T17:57Z,"There is no video loss at all because there is no re-encoding of the video codec.

This strips it out of the MKV container, and puts it into an MP$ container.

Only the audio is re-encoded, because the 360 doesn't support anything other than AAC inside an MP4 container."
,charincol,2011-01-29T19:29Z,"MP4, not MP$, damn shift button!"
,Gumy,2011-01-30T13:13Z,"Yes, I understood that from description. I was just wondering how this turned out to be for those who tried it. cheers"

,charincol,2012-02-26T08:08Z,"Of course it has a virus! If you knew anything about ThinApp packages, then your dumbass would understand that even if it had a virus, it'd be sandboxed within the virtual environment that ThinApp created. Go fuck yourself douchebag."
