Thank you, been searching for this for a long time "
,thebest19,2011-02-11T22:36Z,how am i supposed to extract this? i tried with winrar and left it overnight when i got up this morning it only 24% complete. i dont know what you did but ive never had a rar file take that long before
,arcadepcnut,2011-02-12T04:03Z,"put in folder bces00001 
works fine. yes it will take a while to extract in 8 hours 24% seems excessive amount of time. quad core 3.2 6gb ram extracted it in about 4 hours."
,thebest19,2011-02-12T05:33Z,my computer is pretty slow pentium 3 with like 300 mb ram. i just have never seen it take this long. in fact ive never come across one that took more than a half hour. weird. must just be how its compressed. 
,blfunser,2011-05-16T20:51Z,takes a day to extract why the fuck would you mess it up no other rar is like this!!!!!!!!
,JusticeGFX,2011-06-15T10:21Z,"Downlaod complete in like 5 days at 100 kb/s 60 GB uploaded and i will still seed , extraction takes about 6 hours i don't know why..."
,xaleeeeeel,2011-10-16T05:06Z,what kind of raring is this 8 hours to extract!!!!!
