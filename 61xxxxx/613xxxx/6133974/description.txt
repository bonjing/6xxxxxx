This is a collection of the files that I made in 2010 for my friends that are learning English.

The song lyrics each have a weblink for listening to the song on YouTube while reading the words along with explanations of various slang or references in the songs.
The MP3's have text that accompanies them. Some were from vocabulary lists that my friends either sent to me or that I made up while talking to them. Some are very, very specific while most are general. Most of my friends are Spanish speaking so the mistakes that I focused on with these are more directed that way, even though there are other language learning partners from whom I gather vocabulary selections.

I have also included a text file of some great resources. There are weblinks and suggestions. Many are multi-language so they can be helpful those of us studying something besides English.

I hope these are helpful to some folks out there.

Good luck with your learning.
