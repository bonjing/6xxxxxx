,lp-man,2011-02-04T16:51Z,"No offence to the uploader, but your english installation guide is very confusing.

Here's what I did:
1. Mounted the ""logcstudio.cdr""
2. On the mounted drive I right clicked ""Install Logic Studio"" and selected ""Make Alias"" option
3. Previous step created a file called ""LogicStudio.mpkg"", which I copied to the Desktop
4. Found the patch file called ""LogicStudio_noSN Installer Patch"" and double clicked it. At this point nothing happened. The opening animation appeared, yet nothing changed. There was no new window.

This is where I got stuck and have no idea what to do next. Help anyone?"
,mbex9ak2,2011-02-05T18:22Z,"hi there! i'm new to mac and need ur help. is there any opportunities to give more detailed information about installation, for example which application should be used in order to open file .cdr, and so on... Thanks!"

,lp-man,2011-02-09T12:15Z,"@ Carlos_M

,powerade11,2011-03-05T09:09Z,"@webchella
@djtopher 
Thanks So much!!!

SO after a long time i got it to work finally so heres how i did it. First 
1) instead of double clicking the install icon, i right clicked the ""install logic..."" and clicked on make a alias(i didnt know what "".cdr"" ment)
2) i pasted it to desktop
3) i downloaded the patch from @djtopher, i opened his folder and copy ALL his files and pasted it to Untitled/Library/Application Support/ProApps
4) and i also copy and past the cracks that the first file came with (i just did that cuz it didnt work the first time, but im sure u dont need to do it)
5) i then double clickd ""LogicStudiog.kmp"" from desktop (the first time i needed CD's at the end of the instlation)
6) now the part im fuzzy with but most important!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! when it gives you the option to check off what you want i believe i unchecked logic pro content! 2 boxes maybe, idk- cuz the first time it asked for CD's. i noticed when i tried to install again, a window poped up sayin before hand that i am going to need CDs. so when i unchecked a couple boxes, the window didnt pop up to warn me.so mess around to see what box to uncheck. then it worked!!!!! alll the way! i opened the files and it seems to work. no Serial needed but i just dont know how to work the program so idk "
,Indiandan,2011-03-10T16:55Z,"Hey, I just tried to install this on my mac, and what I got was an .ISO file to install with, so I did, and I copied a serial off another torrent, but now the installer asks me for a ""audio content 1"" disc, which it needs to install, does anyone know how to override this, or should i go back and ONLY install pro logic 9, and none of the extra programs/extra tools?

Thanks for the upload, it was a fast DL with lots of seeders, if i get this to work im seeding it!"
,chaottic,2011-03-14T23:21Z,"downloaded this a while back, thank you but as most of the people here i couldn't install it properly..

2) click right on the ""install logic studio"" alias and make showing the original
3) copy ""logicstudio.mpkg"" on desktop and open it with the ""logicstudio_installer patch""
4) successfull? ok so you have to copy ""logicstudio.mpkg"" (cracked version on your desktop) to the image mounted and overwrite with the original !
5) then just run the installer and enjoy it ;)"

,Cryonik,2011-06-13T19:53Z,"Help! 

I've tried everything! But i keep getting the message;

The installation failed. 

The installer encountered and error that caused the installation to fail. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance.

Now, their solution isn't really helpful so I'm hoping i can get some help here :P

When they asked me what i wanted to install, I've tried checking everything and also only checking Logic Pro. The all produce the same result. And this error message comes out almost instantly after i hit the install button. 

I've pasted djtopher's crack to Pro Apps folder and it also didn't work. I didn't even get a prompt for CD-Keys. Also, the patches that come with this torrent didn't work at all. When I double click them, there's an animation on the dock showing activity but nothing happens..?

I have a 2010 MBP 13"". I've triple checked the basic reqs and i'm pretty darn sure i'm not lacking anything so this is really really annoying. 

Any help is greatly appreciated!!! "

,colonel_irv,2011-07-03T22:19Z,"For all those in need:
1. Make an alias of the installer and put it on your desktop.
2. Run the installer off your desktop and get to the point where it wants you to enter your name and serial number,etc and STOP - leave this screen up!
3. Bring up the folder that contains the patches.
4. Run the LogicStudio_Installer Patch.
5. Drag the screen where they want your serials over to the patch window and drop serial screen in the box, it should load and let you know everything's been patched.
6. Rerun the installer alias that you had originally needed serials for and if you don't need to enter that crap, you're good to go so far.
7. Where it asks you what you do & don't want to install, uncheck mainstage, because there is no patch for it.
8. Proceed to install.
9. Once installed, don't run it - go back to your patch folder and run the Logic Pro_9_Intel Patch.
10. With the patch window still up, open your finder and search for Logic Pro 9 and drag the file into the patch window.
11. Repeat previous steps with the remaining programs and you should be good to go. Enjoy.

P.S. Apple, this is for being a pain in the ass, fuck you."

,cypherpunk123,2012-03-16T12:31Z,"TO FIX ""PATCH NOT OPENING"" PROBLEM:

If you double click on the ""Installer Patch"" and nothing happens (i.e. no app window opens), do the following:
1) Open a Terminal (under Applications/Utilities)
2) 'cd' to the 'Patch' folder of the torrent (generally this will be something like 'cd ~/Documents/Downloads/Logic*/Patch'). Once in this directory, if you type 'ls' you should see a list of various Patch.app directories and the REAME.txt
3) type the following command (you can use tab completion to avoid typing out each full directory name): 'chmod 755 */Contents/MacOS/iPatcher' 
4) go back to the Finder window & double-click the patch applications, & they should open."

,2Cojones,2012-05-08T02:29Z,"Snow Leopard 10.6.8. EASY METHOD to load Pro Logic 9.1.7 that WILL NOT ask for Serial #:
Use Webchella’s .iso, but don’t use the patches webchella provided. Instead:
FIRST: 
1)Make sure you have the latest “PRO KIT” (free from Apple/support).
2)Download and install crack [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5635830/Logic_Studio_9.1.1_Pro_Apps_Crack].
3)Copy the contents of the crack into the folder [Macintosh HD(or whatever your volume name is)/Library/Application Support/ProApps], overwriting any old files with same names.
SECOND:
1.Download & unpack the Webchella  torrent [LogicStudio.iso]
2. Click [LogicStudio.iso] to install. 
3. Follow install instructions and select “Custom” installation when asked.
4. When selecting “custom” content, on the box that states ""Logic Studio Content"" click it (twice?) so that the space required on your hard drive will go from 54GB to around 8 or 9GB (+/-) then click continue and install. I also unchecked [Mainstage] just in case (as Webchella said there was no crack for it).
5. Once installed DON’T run the program yet, go to the Apple website/support/download and search ""logic pro"".
6. download the most recent update to version 9.1.7
7. install the update...
8. Tun the program. It did not ask me to register nor to provide serial #!
9. Thank you: @webchella, @lp-man & @djtopher, etc!

Now I have QUESTION: Can I go back & install just mainstage, to add it to my LogicPro, etc applications?"

I have had every single problem you all had when trying to install this, from patches not working to misunderstanding instructions to not knowing serial codes, so here are my simplified instructions for you guys. I am using 10.7.3 Lion, but these will work on any system for the latest version of Logic Pro 9

**** Installation Instructions ****
1. Download this torrent. (This contains the Logic Studio CD itself)
2. Download the following torrent (this contains working patches/crack and its only 3kb so don't worry)  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5635830/Logic_Studio_9.1.1_Pro_Apps_Crack
3. Open downloaded folder and double click on LogicStudio.iso, then on Logic Studio Install, the drive that just mounted on the desktop
4. Open the package ""Install Logic Studio"", an installer will run
5. Follow the installers instructions, and enter the following serial number when prompted:
E-350-OYX-169-EGD-300-TRZ-435-TGX-FHA-41HX
6. Logic Studio will install.
7. Open the torrent with the patch (the 3kb one) and copy and paste the two files to /Library/Application Support/ProApps, overriding the existing files.
8. Click Software update, and update to the latest version.
9. You can now run Logic Studio

****End Instructions****

I hope this helped, it worked for me and i think is the simplest way of doing it. Thanks!
