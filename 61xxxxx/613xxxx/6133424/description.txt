Description: 

Get ready for a minion laughs in the funniest blockbuster hit of the year!

Vying for the title of â€œWorldâ€™s Greatest Villainâ€, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) â€“ along with his hilarious crew of mischievous minions â€“ plots to pull off the craziest crime of the century: steal the moon! But when Gru enlists the help of three little girls, they see something in him nobody else has ever seen: the perfect dad. From executive producer Chris Meledandri (Horton Hears a Who, Ice Age), and featuring the voices of an all-star comedic cast, including Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Miranda Cosgrove and Julie Andrews, Despicable Me is â€œrousingly funny, heartfelt and imaginativeâ€ (Pete Hammond, Boxoffice Magazine).
