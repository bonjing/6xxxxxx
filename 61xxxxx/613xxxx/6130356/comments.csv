,saxman7,2011-01-27T22:12Z,"Thanks.  I just didn't see these anywhere.  I know the quality of these are not great - analog cable standard tv but it's something.  I have ShowAnalyzer remove the commercials so they are mostly clean.  Enjoy!

If anyone has digital HD, please feel free to upload better quality videos than these.  I won't be offended :)"
