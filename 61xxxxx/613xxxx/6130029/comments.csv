[V],FiNEHD,2011-01-27T01:36Z,you're welcome ;)
[V],aoloffline,2011-01-27T11:57Z,"   It is johnny's account,but he is such a ipocrite that he doesn't uplaod movies with lower imdb rating under ""johnny"" he uses this account for it.
  It's just sick.."
[V],FiNEHD,2011-01-27T23:05Z,"why are you such a bitter twat? you used to seem ok...
it's nothing to do with imdb rating. unless you think 8.1/10 is low?!
this constant hostility is so fucking lame. i'm not a hypocrite and your snide little remarks are unwelcome and frankly boring."
,Alosia,2011-01-28T01:31Z,why is it that all of the movies you're uploading recently have russian audio as the default?
[V],FiNEHD,2011-01-28T12:59Z,it's because they are from russian sites. using existing seeds allows me to upload more as i have limited bandwidth.
,abhikrit,2011-01-31T20:17Z,just wanted to thank for all the blu rays :) love them...
,reverendshnorr,2011-07-12T16:08Z,"This is an excellent torrent! Just converted the first movie to dvd and watched it on a 42 inch hd screen, quality was fantastic 10/10. Thankyou very much for this."
,PS3please,2011-09-28T08:34Z,"thank you for these. only issue i can see is part 2 english subs are a little messed up. sometimes words like ""I'll"" or ""that"" come out as I@TMll  whatever that means.   

other than that, i love these."

,bigdrago,2012-05-08T18:48Z,How can I remove the russian audio?
,SammySamB,2012-06-18T22:10Z,"I like VLC, head to audio, scroll down to audio track, you will see the option of English. Good movies by the way."
