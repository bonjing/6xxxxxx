Review

Tom Kime s Street Food introduces us to the unpretentious, unpredictable and always delightful nibbles found at food stalls on streets the world over, like savory Indonesian beef satAÂ© skewers, grilled sardines, Lebanese lamb pizza, stuffed fish balls, sweet fried ravioli, salt cod croquettes, Mexican pumpkin flower soup, hummus with cinnamon lamb and so many more. The names of the dishes themselves awaken the senses and are slightly poetic. If you have a good sense of flavor imagination, this book is enough to drive you mad
