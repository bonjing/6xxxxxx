[T],mp3pro1986,2011-01-31T19:32Z,"Hello Robbinghood,

First off all, thank you very much for your hard work here at tpb. I downloaded a lot of your torrents and specially the antivirus torrents.

I have a request for you, and i hope you can/want help me.
I am a blind computer user. To work with my computer, i need to use a screen reader. A screen reader is software that translates the screen into speech and/or braille. Good screen readers are very expensive. 1000$ or something.

I am using the supernova screen reader (http://www.yourdolphin.com), but my version is old.
Can you help me and other blind or visual impared users to make a trial reset/keygen or crack for the latest supernova access suite? At the moment it is version 12.02. The supernova Access Suite includes speech/braille and magnification support.

I am sorry that i make this request here. Because i don't know how to get in contact with you.

Thank you for all your work!

Best regards,

Mp3pro1986"

I can't promise anything, but I'll check out your request. 
However, I can already tell you that it's not a simple request, so don't expect anything.
An alternative probably would be easier.


@theuploader9999
If CyberLink MediaShow is not at TPB then you can find it elsewhere, 
cause it's easy to find on the web."
[T],mp3pro1986,2011-02-01T12:28Z,"Hello Robbinghood,

Thanks for your answer. I can understand that it is hard to find/make a good working crack for Supernova Screen reader.

Here is some information that can be useful.

The supernova product is protected with an activation system. You can run the program for 30 as a tiral, after that you have to buy it.
When you buy it, you will get a unlock code, after you insert that unlock code, you will get an option to activate by internet or manual.

For me it looks like some kind of activation system that the norton 2008 and earlier versions uses. But offcourse another algoritme i think.

So maybe it would be easier to have a trial reset, so that you can reset the 30 day trial after it expires.

But as i said before. I know that it is a hard job. And i will not expect anything, but for sure you would do a great job again if you could help me (or us blind people).

Have a nice day!

[T],CheckOutEr,2011-02-10T22:16Z,"Hi, RobbingHood! Thanks again for this torrent. Please, be so kind, help me, because I FAILED.
Xilisoft Blu-ray Creator was working like charm, everything was perfect, but I didn't Block internet access for the program by using e.g. a firewall: 
   > Block internet access through ""Program Control"" from your firewall.
   > Or set ""Program Control"" to manual (""Ask what to do/Decide yourself""). I just did Uncheck/disable ""Check for Updates Automatically"" at: 
   -> Tools -> Preferences -> General -> Update. 
   (Do NOT update Xilisoft Blu-ray Creator (do NOT check for program updates!)
Today I opened this program & it was unregistered, so I uninstalled the whole version & deleted manually all the hidden files & folders & registries of it & reinstalled it. I did everything that was written on the notepad step by step, but when I try to register offline then it says: ''Failed to connect Network, please check your device and Network connection'' , when I try to register online, then it says: ''Invalid license info''. Thanks a lot for any help!"

Does anyone know how to get this program working again?"
