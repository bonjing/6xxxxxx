Debut LP from Nite Jewel a.k.a. Ramona Gonzales.
Although a project associated with chillwave, if it weren't for the vintage beats in some (not all) of the songs, you would say it is just a dream pop record (partly due to the female vocals, whereas many chillwave artists are male), albeit a fine one. Although not as wildly experimental as Memory Tapes or Toro Y Moi albums, what it does is excelently executed.
