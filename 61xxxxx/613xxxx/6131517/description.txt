Passionate and intense, powerful and sensitive, N'der Fouta Tooro, Volume 2 is an exciting step forward for Mansour Seck, deservingly focussing attention on the talent of this musician who was the co-founder, with Baaba Maal, of what is now recognised as one of the best bands in modern African music: Dande Lenol. This is the second volume of the N'der Fouta Tooro recording sessions from the famous Studio 2000 in Dakar and also features the captivating vocals of the griot from Mauritania: Ousmane Hamady Diop.
