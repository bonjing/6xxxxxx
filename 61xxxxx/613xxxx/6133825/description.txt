Level E (ãƒ¬ãƒ™ãƒ«E) is a science fiction manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi. The plot follows an alien prince who crash lands on Earth and begins living with a high school student. Along with its short length and more realistic art style, the story of Level E focuses much more heavily on humor than Togashi's more famous shÅnen series YuYu Hakusho and Hunter Ã— Hunter.
Level E was originally serialized in the Japanese Shueisha magazine Weekly ShÅnen Jump from 1995 to 1997 for a total of 16 chapters. These chapters have since been collected into three volumes, as well as two magazine-style books. An anime adaptation of Level E is currently being produced by Studio Pierrot and David Production and is to begin airing on TV Tokyo in early 2011.
Earth has been populated by thousands of aliens from all over the galaxy. While all the other aliens are aware of their presence, it is a secret only from the Earthlings. Baka, the prince of the planet Dogra, crash lands on Earth and loses his memory. He forcibly moves in with Tsutsui Yukitata, a first year high school student who had just moved out on his own. The normal life he once knew is quickly pulled away as he becomes the target of the prince's torment.
