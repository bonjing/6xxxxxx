Lesson 10: Nested Loops and 2D Arrays,                Duration:	13 min. 03 sec. 
===================================================================================
Grids, matricies, two-dimensional arrays! Learn how to create them, how to use them, and how to loop over them with nested loops in this lesson.



===================================================================================
Lesson 11: Object Oriented Programming,               Duration:	15 min. 47 sec.
===================================================================================
This is the first lesson in object oriented programming. Learn the difference between a class and an object. Learn how to create classes in Java, as well as how to instantiate their objects. Field variables, constructors, accessors, it\'s all here!



===================================================================================
Lesson 12: Writing Functions in Classes,              Duration:	14 min. 50 sec.
===================================================================================
This time we continue on our OOP discussions and we learn to add methods to our classes. We write an example class and add some methods to it. We also learn the unorthodox practice of daisy-chaining.



===================================================================================
Lesson 13: File and Text Input                        Duration:	17 min. 28 sec.
===================================================================================
Use the Scanner class to read input, either from a file or from the user as command line input. Also, learn how to add Java to your (Windows) system path so you can access run your programs from a command line.
