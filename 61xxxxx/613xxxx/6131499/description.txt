Overview
========
Written, narrated and hosted by John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006).

The ideas of economists and social philosophers shape actions and events even when we are unaware of their sources. They have a decisive influence on the great rush of revolution and change through which the world has passed in the last two hundred years. Professor John Kenneth Galbraith traces these ideas and their consequences from Adam Smith, through Marx and Lenin, to Keynes and to the thinking that gave shape to the concepts of the Cold War, the corporation and, now, the conflicts and concerns of the Third World. The Canadian-born, Berkeley-trained John Kenneth Galbraith remained something of a renegade in modern economics - and his work has been nothing if not provocative.

BBC Production Notes
====================
Producer David Kennardâ€™s comments:

The Age of Uncertainty series is, as far as I know, "the one that got away." Though it featured the well-known J.K.Galbraith, it was loved by some and hated by others -- partly because of his direct political assessments, and partly because the style of the films wasn't to everyone's taste: quite cartoon-like in parts, sardonic/ironic in effect. Not the traditional "posh" BBC series.

I was one of the three producer/directors on the 13-part series, which was premiered on the BBC in Spring 1977 and on PBS (through KCET Los Angeles) six months later. It was shot around the world on 16mm film, and featured many different types of special effect and reconstruction. It ran into a lot of political and critical rough water during the Reagan era, and to my knowledge was not re-broadcast after about 1980.

However, it had quite wide educational distribution. I know that the library of UC Berkeley has a copy, and it is possible that KCET/LA have a copy though I have never asked them. The BBC was unhelpful when I contacted them, and I think they may have junked their master negatives (not unusual!).

I think that the series has great historical value, and is eerily relevant today, as the financial market implodes, which Galbraith accurately foretold.

It discusses the contributions of Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus.

â€¢ Episode 02 - The Manners and Morals of High Capitalism (55:51): The robber baron industrial capitalists of the late nineteenth century and examines their conspicuous consumption concept of earning and spending money. It discusses ways in which this concept affects our attitudes today.

â€¢ Episode 03 â€“ Karl Marx: The Massive Dissent (56:11): The film opens with a view of Marxâ€™s tomb. Galbraith enumerates the different qualities of Karl Marx. We are shown the home where he was born in Trier, Germany, and his early life history is recounted. Hegel and the University of Berlin stand out as a high-point.

â€¢ Episode 04 â€“ The Colonial Idea (55:17): Focuses on colonialism and the colonial adventure, which Galbraith considers historically and as a continuing legacy.

â€¢ Episode 05 â€“ Lenin and the Great Ungluing (56:08): The outbreak of the first world war, with its absurd unreason, should have triumphantly fulfilled Marxâ€™s prophecy of the end of capitalism. The war and the events leading up to it are illustrated on stage by posturing knights. The life of Lenin is counterpointed with the scenes of war.

â€¢ Episode 06 â€“ The Rise and Fall of Money (56:09): This program focuses on the history and function of money in society, which Galbraith considers through an analysis of the cycles of instability and inflation that plague the system.
