Paul Edwards is the author of a book that has just come out â€“ â€œHow to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MCâ€ on Chicago Review Press.

He interviewed several artists who were on Aftermath such as Bishop Lamont, Stat Quo, and Joell Ortiz, as well as artists who have worked extensively with Dr. Dre and Eminem such as RBX, Lady of Rage, Bobby Creekwater, Royce Da 5â€™9â€³, Cashis, and Devin the Dude. They share numerous insights into how Dr. Dre works with MCs, as well as info on Eminemâ€™s rapping techniques.

There are 104 MCs interviewed in total for the book, breaking down exactly what it takes to be a great MC. Other artists include Kool G Rap (who also provided the foreword), Big Daddy Kane, Clipse, Mobb Deep, Souls of Mischief, Nelly, Masta Ace, will-i-am, Chuck D, Cypress Hill, Twista, Immortal Technique, and A Tribe Called Quest.
