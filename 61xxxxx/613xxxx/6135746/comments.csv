,resles_1_,2012-05-30T08:07Z,"Wicked fast d/l. I pulled it down in just under an hour. It won't play on my Quicktime player (OS X Snow Leopard), but plays fine on VLC. Quality is okay. I may try the other torrent before I decide to keep this one."
,resles_1_,2012-05-30T10:47Z,"The a/v quality of both torrents are comparable. The other file works on my Quicktime player. Oddly, this torrent is crazy fast, but twice as large. Your choice: fast/big or slow/small."
