The thing I have noticed the most is that very few who download stay around very long to seed. Whenever I begin seeding I always give that file 100% of my bandwidth, but begin sharing with my other torrents after there are enough seeders. A few of you do help seed and thanks to you guys. I have removed most of my own uploaded torrents because of ingratitude. You can be assured, however, that I will not remove one until there is no one currently downloading and I will personally seed as long as anyone wants it. If you can see this you will know that I am seeding."

And to let you know that I'm seeding each episode I have downloaded, which is tragicly limited in number. The quality of the Ellen episode was great, far better than the others that are available now. It's such a great show, and so few episodes out there, so each and all episodes you would upload would be greatly appreciated!! And if you have a whole season or maybe five - that would be awesome:o) "
,Saki33,2011-02-03T23:51Z,"Thanks for the comment. Glad the quality was ok. It's a brit pdtv rip from years ago, so not as good as hdtv. I do have every episode, but I just don't have enough bandwidth to upload all of them. I downloaded all of them from share the files. You can go there to get them. (Sorry; links aren't permitted or I'd post it.) Free to join, but you need emule to download. Painfully slow to download, but will eventually complete, maybe a week. I mostly use STF to find out when legitimate rips are available, but come to TPB to download.

In Nov 2010 a dvd boxed set of the complete series was released. I thought there would surely be rips available by now. I want to watch every episode again and so far am waiting for the dvd's. The quality of the writing did fall off some in the later seasons, but overall the greatest comedy series ever."

,Saki33,2011-02-05T04:01Z,"To let everyone know, the entire six seasons are available at BTJunkie dot org with a lot of seeders for every season. The easiest way to get every episode."
,Saki33,2011-02-18T17:15Z,"It's up to you guys now. I have seeded every season for two weeks, 76 GB. Now I need to share my bandwidth to seed back the torrents I want to download for myself. If you appreciate it then help seed. Some of you have and thanks to you."
