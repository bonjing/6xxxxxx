,Woody115,2011-02-04T06:44Z,"Need help! I'm on the Seventh Chapter (I think) and I'm supposed to line up some orbital relays or something. There is a hack pad next to this door I have to use, I hack it it opens up fine. Then I walk through this Hexagonal Corridor type thing and open the door on the other side. This is when the screen goes black and then a popup comes up saying Dead Space 2 has encountered a problem, after this it terminates the program. Can anyone help?"
,Movie-Fan,2011-02-04T12:35Z,i had the same problem you have to download a save file which when loaded brings you to the other side
