*This song has no official title. Unable to get sample clearance, the original song, "Box In Hand", which featured Method Man and Streetlife, was removed from the album. It was mislabeled as "Box In Hand" in the album credits probably because they both feature Method Man. The real "Box In Hand" can be heard here:A bootleg 12" was released with "Box In Hand" under the name "Deadly Darts". This is also unofficial.
