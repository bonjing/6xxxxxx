\"Dysfunctional\" is hardly the word for the family that tears itself apart in \"Matchbox\", a blackly humorous rantfest set in an Athens working-class apartment where the air conditioning has broken down. Though well cast, with a take-no-prisoners perf by Errikos Litsis as the bellicose paterfamilias, this first feature by Cyprus-born helmer Yannis Economidis is still highly specialized fare, further limited by being shot on less than top-grade DV equipment.

Unspooling like a one-act play divided into two scenes, film starts with cafe owner Dimitris (Litsis) screaming down the phone -- hard to swallow until the viewer realizes the whole family talks like that. Other characters gradually arrive and join in the mutual abuse, including Yorgos (Kostas Xykominos), his brother-in-law and business partner; Maria (Eleni Kokkidou), his tough wife; Lukas (Stavros Yakoulis), his foul-mouthed, playboy son; Kiki (Angeliki Papoulia), his equally gutter-mouthed daughter; and Vangelis (Yannis Voulgarakis), an employee being pressured to marry a pregnant Albanian. A family revelation occasions a slight pause before battle recommences. At the end of the day, there\\\\\\\'s not a great deal of point to the pic, though it plays more entertainingly than it sounds (from Variety.com).

Debut film for one of the most important and controversial new greek filmmakers.
