,mkkano,2011-02-01T21:30Z,"zakimar - You wouldn't have to re-download the entire torrent. Just start this torrent, close your client, move the original files to this torrent's folder (they are exactly the same as you noted) and finish that last .01%. 

The original torrent was corrupted and set the final file's size to 14.55mb when it was actually 14.35mb so even if you did what I said above the torrent would come back 100% done as you and everyone else had downloaded the entire torrent. 

No, you'd rather accuse me of not seeding. Acting like an entitled child who didn't get the candy he wanted. I don't have to upload anything. I choose to spend my time to do so, I even used my mate's time to start the reseed of this torrent with an additional starting seeder to make sure it was healthy this time. "
