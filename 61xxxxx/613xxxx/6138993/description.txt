Who is Roark?
.... I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m a solo artist. When the mood is right, I rock all night, with these wonderful chaps...

No one is likely to miss that once Break Of Day reaches fans. Itâ€™s a testament to Roark that he skirts the boundary lines of contemporary pop while remaining true to the singer/songwriter tradition that inspires him. He will no doubt inspire many in the months and years to come.

â€œI made the songs I heard,â€ he says of the new album, â€œand I gave it my best effort.  I hope it will connect with people, because everything came from the heart.â€

As a songwriter, Roark subscribes to the approach of poet Robert Frost, who once described his art as â€œfreedom in harness.â€ Says Roark, â€œMost every lyric I write has to rhyme. I need the restraint; otherwise there are too many ways to say things.  Also, a lot of my guitar playing is rhythmic in nature. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll never be a shredder, ripping out crazy solos.â€ 

â€œI worked for a Fortune 500 company,â€ he says. â€œIt was terrible. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d rather be a struggling musician.â€ Thanks to his friendship with Chris Badami and Ace Enders of The Early November, he was able to showcase for Love Minus Zero Recordings in 2005. It wasnâ€™t long before he clinched a solo deal (the first artist signed to the LMZ label) and the making of Break Of Day was underway.
