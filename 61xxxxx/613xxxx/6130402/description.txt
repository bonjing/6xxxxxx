For over three decades Paul Tait has performed both as a band leader and as a singer songwriter.  He has independently released a series of critically acclaimed recordings, including: "Pop Musician", "Television City", "I Still Believe", â€œBack In Businessâ€, â€œAngels Of The Cityâ€, and "Song to the Moon" which was the number one most requested college radio station song the year it was released.

As an actor, Paul performed in regional theater and on Off Broadway.  Productions include: "Mr. Roberts", Harold Pinterâ€™s "The Homecoming", "Jesus Christ Superstar", "Tales from the Wayside Inn", and "The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail".

In 2010 Paul released the critically acclaimed CD â€œâ€¦born at nightâ€¦â€ his first new collection of songs in seven years.

â€œPaul Tait is truly one of musicâ€™s unsung, unsigned greats when it comes to pure pop rock expression.  And by pop rock music I do not mean the fluff we accept today for contemporary pop rock music, I mean good old fashioned solid pop rock and roll songwriting delivered with passion, zeal and just the right amount of humor.â€
