          PLOT SUMMARY             
                                                                            
        
         As a hardened crew of factory workers struggle to see out the last 
         two weeks before their redundancy windfalls, panic runs through 
         the ranks with the arrival of a mysterious man sent to join them. 
         Suddenly fearful that their drinking and gambling will be exposed 
         by the head-office "spy" and rob them of their money, the men 
         descend into a compelling world of antagonism and brutality.
