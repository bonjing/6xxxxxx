According to many, the world is black and white.  There are no gray areas.  But, what if you didnâ€™t have to choose between them.   Perhaps, you could traverse the gap and effortlessly move between the expanse of differing views.   Of course, due caution is necessary, as just like in life, spikes of pain exist and you are always only one step away from the the depths of an excruciating death.



Gameplay

SHIFT Extended continues from where its PC predecessor left off.  You are Test Subject 12378.   Much like Portal, you are trapped in varying rooms and given instructions that will lead you to success in the puzzles that await.  Press the â€œXâ€ button to jump.  Spikes will kill you.   This collectible will affect the environment in this way and so forth.  Oh, and pressing the â€œLeftâ€ or â€œRightâ€ triggers will turn the world upside down and teleport you to the other side. For example, if you have a maze, it is as if the maze part was drawn on white piece of paper.   Therefore, if you are standing on the maze, you can shift between the white backgrounds and the black ink of the drawing.   However, the collectibles will let you unlock pieces, extend portions of the drawing and let you solve the puzzle.  Or, a checkered piece in the game will block your progress and you must find a way around.   Success is determined by reaching the exit; the score you receive is based on the regular requirements of speed, moves taken and lives used.
