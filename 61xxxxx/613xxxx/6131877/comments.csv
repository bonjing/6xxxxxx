Abstinence

Remember the lord in retirement from the people and make prayer thy sleep, and hunger thy food.

Kill not your hearts with excess of eating and drinking.

Illumine your hearts with hunger, and strive to conquer yourself with hunger and thirst; continue to knock on the gates of paradise by hunger.

The world is sweet in the heart, and green to the eye; and verily God hath brought you, after those who went before you: then look to your action, and abstain from the world of wickedness.

The nearest to me are the abstinent, whoever they are, wherever they are.

A keeper of the fast, who doth not abandon lying and detraction, God careth not about his leaving off eating and drinking.

A man once said to Muhammad, ""O Messenger of God, permit me to become a Eunuch."" He said, ""That person is not of me who maketh another a eunuch, or becometh so himself; because the manner in which my followers become eunuchs is by fasting and abstinence."" The man said permit me to retire from society, and to abandon the delights of the world."" He said, ""The retirement that becometh my followers is to live in the world and yet to sit in the corner of a mosque in expectation of prayers.""

A man while fasting must abstain from all bad expressions and must not even resent an injury.

Torment not yourselves, lest God punish you.

There is no monasticism in Islam.

S'ad b. Abi Wakkas said: The apostle forbade Uthman b. Mazun from avoiding marriage: and if he had permitted that to him, we would have become eunuchs.""

The man I most emulate is a Muslim unencumbered; a man of small family, and little money, a performer of prayers and a perfect worshipper of God in private, one who is unknown, and hath enough to supply his wants, and when he dieth, he will leave few women to cry for him, and few legacies."

To every young person who honors the old, on account of their age, may god apoint those who shall honor him in his years.

Verily, to honor an old man is showing respect to God. 

The best of alms is that which the right hand giveth, and the left hand knoweth not of.

The best of almsgiving is that which springeth from the heart, and is uttered by the lips to soften the wounds of the injured.

Almsgiving is duty unto you. Alms should be taken from the rich and returned to the poor. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T21:53Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

There are seven people whom God will draw under His own shadow, on the day when there will be no other shadow; one of them a man who hath given alms and concealed it, so that his left hand knew not what his right hand did.

Muhammad said, ""It is indispensable for every Muslim to give alms."" The companions asked, ""But if he hath not anything to give?"" He said, ""If he hath nothing, he must do a work with his hand, by which to obtain something and benefit himself; and give alms with the remainder."" They said, ""But if he is not able to do that work, to benefit himself and give alms to others?"" The Rasul (Muhammad) said, ""Then he should assist the needy and the oppressed."" They asked, ""What if he is not able to assist the oppressed?"" He said, ""Then he should exhort people to do good."" They asked, ""And if he cannot?"" He said, ""Then let him withold himself from doing harm to people; for verily that is as alms and charity for him.""

The people of the Rasul's house killed a goat, and the Rasul enquired, ""What remaineth of it?"" Aishah said, ""Nothing but its shoulder; for we have sent the rest to the poor and neighbors."" The Rasul said, ""The whole goat remaineth except its shoulder; that is, that remaineth which ye have given away, and what ye have kept in the house is frail."" "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T21:53Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

The angels asked, ""O God! Is there anything of Thy creation stronger than rocks?"" God said, ""Yes; iron is stronger than rocks, for it breaketh them."" The angels said, ""O Lord! Is there anything of Thy creation stornger than iron?"" God said, ""Yes; fire is stronger than iron, for it melteth it."" And the angels said, O defender! Is there anything of Thy creation stronger than fire?"" God said, ""Yes; water overcometh fire; it killeth it and maketh it cold."" Then the angels said, ""O Lord! Is there anything of Thy creation stronger than water?"" God said, ""Yes; wind overcometh water: it agitateth it and putteth it in motion."" They said, ""O our cherisher! Is there anything in Thy creation stronger than wind?"" God said, ""Yes, the children of Adam, giving alms; that is, those who give with their right hands and conceal if from their left, they overcome all.""

The most excellent of alms is that of a man of small property, which he has earned by labor, and from which he giveth as much as he is able.

Giving alms to the poor hath the reward of one alms; but that given to kindred hath two rewards; one, the reward of alms, the other the reward of helping relations.

A man's first duty should be to his own family, if poor. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T21:54Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Fear God, in treating dumb animals and ride them when they are fit to be ridden and get off them when they are tired.

An adultress passed by a dog at a well; and the dog was holding out his tongue from thirst, which was near killing him, and the woman drew off her boot, and tied it to the end of her garment, and drew water for the dog, and gave him to drink; and she was forgiven for that act.

A woman was punished for a cat which she tied till it died from hunger. She gave the cat nothing to eat, nor did she set it at liberty so that it might find some food.

""Are there rewards for doing good to quadrupeds, and givng them water to drink?"" Muhammad said, ""Verily there are heavenly rewards for any act of kindness to a live animal."" "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T21:55Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Verily God hath one hundred loving kindnesses; one of which he hath sent down amongst man, quadrupeds, and every moving thing upon the face of the earth: by it they are kind to each other, and forgive one another; and by it the animals of the wilds are kind to their young; and God hath reserved ninety-nine loving kindnesses by which he will be gracious to His creatures on the last day.

A young man came before the Rasul with a carpet and said, ""O Rasul! I passed through a wood and heard the voices of young birds; and I took and put them into my carpet; and their mother came fluttering around my head, and I uncovered the young, and the mother fell down upon them, then I wrapped them up in my carpet; and there are the young which I have."" Then the Rasul said, ""Put them down."" And when he did so, their mother joined them: and Muhammad said, ""Do you wonder at the affection of the mother towards her young? I swear by Him who hath sent me, verily God is more loving to His creatures than the mother to these young birds. Return them to the place from which ye took them, and let their mother be with them."""
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T21:56Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Muhammad said, ""That person will not enter Paradise who hath one atom of pride in his heart."" And a man present said, ""Verily, a man is fond of having good clothes, and good shoes."" Muhammad said, ""God is Beauty and delighteth in the beautiful; but pride is holding man in contempt."" 

There are two benefits, of which the generality of men are the losers, and of which they do not know the value. 

Charity that is concealeth appeaseth the wrath of God.

Prayers lighten the heart, and charity is proof of Iman (Faith), and abstinence from sin is perfect splendor; the Kuran is a proof of gain to you, if you do good, and it is a detriment to you if you do wrong; and every man who riseth in the morning either doeth that which will be the means of his redemption or his ruin."
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T21:57Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Charity is a duty unto every Muslim. He who hath not the means thereto, let him do a good act or abstain from an evil one. That is his charity.

When you speak, speak the truth; perform when you promise; discharge your trust; commit not fornication; be chaste; have no impure desires; withold your hands from striking, and from taking that which is unlawful and bad. The best of God's servants are those who when seen, remind of God; and the worst of God's servants are those who carry tales about, and do mischief and separate friends, and seek for the defects of the good.

Whoso hath left debt and children, let him come to me; I am their patron, I will discharge his debt and befriend his children.

Every good act is charity.

Doing justice between two people is charity; and asisting a man upon his beast, and lifting his baggage is charity; and pure, comforting words are charity; and answering a questioner with mildness, is charity; and removing that which is an inconvenience to wayfarers, such as thorns and stones, is a charity."
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:11Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Thus saith the Lord, ""Verily those who are patient in adversity and forgive wrongs, are the doers of excellence.""

Once Muhammad was asked, ""O Apostle of God!"" How many times are we to forgive our servant's faults?"" He was silent. Again the questioner asked, and Muhammad gave no answer. But when the man asked a third time, he said, ""Forgive your servants seventy times day.""

There is no man who woundeth and pardoneth the giver of the wound but God will exalt his dignity and dimish his faults.

That man is nearest to God, who pardoneth, when he had in his power him who would have injured him.

Do not say, that if the people do good to us, we will do good to them; and if the people oppress us, we will oppress them; but determine that if people do you good, you will do good to them; and if they oppress you, you will not oppress them. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:16Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Whoever loveth to meet God, God loveth to meet him.

God saith, ""I fulfil the faith of whoso putteth his faith in Me; and I am with him, and near him, when remembereth Me.""

God saith, ""Whoso doth one good act, for him are ten rewards; and I also give more to whomever I will; and whoso doth an ill, its punishment is equal to it, or I forgive him; and whoso seeketh to approach Me one span, I seek to approach one cubit; and whoso seeketh to approach Me one cubit, I seek to approach him two fathoms; and whoso walketh towards Me, I run towards him; and whoso cometh before Me with the earth full of sins, and believeth solely in Me, him I come before with a front of forgiveness as big as the earth.""

God saith, ""The person I hold as a beloved, I am his hearing by which he heareth, and I am his sight by which he seeth, and I am his hands by which he holdeth, and I am his feet by which he walketh.""

God saith, ""O Man! Only follow thou My laws, and thou shall become like unto Me, and then say, 'Be' and behold, It is.""

God is One, and liketh unity.

We were with Muhammad on a journey, and some men stood up repeating aloud, ""God is most great,"" and the Rasul said, ""O men! Be easy on yourselves, and do not distress yourselves by raising your voices, verily you do not call to one deaf or absent, but verily to one who heareth and seeth; and He is with you; and He to whom you pray is nearer to you than the neck of your camel.""

God sait, ""I was a hidden treasure. I would fain be known. So I created Man.""

Do you love your creator? Love your fellow-beings first. "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:19Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

If the unbeliever knew of the extent of the Lord's mercy, even he would not despair of Paradis.

God's kindness towards his creaturee is more than a mother's towards her babe.

If you put your whole trust in God, as you ought, He most certainly will give you sustenance, as He doth the birds; they come out hungry in the morning, but return full to their nests.

Trust in God, but tie it (your camel).

God is not merciful to him who is not kind to mankind.

""Do none enter the Garden of Bliss save by God's mercy?"" Muhammad said, ""No. None enter save through God's favor."" ""You also, O Messenger of God! Will you not enter Paradise save by God's compassion?"" Muhammad put his hand on his head and said thrice, ""I shall not enter unless God cover me with His mercy."" "
,hamzaibrahim1983,2011-01-27T22:23Z,"Sayings of the Prophet Muhammed:

Beware! verily there is a piece of flesh in the body of man, which when good, the whole body is good; and when bad, the whold body is bad, and that is the heart.

Muhammad said, ""O Wabisah! are you come to ask what is goodness and what is badness?"" Wabisah said, ""Yes, I am come for that."" Then He joined his fingers and struck them upon Wabisah's breast, that is made a sign towards his heart, and said, ""Ask the question from thine own heart."" This he repeated three times aloud and said, ""Goodness is a thing from which thy heart findeth firmness and rest; and badness is a thing which throweth thee into doubt, although men may acquit thee."""
