,davey62,2011-01-31T10:18Z,"nice copy

movie terribly paced
no way a movie about monsters in mexico should be this dull

great cinematography and editing
thus promising in some ways for the director

worth a watch but only just barely

,danjmarsden,2011-02-12T16:46Z,This film is one bad film like another comment said no way a film about aliens in Mexico should be this dull aside from that audio and video are fine but i wouldn't waste time watching this you shall be very disappointed 
,Gazme,2011-03-18T02:37Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS AND EXPECT CLOVERFIELD, IT IS NOT AN ACTION FILM.

Its a scifi drama. Its a brilliant drama but those downloading this hoping for some humans vs aliens butt kicking are always going to be disappointed.

Understandable why some people are annoyed though, the trailer did make it look like it would be a massive humans vs aliens battle but its not, its about the relationship between the two main cast members (the only professional actors in it), it just happens to be set in a world where there are lots of aliens knocking about."
,Adrian4400,2011-04-16T12:05Z,"Excellent Copy 10/10! The movie could of been better but it was alright, bit like cloverfield I thought as well."

,Johngoundry86,2011-05-31T18:38Z,"Idiotic american kids putting the 'movie' down as 3......  Nobody wants to know your opinion on the 'movie'. it's actually a Film, and its not about what the title of the film suggests.... 


I recommend this to anyone over the age of 20 who can actually appreciate a decent film.

,light24bulbs,2011-06-09T01:00Z,"This film is extremely well done and believable. Action is sparse and long abandoned sites of battle are abundant, making for a suspenseful and eery watch.  Character interaction is complete and well rounded.  Quite the unexpected romance, but not in the horrible hollywood way I have experienced before"

,kingjoser,2011-09-27T10:26Z,This movie is horrible. Quality is good but the actual movie sucks!!
,kevhast,2011-11-14T08:08Z,"Nice quality, thanks for the upload. Really enjoyed this but don't expect an action-packed monster movie. Read reviews on rottentomatoes. Worth the download."

,Kaje13,2012-01-11T13:07Z,"why do people comment in a rude way in this site? can't they just be grateful for those who shared? yeah some movies don't meet our standards but it's not enough reason to label movies as ""horrible,it sucks,retarded plot, etc."" People just can't be good (even in commenting), and maybe that's why the human species is doomed to fail. Hate is what people are brewing, and that same hate will devour us all."
,PineappleStarz,2012-03-16T10:15Z,"Kaje13

its just natural to express emotions about the movie in a relaxed way at a relaxed site.

no rich highly intellectual people visit here, so don't be a prude and blame the worlds problems on a few  words of how they felt about the movie."
