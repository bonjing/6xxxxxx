SUMMARY:
Los Angeles in the year 1996. The streets are ruled by acts of violence 
and terror, nothing and nobody is safe. Simon Phoenix is one of the worst 
criminals that Los Angeles has ever seen, and only one man can stop him - 
L.A.P.D. officer John "Demotion Man" Spartan. When John apprehended Phoenix, 
he was surprisingly found as an accessory to the recent crime and was also 
sent to the "Cryo Prison". During John Spartan's sentence, Los Angeles' 
theme and society had dramatically changed from one of violence to one 
of peace. Phoenix, revived for a parole hearing managed to escape and uses 
Los Angles to his advantage. The Police are unable to stop him with their 
non-violent solutions and have no choice but to let out John Spartan to 
stop him. Now, Spartan not only has to stop Phoenix, but to adapt himself 
to the future society he has no knowledge about.
