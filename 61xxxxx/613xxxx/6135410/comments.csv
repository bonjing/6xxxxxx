,Stiff_Drink,2011-04-16T15:57Z,This is the 'Taco Bell' version.
,zero1zero,2011-06-28T23:45Z,"This is NOT the Taco Bell version.  This is the Pizza Hut version. The person above me must not have even watched this movie. It's a damn shame too because the video quality on this is pretty amazing. 

I really don't want to delete this but I hate edited versions and I heard this European version is also shorter.  Not sure if it but I don't care I want Taco Bell not Pizza Hut!"
,zero1zero,2011-06-29T09:12Z,The US version which has Taco Bell is supposed to be coming out in Sept. but I also read the Japanese BR disc is the Taco Bell version.  Can anyone rip it?
