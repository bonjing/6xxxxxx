Twas my request!!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-28T10:27Z,"Thanks.

@jamydoug : Yes, it was. As requests are halted from day before yesterday - I deliberately avoided putting ""requested"" in Header - it acts as the light to moths. "
,r-0987,2011-01-28T14:38Z,Thanks! LOL To 'acts as light to moths.' 
,dark_defender,2011-01-28T14:46Z,@twentyforty: What happened to Legends of the Fall? :-(
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-28T16:14Z,"@dark_defender: Deleted. Before even first file was out, crazies was able to hit minuses as many times as you and others there (I've read all Comments there) have been able to voice something different out.

Comments must stay - but TPB MUST remove the rating. So, unfair. stupid and repulsive Rating MUST go - or I will... as many uploaders did and would.

After 6 hours encoding and four hours of upload - FROM MY OWN POCKET - this site (TPB) gives playground to crazies, HollyBolly beast, MPAA and other idiots to spit in my face - idiotically defending Rating button. TPB's policy is above common sense, I guess."
,dark_defender,2011-01-28T17:00Z,"@twentyforty: Oh mahn..Fuckin outrageous. Bloody retards just know how to mess things up. How can they hit minus without even watching it. Bull shit. I hope they Rot in Hell.

Any chance of uploading it again ?? :("
,tj888334,2011-01-29T01:37Z,"super good movie. fast download. option of subtitles. if anybody doesn't want the subtitles, just delete the subtitle files. thanks thanks."
