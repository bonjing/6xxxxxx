_____ Why Fake It When You Can Create It   _______  

by Frank Doorhof

Photographer Frank Doorhof is in the studio, showing viewers how to achieve the lighting results they want without having to adjust their images in post-production. Frank starts off by going over how to calibrate a light meter to get consistent, accurate results on every shot. He goes on to discuss how to calculate the fall off of light from the subject, how to create color tints in the background, how moving the light sources can result in dramatically different images, and how changing the camera angle affects the focus plane. Frank also has some tips on positioning the models and how to achieve accurate color results with a color checker. Photographers can take their studio photography to the next level with the help of this course.
