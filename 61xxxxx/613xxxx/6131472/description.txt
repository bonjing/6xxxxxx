STORYLINE
The year is 2509 and not only has Earth lost contact with the USG Ishimura
and Isaac Clarke, but also the USG O'Bannon, which is the first responder
ship sent to rescue them. Four crew members of the O'Bannon have survived,
but no one knows what happened to the rest of the crew, what they were
doing, or what secrets they may be holding.
