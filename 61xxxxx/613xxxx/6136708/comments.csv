Shoddy, rushed, hard on the eyes, including one would-be Frank Miller. Can't tell what's happening half the time. Fraction's writing was more fractured than normal this time and harder to follow. Can't tell what's happening half the time, again. All in all, a complete waste of a number 500 issue. 500 should have been epic. This was just sad. I read it, seeded it to 2x and deleted it."
