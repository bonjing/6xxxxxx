K-Lite Codec Pack			Codecs allow files to play in ANY player, i.e., MP9/10/11
Media Player Classic Home Cinema	Standalone player
VLC Media Player			Standalone player, lots of features

They also play dozens of other funny files formats out there - must haves!

Would it help if I converted them to AVI's and re-uploaded it?"
,bellarmine,2011-01-29T02:07Z,"I noticed over on BitTorrentMonster, if you search for 'Mister Ed', someone's posted torrents for seasons 1, 2 and 3.  They say you can download them from http://xtremetv.org , but you have to register before anything works!

With this in mind, would anyone appreciate me uploading Seasons 1 and 2 as a regular torrent?

Let me know!"

That said - in answer to your '.avi' format question:  In general, I personally prefer AVI format; I also discovered that MP4 (as opposed to MP3) files will *save* most data entered into the 'Information' fields (accessed via VLC's playlist view of the files) to the actual *file* - not just to that playlist, as MP3s seem to...in addition, ISO files can be very nice to have, depending on the content (if it's not something you're in love with, you may not wish to use 4+GB of your HDD space on an ISO version, but for something you WANT very high-quality & DVD-type menus for, ISO format can be awesome).  I'm not familiar enough with other players & formats to have an educated opinion about them, sorry.



Oh, but FYI - XtremeTV.org has many aspects to like, enjoy, & respect; unfortunately, however, they also have many aspects that are lame, illiterate, and, well...one could even say, offensive.  They had their one-year anniversary recently...all I can say is, I hope they decide to lean more toward their good aspects & *lose* the bad ones...!"
,bellarmine,2011-06-15T10:37Z,"Hi folks,

Guess what?  I've found torrents for Complete Mr Ed Seasons 1 and 2 on D-e-m-o-n-o-i-d.me (remove the dashes.....:^)

'Mister Ed Season 1 (1961)'
'Mister Ed Season 2 (1961-1962)'

Search for     Mister Ed


And 1 episode of Season 4:
'Mr. Ed S04E21 Mae West Meets Mr. Ed'

Search for     Mr Ed mae west


If anyone downloads these, maybe they could upload the torrent files to TPB, so everyone else can get at them.............:^)

Thanks for the comments MissTrisBliss, I appreciate 'em!  I've been checking out XtremeTV, and see what you mean.  I'll have to check them out some more.  I'll see what I can do about converting these things to 1 AVI file.

Cheers!"
