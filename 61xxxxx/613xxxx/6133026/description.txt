Here's the Original Late 50s Unaired Pilot of Mr Ed - featuring Wilbur 'Pope' (not Post), and looking closer to 1940's than the 60's.	

This is my 2nd attempt at my first torrent upload, I hope it works - be sure to leave Lots and Lots of comments!
I apologize for the dead torrent I left on BitTorrentMonster, this one should work now.........:^)

My wireless modem supports up to 256Kbits uploading, so be patient with the speed.  I WILL seed until at least 2 copies are out there.

I'll be posting the COMPLETE seasons 1 and 2 of MrEd in a few weeks.  Watch for them!
