[T],youssef0eddoumali,2011-01-27T20:22Z,i swear i stopped watching the show since the fillers started
,SitAm,2011-01-28T08:21Z,"Please don't hate too much on the filler, people!  It was nice to see some Hidden Leaf history.

Yeah, I know there was a lot of cheesy stuff going on, but we got some good back story.  And it also means we can expect to see deceased characters again, like Jiraiya, etc.  So it's all good!!!"
