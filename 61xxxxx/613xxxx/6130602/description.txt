Gareth Owen at Electronic Beats Online:

Side project of Jonas Kenton and Silas Moldenhawer, aka Kenton Slash Demon, When Saints Go Machine is a decidedly poppier affair compared to the duo's club focused house music. Which is no surprise really, as they are joined by Nikolaj Manuel Vonsild on vocals andSimon Muschinskyon synths

Having released one album - 2009's Ten Makes A Face through EMI in their native Denmark, the four piece have now signed to Germany's !K7 to bring us Fail Forever, a sort of mini-album / EP. Short sharp and sweet, the five songs on Fail Forever are gone almost as soon as they arrive, but leave a lingering impression that will keep sending you back to the beginning to start over again.

Perfectly formed pop-vignettes, the band set out as they mean to go on on the title track, bringing to mind Hercules and Love Affair's 'Blind' - soaring strings and androgynous vocals over a skipping beat. 'Pick Up Your Tears And Run' pours layers of soothing harmonies over a beat that sounds like a sub-aquatic metal forge, whereas my personal highlight 'Pinned' brings to mind Toto and Men At Work in a way that is nowhere close to the cheese-fest you may imagine.
