,MrHunter050,2011-02-20T00:46Z,"Some virus-scanner might recognize the header of a packed .exe file , in this
case its the file > Doom3.exe < as a lame virus, because its  
the byte by byte check error of some virustools!. but Its almost certainly a false positive alert from overly protective heuristics,
you can read more about in your VirusTool-Manual or VirusTools-WebSite!."
