,Saki33,2011-04-25T15:33Z,"Thanks. Crack worked perfectly.

Note for updating program: after updating it will revert to evaluation mode, so you will have to delete avcdrm.dll file in the AnvSoft folder and insert the crack again, so be sure to save the crack.

Btw, this program will burn dvd's with subtitles too. "

Works perfectly.

Thanks HB."

[V],JanOve2011,2011-05-04T03:08Z,"I downloaded the latest version of ""Any Video Converter Pro"" (3.2.2) from the manufacturer's site and used the .dll crack from this torrent. Seems to work. Thanks!"
,YtownRedRum187,2011-05-31T06:04Z,"I, too, was concerned about updating the software and the effects it would have. After reading the post by JanOve, I'm gonna' do the same. My dumb ass replaced the file before making a copy of it and now I have to redownload from you just to get the original cracked .dll. HeH! I'm a PB newbie."
,Malasky,2011-06-03T19:27Z,"Thank you so much for this upload. Works a treat. Crack also works with latest version (3.2.3).
Top uploader!"
