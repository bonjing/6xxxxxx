Shoot Like a Pro! Digital Photography Techniques 

Photographer Julie Adair King is the author of several popular books about digital
photography and photo editing. Her most recent titles include Digital Photography For
Dummies, Photo Retouching and Restoration For Dummies, Easy Web Graphics, and
Adobe PhotoDeluxe For Dummies.

To get good results from a digital camera, you need to understand traditional
photography controls, such as exposure and focus options. Thatâ€™s only half

balance, resolution, and image file formats.
