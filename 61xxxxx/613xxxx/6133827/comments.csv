Thanks for sharing!"
,walktheword,2011-01-29T09:26Z,"With some effort you can deal with these bitcomet torrents. I will explain how using utottent, but you can do it for any client.

First add the torrent to your client but in a stopped state, so that you don't start downloading the stupid padding files. Then click the files tab. Click the path column, to order them alphabetically, getting all the padding files lined up, probably at the beginning. Finally select all of them, right-click and select ""Don't Download"" to skip them. End of story. Instead of hundreds of these little files you get only one ""remainder"" file that utorrent creates.

But it gets even better. When you're done with the torrent (download, seed and everything) you delete the torrent and even the remainder file is gone. Problem solved!

PS Copy-paste this everywhere you see a torrent with padding files, so that users of regular clients can deal with these torrents."
,mihaifox,2011-01-29T11:06Z,"I think people already knew that you can chose what files to download when starting a torrent like skipping the little sample file on a tv show episode torrent,but its good to inform those who dont know
""Some knowledge will never be shared, not from a desire to conceal it, but because it is so common to the individual that it is assumed to be already known. """
,mihaifox,2011-01-31T20:15Z,@rhflem12345 I think The Alaskan Bootleggers Bible has winemaking and other stuff.
