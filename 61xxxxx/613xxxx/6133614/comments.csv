,mrtolengo,2011-02-03T19:05Z,Any help to get the linux (rpm) version? Thanks.
,DJ__LG,2011-02-17T09:22Z,Thanks
,boring123,2011-03-22T09:35Z,Are you sure this works with games? I can't find any listed as supported.
,chiant,2011-03-29T14:18Z,May i know about CrossOver n CrossOver game gt wat difference?
,Karilyn,2011-03-30T17:16Z,"Upon downloading CrossOver 10 Pro, I found that it was unable to run games.  I found myself confused by this; as NyaTaku said, Crossover 10 Pro is supposed to include both Crossover and Crossover Games.

Upon poking my nose around Crossover's website, I realized that both me and NyaTaku misunderstood what that meant.  Crossover Pro does not include the functionalities of both.  Rather, the purchase of Crossover Pro from CodeWeavers gives you a complimentary CD key for Crossover Games.

Crossover and Crossover Games are still two separate applications.  Crossover Pro is not the functionality of both.  This torrent only includes Crossover."
,User_2011,2011-04-06T01:56Z,Is this the real purchased version or a Trial version?
,NyaTaku,2011-04-27T11:51Z,It's the real one.
,dauberbanaan,2011-04-29T19:48Z,"Thanks, probably gonna buy this. Is it true that if you purchase it that you get both the CXGames and regular CX versions?"
,NyaTaku,2011-04-30T15:35Z,"Yes, you get both."
,SlyDogHame,2011-05-04T14:42Z,"disc image fails to mount for me. any ideas?

,lyovlee,2011-05-18T17:07Z,is this the full version?
,Kamori,2011-05-23T00:34Z,"Works well, although have not found a use for it since there is a Mac replica for nearly everything I need."
,thapheon1,2011-05-28T17:11Z,seed...
,NyaTaku,2011-05-29T03:38Z,56 seeders should be sufficient.
,miloso,2011-06-03T21:57Z,Just wanted to ask if there isn't new version of CrossOver? :-)
,NyaTaku,2011-06-11T07:09Z,"When there is, I will upload it."
,zady888,2011-06-18T15:12Z,"Please upload the new crossover there's a new one out. :)

Great torrent though! Big Help! Thanks! :)"

,FlyersPh9,2011-08-22T18:35Z,"I'm downloading this right now, but I am running OSX Lion 10.7.1...from what I have read online, Crossover 10.1 and Crossover Games 10.1.1 are required to run on Lion.

Is there a fix or a more up-to-date torrent for Lion users?"
