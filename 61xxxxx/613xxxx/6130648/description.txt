"A Doctor Time Out"

The city is buzzing with the annual festival, 
but when a live wire electrocutes a young man 
and causes a citywide blackout, Mina and Otis 
fight for his life. Meanwhile a dangerous 
mudslide leaves a young pregnant couple in 
peril and the doctors scrambling to save them 
both.

Enjoy Greys of the Jungle :)
