,Td2j,2011-01-30T22:00Z,Thanks. It's quite easy to install and it's a very useful soft.
,dude8888,2011-01-31T17:12Z,"seems to work OK

no virus or spyware detected

DVDFab 8.0.7.3 - Final.txt directions are incorrect....it says to copy crack (there is none)

all components are set to NEVER EXPIRE"
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2011-02-02T18:56Z,"dude is correct. The directions are incorrect, must be remnants from an older version. That's kinda sloppy. However it installed OK and was preactivated as claimed, no further action required. Thanks."
,jr153,2011-02-09T23:56Z,"Ive never had any problems with your prgms until now. This version seems to only work for awhile, like a trial version then says ""dvd copy has expired"" plus you can no longer use ""customize"" option anymore. All the versions that say ""dvd copy (gold) seem to expire even though it says ""never expires"". Is there a fix for this? Same thing happens for version 8068.."
,evilspellcaster,2011-02-23T18:52Z,Works! Thanks :-)
