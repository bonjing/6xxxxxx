,DaniGamer,2011-06-08T09:55Z,Screens ? but still many thanx.. :) 
,technosailor,2011-06-11T06:38Z,"I'm greatful for this movie, I just simply love the new batman movies and the quality is theater quality, but it can be improved, I usggest the following:
Audio: HE-AACv2 (SBR+PS, yours is SBR only) AAC 6CH 64Khz Kbps
Video: MPEG4 H.264 not AVC, H.264 compresses a little better with a litle better higher quality."
,umarnawazkhan,2011-06-23T03:12Z,has this movie been copped ?
,JordanMason,2011-06-28T04:38Z,"Video: 10

,mexihcatl,2011-09-18T23:33Z,Can you guys start seeding this movie again please
,PauloFran,2011-10-17T01:09Z,"Nice video quality for the file size.
Many thanks!"
,Fenton_Beasley,2011-10-23T05:48Z,Excellent quality. You'll never see a better 920MB version than this
,mr.funkalicous,2011-11-26T00:58Z,Thanks man :D
,seedlikecrazy,2011-12-11T00:53Z,"Good quality for the size of the file, but I agree with technosailor. You could improve the video by using H264 compression, at higher bitrates (766kbps is low for a ""720p"", 950~1050 is nice for that resolution). And you could use HE-AAC compression for the audio at 64~84kbps, still using 2 channels. HE-AAC compresses way better than the normal AAC. I would recommend you to use HE-AACv2, but some players use to have problems in running it.
Don't bother increasing the torrents size from 0,9gb to 1,1gb, most of the people won't care, even because those xvid crap thats comming these days are 640x480 and are way heavier (1,4gb). Graphics 2x better for only +200mb in the size. PLEASE."
,galaxyeater,2011-12-11T06:00Z,"I hate to break it to you but this is not 720p. Pretty disappointed as I was looking forward to watching this movie tonight but now I have to redownload it elsewhere. It is good quality, but not 720p. Thanks anyway!"
,seedlikecrazy,2011-12-13T18:07Z,"galaxyeater, it's 720p. The only difference is that it's cropped."
,xodarap7,2011-12-19T09:59Z,"After years of downloading hundreds of torrents here, I've never felt compelled to comment before today.  THAT'S how much this annoyed me:

AVC *IS* H264!

It's two different names for a compression standard, technically: ""ISO/IEC 14496-10 â MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding"""
,Aim_To_Maim,2012-02-10T07:50Z,"Why is this the most seeded Batman Begins Hi Res file on PB, its under 1 GB is obviously shit and not 720p at all. wtf?"
,shullee,2012-04-13T21:20Z,Thanks
