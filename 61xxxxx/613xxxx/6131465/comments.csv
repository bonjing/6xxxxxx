,Tribellion,2011-01-29T03:09Z,"Thanks BOZX, great upload, great quality. This film will be worth getting in true 720p and 1080p when available however. Great acting."
,torrentic,2011-02-06T12:59Z,"Thanks for the share.
Unfortunately, after the middle of the film,
sound loses sync, and gradually even more."
,Asylumpz,2011-02-06T20:38Z,Audio is off.  Boo.
,Koolshrooms,2011-02-11T04:46Z,"movie is perfect, no audio problems at all... if the sound loses sync its because of your computer. it played fine on mine"

GOM Player indicates this as a 720p resolution video. Without any detectable video distortion I can see I would say this is a legitimate 720p transcoding.

Also there were no sync issues anywhere in TiMPE's encode. Most likely (and I have experienced this myself) persons who have audio sync issues are dropping frames do to inadequate processor power or a Codec conflict.

Kudos to BOZX for giving credit to your source and for your great efforts to keep these files alive ensuring the freedom of sharing.

P.S.> Screen links will work if you ""Copy and Paste"" to your address bar. The problem of ""redirection"" is site related and not the fault of BOZX.

i think just more people say the audio is fucked up in the other one more than this one."
,OG_1337,2011-03-01T12:22Z,"DO NOT WATCH THE SAMPLE UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPOIL THE WHOLE MOVIE!
DAMN YOU BOZX!

but seriously thanks for the movie! :)"
,ironsun,2011-05-07T20:16Z,"Audio is fucked - dont bother. V = 10, A  = 0. Wankers."
,genzeleam,2011-09-05T04:17Z,"Weird audio. It's a shame because the video is great. I just can't get passed the audio problem.

A=4 V=10"
