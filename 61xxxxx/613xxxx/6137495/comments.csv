Oddly enough, Every single keygen that has ever been made has tested as a false positive as a ""trojan"". It reads and manipulates memory in a way that isn't supposed to happen (because it is illegal). This isn't the type of Trojan that will steal your credit card, it is the type that cracks software illegally for free-use. "
