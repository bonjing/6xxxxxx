with the highest respect, I have been a fan of all your adobe torrents. now I have come in despair, asking if you could upload PREZI DESKTOP that will stay in my computer forever. It is far more superior than powerpoint and it is way too expensive to be a pro member. you would have saved my life if ever. I have not came to anyone else but you for this.

thank you so much and even a simple reply would be greatly appreciated.
