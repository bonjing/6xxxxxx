I hate the way folks are so quick to make a movie out of the guy's life just because he was famous, sort of. I am sure someone is going to scream, ""Tillman was a hero. Look what he gave up to serve his country."" First of all, heroes do what they do for free. They don't get paid for it. Second of all, big deal, he gave up football and fame. So what? I am sure when he was going in he thought he was going to be someone special and that everyone would form a barrier around him where ever he went so he'd be safe. Well, he was wrong. Now, just because he gave up fame and such, folks think that he gave up so much. No he didn't. What he gave up is not any more important that what the kid from Brooklyn gave up. When you join the military, you sign on to give up your life if need be, and he was called on it. He was doing his job and he was being paid to do it, and, unfortunately, he was killed doing that job. Yes, I admire him for serving, but he wasn't any more special than the thousands of non-famous solders killed.

Let's stop this foolish way of thinking."
