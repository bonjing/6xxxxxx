Autograph - Blondes In Black Cars [promo].VOB



HQ very rare promo music video. "Blondes In Black Cars" is a single from That's the Stuff, the second album by the American melodic hard rock band Autograph. 

A different version of the album surfaced later in 1986, featuring a blue cover with slightly different artwork. This version of the album found the track "We're an American Band" replacing "Six String Fever" as track 6. The singles released off the album were That's The Stuff and Blondes In Black Cars.

A remastered version of the original album (red cover) was released by Spitfire Records in 2002, which retained the same track listing as the original, apart from the substitution of "Six String Fever" with a cover of Grand Funk Railroad's "We're an American Band" as track #6.

Autograph was an American hard rock band from Los Angeles, California. Active on RCA from 1984 to 1989, they sold 1.5 million records and were awarded gold with their "Sign In Please" album. A new version of the band (v2.02) was formed 
by their founder Steve Plunkett in 2002 for a single album. They have been inactive since 2005.

They have toured with Motley Crue, Heart, Aerosmith, Ronnie James Dio, Van Halen, Bryan Adams, and Whitesnake.
