The Fun Way to Create Stylish Disc Labels

LabelPrint is a specialized tool for creating and printing various types of CD/DVD labels including disc labels, jewel-case cover sheets, and jewel-case inlays. Using the pleasing, built-in background images, you can easily create and print your own professional-looking disc labels in the blink of an eye.

4 Quick Steps for Creating Disc Label Designs
CyberLink LabelPrint is label-making software that lets you design and print stylish CD/DVD labels in 4 easy steps. Just select your template type, disc information, text layout, background image, and print destination. LabelPrint supports layout and printing on a broad range of templates from leading label brands.

Improved Direct-to-Disc Label Burning: Labelflash and LightScribe
LabelPrint supports Labelflash and LightScribe technology, allowing you to "etch" image designs and text onto the surface of your Labelflash and LightScribe discs. LabelPrint recognizes if a burner and disc support these technologies, then provides the option to burn.

Music Track Lists Can be Transferred Between Layouts
Work with MP3 audio files to create numbered track lists quickly, simply by selecting the files you have added to your disc. The information is automatically transferred between layout templates, thus enabling creation of labels, jewel-case covers and inlays in one go.

Improved Output to Commercial Label Templates - Football Designs
LabelPrint supports a broad range of commercial templates from leading label brands. A built-in library of high-resolution images provides a choice of 16 popular themes, including Travel, Happy Birthday, and now Football (i.e. Soccer). You can also import your own image files and then stretch, tile or crop them to fit your label and cover designs.

Q: \'I download this movie/video, but there\'s only picture in it, no sounds. Why??\'
A: It\'s because you\'re missing certain codecs. There\'s 2 option to this ; 
   
   OPTION 1: Download & install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: 

   http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm
   
   OPTION 2: Download & install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you\'ve downloaded

Q: \'I download a keygen from a user & my AV flagged it as a virus!\'
A: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. 

   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.
   
   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user & check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. 

   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.
   IF YES, most probably it\'s false positive.

   Well, if you\'re still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum & report it here: 
   http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    

Q: \'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?\'

Q: \'I registered an account on TPB, but i don\'t receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?\'
