[T],qwersd,2011-01-28T17:23Z,congrats on your 1st upload...
[T],qwersd,2011-01-28T17:24Z,hope u do more handheld stuff...
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-01-28T17:33Z,"@the Rev... 

i have not downloaded your torrent yet, but have found on Handbreak, in the 'quality' part, dont select ""Avg Bitrate (kbps)"" instead just leave it at what it is at, ""constant quality"" RF:20 

the results are amazing, but you pay for it with more megabites, but i think its worth it? give it a try... "
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-01-28T17:35Z,"forgot to say, you dont do a 2-pass on the setting i described, but in my opinion the end result was far better than a 2-pass 400kbps "
