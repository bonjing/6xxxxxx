Storyline:


In this irresistible family comedy, hothead college basketball coach Roy McCormick (Martin Lawrence) is more interested in endorsement deals than in winning games. And after an on-court meltdown, Roy is about to lose everything unless he can prove he can win games without losing his cool.

Enter the Smelters, a wise-cracking junior high squad that's never won a game. Reluctantly taking on the team of hapless hoopsters, Roy uses his coaching magic to teach the kids the importance of dedication and teamwork on the hilarious road to the championship. Roy finds new love along the way, and rediscovers his first true love - basketball!
