Shattered S01E11 - She Had You Fooled (in described video) 

The body of a woman who was stabbed to death is found floating in the ocean. Meanwhile, one of Ben's alters spends the night drinking heavily with an old friend of his wife, and when he wakes up, she appears to have overdosed. 

According to wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_%282010_TV_series%29 ), this is actually episode 6, but this wasn't aired by Showcase Canada in their initial run of 10 of the 13 episodes.

This episode was recorded from The Accessible Channel (TAC - http://www.theaccessiblechannel.com/ ) on Jan 20, 2011. Apparently it aired on Showcase Canada on Dec 31, 2010, but it was not recorded at that time.

This episode is in described video, which means that much of the onscreen action is described in the audio in addition to the regular audio. The effect is a bit disconcerting, but shouldn't be a big problem for fans of this show.

The video quality is quite watchable but nowhere near the quality of HDTV scene releases. This was recorded from a non-HD source.
