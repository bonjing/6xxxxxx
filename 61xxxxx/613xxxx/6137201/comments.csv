I notice you do a lot of BRRips... They are amazing quality for the size that they are but I was wondering can anyone assist me in making my own BDRip (not to be confused with BRRip... I want to make a .mkv or .avi file FROM my original BluRay Disk...) I have searched on the net but I havent found any easy and reliable guides.

I do not know if BDRips have a size limit but im aiming to get anything under 3-4GB... I also need subtitles to go with it... 

Contact me on: BIack_Beast@hotmail.com 
Cheers all, love your work Neon"
