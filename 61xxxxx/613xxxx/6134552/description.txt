Engineer Isaac Clarke returns in Dead Space 2 for another blood-curdling adventure in the sequel to the
critically acclaimed Dead Space.

After waking from a coma on a massive space city known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Sprawl\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the lone survivor of a horrific
alien infestation finds himself confronting a catastrophic new nightmare. Battling dementia, hunted by
the government, and haunted by visions of his dead girlfriend, Isaac will do whatever it takes to save
himself and dominate the gruesome onslaught.

With an arsenal of tools to dismember Necromorphs and new determination, an engineer will bring the terror
to space.
