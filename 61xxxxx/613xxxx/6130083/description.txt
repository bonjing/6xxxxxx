One of Riefenstahl's early silent films, in the mountain-film genre which so much fascinated her. The story is a bit melodramatic, but the photography and art-direction make it well woth seeing.

It probably inspired The Abominable Snowman (1957), which seems to have disappeared from TPB - I'll have to post it sometime.
