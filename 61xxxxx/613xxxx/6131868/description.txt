Version 1.3 includes the following updates: 

New / fixed: 

Fixed problem creating the Wutangrza LV1/LV2 Peek And Poke Fw.

As this is an update of the executable, if you do not have all the files from previous versions, you must download the archive of 1.2b and simply replace the executable with that from the archive 1.3.

Download the official 3.55 fw
Creating different custom firmwares
Verification (after downloading and creation) of the MD5sum

New / fixed:
