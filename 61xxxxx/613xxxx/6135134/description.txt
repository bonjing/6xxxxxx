A conglomeration of several political activist documentaries together on one "movie" DVD. This is an attempt at packing the biggest "punch" in one DVD title. I call the DVD's, "Awake & Aware" after a similarly titled conference in LA September 2009. Enjoy and please spread around :)

P.S. a few mentionables in the DVD:

Who Killed the Electric Car
Free Global Energy
Project Camelot: Interview with Benjamin Fulford
Disclosure Project: with Dr. Greer
John Todd: Explaining the Illuminati
Who Killed the Water Car
...and a few others.
