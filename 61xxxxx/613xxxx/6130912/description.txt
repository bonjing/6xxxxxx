Don Angel (Wayne Hope) is a small businessman- the backbone of this great country's economy. But if that's true, it's no thanks to him. After numerous unsuccessful ventures, Don's Worldwide Business Group is now hurtling towards liquidation. His debts are mounting his stomach's killing him, his wife left him, and he's just hired Ray Leonard as his sole employee. It's a marriage made in heaven - at least until the Tax Office gets there.
