BDK NOTES
Well here i go with my version of Narnia. i know there is several out there already but everyone has got their taste. thanks to ELEKTRI4KA for the R5. on to the work. this one was a little heavy on the red a little dark and a little noisy. adjusted the red also the hue and saturation along with brightness and black levels denoised and sharpened. hope you all enjoy. BDK
