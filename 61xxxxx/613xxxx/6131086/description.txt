This is the full broadcast of Triple J's Hottest 100.

I've upped it in exactly the same format as I got it from Triple J rather than putting it into mp3. You can change it to something more convenient for yourself if you so desire. (I recommend the free BonkEnc audio converter) It is four parts 96kbs wma and unfortunately the parts cut songs in half. I downloaded it from this page http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/10/.

This is for anyone else who lives overseas and was asleep through most of it due to the time difference.
