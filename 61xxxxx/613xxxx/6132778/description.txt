Franceska's house is a mess! She's almost given up hope. After looking through her cleaning products and realizing she's got nothing to tackle the big mess, she's relieved to have Mr. Sins appear and give her a helping hand. Mr. Sins is great for getting rid of stubborn stains, dried up dishes, and, of course, fucking Franceska's brain out.
