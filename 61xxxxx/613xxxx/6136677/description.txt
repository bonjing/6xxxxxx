Jaia (JaÃ¯a) is an electronic music project from France. It was founded in 1995 by Yannis Kamarinos and Jean-michel Blanchet, but since 2000 Yannis is working alone under the Jaia name.

The first album, Blue Energy, was released in 1998. Two years later it was re-released with an additional CD under the name Blue Energy/Blue Synergy. In 2005 the next album - Fiction appeared. Compared to the previous CDs, it isn't a typical goa-trance CD, but a crossover between progressive trance, progressive house, psy morning trance and electro.
