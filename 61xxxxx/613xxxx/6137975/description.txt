PLOT
Britt Reid is the son of LA's most prominent and respected
media magnate and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless 
existence on the party scene -- until his father mysteriously dies,
leaving Britt his vast media empire. Striking an unlikely 
friendship with one of his father's more industrious and inventive employees, Kato, they see their chance to do something meaningful for the first time
in their lives: fight crime. But in order to do this, they decide 
to become criminals themselves -- protecting the law by breaking it, Britt 
becomes the vigilante The Green Hornet as he and Kato hit the streets.

Using all his ingenuity and skill, Kato builds the ultimate in 
advanced retro weaponry, The Black Beauty, an indestructible car equal parts
firepower and horsepower. Rolling in a mobile fortress on wheels and
striking the bad guys with Kato's clever gadgets, The Green Hornet 
and Kato quickly start making a name for themselves, and with the help of 
Britt's new secretary, Lenore Case, they begin hunting down the man who 
controls LA's gritty underworld: Benjamin Chudnofsky. But Chudnofsky has 
plans of his own: to swat down The Green Hornet once and for all.
