2010 - Creation De L'Univers


"...I would quickly recommend this album to anyone who's interested in either Zeuhl or fusion. As for the Zeuhl end, it's one of the most accessible entry points into the genre I've heard so far, which is a plus. The vocals on the album aren't as "goofy" as with some of the better known bands (really, the vocals are sparse and sort of otherworldly)..."

"...the band offers a fresh and inspired melting pot of slightly dark avant jazz-rock, created by a trio of drums, bass and organ/mellotron, with the occasional help from guest vocals and sax. The band sounds very confident and keeps their improvisations very focused, never too long or indulging in unnecessary solos...
...Creation De L'Univers is a superb album with a certain spot in my 2010 top 10. I'd recommend it to all fans of early 70s jazz-rock, RIO and Zeuhl..."
