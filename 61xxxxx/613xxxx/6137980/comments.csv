This is one of the best movie versions of Swan Lake. Yelena Yevteyeva is nothing short of amazing. Her Odile is vicious and glamorous; her Swan Queen is gentle and touching. V. Panov is wonderful as the jester/fool. His jumps are fantastic. The sets and costumes are sumptuous-- it's a visual feast all around. 

I hope we get some seeds for this. Anyone who loves ballet should see this version of it. "

Since I'm only a student and can't afford no 50âŹ ticket to the ballet, downloading it and watching it on tv would be my best solution ;)"
