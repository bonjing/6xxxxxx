[T],HDSceneRG,2011-01-28T19:07Z,"Yes making H.264 QT compatible reduces quality because of changes in some fields,QT support for mp4 is poor-for example: QuickTime does NOT support 8x8 dct and intra prediction,which is embarrassing; so try playing in KMPlayer,or Media Player Classic,or BSPlayer,GOM player etc or even VLC or WMP."
