WikiLeaks.ch CableGate update for January 30th, 2011 (11:26AM Swiss time).

If you're seeding an older CableGate torrent, seed this instead.  Pirate Bay sometimes tends to be a few days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html .

If you run a local WikiLeaks "pull" / "scrape" mirror (search P2P networks for "wikileaks scrape"), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or p7zip for any operating system.

The bad guys can put up blocks to all HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!
