,crcjetty,2011-01-29T22:57Z,"i have this problem with the menu. it jumps towards the bottom of the screen & i can't control it. if i pull my mouse toward the bottom, the menu comes up to the middle but constantly jumps to the bottom & is unusable..
i also notice that when i pull my mouse toward the bottom, the characters change on the menu buttons. they change to A or B as if i had a controller attached. i don't have anything attached except mouse & keyboard."
,wetal1961,2011-01-29T23:11Z,"thanks, I seed"
,Unit431,2011-01-29T23:45Z,"crcjetty, I had the exact same problem, though I fixed it by unplugging my Logitech joystick. Since you say you don't have any other controllers plugged in, maybe try removing any non essential USB devices."
,osjjdb89,2011-01-30T02:51Z,is this a new crack?how do i use it?should i use this one instead of the old crack?please guide me
,ThuyDez,2011-01-30T03:55Z,"@osjjdb89

It's a fix for the old Crack you had to get to play it, and works the exactly same way. just overwrite the old deadspace2.exe and play."
,chip211,2011-01-30T05:24Z,"i was going to buy it but then i got to download the REAL thing and the fixed crack

thank you fairlight you saved me 60$= 240 $ in my country 

yes its the dollar exchange around here "
,osjjdb89,2011-01-30T05:38Z,"thnx ThuyDez
so i should treat this as a new crack and ignore the old1?(which caused the crash in chap7)?
also,this should surely work with the 10GB FLT version?plz rply"
,ThuyDez,2011-01-30T11:23Z,"Yes Osj, it's even in the name."
,loax12,2011-01-30T12:13Z,"TY once again mate!!

,ThuyDez,2011-01-30T13:25Z,Now that's odd... I keep having what seems to be semi-random timed crashes (about 30 minutes of playing) since I put in this crackfix..
,ThuyDez,2011-01-30T13:48Z,"Actually nevermind, It's localized.

Chapter 12 on the Drill. 3/3 times crashed."
,conn144,2011-01-30T16:29Z, i removed the  dead space 2 launcher or name and put the crack in its place it says dead space 2 shortcut now  but when i launch it it stays on a black screen and goes no where please help me i might not be able to check on here for the rest of the day so please email me at connweezy@yahoo.com  
,conn144,2011-01-30T16:32Z,if u also can just put it on here if u dont want to email me but please help me out ill keep checkin all day to see if you respond thank you in advance 
,somedude.1001,2011-01-30T19:59Z,Is this the one that crash randomly?
,Ahroo,2011-01-31T22:00Z,Right click the crack and copy it over instead of dragging it over. I had the same problem.
,Homlessd00d,2011-02-01T17:00Z,BEST GAME! BEST CRACK!
,VictorVonTerror,2011-02-02T04:17Z,"Hey guys, quick question about this crackfix that I haven't quite found an answer to skimming these comments.

About the crackfix. Do I need the regular crack first? The first FLT crack that crashes. 

OR

will this work AS the crack by itself?

Thanks"
,somedude.1001,2011-02-02T12:22Z,"IDK but there are 2 crackfix-flts, one is 20mb the other 60mb."
,koentjuh,2011-02-02T17:33Z,"Hey,
Thanks for the fix. I now have a different crash though, I don't know if it's because of the crack but it's always in the same space.

Chapter 9. You've already joined with the girl, and you go on yourself (with the burning elevator thingies). You get to a point where you can go up to the left 2 times (After each other). The first one has some items and is cut of by some (shootable lasers), the second one continues the route and you bump into the wall monster (one that is stuck on the wall and spawns out babies). It drops a gold mainframe. Once I enter the elevator to the right of it to continue the objective the game freezes with a Send Report when the elevator has almost reached the next stage.

Any help appreciated ;)"
