,mendota,2011-07-17T00:10Z,"great upload! this patches up the holes i had in their catalog. i keep checking their store, but they never sell their EPs.

though, i gotta say. there's like 10 of us stuck about 200kb short of 100%

seed?"

If you're stuck like 99.9%, go to files in utorrent and scroll down for the incompleted files, it should be one song at 85% and a ds_store file.
