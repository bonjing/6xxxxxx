          o Impossible: Sudokus with so few numbers, you'll have to guess
    * Entry of possible solutions for empty boxes (hold down shift and a number from the standard number row, not the numeric keypad)
    * Automatic saving of your game on exit
    * "Check Game" feature to check your current work
    * "Solve Game" feature so you can see the solution to the current puzzle
