Is there anything wrong with this torrent?
utorrent finds 17 seeds that I canÂ´t connect to but only 1 shows up on pirate bay.

btw thanks for the upload."

,ecosaturn,2011-02-09T15:30Z,Hi..just queued the Spaghetti Western TRILOGY.Finished the first one the good the bad and the ugly..but by default its playing in spanish..if i use VLC feature i can play in english but is there a to shut off the spanish keeping in my mind i would eventually be playing it through hard drive players in my HDTV..also in media player you can here spanish n english both which is quite odd n irritating.I hope the other two r not same in the trilogy.
