,MoltThug,2011-01-28T07:08Z,Better call Kenny Loggins because eztv is in the DANGERZONE!
,hootieman,2011-01-28T08:50Z,Umm is it me or should this be labeled 2011 S02E01? FAIL
,hysteric_,2011-01-28T12:41Z,"""Archer 2009 S02"" is correct, because it denotes the starting year of the entire show, not just the current series. See ""Doctor Who 2005 S05"" for another example."
,sbletch,2011-01-28T16:36Z,"Great Job as always ez, and Great episode too nice to see a show not ""tinkered with and ruined"" like so many others 

Cheers !!!

and seeding"
,honunet,2011-01-28T16:52Z,"Or ""V"" 2009...  Is it me or does everyone love it when noobs try to clown somebody else and wind up showing their own ignorance?  Hootieman=FAIL"
,PurityDeath,2011-01-29T00:45Z,"If they don't understand why something is a certain way and question it that's not necessarily a bad thing. Yes he shouldn't have added something retarded like ""FAIL"" at the end but in the end I believe we're probably all guilty of this at one time or another...

At any rate if he ever reads these comments again which is doubtful he'll learn something.

""Fuck you, Switzerland!"" XD"
