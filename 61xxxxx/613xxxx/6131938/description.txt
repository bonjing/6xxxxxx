This is LFS S1 like it used to be... Re-released in January 2011, again in all it's glory!

Inspired by some community members trying to get an old S1 version working, with some success, we decided to see if we could help. After digging up the source code for a reliable old test patch S1H6, released in March 2005, in a few hours it was up and running again. Three small changes were needed so that :

- it works with the new master server
- it can be unlocked on the latest Windows versions
- there is no need to earn credits to unlock cars

You will need to activate your LFS S1, which will work with any previously registered S1-S2 account you already have (not pirated) on LFS.

This version LFS is now also available to download via the LFS website:

For people looking for a cracked online version of LFS S1/S2: No, this is not a cracked version. 

But it does work for online gameplay in S1. You do not need to create an account to play online, but if you register for LFS S1/S2 you have the ability to race more cars and access more tracks than DEMO users...


Thank you!

PLEASE Seed, don't just hit and run, otherwise torrents will die!
