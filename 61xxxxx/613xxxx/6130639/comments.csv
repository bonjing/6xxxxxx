,olyk613,2011-01-28T01:52Z,"I love your torrents and the quality is equell to the EzTv ones and there half the size great for people with low download quotas like me. Just wondering if you do ""Desperate Housewives"" season 7. It would be great if you could. I only  need episodes 8-13. Thanks for your great work."
,olyk613,2011-01-28T12:47Z,"One small problem with this torrent. I lose sound at 33 minutes 19 seconds. Have tried playing with VLC, media player classic, and GOM. Please re-up."
[T],MelloYello,2011-02-05T06:04Z,I also lost sound.  Don't download.
