,perckypick,2011-01-27T02:29Z,"Google Translate is saying something about UFO's (he's speaking in Portugese).

...Whatever


Seriously, this January fucking SUCKED for flight sim. Aerosoft, FTX, PMDG, Level-D and pretty much every other big dev hasn't released anything new...and hardly any new torrents."
,jager963,2011-01-27T02:40Z,"Yep I Want this too, You all need this it's really first class...By the way sosi...What is it?"
,bmar2,2011-01-27T04:06Z,"Yea, We need the new FSCrew2 for Ifly"
,rapterman,2011-01-27T11:00Z,so come on guys what is this like in fsx
,Jimstalk,2011-01-27T11:10Z,to be honest with you ive never seen a UFO from the cockpit
,VED25,2011-01-27T14:01Z,"This is proably some freeware stuff.. everyone is stil waiting for a cracked 707, the dream of many simmers.. but where are the good crackers in 2011? "
,rapterman,2011-01-27T14:36Z,they are all in the nick. or just that they say they can crack ?
,Jimstalk,2011-01-27T17:03Z,"@VED25

The 707 is nothing special....The cockpit is very detailed and fully clickable but on the other hand its a ""Memory bomber"".Youll need a strong RAM (4-8gb) to fly with it smoothly

im using win7 32 bit with ATI RADEON 5850//4 gb memory and intel core i7.I managed to fix the ""out of memory""error buy changing the USERVA entry but  im still experiencing problems with the 707 (sometimes i cant see the model...)"
,Thyx747,2011-01-27T18:28Z,this is freeware
,VaticanCity,2011-01-27T18:44Z,All very good mentions.The thing to remember is though a 32bit pc is only max capable of 4GBS Max.But I believe to be better as of yet.The 64 bit gives you min 4 and up.The problem is how many cores because than your really into your CPU out put.Now you may have a nice chuck but if its quad core really than how much is it.
,VaticanCity,2011-01-27T18:46Z,"So what actually Im saying is. Depending on the cores and CPU outage is what makes and breaks the deal.Usually the best be is to have your PC tailored for your self, but in saying that for the 1 sim is very expensive don't kid your self. Now the easiest way I found around this is to pick where you usually fly."
,VaticanCity,2011-01-27T18:48Z,So once you know that tailor your Sim to it.A couple of airport far of here and thier won't make that much of a dif.But once you load every aerosoft product known to man king your screwd.So pick wisesly.do you do long flight.short flights.do you do carriers.set up based upon these elements and youll run faster.Make sure to shut down non essentials while simming guys.Safe flying.
,aarque,2011-01-27T19:44Z,Jim you wouldn't see a UFO if it was siphoning gas from your plane ;P
[T],stevekasian,2011-02-01T10:52Z,"@VaticanCity: CORRECTION - 32bit machines are only capable of utilizing 3GB of RAM, not 4GB. Get your shit straight you fuck!"
,merkava_bob,2011-02-13T14:30Z,"This is wonderful!!! Brilliant, Yes I know its not real  but you've got a deeply happy and engrossed 12 year old stepson called Stang, using the flight sim to his hearts content.
Muchas Gracias"
,saintamadas,2011-06-20T19:54Z,Thanks for moving the MINISTRY (BAY) forward! You are blessed!

32 bit Computer can have maximum 4GB Ram. Perhaps you should should get your facts straight?"
