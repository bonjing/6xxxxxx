I thought TPB was usually full of intelligent people who wouldn't fall for any conspiracy theory that came around, but apparently I was wrong about that."

Obama has more jews in his Administration than ALL other minorities combined and BOTH of his Supreme Court appointments are jews!  Now 1/3 of the Court are jews even though they make up less than 1/50th of the US population - that's RACISM against non-jews.  Plus Obama, like EVERY US President gives israel BILLIONS of Taxpayer dollars every year (over $7 BILLION every year since Obama took over) and then claims there's no money to rebuild New Orleans or for health care for poor children.

Save America, read the list and BOYCOTT EVERYONE on it."
