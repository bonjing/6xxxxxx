Spytector 1.3.7 - the new version of the award-winning keylogger (parental control software) is available for download.
Spytector is the ultimate invisible and undetectable keylogger (spy) software that completely satisfies your PC monitoring and surveillance needs. Spytector server is running in total stealth, undetectable even for advanced users, perfect for monitoring the way your PC is used. The trial version of Spytector is detected by few antivirus applications, even if it's not a trojan or a hacking tool. Spytector is a commercial legitimate keylogger and our customers must be able to use Spytector on their computers in the same time with other security applications, so the version they receive (the full version) will be undetected when scanned with all the well known antivirus products.
Our powerful and professional key logger can be used by home and corporate users. All the PC activity is stored in secured encrypted log files. The logs are received either by email or FTP (the log sending procedure is invisible and undetectable for many local firewalls) and afterwards they can be converted in eye catching reports by the in-built Log Viewer. The full colored logs can be saved as RTF or HTML files.

Spytector keylogger is completely stealth on the user's desktop and cannot be seen in the Task Manager, being injected into system processes. The current version of Spytector is compatible with Windows NT4/2k/XP/VISTA (32bit and 64bit)/Windows 7 (32bit and 64bit). In the case you have a different operating system (Windows 98/ME), you can use an older version of Spytector.
