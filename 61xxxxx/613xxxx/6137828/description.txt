PLOT:
Slacker Dino Rado, and his uptight partner, Steven Scheere
made a bad investment. They borrowed money to fund a "B" movie 
that flopped big time and now the Jamaican Mob wants it's money
back. As a last resort they steal and idea from a screenplay
to cast unsuspecting actors to pull off a real heist. Their
plan is flawless, until they put it into action. Dino and Steven
didn't plan on getting shot at, beat up, and even worse,
falling in love.
