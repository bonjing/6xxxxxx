Tonight's Show: Stossel Balances the Budget (FBN @ 9pm & Midnight ET)

Earlier this week, I wondered how the president would â€œcast himself as more of a fiscal hawkâ€ in Tuesdayâ€™s State of the Union Address, as Reuters reported. Well, I got my answer: He proposed to freeze non-defense, discretionary spending for five years, which he claims would â€œreduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade.â€

$400 Billion sounds like a lotâ€¦but thatâ€™s spread out over ten years, so itâ€™s really more like $40 Billion per year. The CBO projects the average annual deficit over the next 10 years to be $768 Billion â€“ thatâ€™s nearly 20 times larger than that. â€œFiscal hawkâ€? More like â€œfiscal chickenâ€. Weâ€™re going to have to cut a lot more than $40 Billion per year if weâ€™re going to eliminate the deficit.

So, thatâ€™s just what Iâ€™ll do on tonightâ€™s show (FBN @ 9pm & midnight ET): Iâ€™ll make the big spending cuts necessary to eliminate the deficit.
