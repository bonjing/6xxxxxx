,freeholay,2011-01-29T15:47Z,"Even though TvTeam is head and shoulders above others for content and speed, have to agree to some degree about past descriptions ... I have found they are doing better today with links to imdb and such... I think most people just want screen shots and such but that's asking a lot from a group that puts up so much content. 

Big Thanks to TvTeam... your Tv content is great!

Even imdb didn't say much about this...

DESCRIPTION:
A portrait of soul legend Bill Withers.  "
