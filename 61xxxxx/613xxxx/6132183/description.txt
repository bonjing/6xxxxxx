Go from amateur fisherman to pro angler in Kevin VanDam's Big Bass Fishing. Compete in tournaments with expert advice from KVD himself as you angle for largemouth, smallmouth and spotted bass. Be careful though - these fish are ready for a fight, so choose your lure wisely or you could end up with an empty boat and wounded pride. Master your approach, and you'll be giving KVD a run for his money!
