,Starbeer,2011-08-19T04:23Z,"Thanks for the upload trentkort. 

There are only series 1, 7, 9 and 10 available. Could you upload the others, please?

Cheers, Starbeer!"

I'd be extremely grateful if you or someone else could upload the missing early series in similar quality.  Also, would it be possible to rip the English subtitles from the DVDs? There are no proper English subtitles available online for the early series, just some autotranslated from Portuguese or something. Many thanks!"
