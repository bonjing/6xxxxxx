,flextm71,2011-01-31T18:38Z,"This movie played in theaters back in October and we don't see any cam until 3 months later. What is up with that? Hell, I've waited this long, might as well wait for the dvdrip now. DVD, bluray release in March.

@Mr.Ggreen30
It's a cam! How do you get 10/10? Did you even watch it? "
,apeman73,2011-02-01T01:48Z,I don't know about anyone else but it took me hours to download this torrent only to find nothing....fake!
,wayneking,2011-02-02T02:26Z,"A decent CAM, I would give it V:8 and A:6.  There is white noise all the way through, but with the volume turned up it's not terrible.  The video quality is very good indeed FOR A CAM.

,wayneking,2011-02-02T02:28Z,"Marcel - It's a cam, so most people in here tend to bear that in mind with their ratings and rate cam's as a cam and not in comparison to a blue ray rip ir a DVD rip.  Pretty sensible really mate.   Get off your high horse!


apeman73 - no it is not a fake.  Must be something up at your end."
,staurosfonz,2011-02-05T15:28Z,thank you
,bekksii,2011-02-07T18:16Z,"for us who don't understand french, is there by any chance any subtitles out there? I'm dying to watch this movie.. watched like the first 5 minutes or so.. looks really good. love these kinda stories... but watching it and not understanding the french kinda sucks :P then i'd rather wait and go watch it at the cinema. still, good job though. good for a cam!"
,1motime,2011-02-08T07:42Z,I wish this had english subs.  I have no idea what was being said in the French scenes.
,phrend,2011-02-27T22:10Z,"First off - thanks to SAFCuk009 for the up!

I don't watch many CAM's, so I don't have much to compare this too, but the dialog is frequently difficult to hear, and the video sometimes looks like it was shot from an angle, rather than straight-on.

I found another version in the XBMC app ""Navi-X"" (http://website.navi-x.org/) that's 892MB and has much higher video quality - looks like a DVD rip to me, but I don't know what the source really was?"
,phrend,2011-02-28T01:49Z,"As an additional warning, about 15-20 minutes of this film (split up across about 4 scenes) is in French, with no subtitles.  It's enough to be annoying, but I still felt that I was able to follow the movie without knowing what was being said."
