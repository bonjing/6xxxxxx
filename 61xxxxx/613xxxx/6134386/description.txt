IMAGiNE NOTES
First off thanks to our friends at SERENiTY for the source files for this one. The video is very nice so we only had to touch it up here and there. We croped and resized it then we adjusted the contrast, brightness, gamma, and a few RGB color tweaks along with a slight sharpening filter. Next was onto the audio... We do not have any line audio available for this yet, so we decided to at least give you what we have for it now... We used our original v1 cam audio and synced it to this new video. Enjoy...

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
