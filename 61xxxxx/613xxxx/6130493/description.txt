HQ very rare promo music video. "True To You" is a song from This Side of Paradise, the second solo studio album released by Ric Ocasek, lead singer and songwriter of The Cars. Though it was a solo album, other members of The Cars made cameo appearances. This track "True to You" featured Benjamin Orr on backing vocals, Elliot Easton on guitar, and Greg Hawkes on keyboards/backing vocals. Hawkes also featured throughout the entire album on keyboards and bass. Ocasek's second album was released in 1986 by Geffen Records. Production was by Chris Hughes (drummer for Adam and the Ants).

Steve Stevens from Billy Idol's band, Roland Orzabal from Tears for Fears, Tony Levin from King Crimson/Peter Gabriel, Tom Verlaine of Television and G. E. Smith of Hall & Oates/SNL band guest on the various songs.

The first single from the album, "Emotion in Motion", which was aided in its promotion by a popular video that received heavy airplay on MTV, reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks for one week, becoming Ocasek's only solo chart-topper (as a member of The Cars, he topped the chart with the singles "You Might Think" and "Magic" in 1984, and "Tonight She Comes" in 1985).
