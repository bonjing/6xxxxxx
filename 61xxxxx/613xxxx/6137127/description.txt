James Cagney plays Martin "Moe the Gimp" Snyder, a pushy gangster who becomes smitten with taxi dancer Ruth Etting (Doris Day). She wheedles favours out of him, eventually becoming a superstar, while the deformed Snyder becomes increasingly frustrated and violent.

This is Doris Day's best performance by far, and you may be surprised at how sexy she is - in a blowzy, slinky way qite unlike her usual clean-cut image. The musical numbers are great, especially Ten Cents a Dance - you get a real feel for twenties-thirties music.
