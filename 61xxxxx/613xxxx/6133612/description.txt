Who is Gorgeous George?!?!? :
It all started when a Something Awful goon named Dr. Quinn first spotted George Alexander Yarid on public access:
There's a public/cable access host here in Richmond, VA who calls himself Gorgeous George. He's a big fat son of a bitch with greasy hair, ill-fitting clothes and a heavy dose of self-delusion. And he also looks like L. Ron Hubbard amirite? He's sort of a local celebrity - just about everyone I know has had some sort of real-life encounter with him. He's been hosting his little call-in show for about the past 10 years, I think, although my friends and I only discovered it maybe 3-4 years ago. Anyway, needless to say, we had no choice but to prank-call him relentlessly. Unfortunately, he was only on maybe 12 weeks per year.. but we made those weeks count. During any given episode, we had at least half a dozen cellphones dialing in, the end result being that literally about 90% of the calls he received were us insulting him.  - http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Gorgeous_George -
