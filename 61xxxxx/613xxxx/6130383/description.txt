Scream is the tenth studio album by English Heavy Metal musician Ozzy Osbourne. Released in the United Kingdom on 14 June 2010, the album was recorded at Osbourne's home studio "The Bunker" in Los Angeles, California and produced by himself and Kevin Churko, who had previously worked on Black Rain. The album was commercially successful, reaching number 12 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US Billboard 200 chart.

Originally titled Soul Sucka, the album is the first to feature guitarist Gus G and drummer Tommy Clufetos, who replaced long-term guitarist Zakk Wylde and Mike Bordin respectively. Scream is also the first release to feature keyboardist Adam Wakeman, who has worked with Osbourne as a touring musician since 2004. The lead single released from the album was "Let Me Hear You Scream", which peaked at number six on the American Rock Songs chart.

A 2CD, "Tour Edition" version of the album was released in the U.S on October 5, 2010. This package contains the original album on CD1, and a second CD with seven bonus songs. "One More Time"(originally a pre-order iTunes exclusive), "Jump the Moon"(originally a bonus track on the Japanese release) and "Hand of the Enemy" (previously unreleased) from the Scream sessions, and four additional live tracks recorded during the UK leg of the Scream tour: "Bark at the Moon", "Let me Hear You Scream", "No More Tears" and a cover of Black Sabbath's "Fairies Wear Boots". A four-sided vinyl edition, containing the aforementioned studio tracks along with the live version of "Let Me Hear you Scream" and the single version of "Life Won't Wait", is also available.
