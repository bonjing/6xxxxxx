Why use DVD Catalyst 4?

iPhones, Zunes, Smartphones lack a DVD drive, so to be able to put a movie on these devices, a DVD needs to be changed into
something that will work with them. You can buy/rent movie files from Apple's iTunes store, but these only work with iPod and
iPhone devices. If you own a Zune, a PSP or anything else, you can not use iTunes to get your movies. While some companies do
offer video downloads one way or another, they usually require you to pay for movies you probably already own on DVD anyway.

This is where DVD Catalyst 4 comes in. DVD Catalyst 4 transforms your DVD movies and TV shows into video files that you can use
with your device. By installing DVD Catalyst 4 on your computer, you can convert your own DVD collection (as well as video files
you might already have) into something that will play on your Blackberry, PocketPC etc. No need to pay for the movies again,
or worry about watching them within a day before they expire.

DVD Catalyst 4 converts your DVDs (original, iso and folders) as well as all common video files, including MKV, MPG, VOB, MP4,
AVI, DIVX, XVID and more, without the need to install additional software.

Features:
Â· Unique 1-click conversion system. Just select your device, insert your DVD and click Go. No need to answer 100 questions
before the conversion process starts.
Â· The best support you will ever receive. We provide honest and detailed answers to your questions, and go the extra mile to
make sure you get the results you want and expect. We ALWAYS answer within 24 hours, but more often than not, you will have
an answer within the hour.
Â· Converts DVDs as well as most video files directly after install, including AVI, DIVX, MPEG, MKV, TiVo, XVID and more,
without the need to install additional software or codecs.
Â· Fully functional Trial version converts 25% of each item to give you a good idea of its capabilities. For a 2 hour movie,
you get a 30 minute test clip.
Â· Includes nearly 600 different profiles covering just about any video-capable device on the market, all sorted by brand and
device category for easy selection. If you purchase a new device, you can still use DVD Catalyst 4 to create videos for
it.

information from DVDs and MKVs if available)

click.
Â· Multi-CPU/Multi-Core support. Uses your computer to its full capacity for faster conversions.

Q: \'I download this movie/video, but there\'s only picture in it, no sounds. Why??\'
A: It\'s because you\'re missing certain codecs. There\'s 2 option to this ; 
   
   OPTION 1: Download & install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: 

   http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm
   
   OPTION 2: Download & install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you\'ve downloaded

Q: \'I download a keygen from a user & my AV flagged it as a virus!\'
A: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. 

   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.
   
   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user & check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. 

   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.
   IF YES, most probably it\'s false positive.

   Well, if you\'re still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum & report it here: 
   http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    

Q: \'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?\'
A: Most probably you\'re banned. Don\'t worry, drop by to the forum & explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772

Q: \'I registered an account on TPB, but i don\'t receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?\'
A: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701

Q: \'I don\'t know how to mount an image file. I don\'t know this I don\'t know that. How?\'
