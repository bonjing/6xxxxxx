This is a fantastic Ska band I saw last night in Long Branch, NJ

They are from Ireland and were on an 11-day US tour with Bomb The Music Industry! and will be heading back in 2 days.



4 Albums:

2007 - MysterEP (6 tracks)
2009 - Get RIch or Try Dyin\' (17 Tracks
2010a - Shaving [EP] (5 Tracks)
2010b - BBC Radio 1 Live Sessions (4 Tracks)



Anyway, this band ROCKS, so if you like them I suggest you buy their albums. You can download all but shaving for free from their site, but if you want the actual discs, I don\'t think they are that expensive, I got both (GROTD and Shaving) for $5 last night.



Enjoy and PLEASE SEED!
