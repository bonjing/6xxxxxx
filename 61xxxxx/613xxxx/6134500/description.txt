At the age of 17, Orange Sheila, started out in the Las Vegas open mic circuit. Before turning 18 she released her well received debut EP in 2003. Sheila has played with folks like Mirah, Ghostmice, and was a performer and Lead Organizer for Ladyfest Las Vegas 2006. Orange Sheila also has co-hosted Acoustic Open Mic night at the now defunct Cafe Espresso Roma.

Teenage singer-songwriter Orange Sheila delivers a promising debut with this seven-song EP, a quiet collection of folk-like, introspective tunes. Mostly just the classic girl-and-her-guitar formula (augmented by occasional percussion), Sheila\\\'s music is simple but effective, dealing with typical themes of love and loss. Songs like \\\"Every Night\\\" and especially the strong closer \\\"The Listener\\\" show that with fuller arrangements, Sheila could easily be a pop success along the lines of Michelle Branch. Of course, she could just as well stick to the sparse folk production and build up a following on the local acoustic circuit with her strong, evocative voice. Either way, she\\\'s got a bright future. - Josh Bell (2003)
