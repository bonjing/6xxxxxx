I was following the series through Ed Koala's torrents when something apparently happened to Ed and he never continued past Collection # 11.  When Ed stopped, I tried to collect the rest of the episodes elsewhere but it became too frustrating so I just gave up.

If you would just pick up from where Ed left off, that is all that is really needed, IMO.  But if you really believe your rips will offer superior quality over Ed's, then sure, go ahead and post torrents for the whole series.  Just know that there are many of us out here who will be waiting patiently for you to get to where Ed left off!

But however you care to do it, your efforts will be appreciated by many DS fans.  Thank you!"
