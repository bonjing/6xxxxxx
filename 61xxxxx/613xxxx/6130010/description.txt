        The first album for this UHM resident & main producer is a fact!
        This Dutch artist has made a huge progress in the past couple of 
        Years to rapidly become one of the most popular artists in the 
        hardcore scene today. His interest for music started at early age, 
        in his teenage years he started to develop a huge interest in 
        hardcore music and visited his first rave at the age of 14.

        From that moment on he had the feeling that DJ-ing and producing 
        was the thing he was destined to do. From the moment he had the 
        opportunity to show everyone what TRIAX stood for, he left his 
        mark on the hardcore scene. Each of his productions such as 
        'Assasins' & 'Chronic Beats' became instant classics! And let's 
        not forget his collaborations with artists such as D-Ceptor,
        Newstyler & Mr. Sinister! 

        Besides releases on UHM Triax has also released numerous well 
        received productions on labels such as Meta4, Rage Records, 
        Wishcraft Records & Megarave Records. Because of the high quality 
        of his productions, collaborations and remixes they appeared on
        numerous compilations worldwide!

        Behind the wheels of steel, as a DJ, Triax shows us his passion 
        he has for hardcore. In his studio and ultimately on his vinyls 
        you hear the passion has for hardcore. His bookings have 
        skyrocketed the past couple of years with national as well as
        international (France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Swiss, Spain 
        & Germany) gigs. Raving Nightmare, Nightmare Outdoor, Q-Base, 
        Nature One & Megarave are just a few of the parties where Triax 
        has showed the crowd his skills.

        Therefore it's no more than a logical choice that the front man 
        of the UHM label delivers us his first solo album, a new 
        milestone in his career! An album with all his topnotch 
        productions from the past combined with lots of new material 
        and remixes by colleagues. This album is a must have for all 
        the hardcore heads worldwide and an excellent addition to the 
        already stunning Rotterdam Records catalogue!
