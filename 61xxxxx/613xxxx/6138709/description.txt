I just adore Bach's Goldberg Variations. One of my most cherished childhood memories was playing them on my school's harpsichord when I was younger.

Of course, it has been played and arranged for many other instruments and ensembles. Here we have a collection of over 80 different recordings. 

I have suggested the quality is 'other' because the recordings are sometimes in lossless and at other times in a variety of lossy formats.

Please pick and choose and also seed for a while.

Enjoy!!
