Description : The first of two prototypes "Laysenderov" flew on 15 June 1936.
During the tests followed an order for 144 machines. Aircraft in direct support of ground troops Westland Laysander,
was easily recognizable due to high wing and one wing is very short,
affixed to the main landing gear and intended for the suspension arms and cargo.
The plan, each polukrylo, had quite an unusual diamond shape.
Front edge to center, gave a negative sweep.
This worsens the aerodynamics, but gave a good overview of the pilot, whose head was right in front of the wing.
