Set during world war two, Hut 33 follows the adventures of a team of codebreakers at Bletchley Park. The three code-breakers are forced to share a draughty wooden hut as they try to break German ciphers. Unfortunately, as they come from different backgrounds, they don't get along.

Archie is a stroppy Geordie who wants a socialist revolution, Charles meanwhile is an ultra-conservative snob from a posh background. Also in the hut is child prodigy Gordon and, sometimes, the very silent Winstanley (we only know the latter exists as the other characters occasionally remark about his odd behaviour).

In theory, 3rd Lieutenant Fanshawe-Marshall is in charge of the hut, but he is so dim he struggles to exercise any authority.

There's also Mrs Best, their lascivious landlady who is on the prowl for a man (or men!) and the hut's Polish secretary Minka, the one competent member of the team - although her answer to everything unfortunately involves violence.



www.comedy.org.uk Review: 
Hut 33 is a top rate sitcom. Writer James Cary has created some very fun characters, and the fact these are played by six experienced and well-known comedy stars is the icing on the cake.

The writer has sensibly avoided getting bogged down in the geeky codebreaking side of things. Instead he mines for comedy in the banter between Charles and Archie; the staggering naivety of both Gordon and their Lieutenant and the rather blunt and forwardness of the two females. It's a rich seam of laughs.
