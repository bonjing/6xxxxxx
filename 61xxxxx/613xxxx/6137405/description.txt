This is my latest dump of gun related magazines. (Magazines, as in periodicals, not as in ammunition feeding devices.)

These are new, original scans. These have never been posted anywhere before.

I will be slow seeding this and my half-dozen other torrents for a few days, so please be patient. (Also, seed when you get 100%). I will come on and drop off every so often, but I promise to get dozens of seeders before killing my seed permanently.

Also, please check my other torrents. I posted almost 11GB of gun magazines yesterday (1-28-2011.) I should post another 10GB in a week, then 10GB more a week after that, and so on. I have about 10GB of magazines, plus my lifetime collection of reloading manuals, books on tactics, and books on gunsmithing before I even get to the NRA Firearms Classics Collection. I should do about a dump a week for another month.
