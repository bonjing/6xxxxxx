Please be patient.

I'll have more mags to u/l when this is distributed."
,terrenmcc,2011-02-08T18:24Z,Almost 9 Gig is way too much for most folks to swallow.  Divide this up into bite size pieces and I'll bet you'll be the Pirate of the Day!  Seriously!  
,RecycledElectrons,2011-02-09T03:30Z,"Sorry about that. I uploaded a second 10GB torrent before the first one got seeded to everyone. I've got another 25.5GB of torrents, but I'll seed them 6GBm at a time.

I wish I could get good OCR software that woudl really make these into text PDFs, but the fancy pics make that difficult, and I don't have time to proof read them all.

Ohh well...You'll be getting a few decades woth of books collected by a gunsmith over the coming weeks.
