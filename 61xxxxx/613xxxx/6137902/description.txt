[code]SUMMARY

Amon is a boy with mysterious powers: he can control the wind. His father is the chief scientist for the Empire of the Golden Snake. He's invented weapons for his country in the past, but does not want his boy's powers to be used for destruction. Unfortunately Branich, the ruler of the Empire, wants Amon's power to complete the ultimate weapon and sends his troops to capture the boy. Amon and his family try to escape, but his father and mother die in the attempt. Amon, using his talent, manages to escape and ends up on an island where he learns about the ancient people who could fly on the wind and talk to animals (as he can). He settles in a fishermen's village and makes friends with Maria. After this village is attacked by the Golden Snake army, the two run away with a band of rebels. Together, they try to stop the Empire of the Golden Snake from destroying and conquering everything.

Based on the book by Welsh-born author C.W. Nicol (who now lives in Japan).[/code]
