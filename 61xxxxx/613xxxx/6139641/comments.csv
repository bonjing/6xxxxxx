It's been recently released and supposed to be a very good book. Thanks once again and take care :)"

,siphon154,2011-02-08T12:09Z,Thank you Oceanhawk. This deserves to be seeded to 2:1. I might even just forget its there and let it go.
,klahey2000,2011-02-13T20:34Z,"Thanks for the upload.

I have a request for an e-book: Solutions Manual for ""Geometry: A High School Course: by S. Lang and G. Murrow"" by Philip Carlson.

I can find the actual Geometry book easy enough, but the links for the solutions manual are all dead.  Thanks again."
