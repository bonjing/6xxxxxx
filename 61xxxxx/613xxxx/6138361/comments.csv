,imareare,2011-02-01T11:42Z,"Exercise file is causing some problem.
Though all gets extracted by power iso, but these files do not open in AI or any other application.
Any help. Please."
[V],thethingy,2011-02-01T15:00Z,"imareare, dude the ex files are archives, power iso wont extract them per say but extract them from the iso to whatever you want, you extract the exercise files from within the mounted iso or extracted from the iso with winrar or winzip or 7z..........."
,imareare,2011-02-03T15:29Z,"Thanks Thingy brother for your hint.
And now I got it by Winrar.
Accept my regards

,minister1993,2011-03-15T22:56Z,"Hey Thingy, your awesome you have no idea how much you've helped me out

I have a problem though, I'm not sure how to use the exercise files. I have iso, winzip and i've tried extracted, but I'm a computer idiot so I still haven't managed to it right."
,minister1993,2011-03-15T23:31Z,"Hey thingy, I have problems using the exercise files

I have pressed extract, but when I do all I get is a ""program"" with a white paper icon at the destination that i choose."
,Starrviajero,2011-03-26T02:24Z,"Thank you so much brother! You have made this Semester of school possiable and easy for me.

,nedand,2011-04-01T09:06Z,Thank you very much!
,shed08,2011-04-01T15:49Z,Thank you so much :) All the files are working except the ex files. I read your comment here but I don't know what is power ISO and how to extract them? Can you please tell me how to use them? Winzip nor winrar is extracting them either.
,shed08,2011-04-01T15:56Z,"Oh! I figured it out! If you use winRAR you gotta go to options, and in one of the tabs you can check the ISO box, and then extract. It will work! :D thank u thank u thank u! god bless :)"

,venerdi1982,2011-07-24T13:03Z,Thanks in advance Boss! :)
,venerdi1982,2011-07-24T13:30Z,"Guys, to read the exercise files, you have to add an extension after the title of that file. Add this completely so in this case it would be like this : Ex files.zip

Add this:
.zip"
