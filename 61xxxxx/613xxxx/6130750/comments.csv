,ShipWreckMMG,2011-05-01T15:25Z,"THIS IS SHIT QUALITY!! do not waste your time downloading it. FAAAR from BD quality, if this was even released on bluray. This upload is possibly the worst ive ever seen."
,r1pp3r92,2011-05-18T15:48Z,Great video quality and audio quality But WTF man with the hard coded subs? Is it just me or cant you turn them off?
,r1pp3r92,2011-05-18T15:57Z,Actually scratch that last comment. As long as you use VLC media player not windows media player Subs can be taken off

I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It is definitely one of my favorites ever. This 720p MKV of it does it justice. I am amazed at how this movie file is only 597MB, yet it resembles a 5GB BluRay to a big extent. At a tenth of the size, the quality is remarkably similar and I wouldn't mind having this rip of the movie in my collection to watch again and again.

The download speed was also relatively quick. I finished downloading the movie in under 30 minutes. That is partly due to the fact that I have a fast connection, but nevertheless, faster than some of the torrents that are here on TPB.

I've downloaded many YIFY movies in the past and I must say that they've done an amazing job encoding BluRay movies into such a small size without compromising it's quality.

A must-download from TPB. Great work, YIFY. Keep it up."
