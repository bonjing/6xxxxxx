,Gazooo,2011-02-11T23:59Z,"By the way ; thanks again for this great upload Peppy, video and audio are in super quality.
And people ; please seed and give back a little of what you take and we might convince Peppy to UL the 3th and final season.............."
,Daniccus,2011-02-17T08:24Z,"thanks so much, im definitely in support of you uploading the final season, it would be cruel and unusual punishment to leave us hanging without that last season as you clearly are the only person on earth with these, thus making you our hero"
,PikachuCLS,2011-03-03T13:36Z,peppy please rip subtitles .srt from the dvd please. i have already seeded and ready to burn i just need the subtitles please.
,FancifulDublet,2011-03-12T13:39Z,"Peppy you are a god among men. I salute you, and I will seed. Let's get this third season up!"
,Laterose_of_Noonvale,2011-05-15T11:22Z,"@PikachuCLS â There are no subtitles, afaik. At least there are none on the 3rd season's DVD.

Since peppy hasn't uploaded season 3 yet, I consider to do it, but I have very few experience with uploading torrents, and unfortunately I don't have an efficient way to seed right now. It'll have to wait, but definitely look forward to it, the third season is, imho, the very best one."
,Daniccus,2011-05-17T21:37Z,"if you can find a way to do it please do it, it sucks that peppy never put the 3rd one up and its the last one, its like getting an old show that isnt on tv or dvd and you have all the episodes but the last 1 of the series doesnt exist on the internet...case in point...painful, lol, try your hardest"
,Laterose_of_Noonvale,2011-05-27T12:11Z,You wish has been granted. :)
