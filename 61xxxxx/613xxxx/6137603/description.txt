Here be series three and four of the classic British comedy, Butterflies.

All episodes are 640 x 480 and contain the original 2ch AC3 audio (except for the Children In Need Special which I downloaded myself at some stage).

As with the first torrent (series one and two) the file sizes vary as each episode was encoded to a target quality, not a target file size and all should be playable using any standalone player.

And my upload speed hasn't improved, so please be patient.....
