These tapes were digitised using a cassette player and gnome-sound-recorder, running under GNU/Linux.



I've denoised and remastered them using audacity, then downsampled to 16kHz using sox and encoded into speex.



Quality isn't great, but it's acceptable. Exception is on side 4B, which seems to have degraded so much that the first ten minutes is practicaly useless, and the rest sounds very bad.



Strangely, the cassettes seem to run in this order: 3, 2, 1, 4. NOT 1, 2, 3, 4. Nope, I don't understand why either.



If you're using windows, you can use VLC (http://www.videolan.org/) to play these files. On most GNU/Linux distros, they should play automatically. No idea about mac.
