Storyline
Everybody's favorite talking Chihuahuas are back in Disney's 
Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2, the comedy that's a pack of outrageous fun for the 
whole family.

Puppy mayhem turns the lives of newlywed Chihuahua parents Papi and 
Chloe upside down when their rambunctious, mischievous puppies present one
challenge after another. But when their human owners end up in 
trouble, the tiny pups will stop at nothing to save them, because in good times 
and hard times, the family always sticks together. So Papi, Chloe and the 
puppies embark on a heroic adventure, proving once again that big heroes 
come in small packages.

Featuring an all-star cast, including George Lopez (voice of Papi), 
this heartwarming tale of the meaning of family, friendship and loyalty 
is a special breed of fun times five.
