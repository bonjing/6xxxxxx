@ Rhainor: Please have patience. I'm seeding as fast as I can! (100 kB/s) :S"

,bware454,2011-04-12T12:53Z,"Thanks for the up! It looks great, but I can't get sound from any player. All my other .mkv's work fine. Any suggestions?"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-04-20T14:53Z,"Try playing them with VLC media player, Media Player Classic Home Cinema or with PowerDVD 10.
They all play the audio without a problem."
