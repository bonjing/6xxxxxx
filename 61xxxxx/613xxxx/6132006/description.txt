YEVLUMEEL - 2 Years EP ADVANCE (AUGUST 2011) AC.SCeNe-Xd
--------------------------
==========================

The first release from YEVLUMEEL. At only 3 tracks, the album is already receiving acclaim from critics. The band currently consisting of two brothers opens up new doors in the music industry. 

since the very beginning of time, music has echoed one way or another through the hallowed stretches of the universe. while not always conventional, or what we\'re used to as modern men, music has a everlasting presence in history. through thick and thin music continues to provide the building blocks to psychological development. imagine the potential to tap into the very noise that one may use to create his inner being, the inner sanctum of what makes him who he is.

Imagine for a moment the inside of a human being, backdrop is not red but a range of mountains consisting entirely of white, glorious snow. Inside this land, the sound of a pin dropping echoes for an entirety, decaying into a completely different sound overtime, bounding over the endless hills of the psyche. Foreground of guitars and love, the sound of echoing notes and light and love. A true connection with the inner meaning of being a human and relating to yourself. It finally means something.

The music has been said to sound like a \"Victorian house filled with beautiful paintings of cats.\" YEVLUMEEL has been compared to MGMT, Vampire Weekend, Silverchair, and Phoenix, as well as tons of singer/songwriter acts.
