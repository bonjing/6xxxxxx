Director: J.F. Lawton

Genres:
Action | Drama | Thriller

Plot:
Paul is on one of his many business trips to Tokyo, as a computer-chip executive from New York,
when he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman. Later, he finds himself in the wrong place at
the wrong time, inadvertently interrupting an assassination by a feared Ninja-cult.
As he is now the only man to have seen the face of the cult's warrior-leader and lived,
he soon realizes that he is facing a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy. Teaming up with
a friendly samurai couple, on a two-centuries-old blood-feud with the Ninja, he struggles
to survive. Finally, recuperating on an island-fortress, he learns swordsmanship, and perhaps,
a little about courage, honor, love, and loyalty. The requisite final confrontation is rife
with bloody swordplay and spectacular martial-arts action sequences.
