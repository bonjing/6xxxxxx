,Dragonite_9,2011-04-04T12:53Z,"@spiritualiste - EXACTLY! Just what I have been trying to tell people last few days (Thank you for that I'm not the only one trying!) with my post:

Can I have your attention for just a minute please! Please read this for all ours sake! 

SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

MVH.

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such douches, especially to those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big difference .. so not any more great groups like seacret_myth and 3Li will leave!!

Best regards!

,hotrod666,2011-06-12T06:14Z,this is not the unrated version.  94 min (unrated version). this is the regular one. waste of time.
,hotrod666,2011-06-12T06:18Z,this is not the unrated version.  beware. 94 min (unrated version)

,naughtydied,2011-10-06T00:27Z,"is it just me, or is the movie just one black screen? I can't see the movie :("
,abs55rocks,2011-10-22T08:43Z,i m worried... is this good?
,lovespiratebay,2012-02-16T13:55Z,This is a great copy a/10 v/10 and downloaded megafast too. Although its not the unrated version and it causes my Itunes to crash everytime I try to make a new playlist. Can anyone tell me how I can fix this or should I just find another torrent??
,lovespiratebay,2012-02-17T00:44Z,@naughtydied your probably not using the proper media player... Try using VLC it works for every format...
,Kars1090,2012-04-23T18:51Z,Good quality and download speed. Too bad those two black bars are in the screen.
