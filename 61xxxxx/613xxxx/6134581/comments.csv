In this torrent and in the DVDs, Episode 1, for whatever reason, is actually supposed to go after Episode 5. You can watch in the order given if you want, but you should be aware that Episode 2 is actually the beginning. I'd say that Episodes 1 and 2 are not the best; the show gets better."
,zhnxjtab8,2012-04-06T14:18Z,"Not very important, but I will mention that this version uses slightly ""buggy"" subtitles that have a few typographical issues--nothing major. However I wanted to point out that the DVD set I am familiar with has perfect subtitles. One other minor complaint is that each episode starts with the full introduction (where the several dragons are shown toward the end in still-shot), which I don't like, whereas in my DVD set each episode starts with a quite brief clip, of the opening mythology narration (God of creation vs. God of destruction). But don't get me wrong: these minor deviations from what I consider the ideal version are negligible due to the overall fidelity to the ideal. "
