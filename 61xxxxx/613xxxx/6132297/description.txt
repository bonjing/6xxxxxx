This is interesting for two reasons. 1) This 15 part serial contains the very first episodes of the very first made-for-tv cartoon show, and 2) It's the debut of Alex Anderson and Jay Ward, the creators of Rocky and Bullwinkle.

The animation here is very crude and primitive (even Alex Anderson admitted this in an interview years later). The first episodes have very little movement at all, and it gets only slightly better as the series progresses. What saves the day is that these stories are very imaginative and full of whimsy and charm. Once you have the patience to sit through the crude artwork, it kind of grows on you and draws you in.
