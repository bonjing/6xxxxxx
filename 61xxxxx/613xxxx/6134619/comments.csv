,datapingi,2011-01-29T11:35Z,hello. Thanks for your great work. Just a question though...maybe a little stuoid but here it goes: Is there a way to get the subs to show if I burn the movie to a DVD and play it on my DVD player?
,shaggym,2011-01-29T23:02Z,i love your torrents is it possible to get tangled or transformers thanks
,Bundi001,2011-02-03T01:28Z,"HD-R-US:
Your torrents absolutely amazing! Excellent quality in relatively small sizes! I am able to play them on WMP and burn them directly to DVD5 via PowerISO to watch on a Blu-Ray player! Very nicely done buddy!

I would like to request some torrents for the future if/when time permits:
1.) Spartacus: Blood & Sand (Season 1)
2.) Spartacus: Gods of the Arena
3.) Blood Diamond
4.) The Departed
5.) Shrek: The Whole Story

I know that's a lot but if time permits, please upload them.

Also, do you do torrents for Bollywood movies? I would love to download some of those as well.

Thanks!"

,DarthMama,2011-02-22T08:04Z,"Nice upload, though it does not feel like an full 1080p, the codec is a bit crappy, if you want the best resolution take another torrent. If your ok with ~ "
,lemonjk,2011-03-16T01:26Z,"First off, thanks for the great torrents!

So I download and can play the files fine on my computer. The problem is that when I burn the image to a DVD+R disc, it won't play back on my Samsung Blu-Ray player. I'm able to open the disc on my computer using Media Player Classic, but the Blu-ray player won't recognize it for some reason. I write it using Imgburn following the directions step by step. "
