,Chadly,2011-01-28T18:15Z,I dont know what happend but the sound is very low and the picture sketches out from time to time. Media player talking about not able to read a MKV file and my VLC player just freezes and wont let me do anything.
,Chadly,2011-01-28T18:31Z,my bad everyone lol its still downloading lol. Had abunch of stuff finish and I thought Casino Jack was one of them. Strange it let me play it when it wasnt even done. I didnt think a file would play at all if not completed. will give A/V once fully completed :) ignore previous comment :)
