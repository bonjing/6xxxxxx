INFO: The transfer was done from a virgin copy of the box set played on a Thorens TD145 turntable with no noise reduction during the processing to compact disc.  These releases capture the dynamics and warmth of the original vinyl release with no hints of equalization, remastering, or hiss making these arguably the greatest available versions of the Beatles catalogue in existence.  Dr. Ebbett's ""blue box"" series was initially released in 2006.  Released last month is the new ""DBM"" series of Dr. Ebbett transfers which differ from the other set on two points.  All previous titles released on this label have been on silver cd-r, but this series is on legitimate silver pressed compact disc making it attractive to those who collect solely in that format.  The artwork also differs with the older releases replicating the original vinyl covers"
,slimbasic,2011-02-14T04:59Z,"In the info file there is no reference to ""The Beatles Collection"". So, I don't know if the ""Blue Box"" is the same that ""The Beatles Collection"", however the albums list are the same, and another case in both of them: they not include the 'Magical Mystery Tour' album. But, the info file says that's a Dr. Ebbett's series (Dr. Ebbett's ""blue box"" series was initially released in 2006). And that's why I named the torrent as ""Blue Box"" and not as ""The Beatles Collection""."
