Fiona has entered the Finest Flower Garden beauty contest and needs your help to win! You'll plant seeds and bulbs in visually stunning gardens, crossbreed blossoms to create new species and then sell what you produce. Next, you'll purchase beehives, grapevines and berry bushes, and process your harvest using fruit dryers, jam boilers and perfume makers. Plenty of other tools and helpful upgrades will be available as well. Once you win the contest, the fun will continue in Free Gardening mode!
