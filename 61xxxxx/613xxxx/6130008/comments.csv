Before you go slagging off others' hard work, maybe you should think a little.
This tool patches software, a similar thing to what malware does, so it's bound to be flagged by a few AVs.
Secondly, looking at that VT report, this file is flagged by all of the shit AVs. The only decent one that thinks this is malicious is NOD32, and with a name ""HackAV"" I wonder why...
Avast, MSE, Kaspersky, SAS all think it's clean. That's good enough for me."
