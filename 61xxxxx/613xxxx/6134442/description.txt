      David Mitchell, Jimmy Carr, Charlie Brooker and Lauren
      Laverne host the second show of this live comedy and current
      affairs programme. Guests include Tony Blair's former
      communications chief Alastair Campbell; economist, journalist
      and author of The Undercover Economist, Tim Harford and The
      Guardian's legal affairs correspondent, Afua Hirsch. A lively
      mix of intelligent, informative and - more importantly - funny
      takes on the world of current affairs with a peppering of
      debates, interviews, topical comedy, investigations and opinion
      pieces. The team are joined by the finest and sharpest minds
      from comedy, politics, science and culture, with the show airing
      live in front of a studio audience.
