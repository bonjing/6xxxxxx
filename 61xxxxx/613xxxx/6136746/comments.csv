,ltorrentstorm,2011-01-30T00:39Z,"20-40. thank you for upping again in small sizes.  I have to stay away from anything over 500 MB because it affects my broadband limits.  But these ones today are just fine, so many many thanks again! :) :) :)"
,justregged,2011-01-30T02:29Z,"Thanks for about half this pack, nice collection.

@zuriki

,imjustwow,2011-01-30T05:16Z,"@twentyforty

I don't remember why u upload movies in pack....but I just realized most of your movie pack lacks seeders....this probably coz one who does not know you can't locate the specific torrent if you bundle them like this....u shud kw that already....

but hey......thanks for you work :)"

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-30T07:34Z,"@imjustwow: Simple - otherwise, this 11 movies needs 11 torrents and 22 days of up-time.

Almost a month - requesters cannot wait so long.

And number of seeders is - constantly ridiculously small.

And for worse - number of movies or TV shows doesn't effect anything - music albums do have songs inside. Do you like them all?"

as small-sized H264. Halloween has been done last week as 720p and re-rip is out of the question. Rest I have not on disposal.

Problem is, however, lack of free upload slots - I cannot promise a thing, but I'll up them in Movie.Pack as soon as possible, probably next week, maybe."
,bcgarant,2011-01-30T14:26Z,"thx 20-40 even sooner than expected, not only that but u had a couple more i been wanting to see"
,believenu,2011-01-30T16:02Z,"Thank you. seeding is sharing..Although I know most prople do not realise it you do this not for any reason( eg. profit, monetary gain) but to have a footprint in the world. to help others as it were. it still frustrates me that so many can and think that it is ok to disparage your efforts.. how many of them are doing the same . If I had the ability ( I am trying to learn how) to upload and share torrents, I would do so until then due to my ability I seed as much as I can .. For those who do not or care less go somewhere else..The world is a small place and thanks to the wonderful people like twenty forty we are friends and we band together
 to imjustwow ...those who are greedy and don't want to share usually look for just the names of movies.. those who care and are interested in quality.. find  uploaders like 20/40 and follow his/her work and are a comunity and try as abled to seed as much as possible.. in my case days or weeks if I can .. for others 1:1 or 1:2 ratio.. I hope
to twenty forty...you are an artist of the finest degree.. you share as and how you can,, thank you from all your friends present and not(at times like these i miss lilars comments to unwary visitors(lol)  "
,srisuk,2011-01-31T01:00Z,Great little collection. Thanks.
,formerly_azrielle,2011-01-31T03:20Z,"Thank you for these.  TPB mucked up my password, so I had to re-register.   GRRRR.  

Do you condense musical performances, such as Eluveitei's 2008 Summer Breeze concert, or Within Temptation's Black Symphony concert?  Just curious."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-31T07:33Z,"@azrielle: I have seen MTV clips of Within Temptation only, probably few years back. Good female singer. Not my pair of shoes, tough. I am more like old rhythm&blues type."
,abj642,2011-01-31T10:22Z,thanks 20-40 for all your efforts
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-31T11:11Z,"@believenu: Footprint... it is.
I have no clue how, from where people get such terrible and wrong ideas (about earning the money on public site, as an uploader). Maybe from e-mails from Nigerian financial experts. But what pisses me off is constant bitching about my ""shit"" I put up as there is no alternative and I charge for all that - and... perpetual blindness of inhabitants of this rock who called themselves humans.

I'll be soon checking myself out and I thank the universe for that."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-01T13:46Z,Seeded 3 days and 150 GB. Have what you have. Learn to share. Seed what you got.
,bcgarant,2011-02-10T00:41Z,"my God, I was seeding this the entire time after I dl'ed this & now i gotta dl again because my BitTorrent got wiped out clean of everything & IDK how i just woke up & it was empty & i had like 10 or more gig space left, i only got to watch 1 of them so looks like i am dl'ing again with what few sources it has left if it lets me"
