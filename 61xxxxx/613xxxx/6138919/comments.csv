This is good because lot of mods are so hard to find on the internet because they only exist for download through ""Planet Elder Scrolls"" or w/e its called, which you need a payed subscription to download from."
,EmbMe,2011-01-30T21:27Z,www.tesnexus.com    great site for morrowing and/or oblivion mods.
,Skiles,2011-01-31T18:04Z,the planet elder scrolls doesn't require a payed account. The login screen does make it appear that way
,mirglof,2011-03-07T20:53Z,"planet elderscrolls doesn't ask for paid subscription, but file planet does. and if you want to down load anything from file planet you have to have an account with them and its something out ragous like 7 $."
,Dragncore,2011-03-12T07:24Z,"..Please don't spread mis-information! It's true FilePlanet does require an account (http://www.fileplanet.com/tutorial/), but there are free accounts and there are also paid accounts. The free account allows you to download anything from the free public servers which most of the time are as quick as the paid account servers and no waiting in line for other before you. The paid subscriber accounts are allowed to use the public or paid download servers at slightly faster download speeds, no browser ads and no waiting for downloads. If anyone actually signed up for one you may have found this out on your own.

..I had a paid account about 10 years ago for a few weeks before switching to a free account shortly after with not to many issues the last 10 years. FilePlanet is not always the fastest, but its FREE so who cares.

..I do prefer tesnexus.com for my M&O mods and files although they are EXACTLY like fileplanet requiring an account to download files and offering paid accounts to download files without ads, uncapped downloads and private servers for paid members. (http://www.tesnexus.com/premium.php)"
,Skiles,2011-03-14T21:03Z,"Dragncore, don't spread mis-information. FilePlanet doesn't require an account whatsoever. They would just like it you more if you do. ha"
,ust2,2011-03-16T13:07Z," Hah the mod files are larger than the game itself, hopefully it has the ones i'm looking for (hard to tell since they are all renamed).

 ..and I call BS on people saying planetelderscrolls lets you download their morrowind mods for free.

 Once clicking on a file, i'm stuck at an ad for their premium accounts ""IGN PRIME - blahblah"", it's an absolute dead end from there.

 ..and esnexus doesn't even have most of the important mods, like Vibrant Morrowind 4.0.


 Pretty lame when downloading the actual game is easier than getting the mods for it."
,ust2,2011-03-17T11:03Z," I guess all I wanted from this was Morrowind Graphics Extender :P 

 If anyone else is just looking for graphics mods, then it is probably just MGE you are looking for out of this.

 Open that program and goto 'Tools'>'Shader editor'>'Edit active. Then just double click the shaders you want, save, close, then play the game.

 Not much else was noticeble apart from a few models and textures, but even then you'd have to compare them to really even see any difference.

Note: to use most of the mods in this pack you need to open and run the game through Morrowind - Enhanced."
,werthers,2011-04-23T19:22Z,"Fileplanet is a pile of crap you can't download any Morrowind mods on it as it just says ""Unable to add to line. This server is currently full or not accepting new connections at this time.""
It does this with every mod I have tried "
,Philonetic,2011-06-08T08:01Z,"Has some great hard to find mods, thanks."
