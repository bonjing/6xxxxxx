[V],neon,2011-01-29T00:49Z,yep ....same one thats in the info already :)
,User897,2011-01-29T08:01Z,I sure hope the volume level on this isn't like the Noir release.  I'll take it for a spin....  
,romeo49000,2011-01-29T15:13Z,"any chance to upload twilight new moon, the color purple or once upon a time in america ? cheers."
,User897,2011-01-30T06:34Z,"I hate to report that the volume is TOO FUCKING LOUD ON THIS.  What the hell, guys?"
[V],neon,2011-01-30T11:23Z,@User897.... too loud on noir release...too loud on this release....two words...volume control....i have another 2 words but cant put them on here :)
,User897,2011-01-30T13:02Z,"Sure you can, just do this:

Fuck you.  :)

The level is too high, period.  Adjusting volume on playback does nothing for the distortion still heard in the audio due to it coming into mp4 too hot.

And yes, I know what I'm doing and I thought you would want to know.  That's what the comments section is for.  This is the only movie I have had this trouble with.

Uploading a torrent and then being an asshole to someone that lets you know about an issue is really uncalled for.  Can't take it?  Then quit.  If you really gave a shit, you would open a dialog and look into it.  Instead, you prefer the smartass approach and leaving a torrent out there that has problems."
[V],neon,2011-01-30T16:52Z,"Hehe... good comeback user897 :)

this sounds ok to me....if anyone else has problems with the volume please comment :)"

,Basnagus,2011-02-08T07:48Z,"excellent BRRip thnx alot neon

@User897
I do agree the volume seems to be a pube louder than needed.  I have found a way to fix the problem follow these instructions.

1.  Start the movie in your media player of choice

2. TURN DOWN THE VOLUME!!!!

3. shutup and don't ever complain about something so stupid and irrelevant again.

Thank you and goodnight"
