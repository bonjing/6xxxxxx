This has been tested with v02.00 (Europe) bios, and it did not break. Your characters will still move slowly at a few places, but you wont hear that annoying audio stretching sound."

dataking77, you either use a ps2 emulator, such as pcsx2, and play it on your compy, or if you prefer using the physical playstation, you need to burn it to a disk and google how to hack your ps2 to run custom disks."
