,Yellowfield,2011-02-07T19:39Z,"I would like to thank you for your great work uploading these updates.

It would be gold worth if you could upload the latest update with the Love is in the Air guide and the hunter's pet talent fix."
,crelm,2011-02-09T03:42Z,"Thank you Forland91 for uploading this Awesome Torrent for us WoW nerds! This worked great for me.  If anyone has trouble making this work, try right clicking on your World of Warcraft icon...then click on the 'Properties' tab...,next, open file location...then interface, then Addons. If you don't have an Addon file, create one.  This is important or it won't work for you.  Also another helpful Addon manager is Wowmatrix.

Again, many thanks to you forland91!  "
