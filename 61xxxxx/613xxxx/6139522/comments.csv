I know that most are paid review but Nova Backup is one of the Industry leader in backup division. Who dont want a hi techie disk imaging software like Ghost or Acronis, it is for them. Dont confuse it with disk imaging software."

,bluecar5556,2011-04-12T19:19Z,"I've cracked a LOT of programs in my years and this one worked on my dad's laptop but not mine or my friends all running the same XP X86.  Reinstalled windows numerous times to ensure the registry entry was removed that disables recracking this program, followed the instructions exactly.  1) installed the program 2)completely closed out of all programs with task manager, copied all three top-level domain names into C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts directly under 127.0.0.1  localhost without asterisks  3) generated a serial for the professional version, green check mark and serial worked.  4)  Opened N.B., I see the splash screen for a while and then closes...  I've tried performing all procedures without internet connection or restarting, some with restarting, and after every step...  Can someone please help?"
,bluecar5556,2011-04-13T00:44Z,"Just simply installing the installer and clicking trail 15 days, not clicking activate the program still crashes after showing the splash screen for a few seconds. weird... "
,uRabbit,2011-05-08T16:51Z,"Instructions say to, ""...now, add these to your host file...""

Some of us, like myself, are not exactly versed in the language of editing files. So, we (I) have no idea what this means."
,skinnypimp419,2011-06-20T19:22Z,"goto the folder C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts and youll find a file called ""hosts"" no extension click on it and open it with wordpad and there ya go :)

my copy also crashes after splash screen :( im gonna try to reinstall for the 3rd time "

,cojon,2011-09-04T14:14Z,"First, thank you for the upload! Appreciated!

The KeyGen is virus free, so that's good, but the app opens a small screen that requests a backup client.  I have been in computing since bugs were fixed with tweezers and I have never heard of a backup client? 

Whazzz up?  "
