You should specify it's the F2P client, just in case some people are wondering."

,trom2004,2011-03-14T01:13Z,"Like the rest, I came to this torrent after experiencing horrible slowness from the official p2p downloader. After leaving it on for about half a day, i managed to barely get 35% of the full download. This torrent gave me max download speed from start to finish (about 400-500kb a sec). Thank you to the seeders!

Anyone not sure, this is what you need to get online with Champions Online. There will be a patch of about 450mb to download after you install this, but thats to expected with any active game."
