Plot:
English rock star Aldous Snow relapses into drugs and booze after a break up and a disastrous
record. In L.A., Aaron Green works for a record company stuck in recession. Aaron's boss gives
him a career making task - to bring Aldous from London to L.A. for a concert in 72 hours.
That day, Aaron's girlfriend Daphne tells him she wants to finish her medical residency in Seattle.
Aaron's sure this ends their relationship. In London, things aren't much better:
Aldous delays their departure several times, plies Aaron with vices, and alternates between
bad behavior and trenchant observations. Can Aaron moderate Aldous's substance abuse and get
him to the Greek? What about Daphne?

Release notes:
AMIABLE dirfixed their release to UNRATED.

We felt the UNRATED version being a little too much of an overkill, so here's the
THEATRiCAL cut.

See http://movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=713812 for differences between both cuts.

Enjoy!
