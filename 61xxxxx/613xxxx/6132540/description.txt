"Celebrity Pharmacology"

When Annie (Alison Brie) decides to stage 
a production at a local middle school to 
spread an important message about staying 
away from drugs, Pierce (Chevy Chase) 
becomes overwhelmed with the excitement 
of performing and decides he needs a 
bigger role. When his over-the-top 
behavior threatens to ruin the 
production, Senor Chang (Ken Jeong) comes 
to the rescue, earning admiration from 
the group.

Enjoy :)
