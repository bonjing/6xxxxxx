Money, sex, power. They're all part of this crisp, stylish suspense thriller from the director of The French Connection and the screenwriter of Basic Instinct. David Caruso plays Corelli, a D.A. up to his neck in a case that may lead where he doesn't want to go. Chazz Palminteri portrays Matt, a prominent attorney, local power broker and Corelli's longtime pal. Linda Fiorentino is Matt's wife Trina, a clinical psychologist who's bold, uninhibited and capable of anything - maybe even murder.
