,dannowrw,2011-09-02T13:50Z,"Guys
IP BLOCKING"" software only 'blocks' other machines from connecting to you. It 
does NOTHING to obscure your IP address, either internal or external in ANY 
WAY.
IP Blocking software simply has a big list of ""known bad"" IP's. IP's 
used by the **AA, government, spyware companies, etc, It keeps those IP's 
from making a connection to your machine.
Your ISP, on the other hand, could in theory (but doesn't bother to in 
practice) see every packet that leaves your machine. There is NO way around 
that.
If you use a secure proxy you can encrypt packets... FOR HTML WEB 
SURFING ONLY and your ISP will only see that you are requesting data from a 
proxy. However, this does NOTHING to hide your P2P activity. It ONLY works for 
web pages.
There is NO WAY to ""hide"" your IP address. Any program which 
claims to do so is simply lying to you. Period

Fact.............."

,Sinistar8u,2012-04-18T02:35Z,"I'VE BEEN USING THIS IP BLOCKER FOR A WHILE AND IT WORKS GREAT! I USED TO GET WARNING EMAILS FROM MY ISP FOR ILLEGAL DOWNLOADING BUT SINCE I'VE BEEN USING THIS NOT ANYMORE.
@dannowrw- THERE'S ALWAYS A JACKASS WHO THINKS THEY KNOW EVERYTHING AND YOU ARE IT!"
,Sinistar8u,2012-04-18T02:42Z,"AND YES YOUR BROWSER WILL BE EXTRA SLOW BUT YOU ONLY NEED TO USE THIS WHEN DOWNLOADING MOVIE & MUSIC TORRENTS, THEN TURN IT OFF!"
