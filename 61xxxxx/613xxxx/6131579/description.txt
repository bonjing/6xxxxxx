Objects Of Wrath(2004)

The story is built upon the scripture Ephesians 2:1-3. Without Jesus we are â€œdead in our transgressionsâ€ and â€œobjects of (His) wrathâ€. 
Steve (Dan Arthur) has always felt there was more to life than his dead end and boring life. But he doesnâ€™t know how to go about changing it. 
He also feels trapped by an addiction that is only too common in our world today. The sudden loss of his job forces him to revaluate his priorities. 
His new life is difficult and unfamiliar.

This experience drives Steve into a place of prayer and renewed dedication.
 This film is the perfect illustration of the principle found in the popular book, â€œThe Purpose Driven Lifeâ€ by Rick Warren. 
Jeffâ€™s film has a lot of polish, and I hope it will inspire its viewers to make their lives count for Christ. I review hundreds of films each year.
 We have all seen some Christian films that are extremely amateurish. Not this one! I highly recommend this film
