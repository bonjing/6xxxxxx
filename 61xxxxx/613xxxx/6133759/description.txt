         While Internal Affairs officer Rachel Jacobs investigates     
         reports of a rogue cop, Jim risks revealing himself as the    
         prime suspect when the police station is overrun by a group   
         of thugs, and he is the only hope of survival. Meanwhile,     
         while trying to nurse an ailing Joshua back to health at      
         the lab, Katie and Stephanie run into Human Resources VP      
         Victoria Morrow and begin to suspect that she isn't who       
          she says she is.

         Proper notes: LOL's neato preair source somehow managed to    
         have the surround left/right channels running about 2m35s     
         ahead of the rest of the audio and the video, causing music   
         and effects to play at the wrong times. This is obvious       
         at 7:03 when gunshots are heard during a conversation,        
         while the gunshots are actually from the scene at 9:38. The   
         intro music is also heard at 7:35, while the intro actually   
          starts at 10:10. Thanks to the person who pointed this out.
