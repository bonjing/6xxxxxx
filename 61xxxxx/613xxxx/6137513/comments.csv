Why don't you check the foolishness you believe or try reading the Bible for yourself. Oh, wait, how can you understand when you believe your brain has not yet fully evolved? Maybe you can wait another million years and then you can learn what Christians know NOW."
,ruthchiun,2011-01-30T19:03Z,"Interesting comments.  We ALL ""indoctrinate"" our children with our beliefs.  Of course, our children will at some point decide for themselves what they believe it.  I am sorry, but I really don't believe telling our children stories about what we believe is a bad thing.  It is unfortunate that some folks here feel compelled to push their beliefs on others.  And to be clear, that is not what I believe I am doing here.  I am providing FREE stuff, just like everyone else on TPB, if you want it, take it and be gracious.  If you don't want it, move on.  It is as simple as that.   "
,ruthchiun,2011-01-30T19:06Z,"And seriously kimm_23f, the only thing you are bringing to the table (TPB) is porn.  That is the only torrent it seems you have uploaded.  And I am brainwashing children?  Look to your own house before you tear down mine.  I have a variety of torrents, some Christian and some that very clearly are not.  It is interesting that you choose to tear down another seeder.  Like I said before, I think you need to move on and focus on the things you are clearly interested in."
,Samael69,2011-01-30T19:29Z,"I think itâs quite laughable when a religious idiot, like Tamarind777, denies a scientific theory which he obviously doesnât even understand. "
,nevin3525,2011-02-05T21:56Z,"If you don't think this should be on pirate-bay then you really don't believe in what PB stands for.
I question kimm_23f's loyalty to the belief that information should be free. 

No matter what you believe it requires faith 
I support Tamarind777's right to express him/herself and his/her right to share with others"
,innochig,2011-03-01T04:07Z,"God bless you ruthchiun for sharing. We live in times when teaching our children the right way is frowned upon yet we can allow them to be taught by stuff on the internet and television. God will hold us parents responsible if we dont do our duty of directing our children along the right way. Once again, God bless you and you wont lose your reward"
,ruthchiun,2011-03-04T18:16Z,"Thanks, innochig.  As a young child, I listened to these stories at bedtime (and when I was doing chores or cleaning my room, etc).  I really enjoyed them.  My now 15 year old son used to listen them and sometimes I think when he plays them for his 3 year old brother, he does it more for himself than his brother.  :)

It is unfortunate that some people have such a negative reaction to my posting these.  It is so strange.  I figure that Pirate Bay is here for people to share with other like-minded individuals.  We all have varied beliefs and while I would never want to download what I see as trashy, debase things, who am I to say what should or shouldn't be shared.  I do find that religious material is often more strongly attacked than many other things which truly fascinates me.  

We teach our children through stories.  Sometimes the stories are lesson-teaching, sometimes they are simply for entertainment.  I read fantasy stories to my children (Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, etc) and I don't feel like I am indoctrinating them into believing in dragons and ghosts and such.  But back to my original point, as parents, we choose how we want to raise our kids and what to fill their heads with.  As a parent of a teenager, I can say that they do develop their own ideas about life, regardless of what you think you taught them.  That is just the way of things.  

My hope is that people who want these stories, will download and enjoy them.  People who don't, will simply move onto the next torrent.

Enjoy!"
