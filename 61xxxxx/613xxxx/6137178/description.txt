This is the discography of the marvelous alternative band from US, October Project. Lushy melodies, fantastic lyrics and the voice of Mary Fahl, made this band one of the best things from the early 90?s.

Mary Fahl has left the band to pursue a solo career, but the band goes on, first with Sylvia Tosum (they called themselves November Project for some time) and now with Marina Belica as lead vocal.
