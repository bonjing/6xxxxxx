,BerretSO4,2011-05-31T22:15Z,"illizit, I'm not sure why you say that but for sake of qualifying the torrent's functionality:

Extras/The.Venture.Brothers.S04EX.Trailer.avi

is fine.  The file is fine and is exactly what it claims to be.  illizit makes it seem like it's kiddie porn or something, which it is not.  I imagine illizit was just saying that it's not his preference to have the file, but you shouldn't say something like ""just don't download x.file"" without having a real reason to.

Thanks for the torrent."
