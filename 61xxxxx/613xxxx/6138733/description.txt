Philadelphia, PA 1996
Date: 96-10-11
Venue: CoreStates Center

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8(-)
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments: Looks like a 2-cam mix (might be 3): one on the balcony stahe right and one filming the screen. 
(The possible 3rd would be about center stage at the back of the venue.) Picture quality is OK but the colors are all wrong. Audio is good.
