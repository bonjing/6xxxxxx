MediaCoder is a free universal audio/video converter, which nicely integrates most popular audio/video codecs and tools into an all-in-one solution. On video side, MEncoder is used as back-end, which provides support for nearly all known video compression and container formats as well as rich and useful video filtering features (e.g. post-processing, 3D de-noise). On audio side, MPlayer and Winamp input plugins used as decoders, various encoders integrated, MediaCoder can simply batch transcode among any known audio formats, with tags transferred, file names generated, and even performing audio filtering (e.g. resample, normalize) on the fly.
