Using the updated crack, I installed and moved the shortcut to the folder and used it to stop it up. The game would attempt to log on, but the screen would be black.

I looked it up, and some advice is to change the settings.txt file. But, mine did not generate. So if anyone has the settings.txt file, I sort of need it. Not sure if it will fix it, but right now, I am out of ideas."

For all of you that get the Play option instead of the Install option when you mount the disc:  Mount Disc1 (I use Daemon Tools Lite), open disc1 in Winrar, run EAInstaller (or whatever it's called), unmount disc1 when it asks for disc2, mount disc2, wait till it finishes, don't install EA updater or whatever and click finish.

But yeah, as I had noticed. The fixes people see are the ones with the Settings.txt being changed, and the joystick or gaming pad used (so disconnect em). But, since I can't seem to find the full settings.txt for deadspace 2, I cant even test this."

I've done this same thing before for so many different games on so many different systems exactly the same way for years and years.

Put all files in the SAME folder. If it asks to overwrite a movie file, do it.

Then copy deadspace2.exe from the Fairlight folder into the folder with all the extracted files, which will overwrite the current deadspace2.exe file.

,CounterPillow,2011-02-01T17:34Z,"For all those who are experiencing slow download speeds: Just wait a little bit. I had around 5kb/s for 10 Minutes, then it just started climbing, now at around 200kb/s.
If you don't want to wait, just buy the fucking game already."

,redex501,2011-02-01T18:46Z,"@xionilrem

I wasn't speaking for you, as you are another ""whiner"" whining about someone else needing to upload a file to help you. You said yourself that you ""have been downloading and playing games for quite some time"", so you should be able to find a fix yourself, hotshot. 

And to this statement: ""Thing about technology is that, it has a tendency to not go as planned. Sometimes it works, sometimes it has errors.""
Technology is absolute and it ""goes as planned"" every time based on what you do with it. Your petty struggle just shows where you fail to alter the technology to yield a favorable outcome. The game is ""not working"" exactly as it should be with your setup. ;]"
,redex501,2011-02-01T18:51Z,"Also, I've been seeding this at 2.2 mb/s for the past few hours and will continue to do so throughout the next two weeks.

,arbo96,2011-02-02T00:43Z,fairly new to downloading torrents and this might sound stupid but where is the crack?? didn't find it in the fairlight folder...
,wifioutlaw,2011-02-02T01:18Z,"arbo96,the crack is in the fairlight folder,when you open it their should be 2 files the dead space2 application,and the other is the fairlight system info,if its not try re-downloading the crack,after that copy and paste these files into your program files (86)or for 32 bit it would be program files(32),open it and paste the crack in the folder marked EA games dead space2 note do this after you have installed the game.... "
,thedeficater,2011-02-02T02:25Z,"Works 100% without a flaw, didn't even have to go hunting on one of the CDs to get the crack and anyone who's done ISO mounted games would think this is cake.

And uhh to the guy who stated about x86.. that's 32-bit architecture and has been for years lol the x64/64-bit architecture folder would just simply be C:\Program Files.. etc. but I don't think this game supports 64 bit honestly so just line it up with it's default folder under C:\Program Files (x86), and from there just copy/paste the crack over using Admin privileges in the install folder, (default C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games\Dead Space 2) "
,danxl5,2011-02-02T02:55Z,"I'm downloading ar around 30kb/s on average.
I'm also not limiting my upload, so I'm uploading at around 25 on average.

I shall continue to seed, (if it ever downloads) for as long as I can.

Thanks for this, I'm sure it will work eventually."

Yeah, sounds like you failed to use the crack. You're supposed to replace the original deadspace2.exe with the one inside the fairlight folder. Unfortunately, sometimes if you attempt to run a game or any other cracked software before it's cracked, it won't work even if you do crack it. Try it anyway though."

Stop saying for fuck sakes that everyone has to stop talking about a glitch in chapter 11 while you say there isn't one 
There is and not many aren't experiencing it just like you caus you'r computer is to slow to have problems at that point. The people who have problems with it have computers on which the framerate/gamingspeed is to fast so you has to smash the E button or any other button at such a rate it isn't physically possible. That's why some people has problems with that point and to solve it you have to slow down the frame rate"

Which we'll take 17 tries to get our strategy down, these games don't thrill or scare, but rather force the gamer into an obsessive rage projected at the game and at the dynamics which the game holds, DS2 has a difficulty that isn't in the setting but rather in the users own mind, in other word to play this you have to forget all those normal FPS like halo and COD.  Skills aquired form playing these games become obsolite in DS2"

Eh, you're criticizing EA on the piratebay comment board? You think EA gives a shit what a thief like you and all of us has to say about dead space 2 especially on piratebay?

Don't criticize to EA about anything after stealing the game like this; they don't care. If you did buy the game after then go to the OFFICIAL forum and then complain. You're just making the comment page longer if you think EA going to care what a thief has to say.

Are you lazy? Try googling.

Anything one time deal. If you don't know how to download torrents thats your problem.. But to install this game or any other game you need a ISO read program like DAEMON Tools or something else. After you find a ISO read of your choice it should be easy from there on how to install. Cause ISO just a dvd/cd files which lets user to install game and what not with out dvd..

2. install by mounting iso with magicdisc(don't start the game just yet)
3. replace the deadspace2.exe with the crack one in the fairlight folder.
4. replace the crack exe with the new one(provided below)

thats all i did and i don't have any crashes...

Did you guys use the crack in the 'Fairlight' folder that is located with the two ISOs when you guys finished downloading?

Around chapter 2/3 I did use the updated crack

,Clavat99,2011-04-10T22:57Z,"lol p4th... I can tbelive you think you actually have to BURN the iso file. Install MagicDisk, download the iso file, then open up magic disk, select disk F:\\, then select Mount, then you browse for the iso file, then select it and it will be mounted. Then run it should run automatically, but if it dosnt, select the iso again via ""My Computer"". Once it runs, it will start installing to your computer. Make sure you have a registration code, or a crack before the installation starts, because a 10gb install takes a while. Once its installed, set up the crack and start playing! 

(one more reminder: as you all probably know this is highly illegal. But you will most likely NOT get caught, and if you do, only the uploade rof the file will face legal trouble, and you will just get sued by EA for for the current cost of the game. ie: around 40 bucks.)

(yet another reminder: make sure you ave ATLEAST 20gb left on your comp after this torrent is downloaded, otherwise the game will run HORRIBLEY)

(still another reminder: If the game wont run, try running it as an administartor and by clicking the .exe file in the actual core file (ie: going into my computer, disk C, program files, Electronic Arts, dead space 2.) this will usually make it easier for your computer to read and will run it. if your graphics suck and thats why its not running, well that sucks for you now dosnt it.)

(well what do you know... another reminder: DOWNLOAD QUICKLY! 1500 seeders will speed the download by ungodly amounts. Even with 600 leechers, you still got 900 seeders more! th elast time i downloaded soemthing with a seeder:leecher ratio this big, i was downloading at 4-6mb/sec average! sometimes it jumped to 10+mb/sec! and my comp sucks!)"

,Banzay27,2011-06-02T18:08Z,"Downloaded through this torrent just fine, in a jiffy. Good seeders, I hail you!
Coupled with Fairlight's (FLT) crackfix, which if I recall right was to fix a glitch that didn't let us play from chapter 7, the whole game I played through smoothly as a baby's ass. Well, maybe a necromorph baby's ass, given all the sci-fi undead in it. Annoying shits. I wasn't happy until I could sever limbs with one plasma cutter shot. When I was able to do that, up showed the hardcore black necromorphs. Woo-hoo.
But great game. The story has its share of holes but if you choose to overlook it, it's an entertaining ride with some fun interactive cutscenes. And that gore and violence... not for the faint of heart. If you're a Sims enthusiast, skip this."

,bartimeus973,2012-02-22T04:31Z,"So, for those who have got problem with the install or the serial key, there's how you should install the game (I had the same problem):

-mount or burn the .iso

-install the game normally whit EAsetup.exe or EAinstaller-something-like-it... that is located into the CD1

-THEN:get to your programs files and find the EAgames folder. There should be dead space 2 inside...

-INSTALL THE RELOADED CRACK:

-And then run the game...it should work...normally..."

,elcapizzo,2012-03-25T15:15Z,Game was working fine a few months ago. Just tried to play then and it won't load and gives a display error message. If I try to uninstall it it gives a message that it needs to be authorised to be uninstalled and then tries to activate the game! How can I remove this without having to activate it?
,kevosaur,2012-03-26T20:25Z,It works! thank you so much extremezone!!!

,bellialith,2012-03-27T22:49Z,"I downloaded it, installed it, i know the crack is messed up, but how the other crack links dont have seeds to download i was trying with this the same way.

My problem is, after installing it, and put the crack, i only get a black screen, and no loading, and i installed it 2 times just to make sure.

Anyone to give me a light?"
,TheLegionATI,2012-03-30T02:26Z,"Finished the game & i would like to delete it, but... it asked me for a game serial to be used with.... Fuck."

,BioHazard34,2012-04-28T11:51Z,"No no no... sorry was tired,

It's the name of the person who cracked the game and made this release, like ""SKIDROW"" for good example."

,tofumunch,2012-06-11T17:26Z,works perfect! and btw when prompted for serials during the uninstall just cancel and it will proceed normally. i actually had more fun than i initially expected. hell a lot scary yes but very enjoyable and definitely has a couple of replay values. 
,Heavenshost,2012-06-21T09:05Z,I don't believe it's as good as the first but still an excellent game.  Works perfectly with Windows 7 64-bit.
,mikedongs,2012-06-21T20:01Z,"skulldragon: there are plenty of other games that are FPS, go play one of them. i'm personally sick of them. same old cookie-cutter shit. being third person is one of the best things about dead space. this is something different and refreshing."
,rhoken,2012-06-22T04:23Z,"Hey I'm a bit of a noob with these torrents, sry, but what do I do for the CD Key crack? It says copy it from the folder but I see one document that is the intructions and a application program (game launcher) that is about 10mb bigger than the normal one and doesn't work.

What am I supposed to do? I've tried copying the application program (the roughly 60mb sized one) to the game folder (thus replacing the one that was there) but it just give me the usual ""windows has encountered a problem with this program and needs to close error"". When I used the other launcher it puts me through the activation process in which I need the key in which I don't have."
