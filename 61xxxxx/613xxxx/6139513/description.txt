STORYLINE
Six years ago NASA discovered the possibility of alien life within our solar
system. A probe was launched to collect samples, but crashed upon re-entry
over Central America. Soon after, new life forms began to appear and half
of Mexico was quarantined as an infected zone. A journalist agrees to escort
a shaken tourist through this infected zone to the safety of the US border.
