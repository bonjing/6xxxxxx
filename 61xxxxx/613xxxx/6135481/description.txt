"Reciprocity" 

When the Fringe Team visits Massive 
Dynamic's assembly of doomsday device, 
Walter becomes greatly concerned for 
Peter's well-being, so he turns to 
Nina for added brain power to 
understand the relationship between 
Peter and the superweapon. Meanwhile, 
the discovery of a dead body triggers 
an intense investigation.

Enjoy :)
