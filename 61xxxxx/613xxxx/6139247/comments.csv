,grunberd2,2011-01-31T06:30Z,Thanks so much for the upload. I loooove this series and can't believe how badly the US version is turning out
,Pinkhoney0269,2011-01-31T06:51Z,"I've been downloading this for 2 1/2 hours already, it's at 30% downloaded and says it's still got another 6 hours to go! "
[T],MelloYello,2011-01-31T21:23Z,Lol they only do 6-8 episodes a year?  The U.S. version isn't bad you should try watching it.  It's made for the U.S.  We don't like watching shows with British accents.  Another good thing is there will be more episodes per year instead of 8 and done.  Watch your version no need to hate on something different.  I'm sure you didn't like Let Me In because it was a U.S. version.  gg
,valques,2011-02-12T10:30Z,"The US version IS bad - it's awful - expect nothing less from your nation of Idiots..

And when you say 'We don't like watching shows with British accents', isn't the reality that you can't understand anything that isn't in a painful American twang?    That you can't face the fact (due to morbidly obese and profoundly misguided ego) that other countries can make TV shows that go far beyond the vapid, inane US standard?

.. you might consider how an entire nation of (mostly morbidly obese) individuals came to be such a tiny-minded, insular, and air-headed. But you probably won't because you're a part of the very nukeable problem...

megadeath to you and yours, America-boy."

,NoFun23,2011-03-12T07:55Z,"@ larrybomb420 & valques

You both seem like vapid, insular twats.  Valques: not everyone from America has a twang in their accent, we don't all come from Texas, you are clearly a prejudiced hypocrite.  Larry: I'm American, and there are plenty of British programs that I love and the vast majority of American adaptations have been shit.  Please exercise more restraint in your use of the word ""we"" in the future.  Also, British shows have shorter seasons for very legitimate reasons, which would add another paragraph to this post.

In closing: shut the fuck up, as both of you are shining justifications to thin a gene pool up a bit.  Thank you, good night."
,AKBTAKAMINA,2011-03-16T08:17Z,"Wow, 1 of you is wrong to say that we American don't like shows where the people have accents because I love British show like girl in love & sugar rush and i am not fond of the remake of Being human i only like the uk on. The other one of you is a mega douche for bash Americans like a stereotypical Brit and making you countrymen look bad. you both suck."
,w00tbie,2011-07-10T08:29Z,"amazing show, thanks eztv your uploads rule! and to everyone else for entertaining comments ^_^"
,panchonini,2011-07-13T00:05Z," I'm English and I loved the American version, although haven't seen the English version yet, I think usually you like the one you saw first, It doesn't really matter who made it."
,geekboy_x,2011-07-31T04:31Z,"I'm neither British nor United Statesian, but I have to agree that the US version is wretched.  I can ignore the bizarre United States accents - but I can't ignore the amateur dialog, brutal pacing, and piss-poor acting.  Oh - and the vocabularies.  Do adults in the US really have the verbal lexicon of half-witted pre-teens?  Or are they pandering to some sort of lowest common denominator in their audience?

The BBC series is premium.  The knock-off is worse than crap."
