Recorded live in Vienna's legendary Musikverein concert hall, this release represents Lang Lang's second live recorded recital to date after the best-selling "Live at Carnegie Hall" in 2004, which marked his international breakthrough as a recording artist.

 
The program for his Sony debut features Lang Lang's first-ever recording of Beethoven sonatas: The famous "Appassionata", a milestone in the piano literature, is paired with the composer's youthful C major Sonata op. 2, no. 3. Virtuosity of a different order is displayed in AlbÃ©niz's impressionistic memories of his native Spain in Book 1 of "Iberia." The program closes with one of Prokofiev's explosive War Sonatas, the revolutionary Seventh Sonata. Finally, to celebrate the Chopin Bicentennial we hear three encores of this Polish genius's most popular works: the "Aeolian Harp" Etude, the "Heroic" Polonaise in A flat major, and the sparkling Grande Valse Brillante No. 2. Featuring over 110 minutes of music on 2 CDs.
