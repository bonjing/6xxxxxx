,kela420,2011-05-07T09:10Z,does this work??
,sbxx,2011-05-16T20:39Z,"Yes it worked for me, but I'd like to elaborate on the instructions:

1. Install MathCAD Prime 1.0 F000 as Node-Locked license
	/**/ Node-Locked? WTF is that? I installed it as a TRIAL and it worked. /**/

2. Open mathcad_license.dat in any text editor and replace 00-00-00-00-00-00 in every-feature with your real ptc_hostid
	/**/ You can grab your ptc_hostid from the installer's splash screen /**/

3. Copy files ""efiutlr.dll"", ""mathcad_license.dat"" and ""Ptc.License.Plpf.dll"" to  and pverwrite original ones
	/**/ Overwrite the two DLLs but put the license file in a subdirectory called ""licenses"" /**/

4. Run MathCAD Prime 1.0. If program will not find license run Mathcad > Mathcad Options > License > License Configurations > File > Browse (browse to mathcad_license.dat) > Apply
	/**/ You won't need to browse for it if you did it like I said /**/"
