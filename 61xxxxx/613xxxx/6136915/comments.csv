,Emo6277,2011-02-03T06:54Z,What exactly does '320 kbps/256 kbps' mean? Was it originally 320 just upconverted?
[T],locobot12,2011-02-03T14:43Z,"@Emo6277

It means VBR - variable bitrate ranging from 256 ~ 320 kbps!"
,Emo6277,2011-02-03T19:40Z,But the files are in 320kbp/s cbr o3o

Are you complaining abt superior quality then??"
,Emo6277,2011-02-04T05:14Z,"no, i prefer 320, but i was just wondering how you got it in 320, its not a physical cd release and all the online retailers that sell this digitally dont sell this in 320"
,drweavil,2011-02-26T15:31Z,"was hoping to find the track that plays when u fail in zombies, it's like a metal song mixed with piano. you know what im talk about?"
,CraigGame,2011-04-09T16:43Z,@drweavil the game over theme...thats a short snippet from 'Abracadavre' which is featured in ascension. it isnt featured here because the album was released before the DLC was released
,Wolfareon,2011-05-02T00:15Z,Thank you! I'll be seeding this one for a while !
,YouFailed,2011-09-07T04:38Z,"@drweavil
Lullaby of a Dead Man sounds pretty close. I think that's one of them."
,AshArmy,2011-10-20T23:26Z,"Great quality, exactly what I wanted. 115 is my favorite!"
,-PoTstaR-,2012-02-09T16:09Z,Can you please upload the other 3 songs from the dlc?
