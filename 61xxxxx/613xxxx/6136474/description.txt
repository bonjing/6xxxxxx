quote from the post:
\\\"This project started on the 12th of december and quickly gained the interest of the finest musical artists on facepunch, and within six weeks the CD was completed.
A lot of people showed interest but sadly the CD would only have 16 tracks, but future projects will have more tracks so that more people can join in on the fun.

The CD is free of cost as mentioned earlier and each song can be downloaded, but hurry ; the free downloads only last 200 times, after that you will have to either wait until next month or pay for it. As it\\\'s free there is no price, but if you want to pay for it you can decide the price yourself!\\\"
