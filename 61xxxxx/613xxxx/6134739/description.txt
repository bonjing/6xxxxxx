Uploader\'s Note: In this download is included all video lectures, video transcripts, lecture handouts, assignments
and exams for the MIT OCW Course 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming. All of these files can be
found and downloaded from the MIT OCW Site: http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm


I did not have anything to do with this course, the recording or publishing of it or its materials. I have only
taken what MIT OCW was kind enough to give to the world and have compiled it into one large file. Hopefully making it available for those who can\'t stream the videos from their site.

Please remember to go to the website: http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm and donate if at all possible to keep this
wonderful initiative going.

The videos are .mp4 and ranging in quality as they are downloaded from the MIT OCW site.
If this is fairly popular I will be doing more, so if you go to the website and see any courses you would like done in this style feel free to hit me up.

6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming
As taught in: Fall 2008

Level: Undergraduate

Instructors:

Prof. Eric Grimson

Prof. John Guttag


Course Description:

This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience.
It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, to feel justifiably confident
of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
The class will use the Pythonâ„¢ programming language.

**Warning: On the Python homepage, the latest version available for download is actually 3.0. Do not install this!
This version is not backwards compatible with the code that you\'ll be writing in this course
(for example, you have to type print(\"test\") instead of print test.)**

MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) is a web-based publication of virtually all MIT course content.
OCW is open and available to the world and is a permanent MIT activity.


What is MIT OpenCourseWare?

MIT OpenCourseWare is a free publication of MIT course materials that reflects almost all the
undergraduate and graduate subjects taught at MIT.

* OCW is not an MIT education.
* OCW does not grant degrees or certificates.
* OCW does not provide access to MIT faculty.
* Materials may not reflect entire content of the course.

What it takes to support this work:

Each course we publish requires an investment of $10,000 to $15,000 to compile course materials from faculty,
ensure proper licensing for open sharing, and format materials for global distribution.
Courses with video content cost about twice as much, but your feedback about the significant value of these
video materials helps to justify the cost. (From the MIT OCW Website: http://ocw.mit.edu/about/ )
