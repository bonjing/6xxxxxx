"Bang-ja Chronicles" (BANGJAJEON) is a motion picture twist to Chunhyangjeon, a classic Korean romance novel. In this new film, Kim changes its plot - in the original novel, it's a love story of Mongryong and Chunhyang, but in the film, Bangja, Mongryong's servant, joins in to make it a love triangle.

Kim Joo-hyeok plays Bangja, Ryoo Seung-beom as Mongryong and Jo Yeo-jeong as Chunhyang. The film opens on June 3.

The original novel has been adapted into movies several times, most notably as SEONG CHUNHYANG in 1961 by Shin Sang-ok. Starring Choi Eun-hee and Kim Jin-gyu as Chunhyang and Mongryong, respectively, it was one of the first full color-cinemascope Korean films. Veteran director Im Kwon-taek also made his own adaptation CHUNHYANG in 2000, starring Jo Seung-woo and Lee Hyo-jeong.
