The only shit is your comment here. This version of McAfee comes directly from McAfee's website. So i think it is time to clean your shitty computer and after that buy an antivirus program yourself with your shitty creditcard!
Cheers!"
,harcownikov,2011-02-26T16:57Z,"Hi there!

I have one problem. Everything is all right but active protection on my computer doesn't work.
All previous versions worked correctly but this one cannot. It do update and scan, but active protection can't be set up.

PS. I'm McAfee user for about 5 years and really know how to use that. But problem may be that I have SP2 on my Windows XP. It should be all right, but maybe it isn't. Do you have active protection enabled correctly? PLease answer. Thank you. Maybe system setup help me. :-) Thank's for that upload!!!!"
