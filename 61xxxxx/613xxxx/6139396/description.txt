McAfee Virusscan Enterprise 8.8 MultiLingual

McAfee VirusScan Enterprise combines anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall, and intrusion prevention
technologies to stop and remove malicious software. It also extends coverage to new security risks
and reduces the cost of responding to outbreaks with the industryÃ†s lowest impact on system performance.

With VirusScan Enterprise, you get:
Maximum defense against malware Ã¹ Safeguards your systems and files from viruses, spyware, worms,
Trojans, and other security risks. It detects and cleans malware, and allows you to easily configure
policies to manage quarantined items.

Proactive protection from attacks Ã¹ Real-time scanning ensures all your systems, including remote
locations, are protected from current and emerging threats. VirusScan Enterprise also guards against
buffer-overflow exploits that target vulnerabilities in Microsoft applications.

Easy, centralized management Ã¹ The McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) platform is the centralized
management console for deploying policies, managing security alerts, and viewing automated reports.

Low impact on performance Ã¹ New for 2011, VirusScan Enterprise has been redesigned for performance,
from startup to on-demand and on-access scanning. Independent tests show industry-leading performance
of two to four times faster than the competition.
