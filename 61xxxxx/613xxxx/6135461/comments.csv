,jazzyxoxo,2011-02-03T07:50Z,Hey man thanks for this. I got a great copy of the movie without the subs though and now im confused as to how you add them to the movie. Could you help me? Sorry im kind of new at this.
,NaNaMoose,2011-02-03T14:11Z,Thanks for this! @jazzyxoxo There is a great program you can get here on TPB called Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate that takes the guess work out of sub files among many other useful features i had 100 other programs to do!

rename the srt file to the movie file name exactly the same!!

if that doesn work , u have to manually load subs using ur player !
just right click on ur player while the movie is playing and look about ... i am sure u will find the load subtitle menu!!
just browse to the folder and add the file!!"
