Hi there! =)

Heres a very fast guide how I encode my (iPod.Zune.PSP) movies.

I use Handbrake Nightly builds which can be found here :
 
https://build.handbrake.fr/view/Nightlies/

Be sure to update it once in a while as they get better and better.




Heres the code line for the advanced window in handbrake :

cabac=0:ref=2:me=umh:bframes=0:trellis=0:subq=8:weightb=0:fast-pskip=1:8x8dct=0:weightp=0:merange=24




Have fun and please..... share with the world! 

We are all equal and we are all awesome!!
