,cheatscrater,2011-01-29T00:31Z,"Thanks for this but I am confused where to download and what to download. 

Do we download HandBrake-svn3769-Win_CLI or 
                        HandBrake-svn3766-Win_GUI?

or give me a direct link to the exact download"
,cheatscrater,2011-01-29T00:46Z,"Thanks for this torrent but which one do I download from the website provided? 

    * HandBrake-svn3766-Win_GUI.exe [fingerprint]
    * HandBrake-svn3769-Win_CLI.zip [fingerprint]
    * libhb_svn3769_i686.zip [fingerprint]

Can you give me a direct download link because I am confused."
[T],on.off.on,2011-01-29T01:04Z,"@cheatscrater are you too lazy to read the website?

website :

Please make sure to download the ""GUI"" (Graphical User Interface) unless you specifically want the CLI (Command Line interface) build. 

GUI Notes: 
Just download and install. There is no longer any need to also download the Windows CLI build. 

;)"

Just wondering what subs you used to encode Shrek Quadrilogy its the only set of subs that seem to work on my iPod Classic.

All the srt and other subs I've added to my videos don't show up on the iPod Classic.

Hope your able to get back to me on this but enjoy your permanent break if you can't."
