Chance was born on August 16, 1997[1][2] in Wichita Falls, Texas and now resides in Edmond, Oklahoma.[3] He is the youngest child of Scott and Lisa Chance; he has a 16-year-old sister, Alexa, and a 19-year-old brother, Tanner, both of whom also play music.[8] Chance began playing the piano at the age of 8 and has had three years of piano lessons, but no formal vocal training. His inspiration comes from Lady Gaga; after seeing her performance of "Paparazzi" at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, he said: â€œI was awestruck by her performance. I love her sense of drama and theatricality, plus sheâ€™s an amazing singer and piano player.â€ Chance also admires Christina Aguilera, the rock band Augustana, R&B singer John Legend, singer-songwriter Elton John and late Beatle John Lennon: â€œI love artists who are able to communicate their emotions through music and sing from the heart. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m hoping to do with my songs .â€[3][4]
In May 2010, Chance completed his 6th grade at Cheyenne Middle School in Edmond, Oklahoma for the school year 2009â€“2010
