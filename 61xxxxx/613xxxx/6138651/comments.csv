Replaces the dock, stacks, finder and spotlight. No trial version, so use this and if you like it, buy it.
For me, quickpick replaces the apps dragthing and overflow."
,espirates,2011-01-31T08:35Z,It doesn't get much better then dock and stacks.  All this app does is re-invent the wheel.  You still have to click on it just like the dock and how does it replace the finder ?
