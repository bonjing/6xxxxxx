Episode 9: "Treasure of Beard Beard" is a completely new
episode to add to Naughty Bear. In this episode, Pirates led
by the infamous Bear Beard come to the Island to dig up a
fantastic treasure said to be hidden right in the middle of
the island. Naughty Bear can't let those annoying invaders
dig in his backyard, can he!? Along with the new story, get
four new pirate costumes to wear. Arm yourself with the
powerful Cutlass, a brand new weapon that comes with its
unique Ultra-Kill. In addition, complete the four challenges
for a total of 20 new Naughty Cups to unlock and 5 new
leaderboards to dominate!
