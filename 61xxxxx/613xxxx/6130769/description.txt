P.S.
jayawarden:  I kept getting database errors when I tried to post this in the Batman thread, but I trust you will find it here.
'Star.Wars.COMPLETE.PACK.720p.HDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON' is on
I will do Ben Hur as soon as I can find it.
Lethal Weapon series on TPB already, 'Lethal Weapon Quadrilogy 720p BDRip XviD AC3-FLAWL3SS'.
FLAWL3SS has ripped all of the Ocean's series, but I can't find a torrent of them.  FilesTube is your friend.  I only have ~65KBps upstream and too many of my own rips still in the queue.
Ali, The Last Emperor, Bad Boys, Mad Max (1 & 2, Beyond Thunderdome doesn't appear to be on BluRay) are now queued.
E.T. is on BluRay, but I can't find a rip anywhere, if I find one I'll do it.  I loved that movie when I was a kid :).
