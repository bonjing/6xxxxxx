1.0.1.167
Released 1/20/2011
[CRASHES]
â€¢Dead interceptor crash fix (occurred frequently in late-game, usually on the AI turn)
â€¢Movement limit crash fix (occurred when any high-movement unit, a gunship in this case, made use of the railroad bonus and moved beyond the engine visualization limits)
â€¢Crash fix for diplo AI. When the player witnesses an AI leader buy a minor ally, and aggressively purchased them back, the game would eventually crash when the AI leader would correctly try to complain to you about it.
â€¢The following crashes were all discovered via the Steam Crash Reporting system that Civilization V utilizes:
â€¢Crash - pCitizens->GetCityPlotFromIndex(iPlotLoop); is returning NULL in the CvPlayer::DoRevolt loop.
â€¢Crash - Occasionally strange values are sent to the movement cursor code. Wrap and clamp the values before they get to the pathfinder.
â€¢Crash - Fix to divide by zero crash with AI buying plots.
â€¢Crash - In RouteValid, the CvTacticalAnalysisMap cell thinks a plot is claimed, but the plot itself has no owner.
â€¢Crash - Era out of bounds during a reload.
â€¢Crash - During a resync, a crash happens when GameplayUnitCreated calls CvPlot::GetActiveFogOfWarMode apparently because the game's ActiveTeam is NO_TEAM (-1).

[GAMEPLAY]
â€¢Fix to Golden Age length (for Reformation policy with both the Persian trait and Chichen Itze)
â€¢Corrected duration of golden ages generated from Taj Mahal and when a Persian player has Chichen Itza (Before the multiple 50% additions were "compounded" rather than added together into a 100% bonus.)

[UI]
â€¢Fix to blank science victory details screen
