,Bob Marlone,2011-03-26T09:48Z,Does anyone else seem to be missing library files? The number of components I have seems extremely limited.
,Bob Marlone,2011-03-26T09:55Z,"Nevermind... Seems a little oversight in the software(not the uploader's fault) requires you click ""Select All Families"" to see everything, instead of showing everything when nothing is clicked..."

,hp2311X,2011-12-29T01:03Z,Works great...even on Win 7. ESET scanned no virus. Just follow .doc instructions or view mp4 included to install. NICE JOB! So many come with crappy instructions....nice to see a complete job. Buy the program after you evaluate to your liking.
,sarka1,2012-01-29T21:52Z,"To install this program, run the license generator and write down the serial it gives! Then generate the license you wish to use.

Install the program with the serial you have, run license manager and drag&drop the license files in to the manager.

Ready to use!
