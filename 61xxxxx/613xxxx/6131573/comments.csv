This seems to have been a problem with Avidemux so this time I remuxed the FLV with ffmpeg instead and the sync problems are gone!

FLV is a closed and proprietary format created by Adobe to deliver video over the internet. There is no free and open specification of this file format that will make sure we'll be able to read it in the future.

I think the only way to spread this movie is through an open container format like Matroska. I don't know, it just feels right =)"

A?
V?
somebody?"
,Fant0men,2011-01-28T17:12Z,"Open the official YouTube version and see for yourself (this is the 480p version). This is a straight rip, the audio and video were just copied (not transcoded).

Hope this helps =)"
,Laser Freck,2011-01-31T10:39Z,"For some reason the video is totally lagging behind on this for me, to the point of getting stuck. Not trying to clank down on your encoding, but that's my experience with this."
,rattyhayden,2011-01-31T16:18Z,ummmm so does this work now or is it still lagging sound with video??
,Fant0men,2011-01-31T22:29Z,"Laser Freck: I didn't encode this. YouTube did. I only remuxed it. I can't speak for everyone but it works fine here. But I've only tested it in VLC.

rattyhayden: I wouldn't upload it if it was. Download it and try. I think it'll work."
,Fant0men,2011-01-31T22:44Z,Now I tested it in MPlayer (OSX Extended) and it works there as well..
,Jack_Raiden,2011-03-27T18:50Z,"Yes, this release is definitely out of sync.

Brilliant film, once again. No matter how apathetic you think you are, the Zeitgeists will pry your mind open like few others."
,Fant0men,2011-05-21T13:36Z,"If this release is out of sync, then I wonder why there's still 37 peers seeding it... It's NOT out of sync, folks."
