,cracky6711,2011-04-29T00:23Z,Can I ask what torrent host people are using to download the file because at the moment utorrent seems to be extremely slow! I'm not sure why but i was wondering what everyone else was using? thanks in advance

The app it self run fine on my Win7 x64 bits!
Many Thanks, no crack or serial needed!"
,Sin4life2000,2011-05-23T04:15Z,"btw i saw u needed to do something to host. u can also do this that i found for newer systems.

1st: (windows vista, 7 users) Click start and search ""fire"" (without quotes), 
now click ""Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.

2nd: The program should open. On the left sidebar find 
""Outbound Rules"" and click on it. Go to the very right under actions and click ""New Rule.""

3rd: Click ""Program"" and find Adobe photoshop in your 
C: drive under programs. Find the application .exe and click open. 
Then click next. Now click ""Block The Connection"" if it already isn't. 
Now under when does this rule apply, check mark all of the boxes. 
Then name it whatever you want, and click finish. Mine: Blocking Photoshop

4th: Do the same for ""Inbound Rules""
------------------------------
also wanted to thank you for a amazing torrent, so hard to find good pirates these days. 

also was wondering if you could prehack cs5
^_^ and thanks again, and keep up the good work.

""once a pirate, always a pirate"""
,str8arrow,2011-05-28T07:51Z,"To Kentucky Kid:
Just wanted to say thanks...have enjoyed a number of your torrents. Am impressed with your skills (and grateful for your generosity). Thanks!!  (I feel like I've come to know you!) Thx for being a fantastic pirate and for letting the rest of us enjoy the spoils. C u again....on TPB or KAT, perhaps??"

,DestielForever,2011-07-19T04:31Z,THIS IS THE BEST TORRENT EVER!!!! THANK YOUUUU!!!! 
,tn_agnel67,2011-08-05T17:39Z,"Now, does this have the brushes and patterns and etc in a folder too? I downloaded one that I couldn't find the damned brushes to lol 
So, if this is as good as everyone says and I can get to the brushes easily I'll use it :)"
,tn_agnel67,2011-08-05T17:46Z,"I hope this comes with the Presets like brushes and patterns in a folder nice and easy to locate.  I downloaded one yesterday and could never find the brushes to load in.  Also, brushes from a previous version of PS from a torrent wouldn't load in the new one either, so hopefully all goes smooth for me :) "
,tn_agnel67,2011-08-05T17:47Z,"If this came through more than once, I apologize! My screen kept saying couldn't display page lol "
,rupelto,2011-08-07T06:06Z,"Thank you, top of the cs4 search."
