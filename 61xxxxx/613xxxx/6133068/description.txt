The 1 click kids are bad crop with black and 
junk at top. Yet another reason it pays to 
actually do shit yourself instead of relying 
on poor tools to encode from your jaacked 
sources for you.
"The Seminar"
With Andy's (Ed Helms) sales at his lowest 
ever, he gets desperate and holds a small 
business seminar with the help of some 
special guests . Michael (Golden Globe winner 
Steve Carell) and Holly turn the event into 
an improv challenge. Meanwhile, Erin (Ellie 
Kemper) enlists some of her co-workers in her 
scrabble battle with Gabe (Zach Woods).

Enjoy :)
