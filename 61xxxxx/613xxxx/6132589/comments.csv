I'm a huge fan of the Brat Pack movies and actors, so I'm desperately looking for these - Kansas (1988, with Andrew McCarthy and Matt Dillon), Heaven Help Us (1985, with Andrew McCarthy and Mary Stuart Masterson) and Oxford Blues (1984, with Rob Lowe and Ally Sheedy). Any chance that you have them?.."
