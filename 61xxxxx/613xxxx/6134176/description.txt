Why 3.1
-------
Aside from correcting a few spelling mistakes in this file, the real reason for this update is because some of the files in v3.0 have been altered on my computer before I was able to completely seed the torrent, thus making it impossible for anyone to get 100% of the torrent. Why it happened? To be honest, I have no idea. I don't recall modifying any file after releasing v3.0 and my computer did not behave in any suspicious way, perhaps it is simply a problem with the hash when the torrent was created, but one sure thing is that a few files such as this file, Wolverine #088 and Deadpool & Widdle Wade were impossible to download and a whole bunch of people were stuck at 99.99%.

If you are one of those person unable to complete Deadpool Collection v3.0, here is what to do:
1. Make sure you keep all the files you downloaded from Deadpool Collection v3.0.
2. Remove the Deadpool Collection v3.0 torrent from your active torrents in your torrent client.
3. Rename the folder "Deadpool Collection v3.0" to "Deadpool Collection" with no version number.
4. Download the Deadpool Collection v3.1 torrent from Demonoid.
5. Open the Deadpool Collection v3.1 torrent with your torrent client and save it where your Deadpool Collection folder is located.

The torrent should automatically check for completed files, skipping the files you already have and only downloading the few missing files.

-------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------
I went through every single file, one by one, to make sure that
---------------------------------------------------------------
-Every scan is complete
-There is no corrupted image/file (I either fixed the error or re-downloaded another scan)
-Deadpool did appear in the issue


--------------------------
I also took the liberty to
--------------------------
-Removed the nfo/txt file present in some scans as they are now outdated anyway
-Removed most adds from the scans
---> Why? This collection will get bigger over time and size is a matter for some people. The size of this current release is already 2.2 GB and if removing of couple of adds, that are anyway irrelevant to the story, can help reducing the size of this and the next release, then I say CHIMICHANGA!

Folder Structure and Download Instructions
------------------------------------------
The folder structure for version 3.1 is the same as version 3.0 and really similar to version 2.0. The only folder that was changed is the Appearances folder, which will be now keep that way for future releases. From now on, every appearance will be put in a title folder named according to the generic title of the issue. For example, both Wolverine Origins and Wolverine v2 will be found in the Wolverine folder located in the Appearances folder. This will avoid cluttering the Appearances folder and giving easy and simple reference points for all appearances. Moreover, the Deadpool Collection folder will no longer have the version number in its name, thus making it even easier for you to download future versions.

If you already have any version of Deadpool Collection, what I recommend doing for downloading this version is to first remove the Appearances folder, then rename the main folder to "Deadpool Collection" and then save this torrent where your former folder is located. Why? Aside from the Appearances folder and a few fixed files, most of the files in this version are either new files or the same old files present in the last version. Thus, if you simply save this version over the last one and you did not change the name of the files/folders inside the main folder, your torrent client should inspect the files you already have and skip them in order to only download the new files added. This operation will be much faster than downloading the whole torrent and it will be made even more user friendly for future releases. You will also save on bandwidth.
