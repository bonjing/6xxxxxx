Photographing a moving subject requires the right balance of shutter speed, aperture, and lighting values. In this course, photographer Frank Doorhof shows viewers some techniques for freezing a subject in motion. He travels to an outdoor skate park to shoot a BMX bicycle rider and then goes into the studio to photograph a leaping model. During the shoots, Doorhof talks about how he adjusts his lighting setups and camera settings. He also discusses the importance of changing perspective, how to use strobes and flashes to achieve high contrast effects, a white balance trick for colorizing your images, and how to use scrims and flags to eliminate lens flare. Photographing moving subjects can yield some exciting and dynamic images so follow along with this Kelby Training course and learn how it is done.
