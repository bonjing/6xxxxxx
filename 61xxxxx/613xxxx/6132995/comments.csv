Still waiting"
,Devianex,2011-01-28T21:07Z,Hey guys! Thanks for the interest. I'll try reseeding it when I get home tonight but it should have started seeding already. Hmm. Should be seeding by tomorrow the latest.
,Devianex,2011-01-29T02:06Z,Should be seeding now. Came home to find that the file had been moved so it didn't know where to seed from. Fixed!
