,jkeller80,2011-02-26T19:50Z,"@elghorba is fucking nuts.  This is very real but...

I can't get the sound to work.  I find this usually with AC3 audio and mkv files.  Why is that?  Sound is great but voices are nil.  I hate messing with extra (individual) codecs after downloading the latest K-Lite media codec with Media Classic Player or even VLC.  Why the hell is this?"
