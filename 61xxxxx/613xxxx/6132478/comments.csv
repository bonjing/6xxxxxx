,seafloor,2011-01-30T18:43Z,"Although the technical quality is very well, I've barely seen such a dumb storyline. The hero and second in command plays the caring houseman meanwhile his ex-wife saves the world by finding out that the meteors are somehow magnetic. Nice special effects alone doesn't make a movie. I feel pity for the poor actors."
