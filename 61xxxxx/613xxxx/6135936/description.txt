PlayStation-Ready HD Movie Trailers
28th of January, 2011


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in HD 1080p. Since I rarely
manage to release trailers on Thursdays, from now on the official
release date moves to Fridays. Also, Sundance movie trailers
tend to be dull.
