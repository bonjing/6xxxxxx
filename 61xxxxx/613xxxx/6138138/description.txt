When the police officer responding to the crash is shot, the SRU is called to the scene. When the driver of the car involved in the crash is identified as Sgt. McCoy from 52 division Spike is desperate to rescue his mentor. With the bus on fire the prisoners and Sgt. McCoy flee. Until report of a police officer carjacking a woman is received Spike believes Sgt. McCoy is a hostage. When it is revealed that he pulled rank to get the prisoner transfer and that he insisted upon doing it without a partner Spike has a hard time accepting that his former mentor and training officer is involved with corruption, drug dealers, and an attempted gang execution because he was so devoted to taking care of his recently deceased wife and troubled daughter.
