,Strikefear13,2011-01-30T06:37Z,Can I download and apply this update alone to the original game or do I need updates 1-3 as well?
,MiniZaggy,2011-01-30T07:55Z,"Its real, works great installed from a patched #2 to patch #4, no problem, no virus. "

,mandipdas,2011-01-30T10:27Z,"@Strikefear13, you don't need any previous updates... :D"
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-01-30T14:18Z,"i hope online works.. but i'm not downloading this patch for that, tho.. i'm having so many problems with the cutscenes..."
,Uixdt,2011-01-31T15:16Z,"To play it on online just don't use the crack.

1.) Install game
2.) Install Update 4
3.) Set steamappid to 73050
4.) Run & play"
,Taanys,2011-01-31T21:15Z,"Uixdt - Does your solution needs to have Steam running? Let's say I don't have steam installed, can I play online without the crack?

If I want to play lan only, is it okay to put the crack?"
