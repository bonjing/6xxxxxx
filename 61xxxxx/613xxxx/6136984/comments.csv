,enduin387,2011-01-31T20:43Z,Anyone beat hardcore mode and not get the Hand Cannon? Could just be another PC glitch like the Elite suit schematics or the save tickets replenishing after restarting the game on hardcore but I havent found a mention of anyone else not getting it.

,Sil3nt_Pr0digy,2011-02-02T13:48Z,"@ wedran1950

WTF are you going on about? are you talking about MP? FFS are you that stupid? It's been years since a crack came out which allows MP. If you are bitching because it doesn't have Story Co-Op then you sir are missing out on an excellent game. The Story would be ruined with Co-Op, as Issac's Dementia is an important part of it all.

Next time, think before you make such rash and undesirable comments.

The crackfix works excellently Mbb15, not that I ever doubted you :D

Too bad PC version is glitched tho, I can't wait until Visceral fixes it so that PC can get the elite suits and HandCannons. 

@enduin387

Yes, no one can get any Unlockables from playing with New Game+ except for the Riot Security Rig. Visceral has taken note of the bug and are working to fix it. A patch should be released shortly. Hopefully it won't take long to crack."
,Mochok,2011-02-03T00:19Z,"Got to chapter 7. Game crashed when I tried to open the door then I downloaded this crackfix and it works! Love you guys!

,ReaperBr1,2011-02-04T21:53Z,"Any news about the elite suits problem

,dx3lm94,2011-02-21T02:40Z,i think theres a problem in the new game plus in where the part in chapter 2 or 3 where you enter the room and u see the ship crash and i get to the malfunctioning door which seems to not gain power back until i kill the exploding necromorphs for the first time( i played through the whole thing i know lol) and im wondering if anyone else has the same problem as me? :p

EA released a new patch that fixed the problem where the elite suit schematics on new game+ mode do not appear where they are supposed to.

The game does not crash, when I approach the door the blue hologram says ""Open"" and when I try, the hologram begins to spin to unlock the door, but like I said the door never opens.

I have used both the original crack and the crack fix release, but that door still will not open."
