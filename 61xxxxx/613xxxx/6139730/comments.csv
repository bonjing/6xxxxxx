,sozan,2011-01-31T06:57Z,"aftyrbyrn if you want to see tits and ass then go look at porn not NON-NUDE models, yeah a lil slip is great every now and then but the more it happens the more they become generic child model gone nude then forgotten"
,rbburner,2011-01-31T07:21Z,Total waste of good electrons!
,Zamugustar,2011-01-31T07:28Z,"She doesn't have to be completely nude or even giving slips every shoot but at least be fashionable, not sweatpants..."
,Alphamale1247,2011-01-31T08:06Z,total shite
,r030149,2011-01-31T10:18Z,boring!
,Sumiha,2011-01-31T12:17Z,"How the model poses I feel have nothing to do with the model herself. It's the ""creative"" team behind her.

And no, she can't overrule any of them unless she don't want to pose for them anymore."
,shdwolf1,2011-01-31T13:31Z,"yaawwnn....at least virginia and elle are trying to look sexy. I used to look forward to sandra posts; now I don't know why I bother. Is it just me, or does she look like she's getting real bored with the modeling? "
,ubisuck,2011-01-31T16:25Z,next week it's winter coat and boots ;-)
,br3zn3v,2011-01-31T18:54Z,"Let this day be marked as the one when I officially got bored with Sandra :p

You CAN be erotic and appealing without going 100% nude, you cannot be any of that while posing, lamely I might add, in lousy sweatpants :p"
,yogurtunge,2011-01-31T19:44Z,"when she did all those sandra-mod stuff, she was one of the prettiest girls on earth. Now on fame-girls she get boring and her new photographer is dreadful"
,buckweed,2011-01-31T21:03Z,"@sozan: The way this is heading, she will just be a child model gone forgotten.

I cannot understand how fame-girls can earn money at all these days, they took something that was ""ok"" and made it into bullshit, way to go."
,33wearhilton41,2011-01-31T22:07Z,"i must agree total shite,fame-girls wants to wake up or fuck off."
,Sammae7,2011-01-31T23:48Z,"I assume Sandra just doesn't want to model anymore.Her mom pretty much exploited her throughout her childhood and now that she is of age, I can understand her wanting to distance herself from modeling.Sucks hardcore but it's her choice."
,RIggsta,2011-02-01T02:26Z,"horrible, on the downcline they go...."
,fenderjoe,2011-02-01T02:49Z,next weeks preview does look a bit more promising. (t-shirt and panties)
,D0gmeat,2011-02-01T03:12Z,"Only for those that appreciate a pretty girl...I like that she actually looks relaxed in this one instead of the ""contrived trying to be hot"" look for her more risque shoots."
,proud0,2011-02-06T00:03Z,"I said some time ago that Sandra's heyday as a child/teen model is well passed. She's an adult model now. It was fun watching her grow and mature and to witness the changes she has gone through, but any fascination with that vanished a long time ago. Going full nude isn't the answer either. Her time has simply come and gone."
