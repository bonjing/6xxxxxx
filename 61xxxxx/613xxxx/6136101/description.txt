
The soundtrack to the Denzel Washington-starring thriller Virtuosity has a decidedly dance-influenced slant, but is balanced out with a handful of alternative rock tracks, the best-known of which would be Live's "White, Discussion." 
The reformed Talking Heads sans David Byrne and thusly appearing as The Heads contribute the slinky "No Talking, Just Head" (with Debbie Harry taking the lead on vocals). 
However, most of the material here is more along the lines of Fatima Mansion's pulsating dance-rocker "The Loyaliser," Juno Reactor's "Samurai," and techno in the form of Traci Lords' "Fallen Angel." 
With all of the songs here having appeared elsewhere and the album as a whole having little cohesion, the only fans that might feel compelled to seek out the Virtuosity soundtrack would be Peter Gabriel devotees as his fine collaboration with The Worldbeaters, "Party Man," is unavailable elsewhere.
