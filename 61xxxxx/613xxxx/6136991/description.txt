Storyline
Based on a true story, 'Red Dirt Rising' is the story of love in 
the time of moonshine as three of stock car racingâ€™s earliest heroes come of 
age to find escape from life's challenges on the track, ultimately shaping 
the future of their families --- and auto racing --- during the Fightinâ€™
Forties.

Jimmie Lewallen leads the pack as he struggles to extract himself 
from a life of poverty. Risky bootlegging and family farm obligations 
present early obstacles, but when he falls for a mysterious divorcee, 
Carrie James, he has to find a way to harmonize family and his love of racing.

Jimmie encounters camaraderie and competition in his best friends 
Bill Blair and Fred Harb. Together, their antics lay the groundwork for 
one of the most lucrative sports in the world. As racingâ€™s popularity 
rises, the boys witness tragedy and unscrupulous business practices until one 
manâ€™s vision to legitimize the sport offers them the chance of a lifetime.

From hauling moonshine on warm North Carolina evenings to marriage 
and fatherhood, the stakes are raised when the U.S. enters World War II 
and Jimmie must prove himself an honorable man on the battlefield, the 
track and at home. Many important racing firsts occurred during the 
Fightin'Forties, making this film a sensational history lesson as well as an
exciting journey of romance, friendship and action.
