Her look and attitude recently reaped some more mainstream rewards as Veronica Jett was selected to star in a music video for the rock band Papa Roach, for their single '...To Be Loved'. When asked in a recent interview how she scored the role, Veronica said 'When the director was casting he came up to me and said â€˜Can I put you in a dog collar? And I said, â€˜You can hang me from the ceiling and put a fist in my ass if you want.â€™ I guess that convinced him I was perfect for the part.â€
