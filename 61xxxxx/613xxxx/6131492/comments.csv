,dbel108,2011-02-12T23:09Z,"I'm having trouble with this one. I downloaded it, and I noticed it is in a .rar file. So I opened ImgBurn, and burned it onto a DVD5, but it doesn't play on my bluray or PS3. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? thanks."
,dbel108,2011-02-12T23:12Z,"I'm having trouble. I downloaded it, and realized it was a .rar file. I paid it no mind, and burned it to a DVD5, but it doesn't play on my sharp bluray player. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? thank you."
,dbel108,2011-02-12T23:37Z,"Nevermind. I read the notes. However, I downloaded 7-zip (as PowerISO is not free), but when I try to extract it, it says ""cannot open file as an archive and doesn't extract it. All I want is to burn it onto a DVD5 to watch it on my bluray player. thanks HD-R-US for a great selection, but I would appreciate your help. I'm so close!"
,dbel108,2011-02-13T00:32Z,"I'm currently burning the file to a DVD. I followed all the instructions, so hopefully it works fine. I'll post a comment once it worked. thanks HD!!!!"
,dbel108,2011-02-13T01:06Z,"shit!! it didn't work. I am so close, I don't know what I am doing wrong. I downloaded powerISO, extracted the files, i have imgburn, I got the BDMV and certificate folders, followed the instructions, burned it and it can't be read on my bd player. all help will be appreciated. if i get it right for this one, i can download all of HD-R-US other movies. thanks."
[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-14T16:57Z,"dbel108 - Firstly, there is no .rar file. It is a disk image file, an iso. Secondly, you didn't need to extract the files/folders if you wanted to burn it. Your PS3 is an AVCHD compatible blu-ray player, but have you confirmed that your Sharp blu-ray player is AVCHD compatible?  "
,dbel108,2011-02-15T02:35Z,"firstly, thanks HD for your fast comment and help. My sharp bluray is in fact AVCHD compatible. Is there anything else you think may be wrong? thanks."
,Cole Sprouse,2011-03-14T18:25Z,"If you cannot play this, try burning it to disc or mounting the ISO, then open the disc in your computer (right click on the drive and select ""Open""), go to the \BDMV\STREAM directory and play the file 0000.m2ts with VLC or Windows Media Player. It works."
