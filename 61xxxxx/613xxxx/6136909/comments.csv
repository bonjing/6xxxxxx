,juxta99,2011-04-11T13:35Z,"Not the best video quality 

Vid 6

Some high pitched noise in some and the aspect is badly cut"
,TheLastSon,2011-04-11T15:38Z,"Thanks uploader great torrent, 

A - 7  V - 7, 

standard definition quality but a little tweak for sharpness in vlc helps, otherwise good upload will seed for a week or two cheers"
,juxta99,2011-04-13T13:39Z,"Na actually decided its unwatchable, high pitched noise through most, varied volume from normal to a whisper. Data crime :("
,autoclave,2011-06-02T00:48Z,"juxta99,
you unthankful dick head. If you really want to watch this series the quality is more than good enough.

And having that said I can't see why you rate the quality as that low. I don't notice any of the high pitched noises and changes of volume that you do. Time to change into a better player than the shitty VLC? MPC is the best.

I've uploaded 800 GB of this now, and the health of this torrent is looking good."
,BUZZBOX64,2012-02-23T18:00Z,"Juxta66 is right, theres an ear piercing high pitched noise that's really annoying. Unfortunately all the uploads of river monsters are a bit poor at best. I may just buy the dvd's,  you can get the first season box set from amazon for ÂŁ5 delivered..... "
,richme,2012-04-20T17:56Z,thanks for your upload men :D
