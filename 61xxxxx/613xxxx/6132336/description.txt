There's a battle brewing between the Mixtape DJs, the Performers, Retailers and Buyers on one side and the multi-billion dollar Record Labels and the Copyright Infringement Authorities (RIAA) on the other. Its a love-hate relationship and some have paid the price - jail, fines and more.

The financial stakes are extremely high. These entrepreneurial compilations are now the root of a new power struggle -- the urban streets of America and Mixtapes (the other music industry) vs. the traditional corporate music industry.
