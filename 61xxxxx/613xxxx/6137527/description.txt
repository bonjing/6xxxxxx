Ephesians 6:10-20

The Armor of God

 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord
 and in his mighty power.

 11 Put on the full armor of God,
 so that you can take your stand against the devilâ€™s schemes.

 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
 but against the rulers,
 against the authorities,
 against the powers of this dark world
 and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God,
 so that when the day of evil comes,
 you may be able to stand your ground,
 and after you have done everything,
 to stand.

 14 Stand firm then,
 with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
 with the breastplate of righteousness in place,

 15 and with your feet fitted
 with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

 16 In addition to all this,
 take up the shield of faith,
 with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

 17 Take the helmet of salvation
 and the sword of the Spirit,
 which is the word of God. 

 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.
 With this in mind,
 be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lordâ€™s people.

 19 Pray also for me,
 that whenever I speak,
 words may be given me so that I will fearlessly
 make known the mystery of the gospel,

 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains.
 Pray that I may declare it fearlessly,
 as I should.

â€œThe quest for wisdom is... faithâ€™s [mysteries]...
The inflexible ways of insight...
...impose discipline unto thy flesh(!)...
[While] imposing discipline to learning the ways of man...
...gaze at the faculties of each spirit...
Gaze into the [motive]s of mankind...
The secrets of the way things are.

The weight of manâ€™s spirit...
Then understand the movement unknown to that man...
...[that moves that man]...
...everything that has happened in him...
...to him and [through him]...
While seeing her, wisdom... [that liveth in him].

Then will you understand that nature of man.
Whatever is left with you guard carefully.
...discipline...
...wisdom...
...insight...
Those things that have been given to... [you]...

Judgment is not affected through the hearing...
...not affected through the seeing...
Be not deceived by vile emotions...
...The All Seeing leads... [you]...
Meditate on the secret of why things...
...are...
Investigate it at all times...
...fearful things [you] will master...â€
