,luffyq1,2011-01-29T07:52Z,It would be nice if you told us where you got this episode from. Thank you for the episode.
[T],despo1ler,2011-01-29T09:56Z,"@luffyq1, the guys at cartoon palace get these episodes from the TV and encode them for the rest of us who cant receive the same channels to watch, at present they are the only group releasing many great cartoon series like G I Joe renegades and Avengers earths mightiest heroes so they deserve a lot of thanks.
  This guy releases torrents for the group before anyone else has them so if you want more {C_P} releases  bookmark and check his torrent list regularly. or visit on IRC.
