,ltamake,2011-01-30T10:40Z,"Pretty sure it's to4str trying to get it taken down, not Kimmo."
,Pendejo13,2011-01-31T07:41Z,I'm seeding indefinately. Fuck you kimmo. I'm coming for you toasty.
,JohnShit,2011-02-01T11:41Z,Why does to4str want this gone? It's not like we're attacking AnonBBS. Perhaps we should...
,ltamake,2011-02-01T16:06Z,To4str's just a poor troll.
,ltamake,2011-02-04T05:29Z,"Actually, it was jimmy (who's apparently an admin on AnonBBS, so he's no worse than to4str). Meh."
,ltamake,2011-02-05T22:08Z,*no better
