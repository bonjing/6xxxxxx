They came from the stars, i saw them are an ever
shifting unit of musicians here to play glorious
pop music on behalf of the gay masters that
secretly watch over the affairs of the universe.
They have been sent with a message for you good
people, although they cannot divulge the exact
nature of the message at this time (mainly
because the message is largely incomprehensible,
even with a special hat). We understand that
they are the only artists here doing this
overtly, although we have been told that there
are others working for them covertly, and yet
still more whose minds have been programmed by
the masters and are doing their bidding without
even being aware of it. They came from the
stars, i saw them have ebbed and flowed along
their merry stream since 1999 in all manner of
incarnations from the sublime to the ridiculous,
and are currently honed down to a 4-piece rock
and rock outfit. The album is a glorious mash up
styles and you can hear hot chip, !!!, the
rapture, exotica, 80's pop and more.
