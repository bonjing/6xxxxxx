Eike, an ordinary man on an ordinary day, goes for a walk after visiting a cafe. However, he gets silently stabbed by an unknown assailant. He wakes up in a strange 'room' where a voice offers Eike the chance to be alive once more. Although Eike is initially sceptical, thinking the voice to be a malicious spirit, he accepts the offer. The mysterious voice gives Eike the Digipad which allows Eike to time-travel, but it can only be used at certain times. Eike revives and wakes up in the cafe once more. Startled, he leaves and wanders the town, until he stumbles upon a fortune-teller and seeks advice on whether he might still die again. The fortune teller confirms Eike's suspicions; Eike will die at 2:30 PM if he is alone at that time. Using the Digipad, Eike travels back in time to 2:00PM and informs wandering townspeople to gather in the town square at 2:30. Upon returning to the present, Eike sees that his plan has worked, as a small crowd of people have arrived to watch a performer. Eike also watches, and his would-be killer comes along, but flees the area upon seeing the crowd. Eike returns to the fortune teller to see if he has successfully avoided his fatal fate. However, she now informs him that he will now die at 3:00 PM
