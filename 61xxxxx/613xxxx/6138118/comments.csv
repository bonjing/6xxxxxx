,keleieke,2011-02-04T20:13Z,"KK; you're my hero.  I use Roboform daily.  The version 7xx is, however, not better than version 6xx IMHO.  Version 7 adds more bells, but not needed.  Mainly though, version 7 maintains it's toolbar.exe running in the background, and the service refuses to stay disabled.  I fell back to version 6.10.1 which doesn't require itself running in the background at all times.  "

After step 2 in the instructions you have to go into your startup menu and disable RoboForm. Reboot your computer and then follow step 3. Now go back and enable RoboForm in your startup menu and you will be good to go. 
Great program, thanks for sharing."

Note: You can copy over your Logins and identities from 6.x.x ... just don't overwrite the license.rfo & license.rfo.nnnnnnnn files.
Also, I just updated to 7.2.2 and all seems to be working fine so far.
Thanks again, KK"
