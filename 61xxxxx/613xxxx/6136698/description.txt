Mei is a masochist. If she could beat herself like PD does she would do it every day. But something about self infliction just does not get her motor running like having someone stronger than herself making her feel the pain. Every strike from a cane or whip brings a blinding flash of pain and a rush of endorphins. As her body responds to the suffering she starts to feel high on her own hormones. She is addicted to those twin sensations, both the cause and her own reaction. More than orgasms, more than love, more than anything else there is, it is the feeling of pain that brings her to life.
