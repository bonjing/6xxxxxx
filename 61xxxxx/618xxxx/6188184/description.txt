IMAGiNE NOTES:
Well here we go with our v2 .....after sitting back and watching the release, i thought shame about the camera movements so we've opted to go the extra distance with this one :P What we've done is took the 720p source files and cut them up into 7-8 files, where there is camera movement... ranging from 2 secs to 20 secs and then we cropped and resized them all to match. By doing this you get max video footage possible,but AR can go a little off but not by much at all.

Heres a screen compare so you can want we mean:

Also by doing this now you can read all the subbed parts and not just the top of them...check sample ;-) And finally we've filtered slightly different on this release compared to v1. Anyway enjoy folks ....

IMAGiNE GREETS:
FLAWL3SS,ViSiON,FUSiON,Rx,SecretMyth,BirdFlu,ELEKTRI4KA and Autotron
And to all the other p2p grps past and present
