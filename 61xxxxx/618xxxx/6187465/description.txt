Cover of The Beatles' Get Back by "pro-white" rock band Battlecry with alternate anti-immigration lyrics.

These lyrics were actually written by The Beatles earlier in the Get Back development process. The melody is similar to the finished released Beatles version 

Paul McCartney et al may have meant it ironically/sarcastically, yet these guys did not.

It's very interesting to know that The Beatles wrote this; I shall not speak on my opinion of the matter.
