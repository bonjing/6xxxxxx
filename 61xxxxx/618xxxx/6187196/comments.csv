,pr0nDL,2011-02-19T22:43Z,Tnx alex for keeping us updated. Respect.

,caspianseez,2011-02-19T23:45Z,"commenting to say that this works (again).

but this is still not a TRUE crack, it's more like a temporary bypass. and this is going to be an endless cycle (update-bypass-update-bypass-etc) until someone actually creates a crack of the game .exe itself that ignores the UpLauncher.

someone needs to figure out how to stop UpLauncher from checking the game files offline. someone needs to make it so that we can start the game from TDU2.exe directly instead of having to use the Launcher."
,ponydawg,2011-02-20T02:24Z,maybe you shuold give it a try caspianseez.

sorry a group is working on something so that YOU can play the game for free.

Sorry it's not a ""proper"" crack.

Be happy you dont have to go buy the game to see if you like it or not."

Well, why dont you try to figure out the stuff the launcher passes on to the TestDrive2.exe and implement that at the execution base?
Or dont you know how to do that?

If so, please stop bitching around and be happy, like Alex said, that there actually IS a ""bypass"" ;)

@alex
Thanks mate, like the previous update, this one works like a charm!"
,martronn,2011-02-20T14:16Z,Thanks alexisthebest! this one did the trick! no more asking for serial when applied this crack
,Xray159,2011-02-20T15:52Z,"Umm....guys,I know this might sound stupid,but how do I block a file (UpLauncher.exe in this case :P) in firewall?? I've never done anything with firewalls,so I'd appreciate any help :)"
,ROM3V,2011-02-20T21:18Z,@xray159 Just search youtube and you will find some video explaining... That's waht I've done...
,caspianseez,2011-02-22T20:51Z,"@ Raventhorn

I'm not bitching.
I'm just adding my 2 cents to the discussion."
