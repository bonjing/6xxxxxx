[V],aoloffline,2011-02-19T17:57Z,"there are at least 3 titles i seen..but since at least for now this is quite a rare torrent,better let it with release name,so it would be more easy to find..in searches"
[V],-jonny-,2011-02-19T18:41Z,"Yeah, I noticed you always leave the release name untouched, which is fine I guess. But I think people are much more likely to search for the film title than the release name. Just my opinion though :)"
[V],-jonny-,2011-02-19T18:45Z,"Also, I think people are more likely to search for ""Mother"" than ""Madeo"", and ""The Illusionist"" rather than ""L'illusionniste"", as those were the titles given for their releases in English-speaking countries. Meh."
