* Hi , all the PC games and pratical files fans ...


* FILE INFO :  

I failed my fellow users of this game when i tought that certain files not included on the game didnÂ´t affected the gameplay , on the tests showed normality without beeing used making me supposing that was language files not really necessary and this files have a structure that canÂ´t be open only probably with the right tools used for the makers of the game .

The intention was the best possible size to this game like make sense to a pratical file and the fact that only after many hours of gameplay the player notice that it is something missing making him crash over and over to the desktop , i get alerted from users and my conscience said to me to analise the situation properly and doing that , respecting more as possible the users of my files and my work itself and the more carefull analysis about the not included files showed up that the HAITI files for this game was missing , this HAITI files have all the map construction and missions and things relationated with this new location and i have to say after saw him , WHAT A NEW MAP AND LOCATION ! , with many new possible areas and lot of new entertainment in competitions and gameplay and of course giving the possibility to the player really complete the game .

I know that this isnÂ´t a normal procedure even for a pratical file but thinking in taking away from the file users to have the opportunity to complete the game it wasnÂ´t a fair thing after making the correct analysis about the non-included files , of course when a pratical file is maded it is always the idea to get the best size possible keeping the gameplay more as possible but NEVER donÂ´t include this same gameplay in conscience , so i decide independtly of the size of this obrigatory  complementary file to finish the game to give the choice to the downloaders of the game , it is true that it is possible to play many hours with the  2.63 gb main file but to really finish the game this file it is needed too for 2.83 gb because the HAITI location have a big area of gameplay , in total now analising really all the game , this game file got 5.46 gb in total , only close a giga less than the iso and i have to say that this game is one of toughest pratical files i ever maded confused by the failed tests on the HAITI files and for the possible many hours of gameplay without any problem with the main file .

Thank you for understand all of you , the intention it is always to get the best size possible keeping the gameplay and on this case the available file didnÂ´t achieved that objective and not fair see the users getting this pratical file beeing downloading the complete more than 6 giga iso because found out later in the game that the game keeps crashing on the airport when go to the HAITI location .

This file is my honest excuses for this ununexpected situation on this game and sorry but the intention was really the best for a normal pratical file .


with care and respect for the users ...
