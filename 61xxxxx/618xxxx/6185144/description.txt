I had a chance to shoot a few sets with Natalie when she passed through town on her way to Seattle. The costume here reminds me of a pinup outfit, and we certainly could have done a sort of 1950s pinup style set, but we went with some of the usual Jazz Age props. Natalie made fun of my union poster.

These pictures aren't classic pinup style, but Natalie's garment lends a bit of vintage class to the proceedings.
