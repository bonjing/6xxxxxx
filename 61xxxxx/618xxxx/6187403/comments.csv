So enjoy!!!"
,jhornsten,2011-02-20T16:13Z,Havent tried it yet. but have been seeding all day (around 45gig) thx !
,jhornsten,2011-02-20T16:41Z,"when i was doing step 5 i couldnt overwrite the old MF.dll file . and right before i took ownership but still says i dont have authority to overwrite it, help ?"
,TyMod,2011-02-20T20:11Z,"@jhornsten
Okay, just rename the file as stated below, and move it to your desktop and then you can paste the crack into the folder.  You could also right click on the original MF.dll and then click take ownership again.  Then retry step 5 and if that doesn't work then do as stated above.

AND thanks for seeding! :D"
,jhornsten,2011-02-21T11:02Z,@TyMod : I done as you said and when im pressing halo2.exe it says i cant start the program cous d3dx9_31.dll is missing.. now im confused
,TyMod,2011-02-21T13:50Z,You have to install DIRECTX 9.  You must have it to play any game.  Search DirectX 9 in google search and download it/ install it.  Then play the game
,Puddy107,2011-02-22T01:31Z,Please seed! my download is going very slowly.
,TyMod,2011-02-22T01:40Z,Sorry man.  Not much you can do to speed it up.  I will ofcoarse keep seeding but the problem is you have 59 people trying to download it and only 22 people trying to get it out to people.
,Limposwe,2011-02-22T03:22Z,"I think I am having a problem taking ownership over the system32 folder, because I can't copy the cracked one and replace the original one AND I can't rename the orignal one either. What shall I do? I have windows vista."
,TyMod,2011-02-22T03:49Z,Well theres your first problem.  Windows Vista just sucks. Just kidding man but what you will need to do is goto MF.dll (The original) and click Take Ownership of it personally.  I tested this on 3 computers and had to do all these different steps on each one of them.  But it does work. So try the step above I just listed and if it doesn't work just holler back...
,Limposwe,2011-02-22T04:47Z,"Haha funny thing. It didn't worked for me, I couldn't replace mf.dll. BUT instead of screaming I did step 6 and now it works. Maybe step 5 isn't necessary for Vista users?"
,TyMod,2011-02-22T12:37Z,IT is but I did reecrack the game files lol so maybe not.  Either way I am glad it worked. :) I would still like other to do the steps before bitching at me that it didn't work thought.
,Puddy107,2011-02-22T22:14Z,Thanks M8! Campaign works perfectly.
,TyMod,2011-02-22T22:46Z,"Your welcome man. I'm glad to see someone got it to work without a hitch. lol

,Naomsj,2011-03-04T21:30Z,"I may sound as a n00b but which file do I have to open to like install Halo? Because I have 3 Halo2.exe files, on of them is a securitybrochure (:S) and the other one I can't open because it's an unvalid file and the last one is a halo2.exe.cfg file which I also can't open :S. Please help?? (Thanks for the fast upload btw!!)"
,TyMod,2011-03-04T22:29Z,"Well, I have NO idea how you got there lol but I would delete all those files and restart with the RAR file.  Download the latest WinRaR and install it and then use it to open the RAR file.  Then re-extract it.  If that doesn't work then holler back."
,dklye1,2011-03-06T04:17Z,"when i open halo2.exe, it says that xlive.dll is missing?"
,TyMod,2011-03-06T19:24Z,You didn't do step six then.  READ THE DIRECTIONS PEOPLE!!!!!
,RawringNinja,2011-03-06T21:56Z,"Okay, so, first off, this is a super special awesome download, so thanks.

Second, I followed the instructions as closely as possible, yet when I try to open Halo, it says that file d3dx9_31.dll is missing. Why?"
,TyMod,2011-03-06T22:18Z,You must install directx 9 from Microsoft.  Just look it up on their website or search for it on google.  That goes for anyone else with the same issue.
,RawringNinja,2011-03-07T13:03Z,"Thanks! It works perfectly now. You're the man, man."

,TyMod,2011-03-19T19:50Z,"Thanks man and they don't.  Especially to figure out how to crack a game and to get it to work on windows 7.  The scene releases couldn't even do that. :P

Enjoy the game!!!"
,Cephi,2011-03-20T17:55Z,"I appreciate the effort plenty, I'm just saying, it doesn't work; it still doesn't work.  I never copied mf.dll to the halo 2 folder, but just to make sure, I went through the entire process of the instructions two more times, with the same result: ""Halo 2 for windows Vista has stopped working"" everytime. Has anyone got this working on 7? Has anyone got this working who had the problem I, swordmen and viv-jen had?

Just to make sure I'm following the directions correctly: I'm interpreting ""Install Game for Windows Live and then install vcredit"" as ""run XLiveRedist1.0.6027.msi, then run vcredist.msi""; and I'm interpreting ""Just start the game"" as ""run halo2.exe"". If that's wrong, please let me know. But if that's right, then everyone should be aware that this does not work on Windows 7."
,TyMod,2011-03-20T19:36Z,"THERE IS NO XP PORT HERE. So obviously people have gotten this to work on Windows 7 since only a SMALL amount of people are dumb enough to stick to Vista.  It works on all 3 of my computer (Windows 7).

I'm sorry it doesn't work for you but it does work on Windows 7.  Why don't you re-download it and redo the instructions.

OR

You can quit bitching and go download another Halo 2 torrent... Oh wait, none of the other ones work.

Moral of this story: Quit bitching.  Re-extract the game and MAKE sure you overwrite MF.dll in the System32 folder.  If it tells you you can't even though you made sure you Took Ownership of it then restart your computer and MAKE SURE you DID NOT open WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER.  As it uses MF.dll.  Install Games for Windows Live and uninstall any other updated versions.  Yes, you can use a updated version but first, so no one bitches about it not working because you tried to activate it just use the old outdated version included in the OPEN ME FOLDER and also install VCredit.  After that start the game and make a offline account.

Okay :D"

,jonnyholb,2011-03-22T01:31Z,"Hi TyMod,
Thanks for the work that you have put into this. I have one question, as I'm new to cracked games it might seem quite stupid:  I followed all you're instructions and the game loaded fine the first time, then at the end of the first mission is says that i have to activate it to continue, am i missing something? "
,Cephi,2011-03-23T02:26Z,"I have followed the directions several times, re-extracting from the rar each time. Again, I appreciate the effort, and I'm sad to see you're unable to accept the fact that your efforts and your instructions don't work for everybody's system. I would hope and suggest, though, that you accept that just maybe the problem is not that we are worthless, whiny, ungrateful morons, and instead accept that just maybe these files and your instructions are for some reason not working on all Windows 7 systems. 

So again, to downloaders, be aware that the download appears to work on some Windows 7 systems and not others -- for reasons that neither I nor TyMod understand."
,mashupfrog,2011-03-24T10:44Z,"hello...

I'm new here and also a noob at this. I read and did the instructions as what it has said, but I get this error message popping out when I start the halo2.exe (including startup.exe startup-MCE)

the procedure entry point RegGetValueA could not be located in the dynamic link library ADVAPI32.dll.


I tried rebooting, re-extracting but the outcome is still the same.

can somebody help me with this?

,Cephi,2011-04-03T15:39Z,"""Okay for people with the game not activating right. You didn't follow the instructions correctly.""

Still no to this. I've started from scratch following the instructions to the letter several times. Judging from comments here, many people running 7 are having the same problem. If you are running 7 and when you try to start the game you get the error ""Halo 2 for Windows Vista has stopped working"", let us know if you somehow get it working -- since the uploader is apparently plugging his fingers in his ears and pretending that all the people having this problem must just be too stupid to copy a file and run a couple executables."
,TyMod,2011-04-03T18:48Z,"Okay. If you read carefully if it ask you for activation then you DID NOT follow the instructions.  I did address the app crashes in a WHOLE different paragraph.

I WILL DO IT AGAIN!

THE CRACK IS FOR 64 BIT COMPUTERS. MY FAULT. IF YOU LOOK ALL 64 BIT WINDOWS 7 USERS GET THIS TO WORK FINE. So, if you are using a 32 bit computer use the crack another user posted above.  It worked for him and I am sure it will work for you.

Thank You though. :)"

,FuRrY321,2011-04-18T22:32Z,"Hi TyMod, I followed directions thoroughly and everything, my system is a 32-bit Windows 7 Home Premium, so I used the cracked MF.dll in DarkESTZoul's link.
My problem is that, the loading screen with the HALO 2 logo works fine, but then, after the music fades and the light in the background reaches the middle a second time (coming back to the left), I get an APPCRASH. 
I've followed your instructions to the letter, unRAR'd it again, twice, and uninstalled LIVE and re-intalled it using your XLIVERedist file. 
If you could please help me, I'd really appreciate it.
By the way, do you have any idea why MF.dll was included in the unRAR'd folder? I don't mean in the OPEN THIS FIRST! folder, I mean in the Halo2 folder. I removed it so halo2.exe could start at all, but it seems weird as you keep saying to not put it in there."

Thanks anyway, though I can't say I'm happy about wasting 7-10 hours downloading something that didn't even work..."
,TyMod,2011-04-24T16:15Z,"I precracked the game.  After installing the Games for Windows Live and vcredit you could play it but it's never 100% gonna work.  If you place it in the System 32 folder it will work.  That is what the scene releases had you do but the difference is no one could get it to work on windows 7 and vista.  So I uploaded this direct play version with a crack made for the system 32 folder and a registry file that lets you take control of anything you want to.  Problem is when you place the crack on 32 bit computers I have noticed the game won't work OR windows media player will no longer work.  Both issues suck but theres no way around cracking it like I have said to unless you get Dopeman's version to run.

So make a decision on whether you will take your chances cracking the game or with Dopeman's version.  If you use an ISO you will have to crack the game just like I have you doing it so you really don't want an ISO UNLESS you have Halo 2 and loss your CD.

Hope now you understand where I am coming from.

TyMoD"
,TyMod,2011-04-24T16:20Z,"@FuRrY321 And MF.dll is suppose to be in the Halo 2 folder.  Leave it, if you took it out it will crash.

,aoo1,2011-04-27T14:33Z,"Hi...

I followed the first Five steps perfectly. But unable to install the game.

If I click on startup.exe it says ""Some important files are missing from installation directory.""

If I click on  Halo2.exe it says xlive.dll is missing from your computer.

Please help help.

PS: I'm not sure what do u mean by saying install ""games for windows live"".

I'm using Windows 7 ultimate 32-bit."
,aoo1,2011-04-27T14:40Z,"Sorry for previous comment.

I installed windows live, then vcredit.

Now when I click on Halo2.exe, it says ""Halo 2 has stopped working"".

I did all steps perfectly twice."

,aoo1,2011-04-27T15:20Z,I just noticed... Windows Media Player is also not working in my computer showing same error as halo2
,aoo1,2011-04-30T05:36Z,"What the f man, my internet explorer is corrupted as well; using system restore does not works!

I don't ever downloads rar files and you made me repent so much for downloading this one."
,TyMod,2011-04-30T15:49Z,Its not the RAR file. If you read my previous comments I explained that on 32 bit computers if the crack does NOT work it will corrupt windows media player and everything. I also stated CREATE A BACKUP OF MF.dll which I am assuming you didn't.  I will upload it in a torrent for you.  Sorry but you people people need to read my previous comments!

,TyMod,2011-04-30T17:45Z,You can try it on a 32 bit computer BUT if it doesn't work then you will have to download my fix for MF.dll because the crack will corrupt everything (if it doesn't work)

,TyMod,2011-05-01T16:13Z,I uploaded something to fix it on 32 bit computers as long as you keep the Halo 2 folder cracked.  Its up to you if you want to try it or not.  Look for the torrent by searching through my torrents.

All I did was the following:

1. Download

2. Unrar.

3. put the folder in my C:Games folder...You put where you want

4. Ran the reg file

5. took ownership and renamed the mf.dll file to mf.dl_ and copied the mf.dll file from the crack into the windows system 32 folder.

started the game using the halo2.exe file.

I""DID NOT"" repaeat ""DID NOT"" install the games for windows live and or the vcredit. and or direct x, as I had the most current on my system

Game is running just fine."

Is there a cracked MF.dll for vista 32-bit?

If you can help, thanks, if you can't, thanks anyway."
,TyMod,2011-08-01T16:55Z,Use my 32 bit crack i uploaded myself.  It is from a Windows 7 based computer so it might not work for Vista.  Paste it in the System32 folder man.  I know how you feel man.

the western digital drive i had back then died with everything on it so i only just the last month started redownloading halo2 over and over again, ive probably tried all the torrents on this site with either not working or this no working keyboard or mouse issue 

running win 7 ultimate 64bit
brand new tron keyboard and mouse (computer store by me had them on sale and they look and sound (yes sound, when the system boots up the make the rezzing sound) frigin awesome

if you can think of anything else? i went to the EB games stores in town to see if they had the game in stock but no ones carrying much pc games anymore, at least not in my area (5 eb GAMES Stores youd think one might have it for pc)

thanks for your help!"
,TyMod,2011-08-06T04:12Z,lol Your welcome.  I try to help people who do there part.  Update the drivers like I said and DirectX and if that doesnt work then I will see if I can find a fix.  Your system specs are great though man.  So nothing to worry about there. Do you have the latest Catalyst driver for your ATI card? Catalyst version 11.8.

forgot i needed that damn cataLYST, was so shocked upgrading from XP to win7 uhh like february how much better it was and faster! then one day im installing windows 7 on my buddys system (ultimate) and ran across the option for 32 bit or 64 bit... when i hit 64 bit i saw a menu i didnt recognize at all.... which is odd... checked my system properties and nearly shit a brick when i was 32 bit listed... reinstalled all that night hahah
even faster now! and uses all my ram now! WAHOO!"

no but seriously.. mouse just flickers when i move it cursor stays put, hitting buttons doesnt do anything.. praying hasnt helped... threats to the pc/keyboard/mouse have also yielded no results as well....

,TyMod,2011-08-06T04:54Z,lol i got 64 bit windows 7 to and a AMD Radeon graphics card :) FTW Love it. The Catalyst 11.8 driver will let you scale your display settings so if the card is either displaying a image larger or smaller then your display it will let you manualy scale it to your screen settings.  I do it on my flat screen when I play this or Mass Effect. :)
,TyMod,2011-08-06T06:57Z,I'm sorry man.  Look the issue up on google. I look and see what I can find.  No one else has had this issue. Someone could had seeded you faulty data which currupted the game.  Try downloading it over night. If it STILL doesn't work then let me know and I will tell you what I find.
,de350z,2011-08-06T09:59Z,"It crashed just before the first campaign....

I downloaded this one coz the last halo 2 i played on xp i suspect was incomplete.. the game stops after a certain stage. when the masterchief falls into a pit and talks with that giant covenant thing.. and then after the cut scene nothing happened.

so i downloaded this one to see if theres something more after that. 

I now have win 7 ultimate x86

but the game crashes.. :(

help? "
,de350z,2011-08-06T10:17Z,"Okay.. i just checked the previous game stopped after the gravemind stage... and there are still lots of levels to play after that..

i really want this version to work.. help please."

amazon has it for 15 bucks might just go there

also ive donwloaded this torrent three times now to see if that was the cause as well.. still no  luck :("
,TyMod,2011-08-06T15:27Z,"I'm sorry man. Idk what to say.

de350z look through my torrents and download the crack fix. IF the seeds are gone ill  give you an alternate link."
,TyMod,2011-08-07T00:51Z,"For those wanting to download this so they can play online.

TBH the game has gone WAY down hill online. Hardly ANYONE plays an the servers lag like hell.  IF people are playing on a custom map and you dont join the lobby before it starts then you can't play in that game.  Apperantly in the lobby it predownloads the map before the party leader can start the game.  Don't believe me I will show you a vid or screen shot of it."
,de350z,2011-08-07T12:41Z,yes no seeders for the crack fix.... :(

,Masterchiief,2011-08-09T16:28Z,"Hello !

Firstly, thanks for the game :D
I've got just one problem : the game works perfectly, but during the loading of the last level (i guess in English, it's ""the Great Journey"" ?), the game stops and windows tells me ""Halo 2 stops working"" ...
I've got Windows 7 64 bits :)
Maybe an idea to resolve that ? :)
thank you :)"

But when I try to install the vcredit I don't think it really installs, it just runs something and a pop up shows saying ""Please wait while microsoft configures c++"" or something.  I'm sorry that I can't follow simple instructions but idk what to do! Please help! (I am running Windows 7 btw)"

To any one posting issues.  Please list system specs.  It helps when it comes to finding out if your issue is caused by your computer or the release.

I'm kind of having the same issue as Filamericano, I try to run the vcredit installer, and it seems to be working for a few sec, and then it just shuts down without saying anything else. I ran it as an administrator, but same thing keeps on happening.

When I try to launch the game using the halo2.exe, it keeps on nagging me about Directx9 (I've got Directx10) and if I try to run the startup.exe, it just says that some files in the installation folder are damaged."

,artikal1,2011-08-13T22:40Z,"@ sonvicky its a graphic driver issue, you need to have the directX9 drivers installed for you game to work."

Is there a solution to this or should I start over? ...and how do i start over? remove the registry thing?"
,TyMod,2011-08-31T22:14Z,"Dude, read comments please.  Thats a DirectX error.  It means you do not have up-to-date drivers and a updated DirectX if you have DirectX at all.  DirectX is required to play all games so I have no idea how you have been playing any other game.  At that point, download DirectX 9, 10, or 11, doesn't matter which, just make sure your card supports it.  That will fix your error.

LOOK UP ERRORS ON GOOGLE FIRST. DIRECTX IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD DIRECTLY FROM MICROSOFT.

Thanks,

And the weird thing is that i have never installed any games which required LIVE gaming before.
And i searched google, did the catroot folder thing, and some copying of oem files thing, but its still the same message. im using win7 home edition, could that be a potential cause for problems?"
,TyMod,2011-09-01T13:15Z,"Thats a different error all together.  Its from not restarting your computer after uninstalling other versions of games for windows live and then installing mine.  If you have a up-to-date games for windows live just leave it and start playing Halo 2.  For ppl with the Games for Windows Live could not initiate, uninstall it, restart your computer, download the latest version (3.5) and then install it.  Restart the computer, make sure the games cracked and start playing.  Done.  Simple enough. 

@cstaff18 and yes it is a little stupid of you not to have DirectX since it is a requirement for ANY game to ever begin to run on your computer.  I'm sorry I was being a dick man but idk how you played other games on your computer.  and the error you are getting now has nothing to do with DirectX.  It might be due to the fact you have a Intel graphics card.  Halo 2 doesn't support them.  I got it to run on one of my computers that does have a Intel integrated chip set but it was horrble.  To enjoy the game on high settings and in HD you need a better card. You can play it on low with a low res but it looks no different then the xbox version so if I were you I would consider getting either a better graphics card if you have a desktop or just playing it on the Xbox if you have a laptop.

TyMoD"
,TyMod,2011-09-01T13:23Z,"And yes, Windows 7 causes the erro because the original Halo 2 for Vista Games for Windows Live was specifically for Vista, the shittiest operatings system of all times with no backwards capibility.  Thats why I am saying just go ahead and uninstall it, install the latest version which works on them all and make a offlin account.  If you need to know how to make a offline account I will upload a pc of where you can find it.  Also, on youtube you can find game keys.   Use specifically Halo 2 keys as Halo 2 had a special ""Activation Key"" other games did not have.  Plug it in when in game and let the game update.  BAM, you now have LIVE!!!

There is some extra bang for the buck. lol  I will post a few keys for you guys for the trouble.  I'm sorry, seriously.

TyMoD"
,saywut,2011-09-01T14:39Z,"Ok, after fiddling with more stuff it seems to work now, thanks a lot man!

When i created an offline account they didnt ask me for any product key though, are they going to ambush me at certain stages for it or something? o.O And this is the first halo2 torrent that has ever worked for me, thanks a million xD"
,TyMod,2011-09-02T02:47Z,"Welcome and no.  If you try to go online though it will ask for a Live Enabler key which can be found on youtube. lol Believer it or not but that's how I got my key.  I aquired the game from one of the disc images uped on here.  

Anyways glad it worked man.  I love Halo 2 and glad to see people still playing it.  The community is pretty dead though so it would be nice if you guys would PLEASE activate the game and play online though.  The commmunitys just flatout dead and needs players.

Overall, glad it worked and sorry about my ranting.

also, i was havin sum truble with step 5. the game just wudnt start. so instead, i copied my system32 mf.dll to the halo 2 folder, rather than vice versa, n it worked fine. (just in case others have the same prob)"

Trying using the Startup.exe instead of the Halo2.exe and it gives me a message saying that necessary documents in the install folder are missing or corrupted. Any idea what I did wrong ?
,killahxinstinct,2011-09-05T02:14Z,"Alright i have had legit Halo 2 code .. like forever!
Lost the CD so i got this. I put the code in to activate it for live , and it works.. however it tells me i need to update it from XLive.. i click to update , it looks like its downloading some files or somethin then the game just closes and appears nothin happens. i load it back up , enter the key.. then the same message for downloading the update shows and basically everything repeats itself! i kno the community is probably dead by now lol , but i would still like to go online.. any idea ?"
,TyMod,2011-09-05T04:43Z,"The community is dead but if you are going to lay on then maybe you can play with me. :P You need to take the crack out.  Since the crack is loaded in both the System32 folder and the Halo 2 folder.  I will upload the Halo 2 MF.dll (Original) for you. 

@rafaelbg1980 You didnt read the comments and so ofcoarse it will not work.  Please read the torrent comments and follow some of the instructions users and I posted in the comments.  If you had of read the comments then you would know the crack that came with this torrent will not work with 32 Bit computers.  You have to download my crack fix or find a 32 bit MF.dll online."

,TyMod,2011-09-12T03:04Z,Never heard of that issue before man.  I don't team view with strangers so sorry man.  You got a kick ass graphics card so IDK why.  Is antialiasing turned on? It can cause the games speed to fluctuate.  I go anywhere from 20 to 60 frames just from having antialiasing x4 on.  So try that and look on google for a fix.  If nothing works let me know and I will look further into it.

So for those with Windows 7 who are receiving the Windows Games Live error that states an instance of it is already running, download the latest version (http://www.freewarefiles.com/Microsoft-Games-For-Windows-LIVE_program_35222.html), install, restart the computer, & Halo 2 should start right up. Be sure to only click the launcher once, the first time it will take a little bit for the game to warm up."

,greatgriz,2011-09-12T12:18Z,anti alias did nothing. i really need to play this game brings back the days
,TyMod,2011-09-12T13:44Z,"Same.  I'm sorry.   Let me look on google then and check it out.  I'm sure, (from your PC specs) you have your drivers up to date.  If not try that.  Also update Games for Windows Live. And I will let you know what I find out."
,TyMod,2011-09-12T13:56Z,"The biggest thing that came up was Nvidia drivers causing the game to run sluggish.  Not just Halo 2 though.  Alot of games.  Also, from what it sounds like when you said it runs ""fast and slow"" is that the game is either studdering or going from a good framerate to low frame drops which is an issue ALL games for windows live games have and many times can never be fixed. :( Gears of War is like that and is problebly the worst.  If thats the case than all you can do is restart your computer.  Maybe clean it out and hope it stops.  Please clarify a little more.  Sorry but ""the game speed alternates between fast and slow it is never perfect speed"" doesn't give me much of a idea on whats going on."
,greatgriz,2011-09-12T22:24Z,ok i tried to fraps my problem but when i start recording the game runs perfect but when i stop it fucks up again?? all my drivers are good
,TyMod,2011-09-12T23:56Z,"Hmm, wth lol Thats odd. With my computer FRAPS fucks everything up...  It makes the game studder so idk man.  Alot of different ""fixes"" for the issue.

,TyMod,2011-09-13T05:20Z,The game was never updated.  I'm sure people playing on tunggle updated the game.  I didn't think about that.  You can get a key on youtube.  Here are a few.  Apply the key in game AFTER taking out the crack.  You will need to download the original MF.dll for the Halo 2 folder online.  Heres a key: WKWK2-6DB9T-74RRF-9GJVJ-QY9W6Y MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOLD ACCOUNT TO PLAY ONLINE. Your welcome.

,devingod,2011-09-15T08:43Z,"Downloaded, but I'm a little apprehensive about making any changes to the System32 folder.  Will replacing mf.dll inhibit or change any computer functions in the future?"
,TyMod,2011-09-15T19:11Z,"Well, on 64 Bit computers... sorta.  It will make it so you cant edit MP3 data.  Blame Razor1911 for that.  Thats it though. It will still play songs and vids but you cant edit the info with windows.  iTunes and stuff still works 100%.

On 32 Bit computers.  DO NOT PLACE IT!!!!  It will corrupt Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer.  You can download my crack fix which will make Halo 2 work and it won't corrupt anything on your computer.

So its up to you.  I recommend making a backup of the original MF.dll and the placing the crack.  Playing the game.  And when you are done replace the crack with the original again.

If you dont want to do any of that stuff then just skip that part of the instructions, play the game and see if it will let you get past the 1st level.  It might, it might not.  Its luck at that point.

So do what you want.  But don't complain if it doesn't work if you don't place the crack."
,NaNo212,2011-09-16T03:45Z,how do i get the product key?

I tried to get 'lucky,' and start the game without placing the crack, but when I tried to start Halo 2 I get a message saying LIVE Gaming on Windows failed to initialize.  I'm guessing the crack is not the problem here and the only version of Games for Windows Live I have installed is the one you posted.  How can I get around this?"
,TyMod,2011-09-16T13:13Z,"Install the latest Games for Windows Live after you uninstall the one I posted and I'm glad to help.

I will repost the key: WKWK2-6DB9T-74RRF-9GJVJ-QY9W6 Start the game, try to log in to Games for Windows Live with your Live Gold account and then it will update and BAM, all done.  Make sure you take the crack out of the System32 folder and that you place the original MF.dll.

,raisin990,2011-09-26T16:46Z,Hello TyMod could I have a key please? My email is ikorose at gmail dot com. Thanks so much!
,takashi8525,2011-09-26T17:54Z,i fixed the problem i'm using windows 7 but it runs now :D but if you dont mind could email me a key at googledude4565@yahoo.com please?
,Link2692,2011-09-26T21:05Z,"Hey TyMod, im currently downloading this and i've read through alot of the comments, it seems people are in need of a Cd Key O.O; well, if it doesnt come with one i guess anyone downloading this will need one, my email is Some1WhoPwns@hotmail.com :) id like to keep this torrent alive as well lol"
,TyMod,2011-09-26T22:32Z,"You dont have to have one to play it.  People just want one.   Luckily I can get anybody who wants one one but... it takes a awhile to get the keys and I cant keep giving you mine (i hate doing the process to get them.) so to all who want keys I will get them for you this weekend.  I am too busy getting people who already have a key to get the game up and running online (crack issues).

Please understand this, im sorry, I will get everyone a key this weekend.  Be patient.

Thanks..."
,takashi8525,2011-09-26T22:37Z,"i can wait till this weekend that aint no problem for me,and i dont want one i need one,everytime i start up the game i hit activate later just to do the first campaign level but when i try to sign on it asks for the key again and doesnt let me into the game"
,TyMod,2011-09-26T23:55Z,"You have to make a offline account first, second you didnt paste the crack into the system32 folder. (I'm assuming you have a 64 bit system.) If not then I will email you special instructions."
,takashi8525,2011-09-27T00:23Z,"i have a a 32 bit system,i'll try again pasting the cack in the folder but i believe thats where i messed up was missing on the offline account,i'll try that and let you know than"
,takashi8525,2011-09-27T00:34Z,it worked man thanks :D but how come it wont let me play on LAN?
,TyMod,2011-09-27T00:48Z,yeah and DO NOT PASTE THE CRACK!!! It will jack your system up.  Its for 64 Bit computers only.  But making a offline account will work just fine.
,takashi8525,2011-09-27T00:50Z,"i'm playing campiagn as of for now but why dont the  local part of the game work,it wont even let me choose that option"
,TyMod,2011-09-27T03:26Z,"I'm not sure.  I was able to get it to run on lan.  I will get a key this weekend and you can do whatever the hell you want lol so just wait till then,"
,takashi8525,2011-09-27T17:30Z,lol ight that sounds good with me dude

,TyMod,2011-09-29T02:57Z,"its fine and it is in C:\Windows\System32

Just copy the link and paste it in the folder directory."
,The4BR,2011-09-30T07:46Z,"Hey TyMod thx a lot for the torrent, could you please send me a code at The4BR@gmail.com or send me the directions on how to get a code. The offline account works perfectly but the best thing about halo is multiplayer."
,takashi8525,2011-10-02T16:40Z,"for the people that dont have a gold account for windows live just download the latest tunngle version along with teknogods.dll the dll loader and teknogods helper when in the game go to settings network connection select tunngle hit the home button and make sure you have a tunggle override exit out to the desktop start teknogods helper if you wanna join a game than hit client if you wanna be the host click on host when your in the game lobby for joining a game hit f12 and you should hear ""working"" if you hear that than click on the game and when in the pregame or the game is loading hit f12 again and you should hear ""transfer complete"" after that it should work fine for you :D"
,jdparmel,2011-10-02T23:40Z,"Hey TyMod, I may have just messed up one of the instructions but maybe you could help me track down what the problem is. I moved the MF.dll into the system32 folder, ran the registry and installed Games for Windows Live. The problem is, I can't get  passed that Games for Windows Live screen that comes down so I can't make an offline account. "
,takashi8525,2011-10-04T17:19Z,this isnt tymod but i can help you out with the windows live offline account all you need to do is when your able to scroll down after you hit next the first time just scroll down and a highlight should say you can make an offline account...click there
,TyMod,2011-10-04T23:15Z,"To all who have keys.  I havnt forgotten about you lol  I am still working on a fix.  Just real busy with school and a special game RIP I am working on sooooo this weekend I will specifically make a fix for you.

To all who want keys.  Email me at TyMoDgames@gmail.com

ONLY LEAVE ME YOUR NAME AND EMAIL.  IF YOU SPAM OR ADD ANYTHING ELSE I WILL NOT SEND YOU A KEY.

Hope you understand.

Goodbye...."
,TyMod,2011-10-13T23:05Z,"To all the people who emailed me for keys.  I am sorry for the wait.  The game won't update after activating it making it needless for a key anyways so I have been working a REG file to get it to update correctly.  I have a REG fix almost complete.  Just testing it.  I will up it as soon as I fully test it and get enough keys for all the people who requested them (ALOT lol) so just be patient.  I promise that I will get you a key and fix this weekend though or atleast let you know the alternative.

Thanks for yourr patience.  Just one more day and we will be kicking each others ass lol"
,Khaydri,2011-10-16T14:14Z,"I'm having some problems, Ty. Think you might be able to help me out in e-mails if I can tell you play-by-play of what's going on? It's so far with the XLive and the Taking Ownership of Sys32"

Thanks and enjoy the game.  Hope to see you on Halo 2.

PS: My gamertags not TyMoD."
,DerangedPuppy,2011-10-29T04:58Z,"First of all thanks for the upload. I followed the instructions carefully but the game doesn't launch. No black screen or error messages or anything. I noticed that the game begins to appear on task manager---> processes but after 2-3 seconds it disappears every time. The vcredist thingy doesn't install so i installed latest versions, 2008 and 2010 but still nothing. I have windows 7 64-bit with requirements that should be able to run it( i7, gefore gt525m). Am i missing anything? any suggestions?"
,TyMod,2011-10-29T14:21Z,Did you install a updated Games for Windows Live. That is where I would start.  And then make sure you didn't overwrite the MF.dll in the Halo 2 folder.  The only other thing I could think of is not everything getting extracted.
,Ridjeck,2011-10-30T22:21Z,"The game crashes after about 30seconds -1min of being open, any suggestions :? (Win7x32)"
,SoulMaster1109,2011-10-31T02:05Z,"I have a problem starting the game. whenever I use the halo2.exe file, I get a message saying something about LIVE Gaming failing to initialize and something about a dedicated server already running.

I have a Windows 7 64-bit computer, and I followed your instructions: I put the mf.dll file in System 32, and I downloaded the two files in the crack folder. 

Am I doing something wrong?"
,SoulMaster1109,2011-10-31T02:43Z,"Okay, I manged to fix my previous problem, but now I have a new one.

The thing updates every time I log into my profile. When its done updating, Halo 2 exits out without restarting.

I also lost my original mf.dll file. Do you know a way to get it back?

,TyMod,2011-11-14T13:05Z,"IF YOU go through the comments you would see you have to downoad and install the newest version of it.  Uninstall all versions of Games for Windows Live and download the newest version, install it, and enjoy the game. :)"
,Spar117,2011-11-15T04:00Z,thanks Ty the game is working now but still having a problem its asking me  for a serial key. 
,Spar117,2011-11-15T04:00Z,could you send me a link to some serials
,Spar117,2011-11-15T19:30Z,ok I got a key product key that works but when after enter the key and it downloads my windows live ID it message box pops up saying the game needs to up date and if i don't update it wil log out my windows ID. When i try to update the game it the game just closes.
,bustaspinna,2011-11-20T20:44Z,"Thank you TyMod for this great torrent, works great and you don't have to worry about those pesky ISO mount bullshit torrents that take about 2 hours to even do. I am running on Vista, with 1GB ram and it runs smooth. Now only one question Ty, do you know anywhere I can find a product ID? I would love to play this online, like the good days when Microsoft didn't suck so much ass. "
,TyMod,2011-11-22T06:01Z,"Youtube is the best place to look man.  They have Product ID keys on there and vids to explain how to get them reactivated (you will have to call Microsoft)

Bad thing is no one plays and they just took the servers offline so now its user games only."
,DraconSable,2011-11-23T11:19Z,"Wonderful!
We are all very grateful for this torrent Tymod, thank you very much.

It's a shame they took the servers down, what are these user games you mentioned?"
,lembird94,2011-11-24T02:21Z,"Hey TyMod! i want to start off by saying i love your uploads, they all work great! :) just throwing that out there... so now i have a question. i can installl the game fine and everything, but when i go to play up pops the windows live thing, and i have an account on there already. (from one of your other torrents) so i log in and all, but it wont let me play because i dont have a product key. any suggestions?"

,TyMod,2011-11-24T03:31Z,"no.  You should just use the cracks included with this torrent, create a offline profile, and play the game if you just want to play the campaign offline.  You do not need a key or a online Xbox Live account (Games for Windows Live accout).  Just follow the instructions included on how to place the crack and play the game.

Also I'm glad people like/enjoy what I up.  I will up more games soon.  Just so busy with the holidays."

So next time read comments because it would of saved you time.

UNINSTALL Games for Windows Live
Download the latest version from Microsoft...
Install
Play

Next time you have a question look through the comments before whining about it not working."
,silentash94,2011-11-24T05:56Z,"Oh... wow sorry about that, thanks for the game though (sorry for the double post too my internet is running really slow today -.-;)"
,Aftershok,2011-11-24T06:29Z,"This is a great upload, but I think you may have to be a bit more explicit in the instructions. Sifting through the comments is very confusing, especially when you give one possible fix and then later go on to contradict yourself somewhat.

My problem is that I followed your instructions explicitly and then installed the latest version of Games for Windows Live (which is now called Microsoft Games for Windows Marketplace?). However, upon starting the game, there was absolutely no option to make an offline account. Am I missing something? The only options were to sign in using an existing account or make a new account. There was no online option. Can you post a finalized, single, entirely inclusive set of instructions in the comments? Installing the latest Windows Games client forces me to input an activation code."
,TyMod,2011-11-24T17:42Z,"Look up a youtube vid on how to do it.  Basically when it ask you to sign in hit cancel and then hit the Home key.  Scroll to the bottem of the text and in small writing it will say offline account.

I'm pretty sure thats what you will need to do.  Otherwise just look up a youtube vid."
,Aftershok,2011-11-25T04:49Z,"I appreciate your support, but no such option exists to use an offline account for the newest version of Games for Windows Live. Perhaps you are referencing an older version of the platform? The home button is always grayed out in the version I'm using, and the first screen I am presented with when I press a key on the ""Press any key"" screen gives me the binary choice of using an existing account or making a new one. No option exists to use an offline account in either of those choices, from what I can see."
,TyMod,2011-11-25T23:25Z,"It does exist.  LOOK UP A YOUTUBE VIDEO or, which I am pretty sure you need to do anyways, is hit make a new account and don't try to connect to Xbox Live.  (It won't even try to connect you to live anyways.)"
,lembird94,2011-11-29T07:47Z,"hey TyMod, its me again. so in step 4 you say to:4. Goto C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Windows and right click on the System32 folder
and click Take Ownership. so where do i find this folder?"
,TyMod,2011-11-29T13:07Z,"go to My Computer, select your defaulty hard drive, than windows and then highlight the System32 folder which is inside the windows folder. Then take ownership.

It was a Pirate Bay error caused the C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
If this comes out right this is what I was trying to say:

C:\Windows\ and then HIGHLIGHT System32 folder."
,ProjectXI,2011-12-01T06:24Z,"Thx TyMod game works fine. Is it possible to play it in widescreen? if so, how? Halo 1 has option for wide screen but 2 doesn't :(  seems abit stupid on the developers side of things"
,TyMod,2011-12-01T22:08Z,"It will only allow 1280x720 and up for widescreen (really stupid since my laptop monitor has a native res of 1366x768).  It also supports 1080p.  If you are running it in one of these settings and it won't go into widescreen than idk what to tell you.  If you are trying to run it in another resolution other than 720p and 1080p in widescreen, you can't.  If it isn't showing 720p or 1080p than look for a forum discussing the issue.  Most likely there is nothing you can do.

Sorry man,  all I can tell you/help you with.  Halo 2 was a decent port when it came to the controls feeling native and not ported but the choice of using mainly 4:3 resolutions and only 720p and 1080p for widescreen (16:9) resolutions really made it suck."
,Deog,2011-12-02T10:21Z,"This app is nothing but a headach.I installed your update crap also,an it wont start.I just want to play the campain..Direct Play?????NOT."
,TyMod,2011-12-02T13:06Z,"Yeah,  You don't have to install any of the Halo 2 updates.  That is for people tryingt o play online. I will give you some detailed instructions.

1. Download and install latest Games for Windows Live.
2. Extract the game.
3. Install the registry file RUN THIS FIRST.reg
4 Goto C:\Windows and highlight the System32 folder.  Right click and hit Take Ownership.
5. copy the cracked MF.dll and paste it over the oringinal MF.dll in the System32 folder.  If it won't let you rename the original MF.dll to MF_Backup.dll.  (You want to do this anyways so when you beat halo 2 you can get rid of the crack.)
6. Install the vcredit.msi in the folder.
7. Run the game.

Now what? You say dont update windows live or it wont work,But you also say get the newest windows live,isnt that the same as updating it? What am I missing?"

,Killer3474,2011-12-03T12:41Z,I got to the end of the directions and started the game when it said something about the dedicated server running on the same device and that reinstalling it might help. What should I do? I don't want to go through this crap again...
,Deog,2011-12-03T20:48Z,"Hay Killer wellcome abord . Direct Play,I thought that ment, Install and play,But it is far from it.As you are about to discover..Good luck I been trying to get this to run for at least 3 days. Im gonna reinstall windows just to see what happends."
,Killer3474,2011-12-03T21:15Z,"Deog, as it turns out, I was missing Windows Live all together! So I reinstalled it and it finally worked. So yeah reinstall WL and see if it works. But what I'm now trying to figure out is how come my Xbox 360 controller glitches out and decides that ""Ima swap the two triggers with the right and left button."" If I can't fix the controller problem I'll have to use the controller via Xpadder to convert it's buttons and sticks into keybord and mouse strokes."
,Deog,2011-12-03T22:37Z,"Killer,what system are you using? Im trying to do it with Win7-64.Happy that ya got something running.What Winlive are you using & were did you get it?"
,TyMod,2011-12-04T06:16Z,"Dude, you must of either uploaded it or someone took my KEY/UPDATE fix and my torrent and uploaded it.  The damn game works if you follow my instructions.  As the guy said,  REINSTALL WINDOWS LIVE.  If you use the old version it will not work because of Windows 7.  Dopemans torrent doesn't work because you are missing the crack.

I can't make it just ""extract and play, this works for all the fucking noobs"" because the crack must be applied to the system32 folder.  And again I will post new instructions.  Lets see if anyone can follow them:

1. Download and install latest Games for Windows Live.
 2. Extract the game.
 3. Install the registry file RUN THIS FIRST.reg
 4 Goto C:\Windows and highlight the System32 folder. Right click and hit Take Ownership.
 5. copy the cracked MF.dll and paste it over the oringinal MF.dll in the System32 folder. If it won't let you rename the original MF.dll to MF_Backup.dll. (You want to do this anyways so when you beat halo 2 you can get rid of the crack.)
 6. Install the vcredit.msi in the folder.
 7. Run the game.


If you don't install latest Games for Windows Live you will most likely get the ""Dedicated server is already running"" shit.  If you get this in anyway simply uninstalling and reinstalling Games for Windows Live will fix this.


AGAIN: FOR ILLITERATE PEOPLE: DO NOT INSTALL THE GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE INSTALLER WITH THIS TORRENT.  IF YOU DO YOU MUST UNINSTALL IT FIRST.  THEN GOTO GOOGLE, SEARCH FOR GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE AND DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VERSION FROM MICROSOFT.COM  "
,Deog,2011-12-04T06:59Z,"OK Ty.It WORKS,This is what I had to do.I had to reinstall Win 7-64..After I did that ,I installed your app just like I was befor just like you said.The only thing I changed was,I didnt install all of the windows updates for 7-64..Im gonna install the rest of them now hopefulley it will still work.For folks having Big trouble like I was,Mabe they should reinstall also ,it worked for me.There is nothing wrong with your instructions..

Games For Windows

And if you are running on Windows 7 64bit it might go into 32bit during the game, but it will revert back to 64bit when you exit Halo 2, so don't panic. And please don't crank yank TyMod too much about shit that don't work cause you didn't read the directions right, he looks like he's about ready to pop a blood vessel. Just go over the directions a bit to make sure you got everything right and fiddle with it a little. Don't expect this to be a simple procedure, it took me a couple hours to do it. Goodluck!"

,TyMod,2011-12-06T22:09Z,"@Killer3474 THANK YOU.  My god people are just lazy and iliterate at times.

The procedures are not easy because the game was not easy to crack.  Hell Razor was the only group to crack it and the crack has to be specifically placed in the System32 folder.  If it wasn't for the ""Direct Play"" you couldn't play the game anyways because instaling Halo 2 off of the disc and cracking it is practically impossible (because to install the game off the disc the game will have to use the System32 folder MF.dll which will render it impossible to overwrite.)

@gipro1
Run the registry file as an admin and when you right click the system32 folder you don't see ""Take Ownership"" because you didn't install the registry file (that is the whole point of the damn registry file (RUN THIS FIRST.reg)).   If you are running Windows XP you also need to stop what your doing as this torrent is for Windows Vista and Windows 7.

@xemotion  UNINSTALL ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS LIVE MARKETPLACE/GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE.  Restart your computer.  Install the latest Games for Windows Live from the link posted by Killer3474 and then restart your computer again.  Replace the crack in the System32 folder again to make sure it is cracked.  Run the game and make sure you have an offline account.  If you try to go online then it will ask you to activate it."
,Deog,2011-12-07T05:43Z,"I read back in the comments that some folks were wondering about wide screen and controller stuff.I have a 28in HannsG at 1900x1200.the Game runs great on it with a keeboard & mouse.Someone wanted to know about trainers working with Tys Game,The best one that works and gives you duel weild with no over heat,is dRoLLe 1.0.0.11081.get it at Game W. If you half to UNinstal GFWL you might run into problems getting it all out,I had to reinstall windows to get it all out. that was after using reg cleaners and deleting everything I could find.GFWL is what controlls the game starting.Once you get that in rite, It will run.Install the game in order 1,2,3 ect. It will be worth it."
,TyMod,2011-12-08T03:44Z,Thanks Deog.  Your monitor is in a 16:10 format which the game seems to like more than 16:9.  4:3 is what is recommended though.  You don't have to reinstall windows and I am sorry you went through the hassle.  The biggest thing is restarting your computer after uninstalling it and making sure the marketplace is uninstalled (though installed all at once it seems you have to uninstall them seperatly.)
,Killer3474,2011-12-08T06:25Z,"For anybody that doesn't know:

Direct Play Edition
Def.- The edition that DOES NOT require a key to play.

So yeah, just follow the directions slowly and carefully if you can't get it to work.

Here's the things I took note of when I installed Halo 2 DP (At least from what I can remember):

-Do not ignore the ""OPEN ME FIRST"" folder, it has a reason.
-When you right click the ""System32"" folder and press ""Take Ownership"", it will open up a command window with a shit load of crap running down the screen at the speed of light. Just wait for it to finish, you'll know cause it will CLOSE ITSELF when it's done.
-When you get to ""Paste the Crack!"" you are suppose to paste it in the ""System32"" folder."
,Killer3474,2011-12-08T06:35Z,"More notes that I just remembered:

-When I went to create an offline account for GFWL I recall it having a little itty bitty link that says something like ""Create an offline account"" in the corner. It initially looks like you're signing up for an online account, so watch for that link!
"
,Killer3474,2011-12-08T06:42Z,"It just occurred to me, perhaps a YouTube video showing the exact procedure with commentary will shut everybody up. If you can TyMod (or if anybody can), it would be fantastic if you posted a video like that here."
,gipro1,2011-12-09T00:59Z,"I have campaign working, great game. Thanks. 

One questions about one problem. 

1) My system specs are damn well over the recommended specs for Halo2 and yet the game is choppy and slower when walking with full graphics, I should be able to do full graphics without a problem. Why can't I? Is there a way to fix this problem?? "
,gipro1,2011-12-09T02:39Z,"Playing with my settings a bit, its even choppy on lowest graphics when there's a lot of things happening in the map. "
,TyMod,2011-12-09T03:38Z,I know how you feel.  I can get it to run at a steady 30 fps to 60 but it never works right man.  The games just naturally choopy and wasnt very well optimized.
,Killer3474,2011-12-09T06:31Z,"Choppy? It wasn't choppy at all for me (at least nothing that frustrating). What's your specs? Mine is a Toshiba Satellite i5 (equivalent to a X4) with the standard HD stock video card.

Also, is it choppy in campaign or multiplayer? "
,gipro1,2011-12-09T07:18Z,"Haven't tried getting multiplayer to work yet. I tried running it on max and its really choppy just moving, currently I have it on lowest and it still chops when large bursts of commotion are happening around me.

,gipro1,2011-12-10T01:18Z,"I just beat the campaign and I its the best video campaign I've ever played.

I couldn't find any instructions in the comments on how to get multiplayer working, could you post some? Or if you already did could you tell me what comments page their on, or repost them? "
,TyMod,2011-12-10T02:57Z,I uploaded a multiplayer fix not to far ago.  I am not helping people with it but a user posted a comment on how to get it to work.  Please look in my torrents for it.  Remember I am not suporting it anymore.
,TyMod,2011-12-10T04:31Z,"@Killer3474 I can play it pretty smooth but every now and then whe I start the game it is real choopy.  The biggest thing is putting my computer in hibernation or playing a game for awhile and a memory leak occuring causimg my RAM to reach it's max.

To anybody having a problem with choppiness and knows there system is well above the system requirements needs to restart there computer."
,TyMod,2011-12-10T17:57Z,"@ANY ONE WANTING ME TO DO MASS EFFECT 2.

I will do it if and only if I get 50 people to request it.  And this offer is only good until next weekend.  If I get 50 Request for Mass Effect 2 I will upload it on Sunday of next weekend.  Quite a few people have requested it but last time I did it it seemed no one would seed so this is the only way I know I will get seeds."
,blubace,2011-12-10T22:30Z,"Works great. Just make sure since its a old engine to force v-sync, higher AA, AF and you should be fine. And for all the people who can't get it to work make sure you use the reg files, and copy the proper files where they need to be. 10/10"
,TyMod,2011-12-10T23:55Z,"Your quite welcome.  Nice to see people are getting it to work.  And forced VSync is highly recommended.  

@people wanting to play online
There were a total of maybe 50 people on the game earlier today so the communities dying.  Don't buy the game.  If you want to play online download my multiplayer crack.  Try to get it working.  If you don't follow instructions correctly though it WILL NOT WORK.  Someone posted on there how to get it working so look through the comments. I do not support that torrent."

,TyMod,2011-12-11T14:49Z,"There isn't a launcher to start the game.

If you get the message ""xlive.dll"" is missing then you need to download Games for Windows Live from the Microsoft website and install it.

@manuel3272001
Are you trying to run it from the RAR file.  If so then I doubt it will work.  And you need to right click on it.  Goto properties.  Goto the compatibility tab and select run as admin and run in compatibility mode."
,manuel3272001,2011-12-11T20:48Z,it keeps saying C:\Windows\TEMP\IXP000.TMP\ is not available
,TyMod,2011-12-11T22:17Z,What version of windows are you running and is it 64x or 86x (32 bit)

,TyMod,2011-12-12T02:44Z,"install the latest games for windows live installer from microsoft.com

and it is what will make the game work but dont use that version"

,TyMod,2011-12-13T13:04Z,"Yep.  I got 4 gigs too.

I am uploading a Gears torrent later today.  It will work online (providing you follow my tutorial.)"
,Killer3474,2011-12-15T00:27Z,"I've been meaning to ask this for a while, what is the ""C++ 2005"" for (I think I saw it in the crack folder)?"
,TyMod,2011-12-15T00:50Z,"It is required for the game.  When you install it it actually has halo 2 written somwhere on it.  To run any game now you practically have to have C++, Basic and C+ updated."
,manuel3272001,2011-12-15T00:51Z,how do i find out what version im running?
,TyMod,2011-12-15T00:54Z,"And about the Gears torrent. I am currently compiling the disc.  I accidently made 250kb files instead of 250MB files when packing the game so now there is a total of 23,000 files lol so PowerISO is taking its time with creating the disc image.  Once it is done I am going to do a final test and see if it will run from a disc and then I will upload it :)

Shout out to Lembird94 who requested the torrent.  YOU BETTER SEED MOTHER FUCKER lol.

And Killer3474
if you have anymore questions let me know man :)

@Miguel  Version of what? The game, directx, Games for Windows Live, Visual C++/C+/Basic, what?"
,TyMod,2011-12-15T00:58Z,My bad just saw my previous torrent.  Are you running Windows 7 or Vista or are you running XP. If you are running XP then it will not work.  To find out if you have a 64 or 32 bit computer all you need to do is goto Start/Computer and then select System Properties. It will tell you what type of operating system you are using. (I am assuming you have Windows 7)
,manuel3272001,2011-12-15T01:02Z,windows 7 64 bit it says
,TyMod,2011-12-15T01:19Z,"Comment, not torrent.

And thats a good start.  So reextract the game.  Make sure you have NOT A SINGLE INSTANCE OF games for windows live installed on your computer.  If you do then uninstall it and then restart your computer.  Follow the insturctions for cracking the game (make sure to right click and hit run as admin when installing RUN THIS FIRST.reg.) Copy the crack to the places designated. Run the game and make sure to create a OFFLINE PROFILE."
,Killer3474,2011-12-15T03:31Z,"@TyMod Will do man. I'll be sure to check out your Gears torrent once it's done. Btw, you were the one that cracked this sucker, right? If so you must be damn good with this computer stuff."
,TyMod,2011-12-15T04:46Z,"lol I did do a 32 bit crack but no, this is Razors crack which is why it doesn't work with 32 bit computers.

So I can't take the credit for this crack.

But I am good with computers :) Just been real focused with encoding and distributing music man. I accidently double packed gears so I am having to unpack it and repack it again lol (stupid, tired mistakes.) So I will repack it again tomorrow, and try to up it.  Not sure how I double packed it, musta been EXTREMELY tired but anyways, once it is done I will put the disc image back together and up it. SO SORRY.  Honest to god I thought I was going to upload it today."
,Killer3474,2011-12-15T04:58Z,Yeah doing computer stuff late at night when you're tired is never a good idea lol. I was trying to get one game on my pc that I got really mad at because I fucked up and tried to fix the fuck up only to fuck up fixing the previous fuck up and it just tumbled down hill from there.
,iKruzie,2011-12-15T22:42Z,"This game is beautiful and runs perfectly, I love it, maybe I can get into it as much as I did when this was on the original xbox when it first came out.

Yeah man,  That is EXACTLY what I did so I will have to upload the game friday night.  I need my computer and unpacking the release is not going to make using my computer easy lol.  In the mean time I will upload some more iTunes music :)"

,iKruzie,2011-12-17T10:50Z,"@ Killer - WinRAR is free. It bugs you every time you open it saying you haven't bought it, but you can still use it just fine without buying it.

@TyMod - Yeah, went to your Torrent for the Key, that forum is apparently restricted to anyone registering as the menu has been disabled and no one can register even if they set up the proxy. Or I did something wrong :\ Either way, do you have a different method to obtaining a key or could just send me a key? If that's too much, just give me the number I need to call to get Microsoft to generate a replacement key as their support site is a nightmare to traverse. Thanks in advance :D"
,Killer3474,2011-12-17T21:55Z,"@iKruzie Thanks. I had WinZip before, but I guess they got smart and limited the free evaluation demos."

I tried most of the links and translated a few of the overhead messages from the forum, they basically said that I do not have authorization to look at the page even though the page is a registration page x.x So I'm led to believe that registration is down or something, if not then I guess it just doesn't like me. I'd love for you to send me a key - kruzxl@gmail.com - And if you could be so kind as to give me a way to contact Microsoft for a replacement key, just in case it's overused, I'd really appreciate it.

,TyMod,2011-12-21T19:10Z,No. You didn't place the crack in the Halo 2 folder over riding the default MF.dll did you? If so then the game will not work anymore. The crack is ONLY for the System32 folder.

i pasted the mf.dll in the system 32 folder and nowhere else. should i delete the mf.dll in the halo 2 folder ??"
,TyMod,2011-12-22T17:51Z,"No, it would render the game useless.  Reextract the game (don't place the crack again though) and run the game as a admin in compatibility mode for Windows Vista Service Pack 3.

,TyMod,2011-12-23T15:54Z,"You don't have to update to play.  So nothing gives.  Just click cancel.   If you want to play online you need to update it and to do so I made another torrent which will allow you to update the game and play online.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD, OR INSTALL YOUR XBOX LIVE ACCOUNT.  Just run the game.  When it ask you to log in cancel.  Make and offline account.  PLAY THE CAMPAIGN only.

,TyMod,2012-01-09T02:47Z,"@Deog

I hope no one would even bother reinstalling Windows to get the game to work but to each his own.

Alot of times though, it is a registry issue like Deog said. But it does work (obviously) so calm down.  You might need to totally reextract the game.  Then do all the necessary instructions except dont install GFWL.  After you do all the necessary instructions go online and download the latest GFWL client.  Install it and then play the game. :)  If it doesn't work then you did something wrong still, there is a problem with your computer (windows, reg files, incompatible hardware thats under the requirements), or the file didn't completely finish downloading.  (Alot of people have quite torrents before the files finished and data is messed up.)"

,TyMod,2012-01-24T02:29Z,"lmao, same.  Like he said, its ADDICTIVE so don't not download. lol Word play :P

Anyways your welcome."
,CmbatvRug,2012-02-03T04:36Z,"i did all of that but everytime i click on the halo 2 icon i just get nothing. dosent even start. i'm new to this so i don't know how i got it messed up but it just won't start, not even a loading bar just... sits there like Rosie O'Donnal"
,CmbatvRug,2012-02-03T04:54Z,"I did everything right and it just won't even start... if i click on it a lot it says it can't run more than one though... WHY WON""T IT TELL ME WHAT I DID WRONG!!!!!! WHY!!!!"
,TyMod,2012-02-04T05:55Z,End the task.  Run in Compatibility mode for Vista Service Pack 3 and as Admin.  Please tell me what your Windows version is please.  If it is XP then it won't work anyways.  Please tell me you also installed the latest Games for Windows Live package.
,Dinkus134,2012-02-05T06:12Z,"Thanks for the torrent. Yet I've been getting the 'Halo 2 for Windows Vista has stopped working' error. I've installed the newest GFWL, I'm using W7 64-bit and I've tried starting it in administrator. I've tried three times to install this game. It may be something to do with the crack, I'm not that sure though."
,TyMod,2012-02-06T04:31Z,Hmm...  I'm not sure. Just google it at this point man.  If you can't get anything to work then it may be a bad driver or the crack like you said.  Razor did a shit job on cracking the game.  Most likely its the crack.  If you placed it in the Halo 2 folder (your not supposed to) then I know its the crack because it will cause the game to fail if it is in the halo 2 folder.
,bammer316,2012-02-07T20:23Z,I have done part 1 to 5 and when i run the halo 2 application it tells me xlive.dll is missing?
,TyMod,2012-02-09T04:00Z,You have to have the latest Games for Windows Live installed.
,_BongRipper_,2012-02-13T09:57Z,"I'm happy to see sombody work so hard at something and actually keep up with it. What a helpful fucking guy! I commend you for your hard work. Just made an account and this is my first post. your efforts are inspiring guy. Anyhow started the DL, im on win7x64 so by the sounds of things ill be just fine. Again thanks. ( also thanks seeders!!!!!!!)"
,_BongRipper_,2012-02-14T09:44Z,Got it working. was easy as pie. Is there a way i can play the campaign with a friend via port forward or hamachi or something?
,TyMod,2012-02-15T22:31Z,"Not sure. but as they say, googles your best friend.  And everyone noy just shared but helped the world would be an even better place. lol  

Anyways look it up on google but I highly doubt it.  They took co-op out altogether which sucks since they had the chance while porting the game to atleast add online co-op."
,0R74ND0,2012-02-18T22:00Z,"@TyMod Please help me, when I double-click ""startup.exe"" this error comes up....

Error:

,TyMod,2012-02-18T22:58Z,I havn't seen that error before man. Look it up on google. My only guess is you got a bad seed and the archive got damaged from the seed or you downloaded bad info.  Just reapply the seed (download the torent and select the Halo 2 archive assuming you didn't change anything) and it should either finish the download or say its completly done. either way you are the only one to have that problem so far so IDK what to tell you.

Then when u click create a new profile, scroll down using the blue arrow and select ""create a local profile"" if you dont and you go to the trouble of actually creating a profile (like i did) itll ask for a serial.

Would appreciate the help."
,TyMod,2012-02-21T03:28Z,You have to have DirectX 9 installed.  I'm guessing you don't play games since to play ANY game you MUST HAVE DIRECTX installed.  You can download it from micrsofts website.
,flywebguy,2012-02-23T04:16Z,"What do you mean ""paste the crack""?  Paste the ""remove the registry.reg"" file or something else?  And should it be pasted into the System32 file?

THanks!"
,TyMod,2012-02-24T04:27Z,Paste MF.dll in the System32 folder AFTER installing the registry file and taking ownership over the System32 folder.

You don't click on ""startup"" to start the game, you click on ""halo2"".

My instructions:

:before installation:
*Download 7zip to un-rar the archive for free. 7zip is available for most operating systems, 32 bit and 64 bit. If you are on Linux... well, I guess you're going to have a hard time playing this game. ;)

*Download the latest version of DirectX. Most Microsoft Games require DirectX, so it's a good idea to get it anyways.

*Download the latest versin of Visual C++. As of 2/24/2012, the latest version can be found here:
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555

You don't need anything else for now. In the ""OPEN THIS FIRST!"" there is a version of both Visual C++ (vcredist executable) and Windows Games Live (or whatever the heck it's called!! ugghh). However, you never know if the version given will work with your particular system, always best to download the latest (most of the time... Linux users experience problems from updates all the time, but Microsoft is pretty good about those kind of things).

:installation:
1. Go to the OPEN ME FIRST! Folder.

2. Go to the Crack Folder.

3. Double click the ""RUN THIS FIRST!"" file.
It will then make a change to your registry.

4. Go to C:\Windows and right click on the folder ""Sysetem32"". Click, take ownership.

A bunch of stuff will happen, but eventually the command prompt will close.

5. Go into the folder, and Cut ""mf.dll"" to somewhere.

This is for 2 reason: 1. So you have the original and 2. So you can paste the cracked mf.dll regardless of whether mf.dll was being used or not.

6. Now, go to the ""Crack"" folder again, and rename ""MF.dll"" to ""mf.dll"". 

7. Copy and paste the cracked mf.dll into your System32 folder (not the original you cut somewhere).

8. Go to this website:
http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/pc/downloadclient

And install it.

Eventually, you'll get to something that looks like Windows Messenger; ignore this and exit out of it.

8. Now you're almost set. Click on ""halo2"" to start the game.* Once you're started, some dumb stuff will come up. Go ahead and make an account, but at some point, you can scroll down, and click on create offline profile or something similar (doesn't give me the option again unless I delete my account... i'm pretty far in the campaign and it would be a pain to start over). A good way to do this, is to simply disconnect from the internet when you start it up (i.e. press halo2.exe for the first time disconnect from the internet). This way, even if you press the wrong deal or something, you won't be able to sign up.

*If you are having problems starting the game, it's probably because of one or more things:

-You do not have the minimum requirements
-Your graphics card is not supported
-You don't have the right drivers
-You haven't downloaded DirectX or Visual C++

The first time around when I went about this, I eventually figured out that my graphics driver was missing, and thus DirectX wasn't working right. An easter egg hunt eventually fixed ALL my driver issues, and now I'm playing the game. Hopefully your guy's fix is just as easy."

,TyMod,2012-02-26T03:09Z,If your using a 32bit operating system it wont work without my fix anyways.  You may want to thank about that before cracking the game. If you still want to do it I will tell you how but till then thing about it beause if you install the crack on a 32 bit operating system it could corrupt your stuff.
,jack.exe,2012-02-26T17:14Z,@tymod pls answer my question
,TyMod,2012-02-26T21:36Z,All you have to do is read the earlier instructions and install the reg file I included. That gives you the take ownership option. It's quite useful but if windows media player and internet explorer become corrupt dont scream i didnt tell you so.

,bonzi64,2012-03-01T03:52Z,"whenever I try to connect to a game it says I have a different version, even though I downloaded the update from microsoft's website - is there a newer version than 1.0.2.129? not sure if the update is working properly"

,TyMod,2012-03-03T17:53Z,"You know... I would but most people dont read comments and I do know what is up with the crack so I would rather say I am the only wise guy when it comes to Halo 2.

i tried the whole process 4-5 times bt got no success 
please help me"
,TyMod,2012-03-24T00:40Z,Well it is most likely due to a mf.dll crash becuz of the 32 bit operating system. Run in compatibility for vista service pack 1. Also as admin.

,TyMod,2012-03-26T05:00Z,idk what to tell you.  The game is a pain in the ass to run and the crack is 64 bit only.  Try restoring everthing to its original state and the dont crack the game but run it offline so it cant ask for a key.
,ohithere,2012-04-09T13:25Z,"TyMod
Thanks for the upload, fast DL, everything (>500kb/s :]). Clear, neat instructions
I followed them flawlessly but I seem to be having a problem. I scoured comments for about half an hour before deciding to write my own...
Now I've installed Live gaming on Windows and vcredit via the Crack folder, and I'm at the part where I simply launch the game from the extracted folder (just to clarify, I simply double click the file ""halo2"" in the list, correct?)
anyways, I'm assuming I did everything right cause I'm decent at following directions but I got this error:
""LIVE Gaming on Windows has failed to initialize. This may be because another Live Gaming on Windows application (such as the Halo 2 dedicated server) is running on the same machine. Otherwise reinstalling the game may fix this problem""
I'm unsure of what to do, think you could lend me a hand?
Additional information - upon launching Halo 2 the first time, my aspect ratio was shifted from 1600x1200 (standard modern 15 inch HDR laptop size/aspect ratio) to about 1024x768. The change has been irreversible without work, or simply restarting my system.
System Specs for clarification:
-Intel Core i5-480M CPU
-6 GB DDR3 RAM
-Intel HD Graphics onboard chipset (tested and will run Halo 2 for certain - has run Fallout 3)
-Windows 7 64bit
I see you're pretty good at responding. Hope you're just as good to me!
Once again, great work... Not too sure what I did wrong!"

@rickyg310 Your welcome man."
,codehpr0,2012-04-17T23:51Z,"Want a key for the game so you can paly online ? 
go to CodeHp ro.com Remove space"
,TyMod,2012-04-19T02:03Z,"Do not goto the above link.

If the method I provided will not work any longer then you will not be able to get a key to work.

If you do want to pay online download a disc image version of the game and install it like normal.

When it ask you to put in a key use one of the keys I posted here not to long ago.  When you do so it will most likely say its been over used and to use a different activation key or to activate over the phone. 

Click to activate it by phone and then it will give you a key with 9 different sections, each section have 4 digits/letters.  Call Microsoft with the number given and then et the automated thing come up.

IF YOU HAVE PATIENCE you can give the entire freaking set of digits to the automated piece of crap but I recommend you find a very quiet room because if it hears a peep it wont understand what you say.  Also when it gives you the key it generates you will most likely be unable to understand it.

IF YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE then just wait to get through to an actual indian dude and tell them the key and let them generate it.  You may not be able to understand them at first but it wont take near as long as trying to use the automated service. 

Trust me on this as I tryed the automated machine twice befre getting pissed and then deciding to just speak to a representative. 

This is the easiest way to play online for free and without having to worry about Microsoft.

Don't be scared as they will give you a key no problem."
,gamendorf,2012-04-21T16:32Z,"So I've been following this torrent for awhile now, and I have come up with a few conclusions:

1.  TyMod is very good at what he does.  That means that if he cracks a game for a specific system configuration, then it works for THAT SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION!  Everyone that is griping at him for not cracking their particular versions need to stop being so stuck up and arogant by thinking that everyone on the internet works their tails off to fic problems with YOUR SYSTEM.

2.  The torrent works FLAWLESSLY on 64 bit systems----   IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS

3.  I have a 32 bit version of Vista.  So, after reading the comments, I know that this torrent will no work for me.  However, I am not a helpless incompetant, so I did some research, and was able to merge TyMods torrent with another to make it work on my system.  The following are the instructions:

A. Download and extract this torrent.

B.  Download and extract this one as well: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4807455/Activation_bypass_crack_for_halo_2

C.  Download the newest version of Games for Windows Live:  http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient

D.  Install Games for Windows Live

E.  Navigate to your CWindows folder, right click on System32, and Take Ownership

F. Once that completes Open System32, and copy and paste a backup of MF.dll somewhere else.

G.  Open TyMod's Halo2 folder, and run the file OPENTHISFIRST!/vcredist.

H.  Notice the folder names Crack.  Open it and run the file named RUN THIS  FIRST

I.  The mf.dll here is completely useless to 32bit users, do us all a favor and delete it so we dont have to hear any more complaints.

J.  Now navigate to the other torrent extraction folder. There are TWO DIFFERENT Mf.DLL files that you need here.  Notice the two different folders named ""Systme32"" and ""For halo 2 folder""  Each of them contains a single file named MF.dll.  Please be carefull and don't mix them up.  They are different.

K.  Open the System32 folder, and copy the mf.dll file.  Paste and overwrite the mf.dll in cWindowsSystem32.

L. Go to the ""for halo2 folder"" and copy the mf.dll.  Now navigate to TyMod's Halo2 extraction folder. (This is the folder that has halo2.exe in it)   Paste and overwrite TyMod's mf.dll file.

M.  Run the program (the one with masterchief as the icon)

N.  Now you are in the game and ready to go.  The only other issue is making an offline profile.  IT is kind of difficult to find, but just look around carefully.  If i remember correctly, it is not a button on the GUI.  It is a blue text link inside of a paragraph of Microsoft Live bs)

There you go.  TyMod's stuff now works on 32bit.  Yay!!! Can we all get on with our lives now?

TyMod... Thanks for all the hard work, and for putting up with all of the jerks out there in cyber land."
,TyMod,2012-04-22T06:46Z,"Yeah. Thanks for your comment. I hate to say it but sadly most people wont read your comment and will start bitching about the same shit.  I appreciate it but they will never EVER figure it out.

Appreciate your comment and the fact that you got a brain and took the time to do something yourself. :) Makes me want to upload something. lol"

,TyMod,2012-04-27T04:02Z,Well. IDK what to tell you. If it is doing that I ofcourse would say uninstall all versions of it and then restarting your computer and then you need to install the latest buy if you already did it then idk what to tell you.
,TyMod,2012-04-28T02:00Z,As for your request I actually want to get Lost Planet 2 so I will grab it for you. Diablo 2 isn't worth uploading though. I think fuckeduppunk or however you spell his name has a Diablo 2 upload that works on lan. Download his. I can tell you I know it will work.
,Belumpelump,2012-04-30T02:00Z,It runs extremely smooth... When I'm looking in one place. It's when I look around that it starts to look... not so nice.

I have a high spec computer (Win 7) and the game itself is running at a buttery smooth 60 FPS+, but when I try to look around with my mouse it looks extremely choppy. Does anyone know of a fix?"
,TyMod,2012-05-05T03:22Z,"I have heard of the problem before. It is a issue the game has with a driver. (not your fault or the drivers fault but rather the games.) I am not sure what to tell you but even when I play it feels a bit choopy. If you disable VSync it will help with it though.

To disable vsync look it up on google."

,DjChrisEvis,2012-05-09T19:57Z,THIS IS WAST OF TIME...! CRAPPY DOWNLOAD.!!!!!!! only FUCKING PROBLEMS. I CAN START THE GAME BUT WHEN IT ASKS FOR A ACCOUNT A HAVE TYPED IN MY ACCOUNT ID AND PASSWORD IT SAYS THAT THE PRODUCT KEY DOES NOT WORK. FUCK THIS. I HAVE FOLLOW YOUR INSTRUCTIONS AND STILL DOESN'T WORK.... FUUUUUUUUUUCK THIS MAN!!!! going to bud the game for 5$ This is not worth it!!!!
,TyMod,2012-05-09T23:16Z,"Thats because you have to get your own product key you fucking moron. IF YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS A LITTLE MORE IT SAYS MAKE A OFFLINE ACCOUNT.

Learn to type and if thats truly how you speak then I hope you are mentally retarted or 8 because no grown ass man or women should talk like that.

Sorry you are justa tad iliterate.

Have fun."
,TyMod,2012-05-09T23:17Z,"And when you first try to get in the game, if you hit home and hit create an account at the very bottem of the tab (you have to scroll) is a little blue looking link that says CREATE A OFFLINE ACCOUNT.

Look it up next time instead of being a ignorant ass. 5 minutes on youtube and you could have been playing the game by now."
,Dataanti,2012-05-11T00:26Z,"thanks a lot, havent played this game in forever... i got it to work just fine without doing any of your instructions either :P

although my friend on the other hand followed the instructions exactly and he cant start the game, also other programs will not start anymore, any ideas?"
,TyMod,2012-05-11T01:36Z,"If he has a 32 bit system then it is definatly the case.

The crack can cause issues on 32 bit systems which is explained in the comments.

Please read through the comments as I have a fix.

If he has a 64 bit operating system then let me know."
,Dataanti,2012-05-11T01:48Z,"cool, thanks :)

he is on a 32 bit W7 SRV 1"
,TyMod,2012-05-11T02:59Z,"Thats definatly the reason then man.

Just replace the crack with my crack fix and the game will work or replace it with the original MF.dll.

The crack was made for 64 bit pcs so when its placed in the System32 folder it messes up alot of the functions of 32 bit operating systems. I had the problem on my 32 bit laptop so I had to fix it.

Point being either download my crack fix and place it over the System32 folders crack or put the original MF.dll back if you have it."
,docsdota,2012-05-13T21:42Z,"Hey TyMod, I'm using 64bit windows ultimate. I followed it through and through, but when i start halo 2.exe at step 7 it goes to full screen then says Live gaming on windows failed to initialize.

Can you help me with this? If you have time, email me at docsdota@gmail.com"
,Blizzard2381,2012-05-13T22:51Z,"sorry to be that one person who doesn't know shit, and I am probably overlooking it, but when I open the halo2.exe, it says:

  ""Live gaming on Windows failed to initialize. This may be because another LIVE Gaming on windows application (such as Halo 2 Dedicated Server) is running on the same machine. Otherwise, reinstalling may fix the problem.""


I have read the instructions 100 fold, and I dont see what is wrong. I have a Windows 7 x64."
,TyMod,2012-05-15T04:15Z,"Please look through the comments as this issue has been addressed many times before.

You will need to uninstall Games for Windows Live, restart the computer, download and install the latest Games for Windows Live from xbox.com and then restart the computer. Run the game and it will work just fine. Make sure you restart the computer too."
,Noblesix,2012-05-22T04:05Z,"At the first time I got the game I didn't read the instructions.
Even after reading it I couldn't make it work.

The solution is simple:
IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS RESTORE YOUR SYSTEM TO A PREVIOUS POINT.

and don't forget to install Directx9 BEFORE doing all of these instructions.

You can find it here: http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/7/1/1718CCC4-6315-4D8E-9543-8E28A4E18C4C/dxwebsetup.exe


Thank you Tymod! Working fine!"

Pretty self explainatory."
,herpafuckinderp,2012-05-26T05:55Z,"I have Windows 7 64 bit and, when I performed all the cracking steps described in the instructions, I kept getting issues with the game not loading due to an issue with LIVE games for windows ""being open in a different process"" etc.

Frustrated, I did a system restore to before I made my registry changes for the crack, and decided to simply try opening the game without cracking beforehand, and with the most current version of Games for Windows Live.

It worked.

So if you have Win7 64, simply install the most recent of GfWL and run the game.  You can still make an offline account, though the steps have changed to do so.  After you create your offline account, it will ask you to log in to Live regardless, but simply click the red X at the top right corner of the game screen and it will close out of the login screen and resume your game.

So, if you've already created an offline GfWL account for other games like Fallout 3, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, etc, you don't need to crack anything.  Just run the .exe and play.

So simply run it first, and decide whether or not you need to crack after."

Do you mean the instructions given in the other torrent? I previously installed another torrent that asked me for a cd key, rather than a product key, I found one and gave it to the system, and it accepted it, so I don't think I need to follow the other steps, but will getting the cd image allow it to update?"

,Enigma42,2012-06-03T23:53Z,"Hey TyMod,

Do you have any recommendations when it comes to good graphics cards? I have a:

Compaq WF1907 (1440x900@60Hz)
128MB GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 (HP)
Pixel and Vertex Shader 2

which is the minimum required. As such, Halo 2 is really, really choppy. Thanks in advance for the help!"
,TyMod,2012-06-05T07:19Z,"You want atleast a Radeon 4650 or Nvidia 7800 to play the game smooth. In todays market if you want something really cheap just get a AMD Radeon 6770 or 6850. 6850 is about 150 and 6770 is about 100 on tigerdirect.com

It's what I recommend to play any game decently even though it wont be max detail.

I personally have a ATI Radeon HD 5770 and will be upgrading to a 7850 at the end of the month.

The AMD Radeon HD 7850 is $250 USD."
,apuurboo,2012-06-05T17:00Z,"dear tymod, thanks for the torrent. but I can't run it. I desperately need your cordial help.

,apuurboo,2012-06-05T17:00Z,"2. you said, ""If it tells you the file is open somewhere you will need to rename
the ORIGINAL MF.dll to something random and move it to your
desktop.  After doing so paste the crack!""

my question is paste the crack where? desktop? only the entire crack folder?

As I haven't been able to copy and replace the MF.dll file to system32 so will this instruction be applicable to me?"
,apuurboo,2012-06-05T17:01Z,"3. ""Install Game for Windows Live"" does it mean to install the XLiveRedist1.0.6027? I already installed it along with vcredit which are available in the OPEN THIS FIRST! folder. But now what? nothing happens. Where is the game? What I need to do next? What is it that I don't understand? How and from where I can start the game?

Waiting anxiously for your reply. Your help will be highly appreciated. I'm dying to play the game. btw I'm using win7."

You will need to rumage through the comments as ALL your questions have been answered.

CHANGE IT TO BLABLABLA(COMPUTERNAME/Owner)
APPLY, GIVE URSELF ALl PERMISSIONS AFTERWARD IN PERMISSIONS TAB!!!
2. DO SAME FOR SYSTEM 32( ALSO UNCHECK READONLY FOR SYSTEM 32)
And Ignore all readonly changing errors,
3. DO SAME FOR MF.DLL( ALSO, For THIS ONE READ ONLY NEEDS TO BE OFF)
