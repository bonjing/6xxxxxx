...................................................................................              For my third game upload I bring you the infamous HALO 2
...................................................................................You can get this game to work on XP so I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t bother making a XP workaround.

Instructions: (I figured you would be smart enough to un-rar it.)

1. You must first goto the OPEN ME FIRST! folder.

2. Goto the CRACK folder.

3. Double click and install the registry file: RUN THIS FIRST.

4. Goto C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Windows and right click on the System32 folder
and click Take Ownership.

5. Once that is done copy MF.dll and paste it in the System32
folder.  Overwrite the old one.
  - If it tells you the file is open somewhere you will need to rename
the ORIGINAL MF.dll to something random and move it to your
desktop.  After doing so paste the crack!

6. Install Game for Windows Live and then install vcredit.

7. Once that is done you are all set.  Just start the game and
MAKE SURE you create a OFFLINE account.  If you have a
updated GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE it WILL NOT WORK
so uninstall games for windows live.  Though LIVE and all that
good stuff are NOT faded out you still CANNOT play online so
don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t even try.

ENJOY!!!

Seed and comment on how I did.  I fully tested this on both 32 and 64 bit Windows 7 computers.  So if you have and issue you did something wrong so re-do the instructions above.
