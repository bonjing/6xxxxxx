Are you ever going to seed this Torrent?"
,hiroyoku,2011-02-22T21:55Z,"goodwood

I seed it as fast as i can and when i can... It was a really hard work to collect it (More than 1 year), so be patient and say thanks preferably."
,goodwood,2011-02-23T18:04Z,Seems to be working now. The first 2 days It was just idle and showed no seeders. It is running now so yes I do thank you for your efforts. Looks like a great collection for Tila fans.
,hiroyoku,2011-03-09T17:22Z,Stay in seed after u'r done!
