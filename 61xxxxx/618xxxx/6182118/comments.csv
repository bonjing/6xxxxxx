[V],manOtor,2011-07-15T22:44Z,"@ toxicmax:

It kind of says it in the description: This is Season 1,2 and 3.
Season 4 is currently airing ;)...

@ Tom_thomas:

What do you mean ""CC""?"
,hellzfyre21,2011-07-17T07:43Z,"Awesome torrent. :) Thanks heaps! 

P.S. I think CC means Closed Captions. "

,Fezman92,2011-08-07T03:26Z,Season 2 ep 13 does not work when converted to MP4
,Reviewer,2011-08-14T20:39Z,"Hey captain jack harkness is played by a fudge packer. Just thought i should let you people know, before you get to involved with the show. I stopped watching it."
,Reviewer,2011-08-14T20:44Z,"@Tom_Thomas

Unfortunately CC (closed captions) aren't available for torrented shows because CC is a service provided by your television networks along with your TV set. So since you are watching this on your computer you should look into ""Subtitles', you can find many websites that provide them if you google. And I would suggest using VLC media player because it makes adding subtitles a snap. Hope this helps."
[V],manOtor,2011-08-19T00:59Z,"@Reviewer:

thank you for pointing out the Closed Caption thing to Tom_thomas.

But I feel also very sorry for you. You are missing a (as the Doctor would say) fantastic series only because of an extremely retarded point of view on the world.
You seriously stopped watching beause the lead actor is a homosexual?
Maybe you should rethink your activities on this site, The Pirate Bay.
You know what we stand for?
Not only for free speech but freedom in any aspect of life - from having the freedom to choose to drink a beer anytime you want all the way to the free choice of your sexual interest.
So, being purely theoratical, chances are that you already downloaded stuff from some queery folks. Maybe you should bring your computer to the doctor for an HIV test. If you touched your computer since, you might want to get checked, too."
,Medba,2011-08-19T19:43Z,"This is the first complete set of any tv show in which I have not been able to find closed captions for and/or did not include them. 

Subtitle sources:
http://www.subtitlesource.org/title/tt0485301
I use this one the most

the other two around are:

http://subscene.com/Torchwood-First-Season/subtitles-66585.aspx

And

http://www.tvsubtitles.net/

The biggest prob is when the tags are deleted it is VERY hard to find CC's sync and all three listed above do have CC's...but if anyone has found them or knows of an easy to find them without the tags please let me know....

[V],manOtor,2011-08-27T02:20Z,"@ everyone seeking subtitles for this pack:

This pack consists of the original HDTV-rips, released by the scene hours after being aired.
The original files were named like this: e.g. ""Torchwood.s01e12.hdtv-bia"".
Unfortunately it looks like there are not many subs out there with those tags.
Anyway, if you are searching for synced subs you should include those tags in your query."
,MaskWhoRU,2011-09-02T16:25Z,thank you so much!
