Maya is fabulous as always in this set. We'd been shooting a while, after starting late, and hunger set in. I offered Maya a banana, thinking we could use it in the shoot, and turned for the camera only to turn back and find her holding a peel. She ate it that fast and we got no shots. So she took another banana and that's what you see. A model full of bananas. 

Maya is a genius. Talking to Maya is talking to someone whose lights are all on. She is amazingly intelligent and has the ability to either solve great problems of thought and science, or win a million dollars on Jeopardy. I'd bet on Jeopardy because she seems to like modeling alot more than solving math problems. Personally, I'd enjoy the math more, but that's why I work on my side of the camera. Maya's got some great antique jewelry that matches well with her sophisticated style. What she lacks in experience she makes up for in natural ability, but hey...she's smart. Driving is another matter though. Maya's a genius, but I wouldn't get in a car with her behind the wheel.
