Review by Scott Yanow (allmusic.com)
Vibraphonist Milt Jackson recorded three albums for CTI in the early '70s; this album is the best of the trio. The Don Sebesky arrangements for the strings showcase Jackson well, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and pianist Herbie Hancock make impressions the four songs (highlighted by Hubbard's "Sunflower") receive fine treatment.
