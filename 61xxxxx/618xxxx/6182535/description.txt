"Guess Who's Coming to Delhi"

When Todd's (Ben Rappaport) U.S. boss Jerry 
(Matt Walsh) makes a surprise visit, Todd 
instructs his staff to be on their best 
behavior. However, Todd quickly discovers 
that Jerry has no interest in work and is 
ready to party instead. While trying to 
keep a drunk Jerry out of trouble, Todd 
ends up in hot water with Tonya (Pippa 
Black). Meanwhile, Charlie (Diedrich Bader) 
receives a reprimand from human resources 
for being culturally insensitive, so he 
turns to Gupta (Parvesh Cheena) for a crash 
course in Indian culture to try and save 
his job.
