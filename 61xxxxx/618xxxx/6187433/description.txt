     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      They arrive, they smoke, they wait - armed robbers seeking
      redemption, life-long thieves, addicts and anxious fathers of
      wayward children. Hard exteriors hide soft centres, old lives
      exist in young bodies - ordinary people awaiting judgement on an
      unlovely stretch of pavement outside a London magistrates'
      court. Whilst waiting for their cases to be heard they reveal
      their lives, and the complexities of the human soul are laid
      bare. Tense and intimate conversations with the filmmaker
      illuminate stories that the magistrates hear daily. Director
      Marc Isaacs spent three months outside Highbury Magistrates
      Court and, in doing so, demonstrates how the eye of the camera
      has the ability to delve much deeper into character and
      motivation than the eye of the law. Consequently, the more we
      get to know the characters in this film, the harder it is to
      make easy judgements. Whilst the court must judge, the filmmaker
      need not.
