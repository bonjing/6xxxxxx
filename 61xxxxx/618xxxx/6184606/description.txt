THE EARLY CASES
This cd is another musical compilation from Ian Marshall at Tronador Music in Brasil. This cd is a combination of our first independent EP "Four Fresh Lemons" and "Meet Us Inside" the first mini-album for a major label. We were just emerging from the squats and had no idea what a recording studio was all about. Playing along to a "click-track" drove Cliff insane and was the start of a hatred of studio work. It seemed we were great players in the "live" environment, but we took years to translate that to the studio. This music is indicative of that time period and brings back memories of living in the squats of Glebe and living on the dole. If your cheque was late (there were no ATM's in those days) you had to go all weekend without any money. We learned to scab and steal where needed to survive.
