,bruky123,2011-04-29T10:06Z,"Bestofgoon and Marekralj,I know what is problem to you two guys (excatly to everyone).This is the BETA VERSION.Once when the full version of the game come or when the BETA version collapse,you can't play it no more.That's problem to everyone.And when BETA version collapse or the full version comes,you have nothing to do except to play full version of the game.That will end your problem 'bout your game.!!!
