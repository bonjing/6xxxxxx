,bartoko,2011-06-11T16:54Z,"thanks for sharing here. I know where you got it from. Those fileserve and filesonic links are a drag with the captcha ;) I hope this picks up on the speed cause 20 kb is a bit too slow :(
Come on people let's seed! This is a mayor 20th century piece of art. I'm having a lifelong flirtation with it.
I appreciate HQ but I can't imagine what human ears can use 96 khz frecuencies (192/2 = 96: nyquist theorem), let alone what speakers, no matter how ""audiophile"". IMHO ripping at 192 is a bit too much. 96 shoud be enough, and the file would be much smaller!
I'm still grabbing this :) I want to hear the original mix and probable remaster"
,bartoko,2011-06-13T00:36Z,I'd be happy with a 24/96 version. Anyone?
,dontaskdonttell,2011-08-30T14:20Z,thanks for the extraordinary respect you have for music and its sound!
