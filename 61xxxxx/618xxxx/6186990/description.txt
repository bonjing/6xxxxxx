__________________________________________

This contains Teo Macero's original 1969 mix. In 1998, Mark Wilder remixed this album from the original multi-track tapes, using digital effects. This remix is what appeared on the "Complete Bitches Brew" CD boxset, and all subsequent issues on all formats. The only places to hear the original mix on CD, are the original late-80's Columbia purple bordered double CD (which sounds horrendous), or a mid-90s Japanese Mastersound CD issue (SRCS 9118~9). It is also in the new "Complete Columbia Album Collection" 70 CD boxset.
