,hardik_860,2011-02-20T12:40Z,waiting for some old classic movies from u.......
[V],RajMahal,2011-02-20T13:59Z,"@ hardik    I feel so bad saying this to you...i looked up for your requests made earlier  
The last samurai and Unforgiven...they both have few rips flying around...
The last samurai has more encodes  i think and even if i encode The last samurai it willl be deff. more than 2 GB considering the length of the movie..
As for Unforgiven  there are not a lot but what i observed is that not a lot of people will d/l it even i encode ... please feel free to request more ...I hope i will fulfill your request one day :)
No hard feelings buddy.. 
Peace out"
