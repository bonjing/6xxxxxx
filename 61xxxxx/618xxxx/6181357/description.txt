Revenge With The Nerd

Navid (Michael Steger) and Dixon (Tristan 
Wilds) convince a music producer to shoot 
a music video at Shirazi Studios. 
Adrianna's (Jessica Lowndes) suspicions 
are confirmed, and she tells Silver 
(Jessica Stroup) about her plot for 
revenge. Emily (Abbie Cobb, "Jonas") 
distracts Annie (Shenae Grimes) and tries 
to get close to Liam (Matt Lanter), but 
her plan backfires. Teddy (Trevor 
Donovan) leans on Silver for support. 
Meanwhile, reality producers follow 
Adrianna and her friends around trying to 
shoot a pilot, and Naomi (AnnaLynne 
McCord) is surprised by her reaction to a 
nerdy lab partner who helps her out.
