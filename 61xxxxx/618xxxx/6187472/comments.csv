I really appreciate the fact that you went to the trouble to share this, with the great BBC subtitles..Every episode is of a very high quality.. and I also appreciate that you uploaded the entire series (perfectly).

I note that you've also uploaded Deadwood, by the way, which just goes to show that you're a person of excellent taste :-) 

So cheers - and once again, thank you!
