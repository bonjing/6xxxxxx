      Fifty years after the village of Six Bells in Abertillery
      was hit by a tragic coal mining disaster killing 45 local men,
      renowned artist Sebastien Boyesen has returned to the community.
      He wants to create an iconic 20-metre-high landmark sculpture
      for Wales to change the face of the area for generations to
      come. But it's a hugely complex piece of work and Sebastien and
      his team are working against the clock to complete this enormous
      modern masterpiece in time for the memorial ceremony on 28th
      June 2010. Alongside the tensions surrounding the building and
      installation of this giant sculpture, the film follows the
      moving true stories of the families who lost loved ones in the
      disaster, and we hear the experiences of some of those who were
      actually there at the time of the accident.
