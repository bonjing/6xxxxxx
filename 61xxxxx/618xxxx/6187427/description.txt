      Art critic Laura Cumming takes a journey through more than
      five centuries of self-portraits and finds out how the greatest
      names in western art transformed themselves into their own
      masterpieces. The film argues that self-portraits are a unique
      form of art, one that always reveals the truth of how artists
      saw themselves and how they wanted to be known to the world.
      Examining the works of key self-portraitists including Durer,
      Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Warhol, Laura traces the development of
      the genre, uncovering the strange and various ways artists have
      managed to get their inner and outer selves to match up. Laura
      investigates the stories behind key self-portraits, interviews
      artists as they attempt a self-portrait, and shows how the
      history of the self-portrait is about more than how art and
      artists have changed; it also charts the evolution of the way we
      see ourselves and what it means to be human. She also discusses
      Courbet with Julian Barnes, Rembrandt's theatricality with Simon
      Callow, and meets the contemporary artists Mark Wallinger and
      Patrick Hughes, observing the latter making his first ever
      self-portrait.
