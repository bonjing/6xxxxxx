A Flock Of Seagulls - Nightmares [promo].VOB


Very HQ very rare promo music video. "Nightmares" is a song from Listen, the second album release by the UK synthpop band A Flock of Seagulls, released in 1983. It teamed the musical group with record producer Mike Howlett again, except on the single release "(It's Not Me) Talking" which was produced by Bill Nelson. The record included the UK Top 10 hit "Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)". The shape of a person's face on its sleeve cover is in fact the band's drummer, Ali Score.

A Flock Of Seagulls (also known as Flock Of Seagulls) is a British Grammy Award-winning band originally formed by brothers Michael "Mike" Score (keyboards, vocals) and Alister "Ali" James Score (drums), with Frank Maudsley (bass) and Paul Reynolds (guitar).

The group had a string of international hit singles including "I Ran (So Far Away)", "Space Age Love Song" "Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)" and "The More You Live, the More You Love", and became notable in the 1980s for their MTV video for the song "I Ran (So Far Away)".

Although parodied in later years, the band is now recognized as a pioneering act, capturing the zeitgeist of their time, particularly with multi-layered hits such as "Space Age Love Song", "Telecommunication" and "Modern Love is Automatic".

In November 2003, the original line-up (Mike and Ali Score, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley) reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series, Bands Reunited. In September 2004, they reformed again and played a small number of live shows in the United States, but broke up immediately afterward. Mike Score continues to tour with other musicians as A Flock Of Seagulls.
