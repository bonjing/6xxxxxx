Rayne is a flower child but a very contemporary one. She's not stuck in the past. She's got the earthy sensibility of someone connected to her environment and surroundings, but she's also got a head for business. Scratch the surface and find an entrepreneur. She's a driven model, and has interest in a number of websites and ventures. She could be a stock broker, but I doubt she'd find that copacetic.
