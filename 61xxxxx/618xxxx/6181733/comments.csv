TBH i don't really mind Selena Gomez as the replacement voice for Selenia, she's good with her voice. This was MUCH better than the second movie and a decent enough ending... but nothing will beat the original... it was literally mountains above in story quality...

if you liked the first movie... it's worth seeing the third one..."
