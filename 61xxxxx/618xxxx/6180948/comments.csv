[T],Sunblock.,2011-02-19T01:39Z,"1. U need DVD+R DL 8.5gb
2. U need a console with flashed dvd with latest ixtreme (LT+)"
,DiirtyHippy,2011-02-19T02:03Z,"@sunblock

I disagree, you can have older firmware and games will still work as long as you patch them correctly

I still use 1.51 final and patch my isos with ppf-o-matic3 (i cant switch to teh new stuff since ALL my games are patched and wont work with LT)"
,DiirtyHippy,2011-02-19T02:04Z,oh forgot to mention my drive is one of those old ms28 samsungs...
,coolluv01,2011-02-19T04:22Z,howz the game??anyone plz reply
[T],Sunblock.,2011-02-19T10:16Z,"@ DiirtyHippy

Im not wrong. You can patch games to other wave's yes but by doing that your up the risk 100% by geting banned.

But playing on a banned console or you dont care about live then patching is an option."
[T],Sunblock.,2011-02-19T10:18Z,latest FW = better protection against geting banned. :P
,Aoshi123,2011-02-19T20:06Z,"Hello, i have an older version of ixtreme so i always patch newer games with ppf wave 3 patcher. I downloaded this game, installed the dash update but when i try to play i get a message saying ""You need to install an update inorder to play this game"". 

When i play install i got a ""scratched disc"" error. I tried this in 2 different dvds but no avail. Do i have to install an antipiracy patch or whatever?"
,DJ_SEVEN,2011-02-19T21:08Z,"@ DiirtyHippy

Where do you get the files for ppf OM?

Im on 1.5 as well

Cheers"
,DiirtyHippy,2011-02-20T01:16Z,"@sunblock

ah sunblock! i didnt say your wrong, mang! i forgot to mention that i never play online

 I have yet to be banned when i log into XBL, but i NEVER play online OR even have a game in the drive. I guess im just really lukcy, since my drive is also spoofed lawls"
,DiirtyHippy,2011-02-20T01:19Z,"@aoshi

Im sorry man :[ but you will need to get the new LT and also any games that you patched will no longer work

The reason why im not affected is because i have an old samsung drive, which are not compatible with AP2.5 (as in, i dont ever have to worry about AP2.5 or 3.0 or 9000.> )

,DiirtyHippy,2011-02-20T01:21Z,"@dj seven

I remember getting my ppf OM from a link on a Youtube video :x"

,Rodan.H,2011-02-20T22:00Z,"Hi guys I'm new to all this. I know that you need a dual layer dvd drive and cd but do you need a modded xbox 360? Because I saw a video that said it doesn't and with what program should I patch and what program should I burn the games with? Like I said, I'm completely a noob so sorry for being retarded x)"
,black_shadow_1981,2011-02-20T23:48Z,"you need a modded (flashed) xbox you need dvd+R DL discs, i use imgburn set to write speed x2, verbatim are the best discs ive burned over 60 and not had 1 mess up yet

flashing is harder then it sounds i would look online for a modder that can do the work for you

 make sure you get FW LT+ mine cost ÂŁ25 to get flashed"

,treston323,2011-02-22T01:38Z,I heard that Gears of War beta files were on the disk. Is there any way we could possibly play the GoW3 beta once its released?
,mrkmhtet,2011-02-22T14:45Z,can anybdy tell me this game hv ap2.5?
,remedy2,2011-02-24T00:06Z,I don't think its ap2.5.  You should run it through abgx and autofix this.  It seems to need it to pass stealth.

,tangmonk,2011-03-11T16:58Z,"works great. yes you have to update the dashboard, which is easy and hasn't affected any previously burnt games (vanquish, medal of honor, red dead redemption...). simply downloaded it ran through abgx at level 3 and burnt and played. everything was fine."
