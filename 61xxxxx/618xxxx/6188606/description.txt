Jimmy Iovine produced five of the songs for the film and the soundtrack album. For Ellen Aim's singing voice, he combined the voices of Laurie Sargent and Holly Sherwood. The Attackers were the real-life (Face to Face) bandmates of Sargent, who provided the lead vocals on Ellen Aim's songs "Never Be You" and "Sorcerer" and supporting vocals on "Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young." The version of 'Sorcerer' on the actual soundtrack album was performed by Marilyn Martin (written by Stevie Nicks).

Two Wagnerian rock songs written by Jim Steinman were part of the soundtrack: "Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young" and "Nowhere Fast," both performed by Fire Inc. with Holly Sherwood as lead vocal. The title of the former was used as the tagline on some promotional materials for the film. Dan Hartman's "I Can Dream About You" is the most successful song from this movie and became a Billboard top 10 hit in 1984. In the movie, the song is performed by "the Sorels," a fictional doo-wop style group consisting of actors Stoney Jackson, Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson, and Robert Townsend.[2] However, the song was actually sung by Winston Ford, whose vocals were convincingly lip-synced by Stoney Jackson in the movie. There are thus two versions of the song, but the most popular was sung by Dan Hartman for commercial release.
