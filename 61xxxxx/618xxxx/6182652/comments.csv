,espirates,2011-02-19T22:38Z,I don't think anyone on TPB gives a flying fuck about the developers lol.
,fortinmike,2011-02-20T09:56Z,"Hey there, I'm the developer of this app. Don't lose your time downloading this shitty release; if you download it from my website, you'll get the app to auto-update, which you won't if you download a cracked App Store version (auto-updates depend on the App Store app itself). Did I mention that it's free on my website?

Thanks a lot for this comment, it shows there are still people who respect software makers in this world! :)

Seems like there is at least one who does. Who knows, maybe a few of you all will feel like the app is worth something to them after trying it out?

Anyway, download away if you want a non-self-updating, possibly virus-laden app (Yes there are some Mac viruses. Remember the iWork '09 stuff?). Download it for free on my website otherwise, or if you feel like it, it's available for two bucks on the App Store.
