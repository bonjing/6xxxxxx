Pat Benatar - Invincible [promo].VOB


Very HQ rare theme from "The Legend Of Billie Jean" movie soundtrack promo music video. "Invincible" is a song from Seven the Hard Way, Pat Benatar's seventh album, released in 1985. "Seven albums in seven years...Two dice...3 and a half dots each. Seven...the hard way." It peaked at #26 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced two hits: "Invincible" and "Sex as a Weapon".

Pat commented at her concerts before performing "Invincible": "This is from one of the worst movies ever made." This statement refers to the film The Legend of Billie Jean, which did poorly at the box office, and became a cult classic to MTV fans in general.

The album failed to certify platinum.

Scott St. Clair Sheets returns to the fold since 1981's Precious Time and Frank Linx replaces Donny Vossov on Bass.
