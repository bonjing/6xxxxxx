Mikio Naruse - Maihime / Dancing Girl (1951)

"Dancing Girl (Maihime, 1951) may not be as successful a picture as Ginza Cosmetics or Meshi, but it is an important transitional film, as Naruse deploys some of the flamboyant melodramatic devices that he used in the 1930s in the context of a story that is very much a postwar narrative. Elaborate, distinctive camera movements at moments of high dramatic tension tend to displace acting technique in the representation of psychological states. Used only in conjunction with the two main women characters, Namiko (Takamine Mieko) and her daughter Shinako (Okada Mariko), the camera movements now seem to detract from the emotional weight of the drama. From the failure of this film, we can glimpse something of the change in the aesthetics of realism implicit in the representation of the democratic self of postwar Japan." Catherine Russell.
