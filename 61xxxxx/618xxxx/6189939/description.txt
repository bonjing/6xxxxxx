Fred Cornogs seventh album of slow, sad home-recorded pop songs does not, when you get down to it, sound all that different from the first six. There are subtle changes: whether because of upgrades to his home studio gear over the years -- he recently traded in his trusty old Tascam 388 for a Korg D1600 mini-studio -- or his increased mastery of it, his music has evolved to the point that it can hardly be described as lo-fi any longer. We Live in Rented Rooms feels positively lush; despite the familiar, humble drum machines and no-frills strumming, its brimming with warm, comforting keyboards and quietly meticulous arrangements, projecting a calm, unassuming stateliness. 

With a few exceptions, its usually ambiguous how directly personal these songs are for Cornog -- when hes drawing specifically from his own notoriously troubled life experiences and when hes looking further outside himself -- but its ultimately insignificant. What matters is that this is some of the most economical and effective songwriting of his career, bolstered as always by his appealingly understated delivery and gorgeously crafted musical settings. In short: another astounding, resounding East River Pipe triumph.
