[T],eXPer1ence,2011-02-21T14:44Z,"Can anyone that has seen this confirm whether it mentions Rothschild or not? If not, why is anyone even watching it? Because Matt fucking Damon is in it? Please, get a grip! Its about time we boycotted Hollywood and these fucking big name actors, unless they are going to tell the truth and show some history that explains why things are the way they are, especially where finance is concerned. Try listening to the shows on iamthewitness.com"
,eXpl0sive,2011-02-21T15:06Z,Thanks a lot!
,mccawii,2011-02-22T17:40Z,Thank you So Much been waiting for this
,18_widda_bullit,2011-02-22T21:18Z,"I second eXPer1ience. Can confirm that name ""Rothschild"" does not get mentioned even once. 

Anyway I think it's worth watching just too see those sneaky little corrupted academic fags shitting their pants in front of the camera... 

This shit has to end soon.. It really went far beyond any common sense and logic..

For the raw unpolished stuff check out: ""the money masters"" and ""the corporation"". "
,R2d6.51,2011-02-22T22:14Z,"I have been checking this site every sgl day waiting for this doc to come out on PB.
TY SOOOOOOOO much.
This a great public service to provide more oxymoron truth of living in an inverted totalitarian corporate state.

When will a doc come out on the Coup de tat of the U.S. House when they voted ""No"" then reversed themselves after Paulson told them Martial Law would be declared by Bush and FEMA would be activated. A Revolution to destroy this Neoliberalist Capitalist Corporate State is a moral act of saving this once dear Democracy."
,nautilu5,2011-02-23T07:09Z,"Can someone do the world community a favor and ""terminate"" all these crooks, because it appears evident that they stole gross amounts of capital from the entire world, they do not seem to believe they did anything misappropriate, and no capable authority is holding them accountable.  Bin Laden, these are your true enemies; the ones that control those that control."

,bleak_7,2011-02-25T08:51Z,"@eXPer1ence

You're so right brother. I have been sceptical ever since Rothschild funded the fake moon landing and the assassination of Jesse James (cowards indeed).

Never fear! I have foreseen that our Alien Brethren will be with us on the 47th of Jelember to pickle our cats.

Keep Doubting my friend!"
,1heC00lGuy,2011-02-25T10:04Z,"Trusted eXPer1ence@ i didnt know mat damon narrated it until i stared watching. but it was a good movie, 
and yes i agree they should said something about the Rothschild."

,Herr_Doberman,2011-03-10T03:48Z,thanks for the upload ray :)
,bobbyewing2,2011-03-12T11:47Z,"Good copy and a good movie. The scope of the movie is restricted to the chain of events before and during the crash and is reasonably factual and informative. The owner's clique behind the financial system and their ideology is not tackled but that's kind of hard to do anyway without entering conspiracy territory. The movie does not tell the whole story, including how the system is intentionally set up to move real wealth from the middle class to the banksters - but the omission does not seem to be 'malicious' in any way. The last part that deals with the corruption of the economist profession is very interesting. That issue needs to receive more attention. On the whole a good and informative movie and a must see for those who want to know who stole the world's wealth, how they did it and how they are still doing it. I'll be seeding it for a long time."
,Nergalsyn,2011-03-23T17:48Z,US politicians aught to be ashamed at how they let these wall street fuckers get away with financial terrorism of the american people and others around the world. Peace to the uploader. 
,Autarchus,2011-03-24T04:34Z,What a bunch of liberal tripe
,tcollacott,2011-03-27T05:48Z,Thaks!!!!
,hdogg007,2011-04-02T02:11Z,I thought is was a pretty fair analysis of most of what went down.  Both parties in the US shoulder the blame for the economic meltdown.  What's a shame is that nothing has changed...
