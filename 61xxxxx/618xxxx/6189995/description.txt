                Du Plessis starts a one-man vandalism campaign
                against the mining company. Peeters asks Danny to
                take a look at some of the animals at Mara and Danny
                flatly refuses. However, on discovering a dead baby
                elephant savaged by hyenas on Mara land, Alice
                realises that they must relocate some of the hyenas
                or risk other animals being attacked. When Peeters
                suggests they move the hyenas on humanely, the
                Trevanions think they may have misjudged him.
