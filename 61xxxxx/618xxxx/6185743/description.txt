The Psychedelic Furs - Love My Way [promo].VOB


Very HQ rare promo music video. "Love My Way" is a 1982 song by English band The Psychedelic Furs from their third studio album, Forever Now. Written by the four members of the group and produced by Todd Rundgren, the song reached the top 10 of the charts in New Zealand and the top 50 in the United Kingdom and United States.

Released in 1982, "Love My Way" peaked at number nine in New Zealand, where it spent 21 weeks on the chart. The song peaked at number 42 in the UK and number 44 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number 30 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart and number 40 on the Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart.
 
Allmusic writer Ned Raggett called it "one of the slyest and best singles from the early '80s, a deserved cult hit in the States well-remembered in modern rock circles." Raggett praised the song's "big and crisp" beats provided by drummer Vince Ely, in one of his last credited songs before leaving the group.
 
The song featured on the soundtrack of 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, on new wave radio station Wave 103.

The Psychedelic Furs are an English rock band founded in 1977. Led by singer Richard Butler and his brother Tim on bass guitar, the Psychedelic Furs are one of the more successful acts spawned from the British post-punk scene. Their music went through several phases, from an initially austere art rock sound, later touching on New Wave and hard rock.

They scored several hits in their early career, but were launched to international attention in 1986 when the film director John Hughes borrowed their song title "Pretty in Pink" for his movie of the same name. A newly recorded version of the song became the Psychedlic Furs' biggest hit to that time. "Heartbreak Beat" from their 1987 album Midnight to Midnight, was to be the Furs' biggest Top 40 entry in the US.

The Psychedelic Furs went on hiatus in 1991, and the Butler brothers formed a new band called Love Spit Love. The Psychedelic Furs later regrouped in 2001 and continue to perform around the world.
