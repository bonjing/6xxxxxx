Part 2. The Americas
Justin crosses Brazil and the United States on an epic journey. In Rio, local industries, including bikini factories, are threatened by cheap Chinese imports. In the Amazon, Justin witnesses the phenomenal impact of the Chinese hunger for resources on the indigenous people and the environment. In the US, from California to the rust belt, Justin encounters the rising undercurrent of American fury over their own decline in the face of competition from China.
