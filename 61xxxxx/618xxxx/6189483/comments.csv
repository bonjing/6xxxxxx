,RipOrDie999,2011-02-22T16:02Z,Some screens and seeds would be great. 
,mikeox26,2011-02-23T03:58Z,Not sure how to do a screen...new to this any help?
,tornadokat,2011-02-26T04:34Z,Ignore his request for screens... those are for previewing a movie. You've just got a few pictures. But putting one of the pictures up on a site and posting a link here is appreciated so people can get an idea if they want to go through the trouble of downloading the torrent and loading it in their torrent downloading program just to get a few pictures.
