,forgeuk,2011-02-26T00:23Z,Is it actually a TeleSync or is it a CAM with TS in the title like SO MANY cams!
,forgeuk,2011-02-26T00:59Z,"Dear Pirate movie makers, ""TS"" means TeleSync, a machine that transfers film into video. It does not mean: Put a CAMera in front of a screen, video it and then totally fuck up the aspect ratio when transcoding it.
In other words, this is another CAM, worse than the other one that doesn't have subtitles, as the aspect ratio is wrong. Yes, I know, what do I expect for nothing, but come on, label it CAM+SUB+FUCKED-UP ASPECT RATIO, or just fuck off and don't bother uploading your crap.

Thanks."

Does TS not just the audio?  Or do you have another reason for being a FUCK NUT!  "
,wishmasteruk,2011-03-01T22:43Z,"TELESYNC (TS)
A telesync is the same spec as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for hard of hearing people). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality."
