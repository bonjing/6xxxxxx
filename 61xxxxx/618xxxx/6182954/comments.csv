his friend Shady won't be posted at my account till it's clear what the problem is.

For now once again: use this at own risk."

,Blackvosh,2011-05-08T02:37Z,"I having problems with the install.  At the very end of the install it said ""Installation Failed"" & explained that N360 detected some kind of error which prevents it from installing.  I unplugged my internet.  Nothing.  I've tried the Norton Power Eraser-it didn't detect anything.  I've tried the Norton Removal Tool program.  Same problem.  Ran the NTR to purge any old Norton programs.  And I get the same installation failed problem.  Do you have any suggestions besides doing a fresh install of Windows 7(86x)?  Which is a last resort.  I was able to installed NIS 2011 v18.5.0.125 with the NTR 3.3.1 & I got the 120 day subscription!"

According to your posts at my other torrents obviously you've got a reading problem. 

No problem, cause I know what your other problem is as well and I know who you are ....."
,tannerman,2011-07-10T23:53Z,"robbinghood, your so full of bullshit. this arabian crack included in YOUR torrent blacklisted and locked my norton 360 5.0 twice!

That's why I gave you a -1 vote. and im not lying.
