It must be jealousy.
Just for that, I gave you a +5 20.40, your encodes kick ass...
Keep up the good work. "

I see, as I write this 56 plus votes to 3 minus. 

Thanks to all the 'plus' votes. It would be great if you would write a few words of 'thanks' also but that's up to you.

This is for the 'minus' votes.

You don't have to DL any of the work of 20-40.
If you do - don't you fucking dare give it a 'minus' based on your silly opinion of how something should look/sound. Although I know it is just the video with you idiots. You pixel counting/sitting 2 inches from a big screen fuckheads. 

You just don't understand how much effort has gone into the encoding of a BR movie  down to 500MB and still be 720p. 

So FUCK OFF! If you see any 720p encodes from 20-40 DON'T Download it as you will obviously be fucking disappointed.
