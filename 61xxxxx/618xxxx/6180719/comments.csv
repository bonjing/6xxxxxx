Tolkien himself might have been fascinated as it i is said  one of his aims was to create a mythology of Britain, which has no elaborate mythology such as the greeks, the norse, etc.  A work treating it as if it really were a human mythology might have been a joy to him. Personally I enjoy the  alternative world Tolkien created and have no desire to read an imaginary deconstruction of ""what really happened"" in our  non-magical world w/o elves, wizards and rings of power. The real world surrounds me. To each his own and may you find your way as pleasant."

Thanks for this upload,  and such a wonderful perspective on a most enjoyable fantasy.  

Will seed till December 21st,  2012.  Then,  as you all know,  everything will be moot."

The translation was excellent,  and there were very few,  only one I recall that stuck out,  grammatical errors.  

Thanks a bunch."
