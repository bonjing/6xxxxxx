HARRY'S REASONS
vSpy vSpy's first album recorded at the old Albert's Studios on King St Sydney with Lezsek Karski producing. It was our first experience making an album, and we had no idea what we were doing so thank God Lezsek was there to guide us along. As rough as it is, many Spy supporters consider it their favourite Spy album of all time. There's "something about" a bands first album isn't there? That seminal experience of a bands first recording.
