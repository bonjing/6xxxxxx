Description

------------------

Charlie Chaplin entered movies in 1914. In 1916 he became the highest paid entertainer in the world, when he signed a contract with the Mutual Film Corporation for a salary of $670,000. Mutual built Chaplin his very own studio and allowed him total freedom to make twelve two-reel films during this fruitful twelve-month period. Chaplin subsequently recognized this period of film-making as the most inventive and liberating of his career.



The films have all been restored and mastered from the best available materials. This exclusive edition of the Mutual Films also features brand new scores, written and recorded by acclaimed silent film composer Carl Davis.
