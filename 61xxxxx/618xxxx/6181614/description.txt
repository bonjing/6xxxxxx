      Steet Fighter Alpha 2 and Super Street Fighter 2 The New Challengers PC
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Street Fighter Alpha 2, known as Street Fighter Zero 2 in Japan, Asia and South America, is a 1996 fighting game originally released for the CPS II arcade hardware by Capcom. The game is both a sequel and a remake to the previous year's Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, which is itself a prequel to the Street Fighter II series in terms of plot and setting. The game featured a number of improvements over the original, such as new endings, stages, moves and gameplay systems.


Gameplay
--------
Street Fighter Alpha 2 retains most of the new features introduced in the original Street Fighter Alpha, such as the three-level Super Combo gauge, Alpha Counters, Air-Blocking and Fall Breaking. The main new feature in the game is the inclusion of the Custom Combo system (Original Combo in Japan), which replaces the Chain Combos from the first Alpha. If the Super Combo gauge is on Lv. 1 or above, the player can initiate a Custom Combo pressing two punch buttons and a kick simultaneously (or vice versa). The player can then perform any series of basic and special moves to create a Custom Combo until the Timer Gauge at the bottom of the screen runs out. The only characters that can still perform Chain Combos in the game are Guy and Gen, but only to a limited extent. Additionally, each character now has two Alpha Counters instead of just one: one that can be performed with a kick button and another with a punch button.

The single-player mode, much like the original Street Fighter Alpha, consist of eight matches with computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player's selected character. Each character also has a secret "rival" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode after meeting certain requirements, in which then the rival will interrupt one of the player's regularly scheduled matches and exchange dialogue with the player's character. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed "Shin Akuma" replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike Super Turbo and the original Alpha, Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player's final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.

Characters
----------
All ten selectable characters from the original Alpha return, along with Bison, Akuma and Dan, who are now part of the immediate roster. The graphics for all of the returning characters' home stages, cut-scenes and endings have been completely redone.

Five additional characters are featured as well, extending the selectable roster to 18. The new characters includes Zangief and Dhalsim from Street Fighter II; Gen from the original Street Fighter; Rolento from Final Fight; and Sakura, an all-new character, a schoolgirl who idolizes Ryu and emulates his techniques.

Street Fighter Alpha 2 also features an alternate version of Chun-Li in her Street Fighter II outfit as a hidden character, as well as Shin Akuma, a more powerful version of Akuma who appears as a secret computer-controlled opponent in the single player mode. The US version of the arcade game also features three additional hidden characters who were not in the Japanese version: Evil Ryu, an alternate version of Ryu who uses the same power as Akuma; as well as extra versions of Zangief and Dhalsim who play like their counterparts from Street Fighter II': Champion Edition (including the omission of gameplay features such as super moves and air blocking).

Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers is a head-to-head fighting game produced by Capcom originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1993. It is the fourth arcade version of Street Fighter II produced, following the original Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. In addition to refining and balancing the existing character roster from the previous installments, Super Street Fighter II also introduced four new characters. It was also the first game to be developed on Capcom's CP System II hardware, which permitted more sophisticated graphics and audio over the original CP System hardware, used by the previous versions of Street Fighter II.

Super Street Fighter II was followed by Super Street Fighter II Turbo, a fifth version of Street Fighter II released during the following year 1994, which further refined the balance between characters and introduced additional new features.

Graphics and audio
------------------
All of the stages, face artwork and even the HUD feature all new graphics. The original opening sequence which featured Joe and Mike from the original Street Fighter fighting in front of a crowd[1] was replaced by a new opening featuring the lead character Ryu launching a Hadoken projectile towards the screen. New animation frames were drawn for all the characters for their basic and special moves, as well as new victory poses. For example, all four boss characters now have new animation frames for basic attacks (Vega and Sagat, did not have jumping punches in the previous games, and Bison and Balrog had new drawn artwork), while Chun-Li now has a new animation for her Kikoken projectile technique. The music and sound effects were also remade and new voice samples were recorded for some of the characters (Ken, Guile, and the announcer were given new voices).

Characters
----------
All twelve characters from the previous Street Fighter II games returned, with many them having their basic and special techniques refined in order to adjust the overall balance. Some of the characters received new special techniques such as Ryu's Shakunetsu Hadoken, a flaming Shoryuken for Ken, Zangief's Atomic Buster and M. Bison's Devil Reverse.

Four new characters were also introduced to the game in addition to the returning roster, expanding the number of playable characters to sixteen. The new characters include T. Hawk, an indigenous warrior from Mexico whose ancestral homeland was taken from him by Shadaloo; Cammy, a 19-year-old female special forces agent from England with a mysterious past tied to M. Bison; Fei-Long, a Hong Kong movie star who wishes to test his martial arts against real opponents; and Dee Jay, a kickboxing musician from Jamaica seeking inspiration for his next song.

The number of opponents fought in the single-player mode against the computer remained unchanged. As in the previous game, the player fought against eight initial opponents, followed by the Four Devas (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, and M. Bison). Because of this, not all the characters featured in the game would be fought by the player. The bonus rounds from previous versions were still featured in the game.

Other new features
------------------
Super Street Fighter II features a new scoring system which kept track of combos, first attacks, reversals and recoveries made by the player and awards the player with bonus points by performing such deeds.

Each character now has available eight color schemes, depending on which button is pressed to select the character. Players could choose between a character's original color scheme, their color schemes from Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, or one of five new color schemes featured in the game.

The faster game speed introduced in Hyper Fighting was removed and the gameplay was reduced back to the same speed level from Champion Edition. The hyper fighting feature would soon return the following year for SSF2T.
