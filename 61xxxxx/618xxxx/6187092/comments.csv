,pharaohrocks,2011-03-23T05:35Z,"This works but don't set up the automatic Task thing. It installs two trojans which if you have UAC enabled, you can prevent them from activating. The first is messenger.exe which will be located in some OFF location, before you say NO to the UAC prompt, click on View Details to find the location. The second is winlogon.exe. Which I found in the c:\windows folder. You have to go into Folder Options to un-tick hide system folders and view hidden files to find both of these. Once I deleted them, they no longer appeared. I'm not sure if it was from setting up the Task automatically or just running this tool in general. Though it works not too happy about those trojans. But if you know what you're doing, there's no worry. Just make sure you have UAC and a virus protection program installed to catch any mishaps. I am also using MSE which thankfully stopped those items in their tracks."

,pupuhd,2011-04-13T02:32Z,"Ok, I'm no expert, but for all those having the same issue as I did with the 'no rearms detected' try and disable your firewall then install IORRT and see if it installs. Then check the Status, if it gives you the grace period then re-enable your firewall. It worked for me with v3.5 and now Office 2010 is working fine with no activation issues.

I have this running on three separate machines and only one installed with no issues at first. The second one I did the above and works now. I haven't messed with the third machine to see if my trick above will also work.

Hope this helps anyone out there and thethingy thnx for the great downloads.......Excellent as always."

,Gh057man,2011-05-19T06:02Z,"When installing Office Standard x64 I was concerned about the Trojan (Trojan.ADH) that my Norton Security detects. This is a worm that ""replaces an existing Windows system file named services.exe with a copy of itself. Trojan.ADH spreads to other computers by copying itself to removable drives. The worm also installs a key logger that captures user-entered keystrokes and sends the data to a remote server.""
I switched my virus detection off to allow installation as I believed it prevented a legitimate key generator from doing its thing.
However, after installation of Office I did a full system virus scan. NAV found 14 infected files (in the ISO's updates folder) where each MSP file was infected. Can anyone confirm %100 these are false positives? "

Firstly, XP Home Edition does not have schtasks.exe which is an MS program part of other XP versions. Result: IORRT will just not install coz it needs this program. Get it here:  http://snakefoot.fateback.com/tweek/winnt/files/schtasks.zip  Then unzip into your C:/WINDOWS/System32 folder  and presto you can install IORRT 3.5 and it works on XP Home.

This will work perfectly, though you need to place a missing file that is not included in this version. 
Commentor Snozzle is 100% right, though his links to download the file no longer work.
1. Download this torrent
2. download schtasks.exe from here - http://download.corrupteddatarecovery.com/free-download/schtasks.exe?c=5yWwElXWrNExMBJqo%2bpNKH%2bD5%2bmO75M9VGE6eXMvxtZQbe52AJD%2b0Vj9Nws8ifVejiViTwAwGyVJbkxyxKQHvw%3d%3d
3. Add schtasks.exe to C:\WINDOWS\system32
4. Doublck click on IORRT 3.5
5. Type in A and press enter
6. AI voice will announces completion within a minute.
