Title: A Stormy Night (Arashi No Yoru Ni)
Audio: English/Japanese -- Dolby Digital 2.0
Subtitles: English/Spanish (Latin America)


I take no credit for the content of this file. The movie itself was obtained from THORA Anime, and I merely added the english audio circulating around the web and the LA Spanish subtitles which I did personally make. 

Nonetheless I wish to thank the StormyNightDubProject for such a fantastic job at making a high quality and enjoyable english dub. If you liked it, I encourage you to visit this guy's youtube page and send him your regards (he pretty much voiced all the characters). 

May this little work of art pull at your heartstrings like it did to me.

Enjoy!
