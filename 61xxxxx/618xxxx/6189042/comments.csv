,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-20T19:15Z,"one of my torrents is getting bad rep. because the file size is really small, please go support it ""Borderlands And all DLC"" the reason its not that big is because its a double torrent, the first torrent will download a picture and a torrent, the second torrent is the full game and all dlc's. I had to upload it this way because I uploaded the other one earlier but accidentally deleted it, when I tried to post it again the site kept saying the torrent was already on the server, please help me out, everything I post is legit, I may give nothing back to the copy write owners, but I give everything to you, the pirates.

Sincerely, 
GiveNothingBack"
