[V],mirogster,2011-02-20T16:58Z,"About bad quality(not avi as other might say). Ohh Yes Honey, I know :(. Guys once more, I'm not living in Canada, therefore I can't get better quality(hd tv rip --> decent avi). What I have = web rip stuff = crappy quality :( - but still watchable. Sorry that's the truth. 
It's a SHAME that noone from Canada can upload better quality. Well that's why ~BLAME CANADAAAAaaa ;)!!!"
