,frobknob,2011-02-20T16:55Z,"I had a copy of the REAL Anarchist's Cookbook (the printed version, look it up on Wikipedia) - and it was bullshit back then. The internet has simply allowed the bullshit to multiply and increase.

Like they say on TV: Don't try this at home :)"
,nil7,2011-02-20T17:18Z,":SickAddict you are absolutely right :) The Anarchist's cookbook are know for having faulty receipts that either will not work, or explode in your face.

Use the US army guides instead:
