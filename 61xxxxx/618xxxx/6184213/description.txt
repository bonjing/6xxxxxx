Working at an import/export logistics company with clients in Germany means that Mick has to hit the phones early to do business. Wanting to make his first day on the job a great one, co-worker Julia Ann brings him coffee, and then sits down and starts staring at him. Stopping his conversation to see if she needs anything she waves him off, but keeps sitting and staring. Finally he canâ€™t take it anymore, cuts his call short, and asks her once again if he can help her with anything. She mentions that the call seemed intense, and that on his first day he already seems a little stressed. Massaging his shoulders a little, he starts to get nervous, and tries to get back to work, but she isnâ€™t having it. Donâ€™t worry she says, itâ€™s 6:30 in the morning and theyâ€™ve got the whole office to themselves. Why not start his new job with some early morning sex? Seems like a great start to the day. If only he knew that she is actually his boss!
