 PLOT:
 "From the moment I was born I cried for a month..." Eighteen
 years on, and Justin is no nearer the truth. And in a world that
 increasingly doesn't care, maybe just simply relying on
 friendship is not enough? Especially with friends like Billy,
 Sean and Tommy. Set amongst the backdrop of the towering,
 concrete-clad estates of south London 'Zebra Crossings' blends
 a diverse mixture of characters that all share one thing in
 common: The incredible loneliness of living alongside 7 million
 other people. Blending the surreal, and very real, we take an
 intense journey in search of friendship, belief and religion.
 With a lacklustre father and estranged mother, Justin's only
 source of perennial control comes from an unlikely source, his
 bed-ridden sister Suzanne. But Justin needs is a real mentor, a
 father figure, someone who can provide guidance before it's all
 too late. In steps Marcus, unlike anyone Justin has ever known
 before, calm, soft, assured - but does he want something from
 Justin? Meanwhile, Tommy's abandonment issues haunt him once
 again, and his class-A drug addiction has sent him into full
 destruction mode. Also, the pressure from a rival gang has
 reached exploding point - as there is certainly no space for
 two crews in this neighbourhood. Justin must find the answer
 to it all, and quick.
