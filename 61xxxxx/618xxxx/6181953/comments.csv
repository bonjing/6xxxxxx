But what is that comment about losdrivaren? Or you talking to the uploader privately? "

,filevans,2012-01-17T01:46Z,i don't understand if this is the director's cut from 1993 or the recently remasted final cut from 2007? why can't you be clearer??
,filevans,2012-01-17T23:06Z,"i recommend to look for another rip as the resolution is abysmal, 608x246 and the aspect ratio is bad too, peoples faces are stretched width ways slightly 

basically, crap rip"
