Why don't you just post the pics as is?

It would be easier for everybody and the quality would be better. In pdf there sh_t!

,bart001fr,2011-02-22T19:37Z,"Even if you extract the pics from the PDFs the pics are greatly degraded in quality, not to mention they're smaller than the JPGs.

That's why it is stupid for the poster to send them that way when JPGs will do better.

All he needs to do is zip them if he wants to send only one file. 

And do NOT use a password on the zip.
