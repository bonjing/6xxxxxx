,snotbroth,2011-02-25T08:29Z,DAZ Loader doesn't work with Enterprise edition bud.
,Talley777,2011-03-06T16:06Z,"It is not working.You need to review your code.
I show 30 days trial after i run this loader .Most loaders like DAZ or Chachito auto set the genuine windows logo and you can activate it with Microsoft.
Thank you for hard work but you need more power to you code. "

Doesn't work dude"
,gimotan12,2011-12-18T20:52Z,"if its not working try to edit it, then copy on a notepad, save as ""activator.cmd"" or any kind of name but with an extension of .cmd. Run as administrator. i've notice that you get an error in the select ip/server ip, if you got an error, run it again then try other ip server. it works for me. If its success it will tell you that activation is successfull, then if you really want to know that you've pass this activation GOOGLE XP MODE (dont download it) if your in this site it will prompt you to install activeX (WGA) dont be afraid... install it....then it will tells you that validation is successfull....you now have a genuine win7 enterprise.


thanks for the uploader/////...."
