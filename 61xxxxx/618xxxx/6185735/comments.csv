,capnjazz,2011-02-19T20:30Z,367 seeders and not a single comment or rating? 
,afn09,2011-02-19T22:37Z,try fuckin downloading it then and post yourself instead of moaning. not even 1 gig file. go on live a little!
,michaelrwatson,2011-02-19T23:22Z,@afn09  You are a clueless shit. The whole point in ratings is to save thousands of people from having to download it if it's shyte quality.
,afn09,2011-02-19T23:50Z,"michaelrwatson. i couldnt agree more but if there aint any comments try it yourself to help others instesd of moaning, leaving comments complaining and bypassing it leaving it for others, thats selfish you clueless shit"
,afn09,2011-02-20T00:15Z,if everyone moaned there is no comments we would have no comments! someone has to try. 
,michaelrwatson,2011-02-20T00:19Z,"@afn09 Hey, you just called yourself a clueless shit. Follow..?  ""capnjazz"" was the one doing the complaining, though he had a point... 300+ seeders and no ratings means something is wrong. I am downloading it now (700kbps DSL) and will post comments when i'm done."

I know that won't discourage anyone who just has to watch this for free tonite.... but the video has rolling flicker--fairly bad in the bright scenes, of which there are many. Audio is okay, but I just deleted the file. Btw, those other 1.4GB versions use the same video :("
,afn09,2011-02-20T00:48Z,"michaelrwatson. i didnt want to download this particular torrent, i just checked the comment and thought it was a little rich. otherwise i would have downloaded it and commented which i have done on many ""commentless"" torrents. fed up with seeing people asking moaning or demanding comments instead of giving it a go especially with such small file sizes. if everyone was like that we would get nowhere."
,afn09,2011-02-20T00:49Z,respect to you for having the balls and being the first.
