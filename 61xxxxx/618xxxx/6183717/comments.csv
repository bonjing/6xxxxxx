,billylopez,2011-02-18T18:47Z,"where is the imdb link?????
all i could find was a movie from 2006 with the exact same actors in the film.. when you search for this movie something else comes up so i think this may be the 2006 movie and not a 2011 movie like it says here"

,dubblue,2011-02-20T12:55Z,"think you're right, billylopez. i can't find a link either, except the 2006 version. is the AV any good?"
,rtghrtyzx,2011-02-20T20:28Z,"The IMDB referens ""if you like this"" is a treat. Who in the right mind would like to see cheap Chuck and Rampo clones made in Turkey? "

,Minist3r,2011-04-07T08:16Z,"If you haven't had a good laugh for a long time, watch this.

Low budget, poor acting, inter alia so a -11 from my side (and people say I'm overgenerous)."
,MrBaltazar,2011-04-09T06:03Z,"Bad actors, bad story. A total waste of time to watch. Rubbish is what it is."
