Basically this is a somewhat rare Latvian thrash metal band's only studio album that wasn't available here, nor even on amazon.com. This is available locally (in Latvia) and on e-bay, but it still pops up only time to time. So you might as well download it either for enjoyment and exploration of this band or to see for your self it this is any good.
