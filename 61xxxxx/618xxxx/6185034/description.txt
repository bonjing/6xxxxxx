IMAGiNE NOTES:
First of all thanks to our
mate TaRiQ786 for the source files... :) With this one we needed to do some cropping and rotating, we also made a script up to adjust the whate balance, gamma, brightness, colors and ran a denoise and a sharpening filter. Turned out nice...  Now the audio was just a straight mux  of the cam audio which is very nice for cam audio...:) FYI there are times when people get up and walk in front of the cam. You have been warned... Anyway enjoy folks ....
