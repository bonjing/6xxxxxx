,TyMod,2011-02-19T15:04Z,"Your welcome, return the favor and please seed.  And I will look into them for you. :)"
,TyMod,2011-02-19T15:24Z,"I forgot to explain this also:
For installing DLC you need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure the game folder is titled Mass Effect.

2. Move it to your Program Files (C:\Program Files)

3. Install the DLC.  The game is fully up-to-date.

4. Goto the back-ups folder copy the crack and paste it in the binaries folder.

Play the game! :)"

,TyMod,2011-02-19T23:52Z,"@elturbo9077 

It will problebly be 2 days before I can download a ISO and work on it.  But I will definatly look at it when I can. I am seeding 2 of my torrents, my Halo 2 torrent and this one.  All by myself too at this point so I need to let some people download them and have them help me seed before I do anything else.  There are about 2 or 3 people with only a little bit more to go before they finish downloading Mass Effect.  When they are done I'll work on Sacred 2."

,TyMod,2011-02-22T04:31Z,"YOU GUYS NEED TO HELP SEED.  You want games and stuff yet you won't help seed.  This game was a bitch to get to work and especially to update it and get it compatible with windows 7 64 bit.  Please help me seed!!!

,mike504,2011-03-01T21:23Z,"does anyone get ""general protection fault!"" when you try to start the game up? i Have a windows 7."
,TyMod,2011-03-04T22:30Z,Use google to look up the error or re-extract the RAR file man.
,rezor664,2011-03-15T20:55Z,"If this works, then I will definitely seed it. Thanks for this, I'm really looking forward to playing."
,rezor664,2011-03-18T01:10Z,"Works perfectly, no crack needed."
,TyMod,2011-03-19T03:25Z,Glad it worked!!! :)
,lols_rofl,2011-04-03T00:05Z,"So it seems to be working just to clarify about the DLC stuff:

I put the Mass Effect folder into the Program Files (x86) folder, should I move it to the regular program files for the DLC to work? Also, is the DLC in this torrent or do I need to download it still (nothing happened when I clicked downloadable content in the game)."
,TyMod,2011-04-03T00:33Z,"You must download a torrent with the DLC to get it.  It is not provided.

To install the DLC on 64 bit computers move it to the Program Files (x86) folder.

Hope this helps... :)"

,roxas_13,2011-06-15T02:26Z,excuse me for asking something so noobing but what is DLC?? you need it to play the game?? :O sorry for my ignorance!!! :/
,9Rain,2011-06-21T03:26Z,ok now i would seed but i dont know how... can some one please explain?. :)
,KwadLazer,2011-07-05T08:57Z,@ roxas_13 your excused :). DLC means Downloadable Content. Usually these are just expansions on the game when people refer to these. And your other question... no u do not need these to play the game. Feel free to ask any other questions :). I like to look out for the little people.
,KwadLazer,2011-07-05T08:59Z,@ 9rain... dude u can just upload it in ur torrent program and it should automatically seed. u should seed at least till ur ratio is at 1.

I searched all over man. Google, Bing, and Yahoo and all I could figure out is that the DLC installer cant find the game folder because technically the game isn't ""installed"" on the computer.  Sorry about not knowing this.  If you can, find a disc image that works and install the game to use the DLC. So sorry..."

,TyMod,2011-07-11T21:38Z,Just recrack the game by downloading the 1.2 crack off of GameCopyWorld.com
,slappyme,2011-07-25T21:38Z,this is one of the fastest Mass Effect torrents i have found it took only 9 hours
,TyMod,2011-07-26T18:36Z,lol Idk if I would call that fast but glad you got it.  :) I downloaded it at a friends house for him and it took an hour.  (1.5 Mbps constant)  Glad it works for you though.
,TyMod,2011-08-06T03:37Z,"DLC INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

About my pass instructions.  They were wrong. lol My bad.  You must FIRST install the reg file located in the Mass Effect folder. (Registry.reg). Then copy or move the Mass Effect folder to either C:\Program Files\Mass Effect for 86 Bit computers or C:\Program Files (x86)\Mass Effect for 64 Bit computers.  Then you MUST goto the Back-Ups folder and copy the ORIGINAL MassEffect.exe over the crack in the Bineries folder.  After doing so you are now ready to install DLC.

Tell me how this works!!!

,Gauchen,2011-08-08T23:31Z,"Downloading pretty slow, around 120kb/s average. SEED PLEASE!!!!

,TyMod,2011-08-09T06:48Z,Alright.  And no one complains because it works.  Look at my Halo 2 torrent to man.  Wanna talk about a game with hardly any complaints. For one of the hardest games to crack almost no one has had issues getting it to work with the crack fix.

,BrickyBrixx,2011-08-17T11:18Z,"@TyMod
Right now I was playing your upload but what makes me confuse is "" sorry I am just an amature downloader"" but I want to ask where I could find that DLC? What I have done is I extracted all the file in the folder name Mass Effect, paste the crack to the binary folder and play. Do I need that DLC still? I was maybe in the 1\4 part of the game...sorry for my stupidity but I will seed this absolutely."
,TyMod,2011-08-17T21:49Z,"You don't need dlc, if you want it I just listed the instructions.  If you want the DLC I think someone uploaded Bring Down the Sky on here.  But I can't find Pinnacle Station.  "

,Botter123,2011-08-21T21:48Z,"Thanks for the upload. Fast download speed, no installing, just unrar and play and the fact it was already patched.
As for the game itself, i have to say, it was horrible. It could have been a great game, but it had so many flaws. The fact you cannot skip the cut-scenes (wich there are alot of). Altough you can modify a config file to allow you to skip them, you risk having a crash if you skip the wrong one. The Overheating glitch, wich can make the game unplayable. The fact you spend more time in elevators/other means of transportation than in acutal fights. And a dozen other minor glitches.
Sorry for going on a rant, i usually never comments on things, but i just felt that i had to.
And once again this is not directed at the uploader in any way, you did a great job."
,BrxbombersNY,2011-08-22T17:59Z,hey I am new to all of this and I am have trouble starting the game 
,BrxbombersNY,2011-08-22T18:25Z,never mind I got it
,TyMod,2011-08-22T23:28Z,The games amazing.  Flaws = HELL YEAH. You can't skip the cutscenes because they are interactive.  I think this is one of the best RPGs of all time.  Just my opinion though.  You are entitled to yours.  Glad it worked and glad to have gone through hell to patch it and to find a working crack patch that worked. :)
,BrxbombersNY,2011-08-24T19:16Z,I was wondering if there was a way around the general protection fault
,TyMod,2011-08-24T22:40Z,"It means your graphics card is unsupported.  Or, if using Windows 7 64 Bit you have to run the game in Compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3.

According to Google the reason you get that SPECIFIC erro is because the game is cracked. lol  Easy fix though.  Place the original MassEffect.exe over the cracked one, and then Repatch it then reapply the crack OR you could just recrack it and see if that works.

Theres three different things you could try.  Most likly while downloading someone seeded you bad info and the crack was messed up."
,TyMod,2011-08-29T22:56Z,"http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbyerrormessage/a/binkw32dll.htm  You can read about it there.  It will tell you about the Bink32.dll which many times causes errors with all games.  Many people have issues with bink so believe me, its not just you or the game release.  You can download the RAD Game tools for free, just search google for it.  They give the Bink tools out for free so no need to pirate them.  That could also fix the problem."

,TyMod,2011-09-13T05:34Z,"Your welcome.  And if you are referring to when your guns overheat and then they don't cool down then no it doesnt fix it. :( Pissed me off so bad.  And they will ofcourse not be fixing it since they dont support the game anymore.  My recommendation to you is to do short burst which s accurate and kills enemies the quickest.  Up to you man.  If you don't want to do that then learn to save ALOT so you can reload your saves when all your guns overheat and also upgrade all your weapons as often as you can so they do about the same amount of damage.  Either way it's all up to you.

and enjoy my favorite game of all times,

500 GB HDD
512 MB ATI Radeon 4XXX series graphics card.
when i had run this game earlier it ran smoothly. however after getting my system formatted(owing to crashing of my HDD) i upgraded to Vista Business. however now when i install the game and run it, i get the General protection Fault. Can you please help me out?
i currently have ME2 installed on my system and it runs perfectly fine."
,TyMod,2011-09-24T19:44Z,"ME1 calls for the game to be ran in compatibility mode for Windows XP on Vista and 7.  That should fix the issues.

You get a black screen becaus it is creating the game folder in My Documents.  LEave it alone (it can take anywhere from 3 to 5 mins to load).  It's not the fact its not responding, its just loading the game folders.  Thats a ported game for you.  Also if you keep clicking on the window and it does freeze it will not load or it will take longer, so leave it alone.

Hope this helps everyone."

When I check the Settings menu though it shows I have the DLC installed.  This is a issue with legit versions so you might not be able to get it installed at all or you won't get the correct notification to start it.

All I can say is after doing the steps I listed look up forums on how to install it because like I said.  Everyone has been having problems with it."

,TyMod,2011-11-24T03:27Z,"Don't.  Just unpack the game and play.  The backup crack is only to be used if the game is asking for a key.

If it ask for a key though first try to play it offline.
If it still ask for a key while offline than apply crack.

Otherwise, just extract the game and play. :)"

Sorry, I'm not going to reupload it.  Sorry.

Glad you like the game itself though.

If you have any other request then let me know.  I will see what I can do."
,soler37,2011-12-10T06:50Z,"hi tymod, first thanks for uploading this.
a question to u, after downloading this what else do i have to download/install, i havent played this game yet, also if i download the dlc's will they be integrated with the game, and what dlc's can i download? thanks."
,TyMod,2011-12-10T17:56Z,"Only one on here I think is the Bring Down the Sky DLC.  I posted a comment earlier about how to install it.  Look through the comments to find out how.

@ANY ONE WANTING ME TO DO MASS EFFECT 2.

I will do it if and only if I get 50 people to request it.  And this offer is only good until next weekend.  If I get 50 Request for Mass Effect 2 I will upload it on Sunday of next weekend.  Quite a few people have requested it but last time I did it it seemed no one would seed so this is the only way I know I will get seeds."

,TyMod,2012-01-16T01:12Z,"Karmas a bitch man.  Glad the game works but now your computers going to rot in hell. (I hate you too btw.)

But thanks for your worthless reply."
,brosis,2012-02-22T16:55Z,please seed! i donÂ´t even get up to 1kb/s download
,jmmy.cnnll,2012-04-08T00:14Z,"Legit Torrent!  I don't know how you did it, but it didn't need me install the game.  I just started up the exe and played :).  Best part is it saved all the data as normal so I could port my file to ME2"
,TyMod,2012-05-01T00:21Z,"Haha your welcome. And I used my own rip to play through it myself too. So I know it works.

Waiting for all the DLC and stuff to do ME3."
,Kelandis,2012-06-09T00:35Z,"The game plays fine for me, except for the sound.  don't know whether it is the computer i am playing on or the file was corrupted in transit. I'm re-downloading now to see if it is fixed, but if not would you kno how o fix this. It is really irritating as people will stop talking or there will just be constant interference."
,TyMod,2012-06-12T01:55Z,"Can't comment on that. Maybe a bad seed? No one else seems to be experiencing the problem. Your best option is google or doingas you have stated you already are, lol, redownloading it to see if that is the problem. If you can test it on another computer and see if your computer is the problem. Also in the configure tool go to audio and change the audio device from software to hardware."
