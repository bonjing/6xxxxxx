,lam4747,2011-02-19T23:26Z,Is it confirmed that the Pal version; like the US version; has all of the (intentional) slowdown removed?
,black_shadow_1981,2011-02-20T21:28Z,"ty but i wish people would seed, its selfish to just download and run!"
,lam4747,2011-02-21T18:01Z,"Just a comment on the slowdown. 
XBOX360 and 1.1 feel the same as the Japanese version to me. Perhaps a little faster in places.
Such a good package for the price. Considering with MBL and MBL1.1 the Japanese version of this cost me well over ÂŁ70.
Proper copy arriving tomorrow :)"
