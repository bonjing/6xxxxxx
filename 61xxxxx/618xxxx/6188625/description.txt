Carlos Santana and a host of his friends perform songs from his immensely popular SUPERNATURAL record at this concert, which was televised on Fox TV. Santana had not enjoyed the kind of popularity that this album brought him since the early 1970s, though he has released a number of great albums since then. As if to prove to the world that SUPERNATURAL is not a comeback, Santana and his guests perform songs from every era of his long career, illuminating the genius of Carlos's songwriting and guitar playing
