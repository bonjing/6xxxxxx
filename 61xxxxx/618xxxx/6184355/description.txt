There's no mountain man on here, but instead three well voiced females. This is a lovely amateurish collection of old American folk music.
On first listen, the debut from Mountain Man, an indie folk trio formed by singer/songwriters Molly Erin Sarle, Alexandra Sauser-Monnig, and Amelia Randall, sounds like a record of its time, especially amidst the current crop of bearded, northwest folkies (Fleet Foxes), Midwest romancers (Bon Iver), and English new traditionalists (Laura Marling). While Made the Harbor can hold its head high amongst the works of such company, its charms are drawn from a much deeper well.
