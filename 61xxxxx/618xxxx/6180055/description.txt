From Classic Records 45 RPM Led Zeppelin box, recorded and presented here as 24/96 FLACs. 
You will need to resample these files to create an audio CD. Here\'s an example of a sox command to do this:
sox \"01 Immigrant Song.wav\" -b 16 \"441/01 Immigrant Song.wav\" rate -s -a 44100 dither -s
This creates a 16/44.1 WAV in a subfolder called 441.

*Taken from Atlantic 45-2777 single using the same equipment and methods. 

600DPI scans of the front, back, and gatefold artwork are included. 

Enjoy.
