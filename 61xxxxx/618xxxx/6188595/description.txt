 Description:
 For a year a BBC team had exclusive access to the custody suite of Humberside 
 Police that specialises in hosting Hull's 2,000 young people who are arrested 
 annually.                                                                     
                                                                               
 This episode looks at how kids at the bottom of the pile are dealt with when  
 they are arrested and find themselves alone in the Lock Up. It's out of hours,
 there are no parents on the scene and no-one other than the busy custody team 
 to keep them company, apart from a bunch of violent, suicidal and hardened    
 adult criminals.                                                              
                                                                               
 The Lock Up is no place to be young and once they're in, one in three is      
 destined to reoffend. It's up to police and social services to get them back  
 on track. Sgt Dave Beer finds himself babysitting two regulars - two girls in 
 care, aged 11 and 12, one nicked for assault, the other for threatening to set
 fire to her care worker's hair. An 11-year-old first-timer, too small to reach
 the custody desk to sign his name, spends ten hours alone in the Lock Up      
 overnight.                                                                    
                                                                               
 The mum of a drunken 36-year-old visits the Lock Up and begs him to give up   
 the demon drink for the sake of his family and a teenager is nicked for       
 burgling the old age pensioner whose dog he walks.                            

                                Enjoy!
