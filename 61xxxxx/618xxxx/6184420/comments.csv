,iridis_alpha,2011-02-19T09:31Z,does this have the english subtitles for the french spoken parts? the NFO doesnt say.
,sparebank1,2011-02-19T15:18Z,"no english subs included. 

Learn french :b"
,nittany,2011-02-20T01:16Z,"No english subs for the french spoken parts?  I'll have to wait for another release then with hard coded subs, hate to miss parts of the movie cause you can't understand."
[V],aoloffline,2011-02-20T01:45Z,"    don't be so dramatic about subs :-)

there are good english subs for the whole movie at subtitles sites,for the french spoken part only not sure if yet available,check sub sites from time to time..

,dj3scobar,2011-02-21T00:51Z,"If you don't like his uploads, don't download. Most if not all I download  from aoloffline is either around 4gb for 720p and around 7-8gb for 1080p.

Stop complaining, and go download your 500mb disgustingly compressed movies."
,freeworkman3,2011-02-21T20:48Z,Or you could just upload the movie with the subs hardcoded when needed like scene releases. Most people watch the movies on their tv and have no use for a sub downloaded separately. And the size for 720p is right. Almost every 720p from anyone is 4gb.
,Kaskotur,2011-02-21T22:56Z,---Very bad seeding---
,DriverAus,2011-02-24T22:55Z,"Thx for upload!

Thanks Bubbah."
,bradass,2011-03-12T17:00Z,"hey douche bags, i watch on my tv with sub file.  what does a tv have to do with subs? you either have it or don't have it no matter what you watch it on. and the size, means you can convert and burn as blu-ray onto a dvdr with subs included.  so if it doesn't live up to ""your"" standards then move on.

thanks aoloffline"
,deftond,2011-03-30T20:03Z,why do people complain so much about subtitles..damn its not like you are buying this..stfu you ignorant asshole.  I never flame anyone but shit..come on.

,beetle004,2011-04-11T16:10Z,"This file has new cinavia DRM which means if you are gonna play this file on a ps3, then after 20 minutes or so into the movie you'll get a message ""cinavia message code 3"" and no audio. "
,954blade,2011-04-16T22:05Z,Thanks aol.
