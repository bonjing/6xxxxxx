,stcuk,2011-06-12T21:41Z,Does this work with Tom Tom 520? Thanks for the download. Steve
,KenTheAssassin,2011-06-15T23:32Z,"Works great on my 520, only thing I can't get to work is speed cams, downloaded on bbs and POI cat is there but no cams on map, any advice??"
,stobarttrucker,2011-06-18T18:20Z,you need to install the europe speed cams from bbs tools and activate them with the same software
,Bzerka,2011-07-18T19:45Z,"MMM... should I buy a Tomtom 720 with IQ and Truck for ÂŁ140 off of  Amazon, or should I save myself some hard to come by cash, and get one off of ebay and rely on this torrent to work? As a class 1 driver like yourself Stobarttrucker. I cannot take any chances with my navigation system. I would literately be lost without it!  :)
MMM.. what to do?"
,stobarttrucker,2011-08-10T20:38Z,"its your call bzerka,all i can say is it works fine for me,i made it as easy as possible to install,all it needs is a 4gb sd card as the full europe maps are rather large,you can get away with 2 gb if you remove the cspeech files before putting to card,good luck with whatever you decide mate."
