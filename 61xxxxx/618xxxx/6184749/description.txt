barryegan: "I haven't compared, but I just wanted to give the heads up that these are not new remasters. I haven't done enough research to determine whether these are the first Japanese masterings or the later "silent remasters" that Bob Ludwig did a bit later or something else altogether, but it's been determined that these masterings have been available on earlier pressings. And it does not include the 2005 30th Anniversary remaster of Born to Run or the 2010 remaster of Darkness on the Edge of Town (the peak values both match earlier CD pressings).

For what it's worth, here are the mastering credits included in the booklet:

GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK, N.J.
Mastering Engineer: Bob Ludwig (Remastering Engineer) / Brian Lee (Remastering Engineer)

BORN TO RUN
Mastering Engineer: Greg Calbi (all tracks except 5)

DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN
Mastering Engineer: Mike Reese

BORN IN THE U.S.A.
Mastering Engineer: Bob Ludwig / Brian Lee (Remastering Engineer) / Bob Ludwig (Remastering Engineer)

The other albums have no mastering credits.

Either way, these CDs sound fine, but Bruce's recordings have never been audiophile quality. I prefer the way some of these songs sound on the Bob Ludwig-mastered Essential Bruce Springsteen from 2003 (to my ears, the 2003 masterings sound a bit fuller). But this is still a really nice set and a great way to dig into early Springsteen."
