,omkleem,2011-03-12T20:18Z,"You must extract the .iso to hard drive. Do not mount image in virtual Drive or run from DVD.
Then follow Install Instructions.txt from ""A ACAD 32 PATCH"" folder"

,hdvtgsd,2011-03-20T11:50Z,"""Mem Patch"" wont work for me. :-(

I follow all instructions very carefully, but every time I click on ""Mem Patch"" I get the following error:
""You can only apply patch when Licence screen appears"".

And of course I click on ""xf-A201-64bits.exe"" when AutoCAD Licence Screen Appears.

Here's what I do:
- Totaly disconnect Internet, firewall, antivirus and antimallware.
- Install AutoCAD, and restart the PC after installation completes.
- Start AutoCAD, and right click on ""xf-A201-64bits.exe"", and Run As Administrator.
- When Licence Screen Appears, I click on ""Mem Patch"", and here comes the error: ""You can only apply patch when Licence screen appears"". :-(


So I ask you:
- What do I do wrong???
- Or is there another way to Apply patch???"
