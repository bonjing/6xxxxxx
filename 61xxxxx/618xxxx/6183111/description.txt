Synchronous Technology: Fulfilling the Vision

Synchronous technology is the only solution that can accelerate design creation by eliminating design pre-planning, speed engineering change orders (ECOs) by eliminating model regeneration, and improve reuse by editing imported computer-aided design (CAD) data like native models.


Engineering Simulation for More Real-World Conditions

Solid Edge Simulation includes more enhanced load and constraint types, model simplification for faster simulations, and synchronous technology for speeding design iterations.


Integrated CAD Data Management

Improved collaboration, through Solid Edge Insightâ„¢ on Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and Teamcenter Express integrated CAD data management solutions, provides transparent task and data management and integrates design data and processes with key business processes for a wider range of users.


Addressing Thousands of Customer Requests

Solid Edge ST3 is designed by engineers for engineers, so we have improved the depth and robustness of the entire application including design, applications, drafting and usability.
