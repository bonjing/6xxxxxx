,Chadly,2011-02-21T18:36Z,"@ Reserve   Try burning with a different program and or different kind of CD. Def sounds like something is happening while burning to a DVD. Also if its only happend with the one file, it could mean the file is corrupt abit, try downloading and burning another version or file of the movie. Could also be your PS3, that would suck lol probably not your PS3 tho :) Goodluck.."
,hah024,2011-02-21T22:05Z,Why burn it to watch with PS3? Use a flash drive to activate the video up scaling in the PS3 and you will have excellent quality. The quality is not as good if you burn it to watch.
