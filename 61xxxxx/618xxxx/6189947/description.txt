Kieran Darcy-Smith ... Warren


Luke welcomes his friend Matt and his girlfriend Suzie that come
from London and Matt's sister and Luke's former girlfriend Kate
that comes from Sydney to sail with him and the sailor Warren
in a sailboat. However, the vessel hits an underwater rock and
capsizes with an opening on her bottom. Luke advises that they
should swim in the north direction to reach the Turtle Island,
in Queensland, Australia, while they have strength since there
is a current moving the boat in the opposite direction of land
but Warren prefers to stay on the hull waiting for help since
there are sharks in the water. The quartet swims, but they are 
hunted by a great white shark.
