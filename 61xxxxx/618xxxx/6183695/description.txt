DEMOLITION 1: SQUAT
vSpy vSpy demo tapes from the very early years of the bands existence recorded in rehearsal rooms & gigs around Sydney, then painstakingly put together by Ian Marshall from Tronador records in Brasil. Ian has contributed more than we can ever thank him for in terms of preserving our history in the digital format. Without Ian, these recordings would be lost forever. These recordings were made on cassette tapes in the early â€˜80â€™s in various studios & rehearsal rooms and collected to be thrown into a corner, in an old brown cardboard box. Ian sifted through them all and made sense where no sense could be made and turned his favourite picks into digital cds. Ian Marshall, you're a legend. Thank you.
