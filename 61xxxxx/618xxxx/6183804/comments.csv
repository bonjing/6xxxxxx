,requim,2011-02-19T07:29Z,"AAC is better then mp3 at low bitrates, but they're essentially the same at 320 kb/s. AAC works on fewer devices, and is all around less common."
,Avengeance,2011-02-19T15:24Z,As if .m4a is any good!!!!!!!
,pacocrowley,2011-02-19T20:07Z,"Well of course it's better.. if you use a crappy quality. If you use VBR at highest quality, you can't perceive the difference between that and a FLAC."
