You could get more people enjoying your cam bootleg be it good or bad, if you'd get with the program and include even a 30 second cam sample."
,streeter93,2011-02-20T18:28Z,a/v anyone ...hope its as good as the other ones on here 
,braduz,2011-02-20T19:35Z,"its not a fake i promise.. just wait youll see.. its just like a dvd rip if u ask me, apart from jsut at the start you can see people sitting down in the cinema"

,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-02-22T00:16Z,It's real and a better CamBoot than anyone has a right to stumble upon.
,dirtbikindude,2011-02-22T09:48Z,"Not a fake, and aside from people walking in front of the screen a lot at the start I would say a:6 v:6.5"
,5amjr,2011-02-22T16:15Z,"Decent cam, thanks!"
,seedplease2010,2011-02-24T03:03Z,"Good film, audio is a little quiet, so turn up your sound, at the start people walk right in front of the cam and the person filming messes up the angle for like a minute or two half way in. 
over all-
Film-8
Video-6.5 good for one of the first cams
Audio-5 turn up your sound and use headphones, don't recommend playing through TV"
,swigz991,2011-02-25T13:44Z,yo mann great up  looks great for cam    thanks...
