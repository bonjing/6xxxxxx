,scottielass,2011-02-21T15:39Z,This is a terrific movie that I'd have wanted to see again -- thank you very much.
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-02-21T16:12Z,You're welcome. Please give us a + then if you could if you like it; haven't got one in 6 uploads. :^)
,scottielass,2011-02-22T16:26Z,"I watched it last night and must say it was as good as I remembered -- and the quality is superb. Thank you again from a big Mike Leigh fan. I don't suppose you have his latest, ""Another Year""?"
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-02-24T01:34Z,"I don't. If I post anything more from him I'll let you know here.

I don't know whether I will be able to post anything else for much longer though. This torrent was only up for THREE DAYS before it went to zero seeds. If people do nothing but leech, then I'll use my bandwidth servicing old torrents instead of posting new ones."
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-02-24T02:00Z,And pardon my manners: you're welcome. :^)
,scottielass,2011-02-25T16:52Z,I left the torrent to seed for a while but there were no takers -- too bad because it's such a good movie. Thank you again.
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-02-26T15:39Z,You're welcome. And it appears two seeds came back (thanks) so I am just uploading a new torrent as I write this...
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-02-28T00:58Z,"re: ""I left the torrent to seed for a while but there were no takers -- too bad because it's such a good movie.""

Why not just let it seed regardless? I've let torrents seed for months until they hit 100% or higher.

Looks like all the seeds are gone again. :^p"
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-03-03T05:44Z,"Thank you to the seeds that returned (or stayed.) Because I don't need to keep seeding this and other torrents, I've made a new one..."
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-04-21T04:44Z,"Here's another Mike Leigh offering for those who wanted one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6333005/Life_is_Sweet_%281990%29.DVDRip.XviD

Please keep seeding this so I can upload the new one... currently no seeds here."
,googlybug,2011-09-02T15:15Z,I was racking my brains on the tube trying to remember the name of this film. I'm glad I remembered it and I'm glad to have found that someone has it uploaded. Thank you.
