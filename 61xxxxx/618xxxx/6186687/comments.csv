The two stars burn holes in the screen with their intensity.  Lots of gratuitous, rub-your-face-in-it violence.  Lots of head shots and CGI blood splattering on walls and such, but the action scenes are unbelievable and only mediocre.  It's a really simple story and yet somehow they manage to make it seem convoluted.  The movie lacks good pacing and cohesion.  The original was a much better film.  IMHO

Thanks for the upload!"

Sound is generally better than usually is the case in R5, not ""as boxed in"" as often is, but still sounds like an old cassette with a wrangled tape here and there, especially when you here music in the background. All in all very good, though.. and an o.k movie. :)
