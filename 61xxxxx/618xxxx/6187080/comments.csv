,Lukey420,2011-02-21T00:21Z,"Can someone please upload 33, 34 and 35 as .AVI files. These FLV files are useless!!!"
,Lukey420,2011-02-21T00:22Z,Can someone please upload  as  an AVI file. These FLV files are useless!
,P2P-ftw,2011-02-21T04:25Z,"Lukey420:  I smoke enough myself, but you need to lay the fuck off if you cant figure out how to play flv's, no matter what OS you are on!  Maybe it is you that is the useless bit!  I would have tried to help, but you being an ass turned that thought off!"
,P2P-ftw,2011-02-21T04:28Z,"yurune, thanks for your continued support, surely people calling my ups useless dont keep me sharing!  Maybe you can school this noob for me,  Im just not in the mood!"
,Lukey420,2011-02-21T06:36Z,"notice how all the other files on here are .avi or xvid or dvix it's because that's what people watch. FLV is inferior, I appreciate the uploads but why not make it in a format people use! "
,Lukey420,2011-02-21T13:37Z,"Oh and for the record I can play flv but choose not too as they are only used when ripping youtube clips because they are shitty quality. Also each episode in 3 parts? Call me a ""Noob"" but clearly you don't know what you are doing on here. "
,P2P-ftw,2011-02-27T06:18Z,"LOL, dude STFU, you SERIOUSLY KNOW NOTHING YOU TALK ABOUT!  THE FILES I GET ARE IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORMAT!  I DONT CHANGE THEM, GO COMPLAIN TO THE CORPORATE WEBSITES THAT HOST THE FLVS!  SORRY I DONT CHANGE OR TINKER WITH THEM SO YOU WILL LIKE THE END RESULT!  YOU ARE A NOOB BECAUSE YOU JUST DONT REALIZE EVERYTHING STREAMED ISNT A FUCKING AVI!  feel free to talk back, but i already pointed out what you didnt realize before speaking last!"
,P2P-ftw,2011-02-27T06:37Z,"sorry I had to add more, but you saying ""I can play flv but choose not too as they are only used when ripping youtube clips because they are shitty quality""

ONCE AGAIN, you know all of shit, XViD, Mpeg-4, Mkv, ANYTHING HAS LOWER LEVELS OF ENCODES, SO DOES FLV!  FLV ALSO HAS HD VIDEO! 

Any format can encode to crap with the wrong settings, and MOST of the new formats can encode to HD!  FLV IS JUST A CONTAINER, it is the SAME AS A MP4,  THEY ARE BOTH MPEG-4!  LEARN THEN COME BACK NOOB!"
,P2P-ftw,2011-02-27T06:48Z,"meh, sorry...  what a self righteous douche"

NOOBISH NOOB! Can you re-read your own text and see the hilarity?  IF NOT....

I CAN RE ENCODE OR TRANSCODE ALL DAY LONG WITH FLVS AND MP4s! YOU IMPLY THAT AN AVI OR OTHER FORMATS WILL GIVE BETTER QUALITY THAN FLV,  that is just inherently wrong!  The base file is the best it can do quality wise, whether or not it can be touched up to look better doesnt mean its better quality"
,P2P-ftw,2011-02-28T06:24Z,"@Lukey420  I know what I am doing here, and its called sharing!  WTF are you doing here?  talking shit and not giving what you leeched!"
,yurune,2011-03-06T04:30Z,"@p2p-ftw:  you're welcome, I really appreciate you uploading these for us"
,yurune,2011-03-06T04:37Z,@lukey420: these FLVs play just fine and are good quality.  Try Zoom Player.
