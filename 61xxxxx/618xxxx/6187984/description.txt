Description

The taping of the behind the scenes dvd was an experience I will never forget. I was so nervous the whole time. Even after the first couple shoots. Iâ€™m like all these people going to see my body in the rough and how we came up with the pictures we have. I felt like a miniature celebrity for a minute. Lol. The camera did make my voice sound a little high pitched for a second. Or is that really how I sound? I did have a couple falls in the taping but I will not let yaâ€™ll see me bust my stuff wide open. lol. But I just decided to be myself and that came out even better. It was a pleasure to tape it because I want to give my fans a lil more of me. Hope you enjoy it!
