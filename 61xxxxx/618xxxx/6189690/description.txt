James Apollo's third studio album follows 2003's Sweet Unknown and 2006's Good Grief by starting off minimal and downbeat, like Nick Cave composing a funeral lament for a lost cowboy. Slow, delicate, with fragile acoustic twangs vying for centre stage with Apollo's distinctive vocals, the song builds to a gentle crescendo before you've noticed, enticing you in and trapping you at the campfire.
