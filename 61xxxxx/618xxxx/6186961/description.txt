Had to buy this from the UK because I was not finding anything that helped me interactively. If you guys have any other self-study cds please, share them! I know someone has the "real"oracle self study disc! 

Thanks to all the seeders and now I am uploading the ADV disc. Hope you guys enjoy. Everything I put up is virus free. GO JAVA PIRATES!!!! FREE LESSONS FOR ALL! 

I was looking through the tutorials and the part on disc 1 where the java was ran in cmd looked freakin OLD! Like Windows 98! But overall this is good to study if you are comboing with maybe a local live class, books, and tutorials. I also have the cd that comes with the latest JAVA FOR DUMMIES, but I haven't opened it so I can return it in 14 days! I'm real tempted to extract the image and just keep the book.
