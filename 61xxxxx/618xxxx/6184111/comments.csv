The video has a slight strobe through it nothing major just letting you know.

Ran a few filters through it changing the rgb slightly lowered the brightness/contrast and saturation a touch .Not a bad release at all for first cam and nothing but respect for TaRIQ for camming this ,first time doing it i believe and hes a top guy as well so respect mate ....

Enjoy !"

,jadawgkss,2011-02-19T06:27Z,"This is a VERY good rip (cameras must be getting very good to keep a screen this sharp in an otherwise dark room) and a VERY good movie so far (about half way in). I just wanted to point out, you know the assholes who talk lout in theaters and have trouble finding enough adjacent seats for their party, (and I don't mean black people I mean teenagers) well these types are in there in the first few minutes and I bet they never figured that they'd be pissing off people around the world tomorrow morning by their assholish tactics in one theater in east bumblefuck today. SAF are these pricks located in london?"

,michaelrwatson,2011-02-20T00:52Z,@mtadesse  I think he meant that *some* people just aren't brought up right and like to talk out loud during movies. 
,Mulreay,2011-02-20T14:35Z,For all those who moan at the amount of leechers. What the fuck do you want? Shall we all hang on until you download it? Just let us know next time and we will all wait until you have the movie.

,customchevy_350,2011-03-18T02:45Z,just a heads up i got a letter from my internet for downloading this. confusing cause i have peer block. I thought that took care of this problem wtf? Is there another way to prevent this?
,Tsen,2011-03-18T18:38Z,"Cinavia will stop you from viewing on PS3's or newer Blurays.  PC, XBox and pretty much any streaming-capable set top box should work fine though.  I streamed through my 360 with tversity when viewing failed on PS3 and it worked fine.

Otherwise if you strip the audio out and play it separate it will work (Cinavia is an audio watermark) but that's more of a pain than its worth."
,dis2master,2011-03-18T20:47Z,its awesome that ppl care enough about others who cant afford to go to the movies to put them up for us the day they come out
