I've been trying various fixes for 2 days now, ever since the patch automatically installed itself.

this is the first thing that has made the game work again."

,BarrySoetoro,2011-02-19T12:58Z,"Nowhere near as good as TDU1 for keyboard steering... but with an analog gamepad it's fine.

Just use a gamepad.

As for the cheesy story / characters... meh. Sit through it and get to the driving."
,martronn,2011-02-19T14:45Z,cat understand how you guys made this work?? after i installd this one i was able to play to times and now i just asks for serial all the time. 
,wanda_5,2011-02-19T15:20Z,"Both the crack and the update works.

It is extremely important to block UpLauncher.exe from your firewall, else the game don't let you play on off-line mode."
,Angerfist_DJ,2011-02-19T20:08Z,GREAT! Now my game doesn't work anymore.
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-19T21:01Z,"New update.

@Angerfist_DJ

FANTASTIC
maybe next time back your game up? or just re install. not a big deal."
,Angerfist_DJ,2011-02-20T20:11Z,"@ alexisthebest

Well, I did reinstall it with the most seeded SKIDROW version of the game.
Then installed this update and I get an windows error with only a little red cross in it.

It won't start.
So don't be a smartass, It just doesn't work. OKAY?"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-20T23:40Z,"@Angerfist_DJ

well maybe if you werent saying stuff like ""GREAT! Now my game doesn't work anymore."" people might actually help you with your problem."

,Jevin,2011-02-22T19:35Z,"I've encountered several problems now, but I solved them all.
With the new crack I couldn't start the game,
but I placed the old crack under the name 'testdrive_crack.exe' in the game folder and I loaded that one while having uplauncher opened and now I can play the game while the patches still work:)
Also, just disconnect internet, after you started the game you can again connect, but this is a precaution because sometimes firewall doesn't block the program properly.
Further, always start the uplauncher, otherwise IT WON'T WORK!
