The whole idea of torrent completely nullifies the argument for rar, please understand this. We no longer live in the early 90's!!!"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-18T17:00Z,"how is a rar archive obsolete?

stop being lazy and just un rar it. it's not that hard."
,moldybudz,2011-02-18T22:01Z,"Actually, I agree with gregersamsa. RAR makes no sense for torrents. Maybe for something you are downloading over a different protocol (FTP or HTTP downloads perhaps?) but the inherent nature of torrents makes downloading parts of parts of rar files stupid. Seriously. Click the ""pieces"" tab in your utorrent. Downloading pieces of a split rar archive makes no sense at all. All it does is create an additional step before you delete the rars anyway."
,dingo8baby,2011-02-19T04:38Z,"it is obsolete because bittorrent technology already breaks files up into smaller chunks. the only reason to break a file up in this way is for usenet, ftp or other file sharing technologies that might be unable to resume downloads and therefore is helpful for the user if his connection is broken sometime in the (before broadband was as widespread) sometimes lengthy period of time it takes to download. 

there is no reason whatsoever to use partial rar files in distributing video files over bittorrent networks.

Alex, you are a quality uploader, and i have enjoyed your 720p TV releases ever since TvTeam took a shit on the Pirate Bay community and stop releasing 720p Tv content, but please, make sure you know what you are talking about before you call someone lazy."
