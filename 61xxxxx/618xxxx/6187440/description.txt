General Patton Discovered the Truth.  





Patton was not only labeled the â€œfightingestâ€ General in the American Army, he
was the Armyâ€™s youngest ever â€œMaster of the Swordâ€ and redesigned the sword
carried by Army personnel, which became known as the Patton saber. Patton
was also an olypmic athlete who competed in pistol shooting, running,
equestrian, and swimming events. To top it all off, George Patton was a valiant
fighter, and a pioneer of armored warfare, who made numerous improvements to
tank warfare in the form of communications, tank movements, etc.


As General Patton started to actually become acquainted with the defeated
Germans and Americaâ€™s Soviet allies, Patton finally realized what he was in the
midst of, and his opinions about the war, and both our enemies and allies
changed drastically. What Patton realized was recorded in his diary, and in
letters to everyone from his family and friends, to other military and government
personnel.
