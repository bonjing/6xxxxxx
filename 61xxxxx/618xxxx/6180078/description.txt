One of the pioneers of folk/jazz fusion with Pentangle and one of the world's pre-eminent guitarists draws on recent travels to explore new, more romantic harmonic horizons, blending tradition and originality in brilliant new guitar pieces. 
From the sounds absorbed on trips to Sicily, strains heard in Jelly Roll Morton's music, chord voicings from Erik Satie and much more, all put together in lush, romantic arrangements, John Renbourn weaves a spellbinding musical tapestry that make 'Palermo Snow' a must for his fans.
