,torselab,2011-02-19T20:09Z,i can't extract the file without password..
,torselab,2011-02-19T20:28Z,i can't extract the file without password...
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-19T23:01Z,"torselab, I'm sorry, but I don't know why you can't extract the file without password. The files are in format mp4 (x264), no rar. You don't need any password at all."
,s_mac,2011-02-19T23:41Z,"Will you post the drunk contest, 3 point contest etc.?"
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-20T00:01Z,"I hope so, yes!"
,bender1110,2011-02-20T03:19Z,are you going to not only upload the slam dunk contest but also the rest of the night? including the tnt fantasy draft?
,s_mac,2011-02-20T06:38Z,Hey when will you have the all star saturday events?
,Konn114,2011-02-20T06:40Z,Thx Nepotu! would be awsome if u could post saturdays stuff.
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-20T11:39Z,"It coming the saturday's stuff: Shooting Stars, Skills Chalenge, 3PT Contest, Slam Dunk"
,arni92,2011-02-20T11:40Z,i cant extract the rar file without password!!!
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-20T15:13Z,Those are not rar files!!!!!
,bender1110,2011-02-20T15:47Z,I think the problem was somebody yesterday uploaded this same torrent but with a rar password in it - it was an anonymous torrent and has hence been deleted. They might have though somebody here had the password. I dont think there ever was one - was a total scam.
,gigaking,2011-02-21T20:33Z,thank you so much. is it possible for you to upload regular season games as well?
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-22T03:04Z,"Isn't possible because: 1. I don't have enough space on HDD and internet bandwidth for this, 2. I have some link but here I can't post it because... you know why. What games you're interested in it?"
