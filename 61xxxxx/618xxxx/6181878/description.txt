Northern Lights - Southern Cross is the seventh album by Canadian-American rock group The Band released in 1975. It was the first album to be recorded at their new California studio, Shangri-La and the first album of all-new material since 1971's Cahoots. 

In many respects Northern Lights - Southern Cross was viewed as a comeback. The album was the Band's finest since their self-titled sophomore effort.

All eight songs are credited as compositions of guitarist Robbie Robertson.

Northern Lights - Southern Cross was recorded using a 24-track console, allowing Garth Hudson to include multiple layers of keyboards and to explore new timbres.
