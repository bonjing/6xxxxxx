The Java EE 6 Tutorial: Basic Concepts, Fourth Edition, is a task-oriented, example-driven guide to developing enterprise applications for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 6 (Java EE 6). Written by members of the Java EE 6 documentation team at Oracle, this book provides new and intermediate Java programmers with a deep understanding of the platform.

Starting with expert guidance on web tier technologies, including JavaServer Faces and Facelets, this book also covers building web services using JAX-WS and JAX-RS, developing business logic with Enterprise JavaBeans components, accessing databases using the Java Persistence API, securing web and enterprise applications, and using Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform.

This edition contains extensive new material throughout, including detailed introductions to the latest APIs and platform features, and instructions for using the latest versions of GlassFish Server Open Source Edition and NetBeans IDE. Key platform features covered include

* Convention over configuration, so developers need specify only those aspects of an application that vary from the convention
* Annotated POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) with optional XML configuration
* Simplified but more flexible packaging
* Lightweight Web Profile that is ideal for developing web applications
