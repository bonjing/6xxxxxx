,deejkay,2011-02-25T12:11Z,"Thanx SlickNick , I am interested in buying a HDTV recorder , could I ask what you use to record these Supercross , & what program you use to cut commercials . Great Quality , would like to share some stuff of my own . Thanx alot from Australia :)"
,slicknick610,2011-02-25T13:57Z,I use the Hauppauge HD-PVR to record. Then I cut commercials and save the file as an uncompressed avi file with Sony Vegas. Then I use Handbrake (freeware) to render the file in x264 mp4 format.
,deejkay,2011-02-26T01:11Z,"Thanx SlickNick , I read up a little on the unit you talk of , could you clarify please , you connect your TV OUT (via component cable) to the Hauppauge HD-PVR IN & then use the USB2 from the Hauppauge HD-PVR to connect to a laptop to record to computer hard drive ? So you must have a computer near your TV ? Sorry for all the questions , but I cannot see this in any of the reviews I am reading about the Hauppauge HD-PVR , and kken as to get this bought & hooked up , Thanx for your help in advance ."
,deejkay,2011-02-26T01:14Z,kken = keen :)
,slicknick610,2011-02-26T05:13Z,Cable box output not TV output. You are going to use a laptop? I hope it is powerful because HD videos uses a lot of processing power. I have a quad core processor on the desktop I use. 
,Bleazle,2011-02-26T05:25Z,"Awesome work as usual, thanks again from New Zealand! Hope you manage to get the Legends of Supercross as well :-)"
