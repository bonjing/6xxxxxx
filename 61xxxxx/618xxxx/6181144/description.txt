An all-star cast celebrates the influence of reggae on the UK's 
music and culture in a live concert coinciding with BBC Four's 
Reggae Britannia documentary season.
Expect to hear hits from the 1960s to the present day telling 
the story of the musical evolution from ska, through rocksteady, 
roots, dub, lovers rock and beyond. Music director Dennis Bovell 
assembles a big band featuring some of the most important reggae 
musicians in the British scene to back up a star cast of singers 
and toasters including Big Youth, Ken Boothe, Neville Staple, 
Ali Campbell, Dave Barker, Brinsley Forde, Dennis Alcapone and 
Winston Reedy, Pauline Black, Janet Kay, Carroll Thompson and Rico Rodriguez.
The concert celebrates the journey that captured the turmoil 
and channelled the dreams of Jamaicans who came to Britain, those 
who were born here and the white kids who grew up alongside them 
and embraced their culture and their roots
