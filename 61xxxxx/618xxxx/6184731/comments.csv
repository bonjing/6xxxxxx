Maybe this compilation was released like this on dvd in 2010, I don't know, but still the title sucks."

I extend my gratitude to you to you Mr .BONE
May I just quibble to you on this one: some of the clips didn't open properly with vlc. Seeing as they are in avi i wonder what the catch is?  Anyone else experiencing this? Perhaps it can be adjusted. 
Thanks!"
