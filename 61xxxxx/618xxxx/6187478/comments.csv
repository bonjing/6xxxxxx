""Gimme the facts Mam, just the facts..."
,DragonKP,2011-02-25T22:38Z,"You will find THE facts in audio books I post.  
Unfortunately the controlling faction is not pleased with these, so they tried to erase them from history (and you never learn this stuff at school either).

My main goal is to allow the knowledge to be disseminated more easily, and because people are rather lazy this days, the audio book is a kind of solution.
Content is important - and they figured out some stuff long time ago, but people are not listening, nor even hearing !!! "
