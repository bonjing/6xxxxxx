If you've never heard Omar & the Howlers and had to judge them by a glance at the Swingland CD, you might think they were just another curious band jumping on the swing-jump-blues bandwagon. Not so. Singer Omar Dykes has been a proponent of jump since carving out a niche for himself in Austin back in the mid-'70s. Through heady times (like having a 1986 recording contract with Columbia/CBS Records in pocket) and lean ones, Dykes has kept going as a generally dependable source of Texas blues, blues rock, Delta-flavored R&B, and what have you. Always sounding like a cross between Wolfman Jack and a blood relation of Howlin' Wolf, he acts out the lyrics to the dozen cover songs here with typical fervor as his band and various guests alertly supply the swing or shuffle rhythms and solos.
Omar has a great voice, very distinct, and very cool. It cuts through on tracks like â€œMr. Blues Is Coming To Town,â€ and the very funny (and very true) â€œQuite Whiskey.â€ And I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever hear a cover of â€œHit The Road, Jackâ€ that could sound good, simply because Ray Charles version is so definitive. But itâ€™s featured here and it cooks.
Omar doesnâ€™t play as much guitar here as he has on past efforts, but when he does, itâ€™s tasteful and to the point. And on other cuts, Derek Oâ€™ Brien is featured and plays some marvelous solos (â€œAinâ€™t That Just Like A Womanâ€ and â€œOne Room Country Shackâ€). The band cooks throughout. Effortless grooves on stuff like â€œGoing Up The Countryâ€ and the instrumental â€œDonâ€™t Lose Your Coolâ€ show a very hot band that understands its music. Throw in some guest shots by the likes of David â€œFatheadâ€ Newman and Gary Primich, and youâ€™ve got a wonderful musical journey.
