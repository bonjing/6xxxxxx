Though Not Music was released in 2010, it was recorded at the same time as 2008s Chemical Chords, after touring in support of which Stereolab went on hiatus. Despite its semi-archival status, the album sounds fresh, and distinct from Chemical Chords. It shares the streamlined feel of that album, but many of these songs donâ€™t fit that albumâ€™s distillation of lounge, Motown, and French pop elements.  And those that do, such as the brisk, brassy Supah Jaianto and Everybodys Weird Except Me, sound like warped reflections of them. Instead, Not Music charts the more adventurous turns the bandâ€™s sessions took, providing the more experimental yang to Chemical Chords bubbly pop yin. These songs take a more cerebral, yet still playful, approach that starts with song titles such as Delugeoisie and trickles down to clever arrangements. There are moments that evoke Stereolabs quintessential sounds; Equivalences rides a descending keyboard motif that the groupâ€™s fans will recognize immediately. Not Music is all over the place in the best possible way, and fans who love Stereolabs gracefully intellectual side will especially appreciate it. Taken with Chemical Chords, itâ€™s a testament to just how much ground the band could cover while remaining purely Stereolab.
