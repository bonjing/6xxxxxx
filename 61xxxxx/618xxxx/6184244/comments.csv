Just as owning a lot of telephone books won't make anyone you call talk any faster on the phone, listing many trackers in your torrent files won't speed up anyone's data transfers.

For torrents that you plan to upload to The Pirate Bay, you do not need to include any trackers at all, since the system automatically edits the tracker list in each uploaded torrent file to use the trackers of our choice."
,geeguh,2011-02-19T18:05Z,"@velvet - Yes, having a brazillion trackers won't speed things up, and yes TPB does insert a tracker of it's choosing into the torrent, BUT! some of those trackers DO NOT WORK. 

For example, denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce does not work and from what I have read it has not been operational for about a year. I have never seen it connect. I have also seen some other trackers that TPB puts into torrents that are very unreliable. Other times there are no trackers in the torrent so the client has to rely on DHT which can sometimes be slim on seeder info.

So, YES people do need lists of working trackers when TPB constantly throws ones at us that don't work. And NO, you don't need a multi-page list of trackers... just a few THAT WORK.

Other than that I heart TPB. Thank you velvet and all the other mods for keeping it going. "
