Revisit the drug-dealing heyday of 1980s Brooklyn, when Danny Diamondz, aka Danny Dan, was one of the most powerful dealers in New York City -- and a mentor to future hip-hop superstar Jay-Z. In this absorbing documentary, members of the Marcy Posse, who controlled Brooklyn's Marcy Projects along with Danny Dan, reflect on the former drug lord's influence and tactics, as well as the gripping story of his downfall.
