      One of Scotland's most original comedy talents, Limmy, is
      back with another series of offbeat sketches, animations and
      musings. Get reacquainted with Falconhoof the adventure phone-in
      host as he gets a new sidekick, and zoned-out waster Dee Dee as
      he blasts off into space - and get to know the experimental
      Larry Forsyth, psychic medium Raymond Day and the calamitous
      Major Boo Boo.
