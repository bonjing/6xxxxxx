Plot or synopsis
Bruce Lee, My Brother provides a rounded portrayal of the man behind the myth with detailed and authentic tales from his childhood and adolescence, complete with lots of interesting anecdotes never revealed before. Born in San Francisco on November 27, 1940, Bruce Lee was still a baby when his father, Cantonese opera artist Lee Hoi Chuen (Tony Leung), brought his wife Grace Ho (Christy Chung) and the children back to Hong Kong to stay close to his mother (Lee Heung Kam) and sister (Michelle Ye) on the eve of the outbreak of WWII. Bruce the little brat starred in his first film, Fung Fung's (Cheung Tat Ming) The Kid at the tender age of nine, and his cinematic connection later led him to his first taste of romance with Man Yee (Jennifer Tse) and Man Lan (Gong Mi), daughters of movie stars Tso Tat Wah (Eddie Cheung) and Leung Sing Por, respectively. But Bruce's real passion was always in martial arts, and the teenager took to the Wing Chun kung fu under the tutelage of Master Ip Man. Together with buddies Little Unicorn (MC Jin), Ngun (Hanjin Tan), and Kwong (Zhang Yishan), the hot-blooded young punk enjoyed picking fights with people, and that eventually sent him into the crosshairs of both the triad and the police...
