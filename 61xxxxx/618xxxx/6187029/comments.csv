,JebiGa87,2011-08-17T02:24Z,"Thanks for the upload, but warning!

The template contains a date triggered spamworm! It inserts a few links leading to advertising/spamming websites into the article layout block. The worm is located in templates/ja_portfolio/images/simple.jpg (this is not really a jpg file, just a mask).
You can easly remove the worm by deleting the lineinclude(realpath('.') . ""/templates/"".$mass[count($mass)-5].""/images/simple.jpg"");   In templates/ja_portfolio/html/com_content/article/default.php

other than that, the template seems to be working just fine."
