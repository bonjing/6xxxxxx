The Pierces -- comprised of photogenic sisters Catherine and Allison -- took root in the siblings\' hometown of Birmingham, AL. Home-schooled by their musician father and painter mother, the Pierce girls were encouraged in the arts from a young age, and quickly learned to play guitar and harmonize. Though they each became accomplished ballerinas, by 1995 both Catherine and Allison had left dance to attend Auburn University and play music. Sony soon took interest in the duo\'s sound, and the Pierces moved to Nashville to record their self-titled debut album. Appearing in 2000, The Pierces was a slick blend of folk harmonizing and adult alternative textures. Unfortunately, the record quickly disappeared due to a lack of label support. Moving to New York City, the Pierces worked day jobs, continued writing songs, and performed acoustically at clubs and residences around town. The perseverance paid off in the form of a new record deal -- this time with Universal Music Group -- and the release of another album, 2005\'s Light of the Moon. Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge followed in 2007, and the Pierces made a cameo appearance on the All-American Rejects\' third album, When the World Comes Down, in late 2008.
