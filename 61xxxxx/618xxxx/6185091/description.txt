
Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~ Complete Series
(Dual-Audio) Vintage 2009


Mafia is rife in America where assassinations are a regular occurrence
on the streets. Inferno, a mysterious company, is behind most of these
dealings through the use of their near-invincible
human weapon, "Phantom."

One day, a Japanese tourist accidentally witnesses Phantomâ€™s latest
murder. Desperate to escape, the tourist hides in a secluded building.
However, Phantom, revealed to be a young woman named Ein, and
the leader of Inferno â€˜Scythe Masterâ€™ captures the tourist
and brainwashes him.

Given the name â€™Zweiâ€™, this once peaceful tourist is now a puppet of
Inferno with no memories. Drawn into a world of lies, deceit, and violence,
Zwei must fight to survive, hopefully to one day regain his memories and
escape from this world where he is constantly on the brink of death.

Most of my uploads are encoded / compressed to their smallest possible
file size. The quality IMO is still pretty decent though for the filesizes. But,
those of you who have a higher res monitor, may notice a drop in quality,
if this bothers you, then look elsewhere... I will not bend on my methods.
Thank you to those that enjoy my torrents.., I enjoy sharing them with you.
Feel free to pm me if you're looking for something, or have a question???
