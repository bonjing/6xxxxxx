In a gripping two-part series, Dr. Phil sits down with a family torn apart over accusations of the unthinkable. Melody says her 4-year-old granddaughter revealed that she was touched inappropriately by a man in a mask, and that the man was her daddy. Melodyâ€™s daughter, Karen, says her husband, Jason, would never lay a hand on their children, and two CPS investigations proved his innocence. She says she hates her mother for what sheâ€™s done to their family and has cut off all contact with her. Melody hasnâ€™t seen her granddaughter in a year but stands by her accusations. Will Jason agree to take a polygraph test, and will the results end the accusations once and for all?
