Capo v2.0.6 (AJhacks)



Description

Capo is a revolutionary tool that helps you learn the music in your iTunes library. By slowing your music, and presenting a detailed spectrogram, Capo lets you hear and see your music like never before.

It's your music
â€¢ No longer do you have to rely on the musical tastes of others to learn music. Drag songs right from your music collection into capo to start learning them.

Tab it out!
â€¢ By simply drawing atop the spectrogram, Capo will generate tablature automatically for you. It really doesn't get much easier than this!

Detect, and enter chords
â€¢ Figure out the chords in your music using Capo's sophisticated chord detection routines. Or, enter your own easily using strings like 'bbmaj7' or 'f#maj9'.

Pitch adjustment
â€¢ Capo lets you adjust the pitch of your songs-so you can change their key or fine tune them to match your instrument.



Markers
â€¢ Use keyboard shortcuts to mark verses, choruses, bridges, and other important points in your songs so you can return to them later.

Looping
â€¢ Repeat difficult sections slowly, playing along with your favorite artist. Speed up gradually as you get better.

Music Export
â€¢ Take your Capo-adjusted music with you. Export speed- and pitch-corrected audio to your iPod, and play along when and where it's most convenient.

Effects
â€¢ Capo lets you modify panning, adjust a 10-band graphic equalizer, and apply vocal reduction to help you isolate the parts of the music you wish to learn.
