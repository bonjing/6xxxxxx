I don't post much cause I don't have a place to feed the seed til it matures. That keeps people from getting pissed and wasting their time.  Again, the idea is great but needs the follow through."

I'm seeding indefinately, there is follow thru, dunno why you think there isnt. I can only send so fast and with like 40 torrents right now im seeding behind a Rogers connection, cant get them out any faster. HOWEVER N2KMaster torrents will be increasing in speed, i bought a second line for the house for torrenting."

Please gawd say it isn't so!"

Too bad that the aspect ratio is 4:3 only,  for 16:9 .. you can try ""Torchwood Season1 (XviD asd) EnglishV+NapisyPL"" _> http://www.kat.ph/torchwood-season1-xvid-asd-englishv-napisypl-t1563451.html"
