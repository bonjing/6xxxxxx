"BYOMKESH BAKSHI" Greatest ever detective series to hit Indian TV. THAT is it..

The cases were very different from the regular murder4money stuffs.. Byomkesh Bakshi came at a time when the satellite channels were not filling the satellite slots with dumb serials and that time Doordarshan had some decent shows on air and this one was the best of the lot .It was a low budget detective show but it had everything -mour,action,brain teasers and most importantly a script(which is missing in 90% of the shows these days)
