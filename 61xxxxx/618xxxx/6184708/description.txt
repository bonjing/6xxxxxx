Junior Wells' Chicago Blues Band - Hoodoo Man Blues
Analogue Productions (AAPB 034-45) | 2 *180gr 45 RPM Vinyl
Mastered by Kevin Gray | 24-bit/96kHz | FLAC

One of the all-time great urban blues records and the best-seller in the famed Delmark catalog. Hoodoo Man Blues is so full of bravado and snap it'll make you feel tough just listening to it. Not all of the Delmark titles were recorded very well, but this one certainly was. And at 45 RPM, this now stands as the undisputed definitive version. Hoodoo Man Blues, which features Buddy Guy on guitar, is not only Junior Wells' first LP appearance, it's damn near the first LP by a Chicago blues band.
Chess and a few other labels had reissued 45s by Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed, Elmore James, etc., but virtually no one had tried to capture the Chicago blues sound free of the limitations of juke box/airplay promotion. Hoodoo Man Blues went a long way in the popularization of real Chicago blues and of Junior Wells.

Fantastic sound!!!
