,xwetx,2011-02-20T21:11Z,I guess it is such a fantastic movie that we don't need any screens?
,snarfies,2011-02-20T21:34Z,"Well, I TRIED to add screens, I really did.  But I messed it up, and when I click the ""edit torrent"" button I get the message ""EDIT - Temporarily disabled !""  So, yeah, no screens except for the screen included in the torrent itself.  Sorry.  I'll try to re-add if I can ever edit the torrent."

See if you can find the Classic, Cindy & Donna thanks.  Also want the scene (Don't know the movie) where Sharon Mitchell blows a guy through schoolyard fence.  Thanks again!"
