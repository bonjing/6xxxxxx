     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      In the third in a series of lectures drawn from Harvard
      professor Michael Sandel's famous undergraduate course on the
      philosophy of justice, he introduces the British philosopher
      John Stuart Mill and compares the artistic merits of Shakespeare
      and The Simpsons. Mill argued that seeking the greatest good for
      the greatest number is compatible with protecting individual
      rights, and that utilitarianism can make room for a distinction
      between higher and lower pleasures. Sandel tests Mill's theory
      that that the higher pleasure is that which is preferred by a
      well-informed majority by playing video clips from three very
      different forms of entertainment - Shakespeare's Hamlet, the
      reality show Fear Factor and The Simpsons. Students debate their
      own preferences and whether Mill's defense of utilitarianism is
      successful.
