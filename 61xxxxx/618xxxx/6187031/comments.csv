[V],twentyforty,2011-02-19T21:55Z,"Me too, dubbing is ridiculous."
[T],frapper101,2011-02-20T01:02Z,"thanks 20-40
:)"
,muk0690,2011-02-20T11:15Z,"Yeah, dubbing is ridiculous.... "
,gaaraisgod,2011-02-20T13:43Z,"Judging by your comments, and seeing the srt, I'm guessing this has the original language audio track.

Anyway, why don't you ever put your name at the end? O_o;

The.Return.of.Chen.Zhen.2010.BluRay.480p.H264-TwentyForty

How hard is that? xDD;"
,gaaraisgod,2011-02-20T13:43Z,"Gives it a nice complete look. Anyway, thanks for the movie. Looks good."
,bender1110,2011-02-20T15:51Z,"Because there are 2 chinese languages, you have to be careful these days because it can be dubbed from one chinese to another (mandarin/cantonese)

Not saying its the case here, just something to look out for.

thx for the upload 20/40"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-20T17:36Z,"@bender1110: LOL bender, it is obvious that I never would choose dubbed one.

Besides, it's only one Chinese language to choose when you upload some torrent. And - I know that this CAN make some people angry: there are MANY DIALECTS OF MANY LANGUAGES - but problem is that these are TWO languages, different as much as French and Italian. But those are problems of Chinese and Taiwan states and people, as those of Hong Kong and of economic and political emigration.

Not mine. I have pair of eyes and choose the language of actors - spoken one - NOT dubbed one. Which one is that, I couldn't care less."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-20T17:45Z,"@gaaraisgod: ""How hard is that?""

VERY HARD.  Especially when one is stupid as I am - I guess you can realize that you are so fucking smart. BTW, do NOT SHIT WHERE YOU EAT."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-20T18:14Z,"NEWFLASH:There would be no Chinese movies of any spoken ""kind"" and origin from me. I don't need nor have deserved to be ""middleman"" in Mandarin/Cantonese discussion or to be treated disrespectfully. Out there are thousands  of better movies, for sure.

Go  someplace else, next time and knock yourselves out with Chinese of whatever origin. "
,muk0690,2011-02-20T20:15Z,"@twentyforty: Sorry, if I've offended you......"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-20T20:32Z,"No muk, you haven't, I always have 99% of pure, unadulterated Hit & Runs on all Chinese movies, and still always some dwarf pops-out giving me a lesson about shit I learned decades ago (and have first-hand experience).

Point being, I don't need that. Out there is plenty Chinese and Korean uploaders - all can go there."
,dark_defender,2011-02-21T20:54Z,"Hi twentyforty,
Special thanks for the encode & upload..+1
*Thumbs Up*

@All: Do not pose questions which inculcates knowledge of movies from 20-40. This man is the epitome as far as knowledge regarding movies are concerned. 
So better be fucking sure before you put up a question and waste his time, which we all know is very precious."
,justregged,2011-02-21T22:04Z,all this talk of chinese is making me hungry
,gaaraisgod,2011-02-23T21:03Z,What happened to you? Why are you so grumpy? :P
