,nanonyme,2011-02-20T00:15Z,Someone failed with release seriously. The torrent does contain what it says it does but including that it also contains tons of unmentioned torrent files.
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T16:11Z,"That take seconds to download. The quality is perfect. If you don't like it, download someone elses."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:15Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. 

Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. 

The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. 

Just download any 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. 

I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted.

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads."

I'm downloading movies for over 4 years now so I know what to trust and what not ;)And you can uncheck the boxes with all that crap you don't want, So stop complaining dude!!!  How stupid can people be!   I'm downloading this torrent now..  I will comment after downloading, I have many movies downloaded from you sniffer... And they are all very good!! ;) So let that little bitch cry.. Screw him :p"
,MrPanic1987,2011-03-31T17:10Z,I forgot to ask.. Where can I find correct Dutch subs for these movies? It's hard to find a good site for dutch subs... most are not correctly translated.
,MrPanic1987,2011-03-31T18:45Z,And again it's perfect quality V10/A10  for a 25 year old movie;)  And fast download 2
,rowantree,2011-04-11T16:05Z,"PERFECT.  Great quality and I didn't download any unwanted, extra files.  Thanks!  :)"
,nymersic,2011-04-19T11:48Z,"To be fair, I have to frown upon including all these other torrents.  Apparently the quality is fine though."
,TPB_rules,2011-05-12T14:54Z,"It's not fake, it's GREAT!!!
Thanks for sharing, I love this movie!"
,PatriciaC81,2011-07-26T04:14Z,"Is this file contains all this extras: 
http://fusion-industries2.tripod.com/deletedscenes/
http://fusion-industries3.tripod.com/deletedscenes/
or just the movies?"
,PatriciaC81,2011-07-26T04:16Z,Is this file contains all the extras (including 35 delect the scenes that shows in fusion-industries website) or just the movies?
,_Tim_,2011-08-09T17:54Z,nice upload. Thx!
,MegansDad,2011-09-10T05:45Z,"Since no one else has asked the question I will.  What's the difference between your upload and the one that aXXo put up here over 3 years ago?  From what I can tell there is no difference, other then the fact that you've included a folder with other torrent files in it.  The over all download size is the same as is the size of the individual movies."
,M4rt1n41,2011-09-13T18:53Z,"@MegansDad i agree with u
It seems like he copied it from axxo and added his torrentfolder and reuploaded it.

Dont take wrong it is still a good torrent and with a fairly amount of seeders."
,Zellonous,2012-01-14T19:02Z,"@M4rt1n41
That's because that's what he did. I downloaded both sets and checked them out. The file size is the same, the bitrate is the same, the resolution is the same, and the MD5 hash is the same. These videos are identical. Axxo's torrent was uploaded in 2008, but this guy's was in 2011. The only thing he did different, was put a bunch of his torrent files in with the videos. "
