[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-20T04:24Z,All episodes DVDRip. Please seed.
[V],manOtor,2011-02-22T17:59Z,"GREAT!
Sniffer_V, you're the best!
Thanks,

Cheers"
,ultimagic,2011-02-26T06:00Z,why xvid? and not h264?
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T16:09Z,"There's nothing wrong with any of my uploads. Icekool666 has put this comment on all of my uploads. Ignore him. Feel free to check on my other torrents to see. There is nothing wrong with this at all. He's just a sad little boy who wants to discourage uploaders. He's not done any of his own of course, he's just a leech trying to prevent people like me sharing quality downloads with the world."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:11Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. 

Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. 

The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. 

Just download any 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. 

I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted.

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads."

,GaryV789,2011-04-05T01:56Z,Figures. I knew as soon as I bought the goddamn thing somebody would upload it right away. The season has been out over a year. Dammit. 
,rsi,2011-04-16T17:16Z,Thanks !
,palacedeano,2011-04-24T00:43Z,"hi, i have macbookpro with quicktime, divx and vlc installed and cant get this torrent to work on any of them.  i then installed perian but this didnt work either.  any help would be appreciated"
,Uber_Bower,2011-04-25T01:42Z,"Excelent Quality for both A and V all the way through, however, it is NOT a dvdrip, it still contains watermarks from televisual airing, and one episode, number 11, still contains the warning at the begining about the sexual content, that said, still an excellent torrent, will continue to seed"
,palacedeano,2011-04-26T08:32Z,bump please?  see above
,tylsiege,2011-04-26T20:25Z,"palacedeano don't know if GOM works with MAC, but give it a try"
,adverse_game,2011-04-27T22:34Z,"@palacedeano and if GOM didn't work try updating your codecs, you are required to upgrade the codecs of your pc/player to view any unsuported video file types, I don't really know how mac works as I never had one, but I supose it's pretty much the same, if not please tell me and keep in mind that I was only trying to help... And if i'm wrong on something sorry to have wasted your time. ;) you can get codecs here: http://www.free-codecs.com/
And thanx for the great upload Toilet_sniffer_V keep up the good work!"
,rydah-,2011-05-01T14:36Z,"------------ THIS IS A WARNING ------------
This is not a bad show, not a spectacular one, but definately not bad. But BEWARE  - this guy: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0071847/ 
I watched six episodes, during these his dick was shown more than three times. This was a huge dealbreaker for me and since noone ever warned me about this, I figured this would the least I could do. If you consider dl'ing this, BE AWARE AND WARNED OF A LOT OF MALE NUDITY!"
,rydah-,2011-05-01T14:40Z,"Oh and btw, A10/V10"

,Demonight,2011-08-29T18:19Z,"It could be on h264, but whatever! xvid has a good quality too if its encoded in the right way! If someone is looking for HIGHER quality, he can download the BD Rip!

,Jack_Raiden,2011-09-18T20:28Z,"QUALITY release/upload, Toilet_sniffer_V. Thanks seeders. Fuck you, cancer."
,lunawolfe,2011-10-03T01:07Z,"alright so good quality on this. audio is good as is video (personal opinion watching from small laptop screen)
A=10/10
V=10/10
series =10

one thing that bugged me a little bit was all the spam extras within the torrent. adverts you could say. not a huge deal for me as i have full control over what is downloaded through my BT client but for some others it might get annoying."
,lunawolfe,2011-10-03T01:10Z,sorry forgot to mention will seed this 4.00% share ratio which should give it a little bit of a boost.
,Sunnydee2011,2011-11-04T02:29Z,"Thanks 2 uploader Toilet_sniffer_V. Great work! I'm also in search of the Third(3rd) season of ""Spartacus"" if there is a third.

,sealstealer,2012-03-18T17:57Z,"How can I select just one or several files instead downloading every files? I can't select with neither bittorrent and utorrent, help?!  thnx."
,Tinny_pb,2012-03-20T10:45Z,"Sealstealer: you CAN do it with uTorrent. Just click the magnet link and download the torrent for long enough for the file list to appear in uTorrent's ""Files"" tab. (It should only take a few seconds.) Then deselect the files you don't want."

,ironymon,2012-05-06T20:13Z,Don't take advantage of putting spam torrents people don't need just because it's a magnet link. Put all non related torrents into a different folder and people should have easier time discarding those.
