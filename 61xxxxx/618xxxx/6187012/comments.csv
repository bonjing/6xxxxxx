,HabbyHebbo,2011-02-19T21:22Z,"Can I upgrade Win7 Ultimate edition to Sp1 with this? Can I do it without serial?

With ""Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 X64 64bit All Editions Activated"" version I got 

""To upgrade, you need to be running Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 installed. ""

which is just what not wanted."
[V],thethingy,2011-02-19T22:45Z,"HabbyHebbo, no because you cant upgrade ultimate to ultimate, your choice is do a ckean install using windows easy transfer to put back your files and settings or install the sp1 update to your existing ultimate install;

[T],fabunbutaps,2011-12-13T17:22Z,"hello pirates!!!

if you want to know the serial of win 7, that not complicated, you need to follow this instructions:

1-mount your iso with deamon tool

2- follow this path in your virtual drive: 
E:\sources\product.ini  (letter can be different)

3- open the product.ini with notes and you have all serials for each installation you want

well done that not so hard ;)"
