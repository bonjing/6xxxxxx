The comic misadventures of teenagers Kenan and his dimwitted buddy Kel. 

In the moment of many classic team duos with Laurel and Hardy and Abbott &

Costello, it makes a great team as Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell were in

fame together. During the time Kenan first appeared in D2: The Mighty Ducks

and Heavyweights, he then joined in the original cast of All That with the helping of Kel. The sketches they have done were original and fresh that all of a sudden, they became famous as Nickelodeon decided to have a series of their own as a

spinoff and that's Kenan & Kel.

Kenan Rockmore is a high school student and a grocery worker at Rigby's

Grocery Store in Chicago with his manager Chris Potter. His family The

Rockmores live in a fancy apartment with his mom Sheryl, his dad Roger, and

his younger sister Kyra. He hangs out with his friend Kel Kimble and they go out and do some scheming and other kind of stuff that pokes all the fun.

This show is so hillarious you can even tell is really funny with all the slapstick you ever want, plus there is many famous lines on the show that many sitcoms

ever do in a living like Kel saying his famous quote: "Who Loves Orange Soda?" and "Aw! Here It Goes!" and Kenan's quote: "WHYYYYY?"

Plus, every episodes is a classic like "The Taining of a Screw", "Doing Things The Hemingway", "Dial O for Oops", "A Star Is Peeved" as well as the holiday

episodes like "Merry Christmas, Kenan" and "Turkey Day".

This is truly one of the best All That spinoff ever to created, not only that it is really the kind of show Nickelodeon really have with its days. Try to catch many episodes if you can, and you will have a bound with laughter.
