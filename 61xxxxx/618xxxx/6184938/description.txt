Released in Dec 2010, this is a collection of electronic music by australian artist Pogo, famous for his Disney remixs including Alice, Upular and Toyznoize.

According to Pogo, this music was all created before the arrival of 'Alice' and his newer style.

His Disney and filmscore remix tracks are all available from his website, most for free or a donation, so go there for those tracks. You can also purchase this album from the site. [Check out Whisperlude for an incredible example]
