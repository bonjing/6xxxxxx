On August 3, 1995 a Taliban fighter plane forced down a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 plane with six Russian nationals on board in what would be called The Aerostan incident. The plane was forced to land not at their Kabul destination but Taliban controlled Kandahar. The men were held prisoner for one year by the Taliban who at that time controlled about half of Afghanistan during the Civil war in Afghanistan (1992â€“1996). The movie follows their captivity by the Taliban. The men were allowed to visit their aircraft for maintenance and after one year they were able to overpower their captors and restarted their plane.Even though the Taliban drove a number of vehicles onto the runway they were able to pick up enough speed to take off. Flying 60 metres off the ground they were able to avoid any Taliban aircraft and made their way out of Taliban airspace.
