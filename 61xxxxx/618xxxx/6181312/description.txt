Love? is the upcoming seventh studio album by American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez. Conceived during the pregnancy of her twins Emme and Max, Love? is Lopez's most personal album to date, taking inspiration from the birth of her twins and her own experiences with love.
Currently the album is set to include a mixture of previously recorded material, along with new records with Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and RedOne commissioned by Island Records. The album will combine R&B, pop music and hip hop songs for a mixture of club-ready singles as well as slower mid-tempo songs. Lopez refers to Love? as containing her best vocals to date.
