,miss_understood666,2011-02-19T20:42Z,Wait... how does this work?

Ok. extract the file in utorrent. go to the location that you extracted it in, and you will see that it is an EPUB file. you can read EPUB files on an amazon kindle or nook or you can download an E-reader program for your computer. I have a Link to a good one in the description you could also go online and find a program that converts EPUBs to PDFs. Hope this helps!"

 If you don't know how to use the internet to convert an EPUB file, you probably shouldn't be on TPB. Either that or your just lazy."
