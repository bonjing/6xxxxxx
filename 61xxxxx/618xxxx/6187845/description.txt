Hello fellow Wii gamers,


This software for Microsoft Windows is a tool that can format a hard drive with a WBFS partition and add Wii ISO images directly to a hard drive. I will make an effort to seed this when I can, and I will seed it often, but I am also relying on leechers to seed when I am not able to. If you find that this is not being seeded, usually there is a time when it will be seeded in the next 24 hours.. so please be patient.

The application itself should be self-explanatory, but if you do have any questions just post them here and I'm sure someone can answer you. Currently this is the latest version of the software, and as it is updated I will post the new torrent and remove the old one.

Have fun and happy gaming!


Sincerely,

The Wii Game Master
