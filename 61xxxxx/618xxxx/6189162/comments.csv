[T],despo1ler,2011-02-21T12:20Z,"I read ur thread in the forum about trusted status, Dont be upset if you are turned down on your first request, they generally want people to have been posting regular releases for several months and have a minimum of 3 or more full pages of uploads on their list before they get added as trusted. Thats why the skull actually means something, it has to be earned and is not just given to anyone who asks. 
  With the number of releases you are making and the number of seeds & peers on them your history will soon speak for itself and if anyone wants to question if they are genuine dont worry about it, let your releases speak for themselves :) .
 GL with getting a skull, your best bet will be to ask again in a cpl of months or so once you've built up a nice long list of posts, in the meantime keep up the good work"

Thanks mate"
,MarceloTF,2011-02-23T00:17Z,"Hey MXMG, why on the sample we can only hear the voice from the narrator and the other people from the left speaker? I tried many things and checked if the problem is here but, only your file (sample) seems to have this problem.

So Im a bit afraid to download the whole file, can you explain why is this happening?

Thx"

,EiNST3iN,2011-03-25T02:32Z,"@Viciously, your ""request"" for a skull is lame. MXMG will get a skull through ways he can't control in any manner of time. So you are the one losing out on good torrents. 

MXMG, good job!"
,Jack_Raiden,2011-03-27T20:00Z,"I'd like to know what MarceloTF wants to know. Prevented my download and seeding. Great video quality, though."
