From Classic Records 45 RPM Led Zeppelin box, recorded and presented here as 24/96 FLACs. 
You will need to resample these files to create an audio CD. Here's an example of a sox command to do this:
sox "01 Good Times Bad Times.wav" -b 16 "441/01 Good Times Bad Times.wav" rate -s -a 44100 dither -s
This creates a 16/44.1 WAV in a subfolder called 441.
