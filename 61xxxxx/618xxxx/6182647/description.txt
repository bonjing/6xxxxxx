Description
With iStopMotion Pro, the old and venerable process of stop motion animation is greatly improved and accelerated, bringing down production times and cost significantly. Here are some of the reasons for this:

* Immediate Feedback. 
With Onion Skinning you see what the animation is going to look like before you capture the frame.

* Instant Playback.
Because the frames do not have to be processed, watch your animation right away to see if it worked out the way you wanted.

* Get a Cue. 
Instead of creating a detailed X-sheet, load a real video, overlay it to the video input and use that as a guideline.

* WYSIWYG. 
If you use a greenscreen, the chroma keying in iStopMotion shows you what your frame will look like when recorded.

* Remote Control.
Use the Apple Remote to capture frames from a distance. This saves you travelling between your animation table and the computer keyboard.

* Integration.
Send your movies directly from iStopMotion Pro to Final Cut Pro.

Fits into Your Workflow
iStopMotion uses lossless compression to save individual frames into a QuickTime movie file. Use these files with the tools you already know, for example Final Cut Pro, for further editing in pristine quality. You can easily retouch single frames in an external image editing app such as Adobe Photoshop. When you save the image, iStopMotion automatically puts it back where it belongs. And finally build your very own customized control station by freely mapping the keyboard keys to any functionality you want.
