Yep, sometimes.  but some are just idjits like YOU!  Less than 8 hours after the torrent went up... the one seeder was probably the initial seed by Rabiner, you jerk!  None of the leechers have 100% yet, but the COULD have 99.9% and still list as ""leechers"".

In short... LEARN HOW TORRENTS WORK BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR YAP!"
