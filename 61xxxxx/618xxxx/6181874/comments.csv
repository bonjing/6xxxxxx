The file comes with EndNote X4.0.2 update. 
To include CWYW compatibility (without installing the update) copy the enclosed â€œEndNote CWYW Word 2011.bundleâ€ file and paste it in the directory:
Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Startup/Word/

Youâ€™re done! When you open Word, it will contain the familiar â€œEndNote X4â€ submenu under â€œToolsâ€.

Have fun!"

Please help!"
,hepps12,2011-12-29T14:04Z,"It works if you follow the instructions on the endnote homepage. http://www.endnote.com/support/faqs/cwyw/faq1.asp#macENX4

Follow the listed instructions from 1 to 8. "
,annamsj,2012-01-26T21:58Z,"nope, can´t make it work.... I give up."
,josdiiri,2012-03-25T21:38Z,"I just downloaded and it worked perfectly. Maybe the problem is that if you have Endnote 4.0 and not the updated version 4.0.2, the plugin is also missing from the endnote CWYW folder. If that's the case you have to copy the bundle in both endnote and office folders."
