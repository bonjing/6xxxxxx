,muratce020181,2011-02-19T15:34Z,low fps
[T],ADHDerby,2011-02-19T16:28Z,"This Tweak Pack is not intended to give a higher frame rate, but to improve the graphics quality.

If you want a higher frame rate, edit System.cfg and change the sys_spec_full, sys_spec_quality and q_quality values to 3.
This should give a higher frame rate than the default System.cfg because most debugging features are disabled."

,thompsoner,2011-02-21T15:47Z,"THANKS ADH Derby,it works nicely for me.However,I am having an issue with the missions.As I finish one mission and the next cutscene plays.It goes pitch black and the loading screen for the next mission would not appear.This only occured when I applied your tweak pack.How do I tweak to make it continous as selecting missions would be annoying as I lose my upgrades.How do I go about it?
Much appreciated"
