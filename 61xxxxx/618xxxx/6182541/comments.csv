,gertkukk,2011-02-19T13:25Z,where to I get the activation code?
,spawnholio666,2011-02-20T07:51Z,"To all of you looking for an activation code, you don't need one.

To install:

1. unrar the downloaded file
2. Mount the .cue file with daemon tools
3. Install the game
4. Explore the mounted disc and open the folder labeled ""POSTMORTEM"", copy the Dexter application file (the only file in that folder) and paste it into the Dexter game folder (where you installed it).
5. Play the game.

Thanks to the uploader for a clean upload, but the game is not worth the download.

Glad to help out the noobs though.
