welcome

@akind
welcome..n for rain man first i thought of doing it as 2ch now its 6ch...so size is 1.17gb...
bt video bitrate is 1000kbps..as its very old movie so i didnt felt of increasing it too much..mostly drama type movie so high bitrate was nt needed...n main thing its encoding is finished so i cannot increase it now..."
