Keith Lowell Jensen is best known as the atheist on 'The Coexist? Comedy Tour' and from Spike TV's Manswers where he was seen panhandling lunch money from a bus full of school children and labeled "The Bill Gates of Begging". To The Moon, his most recent live comedy CD, captures Jensen taking a break from touring to return to his hometown of Sacramento CA and perform an hour long set at a favorite venue, Luna's Juice Bar & Cafe. 
Subjects include people who bring kids to comedy shows, Jenny McCarthy's autism crusade and the trials of being constantly mistaken for a homosexual or as the comic puts it, being "hella gay at being straight." Jensen's core fan base may be at first disappointed to hear that he does not tackle religion on this recording but upon listening will find the skeptic's outlook front and center throughout.
