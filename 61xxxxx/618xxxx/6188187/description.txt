There's a simple, unassuming quality to Fayssoux's version of Rodney 

Crowell's "California Earthquake" on Early. The folk-country arrangement, a 

tasteful mix of acoustic guitar, dobro, bass, drums, Wurlitzer, accordion, 

electric guitar, and harmony, is spare and filled with open spaces. Fayssoux 

handles the vocal with feeling, adding a touch of country ache, but never 

oversinging. This simple approach quietly underpins the song, allowing the 

emotion to rise to the top naturally. This unassuming quality works equally 

well on the opener, the sadly sweet "The Blackest Crow," and the closer, a 

jubilant take on "Weepin' Mary." On the first, the song is underpinned by 

Lloyd Green's lovely steel work, and the harmony is bolstered by Emmylou 

Harris; on the latter, Fayssoux is joined on vocals by Sharon and Cheryl 

White and by mandolinist Ricky Skaggs. On occasion, Fayssoux adds variety 

to the overall blueprint, as when she cuts loose on the high-flying "Save It! 

Save It! with duet partner Peter Cooper (who also produced), and her song 

choices, from gospel to country to contemporary folk, generate a solid set list 

for Early. All of these qualities--solid songs, lively performances, and well-sung 

vocals--create a down-to-earth album that sounds good and that is easy to 

enjoy.
