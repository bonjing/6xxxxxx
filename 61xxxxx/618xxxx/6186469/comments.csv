,table543,2011-02-19T15:02Z,Iam just a home user but want the ultimate version already fixed . I have a Dell studio XPS 435 MT with i7 chip and 6gig DDR3 memory. You have so many versions here that are all great (but confusing). What version would you (or anyone out there) recommend??? Thanks for the fine posts and any help would be greatly appreciated!!

 if you want to know the serial of win 7, that not complicated, you need to follow this instructions:

 1-mount your iso with deamon tool

 2- follow this path in your virtual drive: 
 E:\sources\product.ini (letter can be different)

 3- open the product.ini with notes and you have all serials for each installation you want

 well done that not so hard ;)"
