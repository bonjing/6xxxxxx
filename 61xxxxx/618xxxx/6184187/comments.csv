I have a licensed version of Windows 7 home premium that came with my Dell laptop.

If i do a clean install of my laptop.

Can I install this as a new install and use the CD KEY that came with my Dell PC?"

Yes you can; but you will have to call Microsoft to activate the installation. From one dell owner to other, I recommend to do so, considering the amount of crap ware which comes with the system."
