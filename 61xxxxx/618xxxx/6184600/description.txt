MEET US INSIDE
Our first mini-album on a major label after Gary Vasicek (Midnight Oil) took us under his wing and dragged us up to Stockton beach to make the One of a Kind film clip that got the ball rolling on TV in Australia. Recorded at Rhinoceros studios in Surry Hills we began getting supports with big bands and getting the name around the traps. We were able to finally get off the dole and take a meager wage as we began touring constantly and developing our musical style
