Comments :
An ex-special agent CHA Tae-shik's only connection to the rest of the world 
is a little girl, So-mi, who lives nearby. Her mother, Hyo-jeong smuggles 
drugs from a drug trafficking organization and entrusts Tae-shik with the 
product without letting him know. The traffickers find out about her smuggling 
and kidnap both Hyo-jeong and So-mi. The gang promises to release them if Tae-shik 
makes a delivery for them, however it actually is a larger plot to eliminate a 
rival drug ring leader. When Hyo-jeon's disemboweled body is discovered, Tae-shik 
realizes that So-mi's life may also be in danger. Tae-shik becomes enraged at the 
prospect that So-mi may already be dead and prepares for a battle, putting his own 
life at risk.
