A carefree vacation to exotic Argentina turns into a sun-soaked nightmare for two young women who find themselves at the mercy of a cunning psychopath in this remake of director Robert Fuest's 1970 thriller. Stephanie (Amber Heard) and Ellie (Odette Yustman) are biking through the Argentinean countryside when they stop to spend the last night of their vacation in a secluded village. When darkness falls, the girls wander over to the nearest bar, where a handsome local charms Ellie while Stephanie heads back to the hotel to good night's sleep. But her rest is interrupted when Stephanie returns to the hotel with her new friend in tow, and a booze-fueled altercation ultimately leads the girls to miss their bus. The following day, Ellie leaves Stephanie alone in the countryside following a heated argument, and grows concerned when her traveling companion fails to meet her at a nearby restaurant shortly thereafter. In the wake of a chance meeting with American expatriate Michael (Karl Urban), whom she had previously seen getting into a minor altercation at the bar, Stephanie reports Ellie's disappearance to local policeman Calvo (CÃ©sar Vianco), who immediately dismisses her suspicions of foul play. Thankfully Michael displays a bit more concern than the local sheriff, and agrees to assist Stephanie in searching for Ellie. But now the more Stephanie confides in Michael, the more she begins to fear that he may have had something to do with Ellie's disappearance, and that by sticking with him she may be walking straight into his trap.
