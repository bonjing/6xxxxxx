Bill Staines is a classic folk artist that rarely sings a dud, so a "best of" cd is difficult to compile because it requires leaving out so many good songs. Consequently, the 'best of' release "The First Million Miles" has now been supplemented by this new release, "The First Million Miles, Volume 2" which picks up many of the tracks left off of the first volume. You may expect these to be the less essential Staines songs; however, this cd is actually better than the first compliation. If you are only going to own one Bill Staines cd or want a sampler of his music, this cd is the place to start.
