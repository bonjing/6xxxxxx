        Unlocking the autistic mind

        Imagine not being  able to engage  with the world  around you.
        Imagine not being  able to express  your feelings, dreams  and
        aspirations  to anyone,  even if  those feelings,  dreams and
        aspirations are in no way  less or inferior to those  of other
        people. Imagine having to depend upon the assistance of others
        with every  mundane task,  like dressing  or feeding yourself.
        Imagine living with all of these limitations, despite being of
        sound mind - aware of  everything that is going on  around you
        but incapable of letting anyone know.

        Narrated by  Academy Award-winning  actress Kate  Winslet, The
        Sunshine Boy tells the story of Margret, a mother who has done
        everything in  her power  to help  her 11  year-old son, Keli.
        Keli is severely autistic - his mother doesnt even know if he
        understands  Icelandic,  let alone  other  languages. Even  if
        Margret holds  no unrealistic  expectations on  behalf of  her
        son,  she  has a  quenchless  thirst for  knowledge  about the
        mysterious and complex condition that autism undeniably is.

        Margret  travels  to  the  United  States,  where  she   meets
        scientists in the  field of autism  and autism therapies,  and
        the parents of autistic children  who share her wish to  break
        down the wall between the children and the surrounding  world.
        After an  encounter with  Soma Mukhopadhyay,  an Indian mother
        who  has  developed  a unique  prompting  method  for training
        autistic children and teenagers, Margret learns that, perhaps,
        it is possible  to break down  the wall of  autism and get  to
        know the individual behind it...
