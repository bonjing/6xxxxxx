,bobadigilatis,2011-04-29T21:41Z,"Nice documentary, features most of the original  and certainly the most famous Rocksteady artists of all time. Has a great line up, great sound track and as stated in the info by soulrebel2008.. 'Think of it as a kind of Buena Vista Social Club for the great 60s architects of Jamaican music'

Unfortunately the colour balance is shocking (but very watchable), the sound is tip top, there are a few encoding errors [maybe my copy], but still very watchable.

The documentary is not made by the BBC, hence it has about as much information regarding the roots, history and culture of rocksteady as a packet of Honey Nut Cornflakes. This documentary  was broadcast by the BBC and ergo has the BBC logo in the top Left corner.

All-being said; don't be put-off downloading this gem, thanks muchly to Soulrebel2008 for the encoding and uploading of this. Keep up the fine work.

Peace, love and thanks!

For those interested in the history and roots of Jamacian music (not just rocksteady) take a look at Dub Echos [www.IMDb.com/title/tt1265968/] and for those seriously into the culture and history invest in the book 'Reggae Explosion The Story Of Jamacian Music - Chris Salewicz & Adrian Boot' [www.Â­amazon.Â­com/Â­Reggae-Â­Explosion-Â­Story-Â­Jamaican-Â­Music/Â­dp/Â­0810937891] hopeful a high quality PDF will soon be on the way.

One love.

P.s. Don't forget to seed!"
