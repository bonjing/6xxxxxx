,Metsyse,2011-07-09T07:01Z,"Ok......so what exactly does this do? as far as im seeing it keeps windows in a trial mode state in order to keep from having a cd key or license...am i close here? im wanting to run server 2008 and win7 on my computer for my website, so anything will help me out i guess.....im going to download and seed but id like to know what this is before i try to use it."

slmgr /rearm

will do the exact same thing"
