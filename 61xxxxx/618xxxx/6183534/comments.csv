Way less complicated than other Killing Floor torrents.

,voco6,2011-02-22T23:38Z,"Having a problem here.
I'm trying to play through hamachi with someone else but he can't connect to my listen server and vice versa, the dedicated server option doesn't work because an error pop's up saying it can't run the applications because steam_api.dll wasn't found and that reenstaling might correct the error...

if you can help it would be much appreciated!"
,HarrisA,2011-02-23T20:25Z,"Thank madworldpt, i made this work by using Garena instead of Hamachi which i found was much easier. If you want to host you have to choose listen server, open up ports when using a router and you also should try disabling the firewall much like madworld already said.
Thanks again.

Just follow the instructions and when using garena, use the revLoader.exe and don't worry about the 1011 thing, it's still 1017 and i'm guessing it will work on higher versions aswell, although you might need to find a patch as it sort off have the same function like a crack
Hope this helps y'all

,bseos,2011-04-11T23:25Z,"Latest version (v1018) of Killing Field has been ripped and pre-cracked, madworldpt could you please upload the following torrent here. 

Get the torrent for Killing Field v1018 from here:
www[DOT]mirrorsupload[DOT]com/files/0CWBPKF6/Killing_Floor_V.1018.torrent
(fix the url)

Install Instructions:
1. Mount ISO, install game by running""Killing Floor 1018.exe""
2. During the installation process, select English.
If you encounter any garbled language or text just skip it and proceed on.  (this is due to the installer being in native Russian)
3. Navigate to the directory where you just installed the game 
(ex. C:\Program Files\killingfloor) 
and edit ""rev.ini"" (in notepad, making sure Notepad is ""Run as Admisistrator"") and change the following: 
""Language = Russian"" CHANGE TO ""Language = English""
""PlayerName = ""ZomboUser"" CHANGE ""ZomboUser"" to desired name. 
4. Run ""RUN_KF.exe"" in (ex. C:\Program Files\killingfloor) to play game!"

Yes, steam doesnt work, but using a p2p VPN tool like Tunngle allows you to join KF servers hosted all over the world for free & unless you have v1018 (as most of the German and chinese hosts) you wont be allowed to connect due to version mismatch error."
,bseos,2011-04-12T08:09Z,"UPDATE: 
v1019 has been released. To get get the ""v1018 to 1019"" standalone update just google for this:

So after unpacking - change your name and then delete stats.bin in the Killing Floor directory. A new file will be made when the game is started and the perks now work fine."

Anyways, you could google ""Killing Floor no steam edition"" and the first (blog) on the list has a few links with the game and also some updates you could try, if still being plagued then google something like ""killing floor multiplayer trouble"" and eye trough w/e tutorial listed.
