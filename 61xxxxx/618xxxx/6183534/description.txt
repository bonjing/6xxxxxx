Killing floor v 1017

Playable on the internet, no lagg, so you don\'t need hamachi.



Read me:

1 - Unrar;
2 - Run \"Runmefirst.exe\" inside the killing floor folder;
3 - Run \"[KF] NameChanger.exe\" to change your name;
4 - Play from \"KF_revLoader.exe\".


Works through lan and internet. Haven\'t tried on hamachi, but it doesn\'t lagg if you play on the internet so you don\'t need to use it.

Have Fun.

If you get an error saying you need steam access, try to disable windows notifications, reboot, and run \"runmefirst.exe\" again.
