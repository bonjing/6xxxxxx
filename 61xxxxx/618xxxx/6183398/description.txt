The girls return to the Philippines to visit the remote island of Coron. Here,     they join the Tagbanua, a tribe of fishermen and farmers, where they train to      take part in a 12km raft race across the open sea. However, a crippling            injury forces one of the athletes to skip her lessons - leaving her                ill prepared for the challenge.
