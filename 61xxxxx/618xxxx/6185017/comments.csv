,Kronos666,2011-02-25T14:04Z,"thanks hd-r-us, you are the best"
,DKDiveDude,2011-03-02T00:03Z,"HD-R-US I sure appreciate your efforts for a format which will work in many devices.

I just burned this according to the instructions, with ImgBurn latest version, selecting ""Write image file to disc"" and burned to a DVD5 disc and it worked great on my PS3, however both my Toshiba HD-XA2 HD-DVD and my Pioneer DV-563A won't accept the disc, says ""Unknown format"".

What gives, any ideas? Thanks and keep up the good work!"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-03-02T16:59Z,"@everyone - You're welcome as always, enjoy. Requests are noted, but time is very limited at the moment.

@DKDiveDude - As stated in the torrent's notes, DVD players cannot read HD formats, where as your PS3 is an AVCHD capable blu-ray player. I hope this helps."
,DKDiveDude,2011-03-03T23:19Z,"In that case this text is a bit misleading or at least confusing ""Please note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT play this movie without re-encoding it."", as it gives the illusion that a regular DVD player will play, but by automatically re-encoding it to normal DVD resolution.

Also in that case I really don't see the big deal with this format, if not even my HD-DVD player can play it, not even my PC can play it without extracting files and folders. That does not seem like all-round format to me, as it is only working on my PS3. Just my opinion."
,pbsource9,2011-03-03T23:46Z,"GREAT STUFF HD-R-US!! THANK YOU
ONE QUESTION:
HOW DO I GET TO RUN SUBTITLES (THEY SHOULD BE HARDCODED)? MY BLUERAY PLAYER JUST CANNOT UPLOAD .SRT:( 

I CANNOT GET THEM RUNNING AT ALL (OK ON GOM, BUT WOULD LIKE TO WATCH ON TV BY PLAYING ON A REGULAR LG BLUERAY).
ANY ADIVICES?"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-03-04T01:53Z,"DKDiveDude - I really don't see how stating that regular DVD players will not play HD videos without re-encoding is misleading, but point noted. HD-DVD players will play these disc images if they are AVCHD compatible, the same goes for blu-ray players. You have a right to your opinion, but their is no other format or container that can be mounted and played on a computer, streamed, put on a WD hard drive, and also has the file structure to be burnt to a playable disc. Of course, it's more work for some, less for others, but it is the only all-round format. "

,keallineage,2011-04-02T17:14Z,I followed the instructions for burning to a DVD5 but then it won't play in a stand-alone BluRay player. Is it that my burner is not bluray?

,salmanshah,2011-04-19T19:00Z,"no screenshots,no sample! wtf.. but still thanks."
,salmanshah,2011-04-24T06:45Z,I have extracted the files to my computer but there is no menu option. So whats the use of making it m2ts format?
,Needleteeth,2011-04-26T22:51Z,"1.  If you use something like Virtual Clone Drive or MagicDisc, you can simply mount the iso file and watch it on your computer that way.

2. I've had success getting the discs to play on my blu ray player by burning them with DVDab.  Open them just like any other iso file, then go to the Main Movie tab in Blu Ray Copy.  In the pull down menu at the lower left, select BD5 1080p and burn.    The resulting discs will play in my Samsung blu ray player, whereas discs burned by the suggested method will not."
,blastoise483,2011-08-29T18:32Z,"Hi.I hav mac OS.I dont want to burn this movie to a disk.I just wana store in my hard drive and watch it.Can u just please tell me whether vlc player will play it? If no,then how to play it without burning
