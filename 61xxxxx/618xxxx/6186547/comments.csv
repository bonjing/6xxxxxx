[M],Lollash,2011-02-21T16:09Z,totomas1 > or maybe you need to learn how to use torrents. You can download each of the 4000 files by them self. you dont need to download all 4000.
[V],totomas1,2011-02-22T08:26Z,"Okey, Lollash, but I'm thinking like this. A torrent on 88 GB, sorry I don't download it (or parts of it), but if there were 10 torrents on 8 GB, I would download it and there would be more seeders (or rather leechers). But still, it's of course better with this one than none so keep up the good work :)"
