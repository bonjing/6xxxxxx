,qstoffe,2011-02-19T22:20Z,Thanks a million for posting all the Cross-Country races. Could you please re-seed some of the older races? I'm trying to download every race you've ever posted. Right now I'm stuck (15%) on the mens race in Gaellivare (2008-11-22).
,BasilBrush,2011-02-20T01:57Z,I'm sorry I deleted all of my old stuff - I needed the hard disk space for this years stuff. I've got all this years (2010/11) stuff if you need any of it.
