This is Omar's 2000 release on the Provogue label. The label includes and features such blues/rock artist as Walter Trout, Jay Hooks, Michel Katon and Carl Verheyen. Shortly after releasing this CD, Omar left and joined Blind Pig. "Screamin' Cat" is a swampy New Orleans blues/rock mix much in the style of the band Iko-Iko. On this particular release, Omar is joined by Papa Mali (CD "Thunder Chicken") and Papa's drummer Barry "Frosty" Smith, who add that critical bayou beat to the mix. Mali contributes on the slide guitar, dobro and baritone guitars, as well as theB-3 organ, while Frosty weighs in on the drums, percussion, B-3 organ and key bass. Omar's vocals on this release are a bit gravely and very similar to Dr. John's. All of the tunes are upbeat and full of energy. From a musical and technical perspective, there is not a bad track on the disc. PLAY LOUD!!!
