PLOT...: Shooting Fishâ€ draws together three very different actors: 
American Dan Futterman is the fast-talking Dylan, Irish Stuart Townsend 
is techno head Jez and Georgie is played by the very English Kate Beckinsale. 
â€œIâ€™m a girl from Chiswick and Stuartâ€™s a Dublin boy and then weâ€™ve got this 
New York Jewish American and we could have just hated each other and I donâ€™t 
know maybe they do hate me but I donâ€™t think soâ€”weâ€™ve got on really well,â€ 
Beckinsale explains. Overlaying a romantic triangle on the basic premise was 
a later development. The original inspiration for director Stefan Schwartz 
and his co-writer Richard Holmes came from stories about the notorious Kray brothers. 
â€œRich had a friend who knew someone whose brotherâ€™s sister was a driver for the Krays 
and had some neat scam stories,â€ says Schwartz. 


â€œShooting Fishâ€ was made on the inevitably tight budget where imagination counts 
for more than the power of cash. Shot all over London on dozens of different 
locations, the main set is the interior of a gasometer where Dylan and Jez 
live rent free away from prying eyes. â€œI donâ€™t want it to be straight reality, 
I donâ€™t want it to be gritty realism. This is about two unemployed people in 
Londonâ€”I donâ€™t want it to be grey housing blocks and deeply depressing. 
I want it to be sunny and bright and colourful and energetic,â€ Schwartz explains. 
The other challenge is to keep up the energy with the endless series of scams 
that the trio attempt. At one point they sell the same batch of insulation 
to every house in a row of terraces. The real bonus in â€œShooting Fishâ€ 
turns out to be Kate Beckinsale who is better known for her appearances in 
period films such as â€œMuch Ado About Nothingâ€ and the television version of â€œEmmaâ€. 
Judging by the success of â€œThe Full Montyâ€ and â€œThe Wedding Singerâ€ to name just 
two recent comedies, we have a healthy appetite for films that make us laugh. 
â€œShooting Fishâ€ doesnâ€™t have their broad appeal but it has a charm of its own 
and it is certainly different from the typical contemporary British product. 
Stefan Schwartzâ€™s first feature â€œSoft Top, Hard Shoulderâ€ won awards including 
best Scottish film of the year. With â€œShooting Fishâ€ he has produced a film big 
on heart and as light as a feather.
