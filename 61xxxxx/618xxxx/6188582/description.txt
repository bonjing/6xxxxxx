This is the landmark and multi-award winning film by Tony Palmer celebrating the Polish composer Gorecki, who died recently.

Palmer's film 'The Symphony of Sorrowful Songs' with soprano Dawn Upshaw and the London Sinfonietta conducted by David Zinman, captured imaginations with its overwhelming power and harrowingly simple lyrics.
