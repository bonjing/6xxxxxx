""Agree or not - ONLY RELIGION taught us to love!!
Without religion we would be living like fucking animals in the jungle!""

I am not trying to get in the middle off some dumb ass religion fight, cause they never go anywhere, it's not like you or they are gonna change one another's opinions, but to say religion is the only thing that taught us to love is just ignorance. Would you not agree that in history most of our battles and wars were fought over religion (and i am not talking about recent events, entire human race)? For you not to agree would be obvious ignorance. Every religion thinks ""there's"" is the ""right"" one, and look's different at anyone who disagrees (as you have proven) to me religion has taught us how to segregate ourselves from one another and not unite.

Personally it truly does not matter what you believe to me, I think what ever you believe, and it makes you a better person then more power to you. But please don't sit here and say ""the only reason we love"" cause I don't believe in a religion, and I know the reason I love my family, and my girlfriend is not because of religion."
