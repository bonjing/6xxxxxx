Tagline: Blood is never simple. 
Storyline: The story of a Los Angeles hit man. Corrado is the best there is in the city of LA. Pimped by his nefarious handler, Frankie, he performs jobs ranging from tune-ups to outright hits. Frankie loves Corrado for his lack of mercy, for his coldness and readiness to do the job no matter what. Now Frankie has a pearl of a job for Corrado - hit the aging kingpin Vittorio Spinello in his own house. Make it look like Vittorio's death is an accident, get out, and $500K is his. Corrado readily accepts. Corrado is about to perform the hit when he is interrupted by Vittorio's brand new live in nurse, Julia, and winds up shooting Vittorio dead and escaping out the window to leave Julia holding the bag. Julia doesn't have to wait long for Vittorio's son Paolo to discover her standing by his father's corpse. In an unreasonable rage he accuses her of killing his father, or at least being complicit in his death...
