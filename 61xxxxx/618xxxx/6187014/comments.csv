Thanks for this great torrent, but could you actually please explain the differences between these torrents:

I am really confused deciding which one to download, as I said before... I was looking for something recent, activated and Ultimate with SP1 32 bits."
,prudi435,2011-02-25T15:56Z,is this already activated?? or we hve to do it with 7 loader??
,gjsmoney,2011-02-27T19:56Z,"Hi thethingy
When downloading Windows 7 Ultimate, how do I know which version to download? x86 or x64? Does it make a difference? 

Thanks"

x86 or 32bit and x64 are based on the processor you are using. You should check if your processor can support x64bit Operating System, if not then you have to download the x86 which is the same as 32bit."

,Mikemizell23,2012-01-04T18:48Z,"If any one can help me.  I downloaded this app and burned to a DVD at normal speed 24x.  Went to install and go thru the first three steps and said it needs to restart and it got out of the install process and back to desktop.  So I restarted and and looked like it was completing the loading and then went to like safe mode and said windows installation could not start or something like that.  And gave a choice to start up in vista again.  Why, what am I doing wrong????"
