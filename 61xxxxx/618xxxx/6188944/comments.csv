I'm getting the same prob as u, Wmp & Nero Wave Editor wont open the songs in that album & Winamp & Media Player Classic (Home Cinema) play them but wont start from the beginning, without displaying the track's duration thus no progress bar/Seeker thus not able to rewind nor forward."
,Kashxk,2011-12-04T16:40Z,"@ rosie1966

Are those albums ripped from the originals .wav cds?

(Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the quality is not good.)"
