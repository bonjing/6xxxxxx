,Tulkoju,2011-04-10T21:53Z,"The above person is the anonymous person who uploaded this torrent, right?

In the crack folder there is a Trojan warning in the ""leer - read.txt"" stating that the installer has a trojan but that the crack files are ok.

I scanned all files with ""AntiVir"" and found nothing, but I'm not going to risk it."
,freeware,2011-04-29T21:33Z,AVG didn't find any threats.
,bbutton1,2011-05-23T16:01Z,"Lol, you never heard of false alarms? Cracks are often being identifed as trojans..."
,YtownRedRum187,2011-06-28T12:41Z,"Almost every application I download from TPB that needs to be patched alerts my Norton 360 SONAR Protection. Never once, after installing the file and patching it, have I EVER had a problem with viruses in my computer. Disable your protection while it downloads and installs (and you patch it), then reenable it. Bet it works fine! Great job ""Anonymous""! Thanks again!"

It still has options to register/activate, though. Let's wait 15 days to see if it's all ok! :)"
,Rubinder,2011-08-31T08:22Z,@Usurario plz let me know if it works
,the_one_one,2011-08-31T21:24Z,Version 11 is available
,Eagle1492,2011-09-29T06:01Z,"This what I tried with no luck!

1. Install the program
2. Goto Start-up > Control panel > Administration > Services
 3. Stop the service ""ABBYY FineReader Licensing Service"" 
4. Unrar patch files and overwrite all three into X:/Program Files/ABBYY FineReader
 5. Restart service ""ABBYY FineReader Licensing Service""
 6. Launch and Enjoy ABBYY FineReader Pro "";0)) 

1) Install ""ABBYY FineReader Pro v10.0.102.95.exe"" and close the program when the installation finished.

2) Copy the cracked files in install folder, by default:
C:\Program Files\ABBYY FineReader 10.0

and Overwrite the existent files.

I tried stopping and also put startup type in disabled in Licensing Service. If there was a way to make the program think that it has checked the RPC server and permission was granted might be a back door there.  Help in activating is needed. "

,physician9,2011-11-06T15:27Z,"Awesome torrent. Works just excellent. I tested it with several AV's and found nothing suspicious.
Thanks uploader!"
