,godofwrath08,2011-02-21T00:12Z,dnt even listen to this noob guys ive worked with windows for years and a dell optiplexs graphics card cannot handle win7 with aero enabled which needs to be enabled for it to run properly otherwise u end up with low colours and choppy videos as the graphics drivers rnt compatible even wen run under xp as aero themes are essential for win7 looks and performance honastly what a complete idiot this guy is.
,godofwrath08,2011-02-21T00:14Z,i mean the uploader btw guys.

LIKE I SAID... I RAN IT IN COMPATABILITY MODE FOR XP PROFESSIONAL AND """"IT IS WORKING""""

,saqi8,2011-02-21T16:46Z,"trin02 for you
there is no windows 7 drivers at dell desktop website..
for gx series...because these are old pc's."
,{HMP},2011-02-22T00:56Z,"that is what im saying, its an old graphics card and old driver. this is the latest driver from dell websit (to run on xp service pack 3) so the only way to make it run on win7 is to run it in compatibility mode for windows xp service pack3. it still works fine, im able to use youtube and stuff and watch videos on media player with no problems or clitch what so ever. BUT, for it to work on win 7 without changing graphics card is to run it in compatability mode for windows xp service pack 3.

just aint got the cash for a new graphics card right noe.... could realy do with a new pc to be honest lol"
,{HMP},2011-02-22T01:00Z,"My pc is older than my grandma lol but with a bit of fiddling about its on windows 7 professional with an overlocked 2.8 processor and 2gb ram lol

money aint too good these days, ya gotta make adjustments !!!"
,saqi8,2011-02-22T11:24Z,great HMP.........thanks for your sharing......
,saqi8,2011-02-22T11:26Z,n i run with 1gb ram 2.8 processor........lol........still having no problem.........
,{HMP},2011-02-22T20:21Z,"@ saqi8, 
thanks m8 for the comment, people must think you don't know what your talking about lol

als, i feel so much better knowing im not the only one using a very old pc with 1gb ram and 2.8 processor pmsl !!!

why pay money for new graphics cards when there is a way of making this driver work on all versions of windows 7.

and like i said.... i should know.... im using the exact driver on standard optiplex computer and having no problems what so ever !!!

IF IT DID'T WORK GUYS I WOULDN'T SHARE (OBVIOUSLY)"
,{HMP},2011-02-24T00:14Z,EVER HEARD THE SAYING..... IF IT'S NOT BROKEN DON'T TRY AND FIX IT ??
