[V],bestec1234,2011-02-20T13:43Z,"Looks like you'd be better off getting Nadia content from eation.  I don't have that much.  I think she did lots of stuff outside of Figurebaby.

I was going to do a torrent of all Maya stuff ... so I can make that my next one.  Hopefully sometime today.

Adora... don't know which one that is right off the bat...  a figurebaby or ATK model?"
,SRVDT,2011-02-20T17:40Z,Thanks to both of you. And glad you like the username
