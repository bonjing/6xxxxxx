The torrent worked for 1 day, now my  180 days are returned to 0 days! How can I change this again?

What I have already tried:
- I have delete norton with Norton Remove Tool. And I have installed it again, but my days are still 0!

What to do? Thanks."

,LR82,2011-04-19T05:24Z,"The crack here does not work very well..  after a few restarts and days it starts back to the begining having to recrack, eventually it wont even let the crack install.
I have had Norton working for 4 weeks now.  I downloaded
--Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.3.1 by BOX! (Works with Norton Internet Security, Norton AntiVirus and Norton 360)--

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6191150/

1. Uninstall Norton & restart.
2. Run NTR to purge norton.
3. Install Norton
4. Turn off 'Norton Tamper Protection' (it will automatically turn back on once cracked)
5. Install NTR v3.3.1 By BOX!
6. Once the crack is installed, create a Norton account to get rid of the nag or log into your account
And your DONE :-)

Its actually quite quick to do really.

*Thanks to the people from here and Rupert77, putting it all together i got it working at last*

This program is for the NIS2011 {18.5.0.125}, NAV2011 {18.5.0.125}, 
and all Norton 360 versions {5.0.125}."

,sashu545,2011-04-24T01:23Z,Hey Rupert77 PLease help me. When i try to install NTR v3.3.0 By BOX Windows tells me that it cannot specify the path. This happens for alot of cracks please help
,Ryan753,2011-04-24T07:10Z,"@ sashu545; download/use the latest Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.3.1 by BOX  @ http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6191150/
and follow directions from the top using this new trial reset.

@ Rupert77; Thank's a million !!! You're the man !!!
One question, once is already ""cracked"" or ""up to the full 180 days"", regarding step 4, {4. Turn off 'Norton Tamper Protection' (it will automatically turn back on once cracked)}; ...would it be reasonable to turn the NTP permanently off after it came back on? or, should I leave it on? (I opted for turning it off) Thank's once again, works awesome (so far) in win vista 64 bit. One last piece of advice to all; At the beginning of the 360's installation, there's a ""checked by default"" little square, that asks; if you want to send information to Symantec blah, blah, blah...UNCHECK!! (some may overlook this little detail) Cheers !! :)"

,dinodig,2011-05-11T11:04Z,Whats the difference between N360 5 and N360 5 Premier Edition? Which is better?

HOW TO MAKE N360 (CRACK) WORK FOREVER


The only mistake all you people do is checking ""Automatic Updates"" on or by using ""Live Update"".

Using updates also brings in patches to nullify the Trail Resetter.

Therefore keep using a newer version or NTR or (better) download the virus definition updates from Norton website itself. It may be a big file but downloading once in a month is good enough for most users.

SITE: http://www.symantec.com/business/security_response/definitions/download/detail.jsp?gid=savce


I always do this and I never had a problem(but just a desire to use a newer version :-) )"
