Comments :
Hae-won is a beautiful single woman in her thirties who works at a bank in the Seoul 
city. She leads a busy life until she becomes a witness to an attempted murder case, 
and at the same time, things get complicated at work. When things get out of hand she 
is forced to take a vacation so she heads for 'Moodo', a small undeveloped island, 
where she had once visited to see her grandparents. And where she had befriended a 
girl named Bok-nam who stills writes to Hae-won asking her to visit despite the fact 
that Hae-won never bothered to reply. Upon arriving at the island, Hae-won is shocked 
to see everyone treating Bok-nam like a slave. As practically the only young woman on 
the island, she is a plaything for all the men and a free laborer for the women. Sick 
of all the inhumane treatment, Bok-nam had tried to escape the island several times in 
the past but had failed each time. She begs Hae-won to help her escape the place..
