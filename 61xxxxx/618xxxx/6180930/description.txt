                       Contra Hard Corps. For PC.
                       -------------------------

The Contra series finally makes its way to the Sega Genesis with Contra: Hard Corps. Picking up five years after the first game ended, the world is under attack by an army of biogenetic experiments gone bad, and it's your duty to put things right and wipe out the mutant armada.

Story
-----
When there's a hideous alien race, mad terrorist army, or just some general madman scumball to be eliminated, there's only one team to do the job: the Hard Corps.

Now some madman military commander has stolen an alien cell; a remainder of the Alien Wars. He plans on using the cell to resurrect and clone Red Falcon, the most dangerous alien ever to exist! If he wins, the world as we know it is history!

The Hard Corps must stop his plans from being set into motion and destroy that alien cell before the Earth is destroyed!

Gameplay
--------
Playing as one of four gun-toting warriors, you'll be confronted with 10 grueling levels of scum-blasting action as you try to save the planet. Take advantage of the high-powered weapons at your disposal, like the homing gun, crush gun, needle laser, and mine setter, to deal out the damage. As the game progresses, you'll face many boss characters and choices, which will affect the game's ending, should you get that far.

Hard Corps looks terrific considering its age. There is no noticeable breakup or slowdown, and huge well-drawn bosses animate fluidly. There's lots of huge explosions, and even some neat special effects like in the boss fight against the giant robot who chases you down a highway. Enemy design is excellent and sometimes wacky, ranging from a giant cyclops robot to a bunch of tiles that form a tank and a helicopter.

Hard Corps has some awesome, fast music. My favorite is â€œFormat Xâ€, played while fighting the mad scientist bosses. There's hardly a bad tune in the bunch, it's all good. The sound effects are good too, with lots of explosions and even a few voices. Very good sound effects and great music, one of the best action game soundtracks on the Genesis.
