And thank you for all the hard work and effort in making these available to us... "
,midge8,2011-02-20T05:36Z,"Thanks for Spartacus. I notice it isn't on the schedule, is it just one that you do if time permits?"
,highres99,2011-02-20T09:06Z,"Thanx 20-40 for Fringe and every other of yr E/U! we really appreciate them. RESPECT, Bro!!! may God reward you with your heart desires, AMEEEEEEN!!!!!! can i get an AMEN from all you brothers and sisters out there???"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-20T09:27Z,"@midge8: During Season One fans of Spartacus organized a sort of crusade and called me ""motherfucker"" many times.  

It must be that, right?"
,highres99,2011-02-20T11:14Z,"@20-40: you can certainly count me out of the CRUSADERS that called you muthafucker. i remember dl spartacus from you 1 or 2 months before it was officially aired. i beg of you to kindly ignore the muthafuckas for that and consider that a lot of us appreciate what you've been doing for us. Thanx for your anticipated understanding. as always, RESPECT!!!!"
,rojenatgmail,2011-02-20T11:50Z,"Thanks for Fringe, Supernatural, Star Wars, Young Justice, Spartacus"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-20T13:45Z,"@highres99: Instead of been happy, to have a look on first two episodes before the airing  - I obviously rattled their cage too much - and to the point when I swore to myself to never ever even touch that show (which I haven't watched myself 'cause I have no interest at all). Well, now, I bite the shit every week and encode human-acceptable size... and present fans of Spartacus show should understand that I would encode future episodes only as ""secondaries""."
,highres99,2011-02-20T14:05Z,"@20-40: primary or secondary priority, it really dont matter. good thing's that you've even reconsidered doing the show and for that, myself and countless others appreciate it a lot. i'm quite sure that majority of those that dl from you are probably unregistered members of this wonderful family(TPB) we belong to, and i'm also pretty sure that upon the bad/negative comments the ingrates leave behind, they actually dl from you, too. thanx for your understanding, and i pray incidents like these dont affect yr judgement with regards to doing shows for the good guys. RESPECT!!"
