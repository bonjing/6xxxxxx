,corumuk,2011-03-05T22:21Z,"this installs fine but when i go into 
tools - options - system
and look in 'extras and safety camera's'
nothing new shows up, just the old files?
so i take it the unit hasn't recognised the data
garmin nuvi 255w.
any tips appreciated."
,corumuk,2011-03-05T22:30Z,"ok had another go, this time first deleting all the existing files in the poi folder.
as before, after running the installer and rebooting the device there is nothing in
'tools-settings-system-about'
to indicate any speed camera data is present."

Don't touch the stuff! Get real ones instead."
