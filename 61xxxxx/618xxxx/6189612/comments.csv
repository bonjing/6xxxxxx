Wow, thanks for the ABBA.  I have theses cd's 
myself, and they sound the best - NOT all loud
and compressed and dripping with noise reduction.

Recommended !!

,hvom,2011-02-21T23:00Z,"Nice that you like it. ""The Album"" (Polydor) isn't that good due to a bad source which is causing some distortion. The alternative is to go for the 2001 remaster which is based on good tapes but with less dynamics. "
,hvom,2011-02-21T23:25Z,Does anyone have Waterloo 1988 Polar (POLCD 252)? 
,yabetaripper,2011-02-24T05:38Z,"Thanks hvom  +1 (but stuck at 90%)

I'll check to see if I have Waterloo 1988 Polar (POLCD 252)."
,Rapidload,2011-02-24T21:35Z,Unfinished at 90 %. Hvom?
,hvom,2011-02-25T18:58Z,Yabetaripper: That would be perfect. Please let me know if you have it.
