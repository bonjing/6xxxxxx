,Shazam_777,2011-02-19T08:28Z,"no trojans or anything. but if u know how tpb runs, you know they dont like links to other sites. this is exactly what this file is. the url is another site--forum where you can download the map files."
,shrifty,2011-02-20T01:37Z,"I stand corrected on this one.  Typically when someone posts a file such as this it contains some type of malware, or a link to download it."
