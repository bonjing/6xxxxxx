Audio and video are a perfect 10. The producers could of used some more effects to the projectiles of the trebuchets (Explosion when they hit the walls of Milan), but besides that, there was a good balance of good story line and just corny parts. So I'm giving the video a 7.

Excellent torrent, this copy is good."
