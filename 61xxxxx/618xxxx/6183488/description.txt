Saint Clair has her tube socks on. This was a confusing set. We didn\'t 
know what to do with the outfit, or if the socks belonged at all. You\'ll 
have to decide that.

Something about St Clair reminds me of the song \"Cleveland Rocks.\" Maybe 
it\'s her attitude, or her style, but it\'s something very cool. You get a 
sense of that here, and her down to earth character comes through. 
Suggested listening for this set is Mott the Hoople, obviously.
