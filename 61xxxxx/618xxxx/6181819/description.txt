Description:

When a high-tech ninja from the Far East attacks Titans Tower, Robin, Starfire, Cyborg, Raven, and Beast Boy spring into action and bring him down. But when Robin finds out the ninja was sent by a mysterious and menacing Japanese criminal known as Brushogunâ€¦ our heroes realize that the action isnâ€™t over â€” itâ€™s just getting started. So the Titans pack their bags, hop in the T-Ship, and take off for Tokyo on mission to track down Brushogun â€” and bring him to justice. But can our teenage heroes stay out of trouble in the City That Never Blinks? And can Robin solve the mystery of Brushogun before our villain takes down the Titans â€” and destroys everything Robin 
is?

Personal note:
i hate Season 5 Episode 13
Note to thepiratebay admins:
why is the keyword "teen titans" banned from your Video->Movies DVDR section?
that would be the correct place for this torrent, but ill just put it under "TV Shows" for now... could some admin/moderator move it please?
