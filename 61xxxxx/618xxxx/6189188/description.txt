View fast
ACDSee 12's viewing speed is second to none. Open photos from anywhere on your computer or e-mail with the fastest image viewing technology available. That means you spend less time waiting for your photos to load and more time enjoying them. Zoom through your latest shots, browse instant slide showsâ€™, and enjoy full-size previews. Looking at your photos has never been this fun or this fast.

Browse your collection
Browse all your photos right away. Unlike catalog-based photo applications, you donâ€™t need to waste valuable time importing files that are already on your computer and connected devices. Access your folders and files live, in real time. Sort, group and filter photos by camera information, edited state or other criteria for super fast scanning. You can also browse by date or event to see photos from a specific occasion.
Organize from the start
Hit the ground running. Specify categories, add keywords and create backups as you upload photos from your camera, card reader or other device. When importing is done, your images are ready for you to browse and share.
Manage everything in one place
Bring together over 100 file types into one convenient place. View, manage, and get extensive format support for your photos, audio, and video clips including BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, PSD, MP3, MPEG, TIFF, WAV and many others. Take a look at the complete list of supported file formats.
"I think ACDSee is the best, most complete and reliable software."
- Marcos Molina, Palma de Mallorca, Spain

Keep track of all your photos
Manage your collection the way that works best for you. Unlike other photo software, ACDSee doesn't impose a one-size-fits-all organization system. Create your own categories and keywords, mark favorites, edit your metadata, and rate your shots. Rename, resize, rotate, or edit file information on groups of photos at once. Plus tag your best photos and bring them all together for further editing or sharing.

Find any photo
ACDSee 12's powerful search tools can help you find any photo, even if you have thousands in your collection. Enter keyword phrases like â€œsummer vacationâ€ or â€œschool playâ€, search only specific folders, and find that one special image with the Quick Search bar. Or perform more detailed searches and save them for ongoing use.
"As an avid digital photographer with just under 23,000 digital photos, itâ€™s important that I have a great tool for keeping things organized. The search function is excellent and very fast, and when you have as many photos as I do, speed matters."
- Jason Dunn, Executive Editor, Digital Home Thoughts
Perfect your photos with easy-to-use editing tools
Instantly correct exposure, fix red eye, and erase unwanted objects. Rescue photos that are too light or dark with a single click. Turn your photos black and white, add text, and put a finishing touch such as a vignette, border or drop shadow. Apply creative effects to selected areas of your photos. Edit with the peace of mind that your original files are never altered. With ACDSee, it's never too late to achieve the shot you were hoping to get.
