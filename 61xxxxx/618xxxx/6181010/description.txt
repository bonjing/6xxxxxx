I couldn't find this service manual hosted anywhere in the bay. Knowing some people, like myself, own a 1st generation Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth Neon(95-99) and aren't certified mechanics we need a no strings outside source of knowledge.

Here I present a digital(pdf format) Service Manual.


I will be seeding on/off for a month depending on my connection.
