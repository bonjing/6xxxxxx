Synopsis:
Spanning 20 years and two continents, "Mary and Max" tells of a pen-pal relationship between two very different people: Mary Dinkle, a chubby, lonely eight-year-old living in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia; and Max Horovitz, a severely obese, 44-year-old Jewish man with Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome living in the chaos of New York City. As "Mary and Max" chronicles Mary's trip from adolescence to adulthood, and Maxâ€™s passage from middle to old age, it explores a bond that survives much more than the average friendshipâ€™s ups-and-downs. Like Elliot and Coombsâ€™'Oscar(R) winning animated short "Harvie Krumpet", "Mary and Max"is both hilarious and poignant as it takes us on a journey that explores friendship, autism, taxidermy, psychiatry, alcoholism, where babies come from, obesity, kleptomania, sexual differences, trust, copulating dogs, religious differences, agoraphobia and many more of life's surprises.
