,whenicry,2011-03-07T08:21Z,"File is clean 100%
Because this is installer method then avira detect it.
You can scan another installer or setup file you will get the same problem"
,Piszkos12,2011-03-22T20:46Z,"file is not clean!
NOD32 detecting too..."
,jhemarie03,2011-04-16T03:05Z,"hahaha...u all facking noobs, who might not know what is a cracked software, you should read what programmers can do, all cracked softwares of cracks are all detected as virus, malwares or even trojans...hahaha...try to study first before commenting"
,Meadows_zeta,2011-04-16T11:34Z,"This is infected. Here's the deal:

The compressed archive automatically unpacks the LEGIT release, complete with the crack too.

BUT: it also asks you to run a certain ""setup.exe"" - UAC will stop this. If you run it anyway, it installs a backdoor trojan in 3 locations on your computer, but Malwarebytes can remove it with a quick scan.

Use UAC, and be careful when you unpack it. ""Setup.exe"" is some bullshit that you should NOT run. Instead, go to the unpack folder, run the exe called ""cFosSpeed blabla something"", and use the Crack folder when done.

There are no keygens, so this is NOT a false-positive. There's a crack executable. ""setup.exe"" and ""dx-diag.exe"" are REAL positives, do not run them.

Use a sandbox, or scan your PC afterwards."
