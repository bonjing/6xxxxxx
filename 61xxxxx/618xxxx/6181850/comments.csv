[T],n2kmaster,2011-02-19T23:42Z,"No problem, i have massive amounts more to put up, they are all in MP4 format, reason for it, i replaced cable in my house, i hate paying for cable cuz its pointless, i collected like 6000+ tv shows and 600+ movies and converted them all to save space, didnt know as many people liked MP4's for handhelds, they aint the highest resolution but framerate was kept over quality so i could fit as many shows in as possible. Theres tonnes more coming, just gotta get more seeds for them all"
