      Many of the most famous passenger liners in history were
      built in the British Isles, several in the shipyards along the
      banks of the Clyde. This series combines personal accounts and
      archive footage to evoke a vivid picture of the unique culture
      that grew up in the Clyde shipyards. Despite some of the
      harshest working conditions in industrial history and dire
      industrial relations, it was here that the Queen Mary, the Queen
      Elizabeth and the QE2 were built. Such was the Clyde
      shipbuilders' pride in their work, and the strength of public
      support, that in 1971 they were able to defy a government
      attempt to close them down and win the right to carry on
      shipbuilding.
