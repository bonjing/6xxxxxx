Makes the people who actually upload (and who idiots like bfpg8989 leech from - who probably closed his torrentprog and never looked back after the movie was 100%) not throw in so much speed at all.

So thnx for the up extreme (as usual) and thnx to those who actually seed more than 1:1."

Given the max speed (wich is then 3 MB/s or about 24mb/s) is hard to get since there's traffic etc. I d/l this movie in 15 mins or so, so it's not the torrent."

Begging for ""seeding"" does nothing, other tan show you for the basement living, mom loving, dimwit that you are. 
Even if it takes 1 day or 2 days to d/l, how much did you pay ? Figure 8 bucks for ticket to theater, 15 bucks popcorn and drink. That's 23 dollars you can spend on a new Ed Hardy t-shirt.

,mugginsville2000,2011-03-05T23:27Z,so im a total newb and was wondering how i seed after a download is done.  if i delete the torrent from my library but i keep the files in the directory they download to will it still seed the file?  any help would be much appreciated
,louwmari,2011-03-06T17:51Z,Thanks guys!
,BerserkTomte,2011-03-06T18:04Z,"mugginsville2000:
You can delete the .torrent file you downloaded. As long as the .torrent file is active in your Torrent client, it will keep uploading, provided you did not move any of the files from their download directory.
(If you do move them, you will need to specify the new location for the client for it to seed, in its complete state. For example if it was a folder with several files in it, you need to keep the folder intact as it is, to be able to seed from it)"

,babesbeersbbq,2011-03-20T12:36Z,how do i make bittorrent faster???
,JDFan,2011-03-21T04:08Z,"For those asking how to make the torrent speed faster -- Be sure not to leave your upload speed set to unlimited is the main thing I have found that speeds things up !! -- leave around 15 - 20% of your max speed unused for uploading ( Having it set to unlimited will cause slowdowns as the downloads speed increases due to the overhead that is needed to maintain all of the connections and send requests for pieces.) having it set to unlimited will quickly have the torrent program maxing the available upload bandwidth and there will not be enough for your system to maintain the connections with others and request pieces for download slowing the download speed. --- you want to share by uploading but in order to get a good download speed you need to cap the upload to about 80-85% of your capacity to allow the connections to be maintained without effecting performance.

Also while doing this set your max upload connections to a reasonable amount depending on your connection speed so that each connection you make will be given more but you'll have fewer connections to maintain ( ie. if your upload speed is set to say 500KB\s limit upload connections to say 50 or so -- that way you will only be uploading to 50 others but will be giving an average of 10KB\s to each instead of having 500 connections to upload to but only giving 1KB\s to each one. (this will also help download speed since 50 connections takes less overhead than 500 !)"
,The NbL,2011-03-21T22:29Z,"Or...have an old machine running linux as your downloader. I have an old P4 in the laundry room with a 32gb SD stickin out of it. The distro is trimmed down for the sole purpose of bittorrent downloading....very fast as nothing else is accessing the net. Take the card out and dump on my big machine. I have the upload set to 50% of potential.

Movie wasn't great either. The female actress does a poor job. I'm not going to discuss any scenes (and please don't, it just ruins it all for everyone else), though I do feel she could have been more committed to the act. Sometimes it's like she just blurts out her lines. There's no feeling, just saying a couple of words and getting paid. I've seen 13-year olds with a better commitment to acting than she has. And yes, I do mean that.

It expands on the French film a lot, is more suspenseful, and has a more detailed and elaborate plot (and, as a result, is over 30 minutes longer). Russell Crowe does a fantastic job, though the actress that plays the wife was better in the French version. Excellent directing.

I generally prefer the original (foreign) film to the American remake, but this is an exception."
