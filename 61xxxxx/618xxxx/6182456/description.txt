"The Bikini in the Soup"

The liquefied remains of a wedding planner 
are found in her home tanning bed on 
Valentine's Day, and Cam pressures her 
team to solve the case in time so she can 
celebrate the holiday with her boyfriend. 
While the "squints" works tirelessly in 
the lab, Booth and Brennan interrogate a 
slew of possible suspects until they 
unlock classified files in the victim's 
computer, which lead to their main 
suspect. Meanwhile, Booth and Brennan 
downplay the significance of Valentine's 
Day, and Hodgins tries to plan a romantic 
day for Angela, but "squint" Clark (guest 
star Byrd) helps him realize that the most 
meaningful gifts come from the heart.

Enjoy :)
