Papillon is a 1973 film based on the best selling novel by French ex-convict Henri Charriere. 
The film was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starred Steve McQueen as Henri Charriere 
["Papillon"] and Dustin Hoffman as Louis Dega. Due to the exotic locations, the film was 
considered as very expensive at the time of shooting [$12M], but earned more than double that
in its first year of release..


Henri Charriere makes friends with fellow inmate Louis Dega while they are serving a sentence 
on Devil's Island, a hellish, notorious island prison and he plots his escape.

The petty criminal known as Papillon is unjustly convicted of murder [specifically, murdering a pimp] 
in the 1930s and sentenced to life imprisonment in a French penitentiary on Devil's Island in 
French Guiana. He attempts several escapes, which result in many punishments, but after more 
than a decade [at least seven years of which were spent in solitary confinement as punishment 
for his escape attempts]
