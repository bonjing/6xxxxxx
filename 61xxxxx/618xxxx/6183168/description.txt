this film has never been released on dvd so dont expect the quality to be perfect, its fine to watch and its a very rare film not seen on t.v any more so i was delighted to get this and i watched it and quality is good considering its never been restored. young pud is orphaned and left in the care of his aged grandparents. the boy and his cantankerous grandfather become inseperable friends, but gramps is concerned for his grandsons future and wary of a scheming relative who seeks puds custody. one day mr brink an agent of death arrives to take gramps "to the land where the woodbine twineth" through a bit of trickery, gramps confines mr brink and thus death, to the top of an old apple tree, giving gramps extra time to resolve issues about puds future. lional barrymore is gramps. 1939 b/w run time 99 min
