,XIII_Black_Cat,2011-02-19T03:21Z,"Please Seed. All 60+ of us have gotten to 33.4%.
  If you could seed for a while longer we could finish downloading and help seed too."

,Element_alchemist,2011-03-06T20:55Z,uhg i am sooo angry my  crappy computer can not handle this high quality rip :( nicely done i guess i cant actually watch it but whatever i'll still seed. I just wanna buy this movie but every store i have looked at hasn't had it i should have got it at katsucon when i had the chance.
,ricanso1125,2011-03-07T16:03Z,"@ Element_alchemist
search for ""convert x to dvd"" on here or using Vuze. Its an easy way to burn this and other movies to a dvd. It is playable on a dvd player and creates a menu and chapters for you. all you do it drag and drop and push a button"
,ricanso1125,2011-03-07T16:04Z,My computer can't handle the resolution either xD
,fifaloo,2011-03-08T16:55Z,The movie has no audio at all
,ricanso1125,2011-03-09T15:01Z,@fifaloo you're the first to have this problem
,leyon533,2011-04-04T17:25Z,Please SEED! I really wanna watch this Movie! please i beg you to Seed!
,AljedSicken,2011-04-14T09:06Z,Is anyone ells getting lag in their audio? 
,warfare56,2011-04-26T10:53Z,"can someone give me link to the right english subtitle for this movie?
coz the one on this video dont match up with the words at all"
,greengorilla,2011-05-30T20:10Z,"quality on this is higher definition than my HD cable box. I hooked it up to my big tv and its like watching a blu-ray. no audio problems or anything either when i used VLC, but does anyone else have problems loading .mkv files on vlc in general, because it usually takes me a few attempts to open them w/o crashing vlc. after that it works perfectly.
