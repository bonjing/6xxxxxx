Sacramento's Desario play the kind of smooth, driving indie pop that always goes down easily. Their music looks back to Unrest and Teenage Fanclub and shares contemporary shelf space with Death Cab for Cutie and the California Oranges, with whom Desario share members. Mike Carr's poppy bass lines on tracks like "Houston" and "Fine Time" provide the momentum, but it's Desario's overall commitment to nothing more complicated than pure pop pleasure that cinches their appeal.
