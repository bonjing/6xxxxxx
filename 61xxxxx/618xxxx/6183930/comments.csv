Second, I seem to have some problems with the files in this torrent. I've downloaded everything, but I cannot open the files neither in VLC or WMP. I've downloaded DivX Codec Pack, but it didn't work either. I tried to move one of the files to a memory stick to try playing it in my DVD-player, but the file could not be transfered. It seems that my computer does not even recognize that the files exist. Does anyone know what might be the problem?

Thank you!"

,FnHamFreak,2012-06-15T02:32Z,Solution: Download a file manager such as 7ZFM  http://www.7-zip.org/ and rename the files taking the brackets out.
