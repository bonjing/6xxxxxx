The Savage Garden Greatest Hits CD that was originally planned for release has been delayed until a suitable tracklist can be determined thanks to a request by band members Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones. What this means is that it is unlikely that we will see this CD anytime soon even though Sony Music does have the rights to release it. For Australians there is not currently a Greatest Hits cd planned for release (unlike the rest of the world).

Savage Garden were an Australian pop rock performance and song writing duo. Darren Hayes (vocals) and Daniel Jones (keyboards, sequencing, guitar) formed the group in Brisbane, Queensland in 1994. Their international success occurred between 1997 and 2001, including number one hit singles with "Truly Madly Deeply", "I Want You", "To the Moon and Back", "The Animal Song" and "I Knew I Loved You". Their first two albums, Savage Garden and Affirmation reached number one in Australia and peaked into the top ten in both United Kingdom and United States.

The group won a record number of ten ARIA Music Awards in 1997 for their debut album and its related singles. The band took a hiatus in 2000, and while they originally intended to reform, Hayes announced its break-up in 2001.
