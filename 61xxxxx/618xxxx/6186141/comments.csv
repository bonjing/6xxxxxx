to the frontpage; this one a modified version of Lantus360's FBANext with that beautiful 4xSoft-
HD look.
Not only will you notice the high definition difference, youâ€™ll notice an improved frame rate, more
when it comes to CPS 2 and 3 emulated roms. Sheâ€™s much faster now.
Included is a patch file containing squarepusher2's changes, which can be applied against Lantusâ€™
code base; it is nothing to concern yourself with unless youâ€™re a developer. Otherwise 3 pkgs are
included for 3 different firmwares: 1) 1.92 to 3.15, 2) 3.41 and 3) 3.55."
