Thank You for all the releases after you came back. "

[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-19T22:22Z,It was the only 1080p source I could find and you're obviously exaggerating about the watermark being GIANT.It's not so bad considering the other source I thought of ripping before I found this one had a big watermark on the right corner of the screen which was even more annoying.
