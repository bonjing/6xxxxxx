      Series following a year in the life of the most southerly
      islands of the Outer Hebrides, off the north-west coast of
      Scotland. New priest Father John Paul is thrown into the
      spotlight as Christmas comes to his island parish on the
      southern tip of the Outer Hebrides, off the north-west coast of
      Scotland. Meanwhile, as Wallace the fisherman struggles to
      improve his catches of prawn, he has doubts about his future in
      the industry; and the whiskey flows as Father Roddy entertains a
      group of friends from the other side of Europe.
