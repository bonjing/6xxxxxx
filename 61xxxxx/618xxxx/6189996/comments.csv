thnx a lot man... really appreciate your H264 formats."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-21T12:41Z,"@waltz9500: Next time post the links to torrents, please. I don't have time to search. Please.

IF I have these two - I would seed, slowly, from home AFTER the daily TV.Pack is up.

So, keep torrents loaded and hope for the best (I lost my PC in August).

Also, never ever load my torrents more than week old."
