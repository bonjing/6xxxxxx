,supanut2000,2011-02-25T14:34Z,"Can I update from 1.9.5?
Coz when I installed Windows 7 on November 24th, 2010, I use 1.9.5 version to activate my OS.
Can I update to 1.9.7 without uninstalling the old version? And does the update will render my system unusable and destroy my Wubi installation?"
[T],SnowCrash05,2011-02-25T18:53Z,@supanut2000 please read the read me file inside the torrent.

,CorsairX,2011-03-06T03:41Z,Does not work as of 03-05-2011. Still get warnings about Windows not being genuine.
,viwp88,2011-03-06T23:36Z,"above comment is true, does not work atm 3-6-11 :("
,viwp88,2011-03-06T23:39Z,"@aggijay ""You can first try to uninstall what you originally installed and then try running ""sfc.exe /scannow"" from command prompt as an administrator."" 

It is in the readme under FAQs"
,viwp88,2011-03-07T00:02Z,"I think one of the problems that is causing it not to work is the fact that there are corrupt files from having a pervious version installed.

When I run the ""sfc.exe /scannow"" it says....Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.
Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.Log

When I go to check the log it tells me acess is denied. Any information on how to find the corrupt files and get rid of them? That might sloves a lot of peoples problems."

,waree,2011-07-17T21:26Z,"Hi, is it possible to upgrade my home premium seven to the ultimate using this without re installing the whole OS ? I have a lot of soft already installed and it woulb be long to do it from scratch.
Sorry if it's a noob question, never used a cracked OS until now..."
