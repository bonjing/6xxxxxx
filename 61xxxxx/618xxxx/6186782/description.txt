The ICAL TEFL Guide is a free e-book published by ICAL for newcomers to TEFL.

The e-book explains the basics of the industry and helps you get a start in a new career as an English teacher. It includes sections on:

* Qualifications
* Where to Teach
* How to Find Work
* Applying for a Job
* The Job Offer
* Moving & Culture Shock

and much more!

Sections of the book were drawn from the TEFL World wiki, but with new material and research, it now stands as an authoritative guide for new teachers and those wishing to join them.

If you have ever thought about living and working overseas as an English teacher, then this book will help you.

The TEFL industry is changing and we will be updating the guide from time to time so be sure to check back here regularly to make sure the copy you have is the latest. The current version is v1.0, April 14th 2010.
