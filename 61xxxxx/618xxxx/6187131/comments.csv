,Oifan,2011-04-19T21:57Z,"gino2561, I recommend using KLMCP (K-Lite Mega Codec Pack) v6.9.0 or newer -- it includes almost every codec anyone would need (except Adobe SWF and RealMedia and QuickTime, but those could be installed separately by installing RealAlternative and QTLite) also Media Player Classic Home Cinema 1.4.1.x -- the default key to switch to another audio track is A (Next Audio), but sometimes (when playing OGM files) you need to configure also key for ""Next Audio (OGM)""."
