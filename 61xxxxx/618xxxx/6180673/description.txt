A set of 31 PDFs of books about guns & tactics.

All PDFs are images of the pages, and the ones that end in " - ocr.pdf" also have a layer of text under the page image, though that layer of text has not been proofread.

All of these are new scans from February, 2011. None of these files has ever been posted anywhere before today.

This is almost the last of my gun books. I will be posting medical books in the near future.

I will need a week to get my (slow) seed out to the world, so please be patient. While you are waiting, check my other torrents. I have hundreds of other bun books that have already been seeded to the masses.
