,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-20T18:47Z,"That's because it a .rar, think before you comment"
,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-20T18:53Z,"That's because its a .rar file, think before you comment"
,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-20T19:01Z,"I just found out why the file is so small, I just checked my torrent and inside is a picture of borderlands and ANOTHER torrent witch is the full game, this is ligit, I had to post it this way because I uploaded the other one all by itself but accidentally deleted it and every time I tried to upload again it said that the torrent was already on the server, sorry if this is misleading."
,sergons,2011-02-20T19:08Z,184.31 KiB? Faggot!
,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-20T19:32Z,"ya, I forgot to attach the .torrent, its only a picture included, don't download this, I'm removing it, I'll repost it later"
,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-20T19:34Z,"wait, no, its there (thanks for the support ""softly"")
you'll have to forgive me, I only started posting earlier today :-)"
,fullauto,2011-02-20T22:11Z,"What i said was right YOU didnt upload the correct torrent and this WRONG , so i was right in saying you had posted something that wasn't a torrent it was in your onw words ""a picture"" so dont slag off my torrent cos you made a post that was wrong!!!."
,fullauto,2011-02-20T22:20Z,"ok so my choice of word was a bit strong , but you made the mistake NOT ME.
i thought it was another bullshit fake which are getting more common on here."
,asole,2011-02-20T23:46Z,There is a lot of documents which would help you to how to proper post a torrent. I suggest read it.
,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-21T16:23Z,"geezus, the reason I posted it like this is because when I tried posting it again (even after the other one was deleted) it kept saying that the torrent was already on the server. I'll try re-posting it & if it works I'll post a link."
,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-21T16:45Z,"Ok, I uploaded right this time (I know for sure cuz file size is 8GB) here's the link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6191569
sorry for the trouble, I might remove this link as soon as there are no more leeches, hate for them to have w8ed so long just for me to remove it... "
