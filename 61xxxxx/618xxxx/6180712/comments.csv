,biggurs,2011-11-02T22:49Z,"Can someone please be clear!!!
I have downloaded this using utorrent.
I have used imgburn to burn at 4x as stated, and 2x and 1x and 2.4x using DL  DVD+R but my sat nav just doesnt read.  
My 530d E60 had software update in2006 and so this should work.
Ihave tried using ultraISO and various other software but DVD is unreadable.
I have followed the exact instructions but no luck.
DO I HAVE TO CONVERT THIS FILE TO SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE I USE IMGBURN or do I just use imgburn on its own?
I have used imgburn on its own and it doesnt work! 
Im pretty good at following instructions so believe me when I say I have followed the exact instructions and more! tried various speeds, various software but no good!
