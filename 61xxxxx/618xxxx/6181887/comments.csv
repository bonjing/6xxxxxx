It contains some improvements including the ability to reverse edit Chemdraw graphics pasted in Word documents (need ChemDraw 12.0.2 update, though)"
[T],nobody2007,2011-02-19T06:17Z,This is freeware
,bjuice100,2011-02-19T08:08Z,It is freeware. The only important information here is that it SAFELY updates the existing torrent version. Maybe tomorrow the freeware version won't do that.(;-))
,dinodig,2011-02-26T15:16Z,"Thanks alot bjuice but can get a safe 14.0.2 Udate too? Thanks!
-Or is it safe to just update my office?"
,bjuice100,2011-02-26T16:34Z,"Yes dinodig it appears that 14.0.2 is also safe to apply to the available ""Microsoft Office 2011 14.0.0 Final for Mac (Volume Licensed)"". I have updated mine on both my iMac and MacBook Pro. Maybe I should upload an updated torrent, as well. Thanks!"
