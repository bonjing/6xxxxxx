,Pole_Star,2011-02-19T03:58Z,"Thanks. Works perfectly fine. :)

Here's the direct official link to the setup:
http://telltale.vo.llnwd.net/o15/games/bttf/102/bttf_102_setup.exe

Just join both the parts..

There again, it's fully legal file cause you cannot play it without a serial or a crack..."
,Necessity,2011-02-20T00:05Z,There was another torrent called Back.to.the.Future.The.Game.Episode.2.Get.Tannen.RIP-Unleashed by user raafaell on the pirate bay. I downloaded and installed it. A few hours later I found trojans and a rootkit on my computer. I suspect that torrent was behind it. When i look for it now it's no longer on the pirate bay. Are my suspicions correct and did it contain malware? 
,Rovlad84,2011-02-20T07:20Z,Many internets to the uploader!
,Rovlad84,2011-02-20T07:24Z,"@Necessity: It was a fake torrent. Get this one. 
Next time make sure you check comments, quality meter at the top of the page (currently +10) and if it's a trusted uploader (pink skull icon)."
,mynameisexysam,2011-02-20T10:59Z,thaNKS i have BEEN wAITIN for this !!!!
,cjrazzle,2011-02-20T13:03Z,I have a feeling a lot of folks are gonna have trouble finding the crack folder! ;)
,cjrazzle,2011-02-20T13:12Z,"Installation is froze at around 90-95%! Arggghhh!!! 

Anyone else have this problem?"
,Pole_Star,2011-02-20T15:51Z,"Looks like 	Back.to.the.Future.The.Game.Episode.2.Get.Tannen.RIP-Unleashed is a 0Day release which isn't nuked yet (as per my knowledge). But if there's any malware in that release, it should be nuked soon.

Rest assured, this torrent is perfectly fine and clean.

Didn't have any problems with the setup."
,KasperskyKasa,2011-02-22T17:01Z,finished game in 3 hours. no problems. great torrent and superb game by telltale
,izombie222,2011-02-25T02:21Z,Downloaded the game and it's asking me for a user name and password to play. what did i do wrong?
,nroll,2011-02-27T20:55Z,"The game menu works normally but when the game itself begins, there's no image, only the audio. Is it only happening to me?"
,cartman19987,2011-02-27T23:52Z,"Thanks so much for this! I loved the first episode, and I'll surely feel the same way for this one!"
,cartman19987,2011-02-28T20:56Z,"Thanks again. The game works perfectly! But one problem for me; it got laggy when you first run into Biff, but that problem soon corrects itself."
,seedplease2010,2011-03-01T14:24Z,Is there one for mac?
,Chadly,2011-03-10T01:45Z,"Very sad day for me :( Downloaded and uploaded everything fine, game works but I get no picture, anyone else having that problem? I hear Doc and Marty talking about a newspaper but cant see them :( anyone know why? Brand new comp, you would think the game  would work on it. The first episode did with no problems. Much appreciated to anyone who knows how to fix this..."
,Chadly,2011-03-12T17:22Z,"I will deem who ever can get a working copy of this game on here a GOD ;) Ive only been able to find this same file on all the torrent sites I know, and all of them have comments about hearing Marty and Doc but not being able to see any animation. So def looks like its not my comp and something is wrong with this file.. PLEASE SOMEONE PUT UP A DIFFERENT ONE.. Thanks :)"
,BryanSweet,2011-03-19T07:22Z,Thanks :)
,lokostilll,2011-03-23T15:47Z,@Chadly   Try turning down the graphic detail settings.  Mines works on setting 2 because I don't have a graphic card. Anything higher than that and I get a black screen.
,GameRiot,2011-04-07T23:14Z,Anyone! Please seed for me! I've had this since Feb. No one has seeded for a month! I'm at 96.9% for about a month! Someone Seed again please!
