,omtd88,2011-02-25T12:47Z,Great Upload thanks..man .....keep it up..
,zambir,2011-02-27T19:18Z,"Worked fine for me.
Had a previous Office 2010 x86 release by thethingy, which unexpectedly expired today. I guess that happened because I applied the Windows 7 x64 SP1 last week.
Used the Activator as follows:
Install new key --> Rearm  --> Activate

Good job!"
,AnonGuyz,2011-03-01T06:02Z,"Hey Thanks man You saved me alot of time and stress for this activation.
GREAT JOB!!!!!"
,iwinulose,2011-03-02T05:16Z,"this is a virus, not recomended to download, hacktool keygen, high risk, dont do it, have a nice day everyone."
[V],thethingy,2011-03-02T10:39Z,"iwinulose, hack tool and keygen?, no shit Sherlock, wtf do you think an activator is? "
,blake8705,2011-03-03T05:16Z,"I get the same error for every Office 2010 install... ""An error occured during installation."" Then i have to quit, any idea? I've tried running in compatability mode, as admin, I'm on Windows 7 32-bit."
[V],thethingy,2011-03-03T09:12Z,"blake8705, just try one of the other activators linked in the office torrent"
,chrizhaynes,2011-03-03T23:01Z,"it has got a trojan like the other guy said,
it activated fine two weeks ago and did a full computer scan today and found it,

"""";""C:\Users\chrizhaynes\Downloads\bit comet downloads\WOAT_v3.2\WOAT_v3.2.exe:\KMS\KMS.exe"";""Trojan horse BackDoor.Hackdoor.R"";""Moved to Virus Vault""

hopefully my computer did'nt get hacked as the name suggests it opens up your computer to get remotely hacked and adds a keylogger to steals passwords ect. "

[V],thethingy,2011-03-04T01:10Z,"chrizhaynes, why the fuck do people come looking for crack's & keygens then complain that there antivirus tells them its a crack & keygen? seriously geaza just piss off, like the 300 seeders are all wrong and this is a virus, is that what you are saying?, go learn some about heuristic detection before you come back here. "
,privacyplease12345,2011-03-04T04:21Z,Worked for me.  Office still gives a need to activate message when opening but it loads and works just fine.  Thanks for the hard work and sharing.
,chrizhaynes,2011-03-04T21:57Z,"since when has a trojan and a keygen/crack been the same?
hackdoor trojan?
av said trojan not keygen.
go look up Trojan horse BackDoor.Hackdoor.R
the activator is fine its the extra trojan with it thats the problem......"
[V],thethingy,2011-03-05T00:04Z,"chrizhaynes, there is no trojan you fool, your av is using heuristics to guess what the kms.exe is, the kms.exe is a ligament office/windows kms keygen that's all, kms.exe is used in almost all office activators and almost all windows/server activators that require a kms activation.

Before telling me to go look up ""Trojan horse BackDoor.Hackdoor.R"" why don't you?, you will then find that its a generic warning for a possible infection, this is clean tested and the source code for it is googlable by anyone with half a brain, the activator comes from a credible and trustworthy source who, if you took the trouble to look, publishes the md5 values for the activator and this torrent has identical md5 so nothing has been added.

Best thing you can do is go to ms and buy office since you are such a paranoid person. I suggest you click on the vt link then you will note that different av's call it different things because they are all guessing what it may be. 

Anyway dude I don't need to justify my postings to you as my torrents speak for themselves. "
,chrizhaynes,2011-03-06T13:34Z,"ok i got told :(
sorry mate i've got loads of respect for what you do and i've had some good stuff from you,
its just the first time my av has found anything from all the torrents i've used.
but now you've told my why and now i know a little more so thanks :) & sorry.."
,foxmajik,2011-03-07T10:06Z,kmservice.exe is a customizable trojan dropper.  That's why there are so many torrents with the same executable filename..
[V],thethingy,2011-03-07T16:08Z,"foxmajik, get lost asshole KMS = Key Management Server ,KMS is the device that activates office. there are so many torrents with kms because its the same kms.exe that is used in most Windows/Office kms activators.  "

,LifeNFastLane,2011-03-26T15:30Z,Does this activate SP1 for Windows 7? I just want to make sure I have an activator prior to upgrading! Thanks TheThingy!!

,Gambit216,2011-04-17T12:17Z,"I'm trying to run this for Project Professional X86 but every time I do it says
'The system cannot find the file path specified'
It then gives me a product key and says that it has successfully installed it yet nothing has happened.

Does the activator have to be in a certain location?
Any help would be grand.
"
,lbomber7,2011-04-19T21:06Z,"First of all. Thank you @thethingy. Amazing work.
But can someone help? I used this tool with my Windows 7 CD and with Office 10 on that computer (Windows 7 64-bit), but when I try to use it on my x86 XP Pro desktop the application opens for less than a second and shuts down. Is it just because it does not work with XP? If so is there one that does?
Please and thank you!"
,nut4golf,2011-04-21T17:03Z,"With update of Windows Ultimate to SP1, I am now searching for good tool to get rid of the restored WGA notices and get my system activated once again.

Unfortunately, WOAT 3.2 doesn't appear to work with SP1 and I get PROCESS STATUS: [ERROR] for all activation attempts. 

Anyone know where to find a SP1 compatible activator?"
,innocentgee,2011-04-24T00:08Z,ReaLLy! is it still working like a charm?
,Maggy2040,2011-05-09T05:09Z,Thank you! Works pretty well. Had to disable AV/Firewall to get the Office activation working.

,liddellpower,2011-10-22T19:17Z,"Trojan, according to northon"
,Zlatanovski,2011-11-30T20:28Z,"@thetgingy 
please help.
I have Win 7 Proffesional 32-bit, which is already activated with serial number and I have activated Office 2010 from activated with something called conversion kit 1.6 . Question is:
If i want to use this do I have to ""deactivate"" my Windows and office, if yes, how? Or I can just install this ""over"" them.
Thanks in advance"
,Zlatanovski,2011-11-30T20:30Z,"And one more question.
Are updates a problem, I mean on SP1 update.

Have you tried updating on SP1"
,skudtz,2012-01-13T04:30Z,NOD32 picked this up after download - WOAT_v3.2.rar »RAR »WOAT_v3.2.exe »RAR »KMS\KMS.exe - a variant of Win32/HackKMS.A application
,idayv,2012-01-17T15:49Z,"@kudtz that's fine. All antivirus classify activators as viruses because they mess with the internal state of windows. If you double check the ""virus name"" (Win32/HackKMS.A application) you can infer that is a KMS hack (Key Manager Service hack)... which is *exactly* what the activator needs to hack to make the installation geniune."
,molly_dog,2012-03-13T02:58Z,"Hope someone reads this. I NEEDED an activation method that did not require me to phone in for activation. (Let's just say I went back to the buffet-Office 2010 Pro Plus Activation-1 too many times and MS got a little too curious about me!)

This is not a problem with thethingy's uploads, just stupidity on my part! :-

WOAT DEFINITELY was the perfect solution for me! It activated Office without even one hitch!

If you're having trouble getting Office14/2010 Standard or Pro +, try this tool! Just READ CAREFULLY & FOLLOW THE PROMPTS!!!!!

If you can't do that simple task then you should not be d/l'ing from this site in the first place!

There are NO viruses in this download. MSoft's Security Essentials and other AV might see it as a hack tool but, trust me, it is NOT!

Great job, uploader! You're my best friend as of this moment!!!
