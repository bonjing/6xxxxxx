 Outstanding blues/rock heavy guitar power trio from Indonesia featuring the amazing GUGUN on guitar/vox. Includes 14 tracks of mega-awesome, retro-70's, blues-based, Hendrix-inspired, killer power trio riffage that kicks serious heavy guitar ass. Highly recommended to fans of JIMI HENDRIX, SRV, INDIGENOUS, ROBIN TROWER & TOMMY BOLIN.
The Gugun Power Trio's premier release, "Far East Blues Experience," rocks from start to finish. It's a CD that virtually defines heavy, groove-laiden blues-rock, with its focus squarely on blues guitar virtuosity. The CD is comprised of all original material, but the band does not neglect their prestigious predecessors -- one can hear obvious influences from Robin Trower, Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Although long famous in Indonesia, their time has finally come: Sounds like this, blending Far East sensibility with good old fashioned blues guitar nectar, deserve to be heard worldwide. What we have here is a dynamic, virtuosic wall of sound, replete with a refined sense of melody, sophisticated chordal arrangements, and kick-em-in-the-face rock-n-roll.
