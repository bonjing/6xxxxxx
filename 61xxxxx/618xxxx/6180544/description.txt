ENCODER INFO:
One of the best teen comedy I have seen. Old but gold.

On the piratebay you can find only a low quality VHS rip.
So finally manage to find an obscure dvdrip on a private russian tracker. I have reencoded the movie to a non-anamorphic format and let only the english sound.

English & Romanian subtitles included.
Enjoy.
