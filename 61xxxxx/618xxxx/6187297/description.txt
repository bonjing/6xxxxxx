      Favourite comedy characters, sketches, animations and
      diversions, hand-picked from Limmy's first series and pilot
      episode. Sketches include - adventure phone in host Falconhoof,
      zoned-out waster Dee Dee, urban menace John Paul, silver haired
      businessman Mr Mulvaney, primary school power broker Wee Gary
      and hard-bitten ex-junkie Jacqueline McCafferty. Plus Limmy gets
      off the swings and wants advice on how to get to Millport.
