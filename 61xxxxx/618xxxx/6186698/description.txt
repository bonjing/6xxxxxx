BRUCE DICKINSON - "Collection" (The Secret Anthology 3-CD)



Description:

"Paul Bruce Dickinson" (born 7 August 1958) is an English singer, airline pilot, fencer, broadcaster, author,
director, musician, screenwriter, actor, marketing director, entrepreneur and songwriter best known as the vocalist
of the heavy metal group Iron Maiden.

Dickinson performed for some local bands including Styx (not the American band of the same name) in 1976, Speed,
(1977â€“1978), and Shots in early 1979. He then joined the band Samson later in 1979, where he gained some popularity.
In this band he went by the name of "Bruce Bruce." He left Samson in 1981, citing musical differences.
Shortly afterwards, in 1981, Dickinson was hired as Iron Maiden's new vocalist, replacing Paul Di'Anno,
and debuting for that band with the 1982 album The Number of the Beast. During his time in that band,
they issued a series of high impact releases, resulting in Dickinson gaining worldwide fame,
and becoming one of the most acclaimed heavy metal vocalists of all time.

Dickinson quit Iron Maiden in 1993 in order to pursue his solo career, being replaced by Blaze Bayley.
Dickinson's solo work ranged across a wide variety of heavy metal and rock styles.
Dickinson rejoined Maiden in 1999 along with guitarist Adrian Smith. Since then, Dickinson has only released
one more solo album, Tyranny of Souls. He is the older cousin of Rob Dickinson, lead singer of British
alternative rock band Catherine Wheel. His son Austin Dickinson is the lead singer in metalcore band Rise to Remain.
