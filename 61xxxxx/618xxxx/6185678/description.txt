Show Summary: A comedy series. "Portlandia" on IFC features Fred Armisen, Carrie Brownstein and guest stars satirizing such alternative-culture types as the owners of a feminist book store, a bike messenger, a punk-rock couple, and an arty duo 
obsessed with putting little cut-outs of birds on anything they lay their hands on. Each half-hour episode will consist of interwoven short films, with some characters recurring from week-to-week. Each episode's character-based shorts draw viewers into "Portlandia", the creators' dreamy and absurd rendering of Portland, Oregon.
