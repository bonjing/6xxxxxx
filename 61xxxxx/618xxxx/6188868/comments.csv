Thanks for the encode/upload.

Ansolutely amazing and I know you worked really hard to get it but I still find the 500MB/720p just excellent! Thank you.

Cheers

,justregged,2011-02-20T20:47Z,"What happened to pleasantville? Im still downloading have 42% with ratio 1.203 , will i still get done as its looking a little hairy? I hope the guy from belgium doesnt fuck off lol"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-20T21:14Z,"@justregged: First of all, sorry. Upload was very corrupted. I would do re-up and as precaution, I would suggest you to delete that partial download. Even one upload after Pleasantville was corrupted, but I have seen what has happened and was able to resume at 72.4% of that second upload. Server is 4000 miles away and I have no clue why he acts so weird. Hopes for the best. 
When you see new torrent up, I have succeeded. Sorry again."
