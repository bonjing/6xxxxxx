Snagit 10


The ultimate do-it-yourself screen capture tool is better than ever. Snagit 10 provides a smarter and more efficient way to grab your images, with updated capture profiles and effects to improve how you capture, edit, share and organize your content.

Top 3 features in Snagit 10

All-in-One Capture-Snag anything, on the fly. Use the newest capture profile to grab your entire desktop, a region, a window, or a scrolling windowâ€”all with a single hotkey or click.

Updated Transparency-Now you can keep the rounded corners from a captured windowâ€¦ or create a custom shapeâ€¦ and the only background youâ€™ll see is the one on your website, document, or slide.

Upload to Screencast.com-Itâ€™s easier than ever to send your captures out for review with built-in, online hosting from Screencast.com. Now you can share your images with an embed code or give them a URL with a clickable thumbnail. Store, share and gather feedback on all of your visual projects.


Smarter capture options

Improved Auto-Scroll

Snagitâ€™s auto-scroll feature has drastically improved and can now sense when youâ€™re on a web page that scrolls. Snagit will automatically move through the pageâ€¦ capturing it both vertically and horizontallyâ€¦ at your command. Just point and click.


Updated Magnifier

Like a microscope for your computer screenâ€¦ use magnified cross hairs to get exact, down-to-the-pixel precision on every capture.
Formatted Text Capture

Perfect for reviewing text and making changesâ€”grab the text straight off a web page and keep the formattingâ€”then edit and apply different font styles, sizes and colors.

New possibilities

Cut-Out Effect

Stylishly delete unwanted pieces of an image by removing vertical and horizontal sections. Add a background image to fill the gap, or make it transparent.

Page Curl Effect

Make your image look as if one of the corners is folded over for an eye-grabbing effect. Pick from one of the preset page curl options, or create your own.
