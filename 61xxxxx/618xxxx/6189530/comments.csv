[T],protoyu,2011-02-25T14:33Z,"Chris-Aksel create a size which at least fits into a DVD 5 ,I had to make it small and re encode it and converting HD videos has always been a nightmare for me.If u dnt know learn from RiddlerA or 300mbteam."
[T],protoyu,2011-02-25T14:33Z,Anyways good quality THANKS!
,rlnplehshalo,2011-02-26T11:05Z,"Downloading now:) Thanks for the upload mate.
Please seed! I'm getting only a few kb/s"
,privatco,2011-02-26T13:58Z,"Video: 10
But the Audio is very bad so I will delete it sorry I can't give more than 1 star no more.
Thank you very much for everything."
,canopener,2011-02-26T17:17Z,"This is fine for watching on a computer but the decision to use:
1. 25fps
2. Audio sampling rate of 44.1 KHz

makes this un-playable & un-listenable on dlna (dma) supported samsung tv's. On TivX the audio doesn't work either.

Otherwise, it's pretty good watching on a small laptop by yourself."
,brea2010,2011-02-26T17:39Z,"Good Job but a Pathetic Movie. Jason Statham is yet to shake off CRANK from his life.

[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-02-27T19:25Z,"the movie looks fine to me and sound too . Yes it is 720p quality , the only bad thing that it is oversized this dont fit to dvd.."
,Krixs,2011-02-27T23:10Z,"Are people actually giving this movie a 9 on audio? I'd give it a 4 - tops. Sound is distorted and blurry, but video looks nice."

,Franzipoo,2011-03-05T11:12Z,Crap quality..nothing hi rez about any of this.
,nil7,2011-03-13T10:53Z,"As others has commented: Bad audio! 

I guess the one who say ""good audio"" has only heard the sample, which sounds ok as it has only talking (i.e. 'soft' sounds). If they *have* heard  the move, then I would recommend they find at least some *decent* crappy speakers ;-)

Try listening to the swimming scene in the beginning: The water noise sound like crap! The compression can also be heard any 'sharp' noise, footsteps, music etc."

,Cartman372,2011-04-10T18:41Z,"I don't know how you morons are giving this copy such high ratings for audio and video.

Video wise it's a 5 at best
Audio wise it's a 0.

The audio in this copy is HORRIBLE. 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

(I've tried this on my desktop with a decent pair of Creative 2.1 speakers and on my 5.1 surround sound. It's just a horrible copy.)"
,Greenhof,2011-04-14T17:16Z,"The sound is HORRIBLE
Sorry but this is unwatchable, audio -2"
