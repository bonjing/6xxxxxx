Ok so I have been looking for something exactly like this on every site and had to order this from the UK. Iso created using power ISO. I verified this and it is perfect. Hope you guys make good use out of this. I'll try to seed this for a week or so. I also have the Adv. Disc 2 and I will seed it after enough seeders take this one from me. Cheers everyone and soon enough I'll try and put together all of my JAVA tutorial resources in one torrent file.
