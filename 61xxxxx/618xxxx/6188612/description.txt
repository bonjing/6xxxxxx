Encoders Notes
I dropped the source into vdubmod.
I lowered the brightness, increased the contrast,
lightly de-noised & sharpened it.
Then i changed the colors with a rgb eq.
Finaly i re-sized it & muxed it to imagines line audio.
Its a very good TS, deffinatley worth watching.
There are quite a few parts where the audio isnt in english, 
but there arent any hardcoded russian subtitles.
So if you go to the cinema & watch it i doubt there will be any english sub's.
Its a little dark in a few places but you can see everything thats going on.
Here is a screenshot comparison beetween mine & imagines encode's.

Check the sample to make sure your happy with the quality.
Enjoy...
