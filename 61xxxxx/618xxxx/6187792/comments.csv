,MRFUNNYHAHA,2011-03-06T12:37Z,"^ quiet you fucking turd. 

now somebody tell me, is there a workaround to apply this release to mapsource?"
,no.way,2011-03-07T06:11Z,"The gmapbmap.img file in this torrent is version ""Worldwide Autoroute DEM Basemap,NR 5.00"".

I am not sure what the gmapsupp.img file is = I think it is probably something like ""US Topo 20__"" or ""City Navigator Europe NT 2009"".

And the gmaptz.img file is a time zone map, but I don't know what version - it doesn't matter as time zone maps are a free update using the Garmin WebUpdater software...

To update my nuvi 750 and 765t I used the ""gmapbmap.img"" file from this torrent to update my basemap, and I used the ""gmapprom.img"" file from the ""Garmin City Navigator North America NT 2011.30 Unlocked"" torrent here:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5974610/Garmin_City_Navigator_North_America_NT_2011.30_Unlocked

,goose1363,2011-03-09T00:16Z,can someone tell me how to put this onto my garmin do i need to burn the files to a cd first
,rayad,2011-03-26T23:32Z,Hi can someone please explain step by step how to install this map on the garmin nuvi? all help is highly appreciated. :)
,SerSpec-V,2011-03-27T03:17Z,Wouldn't you just do the same thing as the other maps on PB and just rename gmapsupp to gmapprom and drag & drop & replace in the Garmin? Gmapsupp is for a supplemental map that you would put on a SD card. 
,SerSpec-V,2011-03-27T04:06Z,"I did update the base map to NR 5.00 since I had 2.00 in my 255W and I already have the 2011.30 map so I have done the same as ""no.way""."
,SerSpec-V,2011-03-31T06:35Z,2011.40 seems to be working fine. Thanks.
[T],grimreaper420,2011-04-07T17:00Z,"just my 2 cents ..might help some people here...
This is very simple, even for complete noobs...all you need is some basic file management skills and you're off to updating your Garmin unit in just under a hour.

Just download torrent, and observe the 3 image files 

gmapbmap.img 48.6 MB
gmapsupp.img 1.32 GB
gmapt.img 592 B

Go to your computer and plug in your USB cable from the Garmin unit, it will find the necessary  drivers (and plug-ins if requested by your browser) on your desktop it will show your Garmin unit as a removable storage...click on the Garmin folder, you will see an image about 1.1-1.3GB in size. 

That would be your older Garmin maps- delete it (make a backup if you wish to your desktop in case you mess up).

Find the gmapsupp.img 1.32 GB file, and copy this file to the Garmin unit, it may take up to 1 hour to complete the file transfer, depends on your computer's hardware setup, and performance. ***(Remember to change the gmapsupp.img to gmapprom.img) by right clicking on file, and renaming***

Once this is done, go to your computer's program and start up Garmin's WebUpdater, this will update the firmware, additional language(s), and other stuff whatever you wish.
Do not remove the USB cable while the update is in progress, you will make the unit inoperable, basically it's a lemon, so don't say I didn't tell you so.

Hope this helps someone out there, and in case there is another update, I'm sure my steps are to be followed again...very simple people...good luck and enjoy:)

It works on Windows 7 x32bit/x64bit:)"
,tgkid88,2011-04-22T17:05Z,Works for me....thankx
,Stormgren32,2011-04-24T20:45Z,"People asking if this can be used with Map Source.  It can be attempted using a few tools.  Look here:

,sashrafi,2011-04-29T07:17Z,Thanks for the torrent. I have an old C330. and it worked for me. I am using SD card with 2010 version. I just took it out stick it into my card reader and replaced the gmapsupp.img file with the new one from this torrent and it worked. No long tidous process just took 5 minuts
,locdu,2011-05-02T13:02Z,Work so well on Garmin 3790LTM.
,Ekac,2011-05-03T07:44Z,"@ grimreaper420

What about the other two (2) remaining files:
- gmapbmap
- gmaptz

What should we do with them?


Thanks..."
,jeptik,2011-05-04T16:47Z,"I had the voice calling out the street names before I installed this version, but now that I have this loaded, it doesn't do it anymore.

Any thoughts on this?

Thanks."
,quaggg,2011-05-06T23:50Z,"Works well in Canada by following grimreaper420 instructions.

No problem for voice or anything.

Nice one.."
,waugusta,2011-05-21T00:44Z,"Thanks for the torrent. I have a 1450T. and it worked for me. I replaced my gmapbmap.img, gmaptz.img and with the new ones from this torrent. I also replaced the gmapsupp.img file (renaming it to gmapprom.img) they all worked. 

Would love to see you do the same for City Navivigator North America NT 2012.10.

Thanks"

,tickturd,2011-06-03T12:27Z,"Worked for me on a roadside find c330. I added all 3 files to a 2 gb sd card inside a folder labeled ""Garmin"" and it works fine. Thank-you!"
,MEGui,2011-06-03T16:25Z,I cant get it to work on Zumo 660. 
,Tweek63,2011-06-13T08:19Z,"I have a garmin 60csx that uses micro sd cards.
If I transfer these 3 files to a blank card then put it in the unit ,will it work? or is there something else I would have to do."
,Junglist28,2011-06-16T21:21Z,Will this work on the Garmin Nuvi 1350T? I reallly appreciate your response in advance. Thanks

,kitchn,2011-11-23T16:50Z,Worked like a charm. Thanks.
