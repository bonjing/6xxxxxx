Product Description
This comprehensive treatment of the continuous-time control systems provides a gradual development of control theory - and shows how to solve all computational problems with MATLAB. It avoids highly mathematical arguments, and features an abundance of examples and worked problems throughout. This edition reorganizes content to cover all basic materials of control systems in the first ten chapters, leaving advanced topics to the last. It provides detailed explanations on how to write MATLAB programs to solve a variety of problems in control engineering, expands coverage of the design aspects of control engineering with many new design problems; adds an introduction to robust control; and includes many new computational problems - all solved with MATLAB.
