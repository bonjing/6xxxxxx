The montage of this video needed a suit of special 3D shooting techniques; that included a lot of work, the main purpose of the whole action being the delight of the 3D enthusiast, and not only...

This song it is about a fragile flower freighted of the imminent winter coming. She entreat the winter to stay away of her gentleness.
