[T],MelloYello,2011-02-20T07:05Z,Hey Vinnie why are you talking shit?  You already saw in the theater why are you trying to download a non-dvd copy and watch it again?  Got a crush on Kutcher I guess.  Spag

,almond94,2011-03-01T19:00Z,"Hi, I hope you guys appreciate my comment. I just watched this film and it is watchable but quality wise, its not that good.

A-5 (at the end of the movie, when the actor speaks, it doesn't really match up with the voice, wrong timing)
V-6 (because it is pretty blur)"
,jdobby76,2011-03-07T20:37Z,"Not the best quality, ok for cam V/6+, A/6 at times but a 5 for the whole movie. Very funny. very watchable cam must have zoomed in to much some of the screen is cut off."
,Erx31,2011-03-08T15:27Z,"this totla shit worst quality i ever seen even cam view is better!!! >.<

p.s. but movie is damn good..."
