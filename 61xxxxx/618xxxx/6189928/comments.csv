now regarding the audiobook. READ THIS:
it is bad.
trust me, ive listen to tens of self help/improvement audiobooks and this one is not anywhere near the quality of those. You dont get any useful information from this, and she actually adresses the women more than she adresses the men. arent this book for us men to learn about women?? apparently not.
and it doesnt end there, she even goes so far that she blames almost everything on us men without giving an explanation why it is our fault? she talks about situations and feelings that womens have and then often say stuff like ""i know you women out there will recognize this"". and then she basically implies that this can be done better if it werent for us men being so egoistic and narcistic as we are. and that women on the other hand, put us as their number one priority and thats why they are nagging or doing all those behaviours that they are doing to us that we supposedly dont like (like calling us every day we are away from them, i wish my girlfriend did that!). so instead of analyzing, reflecting and giving us help to how to figure this out, she just keeps saying we are to blame. and the way to sort this out is to be more sensitive. that we should put our women first. DUUUUUUH. omfg... tell me something i dont already know??

and it just gets worse and worse. she then lists a bunch of bad stuff that we men do, that the women doesnt like. and about 90% of these stuff just doesnt happen in todays modern intimate relationships!!! it is so outdated. i NEVER boss my gf around (i tell her to do stuff, but if she doesnt want to, she tells me to do it myself, and i rock scissors paper her for it for instance) and i know you guys probably dont either. especially if you guys actually came here looking to better yourself, you are already have the characteristic of not being a turd to your gf. another thing that pissed me off was when she said that we men likes to LIE about stuff to our gf because it is easier than telling the truth!? SERIOUSLY??? only men do this?? the girls never do this?? WTF??? she has a PhD????

and last i have to mention again, because it is of utmost importance: she doesnt back up any of her findings with any resource material (SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, other books, philosophers etc). she just states the what she believes is fact based upon her ""experience"" in counseling or whatever. it could work (because it does in other books), but she DOESNT SAY WHY IT IS LIKE THAT! WHY DO WE MEN LIKE TO BOSS OUR WOMEN AROUND?? (and we dont, maybe thats why she doesnt say why, she just says we do).

so please for the love of humanity, dont listen to this audiobook. what you can do is go to amazon and give it a 1-star rating or something. i know i will.

here's a section in the audiobook that made me go red: (its not 100% quotation, but pretty accurate)
""you can picture it like a pie. if you cut a tiny slice out of that pie. just a tiny bit. something like one tenth of a piece... now for men, that small piece represents the love for your women. [giggles] and the rest of the pie is representing other things in the mans life(...)
now lets for the woman. it is the opposite! for a women, she prioritizes the love for her man! and thats why she does all these things that make you men go crazy (...)
everytime i do this pie lecture in my seminars, the whole room fills up with laughter. both the men and the women will laugh! They do this, because they know it is the truth!"" WOW WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP. WOW SERIOUSLY. "
