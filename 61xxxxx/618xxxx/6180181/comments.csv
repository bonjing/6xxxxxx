Hey guys, can anyone provide me the Hindi Track of 'The Dark Knight'. I have already downloaded Batman Begin Dual Audio to have its Hindi track and mux it with Prashant's encode. But I cant do it anymore. It take long time to download dual rip due to less seeders and I have my limitations.
My this request is specially to apple016, mzk56, and prank.
I would really appreciate the efforts if someone could help me out.
Here is my email:-
------------the.dauntless.me@gmail.com ----------"
,apple016,2011-02-19T18:40Z,yes i can provide audio track of dark knight dnt worry.

let me knw when u done"
,apple016,2011-02-19T19:34Z,"extra info
i DLed this audio(well whole movie) from depp1990.
and ripped by myself original file was abt 189 mb and its only 32 mb with better sample rate.good luck with ur muxing ok buddy"
,i_am_sid,2011-02-20T10:01Z,"@apple
Thanks a million mate. 
Ill download it tomorrow morning. Will reply when its done."
,i_am_sid,2011-02-21T07:29Z,"@apple
Ok. I've downloaded it. Thanks a lot.
Do you think, converting the audio from lossy to lossy format degrade its quality (like one you did and one im gonna do)? 
Now, i think i have to reconvert it to suitable format again.
Whats your opinion?"
,apple016,2011-02-21T17:57Z,"@i_am_sid
no no, dnt do any thing with that file. i mean already have encoded that audio.there is no need to encode again.its useless.it'll decrease the quality of audio.it'll become creepy.
so my opinion is dnt do any thing.what is ur video  format.? mkv? use ""mkvmerg"" its very handy too for merging files. and there is no need to convert audio file in any other format.you can merge it with any video file.
tell me if you need any thing.
phew very long comment (dammn you my fingers  @_@)"
,apple016,2011-02-21T18:03Z,"errr..
too=tool"
,godofwrath08,2011-02-22T08:42Z,great movie but b4 eny1 does plz remember this is nowere near 720p bluray quality its not a bluray so plz dnt flame guys. check online for officail bitrates but still great quality for the size pal
[V],prashant22,2011-02-22T09:09Z,"@godofwrath08
carry on looooser...i'll still get downloaders :P"
,i_am_sid,2011-02-26T15:39Z,"@apple
The container of the movie is mp4 (Prashant's encode). I didnt convert it. I used Yamb for muxing. But after muxing i saw the property of the file. And it shows the audio file as AAC. It converted during muxing process. 
Well i think the format of the audio should be AAC to mux it with MP4 container.
Watcha think."
[V],prashant22,2011-02-26T16:05Z,"@sid
ya right...bt i think now ac3 can also be used with mp4..m nt sure as i hv nt tried it..bt came to know abt it from forums.."
