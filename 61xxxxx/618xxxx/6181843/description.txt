Anthony Firingee (Bangla:à¦…à§à¦¯à¦¾à¦£à§à¦Ÿà§‹à¦¨à¦¿ à¦«à¦¿à¦°à¦¿à¦‚à¦—à§€; AntÅnÄ« PhiringÄ«) (?-1836) was a Bengali Language poet of Portuguese origin known for his works in Bengali devotional songs in the early part of the 19th century. Born Hensman Anthony, the sobriquet Firingee (The foreigner) was used colloquially in deference to his Portuguese origins. Although not much is known of his early life, Anthony arrived in Bengal sometime in early 19th century and subsequently came to settle in Farashdanga, in the town of Chandernagore in Western Bengal. He married a Hindu widow and was deeply influenced by Bengali culture and language, as well as the Hindu religion. Eventually, Anthony came to learn the language and composed a number of noted religious songs in devotion to the Goddesses Kali and Durga. He is noted for his Agamani Songs, celebrating the return of Goddess Durga to her parents home that marks the Bengali Autumn festival of Durga Puja. Anthony is also noted for his literary face-offs in KaviganS, or Bard's duels, with a number of noted Bengali composers including Bhola Moira, Ram Basu and Thakur Singh. Anthony also helped construct a temple to Goddess Kali in the Bowbazar locality of North Calcutta that today is famous as The Firingee Kalibari (The Foreigner's Kali Temple). A 1967 Bengali film by Director Sunil Bannerjee celebrated the life and works of Anthony, and had noted Bengali actor Uttam Kumar in the title role. The film was noted for its music, composed by another noted famous Bengali Musician Manna Dey, and earned Uttam Kumar an Indian National Film Award for Best Actor in 1968.
