,BraveB,2011-10-17T21:47Z,"(Samsung Galaxy S; i9000; Cyanogenmod)
I've put the folder onto my phone's memory. Put the APK on my external sdcard and ran it to install iGo. Went through the setup process and typed in a route. Display showed ""Looking for GPS signal"". Waited... waited... Looked on the internet for a solution... When suddenly (after more than 5 minutes I think) it started to plan/guide the route.

Then I ended iGo and switched off GPS. Waited a while and enabled GPS and started iGo. Timed the startup process to a nearly rounded 5 minutes!

I might try a gps fix sometime..."
