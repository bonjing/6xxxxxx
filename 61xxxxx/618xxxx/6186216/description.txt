No blues is a unique project which explores the connection between two musical worlds: americana and Arabic music.

For this project by Productiehuis Oost-Nederland (ON), Ad van Meurs (guitar), Haytham Safia (Ud, Arabic lute) and Anne-Maarten van Heuvelen (double bass) were invited; their assignment was to investigate a possible combination of folkblues and traditional Arabic music in a three-day session.
