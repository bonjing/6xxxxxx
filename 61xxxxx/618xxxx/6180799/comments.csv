I had the same problem mate. Would burn to disc fine but then the game would freeze when Loading. I also upgraded to the new dash.

Before burning I used the free software called ABGX. All you have to do is open the programme and then put the Bulletstorm iso into the programme and click launch. When it is finished you will have a dvd. file. Then burn this with ImgBurn and hey presto, should work fine.

No, this not work anymore. I have done that and even more but these new games won't work anymore by turning them Wave 3 and just burning. I have the latest dashboard also. It's repeating all the time the same update-question. And result is the same whether you answer yes or no - the game doesn't work.

update the dashboard through usb ,after u download the dash update from microsoft site,

then flash it ,cause u will need the new dashboared anyway for the new games to work like Crysis 2 and Dragon age 2 .... as i said ( i dont know if bulletstorm require the new dash )
