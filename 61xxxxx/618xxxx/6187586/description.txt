      Britain is a less equal society than at any time since World
      War One. In Who Gets the Best Jobs, Richard Bilton investigates
      access to the professions - and finds that the best jobs are
      being snapped up by an increasingly small gene pool of
      privileged, well-connected families. Getting a good degree
      matters more than ever - and those from low income families can
      no longer easily work their way up from the bottom without the
      qualifications, contacts and social skills that their more
      fortunate counterparts make full use of.
