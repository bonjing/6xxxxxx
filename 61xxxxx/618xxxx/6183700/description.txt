DEMOLITION 2: ROUGH HEADS
vSpy vSpy demos which were painstakingly put together on cd by Ian Marshall of Tronador records in Brasil. These are original recordings which never made it onto our albums in the format they appear here. Rough and ready, but indicative of the bands influences & origins, many of these demos were re-worked into songs which finally appeared on our commercial releases. Ian, an ex-pat Aussie in Brasil came to Newcastle and took a big box of old Spy cassettes back with him to explore and find the best versions of the bands demos. Eternal thanks to Ian for his perseverance & dedication to vSpy vSpy.
