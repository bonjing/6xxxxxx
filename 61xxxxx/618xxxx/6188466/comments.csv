these are the ones, from msdn"
,Crisso2face,2011-02-23T07:39Z,ok... somthing`s wrong here. The first MSDN or technet distribution`s of windows 7 wich were released in june 2009 if Im not mistaken were actually all in one. In the preinstallation  menu you had the option to select the version to install from startar to ultimate. Do you mean to tell me that now with sp1 microsoft isn`t supling disks wich gives you that option anymone? I kind of doubed that.

i couldn't understand what did you mean ? This is MSDN version it realised on 16th of february .. Here is Hashes :

,o0luigi0o,2011-02-23T15:26Z,"ya thats exactly why i need home pre sp1, because i think depending the cd key you enter it wont give you that list, not sure though. 

beqa909 can you upload those two files too?"
,beqa909,2011-02-23T18:00Z,I don't have any rosource to upload those files and why don't you install win7 ultimate >? 
,Crisso2face,2011-02-23T22:09Z,"beqa909 

What I mean is that when windows 7 was first released the iso or disk had all the versions available for selection in instillation menu, or booting menu. You know, when you boot the CD/DVD, hit install, select the version to install from starter to ultimate and then proceed to ""EULA"" or something for license agreement, and then partitioning option and install. Lately it`s been harder and harder to find a iso distribution that isn`t fully or partially automated to ultimate or other version.
I need a clean untouched version of windows 7 sp1 installation distribution. I work a lot with windows installation and I don't always install the ultimate version. The first release of windows 7 which was in june 2009, the original release of msdn or tech net did indeed give me the option of choosing the install version from starter to ultimate.
DOES THIS RELEASE GIVE ME THIS OPTION OR NOT? 
A simple question."

since you're too lazy to check the microsoft site for the official SHA1 sum, why do you bother trying to download windows at all? Ubuntu might be a better option for you.

Accessing the subscriptions download site to see the official sha1 sums is free on microsoft's site, you only need a free live.com account.

Contract subscription is only needed for downloading the files directly from MS, but if you dont have a contract you can still use the sha-1 sum to check for the files in other places (e.g. here on tpb)
