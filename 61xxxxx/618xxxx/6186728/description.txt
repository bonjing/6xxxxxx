March of the Penguins
La marche de l'empereur
Pticy 2: Puteshestvie na kraj sveta (Marsh pingvinov)
Die Reise Der Pinguine


The original French language release features a first-person narrative as if the story is being told by the penguins themselves. The narration alternates between a female (Romane Bohringer) and a male (Charles Berling) narrator speaking the alternate roles of the female and male penguin, and as the chicks are born their narration is handled by a child actor Jules Sitruk.

In contrast, the English language release has a third-person narrative by a single voice, actor Morgan Freeman.
