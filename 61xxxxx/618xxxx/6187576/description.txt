 First, you should know that Adventure Wires is more independent than a stray cat; it doesnâ€™t pay tribute to any tackle producer, fishing resort or any other big name in the fishing industry.

Second, this amazing story is for the amateur angler, for the adventure lover that doesnâ€™t see fishing as a competition but as an opportunity to taste natureâ€™s beauty and the thrills of fighting a wild fish.

In the last years we saw more and more fishing shows placed in exclusive resorts, prohibitive destinations or very dangerous parts of the world, where only a handful of anglers would have access to. We felt the need to make a show for anglers like us and try to recapture the fishing as a holiday adventure, something any angler could do.
