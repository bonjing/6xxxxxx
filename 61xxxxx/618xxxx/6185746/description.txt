Berlin - No More Words [Bananas tv show 1984].VOB


HQ Bananas tv show promo music video from an outstanding and very rare 1980's tv show from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's.

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.  

"No More Words" is a song from Love Life, the third album by the American new wave band Berlin, released in 1984.

Berlin is an American New Wave/Synthpop band. The group was formed in Los Angeles in 1978 by John Crawford (bass guitar), Terri Nunn (vocals), David Diamond (keyboards) who were later joined by Ric Olsen (guitar), Matt Reid (keyboards) and Rob Brill (drums). The band first gained commercial success in the mid 1980s with singles including "The Metro", "Sex (I'm A...)", "No More Words" and the chart-topping single "Take My Breath Away" from the 1986 film Top Gun.
