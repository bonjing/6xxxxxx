Chris Coole is a Toronto based clawhammer banjo player of some renown (in fact he may be one of the best in the world). Heâ€™s played with and for some great artists over the years (Jenny Whiteley, Jim Cuddy, Sylvia Tyson, and Justin Rutledge.) But itâ€™s with this, his first solo record, Old Dog, that Chris has really stepped out/up. The album features 5 original songs as well as some traditional numbers and covers of songs by The Band, John Hartford and Dave Dudley. The record also features friends on fiddle, pedal steel, mandola, cello and percussion. The song styles range from traditional folk to honky-tonk to contemporary bluegrass. I like that Old Dog has a nice, easy, casual feel. The record sounds organic and the songs are a natural for Chrisâ€™ laid back vocal delivery and masterful guitar/banjo playing. 

It was hard to pick just one song since thereâ€™s a variety of styles on the record and since there are so many fine songs. But I forced myself to choose one and itâ€™s the Chris Coole original â€œHell To Payâ€ (although a close second was either the title track â€œOld Dogâ€, the duet called â€œThe Bottle Got The Best Of Meâ€ that reminded me of Prine/Dement, or the John Hartford cover â€œWish We Had Our Time Togetherâ€).
