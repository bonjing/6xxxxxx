,iGotIVIoXy,2011-05-04T10:51Z,"post the stats in the comment box, sound quality, bitrates, more info on the torrent usually helps.

also... i only heard about this band today... how old are they? could be just a small fan base?"
,emplusjay,2011-06-25T18:59Z,"Sound is good. To make it download faster, right-click on the downloading torrent and change the ""Bandwidth Allocation"" from ""Normal"" to ""High"". I'm using BitTorrent, so assuming the options are the same on uTorrent or any other torrent downloader, changing the bandwidth should improve the downloading speed. 

The Icarus Account have been around since 2006. They are an unsigned band, so I'm pretty sure their fan base is quite small. They're an awesome band and need to be discovered by a record label. Yeah. Okay, I'm done :)"
,bawybaw,2011-08-25T04:57Z,I would like to thank you immensely for uploading this. They are an amazing band. I've seen them in concert twice already and i love their music. I always download music but this is one of the few bands that i feel bad for stealing it simply because of how much i respect their raw talent and amazing music. Thank you for the upload and hopefully this causes them to be more widespread
