I Told You So is one of the finest records Omar & the Howlers ever released, filled with roaring, impassioned performances and a sharp set of material.

Just listen to the more uptempo swamp music numbers like "Magic Man", "Rocket To Nowhere" and the title track. This second Omar & The Howlers recording also features some slow blues tracks like "Ice Cold Woman" and "East Side Blues."

Play this one LOUD!!!
