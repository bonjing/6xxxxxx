 Maliâ€™s Boubacar TraorÃ© is a musician with a singular story. He was a star in the 1960s, dropped into obscurity for twenty years and then returned to the limelight. For fifty years, this soulful artist has composed songs in a unique style marked by historical events such as the independence of Mali, and his own life story, songs with a serene and melancholy air. When TraorÃ© talks about Mali Denhou, his eighth album, he highlights the importance of peace - to be at peace with yourself, with history, the ancestors, the entire country. His age? The question makes him chuckle like a young man: â€œAh noâ€, he says, â€œthatâ€™s a secret!â€ Kar-Kar, as heâ€™s known, can be both serious and playful - he has a twinkle in his eye when he talks about his â€˜oldiesâ€™ - the great hits â€˜Kar-Kar Madisonâ€™ and â€˜Mali Twistâ€™ â€“ and when he exclaims â€œMali Denhou was recorded in just one day in the studio!â€ Some of the tracks have been playing in his mind since the 1960s, and others, such as â€˜Dundobesse Mâ€™Bedouniatoâ€™, are new. â€œIn that song I say Iâ€™ve had my time in this world, thatâ€™s it! One day, I will have to go. One day a man is having a glorious time, and the next, he is gone, he becomes nothing.â€ The words are inspired by his life, one marked by great success as well as disappointments.

Boubacar TraorÃ© was born in Kayes, in Western Mali, to a noble family. As a youth he was an exceptional football player with the promise of a great sporting career ahead. Then an injury put an end to those dreams in the late 1950s. Goodbye football: all he kept was his nick-name â€œKar-Karâ€ (the dribbler). He learnt guitar with his brother and developed his own style. â€œI play guitar as though it were a koraâ€, he explains. â€œMy playing is inspired by the Manding style, I play â€˜double scaleâ€™.â€ His 1963 song â€˜Mali Twistâ€™ was broadcast several times a day on national radio, becoming a post-independence anthem and a huge hit with the young generation. It was this song which made him a star in the 60s. But his fame earned him nothing so he started working as a tailor. Everyone in Mali thought he was dead. Apart from a surprise television appearance in 1987 he remained in obscurity, and when his beloved wife Pierrette passed away he left for France for a number of years. Later he returned to Kayes where he ran a little store. In 1989 he was tracked down by some journalists from Radio Mali, recorded his first cassette and went to perform in the UK and France. In Mali he was welcomed back to the music scene with open arms, releasing several albums and becoming a crucial figure in Malian music. He was also a reminder of the lowly status sometimes conferred on musicians in Africa. So Mali Denhou is also a message: â€œIt should be recognised that I did a lot for my country in the 1960s,â€ concludes Kar Kar. â€œThe leaders should protect musicians and their art! Itâ€™s thanks to them that the name of Mali has crossed all the rivers in the world!â€

Unusual, to say the least.   You can listen and make up your
own minds.   This wrecked my fuckin' shed.

In a strange way...it's bizarre...but lures you in....

And it's pretty good...
