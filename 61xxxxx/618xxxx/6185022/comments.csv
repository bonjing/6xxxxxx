The multi-part RARs are for newsgroups to enable better transmission.  This is not needed with bittorrent.

Torrenting files in multi-part rar format will discourage people from seeding because they will not want to keep the RARs after extracting the original files.  Easily, that takes too much space and it doesn't matter how much storage one has -- I have more than 10TB here at home and I am still running out of space.  So please, extract and then build the torrent?"

1) You know you're getting it 100% working
2) You can satisfy ""scene only"" ftps/sites with them
3) I live at year 2011 atm, i suggest you hop here too from your 90s. It's much faster these days."
