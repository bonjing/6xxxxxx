     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Documentary-maker David Malone delves into the secrets of
      ocean waves. In an elegant and original film he finds that waves
      are not made of water, that some waves travel sideways and that
      the sound of the ocean comes not from water but from bubbles.
      Waves are not only beautiful but also profoundly important, and
      there is a surprising connection between the life cycle of waves
      and the life of human beings.
