The King of Limbs is the eighth studio album by English alternative rock band Radiohead, produced by Nigel Godrich. It was released on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV formats. It will be followed by a physical CD release in the UK on 28 March [1] and a special "newspaper" edition on 9 May 2011.[2]
The "newspaper" edition will contain two 10-inch vinyl records in a special record sleeve, many large sheets of artwork, 625 tiny pieces of artwork, a compact disc, and a colour piece of oxo-degradable plastic package.[3] The album will be released by Ticker Tape in the United States, XL in the United Kingdom and Hostess Entertainment in Japan.[4]
The album was announced on Radiohead's website on 14 February 2011, four days before release.[5] The release date was originally announced as 19 February, but the band reportedly decided at the last minute to make the album available one day early.[6]
The name of the album possibly refers to an oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest, thought to be 1,000 years old.[5] The tree is a pollarded oak, referring to an ancient technique for harvesting timber for fencing and firewood. Though it does not feature on maps, the tree is said to be 3 miles (4.8 km) from Tottenham Court House, where Radiohead recorded part of their previous album In Rainbows.[7] On 18 February, Radiohead's official blog published the first song from the album, "Lotus Flower", with an accompanying music video,[8] followed by a post announcing the album was released.[9]
