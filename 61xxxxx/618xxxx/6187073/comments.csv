,Beaululu,2011-02-21T00:05Z,"Hello Easyflyer,

My god, I don't know what I can say except a simple : thank you very much ! Seriously, I was looking for that CBT for a while !! About the others CBT's, I've found that tutorial, it's was about the Human Factor CBT. I don't know if it will be the same. Did you try ? I do a copy :

1.Unzip and mount the disk.
2.When it starts push the ""Install"" button.
3.If you get and error warning - push ""ignore"".
4.Than it says ""Could not open input file:............""
5.Press ignore to all the messages that you get.
6.Than it says ""Installation successful"". Press ""Finish"".
7.Select menu (with the right mouse button) of the mounted image.
8.Select ""explore"". Now you see all the folders that your mounted disk has.
9.Select all the folders from your disk Image and press ""copy"".
10.Now go to the directory,where the program is installed (C:Program Files:OAT Media:ATPL Human Performance 1 (2) )
11.Paste all the documents and folders, that you had copied from the disk image.
12.After that, go to ""crack"" folder, copy ""HP-Menu"" file (If it's disk 1) or ""HU-Menu"" file 
(If it's disk 2) and paste it to ""C: Program Files: OAT Media: ATPL Human Performance 1(2): system"".
That will replace the original file to the cracked one.
13.Now create a shortcut from that cracked HP-Menu or HU-Menu file (Installed in system directory) 
on your desktop. (This part is for your convenience only. The program will work even without doing so.)
14.Push the shortcut twice and enjoy the program. 

Let us know if it works also for the others.

Thank you very much for your sharing dude !"
,easyflyer,2011-02-21T00:09Z,"I will try these steps and will let you know. I know this cbt is great! I was tired of waiting and bought 5 of them, the ones you can't download. They are well worth the price in any case. Since I got the other ones free, I thought I'd send the favor back out!
More on the way if I can figure them out...to be continued..."
,easyflyer,2011-02-21T00:14Z,"While reading fully what you wrote I realize that I tried that. I also tried the crack from the other cbt's and renamed them...obviously doesn't work. The image is complete, but when you try to run them, an error message comes up from a security protection software company. It wants the original in the drive. So unless you guys can figure out a way to crack, it is useless for me to send out...
Keep me updated on the findings of your research, or just buy them I guess! (You know you want the original disk anyways!) Cheers!"
,Beaululu,2011-02-21T07:58Z,"Damned ! It's seems to be tricky this time.
Meanwhile, it can be a good idea to upload it anyway, it would be easier (and motivating) for us to find a way to resolve the problem by having the software rather than being without it. Somebody has already resolved the issue for meteorology or Human Factor... 
Let us know
Cheers"
,karldd,2011-03-10T12:16Z,"Easyflyer, could you upload the other cbt's so we can try to overrun the protection."
,planeboy_777,2011-03-10T14:32Z,"This CBT is Working withuot any probss...bingo..!!!!
