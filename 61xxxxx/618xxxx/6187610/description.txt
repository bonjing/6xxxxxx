Box Of Fire
Bonus Disc (1994)


Known for an aggressively rhythmic style as rooted in James Brown funk as in traditional blues, Aerosmith were the top American hard-rock band of the mid-Seventies. After drug problems and internal dissension nearly destroyed the group, Aerosmith mounted a spectacular comeback in the 1980s. Despite a considerably more commercially slick and power-ballad oriented sound than theyâ€™d first emerged with, frequently drawing on outside songwriters, they managed to became even more popular the second time around.

For the serious Aerosmith fan looking to obtain all of the band's classic releases for Columbia, 1994's Box of Fire is a quintessential purchase. Included are all of the band's 12 releases for their original record company, as well as a five-track bonus disc that features previously unreleased/hard-to-find songs (an absolute highlight of which is a killer reading of "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu"). All of the albums have been remastered from the original source tapes using 20-bit technology, and the packaging is excellent -- each CD booklet is chock-full of classic photos and memorabilia from each specific album's era. Such Aero masterpieces as 1974's Get Your Wings, 1975's Toys in the Attic, and 1976's Rocks have only improved with age; and by listening back to such releases as Draw the Line and Night in the Ruts (which were both panned by critics when first issued), you'll discover many forgotten classics. Although not all of the albums consist of original material (three live albums and two greatest-hits packages are included in the set), Box of Fire is highly recommended despite its steep price.
