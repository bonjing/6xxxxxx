Zayda's dressed for the season with a cool summer dress.

I feel like I'm looking through a piece of plastic wrap looking at these pictures.

Zayda has an animal print robe. The robe is silk, it's not a real animal skin. That wouldn't be 

very convenient for the animal.

It's warm enough to use the loft for a few shots and we took advantage recently when Zayda was 

here. Spring is the best time of year for upstairs shooting, and the morning light in the window 

is very nice. Soon, Summer will be here and the loft will be too hot. Oh well. Good things come 

in small doses.
