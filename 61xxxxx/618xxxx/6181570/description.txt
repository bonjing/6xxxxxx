"Bubu's Anabelas, in my opinion, is not only the best progressive rock album to come out of Argentina but also ranks as one of the best prog albums to come out of the seventies. This album features music that sounds like a mixture of King Crimson and Anglagard. Bubu was quite a large band. Along with the usual guitar/bass/drums, the band also had a violinist, flutist, and saxophonist. They are also helped out by a part-time pianist. The album consists of three long compositions written by a composer who does not play in the band. Their music is complex, energetic, and diabolical in a King Crimson-ish sort of way. Many sections feature exciting interplay between the guitarist, flutist, violinist, and saxophonist. The last two tracks feature short passages with spanish vocals, and even Magma-influenced choir. If you're looking for an introduction to the Argentinian progressive rock, or if you're a fan of Anglagard, this is an album to add to your collection."

"...This is a pretty adventurous album, but there is so much good music that repeated listenings can't help but be rewarding. The most impressive thing is that it manages to have a foot in either camp, being both melodic and avant-garde, without sounding like a compromise."
