      Round table arts and culture discussion programme. Martha
      Kearney is joined by guests including Johann Hari and playwright
      Mark Ravenhill to discuss two environmentally themed plays,
      Greenland at the National Theatre and The Heretics at the Royal
      Court. They also turn their critical gaze on the BBC's
      Christopher Isherwood biopic Christopher and His Kind, David
      Vann's latest book Caribou Island, and the new Coen brothers
      western True Grit.
