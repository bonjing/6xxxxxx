[quote][color=red]Sweet Giant of the Blues is a solid record. Seemingly more accidental than intentional, the production is clean and separated. Yet it has a roomy quality that highlights the superb musicianship here. The set starts out with a fast and furious version of "Got My Mojo Workin'." Otis Spann's Delta-inspired voice shines over the group, which sounds very tight, and much like the Chess sessionmen. "Moon Blues" is a song highlighted with fuzz guitar leads and a '70s sound. The funky "I'm a Dues Payin' Man" is a refreshing change of pace on the album, while "Bird in a Cage" is a soulful instrumental. Coming through as the standout track, "Bird in a Cage" reaffirms blues musicians as some of the best players in music. The track showcases Ray Charles-esque piano playing and blues saxophone -- which takes away from the song by adding a '70s feel to the recording. Overall, this is a tight record by a man with one of the best voices in the blues.[/color][/quote]
