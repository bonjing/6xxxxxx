The whole idea of torrent completely nullifies the argument for rar, please understand this. We no longer live in the early 90's!!!"
,tehnores,2011-02-18T21:47Z,"Please, no more RAR. Everyone hates it. And it looks like it's only added to the filesize, not lowered it as you expected."
,fish121,2011-02-20T00:53Z,"Thank you! 
Much appreciated."

If this is the only torrent out there for the 720p I sure as hell am not going to complain and criticize the uploader about a little inconvenience like this. Takes less than a minute.

Thanks for the upload."
