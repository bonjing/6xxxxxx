Fans of both rock and electronic music The Watermarks effortlessly bridge the gap between the two genres. The band are known not only for their incendiary live performances, but also their D.I.Y. approach to recording, writing, and producing which has yielded 2 self released EPs. These Indie rock D.I.Y. Ethics, noise-pop sensibilities, and electronic textures have lead the band to craft a unique sound where melody is the main character...a sound that is danceable and poppy yet full of loud guitars and heavy organic drums. The Watermarks reside in Houston and rarely rest from writing new material and playing live shows.
