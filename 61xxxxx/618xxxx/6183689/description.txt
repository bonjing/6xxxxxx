AO MOD TV VERS
vSpy vSpy second album recorded with Lezsek Karski: the Golden Pole (that's a joke: he's Polish). This was our first ever certified Gold Record which brought great success to the band. The cover shot was taken in the old Sydney Powerhouse, which is a museum now of course. We went on tour with 11 television sets on-stage & the road-crew were very loyal in lugging them on & off-stage every night. When "World Cup" soccer was on, Mike would have them all tuned to the game so he could watch soccer while we played our set. Sometimes he'd make mistakes on his guitar when Arsenal scored a goal!  This was our biggest selling album.
