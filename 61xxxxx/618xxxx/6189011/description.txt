Does a songwriter chase his muse â€“ or is it the other way â€˜round? Thatâ€™s but one of the intriguing notions at the heart of Stan Ridgwayâ€™s 2010 release, Neon Mirage, arguably the most refined, yet musically eclectic collection of the veteran L.A. singer-songwriter/Wall of Voodoo founderâ€™s career. â€œYou never really have a choice about the tone and subject matter of the records you make,â€ Ridgway confides. â€œAt least I donâ€™t. Theyâ€™re obsessions, really. Itâ€™s about the music, and how it heals the mind.â€ When Stan lost a beloved uncle, a colleague (Texas violinist Amy Farris, whose brilliant Neon Mirage work serves as fitting elegy), and the man who inspired so much of the musicianâ€™s own worldview, his own father, during the albumâ€™s writing/recording, Ridgway responded with some of the most reflective â€“ if no less joyous â€“ songs heâ€™d ever recorded. â€œEvents like that canâ€™t help but have an impact on the music youâ€™re making at the time,â€ Stan admits. "Youâ€™d be lying to yourself â€” and your listeners â€” if you thought otherwise. I've probably confused people with my music, my choices, the albums and the changes in direction from year to year. But I canâ€™t help it. Thereâ€™s a weird old American jukebox in my head and it still plays everything thatâ€™s ever got under my skin.â€


"Music is more than just chords and notes to me, it has the ability to make pictures in the mind. My records are designed to be seen as well as heard."
