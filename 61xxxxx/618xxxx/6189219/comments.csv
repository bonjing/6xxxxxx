,sajjad26,2011-04-08T10:13Z,"Wow, works like a treat
Awesome"
,GryphonB,2011-05-24T02:15Z,"This works really well, apart from 2 aspects:
1. A graphic simulation in it's own window wipes the schematic clean. Aaargh! However Oscilloscope (& I assume other instruments) work fine. 
2. The help files do not load correctly, for me at least: I need to load them directly from the Help folder.

Other than that it is the most complete, easy, elegant, fast, comprehensive, intuitive simulator I've ever used (which I haven't for about 5 years!). Norton reports no virus. "

,krontech,2012-01-29T06:08Z,"Generating a signal from LPC2000
i can see it on the scope or on a digital analysis.
The logic analyzer doesn't work though - it stays blank, regardless if i connect my signal, or something from the pattern generator, or even a 555.
I couldn't find any proteus version with a working logic analyzer.
Any suggestions?"
