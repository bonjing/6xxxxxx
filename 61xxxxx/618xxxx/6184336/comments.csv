,jimmicrack,2011-02-19T06:13Z,"Man, I hope this works. Thanks in advance!"
,fenderron,2011-02-19T07:43Z,"I have installed all of them on 5 different machines over the last couple years, and they work great.  In fact when I made the keygen I tested it when I installed it all on my laptop."
,Indie8,2011-02-19T08:31Z,i hope this works cuz this is 3rd that kind torrent im trying to instal.
,Indie8,2011-02-19T08:47Z,does it have apartment life?
,fenderron,2011-02-19T15:54Z,"It includes the Sims 2, and ALL Expansions/Stuff Packs (University, Nightlife, Open For Business, Pets, Seasons, Family Fun Stuff, Glamour Life Stuff, Bon Voyage, H&M Fashion Stuff, IKEA Home Stuff, Celebration Stuff, Free Time, Teen Style Stuff, and Kitchen and Bath Stuff).
"
,Indie8,2011-02-19T16:08Z,so it means no apartment life expension pack. well can i put together with apartment life it?

,fenderron,2011-02-19T17:56Z,It does include apartment life too.  not sure how I missed that in the list.
,Indie8,2011-02-19T19:44Z,thank you and i hope it will work.:)
,fenderron,2011-02-19T20:11Z,"Just remember that in order to play it you need to copy the Crack from the crack folder to the installed directory.  The easiest way I have found is to install everything, and then try to run it without cracking.  It will prompt you to insert Disc 1 (of one of the expansions).  Take note of which expansion, and just crack that one.  If I remember correctly it is Mansion and Garden stuff."
,JennMcFly,2011-02-19T21:33Z,"I just started downloading now, but thank you so, SO much in advance for this! :) "
,JennMcFly,2011-02-21T05:03Z,"I've downloaded it and everything [Thanks a bunch btw :)] and am Seeding, but I have a problem...this is probably going to make me sound intensely stupid, but when it pops up and says to insert Disc 2, I open it with PowerISO and click the RunGame.exe but nothing happens x.x It looks like it's loading but doesn't start anything"
,fenderron,2011-02-21T07:17Z,"@Jenn - Are you having difficulty installing?  The easiest way I have found is to create a Virtual Drive (I'm not familiar with PowerISO, but am assuming that it can be done), and then mount the ISO (image file) to the virtual drive.  Then you can simply click OK on the ""Insert Disc 2"" pop-up.   You can also burn the ISO's onto CD's (although this will require several cd's, and one DVD, and a considerable amount of time.  *Also note that the game will not run from the burned cd's, it still needs to be cracked).  You should be able to right click on the ISO files, and in the menu that comes up there should be something there like ""PowerISO"", ""Mount"", or ""Load"", or something like that which lets you put the virtual cd (ISO file) into your virtual drive.  Hopefully I didn't just cause more confusion."
,JennMcFly,2011-02-21T08:48Z,Beauty! It worked perfectly! Thanks a billion! 
,KittensClaws,2011-02-21T22:42Z,Can someone seed this please? Need my Sims fix! Thank you so much!
,JennMcFly,2011-02-21T23:27Z,@kitten : Does it say anyone is seeding now? :P
,KittensClaws,2011-02-22T00:36Z,"A few, yes, but I'm just impatient. Would rather not wait a day and 3 hours... Eh, maybe seeders isn't the fix. "
,Indie8,2011-02-22T09:01Z,@kittens : im waiting 3rd day and i think its worth to wait ;) its a good pack. :) its a new torrent but already have so many seeders.
,JennMcFly,2011-02-22T18:32Z,"At the risk of sounding like a total twit, I have one more question X.X This is an epic fail on my part. I prompts me to insert the original Garden and Masion CD and I've copied the crack into Program Files/EAGames/Sims2 and I click retry but it's not doing anything, the wondow just pops up again x.x"
,fenderron,2011-02-23T16:23Z,"@Jenn - Copy and paste the crack into the folder for the expansion (Mansion and Garden crack goes into the Mansion and Garden folder, replacing the .exe for Mansion and Garden Stuff).  Hope this helps.  "
,Indie8,2011-02-24T11:19Z,i try to run it but it says that-failed to enumerate any DirectX 9 compatible grafics adapters in this system.Please make sure you have a Directx9 compatible grafics adapter and have installed the latest manufacturer provided driver. What shoudl i do now?
,Indie8,2011-02-24T18:16Z,i put crack of mansion only and i put it in mansion folder and it doesnt replace any axe and when i try to run game with opening that crack it gives me the msg i wrote before. :(
,fenderron,2011-02-24T19:46Z,"@Indie - Your problem is a hardware (Graphics adapter) , or Directx9 issue.  Make sure you have a compatible graphics adapter, and install Directx9, or higher.  "
,fikes,2011-02-24T20:55Z,does this only work for PC or is it mac compatible as well?

,kjp001,2011-02-27T14:51Z,"I've just finished downloading and installing, all seems well! Just a quick question, I have had a run in with what you described in an earlier post, that being the need to crack 'sims2 Mansion and garden stuff' My question is, where do I find this crack folder and what file must I copy? Sorry to be a nuisance, this is my first attempt at doing anything like this! :)"
,fenderron,2011-02-28T16:11Z,"the Mansion and Garden crack is located on the Mansion and Garden ISO in the crack folder.  Just mount the ISO, and open it.  Go to the crack folder, and copy both files, and paste them into the installed directory (ex. C:/Program Files/EA Games).  Overwrite the existing files of the same name."
,QuickClaw25,2011-03-05T07:42Z,"Hi, I'm wondering when I downloaded the Sims Expansions, not stuff packs, the crack is not in the folder. For example, Nightlife does not have a crack folder. Neither does University, etc. However, Mansions and Gardens do, can you explain to me how this works?"
,o0TsubasaNoTenshi0o,2011-03-06T14:52Z,"Sorry if this sound stupid or something, I look in the iso the crack folder but theres none =/ Maybe I'm not looking in the right way xD The folder is inside of another folder? "
,pupcookie,2011-03-16T21:16Z,"So I installed the Sims 2, and everything seemed to be working fine... Then I went to go try and play it and it asked me to insert the right disk... I ""inserted"" all 4 disks, and neither of them made the game work.

By the way, I used PowerISO to install the disks.

I keep reading that you have to install the crack from the crack folder... But when I open up the files on the disk, I don't see any crack folder there! help!! "
,Gena718,2011-03-20T12:32Z,"Im new here and Im completely lost. Everytime I click the download this torrent button, it brings up a link that asks me to choose which program to open it with. Any help? Im using a Google Chrome browser"

,gairwyn,2011-03-21T16:23Z,"At risk of sounding like an idiot, can someone explain to me how to work this torrent. I've downloaded the Sims 2 isos, but I've never used UltraISO before so any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for a great torrent!"

,xSanguinex,2011-04-21T17:46Z,"So, after installing the base game, it works, but when I try to install an EP it tries to update and de-installs it. I know the instructions say to go into the Updates folder and use the ""Sims 2 Update,"" but the only one in there is for Free Time. That's it. "
,xSanguinex,2011-04-21T18:07Z,I seemed to have fixed the updates problem by installing a legit copy of Celebration Stuff... 
,xSanguinex,2011-04-21T22:54Z,"And finally, after spending all day downloading this, Glamour Life has an error because of a missing file, as does Bon Voyage, and Mansion and Garden won't even mount. Plus, there are cracks for Seasons and Apartment when it says that there should be one for M&G. There's also only the Free Time update. All in all, this is BS. You're better off getting them one by one. "
,reforged,2011-04-24T14:09Z,"Quick and dirty installer manual for all having problems with this:
First of all, make sure you have powerIso (or daemontools or similar) with a virtual drive enabled. DonÂ´t try installing without, you can even get powerIso here (in case you dindÂ´t come up with that idea). Then:
Start by mounting the first image into that virtual drive, and install the game. Use the included keygen to generate the serial. After installing the game itself, install all the expansions and stuff packs, ending with the last one ""ikea stuff"". When done with that one, remount the ""Mansion Garden Stuff"" image, and copy 2 files FROM the crack folder in that image TO the TSbin folder from that expansion pack onto your C: drive, eg C:\Program Files (x86)\EA GAMES\De Sims 2 Villa en Tuin Accessoires\TSBin (Yes this is windows 7 and itÂ´s dutch, but donÂ´t be an idiot, youÂ´ll get the picture) overwriting the files that are in there with the same name. Start the game by clicking the Ikea expansion shortcut on your desktop and the game WILL start and run, with all expansions included. Have a couple of mins patience when you start the game for the first time.
@fenderron: thanx for this great upload, saved me lots of time trying to get all included one-by-one!"
,reforged,2011-04-24T14:14Z,"One more thing, forgot to mention that (and i´m not sure if it´s needed but that is how i did it...) 
After installing the game but before installing the expansion, download the sims2 update patch from thesims2.ea.com/update (the sims2 cd patch) and install that. When that is done, start installing with the expansions."

,maired,2011-04-25T21:53Z,"like many others, i do have a problem :(

So you have given specific instructions to ""  Go to your EA GAMES folder > The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff > TSBin > Rename Sims2EP8.exe to Sims2EP8.exe.bak or Sims2EP8_backup.exe
2) Go to the Cracks folder > The Sims 2 Mansion & Garden Stuff > The Sims 2 Mansion & Garden Stuff 1.0 > Copy the crack file Sims2EP8.exe > Paste that crack file into the TSBin subdirectory of The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff directory "" 

I can easily preform step #2, but when I go into EA GAMES> The sims mansion and garden stuff... there is only 3 files -the sims mansion and garden stuff
-the uninstall the sims 2 '   ' 
-www.thesims3.com(sims2doubledelux-2)

I may be a complete idiot for asking this but help?
Also I have right clicked>show package continents and i couldnt find it.

+ when i click sims launcher, it asks me to insert disk (mansion + garden) 

Again, idiot here... but help?"

,alicethestrange,2011-05-09T07:52Z,How do you create a Virtual Drive and how do you mount the ISO? Cause I just downloaded the torrent and Idk how to install it at all... I open the first disk with ISO buster and extract it to my downloads and run the setup but then when it gets to the 2nd disk I also open that with ISO buster and extract it into my downloads and try to run the RunGameexe. but nothing happens... what Am I doing wrong?
,AB032789,2011-05-10T19:19Z,"Ok...

I have read all these comments, and I am having the same problem. I have ripped these files onto DVD, I have used the ISO program, I've done all I can, and it still tells me that I need to insert the correct CD-ROM. I have all faith that this works, but after spending way too much time trying to figure this out, it's like: WTF?

So, if someone could just tell me what I am doing wrong....or has this torrent been abandoned by it's owners. 

The first time, I just burned all the files onto DVD with Roxio, and then I was getting the same: Insert correct CD-ROM message, no matter what I tried, so I said, ""Well, maybe it's the program."" So I downloaded PowerISO, and attempted to get that to work. The game finished downloading, but gave me the same messages. I only tried downloading the first Sims 2 game due to the horrible amount of time it takes to download only to find it doesn't work, which, hey! It didn't. 

Anyway, I'm sure this works, I just think I am missing something here. And as far as Crack files are concerned, I don't see any of these in my download. 

I'm not trying to bitch or give shit to anyone, I just want this to work."
