"Looking for Leonard is a funny and poignant urban fairy tale about a girl, a guy, and Leonard Cohen. Jo robs corner stores and dry cleaners with her boyfriend Ted and his brother Johnny. While she is too slack to actually have dreams, Jo secretly believes there is something better out there. Luka, a Czech computer programmer, arrives in the wonderful New World, but the excitement doesnâ€™t last long. His employer has gone bankrupt and his apartment is a dump. Destiny calls when Jo and Luka meet in a drugstore. Between the shampoo and deodorants they fall in love, but there are homicidal boyfriends and suspicious hearts in their way. Soon, murder charges and homelessness join the list. Their story unfolds on the streets of MontrÃ©al, where classical collides with contemporary, fable confronts reality, and punk-rock embraces Leonard Cohen in an existential tale of despair and joy for the young and old."
