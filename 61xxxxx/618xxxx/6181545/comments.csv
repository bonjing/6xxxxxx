,godfather_cwq,2011-02-24T14:41Z,When this file finished loading on my PC my computer crashed and took three attempts to load back up. The screen was scrambled like it had a virus. When i got it working scans showed no virus. I put my security on and ran the file which was stuttery if i moved the mouse and jumped. About 5 mins in the computer just switched itself off again. Coincidence? Just me? Who knows but I deleted the file and things are back to normal for me.
