This is my slipstreamed copy of XP Pro MVLK, built with NLite. 

It's an unattended installation, so no CD-Key required, and runs WGA-FIX (without the virus) afterwards, so just hit Yes and you're genuine and at your desktop.

There's some customization in that the user name is Main (which you can change), context menus are pretty stacked with M$ options and it is set to default to Classic Start Menu.

I built this because I got tired of the attended installation whenever I did an XP reinstall for someone. It's set to classic just so I can ship it to anybody via snail mail and not have them freak out over the expanding start menu settings.

This is clean, no viruses according to MBAM, which is all I run, and all anybody should run (in a perfect world where people know how to remove them with just a mouse or kb and no internet).





Long time listener, first time caller.

This is my very first contribution to TPB, I hope you like it!
