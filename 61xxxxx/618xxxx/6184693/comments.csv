It starts off with a cheesy inspirational ""your brain is an amazing thing and you can do great things in your life"" spiel. Then a summary of da Vinci's life (a glance through Wikipedia would provide the same info).

Then the 7 steps and exercises. Some of the exercises are pretty useful and they're arguably the best part of the book. Exercises include: keep a personal journal full of your questions and musings, embrace curiosity, ask questions about your own questions, practise stream-of-conciousness writing, question yours' and others' opinions, try making the strongest possible argument against your beliefs, layered listening, enjoying touch/smell/and auditory experiences, embracing ambiguity, and mind-mapping.

It ends with a rather bland and detailed plan on making 'mind maps'.

Overall, I doubt that the author's inspiration really was da Vinci -- you could replace 'da Vinci' in the title with Einstein, Socrates, Descartes, or any other great thinker and the content would have stayed exactly the same."
