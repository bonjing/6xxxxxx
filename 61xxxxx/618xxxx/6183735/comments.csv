,pirate_bit,2011-02-18T19:27Z,thank you
,pirate_bit,2011-02-18T19:29Z,it's converted from wav ?
,shiningwiz,2011-02-18T20:15Z,The digital album was released only in mp3 and wav formats no?
,Jack_Raiden,2011-02-19T01:14Z,"Yes. And I assume the WAV was (losslessly) converted to FLAC, thanks peck or encoder, and seeders. (Perhaps Radiohead should've released in FLAC instead of WAV, would've saved bandwidth, etc.)"
[V],peck1234,2011-02-19T03:16Z,"You assumed correctly. : )
