The films opens in 1947, with a dog scratching to be let outside, where the sky is covered in eerie lights. When his owner, a young girl lets it out, the dog, named Paul, is crushed by a crash landing spaceship. The girl pulls an alien from the wreckage, whom she names Paul, and he is taken away by the Government and held prisoner for 60 years. He eventually decides to escape from his holding place, Area 51.
Two British comic book nerds named Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) have travelled to America for a huge comic book convention and to visit all the sites of major extra terrestrial importance. On the way to their second site, they stop off at a cafÃ©, where two soldiers confront them. As they hurriedly leave, they reverse into the soldiersâ€™ car, leaving a dent. At the next site, they see a car blasting towards them and, believing it to be the soldiers, they speed off in their RV. Eventually, the car catches up, and they realize that it is not the soldiers. As it overtakes, it speeds off the road, rolls several times, and comes to a halt in a field. The two shocked men get out to investigate. When they realize that the vehicle is empty and begin phoning the emergency services, they hear a voice telling them not to. They turn around, and a little green alien comes into view, smoking a cigar, and introduces himself as Paul. Clive faints, and Paul explains to Graeme that he is on the run and needs their help. Graeme agrees to let him come. When Clive wakes up, he is not happy about the idea, but is eventually brought around."
