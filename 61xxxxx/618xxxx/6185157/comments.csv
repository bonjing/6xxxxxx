,froggykodok,2011-02-19T08:47Z,Guys - I pay for uploads and my speed is poor. I will try to max it out and get this up but once I do I can't afford to keep seeding on my own. As I'm a student & my uploads aren't cheap I'll throttle it after I've upped it and then I will be trusting you guys to keep it going. Don't let me down :)
