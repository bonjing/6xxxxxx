,justregged,2011-02-18T22:04Z,"Hi 20-40 

If your taking requests can you do Pleasantville i think the blu-ray came out a couple of weeks ago but no one has done a smaller size encode. About a gig would be fine. If its worth doing that is, i never seen it. "
,justregged,2011-02-18T22:08Z,"@sid

He already did carriers

Dont know if it still has seeds you would have to start the download to find out"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-18T22:14Z,"@i_am_sid: I did, twice. Maybe six months ago.

@justregged: Well, I am just about in midst of small-sizes. 1GB currently (if ever) cannot fit. It has nothing to do with you, or your request - movie is weird, but  nice to some."
,justregged,2011-02-18T22:37Z,No worries i'll ask around your allways my first port of call :)

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-19T11:24Z,@justregged; If you can't find small encode - and - if you want small-sized encode at all - I can rip BluRay... in small-size of my choice. Let me know on newest torrent.

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-19T14:46Z,"@i_am_sid: That torrent is sooo old and dead. Besides, it's iPod compatible version, not for big screens.
I can offer you same thing as to judtregged regarding Pleasantville."
