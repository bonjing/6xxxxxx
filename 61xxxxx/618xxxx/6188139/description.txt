 Part 25 of a library mainly epub.


This is the final part of the fiction selection from my ebook library.

Many of these books have added metadata that includes book review, book cover and star ratings. 

To access the Metadata you need to open the books with Calibre. You can also use Calibre to convert to different formats.

Calibre is freeware and can be downloaded at http://calibre-ebook.com/ 
 
for an ebook reader that will read multi formats have a look at the BE BOOK - http://mybebook.com/
