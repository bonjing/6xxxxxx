Thanks.
Colwyn."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-18T11:54Z,"Go on then but you'll have to promise to seed it. It'll be up tomorrow sometime, the day after at the latest."
,colwyn1,2011-02-18T12:37Z,"Sniffer, it's  ""Season 6""  I need. Can't get it anywhere! 
Thanks.
Colwyn."
[V],manOtor,2011-02-18T13:54Z,"Hey Sniffer_V.
You asked me, whether I'd have a request - well here you go: It would be great to have a DVDRip +  Extras from Spartacus Blood and Sand.
All the packs out there are some TV-Rips and no extras. Would keep it on my seedbox a while ;)..."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-18T22:24Z,"Colwyn, I'm just doing season 6 now. It also comes with seasons 1-5 + extras from seasons 1-4. All files DVDRip.

Man-o-tor, let me see what I can come up with for you."
,colwyn1,2011-02-18T22:56Z,"Sniffer, many thanks. Been looking out for Season 6 on a daily basis. Much appreciated and, yes, will seed continually.
Colwyn."
