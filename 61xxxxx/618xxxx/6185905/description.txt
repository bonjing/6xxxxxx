Notes:

Each year, almost 600 million customers visit IKEA. Discover how over 54
countries provide supplies for their colossal production line.

Proper reason:

I have included a 30 second cut from each release.

As you can see the ViLD release has tons and tons of blended frames, and it also
has several seconds of pixelated video after each commercial break.

Some may say that this is a qualitative proper, since there is no loss of
actual video and audio. But this degree of blended frames and pixelation just
can't be acceptable.
