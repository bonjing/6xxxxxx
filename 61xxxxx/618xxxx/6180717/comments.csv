,sleepwhileyouwait,2011-03-01T16:13Z,"Thanks!!! I looked everywhere and yours was the only one that worked for me.  It is only 32 days, but still better than seeing the annoying expiration message.  If you are trying to use this, make sure you disable your internet connection first so the key file pops up."
