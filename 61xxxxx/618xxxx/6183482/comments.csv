In 140 AD, during the reign of Antonius Pius, a young Roman centurion attempts to uncover the truth about the disappearance of his father's legionâ€”the Ninthâ€”in the north of Britain 20 years previously. The centurion, Marcus Aquila (Tatum), who was once the commander of a Roman garrison but was retired after he was severely injured in a battle against a band of Celtic barbarians, decides to travel into the northern mountains of Britain to find out had become of the Ninth legion and recover their eagle standard. Accompanied by a British slave, Esca (Bell), (whom he rescued from an amphitheatre show) Marcus Aquila travels beyond Hadrian's Wall into Caledonia (now known as Scotland), where he must confront the Pictish tribes to recover the legion's eagle standard and restore his father's reputation."
