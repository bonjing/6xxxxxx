,jaydhi,2011-02-18T17:41Z,"@skirtlifter, you're a know-nothing, non-contributing, knuckle dragging pathetic piece of turd. Maybe you should get off your bone idle butt and do something with your life, because at the moment if you choked to death on your own bile then we as a species would have moved a step further in the right direction.  If you don't like it don't download it.

PS... Thanks Free Tibet. Awesome"
,iridis_alpha,2011-02-18T17:41Z,"lol skirtlifter69 is clueless .. he wants compressed music compared to lossless FLAC quality, what a fucking noob hahahaha"
,g8aso,2011-02-18T17:49Z,"shirtlifter69  Who wants FLAC? Anyone whose ear work and has a decent audio set up NOT using a computer sound card, that's who.

Get your ears tested, and maybe the brain as well!"
,Bigpapapowell,2011-02-18T18:11Z,"Thank you FreeTibet,

Your quick work has not gone unappreciated!

Seed People!!! Seed!!!"
,disimagery2,2011-02-19T04:14Z,"this is being released in mp3 at 320 and also in 
WAV as digidl- what is the source of these FLAC files?  If the source was an actual cd, why not include a rip log [hopefully EAC] and the NONcompliant cue?"

,FreeTibet,2011-02-21T21:24Z,FLAC files were created from the digitally released WAV files to save bandwidth without compromising sound quality. Hence no log.
