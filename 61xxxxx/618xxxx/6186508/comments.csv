,.Leto.,2011-02-20T03:46Z,"really good picture quality but I stopped watching this when I heard the problem with the distorted bass. I knew it was going to bother me during the whole movie. I prefer to wait for another release with a proper audio track.
btw judging from the first minutes this movie looks awesome :) "
