,ScoreGods,2011-07-17T18:19Z,"Poor in quality - bad audio encoding !!!! 

@ Uploader

Uploading albums of master composers like Hans Zimmer  only makes sense if UNTOUCHED

Uploads are welcome in full albums

1. Wave
2. Flac

If anyone needs to encode into MP3 learn the way how it is done just right. Follow the instructions while encoding, make sure you do NOT run other applications while encoding (like working in Photoshop or another audio application while its running) Doing so ends in bad quality- like so many uploads here.

MASTER COMPOSER = Top notch quality in composing, recording and ""mastering"" 
The chance you make mistakes with YOUR audio file is rather high unless you are an audio engineer or other pro with a lot of sound studio experience.  

Do NOT touch the audio files else the upload gets a negative quality rating. 


Enough said"
,Ginlyf,2011-09-21T18:03Z,thanks =] This movie's soundtrack was just amazing!
,JakeThe44,2011-10-16T03:16Z,"Perfect quality. 10/10. Only missing one song i noticed, ""end of the road"". One of the best ones on there. PLEASE get it uploaded, that would make the collection complete, thanks :)"

He's a legend."
