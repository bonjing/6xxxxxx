Welcome to Fakeville!

This time Max and Stacy talk about Guanxi schemes selling fictional forests for real money, while real farmland can't find even a virtual penny. 


In the second half of the show, Max talks to author and documentary filmmaker, Greg Palast, about whether it is peak oil or oil dictatorships that is the bigger threat to the global economy.

The Greg Palast interview was a very good exchange. Palast focused on the politics of petroleum. Max focused on the economics of petroleum. Those are two very different topics, which means that a lot of the disagreement you seemed to hear was really the two talking past each other. They both agree that the petroleum industry is a problem, but their respective emphases leads them to focus on different solutions.

Palast views the theory of Peak Oil to be irrelevant to the politics of petroleum, and heâ€™s right. "The price of Oil is not in anyway today effected by supply..."  That does not mean that he denies Peak Oil (which he may, he just didnâ€™t do so in this interview).

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
