,Strikefear13,2011-02-18T01:47Z,You uploaded it wrong..  It's blank and saves to nowhere.
,CaptainMorgenstern,2011-02-18T16:42Z,Can anyone confirm this is real and working?
,Strikefear13,2011-02-18T19:15Z,It isn't.  You can't even download it.  Main link doesn't work and magnet link provides a blank download.  Can someone upload a WORKING copy? I can't seem to find this anywhere.  Kinda surprised it isn't up already considering the series' popularity x_x

,gjc174,2011-02-24T03:37Z,Downloading the torrent doesn't work but the magnet link does. Files are blank but when completed there is one file Dragon Quest VI Realms of Revelation (USA).rar. Confirmed the patch version works on a R4i clone.
,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2011-02-28T04:56Z,"See above comments stating failure to properly upload torrent. =/ Such'a shame too. However they are correct. This torrent is false.

,Coren,2011-03-21T10:40Z,"Torrent's fine, just gotta use the magnet link.  Got the same files as the other one, just rared up."
,leor0111,2011-06-11T08:45Z,... i don't think an empety torrent even CAN take to long to download. so i keep my hopes up till after that.
