Plot Summary
When timid eleventh-grader and math genius Kenji
Koiso is asked by older student and secret crush
Natsuki to come with her to her familyâ€™s Nagano
home for a summer job, he agrees without hesitation.
Natsukiâ€™s family, the Jinnouchi clan, dates back to the
Muromachi era, and theyâ€™ve all come together to celebrate
the 90th birthday of the spunky matriarch of the family, Sakae.
Thatâ€™s when Kenji discovers his â€œsummer jobâ€ is to pretend to be
Natsukiâ€™s fiancÃ© and dance with her at the birthday celebration.
As Kenji attempts to keep up with Natsukiâ€™s act around her family,
he receives a strange math problem on his cell phone which,
being a math genius, he canâ€™t resist solving. As it turns out, the
solution to the mysterious equation causes a hijacking of the
social networking site through which most of the world's social and business traffic flows.
