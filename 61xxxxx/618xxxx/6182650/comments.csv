[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:13Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. 

Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. 

The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. 

Just download any 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. 

I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted.

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads."

Also it will help in ignoring negative details.

,britchesNtoes,2011-08-10T01:21Z,"Maybe it's just because I'm a novice, but for some reason the third in the series plays on my AVS program, but the first and second movies do not. I get an error saying there is no file extension. I tried to add .avi to the end, but it doesn't take. Sucks asss..."

V: 9
S: 10
M: 9, there are like 6 movies here bc they are all the extended ones, which is cool, but the titles and stuff are in Spanish I think.  It's not a big concern of mine and doesn't detract from the movies really, but it is annoying. "
,tomonti,2012-02-18T02:05Z,"This torrent works...BUT there IS a problem.
The filenames are too long, windows cant cope with it, so VLC (et al) cant play it.  Worse windows cant access or rename the file & it has no properties.  THE CURE: you have to go to Dos and use the REN(rename) command in combination of the wildcard * to rename it to something sane.
