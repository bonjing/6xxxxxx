Accidentially deleted my old post of this when I was trying to delete #2 :) So here it is again.


Here you go, Spirou 1 (or 34 if you prefer the french release order), one of the best french comics for all ages, I rate this higher Asterix and Lucky Luke.

Spirou and Fantasios friend, the Count of Champignac, asks them to join him in Australia, where he has heard that an ancient monolith is still standing. When they arrive, Champignacs colleague Walker Donahue informs them that Champignac has been abducted by local gangster Sam. The monolith theyre after stands in the vicinity of an aboriginal mining village, which is constantly prey to white prospectors trying to steal indigenous resources.

Spirou and Fantasio must save Champignac from Sams clutches and help him find the legendary monolith while standing by the aboriginal people.
