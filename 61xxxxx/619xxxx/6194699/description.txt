Just when you thought youâ€™d accepted your own mortality . . . Everything Is Going to Kill Everybody is bringing panic back. Twenty illustrated, hilariously fear-inducing essays reveal the chilling and very real experiments, dangerous emerging technologies, and terrifying natural disasters that soon couldâ€”or very nearly already didâ€”bring about the end of humanity. In short, everything in here will kill you and everyone you love. At any moment. And nobodyâ€™s told you about itâ€”until now:
Experiments in green energy like the HiPER, which uses massive lasers to create a tiny â€œcontainedâ€ sun; itâ€™s an idea that could save the world if it doesnâ€™t consume us all in a fiery fusion reaction first. 
Global disasters like the hypercaneâ€”a hurricane so large it could cover all of North America and shoot trailer parks into space!
Terrifying new developments in robotics like the EATR, which powers itself on meatâ€”an invention in the running for â€œWorst Decision Made by Anybody.â€.................
