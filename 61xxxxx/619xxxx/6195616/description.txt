Description
As Tupacâ€™s interviewer announces, â€œTupac, this interview is not about your trial, or your court appealsâ€”it is about Tupac, the inner man, then, and now.â€

Featuring an uncut and never-before-seen interview at the Clinton Correctional Facility, TUPAC SHAKUR UNCENSORED AND UNCUT: THE LOST PRISON TAPES presents a raw look into Tupacâ€™s world, as the rapper riffs on topics ranging from his involvement with gang life to prisons in America to his relationship with his mother. What emerges is a moving self-portrait of an artist who sees himself as fundamentally misunderstood: He may have diagnosed thug life, but he didnâ€™t invent it, and he is determined to upliftâ€”not destroyâ€”the black community.

Capturing the intensity and passion of a fierce talent, TUPAC SHAKUR UNCENSORED AND UNCUT: THE LOST PRISON TAPES offers a glimpse inside the mind of the enigmatic artist whose music is, in his own words, â€œall about life.â€
