This is the third torrent I have made using an almost complete collection of CDG files in our member community. The first effort was a wash, while the second seemed to work well. After sharing the second torrent for a while, I thought it would be alright to remove my copy, and leave the sharing to you, so that I could go on to do other things. I never did do anything else, and you still wanted my copy of this torrent. Today I have decided to re-create the torrent and share it again. This time I will try to leave it on indefinitely. By now, I am sure there are more available than the ones contained in this torrent, but for those who want a great start for your karaoke collection, this is it. Enjoy!
