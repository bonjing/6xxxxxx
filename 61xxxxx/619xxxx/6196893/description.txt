Hotel Paper is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Michelle Branch which was released on June 24, 2003.

Some of the major themes on Hotel Paper are leaving things behind, constantly being on the move, independence, the mysteries of bus stations and spirituality.[2] The album's cover is a photograph of Branch by Sheryl Nields.

Hotel Paper debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 157,000 copies in its first weekâ€”it was Branch's highest sales week and surpassed the peak position of her previous major label album, The Spirit Room (2001).[3] By December 2003, Hotel Paper was certified platinum by the RIAA.[4] The album had sold 1,116,000 copies in the U.S. as of March 2009.[5] Hotel Paper was certified gold in Canada for shipment of 50,000 copies.[6]

It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Branch's third nomination. The second single was "Breathe", which reached number thirty-six on the Hot 100 and became a top five club hit.
