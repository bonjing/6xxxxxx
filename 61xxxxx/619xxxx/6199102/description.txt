Crackfix Information
=====================

Skidrow's quick  and poor approach  at  making a  crack for  this  game  has
resulted in crashes for many  people. This is due to  their memory  patching
only working with an older version of xlive.dll. Their crack only works with
the GFWL client shipped with the game. Obviously to produce a proper  before
we  had  noticed our error  and had time to finish our  crackfix they didn't
think about future versions of xlive working with their crack. An update was
already out,  v3.4.18.0 of  the xlive.dll  and Skidrow's crack  is  redemeed
useless already and crashes for people with that build.  Eventually everyone
will experience this crash once they do update their GFWL client as its used
system wide, not just on this game... and we doubt they keep updating  their
crack for each new GFWL version that comes out in the years  to  come.  Even
if that is the case we don't think you want to wait for  them to do so  each
time. It would be  more or less like  them releaseing a  new version of  the
crack each  time the Steam client was updated

We also don't accept other groups nuking for false reasons. This is  related
to their  claim that  our release is  corrupting  the saved  games. This  is
completely untrue and  just  thrown  in  there  to  make their  proper  seem
justifiable. What you in Skidrow may have encounterd is the  fact  that  our
saves use a  different Xuid and  aren't  encrypted  using  GFWL. Hence  they
disappeared from when playing with GFWL

Here is our crackfix, as  it now enables all settings (video settings worked
before, this is why we missed this in our first crack) to be saved and works
no  matter what  version of  GFWL you have  installed  and will  never  stop
working because of GFWL updates. Also note that if  you  used  our  previous
crack your savegames will still work with this one

Installation Information
========================

If you only installed our previous  release  and  not  the  other  group's
crackfix (did you  need  it  anyways?), just copy over our fixed xlive.dll
to your existing BinariesWin32 game folder. Now your done

If you replaced  our  release, or  parts  of  it  already  with  mentioned
crashing crack, uninstall  it  first (unless you kept backups) and  repeat
the instructions given in  our  main  release.  Finally, copy/replace  the
xlive.dll from this crackfix to the BinariesWin32 game folder as  before

Enjoy a fully working release now without any worries of getting in a bind
with future G4WL updates
