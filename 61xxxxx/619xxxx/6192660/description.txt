"Chuck Versus The Masquerade" 

Valentine's Day is interrupted when Chuck 
(Zachary Levi) and the team are sent on a 
mission to England to protect a reclusive 
young heiress, Vivian McArthur (guest star 
Lauren Cohan). Meanwhile, Casey (Adam 
Baldwin) gets an offer from the mysterious 
Jane Bentley (guest star Robin Givens). 
Back at home, Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) and 
Awesome (Ryan McPartlin) find an unlikely 
solution to a parenting problem, as Morgan 
(Joshua Gomez) ponders a big move.

Enjoy :)
