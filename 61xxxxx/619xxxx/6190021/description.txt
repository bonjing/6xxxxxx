Image Icon Converter helps you edit digital images into icons, and also does the reverse, transferring icons into digital images. A step-by-step wizard walks you through the process. You can create icons as small as 16x16 pixels or as large as 128x128 pixels, with color depth ranging from 16 bit to 32 bit. The program supports a wide range of file formats, including BMP, JPEG, GIF, PNG, TGA, TIFF, and PCX, and also can use screenshot images. An image editor contains most of the basic functions, such as rotate, crop and flip, as well as basic image effects such as color balance, brightness, contrast, sharpen, and soften.

Overall, this basic program is a solid bet for beginner icon designers.
