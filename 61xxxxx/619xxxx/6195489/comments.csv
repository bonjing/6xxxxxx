,loosegun,2011-03-03T22:36Z,how come most of u guys do not upload anything with subtitles???? it will b very helpful for guys with limited spoken american english knowledge. Please consider
,bAbYgIrL302010,2011-03-16T22:08Z,"Ok again Raymond thanks for the download, it's downloading right now. I don't give a damn what people complain about from your uploads but I think your the shit!! Thanks for all of your awesome torrents!! BTW I don't care if your movies have subtitles or not your downloads still are the BEST!! Thanks again! :)"
,bAbYgIrL302010,2011-03-16T22:11Z,"Hey Raymond just wanted 2 tell u which I'm sure u already know, your the best!! All of your downloads are awesome!! I see that some people complain, like I always say don't complain when this is free!! U can't beat free! To the guy complaining about not having sub titles- oops oh well, atleast the downloads are always great and the sound quality is the best!! Thanks again Raymond!! :)"
,loosegun,2011-03-20T08:19Z,Hi bAbYgIrL302010! Pls read my msg more clearly. I am not complaining but requesting fr subtitles as the uploader is taking so much pain to u/l n if there are subtitles added it wl make the u/l more full.  As for raymondhome I do acknowledge and accept he is the best as I have d/l most of his uploads and I am ever  thankful to him for his hard work which I am sure am not up to it.
