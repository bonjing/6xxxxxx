        A heart-warming story  that all ages  will enjoy, inspired  by
        the off-Broadway play, a preacher's daughter, Arama (Ciara) on
        the  verge of  pop stardom,  is launched  into the  limelight.
        After the death  of her father,  stronger family bonds  ensue,
        and her love  for pop music  collides with her  loyalty to the
        church. When tragedy strikes again, Amara and her mother  must
        work through their differences.
