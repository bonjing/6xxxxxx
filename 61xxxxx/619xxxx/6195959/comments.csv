I install as instructed (with internet disabled) and have tried the crack several ways, automated 2 and manual on my 64bit pc but when i try and launch the program I am asked for an email and registration number. if I close this window the program opens (unregistered edition) but will only let me convert 3 mins of files? one thing that may help is that when i open your crack it opens in winzip but I can still find the unzipped temp file to copy/drag to the program folder. Automated 2 just says 'job done'. Any help will be appreciated and keep up the good work."
[V],ChattChitto,2011-02-23T13:44Z,"Why don't you try Automated Cracking 1 (x64) ?
If that didn't help in Automated Cracking 2, when you click on it Browse to the Installation folder of the application and select its main folder as target. It shall do the Job for you.
In case that even didn't help which it should as It's tested...
Click on the Manual Crack button and you will see two files, select both and drag them to the application installation folder, replace original files. :)"
,Grifter71,2011-02-23T16:07Z,Thanks for the quick reply. i think the problem was that it was opening in WinZip for some reason. anyway all done and working. great stuff. thanks again.

,rock2011,2011-03-06T11:51Z,"yet again, another great upload from you!! Thx alot dude, just converting a file now from 900mb to 350mb, nice!!!"
,va7kpt,2011-04-10T05:54Z,"i've installed it, and gotten to the point that it doesnt say ""un-registered"" in the corner. I open it, and in about 10 seconds it closes why?"
,algy1415,2011-04-11T13:55Z,Hey chattchitto. Thanks for this. Could you advise please. When I double click the exe it flashes what appears to be a dos window then closes almost instantly. I'm obviously doing something wrong but don't know what. Would appreciate any advice.
,makinho7,2011-04-19T14:52Z,"thank you, exellent"
,DarkRedoSin,2011-05-02T18:39Z,"Thanks.The automated cracking didn't work for me so I just did it the standard way-copy + paste files into the folder and works perfectly.I just wish you could create your own videos with images and add audio to them and then convert that into a video,now that would make this an Ultimate Converter!"
,sobber11,2011-05-24T07:49Z,"Thank you ChattChitto, excellent work as usual!!  One of the best software provider here and nice choice of music also..hahahaha!  Thank you!!"
,InstantStarFan7,2011-07-26T03:59Z,"I have tried so many different DRM Video removers and this program works great. It opened Itunes and recorded the video and then encoded it or whatever, but when I play it on the laptop or on the PS3 (Which is the setting I encoded it with), there is sound in the beginning which sounds like slow mode man voices, then there is no sound at all after about 1 minute. The video skips and lags.. Does anyone know what the problem is? 

Thank you ChattChitto for the upload though!"

,Censeeni,2011-08-18T21:46Z,"Hi CC I am having a problem with this program tho. I install as instructed (with internet disabled) and have tried the crack several ways, automated 2 and manual on my 64bit pc but when i try to launch the program I am asked for an email and registration number. if I close this window the program opens (unregistered edition)  another problem is that when i open your unzipped crack in the program folder, it does not  open but rather gives me this message: 

This application has failed to start because COMsupport.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem. I've tried re-installing but still get the same message.  

I've also tried all the automated cracks only for it to tell me 'job done'. But when i click on the unzzipped cracked again i still get the same message as before. Any help will be much appreciated and keep up the good work."
,Censeeni,2011-08-19T15:17Z,"CC please don't bother replying to my problem because your job done is really indeed a ""WELL JOB DONE"" My problem has been solved. Thanks a lot and keep up the good works. Bless You."
