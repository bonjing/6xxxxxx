,argkos155,2011-02-22T23:26Z,"Is this actually still used? If so, what is it's main purpose?"
,Valera__,2011-02-23T06:50Z,"People, please, seed this torrent! Only  2 Kb/s for  last 8 hours."
,ziggi1000,2011-05-04T05:06Z,Is this OS working in Intel ?
,go2low,2011-05-16T10:15Z,"Hey guys, this one is working perfectly, but you'll need the IRIX 6.5 Base too, as waldemar72 descriped for a full Installation bundle. I put it on my Octane2. Wonderfull, thx to Waldemar you are the best. I was wondering if you or anybody could seed the flame9515IRIX again, or just the Stone-Lic folder, because I already got the Paradox version but without the Stone-Lic.. that would be great !!! ;-)"
,waldemar72,2011-06-20T23:07Z,"Hi everybody!
As you can see I've uploded some useful (I hope) IRIX related torrents. If you have any other (working) IRIX soft - please upload!! Now I also have MSC Patran 2006r1 for IRIX, but did't manage to run it. Any CAD/CAM software is welcome (Catia or Pro/Engineer 2.0 Wildfire for example), Foundry Nuke, Adobe Framemaker 5.5.6, Nichiman Mirai, Liberty Paint, TvPaint 3.6, Toonz, etc. 
Now i'm looking for Barco Creator 7.2. I had it but lost. There is torrent but 0 seeders. I've found it also via emule but again.. 0 seeders. "
,letrvic,2011-07-27T02:10Z,"I hope everything is allright now my friend :) 
And thank you for the torrents you shared ...
Can you be more specific why you couldn't install Patran.
I didn't try it myself ... yet .
Thank you again.
Long Live Irix! (LLI)"
,waldemar72,2011-08-15T22:26Z,"HI letrvic!
Is that you who shared Barco Creator 7.2  on emule? If so - thank you very much!! Now I have Barco up and running.
By the way I've also managed to install and run (i.e. working license) IRIX versions:
MSC Patran 2006r1
ICEM Surf 4.5
Chemical Group MOE 2010
Tecplot 360 v2006 r2
Mathematica 5.2
Houdini Master 6.5.67
Hampson Russell CE8 r4.3
Chimera (free chemical soft)

If you wish - I can share it.
Just downoladed via emule (a few week waiting): 
CEI Ensight 8.2 Gold - installed but did not managed to work yet  
Tripos Sybyl 7.2 - installs on IRIX but licence improper 
(now I'm downloading v7.3)
Long live IRIX! Never die!"
,slightev,2011-08-28T19:46Z,"waldemar72, I can never seem to download stuff from emule, would you mind torrenting some of the stuff you listed--especially Mathematica which I've wanted for years!"
,oldshield,2011-09-25T08:59Z,"hate to ask, but what do I use to extract a .image to burn them to a cd?
I have some older IRIX 5.1 and 5.3 with development cd's. I could torrent them if anyone is interested?"
,oldshield,2011-09-25T10:01Z,"I guess you used dd to do these .images?

Can you re-post as .iso files also, more than happy tp torrent this for a long time.

need the .iso please"
,frogski,2012-02-14T23:12Z,Can someone please add everything needed into one torrent? Thanks in advance
,skysearcher,2012-04-20T10:32Z,"Hi all, can someone please seed the complete IRIX 6.5.30 package? Foundation 1 and 2 and many other discs are not available."
,letrvic,2012-05-15T08:46Z,"Hi,
nice list waldemar
i didn't find a icem surf 4.5 irix version but a 2 cd's download ... i'm wondering if the irix mips version is in it .
Maybe you can confirm or point me to the right direction :)
There is an interesting file on emule .. i just downloaded ... i just wanted to inform of it's importance ..
IRIX 6.5.17 src.tar.bz2 ... it contains the source code for the 6.5.17 release and most surprinsing the source code for the sgi boards proms .. that is something !!!
if you're a sgi fan don't miss it !!!
about new torrents for the irix ... i don't think torrents are so safe anymore ... "
