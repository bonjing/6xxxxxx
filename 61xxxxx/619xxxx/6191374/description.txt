Last and final version of this wonderful unix system for silicon graphics machines!
A must have! Ready to use images for burn for example in Nero. It enables installing Irix 6.5.30 on blank disk. You must remember you also need Foundation 1 and 2 disks and maybe ONC/NFS, Developement Libraries and Developement Foundation disk (they may be found on TPB). Have fun.
