,vivatpb5776,2011-04-03T05:06Z,The quality is excellent and I am glad that I found a higher quality version of this series. Thank you uploader. 
,mubanga1,2011-06-02T14:42Z,unlike season 1 and 2 this one has a little bit more grain in the vid and isn't in wide screen. also the subtitles are english for the deaf. just so you know. But still an awesome season and very watchable. nice work
,c3bhm,2011-06-06T09:52Z,"Crappy.  Twice the file size of other options, yet very grainy AND NON-WIDESCREEN.  F*** THIS.  I did side-by-side comparisons and this is NOT HQ or HD or any better than the other torrents.  What a total FAILURE of a rip..."
,rock55,2011-06-09T08:39Z,superb upload.three cheers and many thanx .works perfectly 10/10.
,zardoz78,2011-07-05T01:41Z,"This is not x264, it is WebM.  And it is 4:3 aspect, not 16:9.
-1"
,zardoz78,2011-07-05T01:45Z,"I take back the WebM stuff, it is x264 (Showtime player must have mistaken). And 4:3 is normal for a 2004 season.  Sorry."
,foomonger,2011-09-03T19:38Z,"Season 1 and 2 are widescreen, somehow this is not. The 2004 excuse does not wash."
[V],meech,2011-09-10T15:45Z,"""Somehow these are not?"" Do you think I would go ahead and crop the picture myself?  The dvd's for the seasons in my torrents lacking widescreen, are not widescreen. Join Netflix, order these dvds and see for yourself.  If you've seen them in widescreen elsewhere, then they weren't from the American dvds.  I can't do any more than my source for dvds provide.

And to people who are complaining about the grain...once again, order the dvds.  I didn't add the grain myself.  In fact, the dvds are even grainier. I ran these through a weak denoise filter.  If you take out too much of the grain, you lose detail.  If you'd rather get the 350mb mp3 xvid crap, no one is stopping you."
,xseyss,2011-09-25T04:18Z,"thanks for these torrents, meech
I love the shield since day one. still watch one every day when having dinner :)
I watched like 15 times every episode. just love this fucking series"
,Daemon6,2012-01-14T00:20Z,"Thanks alot meech .. you're a great uploader. I've been watching quantum leap and was surpised about the good quality, was glad to see you also uploaded the shield. And subtitles also .. usually I have to search them myself :)"
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-03-26T22:07Z,"Season 3 is definitely grainier then the first 2 seasons, but I blame Hollywood for releasing low standard dvds. My Tour of Duty dvds are just as grainy. I definitely will not be buying The Shield dvds, unless of course they remaster and come out with way better ones. Thanks for the uploads! "
,PandaMD,2012-04-12T02:56Z,Please seed!!! The DL is incredibly SLOW rt now!! PLS SEED!!!
,dududus,2012-05-17T15:50Z,Only in America do 4:3 DVDs still reign... what a sad way to ruin an otherwise perfect series/torrent.
,dududus,2012-05-18T17:43Z,"WARNING: SHITTY AMERICAN 4:3 , non-widescreen, thick black bars on both sides of the screen... unforgivable! You are missing out a lot if you settle for this low quality rip.

Get this instead:

,dududus,2012-05-18T17:50Z,"Avoid this.. uploader got bad source.. very ugly, barely watchable due to him not getting the widescreen version.

If you're going to spend 10 hours watching, you may as well get the proper, not truncated version."
