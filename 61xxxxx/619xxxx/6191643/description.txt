AshampooÂ® UnInstaller 3 Version 3.13

New user interface â€“ easier to use than ever before
The brand-new Ashampoo UnInstaller 3 is packed with new modules and features, but the most striking change is the completely new user interface. Itâ€™s attractive and modern and it makes the program faster, easier and more fun to use than ever before. Everything is easy to find and he program guides you through all operations, with clear explanations on every step of the way.

Most users will never have to consult the help â€“ all the information you need is displayed in the program itself where you need it and when you need it. 
Four new Windows maintenance tools
In addition to uninstalling programs, Ashampoo UnInstaller 3 now comes with over a dozen easy-to-use tools for keeping your Windows system clean and snappy. The following four tools are new: 
Manage Restore Points
 
Windows XP and later can create backups called â€œrestore pointsâ€ that enable you to return your system to a previous state without losing any personal data (text documents, email messages, browser history and so on). This new tool makes using restore points easy. You can switch automatic restore points on and off, create restore points manually and load restore points to return your system to an earlier state. 
Defragment Hard Drives
 
Keeping your hard drive defragmented speeds up Windows and can help to prevent errors. This new module uses Ashampooâ€™s widely-praised defragmentation technology to keep your drives tidy so they deliver maximum performance. Itâ€™s fast, reliable and easy to use. Just select the drive and go, and you can interrupt or abort the process safely at any time. 
Registry Cleaner
 
The Registry is the database where Windows and application programs store most of their settings. This is one of the main places where junk from partially-uninstalled programs collects and clogs up your system. The Registry Cleaner finds and deletes this garbage, including the junk left by programs removed before you started using Ashampoo UnInstaller. 
Check Installed Programs Entries
 
Sometimes you will find entries for programs that no longer exist in Add/Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel. This new module finds and allows you to delete these orphaned entries, including the ones that are not even displayed but are still wasting space and resources on your system. 
Other new functions and improvements
In addition to all the improvements in the main program functions several of the other tools have also been updated: 
Internet Cleaner
 
This tool deletes all traces of your browsing activities and your browserâ€™s temporary Internet files (copies of everything you have viewed online). You can also view and delete cookies (little data files for tracking and settings) that sites you have visited have stored on your hard drive. The new version now supports Firefox as well as Internet Explorer and finds more browsing data. 
No more Easy/Expert mode switch
 
The program is now so user-friendly that there is no more need to switch between beginnersâ€™ and expertsâ€™ modes. Experienced users still have full access to all the powerful functions they need. 
Manage Fonts
 
By popular demand the Manage Fonts tool that was removed in version 2 has been reinstated. You can view all the fonts installed on your system along with all the specifications information for each font and remove any fonts you no longer need. 
Step-by-Step Assistant update
 
The popular Step-by-Step assistant that guides you through installing and uninstalling programs has been updated and is now even easier to use. 
Standard features and functions
Of course the new version also includes everything that has made Ashampoo UnInstaller so popular with savvy Windows users ever since the first version: 
Installation Monitor
 
A taskbar program that automatically activates when you install a new program and logs the installation so that you can remove it completely with Ashampoo UnInstaller later. 
Reinstaller
 
Changed your mind about removing a program? The Reinstaller restores the removed installation in seconds â€“ you donâ€™t have to waste your time going through the entire complex installation procedure again. 
Drag & Drop Desktop Uninstaller
 
Get rid of programs fast by dragging them onto the UnInstaller icon on the deskop. Great for programs you were just testing. 
Windows management tools
 
In addition to the four new tools, Ashampoo UnInstaller 3 also comes with Internet Cleaner, Find/Delete Duplicate Files, Find/Delete Temporary Files, Find/Delete Empty Folders, Start Menu Cleaner (locate invalid entries in the Windows Start menu), Manage Windows Services (display, activate and deactivate Windows services), Manage Internet Explorer Add-Ons and File Backup (make backups of files and folders). 
Monitor program activity
 
In addition to uninstalling programs you can also use Ashampoo UnInstaller to find out what programs have been doing on your computer. Take a snapshot before doing something and another one afterwards and UnInstaller will show you all the registry entries, files, file changes and other changes made by the program between the two points.
