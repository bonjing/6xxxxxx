Ok, first of all, THANK YOU TO SERENiTY for their TRUEFRENCH TS rip! This was a wonderful starting point. Also thank you to MYSTiC for supplying the Audio portion. 

Alot of work went into this copy. It was Red heavy and had some video noise issues. I did alot of work cleaning up the colors, adjusting Contrast/Gamma/Luminance. Lots of Video Noise reduction and sharpening. Overall, this is a great copy until a DVD is out, which should be soon. Enjoy and SEED SEED SEED!

ALSO: FOR THOSE THAT ASKED IN MY PREVIOUS TORRENTS - I INCLUDED MORE SCREENS AND A VIDEO SAMPLE IN THE TORRENT. (Thanks to downloader979 for the suggestion, VideoEditMaster worked like a charm! )
