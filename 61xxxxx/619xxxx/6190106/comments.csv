,bfpg8989,2011-02-21T01:55Z,i agree 
,[ENC]ode[001],2011-02-21T03:26Z,you guys have obviously seen the sample lol
,moshster,2011-02-21T13:45Z,sh1t in = sh1t out
,HalcyonJedi,2011-02-22T03:49Z,"I appreicate the effort [ENC], but this is a movie that just has to be seen in as much clarity as possible to truly appreciate it - the bluray release is April 5th, I can't believe there isn't a better source for this yet... "
,sherman22,2011-02-23T00:57Z,what the fuck... dont you know this movies came out a long time ago when is a dvdrip coming out
,User897,2011-02-24T04:16Z,"Yet another piece of shit.  Shit in, shit out, no matter how you try to polish it.

I can't believe nothing better has come out for this yet.  I mean fuck, we have an R5 of that shit movie Sanctum already!

Has Disney clamped down so hard that not ONE single decent quality release can exist?  Fuck!"
,User897,2011-02-24T06:34Z,"And by the way [ENC]ode[001], fix your fucking imageshack links!  Firefox does not accept them!"
,[ENC]ode[001],2011-02-25T19:18Z,User897 do you not know how to copy and paste? or is ur lack of contributions to the P2P community based on ignorance rather than laziness? Just another USELESS LEECHER
,[ENC]ode[001],2011-02-28T21:05Z,new final version coming soon..got ahold of a good ppv version that needed just a little love. This next release will be the FINAL until DVDRip is out.
