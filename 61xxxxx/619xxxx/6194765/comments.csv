[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T16:08Z,"There's nothing wrong with any of my uploads. Icekool666 has put this comment on all of my uploads. Ignore him. Feel free to check on my other torrents to see. There is nothing wrong with this at all. He's just a sad little boy who wants to discourage uploaders. He's not done any of his own of course, he's just a leech trying to prevent people like me sharing quality downloads with the world."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:10Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. 

Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. 

The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. 

Just download any 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. 

I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted.

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads."

,.BlackIce,2011-04-09T19:39Z,"Thanks Toilet Sniffer, very nice quality.  V: 10  A: 9  M: 10"
,losinal,2011-04-17T02:48Z,"The quality and audio is good, but the voices are all fast forwarded and I can't understand anything that the people are saying. What's up with this?"
,losinal,2011-04-17T02:52Z,"Ok, please ignore my previous comment, headphone problem, not voice problem."
,cbzee,2011-04-28T15:49Z,"Have watched everything but the tv movie, good quality, thanks for the upload."
,abhikrit,2011-07-11T12:17Z,this is nothing but a new torrent of JASON BOURNE COLLECTION axxo. He just changed the file names.
,chitchatid,2011-10-08T23:10Z,"you should not matter what the original uploader is. u should thank uploader tsv to collect it and reseed it, though.
