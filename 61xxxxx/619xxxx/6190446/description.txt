"Terry Unmarried"

Cleveland makes two huge discoveries in his 
personal life. First, he finds out that Donna 
never legally divorced her ex-husband, so she and 
Cleveland are not legally married. Then, he 
discovers that his best friend Terry is gay and 
has been dating a guy named Paul (guest voice 
Timberlake). In light of these new developments, 
Cleveland, Donna, Terry and Paul decide to go to 
Vermont and have a double wedding ceremony. 
Meanwhile, Cleveland Jr. tries to help Rallo 
break a nasty habit.

Enjoy :)
