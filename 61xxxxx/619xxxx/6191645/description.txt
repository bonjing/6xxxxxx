"You don't hear a lot of music like Michael Troy's these days, and it's a shame. Cut from the sam cloth as folks like Woody Guthrie to Bob Dylan to Phil Ochs and Bill Staines, Michael has stories to tell. It's a refreshing sound to hear Michael's songs. Whispers In The Wind is his debut CD, and this bold batch of songs makes you eager for the albums to come."

"Piglet sidled up to Pooh from behind. "Pooh?" he whispered. 
"Yes, Piglet?" 
"Nothing," said Piglet, taking Pooh's hand. "I just wanted to be sure of you."
