,highres99,2011-02-22T08:55Z,"thanx 20-40 for everything. if i may ask; please what's your connection speed? reason is: it's very remarkable how u download, encode and upload stuff-just curious. thanx, once again."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-22T10:03Z,"1000 kB/s DL, 56 kB/s UL, crappy, isn't it. But when files are uploaded on seeding servers I can achieve calmly 3 Gb/s of seeding speed."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-22T11:59Z,Hi htctouch.
,qudube,2011-02-22T14:23Z,Thanks for the small upload. . Just wondering why others can't pick up your method! ! just asking. . 
,highres99,2011-02-22T14:59Z,"@20-40: 1000kbps-U/56kbps-D! surely that's not crappy. if i had that DL speed, wow! no telling what i can do. and btw, this upload is not decent like you said........its wonderful!!! to me, decent is something you can manage, but this, this is awesome!!! thanx a trillion times, man. 
R E S P E C T!!!!! any chance of ""UNKNOWN, I AM NUMBER 4""? Thanx!!!"
