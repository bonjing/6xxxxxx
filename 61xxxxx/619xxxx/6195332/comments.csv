[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T16:00Z,"For those interested, this fool tried to install my Windows 7 but he couldn't follow instructions. He's therefore decided to slag off all my downloads. Ignore him. "
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T18:04Z,"It's remarkable how Kryptonite and Icekool666 have both downloaded the same programmes, films and software and both had the exact same problem that the other had but yet no one else has had any problems whatsoever.
It's clearly the same guy. Get a life you sad fool.    "
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T18:07Z,"Kryptonit and Icekool666 are the same person. He's commented on the same torrents, reports the same problems (when there aren't any, why would this have so many seeds if there were genuine problems) and they even share the same IP address. How very sad."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:01Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. Just download 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted. 

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads. "

,dumbstrd,2011-06-21T11:38Z,"FYI since nobody seems to have the common sense or decency to do so, if you are a REAL movie goer and would find it necessary to understand the very CRUCIAL Italian parts of the film, know that the version of subtitles you need to search for are the ""Greenbud"" rip.  Im not sure if that is right for all 3 but its right for part I for sure so its likely all of these movie files are renamed Greenbud rips(which I found out by matching movie file size).  Dont get the regular English sub as it will not translate the Italian but get the special English sub as it will.  http://subscene.com/english/the-godfather/subtitle-311885.aspx"

,xjd77,2012-01-26T15:59Z,"@ Vauveli 

Don't worry about it. Millions of uploaders so the chances of you being singled out are small. Peer Guardian is designed to ban troublesome peers and doesn't hide your ip address. Also use PG with care because if someone from Africa is on a weak connection then they are going to take days to download files and you may think they are a bad peer. The internet infrastructure in Africa isn't as good as the USA or Europe. Also if you're uploading something for the first time then limit the number of people that can connect to you in your client's preferences menu. When I'm downloading I'll have UTorrent set to 25 or more peers per torrent but if I'm just seeding or uploading then I'll drop that down to 10 or even 5. If you're really worried then buy a USB prepaid dongle with no contract (you can buy a voucher at most newsagents to top them up which lasts a month). Upload with that which keeps your landline connection clean and is perfectly anonymous. If you do receive a letter or phonecall then always deny it and just say you had a short-term lodger (one or three months let) and you gave them access to your landline but they have now left. Change ISP if you get a letter from them. ISPs are in competition so they don't share info and once an ISP acts against you its time to leave that ISP. "

,Senior_Poker,2012-06-21T23:16Z,"Hi Toilet sniffer!
I have been using TPB for about 5 years, but SOMEHOW I have never come across your amazing work. Previously I have only downloaded a few movies, tv shows etc as I am working abroad and want to keep up to date. But I recently moved countries and now find myself with an exceptional DL/UL speed, having come across your work, over then next few months I will be appreciating it far more as I look to build my collection. You are, in my eyes, a real ledgend, a true rebel and I respect and appreciate you. Thank you sooooo much, I was so happy to see Blackadder, the young ones and red dwarf in your UL collection, truly great TV and something every collecter should have. So, Kudos my man, wherever you are, be happy, live long and safe and thank you again :-)"
,Senior_Poker,2012-06-21T23:17Z,"Now, the question is, where do I begin??! Muhahahahaha, 24 I think, looks like it could be a long one, I will seed forever bro! :-)"
,nasicazanova,2012-06-24T12:05Z,very good
