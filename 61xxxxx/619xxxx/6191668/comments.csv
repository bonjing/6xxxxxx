[T],nobody2007,2011-02-21T20:31Z,"sorry, but 50 Tracks in a folder (size ~67MB)?
I dont need songs which are named as Track1, Track 2, ... Track50 ... - Whats the real name of that?
I dont like stuff with suffix wma, wmv, and some more from M$
I dont like Internet Explorer. Sorry, I'm wrong, I hate IE.
I can not accept that should open any file on my PC a browser window automatically.
My favorite browser is not released by Microsoft"
