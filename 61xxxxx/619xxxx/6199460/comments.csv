83 seeders and better quality: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5932659/Inception_%28PSP__iPod__Zune%29

40 seeders and better quality: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5932659/Inception_%28PSP__iPod__Zune

Why would ANYONE download this, when it has no seeders and inferior quality with those others out there????? All one has to do is use the search option!"
,deftones69,2011-02-24T23:52Z,I couldn't agree more with the above poster. this uploader fucking sucks. he only uploads movies that have already been done by holyroses and 3xo. leave the uploads to evol_gamer and 2012x who have stepped up well in 3xo's absence. no one is seeding this donks uploads for a reason because he sucks.
