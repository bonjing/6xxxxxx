Stagecoach (1939) B & W

Director: John Ford

Not just the prototype but the godfather of the modern western. Ford's masterpiece influenced the genre in numerous ways, as well as giving birth to his long-running partnership with John Wayne, surely the most creative director-actor relationship in the history of cinema.

The story follows a stagecoach party travelling from Tonto to Lordsburg filled with a real collection of characters: a prostitute, a drunkard doctor, a pregnant woman, a gambler and a crooked banker. They are joined by escaped convict The Ringo Kid (Wayne) who turns out to be the hero in their midst when he chivalrously and selflessly protects them from the inevitable attack by the Indians, so he gets away with the girl and his freedom at the end, the sheriff conveniently "forgetting" to arrest him.

Stagecoach is unequivocally seminal for several reasons. Ford's characterization has great depth and complexity, and several of the film's characters would be models for many westerns to come. Wayne's laconic loner in particular obviously prefigures some of his more modern counterparts. And in the furiously edited chase sequence Ford clinches the essential epic feel of the western by his dramatic utilisation of the Monument Valley location. Stagecoach basically moved the western up from being a lightweight vehicle to something capable of carrying more serious themes within its stock structure. A masterful film, it remains essential viewing for not only all westerns fans but for anyone interested in cinema. 

Stagecoach has been lauded as one of the most influential films ever made. Orson Welles argued that it was a perfect textbook of film making and claimed to have watched it more than 40 times during the making of Citizen Kane

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
