From the planets to the stars and out to the edge of the unknown, history and science collide in HISTORYâ€™s popular series THE UNIVERSE, now back for its fifth season. With ground-breaking new discoveries and even more stunning high-definition computer animations.

Our Sun has served Earth well for almost five billion years. Itâ€™s bathed us with heat and energy. But like humans, our home star is mortal. In five billion years, it will stop nurturing its planetary offspring. The aging star will bloat out beyond the orbit of our planet incinerating all living thingsâ€“including humans if weâ€™re still around.
