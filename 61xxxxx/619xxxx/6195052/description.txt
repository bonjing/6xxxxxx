Fundamentals of Telecommunications (2DVD) | 2.41 GB


It all starts with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and Plain Ordinary Telephone Service (POTS). We ll begin with the basics of telephony: loops, trunks, circuits, analog, the voiceband... fundamentals that are key to understanding of newer technologies and services.
To complete the picture, we take a practical journey through different types of equipment. We\'ll review switches, PBXs, Centrex, multiplexers and routers, as well as ancillary equipment like ACDs, voice mail and interactive voice response (IVR) systems.
With this framework in place, we\'ll review the telecommunications industry and understand the main players and competitors, how Local Exchange Carriers connect to Inter-Exchange Carriers and how CLECs fit into the picture.

Content of DVD 1:
The topics in this video course - how the telephone system and industry work, provide the essential foundation on which everything else, including digital communications, data circuits and networking are built. 2 hours 22 minutes of career- and productivity-enhancing training! Many people tell us this is training they wish they\'d had years ago.

Content of DVD 2:
In this video course, we drill into the technology a bit, to understand the concepts, standards and technologies for actually transmitting voice calls from one place to another.
We\'ll give you a real understanding of what \"digital\" actually means, and how it is implemented. We ll explain what a \"DS0\" is, and take a practical tour of digital circuits, including T1, T3, SONET and ISDN. At a high level, we\'ll see how voice, data and video can be integrated.
