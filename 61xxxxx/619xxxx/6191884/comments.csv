,CJUeda,2012-06-21T06:52Z,"It works!! it's like the 95% complete versions I find online except this ""Halo Legends"" is ENTIRE thing with a flash back with the covenant 24:14 through 39:00 and it actually ends at the end when the gold elite interrupts the fight between Thel Vadam! Totally worth the 1 gig :D"
