,rocco_sifredi,2011-02-24T07:23Z,"I know it may sound stupid but I wanna ask: is this update let me play online without a serial legit or...what is it for ? I ask that because there is a ..crack ..so it's presumed you don't have a legit copy of game. Appreciated any opinion, thx"
,rocco_sifredi,2011-02-24T09:04Z,"alright , now I got it."
,xidio,2011-02-25T01:09Z,Will this crash your game at startup just like the previous two?
,xidio,2011-02-25T03:03Z,"Oh yeah, crashes on startup just like before.
Fuckin terrible shit.
Vanilla works just fine."
,caspianseez,2011-02-25T20:35Z,"don't listen to xidio. he's an idiot.

this works just fine.
thanks again Alex."
,xidio,2011-02-25T23:10Z,"caspian.
I probably know more than you do when it comes to updates, cracks and pirated copies in general.
No I am not an idiot.

The game does crash on startup when patched to either ""Update 2"" or ""Update 3""
There is no logo on the screen either, you just see the loading icon on the lower right.
One is supposed to see the background too.
But it crashes after about 5 seconds of loading, and the crash report comes up.

Want screenshot? This is incase you are too stupid to read and understand."
,chowpang,2011-02-25T23:27Z,"@xidio

No crashes here. Update 2 worked flawlessly and update 3."
,caspianseez,2011-02-26T02:17Z,"@xidio

we don't need any screenshots.
if you say that it's not working then I believe you. but it's obviously YOUR problem and not a problem with this crack. because this crack works fine.

it works just like the previous 2 worked.
everything submitted by Alexisthebest has worked just fine so far. if it doesn't work for you then it's a problem on your end."
,igorar1,2011-02-26T14:22Z,"Install the update without internet connection, copy crack where the game is installed, and run game but no internet connection is the only way to working game"

,spongebob185,2011-03-07T14:54Z,Hi Alex... I wonder when are you uploading episode 17 of The Mentalist? Thanks mate!
,Ynobe,2011-03-18T08:14Z,OK..So I have to keep d/loading cracks for each update for this game...I have blocked Upupdater but it still does it. Now it has d/loaded update #4 and there doesn't seem to be a crack at the moment...any way around this? I have done a complete reinstall recently..but it still updates automatically. :(
,Remcconen,2011-03-21T14:36Z,Can you upload a proper crack for Update 4?
,Thiemok,2011-09-07T13:03Z,"I'm getting an error, and there is NO FUCKING TEXT IN THAT FUCKING ERROR!"
