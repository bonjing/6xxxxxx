,rombul,2011-02-24T23:28Z,I dunno. I had this in pdf from some other website and just posted it here. I didn't convert it or anything. If you are the author of the original post all credit to you I am not trying to take any of it I was just sharing it =). Thanks bro!

k. sorry for accusing you. It's just i wait for months for this to show up, it doesn't, so i get my own copy, upload it, and within two days theres another one posted. I guess im just paranoid."
