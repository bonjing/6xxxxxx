   Narrated through the two wise kids of the   
   hilariously madcap Parekh family, namely    
   Jacky and Chakki. Khichdi - The movie is    
   about a hare brained dream of a snail braine
   bunch of lovable losers. Hansa's brother    
   Himanshu has born a ridiculous ambition that
   is to have a memorable legendary love story.
   It's all together another matter that he    
   is not in love with anyone and neither is   
   he capable of getting any sensible girl     
   smitten to him.
