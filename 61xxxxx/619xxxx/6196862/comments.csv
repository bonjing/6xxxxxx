but did some lookin


I confirmed two changed scenes, and I will identify them here without giving the specifics, because I donâ€™t think it does viewers any favor to put undue emphasis on whatâ€™s different. The scenes are listed here for those who insist on proof, but for complete confirmation, theyâ€™ll have to do what I did: play the Blu-ray and the DVD side-by-side or one right after the other. The changes are that small. And let me add a word of caution: Just because you think youâ€™re seeing a change, donâ€™t assume your memory is accurate. I checked a lot of other scenes that turned out to be unchanged. It was just that the Blu-rayâ€™s clarity gave me the illusion I was seeing for the first time something that had always been there.

The first of the two re-edited scenes I found occurs at app. 1:04, when Hanna returns from a crime scene to the restaurant where Justine is waiting for him alone. Justineâ€™s speech that begins â€œYou donâ€™t live with meâ€ has been re-edited, using what appears to be different takes, different cuts and a slight modification to the dialogue. What clued me in was simple: The scene had always stuck out as somewhat awkward in an otherwise polished and assured film. On this viewing, it seemed to flow much better than I remembered. A comparison with the DVD revealed why.

The second example occurs at app. 1:18:35, when Hanna is giving the full intimidation treatment to the sleazy Vegas liquor salesman played by Hank Azaria. Hannaâ€™s dialogue has been slightly shortened, without actually shortening the scene. The net effect is to provide an additional moment to display the reaction on Azariaâ€™s face. Itâ€™s priceless. (â€œWho the hell is this lunatic?â€ he seems to be thinking.) "

,CodeX96,2012-04-14T07:48Z,JDownloader is far superior for 1080p X264 films compared to any bittorrent client out there I'm downloading this movie via Jdownloader right now and its gonna take approximately 3 and a half hours to 4 hours max and if i chose to download this torrent it would take a few days to 1 week not that i mind...but overall i have to say that filesharing websites are far superior to torrent trackers u cant rely on torrents for everything lol
