,matoooo,2011-03-08T19:21Z,"Hi there, 
I was wondering if u could help. Tried this new activator, when it starts, it has a green light on however under Serial: it says Warning: Uninstall other cracks.
I cannot choose the Activation option.

I am not aware of any cracks on the windows. 

How to make it run?

Thanks for the help"
