Bell is the coolest person on earth. She dances locally with a small company and is naturally drawn to the stage. She loves to perform, and while she admits to sometimes being typecast by her petite figure, she's quite a versatile model. Her musical tastes are broad, everything from jazz to punk, and she's a car nut. Her taste in exotic automobiles is educated and refined and I totally see her tearing up the track in some red Italian rocket after dancing her way into some famous band's videos.
