,ziggygebs,2011-04-20T19:55Z,"Hey. I downloaded Brave Soul, and, after I mounted with Daemon Tools, I couldn't set it up or install it. DT opens up a window that has a BRAVE_S folder, a ReadMe, and a setup icon (white box with a blue border around the top) but it won't do anything when I click Setup. Same with the Install files, etc in the folder. Please help!"
,Unknown16,2011-04-23T10:57Z,I think this is a definite infinite seed from me. I used to enjoy Hgames' torrents before he/she left. Thank you for the torrent anyway :D
,Kooblukhan,2011-05-01T04:12Z,"so i cant find a no-cd patch for I'm gonna nurse you anywhere.  there is no patch in the download and all my interwebs search skills have failed me...

,cdaja,2011-05-10T01:13Z,Yessss. I'm going to seed this forever.
,slka,2011-05-30T08:43Z,"I'm not very tech orientated but, perhaps you can enlighten me as to why the torrent is only 1.01MiB?

Isn't it kind of small? Weren't the sizes of the h-games larger?

Any information to help me understand would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in Advance ~"
,MasterOuiukiske,2011-06-05T14:00Z,"@Kooblukhan Did you open the folder of the file? As in going into computer and then opening the mounted drive's folder?

@Slka These are just the torrent files for the games... So you download this torrent to get access to the torrent files of the games themselves."
,DomoFan32,2011-08-22T00:05Z,"theres no cd crack for im gonna nurse you and kana little sister dosent even want to install and secret wives club dosent work just black screen
