,jamiedudley,2012-01-16T16:04Z,"I have just taken 2 minutes and according to IMDB there is 6 episodes in the first season but there is only 3 in the torrent, the other two are fine as the second season was actually just made up of two feature length christmas specials but the first season is definitely incomplete"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-04T06:12Z,"No, it's not incomplete. Season 1 had 3 episodes. Season 2 had 3 episodes but when they released the DVD they lumped them in together and called them all season 1. This has every episode ever made. "
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-04T06:14Z,"The first run of three episodes screened on BBC Four from 19 May 2005. A further three episodes were transmitted 20 October â 3 November 2005. The six episodes were repeated on BBC Two in early 2006, and later on BBC America together as a single series. The subsequent DVD release of all six episodes describes the episodes as The Complete First Series.

,Abe_Dracula,2012-04-06T05:17Z,Thanks for the upload. I've been wanting to see this ever since I saw In the Loop. 
,popeye013,2012-04-21T03:12Z,"I nearly shit kittens when i saw the amount of shit you added to the torrent in promo files..
Talk about taking the piss!! 
Made me half inclined to not bother with it, but i just unchecked them, as with most of the actual torrent, i want to see the show, not a promo for fucking TSV!!!!"
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-04-27T02:56Z,"Gotta agree with popeye on the promo files. One or two is understandable, but there are 30 promo files here! Yep, I just unchecked them, too. There are more than twice as many fucking promo files and files for the show!"
,oorenotsoo,2012-05-31T17:35Z,"Thanks for sharing.

I read popeye's comments in Malcolm's voice :P"
