Making Movies is the third album by English rock band Dire Straits, released in 1980.
The title of the album comes from a line in the song "Skateaway" and the unreleased song "Making Movies". Rolling Stone ranked the album #52 in their survey of the "100 Best Albums of the 80s". Making Movies was the biggest selling album in Italy in 1981 with one million copies; in Europe the album sold 3.8 million copies. It was remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the U.S. and on September 19, 2000 in the United States. The songs "Making Movies" and "Suicide Towers" were recorded during the sessions and were never officially released. They do however appear on bootlegs.
