,steve_swv,2011-02-28T21:34Z,Finally a solid Spider-Fan posts some awesome torrents!  I am currently collecting EVERY issue of each main Spider-Man title and reading them in order so some of these collections you've posted will help to fill in some of the holes!  If you're looking for anything specific you don't have shoot me a message because like I said I'm collecting them ALL and have 1000+ issues. THANKS!

If you have anything that seems missing from my torrents let me know :) As far as I know I have all the main stuff, but probably missing some one-shot type stuff.

And if you find any errors, bad files or wrongly tagged in any of my torrents tell me as well."
