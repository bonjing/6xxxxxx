,rezman1984,2011-02-24T13:06Z,his Skull is VIP ofcourse it's Legit.....
,Angerfist_DJ,2011-02-24T19:25Z,"Very fun and nice detailed game.
You must be a fan to really enjoy it.
Buses from different era's 
1920-2020
With vehicles from that specific time.
Not real brand names ofcourse"
,Angerfist_DJ,2011-02-24T19:26Z,"Not to forgot: Trams, subways, (ferry and helicopters)"
,EPDJ,2011-02-25T03:08Z,"You can never be too sure, accounts can get hacked. I would rather be safe than sorry."
,Furrr87,2011-02-25T13:27Z,"Only -600 mb
Nice"
,Neon8742,2011-02-26T01:28Z,"The game is only $19.99 I strongly encourage you to buy this game and support the developers, it's smartly priced and a good value, especially if you love transport games!"
,Voroshilov,2011-02-27T19:33Z,"Already downloading (very quickly indeed!), and will seed ASAP.

If I like it enough I'll buy it online, always thought Paradox deserve it"
,meche89,2011-03-01T21:19Z,"I installed it after that clicked it, nothing happend. 
What's the problem. I have all things that to play game. Thank you. "
,f0lki,2011-03-02T00:18Z,"This game isn't compatible with Intel HD Graphic, and other graphic cards from Intel!"
,Voroshilov,2011-03-04T20:36Z,"As f0lki said I would discourage laptop users with intel graphic cards. I've tried it with an Intel 4 Series express chipset family (1024MB) and the game got stuck when loading any maps plus the menu screen was a bit dodgy...

Still seeding the torrent though :D
"
,dauberbanaan,2011-03-12T13:43Z,"Nearly downloaded it, then saw the system requirements.
No shit this won't work with an integrated graphics card, it has higher system requirements than Crysis or Just Cause 2!"
,Caminyx,2011-03-19T11:13Z,"I have a probelm in the campain scenario ""Vienne se met au vert"" in french, litteraly ""Vienne goes green"" (I don't know if this is it in english version).
Anyway, the first goal is to remove the subway line 1 and to create a new one instead, and it doesn't seem to end the mission when I do as specified in the description... 
Added to this, I am now in 2012, and it has been a while since I haven't be charged of  "
,Caminyx,2011-03-19T11:15Z,*charged of a mission.  I have almost covered the full map... Can anyone tell me if s/he found out how to finish this scenario? :/
,ricoowtjuh,2011-03-26T11:44Z,"Downloaded in 6 minutes, fast torrent, now trying it ;)"
,Gigakos,2011-03-27T18:06Z,sorry to say but it laggs as hell im not able to play at all *uninstall*
,devileyes,2011-03-29T20:47Z,"Somehow I cant get it work. I have installed it few times now, but same error occurs. It cause bluescreen after starting new game."
,jbf19,2011-04-04T03:14Z,"hmm, i mount it and i choose setup but it doesn't run. am i doing something wrong?"
,Wolf87Pta,2011-04-13T15:30Z,Tried it on two different (strong) systems but when I run the game nothing happens... There's a process but nothing shows on screen. Works on my Laptop but lagging like crazy! Just my luck. 
,xdi3hardx,2011-04-29T02:27Z,"For me I think it just took a reaaaally long time for the setup to boot up for some reason... ? Either way try opening the mounted .bin file through ""my computer"" then try selecting the setup icon, run as admin if needed."
,Jeroeny15,2011-05-06T12:45Z,"Pretty nice game, good torrent. I will seed to 1GB."
,ioh969,2011-05-09T19:30Z,"request the 'design classics DLC pack: http://www.citiesinmotion.com/news/2011/4/design-classics-vehicle-pack-dlc-now-available

,MarkoAlmelo,2011-05-16T14:50Z,The game stuck afther the 2 logo's. How to fix?
,kakka66,2011-05-26T01:32Z,"Had to torrnet this game cause it didint have demo. I enjoyed so i bought (15,99âŹ)"
,Jackxon,2011-06-18T20:09Z,"@MarkoAlmelo

Which graphics card do you have?"
,light24bulbs,2011-06-29T08:51Z,It would be really cool if someone knew where a torrent for the DLC was.  Seems like big chunks of this game were released after the fact.  Sure would like to play them. (tokyo)
,LiveLife10,2011-07-08T12:59Z,Is there any chance anyone add it with a Patch? There's already Patch 1.020
,BigUglyMotha,2011-07-24T05:49Z,"Great game, great upload dude ! Any chance you could upload the DLC's and update patchs ? In the meantime thanx again and have a good one man!"
,MrD2DG,2011-08-13T20:20Z,"THANKS! Works great. And for all those asking about DLC, it can be found on demonoid."
,Ririchan,2011-09-15T07:50Z,"The game is currently on sale (-75%) from Steam for $9.99 including 5 DLC packs. I'm not preaching here, but if you like it, I really suggest buying it if you can!"
,aritheory,2011-09-23T12:24Z,"A surprisingly fun, feature-filled game, with a great engine. I was totally taken by surprise. It's well worth buying so if you can afford it, you really should, to reward the developers/producers and to ensure they keep releasing DLC and updates. Did I mention there's no DRM? 1C/Collossal Order are making the big boys look silly!"
,jensdebie1995,2011-09-30T22:42Z,Is there also a torrent with the German cities DLC?
,Pexilico,2011-10-08T23:16Z,I want it for Mac!
,Pexilico,2011-10-09T17:55Z,make it to mac!!
,drnickmd,2012-03-05T18:03Z,Does anyone by chance have the City Growth MOD
