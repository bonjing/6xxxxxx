Elena, a.k.a. Ellie White, is one of the hottest issues of the modern dance scene. Although in her first years of school she studied piano and viola, in the ninth grade she irrevocably fell in love wiki canto. This was the beginning of Elenaâ€™s very serious relationship with music â€“ she started participating in festivals and winning numerous awards and the chance to collaborate with famous producers and radio stations.
In 2003, a famous dance act was looking for a female voice to complete their formula. Although a lot of Romanian artists fought for the spot, Elenaâ€™s powerful voice and charm won them over. She proved to be the ideal piece to complete their musical puzzle. Their success story began in 2003 with the release of â€˜Lumea taâ€™, which had international licensed singles. The album was followed by even bigger successes â€“ â€˜Soapteâ€™ (â€˜Whispersâ€™, 2005, Golden Disc for Sales), â€˜Povestea meaâ€™ (â€˜My Storyâ€™, 2006) and â€˜In the clubâ€™ (2009). Their performance was recognized by some of the most prestigious music awards: MTV MUSIC AWARDS 2006 â€“ Best Romanian Dance, MTV EUROPEAN MUSIC AWARDS 2006 â€“ Best Romanian Act si MTV MUSIC AWARDS 2007 â€“ Best Romanian Dance.
With a name that expresses the antithesis between white and black, between candid and sexy-provocative, Elenaâ€™s first solo single is now one of the hottest radio hits. Even its title, â€˜Nu te mai cautâ€™ â€“ â€˜Not searching for you anymoreâ€™, suggests the fact that she already found her way to success and is very aware of her path in the years to come.
The two songs that introduced this single were a true challenge for club music lovers, creating a huge expectation level. â€˜Nu te mai cautâ€™ is produced by Play & Win, an international success themselves and the producers of famous Romanian artists. The surprises that this chameleonic artist has to offer are nowhere near their ending, as she is now preparing a new material.
