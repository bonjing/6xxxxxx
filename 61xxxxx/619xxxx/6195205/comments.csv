- why hardcode subtitles? This is the stupidest idea in making a rip!!! NEVER hardcode/burn subtitle in a video. People who do not want the subs can't turn them off."

- That is the beauty of the relname/nfo since it will tell you what it is before you download. But sure, if you took a look on my upĂÂ´s it's been soft subs since late march. Then again, if it's not ingratitude for hardcoding it's for not hardcoding subtitles.... Leechers are a rare breed :) Thanks for the caps lock and exclamation marks, have a nice day :)"
