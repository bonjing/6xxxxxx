,Mutegrill,2011-08-23T22:53Z,"Mr Bobnjeff and Mr Insinuendo:

Stop fuzzing boys! I analyzed both your uploads, and the truth is it is very hard to see any difference by eye only, even when zooming in on singel pictures. There is a SLIGHT difference in picture, hardly noticable. And the winner is...IĂÂ´m not gonna tell you, because the difference is a fart in space.

Accept it; your are both equals, and VERY good at what you do! 

Shake hands now boys :-)

Ps. I always try to favour the ones with preview pics, as in your case. But I personally would be even more delighted if you would give us preview clips. As well!

Thanks for your uploads!"
