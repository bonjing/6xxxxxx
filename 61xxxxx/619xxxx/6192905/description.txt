Finally, a MASH release without canned laughter. Ripped by me personally in high quality h.264, these episodes come straight from the UK DVD box set.


Watch using VLC, or any other media player that supports MKV/h.264 (all the decent codec packs support it).

So far the first five seasons are up, 6 will be up once this one has enough seeds and 7 is ripped but untested. I'm watching the episodes before I upload them to check for quality, so I can guarantee that everything I upload is glitch free.

***PLEASE***

Seed for as long as you can, and always make sure you seed what you leech. These are big uploads, and I can't seed them all at once!
