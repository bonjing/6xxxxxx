The NHL and HBO Sports announced Thursday their partnership for a groundbreaking, four-episode series as part of the network's 12-time Emmy Award-winning "24/7" reality TV franchise that will go deep into the inner workings of the Capitals-Penguins rivalry leading up to the 2011 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic, which will be played Jan. 1 at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.

HBO Sports' cameras will have unprecedented access to film "24/7 Penguins/Capitals Road to the Winter Classic." It's the first time HBO Sports will divide its cameras between two teams and also the first time the network will document teams in the middle of their regular seasons.

Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin are known for holding nothing back on the ice. Come December, when HBO's cameras start rolling and the two superstar captains take leading roles in a real-life documentary about the NHL's best present-day rivalry, the world will find out how "The Kid" and "Ovi" prepare to go all out.
