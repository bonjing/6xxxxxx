,tedzone,2011-02-27T00:05Z,"It's crazy no one explain how to use this game ! All I get is a game that seems o be an online game. Why dont they even bother to tell use in their .nfo file how to make this work ! I dont want an online game, if Bulletstorm is something that can be only played online Im not interested. Do we need to download and create a game live account and download account?? can anyone explain how to use the solo offline mode??? I'v been reading many comments I'm not the only one that doesnt know how to use this game offline. can anyone create a real .NFO file for non gamers !? what about all those crack torrents? thats a real mess.."
,JImTy,2011-02-27T18:35Z,"After I run the Setup.exe and everything else, the game refuses to start up. Am I supposed to go back and delete the files that I put in to reach the Setup.exe part to get it to work, or is there something else I'm supposed to do?"
,JImTy,2011-02-27T21:47Z,"I'm getting the same problem as Cooper125. It's telling me that ShippingPC-StormGame.exe is not working. I could get the Setup.exe to work, but I'm unable to open the game with the new files inside the Binaries/Win32 folder."
