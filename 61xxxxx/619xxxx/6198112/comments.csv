Test.Drive.Unlimited.2.Update.2-SKIDROW
NUKE: 
not.cracked_exe.with.1.byte.changed.used.as.crack

Bulletstorm-FLT
NUKE:
savegames.not.working_get.SKIDROW.proper

Men.of.War.Assault.Squad-SKIDROW
NUKE:
not.cracked_exe.with.1.byte.changed.used.as.crack

This will be nuked too i think :)"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-24T01:40Z,"probably

but Bulletstorm-FLT has nothing to do with it. Skidrow made the PROPER, they werent the ones with the nuked release."
[T],rlf-rls,2011-02-24T02:37Z,:))) I say only that save game in FLT release works for me 
,martronn,2011-02-25T14:43Z,"what is the point of installing this if it just updates online stuff?? can,t go inline with this game cracked anyway.."
,Jevin,2011-02-25T17:17Z,"True question.
what does this update add?"
,caspianseez,2011-02-26T02:19Z,"this is for people who like to play offline.

if you don't care about going online then you can use this crack to bypass the automatic updates and continue playing."
,Jevin,2011-02-26T11:27Z,"well ofcourse,
but what I meant was:
update info only says things about online, but since you can not play online with crack, why bother to update?"
[T],rlf-rls,2011-02-28T13:33Z,Many people got problems with luncher so when SKiDROW released update 3 i decided to put this offline crack whit it. Now you have fully updated game and no internet problems. Crack only is too small to create torrent.
,Thiemok,2011-09-07T13:24Z,"Offline launcher is not working?
It says I HAVE TO connect to the servers and update..."
