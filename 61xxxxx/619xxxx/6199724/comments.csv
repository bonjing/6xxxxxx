[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T16:07Z,"There's nothing wrong with any of my uploads. Icekool666 has put this comment on all of my uploads. Ignore him. Feel free to check on my other torrents to see. There is nothing wrong with this at all. He's just a sad little boy who wants to discourage uploaders. He's not done any of his own of course, he's just a leech trying to prevent people like me sharing quality downloads with the world."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T21:28Z,"If you want to see any other comments by icekool666, kryptonite2000 or Linuxloader1, just go to any of my other torrents and you can see he's saying the same things on every one. Obviously he's lying. I've earnt that trusted skull. It means my uploads can be trusted. He hasn't even got a single upload to any of his 3 names. It's a shame people like him make it difficult for the decent folks on here. I apologise on his behalf."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:05Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. 

Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. 

The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. 

Just download any 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. 

I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted.

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads."

,Aellinsar,2011-04-24T01:25Z,"It should be noted that there was never a commercial release called the ""Tarantino Cut."" This term is used by fans of the movie to refer to a series of fan edits to the movie released on the internet which attempted to restore the movie to something closer to the writer's original vision in the screenplay. 

I'm not familiar enough with True Romance to determine whether this is in fact a fan edit with the scenes no longer appearing in chronological order, or rather a theatrical, special or director's cut of the movie.

As one of the tags for this torrent is ""Tarantino Cut"" while others are ""Special Edition"", ""Blu Ray"" and the like, one can only assume that this torrent is mislabeled, either in title or tags."

,gira89,2011-07-11T13:47Z,"Film doesn't open in VLC... when it doesn't do that, I'm a bit suspicious. And I'm not about to download some filthy codecs that _may_ work or may be harmful."
,pcolayankee,2011-09-03T16:13Z,Seems to be missing a lot...scene where Clarence goes to the theatre and meets Alabama and the whole 'white boy day' scene where Clarence kills the pimp are absent!
