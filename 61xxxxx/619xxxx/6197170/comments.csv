Bringing the games that gamers want! Thanks!"
,Conti027,2011-02-23T21:43Z,Thank you Skidrow and Thank you ExtremeZone.. I love your torrents.

,26481,2011-02-23T23:11Z,this got the crack with it?
,shrder,2011-02-24T12:09Z,"1.13 GB? The demo on steam was 2.6GB. I normally trust you extremezone but while is this torrent so small? 1.13GB is small for a game too, the other two are bigger."
,shrder,2011-02-24T12:10Z,"Excuse me, I meant why, not while."
,Syteri,2011-02-24T13:04Z,"@shrder

Skidrow's known to be able to compress files to unimaginably small sizes, so yes you're not mistaken its 1.13GB, however its the full size once unpacked"
,shrder,2011-02-24T13:22Z,"@syteri

Alright I'll give it a whirl. Loved the demo and been excited for this to come out.. only wish I had money so I could buy it instead."
,Cerebral222,2011-02-24T14:15Z,"@kizzemannen; I've had this problem before, if you use nVidia graphics card, download the latest PhysX drivers, if that won't work, write the Dll name down and google it, then download it and copy & paste it into the right folder, either Windows, or Windows/System 32 folder, you should eventually get the game going. Cheers."
,donuteater15,2011-02-24T23:15Z,"SKIDROW, you never disappoint me. even not today and for that and all your other torrents i downloaded: thanks my friend"

,VDB1,2011-02-26T11:17Z,"Works perfectly, but I prefered the 'missions' of the previous ones instead of the skirmishes in Assault Squad. Also bodies and weapons are now disappearing over time, or is that just me?"

,jengiscan,2011-02-27T04:38Z,"The game would appear to work fine.
I used ISO to exract to here...copy the two files in skidrow folder to the game folder and it worked for me second time around. I dl a version first with instructions in polish!

,geokonti,2011-03-07T23:24Z,noobs shouldn't download shit or comment cuz you suck! learn how to find a crack goddammit and then post! ty extremezone! SKIDROW as always the best!
,jackels,2011-03-15T06:55Z,"It worked beautifully. So simple a two year old could do it. The download went lighting fast, (for a torrent anyways) and the SKIDROW file worked great. For anyone who is wondering, when he says add the contents of skidrow to the install folder, just add the contents to the game folder after you installed it.  "
,Boadicca,2011-03-17T22:08Z,Ignore the moron noobs - Thank-ye for this.
,claudefrog,2011-04-07T08:58Z,it works. to open the skidrow folder you have to extract it from with the iso. ie use magic iso to explore the iso (cd image) and then you will see the skidrow folder. Then simply extract that folder to your game folder and then you can open it up. Inside the skidrow folder is the cracked exe that you will need to copy over and replace your original one.
,tjompisen,2011-04-12T15:22Z,When I mount the game with deamon tools I get a virus warning from my AVG Internet Security. Why is that?
,wowwars,2011-04-14T04:22Z,HAY THERE newbs should download but not ask the same questions over and over. we need newbs to get more soldiers.
,djo600,2011-04-16T15:09Z,Where i can find the serial?!
,Syteri,2011-04-17T15:36Z,I'm curious to know.. Can I update this and still play or do I have to wait for updated fixed exe?
,Syteri,2011-04-19T04:03Z,Does it ask for a Serial? I can't remember. I got this game to work though. Try checking the skidrow folder inside the ISO?
,Boadicca,2011-04-23T13:34Z,"You nig-nogs aren't going to get a CD Key as well! You have the game free here, so stop the whining!"

,chirkers2011,2011-05-11T11:14Z,"Just a heads up, I downloaded this and tried to install it like the many other games I have downloaded from TPB. It filled my computer with all manner of viruses and malware, causing my computer to perform a physical memoery dump after about 2-3 mins of it being turned on. I had to completely format my computer just to get it to work again.

Not having a go at you extemezone as I have downloaded many other torrents from you before with no hassles, but I don't know why this one was like this. Very disappointed though"

,Jasson2,2011-06-06T16:28Z,"Wow there are some real retards that post comments on here...

@ maustin23: Duh... your scanner will see the hacked app that cracks the game as one but it isn't one nor harmful.. add to your ignore list to your virus scanner

@ C00L_PaPa_G: you should never link a hacked/cracked game to your steam account if they see you with a cracked game they will ban your steam account and you will lose your shit on that account "
,Syteri,2011-06-08T23:48Z,"@Jasson2

You're the retard for even complaining about people's comments.

@C00L_PaPa_G

That does really happen whether or not you link the game to steam. I suggest just shutting steam down before playing the game."
,wizard84,2011-07-03T20:02Z,mine works perfectly. but dose somebody knows how to play multiplayer with bots?? 
,stationmiek,2011-07-09T21:01Z,"I recommend the prequel to this, Men Of War : Red Tide. Well worth buying as is this."

,teutonict,2011-07-18T05:37Z,"sorry to disturb, but why cant i open de skidrow fie with ISO ? can someone put a crack ink here please? i would be helpful"
,nick5963,2011-07-19T01:09Z,"Right, excuse my stupidity and ignorance. But what does it mean by put the contents of the Skidrow folder into the ""game installation""? I have found the Skidrow folder, but what is the ""game installation"" and where can I find it?"
,Syteri,2011-07-22T21:35Z,"@ZvAgO

There isn't any. Not for this one. I believe they did that on purpose because I guess they thought people who would buy this game have already played Men of War. I suggest you play the skirmishes on easy first to get a hang of it and go through the options to see the control scheme.

@nick5963

The ""Game Installation"" is the directory of which you installed your game."
,ludedude,2011-07-25T21:05Z,"Those having trouble with 'need a serial', steam_api.dll and/or confusion about where to place the crack file...

I had the steam_api.dll issue to begin with and it was nothing more than the result of having placed the crack file in the wrong folder. Place the executable in ""C:\Program Files\1C Company\Men of War. Assault Squad""

It's a bit confusing as the ""Men of War. Assault Squad"" folder's standard 'folder' icon has been replaced with the game executable's icon.

Worked perfectly after this...neat game...thanks!"
