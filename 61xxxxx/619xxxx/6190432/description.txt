Being an aspect ratio freak, I must state Paul Watson video is stretched to Widescreen, the real aspect is full screen.

Paul Joseph Watson of PrisonPlanet.com andwriter Aaron Dykes sit in while Alex is away to discuss how the reality behind the threat of radical Islam is being obfuscated by people like Glenn Beck. Also presented is an encore presentation featuring interviews with former CIA analyst Ray McGovern and journalist Nomi Prins. She is the author of It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.
