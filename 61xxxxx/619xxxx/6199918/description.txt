I encoded this using Handbrake like on.off.on suggested.

This is the first movie I have encoded. So no need for complaints I'm still 

learning. That will only cause me to not want to encode anything.  

Video 		: H264
Bitrate		: 400 Kbps
Passes		: 2 

Audio Codec	: AAC Dolby Pro Logic II
Bitrate		: 128 Kbps

I downloaded the 700MB Morning Glory Dvd rip as my source.


Enjoy and Help me seed please.
