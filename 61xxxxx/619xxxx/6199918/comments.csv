,[RWolff],2011-02-24T23:16Z,Thanx! I'll check it out!
[T],MelloYello,2011-02-24T23:24Z,I'm encoding a couple of things.  Trying to figure out what works best. I'll prob upload Justified season 2 episode 3 tonight.  Tomorrow night I'll try and do Big Bang Theory and Rules of Engagement.
,pinkpetal,2011-02-25T02:27Z,"Well...... sound is slightly off sync, so for that I'd give a 4 out of 10. But video is really good so I'd give an 8 out of 10. So, it's ok, but could really be better. It is the right size, though. I look forward to what else you have to offer. I'd love to find The Missing in handheld format for hubby by Sunday when he leaves. "
,pf219,2011-02-25T03:14Z,"I finished downloading i didn't see any problem with the audio, it was in sync. good job on the up for your first video A=9 V=10"
,rzfoster48,2011-02-25T05:40Z,you did a good job with the encode however using blueray rips & hddvd rips as your sources would seal the deal!!   thanks for ur hard work
[T],MelloYello,2011-02-25T06:01Z,I just skimmed through this with vlc player I didn't find any sync issues.  I haven't watched the movie yet.
