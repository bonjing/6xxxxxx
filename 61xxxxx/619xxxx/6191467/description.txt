REVIEW

\"Right\" from the inventive opening credits, you\'ll know that Mr. Right 
is a delectably fun treat. The film has a cast of characters that will become 
family by the film\'s end. Louise (Georgia Zaris), friend to a gaggle of gay men,
 just wants to make sure that her current beau Paul (Jeremy Edwards) is actually straight. 
She has a history of dating gay men, so she brings him to a dinner party with
 her buddies. There\'s Alex (Luke de Woolfson), a cater-waiter whose acting career 
is always just about to take off. He\'s living with Harry (James Lance), a reality 
TV producer who\'s ashamed of the crap he foists on the public. Tom (David Morris) 
is a successful artist who brings his rental boyfriend Larrs to the party; 
Larrs (Benjamin Hart) is always on the make, or is he? And then there\'s William 
(Rocky Marshall), whose 11-year-old daughter is determined to drive her dad\'s 
boyfriends away. Current beau Lawrence (Leon Ockenden) is a TV star who everyone 
sort of recognizes, and who thinks that he\'s actually the doctor he plays on TV. 
Director/co-writer Jacqui Morris and her co-writer brother David have crafted a 
fast-paced movie about a group of charming characters who each discover an inner 
truth as the film develops. The frothy, fun and upbeat Mr. Right is one of the 
best date movies this year. Enjoy!
