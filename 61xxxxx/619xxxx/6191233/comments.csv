Great video, great video quality and audio.

Dont listen to xotx5 I and im like sure anyone else didnt receive any infragment notice.

I know this might be a stupid question but how do I view the subtittles? How can I put them in the movie so I can move the movie to a flash disk to watch on my xbox 360? I watched it last night and it didnt have the subtittles."
