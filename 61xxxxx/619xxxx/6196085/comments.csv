,booga007,2011-03-01T13:23Z,"This does work for Win7 SP1 x64 (built 7601).

At first it wasn't working for me, but just read the readme and it solved my problem (the first issue they address).


I'm not sure if its necessary but I backed up my tokens.dat as it was corrupt before installing SP1 and I had issues, but now I can replace if needed."
