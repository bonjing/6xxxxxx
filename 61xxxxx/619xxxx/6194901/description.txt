The first edition of this highly acclaimed publication received a Shingo Research and Professional Publication Prize in 2009. Explaining how to create and sustain a Lean business, it followed Cogent Powerâ€™s first two Lean Roadmaps along their journey.

Since then, much has changed. Several members of Cogent Powerâ€™s senior management have moved on, steel prices have declined, and the credit crisis has sparked an unstable global economy. Set against these developments, Staying Lean: Thriving, Not Just Surviving, Second Edition reports on Cogent Powerâ€™s response to these issuesâ€”detailing how they worked through their third Lean Roadmap. It also:
