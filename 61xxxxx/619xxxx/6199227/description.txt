Ashampoo Movie Shrink & Burn 3 resizes and converts your digital movies and video clips to other formats quickly and with very high quality.

Ashampoo Movie Shrink & Burn 3 takes care of everything else for you.

Take charge of the video zoo!
Today there is a huge zoo of video formats for display on a growing number of devices, including mobile devices. You will often want to share videos with friends or family members who need different formats, or upload videos to sites that require a particular format. Ashampoo Movie Shrink & Burn 3 solves this problem: It converts between formats and can also shrink the videos in the process â€“ for example to fit on a single DVD or CD or to make smaller files for uploading or mailing. 
Copy movies to multiple DVDs
This version adds DVD video burning with the ability to store big movies on two or more DVDs so that you have no loss of quality. This avoids the need for expensive dual-layer recordable DVDs that are sometimes less reliable. 
Produce top quality YouTube videos
You can now convert directly to a whole range of different video sharing site formats, including YouTube. This gives you full control over the compression and quality of your movies for the best possible results. In addition to YouTube, Ashampoo Movie Shrink & Burn 3 also supports the Yahoo Video, MySpace TV, Metacafe and DailyMotion formats.
