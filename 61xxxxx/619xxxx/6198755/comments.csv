,kitzbuhel,2011-12-11T19:22Z,dpkingers - 12yr old? I love the concept of keeping things free and work in the right direction making material possible to download from legit channels. I wont be 100% free ofcourse but I hope the combo of making the material available through new channels and easier to pay for will make piarate bay go away. But for now this is the shit
