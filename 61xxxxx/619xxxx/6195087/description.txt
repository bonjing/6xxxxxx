"No Ordinary Proposal"

Jim's feelings of guilt are overwhelming when, 
during a fight with a thug, he diverts a bullet 
that accidentally hits a boy - causing life-
threatening harm. Meanwhile, Daphne's boyfriend, 
Chris, steals the trilsettum serum from the Powell 
house and injects his wheelchair-bound father, Roy 
(Anthony Michael Hall), with disastrous results; 
Joshua proposes to Katie; and JJ's teacher takes 
unscrupulous steps to get him to join the school's 
academic decathlon team.

Enjoy :)
