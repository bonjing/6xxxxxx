,elcochan,2011-03-10T23:28Z,"I can confirm it does NOT work.  I tried with the PS3 Break dongle with firmware 1.71 and all I got was a black screen after loading the game.  I also updated the PS3 the exactly what it was tested on KMEAW 3.55 with multiman 1.16 (here is the link for the upgrade: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6205397/_Custom_Firmware_Kmeaw_3.55__w_MultiMan_1.16.03

I am still having the same issue, don't waste you time and bandwidth with this one. 

p.s. even checked the SFO file and still had issues"
