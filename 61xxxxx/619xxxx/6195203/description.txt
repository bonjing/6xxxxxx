The infamous 19th century tale of two grave robbers (Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis) working for the Edinburgh Medical College is adapted for comedic purposes with this John Landis-helmed production. Piers Ashworth and Nick Moorcroft (St. TrinianÂ´s) penned the black comedy, which follows true-life grave-digging murderers William Burke and William Hare as they do their damning deeds in Edinburgh, Scotland.
