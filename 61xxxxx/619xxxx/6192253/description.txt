Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May set out to end the chaos and misery that snowfall brings to Britain every year, using a combine harvester, some basic engineering skills and a quick trip to Norway.

Also in this show, Jeremy is on the test track in the new Audi RS5 and the latest BMW M3. Plus there's a rather surprising guest in the Reasonably Priced Car.
