It's been a long time since Karan Casey and John Doyle played together in Solas. Now with both very much at the top of their game, the idea of a duet album seems like a no-brainer. It's certainly one of the loveliest Irish albums to come down the pike in a long while. Casey is a mesmerizing singer, full of delicacy on "Out of the Window" (a variant on "She Moved Through the Fair") and "The Flowers of Finae," and gleeful on the girl-dressed-as-soldier tale of "The Little Drummer Girl." Although Doyle doesn't show off his fretboard skills more than necessary, he's powerful on all things plucked, and demonstrates how his voice has improved over the years on the lovely "Sally Grier." A number of the songs deal with emigration, not just because it's an important part of the Irish tradition, but also part of the experience of both these artists.
