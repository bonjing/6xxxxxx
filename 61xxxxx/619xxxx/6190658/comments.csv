,lorkkk786r78t,2011-03-02T00:59Z,Why do people still choose MP3 instead of AAC??? AAC is way better than MP3 for the same bitrate
,alejandro70,2011-03-04T18:22Z,GRACIAS    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,strowg9,2011-03-08T01:25Z,"Thanks SW_Singles, the GF will love this.

@lorkkk786r78t, the reason that people still use MP3 is because it's not inferior to AAC. Even below 320CBR, MP3 is transparent if properly encoded. Furthermore, it has much wider acceptance than AAC. If you properly tag MP3 it will work consistently across virtually any platform.

If you can actually tell the difference between 320CBR LAME MP3 and the source material (which I can assure you, if you were to perform a blind abx test you would be like 99% of people and find it indistinguishable), AAC is not for you either. You need lossless."
,strowg9,2011-03-08T01:28Z,"I'd add that you would be correct for lower bitrates, where AAC is great for heavily compressing speech, etc.  However, no one should be downloading music in these low bitrates where you can actually notice the difference."

A CD is 44.1 @256 Stereo CBR

Therefore your converted file should be

A CD is 44.1 @256 (or 320) Stereo CBR

VBR is used to decrease the file size for broadcast/streaming.

Joint Stereo is a non true stereo format used to decrease the file size. It was developed for internet streaming

The mp3 format was removed from the standards in 1995 because it could not reproduce high quality audio for High Defination and multi channel audio. AAC was invented to replace mp3.

Using VBR and Joint Stereo decrease the audio quality because it removes data that is deemed redundant. VBR and Joint Stereo also reqire more processing power from the playback unit because it has to reconstruct the data. As a result, the battery life of your portable player is reduced compared to playing a CBR Stereo file.

All Audio recordings, from the studio to CD are in CBR Stereo.

If you do not beleive me, go read the standards, or at least the wiki articles.

Apple do not own AAC, unlike Fraunhofer who own mp3."

,resonator,2011-06-11T21:03Z,Thanks to the uploader. This album is great. Apple fanboys - can't your player handle mp3 or what are you bitching about ?
,OverlordAlexndr,2011-10-17T18:05Z,Great torrent. Thanks SW_Singles
,ivanhoe68,2012-04-10T12:27Z,"Well i love when it`s not in FLAC format, cause i play all my music in the car, and my car stereo only plays WMA and Mp3. Thx for the UPLOAD!"
