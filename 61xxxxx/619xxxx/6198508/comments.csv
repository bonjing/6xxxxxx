,Waxel,2011-02-27T00:28Z,Anyone seeds thise ever ?? really want it
,PsychoMY,2011-03-02T18:58Z,Any chance of seeding this torrent? Uploaded 2-24-2011 and seems nobody has more than about 4% of the total torrent. uTorrent shows 2 seeds but in 5 days I'm still at 3.6%. Where's the original uploader at? Seems he could have seeded until there were at least a handful of completed downloads...
,fun-tv,2011-03-02T20:07Z,hello I apologise about not uploading I have been away since saturday with work and the computer turned its self off I will resume uploading.....also I shall apologise with a mistake I have made with seen 7 titles..The titles indicate that the episode are season 6 however I can confirm for you that they are indeed season 7 just my mistake for putting 6 instead of 7
,PsychoMY,2011-03-06T15:18Z,"Go into your torrent client and check either initial seed or superseed. It will upload MUCH faster as it will begin sending different pieces to scattered clients and they will in turn feed everyone else. Right now, you are seeding every piece to everyone and it's HORRIBLY slow..."
,benskii,2011-03-18T05:39Z,heyy im stuck on 56.5% .. any idea's on how to make it faster

,Herculine,2011-04-02T20:26Z,"Season 2 Episode 22 is missing in this collection; it is instead a mis-named copy of Episode 23.

Otherwise a great collection so far. THANKS!"
,Herculine,2011-04-03T04:46Z,"My bad... I meant se 1 epi 22, not se 2."
,Herculine,2011-04-03T04:49Z,"Also, season 1 episode 6 seems to have a lot of glitches in it that get worse as the clip progresses."
,Herculine,2011-04-13T03:28Z,Season 3 Episodes 3 and 8 are both missing the first scenes and intro sequences.
,james562b,2011-05-08T04:11Z,anyone seeding this gonna take 2 years to download according to utorrent
,MoviePerfectionist,2011-05-13T09:22Z,"Thank you i will continue to seed until at least 100 people have it, i can seed at 400kbs so it should be faster"
,bearzoo,2011-05-16T13:39Z,i'm uploading 100kbps but I'm only downloading 8kbps on this guy. any help?
,bearzoo,2011-05-16T13:48Z,fun-tv you're the man. I've downloaded some ncis episodes from you before and as I remember they were great. Didn't thank you back then cause I couldn't remember my acct password so Thanks now :)
,chefness,2011-05-20T04:08Z,"@Herculine - You were right the first time, it is actually Season 2, Episode 22 (""SWAK"") that is missing."
,rara11,2011-05-20T14:00Z,Please seed :) and thanks for upload

,Ubida,2011-06-02T05:19Z,"Please seed! I just started the download, and the ETA currently says 17w, and it's pretty damn steady."
,Ubida,2011-06-02T05:42Z,"ok, now it sways between 2 and 3 years till finish download... more seeds would be much appreciated."
,bearzoo,2011-07-25T05:27Z,"Fun-tv, thanks. All the content I've ever gotten from you has been really good stuff. Your effort is appreciated.

I am DL'ing season 5. It's the only season I haven't seen yet because every time I have tried to DL it in the past, no one is sharing it. When I go for days only getting 2kbps I give up.

This time I am getting only like 25kbps. Sometimes it jumps to 50, but it drops really soon back to 25 or less. I am uploading 100kbps (not right this second but all day earlier, I decreased my bandwidth to share with my mom who's on youtube listening to music)

I have a ratio of 1.4+ uploading and I've uploaded 4 gigs since I started this DL. Please someone help me. I don't know how it works but if someone can direct some more priority to me I promise I'll help seed when I'm done downloading. I only ask because I've had trouble getting this season in the past. Thanks :)"
,sover435,2011-08-07T05:28Z,"seed plz im bouncing around 5kb/s

,Optemas,2011-09-06T13:24Z,"Nice Batch torrent...
only two notes: 
A) S01 E06: lots of Glitches.
B) S02 E22: Missing and it replaced by a copy of S02 E23.

Looks like everything else is just fine,
Great job (fun-tv)."
,SoftSense,2011-10-16T01:05Z,"i have been downloading this torrent for over 1 week now, so far i have the first season finished and they are overall good, some glitches here and there but nothing to bad.

so the material looks good, to bad the speed sucks."
