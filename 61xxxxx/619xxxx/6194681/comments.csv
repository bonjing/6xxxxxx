,clemlenain,2011-02-23T01:42Z,Here the name and size differ from legit release...
,nagumo,2011-02-23T01:54Z,"This is a fake, it's not even the correct file size."
,puppeteer666,2011-02-23T05:13Z,"It's not a fuckin fake i've posted quite a few torrents and are always solid.

This is not fake it's zipped and I am using it.
Ran through Avast AV and is clean.
Don't run your fuckin mouth until you test."
,puppeteer666,2011-02-23T05:20Z,"Hate these assholes that make comments on my torrents that automatically assume they are fake.

And I know these idiots didn't download my torrent and try it because if they did they would know it is a legit torrent!"
,NarutoNamikaze,2011-02-23T18:48Z,"I read his previous uploads comments and those are legit. So he is a good uploader.
Dunno about this one. I haven't downloaded the game anyway."
,puppeteer666,2011-02-24T17:22Z,I wouldn't post bad torrentz I know how shitty that is and I WON'T EVER DO THAT!
,puppeteer666,2011-02-26T19:56Z,"You must install a legit copy of a games for windows liove game first.

Then you can install any GFWL game that is not legut it will just log you in offline.

If you do not install a legit GFWL game 1st it will not log you in at all and will ask for alegitimite key."
