,dlectro,2011-02-21T12:18Z,How stupid do you have to be to put this in RAR?...
,james003,2011-02-21T21:42Z,"I'm also not a big fan of rar archived tveps. However:
- i think it's a scene rule or something to pack releases into rars
- it's almost painless to righ click -> extract here
- NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO DOWNLOAD THIS !!! if you don't like the fact that it's archived you can simply look for another torrent that is not, OR MAKE ONE YOURSELF

Thanks sceneline for this (and other) fine 720p release(s) :)"
,Yubaba,2011-02-22T00:16Z,"I don't like rar either, but it's better than nothing  :)"
,systemsmoke,2011-02-22T02:24Z,Is this really dimension? Seroiusly...... If this is a new thing that you guy's are doing think again because it doesn't work for torrents.
,systemsmoke,2011-02-22T02:28Z,I really can't work it out unless it was for quick release that someone in your group decided to shove it in a rar?.
,systemsmoke,2011-02-22T02:32Z,"@james003, shut the fuck up!... "
,systemsmoke,2011-02-22T02:36Z,"@james 003, You think it's a scene thing?... It's not a scene thing and files that are split take longer to download. Thats the problem.... Now go play with your dingaling and leave us to talk big boy talk!"
,Johnny575,2011-02-22T14:07Z,"Damn, it's not working on Vuze. 0 seeds."
,iamneo33,2011-02-22T18:09Z,"ohhhh it rar'd

now its going to take me 11 minutes to download instead of 10.  I honestly don't care if its rar'd or not...  Its free either way... thanks for the upload!  

You still got the episode number wrong, though!  its S09E11 

again thanks for the upload..

Neo..."
,rebel7777,2011-02-23T12:18Z,wait... files that are split take longer to download? how exactly did you figure that out?
,Raficoo,2011-02-24T00:06Z,Thank you for the high quality upload :D
,Fleabr,2011-02-27T17:57Z,"Takes longer to download ? What the fuck are you talking about, at the very least its either going to take as long as if it weren't or less since its compressed, therefore less to download.

And they do this so if it part of it gets corrupted its much easier to re-download just that part than the whole file again."
