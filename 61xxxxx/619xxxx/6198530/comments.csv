,LeliStarr,2011-02-24T13:37Z,"Hey Eztv, I just wanted to let you know I really appreciate what you do. I've only been mildly interested in AI, but I caught a glimpse of one of the auditions and thought it would be worth a watch. My schedule is strict, so I can't watch it when they come on, so I started doing it this way. Video and audio is always excellent! Thanks so much :)"
,DORANDLEEKOUS,2011-02-24T14:00Z,You rock!  My appreciation extends a million times!!
,axen81,2011-02-24T16:34Z,"I'm also super happy that you're giving us this, I love it! Thank you wholeheartedly!"

,mc_homes,2011-02-26T00:46Z,"@ egiharam, that looks like a fake. it is only half the filesize a 2 hour show should be.  but seriously..i wonder why ep 12 hasnt been upped? maybe it didnt air for some reason?"

,exaulted,2011-02-26T01:02Z,No one has upped Episode 12 yet? I'm looking for a 720 version but I can't find any version. Strange.. Usually American Idol gets upped minutes after the show ends.
,mc_homes,2011-02-26T02:13Z,a legit copy just got upped on demonoid
,SchoolyardKiller,2011-02-26T18:40Z,"There, it's been uploaded here too:
