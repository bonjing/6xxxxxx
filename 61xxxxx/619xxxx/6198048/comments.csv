e4 is full of gaps/dropouts and is unwatchable.

Don't k-now about the rest, didn't bother trying after the two corrupt files.

Tried re-downloading with force-check to the existing [supposedly 100% complete] location but all files check out against the torrent.  This implies that the files are corrupt at the uploader's end.

Do not bother downloading this."
