They foresaw the coming of Christianity and the Spanish Conquest of Central America. Written over 800 years ago, the Mayan prophecies predicted the First World War, the rise of Hitler, and the December 2006 tsunami that devastated South East Asia. In just a few short years, on December 21, 2012, the Mayans predict that a natural disaster of untold proportions will destroy the earth and wipe out all mankind. As December 21, 2012 approaches, the Mayan prophecies are gaining world-wide attention. 

The Maya believed that everything including creation and destruction occurred in cycles. Their calendar spanned five cycles, each lasting approximately 5,200 years. At the end of each cycle before this one, the Maya believed the current, flawed creation had to be destroyed for the world to be born again. Some believe the end of the current cycle on December 21, 2012, is an apocalyptic sign. And those who see a connection between the complex and incredibly accurate Maya calendar and a prophecy that the world will end in 2012 point to an unexpected discovery made in 2003.

This captivating documentary looks for the truth behind the compelling myth â€“ is there evidence of global upheaval on a massive scale? We follow scientist Adam Maloof to three continents on a detective story that spans eons, with clues embedded in the oldest rocks on the planet.
