"It's High Time"

Back to her old tricks, Emily (guest star 
Abbie Cobb, "Jonas") messes with Annie's 
(Shenae Grimes) internship at the 
playhouse -- and with Annie's boyfriend. 
Silver (Jessica Stroup) convinces Navid 
(Michael Steger) to sign the release for 
Adrianna's (Jessica Lowndes) reality show 
to help distract her and throw her off 
the track. Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) 
bottles up her feeling for Max (guest 
star Josh Zuckerman, "Desperate 
Housewives"). After watching footage from 
her birthday party, Adrianna makes a 
stunning realization. Ivy (Gillian 
Zinser) meets a new guy, Raj (guest star 
Manish Dayal) and they strike up a 
friendship. Meanwhile, Dixon (Tristan 
Wilds), Navid, and Liam (Matt Lanter) 
take Teddy out on the town.

Enjoy :)
