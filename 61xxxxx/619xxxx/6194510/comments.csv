Looking to get a few more up in the next few hours."
,AntwerpAnt,2011-02-23T02:45Z,"Hum, well, I'm not sure what happened, but mediainfo is reporting this as stereo now.
It plays and sounds fine, but it's not 5.1

I don't understand how that happened, because when I did the final muxing with TSMuxer, it recognized the file as AC3 5.1

I will do more experimenting with S16E02"
,AntwerpAnt,2011-02-23T04:51Z,"Upon further review, I have found that all previous 720p releases were 192kbps AC3 audio, just as these files are in this torrent.
Even the commerically available BluRays are the same audio format.

So, I was trippin' for nothing - all is well.  
Enjoy."

,bopperd,2012-01-02T04:25Z,"Thanks for this. Antwerpant, can you seed this again for a little while? My download went dead at 2.5gb and I'd dearly love to have these episodes. 
Thanks,
Dave"
