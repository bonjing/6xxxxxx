From Asheville, North Carolina Enoch are a fuzz-drenched Stoner-Doom band that like to push their old tube amps to the breaking point. Even listening to them via the tunes on their Myspace page is punishing with their distorted grooves, pounding drums and low-ended, bass driven Doom - Laden arrangements. 
They also have a EP out on Raig Records called "Moth" which is a masterpiece of sonic self-indulgence so i can only imagine what their live shows must be like. Sounding like Electric Wizard and Sons Of Otis's love-child, this band is dirty, raw example of pushing the boundaries of extreme riff-rock.
Fans of early 70's rock, doom and drones of varying degrees of distortion and pitch, delay drenched guitar solos, their goal is to write songs that can be both tight and heavy and also descend into more improvised psychedelic rock territory.
