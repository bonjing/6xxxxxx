,Biggsy68,2011-02-26T18:54Z,"don't know what you've uploaded but it's not MP3, downloads as a file that windows can't recognise"
,ScFc,2011-02-27T12:48Z,"Hello biggsy, you must download 7-zip, this will allow you to open the file, and then you can drag the songs to a folder if your choice. Http://www.7-zip.org

Don't worry, the music is here"
,Woftis,2011-03-01T22:11Z,alternative to downloading 7-zip - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6211808/Beady_Eye_-_Different_Gear__Still_Speeding
,ScFc,2011-03-03T17:10Z,Would you mind not posting other links to the same album on my torrent please. 7-zip simply helps to compress the files to a smaller size so that it is more convenient for the downloaders.
