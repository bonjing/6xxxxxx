Im using NoD32 on Win 7

added the dll to the exclusions list but dont seem to work. 
Almost forgot to mention, i have to copy Skidrow.dll before launching the game every time cuz it ""disappear"".

Downloaded the SKIDROW crack
Mounted the FLT Bulletstorm iso in Daemon Tools
Installed
Removed the appropriate files as instructed by the SKIDROW crack .nfo file
Copied over the appropriate files as instructed by the SKIDROW crack .nfo file
Installed the Title Update (setup.exe) located on the FLT .iso in the Fairlight Folder
Installed and updated Games for Windows Live
Started the game and I was already logged in under an offline profile and I can now access Chapter Select when I complete Acts of the game.  THANKS SKIDROW.

The FLT crack DOES NOT WORK.  Games for Windows Live will not work with the FLT crack and therefore you will never be able to access Chapter Select, amongst other features."
