35 Books about guns, self defense, tactics, making primitive weapons, and the like:

These are all new scans from February, 2011. None of these files have ever been posted anywhere before.

Note: The books that end with " - ocr.pdf" have a layer of text behind the page image that has not been proof read. This makes them searchable. All other 

books are just page images. I'm sorry that I do not have the time to proof read more finely OCRed files that would have much smaller page sizes. If you do 

ahve the time (and software,) go ahead and OCr them and repost them.

If you find errors, post a comment on TPB, and let me know. I will eventually fix all errors.
