Albert Ayler - Live in Greenwich Village (The Complete Impulse Recordings) [1998]

This double CD from 1998 combines all of the music on tenor saxophonist Albert Ayler's In Greenwich Village recording with a two-album set from the same sessions, titled The Village Concerts (the latter taken from two concerts in 1966-1967). In addition, there is one number from 1965, originally included on the sampler The New Wave in Jazz, and a previously unissued (and incomplete) "Universal Thoughts" from the 1967 date, one of the very few examples of Ayler using a trombonist (the forgotten George Steele). Taken as a whole, these are among the most rewarding recordings that the controversial Ayler ever made. They will not convince detractors of the radical saxophonist's music but they are more accessible than much of his music. Teamed up with brother Donald Ayler on trumpet, violinist Michel Sampson, occasional cellist Joel Freedman, two bassists (Bill Fowell and either Henry Grimes or Alan Silva), and drummer Beaver Harris, Ayler uses simple march-like melodies, which could have come from 1905, as the basis for his improvisations, which often become quite violent. Among the pieces are "Truth Is Marching In," "Spirits Rejoice," "Angels" (an Albert Ayler duet with pianist Call Cobbs), "For John Coltrane," and "Change Has Come." Donald Ayler's bugle-like fanfares and the droning violin certainly make the ensemble's sound quite unique.

Light in Darkness and Heavenly Home are in mono. A Version of Saints was recorded at the Village Gate session but not master tape of that performance has survived. All other selections are in stereo. Universal Thoughts is an imcomplete performance, most likely because the tape ran out before its completion.
