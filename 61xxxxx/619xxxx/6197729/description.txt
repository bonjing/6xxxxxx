Morph Age Pro is an application for morphing and warping still images AND movies on Mac OS X.

Morph Age works by allowing you to define curves on one or more images. Any change made on the curves is reflected on the resulting image through the corresponding distorsion and morphing effect. It has most of the latest advances in morphing features, including Smart Assist and interactive preview.

Morph Age Pro has additional support for video morphing and warping, allowing frame accurate processing and advanced keyframed animation. One talking face can be morphed into another talking face as they are talking!

Note: Do not update the app, if an update will be available I will upload it later. In the Mac App Store the version is 4.1 its wrong, the original version is 4.0.7 on the main site of the app.

THNKA TO REAGAN FOR ANOTHER FINE UPLOAD!

System Requirement:

Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard or later
