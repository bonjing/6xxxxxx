Are you anal-retentive when it comes to keeping your computer prestine clean
of registry/installation files? So am i!

Using strictly portable software helps reduce the junk on your computer which
leads to poor performance. In addition, it will work on any computer without
installation or meeting system requirements. If you're like me, create a
partition solely for your portable applications. This way you don't have to 
reinstall/copy & move your portable apps. after doing clean installs.

* If you're familiar with 'TuneUp Utilities' give this a try, you'll love 
WinASO's performance, speed, usefullness, and light-footprint. I stopped using 
'TuneUp Utilities', it's become bloat-ware.
