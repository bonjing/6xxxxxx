Metal Slug

There is also a Secret Game hidden somewhere on the game select screen.

I Realise that a lot of emulated games and packs have been posted recently, However, with my little loaders, i am trying to put out something different. Hope you like it.

A Few People Enjoyed My Street Fighter Collection (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6191511),
And My Mortal Kombat Collection
(http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6196335),
And i got a few good Comments. So to hell with it, i'll make a few more. I enjoy it anyway.

I will Take Requests, But bear in mind, It would be handy To be a collection of games, Not Singles. I May however, Create Genre Collections, Such As Shmups, Misc Fighters, Puzzle Games, Etc.

Current Collections Planned are:

Bubble Bobble History
And Possibly A Capcom Side Scrolling Beat em up Collection

Also, I will be Twittering My Torrents now, So Follow me @trencej

Play and Enjoy
