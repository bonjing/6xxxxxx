And here we are, the next Spirou comic.

This is one of my personal favorites, and they should have started with this as first one imo, as it is more geared towards an international audience than Adventure Down Under (ok, they should have started with Franquin\'s run, but this is the next best thing). If you don\'t like this one, you got no soul :)

Spirou and Fantasio have won a million dollars and a trip to New York City. How lucky! Well, maybe not that lucky, since its all a plot by Don Cortizone to change his own fortune in his struggle against The Mandarin by enlisting the help of truly lucky people. Before long, the two reporters find themselves in the middle of a shooting war between Italian Mafia and Chinese Triad and they will have to make their own luck.
