,dzlrules,2011-02-23T03:29Z,Thanks Sparky! I'll comment on quality and such after I've gotten the file.
,benfarmin,2011-02-23T03:56Z,"I will also, and thank you for uploading this, i will seed lol. would of watched it myself but i was stuck at work the whole time, and to make matters worse , someone already told me a 20 year old kid won, in just his second nascar cup series start . ugh lol"
,rontorr,2011-02-23T04:51Z,"Thank you so much, and you uploaded the whole thing, not just the highlights. it is actually a good size file, I think, for more than 3 hours"
,salbrecht,2011-02-23T05:14Z,"Thanks very much for this.  I am not the least bit concerned with file size, but rather quality is more important to me.  Anything under about 4gb is quite acceptable.  And please do upload the entire series as the races are run.  I am in Thailand and I can't get the live broadcast here.

Thanks again
Steve"
,kamnet,2011-02-23T09:16Z,Thank you! Looking forward to more.

,740_300k,2011-02-24T01:56Z,"I just started downloading...will seed for quite some time.  I'd love it if you upped the entire season.  I don't have a DVR, so if I miss one, these will be great.  Thank you."
,dzlrules,2011-02-24T04:07Z,"I'm about 3/4 into watching the race. The quality is very nice other than a few small glitches (record scratch noise and video burps - LOL).

Overall, very much worth dl'ing and seeding afterwards. Thanks again James!"
,kamnet,2011-02-24T13:34Z,"Great video, thanks, SEED SEED SEED!  Nice to see a fellow Hoosier uploading good racing! "
,jameshotwire,2011-02-25T00:28Z,"Thanks for all the support fella's , I will definitely continue uploading the rest, mid-season it switches over to ESPN which is not a over the air broadcast so will try and figure that out ahead of time. The initial seeding went much faster than I thought, hats off to you all for that. I will step up the bitrate, and try for the 6 channel surround sound in the next release, Thanks again and boogedy boogedy lets go racing! ;)"
,mavrix,2011-02-28T01:09Z,"Also wanted to say thanks.  Great race.  No probs, after about 100 laps left a couple audio/video blurps as mentioned, but only in a couple spots and not frequent at all, I enjoyed it throughly.   Couldn't believe it would be in as good quality as it was for the file size.

10/10"
,mmg113,2011-03-08T14:20Z,"Thx so much man. Love ur torrents. Plz Continue to upload the whole season ! Ur the only uploader who does this
thx again!"
,jmac85,2011-03-16T22:18Z,"Bit late on watching this, so I'm gonna give it a go. Thanks for this...like was said above, nobody does these. You can reduce the file size a bit by tweaking your x264 settings a bit (longer encode likely) and encoding the AAC at, say, 70Kb/s, VBR. I usually skip specifying the bit rate and set a quality factor of 0.5."
,Pumkin21,2011-04-10T16:57Z,Great stuff! Thanks!! Would you by chance also happen to have a copy of 'The Daytona 500: The American Dream' shown on FOX at 1PM on the off weekend of March 13th? It was a 1 hour recap of the race that seemed to be pretty well done.
,VeritasB,2011-05-16T07:54Z,"Downloaded it fairly quickly, thanks to all the other seeders out there. Will be seeding this great race, definitely not removing it.

Thanks to James for uploading it."
,DieKuche,2012-02-27T12:57Z,"Great upload, I loved it! Does anyone have this years race?"
