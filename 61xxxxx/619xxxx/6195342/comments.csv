It sounds like an electropop-Motown album. I'm not a huge fan of the change, but I am a huge fan of Patrick - so I'll force myself to like it more."

Amazing songs, we all knew FOB was Patrick, he is the talent!

But remember He's not on a major label any more and if you want to continue to hear his orgasmic talent you'll have to go see him live and support him much more thoroughly.

EP = *****"
