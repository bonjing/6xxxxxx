only problem i've noticed is every once in a while the video's get really pixelated. so if this copy has nothing ripped out why were the videos recoded to a smaller size?

other than that runs great, I have had no issues with cut scene subs or audio as others experienced"
,adismo1000,2011-02-27T15:42Z,"Downloaded, Installed and completed without any problems or hiccups.
the movies are low quality but there are only 2 or 3 of them, otherwise the game and the in-game cutscenes all have great quality....
and yeah make sure after installing the game to exclude the xlive.dll in the game from your antivirus, otherwise it will be quarantined and the game won't run"

what the hell are you smoking,
its 3.09gb compressed, after decompressing the game is 6.60gb  almost the 7.gb size you mean to tell me they cant compress the extra 40mb of space lmao.
do not comment on things you know nothing about!
a 6.7gb game can be compressed down to 4.02 without high compression, so i think a 6.60 game can be compressed while retaining the video quality!!"
,dragonballz,2011-03-02T20:48Z,"@Shoobox: MATHS Fail !!
6.60gb - 7gb is not = 40mb!!"
,Shoobox,2011-03-02T21:09Z,"@dragonballz
I was being sarcastic moron. next time pay attention smart arse!

which still my point is valid @PopTarted 
if you compress down a 7.gb game  to 3.09gb

I know for a fact from compressing 7.gb game files, will compress down to 4.02gb without high compression using Peazip to archive to 7zip"
,Shoobox,2011-03-02T21:14Z,"@dragonballz 
but if you want to be a math wiz lmao

 bytes in 6.7gb
7,194,070,220.8 bytes 


1024 meg = 1 gig
so do the math little man!"
,Shoobox,2011-03-02T21:24Z,"@dragonballz 

0.5gb is 512mb
1024mb is 1gb

so out of ""6.7gb"" the 0.70gb is what roughly 700mb


so once again 700mb can't be compressed down with 6.60 lmao
as stated b4 7gb files can easily compress to 4.gb so at high compression it can be sqeezed to 3.2 depending on your rig and archive settings.
so one more time the videos where sized down for what reason? lmao"

lol, yea im a arse sometimes.

As far as the quality as some of us said.
i downloaded and ran  the installer, it was quick to unpack.
 I didn't need to do anything special as other had to:
I didn't need to use Skidrow crack, played right of the back, just a couple of video's were very low pixelated quality.
but most of the other video's where fine. "

agreed, there is no reason they couldn't of fit the whole video or retained the whole 7gb game file.
400 extra mb wouldn't of made that big of a difference in compression for download.

you are about the most retarded person yet ive come across,
 congrats for getting the 2011 golden turd award.
