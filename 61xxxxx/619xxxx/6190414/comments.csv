,Leonardo,2011-02-21T04:23Z,why is this listed as episode 12 when it is really episode 11?? :s
,jackson5more,2011-02-21T04:37Z,"Episode 11 is here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6173044/Family_Guy_S09E11_HDTV_XviD-LOL_[eztv]
This is rightly 12"
,IntoxX,2011-02-21T04:41Z,Thank you sir.
,dashdanw,2011-02-21T04:43Z,"pilot-leo, they counted the extended episode as two episodes while they were counting so theyve had to keep it this way....at last thats what i remember"
,jd.ck11,2011-02-21T04:55Z,honest mistake?
,damnken,2011-02-21T09:37Z,Looks very very nice. I will download this. Thanks for the upload/s EZTV! You're the best!
,cro508,2011-02-21T10:18Z,S9 E12 hasn't been uploaded onto any sites yet so it can't be on TPB either. it's weird cos they are usually up by now.. so it might be another few hours or even a day.
,heisenberg737,2011-02-21T23:24Z,"eztv thx very much, great torrent as usual, but you really need to fix your naming, you had road to the north pole counted as 2 episodes, and since then all episodes have been shifted by 1 number ^^"
,iseedifgood,2011-02-22T18:29Z,amazing quality good job ill seed for a week
,kdallas2010,2011-02-23T15:42Z,"I hope this helps clear things up...

Family Guy - S09E03 - Welcome Back Carter
Family Guy - S09E04 - Halloween on Spooner Street
Family Guy - S09E05 - Baby, You Knock Me Out

Family Guy - S09E09 - And I'm Joyce Kinney  (scene release 9x10)

It would make sense to release the next one as ""e12b"" or ""e12 proper""... then hopefully get them back on track.  Otherwise we'll be having this discussion until the end of the season."
,morrillo,2011-02-23T21:50Z,wait till the end of the season sounds better than read all the stupid comments of retarded people fighting about wich number of episode it is the answer is DOWNLOAD SEED WATCH AND ENJOY
,HeyYou88,2011-02-23T23:07Z,"Just to clarify, this is episode 11 (The German Guy). 

The next one will be episode 12 (The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair)."
,HeyYou88,2011-02-23T23:17Z,"This is 11. Next one is The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair, which is ep12. hope that helps. "
,spunkedunken,2011-02-27T13:26Z,the main problem is that we need to rename all the wrong torrent names to stop the confusion
,aldebaran91,2011-03-02T13:09Z,shut the hell up one time is fine everyone knows by now its 11. e bitches
,Stainers,2011-03-04T07:52Z,Good qual. Possibly the shittest FG eppy tho
,zazally,2011-03-04T15:33Z,Thanks eztv love your work everything you upload is just perfect but being honest Family Guy is starting to suck a lot now the earlier seasons were much better also you never see Stewie that much any more which is disappointing since he is the funniest!
,Sepideh,2011-03-07T08:47Z,"@morrillo

Why should you download an episode you've already seen?"
,Sepideh,2011-03-07T09:03Z,"Yes, this is very much The German Guy, episode 11."
,BayDwella,2012-04-08T12:49Z,thanks
