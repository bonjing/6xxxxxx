These Encounters of Theirs (AKA Quei loro incontri) marks French filmmaker Jean-Marie Straub's final cinematic collaboration with his wife, the late Daniele Huillet. The picture stages a series of five onscreen dialogues between Greek gods about mankind's relationship to the deities (and vice-versa), written by the Communist philosopher Cesare Pavese in "mock classical" language and recited on camera by such amateur Italian actors as Angela Nugara, Vittorio Vigneri, Grazia Orsi, Romano Guelfi, Angela Durantini and Enrico Achilli/ Straub and Huillet stage the dialogues in lush, rural, sunny outdoor environs. The characters include such mythical immortals as Iacchus, Metate and Gaia and such mortals as the poet Hesiod.
