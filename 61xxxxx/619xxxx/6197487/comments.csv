,japhater,2011-12-22T21:29Z,"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you plan on using a average divx or windows media player to play these it wont work :( not even ps3 or xbox will play them. And i mean every Gi joe movie uploaded on this site wont play. Even the blue ray dont. And all your standard rez files wont play unless you download some extra codec's. And its not just this site its all the top sites, all the files are the same its just impossible to get this movie on download without downloading extra crap AGAIN DONT DOWNLOAD  standard files +no sound. And blue ray files just skip the entire way"
