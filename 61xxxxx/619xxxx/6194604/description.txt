                      http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1377278                 
                                                                          
                                                    
                          
                             
                                 
                                                                          
           Intent on shaking up the ultimate 'sacred cow' for Jews,       
           Israeli director Yoav Shamir embarks on a provocative -        
           and at times irreverent - quest to answer the question,        
           "What is anti-Semitism today?" Does it remain a dangerous      
           and immediate threat? Or is it a scare tactic used by          
           right-wing Zionists to discredit their critics? Speaking       
           with an array of people from across the political              
           spectrum (including the head of the Anti-Defamation            
           League and its fiercest critic, author Norman                  
           Finkelstein) and traveling to places like Auschwitz            
           (alongside Israeli school kids) and Brooklyn (to explore       
           reports of violence against Jews), Shamir discovers the        
           realities of anti-Semitism today. His findings are             
           shocking, enlightening and - surprisingly - often wryly        
           funny.
