@scarface
try installing the game using the game.msi file on DVD1â€¦ it should install without asking for the cd-key.
worked for me.

I am far from a noob but I donâ€™t know what FLT means by â€œTitle Updateâ€ folder. Where is that folder? Which â€œsetup.exeâ€ are they talking about? The one in the DVD root folder? Clicking that after installing allows you to click on â€œRepair/Uninstallâ€.. The instructions in this crack are not very clear. Can someone explain further?

@55

You need to download crack & Title Update, you can download from 33 comment or somewhere elseâ€¦
Itâ€™s very clear after thatâ€¦

- Crack it (Copy the ShippingPC-StormGame.exe and the xlive.dll from the Fairlight
folder on the DVD to your installed game dir \Binaries\Win32)

- Delete files ( To install the â€œTitle Updateâ€ you need to delete the following 2 files:
\Binaries\Win32\ShippingPC-StormGame.exe.zdp
\Binaries\Win32\Zdp\ZdpConfig.xml)

- Install Title Update (from setup)
and thatâ€™s it"

Dude, this is NOT stealing. Let me give an example.
When you steal a tomato from a grocery shop the seller lacks one tomato - this is theft. Now, imagine you have got a wonderful cloning machine and you can somehow clone the tomato. The result is that you've got a tomato and the seller's got a tomato, right? Is it stealing? Fuck no! If it was, everyone who grows tomatos would be a thief just because he didn't buy a tomato from a grocery shop. Makes sense?"

,EbilPhish,2011-02-26T07:07Z,"Cracks will commonly get falsely detected as viruses because they will often use the same techniques that viruses use to hide from DRM and do things like run code in an embedded virtual machines

In addition to that, I wouldn't be surprised if software publishers have struck some deal with antivirus companies to deliberately detect cracked software as a virus. I remember Norton used to detect a Photoshop Crack as a 'Hack Tool' (although not a virus or a trojan).

In fact corporate environments will want this detection of cracks to ensure that they don't get fined for piracy, large companies get their software audited by 3rd parties (namely the BSA, 'Business Software Alliance') looking for pirated software, it's a requirement to comply to an audit if you buy licenses from Microsoft, Adobe and so on. There kind of like those companies that go around suing people for file sharing.

Okay, seeing as it's your first time I'll explain:

The game is inside the .ISO file, now you can do one of two things with it:
1) Burn it to a DVD
or
2) Mount the image

Because its so much faster and cheaper, I'll explain (2):
1) Download Virtual clone drive from slysoft:
http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html
2) Install it and create a virtual drive
3) Right click your .ISO file and mount it on the drive you just created
4) Run it like a DVD from my computer
5) Install Bulletstorm
6) Right click the mounted image (the mounted .iso of Bulletstorm) and click open
7) Copy the files inside the folder named 'Fairlight', and paste them into your install directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\EA\Bulletstorm\Binaries\Win32)
8) Play the game.
(launch from C:\Program Files (x86)\EA\Bulletstorm\Binaries\Win32\ShippingPC-StormGame.exe)
And enjoy

Anyone having issues with the Fatal Exception from NVidia drivers, its a known issue with x64 versions of Win7. Here's how I fixed mine! ^_^

Copy all the phsyx DLL files from here:
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common

Then paste/overwrite the Bulletstorm LOCAL Phsyx DLL files to this path

D:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\bulletstorm\Binaries\ Win32\PhysXLocal

This fixed the problem for me, and I hope it helps you!"
,sh0nuff,2011-02-28T06:08Z,"@markmeshark

You need to add the Bulletstorm mounted iso address (for me it was H:/) to your exceptions list in AVG. Then do the same for the EA installed directory. This will allow you to copy the .dll without AVG recognizing it and moving it to the vault. Heres how:

Open the AVG user interface... 

Click Tools->Advance Settings...

Click Resident Shield->Exceptions...

The Add the program (or file, directory) you wish to be excluded from scans..."

If you can't tranfer the xlive.dll file from the download folder, open the iso with Gburner, highlight the xlive file and extract it to desktop. Then tranfer it from desktop to the game folder.

4. ins. the game with this serial: 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111

,deepandhard,2011-03-06T19:23Z,"@EpicGames

Am I to believe that PC gaming will eventually ""go the way of the Dodo"" in a few years???  This is not a new claim made against pc game piracy.  I am not discounting it however.  

But, let reality speak for itself.  I've been gaming longer than I can remember, and I have never felt like I was ""missing out"" because a game came out on console only and not for the PC platform.

Bottom line is this, until PC gaming is no more and all the game titles are exclusively written for consoles, the PC pirate gaming scene will go on.

The PC platform does not owe its existence to game titles.  If the Corporate Money Mongers want to shoot themselves in the back, then they can just unilaterally agree not to create software for the PC platform, including gaming software.

A little friendly advice, EpicGames, don't hold you breath for that to happen.

The only problem I had was my setting always going back to default and the number of newsbots and swarms I destroyed always went back to 0 after I exited the game.  I don't know if there is a fix or not though.

If you have AVG just add xlive crack portion to resident shield exceptions, and then again after it's pasted...you need the exception in that folder too.  It should fix all of your problems.  it worked for me.

If your mouse sensitivity is too high just turn it all the way down, works for me."
,Tyl0rC,2011-03-14T17:02Z,"AVG USERS THIS IS NEEDED!  Not sure about any other Anti-Virus.

1. Open AVG and right click Resident Shield and hit open.

2. Look at the bottom and hit Manage exceptions.

3.  Click Add File and go to where you mounted the CD.  Open the Fairlight folder and click xlive.dll then hit ok.  (So it should say (Whatever drive you used, mine says)L:\Fairlight\xlive.dll

4.  Next follow the instuctions provided by extremezone.

5.  Go back to Manage Exceptions and Add File, and add xlive.dll again.  This time it should look like C:\Program Files\EA\Bulletstorm\Binaries\Win32\xlive.dll

,nielsx1,2011-03-31T16:18Z,"im honestly starting to rage about the process of installing pirated games. I spent hours trying to install bulletstorm and i finally figured it out, then it tells me i have to enter this validation code after making an account on windows live for games or something, which took me about an hour to make due to shit not working. So i look for hints and tips in this comment section, find out i have to set windows live account to offline mode or whatever. 

so i attempt to log on to windows live for games, it tells me to create an XBOX LIVE account and then that is impossible due to the system of the site telling me that there was an error in the system..

WHAT IS GOING ON"

The mouse moves super slowly and unresponsivly, and the game looks like a blur when you try to play because it's impossible to tell what's happening due to the choppy/lagginess. What's wrong? My setup is definitely good enough to play this game...

,DontPissMeOff,2011-07-02T21:55Z,"I gave this game a bad comment at first, but when I started playing in 3D using nVision everything changed. This is IMO the best looking game (in 3D) ever - just after Bad Company 2. There are no double shadows, everything runs smooth and with my GTX560 the FPS (using 3D) is around 40 (720p, max settings). I love the effects of water, slow-mo sniper shots and the girl you meet in Chapter 3."

On another note:
Is this happening to anyone else and how might I fix it?

*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS*
in act 6 chapter 3 (ponderin dem bodies)
after you are tricked into arming the bomb and you have to leash open the vent and climb through to escape. The only problem is..... I don't. I leash it open, hit [R] to climb in grey hoist himself up and then just drops back onto the ground of the bomb room while Ishi goes on through talking to me like nothing is wrong.

Any ideas, this is kinda game breaking.

,Banzay27,2011-09-07T23:13Z,"Works fine with this release, FLT's title updater in the iso and Skidrow's crack files from:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6197813/Bulletstorm.Proper-SKIDROW-CrackOnly

They say FLT's cracks don't cut it. Didn't bother risking it; I know Skidrow's good for it.

I also learned I have a VCard that isn't specifically supported by the game, and after looking for it, I found a fix to the relatively glitched graphics, at:
http://forums.epicgames.com/showthread.php?t=764775

Simple .ini replacements worked for me. Strangely that changed the video config ingame, but I altered those there again and it still ran fine since then.

Game itself, on the other hand... expected better. It's fun, kicking muties into spikes 'n everything, but that plot and dialog..."
,pushkaryadav,2011-09-11T19:31Z,"thanks you for the upload extreme 
finished the already and faced no problem at all

thanks a million :DDD"
,Pezomi,2011-09-25T23:56Z,"Worked Perfect, just follow the directions.  I use an 64 bit computer and it works fine. Reallly good game, thanks for another great upload extremezone. Seeded about 22GB then quit. "
,tackfurlo,2011-10-01T04:52Z,"Two things:

1) The game DOES work.  If you want to save settings (really just key configs) get SKIDROW's crack and use it instead of the included crack.  But the game DOES work.  Win7 x64 ASUS G72 Laptop.

2) The game has virtually no lag on any good system.  That said, the menu lags like a bitch.  Once you get into the actual game, the lag magically disappears, but your cursor will probably lag horribly while navigating the menu.  You'll spend a total of 30 seconds in the menu so just get over it.

Awesome torrent, awesome game.  Also note this game has no competitive multiplayer (even if you buy it) only co-op, so if you don't have (many FPS loving) friends, you're missing nothing at all by torrenting this.  That said, I bought it.  I haven't even opened the damn box, still playing the cracked version, but I feel like this is the first FPS I've played in at least 2 or 3 YEARS that wasn't a blatant copy of either CoD or Halo, neither of which I enjoy.  The skillshots get repetitive near the end of the game, but that isn't to say they aren't enjoyable.  Nothing I've played in my entire life compares to the pure feeling of awesome you get from the ""Mass Extinction"" skillshot.  I won't say anything more to avoid spoilers but seriously...awesome game!

Also, despite a near-total lack of maturity in any other aspect (a strong point of the game IMHO) the female companion, Trishka, is one of the few female characters in any FPS with genuine depth.  She's hot, yes, but seems to be a well-done spinoff franchise waiting to happen.  And she's dressed like a commando.  Not a beach volleyball commando, a real world person-who-could-kill-you-500-ways-from-sunday-just-like-a-man commando.  Seriously, there's a lot of character there.  Note I'm a guy and I've played enough FPS's that the bar for what I consider ""depth"" in female characters isn't very high, but she's clearly over it."

,daaabou,2012-04-16T16:59Z,"OK I solved the Live login problem.
You have to know (and it's written on the .NFO) that you must create an OFFLINE account on Live. I'm no specialist, but I know that, a few years ago, when I clicked on ""create new profile"" on the Live bullshit, a screen appeared where I had the choice to create an offline account. Today it's no the case anymore, or maybe it's because of windows 7. However I read above a way to force Live to allow us to get this screen back: just delete Live in c:/windows/system32 or/and c:/windows/sysWOW64 (in my case it was in sysWOW64), then reinstall the game following the cracker's instructions, an this time when Live screen appears, if you click on ""create new profile"" a new kind of 'text window' appears and on this one you can choose ""create offline account"". Do it, a few screens without importance will appear and then you'll arrive on the game main menu."
