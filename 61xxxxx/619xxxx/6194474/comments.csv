,chrispm84,2011-03-21T02:42Z,"Damned Gigantus... Rant much? You shouldn't comment while high... It makes you look stupid. If you don't like the format, then don't download it. Some people may be using old computers that can't handle converting videos and require them to be converted for them. Maybe they don't have dvd burners and have to find a certain file type that'll play on their 360s/PS3s... I mean, you can't just take your own situation and assume that you are the be all end all of everyone's needs. So, stop being a selfish prick and find another copy already... Damn..."
