,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T10:01Z,I am seeding now
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T10:29Z,seed please
,aarque,2011-02-23T12:37Z,"OMG, I am so glad they fixed the whole overheating brakes thing - I was worried they'd never get to it. 

Seriously though, rewrote the brake algorithm? That is a little incongruous with the normal development process. Even if users were complaining vehemently on the forums about brake failure...I mean who even HAS toe brakes that can apply 50% pressure? Much less expose a deficiency in the braking algorithm. Oh and spool-up from 32 fake to 60 realistic seconds - whew!

The whole thing sounds weird. No offense but I think it's time to move on to the next plane, or at least fix something useful like the screwed up view key assignments."
,martronn,2011-02-23T12:48Z,but now you not seeding. got full stop at 43% here??
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T12:53Z,those who have finished downloading. plz seed
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T12:54Z,"there is some problem in my network, I am unable to seed. 0.0 KB ps.

you all have to wait for few hours until I deal with the problem. I bet within 12-13 hors, all of you have finished downloading, I am very sorry for this."
,aarque,2011-02-23T13:05Z,"Thanks as always, by the way, for the share."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T13:23Z,"I got rid of the problem, I am seeding now"
,martronn,2011-02-23T14:54Z,got it now. seeding max. but seems like you cant have AirbusX installed at the same time?? it just asks you to delete the previous verson?
,martronn,2011-02-23T14:59Z,and i don't think this one work so well... all the planes are missing the tail! no rudder at all
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T15:11Z,thank you for seeding
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T15:12Z,you probably have done something martronn
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-23T15:27Z,inform me if it's not working. I will upload another torrent with the installed RIP.
,martronn,2011-02-23T15:46Z,got the problem solwed! :-) was a loading glitch on first startup. so now am on the wings at 250ft. NvidiaPhynX: thanks a lot for this upload. love the bird now that everything is working.

,Humrod,2011-02-25T14:57Z,"Thanks for your work.
@martronn: I'm facing the problem with the instaled airbus X; how you solve it?
have to uninstall airbus X first?"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-25T16:51Z,"I forgot to mention that you have to uninstall airbus x, but I am assuming that you fly one plane at a time, so when needed you can reinstall it and vice versa. I apologize for this."
,aca88_2k9,2011-02-25T22:37Z,"haha yeh.. i got the a300 to work too its not bad lol.. but its good to get all aerosofts product cracked :) .. i use aj oystick and a mouse as yoke.. sometimes i go to skool and i use a mouse to fly which im use to :), anyhow the airbusx was a FAIL.. god u gota get joystick, gotta put in drivers.. it was a headach.. now their CRJ.. wow let me guess u gotta use mind control or blow on it to move the plane -_-.. lol another fail.. aerosoft is going down,. and i hope they will never succeed again :)

have a good one "
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-26T03:23Z,"aerosoft products are shit. Although they make them look good but the problem is that whole aircraft is an arcade simulator, not like pmdg, who make an airplane with all the real world procedures."
,Capt.Jambo,2011-02-26T04:24Z,"Thanx a lot NvidiaPhysX and Jet canada for this bird, haven't tested it yet, but will report back after testing."
,GWBushJnr,2011-02-26T12:25Z,Thanks for the download.
,Capt.Jambo,2011-02-27T02:53Z,"Well guys, I have tested this bird and it works great! everything seems to work as it should. The only glitch was that I had to uninstall Airbus X before instaling Simcheck. The message ""please uninstall previous version..."" Other than that 5 star Upload, I don't fly the airbus x anyway...

PLUR"
,A380-800,2011-02-27T17:59Z,"Im happy that i don't buy Aerosoft products they can't handel there own activation servers lol.
People use W7SP1 can't activate products seems they fix it now but still ridiculous that you cannot activate a product.

I hate DRM activations not comsumer friendly."
,Radioactivityism,2011-03-05T01:08Z,"Thanks for the addon!

@pcgames
You're Fucking spammer."
,SaniaNET,2011-03-15T18:03Z,Can you upload  2.01 (SP2b) update? at least the installer w/o password . Thanks
,ronin900,2011-03-21T15:41Z,"NvidiaPhysX thanks for this torrent....i have only 1 question. Why i can not use the applications like livery installer, aircraft configuration etc.......?"
,BlacJac,2011-04-06T01:42Z,thanks!!!   Request Wilco Tower! 2011
