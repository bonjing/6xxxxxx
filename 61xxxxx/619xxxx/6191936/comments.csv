Other than Lan, works great and very compact install."
,pdxjason,2011-04-14T00:32Z,"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMMAND AND CONQUER GENERALS TORRENT RIGHT HERE!!!

it was so easy to install, all you hit is setup right in the beginning folder(dont bother extracting the rar files, it does this by itself) and after the ms-dos install, bam you got a working generals and afterhour game in your program file list.

I will continue seeding so others have access.

Norton confirmed virus free, and works flawlessly on windows 7 without needing to run compatibility mode."
,pdxjason,2011-04-14T00:34Z,"UPDATE to previous comment: both games work great, but for some reason multiplayer doesnt seem to work...

if anyone has a fix, feel free to post.

But i am enjoying the single player and skirmish modes for the time being!

:D"
,gira89,2011-04-16T03:24Z,None of the games work for me. :/
,gira89,2011-04-16T03:30Z,"Disclaimer: Made it work by running the game files as administrator, and XP SP3 compability mode."
,Frostly,2011-04-20T00:59Z,Thanks works great

,Pogie4,2011-05-10T03:45Z,"Do you want to play Multiplayer it's Easy you need Tunngle or Hamachi to play online.. I used tunggle because its easy! Do you want Tunngle/Hamachi Search in google.
There's a problem of Zero Hour search this:

Go to the facebook and search my name Jad P. Padriga then Photos then click Bug from any games and you'll see the bugs!

Sorry for the many comments (You know what I mean,right??)"
,Pogie4,2011-05-10T13:57Z,What version is the shockwave??
,MaRu_TinG,2011-05-12T06:33Z,i cant play zero hr!!!!

,kruugar,2011-06-15T01:30Z,"Can't get it to work.

Get a ""serious error has occured""  after the screen goes blank on load with a few coloured lines vertically."
,Shadw0289,2011-07-25T10:36Z,"Hi, I have windows 7, Generals is working perfectly...but when i run Zero Hour it says ""Please insert the first game CD"".......Whats the problem???"
,Shadw0289,2011-07-25T11:03Z,"Ok...the problem is solved and zero hour is also running, i was previously installing the game to a drive other than C, now i have installed it to C:Program files and Zero Hour is working fine. Thnx for the upload. Cheers."
,ChrisPerry,2011-08-15T17:03Z,"Great Torrent, thanks. On Window 7 I had the ""Please insert disk 1""Message when trying to play Zero Hour. Run as Administrator and in compatibility mode for XP SP3 to get rid of it."
,solomoneKane,2011-12-07T04:05Z,"this is a great torrent thanks a-noh-nee-mouse lol, the install instructions were in spanish but that wasnt a problem at all and this game works great"

,misswent,2011-12-11T01:20Z,"If administrator and compatibility options don't work:

-go to my documents
-open c&c generals data
-make new text document named: options.ini

copy the following in options.ini

AntiAliasing = 4
BuildingOcclusion = yes
CampaignDifficulty = 1
DrawScrollAnchor = yes
DynamicLOD = no
ExtraAnimations = yes
Gamma = 50
HeatEffects = yes
IdealStaticGameLOD = high
LanguageFilter = true

UseShadowDecals = yes
UseShadowVolumes = no

save as and select all files
it now should be a configuration settings document (with a little cogwheel in pictogram)

now it should work, if generals works this way, copy the doc and put in c&C zero hour data file as well, zero hour should work this way too!


I'm a computer-illiterate so sorry for any vague explanations, but I made it work so you can too!
(and totally got the solution from someone else)"
