Both video and audio quality were great. I don't much care for the mkv format, but who cares when the quality is so good?"
,devpat,2011-05-08T19:54Z,"thanks YIFY for all your hardwork...
i didn't care much about the size as the movie is 2 hrs. 23 min. long... and i got it for free...

Really, really awesome considering how much insignificant space this movie takes on my hard disk.

A million thanks, YIFY !

It would be great if you could get the 720p of the ***SIMILAR SIZE*** for Basic Instinct (1992), Mission Impossible-3, Face-Off (1997) and Cast Away (2000). I will be keeping tabs on you for this. Please try...
