gives the winning team a big advantage at this week's weigh-in, 

which is especially valuable given that both a red line and a

contestant Rulon Gardner's former trainer, retired UFC 

heavyweight champion Bas Rutten. Then a weigh-in filled with 

surprises is followed by two contestants leaving the ranch
