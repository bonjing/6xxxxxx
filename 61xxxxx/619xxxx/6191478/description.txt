               Take a journey through a medieval world of swordsmen and magic,
        where witches have been hunted and brutally exterminated.
        Knights Contract follows the twisted tale of Heinrich, an immortal
        executioner, and Gretchen, a resurrected witch. Once the victim of
        Heinrich\'s blade by the order of the game\'s antagonist, Dr. Faust,
        Gretchen now has him by her side and the two must work together to
        rid the land of the supernatural foes who are cursing its people
        with the black spell of death.

                Ã²Sword & Sorcery - Combine Heinrich\'s razor sharp scythe
                and Gretchen\'s explosive witchcraft in battle to devastate
                enemies with fluid, fast-paced combinations to ultimately
                return civility to the land

                Ã²A guardian knight - As the Immortal executioner, players
                must team up with and protect Gretchen against hideous
                creatures and unspeakable evil as her magical prowess and
                mortality are the key to the duo\'s survival

                Ã²An unlikely duo - Heinrich, an executioner loyal to the law,
                was made to kill the witch Gretchen, who in her final moments
                cursed him with immortal life. Gretchen has been mysteriously
                resurrected and Heinrich, under contract, now fights alongside
                her as her guardian

                Ã²Medieval style - Explore a beautifully recreated 17th century
                Europe amidst the lore of witches and magic where people are
                crippled by fear and wide-spread panic runs rampant
