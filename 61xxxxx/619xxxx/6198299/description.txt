Interspace Showdown

It has been one year since the Battle Brawlers freed Nethia from Gundalia's invasion. The Battle Brawlers have returned to Earth, and Marucho has turned control of Bakugan Interspace over to the computer so he can compete freely. Dan, Shun, and Marucho have formed a team together, and Dan is ranked #1 in the World. However new mysterious Brawlers are popping up to challenge Dan and Drago, and Dan and Drago keep having dreams of a mysterious Bakugan they don't know that wants to steal Drago's powers to take over the universe. Believing them to be only nightmares, Dan accepts a battle from the #2 ranked team- Team Anubis, but the powers Drago ends up unleashing could end up harming everyone in Interspace if they aren't careful.
