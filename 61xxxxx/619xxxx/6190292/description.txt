"You Debt Your Life"

When Stan and Roger disagree over a recent 
string of events, Roger moves out of the 
house in protest but is quickly replaced by 
another warm body. After Roger learns of the 
replacement roomie, the two of them battle 
for Stan's affection. Meanwhile, Steve gets 
a new job at school that allows him to do a 
little self-promotion over the P.A. system.

Enjoy :)
