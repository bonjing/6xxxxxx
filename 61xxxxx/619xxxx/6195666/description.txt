Plot:
The film begins in Honolulu, Hawaii, with someone dumping large containers into the ocean and then going to meet with a few guys in suits expecting to get paid. But because he dumped the containers and altered the schedule of those container shipments to the customer, he is killed.

We are then taken underwater in the blue ocean as Sebastian (Chris Carmack) and his girlfriend Dani (Laura Vandervoort) are dive surfing with a model. We learn that the group own a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients. Sebastian doesn't want to do this line of work forever.

For Sebastian, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship San Cristobal, which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a lot of treasure.

Sebastian believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life.
