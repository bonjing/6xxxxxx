"Angry Dad: The Movie"

Bart's cartoon about an angry dad is turned 
into "Angry Dad: The Movie" and quickly 
becomes a critics' favorite. When Russell 
Brand (guest-voicing as himself) presents 
the Golden Globe to Bart's film, Homer 
usurps the podium and gives his own 
acceptance speech. The film's winning 
streak continues with Homer taking credit at 
each ceremony, so when "Angry Dad" receives 
an Oscar nomination, Bart keeps it a secret. 
With the help of DJ Kwanzaa (guest voice 
Smoove), Homer and Marge arrive at the 
ceremony just as Halle Berry (guest-voicing 
as herself) presents the award. Bart's 
fellow nominee, Nick Park (guest-voicing as 
himself), helps him realize that creating a 
film is a team effort, and Bart gives credit 
where credit is due.

Enjoy :)
