"What Up, Cuz?"

Virginia's cousin Delilah (guest star Sedaris), 
who struggles to make ends meet, pays a visit 
to the Chance family unannounced, determined to 
claim her share of Maw Maw's ,whom she thinks 
died years ago, estate. Further tension builds 
when Delilah admits she still has a crush on 
Burt. Meanwhile, Jimmy babysits Maw Maw and 
panics when she takes off on Sabrina's moped.

Enjoy :)
