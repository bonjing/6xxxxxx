Brittany Ann is a 19-year-old singer/songwriter from Easton, Pennsylvania. A lifelong singer and folk music enthusiast, she picked up the guitar around the age of 10â€¦and it was love. Now a sophomore at Temple University, she is taking the Philly scene by storm with her trademark ethereal melodies, intricate finger-picking, and â€œwise beyond her yearsâ€ lyrics.

Brittany has shared stages with artists such as Tom Paxton, Liz Longley, Anthony da Costa, Carsie Blanton, and Dala. She has played in many of the Northeastâ€™s finest venues, including World Cafe Live, Godfrey Danielâ€™s, Musikfest, The Bitter End, Steel City Coffee, and Chaplinâ€™s Music Cafe. In February â€™09, she played a formal showcase at the International Folk Alliance Conference in Memphis, and in July â€™09 she participated in the Winnipeg Folk Festivalâ€™s Young Performerâ€™s Program.

Her debut album â€œThe Good in Thatâ€, which she recorded at Morningstar Studios in Spring House, PA with Grammy-winning producer Glenn Barratt, will be released this fall. She plans to tour extensively this upcoming year to promote it.

Brittany currently performs with Paige Setzer, a Celtic harp player. The two of them together have been described by audiences as â€œpositively entrancing.â€

â€œThis young lady is the future of folk musicâ€
-Gene Shay, WXPN and the Philadelphia Folksong Society

â€œThis teenage singer-songwriter is one part Joni Mitchell and one part Natalie Merchantâ€“ the perfect combination of acoustic soul and ethereal melodiesâ€
-Amy Stetts and Dustin Schoof, The Express Times

â€œBrittanyâ€™s tunes chronicle emotional experiences in her teenage life, set to intricate finger-picked guitar lines and sung in a voice so poised that itâ€™s hard to believe her parents still have to drive her to showsâ€
