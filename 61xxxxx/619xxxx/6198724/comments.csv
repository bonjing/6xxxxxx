,Bob__Dole,2011-02-25T03:24Z,"same question as larrybomb, why's TPB search broken?  There isn't even a season 2 category in the TV listings.

Good thing we have eztv, i found this by checking the eztv u/l.

ODDLY, if you search for ""Justified S02E03"", it finds it."

,phinex333,2011-04-20T19:34Z,The reason you cannot find anything from season 2 is because most are labeled S02E0 whatever and because the season is still going so no one has bought the set to upload it
,izwotitiz,2012-03-28T20:31Z,Thanks for sharing.......appreciated!
