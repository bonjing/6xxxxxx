Jason is being accused by his mother-in-law, Melody, of molesting his now 5-year-old daughter. Jasonâ€™s wife, Karen, believes her husband is innocent and says she hates her mother for making what she thinks is a completely false accusation. Jason, whoâ€™s been investigated and cleared by Child Protective Services two times previously, agrees to take a polygraph test to prove his innocence once and for all.
