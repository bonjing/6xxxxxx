Set in 1872, the story focuses on Passepartout, a Chinese thief who steals a valuable 
jade Buddha and then seeks refuge in the traveling companionship of an eccentric 
London inventor and adventurer, Phileas Fogg, who has taken on a bet with members 
of his gentlemen's club that he can make it around the world in a mere 80 days, 
using a variety of means of transportation, like boats, trains, balloons, elephants, 
etc. Along the way, Passepartout uses his amazing martial arts abilities to defend 
Fogg from the many dangers they face.. One major threat to their adventure is a 
detective that's following them. Why? Just as Fogg and Passeportout left London, 
a major bank was robbed, with Fogg suspected of using the "around the world" trip 
as an excuse to escape.. Their path from London and back includes stops in 
Paris, Turkey, India, China and USA.
