Jesper Kyd is a fantastic composer.
His work on assassin's creed is a true master piece, a modern opera.

The tracklisting of the official Brotherhood soundtrack is really good, but only reflect a tiny part of his work.

I basically did a whole playthrough with only the music pumped to max and the subtitles displayed. I had a blast doing it. Most of the time I would stay in one place and listen to the music until it would loop.

method used:
I hooked up the optical digital output of my PS3 to a Sony Dolby certified amplifier, and used it to downmix to stereo the 5.1 signal.
From there I hooked up into my computer, and recorded into wav files using direct-to-disc.
I then used Audacity 1.3beta to trim silences, and to do fade in and/or out when needed.
I tried to retain the original wav as maximum as possible, my objective was to just rip, no more.
Everything was done in CD quality (44Khz, 16bit Stereo)
MP3 encoding was done using lame's highest setting, in 320 constant bitrate, full stereo (not joint).
All mp3 tracks are properly and thoroughly id3v2 tagged.

99 tracks, total duration: 3h42


The tracks are more or less in the chronological order of a playthrough

All credits go to the fantastic Jesper. I admire his work, and enjoy the music big time. I'm sure you do too.
