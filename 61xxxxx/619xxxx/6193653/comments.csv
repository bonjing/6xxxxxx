,kingsweeting,2011-02-23T14:17Z,"The Download speeds are predictably slow with so many peers, but very consistent... More seeds would be good, but I think no one even has the game downloaded to seed yet, says i could have the game done in 1-2 days straight, hopefully the speeds will pick up by then. After 12 hours i'm 16% through. I will seed for a few days after."
