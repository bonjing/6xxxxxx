,pb_s4,2011-02-23T10:37Z,still no english subs yet?
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-23T11:13Z,"@pb_s4: Inside the torrent is just very short .srt for few lines spoken on non-English language (I haven't watched movie yet).

Unfortunately, full-length subs cannot be found. In next few days, maybe..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-23T11:20Z,"@highres99: Maybe?

(kidding). Sorry. You know it's 2010 already, and why do have urge to bitch-slap someone?
Are mistakes punishable even more  than to open myself to all kinds of insults just this morning?

But, you don't give a shit, right?"

,jiveclive,2011-02-23T13:10Z,"No surprise, in this film it shows that some of the major dickheads that had a part in fucking the world over got hired by the cunt Obama to fix the problem. And that's gonna happen when water flows uphill. On the plus side the USA is going down the shitter and that's gonna be good for the world in the long run. Yay!"

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-23T16:25Z,"@highres99: I have done small, plain, stupid mistake - regarding few thousand of uploads I have negligent percent of errors or mistakes. Maybe few in years... and I just want you all to respect that.

Aside for doing all this and risking my freedom and my life just for other people...

Just that. A respect. If I do a mistake, help, don't bitch-slap me."
,highres99,2011-02-23T16:25Z,"@thaus: wtf!, r u 20-40, or r u to decide if one can request for something from someone after mistakenly offending them. i dont know yr religion, but in mine, you can ask God to forgive you and at the same time ask Him for His Favors immediately after that. so if anyone has fucked up today, it's YOU, my brother. i suggest you go get another court to jest in, you court jester!
and btw, next time let the person being referred to respond and thank God 20-40 ain't like you, and i'm sure yr comment ain't gonna influence his judgment. Peace!!!"

Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-25T18:50Z,I watched the movie today. Question arise: How could people give every single thing to complete psychopaths? Why people think that these creatures which took lives of humanity in their hands - are sane human beings?
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-25T18:57Z,"Bankers and all financial wizards are psychopaths. To my knowledge, all serial killers, all true villains throughout human history never were disposed nor recognized as such by their neighbors, friends and relatives... "
