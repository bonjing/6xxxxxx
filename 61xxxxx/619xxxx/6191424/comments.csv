,weaping_reaper,2011-03-25T00:24Z,Do these have subs for non-english parts only?
,weaping_reaper,2011-03-28T01:40Z,No subs for Non-English parts only :-(
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-08T21:01Z,Excellent quality but no subs for foreign language. The only thing I can think of is to watch the movie and remove everything from the .srt file that is not associated with the English language.
