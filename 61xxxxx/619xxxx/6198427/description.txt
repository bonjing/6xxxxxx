"Regrets Only"

Phil and Claire had a huge fight and Phil 
hasn't a clue as to what it was over, so 
Gloria steps in to counsel Phil and Jay takes 
Claire. Meanwhile, Jay may have some regret 
in buying Gloria a karaoke machine, and 
Cameron is in full prep mode for a huge 
fundraising event and enlists help from 
Mitchell and Luke -- which might not be the 
best choices.

Enjoy :)
