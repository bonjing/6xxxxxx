Basically you need to download the MKV codec and though you can play in WMP and other players once the codec is installed it is recommended that you use the VLC player. Just thought I'd point that out since the description mentions XviD in the video info line.

Only just got into VLC, AutoGK, DVD Decrypter and have realised that I made that comment in complete ignorance about the subject of DVD ripping. MKV is cool and my reference to Xvid is not correct or relevant.

Sorry Sadbawang- In the future I'll do my research on any file extensions that I don't know about.  Keep up the good work."
