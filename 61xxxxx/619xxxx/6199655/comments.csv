This movie had everything the script was interesting, Kevin Bacon did a good role. 

However the overall acting in the movie gives the movie its low score, and you get a feeling the script is somewhat rushed. 

The movie gets a score slightly above average, since its a great (but not near die hard 1 or 2 :P) Action flick but without the brainless bambam.

DonĂÂ´t get me wrong now there is quite some brainless action and people dying but at least our hero has a reason, somewhat light in a dark kind of way."
