Horse In The Sea is the moniker for the lyrical and musical compositions of Joel Janis. Since its inception in 2007, the project has been produced and engineered by Nashville producer and recording artist Kyle Andrews. Janis and Andrews first met in grade school and began trading demo cassette tapes in the mid-1990s.

Horse In The Seaâ€™s debut album, â€œI Order The Sun To Shine On Everyoneâ€ was released in December 2007 to critical acclaim. Substantiating reviews came from media outlets such as the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Reader, Time Out Chicago, and countless blogs. This modest self-release, recorded in the bandâ€™s basement, has sold over 15,000 downloads. The album singles, â€œVegasâ€ and â€œI Order The Sun,â€ continue to receive airplay support from Chicago radio stations such as WXRT and Q101. Horse in the Sea has played over 200 shows in support of this album, including multiple sold-out performances in Chicago.

The band is currently working on their highly-anticipated 2010 release, entitled Grieve. Grieve is a conceptual sound recording based on people afflicted with and affected by psychological disorders. The first single, â€œPaint The Walls New Colorsâ€ is available for free download on the bandâ€™s Facebook page, and this spring, the band will be shooting a music video for â€Paint the Wallsâ€ in California. The album will feature a unique piece of visual and graphic art for every song, curated by the artist of the compilation Dark Was The Night, Ryan Feerer.
