WikiLeaks.ch CableGate update for February 20th, 2011, 9:31 PM.


This cablegate-201102202131.7z file is 10.9 MB (11,468,855 bytes) in size, and expands to 405 MB (417,628,926 bytes), containing 6,678 files in 137 folders.


If you're seeding an older CableGate torrent, seed this instead.  The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html (or better yet http://wikileaks.ch/magnet.txt which is updated first)  The IP for this domain is 213.251.145.96.

If you run a local WikiLeaks "pull" / "scrape" mirror (search P2P networks for "wikileaks scrape"), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or p7zip for any operating system.

The bad guys can put up blocks to all known / major HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!
