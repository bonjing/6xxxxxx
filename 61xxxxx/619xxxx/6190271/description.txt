        In a happy suburban neighborhood surrounded by white           
        picket fences with flowering rose bushes, sits a black         
        house with a dead lawn. Unbeknownst to the neighbors,           
        hidden beneath this home is a vast secret hideout.              
        Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru,         
        planning the biggest heist in the history of the world.        
        He is going to steal the moon. (Yes, the moon!) Gru            
        delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal           
        of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles          
        for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his            
        way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of           
        three little orphaned girls who look at him and see            
        something that no one else has ever seen: a potential           
        Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his              
        greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo,
