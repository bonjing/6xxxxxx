After winning another BAFTA for their hit sitcom, Lyman's Boys, Sean and Beverly Lincoln are approached by American television executive Merc Lapidus who woos them into re-creating their sitcom for an American audience. After initial hesitation, they decide to accept his offer and make the journey from London to Los Angeles. On their first day in pre-production Sean and Beverly are told that Julian Bullard, who stars in the British series of Lyman's Boys, will need to re-audition for the American adaptation. They also learn that Merc has lied to them and has never even seen an episode of their show. Bullard is not given the job and Matt LeBlanc is given the role instead.

Plot:

British-bred writer-producers, Beverly and Sean Lincoln, have it good. A wonderful marriage and a hit TV series to their credit. Things couldn't be better. Until, Merc Lapidus, a Hollywood big shot in charge of a network, gushes over their series at a social gathering. Merc is certain that a remake of the show will go over well with an American audience. After a lucrative offer, the Lincolns pack up and ship out to The States. It doesn't take long for them to figure out, that Hollywood is a place where deals are made and broken in the same breath. They find themselves holding on tight, as creative control of their project starts to slip from their hands. It has been brought to their attention, that "You don't say no to Merc". To add insult to injury, the original star of the show is tossed out for actor, Matt LeBlanc, a charming, yet, manipulative beast, with a grocery list of demands. LA is not what the Lincolns had in mind, but Sean believes he can swim with the sharks. As for Beverly, she'd rather go back to the UK, than deal with these Episodes.
