[b][i][color=red]Typical Castle suspense shocker with a nice premise about a couple of silly teenage girls (Garrett, Lane) who while away the tedium of babysitting by making hoax phone calls ('I saw what you did! I know who you are!'), but unfortunately chance on a psycho (Ireland) who has just done away with his wife. A few chilling moments, but it all depends on your susceptibility. In spite of her star billing, Crawford - given to appearing in this type of film in the later stages of her career - has a supporting role, and makes a violent exit as an overwrought mistress jealously trying to blackmail the psycho into marrying her...


Libby e Kit, due ragazzini, si divertono a fare scherzi telefonici agli sconosciuti, componendo numeri a caso, ed a chi risponde al telefono sussurrano "Ho visto cosa hai fatto, e so chi sei!" Sfortunatamente telefonano ad un uomo che ha appena ucciso sua moglie...[/color][/i][/b]
