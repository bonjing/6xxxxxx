,firefoxinc,2011-02-23T22:39Z,"Graf_chokolo, who has contributed countless things to the PS3 scene, had his private home raided by police this morning. They confiscated all of his ""accounts"" and anything related to PS3 hacking. Some of you may remember that graf_chokolo promised if he was pushed, that he would release all of his PS3 hypervisor knowledge to the world. He kept good on this promise releasing what is being dubbed as the Hypervisor Bible. ""The uploaded files contains his database which is a series of tools for the PS3â€²s Hypervisor and Hypervisor processes. It will help other devs to reverse engineer the hypervisor of PS3 further.""
