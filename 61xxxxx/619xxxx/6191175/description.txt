In today's Mail on Sunday newspaper you will find a fantastic FREE CD of classic love songs 
by Elvis Presley.

Elvis was one of musicâ€™s great romantics and this brilliant 15-track CD â€“ Elvis Love Songs
includes some of his greatest and best-loved recordings. Love wasnâ€™t the first emotion 
inspired by the 20-year-old Elvis when he exploded on to American TV screens in early 1956.

There was certainly plenty of lust but also rage and indignation, 
depending on peopleâ€™s attitude to rock â€™nâ€™ roll.
