[V],oneanight,2011-02-21T18:43Z,"FYI rubicon7. You know the funny thing is I can't do anything about the mastering of this CD..

Take it in the spirit it was given a freebie from a newspaper that's all. I've known top 10 CDs to have this problem as well..

that's why I provide with all my posts complete artwork and complete good logs..

and yes we can all use applications to test anything now days, if all of it was MPEG or would agree with you but it isn't.

Keep your chin up rubicon7 its sunny outside..:)
