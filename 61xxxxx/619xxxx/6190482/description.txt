Once Upon a Time... Man (French: Il Ã©tait une foisï¿½â‚¬ï¿½ l'homme) is a French animated TV series from 1978 directed by Albert BarillÃ©. The series explains world history in a format designed for children. The action focuses around one group. The same familiar characters appear in all episodes as they deal with the problems of their time.
The show's introduction and ending famously use Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. Shortening the piece to only 2 minutes in length, the introduction uses the very beginning, which jumps into the start of the middle section and finally the dramatic ending to coincide with the destruction of Earth at the end of the intro.
