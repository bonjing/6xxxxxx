The Very Best
Aerosmith (2007)

Known for an aggressively rhythmic style as rooted in James Brown funk as in traditional blues, Aerosmith were the top American hard-rock band of the mid-Seventies. After drug problems and internal dissension nearly destroyed the group, Aerosmith mounted a spectacular comeback in the 1980s. Despite a considerably more commercially slick and power-ballad oriented sound than theyGGÃ©Â¼GÃ¤Ã³d first emerged with, frequently drawing on outside songwriters, they managed to became even more popular the second time around.
