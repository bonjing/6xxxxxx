like all Dummies books, Upgrading & Fixing PCs for Dummies, Third Edition, shows you what
you absolutely need to know and little more--but in very clear
language. Oriented toward casual users who want to solve specific
problems, the book pays attention to such troubles as parity error
messages and out-of-memory warnings.
