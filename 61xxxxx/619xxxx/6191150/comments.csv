Stop trolling around.You know what i mean.I saw that you guys have solve the problem, but hopefully i won't  see you get involve in ""flamewars"" once more.
TPB=trusted user(s) should known better that this.

,ge1453,2011-02-21T15:35Z,it works perfect for NIS 2011 ana NORTON 360 V5 and extend the trial period to 180 days thanks a lot
,gurmsin,2011-02-21T17:14Z,"Rupert77: You must be an idiot. You're flaming other users' posts and do self-advertising. And you  duplicate other people's files. Shame on you! I've difficulties to understand how such a monster like you are regardes as a ""trusted user"", but I've never trusted you. And I'll never download your things, keep them for yourself. RobbingHood is much better than you.

Btw, from the post above I assume you've not pre-tested your own torrent before uploading, how lame isn't that?! You're saying it works fine, but simply without doing the test. "

Just shut the fuck up. If you don't have anything better to say, then don't say anything at all.

Crack works like a charm for me. 
Thanks, Rupert."

A friend of mine told me that there is an NTR increasing  the trial period for Norton 360 v5 to 360 days  (or a combination 90+90+180). Do you know something about this?
thanks a lot for the nice torrents "
,quietcity,2011-03-04T09:03Z,"Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I have a strange feeling that I have already seen such a torrent here on this site... May be just the uploader was someone else... ;-)  "
,god...,2011-04-10T20:54Z,"IT DID WORK...LEGIT
..although i got 120 days of subscription..which is more den enough,:)

ps : i had 29 days of subscription left for my Norton AV .. MayBe i should av created a new A/c For the Trial..as i Used an old one..might be the reason (for 120days sub)..

many thanks for this UP...u rock..+1 for u mate !"
,some0ne2,2011-04-12T05:35Z,"Thanks Rupert77. :)
Worked perfectly, extended my 30 day trial to 180 days, and live updates seem to be working fine as well!

One question though, will I be able to use the trial reset again (how many times I want)?
(For ex: I have N360 Premier Edition v5.0 installed that has 180 days of evaluation. When I have 30 days or less of evaluation left, would I be able to run the trial reset again and it'll turn back into 180 days? Or, if this method would work, uninstall Norton N360 completely and install it again, then use the trial reset to make it 180 days again?"
,some0ne2,2011-04-13T04:47Z,"Rupert77@
Holy crap, thanks a lot, +1'd the torrent a few days ago and today!
Finally, I don't have to worry about antivirus's key/license expiration date, so no more key/license hunting for certain antivirus programs/internet security programs! :D

Just a quick question I ask people, what internet security does the best job protecting your computer? (In your opinion or from reviews about the product)"
,TheAslan,2011-04-17T19:12Z,"So you're saying that Kaspersky is good, for me it said that my explorer.exe file contains a virus though it was a windows default file....i think it's the most worse security provider ever made!"

,rawluck,2011-07-17T03:21Z,"@posting idiotic comments

At least someone there is putting his effort and time creating and uploading, why can't u at least appreciate this fact, what are u giving them in return, nothing. Be constructive.

Thanx for the upload. Great."

Also does anyone know a working Kaspersky Link. All help with be appreciated. And do please reply cause whenever I ask a question I never get a reply."
,mrnexus,2011-08-13T20:42Z,"@jabire3,it does work again m8,i could'nt find the crack i had installed so i read rupert77s notes and i found the crack in my Quartine,so i disconnected from the net turned off  norton tamper protection for 15 mins and right clicked on the trial reset and it just give me another 120 days to evulate the product etc this is my 2nd time doing it so it seems to work hope that helps u,ps make sure that u uninstall the previous crack before u do it again its either in ur c:drive or norton has put it in quartine and once u do that reinstall it."
,doublethebdotnet,2011-09-01T08:49Z,"Works perfect on 32bit Vista and 7. One had actually expired, so I used the Premier version in the description, but used this NTR for resets. No problems, enjoying life again. One snag I encountered was resetting a purchased copy. The serials won't match, just hit try later on the bottom left, and it will go along."
