The home of a Playstation 3 hacker has been raided by the police in Germany.

At the behest of Sony, yesterday the home of graf_chokolo â€“ the operator of the PS3 Linux And Hypervisor Reverse Engineering Blog â€“ became the latest target in the Sony jailbreaking saga.

â€œGuys, SONY was today at my home with police and got all my stuff and accounts,â€ he wrote in a comment on his blog. â€œSo be careful from now on.â€

To prove just how futile Sonyâ€™s efforts are, graf_chokolo retaliated in dramatic fashion.

â€œGuys, I donâ€™t joke, itâ€™s serious. And to prove it, I kept my word and uploaded all my HV [hypervisor] reversing stuff. Upload it everywhere so SONY [can't] remove it easily. Grab it guys, it contains lots of knowledge about HV and HV procs,â€ he wrote, while publishing links to where the material could be found.

Today there are rumors floating around that Sony is working on a new â€œhack-proofâ€ version of the PS3. If they do a good job, as they did last time despite the recent hack, the machine might see out its natural life-cycle without being jailbroken.

But Sony have stirred up such a hornets nest with their recent action against Geohot and friends, all theyâ€™ve done is paint the digital equivalent of a great big target on their chests. Short-sighted? You bet.


Keep this torrent alive so hobby hackers everywhere can mod; let's show Sony they can't control what's ours.
