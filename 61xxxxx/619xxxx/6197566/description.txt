The only intelligent version of the novel, with some of the greatest classical actors of the time. It uses horror techniques to convey the message, and takes 3 hours to tell the story - thus we get to visit Laputa, the Struldbrugs and the Houynhms. 

Please avoid the 2010 version (kiddie candy) and sink your teeth into this.
