Monkeypriest play crawling Doom, characterized by rude, drawn out guitar chords over a bass rhythm that sounds like the slow buckling of a rockface under its own weight. After the pounding, riff-based intro 'March of the monkey', are three glowering Sludgy epics that ascend to the level of terrifying before the twenty-five minutes is up. The snarling yelps of the vocals are a journey into the savage, territorial mind of a beast, over seething layers of snare and cymbals that hiss like gases escaping from a mire.
