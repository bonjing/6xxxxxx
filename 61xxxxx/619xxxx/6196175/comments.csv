It won't fit on the internal storage though (1.78 gig into 384 meg doesn't go!) so you'll need an SD card with enough free space. Don't know if there's a way of transferring it into MapSource for on-computer access. If anyone knows please do advise."

Tried everything I could think of get it into Mapsource with no success, if anyone has managed to view it Mapsource, please advise!"
