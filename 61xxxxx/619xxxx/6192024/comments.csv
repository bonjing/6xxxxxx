[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-22T21:24Z,Both films DVDRip. Please seed.
,EpicSe7en,2011-04-12T00:00Z,Thank you!
,ak47killa14,2011-04-30T06:27Z,I'll comment when I am finished downloading. I am really wondering how it could only be 1.37 Gib when it's 2 movies. 
,arielmercoledi,2011-06-15T15:32Z,"'appreciate this, but:

why include over 40 unrelated torrents with the mere 2 files we want?

why not include a .nfo with the links? and why is there a .ico? all we want are the two avi.

& i'm sure that nobody would mind a .nfo describing the group & where to find more of their quality torrent files.

i'm going to check out this file in its entirety for three reasons: i want good etiquette or at least morality to prevail on intraweb (i am suspicious that TSV is hiding something in one of the files) - if TSV is a good group, i want to promote them to thank them for this torrent & help them out by getting them to stop the intrusive torrent crap - i drank a bottle of absynth that turned out to be antifreeze & i don't know how long i'll be able to remember the meaning of any of words before it kicks out and causes depth, so i want try at that good doing in case i really do die from drinkiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"
,TorrentJezuz,2011-07-04T03:37Z,"Thanks Toilet_sniffer_V
And @arielmercoledi Shutup you paranoid nutcase loser.
And @ak47killa14 Learn about torrents before you come on here sounding like a moron. 1 is 700MB and 2 is 699MB and thats the usual size for any movies on torrents. The 4-5GB DVDs use are a waste of space."
,SeasonOfMists,2011-07-13T15:53Z,"I haven't yet watched these, but I scrolled through, and it looks to be fairly decent quality. I am a little concerned that I can see a large amount of pixelation here and there. I know it's not a high-res copy, but it's a bit more than what you'd normally get. It also seems to have a little bit more bass than normal, but that could also be partially my headphones. Nothing to be concerned about overall though.

One quick question though. Does anyone know if these are the theatrical or unrated versions? I don't want to be deprived of my gore and plot scenes :D

@arielmercoledi Dude, seriously. Shut up! I scanned this with Avast, Malwarebytes, and whatever my friend uses on her computer, and it came up 100% clean every time. There's nothing in this file that could harm your computer farther than taking up hard drive space."
,XhaXx0r,2011-07-17T09:05Z,"@SeasonOfMists yea ive seen unrated versions around utorrent (ive done lota search on this movie) and im going to try this and then see if unrated is better or not.

little extra but hoping for the best on these ones and move on to some unrated ones :D"
,adicto_al_cafe,2011-09-05T07:47Z,"Thanks man, great torrent."
,Derek16438,2011-10-20T22:03Z,This is an excellent upload. Thank you for sharing Toilet Sniffer. +quality.
,BingUser,2011-11-05T02:04Z,Burned both movies to a single dvd using Nero 7. Video plays fine but no sound. Any ideas? Probably just Nero being shitty. Can anyone also suggest a more reliable software than nero? thanks.
,omgwtfnoob,2011-12-17T04:07Z,"woah.. enough files??
