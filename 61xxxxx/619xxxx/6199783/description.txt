If your building a web-application and you want to ensure that itâ€™ll be easy to maintain in the future, and simple for your clients to use than a single column with a fixed layout is highly recommended. With a fixed layout, you have more control of how the content area will look, and will run into fewer issues with floating elements. Having a single column will cause you to design with simple in mind.
Iâ€™ve included in this template example content pages:

    Home
    Calendar
    Forums
    Profile
    Colour Theme Selection (javascript will change it on the fly)
    Images (featuring jQuery Lightbox)
    User Listing
    Pages
    Login

This template includes both the Prototype and jQuery javascript frameworks

If there are any kind of pages youâ€™d like to see mocked up in this template please be sure to message me and Iâ€™ll be sure to add them.
