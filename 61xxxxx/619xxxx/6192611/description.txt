Gang leader Tony (DMX) pulls off a major diamond heist with his crew, but cop-turned-criminal Ling (Mark Dacascos) knows who has the loot and responds by kidnapping Tony's daughter and holding her for ransom. Unfortunately, Tony's lost the diamonds as well. As he frantically searches for his daughter and the jewels, Tony pairs with a high-kicking government agent (Jet Li) who once worked with Ling and seeks revenge on him. Tom Arnold co-stars.
