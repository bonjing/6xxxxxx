It Part One | Lila Katt | Intersec Crew   + Pics

If this is Hell for Lila Katt, then it has frozen over. The RealTimeBondage crew has been suffering through some terrible winter weather and they have decided to share some of it with their new toy. Snow does not seem like a weapon of mass destruction, but in between the initial shock of the ice hitting her body and the time her body goes numb from the cold it is like daggers piercing her skin. The members have barely started to weigh in with their instructions and Lila has already been reduced to tears. This promises to be a very exciting afternoon.
