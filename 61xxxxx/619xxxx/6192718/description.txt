"Gillis, Chase, and Babyface"

Jarek and Caleb arrive first on the scene at a 
bank robbery and chase the thief through the 
streets of Chicago only to find he has met a 
gruesome end. As the Chicago Police Department 
pieces together the clues of the robber, 
Superintendent Colvin conducts a critical 
meeting with Alderman Gibbons about a key 
construction site. Duplicitous politicking 
raises the stakes and further exposes the depth 
of corruption in the city.

Enjoy :)
