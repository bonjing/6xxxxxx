Label: Beat Goes On
Format:Mp3@320

Fantastic stuff from John Lee Hooker, and a record that's unlike any other he's ever done! The groove is very hard and funky, with tight drumbreaks and excellent basslines that you'd hardly expect to find on an album by a blues artist â€“ jamming around with a tight groove that really makes us love the record! The guitar on the set is wonderfully scratchy â€“ ripping up and down over heavy drums, with some nice horn touches to flesh the sound up â€“ and wicked vocals from Hook that give the whole set a nice and nasty feel! The best cuts include "Make It Funky", "713 Blues", "714 Blues", and "Bluebird" â€“ and the record's got some very nice breaks!
