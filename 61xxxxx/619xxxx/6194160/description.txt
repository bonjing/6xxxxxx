Szczecin-GoleniÃ³w \"SolidarnoÅ›Ä‡\" (Polish: Port Lotniczy Szczecin-GoleniÃ³w im. NSZZ \"SolidarnoÅ›Ä‡\") (IATA: SZZ, ICAO: EPSC) is the main domestic and international airport serving the city of Szczecin in Poland and is located 45 km (28 mi) northeast of the city, near the town of GoleniÃ³w. The airport was constructed between 1953-56 at the height of the Cold War. Works to improve the runway and the main apron were undertaken in 1998. The airportâ€™s electricity supply together with the runway and approach lighting was upgraded in 1999. A new passenger terminal was opened in 2001. The terminal expansion concluded in April 2006 and prepared the airport to serve 1 million passengers per year. At that time the airport was renamed for the \"SolidarnoÅ›Ä‡\" trade union. Main destinations from EPSC airport reach Warsaw, Hamburg, Oslo, Dublin and London-Stansted.

Â£Ã³dÅº WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Reymont (IATA: LCJ, ICAO: EPLL), formerly known as Â£Ã³dÅº-Lublinek Airport, is a regional airport in central Poland, located approximately 6 km (3.7 mi) southwest of the Â£Ã³dÅº city center. It has recently been named after the celebrated 20th century Polish writer and the winner of the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature, WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Reymont. The Â£Ã³dÅº airport opened in 1925. Since 1927 regular connections to Poznan, Warsaw, Lvov and Vilnius were established.
