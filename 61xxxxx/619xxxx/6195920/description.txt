Description: These bad boys of brawn, The Barbarian Brothers, are back. And this time they're twin truckers hittin the highway for some real 18-wheelin', muscle-poppin' adventure.

Dispatched to pick up a load of toxic waste, the brothers figure on an easy job even they can handle. But after they discover a girl-genius stowaway (Ari Meyers of Kate And Allie) they become entangled in an eat-my-dust, cross-country chase with a hulking hired killer (Richard Kiel, 'Jaws' in Moonraker), a psychotic repo man (David Carradine), and the young girl's beautiful guardian (Claudia Christian, star of The Hidden).

It's a rollicking, rip-'em-up roadshow as our boys do everything in their impressive power to protect a little girl, a top secret device and what remains of their truck.
