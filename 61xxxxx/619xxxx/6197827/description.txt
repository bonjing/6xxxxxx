Torn Apart was founded in early 2005 by David Eliasson (Guitar) Mikael SandstrÃ¶m (Guitar) and Alexander Wegebro (Drums). Torn Apart was determined to be a Death Metal band to be reckoned with, since there is not many death metal bands in UmeÃ¥, Sweden. The band played together from June to August before asking Petter Johansson (Bass) to join the band. Shortly after, Christoffer LÃ¥ngstrÃ¶m (Vocals) joined and the line-up was complete. Before recording their first demo they played numerous shows including the Ume-Metal Open Air Fest. They have also played along side artists such as Dismember, Satariel, Lethal and many others. In June of 2006 Torn Apart entered Starfruit Studio and recorded their first 4 song EP called "Craving Pale Flesh". The EP was released by Pathologically Explicit Recordings in April 2008.

This album is the debut album which hasn't seen the light of day because the band split up during the recording process, but still decided to finish it. It was recorded during the spring/summer of 2009. Drums were recorded at Studio Stallet. Guitars, bass and vocals were recorded in Studio Cadaver. Engineered, mixed and mastered by Cristoffer LÃ…ngstrÃ¶m.
