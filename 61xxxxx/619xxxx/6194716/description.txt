This is the solutions manual for Differential Equations Classic Fifth Edition by Dennis G. Zill. This was very hard for me to find. So I am posting it here on thepiratebay to make it more excess able to everyone else. All work and credit for this torrent should be given to its original author. If the torrent ever losses seeds just send me a message here or post a comment. I'll be sure to help you out. Enjoy :)
