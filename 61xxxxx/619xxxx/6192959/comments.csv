,AtotehZ,2011-06-09T09:19Z,"I love how some people have stupid torrent-program settings. I've found 3 different seeds on this torrent that gave me a speed of 4-6 mb/sec, and as soon as i get up there it drops again. Like ""we cant allow one peer to take up that much bandwidth so were shutting you down"". Why the **** would you even put it that high in the first place if thats the policy of the program."
,lockwooz,2011-10-01T01:31Z,"For some reason whenever I open the folder or right click on it windows explorer crashes; it restarts and after a few seconds everything is back to normal:

Anybody have any idea what's going on here? I've had it stuck on my computer for almost six months now, I guess I've just been too lazy up until now to do something about it, as it hasn't affected anything else (that I know about) other than taking up space. But I did watch the movie without any problems right after I downloaded it so it must have happened sometime afterwards.  "
,crabman61,2012-03-10T06:56Z,Doesn't play on my WDTV media player.  Dammit.  Thanks for the effort though.
