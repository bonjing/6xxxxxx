The last show of this series has a sketch 
that looks familiar: the one with the French maid 
played by English guest star Gemma Craven.

9 years earlier they did the same sketch with 
regular Ann Hamilton as the maid.  
Very rarely did Eric & Ernie do remakes!

That bank robber sketch above I haven't seen yet either.
