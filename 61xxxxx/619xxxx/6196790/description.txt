Classic Super mario bros.Wii is a project that uses Reggie level editor and Warp tileset editor to change all the levels from NSMBWii to NSMB DS
This is still BETA,not eveything is changed YET!
if someone could help me and make custom world maps from NSMB DS to the NSMBW game,i would really appreciate him


There is no Tower or castle remakes,only normal levels,this is also not based on ASM Hacks,so you are not stricted to Riivolution



This BETA includes :

Level Changed are 1-1,1-2,1-3 and 1-4(1-4 has some proplems with Goomba Generator)
Custom Intro Music and World 1 Overworld
Custom DS Tilesets
Mario and Luigi in Loading screen and continue are changed to 8-Bit Form

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Next BETA will include :

1-5,1-6,2-1 and 2-2 Levels from DS game
Custom Music of world 2 Overworld - Possibly in-game music too
