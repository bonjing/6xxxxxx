This is the second season of the brilliant Danish television show The Killing.

Warning: The English subtitles are terrible.  Why?  I did them myself using Google translate.  I was still able to follow the drama, but it was slightly painful.  I could not find any English subs online, so I did what I had to.

Here was the process:
(1) Downloaded the DVDRs (1-4) of Season 2
(2) Converted the video files to avi using jetaudio video converter
(3) Stripped Dutch subtitles from DVDRs using Subrip
(4) Converted Dutch to English using Google Translate
(5) Combined avi files and hard coded subtitles using VirtualDubMod

Enjoy.
