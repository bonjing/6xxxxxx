,cigaretteburns,2011-02-22T11:11Z,Thanks for the effort nigeria70; we are only getting season 1 on TV in the UK! Brilliant series. Thanks again
,Judith_Malina,2011-02-24T22:03Z,"Nice one, thx! - but if you knew they were terrible it would have been cool to *not* hard code the subs... if you suddenly find yourself bored, then do consider uploading the raw avi files and the subtitle files separately. Then any language can be added easily :)"
,nigeria70,2011-02-25T00:38Z,"Judith-  I did think of that, but I did not because I did not want to use that much of my bandwidth and because many people do not know how to use .srt files.  However, I did include an explanation of the five step process so if anyone wants/finds better subtitles they can download the DVDRs and do it themselves. "
,dread.pirate.roberts,2011-02-26T03:56Z,"Again with the missing 4Meg

Dude?!?"
,aajkd,2011-02-26T14:33Z,"Thx for the upload! It does however seem something wrong happened when you created the torrent, same for season 1. Noone will ever be able to finish the download with those torrents.. hashfail..

The best solution is probably to recreate the torrents in another program like utorrent, post it, and let people continue their downloads with those. Remember to post a link or notice in the chat.
Alternatively create single episode torrents for the broken episodes in season 1 and 2. Remember to use another torrent client.

Thx again for the upload : )"
,aajkd,2011-02-26T16:28Z,Episode 7 is the one not working
,cine1,2011-02-28T14:40Z,"First of all, thanks a million to nigeria70 for all the hard work of downloading DVDs, ripping and uploading.

Even if 4 mbs are missing from Episode 7, it plays fine with VLC. The torrent however will remain stuck at 99.9%.

The hardcoded subs are terrible indeed. But better subtitles are available here-

I find that setting subtitle color to yellow in VLC works well to overlay the hardcoded white subtiles.

Cheers!"
,RedLady1,2011-03-01T07:39Z,"I downloaded the srt files thanks to the tip cine1 but now the question is how do I add the english srt's and have them play in the proper sequence?  There are ten episodes on four discs.  Subs are in dutch and not hardcoded.
I use ConvertX - have added srt file's for films before with no problems -  but never three episodes and three srt's on one disc.  Do I do the same thing as for a film? Just add them.  Does it happen automatically?  Suggestions?  Thanks..."
,aeiah,2011-03-01T09:48Z,"best way to get english subs working with redlady's DVD torrents is to rip the episodes to mpg. dvds are mpgs anyway, so you dont need to re-encode the video, it'll just make it easy to use .srt files with each individual episode like you would with a normal avi"
,aajkd,2011-03-01T15:24Z,"Sounds like a lot of unecessary work to download the dutch dvds.

The Forbrydelsen II torrent found here with subs that are quite easily found using google."

,cosmikel,2011-03-06T19:10Z,SERIOUSLY BAD ENGLISH COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING - TOTAL WASTE OF TIME F*%K
,nigeria70,2011-03-08T04:15Z,"To please that last polite guy, I posted a new torrent with the better subtitles.  Personally, I found the DYI subtitles oddly charming."
,aajkd,2011-03-10T01:16Z,"Better edited english subtitles:

Might be hard to use with the hardcoded ones, but probably worth a try"
,whaenm,2011-03-12T09:50Z,"Appreciate your work on the subs. But they are not very good to anyone whose native language is English. It would be better not to hard code them, but rather to leave the subs as SRT files. SRT files can be edited in any word processor. People who find your Euro-English confusing can fix 'em."
,mgiuras,2011-06-13T08:22Z,Any chance that someone seed The Killing 2 (Forbrydelsen II)? I am stuck in 99.9 for two days as there is no one seeding except me. Pretty please!
,jdl123,2012-03-24T19:44Z,"I am fluent in both Danish and English... and trust me, downloading this for the subs sake is a waist of time... only download this if you understand danish.
