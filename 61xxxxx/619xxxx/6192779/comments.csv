DL'd fine, quick enough. Scanned clean. But not working on win7 32 bit. 

speed.exe crashes without even going into the game. No black screen, menu or loading just an responding error.

 I tried running as admin and compat. settings but same result on Windows7 32 bit. "
,deviantdigi,2011-05-12T12:52Z,"AHHH! I stand corrected.

Run the game from a crap, no icon shortcut underneath the speed.exe

thanks for the up a little more clear instruction would have been appreciated."
