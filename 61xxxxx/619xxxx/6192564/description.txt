Brooke is a photographer by trade and knows a bit about composition and lighting. She contributes on both sides of the camera, and loves modeling as a way to not only study her craft, but create beautiful images herself. Like many of the artists who work with us at FigureBaby, Brooke often shows her work in local galleries, and makes a nice living off her creativity.
