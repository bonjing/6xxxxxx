Hello fellow Wii gamers,


This software for Macintosh OS X 10.4 or later is a tool that can format a hard drive with a WBFS partition, add ISO images of Wii games directly to a hard drive and even convert between ISO and WBFS. I will make an effort to seed this when I can, and I will seed it often, but I am also relying on leechers to seed when I am not able to.
If you find that this is not being seeded, usually there is a time when it will be seeded in the next 24 hours.. so please be patient.

The application should be self-explanatory, but if you do have any questions just post them here and I'm sure someone can answer you. Currently this is the latest version of the software, and as it is updated I will post the new torrent and remove the old one.

Have fun and happy gaming!


Sincerely,

The Wii Game Master
