"Farewell Letter"

Lynette and Tom feel that it's time for twins Porter 
and Preston to move out on their own and learn how 
to become responsible adults. But the boys end up 
moving out to a pad that's a little too close to 
home. Meanwhile, as part of Gaby's therapy, she and 
Carlos pay a visit to her hometown to confront her 
past and discover that she has left a lasting 
impression on the town; Keith asks Bree to move to 
Florida with him to be closer to his son; Susan uses 
her kidney ailment to garner special treatment in 
public places; and after sending son Zach to rehab, 
Paul makes a decision about his life with Beth.

Enjoy :)
