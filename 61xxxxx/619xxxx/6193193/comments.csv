Sometimes, you have to restart Word another time before you see the EndNote X4 submenu under the Tools menu in Word 2011. 
I don't know if I can help, but you should try to be a little more specific, e.g., do you have a 
/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Startup/Word
folder and if yes is it possible that there is another installation of Office 2011 in another folder? You could try with Spotlight to find if there is one."

I updated my Office for Mac and it started working! look at bjuice100 other torrents for the updates."
