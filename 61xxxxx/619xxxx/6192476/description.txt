Hey, I downloaded as much as I could find from this band, but I still couldn't get all of it.  It's called Creeper Lagoon, and a strange fact about this band is that almost nobody has heard of it.  I think it is because of some dire family curse from five hundred years ago, or something...  
:)
Anyway, like I said I could not find everything!!  The latest EP from the band is being impossible.  It's called Remember the Future, and if your can help me find it then please drop me a link.

Most of the rest of their stuff is here.  

-I Become Small and Go
-Watering Ghost Garden
-Take Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday

If you download this and love it, remember that it doesn't hurt anybody to track down the actual albums and give it a buy.  Well, except for punching you in the bank account for eleven bucks.
