Pasted in the Content here is a picture of David Halls invitation to his birthday party in 1974. I have an original to his inauguration in the 

apartment somehwere to Shephards Mall in I think 71...Anyway on the second page of my Blog is the Party invitaion also.
In this is Senator Jackson a friend of my fathers from my fathers work in LOX certification of the Titans I & II. And investigation into a silo 

accident at Red Fork south Dakota. And his involment in reporting a General involved in kick backs in Tucson Arizona.
Also is Glen Campbell who I met in 73 with my father at the Dean Martin Golf Tournament in Tucson.



If this stuff true...as crazy as it sounds...why would you doubt me when I tell you Steven Jacoby who was my neighbor. Stevens parents were in a 

sex club as my brother described it involving the kids in th neighborhood. I lived in a upscale neighborhood. The Jacoby\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s had littl if no 

furniture in their house. They frequented an adult Theatre in Tulsa on Sheridan called Old Time Twin Theatre. Stevens mother suffered from 

childhood amnesia. They hosted a 4H club...a 4H Club...in a city...drawing the neighborhood kids to their home where we sat on boxes because of 

the lack of furniture.
They had a cabin where the neighbors allowed their kids to go. ALL of the kids aged 13-15 slept on a couch bed together, boys and girls.
Stevens bedroom had a string of christmas lights across the ceiling in red green and blue they were tied correspondingly to the stero bass treble 

and midrange..we listend to IN aGodda Dovida and someone gave me at 13 a vodka screwdriver. The only thing I can remeber from that room...is 

being raped brutally and that that is the source of three fingernails into my left thigh into my scrotum and a thumbnail into my right...they are 

Stevens.
And hiding with Eddie at the side of the fields white brick house.
My fatehr used travel extensively with his company predominently through Tulsa to Picuene Miss. where we lived in 64 working on the Saturn Test 

Facility outside New Orleans.
He was in Tulsa frequently before we moved here write after Apolo One in Dec, Martin Luther Kings Assination in April, Bobby Kenedys in June 3rd, 
and then Grant Park in Aug of 68 I think which was also the year my brother forced me at seven to suck on a metal protruding from our basement 

wall. He forced with Gus our neighbor watching cause I had told my mom I had seen my father hurting a toddler. I saw him through a window. We had 

been told not to look in... So Scott and I looked being boys...and my father was raping the toddler. I told my mother.
My brother forced for doing that to suck on the hook while standing on th back of a couch. He then pulled the sleeper porch of the couch out 

droping the back were I was standing ripping my mouth open and cracking my head open on the concrete floor...where I am now a portion of heir in 

the center to the left of my head where there are three scars. I cried to my brother in the blood in my mouth....why is there in my mouth..and he 

whispered back...thats what you get for tellling....the same thing he whispered to me when he brought me to Eddies beaten body.
In the hospital two years ago I was overwhelmed at nights with the images of Eddies dead body as I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d try to fall off to sleap...the would be 

forced to restrain me twelve times a night for two weeks from trashing my head against the wall. I told my sister I was seeing Eddies face and I 

was also seeing it in other people faces and it was so disturning that I was afraid I would strike out. She told the doctors that in my journal 

at the hospital I had disclosed to her I was seeing peole faces melting and was wanting to hurt people...my sister is evil beyond anything you 

can imagine...it was in her dresses she would dress me for my father...it was her that returned to them as I hid in a railraod at midnight 

waiting for my aunt to find me...my brother was going to kill me that night when I was twelve.
My sister said I saw faces melting...she did not in anyway want to explain why I would be seeing a dead boys beaten face.






The dates of Halls invitation is Oct 20, 1973.

which is when Nixon had Cox fired which corresponds to my mother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s story and verifes dates in history and people.
My mother told me that On the Saturday night Massacre the night Nixon had Bork fire Cox...Jackson called my father from St Louis saying that he 

was having to return to DC to impeach Nixon.



It can be verified that Pat Williams who changed Eddies Death Certificate went to HS and worked as lead prosectur with David Hall who become 

governor in 1971 I think.
These dates...the people all of this is confirmable.
I lived next door to Steven Jacoby. His brother commited suicide. I have Eddie\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 1974 yearbook picture that I got at the JHS he attended. His 

1974 picture and yet the certificate states that he died in 1964 on October 10th. Unless another boy in what was a very small town...died at the 

age of fourteen on the same date and had the same birthdate ten years off and the same name.
I do not think Pats kids are going to confirm what I am saying. My family wont. Stevens friend Stewart Fields wont. But please....how can I be 

right about so much...and wrong or delusional about so much. 
There is much more on my blog that I will not go into here. My Blog is disjointed and combersome...It was meant to be used by me to get to this 

point of putting the pieces together. But there are things there worth fighting through all of my philisophical crap that is very much worth 

considering.
No one from the media has replied at all, as they have refused to for years.
And no one from MHAT where Steven still works in conjunction with an organization which is involved with kids. I once thought much more of those 

who I did volunteer work with. I do not understand why they would protect him. Match the addresss...the dates...and the people...why would I make 

up the rest.
I have NO beneift from this. None.
And the names of myself and my fathers comapanies and details of those molested in my extended family and those in my neighborhood have been 

available to all the officials I have contacted.
It is time...some one does something and I simply will not be satisfied if nothing is done.
