[V],jainmehul,2011-02-21T13:21Z,"^^

This isn't dupe urs is 320kbps mine is VBR - V0 mine has proof JPEG.... i am the first on TPB to give VBR - V0

there are hundreds of people doing dupes on TPB but i ain't one of them...."
,SW_Singles,2011-02-21T15:01Z,"Yup you are.. and you sayin i dont have real CDRip? lol. First of all 320kbps is way better than 320k. so dont yell at me. I was first, you dupe'ing."
,SW_Singles,2011-02-21T15:02Z,First of all 320kbps is way better than VBR.**
[V],jainmehul,2011-02-21T15:27Z,"everyone has different opinions buddy..... i like VBR over 320kbps and upload it that way..... 

there were about 5-6 torrents of 320kbps before you uploaded so who's dopping now???...
were there any VBR V0 before this??....

and dupping means downloading other torrents and uploading it under our name.... so when i uploaded this torrent ur torrent wasn't even 100% seeded so how can this be dupping??...."
[V],jainmehul,2011-02-21T15:29Z,and when did i say urs isn't CDRip??..... i don't care what people upload.They do their stuff i do mine..... 
,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-02-21T15:35Z,320kbps is way better than VBR!! (i second that) :)
[V],jainmehul,2011-02-21T15:52Z,"The reason i don't do 320kbps :-

About 50-60 % Of 320kbps On tpb are transcoded as most of the people don't know how to check whether a 320kbps rip is real or not... i Don't do it....

and if the rip is From CD... VBR - V0 or 320kbps i will give the same Output believe me....  "
,SW_Singles,2011-02-21T15:53Z,duping = stealing other torrent and uploading under your name? nah buddy.. its mislabeling. LESSON LEARNED!

[V],jainmehul,2011-02-21T16:34Z,"LOLZZZZZzzzzz

mislabeling is when you name a VBR mp3 as 320kbps
an example :-
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6007758/__Cascada_-_Just_The_Hits%28320kps_SSDJ%29

the above torrent is named 320kbps bt it is VBR V2"
,SW_Singles,2011-02-21T17:30Z,"Whatever you say, you dont know the meaning of dupeing.. and btw.. CBR is better than VBR.. i dont want to be your enemy.. so please.. lets be in PEACE."

Can you please upload any compilation (like top 100 or 50 of 2010)or even suggest? Any of your choice. I'm out of pop/rock/alternative/RnB genre for a year or so. More into electronica and trip-hop.
