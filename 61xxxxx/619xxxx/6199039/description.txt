Reunite forlorn spirits separated by tragedy in Ancient Secrets â€“ Mystery of the Vanishing Bride, a fascinating journey through the history of an ancient island culture.

As the spiritual successor to the proud Tekkan people, Dr. Kate Miller has been entrusted with the whole of their legacy, everything from ancient artworks to jewels to mysterious artifacts, some benign, some fantastical.

While cataloging these relics at her museum, Kate receives a surprise call from a former flame pleading for her help in finding a wayward assistant who is on a forbidden search of an island treasure. She agrees to the expedition, but will the promise of another cultureÃ¢Â€â„¢s ancient secrets prove too tempting for Kate?
