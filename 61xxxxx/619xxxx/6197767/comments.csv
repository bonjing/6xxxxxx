,RyFabbro,2011-02-23T22:45Z,"i do love what you did with the folders too, and i confirm this works perfectally (though i had to go download another winrar before i could use it)

just a ?, i know how to do folders and drives like that, but how do you make the files super hidden, i always have show hidden files on but i didnt see those then i turn on protected OS files and they showed, so how can i hide my files to the OS mode cause i dont like turning hidden files off but yet i dont like seeing my folder icons and autorun.inf's"

the trial version is actually the full version for 30 days...time enough to use the downloaded trial through google... and open this archive to get the registered version.

I know what you mean, but inside are 26 installers... both 32 and 64 bits version of each language posted above... if only one missing, the torrent is incomplete

so given these 2 arguments, I thought it would be more appropriate to lock everything within one archive, so that each downloader interested by one language...to be a potential seeder for another downloader just like you. 

to install any of these registered version over any trial...makes it registered, it is so easy, no need to uninstall the trial tooken through google, so get the trial first if you just installed windows...it is a few clicks away ;)"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-02-23T23:28Z,"and that's not autorun inf's ... it is a Microsoft default configuration file called ""desktop.ini"" along with/ and related to an .ico file...

each language it is represented by a personalized folder, meaning the country name and it's corresponding flag... for ease of use and estetics. Do not frighten downloaders :))))

search in my torrents the autorun virus remover to deal with autorun infections if you wish, but do not confuse autorun.inf with desktop.ini, both are legit but the first could be used to do evil, there is no autorun inside here

Sure I could download the trial, but it's one more useless step..."
