               WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


  Version 4.00 beta 7

  1. Bugs fixed:

     a) "Prediction order", "Memory to use" and "Channels" fields
        in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog, "Lowest allowed ratio"
        in archive conversion dialog, "recovery volumes" field in archiving
        dialog did not provide enough space to enter maximum values allowed
        for these parameters. Now the width of these controls is increased.
