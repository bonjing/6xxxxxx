Based on Tatiana de Rosnay's best-selling novel, Sarah's Key tells the story of an American Journalist on the brink of making big life decisions regarding her marriage and her unborn child. What starts off as a reseach article about the Vel'd'Hiv Roundup in 1942 in France ends up as a journey toeards self-discovery as she stumbles upon a terrible secret and discovers the heartbreaking story of a Jewish family forced out of their home, a home that is now their own. As she starts to see, live, and breathe through Sarah, the eldest daughter, her world is turned upside down. Can one put aside shadows form the past?
