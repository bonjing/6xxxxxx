Johnny Cash tribute Trio/ from Zagreb,Croatia

Johnny Cash tribute started when two friends who love mr.Cash\'s music decided to do a concert in honor of Johnny, nearly two and a half years ago, on the fifth anniversary of his death. They taught it would be a one time thing (from there on Ã¤tributeÃ´ stuck with them), but reaction of the crowd and pure pleasure of playing songs they love were enough of a reason to carry on. After many shows their goal remained the same, to get close as possible to the sound of Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two, and in that they succeeded when they  got a new member in late 2010. Now when they are whole, this is a little promo of their work so far. Three classic tracks packed in custom design made by yet another friend, young Croatian designer.
