The hitmaking streak of Silent Sanctuary goes on with the release of its brand-new album, Mistaken For Granted, from Universal Records.

The band first gained the reputation of being a veritable hit machine through the debut album, Fuschiang Pag-ibig, which produced blockbuster tunes like Ikaw Lamang, Ingat Ka, Kundiman and Rebound.

The carrier single of the new Mistaken For Granted album, Hay Naku, is currently dominating local airlanes.

The CD contains more potential hits like the catchy Pauwi Na Ako and the heartbreaking Hiling. The group has also beefed up their string arrangements with the help from Eraserheadsâ€™ Buddy Zabala.

When Silent Sanctuary first entered the music scene, the band was at once branded as unique, due to its inclusion of the violin and cello as elements of the groupâ€™s music.

Mistaken For Granted is a solid proof that the members can come up with more profound themes â€” much more beyond their previously known cute love anthems.
