Storyline

Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) reunite for the comedy adventure 
Paul as two sci-fi geeks whose pilgrimage takes them to America's UFO heartland. While 
there, they accidentally meet an alien who brings them on an insane road trip that alters 
their universe forever. For the past 60 years, an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) 
has been hanging out at a top-secret military base. For reasons unknown, the space-traveling 
smart ass decides to escape the compound and hop on the first vehicle out of town-a rented 
RV containing Earthlings Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost). Chased by federal 
agents and the fanatical father of a young woman that they accidentally kidnap, Graeme and 
Clive hatch a fumbling escape plan to return Paul to his mother ship. And as two nerds struggle 
to help, one little green man might just take his fellow outcasts from misfits to intergalactic 
heroes...
