I was mislead by this being labelled as DivX and didn't realise it was a terrible quality Cinema Telesync.  The camera slips around, people walk in front of the camera a LOT and the sound's not great (and you can hear a lot of the noise the audience is making), plus the ending is missing.  It might be ok-ish for a cinema telesync before the movie's been relieased on DVD but it's just not worth downloading anymore.  Look for a DVD Rip instead."
