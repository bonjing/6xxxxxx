Aired 20.02.2011

"The Lich Pt II"

The Cape (David Lyons), Max (Keith David) and 
Rollo (Martin Klebba) are forced to rely on 
Dana's (Jennifer Ferrin) legal connections to 
help them discover The Lich's whereabouts. 
Heavily entranced by Conrad Chandler's (The 
Lich) potent serum, Orwell (Summer Glau) 
struggles to fight off the physiological and 
mental effects of the strong dose. Meanwhile, 
Netta's (guest star Illeana Douglas) strange 
loyalty to The Lich is clarified. In a 
sedated, weak state, Orwell drifts between 
reality and fantasy sequences, which slowly 
reveal her history and past.

Enjoy :)
