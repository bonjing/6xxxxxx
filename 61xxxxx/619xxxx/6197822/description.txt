PROPER NOTES

FLT's g4wl emulation makes saves corrupt and also the settings changes
can't be saved.

Here you have a working version, as true to the original, with g4wl
fully working.

Instead of the need to download whole game once more, you can get the
small sr-bustp.rar with update and proper crack.

RELEASE NOTES

Set in a futuristic utopia, an elite peacekeeping force thwarts the
rumblings of civil war. But deception within the ranks has caused two
members of the most feared unit to strike out on their own. Now
stranded on an abandoned paradise, Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato find
themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs.
They survive on two objectives: get off the planet alive and extract
revenge on the man who sent them there.
