""If SKIDROW.dll gets caught by your antivirus program, don't worry about
it.""

maybe your antivirus deleted it, or is preventing your system from accessing it, try disabling your antivirus before lanching the game ?
hope this helps"

,Josha5000,2011-02-25T18:32Z,Any idea how to play that game with live offline profile?
,jadawgkss,2011-02-26T08:46Z,"""If SKIDROW.dll gets caught by your antivirus program, don't worry about

So what you're saying is that the SKIDROW.dll in fact has nothing to do with the game running correctly or not? Hmm, sketchy "

""The cabinet file 'Media4.cab' required for this installation is corrupt and cannot be used. This could indicate a network error, an error reading from the CD-ROM, or a problem with this package.""
What should I do!?
Tnx!

Any1 else experiencing this? I mounted the game, installed with the serial, deleted the files mentioned and copied/replaced the few files that were included and still no luck."

,Khaerma,2011-06-20T18:25Z,"I'm having the same issue, everything works but when I start the game it asks me to sign in for windows LIVE and the product key doesn't work there... is there a known way to bypass this?"
,sweolk,2012-04-23T16:46Z,"I have a small problem, i am having problems with starting the game/logging in. 

i have both tried to log onto the ea with my already existing account, and a new one, used both serial-keys : XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX   and 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111. and none works.

so my conclusion is that i must create some kind of offline account for this game/not logging in at all (which btw doesnt work, the game just closes itself) however i do not understand how to make that offline piece and i would like if you could explain it to us/me.

thanks up front, and have a great evening!"
,sweolk,2012-04-27T22:50Z,"YES! i got it to work!

guys, if someone is stuck on the keygen whe u are supposed to login, forget it! select create new and then when the microsoft contract comes, there is a phrase that is marked in BLUE which says 'create local account' or something like that, that is the solution, u dont have to confirm the keygen or anything! 

thanks for me i know im the best there is! Happy Gaming Gamers!"
