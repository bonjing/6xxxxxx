Notes from Art Siegel and Craig Kerns:
This is the original disk in the Gets His Chance To Wail saga, which is described more fully here.
The 17 tracks on this one are from 1969-1971, and are mostly demos that would end up on Moondance,
His Band and the Street Choir, Tupelo Honey and several others. The only source info is "Van Morrison,
Vocals, Guitar. All Tracks recorded 1969-71." The disc itself reads "Gets His Change To Wail", while
the cover and spine are correct labelled. The tracks on this bootleg are identical to the later
And It Stoned Me CD. It seems likely that And It Stoned Me was just cloned from Gets His Chance to Wail.

This bootleg is also largely the same as the Gypsy Soul: Lost Demos From a Classic Period without "Ballerina."
"Lean On Me" (track 7) is known as "Hey, Where are You" on Gypsy Soul, and "Wasn't That a Time" (track 10)
is known as "Rock and Roll Band" (the title Van announces on the track).

Note from Donna Burdick:
At the beginning of "Domino" there's a little of the studio discussion included and they decide to leave
the flute out of the mix. Then Van says, "I think that's a better key for me; gives me a chance to 'wee-ale'
more." The accent kills me...I guess that's where "gets his chance to wail" comes from.
