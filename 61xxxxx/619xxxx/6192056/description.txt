The 400 remarkable illustrations explain the anatomical details of male and female figures in motion and at rest, always stressing the human form in space.

Meticulous diagrams and fascinating action studies examine the rhythmic relationship of muscles and their effect upon surface forms. The captivating text is further enhanced by the magnificent figure drawings of such masters as Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Rodin, Picasso, and other great artists.
