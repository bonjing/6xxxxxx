,Weho2,2011-04-16T17:50Z,"Well it actually does what it says, updates to 1.3 + that peninsula campaign. Dunno if have virus. But if it doesn't thanks OP."
,arson51,2011-04-30T00:25Z,"I see a changed load screen, than crashes to desktop. I'm using a pirated version of the game 1.0 that worked fine before this. Also Zone Alarm asked me to authorize some exe to run that was no usual before. Might be a virus."
,arson51,2011-04-30T00:29Z,On second thought 24 seeders for this thing feels definitely not legit. BACK UP YOUR FILES BEFORE ATTEMPTING.
,loranthis,2011-05-13T14:37Z,Works fine.
,axe500,2011-05-26T12:09Z,7 seeders i am downloading at the rate of 20-28 kbps T_T

,sergio_sos,2011-07-06T00:39Z,Thanks mate!
,Murdock52,2011-07-29T02:44Z,"it's seems that some, if not all dlc units are doubled. is there a way to remove the double modded units? apparently the Peninsula Campaign unlock torrent makes all the original dlc available, is that true? anyway, thanks for putting all this things together."
,ziegenpeter,2012-01-08T19:23Z,"I also get the doubled units for personal battles. I dont know if this also goes for the campaign, if so, I hope it doesnt do anything bad with the AI, otherwise I could live with that..."
,dr.cook41,2012-02-10T22:43Z,"ok, so i did all as per instructions, but when i play, i get to setup army screen, then this happens....

etc etc etc"
,karasu24,2012-02-13T11:41Z,Works so far.  Thanks!
,Anon1850,2012-02-26T22:07Z,"In the battle view my Orders bar is gone. The bar in which you click for the troops to run, the cannons to deploy... It's simply gone. Had to reinstall, because I didn't have a vanilla copy :S

Dunno if it's a bug, or if it's a problem with my comp."
,kolokythis,2012-03-08T13:43Z,"Mate you saved us from a lot of hassle, 1000 thanks. Works perfectly and its clean, scanned with ESET, Malwarebytes, Spybot, Spyware Doctor. It is also needed for playing the latest (2.25) Darthmod. A word of advise: To make Darthmod working on a pirated version launch the game from its shortcut with admin rights. Then quit and load the Darthmod launcher as admin too. Enable whatever options you want and then exit. Now, load Napoleon.exe and Darthmod should be enabled with the settings you just chose."
,sawke94,2012-03-15T18:20Z,it works fine.. -.- BUT I HAVE DUBLE UNITS... can i fix it?
,darkrift12345,2012-03-31T10:20Z,hey tnx man it works although it changed the loading screen into a creepy pirate skull... and theres double unit but its awesome cuz it doesnt limit how many elite units you can create really cool.. appreciate the hard work!!! keep it up..
