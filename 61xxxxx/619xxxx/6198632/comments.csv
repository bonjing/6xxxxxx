The trial act 1 took longer to buffer, but the paid is quick.  The download time for the torrent as a whole was a bit long on my phone, but  it was easily fixed by downloading one file in the background while watching the one prior.  I tried Lunar version first and wasn't happy at all. If you want quality than please download this and SEED SEED SEED!"
