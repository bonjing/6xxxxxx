This is the Solar fansub of Ouran High School Host Club, also known as Ouran Koukou Host Club.  The two primary fansubs of Ouran Host Club are from Solar and Lunar.  While I enjoy both of their works, in this case Solar's video quality is far superior, while Lunar's video quality is too blown out, like a lens flair hangs over every scene.  Since both group's translations are pretty much spot on, I consider Solar to be the superior version.  I also prefer Solar's less playful font choices and their slightly more literal translation, but honestly, the video quality is the main reason I prefer Solar for Ouran High School Host Club.

The files are the same as the originals apart from my renaming them to include the episode titles.  Japanese language with English subtitles only.

This torrent includes all 26 episodes, and will be seeded heavily (5mbps upload) for several months.

Enjoy the torrent!
