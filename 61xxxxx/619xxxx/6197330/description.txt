This TV-movie was a sad way to end 40+ years of 
Eric & Ernie as a comedy team in 1983, since Eric 
died the following year.

It\'s basically a parody of Agatha Christie 
\"Death on a Train\" style movies, which is a genre 
I never liked so I\'m biased to begin with.

There\'s no question that the writing is weak and 
the humor uninspired, but worth a look only if 
you\'re a Morecambe & Wise fan... which is why I tried it.

It was a BIG mistake setting this in the 1940s, 
not just because the fashions and styles were so awful, 
but Eric & Ernie played themselves early in their 
stand-up career -- at a time when they were actually 
teenagers. The guys were in their 50s in 1983, but 
they couldn\'t have kids playing them the whole movie 
or else we would never see them.
