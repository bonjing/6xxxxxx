,brianxxx,2011-02-22T22:13Z,"Damn fine upload Sir! lol

Yeah, I have to bitch and moan....they have got to stop the lame 120 day thing. Very annoying. Really wish they would get it back up to at least 180 but preferably 365! 

If anybody has BOX!'s ear...tell them to get with it. lol"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-22T22:31Z,"@kzrockz 
@ge1453 

From the description:

""To extend the trial days, just uninstall the NTR before the subscription 
expires and install it again to get another 120/180 days of subscription.
The exact number of days depends on your OS, the product, and situation.""


Reading is very simple, so try it."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-22T22:36Z,"@brianxxx

120 and 180 days are taken from the trial versions (or a combination: 90 + 30, 90 + 90).

If the number of days is more than 120 (NAV-NIS) or 180 (N360) then Symantec would probably disable the subscription."
[T],mp3pro1986,2011-02-23T08:43Z,"Hello RH and Box!

Many thanks to both of you. The ntr 3.3.1 did a great job for me. I tested it on N360 and it still works!

Have a nice week and if there is something i can do back, let me know (if you are looking for something for example).

[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-26T04:03Z,"ge1453

Probably your friend just saw some fake (old) cracks, or maybe he's just trying to impress.

You just need to run most trial resetters once or twice a year to have an unlimited trial version,
till there's a newer version of the software with a new trial resetter.

Since Norton 2009 the are only trial resetters, and people should get used to trial resetters,
because software protection is becoming better each year."

works great with NORTON 360 5.0.0.125.
i downloaded a new version from symantec and used the crack, it gave me 180 days triial.
i tested all the other cracks and trial resets by setting my bios time forward.

they all failed after a couple of days added.
exept this trial reset, it works all 180 days.

,quietcity,2011-03-03T21:54Z,"Works perfect! Special thanks to the up-loader, great work mate!
So, as an average user, I read carefully the instructions and I have one question. It's about recommendation to disable the option ""Automatic Live Update"" at ""Settings/Computer settings""? As for the others 2 (to disable both ""Automatically download a new version"" and ""Receive news about special offers"") - all is clear, but disabling that isn't it a compromise with my protection?
Any advices and answers will be appreciated, thanks in advance guys! :) "
,draexo,2011-03-04T18:59Z,Hmmm... Norton 360 v 5.0.0.125 seems to have detected the trial reset.....
,draexo,2011-03-04T22:32Z,"If it detects the Trial Reset torrent (the archived files) it resets to original date.  However, when I removed the archive, it goes back to 150 days.
"
,draexo,2011-03-05T01:01Z,"Norton is now scanning your hard drive and resets the trial reset if you have this file on your hard drive.  You will need to move it to an external drive.  Also, Norton detects it as a trojan now, whereas two weeks ago it did not.  Still seems to work though."
,quietcity,2011-03-05T12:33Z,"@ draexo

What exactly NTR do you mean? The latest one 3.3.1? I'm asking you, because I'm about to install & test N360 right now, and my present NIS also catch a NTR yesterday as a trojan, but it was 3.2.0 (only it), as far as for others - they all pass its scanning... :-0"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-03-05T12:39Z,"@quietcity 

By storing files in an excluded folder they can't be detected and can be normally used.

The NTR can also be stored in a paasworded archive (RAR, ZIP,etc) so a virusscanner
can't detected it anymore."
,6545342de7,2011-03-06T21:49Z,"the trial resetter v3.3.1  is still working like a charm for me.
It didnt detect the trial reset at all.
or even saw it as a minor treat.
nothing .

its working perfect .
also installed it on other computers from friends (windows xp Home SP3  32 bit) and (windows 7 home premium 64 bit Sp1)

i downloaded the DUTCH version of Norton 360 5.0.0.125 directly from Symantec.
so i downloaded it new ,not a tampered version from a torrent site.

hope you can use this info."
,6545342de7,2011-03-06T21:52Z,"Better make an ISO of the trial reset if you want to be sure ,and NOT a RAR.

i remember Norton 2010 removed a crack out of a RAR file once.

it never succeeded to do that with a power iso file."

Any PASSWORDED archive (ISO, RAR, ZIP, bla bla bla) cannot be scanned. That's at least what I know."
,columbuzz,2011-03-11T08:03Z,"Dont let Norton autoscan your computer for the first time just after install. Then go to settings and exlude archived files (rar, zip...) from scan. As simple as that...;-)"

,6545342de7,2011-03-17T09:52Z,"@ robbing hood
yeah maybe , i think it depend on the MD5 hash code .

i think if they want  a file blacklisted , symantec 
downloads the crack , and  makes a MD5 hash code from the file.

they make a different hash number when its in a RAR file.

they put those MD5 numbers in their DATABASE ,and voila.
the file gets removed during scan when the scan sees the identical MD5 code.."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-03-17T15:33Z,"@6545342de7

By using free online scanners for cracks all crack signatures are simply collected, which makes it easy to add crack signatures to any virus data base.

That's why I don't understand why people are using online scanners. 
Besides, online av scanners are not reliable and don't use updates and premium av signatures, cause that's where people have to pay for."

[V],RobbingHood,2011-05-16T02:20Z,"UPDATE NOTE:
-----------------

My NIS 18.5.0.125 was updated today (16 may 2011) from v18.5.0.125 to v18.6.0.29 through a LiveUpdate.
No matter what the settings of Norton are, if there's a new version build update avalaible 
it will be downloaded and installed through updating.

NTR v3.3.1 still works, but it's not sure yet if the version build update may cause problems 
when uninstalling NTR v3.3.1 cause I didn't try yet to uninstall NTR v3.3.1 on Norton 18.6.0.29.

Also I'm not sure yet if NTR v3.3.1 works for the separate installer of Norton 18.6.0.29,
cause my Norton was updated internally through an update."

,jaybl,2011-06-07T13:41Z,"ROB, ARE YOU HEARINGG...?..!

i purged and installed N360 v5.0 with your NTR 3.3.1, but didn't install NTR. I stood with the original 90 day trial of N360, thinking to install NTR 2 days before the original trial ends.
N360 recently get updated to 5.1.0.29,i didnt install your NTR then. 

Now when the trial is getting to end i tried to install the NTR. But it says'Installation FAILED!. The Norton Internet Security did not shutdown properly. Please reboot your computer and try again.'.

I had no other way but to uninstal N360 and install a NIS 2011 V18.5.0.125 60 days trial ING partnered one, which you said 18.5.0.125 will work with NTR 3.3.1. I purged and installed NIS 2011. It showed 15 days trial remaining. I disabled Product Tamper Protection and clicked install in NTR 3.3.1.

For my surprise it is again saying above said 'Installation FAILED!....NIS didnt shutdown properly thing...

You said in instructions NTR 3.3.1 is compatible with NIS 18.5.0.125, but what now?..Please tell me what i want to do..


Note: I earlier subscribed to Norton Account when installing N360V5.0 and used Norton Removal Tool to remove updated N360v5.1. Do this earlier subscribed account information has to do something to block NTR3.3.1 from installing?."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-07T23:55Z,"@jaybl 

Apparently you did not try Safe Mode, so try that.

Also read the all of the install notes, cause many possible solutions are described there for different Norton problems."
,jaybl,2011-06-08T04:04Z,"Rob, i tried everything. In safemode too it is saying Installation Failed!. I think the Norton Account of previous unistalled N360 5.1.0.29 has something to do with NTR. I tried the Ruppert NTR 3.3.1 too. That also is saying Failed!. 

I am thorough with the installation and instructions as i am not new to installing NTR. Even the successfully tested NTR's are also not working with their compatible Norton products."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-08T20:39Z,"@jaybl 

It's working for me a more tha a 1000 others. So you might as well assume that there's something wrong at your end."
,jaybl,2011-06-09T03:51Z,"Yes, i confirmed the wrong!..I tested the NTR 3.3.1 on virtual machine windows xp pro sp3.
On that the NTR worked successfully without any 'Installation Failed'.

I asked you that whether the problem is due to norton account of N360 i uninstalled recently?. I think that is the problem.

 I uninstalled via Norton Removal Tool, I tried everything , deleted every trace of norton/symantec in folders and registry.

Still any trial product of Norton with confirmed remaining days is showing 0 days remaining on my system, when it shows true trial days or some 15 days/90 days of the same products on another system.

NOW, any trial of any Symantec product is showing expired/ 0 days remaining in my system. What should i do?. Switch to some other Antiviruses?.


I can't delete following Symantec keys from registry. May be this is used for Norton account.


[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Enum\Root\LEGACY_SRTSPX\0000]
