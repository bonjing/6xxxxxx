,mcham,2011-02-21T18:17Z,"To the Thingy: Does OEM mean that this will work with no activation needed when installing into any brand laptop (e.g. Dell, HP, Toshiba, etc.) that has SLIC 2.1 BIOS?

In the past, I recall that each OEM brand (e.g. Dell) had a Win7 OEM disc that would not work with other OEM brands (e.g. HP), resulting in the popular 48-in-1 OEM releases. Maybe I am mistaken?

Thanks for your incredible posts. You are a god among men!"
[V],thethingy,2011-02-21T18:30Z,"mcham, this has no ""OEM"" info on it, it's the default OEM DVD that's given to OEM's, activate as normal or go here;

you can use any of the win7/enter/server activators for this as Professional supports retail/OEM/kms/mak from 1 DVD. "

,matt56037,2011-02-27T22:47Z,"When you say ""OEM Volume"" does that mean it works with volume licenses? Does that mean it won't work with a non-volume OEM product key off my laptop's COA?"

,duchess62,2011-12-18T22:57Z,Thank you soooo much.  After double installing my windows XP I decided it would be easier to install windows 7.  Don't get to do this very often but I will let you know when I get it installed how it went.  Thanks again.
,duchess62,2011-12-19T05:45Z,This is not streamable does that mean that I cannot download over the web with utorrent?  I cannot figure out how to install so I think I am missing some stuff.
