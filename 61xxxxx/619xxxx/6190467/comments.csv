,computer_guy_finnish,2011-04-02T21:20Z,"Thanks for the torrent, it works absolutely perfectly and how it should work, HD 720p and audio works heavenly! I was wondering is it possible to hide English subtitles during the movie? Those subs are kinda unnecessary when I'm trying to watch those great movies for example with Finnish subs..but hey, thanks anyway! :)"
