,Philonetic,2011-03-05T10:57Z,"1. You've made an overloaded package using other peoples models, handling, skins, etc.
2. You DO NOT have permission from the mod authors to upload this.  Its like reuploading a razor1911 game and claiming it for yourself if you dont atleast give credit to EVERY AUTHOR that made a mod in your package.

-mark from me, get permissions next time.

If the vehicles have no sound thats because strandstrand incorrectly entered the vehicles data."
,Parkerboy1997,2011-03-05T18:35Z,Ok i have a new laptop so the sound should work because alot of people have told m it is because i have a small netbook with a really bad sound system lol
,necros999,2011-03-06T05:49Z,"@Parkerboy1997 To help all those out there who seem unable to read, here's instructions for getting the cars audio. It seems when uploaded this Zip a glitch, or simply strandstrand forgot to put the audio file in the wrong place.
1. Open GTA SA Carbon 2011 file.
2. Move VehicleAudioData and VehicleAudioLoader files in the 'audio' file.
3. Move both of them yet again into the CONFIG file. 
This should give the cars their audio back and have the originally horn. Good luck and buy a hooker or two for me!"
