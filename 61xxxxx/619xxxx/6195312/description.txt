"Do Not Sleep with Your Autistic Nephew's Therapist"  

Crosby (Dax Shepard) pays the price for a mistake 
that will change his relationships with those 
closest to him. Adam (Peter Krause) gets annoyed 
with Alex's (guest star Michael B. Jordan, "Friday 
Night Lights") frequent visits. Meanwhile, Adam and 
Kristina (Monica Potter) are then forced to deal 
with a huge problem that will affect Max's (Max 
Burkholder) progress. Elsewhere, Drew (Miles Heizer) 
is hit with some disappointing news from his father 
(guest star John Corbett, "United States Tara"), 
while Sydney (Savannah Paige Rae) makes a decision 
that her parents, Julia (Erika Christensen) and Joel 
(Sam Jaeger), are supportive of.
