        Underbelly Files - Tell Them Lucifer Was Here

        A  cold  night  in the  industrial  back  roads of  Moorabbin,
        Victoria. For two young  police officers, Rod Miller  and Gary
        Silk, it was just  a routine surveillance operation.  They had
        no inkling that it was to be the last night of their lives.

        But evil lurks in many guises and that fateful night it  chose
        to  manifest  itself  in  the form  of  two  men,  pumped with
        adrenalin as they planned  their latest assault on  a suburban
        diner and its patrons.

        So when faced with the  threat of answering for their  crimes,
        their response was to coldly shoot Senior Constable Miller and
        Sergeant Silk. After all, they were only police and  therefore
        the enemy.

        But their callous execution of two decent men, who left behind
        families  and  collegues  numbed  by  grief,  was  not  to  be
        forgotten.  Answers were  sought and  justice demanded.  Enter
        Operation Lorimer, helmed by Detective Inspector Paul Sheridan
        and a crew of  dedicated investigators determined to  find the
        killers.
