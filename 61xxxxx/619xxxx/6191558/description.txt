The HOLLYWOOD documentary series is a thirteen episode series on silent-era Hollywood; each episode runs about 53 minutes. Each episode concentrates on one subject area, whether the star system, visual effects or stunt work. Kevin Brownlow and David Gill wrote, directed and produced this series for Thames Television. Actor James Mason was the narrator and Carl Davis composed the score.

Keeping in mind that in the past, those showing silent films often used poor quality prints projected at the wrong speed, Brownlow and Gill did what they could using the technology they had available in 1979 to show these silent films at the correct frame rate. HOLLYWOOD used the best available silent films over 30 years ago, projected at their original running speed and backed by Carl Davis\â€™ orchestral score. Now, newer technology, such as 4K scanners, is available to create a digital intermediate that would have much improved image quality for use in creating a new print of the series. The problem now is that the costs of getting copyright clearances for the film clips used in the series are a big roadblock to any new digital release of HOLLYWOOD on DVD.

The producers videotaped the recollections of surviving creative talent from the silent film era, and added film clips to supplement these interviews, as well production still photographs. For some actors who had passed on to that big sound stage in the sky, such as Rudolph Valentino and Clara Bow, the narration provided all the background information for the film clips. Some interviews here, such as those with Dolores Costello (discussing in part the movie Noah\â€™s Ark) and ace stuntman Harvey Parry, are their last recorded interviews.
