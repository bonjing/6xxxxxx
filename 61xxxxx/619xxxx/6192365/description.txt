DIRECTOR: Ryan Nicholson
WRITER: Ryan Nicholson
CAST:
Dan Ellis, Sindy Faraguna, Nathan Durec

PLOT:
"Star Vehicle" follows the downward spiral of movie driver 
Donald Cardini, a self-professed movie buff with a penchant for 
explosive violence when provoked. Driving the stars of low-budget 
movies, along with their fragile egos, to and from locations in 
the middle of nowhere, pushes Don's buttons in all of the wrong 
directions. When Luke, the young and self-absorbed writer/director 
challenges Don's authority, murder and mayhem ensues. The movie's 
Scream Queen' starlet, Riversa Red, to her dismay finds herself 
the target of Don's obsession. With his encyclopedic knowledge of 
her "body" and body of work, Don worms his way onto Riversa's 
good side, no easy task. Not knowing whether to fear or friend 
Don, Riversa finds herself at the center of a cyclone with Luke 
and Don both vying for her attention. A mysterious Hotel Bellboy 
and an unknown "watcher in the woods" lend themselves to the 
growing suspense as the cast and crew hold-up at Forest Grove Lodge...
