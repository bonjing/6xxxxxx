,MMic,2011-02-24T04:57Z,Is it possible to save with this rip? Other versions were having trouble with offline Windows Live accounts allowing them to save. Thanks.

,GAMEREX(12),2011-02-24T11:15Z,thanks man this game works for me thanks bro great upload
,63Jax,2011-02-24T14:04Z,"this works like a charm. thank you! 
BUT...what about updates and patches?"
,Ynobe,2011-02-25T08:30Z,"Well..have to say after about 6 years going to this site...I have finally joined it...this is to pass on to KAOS that you have the most simple installer....one button and away you go....there is a lot to be learned from you for a few other groups out there (who compress to this level with degraded vids)...no names but they should know who they are!

GG KAOS keep it up...

Although it did exit to desktop with an error after playing if for about 30 mins...nothing to do with the rip I believe."
,dglsan,2011-02-25T09:47Z,3.12 gb!!!!!!!!....it works perfectly..saves perfectly...flawless..
,99tops,2011-02-25T13:16Z,"Works perfect, even saving.  Install is a breeze.  This is the best release of this game."

,jadawgkss,2011-02-26T22:13Z,"Finally! A rip that actually works! I spent 2 hours last night trying to get the Skidrow and FLT rips to work, and all that ended up happening was I had to restore the entire C drive from a backup! This one has no antivirus programs popping up with warnings, it just works. Thanks KaOs and I look forward to seeing more, (where have you been btw, I think the last rip I got from you was Bioshock 1)"
,Fishfeast,2011-02-26T22:38Z,How do I start the game? I can't seem to do it without loging on the windows Live. Anyone care to tell me how to fix this?
,Likeadidas95,2011-02-26T22:50Z,"yeh, Kaos/gansuk very good ripper ..

,Lilcrizz,2011-03-02T13:55Z,wtf i cant get it to work
,StupidGamer123,2011-03-02T17:21Z,When i gonna play the game it said to sign in with your live account and there is no way to play offline. wtf!
[T],musy2,2011-03-03T09:18Z,"fucking speed.........plz seed........max 10kb/s only
i stuck in 99.6.....after finish i will seed how long i can"
,sudeep_58,2011-03-03T11:36Z,its important that when u install disconnect from internet and disable your antivirus. Most antivirus during installation delete the xlive.dll file. In my case no GFWL screen is appearing . I can play directly from game menu and my progress is saving. 
,aarJunn,2011-03-08T06:32Z,"Welcome back kaOs.
And for kaOs fans- he has also released Painkiller.Redemption-KaOs
Dead.Space.2-KaOs 
and many others.
Keep up the great work my friend."

,mrpirater,2011-03-16T21:58Z,"malwarebytes says that d3drm.dll is malware.....

,ac1d69,2011-03-23T20:08Z,"Great rip. Works perfect. About half way trough the game now an it's awesome. So good i even feel a tiny bit bad for not buying this one lol {but if i did i would have to deal with gfwl crap, not here :) }. Looks amazing too maxed out. Even the cutscenes are watchable unlike most rips that look like shit an you just skip. Fast downlaod too (300kbps) plenty for me for an overnight download :)

Thanks a lot for this one gansuk.
"
,PC555paul,2011-03-24T19:48Z,Rip's good but no skill points. Any way to fix that?
