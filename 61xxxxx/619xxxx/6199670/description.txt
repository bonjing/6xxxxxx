CJ March - a charming woman. But she is not women's work. CJ - Contract Killer. For many years she fills orders for his boss, drug dealer Vernon Kreya. And both were very happy union. CJ got good money, while Vernon could not help but worry about the result of her work - this girl knows his business. However, sooner or later, everything goes well-deserved rest and CJ decided to perform the last contract, and then leave the "bloody" business. The job was pretty standard - once again a squirt decided that may hold Vernon and appropriated a large quantity of drugs. However, the first March can not get the job done - all at once she learns she is pregnant. Now she finds it difficult to pull the trigger, but there is a tough choice: either kill or retreat, not only risking their lives ...
