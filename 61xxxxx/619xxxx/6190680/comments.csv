,nyder,2011-02-21T10:27Z,because nothing sucks worse when you get something for free and you have to unrar it.  ungrateful git.
,thorofdenmark,2011-02-21T10:56Z,"@nyder it kills torrents because disk space is precious! ..but if you could tell my why compressing media files is a good thing I'm all ears! 

And no need to thank for the ungrateful upload upload my friend :o) ...or did you choose the rar version?"
,exaulted,2011-02-25T03:10Z,"RAR is useless. It had a value once upon a time when 256 kbps down/128 kbps up internet speeds were all the rage and hard drives were only 4 gigs and saving 3k per file made a difference. Now with 3 terabyte external drives and 2 terabyte internal drives and 30/30 Mbps internet speeds very affordable and common place, most people have more space than they know what to do with. RAR is so unnecessary now and it makes no sense at all to have RAR files in torrents. No sense at all. Its a relic."
,thorofdenmark,2011-02-26T21:21Z,"@exaulted. Exactly no sense at all, so why is it on the rise?"
,ispgonewild,2011-03-12T14:34Z,"Nyder, you stupid bitch. I gotta add one important thing to the list of arguments Mr Exaulted just threw (where's your list?).

We do not use floppy disks anymore to distribute warez as did the old school when Internet wasn't readily available everywhere.

Harddrives have a limited life expectancy. Raring and unraring files when there are no rational argument for that behavior is an unmoral thing to do.

There are a few arguments for the use of rar-files, in particular the process of making sometimes thousands of files into fewer files with shorter file addressing. And still, one or another might actually have use of rar's checksum procedures. Al of this is another discussion. The reasons once valid, what made the scene rar their releases, sure aren't valid anymore. It's a stupid thing to do."
