,p0pper,2011-04-16T20:13Z,"version 3.1.2.9
I've downloaded and installed it. The crack works fine. Tested on Youtube and so far so good !
Tho my AV screams Trojan in the crack. False alarm or real ? I'm not sure but play it at your own risk..."
,kakatul09,2011-04-18T18:45Z,"Don't believe this torrent....it has a Trojan Virus.
If you don't believe me download it and then scan it on www.virustotal.com.
The Virus is in the Crack Folder."
,torrkida,2011-04-27T15:34Z,"thts right it contains a trojan.....in crack folder ...kaspersky ...detected

,coolnsexy19,2011-05-19T06:47Z,"very useless software dont know why to waste time downloading

,styjt13,2011-05-28T21:10Z,"Crack includes trojan/similar threat. Tried MSE, McAffee & webroot. All of them removed it. what the heck ??"
,diakon27,2011-05-30T08:02Z,"Hey uploader, you really think anyone is gonna seed this if it has a Trojann virus in it? Why would you upload a Torrent with a Trojan virus? You're a dumbass. Well everyone we can all see why he doesnt have a trusted icon or VIP beside his name. This torrent is screwed now. i'm not taking any chances downloading this shit even though i got AVG."
,foxeiy,2011-07-10T05:56Z,"Jesus Christ, most of you have no brains. Crack programs are ALWAYS going to be detected as viruses, but 99% of the time ALWAYS work. It's because of their coding they seem like a virus because they target the program you're cracking (DUH?). Just food for thought."
,ladek,2011-07-31T14:08Z,thx work perfect !
,Ticklemehballlz,2011-10-19T11:53Z,"I made a account on this literately just to say this: 

AN ANTI VIRUS PROGRAM WILL ALWAYS THINK A CRACK IS A VIRUS IT'S CALLED A FALSE POSITIVE. The reason for this is because the Crack is a File that is designed to HACK the program you want to use so you may reap the benefits of it without PAYING for it. Because this 'File' is noticed as a file that is making changes to the original structure of the program and because they are ILLEGAL. (in some cases) the AV will submit it as a False positive asking you to remove it from your computer, THEY ARE SAFE. For AVG users (the best) Turn off resident shield and then make AVG skip the crack folder. of which programs you have cracked. Passing up on a Crack because your AV said it was a torjan. means only one thing. You will never ever crack anything. ALL CRACKS ARE FRIENDLY VIRUSES."
,Ticklemehballlz,2011-10-19T11:57Z,Also: Does appear this does not work on 64-bit version of windows 7.

,higurashi-no-naku-koroni,2012-03-13T19:29Z,"help mcafee auto deletes code injection programs 
any idee how to stop that

XxAlLeNxSk8eRxX
no its not the virus scanner thinks it is because all virus scanners have code injection blocks
basically a crack/keygen/hack does th same thing as a virus changing files 
so its not a virus just a code  injection program"
,Chetsakor,2012-04-10T20:23Z,"To those who want to download this, it's totally virus... Better to  not download or your will regret as the virus will attack your computer."
