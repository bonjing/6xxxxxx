Same as the previous torrent actually. But for some reason that torrent is not showing 100%. This torrent is showing files to be 100%.

No need to delete the old torrent. The old torrent is also fine andworking. But for some reason it is showing 99.9%. On first 4 days it was showing 100%. It must be 100% because I created it. But then again it is showing 99.9%? I dont know what is wrong with it. Just Extract both the discs. It is extracting just fine and burns 100%.

And even if you have doubts then you can download this one. Or just download that rar71 file from here

For those who are thinking that my previous torrent is freaked up, you can download this one. DONT delete the downloaded files from the previous torrent. Just download this one and give same download location on you HDD as the previous torrent.
