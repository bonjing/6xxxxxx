,Bak4mHell,2011-02-21T12:40Z,"@tieri :- No.., you just need the Disc 2 for the DLC's.
Disc 1 Contains the original game.
Disc 2: Contains the DLC upto 11-11-2010.
And by the Way this torrent is NTSC_J or Asia Region. I hope you read the description."

Disc 1: Contains the original game.
Disc 2: Contains the DLC upto October/Nov 2010.

And BTW this is an NTSC-J torrent. I hope you read the description."

,Bak4mHell,2011-02-24T03:27Z,"@dubbman:- The USA version is already available on TPB. BUT this is not the ultimate edition. This is only the basic original release with only few DLC content. No one uploaded the Ultimate edition for USA.
