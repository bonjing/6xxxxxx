About three things I was absolutely positive:
First, Edward was a vampire.
Second, there was a part of him--and I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how dominant that part might be--that thirsted for my blood.
And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.

Series Description...: Isabella Swan, Bella to those who know her even a little, moved to Forks, WA. in her junior year of High School when her flighty mother married a minor league baseball player and went off to spring training.  Rather than become a strain on their new marriage and their nomadic lifestyle, Bella instead chooses to sacrifice her happiness and moves in with her father in one of the coldest and wettest places in the Continental US.  But while the cold and the wet are definitely not two of Bella's favorite things, the town of Forks quickly begins to grow on her.

Within hours of moving in to town and getting started at school, Bella's eyes are drawn to the extraordinarily beautiful enigma that is Edward Cullen.  Handsome, confident, pale, and perfect, Edward first treats her with near-anger and frustration, but when she sees him again, his demeanor is completely different, and soon, the mystery of Edward is soon overshadowed by her head-over-heels love story.  This series is the story of the romance of Bella and Edward.  It is a Romeo and Juliet story, though with some definite twists and curves in the classic Shakespearean format.
