Ashampoo Magical Security 2

Encode files and burn them onto CD or DVD
Ashampoo Magical Security 2 integrates fully into the File Manager, which means it can be activated using the Explorer. Lone files or several files can be gathered in the program window, where they can be encoded and then saved on the hard disk or burned onto a CD or DVD. Once saved onto disk, the encoded files are safe and can be optimally transported. It is also possible to store the files in a self-extracting EXE archive which can then be forwarded to friends or work colleagues. The recipients simply have to activate the files. After entering the correct password, the archives then extract and decode themselves automatically. 

Please note: Ashampoo Magical Security 2 is also able to delete files to ensure their complete, non-residue removal from the hard disk Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ as whatÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s the use of the most sophisticated encoding system if, by using the appropriate program, the deleted originals can simply be recovered? 


New in Version 2: with compression and Email dispatch
In the new version, Ashampoo Magical Security 2 doesnÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³t only offer a completely newly designed display and innumerably improvements in terms of detail. Two further innovations lend the use of the tools even more value.

Compression: The encoded files can be automatically compressed meaning that they need less saving space. In this way, itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s possible to burn considerably more encoded files onto a CD ROM than was the case with the previous version.. 

Email dispatch: It is now possible to encode files in a single procedure and to send them as Email straight away. The Email function sends the files as PPENC attachments or as self-extracting EXE archives. The tool also packages the EXE files automatically into a ZIP archive so that they actually reach the recipient.
