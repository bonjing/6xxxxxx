VA HE GOT OUT HIS BIG 10 INCH
3 Disc Set
Audio CD February 15, 2005 
Label: Indigo UK
Format: Mp3@320

This set covers "risque blues" from the late 20's to the early 50's. It is the musical equivalent of walking down a dirty dark alley, the Southern heat searing you, stinking of Gin, looking for a broad, and hearing cats in heat yowling and prowling long into night. This whole thing is great and hilarious. Even by our standards today some of these songs are over the top raunchy and would have any PC Moral Crusader blushing and sweating in shame. Music wasn't always innocent thats a myth and this set proves it. There was even some old country music that was dirty back then. Anyways if your a fan of obscure gritty, and raunchy music from the good ole' days get this set. Also check out the original version of the "He Got Out his Big Ten Inch" song that Aerosmith redid but Bullmoose Jackson did originally, Bullmoose hands down leaves Aerosmith's version sounding limp by comparison..
