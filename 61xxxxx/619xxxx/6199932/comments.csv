[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T18:11Z,"The idiot has put this on all of my torrents. He hasn't downloaded any of them, he's just spamming all my torrents with the same stuff. HE also uses the name Kryptonite. Look out for him on all the other torrents, they are not genuine problems he's reporting."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T21:27Z,"If you want to see any other comments by icekool666, kryptonite2000 or Linuxloader1, just go to any of my other torrents and you can see he's saying the same things on every one. Obviously he's lying. I've earnt that trusted skull. It means my uploads can be trusted. He hasn't even got a single upload to any of his 3 names. It's a shame people like him make it difficult for the decent folks on here. I apologise on his behalf."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:04Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. 

Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. 

The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. 

Just download any 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. 

I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted.

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads."

,dobry_dzemik,2011-06-24T14:24Z,"great torrent, don't know why anyone would say otherwise!"
,mcreed24,2011-06-27T22:09Z,Not the best or the worst quality but the image is a little blocky especially on the lines etc. But tolerable. Thanks man.
,mcreed24,2011-06-27T22:37Z,Not the best or the worst quality but watchable none the less. Thanks dude.
,phonemateire,2011-07-09T01:44Z,very jerky copy not the best really
,Blinkerage,2011-08-08T22:55Z,"This torrent is absolute garbage, the encoder had NO idea what he was doing. I cannot believe this has over 100 seeds. 

A-9
V-2

Its like watching a fucking slide show"
,cz-aldaris,2011-10-25T08:23Z,"Really bad quality for a DVDRip. The real fps as it appears to your eyes is bad. So as some quick moving scenes. V:3, A:9"
,bonkai,2011-12-24T23:31Z,Unfortunately this is a bad rip. Don't waste your bandwidth.
,ace97,2011-12-29T02:29Z,"Okay so after all the comments going back and forth; half saying ""Oh yeah this torrent rocks"" the other half saying it sucks, then the dang poster talking about how all the bad comments are from one guy, here is my verdict:

Audio is fine, Video really is bad. I'm not sure what happened - I think the guy was trying, but it's honestly not worth downloading. I'm not normally picky for video or anything - but if I were you I'd download another one. "
[T],WildcardSearxh,2012-02-13T03:48Z,"Video is choppy, audio is great, movie is a must-see. The video problems aren't terrible and this is definitely the best copy on TPB."
,fingerfeller,2012-02-14T13:59Z,"thanks, "
,Bhakabaka,2012-03-30T08:24Z,"don't know what this guy did to get so much hate lol. this torrent is good quality, & that's that."
,stanleysnickles,2012-04-19T02:56Z,someone seeded the shit outa this torrent ... thanks
