Apple has seeded the sixth build of Mac OS 10.6.7 to developers for testing. Build 10J860 comes just five days after the release of the previous build, build 10J858.

No known issues are reported with the build, and developers have been asked to continue focusing their attention on AirPort, SMB file sharing, Bonjour, graphics drivers and the Mac App Store application.

Although no one can predict when Apple will release the public version of 10.6.7, MacRumors suggests that because of the increased pace of build turnaround and the increment of just two build numbers from 10J858 to 10J860, the development of 10.6.7 could be very near completion.

AppleInsider reports the delta update weighs in at 400 MB, 34.4 MB smaller than the previous update.
