I USED THIS SOFTWARE THE OTHER AND IT ACTUALY ASKED ME FOR A SERIAL, PERHAPS I USED A DIFFERANT DISC TO THE ONE I UPLOADED ???

ANYWAY..... IF YOU ARE ASKED FOR A SERIAL HERE IT IS, 100% GENUINE

32KD2-K9CTF-M3DJT-4J3WC-733WD

THIS SERIAL IS FROM A LIBRARY COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS 7 PROFESSIONAL (32BIT) """"AND WORKS 100%""""

I USED THIS SERIAL MYSELF AND ALL IS OK

ENJOY !!!!!"
,YHH,2011-03-16T10:08Z,"but if you have already used it, then how can us use it anymore? isnt it one computer, one license?"
,lbomber7,2011-04-01T06:10Z,"@YHH No. Normal keys work on like 3 ""personal computers."" 
""Key from a library computer"" would indicate an Enterprise key. Meaning unlimited installs for the company that bought it."
