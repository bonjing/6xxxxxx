,n00bOfTheTorrents,2011-02-24T17:25Z,Would BluRays of the first two happen to be floating around in FTP-land?
,Tondre24,2011-02-25T04:14Z,"Is the original 3D format kept in this Blu Ray version? So if I upscale it on my 3D TV it should be pretty descent 3D quality, taking into account the two bottlenecks:

1. Original formatting
2. Artificially calling out the 3D by using upscale function on my Samsung 3D HD screen

Anyone knows something what is the practice of releasing Blu Rays of movies that original screen in 3D for cinema? Can it be added as a paralell option or does it need its own release??"
,Tondre24,2011-02-25T05:26Z,Please answer when you are being adressed by a noble.
,joe4sale,2011-02-25T07:56Z,"Tondre24: If this were in .iso format and you mounted and watched using DVDPro, possibly. Since this is clearly .x264 (says so in the title) NO.
PS Your tv will ""upscale"" to anaglyph 3D not stereoscopic (what you see now in theatres).
PPS Sorry you wasted your money on technology that probably won't be around in another 2 years."

,joe4sale,2011-02-25T20:44Z,homericICON: what are you playing it on? played 16:9 for me.
,Seraphim8,2011-02-25T23:26Z,"Tondre24 I agree with Joe4sale... just not in such a mean way lol. It wont be true 3D like the movie was intended to be.... but if u like it... hell, good for u! I like to sniff my own farts but everyone else hates the smell. but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable to me :D"
,Tondre24,2011-02-28T04:13Z,"Hell boys, its worth it. I can watch HiDef 3D porn. It super-rules!"
,Boteus,2011-03-01T23:25Z,"Thanks a ton. Will seed, as always."
,Nilias2,2011-03-02T19:36Z,SEED!!!
,564369,2011-03-04T08:05Z,"@Tondra24

Yeah 3d porn is probably worth 4 grand. 

Good investment bro. "
,Tondre24,2011-03-05T08:48Z,"564, keep on being jealous, I'm lovin it. You dont know jack shit about anything, so go take a wank to your super-lame ancient TV"
,Avenged_12,2011-03-08T17:31Z,"haha, does it look like the cum is flying out at you?? Cuz that would be mega-cool. 3D cumshot ftw!"
,954blade,2011-03-23T21:08Z,Thanks aol.
,kenney303,2011-03-25T12:13Z,Maybe you should go out to a place and meet a girl and have sex with her. its a lot more fun then watching porn even if it is in 3D.
,Jf.cp,2011-04-01T14:19Z,"@Tondre24 , Actually 3D porn has been around for 10 or 11 years already. And its pretty sad that you think watching porn in 3D is worth a $2k TV and that it ""super-rules"". You should try to bang a real girl, that ""mega-super-rules""...."
