I was getting a bit bored of seeing the effortless emulator and rom packs, which anyone could just get for themselves from countless websites, so made something a bit different.

Glad they seem to be popular."

,trencej,2011-03-07T22:09Z,"Of course. Just press TAB. that brings up the mame menu, and you can customise the controls to your hearts content. I would reconmend changing th egeneral control settings, otherwise you will have to change it for each game.

If you have a pad, you can set the controls to that also."
,jayel1364,2011-03-12T06:49Z,"Customization options are fantastic, thanks trencej"
,trencej,2011-03-20T09:14Z,I cannot take credit for the customisation options. Thats just built into the mame emulator.
