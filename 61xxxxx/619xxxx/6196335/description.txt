Ultimate Mortal Kombat Arcade Collection 1.0 By Reasonware.

This is a collection Of the Best Mortal Kombat Arcade Games, Running in Mame, via a custom loader Made in Autoplay Studio, and packed up in Setup Factory.

The 4 Games included are as follows:

Mortal Kombat
Mortal Kombat 2
Mortal Kombat 3
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3

Arcade Games that have been left out, and the reasons are:

Mortal Kombat 4 - Dosn't run great, and was not that good

I Realise that a lot of emulated games and packs have been posted recently, However, with my little loaders, i am trying to put out something different. Hope you like it.

A Few People Enjoyed My Street Fighter Collection (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6191511),
And i got 1 good Comment. So to hell with it, i'll make a few more. I enjoy it anyway.

I will Take Requests, But bear in mind, It would be handy To be a collection of games, Not Singles. I May however, Create Genre Collections, Such As Shmups, Misc Fighters, Puzzle Games, Etc.

Current Collections Planned are:

Metal Slug Anthology
Bubble Bobble History
And Possibly A Capcom Side Scrolling Beat em up Collection

Play and Enjoy
