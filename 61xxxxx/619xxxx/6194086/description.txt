February 11, 2011 Hayes Carll is a dry-witted folk musician whose humble music 
is poised, but infused with humorous anecdotes. Hailing from Texas, the singer-songwriter first picked up a guitar
at the age of 15. He followed a common route, college and then singing on the side, moving around Texas in search 
of success. But his music is anything but common. He eventually returned to Houston, his hometown, and began to develop
 a following. That's where he released his first album, 2002's Flowers Liquor.

Almost a decade later, Carll has racked up a list of achievements, written three more full-lengths, 
and spent a good deal of time on the road, honing his craft and receiving inspiration. Carll has been named best folk
 and best new artist by the Houston Press, he's written music with Guy Clark and Ray Wylie Hubbard, and he's 
largely recognized as a lead man in a resurgence of Texas artists greatly influenced by Townes Van Zandt and Bob Dylan.

Carll's latest release is KMAG YOYO, a military acronym standing for "Kiss My Ass Guys, You're on Your Own."
Listen to his set from WXPN's World Cafe Live, as part of the station's Live Fridays concert series.
