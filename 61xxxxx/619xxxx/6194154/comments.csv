,defeatedsanity,2011-02-22T23:08Z,"@kingofny Go here to see what new release movies are available on the net: http://sceper.eu/category/movies  If you don't see a particular movie listed there, it isn't available anywhere on the net.

@Evol_Gamer  Props to your recent uploads. Your releases have been very nice quality. If I might add one thing, I would suggest providing an imdb link of the movie in question so people know what it is or what it is about. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/ (Although if someone isn't familiar with Scarface, They deserve a punch in the face :) Hope to see you stick around for awhile. Keep up the great work!"
