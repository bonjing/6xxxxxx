Two days ago I wanted to finally update my Gundam 00 with sexy Bluray rips. But, the only versions I found were not to my liking. The first was OCZ. It had English audio(waste of space), official subs (inferior to Menclave) and not so good timing (when a person cut over someone else, it would show the second persons lines above the first, but before he/she started talking, because of the shitty R1 subs). So, I turned to THORA, but their 1080p seemed like a waste of space (many would disagree, and that's alright). So, I made this re-encode from THORA's files, in 720p. Now, don't worry, everything is identical, and yes, the ordered chapters still work fine. The only bone I have to pick with THORA is that they stopped making regular chapters for the episodes after 13. Why? No clue, but I've never seen anime that uses ordered chapters and lacks regular chapters.
