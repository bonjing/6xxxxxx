This is the first special edition collection from Hed Kandi documenting 11 years of groundbreaking music and imagery that have defined the sound and vision of the worldâ€™s most iconic music and lifestyle brand. This collectorâ€™s item comes to you in Kandiâ€™s traditional unmixed format and the 4CD box set consists of the two main ingredients to Hed Kandiâ€™s success over the years, the biggest Kandi anthems including all the unavailable hits from back catalogue releases and a 100 page book consisting of the most iconic Jason Brooks artwork. The 100 page book features beautiful reproductions of some of the best images of the impossibly beautiful Hed Kandi girls created by Jason Brooks. These instantly recognisable images have captured the imagination of many as he continues to communicate the essence of the brand, image after image. Alongside the images are quotes from some of the most influential people who have helped shape Hed Kandi throughout the years.
