It is a classic and a great film so its no problem in that regard, but labeling it as a 2004 film misleads people reading your description. I thought that it was perhaps a remake like TRUE GRIT is a remake of a much much older Western starring John Wayne.  Had I known from the torrent description that it was the 1948 original movie (which I have seen a million times!!!), I would have NEVER even bothered to come to your download page. That is all, END OF LINE."
