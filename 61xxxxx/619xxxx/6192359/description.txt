The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) B & W

Director: John Huston

Bogart's best film. His portrayal of a callous, miserly disloyal sonofabitch was a marked contrast to the smooth benevolence of Rick in Casablanca; which is why the film flopped at the box office, the audience didn't want the actor they wanted the stereotype.

Bogart, Tim Holt and Walter Huston, the director's father; are roughnecks digging for gold in Mexico. Initial trust crumbles as the trio strike it rich, and greed and suspicion (or in Bogart's case madness) set in. Huston establishes the characters and in his own words "Watches them stew in their own juice." In fact the film is one long complex character study into the effect of wealth on a clan of wretches. Beside the subtextual themes of loyalty and male-bonding is the film's message - life is cheap. Note the motiveless deaths that occur and their effect on the other characters.

Huston's obssession with authenticity lead him to film entirely on location in Mexico (another reason the film bombed, as the audience couldn't accept anything other than a studio look) and include long chunks of Spanish dialogue. He won two Oscars for direction and screenplay and Walter Huston won Best Supporting Actor but the best film award went to Olivier's Hamlet (a mistake I believe). The fight scene in which Bogart and Holt beat up their boss must surely rank as one of the classic moments in cinema history.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
