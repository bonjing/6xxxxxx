,soupdude,2011-02-23T22:57Z,"Well everything is a transcode of the lossless CD, but at 320kbs its pretty high quality. Now it won't sound as good as say, lossless or vinyl, but it will be pretty good."
,queb,2011-02-24T00:58Z,Thanks for the info. I'll definitely check this out; their last record was pretty good..
,soupdude,2011-02-24T02:10Z,"If you ever get a chance to, see them live.. They sound better than the CD, which is something that is very rare these days."
,cia09fr,2011-07-17T17:04Z,I swear most artists sound better in real life...
,papazu,2012-05-13T17:53Z,Great! Thanks!
,papazu,2012-05-13T17:55Z,"And I agree with the uploader- sounding better live is becoming rare, with all of the overproduced/underskilled music coming out these days."
