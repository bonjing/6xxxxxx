*For example use Daemon Tools to mount the image.

*Proceed the steps and install.

*After installation extract the 2 cracks (actually the Zoo no SSE crack isnâ€™t     necessary anymore in todayâ€™s PCâ€™s, but you may notice that yourself :) in the Deviance folder.

*Copy over the cracked content to your game folder, for example C:\Program Files\Bam\Project Zoo

*Use the ZooLaunch shortcut to adjust the configuration settings (graphics + controls)

*Exit Daemon Tools and have fun with playing this wonderful game! Make a shortcut to your desktop from one of 3 possible EXE files (include the ZooLaunch shortcut) (in most cases you wonâ€™t feel any difference).
