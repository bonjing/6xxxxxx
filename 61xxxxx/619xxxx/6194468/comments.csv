I'll put the text I wanted to show up in the overview again below:


1.	For example use â€˜Daemon Toolsâ€™ to mount the image.
2.	Proceed the steps and install.
3.	After installation extract the 2 cracks (actually the â€˜Zoo_no_SSEâ€™ crack isnâ€™t necessary anymore in todayâ€™s PCâ€™s, but you may notice that yourself :) in the â€˜Devianceâ€™ folder.
4.	Copy over the cracked content to your game folder, for example C:\Program Files\Bam\Project Zoo
5.	Use the â€œZooLaunchâ€ shortcut to adjust the configuration settings (graphics + controls)
6.	Exit â€˜Daemon Toolsâ€™ and have fun with playing this wonderful game! Make a shortcut to your desktop from one of 3 possible EXE files (include the â€œZooLaunchâ€ shortcut) (in most cases you wonâ€™t feel any difference ;-)."
