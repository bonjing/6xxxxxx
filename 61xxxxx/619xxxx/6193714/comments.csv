,akshay_d,2011-02-24T13:08Z,"WTF!!!!!!!

Guys please don't download these videos, they do not contacin all the LOS.

In CD 1 there are LOS 1 and 2 and in CD 2 there are LOS 5.."
,zvnkt,2011-02-24T19:07Z,"Sorry guys!
akshay_d is right. I didn't notice this."
,bojkata,2011-02-25T16:22Z,"are you guys saying there's missing material, or just that each disk is combined into one file, instead of the several pieces (such as 2011.CFA.L1.Videos.CD01.1.avi, 011.CFA.L1.Videos.CD01.2.avi, etc.), usually found elsewhere?"
,zvnkt,2011-02-25T16:47Z,"@ bojkata:
Several pieces as you talk about are actually 01 file here splitted into. And 16 files here are not enough. They are just videos for LOS 1, 4,7,10.... for example.
The others now are still in mystery."
,bojkata,2011-02-25T18:02Z,"well, if anyone's interested I can post the full disks 1 through 11, parts 1,2,3 and 6 (out of 6) from disk 12, and part 1 from disk 16...."
,bojkata,2011-02-25T19:02Z,it appears that you have the first parts from each of the sixteen CDs
,stukm,2011-02-26T19:40Z,does anyone know where I can get the schweser 2011 L1 notes and full vids??
,Rymaa1,2011-02-27T09:50Z,I have stopped seeding this scam.
,varunstone2004,2011-02-28T06:24Z,Hi BOJKATA pls upload the CFA level 1 2011 Vidoes
,varunstone2004,2011-02-28T06:25Z,Does any one have these videos or can tell where to find thezzzzz
,sedned,2011-04-01T19:59Z,"There are roughly 80 segments in the level 1 schwaser videos. This torrent ONLY gives 16. The quality is crap, everything about it stinks of shit.

Use the 2010 videos, -only 10% of the syllabus has changed (most notably the replacement in Reading 12 with Technical Analysis. Find a full list here:

I have a suspicion this shitty shitty (compounded shit, heh) torrent was upped by  kaplan.

I quit seeding. I suggest you do the same."
,cahenry,2011-04-13T01:10Z,"THIS IS NOT A SCAM,,,, I changed the format from AVI to MP4 and somehow the length went for 16hrs to over 40hrs I have checked and almost all LOS are here!!"
,cajvpetan,2011-04-21T21:35Z,"GARBAGE.... it is not over 40 hours...

The original 2011 CFA 1 has 16 parts with 3 hours for each part....

This garbage torrent has 16 parts with 35 mins to each part."
,akshay_d,2011-04-22T10:49Z,"@Cahenry: Can you please tell me how to change format from AVI to MP4?? How did you change the format? I have the videos, how can I make them 40+ instead of 16 hours? Please tell us, it would be helpful to all.
Thanks."
,cahenry,2011-04-24T18:37Z,"I used a AVI to MP4 converter for Iphone 3gs, personally used dvdvideosoft.com free iphone video converter, but I think any would work. "
,lanuk,2011-06-01T08:55Z,Could someone please confirm if this works. I badly need CFA videos for my exam but there's no material available out there..seems from comments that the 2010 material here also has some virus:( 
,vs123,2011-07-29T18:50Z,"cahenry is right, use convertavitomp4 software and covert these videos from AVI to MP4 format. Here is the reason why this has occured:

Each file 2011.CFA.L1.Videos.CD01 was joined from uch as 2011.CFA.L1.Videos.CD01.1.avi, 011.CFA.L1.Videos.CD01.2.avi, etc... But in the process of joining, only the length of the first part became visible. Hence, even though the entire material was always there, it showed only the content of the first due to some stupid reason.

After conversion, CD1.avi, which was initially showing just over an hour got extended to more than 3 hours as the conversion fixed the file issues. 

Hope this helps. Convert all the files to mp4 and then you will notice that nothing is missing. 

Thanks for the upload zvnkt, as regards the quality, this is the only one available out there, so we might as well use this... :) "
,hck332,2011-07-30T14:17Z,True.  Convert to *.mp4 to see the full materials. 
,kuk008,2011-08-02T00:45Z,Thanks zvnkt
,va112233,2011-08-04T11:21Z,"Guys, converting from Avi to Mp4 is not working... can somebody share the full material"
,finama,2011-08-05T06:30Z,"It really works after converting from avi to mp4.

Thanks for the tip...."
,zulfiqarazam,2011-08-06T10:18Z,Does anyone know about the torrents for L2 videos??
,jwjwjw,2011-08-15T08:24Z,"Torrent contains 2011 material! Also converting files from AVI to MP4 does extend the time of the AVI's.
 Though one issue I have encountered is that 2011.CFA.L1.Videos.CD06.avi has issues and doesn't fully convert. Can someone please re-upload if they have the full version of AVI 06? 
jw"
,kamal88,2011-08-28T16:57Z,"this is great torrent the material is full just convert into mp4.
but after 2hr 35 min of quant video which is cd 2 has no voice please check it and let me know............."
,teevee,2011-10-25T02:19Z,The MP4 trick does work.  I'm going to try to up a new torrent with the proper files.
