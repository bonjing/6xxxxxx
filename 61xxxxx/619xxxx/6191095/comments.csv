,perper2,2011-03-15T21:51Z,"Hi
Thanks for the upload!
I think that I maybe have a solution to how to crack this. The cd is protected with securom 7.00.00.0002. It looks like I'm able to mount it with Alcohol 120%, but I get the error code ""Please insert the original disc instead of a backup (1000).""

With daemon tool I got a error code saying something about virtual drive, so it looks like alcohol 120% is able to look like a real cd drive.

So if you could pleas try to make a new image of the cd with Alcohol 120% newest version and choose datatype SecuROM *NEW (4/5/7)
and use a slow speed

Can get a 15 day trail version her:

,arthurmaxhill,2011-03-16T06:41Z,"Guys, can you please help!! How can I make this work?"
,oscar12,2011-03-18T10:50Z,"I confirm what perper2 says. I've used that method before with games that had the same protection and it worked. Here's a guide on how to procede:

Please try it as soon as possible and let us know the results and if it works please upload the other protected cbts you have. Thank you!"
,easyflyer,2011-03-19T17:54Z,"Alright guys, ran another image with Alcohol 120, latest version, and after multiple attempts using different securom burn options, the images do not work. 
I knew something of the life wouldn't work, because I get the error : ""Emulation conflict""
The new encoding detects the virtual drives. I've also tried hiding the virtual drives, still doesn't work. You are facing a touch cookie here. 
Reason why it is useful to buy quality software....such as this one. ;-)
I am still open to new ways, work at it, I'll try.
Cheers!"
,aerobird3,2011-03-21T10:41Z,"guys i did try to crack this tough cookie but its really too hard to crumble but i found a way to at least get the lessons out.

heres how it it ........just mount the image and browse to the system folder which contains the SWF files......just open them one by one to go thruogh the entire cd.........but it  will not open unless u have downloaded a player called flashMX.........hrere the link.....http://www.soft32.com/Download/free-trial/Macromedia_Flash_MX/4-353-1.html


its does not really crack the cd but it will give us its contents..........thats what we need ...knowledge.......cheers...."
,aerobird3,2011-03-21T10:43Z,sorry not the system folder..........but the content folder 
,oscar12,2011-03-22T05:29Z,"Hey aerobird3, your method doesn't seem to work. I had already tryed to do that with different flash players but they all said that the files were protected. They just show you the first frame and then a blue screen... Except for a few slides which are ok, but they are almost useless. I also tryed to decompile them but the result was the same. It looks like the only way to be able to view these cbts is that somebody really skilled (like the RESTORE team who cracked the human performance and limitation cbts) creates an .exe crack file to replace the original one."
,aerobird3,2011-03-22T14:54Z,well its working for me .its working on macromedia flash player 6  as well ..try that one

,mcdonnst,2012-05-25T21:17Z,"Hi Guys, its simple


I spent a long time figuring out how to back up my Gen Nav cd, Its actually very simple.

Im using Windows 7.

1. Open Alcohol 120. I used this version, worked a treat. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7190613/Alcohol_120__2.0.2.3931_Retail_Multilanguage_ADMIN_CRACK

2. Image making wizard

3. Select Securom New  4/5/7

4. Start

5. You have to burn to disk, it will not work as a image with Deamon tools etc. Well its the only way I could get it to work.

6. Select Image burn Wizard in Alcohol 120.

7. Next

8. Make sure Securom new 4/5/7 is selected and click start. (Enable buffer underrun and Burn RMPS to recorable media should be selected).


Hope this helps. 

I am looking for copies of for now
ATPL Airframes & Systems CBT

ATPL DC Electrics CBT

ATPL AC Electrics CBT


If you send us on liks to your torrents I will help seed."
,vipertarun,2012-06-05T06:37Z,"Got It Running!!!!!!

Here is how I did it :-

1 Download the Alcohol 120% from Mcdonnst post

2 follow the steps till step 4

3 now start a new virtual drive in Alcohol 120

4 Mount the newly created image in this virtual drive.

There u have it. I have win7 x64 ultimate. Hope this works for u guys too."
