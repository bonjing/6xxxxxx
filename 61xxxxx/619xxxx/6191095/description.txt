This is the cd image. It NEEDS TO BE CRACKED. Will not work without original disk in drive (doesn't run when loaded with Demonoid or similar).
If you have what it takes to crack this like the similar Physiology cbt, then go for it and share afterwards!
Cheers!





This interactive training course teaches the subjects of Airframes, Systems and Emergency Equipment up to the standard required by the EASA air transport pilotâ€™s licence syllabus. The course has been developed by aviation specialists and multimedia designers at Oxford Aviation Academy, one of the worldâ€™s leading professional flying training schools.

Though the course is meant primarily for student professional pilots, it will also be valuable to student aircraft engineers as a high quality introduction to airframes and systems. We hope, too, that General Aviation pilots who wish to expand their knowledge will find much to interest them here.

Qualified airline transport pilots might also find much to interest them, in terms of both fulfilling recurrent training requirements and improving their knowledge of aircraft systems. In order to assist students in their preparation for the ATPL examinations, this course includes over 450 EASA ATPL-style questions and answers.
