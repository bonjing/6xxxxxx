This has Tons of problems when unpacking the ISO to a Folder with WinRar!

So did the: MICROSOFT.WINDOWS.7.PROFESSIONAL.WITH.SP1.X64.RTM.OEM.ENGLISH.DVD-WZT that you also uploaded like yesterday, but then it was only problem with 2 files, now it's with 29 !!! files...

Look here:
=========

!   E:\Torrents\MICROSOFT.WINDOWS.7.PROFESSIONAL.RTM.WITH.SP1.X64.VOLUME.OEM.ENGLISH.DVD-WZT\7601.17514.101119-1850_x64fre_professional_en-us_VL_OEM_Professional-GRMCPRXVOL_EN_DVD.iso: Cannot create sources\dlmanifests\microsoft-windows-ie-clientnetworkprotocolimplementation\.

Hi, Thingy, Dude...
I wanna unpack ISOs due to that then you can install directly from a folder on another harddrive...
As easy as that!

And WinRar has ALWAYS been able to unpack all ISO's (except for those BluRay-ISO's, that ain't really ISO's...) that just contains images of a CD/DVD, so there's something wrong with this ISO - it ain't made the correct way, or else WinRar would have been able to unpack it without any errors!

[V],thethingy,2011-02-22T09:54Z,"LbL, ok, just install this;

http://thepiratebay.org/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300

then once installed you can just double click on the iso then select file or edit from the power iso menu then extract and that will place all the files in the iso to a folder of your choice or right click the iso and select mount then go to my computer and you'll see the iso virtulised as a DVD where you can access it in the usual way. 

this iso is the proper Microsoft one and its not been modified in any way. "
,jfcarbel,2011-02-25T03:48Z,Is Daz Loader not needed for VL editions?  Or does it work best with them as well?

Doh!!!!!"
,kimlik66,2011-03-06T16:52Z,"-- Hey, thethingy;
Truly thank you for your great efforts.

will this thing work without any extra requirements after i burn the image?

In other words-- i wonder if i would need any keys, activators, etc  after i burn the image on a DVD in order to install on the machine?

In case i need any of those tools; can you please direct us by giving us the link and the EXACT name of the tool we need to download, and then, kindly, explain step-by-step, as to how to use those tool(s).

Thank you again for your efforts and any assistance you may provide. "
,Leshalles,2011-03-16T12:44Z,"brianxxx: Winrar will usually extract iso ok.
Lbl: Problems when pathname (directory path + file name) gets to be too many characters, possibly due to the particular Windows OS limits or Winrar limits.
Solution: extract to root directory often solves problem. Otherwise rename very long base directory within winrar archive to something very short.
