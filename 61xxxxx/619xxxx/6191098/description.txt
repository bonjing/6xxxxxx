Comments :
1882, New Mexico Territory. Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch are itinerant 
lawmen, hired by desperate towns as marshal and deputy. The city fathers 
of Appaloosa hire them after Randall Bragg, a newly-arrived rancher with 
money and a gang of thugs, disrupts commerce and kills three local lawmen. 
Cole and Hitch contrive to arrest Bragg and bring him to trial, but 
hanging him proves difficult. Meanwhile, a widow has arrived in town, 
Allison French, pretty, refined, and good-natured. Virgil falls hard, 
and it seems mutual, but there may be more to Allie than meets the eye. 
Can friendship and skill with a gun overcome a pernicious villain and 
green-eyed jealousy?
