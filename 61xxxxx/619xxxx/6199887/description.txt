Part 1. Island of Marvels
David Attenborough tells the story of one of the most intriguing wild places on earth: Madagascar, a huge island of dramatic landscapes, where life has evolved in isolation for over 70 million years and more than 80 per cent of which is found nowhere else in the world. This episode reveals the island's most bizarre and dramatic places, as well as the unique wildlife which has made its home in each. Starring a wide variety of lemurs, Madagascar's own primates, from the rainforest's indris and sifakas to the crowned lemurs who scamper through the island's weirdest landscape, the razor-sharp limestone tsingy. Other exotic wildlife filmed include the fearsome fossa, the only large mammal predator on the island, chameleons, and the bright red, giraffe-necked weevils who build their nests with the complexity of origami. Finishing with a brief look 'behind the camera', revealing the challenges of filming the little-known wildlife of the island.
