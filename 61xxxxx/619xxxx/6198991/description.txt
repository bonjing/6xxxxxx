VA RAUNCHY BUSINESSS HOT NUTS AND LOLLYPOPS
Label Legacy
Released 1991
Format:Mp3@320

This sex-based set of early blues-oriented recordings has 19 double entendre songs and a humorous (and quite profane) "alternate" version of Lucille Bogan's "Shave 'Em Dry" that still could not be played on the radio. Among the performers are Lil Johnson, Lonnie Johnson, Barrel House Annie, Bo Carter and Buddy Moss. With titles such as "Sam The Hot Dog Man," "The Best Jockey In Town," "If It Don't Fit, Don't Force It," "Banana In Your Fruit Basket" and "You Got To Give Me Some Of It," the subject matter is easy to figure out. ~ Scott Yanow-AllMusic Review
