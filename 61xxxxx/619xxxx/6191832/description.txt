I found the solution for those who are experiencing the following World Builder problem after updating the game: 


Unknown argument type in message EnableMod 
The message EnableMod can not be used unit the errors are resolved 
Unknown argument type in message ng 
Unknown argument type in message SetMapOption 
The message SetMapOption can not be used unit the errors are resolved 

I didn't try it for Pandora update but works fine with SKIDROW Update 7. Ok, let's go:

1.Install the game with SKIDROW's sr-civ5.iso to the Installer's default destination. 
2.Apply the cracks (just copy the whole content from SKIDROW's sr-civ5.iso\SKIDROW folder to installation folder). 
3.Copy Sid Meier's Civilization V SDK into the installation folder. 
4.Find ModBuddy folder in Sid Meier's Civilization V SDK folder and run Modbuddy.updater.exe and specify your install path, then specify the user path which should be located under C:\Users\UserName\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5. 
5.Apply SKIDROW Update 7 (you can find it in torrent sites). 
6.Apply the cracks in SKIDROW's Update 7\SKIDROW folder coming with the torrent (just copy the content to installation folder).
After this step if you try to run World Builder you will receive the errors. So here is the magical step. 
7.First backup these three files to elsewhere (for ex. Desktop): 

CivilizationV.exe
CvGameCoreDLLFinal Release.dll
CvGameDatabaseWin32Final Release.dll
CvLocalizationWin32Final Release.dll


Then copy only the listed files from SKIDROW's sr-civ5.iso\SKIDROW folder to the installation folder:

CivilizationV.exe
CvGameCoreDLLFinal Release.dll
CvGameDatabaseWin32Final Release.dll
CvLocalizationWin32Final Release.dll


Ta taaa.... Run World Builder. Do what ever you want!!! 
But, now, we have the wrong version of executable and other core 'dll's??? 
Restore the files backed-up in step 7 to installation folder to able to run the game properly. 

DON'T FORGET! WORLD BUILDER WON'T WORK AFTER APPLYING THE PROPER UPDATE CRACKS!

If you like you can apply Pandora Update after creating the desired MOD or MAP.
