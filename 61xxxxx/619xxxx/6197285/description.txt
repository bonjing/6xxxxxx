Version 1.10.915 Latest (23/02/2011)

In the movies nothings works anymore without 3D; now the technique enters the home cinema and even the PC. Engelmann Software presents the world premiere Windows-Software MakeMe3D, which will be released soon. This software can convert existing 2D-videos automatically into the third dimension. The new 3D-videos are compatible to the known Anaglyph 3D glasses and to the new Stereoscopic 3D Hardware. 
3D is currently 'the one' new technique. What was hardly conceivable a few months ago has become reality long since. The audience in the cinema put on the 3D-glasses to watch movies in a completely new dimension. And a lot more is happening: the industry is busy tinkering with the 3D-Blu-ray Disc, the 3D-TV and the 3D-computer. This undoubtedly marks only the beginning of a new 3D-boom, which will keep entertainment electronics and IT-sector busy for the next ten years. 

MakeMe3D is extremely easy to operate: new technology does not necessarily have to be complicated. The program supports the import of 2D-videos and others in formats Video-DVD, AVI, WMV, MP4, 3GP, MPG and TS, to mention only the most important. The program stores the converted 3D-videos in formats AVI, MPG, MP4 and WMV. It is possible to select from numerous target profiles. For example, the video resolution is automatically adjusted to the parameters for iPad, PlayStation PS3 or Xbox 360. When converting a large number of 2D-videos the batch mode is an option. This mode converts all videos of a list and saves user precious time.

For 3D-conversion we use our self-developed object recognition and motion analysis. We can force vertical or horizontal output, realize page- or frame flipping, have the brightness adjusted automatically and set the depth effect completely variably.
