,kerrycherry,2011-02-25T19:25Z,"I've downloaded as many of the 320 torrents I could find, and they're all the same thing. 320 kbps versions of 128kbps tracks! If you're undiscerning about your audio, yay for you, but this sounds like total crap. Not seeding, I'll take the hit."
,EvIlHaVoc,2011-02-26T19:41Z,for a guy like kerryfairy to complain bout us guys that take time to upload our torrents shouldnt say shit to us....maybe he should go buy the shit instead of gripe bout it....again he can go fuck himself the loser piece of shit.....i converted my my avril torrent to 320 and he bitched bout mine to.......fucking goof....nice work by the way bro!!!!
[T],PeteSapai,2011-02-27T00:09Z,"And again i'm on kerry's side. re-encoding 128 to 320k is aboslutely ridiculous: it will sound the same (at best) and will take up 2.5x as much space. Big loss-loss situation. And again: kerry was commenting that's what comment feelds are here for. If you dont want negative comments, dont share this low quality stuff, and dont call this low quality shit ""high quality""."
,SharifaM,2011-02-27T01:53Z,"Sorry everybody...I just passed on the files as it was leaked to me.  It said 320, so that's what I wrote.  Didn't realize it wasn't really high quality.  Sounds great to me though. "
,queener666,2011-02-28T05:18Z,"Hey EvIlHaVoc and SharifaM, I really wonder about something.

What is your aim at converting original 128 kbit files into 320 kbit??? What is your purpose? Really? I'm not going to mention more space the files will occupy. 

But, do you really think when you do that sound quality gets better? For your information, it gets worse!

But your real purpose is to trick more people that you have uploaded something of quality, isn't it you bastards? 
Nobody needs your shit if you're uploading something that seems like a quality release but in fact it isn't. You and people like you ruin the file sharing community more than those hackers hired to sabotage filesharing servers. Nobody's depending on you to download anything, you're not obliged to upload anything and you can take your shitty upload to your fucking self. 

I promise I'm not gonna complain if you do that, even it is the only copy of a record in the world you posses, I promise."

@SharifaM, it is most definitely NOT amazing. 128kbps might have been in 2003, but in 2010, if you're going with mp3, 320kbps is a must! and not a re-encode."
