"Two Stories"

House participates in a school's Career Day 
and breaks a few rules by sharing explicit 
medical stories. Waiting outside the 
principal's office, he meets two fifth-
grade students (guest stars Austin Michael 
Coleman and Haley Pullos) who assess 
House's relationship woes and try to help 
him understand how his selfish antics get 
in the way of showing Cuddy how he really 
feels.

Enjoy :)
