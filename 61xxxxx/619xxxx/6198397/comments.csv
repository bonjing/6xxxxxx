there's allways 1

if you don't know by now that anti virus software don't like piracy and classes all activators/cracks/patches as either viruses or trojans.

29 seeders @ 00:48 on 25/02/2011 and only 1 person complaining about a trojan/virus (This Been You)

why would 28 people seed a trojan ????

my point exactly

it's because of people like you that i try not to upload anything like this (something very usefull) because after reading comments like... virus/trojan etc... nobody in the right minds want to download

PLEASE PEOPLE (PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALY USED THIS) 

COMMENT AND RATE SO THAT OTHERS KNOW THAT THIS IS SAFE

THANKYOU GUYS/LADIES LOL

ENJOY !!! "
