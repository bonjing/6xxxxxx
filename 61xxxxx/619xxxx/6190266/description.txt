Saturday 19th February

Matt Smith presents action from today's fixtures, including the fifth-round 
clash between Manchester United and Crawley Town at Old Trafford and the 
fourth-round replay involving Chelsea and Everton at Stamford Bridge. 
Non-league Crawley were taking part in undoubtedly the biggest match in their history, 
but the odds were firmly stacked against them. Elsewhere, even without cup-tied record 
signing Fernando Torres, holders Chelsea will have been confident of overcoming the 
Toffees at the second time of asking, having been held to a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park. 
The day's other encounters were Birmingham City v Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City v Brighton & Hove Albion.
