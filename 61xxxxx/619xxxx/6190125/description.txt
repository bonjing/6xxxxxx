    Tony and the Team get a unique opportunity to dig at an    
    army firing range at High Ham in Somerset and             
    investigate a series of mosaics first discovered 150     
    years ago.                                                
                                                               
    The mosaics hint at a grand villa, but as this part of    
    Somerset has been in constant use by the army for the    
    last century and a half, no one has ever had a chance     
    to really see what's under the ground.                     
                                                              
    To everyone's surprise the initial results suggest       
    there's been more than one villa on this site. Over the   
    following days a story emerges of the highs and lows of    
    Roman life in Britain, from the grand rooms used for      
    entertaining to the pitiful lives of the slaves who      
    lived on the edge of this high society.                   
                                                               
    The archaeology is impressive but the weather's not,      
    and as the temperatures plummet the Team hold a crisis   
    meeting. Could this be the first time in the              
    programme's history that the conditions force the          
    diggers to down tools?
