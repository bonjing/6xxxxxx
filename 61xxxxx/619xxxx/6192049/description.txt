Until his death in 2003, at the age of 95, Compay Segundo was one of the last treasures of Cuba. Rediscovered in the 1990's through the Buena Vista Social Club, he was awarded a grammy in 1998 and toured the world's most important venues. A summary of the most successful part of segundo's career, Gracias Compay: The Definitive Collection, includes all his hits, like the world-famous 'Chan Chan' (in the two versions recorded in 1996 and 1999), 'Macusa', 'Sarandonga', 'Guantanamera', 'El Camison De Pepa', etc.

The original booklet is included with all the lyrics and a text by his manager and friend Luis Lazaro, as well as photographs.
