cant find it anywhere"
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-23T00:21Z,"Yes, after this torrent arrive at more than 1 seeder (who is me), because my upload bandwidth is very low, 70-75 kB/s max. Sorry, isn't my fault. I do the best I can."
,bposaune,2011-02-23T05:16Z,"Hey Nepotu thanks for all of your hard work.  By any chance are you going to upload the fantasty draft in 720p like you did on some other?

Also, nobody has uploaded a 720p Saturday Night (Only dunk portion) or All star game yet. Are you going to upload anymore 720p?"
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-23T12:24Z,"Yes, in very few moments"
[V],Nepotu,2011-02-23T14:39Z,"For other parts of ASW in 720p I have sources, but I can't upload it because of lack of space in my little HDD and especially because my low internet upload bandwidth (max 80 kB/s). That is in this country. (In my born country I had 500 kB/s)."
