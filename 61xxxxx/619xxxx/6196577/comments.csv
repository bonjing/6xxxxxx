,SMOKINNN201199,2011-02-25T06:09Z,"@Dr_Dassler: Try reading the details before you download idiot.

Thanks hiest, will comment on quality when done."
,fuamiki,2011-02-26T00:47Z,noone wants to watch your mp4 bullshit...if it ain't avi...it ain't worth it...vlc all day mofo's
,LEERV,2011-02-27T14:18Z,"What is the matter with you idiots, so what if it's an mp4 file, just convert it with Format Factory.
You bunch of lazy losers."

I know you don't have the nerve to comment with your original TPB account."
,dac1949,2011-03-01T23:16Z,"hiest, thx for up and your good work!

""dogs are not allowed"", why? Certainty, they are more intelligent who the users: ""Dr_Dassler"" and ""fuamiki"" (Read the desccription before talk bullshit!)

thx, for share!"
,tackfurlo,2011-03-02T07:30Z,"Well...personally I prefer AVI, or more to the point, the DivX codec, I don't really care what format as long as it's DivX'd, best compression, minimal quality loss.  That said, I'd rather download the 888MB MP4 than the 1.36GB AVI that's got 1000+ more seeds.  I have an SSD so drive space is the real premium for me.  Besides, who the fuck has a modern computer that can't play MP4?  I mean, hell, VLC will play MP4.  I use Media Player Classic (VLC with less bloat) and it plays AVI and MP4 equally well.  To me, as long as I'm not burning 1GB per movie, it could be a freaking WMV for all I care.

So...yeah, DivX would've been nice, but seriously folks, it's free.  Be glad to get what you can.

(P.S. Sorry, my comments make MUCH less sense after midnight...)"

Thanks for the upload. Brilliant.

(As for the illiterate / too lazy-to-read the info commenters - notice how they have no 'Trusted' or 'VIP' status...they're just leeches. They create & share nothing & complain about the stuff we create / share. Q: If they want 'perfection'..as seen through their eyes, why don't create & share their perfect videos? A: They are too stupid to do it! ).

Keep up the good work  : )"
,pepolhtr,2011-03-04T06:51Z,well i have to say with all these comments i hoped to see a=/v=  but any way vlc will play anything if you get the codec for it and with hard drive space it can be a fu(n9  mkv for all i care or a rar with good quality but i will try and get back on a/v
,pepolhtr,2011-03-04T12:44Z,well looks like auto focus is on wavers in and out decent audio a7v4
,iamutham,2011-03-04T16:14Z,watchable...
,michaelrwatson,2011-03-05T03:00Z,"@angel2dmn , LEERV - You are morons. No one wants to have to CONVERT a video after downloading it. You want to WATCH it. Having said that, MP4 is okay... The real problem is x264 (h.264) which is NOT a standard yet. There are a dozen different encoders and not all players play the various variations (sorry, that was awkward). Hence, best to stick to XVID."

,R2d6.51,2011-04-25T05:44Z,"LEERV,

You are absolutely spot on mate. I hilited the FF you said convrts MP4's to AVI pasted it into chrome, hit the Google download link & in less than 1 minute had an interface command menu in front of my face allowing me to convrt any MP4 File to AVI.
Doesn't get any simpler than that.
I did this b-4 I DL the Flik.

Thanks for the tip.
As far as these othr whinrs, it unbelievabl anyone can be that brain lazy in today's world.
I cannot imagine they are able to even hold down a job, let alone manage their life.

 Their probably still living with mommy & daddy.

I spend at least 2 hours a day using a 35 lb chain saw to cut & drag several thousand lbs. of cut logs to keep me warm with a fire each night & early morning.

The best they could do is using a cigarette lighter in a vehicle to light a smoke & that's probably asking too much. LOL.

Their probably used to having some man servant light it for them.

Humanity has no future with brain dead silver platter airheads like that.


Anyway Kudos"
,maddys_comm,2011-04-28T19:55Z,"pretty watchable....

,Shungbat69,2011-05-03T13:28Z,Anyone know when it's coming to dvd?
