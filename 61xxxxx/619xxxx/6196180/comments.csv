,ErrorNo9,2011-02-23T13:26Z,"Great torrent! Fast download, the game is working flawless, no viruses, Trojans etc.

All what a great torrent download needs ;)!"
,peppureika,2011-02-23T18:08Z,It's not fair to pirate the first game of a small developer :(
,agranel,2011-02-23T18:15Z,Thanks!
,agranel,2011-02-23T18:16Z,"Well, i have a lot of original Paradox games. Gonna buy this one if i like it!"
,krbik13,2011-02-23T21:08Z,Does this one really work ? Because I donÂ´t want to experience same thing that I had with BACKLASH version. I had to reinstall whole system.
,TheGreatCanadian,2011-02-23T21:45Z,How come there are so many archived folders in the torrent? Which one contains the install file?
,grosbob123,2011-02-24T00:26Z,"@krbik13
You can always thrust the users with a Pink/Green skull icon because they are Thrusted/VIP members.

@TheGreatCanadian
This is multiple part archive. You just extract the first one (the .rar one) and Winrar will automaticaly take the files from the other part while extracting."
,TheGreatCanadian,2011-02-24T01:43Z,@grosbob123 I extracted the files from the archive with the .rar extension but all I see is a file with a .bin extension and one with a .cue extension. What do I do with those files?
,vincentdesrd,2011-02-24T05:11Z,"@TheGreatCanadian: You use Google...

I saw a few reviews for this game already. Looks like a solid title.

 Screw them for not releasing a demo before the game came out. 

Why should I even bother buying it now?"
,on99gamble,2011-02-24T08:44Z,demo for this game was released a week ago 
,sdnl1j2,2011-02-24T12:14Z,"@TheGreatCanadian

mount .cue file with daemon tools , http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/"
,motley666,2011-02-24T22:52Z,Play demo and buy the game.
,Ic4ruz,2011-02-25T22:23Z,"Buy it if you like it!

Why would you even upload this game it has no DRM and there is a demo!

I'm sorry but steling this game from what is almost an indie developer and their first game is just SAD."
,Ic4ruz,2011-02-25T22:26Z,"Buy it if you like it!

They are almost a indie developer, No DRM, it has a demo and it's priced affordably at 20$ on Steam.

Pirating this is sad.

,Ic4ruz,2011-02-25T22:27Z,Ups double post!
,beef682,2011-02-26T02:21Z,"It works, it may be just me but it would seem this game is a little hard due to the very unbalenced econamy system, I spend most of the game in dept and getting - ammounts in income for what ever reason, needs a patch.

good game though 7.5/10"
,Podestabr,2011-02-26T14:09Z,"This game seems to be real good, but i'm not feeling like buying it now because it's way too unstable... Cant play 5 minutes without a crash... =/"
,beef682,2011-02-26T21:15Z,"its stable for me, win 7 32
its just bad economy  makes it hard, again it needs a patch"
,Hotwired05,2011-02-27T00:38Z,"Very nice for their first game. A solid 7.5/10 if you like these type of games. Going out to WalMart to get right now, it's definitely worth the $20 and the developers deserve their profits from this title!"
,mikkomik,2011-02-28T19:00Z,"Working great, thx :D"
,meche89,2011-03-01T21:20Z,"I installed it after that clicked it, nothing happend.
What's the problem. I have all things that to play game. Thank you."
,f0lki,2011-03-02T00:18Z,"This game isn't compatible with Intel HD Graphic, and other graphic cards from Intel!"
,peppureika,2011-03-04T12:44Z,It looks like they already fixed a lot of things.. you need to register the game to get the patches though
,mynameinyourblood,2011-03-17T04:07Z,This game is $16 on amazon. 
,ivan_dam,2011-04-17T13:14Z,"Quick download, thanks a lot."
,David1544,2011-05-23T09:46Z,for some reason this does not install like the actual game. there are missing files yet it works fine... hurmz...
