SEASON 2 - EPISODE 7  : THE FINISH LINE, 44:19

A multi-stop mission to the Far North has Devan, Scott and Adam facing a series of white-knuckle obstacles. From an oil-spewing engine on one plane to a gas-guzzling engine on another, it's an ongoing battle to maintain fluid levels as they circuit their destinations. Add Joe's wrath to the mix and it's a mettle-testing journey they won't soon forget. Meanwhile, Audrey's northern adventure escorting a team of dog mushers to the 2010 Arctic Winter Games puts her in the driver's seat in a way she didn't expect.
