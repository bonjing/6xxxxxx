Have You ever wandered why your website traffic sucks while other, much smaller sites generate huge traffic on autopilot? You seeâ€¦ there is a secret behind such sites, itâ€™s called â€œviral functionsâ€. But what exactly is viral marketing?

Viral marketing depends on a high pass-along rate from person to person. If a large percentage of recipients forward something to a large number of friends, the overall growth snowballs very quickly. If the pass-along numbers get too low, the overall growth quickly fizzles.
