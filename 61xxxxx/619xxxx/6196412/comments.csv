[V],globeplus,2011-02-23T13:19Z,"To syntaxbr : thank you very much and i like to think that for this type of files (pratical files) i am always a valid option to the possible interested users , i recognise that sometimes the files games structure can cause circunstancial difficulties but the starting idea it is always getting the best size possible without beeing obcecated with that keeping more as possible the gameplay . 

Thank you and you welcome anytime to download any of my available files ."

Peace out, and downloading, wil seed for 2 weeks!"
[V],globeplus,2011-02-23T14:27Z,"To baronvorg : it is ok and certainly playable but have a little story , inicially after the installation it was only possible to play with an online account and in no way i was finding a way to play with offline account of the Games For Windows Live then i checked with more attention the game files and with a few details worked in an innofensive way i got the offline account working as an option but saying that not possible the saves , i am not totally shore but maybe on the end of the chapters can happen the saves anyway and why i am saying this ? because the game have the possibility to replay played chapters once you played , so imagine the next thing : no saves with an offline account but if you finish a chapter he it will be available on the play of the game next time you play , so even if it is possible saving during the game after you finish a chapter you can continue anyway and maybe someone knows more easy ways than this anyway but at least starting the playing on the last played chapter you probably got , so under this circunstances not so bad and maybe can be possible to really do the saves in someway anyway . "
,dubai1991,2011-02-23T14:56Z,does this rip have the save options????
[V],globeplus,2011-02-23T15:41Z,"To dubai1991 : what you didn´t understand on the before comment ? you probable can continue on the last chapter played and maybe somehow or with the game itself the saves options can be done anyway , under the circunstances this situation is really positive because inicially it was supposed that the game was only to be played with an online account .

Cheers ."

@Globeplus: Hi, I've downloaded the game, works like a charm, except there's no way to save, and whenever you leave, you have to start all over again (impossible to restart at the last chapter)."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-24T15:35Z,"BULLETSTORM SAVES FIX HERE AT THE NEXT LINK :

- with me using this very short file the saves feature started beeing available automatically on the launch of the game in the exact same file that everyone is downloading but a few users reported that can get an error message under certain circunstances or something , so my suggest is the next thing : include this saves fix on the Bin32 folder and run again the game , if causing any problem just remove it again .

[V],globeplus,2011-02-24T15:41Z,"To Colink69 and users that asked about the videos :

EXCELLENT WORK , why ? because they was worked with nice technics most of them incorporating the english audio on the videos , only a few without voices on the video , only shooting for example didnÂ´t needed this type of work , the english audio is extracted from the video then with nice tools only the picture with nice quality is worked and finally the extracted audio is incorporated nicely like the video it was like that on the video and the size of the video fantastic with normal size with perfect quality , only one or another without voices while the video passing didnÂ´t getted this type of work ."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-24T15:47Z,"Just to explain in a complementary way why the english audio is extracted and incorporated correctly after the video without the audio worked ?
because the same video have audio for many languages and to be worked perfectly with a nice size he needs to get only 1 language incorporated to the audio work normal after the work , what i mean is that if i did the work without extracting and incorporating only 1 audio language after the work on the video , it was impossible to keep voices or maybe the audio itself on the worked video file .

If U unable to save follow the speps provided by globe in previous comments, if U getting errors before launching then google with the error name. Then U will find the solution how to fix it.

Globe spending lot of time in rips nowadays, I already a fan of this guy. Finally thanks for the game, I will get this game defnetly worth buying last but not least I will seed for a month.

,lkyslevin,2011-12-26T05:27Z,Hey guys thanks for keeping this alive and making it possible for me to get it! Kudos to globe for making this-even if there are some glitches it is amazing what you have accomplished here and anyone who just complains and whines about something involving this can go and do it themselves. That said I have been patiently waiting and keeping my client alive for a week and have only just completed it-only to find that I have NO CLUE HOW TO RUN IT! Anyone who can help it will be much appreciated and some basic steps would be amazing! thanks for all here!
