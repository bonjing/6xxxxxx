The opening couple of tracks on Aucans debut album are deceptive, I wonder if deliberately so, as they give very little hint as to the sheer raw wondrous brutality of what is to come. Blurred is a lovely Portishead-esque lilting number full of beauty and peace and while Heartless that comes next is more upbeat the two combined give the impression that Black Rainbow is going to be an easy listen of cheerful electro-pop. Wrong!

As Heartless fades its way out suddenly the bass drops, and oh my, what bass it is, and from Red Minoga onwards this album takes a significant turn left and descends in to the heart of darkness; a sometimes terrifying yet ultimately magnificent journey.
