[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-26T21:33Z,"Ignore that clown above.

If you want to see any other comments by icekool666, kryptonite2000 or Linuxloader1, just go to any of my other torrents and you can see he's saying the same things on every one. Obviously he's lying. 

I've earnt that trusted skull. It means my uploads can be trusted. He hasn't even got a single upload to any of his 3 names. It's a shame people like him make it difficult for the decent folks on here. I apologise on his behalf."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T03:07Z,"Eh up, the idiot's back. He's been banned 3 times and soon it will be 4 times. All his comments then get deleted. 

Ignore his comments on the quality of this, he has posted the same on all my torrents. 

The quality is perfect as it is a proper DVDRip. You will not find a better quality torrent than this. 

Just download any 1 of them if you want to check, they're as good as you'll get just as all my uploads are. 

I don't upload anything that isn't the best out there. I've got that trusted skull because I can be trusted.

Man-o-tor has his own page on Suprbay dedicated to tv shows, my torrents feature heavily on his page and he's an impartial trusted Piratebayer whose opinion can be trusted. Go and have a look at what he's saying about my uploads."
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-01T12:41Z,"First, definite thank you for the additional torrents. The vast majority of them I already have but I found some things that may be of better quality than what I have.

That being said, the quality of the M:I set is good; definitely DVDRip. Embedded subs for the foreign language would be better but the included .srt files make up for that.

Overall:
Video: 8/10
Audio: 9/10 (embedded subs would be 10/10)

Thank you uploader."

,Captain_Seasick,2011-10-16T11:51Z,"Only ""problem"" I've got with this upload is the COMPLETELY unnecessary addition of around 500 other, completely unnecessary torrents added to the upload itself.

Damn shameless. But, 'side from that, good stuff."

,michaelrwatson,2012-03-19T21:05Z,"Does anyone know, are the SRT files only for the NON-ENGLISH parts..?

Most people don't want subs all the time, e.g. when they're *speaking* English. "
