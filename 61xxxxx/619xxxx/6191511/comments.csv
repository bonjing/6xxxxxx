Anything in particulat that you would want mate?"
,iceache3,2011-02-23T18:31Z,"How come I can't download this torrent?

It just says no input file selected? I would love this collection :)"
,ricky21121,2011-02-23T20:05Z,"Would love to see a collection of shoot'em up or some Platforms.

1942 series, Darius titles or Defender

I don't know if the Capcom vs Snk is even possible on Mame but if it is. Maybe include 720 in a platform collection.

And thanks for uploading the MK and Metal Slug. These are great!"

Use the MAGNET LINK, That's how I had to do it."

Requests read and Being worked on My Friend.

Capcom VS SNK does not run in mame yet, However SNK VS Capcom Does. I may do A VS Series at some point.

720 is a bitch to play on a keyboard, due to the rotating joystick on the original machine. Even with an analogue joystick, its just not right.
But i will see what i can do."
,DrizzX,2011-04-10T00:25Z,Is the keyboard really the only way to play this? Joystick and Xpadder don't work. This is useless keyboard only bro.
,trencej,2011-04-11T09:12Z,"Drizzx.

press tab to change controls. im not sure if if the controls are set to use a joypad, but xpadder does work, i just tested it."
,Evil9,2011-08-01T21:01Z,"Shit dont work, NO INPUT FILE SELECTED error when selecting Download."
