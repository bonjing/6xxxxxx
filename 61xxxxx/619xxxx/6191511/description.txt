Games that have been left out, and the reasons are:

The VS Series Games (Vs marvel, VS Capcom, VS SNK for example) - Cant get a whole collection In mame

Hyper Street Fighter 2 the aniversarry edition - Not needed with all the other games here.

The 3d EX series of games - Don't run great, and were not that good

Street Fighter the Movie - Simply Sucks

Street Fighter 4 - Not Emulated. Just get the PC version, Or on a console of your choice.

I Realise that a lot of emulated games and packs have been posted recently, However, with my little loaders, i am trying to put out something different. Hope you like it.

If it proves Popular, i will make more, And maybe, even take requests :)

Play and Enjoy
