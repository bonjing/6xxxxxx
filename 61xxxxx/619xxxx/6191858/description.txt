Spiritual suffering E.P is the first release by Matt j Watts
under his debunkt moniker
and also his first release on Lobe records, the independent
label which has previously released music by quality acts
Arrow!!!, Franz Kirmann, Breakbot and Fakesch.
Spiritual suffering is a slightly unconventional, edgy but jovial
affair, perhaps aimed at the more curious of dance fans.
Flirting with IDM, electronica, house and techno, infusing bass
heavy and organic production, intense beats and live
percussion, which help create debunktâ€™s distinctive sound.
Sci Fi, inexplicable love for science and a chronic lack of
sunlight are the muses behind Mattâ€™s creations, while his
musical inspiration ranges from the more recent dance acts
such as Nathan Fake, the Bays, Audion, Modeselektor,
Cursor Minor, Vitalic, Extrawelt to the everlasting classics such
as The Orb, Orbital, FSOL and Hexstatic.
Debunkt also performs live, joined by drummer Nick Holder +
special guests for audio/visual performances
The E.P was written, programmed and produced by
Matt j Watts with additional drum programming by Nick Holder.
