,adidas951,2012-05-06T23:22Z,dont download dis shit! wen u start it WILL COME OUT AS JUST A BLACK SCREEN and nothing else after.. Downloads a Piece of SHIT!! dont waste ur time -_-
,Bwhiskey,2012-05-10T12:28Z,"This WORKS perfectly fine.

For people getting a BLACK SCREEN (and need to restart) after it shows 3 controls ...

1) Open Configurable USB loader
2) Set the alt dol: to mk7.dol 

Works like a charm after that.
