** Plot **

Mass Effect: Redemption is a four-issue comic series that explores some of the key events leading up to Mass Effect 2. Its narrative "picks up just as Commander Shepard disappears and is left without the support of the crew on the Normandy in the lawless Terminus Systems. Shepard must fight for survival, and will be assisted by close companion, Dr. Liara T'Soni, to come home alive." Liara's adventure is an extended storyline with major ramifications for the Mass Effect universe, and will expose readers to some of the new aliens, locations, and factions introduced in Mass Effect 2.

Mass Effect: Inquisition is an eight-page mini-comic that explores the character of Captain Bailey. It is written by Mass Effect 2 lead writer Mac Walters and drawn by Jean Diaz.
According to Walters, Mass Effect: Inquisition is "a character study of one of the more interesting figures that occupies this universe." and, like the other comics, is intended to provide "a view of the universe outside Shepard's vantage point", in this case, C-Sec officer Captain Bailey.

Mass Effect: Incursion is an eight-page mini-comic that follows Aria T'Loak's encounter with the Collectors one week prior to the opening events of Mass Effect 2. The events of Incursion link into the events of the comic mini-series Mass Effect: Redemption. Incursion was made available on June 21, 2010 through IGN.
