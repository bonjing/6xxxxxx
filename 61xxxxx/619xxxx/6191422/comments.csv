,dreadzzz,2011-08-23T18:21Z,"Is it me or theres no key and you can only use the ttrial ?

If so what is the purpose of this torrent ?"
,cojon,2011-09-04T07:49Z,"Good stuff, many thanks!

I'm one of those who would not have software were it not for the fine efforts of people like you. I'm disable with almost no income. 

I notice this does not yet cover the Linux Ext-4 formatting , and I guess I'm surprised that Acronis has not caught up with that as it has been out for some time.  Not a problem of course, as an open source partitioner will do it. "
,Selim873,2011-09-27T05:45Z,"@cojon

There really isn't much reason to add that filetype, could you just make a fat32 partition and tell your Distro to install on there?  It'll automatically convert to an ext-4 format."
,SiavashTheOne,2011-10-16T18:13Z,thanks friend! perfect.
,xseyss,2011-10-24T01:29Z,"this is the trial version and a serial is not supplied

kkeibul wtf? properly name your shitty torrents."
,asdf672001,2011-11-24T09:37Z,Thankyou Kkeibul for your generosity.
,spifkitten99,2012-01-25T15:33Z,"This is just a trial. No serial or crack included.

What the fuck are we supposed to use that for? I could have downloaded that on their own homepage directly.

Useless."
,batman79,2012-04-02T10:04Z,"chudddds, you dumb bastard, it doesnt matter if it ""works great"" if its just a trial version you can download off their own fucking website."
,ze3ma,2012-04-16T20:07Z,"Thanks, Kkeibul! Works great! 

Serial is included, guys. Look closely! :D"
,Lauderdale,2012-06-16T10:37Z,"xseyss, spifkitten99, batman79, 
The serial is on the third line of ""Acronis Disk Director 11 Home.txt"". Read all supplied info before offending people. 

Many thanks to Kkeibul!"
