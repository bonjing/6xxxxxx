Fall Of The Albatross is a genre blending band from Queens, New York. Spastic, soothing, sexy, heavy, intense, groovy, passionate, tear-jerking, smooth, and beastly are all words that apply to the music and personas of the band. FOTA loves to make you dance, sing, cry, thrash, headbang, bang bang, drool, laugh, melt, and get naked.
