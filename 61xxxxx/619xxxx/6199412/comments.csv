,saffyg,2011-03-09T20:04Z,For the big file: I have a samsung 3d led tv and will try to play this file via a USB Hard drive. Will the audio work fine with the Audio Return Channel which is connected to a Denon AVR which supports ARC ? I know for a fact that the optical out port cannot support dts master hd audio or true hd
,sujaylove,2011-03-13T06:51Z,can anyone tell me ..how can i watch this ? which player i want to use ?
,divxclub,2011-03-30T04:32Z,"Thank you very much for upload ! I have 2 things I want to say.

First this release audio will not work out of the box on Samsung HDTVs looks like you have to mess with file and decode it so TV can understand audio format. And Second for some reason in 3D mode picture is not showing correctly it looks like it's offset a bit I am not sure how does it call or may be because it's designed for other 3DTV but this is second time I see same issue. First time I saw it with Legend of the Guardians animated movie. So I don't know how to fix any of this problems too easy.

Thank you once again LG ! I got all of your releases !"
,shadowgp7,2011-04-22T10:29Z,"Lig...what is the difference with your previous release of the same movie? (Which i have downloaded)

P.S:Great work and thanx for all the 3D movies!"
,LigGeorge,2011-04-27T22:05Z,This one is better and it hasn't the sync problem between left and right image.
,blkhu,2011-05-06T12:21Z,"Ok, friends,. I gotta say I don't have 3D TV, and now I downloaded this 12G shit. Is there anyway I can convert this into 2D movie? Thanks///////"

MAKING A REQUEST PLEASE UPLOAD THOR (2011) 3D"
,myps3,2011-10-18T22:01Z,"Both are working great, even the 2.7 GB Quality is not bad at all

The good thing is I only copied the file to a flash USB and connected it to a Samsung P64D8000 and from the TV Remote chose the 3D mode to Side By Side and it merges Both pictures together and performed 3D perfectly

Thanks A LOT"
,Galfred1000,2011-11-30T17:21Z,"Wow, it's from LiG?
Screw this, worst uploader ever, full of buggy shit."
,crwdjm,2011-12-04T13:41Z,"When I go to play the large file all I get is ""Audio format not supported""  Can anyone say why? 

 I have played a number of mkv 3d files with success on my new system but there are too many ""failures"" happening to make downloading these huge files worth while.

Regards "
