,brianbadger,2011-02-22T01:11Z,Keygen from older version no longer valid - generated serial works for base game but not for any of the expansions. Do you have serials for the expansions which work with v5.000?
,brianbadger,2011-02-22T01:19Z,Or an updated keygen compatible with v5.000?
,Kaosunoburinga,2011-02-22T02:48Z,I posted all the keys for the expansion in the complete torrent's comments
