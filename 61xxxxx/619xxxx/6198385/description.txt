Tagline
The Burlesque Lounge has its best days behind it. Tess, a retired dancer and owner of the
enue, struggles to keep the aging theater alive, facing all kinds of financial and artistic
challenges. With the Lounge's troupe members becoming increasingly distracted by personal
problems and a threat coming from a wealthy businessman's quest to buy the spot from
Tess, the good fortune seems to have abandoned the club altogether. Meanwhile, the life of
Ali, a small-town girl from Iowa, is about to change dramatically. Hired by Tess as a waitress
at the Lounge, Ali escapes a hollow past and quickly falls in love with the art of burlesque.
Backed by newfound friends amongst the theater's crew, she manages to fulfill her dreams
of being on stage herself. Things take a dramatic turn though when Ali's big voice makes her
become the main attraction of the revue.
