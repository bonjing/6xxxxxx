,kameko,2011-02-25T20:22Z,is this actually the full movie or what?

Thx for upload .BONE. keep up the gr8 work

This version's much better than Feel-Free's

The English .srt included syncs pretty well and translation's a-ok

Yes there's the Chinese hardsub but if you use Media Player Classic and tweak the .srt position to the top then there's no problem

gr8 upload =]"
,jauser,2011-02-27T12:09Z,"ok, found the two best subs from subscene
either one will work well, no more ""sub duration"" blah blah

1) http://subscene.com/english/Shaolin/subtitle-414530.aspx
2)http://subscene.com/english/Shaolin/subtitle-414851.aspx

thanks me!
you're welcome!"
,jauser,2011-02-27T19:21Z,"scratch that, only the first one is good"
,checho_0,2011-03-06T11:17Z,"jauser read the comments on that sub you recommended and look at the picture of the uploader... now tell me if you think these subs are good.

There are no good subs for this movie they are all delayed like .5 of a second. If you think you can still watch a movie like that you're sadly mistaken. "
,checho_0,2011-03-06T11:18Z,only the second one is good is what jauser meant to say
,sbm_from_la,2011-03-19T20:35Z,This video has hard coded chinese subs in it and the English subs you use merge with them.. making it very difficult to read.  The best way around that is to use VLC to change the color and perhaps make them larger to allow the english subs to be more distinguished.
,jangchub,2011-04-07T07:41Z,"I've tried both of the English subs jauser linked to, and i can confirm that only the first one is acceptable. The 2nd one has the same text but the subs disappear much too quickly during . In the 1st one, they usually stay on screen long enough to be read. (So you can safely disregard checho_0's comment saying the 2nd one is better.)

For convenience, the best one is here: http://subscene.com/english/Shaolin/subtitle-414530.aspx"
,kadappa,2011-05-05T18:56Z,thanks :)
