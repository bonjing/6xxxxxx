,bkrazy,2011-02-22T21:31Z,no there's no english version you dumb fuk
,Dramat,2011-02-23T03:40Z,"Hey Bone, I would like to ask you something:
Can you please add this movie as NOT-Highres? I can not watch Highres (my PC sucks:( and I would really want to see this 1. DVDSCR version is without ending and many of subtitles are missing.
I would be Grateful if you could :)"
,Dramat,2011-02-23T03:43Z,"BTW it is not nice to call your fellow downloader ""Dumb Fuck"" (!) ;)"
,somedude.1001,2011-02-23T06:44Z,"Hey dumb fucks, the .srt file is the subtitle :D Be grateful that this isnt a shitty voice over English copy."
,crayed,2011-02-23T06:46Z,"sure the srt is included, but still there is hardcoded subs which are in the way for the srt file so i cant really read the subs. any idea how to make the hardcoded subs disapear..."
,withus,2011-02-23T10:15Z,"theres Chinese hard coded sub, and cannot read the english sub. any solution for this?
and thanks for the movie the problem is i cannot enjoy this movie with this hard coded sub."
,iridis_alpha,2011-02-23T10:35Z,the hardcoded Cantonese subtitles are really annoying on this as they appears a fraction of a second before the english subtitles do .. so you can either crop off the bottom of the movie (crazy) or make the english subtitles really large with and on a black box  background.
,QborT,2011-02-23T17:27Z,"Since the release has simplified Chinese subs hardcoded to the release your best option is to use a media player that can force the English subs to the top centre.

Personally I would suggest people wait for the proper HK release of this movie it won't have hardcoded simplified Chinese subs.   

Feel-free re-encoded this from an HDTV release, there is no proper DVD or BR for this movie,  despite their claim that they used a Bluray. P2P groups have a bad habit of lying about their release, it is a shame."
,moncypher,2011-02-24T04:56Z,"use VLC to play the movie.
change the subtitle position in the preferences setting. ""Force subtitle position"" to 50px; then save.
close vlc then open the movie again. ;)"
,bkrazy,2011-02-24T16:41Z,use VLC and position the sub right in the middle of the movie... LOL
,pengos,2011-02-25T07:38Z,"here, at http://subscene.com/english/Shaolin/subtitle-407284.aspx
although the subs will be displayed on top of the hard coded chinese ones. "

,pengos,2011-02-25T07:46Z,"V/A ? Plz give your comment, guys."
,headZ,2011-02-25T22:32Z,"There are subtitles called  with the name NG 720p , they contain all missing parts and all correct translation , idk what was link tho . i downloaded it and it works."
,pengos,2011-02-26T00:12Z,So Slow. Plz Seed. Don't hit and run...
,kmart,2011-02-27T02:16Z,"Poor english subs.
A lot of places they say

,jauser,2011-02-27T12:10Z,"ok, found the two best subs from subscene
