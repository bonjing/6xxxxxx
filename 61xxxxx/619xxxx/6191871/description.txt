           For Gothic Callie, her deaf sister Ariel, computer nerd        
           Chris, popular Sarah, and misogynist Ricky, their evening      
           plans are about to be re-written. Taken to an abandoned        
           military training school, they finds themselves the            
           target of 5 sadistic killers, each with their own unique       
           and different style of killing. They fight for their           
           lives against sociopaths who know their environment            
           intimately, becoming increasingly outnumbered as their         
           friends are killed.
