Plot

â€œAmanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italyâ€ poses the question of whether Knox (Hayden Panettiere), the Seattle honors student accused of murdering her college roommate Meredith Kercher (Amanda Fernando Stevens) in 2007 with her boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (Paolo Romio) and acquaintance Rudy Guede (Djibril KÃ©bÃ©), actually committed the crime or was herself a victim. Referred to as â€œFoxy Knoxyâ€ by her Italian prosecutor, Guiliani Mignini (Vincent Riotta), and the press, Knox was painted as an oversexed, remorseless killer during her two-year trial leading up to her conviction and subsequent sentencing to 26 years in jail. Marcia Gay Harden portrays Amandaâ€™s mother, Edda Mellas.
