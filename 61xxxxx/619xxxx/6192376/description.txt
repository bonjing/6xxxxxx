
Plot Summary for HONEY:
(Bal - original title)

The young boy Yusuf's best friend is his father, who supports his family's
modest life with the honey he collects from tall trees in the forests of the
remote Turkish countryside. Yusuf is a quiet boy, and his mother is concerned
for his future. Perhaps he will follow in his father's footsteps, or perhaps
school will offer him other opportunities. But the honey crop is failing, and
Yusuf has trouble learning how to read. The greatest fear strikes when Yusuf's
father doesn't return home from the forest.
