,subtitles_report,2011-07-01T15:22Z,The English subtitles on this are completely bananas. There's whole scenes that are missing dialogue. Great quality though! :P
,AlfNader,2011-09-10T21:04Z,The subs are indeed off. This is because the European blu-ray did not include English subs and the release group seems to have attempted to resync the criterion dvd subs with this.
