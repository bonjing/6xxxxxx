Story: 

Gay romantic comedy following the endearing Blaine (Nicholas Downs) 
as he attempts to meet Mr. Right. On an online chatroom he meets sweet, shy 
Xander (David Loren) who has just moved from Texas to Los Angeles. 
They immediately hit it off but when the men exchange pictures of themselves, 
Blaine realises too late that he has sent a photograph of his roommate, 
Cameron (Adam Huss), by accident. This results in Xander and Cameron 
going on a date and leaves Blaine wondering if he has missed his chance for love.

Frustrated by his ongoing failure to meet Mr. Right, Blaine stumbles upon what might be his perfect match in an online chat room-Xander, a sweet, hunky guy who's recently moved to LA. Smitten, Blaine then finds that he's been chatting to Xander 
under his go-go dancer roommate's profile, setting in motion a convoluted comedy of errors with romance as the ultimate objective.
