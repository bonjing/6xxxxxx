,Kb1325,2011-02-23T22:18Z,"Cool, I will be downloading this. I Like your torrents Yify.. The quality on them is awesome for the size and helps save room on my hard drive, i've even replaced a couple 1gb+ rips with yours.. 

I have a few requests if you wouldn't mind taking them into consideration:

Rising Sun 1993 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107969/
There is a copy on TPB that I downloaded. It doesn't have English subtitles for the Japanese parts though, was wondering if you could get one with them added.

The Mask Of Zorro 1998 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120746/
There is a copy on TPB that I can download if you don't want to do it. Just wondering if I can get it in your quality.

The Mighty Quinn 1989 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097880/
There is a copy of it on TPB but it has Swedish subtitles...

The Boondock Saints 1999 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/

Would like these in your regular 720p quality if possible, There are blu-ray rips for all of these except The Mighty Quinn. Thanks in advance!"
