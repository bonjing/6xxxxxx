Installation did not complete, and now I have a message ""This Windows-copy is not leagal"" I tryed ""Windows Loader"" and ""Remove WAT"" nothing helps.. So I think that SP1 update, it left something.. If this don`t ask any activation, maybe this may help... Anyone have same problem? :)"

Windows 7 must be activated by genuine product key !!
Try to add SP 1 to your windows installation disc and reinstall the Windows !
Existing some programs to help you to do this work."
