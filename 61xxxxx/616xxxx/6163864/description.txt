if u didnt download gmod2011, better dont use it
it may mess ur gmod up.
i made another simple patch, zip is only 20 mb big. it updates ur version so that u can
join updated servers, but u dont get the fixes and changes of the update, like npcs can use crossbow,
players breath, players hold a hand to ear when listening to chat
(i only saw rebels can use crossbow after using this patch, yet)
i recommend to use the full patch with bin and garrysmod folder
(paste them over ur garrysmod and bin folder in main directory -not the bin folder in garrysmod folder)
i made a backup of the dec 2010 bin and garrysmod folders,
ill upload that too.
