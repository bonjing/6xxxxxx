Encoder's notes: 

There were no subtitles in the source nor on subs sites, so I decided to make my own from scratch. I did English, French, and French because those are the languages I'm fluent in. A Portuguese friend who whishes to remain anonymous kindly did the Portuguese subs. Note that I haven't translated a few lines from Gaelic because I don't understand a single word. 


Note: A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie. And don't fall for fakes, grab our encodes from the source @ kingdom-kvcd.net or from our trusted accounts elsewhere.
