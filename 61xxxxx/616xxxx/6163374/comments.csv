01:12:00,861 --> 01:12:04,861


it says ""Magicians do not exist"" I think"
[V],room101bellboy,2011-02-11T00:28Z,"@ killy69:
No, I left that line out on purpose in the English subtitle because you can read it in the note (I kept the timestamp but deleted the text from the srt file). 

However, that line (""Magicians do not exist"") is present and translated in the French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles. "
,renilives,2011-02-13T02:05Z,"Sorry to sound (read?) like an idiot, but how do you add the subtitle track to the video?"
[V],room101bellboy,2011-02-14T14:16Z,"@renilives:
It depends on the media player you use. Most have a file tab which allows you to browse to, and select, the .srt file you wish to be played along with the movie. 

If you use VLC Media Player, it will auto-load the subtitle (.srt) as long as it has the same file name as the movie (.mp4) and both are located in the same folder. So you could do this: 

1. Copy the .srt file and place it in the movie folder. 
2. Rename the .srt file to this: The Illusionist [L'illusionnist] (2010).srt
3. Open the movie with VLC.

,javks,2011-04-07T20:40Z,"great torrent, love that the portuguese subs are included, great quality"
,Dragonite_9,2011-06-08T01:15Z,"Thanx!

Although (technically yes it is multisub, but..) imo you should not call the torrent multisub if its only 3 languages + english, it's kinda missleading :/

Thx for the torrent anyways!"
,Dragonite_9,2011-06-11T02:12Z,"Well quality is good!

But god damn worst piece of crap called a movie I've seen in a long time! 

They LITERARY SPEAK ONLY 30 SENTENCES, can NOT AT ALL RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE, do as you want ofc, but I really recommend to stay away from this, just TERRIBLE! 

(Come on, hardly 50 WORDS SPOKEN IN 1 HOUR and 20 MINUTES, COULD NOT STAND THAT, you just wait and wait and wait for them to speak, and when they NEVER DO START TO SPEAK, it just drives you crazy! You've been warned hehe!)"
,sdfef,2011-08-27T10:00Z,"@Dragonite: This means u seriously lack d aesthetic sense needed to appreciate dis movie..u hopelessly lack creativity and u hav got d most superficial eyes which cant penetrate the marvelous unspoken pathos dis movie has created..we abhor u for judging dis movie only on d basis of dialogues but also have a feeling of sympathy for ur ""Creativity stunted brain""...u r a retard who was unable to observe the unspoken melancholy of a failed magician,d innocence of a rural girl,the anguish of the rabbit.....and above all the enchanting background score which acted like dialogues every time they were needed nd said so much more...so my suggestion to Dragonite is to watch dis movie again after 15 years...every body..i highly recommend u dis movie(i dnt know bout dis print as i already had one)...my fav cinema of all time......."
