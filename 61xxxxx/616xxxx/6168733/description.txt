MiRACLE Presents:

Stag Night (2010)

If the mysterious plague sweeping the nation wasn't bad enough, Dean 
is still going ahead with his doomed wedding tomorrow morning. That 
leaves him with a choice. Pick up the button holes and chocolate 
fountain as instructed by bridezilla Elaine, or go with five mates (and a
stripper) to play 'Zomball' at a top secret military compound where you
get to shoot zombies with huge stun guns. Disobeying the golden rule
of Zomball ('never never humiliate a zombie') the stags face 
overwhelming odds from the massed undead and each stag is hunted
down. The truth about Zomball is finally revealed and suddenly the 
mother-in-law is the least of Dean's problems....
