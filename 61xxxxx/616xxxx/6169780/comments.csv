,murrambingi,2011-02-13T01:05Z,"From the sample i can see that the sound has an echo and the picture has too much contrast also the sample has hard coded Spanish subs.

V = 4
A = 2"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-13T02:07Z,"Yea. Screens look good but when you check out the sample, you can tell that it's not that great.

It's half watchable. Whatever is on the left side of the screen is high in contras and the right is dark. But even if you get past that, hard coded spanish subs kills it.

Overall, just wait.
V:4
A:3"
,cskills,2011-02-13T11:33Z,"A = 6
V = 6

The Spanish subtitles are annoying (for me)."
