,madbarry,2011-09-19T23:09Z,"I have vista basic, not sure how to get the game to work. Its still in my Utorrent downloads, not sure what to do next. (bit of a noob...)"
,tommyh83,2011-09-27T21:50Z,it doesn't need installing or a crack. if its not already copy the file to ur c:/ drive and just play. (i think?)
,TSKILL,2011-09-29T20:16Z,"To clarify, for those who don't know about the audio, there was audio on older versions of CM, I believe there was audio on CM 2 and CM 96/97, but this version definitely had no audio."
