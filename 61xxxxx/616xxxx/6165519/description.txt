Placebo are an alternative rock band formed in London in 1994, currently consisting of Brian Molko, Stefan Olsdal and Steve Forrest. To date, they have released six studio albums, six EPs and twenty-nine singles. The band have gained a considerable amount of international recognition, selling over one million albums in the UK and over ten million worldwide.

Placebo are best known for hit songs such as "Pure Morning", "Every You Every Me", "Infra-Red", and covers of The Pixies' "Where Is My Mind" and Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill". Their style has varied greatly. The band's first album featured a raw sound and a fairly minimalistic instrumental lineup, but subsequent albums have had a slower, more melancholic tone, and they started experimenting with synthesizers and other, less traditional, forms of sound production (particularly after Black Market Music).
