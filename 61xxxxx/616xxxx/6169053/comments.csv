,kliujgtuik,2011-02-14T17:39Z,"It would be reallly nice if people could just thank the uploader without emulating Oliver Twist (""could I please have more"").  Thank you for your contributions from me, a smallville fan who hates watching the CW on network TV.
YOU ROCK!!"
,sach87,2011-02-14T19:24Z,"First of all kliujguik, I thanked the uploader. And second who asked u. I asked from the uploader. If he wants he will answer me. And what's wrong in asking for more?? So mind your own business."
