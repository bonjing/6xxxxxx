LONG: ASAP aka the new incarnation of DOT is using many of the same tricks they did
including junk headers in their AVIs to pad it to size. By including these junk
headers they are making their releases unplayable in some standalone players without
remuxing. Included in /PROOF are pictures of what happens when you try to play their
releases in the Phillips DV642. The files are renamed due to the 8 character name restriction

If you simply remux the file in Vdub, the result will be 1mb smaller and play perfectly fine
however there is no reason to be padding releases and causing incompatibilities with playback

We thought this practice was done away with. Guess we were too hopeful. Enjoy thisworking
release. Oh and lastly, how about cutting the end a bit better, it looks like it's missing something
but it's not

**Yes we know the pictures are sucky quality but they do the job and yes we expect to be nuked
but ASAP already got nuked on this issue the other day and then unnuked but obviously the problem
isn't fixed **
