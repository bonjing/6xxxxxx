"Bixby's Back"

In an attempt to avoid turning into that old 
boring couple, Phil and Claire decide to 
revisit their Clive and Juliana role-playing 
rendezvous from last Valentine's Day. 
Meanwhile Jay has planned an elaborate 
surprise evening for Gloria, but his plans 
keep getting thwarted, and an admirer comes 
between Cameron and Mitchell on V-day, but 
they can't agree whom the admiration is 
directed towards.

Enjoy :)
