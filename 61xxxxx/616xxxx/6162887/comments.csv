,silent69,2011-02-10T02:32Z,This is not an official release from abgx.net and probably is nuke!
,silent69,2011-02-10T02:35Z,wait for the official release and abgx protection for xbox live!Playing this will get you flag and banned!
,sage1210,2011-02-10T04:56Z,Did any one try swelogz released ?
,Shonosuke,2011-02-10T09:22Z,"The repack from swelog works 100%.

This one freezes when the Demon Village stage pops up in Arcade mode/online mode

And since Arcade/Online mode is the only fun mode (Mission mode and Training mode get boring)

I suggest you get the other release"

,arghmaytay,2011-02-15T16:34Z,"Can everyone just get LT+ firmware and stop asking about AP2.5? Also can we get a confirmation on this: does this download work? If not, make sure you're not just playing the SAME FILE off your hard drive. If you installed a different version of this game on your hard drive and are expecting to get a different result with a different disk, there's your problem. Your Xbox is just going to verify that you have the right game, then play from the hard drive. Lets get some confirmation on this."
