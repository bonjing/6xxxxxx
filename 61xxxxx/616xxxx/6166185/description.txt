Just across the Charles River from Boston, we find ourselves in Cambridge. Through the middle Sixties, few towns in the north-east could boast as being "blues towns". Given the amount of dazzling recordings coming out of that city through those years, one can only think Boston & Cambridge can stake that claim.

Boston had the Unicorn Coffee House and Paul's Mall. Cambridge had Club 47. Into the summer of '66, Club 47 would see both Howlin Wolf and Muddy Waters.

It's Blue Monday, so why don't I keep the jabbering to a minimum and let these men sing for themselves...
