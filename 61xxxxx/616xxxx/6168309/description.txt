     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      A specially-commissioned documentary in which renowned
      Harvard professor Michael Sandel looks at the philosophy of
      justice. Is it acceptable to torture a terrorist in order to
      discover where a bomb has been hidden? Should wearing the burka
      in public be banned in Europe, if the majority of citizens
      disapprove? Should beggars be cleared off the streets of London?
      Sandel goes in search of Jeremy Bentham, Immanuel Kant and
      Aristotle, three philosophers whose ideas inform much
      contemporary thinking on justice, and tests their theories
      against a range of contemporary problems. Filmed in Berlin,
      Boston, Athens and London, this thought-provoking film includes
      interviews with the world's great philosophers, modern-day
      politicians and thinkers from all around the globe.
