,muffins64,2011-02-26T03:03Z,Help! I could not get the serial. I tried LucasML's suggestiomn but it did not work.

,TheButtPiratier,2011-03-04T16:33Z,"yeah I need help too haha, I'm a bit of a noob with my new mac and I got to the step after the register offline, but I still can't seem to figure out how to get the Activation Key in the next step, I tried everything out of the instructions. I could be doing something wrong but I'm not sure, help? anyone?"
,omgyjya,2011-03-11T00:10Z,Alright someone needs to fix this or make a video showing how they did because none of this is working. i have tried so many things including some sudo stuff but it wont work. The permission denied thing needs to be fixed and also what does terminal say if its works?
,nofences7,2011-03-14T01:01Z,"I figured out how to get the offline activation to work:

Follow LucasML's instructions to get around the permission denied error in terminal. The second time you run the keygen it should work. Then Terminal will ask you for your offline activation (or something like that, I don't have it in front of me), just paste the text that the instructions tell you to enter on the website and hit enter. Terminal will then give you an activation key that you can paste into the application and it should work.

Anyone know how to get the soundbank working though? I tried the chmod u+x thing but it didn't seem to work. Thanks for any help on this."

,TechTO,2011-04-04T13:44Z,"READ THIS BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING

I've found that a Mixture of both LucasML and iDawko's comments have helped

1: Install the Software from the .dmg

2:For Username and Key ID enter anything, but make sure you enter as much data as it can fit so that the ""Offline Activation"" button becomes available.

3: Choose Offline Activation and stop at the ""enter key thing"""
,TechTO,2011-04-04T13:51Z,Sorry stupid thing aint working got to for instructions http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/9282/screenshot20110404at946.png
,strathq,2011-04-05T15:16Z,"OK... i just tried a whole bunch of things and got it to work... I followed TechTo idea...

1: Install the Software from the .dmg

2:For Username and Key ID enter anything, but make sure you enter as much data as it can fit so that the ""Offline Activation"" button becomes available.

3: Choose Offline Activation and copy the serial it gives you...

4. Open Terminal - drag & drop the keygen onto it (without writing anything) and hit return...

5. You get a keygen Embrace logo and at the end it says....
Enter your offline activation request code:

6. Enter or copy & paste the code you got from offline activation and hit return...

7. You should then be given another serial... copy & paste and you should be good to go!!!!!!"
,Jmreen,2011-04-14T12:14Z,"I feel like I'm missing something here, whenever I drop the keygen into the terminal and hit return all I get is a message that says ""Permission Denied"". Then when I hit enter after I paste the offline activation code all I get is ""No such file exists""...... help?"
,Luwu,2011-04-17T06:39Z,"LucasML has it worked out, 
follow those instructions and watch for the keygen file to turn to a terminal file. 
Put everything on the desktop, makes it easy. "
,Chaz112,2011-04-22T21:39Z,"works great! thanks, there will be an update soon so that gp5 tabs wont be changed by gp6. if you could upload that when its released that would be great"
,MacPaulo,2011-05-08T16:55Z,"It has eventually worked!
For those who are getting ""permission denied"" as me, put the keygen file on your desktop, and type in the terminal chmod_u+x_(drag 'n' drop your keygen file). You can see that your icon have changed from a standard file to a terminal file. Note that the ""_"" means that you have to enter the spacebar ;-)"

,atlastone,2011-06-06T20:12Z,"Program the drums export them as midi and import directly into Pro Tools 9 (Xpand2) and it's fully compatible. Love it.

This is the fastest way for me to make midi, the editing in Pro Tools is awkward. Is there any program besides Guitar Pro that has the ability to make scores/tabs so easy?"

,sungjune94,2011-10-24T16:45Z,"I had the same problem~ but i got it to worked now
I typed 'keygen_osx' on finder
and it showed me two files of 'keygen_osx' :

1. A document looking (white paper)
2. A Termainal looking (terminal type)

I always opened termainal and dragged the 1. in the terminal and it said access denied all the time

However I just opened the termainal one and i got the right one 

hope it helped (y)

Thanks uploader."
,legend233,2012-03-04T02:45Z,"Here's what worked for me, up to a certain point. 

1. After opening up the GP6.dmg, hit offline activation when asked to register. Leave that window open. 
2. Now go into terminal (type terminal into spotlight and the application will come up) and type
chmod +x 
be sure to include a space at the end of that. DO NOT PRESS ENTER. 
3. Now drag the keygen.osx or whatever into terminal so that it looks like this (minus all the location stuff):
chmod +x keygen.osx
4. Now press enter. The keygen.osx will become executable in the folder. 
5. Open it and follow the instructions. 

This got my program activated, but I'm having playback issues. I've installed the soundbank successfully, but it doesn't play any sound when I hit the play button. Anybody figured out a way to fix this?"
