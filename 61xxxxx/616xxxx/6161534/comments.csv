But for my part I have to say that computer read books is a no go.
But again, thank's for the effort in uploding."

My main goal is to allow the knowledge to be disseminated more easily, and because people are rather lazy this days, the audio book is a kind of solution.
Content is important - and they figured out some stuff long time ago, but people are not listening, nor even hearing !!! "
