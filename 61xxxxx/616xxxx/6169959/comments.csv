,Hima69,2011-02-13T05:10Z,"can I pick your brain. I also want to encode movies from DVD. I downloaded Ripbot, but also need to download some container like Matroska. I went to the Matroska site, but have no idea what I exactly need to download (a filter, a player...etc). 
Would you please be so kind to point me into the right direction....

Kind Regards."

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T11:09Z,"@Hima69: For playback - install DivX 1.0 Pro. On TPB are few torrents, and you'll get full-fledged Matroska and MP4 playback system. Everything you need I packed

and it is best for Matroska too. 

@kunio85: Sorry, but nowhere to be found. Shorts tend to have short life."
