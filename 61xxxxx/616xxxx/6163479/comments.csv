Nice cracking job dude. I mean I could give a shit if they logged me, but isn't it customary to test a release before uploading it?"

my bad i dont have an iOS device/dont want one ?

release is bad.

just wait for the next.

and if it's craked, it wont coonect to the dev team, so even if you were ""logged"" they wouldnt know you have a cracked release once a working one is out."
