      4 POLYPHONIC SAMPLING SYNTHS                                            
      4 subtractive synths with 8 voice polyphony. Each synth has two         
      dedicated insert effects and can use samples or dual oscillators in     
      mix, ring or sync configuration (choice of 36 different waveforms).     
      Each voice has a 2 pole resonant filter, 3 envelope generators and      
      4 LFO's, all configurable via a patchbay. Perform and record            
      controller movements using dual X/Y pads, a pitch bend wheel and        
      accelerometer. NanoStudio comes with 128 ready-made synth presets       
      to get you started.

      Edit your samples using NanoStudio's built-in wave editing tools        
      (with multiple undo/redo) and record your performance using the         
      synths or the 16 sample trigger pads. Adjust pitch, pan, volume and     
      envelopes and assign each sample to one of the 3 output busses,         
      each with its own effect sends and filter setup.                        
      SEQUENCER                                                               
      Record performances in real-time using the keys and trigger pads or     
      create patterns and controller sweeps by drawing them in the piano      
      roll editor. Arrange your patterns into a complete song using the       
      track editor. You can edit while the song is playing and every          
      operation has multiple undo/redo.

      Use Nanostudio's mixer to monitor levels and get your final mix         
      just the way you want it. The mixer's two global effects sends          
      allow you to individually apply reverb and delay effects to each        
      track. When you're ready to share your mix with others, use             
      NanoSync to copy the exported .wav file to your Mac/PC over Wifi.
