After a friend is attacked, Stephanie tells Jim that she wants to join forces with him to help catch the perp. But when Jim informs Stephanie that he's built for crime fighting - and she's not - the competition is on to see which one of them can solve the case first. Meanwhile, Daphne feels like Jim is invoking a double standard when he allows JJ to date a senior but won't let her do the same, and Katie learns some disturbing news about Joshua, aka The Watcher.
