This is my very first torrent, and its of Marvel Vs. Capcom a rom for PSX. It's an awesome game and it pretty much made my day when I finally found and downloaded it, with the release of Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 on the horizon, its a good time to go back and play this classic. I'll seed as long as I can, and I hope that you guys will do the same!

Hit me up at flexthekid@ymail.com for any torrent requests you guys may have, Though I mainly plan on doing throwback roms (The rarer the bettter) and some anime series in AVI format, because I likes to stream them to my Xbox. 


Enjoy! And feel free to leave a comment if you likes :3
