Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926) Silent, Tinted B & W

Director: Harry Edwards 

Wonderfully encapsulating the wit and charm of the silent cinema's childlike clown, Harry Langdon's Tramp, Tramp. Tramp blends outrageous slapstick with romantic sentiment to recall the forgotten pleasures of a more innocent age.

In an effort to save the family business, a shoemaker's son (Langdon) enters a cross-country race with hopes of walking away with the $25,000 prize -- never bothering to note that the race is staged to publicize the huge footwear corporation that is crushing his father's livelihood. During the course of his westward hike, Harry woos the corporate boss's daughter (a young and fetching Joan Crawford), is thrown in a chain gang, and is dangled from the edge of a cliff (in a scene that rivals Harold Lloyd's clockface escape in Safety Last). Before the finish line can be reached, Harry is caught in a violent tornado that devastates an entire town -- a sequence of spectacular comedy and destruction that no doubt inspired the hurricane finale of Buster Keaton's Steamboat Bill, Jr. 

In a recent review of the film, critic Maria Schneider wrote, "Langdon was most often cast as an oblivious innocent adrift in a corrupt world, a formula that made him terrifically popular in the mid-1920s...An acquired taste, Harry Langdon's gentle absurdities and slow rhythms take some getting used to, but patient viewers will be rewarded."

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
