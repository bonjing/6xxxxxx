,GhostCow,2011-02-11T22:26Z,Game works perfectly. Thanks! I'll be buying a copy when it's in stores.
,keith28,2011-02-11T23:32Z,swelogz this game is tha shit thanx for the upload took a little time to download but well worth the wait. To you all who can not get this to work or having problems you just don't know what you are doing this works great played through multiple times about 7 have all characters unlocked no problems nor ap.2.5 Thanx agai uploader
,Actromophile,2011-02-11T23:40Z,"Yes this ""works"". As in, it starts and everything is fine until you reach the Demon village level..
So could this be a firmware issue, or are you ppl trying to make us download a broken game?"
,GhostCow,2011-02-12T00:58Z,"I've played the demon village in test and arcade modes and had no problems with it. However, I have not played online as I am too paranoid to play while signed in until the day it comes out, so I can't comment on online play."
,sage1210,2011-02-12T01:07Z,"I think ""the demon village"" crash problem only happen in some modded machine but I still not found who ""not touch online"" have this problem....even in the previous released of this game.

,Actromophile,2011-02-12T01:25Z,"@ghostcow:
Did you run this game in abgx or patch it before burning? which firmware are you on?"
,GhostCow,2011-02-12T03:22Z,"I had my xbox modded by a local modder so I don't know what firmware he used. Probably whatever was the newest about two months ago. I didn't run the game through any patchers, I just burned it with dvd decrypter at 2x and was good to go. People with crashes may want to try installing to the hard drive as most games crash for me unless I install them."
,Actromophile,2011-02-12T11:53Z,"This is weird.
I probably have the same firmware as you and I tried installing the game to my harddrive and that did not help.
That damn village level freezes the game anyway.
So the only way to fix this for me is probably to download a scene release or to try patching it somehow.
I'm no expert so it would be nice if someone with more knowledge could help."
,Actromophile,2011-02-12T13:51Z,"back to downloading I guess.
will have to settle for vs with my friends 'til it's done.
This one works for most ppl as it seems, but I guess my advice would be to not download this release.

Anyway, WHAT AN AWESOME GAME! :D"
,Slickb4ck420,2011-02-12T19:31Z,"i am using old ass firmware 1.5 on a hitachi drive. Anyone having problems , i dont know what to tell u. I AM BURNING THE GAMES AT 8x I DUNNO WHY PEOPLE SAY TO BURN SLOW. mabe shitty burners... neways , OLD ASS 1.5 firmware and a burned disc at 8x still no lag or freezing in demon village just played it through twice on arcade , with 6 different characters. If your game freezes. just wait 3 fuckin days for the release, its not that goddamn serious. and it takes a whole night to download ANYWAY."
,GhostCow,2011-02-12T21:04Z,If someone who has problems with this release gets another one working please report back here. I'm pretty interested to find out why this one doesn't work for some people.
,GhostCow,2011-02-12T21:08Z,"Also, here is a guide for how I burn my games. This may make the difference: 

1. Download DVD Decrypter

2. Run DVD Decrypter and open up your IMAGE.DVD file in Notepad so you get the layer break number.

3. In DVD Decrypter, using the menu list at the top, go to Tools then select Settings

4. Go to the ISO Write Mode tab. On the right hand side you will see a section called Options. In there is a Layer Break category with two radio buttons. Select the second radio button, User Specified. Now, in the Sectors in L0 textbox enter the value that is located in the IMAGE.DVD file after the ""LayerBreak="" text. Hit OK. [Because all 360 games need the layer break at the same location, you should only have to set this option once!]

5. Load the .iso file, burn at a low speed such as 2x or 4x using a good DvD+R DL such as Verbatim brand.

6. Install to you're xbox's hard drive and play."
,dynamo-joe,2011-02-15T19:53Z,"Works fine for me, demon village works had no problems with it.

thanks swelogz!"
,dynamo-joe,2011-02-15T19:54Z,"works great! demon village works fine had no problems with it.

Thanks swelogz!!!!!!"
,dynamo-joe,2011-02-16T17:22Z,"WORKS GREAT 100%, DEMON VILLAGE HASNT FROZE FOR ME

THANKS SWELOGZ!!!"
,Slickb4ck420,2011-02-21T14:57Z,"GhostCow, its not that serious. download xbox backup creator and agbx like the rest of the world. Run the Iso through agbx then burn through xbox backup creator 8x! not 4x not 2x .. why? I have a very large collection of games (over 100) burned at 8x and they all play perfect 100% of the way through."
,ene831,2011-02-22T10:41Z,Works Thanks :)
,Metalprofi666,2011-02-24T01:31Z,"i tried to install the game into HD but couldnt, but i could play the game without installing into it ..interesting ha?"
,omegalos5,2011-03-05T23:20Z,does anyone know if anyone has uploaded the new dlc?
