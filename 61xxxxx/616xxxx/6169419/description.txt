Thanks to Kaz77 for these recordings. I converted the files from .shn to FLAC using SWITCH Sound File Converter. There were some problems downloading the files, but it seems to be OK now. The text below has been copied from the original uploader.




Bruce performs an amazing sounding acoustic concert here in a very small venue. I was seated dead center in the front row balcony for this.
This is my best recording to date and is often mistaken for a soundboard recording.
The audience was very quiet and the acoustics near perfect.
This show is way too good to keep for myself and close friends, so here it is for you good people to enjoy as well.
