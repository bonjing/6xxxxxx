,cymadra,2011-02-10T19:09Z,sorry about the double post.
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-02-11T09:05Z,Her's and English language Workprint - enjoy... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6166623/Tucker_And_Dale_Vs_Evil_%282010%29_-_ENG_WORKPRINT
,freeworkman3,2011-02-11T17:28Z,Is there anyone that is going to mix the english audio to the russian dvd? Or is it not needed and the workprint actually not missing any of the special affects?
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-02-11T17:47Z,I tried all day yesterday with the two sources before upping them. But it looks like there would be a big amount of work to do. Maybe a big RG could manage it - but not me :(
