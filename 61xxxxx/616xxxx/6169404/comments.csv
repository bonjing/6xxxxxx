A/9 
V/9
Really Good Marvel animated movie... 
Many Thanx to the extremezone for a Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:) "
,DeanMachine16,2011-02-12T19:41Z,"I don't know why people hate on Smallville so much all the time.
I think it's improved a ton [not really a major spoiler] since they stopped doing the ""meteor-freak-of-the-week"" formula in the first few seasons and finally started giving us some other popular DC characters instead.
I'm gonna miss it after this season. :-(

At least we'll keep getting these DC animated movies.
If they made a live-action Superman movie like this animated one, I don't think anyone would complain.

And by the way:
DC animated universe > Marvel animated universe"
,snowbirds,2011-02-13T01:28Z,"These movies would be great if the animation wasn't so horrible.  It's like watching Saturday morning cartoons on TV....  I guess I'm spoiled by Japanese animation...

Thanks for the up!"

,lobsterboy25,2011-02-13T14:51Z,"@richardpa This is DC Comics, not Marvel.

@zakimar1 Apparently you've never read the comics.  Superman has, at several instances complained about having powers and also complained about losing them as well.  It's called confliction, every superhero has gone through it.  Wolverine, Spider-Man, Batman, Flash, etc.  If you actually read the comics, instead of paying attention to Saturday Morning variations of DC/Marvel Animations, you would understand this and not make that comment.  As for Smallville; you do realize that Lex Luthor is dead, right (Clones don't count...)?  You didn't pay attention did you?  Chloe is on, well now she is.  Also, yeah, let's have Aquaman and others be more frequent in a television series based on Superman, ooh productive reasoning there Bosley.  The only reason why Green Arrow is on so much is that in the comic books there was a HUGE team up of the two. Also, the producers realized that Oliver brings in the ratings as the show itself does not.
Also, you've again proven yourself stupid when it comes to Superman.  He couldn't fly at first either, hell he couldn't fly for awhile (If you follow certain variations of the comic book by different authors.).
If you think Smallville sucks so badly why are you watching it, let alone even commenting on it?"
,baconninja,2011-02-13T16:00Z,"Read the comic its a masterpiece
thanks for the up"
,nkagy,2011-02-13T17:07Z,"@lobsterboy25 - Actually they've hinted numerous times that the actual Lex Luthor is still alive, he just can't be found. Even after the weird deal with him in the back of that semi - all disfigured - they claimed he was the one who started the clones (after that semi incident). They've also had him leave Tess a note before with the initials ""LL"" at the bottom. (not dogging on you - just throwing that out there)

@zakimar1, @lobsterboy25 is 100% right. In the comics (even the original comics) he complains about having super-powers and not being normal, and in almost every version he has to LEARN how to fly. As for Smallville, with Clark ""not getting it up"" with Lana...it's clearly stated that he is scared he'll hurt her if they did anything. In later seasons it's mentioned that Jor-El helps Clark learn how to control himself in their ""training"" which is why he can be with Lois Lane, now.

@carvinmarvin - another spoiler alert if you're in season two....Lex ends up being a bad guy. 

oops."
,fatwalrus,2011-02-13T17:13Z,"Great quaility, one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.

It's like it was written by a 7 year old."
,tox80,2011-02-13T18:40Z,"The quality was great, but this movie was just horrible. "
,perse321,2011-02-13T20:45Z,"smallville is actually in my opinion best thing that has happened to superman story.. Character relations and all that is nice, also Clark was supposed to be conflicted and it is well played in the series.. Learn to use your brains and maybe you haters understand then why he couldnt fly and why he just didnt execute Lex... "
,apirateslifeforme,2011-02-13T20:49Z,"extremezone is unreal!

,Slandry,2011-02-14T04:27Z,"@ zakimar1 first i don't care if u don't like gays. but being a  ex army vet that served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I thing u are a biggest pussy to ever live if u cant even fight for your country then shut the hell up. As far as killing kids in Iraq you might want o check you fucking world there as the people that kill the  kills there are their our people.  
and as far as  the person not seeing the show and is on  season 2 maybe its because like myself I never watched it. but i know that in the comics and even the older movies, and TV Cark never knew how to fly until later. if u know anything about superman it never knew how to fly  in the first place so do some research before u open your cock sucking mouth about something you  know nothing about."
[T],MelloYello,2011-02-14T06:13Z,"Well said lobsterboy25.  

@zakimar1 People like you are such dickheads.

your comment makes no sence and ads nothing but profanity. further more it appears to be nothing but you trying to pull a strawman. FAIL!

hinting at the ""beliveing everything the news says"".
Cus that is what ""sheeple"" and trools like you do, AND NOT people that sees thru the webb of lies spewed in media and so on. Like USA invading another country to steal resources under false pretence.   thx to the uploader and to all the folks that keep sharing after they downloaded."

,bidbow,2011-02-18T12:57Z,I think every has points you know. Zakimar your right about Bush and Oil. Fucking moron has wrecked the stability of this world. Lied and cheated his way into power then uneducated Americans vote this Money hungry oil Tyrant back in. Its obvious he had some to do with the start of this idiot war on terrorism because of his history and friends. Arabs have every right to be Pissed off and they should be proud of the islamic revolution going on at present. It shows what a decent and brave community the Arab world is. Though I have to say Blaming the American people for all this shit is just as Narrow minded and arrogant as Bin Laden and Bush. Lets make no mistake they both are working together and are playing us all like fools. Westeners with no religion are being scared into believing the hype and arabs are having there religion thrown at them to rise up. All to create a capitalist smoke screen Money making bussinesses owned by them. Armed force soldiers are innocent because they are doing nothing other than there duty. Duty that feeds there families and gives carrers. Saying they should all die and come back in wheel chairs is an outrage and anger heavily mis directed. A mistake most extreme muslims are making. Giving a bad name to the decent Muslims who like us are being dragged through the aftermath

,Jeffery02,2011-03-20T06:07Z,"I never thought that a movie can have such an effect on me. I have a girl friend going through brain cancer and this movie really hit me with that. This movie transcends any emotion I previously thought possible from a work of fiction. The story went quick, the quality was good, and where I won't say it is the best movie out there, it definitely has the power to change mine (and others) lives. Btw, the download is a very good quality with minimum (if any) problems, at least when played on VLC"

""How the hell theres a political argument going on in a superman torrent? Its even better that both sides seems to be quite articulate""

PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE JOKING !! Not about the arguments going on, because they're quite amusing, but the people being articulate !?!?!? - ARE YOU MAD, I am almost scared for the future of the English language from reading these comments, I would like to propose that all of you so far who have basically raped my language, please forward your English teachers names from your schools so that we can go forth with having these individuals removed from the education system !! 

Now I understand that many of you may be from other country's, and so for that you may be forgiven, however many of you are not - and you should be ashamed (and placed into a special needs education class) !! !! 

Torrents great, thanks extremezone, and as always thanks to TPB - your work is greatly appreciated. "
