,yankiebar,2011-06-14T00:32Z,any words on the quality? seems too small...
,frogshare,2011-06-16T02:31Z,"@yankiebar
Quality is fine. It was ripped with x264 codec. Not too small then. Besides, why don't you use the link to the screenshot gallery? Copy and paste that link to a new tab/window to make it work. Imageshack block the TBP referrer. That's why you get an error if you simply click it."
