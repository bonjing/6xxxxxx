,fatskater1234,2011-08-15T19:43Z,"Hello greenfrog. I think i have solved the problem my dvd wont recognize it either. Then i figured out it have to do with region. This is a cdfs image and dont a udf. If you store the image as udf. Go to a program called poweriso and open the image file also the dvd in your download, go to file-image properties...  and check the box called UDF if promted about saving click cancel and do that later in save as... or it will restore the original file as udf and then it will be failed when you seed in a bittorrent program."
