,Ltp0wer,2011-06-03T00:28Z,"Richy83, where in the hell do you get your information?

People, there are only 12 episodes. You can confirm this on wikipedia."
,crakgenius,2011-06-21T22:46Z,"Well, Yidio and some similar sites are listing the current season as part of season 1 ... but as you can see on IMDB (at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1785123/episodes ) there are 12 episodes in season 1."
,hoffy97,2011-07-02T13:52Z,"There are 19 episodes, as listed on A&E's site:

http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars/episode-guide/season-1/

Wikipedia is only as up to date as people put in.

Also, it was aired in a different order than listed on the site.  This torrent has them in the order they were aired.

First 4 were aired 1, 3, 2, 4, so if you try to match them with the descriptions, 2 and 3 are flipped.  Also, 5, 6, 7 aired in the order 6, 7, 5, so those need to be rotated too. The rest are ok.

Episodes 13+ had been posted (erroneously) as season 2."
,kevbru2,2011-07-06T04:00Z,"Any chance that we can get all 19 episodes? I have 1-12, 15-17. I need episodes 13, 14, 18, & 19 PLEASE?????"
,mrrmrr,2011-07-14T11:30Z,"@kevbru2
In a derp of epic proportions those been labeled as ""S02"" by various release groups, so just search on TPB for Storage Wars S02* and you will find the episodes you want."
,mrrmrr,2011-09-30T15:26Z,"OK, now that the real S02 came out, the above advice is useless, so I uploaded S01E13-19:
