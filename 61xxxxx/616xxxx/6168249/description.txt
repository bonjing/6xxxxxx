[*]This is my Ghost Recon 2 Advance Warfighter direct play. 
No cdkey or crack needed, just mount or extract and play! 
Note you can burn it but only for back up(won\\\'t play strait off the disc).

[*]This is a cross between a first person shooter and a turn base game.

[*]You controll what your squad does(and yourself)at all times,through many missions.

[*]I wouldn\\\'t try to play multiplayer(but that\\\'s just me).Some clients(steam,gamespy,etc)will ban you, so try at your own risk.

[*]Enjoy and please seed!
