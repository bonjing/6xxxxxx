,chokehold21,2011-03-30T11:49Z,"Do u play on pc to?
or u just ordered that pack only to xbox?"
,RonFly,2011-04-02T05:23Z,Anybody looking to use this pack.. Honestly I used 1st strike and after modding my own gamertag last night I was impressed.. Read briggy's instructions under the black ops first strike map pack.. Its a very well detailed guide of how to install this.. After looking @ it they are both the same way to install... I used modio le fluffie and profile editor ans some other program in the description.. Modio and le fluffie vids on youtube will help too
,CraigGame,2011-04-08T22:10Z,"Absolutely brilliant torrent with easy to follow instructions. if you can sort out a USB device (which was a bitch for me), then your sorted. BONE, your a savior to cheapskates everywhere :D theres just two things that needs to be changed
1:you MUST use a 2GB hard drive since 512mb is already used to make it usable
2:you MUST be connected to Xbox Live. couldn't get it to work otherwise
3: Placing a demo is not optional

apart from that, great instructions"

,Dm99,2011-06-15T00:43Z,@Knightax The New Update Made It So The Taco Profile Doesn't Work Anymore. My Understanding Is That There Is No Way To Play These Maps With Black Ops Again Yet. Bummer...
