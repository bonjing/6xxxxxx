Permanent Vacation pres. Various Artists â€“ Right To Play / Permanent Vacation DJ Mix Permanent Vacation Release Notes :

With the support of the government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Munich-based music label â€œPermanent Vacationâ€ has produced a CD whose proceeds
will go towards supporting children involved in armed conflicts. Specifically, support is provided to the non-governmental organization â€œPlay31â€³, which
organizes soccer matches for former child soldiers. Permanent Vacation put all their efforts in creating an outstanding CD by giving an overview on the labelâ€™s
catalogue from modern disco music and sunny house to Balearic vibes and deeper electronica. //

Mixing label classics with exclusive brand new material of upcoming
releases Tom Bioly and Benjamin FrÃ·hlich have strived to compile pieces of music that strike first time listeners and long time followers of Permanent Vacation
alike. They hope that theyâ€™ve created a unique record that is not only appealing, but also helps contribute to a better future for former child
soldiers. The collaboration with the Principality of Liechtenstein came about during ceremonies celebrating the 20th anniversary of Liechtensteinâ€™s membership
to the United Nations.
