,genenioo,2011-02-13T03:35Z,"Update: Used crack from Boomer for ver. 3.1.1.  Shows 3.1.3 all places except initial screen where it shows 3.1.1 and works as such in Windows 7.

In my first request I didn't mean a different version but a different cracked upload of this version, 3.1.3.  So if anyone knows of such a thing, please advise. "
