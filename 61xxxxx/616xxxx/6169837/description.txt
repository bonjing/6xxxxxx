Plot outline:

This is a very entertaining version of the classic story. Stage fright leads Alice down the rabbit hole, through a looking glass, and into a pool of her own tears in Wonderland. There she meets the oddest creatures imaginable: the frenetic Mad Hatter, the enigmatic Cheshire Cat, the mysterious Caterpillar, the murderous Queen of Hearts, and many others. Everything has a purpose and a lesson to teach Alice; but, although itâ€™s very funny, it's not all fun and games.
