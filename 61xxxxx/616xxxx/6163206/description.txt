Description

Michael Jackson (with or without his brothers) and Gladys Knight and the Pips are well represented here, with seven tracks between them, of which only Ben (Michael Jackson) made the UK top ten although Help me make it through the night (Gladys Knight and the Pips) came close.Actually, there aren't many big UK hits here. Stevie Wonder made the top ten with You are the sunshine of my life, having just missed with Superstition. Diana Ross made the UK top ten with Touch me in the morning. Elsewhere, there are wonderful tracks by the Temptations, Marvin Gaye and Junior Walker, all of which deservedmoreâ€¦ to do better than they actually did (and no doubt that's why they're included).If you are looking for plenty of big hits, you won't find many here. However, if you're looking for great Motown music, there's plenty here
