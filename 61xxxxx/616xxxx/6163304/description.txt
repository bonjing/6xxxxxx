This is another great product from the Charisma Arts guys. Wayne Elise and Spencer Michaels ( of DatingWar.com ) are my two favorite pickup artists. I feel like they are the most real and down to earth of all the PUAs. You get the feeling that they genuinely care (which is rare these days). Anyway, Wayne Elise's ebook is great. He takes a different teaching approach than most. Much of this ebook along with a lot of the Charisma Arts stuff focuses on converstion. If you can't have a conversation with a woman, you're dead in the water before you start. I haven't seen any other program that goes into so much depth on conversation. If that's your sticking point to becoming a master pickup artist then this is the book for you..............
