Whose kitchen will rule?

After the Tasmanian team, the Western Australian team is next to serve dinner. How will it turn out?

The Perth team are the last to cook in this round - who will be up for elimination?

It's state versus state, plate against plate, as 12 teams-of-two from NSW, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and, for the first time, Tasmania attempt to out-dine and out-wine each other to see whose kitchen rules.


Enjoy!
