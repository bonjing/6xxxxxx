,pilot320200,2011-02-11T07:46Z,"Copy from a forum:
1.Disconnect Internet
2.Set computer clock for Jan 10, 2009
3.select both Jeppview and Flitedeck programs
4.use as name : PILOTS
5.use serial : VNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F ( this will give you Full Worldwide access )

now you need the other two CDs.
you MUST get version 01/2009

install CD1 using following 2 serials:

for VFR Europe : 217AN22318
for Full Worldwide : 217AN22319

install CD2 (no serial here...)

6.Do not reboot
7.Run Jeppview or Flitedeck
8.Program prompts for 30-day free use or Activation
9.press NEXT
10.Select ""by phone"" option and press NEXT
11.use the code R00D-KCAB (r-zero-zero-d) not ROOD (r-o-o-d) !!!!

12. set now the current date on computer clock !!!"

But I have a problem with my FliteDeck. Everytime my Jeppview and Flitestar are normaly updated, but Flitedeck not :(. My Flitedeck keeps update form 2008 and I am not able to update it.
I am realy desperated.

I will be glad for every advise.
(but dont tell me to reinstal it. I did it 20times and no result! I think, that the probelm is somewhere in register, but I dont know where :( )"
,hudharam,2011-02-13T13:18Z,"LOEX thats what you have to do;

1. download magic ISO from pirate bay
2. open cd2 of the jepp update with Magic ISO 
3. Rename the file to FSFM_2 from the left menu
4. Save as new ISO file
5. Run the FSFM_2 iso file. 
6. Your FlightDEck Nav database will be updated."
,LOEX,2011-02-13T21:15Z,"I solved my problem, partially.

I uninstaled all jeppesen applications and then instaled Flitedeck and Flitestar only, NO JEPPVIEW.
So instead of jeppview I am using Flitestar now.

I have a problem, that if I instal jeppview and flitedeck together, only jeppview is updated.
I am sure, that I have some problem with in my windows registry. But now, I am quite happy with my solution.

I hope, that this advice will be helpful for one of you.

At the end, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERY UPDATE and keep still updating :)"
