ENJOY the game and Emulator"
,voxomega,2011-05-07T11:03Z,might need some help getting this thing to work. Never DLd an Emulator before so yea.
,ingry,2011-05-17T01:36Z,"I will trust more torrents from this guy. I'd go so far as I would happily hang over a volcano by one of my testicles, in the hand of moodude. The only issue is the emulator, sometimes for boss fights and such the framerates don't work right with fast-forward or the emulator. Simply download PSXeven, and play through that fight, you can google how to set it up, simply set frame rate limit equal to 70 and you are golden. Same frame rate issue when coming out of Dragoon mode as well. +1"
,ingry,2011-05-17T01:37Z,Also - any way you could include that in the read me file? I suppose if someone loves the game as much as I do they'd go through the trouble of reading a few lines to make sure the emulator works :)
,Akis11,2011-07-07T15:42Z,will i be able to save my progress in this game?
,Akis11,2011-07-07T15:43Z,will i be able to save the progress of my game when i play it?
,moodude,2011-10-15T00:57Z,"@Akis11 

Yes you will.



Do you guys need a read me file with explanation? 

Also, thanks for the love guys. Any other games you guys want/need?"
