,Sick3r,2011-02-11T14:41Z,"Thx for the up =)))

The sound becomes off and back and off again but VLC fixes it manually. Although I'd rather see it without that problem. But thanks and great job nonetheless!"
,Mimsy,2011-02-15T23:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, it's hard to find a decent American Chopper upload, even though it's a fairly popular show."
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-02-17T23:19Z,"Thats the problem mimsy-it isnt-the show has lost ratings & the ONLY business the shops are  doin is ""tv b ikes""-add to that the highly suspect ep -fired- which a very hadny your fired cam was neatly placed at the exact spot to catch this!-they dont use hidden cams-all 7 seasons-not 1 hidden camera.You can also see clearly junior is bein prompted-its a script.For me the thing was real till the ratings slipped & this whole junior v senir thing started,over nothing.Paul had/has no legal rights & these court things-how do we know? anyone seen the court papers? anyone been in court? They built bikes fer 35 k upwards.now they are relyin on sellin the show abroad-as the franchises arent takin off.people in the uk wont pay 17 grand fer a 5 grand chop!  still was a fantastic show for 5 & a bit  seasons"

,nox55,2011-02-22T00:28Z,"Look at the dates of those links you are posting.

The show was canceled last year on TLC. Now it is on Discovery and it is not canceled."
,kiwikoji,2011-02-25T21:30Z,"OCC may be out of the picture soon, but from what PJD says they'll still be going ahead with building/filming.

paul sr realy showed his true colors the last 2 seasons hopfully the hard working staff over at occ wont lose out becuase of that old mad dog's bullshit."
,dzlrules,2011-03-04T11:17Z,"Discovery's website for AC states ""RETURNS THIS SPRING!""

We'll see! Whether or not Sr. is still willing to self-destruct on national TV remains to be seen. Frankly, I could care less if he's on the show."
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-03-08T09:02Z,"AC series finally [finale]! Its been almost a decade of great experiences. For me, I am certainly not done with television. The best is yet to come

Quote paul junior-the last eps of series 7 were canned & wont be shown-discovery in contract negs with PJ about a spin off new series (feb 2011) After viewer backlash at the obvious scripted scened with that oik odie....The show lost all credibility.Last show (the ones actualy shown on tv) was screen thursday 12 feb 2011 & there are no more episodes save from a special/montage/clips/old stuff/cuttin room floor etc.....Thats all folks "
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-03-08T09:10Z,"& for those who still refuse 2 believe-why not ask the man himself

@wherespauljunior   on twitter-he seems more interested in his bed than makin a non existant tv show!"
