Or, at least a dutch one with english subtitles?
Or, do you think that non - dutch peoples can not stand the history of the 3rd Reich?"

Same as Hitlers Helpers and Hitlers Beulen together,  english spoken only with scandinavian subs . Its ok, but only the interviews are in german language . If you understand german too its better. At least its something . I will upload it after i finish with next series Hitlers Krijgers if you like."
