,viking_uk,2011-02-19T10:44Z,"Thanks heaps for all of your work ... I normally come to you first when I hear theres some paranormal episodes out!!!

Just to let you know that you have labelled this episode wrong, its actually number 20 - its the Valentine Days special and has been released by W4F.Don't ask me why the episodes are out of synch.

Anyway as I understand episode 18 was shown last night (Salem Witch House) and next week will be last one (Jerome Grand Hotel).

However thanks heaps again, your effort is truly appreciated - especially for those like me living outside of the US!!!"
,pisswhistle,2011-02-19T12:51Z,"congrats on well deserved pink skull, tNe!"

I know, I screwed it all up by naming this E18 when it's really SP3 (third special of the season).  Some people are even saying this is E20.  It all depends on which site you look at for episode guide.  

Finding the Salem, Mass Witch episode is going to be hectic because of my mislabel, and I apologize.  

Speaking of the Salem Witch ep, I did not get a chance to cap it last night.  Lovin a lady is way more important than ripping TV, right? Right.  I'll have to wait for an On Demand replay to cap.  I can't get true HD, though.  I don't have a good enough TV Tuner in the PC.  I can get local channels in HD, but not cable.  Pretty crappy, huh?  

Sorry again to everybody for the delay of the next episode release.  It will be available in due time from either me in SDTV or another source that actually has a real HDTV cap."
