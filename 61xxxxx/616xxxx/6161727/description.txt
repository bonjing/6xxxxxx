BBC Natural World 2011 Chimps of the Lost Gorge HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

A real-life drama about a family chimps, who are trapped in the lost world of the Kyambura. This deep and ancient forested gorge runs through the African savannah and for 15 years, it has been cut off from the rest of the jungle, leaving the chimps imprisoned. Here, they face a daily life-or-death dilemma; whether to leave the safety of the gorge and venture into the predator-ridden savannah to find food, or face hunger. With only twenty of them left and the alpha male losing his grip on the family, can they hold it together or is time running out?
