As requested, a bit late on this one. Includes the best artwork, covers, inserts, etc. that I could find. There seems to be 2 variations of the Cover itself, one green one yellow, but I believe all tracks are of the same catalog # : MM 80007-2. My guess is one is the re-release.

Also, the tracklist is as it appears on the album, the 2 additional tracks not on the list are marked as Bonus and track 8 has been corrected(artist & title reversed).

As for track 6, we chose to leave the artist as the album credits(Red 1) as oposed to Dave Clarke.
