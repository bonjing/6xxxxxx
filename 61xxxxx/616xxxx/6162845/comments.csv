,Emieliboy,2011-04-04T20:57Z,Thanks man! Just burned it on Blu-ray and it looks brilliant and works perfect!
,xjodal22,2011-04-27T23:31Z,"I've got the Blueray/DVD myself, bought it from Q-dance.nl, however I don't own a blueray player, so I used my sister's computer to create an .mdx image, which I moved to my PC using an external harddrive. I then mounted the image, found the exact same files that this torrent conains, but I was unable to play them on my PC, apparently they were some special .m2ts files that no media players supports. Correct me if im wrong, but is this torrent useless unless u can burn the files to a BR disc and then watch it?"
