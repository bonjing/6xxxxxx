,loki_68,2011-02-13T17:54Z,I just see one file the Pro.exe??? Is there no serial or patch??
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-02-14T10:32Z,"yeaa, 
no serial or patch, cause you won't need it. 

install 
update 
scan 
download detected drivers
install drivers...

if for any reason the update option ceases to work, skip it, but for the time being it works the update too"
