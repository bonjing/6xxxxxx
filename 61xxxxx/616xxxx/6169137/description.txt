Leon Rosselson is not exactly well known outside folk circles. Come to think of it, he's not that well known within folk circles. That's a real shame. Because he is arguably the best song writer Britain has produced since the war. Yes, seriously. He has a facility with words, an understanding of their possibilities, which can only be described as poetic. And he combines this with a penetrating eye and a sharp tongue, making his songs memorable, effective and thought-provoking. Even after 20 years, I can listen to `News from Nowhere', `The World Turned Upside Down' of `Palaces of Gold' over and over again with a tear of disappointed, old-labour sentiment dewing the corner of my eye, while others like `We Sell Everything' and `Sing a Song to Please Us' remain fresh and funny.
