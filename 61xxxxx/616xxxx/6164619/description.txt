Papercuts prinicipal Jason Robert Quevers beautiful songwriting is thoughtful, evocative, subtle, and simultaneously ambitious. And the new Papercuts album, Fading Parade, is dream pop of the highest order. Crafted over the course of several months at The Hangar in Sacramento, with Thom Monahan, and at Quevers own Pan American Recording studio, Fading Parade is meticulously designed pop music, with a fully developed sense of space and a sturdy wall of sound. With the aid of strings, autoharp, Mellotron, Moogs, 12-string acoustic guitars, piano, echoplexes, analog and digital recording methods, this new album is wide-ranging and adventurous.
