Bee Gees appeared on the Chicago based series Soundstage, performing a large selection of their repertory from the late 1960's thru the mid 1970's, up through
""Jive Talkin'"". The result is sort of the video equivalent of Here At Last, their mid 1970's live double album. It's essential viewing for serious fans of the group,
capturing them in superb voice throughout. Yvonne Elliman is the featured guest. Visual quality is about 8/10.
