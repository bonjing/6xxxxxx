Kristi said it was love at first sight when she met Michael. They married, had three kids, but when the union went awry nine years later, they divorced, and are now in an all-out war affecting the most vulnerable members of the family â€” the children. From accusations of child and animal abuse, alcoholism and threats, to withholding gifts and even a night spent in jail, the couple says they are unwavering in their position. Discover why Dr. Phil believes the parents are playing a dangerous game that puts them at risk for losing the children all together.
