At the early age of twelve the author was thoroughly indoctrinated into the Bolshevik
ideology by two revolutionary missionaries who travelled on the same ship with him out to the
Orient in 1907. Unlike many others he didnâ€™t swallow the bait they offered him â€˜Hook, Line,
and Sinkerâ€™. He decided to keep an open mind, and to investigate matters thoroughly, before
reaching any conclusions. His investigations and studies of all angles of the International
Conspiracy have taken him to nearly every country in the world.
