Source for the tree: \\\"A Fish out of Water\\\" RoIO CD & \\\"Outtakes from Outer Space\\\" RoIO CD
These two (unreleased) songs appear on a two-sided 7\\\" acetate discovered early 1988. 
Whilst some experts consider this as a fake, Miles reproduces in his book a setlist 
including \\\"Lucy Leave\\\" for the gig the band played on October 14, 1966.

Recorded: London, Mike Leonard\\\'s house, January 1967

7 - Candy And A Currant Bun (Barrett) (Acetate) - 01:59
Recorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, January 23-25, 1967
Primary source: EMIdisc acetate
Source for the tree: \\\"Anthology II\\\" RoIO CD
Alternate lyrics (\\\"please just walk with me\\\" while on the regular single version it\\\'s \\\"please 
just f*** with me\\\"), different verse structure, no organ and guitar solos.
Some people refer to this version as being \\\"Let\\\'s Roll Another One\\\" from October 1966 sessions at 
Thompson Recording Studios, but since the instrumental tracks are the same as the regular single 
version, this probably comes from the same January 1967 sessions at Sound Techniques Studios.

Primary source: \\\"Arnold Layne\\\" single (1st single), released March 11, 1967
Source for the tree: \\\"The Pink Floyd Early Singles\\\" CD
On the \\\"Masters of Rock\\\" compilation released 1973, there was a mistake in the title: 
\\\"Candy and a Current Bun\\\".

9 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (Demo Version) - 06:57
Recorded: ?
Primary source: ?
Source for the tree: unknown gen copy
This obscure demo is probably a fake. However, it has acquired a certain fame in the 
trading circle of Pink Floyd fans. We included it here, in order to let you make your own 
opinion. Some say it was recorded on a cheap cassette recorder, by two guys playing 
guitar simultaneously, sometime during the 80s. Note that the first riff after the intro is 
identical to the bass riff that can be heard on the \\\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\" version, 
and that earlier versions of the song (on \\\"San Francisco\\\" soundtrack or \\\"Tonite Let\\\'s All 
Make Love in London\\\" soundtrack) don\\\'t contain this particular riff. This leads to the 
conclusion that this \\\"demo\\\" was probably recorded after the release of \\\"The Piper At The 
Gates Of Dawn\\\" album.

10 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (CBC Version) - 10:43
Recorded: London, early January 1967

Source for the tree: \\\"Stone Rust\\\" RoIO CD & \\\"Dark Globe\\\" RoIO CD

This obscure studio version of \\\"Interstellar Overdrive\\\" was used during an interview 
broadcast in early 1967 by CBC Canadian Radio.

11 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (Abbey Road Outtake) - 00:40
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, March 14-15, 1967

12 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (Mono, Single Version) - 05:13
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, March 14-15, 1967
Primary source: \\\"Arnold Layne\\\" French EP, released 1967
Source for the tree: \\\"Anthology II\\\" RoIO CD
This version is unique, because it only contains the basic track, without overdubs. It 
fades out before the actual end of the song.

13 - Scarecrow (Barrett) (Abbey Road Outtake) - 01:05
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, March 19-20, 1967
Primary source: Capital Radio broadcast (\\\"Pink Floyd Story\\\"), December 1976 - January 1977
Source for the tree: unknown gen from Capital Radio broadcast
Outtake from \\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\" sessions. All the instruments are heavily 
undermixed. This is nearly an unplugged version ?.

Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, March 19-20, 1967
Primary source: \\\"See Emily Play\\\" single (2nd single), released June 16, 1967

Outtake from \\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\" sessions. It includes an interview with 
Floyd\\\'s manager Peter Jenner.

16 - See Emily Play (Barrett) (Actetate) - 02:49
Recorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, May 18 & 21, 1967
Primary source: EMIdisc acetate
Source for the tree: \\\"Dawn Of The Piper\\\" RoIO CD
This version is very close to the regular one, there are only slight changes in the mix 
(vocals are undermixed, organ is more in the front...) and the very end is uncut.

17 - See Emily Play (Barrett) (Mono, Single Version) - 02:52
Recorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, May 18 & 21, 1967
Primary source: \\\"See Emily Play\\\" single (2nd single), released June 16, 1967

19 - Flaming (Barrett) (Mono) - 02:43
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, June 7 & 27, 1967
Primary source: \\\"Flaming\\\" US single (3rd US single), released November 2, 1967.
Source for the tree: \\\"A CD Full of Secrets\\\" CD
\\\"Flaming\\\" was not on the first US release of \\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\" album, and 
was then released as a single. This version is different from the regular (stereo) mix: 
background noises are mixed much louder.
In fact, this version is identical to the version on the mono edition of \\\"The Piper at the Gates of 
Dawn\\\" album. Curiously, on the 30th Anniversary Mono Edition CD released in 1997, one chord of 
the final chords sequence was edited out.

20 - Matilda Mother (Barrett, Belloc) (Alternative Version) - 03:58
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, 1967
Primary source: ?
Source for the tree: \\\"An Introduction To Syd Barrett\\\" compilation
The original version of the song that was to be released on \\\"The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\\". Parts
of the lyrics are taken from the Hilaire Belloc stories, \\\"Cautionary Tales\\\". But before releasing
the song, the Belloc estate denied use of the lyrics. It was later released on the Barrett
compilation, \\\"An Introduction To Syd Barrett\\\".

21 - Untitled (uncredited) - 01:31
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, 1967
Primary source: ?
Source for the tree: \\\"Dawn Of The Piper\\\" RoIO CD
This untitled outtake was probably recorded around the same time \\\"Jugband Blues\\\" and 
\\\"Vegetable Man\\\" were recorded. 
On a lot of circulating copies, the title of this outtake is \\\"Sunshine\\\", but it\\\'s wrong (\\\"Sunshine\\\" was 
a working title for something that was later included in \\\"Matilda Mother\\\", and no outtake ever 
surfaced for this track). On some other copies, the title of this outtake is \\\"Experiment\\\".

22 - Silas Lang (Barrett) - 02:39
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, 1967 or 1968
Primary source: ?
Source for the tree: \\\"Vegetable Man, Where Are You\\\" RoIO LP
There\\\'s a strong debate about the exact origin of this obscure outtake. Some think it was
recorded by the Floyd during the \\\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\" sessions, in June 1967. 
Other think it comes from a solo Barrett session in May 1968. This outtake contains the 
early chords of Syd Barrett\\\'s song \\\"Swan Lee (Silas Lang)\\\". Note that the piano and jazz 
tunes may be due to a technical error while dubbing the original multitrack master tape 
onto cassette.

version.

13 - It Would Be So Nice (Wright) (Mono) - 03:43
Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, February 12-13 & March 5-12-21, 1968
Primary source: \\\"It Would Be So Nice\\\" single (4th single), released April 12, 1968
Source for the tree: \\\"The Pink Floyd Early Singles\\\" CD
Due to the \\\"Evening Standard\\\" mention in the original lyrics, the Floyd was forced to

This obscure demo is probably a fake. However, it has acquired a certain fame in the 
trading circle of Pink Floyd fans. We included it here, in order to let you make your own 
opinion. It has surfaced on the same tape that contains the (fake) demo of \\\"Interstellar 
Overdrive\\\" (one can hear the beginning of \\\"Interstellar Overdrive\\\" right after the end of 
\\\"Julia Dream\\\"). So, this was probably recorded by the same guys.

Recorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, April - June 1969
Primary source: \\\"Picnic - A Breath of Fresh Air\\\" Harvest sampler, released June 1970
Source for the tree: \\\"Works\\\" CD
This version is often considered as a demo. In fact, it was recorded during the 
\\\"Ummagumma\\\" studio sessions at Abbey Road, but it was not included on the album, 
because the band later decided to organise the studio disc in four parts (one part for 
each member). This song first appeared in June 1970 on \\\"Picnic - A Breath of Fresh Air\\\" 
Harvest sampler, without the band\\\'s agreement. In 1983, this version was included on 
\\\"Works\\\" Canadian compilation, this time with the band\\\'s agreement.

During Roger Waters\\\' speech at 04:32, this sentence can be heard on the right channel 
(you have to play the song at half speed to hear it properly).

5 - \\\"and the wind cried ... \\\" - 00:06
There was a strong debate about what Roger says at the very end of the track: \\\"And the 
wind cried Mary ? Marion ? Back ? \\\". Make your own opinion before Dave thanks you ;-)
Note : it is also said that at some point Roger says \\\"Bring Back My Guitar\\\", but we haven\\\'t been

Source for the tree: \\\"Pink Floyd In Concerto\\\" Italian single
These 4 tracks come from an Italian single entitled \\\"Pink Floyd In Concerto\\\" that was 
released as a bonus with the \\\"Gong\\\" magazine, sometimes in the 70\\\'s. This one plays 
extracts from a bootleg LP (\\\"Hamburger\\\"). When the powers that be found it was 
bootlegged music, they tried to stop the magazine selling, but some copies went through. 
The single was later re-released as a bonus with another bootleg LP (\\\"A Special Treat\\\").
Here\\\'s what the front cover of the single says: \\\"Supplemento al No 1 anno 4o di \\\'GONG\\\' 
mensile di musica e cultura progressiva. \\\'PINK FLOYD IN CONCERTO\\\' 16 minuti di musica 
live da monaco di baviera\\\".

Nick Mason\\\'s words \\\"One of these days I\\\'m going to cut you into little pieces\\\" are 
repeated all through the song. The voice in the background all along the track is the one 
of Jimmy Young, an English DJ who was disliked by the band and is the inspiration for 
the song. This Jimmy Young speech was also used during live performances in late 1974, 
when the band played a tape of this speech (in loop mode, with increasing tempo) before 
the song \\\"Raving and Drooling\\\" (early version of \\\"Sheep\\\").

Primary source: \\\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason Official Tour CD\\\" US promo, released 1988

is skipped). The rototom intro is edited (4 themes instead of 8) and doesn\\\'t have the 
background keyboards. The central part with bass solo is edited (2 themes instead of 4). 
The last chorus is repeated and the fade out happens during the second one (on the 
album version, after the last chorus, there\\\'s a reprise of the bass solo and then the song

Recorded: 1994
Primary source: \\\"The Division Bell\\\" LP, released March 30, 1994
Source for the tree: \\\"The Division Bell\\\" LP
This LP version is different from the CD version, with a slight change in the lyrics: the 
first lines of the second verse (\\\"I murmured a vow ... when I think aloud\\\") were added to 
the first verse, and the rest of the second verse (\\\"Extinguished by the light ... with an 
empty smile\\\") was left out, so that the LP version has a longer first verse, and no second 
verse between \\\"This bleeding heart\\\'s not beating much\\\" and \\\"I\\\'m creeping back to life...\\\".

At the very end of \\\"The Division Bell\\\" album, there\\\'s a phone conversation between Steve 
O\\\'Rourke (Floyd\\\'s manager) and Charlie (Polly Samson\\\'s son; Polly married David Gilmour 
in 1994). This conversation was probably incidentally recorded by the answering machine 
at Gilmour\\\'s house.

This is an \\\"answers only\\\" interview, where David Gilmour is supposed to answer 8 
different questions. The questions are available on a separate sheet provided with the 
promo CD:

1. Where was your new album, The Division Bell, recorded ?
2. How was the recording of this album different from the previous Pink Floyd 
album ?
3. How did you arrive at the title The Division Bell ?
4. Do you enjoy putting on such enormous concert events ?
5. Let\\\'s talk about the songs on the album. On \\\"What Do You Want From Me\\\" 
the music was written by you and Richard and the lyrics were written by you 
and Polly Samson. Could you tell us how this wame about ?
6. There\\\'s an incredible instrumental on the album. Could you explain how you 
came up with the music and the title to \\\"Marooned\\\" ?
7. How did you come up with \\\"Wearing The Inside Out\\\". I see that Dick Parry 
plays saxophone on this song ?
8. \\\"Keep Talking\\\" is an amazing song. It\\\'s being played on the radio almost 
constantly. Are you happy with the response that song is getting ?

This track consists of various ambient noises and is probably an extract of the (longer) 
tape that was played before the Floyd shows during the Division Bell Tour. Somewhere in 
the middle, an extract from \\\"Cluster One\\\" can be heard. It is not available on 
\\\"P*U*L*S*E\\\" CD and LP releases.

This is an edit of the \\\"P*U*L*S*E\\\" version: it fades in at the beginning of the acoustic 
guitar solo (at 01:42 on \\\"P*U*L*S*E\\\" CD), and there\\\'s a short edit during the last 
guitar/voice duo, after the last verse (the segment 04:29-04:43 on the \\\"P*U*L*S*E\\\" CD 
version was cut).

This is an edit of the \\\"P*U*L*S*E\\\" version: the instrumental guitar intro is missing (the 
song begins with the first lines \\\"Where were you ...\\\"), and it ends just after the last verse 
(skipping the final guitar solo).

The first track of the film was in fact recorded backwards. We inverted this track, so that

\\\"More\\\" recording sessions: first, some unreleased instrumental music, then \\\"Cirrus Minor\\\"

Pink Floyd made at least 6 attempts to compose music that could fit in the desert sex 
sequence of the film. Finally, none of the Floyd\\\'s versions was chosen (the music 
accompanying the love scene in the film was composed and played by Grateful Dead\\\'s 
guitarist Jerry Garcia). Version 4 is a quiet instrumental piano piece, played by Rick 
Wright.

\\\"Oenone\\\", from Greek mythology, is the name of a nymph deserted by her husband, 
Paris, for Helen of troy. Some prefer to spell this outtake \\\"Oneone\\\", because it would be 
pronounced \\\"oh-nee-oh-nee\\\", the same way as the end of Zabriskie Point\\\'s director

Primary source: \\\"Magritte\\\" documentary film, 1978
Source for the tree: \\\"Magritte\\\" video
From a biography of Belgian surrealist painter RenÃ© Magritte. Although this documentary 
was first released in 1978, it is possible that the music has been recorded several years 
before. For instance, during Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4, the strange keyboards sounds are 
very similar to those one can hear during \\\"On The Run\\\" sequence of \\\"Live At Pompeii\\\", 
where Roger Waters is trying to get different sounds from the synthesizer (this could 
make sense, since both \\\"Magritte\\\" and \\\"Live At Pompeii\\\" were directed by Adrian Maben). 
Some attribute these low-pitched pulses to Adrian Maben himself, although he\\\'s not 
credited as music composer for this documentary. The song that can be heard during 
Part 5 and Part 6 seems to be an unreleased song performed by Pink Floyd. Part 8 
contains an extract from \\\"Obscured By Clouds\\\".
Note that we didn\\\'t include the whole documentary soundtrack here, we just took the 
snippets containing music by Roger Waters (most probably). So, parts of the 
documentary are missing, but the music is uncut.

This song was taken from the BBC TV broadcast of the film (it\\\'s not on the LaserDisc or 
video release, although it\\\'s listed at the end of the tracklist). 
Since the music was slightly re-organised on the broadcast version of the film, the talking that 
can be heard during \\\"Carrera Slow Blues\\\" is in fact a part of the talking that\\\'s placed somewhere 
during \\\"Big Theme\\\" on the LaserDisc version.

The song \\\"Pan Am Shuffle\\\" appears at different places during the film: first at the 
beginning of the film, then during the ending credits. Besides that, the length of the 
credits varies on the different versions of the film (LaserDisc, video or TV broadcast): 
since the song fades out on both LaserDisc and video releases, only the broadcast 
version of the film contains the very end of the song. 
So we combined several parts of the LaserDisc and the TV broadcast, to have the full length version.

This film is a documentary about fractals and The Mandelbrot set. 
For this soundtrack, David Gilmour re-used some pieces from his previous soundtracks. 
Part 2 and Part 20 contain the same piece of music as Part 9 and Part 10 of \\\"Ruby Takes A Trip\\\" 
(slide guitar theme, a la \\\"One Of These Days\\\"). 
Part 6 is basically the same as Part 2 and Part 3 of \\\"Ruby Takes A Trip\\\" (slow theme). 
Part 9 and Part 10 contain the same piece of music as Part 3 of \\\"The Art Of Tripping\\\" 
(keyboards with high pitched guitar on the top, a la \\\"Marooned\\\"). 
Part 15 is the same as Part 11 of \\\"Ruby Takes A Trip\\\" (\\\"On The Run\\\" revisited). 
Note that the theme that can be heard during Part 12 is very similar to the central part of \\\"High Hopes\\\".
Note that we didn\\\'t include the whole documentary soundtrack here, we just took the 
snippets containing music by David Gilmour. 
So, parts of the documentary are missing, but the music is uncut.

\\\"when I hear those seabirds cry\\\", while on the Italian soundtrack version, it\\\'s \\\"when she hears

BBC interview of Gilmour over his \\\"On An Island\\\" album. The questions are not kept in the recording, but were put in text

1. Do you see this album as more of a personal statement?
2. Is it fundamentally different making music under your own name rather than under Pink Floyd?
3. The new songs deal with mortality and acceptance. How have those been big issues for you?
4. Can you tell us the story behind your guitar strap?
5. The Pink Floyd reunion at Live 8 spawned all sorts of rumors. Was it a farewell performance?
6. Do you feel being a solo artist has made you more upfront about who you are as a musician?

This version starts off with a short clip of the beginning of the song, played only by
Barrett on an acoustic guitar without dubs. The middle section is also unmixed, (Isn\\\'t it
good to be lost in the wood / Isn\\\'t it bad so quiet there, in the wood), sounding more
gruff than the original version.

THis is actually a different take of the song, \\\"Dark Globe\\\", but unlike the album version,
it is played in time, without Barrett skipping beats or playing out of timing.

5 - Syd Barrett - Syd Barrett Interview (uncredited) - 14:58
Recorded: August 1967
Primary source: Re-broadcast in 2007
Source for the tree: online video
An interview of Barrett from the ZBS Foundation over general information that resurfaced in 2007
on air. The interview stops almost abruptly, as the interviewer sees that the interview isn\\\'t
really going anywhere, and that Syd wasn\\\'t exactly \\\'down-to-earth\\\'. The interview was taken before
Barrett\\\'s expulsion from the band, and really shows his mental breakdown so far.
