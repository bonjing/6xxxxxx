"Lucky Stiff"

The brutal murder of a lottery winner has 
Castle and Beckett up to their eyeballs in 
suspects, envious and angered by the 
victim's sudden move from the poorhouse to 
the penthouse. As the precinct buzzes with 
fantasies of what our cops would do if 
they won the lottery, Martha struggles with 
the reality of such a decision when she 
suddenly inherits money she feels she 
doesn't deserve.

Enjoy :)
