Synopsis
Jean Gabin is at his most wearily romantic as aging gangster Max le Menteur in the Jacques Becker gem Touchez pas au grisbi (Hands Off the Loot!). Having pulled off the heist of a lifetime, Max looks forward to spending his remaining days relaxing with his beautiful young girlfriend. But when Riton (RenÃ© Dary), Maxâ€™s hapless partner and best friend, lets word of the loot slip to loose-lipped, two-timing Josy (Jeanne Moreau), Max is reluctantly drawn back into the underworld. A touchstone of the gangster-film genre, Touchez pas au grisbi is also pure Beckerâ€”understated, elegant, evocative.

Essay
Jacques Becker may well be the most seriously underestimated director in the history of French cinema. Even in his own lifetime, he suffered disparaging comments. Wrote Jacques Demeure about Touchez pas au grisbi in a 1957 Positif article: â€œHere we can measure the abyss that separates Becker from his master Renoirâ€¦. From Renoir, Becker has only derived certain narrative devices, such as a way of using doorsâ€¦. DÃ©cor soon becomes the essential factor, and the film becomes simply decorative.â€ True, things have improved since then. In 1998, a criticsâ€™ poll in the very same journal chose Grisbi as the finest French crime movie ever made. But despite the tributes of such figures as FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Jacques Rivette, and Renoir himself at the time of Beckerâ€™s death in 1960, it was more than thirty years before anyone thought to mount a complete retrospectiveâ€”and even then it wasnâ€™t in France, but at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland.
