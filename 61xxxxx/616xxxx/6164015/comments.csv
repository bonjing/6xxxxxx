,chalky_no1,2011-02-16T06:13Z,"i always use fxg torrents for there size and quality....my only fault is the resolution on there torrents like 640 width is fine, but 272 height is to small i understand you would lose abit of quality if it was bigger but i feel it is worth sacrificing abit, but thanks for all your effort , im very greatfull."
