When June gets a visit from an old partner of Byron's named Ford, Neal's con radar goes off. Ford claims he's back in town for a fresh start but Neal isn't so sure, especially when the team learns that Ford has been meeting with a dangerous ex-cell mate named Jonas Ganz. And when Neal finds a printing plate for an old hundred-dollar bill hidden in June's house, he realizes Ford and Ganz's plan: to print brand new, legal tender.
