[V],twentyforty,2011-02-08T18:15Z,@hkoraddi: I avoid PPV at all costs. So is with this one. Better is to wait nice DVDrip and make 272p out of it.
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-08T18:19Z,"@spiritualiste: LOL, when I have seen this BluRay last week, I was unable to resist. It wasn't request, it's my choice.

Having two nice reasons for that."

thnks"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-08T18:34Z,"@banukaknight: Don't worry. I would reupload it.

1. Stop old torrent.

2. Load new one.

3. Start new one, choosing the same location as for the first one. Download would resume and nothing would be lost.

Next time fucking read;

""NOTE: TimeToLive 48h (torrent's TTL)""

I CANNOT SEED WEEKLY PACK FROM WEEK BEFORE - ON WEDNESDAY. It doesn't make sense.

USE Daily torrents, and because you have slow connection - some thinking must be involved."

sorry, slip of the tongue

,froglog,2011-02-08T21:28Z,Thank you for this one
,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-09T06:50Z,"I saw this in a THEATER when it first came out (was attracted to it because it was billed as a Sci-Fi, post-apocolyptic flick--didn't have a clue at the time who Pamela Anderson was).  Didn't last more than 8 or 10 days.  As I recall the plot had some similarities to the fictional backdrop of the Dark Angel series.  To my mind, the only thing that ""rocked"" was Pamela's rack.  The plot and her acting were, shall we say, forgettable.  Prefer my manes brunette, smaller bumpy bits, and some acting ability--such as what you get with Keira Knightley or Rachel Weisz.  Giving it a shot anyhow.  Thanks for your nightly encodes, 20-40.  (Finally finished the JDownload, btw, and again, thanks.)"
