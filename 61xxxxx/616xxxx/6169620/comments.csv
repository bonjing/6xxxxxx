I don't mind uploading at 150kbps, but I don't appreciate doing so when I'm only getting a 3-6 kbps download in return, but on another note, thankyou to those who have been seeding on and off, where I have seen those download rates fluctuate to 300-400 kbps, and thanks to the uploader for upping this torrent"
