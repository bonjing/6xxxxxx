"Pilot"

On what would have been just a typical day at 
work -- trying to get rid of a hockey rink that 
won't melt so the circus can go on that night, 
looking for an elephant lost in the building 
and arranging an impromptu press conference to 
repair one of his boss's PR nightmares -- Alice 
ends her casual relationship with Ben to commit 
to another man. This happens on Ben's 40th 
birthday, just as he's realizing he doesn't 
want to be alone.

Enjoy :)
