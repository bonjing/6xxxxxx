,SpartanHead,2011-02-12T10:16Z,"RAR.file, wouldn't open for me either. FML"
,Gosick,2011-02-12T10:58Z,"I unrared it with no issue. Just right click on the first file,tell it where to extract to and it works just fine. Quality is good on the file..scanned with avira and malwarebytes and didn't see any problems. Just do the file itself next time uploader instead of the rars...makes people skeptical."
,pawcio88,2011-02-12T11:46Z,anyone got subtitles for it?
,scorp123,2011-02-12T12:06Z,"You noobs! LOL. RAR file are the ""modus operandi"" for scene releases because a lot of those releases get first distributed via IRC, UseNet or one-click hosters. And there are always limits how much data you can put into one single transfer. So that's why they split things up. If something goes wrong you only transfer the 20 or so megs that got lost and don't have to transfer the whole thing again. Last but not least: Look at uploader's nick --- see that shiny green pirate skull he has next to his nick? That means he's a TPB member and trustworthy ;)"

Thanks for the upload, I love this show!!"
,teespoon,2011-02-12T19:54Z,i love the fact that big files come in many smaler rar. files. makes the downloading faster and more efficent. and if sumthing fucks up u download only a smal file insted of the whole big one. and seriously guys. sceptical about rar files. that at least gives u the chance to scan it for maleware and shit before u do anything with it......
