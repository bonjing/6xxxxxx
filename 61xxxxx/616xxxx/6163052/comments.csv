only 2 things: try adding tracknumbers to the filenames and why did you add 1GB SACD.isz? 
IMO unnecessary addition to torrentsize."
,tverlaine,2011-02-10T16:24Z,"Thank you for this beautiful package,agree with previous comment about the isz.just as a suggestion,certainly not as criticism-tom"
,Dominus.Oriens,2011-02-10T19:10Z,SACD.isz - full SACD layer (in compressed iso format) for power users. ;)  
,tverlaine,2011-02-11T02:05Z,Didn't know about that-will look into it-Thanks again
,]eep,2011-02-11T02:28Z,"ok, guess i'm not a poweruser, since i have no idea what to do with a sacd layer or how to burn it. Even if, it wouldn't fit in my cd-player. 

And why use WMA. Argh! I hate those ms-codecs. But I'm not complaining, I'm still really happy with this (and i can allways recode lossless). If you have any more of this quality... :)"
,Dominus.Oriens,2011-02-11T17:36Z,"Yes, I have. ;) To be continued... "
