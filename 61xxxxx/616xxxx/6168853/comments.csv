I never said torrents are if you were directing your comments to myself, you should learn to read what is written and not include your own words into your head when you do read them.

In general warez has reduced the quality of the PC market, that is not a random guess that is fact, and it continues to do so. You have millions of teens and some adults who think its their right to use their broadband conns to grab from whatever source everything they want for free, and then use the oldest excuses in the books to try legitimize their thefts (no need for people to go into its copyright infringement and not theft - they are both the same), and its also mostly those people who wont even seed things and are first to cry ""OMG PLZ SEED"" and continue to download whatever data but probably set their upload speeds to 5KB/s and when they get to 100%, pop they remove from their torrent client.

There is your current generation of warez users, not like the old days when everything was shared now its all about money, hence why the old warez group members have left scene all together because the scene stinks. Again its all because of the greedy kids."

Errr perhaps for last gen consoles, so therefore you have no idea what you are talking about yourself.

360's require you to flash the drive.
PS3's require you to, ""at the moment"", to use a ROM bypass on a USB stick and also requires 3rd party software that has broken the system key to do so.
Wii's... There is no official mod-chip only 3rd party chips that are not so good, there is other ways of running 3rd party programs that can help boot backups.

So as you see your kinda 1 out of 3 for the main consoles, and that 1 is very shallow as those mod-chips are not so great.

Perhaps take your own advice? And actually read stuff. Yes?"
,Traziz,2011-02-15T10:50Z,"@pwnpwnpoop

Forgot to mention your understanding that PC game quality has not reduced. Consider most games are released on console first, and that most are then console ports to the PC. And also consider the release rate of quality titles, this year there is perhaps 7 major titles for 2011 so far. Compare that to years ago when it could be easily triple that.

And there is plenty of quality titles being released solely for the consoles that will never see the PC market ever.

So again you have no clue what you are talking about.

,OmniNegro,2011-02-16T04:06Z,"PCs are the future. Consoles are just for kiddies who have no idea how to do anything that requires basic computer skills.

All existing consoles suck badly when compared to good PCs. But to be fair, if all you want is to be a button mashing zombie who plays dumb games with inferior pointing devices, be my guest.

Show me a Console that has a good GPU and can use a good trackball and keyboard and then we will have something worth talking about. Until then, I stand by my claims that PCs are always better."

,Traziz,2011-02-16T09:26Z,"@Omninegro...

PC's are not the future and never will be. Silly to compare consoles and PC's with hardware, for one there is so many combinations of hardware out there for the PC there is no easy comparison.

But consider this look at games like Fallout3, GTA4, etc all smoothly played on the consoles but horribly laggy on the PC, because they were console ports. The PS3 and 360 although had a 7800 GPU and a x1800 GPU were infact to a high degree overclocked and specific hardware changed.

Their CPU's are actually better than most PC users CPU's, both having the ability to use Virtual cores to help with things.

But back to your off topic idea, we are not talking about quality of hardware in the long run, but the software and more importantly games themselves. Most developers don't want to sit and code for the PC when they have already coded for the consoles, because they know most will download it so they just port it, and usually most of the time release them on console first to make money.

Infact some developers won't touch the PC at all, even when they started on the PC market. Again that shows you the mindset of the developers.

Now you can sugar coat what your doing all you want but in the end its the broadband kiddies who are killing the PC market, and it will show in a year or two. Guarenteed."
