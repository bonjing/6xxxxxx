IMDB - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1105728/

A small boy with a big dream of riding an elephant finds his hopes suddenly dashed when the curmudgeonly superintendent who presides over the apartment building informs the tenants that in order to rent the grounds for their extravagant summer party they will have to pay an exorbitant fee. All signs indicated that this would be the best party ever; not only was there going to be plenty of great food, but the organizers promised to bring in a live elephant in order to entertain the children! Frode couldn't have been looking forward to the party more. But then the superintendent proved to be a stickler for details, insisting that the tenants cough up a tidy sum for use of the apartment grounds. His dreams now fading before his very eyes, Frode discovers that downstairs neighbor Mr. Storm has been the victim of mysterious burglaries, and that he's offered a substantial reward for the capture of the culprit responsible for the crimes. Now, if Frode and his friends can beat their bitter rivals the basement gang to nabbing the burglar, perhaps they can use the reward money to finance the party and make this the most memorable summer ever.
