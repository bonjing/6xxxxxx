does your ANGEL HEART has the end credits in it?? & even this one??"
,wylde_dude,2011-02-11T10:01Z,Thanks a lot...
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-11T10:28Z,"@abhikrit: Cue-point is ""Stunts"".

No one here want to throw out the money for seeing who mopped the floor and who was been ""responsible"" for holding the mike grip.

One who ""need"" that - should buy an original. Got that?"

,abhikrit,2011-02-11T10:44Z,"@twentyforty..

FYI some movies have after credits scene.. i do like to see those as well... ah anyways.... leave it..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-11T11:06Z,"@abhikrit: I know that. I have the original and I can see what is incorporated in end credits.
And - I left these ""thingies"" in - in ALL my encodes. All. If they have any value for downloaders, but if these are slide-show of crew to show how good time they have on locations, I cut them out too."
,dark_defender,2011-02-11T11:55Z,"Twentyforty,
Thanks for another great encode & upload..+1

When then pricks hit minus it gives your fans all the more reason to click on + sign. I for instance, hit + even if i don't DL coz:
1) I can trust your encodes blindly.
2) I want to appreciate the blood and sweat you put in everyday-every minute of your life to give us something we want, that too absolutely free.

@All: Plz go to every torrent of this great man(20-40) and hit on + sign. He deserves it.

If you don't have an account then make one & appreciate by hitting + sign. 
Don't be a spectator - come here take things & go. Try & learn to be more responsible.

*Thumbs Up*"

Take action if necessary."
