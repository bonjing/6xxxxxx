vol 5

Beginning with Tears of a clown (a UK number one hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles), this volume contains plenty of high-charting hits. Other UK top ten hits include War (Edwin Starr), The love you save, I'll be there (both Jackson 5), Ball of confusion (Temptations), It's all in the game, Still water (both Four Tops), It's wonderful, I'll say forever my love (both Jimmy Ruffin), Ain't no mountain high enough (Diana Ross), Stoned love (Supremes) and Abraham Martin and John (Marvin Gaye - in America it was Smokey Robinson and the Miracles who had the hit with this song).

Only four tracks here failed to make the UK top ten. Forget me not (Martha Reeves and the Vandellas) only just missed, while Signed sealed delivered (Stevie Wonder) and It's a shame (Detroit Spinners - known just as the Spinners in America) also made the UK top twenty. Heaven help us all (Stevie Wonder) just made the UK top thirty.

This is a very strong compilation of some of Motown's classic songs from 1970 and 1971, showing that (at that stage) Motown was still the leading soul-pop label.
