,labgrt,2011-10-08T12:35Z,"could not watch film. pc simply hangs. when i tried to delete the file, windows explorer crashes. couldn't connect to any site associated with google. i had to use 3rd party software to delete file. only then was i able to connect to google.

did this file come from china? perhaps that would explain my problems with it."

Labgrt is uneducated and obviously does not know any thing noteworthy about computers or the economy. People like her should be wiped off the face of the planet because just by living they are making every one else worse off. "
