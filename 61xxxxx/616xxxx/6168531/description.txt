           As children, Nick and his little brother take care of          
           their baby brother while their mother drinks herself           
           senseless. But the baby dies, and both brothers blame          
           themselves. Many years later, Nick is out of prison after      
           serving time for an assault. He drinks, lives in a             
           shelter and tries to help an old friend. When their            
           mother dies, Nick meets his brother at the funeral. The        
           brother, who remains nameless, is a single father to a         
           young boy, but also supports a drug habit that is              
           spiraling out of control. When an opportunity presents         
           itself, he becomes a drug dealer to secure his son's           
           future. Eventually, the two brothers meet again.
