 * BusyCal is our new product that combines a beautiful, personal desktop calendar with our award winning calendar sharing and syncing technology â€” in one integrated application.

* Integrated calendar sharing and synchronization

Designed for families and small workgroups, BusyCal allows users to easily and cost-effectively share calendars on a local area network and over the internet without the need for a dedicated server, and to sync with Google Calendar. Shared calendars can be viewed and edited by multiple users and changes are instantly synchronized between users.

* Live Weather, recurring To Dos, customizable Views and more!

In addition to calendar sharing and synchronization, BusyCal provides the ability to view live weather feeds in your calendar; create ToDos, including recurring ToDos, that display in the calendar view and auto-forward until completed; view events in a customizable List View; and apply custom fonts, styles and colors to events.

*  Compatibility

BusyCal syncs with the iPhone, MobileMe, and just about any other application or device that supports Sync Services. And its backward compatible with BusySync too.
