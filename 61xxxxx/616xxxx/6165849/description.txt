My Comments:

Hi, this is my first torrent, and the reason I am uploading this torrent, is because I want make high quality movies available to torrent downloaders that are simple and easy to use.

In my past experience of being a torrent downloader (witch I still am) I began to realize that alot of movies come in file formats that are not compatible with some of the common players, such as Windows Media Player. So I decided that I would start uploading some movies in simple Mp4 or AVI format, which are compatible with Windows Media Player and many other players.

(I will also never upload Cams, only DVD-rips.)

This movie is a DVD-rip (meaning I used a program to copy the movie from the disc onto my hard drive) and the definition is great.
Please comment and give me some feedback on weather you liked this torrent or not and how I can change it to make it better next time, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.

By the way, I will be uploading some more movies soon, enjoy.
