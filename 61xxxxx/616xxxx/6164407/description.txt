*PROPER Notes....: Sons.of.Guns.S01E06.HDTV.XviD-CRiMSON is 120ms out of sync and is overcropped on the left, right, and bottom.
		   This time I am providing a screenshot of the left side in the sample dir and
		   This is getting ridiculous. It's not that hard to scan through the episode to see the largest frame. It's even
		   easier to check sync when there are guns being shot in the episode.
