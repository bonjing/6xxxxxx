,brianxxx,2011-02-10T23:56Z,"Oh yeah! Now this is what I am talking about.

You actually need the PLUS PACK for this if you are working with SSD drives. The PP allows for TI to have proper partition alignment.

Thanks!"

,1TWISTED,2011-02-11T14:08Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,some-young-guy,2011-02-19T15:45Z,"Imagine this, you wipe your drive with DBAN and there is nothing at all that remains. On your external HDD, you have an Acronis TIB file that has imaged your complete machine. Do you have to reinstall your OS, then your drivers, then Acronis just to be able to migrate your backup, or is there a method one can use to imprint the backup image onto the wiped HDD?

I successfully converted the TIB to ISO with IMGburn, downloaded WinRAR but cannot locate the process to convert the ISO to an EXE, or a program I'd need to split the 60GB TIB/ISO file up to burn those frags discs,

Does anyone have a work around? Acronis sure set the stage for users to greatly depend on their product for all aspects of cloning. "

"
,Bob__Dole,2011-02-21T07:18Z,"biscusman, the file is ATI2011PP.6696.msi, and there is a pp.txt key file for it."
,MktgGuru,2011-02-23T02:50Z,"Are the add-ons in this Plus Pack also the latest build 6696 2-4-11?

,brianxxx,2011-02-23T16:47Z,"Thanks Nikita! Out did yourself by having it all in one package!

Very nice including the Media Add-Ons too! Hard to get that without an account. lol

Very nice to be able to create a 'safe mode' boot disk for rescue. 

Thanks!"
,Inter95,2011-03-07T01:59Z,"Very nice Upload, although the BootCD Rescue is a trial. it doesnt matter if I use BootCD that come with this upload or if I created one when I install ATIH2011. it always appears like a trial. any idea?"
