""THE CHICAGO CODE, the compelling new police drama from critically acclaimed creator Shawn Ryan (â€œThe Shieldâ€), follows the Windy Cityâ€™s most powerful and respected cops as they navigate the cityâ€™s underbelly to fight crime and expose corruption within Chicagoâ€™s notorious political machine.â€Jarek is razor blades and brass knuckles wrapped in politeness and egoless charm.â€Set and shot on location in Chicago, THE CHICAGO CODE is a fast-paced series centered on JAREK WYSOCKI (Jason Clarke), a local legend and a larger-than-life veteran of the Chicago Police Department who wields considerable power thanks to his relationship with TERESA COLVIN (Jennifer Beals), his ex-partner and the cityâ€™s first female superintendent, now in charge of a 10,000-member police force."""
