      Bafta-winning director Morgan Matthews's landmark film
      exploring the impact of teenage killings on families and
      communities across Britain, an emotional journey that chronicles
      every teenager who died as a result of violence in 2009 in the
      UK. Harrowing actuality filmed in the immediate aftermath
      combines with moving testimony from the spectrum of people
      affected in the wake of violent death. Filmed over eighteen
      months, this epic documentary is the BBC's most ambitious film
      to date about youth violence.
