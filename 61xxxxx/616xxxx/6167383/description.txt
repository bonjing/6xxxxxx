First-time feature filmmaker Jake Rademacher attempts to understand the experiences, motivations, and sacrifices made by his two brothers, both of whom enlisted to serve their country by fighting in Iraq, by joining them on the front lines and experiencing their hardships firsthand. Isaac and Joe Rademacher are soldiers. Their brother, Jake, is not. Now, in an effort to understand just why his brothers have chosen to serve their country in the way that they have, Jake travels behind the camouflage curtain on secret missions into sniper "hide sites" in the Sunni Triangle, dodges machine-gun fire in a tense stand-off with the Iraqi Army, and follows secret reconnaissance troops on the Syrian border. Through these experiences, Jake is offered the unique opportunity to explore the bonds between soldiers on the front lines, and the effects their absence has on the loved ones awaiting their return back home.
