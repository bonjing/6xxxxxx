Dermot Oâ€™Leary joined BBC Radio 2 in September 2004, presenting a Saturday afternoon show called The Dermot O'Leary Show. A regular part of his show is the Saturday Sessions. These are live sessions in which a whole host of acts and bands perform both their own music and covers.
Dermot Oâ€™Leary now presents the Saturday Sessions album, packed full of live and acoustic performances from artists from Lily Allen, Paolo Nutini and Paloma Faith to Mumford & Sons, Amy Winehouse and Kasabian to Florence and The Machine and the Ting Tings. This album includes covers of classic tracks by the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and many more, along with stripped back performances of current tracks.
