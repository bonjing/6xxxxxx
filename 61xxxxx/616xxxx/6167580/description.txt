Exterior models

The highly detailed models include modelled rivets and stitching on the fuselage.
A unique mapping technique provides a 'canvas' texture to the exterior finish and carefully researched colours have been applied in such a way as to replicate the unusual 'colour change' effect of the paint used on the S.E.5A.
Each model has a fully animated pilot, opening gun-hatch and a Lewis gun which swings down on its Foster mount.
All rigging is accurately modelled, including the RAF aerodynamic rigging wire and round flying wires, bottle screws and fittings.
Inspection windows in the wings and tail reveal the pulley gear for the control wires to ailerons and elevator.
Radiator shutters on the Viper variant operate from the cockpit and detail includes bungee cord 'suspension', correct Palmer AeroCord tyres and even tyre valves in the wheel covers.
Highly detailed Vickers and Lewis machine guns are included, as well as engine detail such as radiator and fuel caps and priming cups.
Virtual Cockpits

'Baked' textures for a worn, period look.
Accurate renditions of all the period instruments and fittings, including the fuel hand pump, fuel tank selector, magneto switches and a 'working' magneto with crank handle for starting.
Includes a spare magazine for the Lewis gun (visual only) and working trim wheel for 'elevator' trim.
Features all internal rigging wires and flying wires, and the correctly modelled flying control wires and fittings.

Textures

We have attempted to replicate the look and feel of a Great War fighting machine. Much debate over actual colours exists, but a mix between dark green and chocolate results in a fascinating 'colour change' effect, depending on lighting. We believe that, from researched data and period pictures, that this is how the S.E.5A would have appeared over the front lines of war-torn France.


Paintkit

A paintkit is supplied with all weathering and detail included on the layers. (It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of Photoshop techniques and re-painting Flight Simulator models.)


Flight dynamics

Highly tuned S.E.5A flight dynamics
Sounds

A high quality sound set brings the S.E.5A to life and effects include start-up, idle and RPM reduction when inverted.
