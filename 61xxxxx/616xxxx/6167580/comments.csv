,SimGameIt,2011-02-14T18:13Z,VaticanCity you must be either sonic or one of his idiots. Apparently you know nothing about how to edit the files. Cause if you did youd realize that there is no problem with any of my aircraft in multiplayer or single player. Weve been flying them just fine for years. Maybe your having the typical computer problem. You know the ID10T error. Quit trying to spread lies. Cause youll look like an ass in the end. Wheres your proof of your claims? Mine is simple. Install the plane. Join a session and have fun. So save the drama for yo mama.
