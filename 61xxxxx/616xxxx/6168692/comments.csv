,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-14T23:49Z,If you would've done a little research you would've known that the redux version sucks. The addition of more footage and the editing makes this a different movie altogether. It's a pity you didn't upload the original version.
,ramalan,2011-06-14T01:01Z,"Unfortunately, the end credits are cut off. This is a sin on such a movie."
,schnitzelburger,2012-02-16T20:02Z,Awful! Horrible rip! File size is much too small for this.
,vividh,2012-03-08T15:15Z,"Man you are amazing...Thanks.
Any Chance you could do Titanic in 1080p? I would really love it."
