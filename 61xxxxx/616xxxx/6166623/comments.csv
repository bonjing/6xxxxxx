,suzuki600srad,2011-02-11T17:12Z,"i am going to seed like hell when i finally get this downloaded, so many people download and then fuck off, come on people this is the whole point, if we all just downloaded and fucked off, this would not work. try sharing "
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-02-11T17:24Z,"Well siad - i'm still seeding......

And some people have started uppiing this as their own! Shame on them!"
,freeworkman3,2011-02-11T17:30Z,Is there anyone that is going to mix the english audio to the russian dvd? Or is it not needed and the workprint actually not missing any of the special affects?
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-02-11T18:14Z,I tried all day yesterday with the two sources before upping them. But it looks like there would be a big amount of work to do. Maybe a big RG could manage it - but not me :( 
,suzuki600srad,2011-02-11T19:05Z,"@Horrorspoke i think you have done a great job with this a10 v10, also think it is a shame that others are upping this as there own. (sad twats)

i am seeding with as much bandwidth as i have.

is there much difference between this and say the theatrical release?

thanks again dude,

 you rock

[V],Horrorspoke,2011-02-11T19:41Z,"I've been told (and it seems that) most of the sfx are there. The main differences are changes of camera angle and differences in the dialogue. And the inclusion or deletion of various (short) parts.

I'm glad you appreciate the upload, and big thanks to MadVillian for allowing me to upload it. I've been dying to see it, and I'm sure you guys have too.

I believe there are a few people trying a mix between the DVD and the Workprint, but we'll see what happens.

Enjoy the movie.!.!.!"
,slimjimpei,2011-02-12T06:24Z,a 9 v 9 funny movie thx horrorspoke
,herl0ck,2011-02-12T11:41Z,"great movie, and good quality!
special effects are missing (you often see just a set of markers and/or texted commends what should appear there). also no end-credits.
but nonetheless nice to watch!"
,ManLemon,2011-02-12T15:32Z,"Thanks a bunch, Horrorspoke, been wondering when this would come out... seen the trailer over a year ago but heard nothing of it since."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-02-12T18:04Z,This film looks so funny!
,cymadra,2011-02-12T20:15Z,Thank you so much for this up.  I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for over a year now.

,DickDickstein,2011-02-18T20:48Z,"great up bro. 

Have to say though I got a chuckle out of you complaining that others are upping it as if it were their own. Yer a pirate dude. LOL"

,rdrive,2011-05-02T20:55Z,"What a great film.  A must see and funny with it too.

Thanks Horrospoke for your work."
,mustafacc,2011-07-18T18:01Z,"great torrent, i've seen both the original and this work print the main difference is that few parts are removed and some are added, few effects are messed up and not clear( such as stabbing and stuff) , and the lighting differs too. other than that it's great.

A/9
V/10
M/7"
