         Peyton and Elena are, on the surface,            
         diametrically opposed - one, a well-known        
         lesbian writer, the other a mother and wife of   
         a pastor - but when their paths cross, several   
         times over, they feel compelled to connect.      
         What begins as friendship quickly blossoms into  
         something deeper. Peyton tries to extricate      
         herself before her heart wants what it can't     
         have. Elena can't imagine not having Peyton in   
         her life. And despite the fact that she has      
         never even considered kissing a woman, Elena is  
         overwhelmed with a desire to do just that.       
         Despite Peyton's reservations, Elena pushes      
         the relationship into a full-blown affair. The   
         two women fall deeply in love, both keenly       
         aware a future together might be little more     
         than a dream.
