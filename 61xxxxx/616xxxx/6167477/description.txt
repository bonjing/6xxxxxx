This is a poster someone asked me to upload. It's quite big, so people can print it out if they want. I also included a smaller image file for viewing.

The poster contains all kinds of graphs from observations that show the atmosphere is warming and how we know human activities are causing that warming (which potentially could lead to changing the climate patterns we rely on for agriculture etc.). It also contains inspiring quotes from people in the know.

Please spread and seed for a while.
