,BigLe2e,2011-12-20T09:53Z,"Downloaded and extracted fine, but when I try to run the eqgame shortcut it tells me d3dx9_30.dll is missing. Anyone else have this issue or know how to fix it?"
,ibleet,2012-01-07T05:03Z,"That error typically means that you are missing the required Direct X9 runtime. You can get it at microsoft.com. And no, Direct x 11 is not backward compatible. I hope that helps...if you still have the same issue. If so, please share with others how you were able to resolve it."
