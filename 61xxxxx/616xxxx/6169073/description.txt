Lincoln

Innovative and intimate, LINCOLN goes deeper than any documentary has before to reveal the troubled depths behind the man known as the Great Emancipator.

Filmed as if through the president's own eyes, LINCOLN is a profound and insightful meditation on a man few knew. Burdened by a tragic family life, suicidal urges and unsettled sexuality, Lincoln was able to employ his powerful wit and innate charm to transform his inner demons. A devastating and moving chronicle of a president's last moments, LINCOLN captures the dark soul that fueled one of history's brightest lights.

Directed by the co-producer of the Academy-Awardr winning When We Were Kings, LINCOLN features striking archival material and interviews with leading Lincoln biographers like Gore Vidal, Jan Morris, and Harold Holzer, as well as Andrew Solomon, National Book Awardr winning author of The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression.
