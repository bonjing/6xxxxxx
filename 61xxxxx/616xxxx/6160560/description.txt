> Description

ES is a free enterprise search solution, suitable for corporate use, web search or adding search functionality to cloud applications.


Searchdaimon ES is full future enterprise search solution with minimum setup requirements. It will let you search information from documents, e-mail, e-mail attachments, customer relation systems and other content sources. 

ES supports many data sources and the possibility of attribute navigation and collection sorting. It will maintain existing permissions, prohibiting non-authorized users from reading documents. You may use it together with Microsoft Active directory to provide a secure search function for your enterprise, as a public available search engine for your webpage, or as a OEM to add search to your cloud or SaaS application. 

In addition to the build-in data connectors you may write your own connectors to index other data source, or push data over http. You can also create your own search frontends and retrieve search results by xml and rss.
