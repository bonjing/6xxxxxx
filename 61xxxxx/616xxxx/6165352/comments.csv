Windows 7 64bit followed the instructions exactly.

When you play a voice is say ""the license is not valid for this computer"".

The voices also SUCK.. real bad. Microsoft Sam quality and low def. Stay away from this."

Bad News... This install is in Spanish :(
Good News... I translated it, virus checked it, and took it for a test spin to make sure it worked :)

A) Expand The Files (Just unpack part one and it will unpack all three)
B) You Should See 3 Files, Run ""autorun.exe"" This Should Open The Custom Install Panel

Installation From Panel
-----------------------
1) Click the ""TTS 7 Engine"" button, accept the Terms and Agreements, and pick any name to install it under
2) Click the ""TTS 7 SDK"" button, accept the Terms and Agreements, and pick any name to install it under
3) Choose your language by clicking ""InglÃšs"" for English or ""EspaÂ±ol"" for Spanish
4) Patch the program by clicking ""TTS 7 Patch""
5) To finish click the button marked ""Complemento"" but DO NOT click anything after that
6) Go to Start->All Programs->Accessories-> Click the ""Command Prompt"" icon
7) In the black command screen type ""ipconfig /all"" (without the "" "" obviously) and press enter
8) Look for an entry that says ""Physical Address"" that's your MAC address
9) Now go back to the grey box from Step 5 and click the drop down to select your MAC address and activate

If you'd like to add any of the voices for the program (I highly suggest you do) just click on the voice's name and it will prompt you to install. Each voice file is only roughly 40mb. They are stored in computer path: ""Program Files\Loquendo\LTTS7\data\voices"". My reccomendation is you install them all then delete the ones you do not use.

Enjoy the program!

That being said, unfortunately I do not think that this program lives up to it's claim of ""truly natural sounding voices"".  Na-ah. Not on this planet. "
