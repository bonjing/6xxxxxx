,neil_diamond ,2011-02-12T13:52Z,"This is what happens when you copy EVERYBODY else's movies and don't even look at them, instead your only doing it to advertise YOUR site. You end up duplicating THEIR mistake. This is Stag Night, not Stag Night Of The Living Dead.

And basically all you're really doing is doubling the load PIRATEBAY has to carry by doubling all the popular movies they already have. "
