,dark_defender,2011-02-11T17:14Z,"@abhikrit :If you only knew how to look for info on 20-40 uploads. If you could read properly, he provides info in detail for his torrents thats coz he maintains standards for particular format. For eg:

720p = for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV and movies) frame-size is 640p or 1120x640
             (because of my own limit of 1400 MB per encode)  
             or 1216x528-544 pixels for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR),
             hardware intensive

Read this page
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6164783/TV.Shows.Pack.Feb.9.H264[CHOOSE]

If you were one of his regular downloader you would know these things. 
Do not indulge in defaming someone without adequate information. Thats not something people like YIFY, 20-40 or any other uploader are looking for after putting in so much hard work."

,abhikrit,2011-02-11T18:32Z,"@ dark_defender


listen you asshole...you dont need to interrupt in my comments.... YIFY knows very well how much i respect him & how much i have helped him with my seedbox along with other encoders....i myself am a professional encoder....

& tell me asshole where does he writes about the length or duration of the file.... & what the hell did you say?? ""regular downloads""
you ignorant dumb ass... I OWN A SCENE RELEASE SITE.... know what that means stupid prick!!!! 
@ dark defender..a piece of advice... change your name to dumb defender...will be appropriate "
,dark_defender,2011-02-11T19:18Z,"@abhikri: LOL. You think you know shit. One thing is for sure, i don't need to abuse to be heard, unlike you. I drive my comment with content and supported facts but not abusing.

Regarding duration or runtime of the file is concerned on 20-40 torrents, well if you happen to notice he provides IMDB link. Even if thats not suffice as few titles have different type of releases hence, different runtime. In that case you can refer to screenshots provided in that torrent which hardly exceeds 1 or 2 mb.

P.S: Keep your advise to yourself. None of your advice will do any good to anyone, neither you."
,dark_defender,2011-02-11T19:23Z,"^ And yes. Yet again if you had read carefully i said if you were one of ""his(20-40) regular downloader"" you would know. Not ""regular downloads"". There is a difference.

@twentyforty
does your ANGEL HEART has the end credits in it?? & even this one?? 
> twentyforty at 2011-02-11 10:28 CET: 
@abhikrit: Cue-point is ""Stunts"".

No one here want to throw out the money for seeing who mopped the floor and who was been ""responsible"" for holding the mike grip.

One who ""need"" that - should buy an original. Got that? 
>abhikrit at 2011-02-11 10:44 CET: 
@twentyforty..
FYI some movies have after credits scene.. i do like to see those as well... ah anyways.... leave it... 

>twentyforty at 2011-02-11 11:06 CET: 
@abhikrit: I know that. I have the original and I can see what is incorporated in end credits.
And - I left these ""thingies"" in - in ALL my encodes. All. If they have any value for downloaders, but if these are slide-show of crew to show how good time they have on locations, I cut them out too.

LOL to ""FYI""."
