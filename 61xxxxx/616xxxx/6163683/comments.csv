For me the game started working as soon as I installed the patch executable on the bottom of the page."

Of course it's not going to be installed to the correct path, because uploader didnt Zip the file-path. 
On top of that, the Sentinels installer must be looking for a non-existent registry key.
so it wont install.
Youre better off just finding the 1.3 gig version if you plan on playing Sentinels.
Still, if you just want the original (without widescreen), this is the way to good."
