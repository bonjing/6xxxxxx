Silent Storm was a pretty good game and looking at some videos nowadays, I still find that it can amaze. It's probably the best tactic/rpg game since Jagged Alliance 2 came out. There were many tries to make a good copy, but most suffered due to a poor QA and other factors, that such an ambitious games would meet. So, completeness comes at a cost: the game isn't a big, free-to-explore map, but mission based, though still with enough non-linearity to keep replay values high. As you have already guessed, game take place during a second world war, but you won't take action in any famous battles, but will fight on a covert front. There are many random encounters. And there are tons of weapons and equipment: enough firearms and cold weaponry to stuff a museum with.
