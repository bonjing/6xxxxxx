My album of the year for 2002. for sure im a mick jagger fan,but i never expected this cd to be quite so wonderful. outstanding. its no wonder the walking cliche, mr.richards, speaks ever more bitterly of micks,outside (the stones)work.it has been,(keith..doth protest too much), clear to most stones fans for a very long time,where all their strongest melodies come from,and this cd just underlines the fact. great tunes,some surprisingly personal lyrics,and mick voice sounds stronger than ever,all add up to my favourite mick offering since Tattoo You.other reviewers named their favourite tracks,all superb,(except maybe-everybodys getting high-which grates on me personally,but thats just me),anyway, i think the two mid-tempo closing tracks ,are for me,two of the most beautiful songs mick ever wrote,and he sings them with great passion.stunning. 6 years down the line this cd still surprises me with its brilliance. if youre reading this because you like micks 'good stuff',and are curious...buy this album. criminal that you can get it for under a quid,ha.
