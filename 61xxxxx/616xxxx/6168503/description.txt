"In alchemical treatises, the formula L'Oeuvre au Noir, designates what is said to be the most difficult phase of the alchemist's process, the separation and dissolution of substance. It is still not clear whether the term applied to daring experiments on matter itself, or whether it was understood to symbolize trials of the mind in discarding all forms of routine and prejudice. Doubtless it signified one or the other meaning alternately, or perhaps both at the same time."
(Marguerite Yourcenar)

SUMMARY (IMDB)

In the sixteenth century, Spain occupies Flanders, an Inquisition enforces the faith. Aging writer and philosopher, ZÃ©non Ligre, comes to Bruges using a false name and papers to serve as a physician to the poor, establishing a clinic and steam bath. His methods and opinions are outside the mainstream, but he has the protection and friendship of the local Prior. ZÃ©non, an aristocrat with a degree in canon law, lives humbly. He learns of bacchanals under Masonic signs involving monks and women, and he warns those involved. The Prior is dying, and he urges ZÃ©non to flee to England. ZÃ©non burns his writing. Will he leave or will he face ecclesiastical accusers and, perhaps, the stake?  Written by {jhailey@hotmail.com}

REVIEW (IMDB)

AndrÃ© Delvaux was a talented filmmaker whose works can be difficult to watch. They seem to drift by in a sort of glacial calm, although the subject matter is often very interesting. Rendez-vous Ã  Bray was the first film of his I saw, and it repaid watching even if the emotional temperature was rather low. L'Oeuvre au noir is taken from a Marguerite Yourcenar novel, and shows the austerity she was famous for. At times it feels rather like walking barefoot over a marble floor.

Gian-Maria VolontÃ©'s voice had to be dubbed for the film [probably why the Italian audio track is better synchronized], but his face is expressive. We can follow his efforts to bring modern medical and scientific practices to Flanders in defiance of the Inquisition. Sami Frey as his cousin the prior is sympathetic.
