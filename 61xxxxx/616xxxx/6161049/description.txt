  PLOT : :: ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 Each member of a family in Taipei asks hard questions about life's meaning
 as they live through everyday quandaries. NJ is morose: his brother owes him
 money, his mother is in a coma, his wife suffers a spiritual crisis when she
 finds her life a blank, his business partners make bad decisions against his
 advice, and he reconnects with his first love 30 years after he dumped her.
 His teenage daughter Ting-Ting watches emotions roil in their neighbors' flat
 and is experiencing the first stirrings of love. His 8-year-old son Yang-Yang
 is laconic like his dad and pursues truth with the help of a camera. "Why is
 the world so different from what we think it is?" asks Ting-Ting.
