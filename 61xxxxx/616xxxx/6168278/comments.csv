,moe411,2011-02-12T15:36Z,"proper movie???

,zipagan,2011-02-12T17:22Z,"This looks like the same as:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6167325/Stag.Night.of.the.Dead.2010.DVDRip.XviD-MiRACLE

and:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6167317/Stag.Night.of.the.Dead.2010.DVDRip.XviD-MiRACLE

...in which case it's a movie called 'Stag Night' (2008) and NOT 'Stag Night of the Dead (2010)"
,richardpa,2011-02-13T03:10Z,"@zipagan... You're right this is the 2008 film ""Stag Night"" and not the 2010 movie ""Stag Night for the Dead""... 
Still a good copy and an ok movie..."
,mcdooby,2011-02-15T02:41Z,"why have a film titled as stag night of the dead when it isnt, that really annoys me. label your torrents correctly its no wonder parents dl elmo and end up with chunky bubble butt 5 or sum shizzzz. shame on you tvteam shame on you. ya cant see but im pointing at you like the evil monkey from family guy."
