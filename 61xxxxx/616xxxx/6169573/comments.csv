,Reviewer,2011-02-12T14:07Z,"Why is this upload only 6.98 when the other uploads are over 9.00 GB ? I trust the source, just wondering what was removed or did you just compress it ?"
,morfeus78,2011-02-12T14:47Z,thanks
,barbar69,2011-02-12T14:48Z,"thease is only english language ,other are full language"
,Rando_q1,2011-02-12T16:01Z,omg can only connect with 1 seed. speed is between 30-470kb/s... very unstable...
,BlackMoth,2011-02-12T16:39Z,thanks for this
,resi10,2011-02-12T16:42Z,^^true so please seed you guys :/
,resi10,2011-02-12T16:43Z,and i wanna ask if this is the (fixed) version of Beta ?
,RMJ13,2011-02-12T16:50Z,"don,t waste your time there is a reason you see only CUT SCENE  video Pictures and not real game PICS, 65% of the texture,s are not  there!"
,trysis3,2011-02-12T17:06Z,whats the noGRP ?
,Reviewer,2011-02-12T19:20Z,"@RMJ13  How do you know this ? Do you have this upload or any of the others ? Have you played it or are you just one of these ""False Info' spreaders ? If you don't respond then we will know it's a lie.

United Reliable Pirate Bay something something........that guy needs to shorten it"
,ntongh2o,2011-02-12T22:13Z,@trysis3 probably means no german russian polish languages
,lucid657,2011-02-12T23:21Z,"Sweet, cutscenes are FINE! If you have 64bitos, use the bin64 exe instead, its wayyy more stable, and you can change the settings without crashing. Ive played it for some time now. "
,lucid657,2011-02-12T23:22Z,"Also, ""NoGRP"" Means ""No Group"". No scene or known non scene group released it, so therefore, NoGRP."
,ea-drm,2011-02-13T05:48Z,"You thieves, if you download this beta your parents will be disappointed of 
your shameful behavior, and your friends will all look down on you,
I believe this is not what you want!!
So, have patience for the game to release and buy the game,
just be a man of honor and honesty!"

I don't preach to any of you,
I just want to tell you be a thief is not right,
just like parents teach their children what to do.
Hope you'll understand...

,ea-drm,2011-02-13T15:06Z,"Some guys crying “seed please” and calling others greedy bastards, so interesting~~
Thieves are selfish nuts, they don’t care whether others can play the game,
they only care for themselves!
So, 
Support the game and maybe we’ll have crysis 3 on pc in the future.
May GODS bless paying supporters and spit on those pirates who disgrace 
pc-game industry!!"
,TheBhaasa,2011-02-13T15:18Z,"@mrcemetery

Hi guys, just found out why i couldnt get my game started for a while getting anoing black screen,Every time when i was connected to internet i cant start my game!?!?!?thats true, every time i disconnected its started, i think that BETA release is trying to connect itself to some internal crytek server, as it was released for testing only, im noT 1000% sure but i think so, after i run any map i need to turn on internet again to be able to play coz cant move my mouse without it, getting stable medium green,from 25-40 fps(i7 1.6 4gb gt230), if some got similar do it step by step

1.turn off internet
2.run that fuckin Beta many of bugs;]
