"Immortality" 

As the story shifts back to life "over there," 
the absence of Colonel Broyles shifts the 
dynamic of the Fringe Team as they investigate 
a bioterrorist armed with an insect that has a 
taste for human flesh. Meanwhile, alternate 
Olivia is reunited with her beau, and 
Walternate remains determined to save his 
world but discovers there are certain lines he 
will not cross.

Enjoy :)
