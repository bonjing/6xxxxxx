Description
Screencasts are the most effective way of explaining how to work on a Mac to friends, relatives, colleagues or customers. Screenium will help you demonstrate a workflow by making capturing it easy. Start the recording and forget about it while you concentrate on what you do best â€” equipping your viewers with knowledge.

Screenium offers a choice of four capture modes: capture the entire screen, a single window, a freely selectable area on your screen or have an area follow your mouse pointer.

â–  Have Screenium hide your Desktop wallpaper and icons during capture.
â–  Record everything you hear from your Mac's speakers along with the video.
â–  Connect a microphone or use your Mac's integrated mic to record your voice.
â–  Integrate a video from any QuickTime-compatible webcam or from your Mac's integrated iSight.
â–  Have your mouse pointer and your clicks stand out with the included mouse visualization.
â–  Control main features with freely assignable keyboard shortcuts.
â–  Export your captured videos into any QuickTime format available on your Mac.

A comprehensive user guide as well as an ever growing number of Q&As and videos delivering tips and tricks will make your first steps in podcast production so much easier. Start recording your first videos today â€” with Screenium.
