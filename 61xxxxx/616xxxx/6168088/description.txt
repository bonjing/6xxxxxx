

rip from the 6 channel ac-3 track from the supernature special edition...


the dts and pcm tracks on the dvd are compressed to death but the ac-3 track is not...


you will need foobar, the ac-3 plug-in for foobar and the "convert 5.1 to stereo" plug-in active (this one is already included in foobar, you just need to activate the dsp in order to downmix the files to stereo)


how to activate the "convert 5.1 to stereo" dsp  :  foobar --- file --- preferences --- playback --- dsp manager --- select the dsp and then move the dsp to the left ...   and dont forget to click OK





foobar :    http://www.foobar2000.org/download



ac-3 plug-in  :  http://www.foobar2000.org/components   (AC3 decoder 0.9.5)


extract and paste the dll. file in the foobar "components" folder



keed seeding and enjoy
