,saffordpc,2011-02-08T21:25Z,sorry if the upload rate is slow for now using my phone to tether for wireless(easiest way to get around my schools p2p block) will be up and running normally some time shortly after 2011-02-09  02:30:00 gmt
,saffordpc,2011-02-09T00:28Z,"*update to the readme as it well kinda wrong.
the keygen is used after installing the data model validator which is the second setup file(b5719).  again sorry for the slow upload currently ill have it on a real network in about 2 hours"
,CapBlah,2011-03-04T14:38Z,The KeyGen is infected with Generic.Dx trojan/keylogger
,saffordpc,2011-03-10T01:29Z,"@ capblah
that's a false positive.
i have installed this on multiple systems both my own and classmates.
out of curiosity what anti-virus are you using?"
,KengurBGD,2011-05-24T23:29Z,What version is this ? 4 . 14 ?
,turbo9876,2011-06-08T14:58Z,"Keygen works on second file (b5719) which is for CA ERwin Data Model Validator r7.3, but the keys (although they are ""valid"" for the first file ERwin Data Modeler 7.3), do not ""take"" and the program does not start. Any tricks on how you got it working?"
,saffordpc,2011-06-12T21:58Z,i just installed both files opened the keygen started erwin validator it asked for a key went to keygen and made sure the first dropdown was set to the right one (allfusion data model validator) and then copied the key from the keygen over. then everything in it worked
,turbo9876,2011-06-14T15:16Z,"I agree. The model VALIDATOR key works - what about the DATA MODELER? After I put the key in, it says ""FULL"" against the licence after I hit ADD, but as soon as I hit CONTINUE, nothing happens (it just shuts down instead of starting the program)"
,saffordpc,2011-06-14T20:40Z,honestly i have no clue then. mine goes to full i click continue them menu disappears but the program keeps running i go back to the licensed page and i see data modeler r7 licensed and then i see model navigator underneath it and it also says licensed. this is from running the data modeler. ill keep playing with see if i can replicate it but i haven't been able to yet
,Stephen2,2011-10-27T10:20Z,"You must run ERWIN DATA MODELER as ADMINISTRATOR or the license won't ""take"" as turbo9876 says.

Once run as Admin, it works OK with the included keygen."
