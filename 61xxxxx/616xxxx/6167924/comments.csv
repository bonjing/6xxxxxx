Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for

,strickt,2011-02-12T06:37Z,"****Partial FIX*****

For anyone having problems getting the game to load past the first cut scene or after the cut scene when you've exited the sub do this...

1. Go into desktop/""your name""/saved games/ and delete the crysis 2 folder
2. Start game in bin32(havent tried bin64 yet)
3. Set graphics to gamer and resolution to 800x600.
4. Go to campaign then level select and choose the second level from the top
5. Wait for it to load (it freezes for a second) and play
6. You can change the resolution to whatever you desire at this point however changing the graphics settings to anything other them gamer causes a crash for me.

Good luck

The discription is the same part that's in every other torrent, this torren on the other hand has had the .iso file already extracted.
All you have to do is to go into the bin32 folder and run the Crysis2.exe

Even though I'm running on a old gts250, I don't get any missing textures or anything.
Only glitches I've seen are that sometimes when a enemy spawns, their original ""shell"" or whatever you want to call it stays there. The enemy like, walks out of it and replicate itself."

Launch Crysis from the 64bin and it launches you directly into MP you can then switch to Single Player 64 bit from there. 

If you can't run a game edit the system.cfg and delete all lines except for these..


; crysis2

sys_game_folder=GameCrysis2
sys_dll_game=CryGameCrysis2.dll
sys_user_folder=Crysis2

You can't play this game under DX11 mode, because you have nothing to play! It's the same thing like engines in cars. Cars cannot go uphill with no engine. You can't drive a car without engine! You can't play with DirectX11 features, because this beta don't have em (it have only DX9)!

Download hamachi from google, just type it in and you will get a website.  Once you have that, you can also google planethamachi, it shows all the newest games that can be played.  

Once you have hamachi, you will need to join a network in the hamachi client, there are a number already posted.  Once you have joined a channel, you will have to wait and setup a server with some one else in channel.

Here is what I was told you need to do when some one makes the server,  ""change your profile to non.default one in the singleplayer menu, then return to multiplayer screen, open join match, select the server play"".

Well, unless there are tools among us here who DO buy everything without thinking about it first. Do you realise how pathetic that is? Will you buy a rock from me, too, if I tell you it's a car? For fucks sake, try things before you buy and give commercialism the finger: show some goddamn selfrespect you spineless handbags.

I haven't played past the first few minutes, because every light source in the game flickers heavily, like to a near seizure-inducing level. It's noticeable, but can be overlooked in the first room where you pick up the handgun. Once you make it outdoors, however, the Sun makes the game pretty much impossible to play.

Thank you soo much for this, really really helped. I had trouble starting the game back up after the first 3 times and after doing this it starts up again normally. 

If your game keeps freezing at the loading screen of a level after the cutscene of a mission try to lower your graphics settings to the lowest one and always keep them on ""gamer"" and not on ""advanced"" or ""hardcore"" as they will crush your pc if you dont meet the requirements. Thanks also for this torrent, awesome game."
,Lawlerhossen,2011-02-15T22:22Z,"I tried Cometangel's texture fix, but it only seems to make things worse. Whenever I boot up the game at the start of the ""pick up the handgun"" level with all that in my system.cfg file, I still have the severe flickering from light sources, as well as additional issues. Some of these I've noticed so far are my crosshairs near the top of the screen rather than being in the center, if I try and fire the pistol, it clicks (obviously, there's no ammo yet), but the ""Out of Ammo"" notice doesn't pop up. There are other notices that just don't show up, either, such as the notice to hold space to jump further, hold space to grab the ledge, etc.

And the light issue is a pretty hardcore flickering from every significant light source in the game, especially the Sun. It's not a brightness issue at all, just a big flickering and minor FPS drop. This makes it pretty much 100% unplayable, and I have to shield my eyes to quit the game.

It seems like a video card issue of some kind, but I have the latest drivers and, as I said before, I have dual ATI Radeon 5870s. If I can't get it running, it's whatever, as I realize this is a pretty early build with some pretty big issues. If anybody has any ideas, though, that'd be pretty awesome!"

Try leaving your graphics settings at the lowest resolution.

Actually, that's one of my favorite new features so far. Upgrades are fun. Surely by now someone's figured out some cheats/console commands to help out in this situation?

So far, it seems like most of the dev mode commands from the original game carry over to this one. Numpad 2 gets you unlimited ammo, F1 for third person, etc. The console command ""g_godmode = 1"" turns on god mode, but I haven't been able to figure out anything for suit energy or nano crystals yet. I'm particularly interested in a nano crystals cheat for using a ""Load Level"" workaround."
,phorqued,2011-02-17T08:42Z,"@Lawlerhossen

If you want to get the console commands just open the console and type ""dumpcommandsvars"" this will create a text file you can sift through with many of the commands having an explanation. 

Some of the more interesting commands I have sorted through are :

g_godMode 
g_giveCollectableEnergyPoints
i_dropitem
i_giveallitems
i_giveammo
i_givedebugitems
i_giveitem 
i_listitems (list all items available- mostly works)
g_infiniteAmmo
g_infiniteSuitEnergy

I can't wait until this is released for some online fragging! And I am glad I dl'd this... it was just as good as a demo IMO. It is sad that the code was released, but I don't think it will matter much for sales as people who want to play online will still need a legit account."

Direct X dlls maintain backward compatibility which is why that works- but it's just using the DX9 entry points in the DX11 dll- it's NOT USING DX11. The shaders have to be written specifically for DX11 and obviously they're not.

Each map is SO TINY, and there's just no open spaces to be in. Everything is in close and personal. I hate it! I'm sure the game itself will be good, and it looks incredible and whatnot, and moreover I'm positive4 it'll look even more incredible when it's got some proper dx11 enabled, but I am heavily disappointed in the small map sizes.

And as far as piracy goes for Crysis 1. Crytek makes me sick on that subject. They say Crysis 1 sales weren't good, do you have ANY IDEA how much fucking money that game made?? It still sells quite well NOW, almost 4 years later! However, this is a business, and consoles are UNFORTUNATELY the most popular and most business viable gaming platform, so I'm not surprised they decided to go cross platform."
,terraup,2011-02-19T00:49Z,"Hmm, I posted a comment earlier seems to have not turned up...?
Tried the editor, works great, bit confusing at first with the new UI. Human AI and physics do not seem to work in the editor, maybe just me. Have not checked out all features, not sure if there is actually anything hugely new, most things I tried are just the same as sandbox2.

If anyone has difficulty getting it to load, open the system.cfg in the same folder as bin32, bin64, editor, engine etc.
Then on the line r_shadersremotecompiler, change 1 to 0. Load the editor.exe (in either bin32 or bin64), it should load fully after 10-30 seconds."

,Holographic25,2011-02-20T12:09Z,"I see a lot of people complaining about Crysis 2 graphics. And they're right. As it is right now, Crysis 2 is severely dumbed down because it is a direct port. CryEngine 3 is essentially a dumbed down CryEngine 2 for those stupid consoles. Fortunately, PCs have the advantage of tweaking through console commands, so you can bring back some of the graphical glory the original Crysis is known for.  Anyway, here is a list of commands that you can add in your system.cfg to improve visual quality while maintaining decent performance: 

sys_spec_Full = 3 --> Sets graphics to full (Hardcore mode)
sys_spec_quality = 2 --> Sets the overall quality for graphic features. Setting it to 3 will decrease framerate with no noticeable visual improvements.
sys_spec_shadows = 2 --> Sets the overall quality for shadows. Setting this to 3 adds to much filtering to the shadows in my opinion. Set it as you prefer.
r_SSAO = 1 --> Stands for Screen Space Ambient Occlusion. It turns on penumbrae around objects that are not directly lit
r_SSAOQuality = 4 --> Sets quality level for SSAO
r_SSAOAmount = 2 --> Sets the amount of SSAO to be used in the scene
r_SSAORadius = 2 --> Sets the size and spread of the SSAO
r_UsePOM = 1 --> Enables Parallax Occlusion Mapping
e_LodRatio = 30 --> Sets the Level Of Detail for distant objects. The higher the value the more detailed distant objects will look; it will also lower fps when increased.
r_ReflectionsQuality = 4 
r_WaterCaustics = 1 --> This feature is disabled even when the game is set on Hardcore graphics. It enables the water caustics effect so that sun beams can pass through the water like in Crysis 1.
r_ColorGrading = 0 -->  Disable this feature if you don't like the polarized sunglasses filter look.  Disabling this feature improves fps.
r_UseEdgeAA = 1 --> Enables edge Anti-Aliasing
r_DepthOfField = 2 --> Sets the quality for DepthOfField witch blurs the surroundings when you aim through the weapon sights."
,Holographic25,2011-02-20T12:10Z,"q_ShaderMetal = 2 --> Sets the quality for Metal Shader and so on...
q_ShaderGlass = 2
q_ShaderVegetation = 2
q_ShaderIce = 2
q_ShaderTerrain = 2
q_ShaderShadow = 2
q_ShaderFX = 2
q_ShaderHDR = 2
q_ShaderSky = 2
q_ShaderWater= 2
r_TexturesStreaming = 0 --> Set this to 0 if you have more than 2 GB of RAM. If set to 0 textures will not be streamed as you walk around, they will be preloaded from a cache. Also, make sure that in system.cfg  r_TexturesStreaming is located at the end of the list. 
If for some reason the settings are not changed when you load a level, simply type in your console exec system.cfg 
This will execute the system.cfg and load all the settings in it. There are many more commands you can add and tweak, but these should improve image quality while maintaining a playable framerate. "

On a personal note, I think this game looks amazing. Just gorgeous. However there are some things that are dumbed down, so I will admit there have been some compromises for the sake of those proprietary and computationally inferior little pc's people like to call consoles. I still think this will be an AMAZING opportunity for the modding community, especially once the final product hits and we all use these tools and the tools they officially give us to create one of the most impressive modding communities to date. In summation: this is going to be awesome."

,flairtorc,2011-02-22T21:25Z," In the campaign, when you upgrade your nano suit with the nano catalyst, notice that at the end of every level, they disappear sometimes(the ones you upgraded, or only a few of them). The way to fix this is as soon as you upgrade them, simply hit F5 on the keyboard to quick save(if you didn't already know about that), then exit to main menu. Then, simply load from the quick save. This will force it to register that you attained that #/12 Nano Upgrades on the campaign completion chart. Also, another error occurs that unless you spend some of your nano catalyst you gained on at least one upgrade on that level, whatever you gained on that level(the nano catalyst) will disappear. If you don't get what I am saying I will use an example.
 Example:
Campaign level: 8 
Starting Nano Catalyst: 480
Starting Nano Upgrades: 2/12
Through to the end of the level you gain;
Nano Catalyst Gain: 500
 Lets say you spend it on something(say spent 200, but don't save, exit campaign, then re-enter.
 A: You wont keep the upgrade
 B: You will lose what you spent, but keep what you gained.
 Outcome;
Nano Catalyst: 780
Nano Upgrades: 2/12
However, if you spend no points, you will not keep what you gained.
 Outcome;
Nano Catalyst: 480
Nano Upgrades: 2/12
The right thing to do, ON ANY LEVEL YOU GAIN NANO CATALYST, is to spend it on at least one thing, save as soon as you spend it with F5, exit to main menu, then re-enter campaign.
  Your (preferable) Outcome;
Nano Catalyst: 780
Nano Upgrades: 3/12
 I know this was very long but I hope it helps everyone, because you aren't supposed to lose your upgrades at the end of every level. THAT IS A GLITCH.
 Here are the steps again;
1. If you gain nano catalyst, Spend it on at least one thing.
2. Immediately after spending, press F5 to quick save.
3. Exit to main menu.
4. Re-enter your campaign and load the quick save you just made.
5. Enjoy keeping those precious nano suit upgrades.

 Note: Be Sure to reactivate your upgrades after every level, save load, and cut scene.(They deactivate after these)"

,jakeenan1,2011-02-28T18:04Z,"Hey, thanks. I figured that out last night and started to edit the file but to be completely honest, I'm just going to wait and buy the game.  Spending this much time to customize a Beta version doesn't make sense to me.  Even if you get it just the way you want, its still beta and will still be buggy.  "
,freemini,2011-02-28T21:09Z,"Does anyone know where the save games are? I can't play the last levels, so I want to continue on the final game. Thanks"
,PX173,2011-03-01T12:48Z,"nah, not quite. they can't file a lawsuit against those who download even if they put tracers. the only legal action they could take would have to be against the guy who leaked it, who is almost certainly an internal employee.

we're not stealing. we're taking the stolen material which is given away for free. not punishable legally."
,The77s,2011-03-05T17:29Z,"I run Crysis2.exe from Bin64 (I'm using W7 64-bit), game starts fine, I skip Login, but when I go to start a Level or a new Campaign, game goes to the loading Screen and seems to freeze, I can just hear talking in the background, almost like the game is actually running, I just can't do anything.

I've tried pressing Escape and it seems to bring up a menu, because I can hear the sound, so I think the Loading screen gets stuck, but I can still do everything, just can't see.

Anyone know if there are any fixes?"
,NeroNoctis,2011-03-09T04:58Z,"You can't play multiplayer, this game isn't even out yet!"
,NeroNoctis,2011-03-09T05:30Z,@lacywest What the hell is wrong with you? Just play the damn game the way it's meant to be played.
,eycel,2011-03-10T02:24Z,"hi all, few new things.  I got website for anyone looking to find out how to play, its http://www.crysis2leaked.com.  Any of the old leaked players can all talk about what the game was like when it first was leaked, i will be adding a forum.  "
,NeroNoctis,2011-03-10T03:34Z,"I ran the game, it was buggy as fuck (arms were black, guy in the first rookm in the sub had a blue glowing head that made a lens flare, a lot of other bugs) then when Prophet said ""it'll be on you now"" the game crashed and wouldn't start. I uninstalled it and am now reinstalling it."
,Ratmanslim,2011-03-10T13:39Z,"Works fine for me, but has some bugs. Sometimes the rocket launcher doesn't really work, some sound issues - different volumes depending on character - and sometimes (especially when loading a save) there can pop up characters at random positions just standing there with their arms stretched out. It is the full game though, but I didn't really like it.

Play the game and get your own opinion.

,Kezra,2011-03-10T14:12Z,though i read through the comments and noone replied to the problem of a missing image data 3 people also had that problem so i guess this torrent is FAKE (virus/trojan)
,eriks14042,2011-03-11T14:08Z,"If you've really read the comments,you'd see people saying its working. Figure out your problem yourself. You can rarely count on others anyway. Use ""Search"" Or something. Or next time just keep an eye where the folders are installed"

,deathbymarblz,2011-03-13T19:23Z,WOW you get pop-ups right away when you start downloading it... this is crap
,00whistler00,2011-03-15T03:25Z,"When you think about it guys, this could technically do some good for Crysis 2.
Like for one this is essentially a huge ass demo, so people who really enjoy it just might buy it.
Example is that I don't really want to buy this game, but after I download this I just might want to, just so I have the finished product.
If this wasn't intentional and really was a leak, so what, plenty of games have had this happen and most of the time they helped the games sales.
Either way, this situation could work very well in Cryteks favour, not to mention this is getting them extra media coverage."
,scopio,2011-03-17T22:11Z,"thx for the game but i got some bugs... when i start the game, the CRYTEK and EA lags and needs to be turned off. i changed the shader something blabla, yes, it helped but still the game isn't working good for me. dunno why :'(. 

Cant wait when the game will be released. got pre-ordered limited ed. :)))"
