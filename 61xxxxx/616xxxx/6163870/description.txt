if u didnt download gmod2011, better dont use it
it may mess ur gmod up.
note:
this is the simple patch, it just makes your gmod compatible to the updated
gmod (for example nonsteam servers u cant join anymore)
but u dont get the fixes and changes like
npcs can use crossbow,
players breath, players hold a hand to ear when listening to chat
i recommend to use the full patch
paste in ur main directory -not the bin folder in garrysmod folder
ill upload a backup for this and for the full patch, for the case u need it.
