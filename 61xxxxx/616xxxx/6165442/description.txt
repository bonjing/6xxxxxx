[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Wall St.2

Right ......this was a pain in the ass :P First we ripped the dvd to avi with a small script containing
crop,resize,white balance,rgb eq,sharpness,chroma,brightness,contrast......
Now the video had several issues.....main thing the colour is fooked,way to strong and sometimes too much yellow,then
green,then red :lol: it was all over the place ,so fixed it the best we could.
Now also whilst syncing we found several spots that skipped video.....so we worked it out to be around 30 secs roughly of missing
video but apart from the big jump at the intro  the rest was like 2-4 secs here and there,which made it harder to sync.
The audio was our own line but not the best we've had ......had some loud buzzing in the background.
So we synced the audio up first to the video and then we dropped it in adobe audition and ran some noise/hiss reductions over it.....tried to 
filter the worse parts more but you'll he a drop in the audio now and again.
Anyway done the best we could folks.....can't do any better :P

Oh also forgot to say ,the source files is cropped badly across the bottom and left hand side.....the AR slightly changes aswell due to some camera
movement but you can hardly tell as it was only a few pixel top and bottom we had too crop.

Enjoy folks
