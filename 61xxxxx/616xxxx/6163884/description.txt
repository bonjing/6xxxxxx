Intro

The first option we're providing for download are Flash video files, which are a quick download and provide pretty good quality. We'll be providing full, DVD quality files soon, but the download time on those will obviously be a lot graeter. If you're just wanting to watch Longevity offline on your computer at home in a similar quality to the video on the website, and not worried about burning it and watching it on a large screen TV, then the Flash video option is ideal.

How to Play Flash Video Files

To play the Longevity Flash video files we recommend you download VLC Player. They wont play as standard on Windows Media Player nor, I believe, Quicktime for the Mac so you may run into trouble playing them otherwise.
