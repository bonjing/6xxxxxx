,damncrow,2011-02-13T02:50Z,"The included EXE is from Update 1.02 released by ViTALiTY.

The installer of this DLC force feeds you the 1.02 update, so, yes, you need to copy over the cracked 1.02 EXE again.

,tscardino,2011-02-26T06:58Z,"Nevermind, figured it out. For anyone that wants to know: Run the installer, run giveme2entitlements.exe, copy MassEffect2.exe over to Mass Effect 2 > Binaries and viola."
