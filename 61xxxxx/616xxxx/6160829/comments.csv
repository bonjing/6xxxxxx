,moonrunner99,2011-02-09T12:55Z,"very cute girl, but I have a question based on the previews... Is her head stuck like that? It looks like she has a permanent crick in her neck forcing her to keep her head turned to the lift while looking forward. not just that, she has the exact same smile in every picture (of the previews anyway) It's almost as if they took one picture of her head and then pasted it on a bunch of pictures of some other girl (I am not accusing them of that, it's just how it looks.) 

Of course I am still going to download it. Thanks for the upload SplashPt"
