Remember!  SEEEEEEED!!!!"

IMPORTANT - READ ME!!!!!

If you guys want, I can put up the ripped DVDs with no compression.  When I say ripped & not compressed, I mean the only thing done to them was to remove the copy protection.  Their sizes are as follows:
Disc 1: (Part 1 Disc 1) 7.31GB
Disc 2: (Part 2 Disc 2) 7.40GB
Disc 3: (Part 2 Disc 1) 8.13GB
Disc 4: (Part 2 Disc 2) 7.80GB
Disc 5: (Part 3 Disc 1) 7.58GB
Disc 6: (Part 3 Disc 2) 7.40GB

Comment & let me know ASAP, as if nobody wants them, I'm probably going to burn them to 4.7GB DVDs & delete the original rips.

Correction.
Disc 3: (Part 2 Disc 1) is 7.57GB

Also, these are the English DVDs from Funimation, not the original Japanese ones.  They do have the Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles though.
