A full-fledged street documentary DVD, AS IS has produced some impressive street pictures over the years: from the "The Real Rick Ross" featuring and documenting the real Freeway Rick Ross to AS IS' Black Mafia Family documentary showing the rise and fall of the BMF crime enterprise to the Flukey Stokes DVD documenting the flashy Chicago heroin druglord who ruled with a reign of violent terror.

This DVD is their much-anticipated PABLO ESCOBAR story, documenting the life & times of the infamous Columbian druglord whose life started in the slums of a city of Rionegro, Columbia and ended on a rooftop in Medellin, Columbia after an instensive manhunt for the wanted kingpin.

DESCRIPTION FROM THE PRODUCER: Pablo Escobar turned cocaine into business. During his drug reign he controlled 80% of all the cocaine smuggled into the United States. He was listed in Forbes Magazine as the 3rd richest person in the world with a net worth in excess of 3 billion dollars. He was one of Columbia's founding members of the Medellin cartel and he ruled with an iron fist. Escobar killed Police, Judges, Lawyers, Military personnel and anybody who stood in his way. Escobar is credited with the "Columbian Necktie," slicing a victim's throat and pulling their tongue through their throat. He was a man intent on not dying the way he was born: Poor. With all this, escobar is still considered a saint to some. He helped this countrymen by buying homes, fixing soccer stadiums an re-building neighborhoods. These actions have fueled debates both casting him as a devil and as an angel. AS IS brings the story allowing you to decide. Watch this incredible story and witness the mentality that continues to dominate today's illegal drug trade.
