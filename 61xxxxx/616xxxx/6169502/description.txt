* Tim Roth as Dr. Cal Lightman, is a genius psychologist with an expertise in body language and predominantly microexpressions and founder of The Lightman Group, a private company that operates as an independent contractor to assist investigations of local and federal law enforcement through applied psychology. Though often confronted by people's skepticism, Lightman uses any psychological technique he deems necessary to reach the truth, however elaborate or confronting. He is divorced, and has shared custody of his teenage daughter. He cares deeply about Gillian Foster, and there is a chemistry between them that has yet to develop into anything more, although in the third season finale he confesses that he loves her (to his daughter). His mother committed suicide while he was still young, an event that led him to discovering and researching microexpressions. There is evidence he was involved with British Intelligence. Lightman also mentioned interrogating IRA members, going as far as admitting he was fooled by a suspect's facial expressions that caused the murder of three people in a pub shortly after the interrogation. He has also admitted to being an MI6 intelligence agent during the Yugoslavia Wars in 1994 in an attempt to gain the trust of an intelligence agent that he was interrogating. The character is based on Dr. Paul Ekman, a notable psychologist and expert on body language and facial expressions at University of California, San Francisco.
* Kelli Williams as Dr. Gillian Foster, Dr. Lightman's colleague and co-worker in The Lightman Group. Her husband's lack of candor often challenges her open pact with Lightman: not to let their professional skill interfere with coworkers' personal lives. So, when Cal believes her husband, Alec, is cheating on her, he simply ignores what he is seeing, much to Torres's dismay. It is later revealed that he was not, in fact, cheating on her, but was trying to overcome his drug addiction. Gillian had adopted a baby (Sophie) who was eventually returned to the birth mother. This character is based on Dr. Maureen Oâ€™Sullivan, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of San Francisco.
* Brendan Hines as Eli Loker, initially an employee of The Lightman Group. Loker is academically educated and acquired his skills in "reading" people through practice. During season 1, he also adheres to Radical Honesty, and thus rarely lies, even if that makes him appear rude or undiplomatic. Lightman demoted him to an unpaid intern after, despite Foster's warnings, he divulged sensitive information to the SEC while working on a case. However, he is later promoted to vice president, which puts a rift in any developing relationship between him and Torres (the two had slept together once).
* Monica Raymund as Ria Torres, an employee of The Lightman Group, and a protegÃ© of Dr. Lightman's, who was recognized as a "natural" while she was still working as a TSA agent. Torres was abused as a child, a common pattern among naturals. Though talented and loyal, she lacks academic training and sometimes lets her emotions cloud her judgment. She has a half sister who is in juvenile prison.
* Hayley McFarland as Emily Lightman, Cal Lightman's teenage daughter. She is under shared custody between her parents, and though she does not appreciate her father's ability to "read" her, she does not deny its merit for social screening. She shows a talent for "reading" people, like Foster and even her father. She has had a few boyfriends over the series that her father frequently scrutinizes. (Recurring Season 1, Regular Season 2-)
* Mekhi Phifer as Ben Reynolds, an FBI agent who is assigned to and assists the Lightman Group in their investigations, offering armed assistance and practical insights. Reynolds doesn't always agree with Lightman's ways, but stands behind them the majority of the time. (Recurring Season 1, Regular Season 2)


Enjoy.
