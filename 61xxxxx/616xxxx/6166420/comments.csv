,mjabba,2011-02-14T13:23Z,Thanks for this
,JockJr,2011-04-24T02:03Z,Thanks for the download...but I don't know how to make it work in Juicer. I have a Mac. I have AE but uses FCP more. How can I use it in Mac and esp. in FCP. Can you guide where to plug them in? Pleas make explanation simple. I am no a computer savy. Thanks.
,db0707,2011-04-28T19:56Z,"Awesome, thanks for the download.  Anyone that is wondering, Juicer is not needed.  This download has AE project files and source files."

,maxkagen,2011-10-14T18:30Z,"Great Upload and Thank You.  How do I import ""project"" files into vegas ?   This will work with Vegas Pro correct?  I can see all of the vid files..  But no project files that Sony reads.   I may be missing something, And Thank You in advance for your time."
,maxkagen,2011-10-14T19:00Z,Will this work with Vegas 9?  How do I import the project file?  Vegas doesnt seem to recognize. Could be just me.. And Thank You in advance for your time..  Great Upload regardless :)
