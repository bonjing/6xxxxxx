|   In this, their fourth studio album, Something For Kate present their       |
|   most polished offering to date. The Official Fiction is musically a        |
|   natural progression from 2001.s release, Echolalia, seeing the band        |
|   produce a record comprised mostly of accessible rock.n.roll songs, with    |
|   the band expanding the simple formula by experimenting with additional     |
|   instruments to expand their three-piece sound (some songs on the record    |
|   see the band performing with as many as eight pieces). There is a          |
|   consistent depth of harmony on this album that for better or worse sets    |
|   this apart from the band.s previous releases, and is the result of both    |
|   the expanded instrumentation present on many of the songs, as well as a    |
|   product of carefully layered vocal harmonies (many of them multitracked    |
|   by singer/guitarist Paul Dempsey, ranging from simple harmony lines to     |
|   singing counter-melodies across his own vocals) alongside the presence     |
|   of three acclaimed vocalists as guests; Lisa Germano, Caitlin Cary of      |
|   Whiskeytown, and Grant Lee Phillips of Grant Lee Buffalo. Fans of the      |
|   band will notice an immense shift in sound between this release and        |
|   earlier efforts such as 1997.s Elsewhere For Eight Minutes.                |
|                                                                              |
|   Stylistically, the shift away from guitar oriented songs and toward more   |
|   cohesively orchestrated compositions places the focus of this record on    |
|   layered harmonies. While the vocals of Paul Dempsey have always been in    |
|   the spotlight, this shift in musical emphasis means that the album         |
|   highlights them more than ever, and as a vocalist this record is           |
|   arguably the best work of his career. Paul.s strong voice is often a hit   |
|   or miss affair for listeners of the band due to its unique sound and       |
|   texture, though as this album demonstrates, there is no question of his    |
|   pitch, control, and ear for harmony.                                       |
|                                                                              |
|   The two songs featuring Lisa Germano (Light At The End Of The Tunnel and   |
|   Reverse Soundtrack) are the least densely orchestrated of the album,       |
|   with violin and cello being the only additional instruments. The slowest   |
|   paced songs on the disc, these tracks leave the vocals prominent and       |
|   isolated over subtle musical backgrounds, with the instrumental parts      |
|   panned and arranged to create subtle soundscapes rather than the strong    |
|   progressions heard on the majority of the other tracks, which are          |
|   typically moderately paced rock.n.roll songs such as the country-rock      |
|   influenced single Moving Right Along, and the more driving rock song       |
|   Asleep At The Wheel, which sees the band performing in their more          |
|   familiar three-piece setting, throwing the focus back on Paul.s guitar     |
|   work and the absence of guest vocalists leaving him to perform his own     |
|   harmonies (particularly notable in the bridge). Fans who preferred the     |
|   sound of Echolalia will most likely gravitate to this track, while songs   |
|   such as Souvenir provide a happy medium between the more fully             |
|   orchestrated songs and the driving three-piece rock sound, keeping an      |
|   upbeat, guitar driven feel while tastefully arranged violin and cello      |
|   tracks provide subtle colouration.                                         |
|                                                                              |
|   The majority of songs in the albums fit inbetween the two ends of the      |
|   spectrum described above, typically being moderately paced,                |
|   conventionally structured rock songs featuring the band.s usual guitar,    |
|   bass and drums with the addition of keyboard and occasional strings to     |
|   thicken the harmonies and add depth and density to the songs. This style   |
|   is well represented in the three other singles released from the album,    |
|   DÃ©ja VÃº, Song For A Sleepwalker and Best Weapon. The first single from     |
|   the album, DÃ©ja VÃº is a definite stand-out track, fitting a great deal     |
|   of dynamic variation and musical content into the form of a radio          |
|   compatabile rock song. This track builds to be, along with                 |
|   Kaplan/Thornhill, one of the most densely orchestrated songs on the        |
|   album, seeing the band effectively perform as an eight-piece when joined   |
|   by four-piece string ensemble The Section. Lyrically, the album is         |
|   consistent with the Paul.s previous work, giving his own individual        |
|   observations and impressions of things, whether they are introspective     |
|   or social in nature. The album features three tracks; Best Weapon,         |
|   Letter To The Editor and No Man.s Land that are very reflective of the     |
|   social environment at the time the album was written. No Man.s Land is     |
|   of special note because it features the great guest vocals of Grant Lee    |
|   Phillips, whose voice works very well with Dempsey.s, adding a little      |
|   extra to the album closer, which sees the band finish the record with      |
|   another more stripped back rock.n.roll song, fading out over a jam outro   |
|   that recalls the outro to Twenty Years from their previous album.          |
|                                                                              |
|   Overall, the album is a well written and well produced collection of       |
|   melodic rock.n.roll songs. The record doesn.t have quite the same level    |
|   of variety in song styles as previous efforts such as Echolalia, though    |
|   a level of diversity is maintained instead through a good deal of          |
|   dynamic variation in the songs as well as through the presence of the      |
|   guest vocalists and string players. The production on the album deserves   |
|   special mention, as the often densely layered sounds are carefully         |
|   arranged, especially when it comes to the many guitar overdubs and         |
|   multi-tracked vocal harmonies present on a number of the songs. The        |
|   Official Fiction was recorded in Mangrove Studios in Sydney, with          |
|   production by Trina Shoemaker. The Section were recorded at Quiet Street   |
|   Studios in Los Angeles, with additional recording at Sunset Studios.       |
|                                                                              |
