Imagine being terrified to stay in your own home. Thatâ€™s what Caroline says she lives with day in and day out. Despite two guard dogs, a first-rate security system and a panic button she keeps on her always while at home, she canâ€™t let go of the fear. What has her so frightened? Find out why Dr. Phil says he can have her completely cured in just days. Then, Steve has had 47 plastic surgery procedures and is aiming for a record breaking 50th.

Learn why Lisa says she embarked on this â€œsocial experimentâ€ and whether sheâ€™s met any potential candidates yet.
