I have the dvd and it looks better then this faked AR rip. 
I love this movie and thought wow 720p BluRay, let's give it a try.
I'm very disappointed. 
This is probably the third fake 720p ""bluray"" rip I downloaded from BOZX.
When will people learn that faking the AR won't do any good but harm.
I'll think twice before download a 720p in the future."

Stupid of me not reading the description saying this ""720p bluray"" has 384 KB/s AC3."
