    When a bus-load of women's college soccer players get stranded on        
    their way to a bikini car-wash fundraiser, they decide to set-up shop    
    in front of an abandoned gas station on the edge of town. Little do      
    they know the place is the stalking-grounds for a homicidal maniac       
    mechanic named Moe.
