[T],MARCELODRGZ,2011-02-09T16:32Z,"Thanks! Did you know that WMA is superior to MP3? I'll try to explain why ...
 WMA encoded better than MP3. An example is that a song encoded at 96 kbps WMA is almost the same quality as an MP3 at 160 Kbps This means that the WMA format is smaller than the MP3 format. Then try listening to the same track encoded at 320Kbps WMA and MP3 320Kbps in one speaker to full volume and you will notice the difference quickly. Greetings!"
