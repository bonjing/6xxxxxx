
I used this on my Proper-Razor1911 version of borderlands and it worked like a charm.
Don't know (and don't care) about other versions.


These files contain the following:

- DLC: The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned
- DLC: The Secret Armory of General Knoxx
- DLC: Claptraps New Robot Revolution
- Patch: Version 1.4.1


Simply unrar and copy the folders to your \2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands folder.

Overwrite all.

Play the Game.
