,freeworkman3,2011-02-11T17:29Z,Is there anyone that is going to mix the english audio to the russian dvd? Or is it not needed and the workprint actually not missing any of the special affects?
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-02-11T17:42Z,"Again, cheers for the heads up on the source info..... Good work!"
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-02-11T17:48Z,I tried all day yesterday with the two sources before upping them. But it looks like there would be a big amount of work to do. Maybe a big RG could manage it - but not me :(
,pa8os,2011-02-11T19:25Z,thanks.....

Couldn't get the audio to work on WMP so I used VLC and it was worked perfect...
Decent Horror spoof...
Many Thanx to SAFCukO09 for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a fast download...:)"
,ManLemon,2011-02-13T14:49Z,"Good copy for sure. Perhaps needs some audio normalisation here and there. Has a glitch or two and random text (look like notes for the SFX team).
But all in all a good copy of a film that hasn't found a proper release even though it's over a year old."

,ISGIBTY,2011-02-16T17:08Z,"Could not get the audio to work on Quicktime or VLC.

Downloaded the A52 codec (for Quicktime) from http://perian.org/ to solve it. "

Score based on what it is in the production phase. It was funny as hell and Can't wait for them to get a company to pick them up so they can put it in Theaters. I'll buy it as soon as it comes out on DVD."
,passwordx,2011-02-17T12:59Z,"Thanks for the torrent.  I have tried using VLC with XP and 7 Ultimate and no audio/sound. Video is perfect.  Any suggestions, I have downloaded twice due maybe a corrupt file. Second download no sound. Thanks for any suggestions."
,tonym2112,2011-02-17T16:00Z,This movie is funny as hell. Thanks SAF! Perfect copy. Played on VLC with no problem
,ramboryan,2011-02-19T14:57Z,"great movie i think they should keep it without the effects made for funnier viewing.

worked great playing off WiiMC on my Wii so not sure why Kharvs ps3 is buggering it up!
worked great on WMP and on VLC only thing i can suggest to them with audio problems is to download a codec pack"
,passwordx,2011-02-20T02:49Z,Thanks for the torrent  V=9.5 A=10 .. I have never had any issues of playing any torrent video's using the VLC free download media player. VLC many times will play a partial download and has never failed to play a torrent video and some times play's the fakes
,DaveModer,2011-03-03T17:01Z,"Sg. is wrong with the audio. My DivX HD certified DVD player plays it, but stops at every 10-20 seconds. I have a friend, and he told me that on his PS3 the audio gets out of sync after a while. The movie can only be played with VLC on the PC.... weird. I'll wait for a better quality or fixed version. I recommend to others also because the movie seems to be quite good after watching the first 10 minutes."
,Chaos696,2011-03-06T11:55Z,"its not an AVI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its a mkv file....unable to watch except if u convert it
4/10, write it in the description moron"
,EP91GlanzaV,2011-03-22T02:44Z,"Didn't notice this was a workprint untill I saw it, but still a pretty damn funny movie! Good quality as well, thanks for the upload."
,lilleza87,2011-03-26T02:01Z,"@Kharv, that happened when I tried to play it on the PS3 too, not sure why though. Like you said it's just this movie."
,udrf,2011-04-11T06:33Z,"This is a great movie and because of that I don't recommend downloading this torrent. The quality of this torrent is fine but the problem is that this is a work-print, i.e. an unfinished version of the movie. Special effects have yet to be added to many scenes, sounds are wonky and there is generally a fair bit of polishing left to do on this copy of the movie.

If you decide that you can't bother waiting for the finished version of this movie then it plays best in the latest version of VLC."
,Daky101,2011-04-23T14:40Z,Can I watch this on X360?
,Daky101,2011-04-24T21:05Z,"Thx,I figured it out,nice upload."
,Painweaver,2011-10-12T22:49Z,"Audio: 10
Video: 10 
These ratings are based on the fact there is no special effects and not a finished copy of the movie.  I found watching a movie in this stage interestingly unique and an average land based dweller.  Most movies probably wouldn't be as good but this one is down right funny.  (Yes I mean heehaw hilarious funny)"
