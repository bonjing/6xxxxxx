I'm the developer of Caliander trying to make a living be developing software that people like. So if you do enjoy Caliander, please buy it at the Mac App Store! 

There is a free 30 day trial at the website that I recommend instead of this pirated version.

Enjoy!"

I have bought a lot of the torrent you see here, because I use them - some I just delete, they are useless.

If I like BusyCal - expect an email from me wanting to buy it!
