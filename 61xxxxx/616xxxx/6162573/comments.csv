,dsm1th,2011-02-10T23:54Z,sorry dls. i had the same problem with this as disc 4. so my upload has restarted all over again. sorry for the delay.
,i6X9i,2011-04-10T21:30Z,"Disc #3 seems to be the slowest to download of the the 4 discs.  Please seed.  Most of the time I'm getting 0.5 kB/s or nothing at all, which is pathetic.  This is taking me weeks, leaving my computer on 24/7.  And I'm still not done yet (at 84.7% at the moment.  I'll help with the seeding when I'm done.  Please help.

Street Hawk Rocks!  Too bad they don't have shows like this anymore."
,i6X9i,2011-04-14T17:26Z,"Please seed this one.  Please.  Please. Please.  A lot of people cannot pass 98.6%.

Anyone with completed files?  Help us out.  Try to share/seed just for a few hours more or so.  Please.  For the love of God...  "
