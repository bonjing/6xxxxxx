,Lil-Te,2011-02-10T19:29Z,"Does This Mean That The Video Format Is ""Blu Ray"" ............??????"
,Lartzzz,2011-02-11T13:27Z,"@Lil-Te

No, Blueray would be the source, and the video format would be x264, just as it says:
Bitrate....: x264@4743 Kbps"

Dont post useless comments unless you know what you're talking about you dumb fuck. 

100% real. If you have issues running it download VLC player or google it. Dont ask for help on a forum!"

dutch subs for this one and this uploader http://www.ondertitel.com/ondertitels/info/Faster/53548.html"
,Lexer79,2011-02-20T18:45Z,I'm objective.  This movie is extremely stupid. In the beginning movie is promising but only in the beginning. It does not have a story. Everything is predictable.  Acting is lame.  The contract killer and his wife are redundant. I really do not see the point putting them in movie. The name of this movie is Faster but I rather give it name Slow. I spend an hour and a half of my life watching this. I never imagined that hour and a half can be like three hours. I advise you not to spend your time on it.

,csajnog,2011-03-17T05:04Z,"New to this, thank you!  I seed to 1, is that cool?  How do you go back to find what torrent to post your comments to?  I think they would be very helpful to others."
,Sc1ZZeN,2011-04-13T07:31Z,"@imaculate  try using ""ps3 media server"" get the beta use MEncoder as your video encoder and make sure you have multicore H.264 support checked. 

they say you only need a core2duo to run it  and i think 2gb of ram.   i dunno about if it can or not im running an AMD 1100T X6 and 16GB of ram and it works great. "
