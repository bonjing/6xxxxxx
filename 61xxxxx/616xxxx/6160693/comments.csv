But those audio glitches made this upload completely unwatchable, and I am abjectly disappointed you had the unmitigated gall to not only upload this poor attempt at an encoding, but to also show that worthless face... er... alias on TPB. I am ashamed to be a member of the same species as you.

Oh wait, no, hold on. I'm pissed off that P&T are challenging my notions. Haha, never mind. Thanks for the up! ;) I can't wait for Season 9."
