The land of Israel has been the land of Israel because Israel (pre-named Jacob) was given the land by God.

Israel son of Isaac son of Abraham who was married to Sarah.

Arabs are descended from Abraham who had an Egyptian handmade (Hagar). She gave birth to an illegitimate child called Ishmael.

They were not given that land, They have no right to it."

look there are nearly  50 arab countrys ,, leave israel alone,, and let there b peace in the world ,, watch this move about iran and then talk to me,, its got nothing to do with israel"
