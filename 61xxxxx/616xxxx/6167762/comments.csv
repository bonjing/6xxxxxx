Hai, I know you are not taking any requests. SO just wanted to inform you that a new season Mr Sunshine Starring Methew Perry (Chandler Bing) Has just started. Even if you r not going to Upload it you should at least see it. the first episode was really good.
Cheers and keep up the good work"

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-11T19:10Z,"Thanks. I got -20 just on 7th Feb pack, but hey...
-120 just for latest uploads. I hope I can get even ""lower"".

@coolasad: I watched all new shows and expressed my opinion two days ago:

>""twentyforty at 2011-02-09 07:40 CET:
To all big Thanks.

@funpigj: I did watched new shows, I have the time, because I follow Castle only. So - as you said, CC looks good, engaging and I would follow future episodes. Mr. Sunshine was really bad, almost stupid. Fantastic cast, but enormously big piece of bad writing. Outcasts (I love SciFi) were ... well... a middle type of sorrow. I would watch episode two to see... """
