"Pilot"

In the series premiere episode, Teresa Colvin, 
the city's first female superintendent, lobbies 
for a city corruption task force to investigate 
Alderman Ronin Gibbons, a building-magnate-
turned-politician. Meanwhile, Colvin's ex-
partner and larger-than-life veteran of the 
Chicago Police Department, Jarek Wysocki, 
investigates a suspicious murder in Grant Park 
alongside his new partner Caleb Evers. Also in 
Jarek's charge are his niece, Vonda Wysocki; 
her hotshot partner, Isaac Joiner; and Liam 
Hennessey, an Irish thug who blends in with the 
gritty world of local crime. Together, these 
cops stop at nothing to navigate the Windy 
City's underbelly to fight crime and bring down 
Alderman Gibbons' empire of corruption.
