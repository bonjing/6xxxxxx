I would like  to replace my old files (svcd) with the new ones with higher video quality (vob)
Once I have them all completed I plan to create one BIG torrent with all of them 
So in case you missed something ,don't worry 
I will reupload all my collection again

Thanks for your help"
,aurelioz,2011-02-17T21:51Z,Thank U zlatkopupovac :) ... I spent several months with no connection
,jumpingphil,2011-02-18T01:21Z,"This part ( 282 ) and part 281 do not show up if you search for ""history of pop"".
I don't know why.
They both show up if you search for all your work ( zlatkopupovac ).

Very strange.
