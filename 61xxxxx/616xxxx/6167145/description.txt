Release Title: Hancock 2008 BRRip
Bluray Release Date: Nov 25, 2008
Certification: Rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence, and language.
Storyline: There are heroes... there are superheroes... and then there's Hancock (Will Smith). With great power comes great responsibility â€” everyone knows that â€” everyone, that is, but Hancock. Disgruntled, conflicted, sarcastic, and misunderstood, Hancock's well-intentioned heroics might get the job done and save countless lives, but always seem to leave jaw-dropping damage in their wake. The public has finally had enough â€” as grateful as they are to have their local hero, the good citizens of Los Angeles are wondering what they did to deserve this guy. Hancock isn't a man who cares what people think â€” until the day that he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), and the unpopular superhero begins to realize that he may have a vulnerable side after all.
