Here is the blue movie that parodies everyone`s favorite daytime television guru. Oprah shows you how she and Gayle like to fuck around, and here is comedic proof Oprah isn`t a lesbian. She shares her O face with the world and her audience.In the new Hustler Video parody, Oprah has a special guest on her show (James Bartholet), who tells her about a new type of diet pill. But as it goes with most too-good-to-be-true things, there`s a catch! Not only do these diet pills have somewhat of an opposite effect, but in fact they make her especially randy! So randy in fact that first the parody Oprah enjoys a little alone time in her office, before she has a three way with best friend Gayle and long time beau Stedman, and then winds up on her knees in a seedy bar with her close gal pal, Maria (Dylan Ryder), the wife of the California governor. Other famous friends of Oprah make a parodied appearance in the film as well, but seeing is believing, and that`s exactly what happens in this DVD.
