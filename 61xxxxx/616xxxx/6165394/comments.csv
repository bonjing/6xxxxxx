[T],qwersd,2011-02-11T14:43Z,"IF u upload stuff from AJhacks, atleast credit them for the torrent otherwise stop uploading their files.."
[T],qwersd,2011-02-11T14:47Z,"In the future, don't upload their stuff unless you credit them for the stuff.."
[T],droidip,2011-02-11T15:28Z,"yeh, some apps are from AJhacks, I will leave them credit in the future. "
,kristofl,2011-02-11T17:20Z,"thanks so much for all the great releases.
I would give you 3 large beers for doing the awesome Kaleidoscope and AppViz."
,EightLegs,2011-02-11T18:47Z,"Doesn't AJhacks do the same thing? Or is it just coincidence that they sometimes upload the same apps? I've noticed that it may differ from a .dmg to a .zip in the upload, but I didn't download so I can't really tell."
,EightLegs,2011-02-12T00:51Z,"Sorry, please disregard my earlier comment. I discovered it isn't the case."
