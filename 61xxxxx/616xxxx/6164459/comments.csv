,almightykay,2011-02-10T13:53Z,"yeah i was wrong its not a double bill, just extended, and no it isnt 'dodgy. its perfectly fine. start with a thanks next time"
,Cantankerist,2011-02-10T14:10Z,"I take it back. The show does run a little longer than usual this week. Nowhere near a double ep, and clearly the encoding on this isn't as tight as usual, but I'm downloading the same file from elsewhere and the opening is definitely S05E13."
,Cantankerist,2011-02-10T14:12Z,of course thx KayTV for posting! :)
,Cantankerist,2011-02-10T14:17Z,"(and that's if Kay has taken the INTERNAL.HDTV.XVID-H as source, which I presume b/c the file size is identically large. If you've capped it yerself I apologise again!)

but kudos for posting in any case"
,fish121,2011-02-10T15:20Z,"good quality a/v.

1:06min run time.

thanks for the UP"
,hootieman,2011-02-10T18:03Z,Yep this is perfectly fine. It is weird how its an hour program and its 700 megs tho. And for a great series like this to just get an hour long series finale is just plain crap. Thank the network for taking away yet another great series
,Scazza,2011-02-10T19:39Z,"First of all, thank you so much for this! Any chance of uploading a 720p version for this special episode?"
,BostonBill,2011-02-11T03:47Z,"Thanks so much KayTV. It's going to be bittersweet watching the last episode of FNL.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news though. The show is officially over and there is no chance of a pickup in the future. A lot of the cast has moved on to other shows though, and you can catch them there. You can even get a 2 for 1 on Parenthood with Lyla and Vince."
,mwalsher,2011-02-13T00:24Z,"For what itâs worth, TV show episodes that are about 60 minutes without commercials are, by convention, 550MB (not 525MB as one would expect); 700MB is reserved for movies ~90 minutes."
,Angelous_1985,2011-02-20T10:00Z,is it real..?
,TedLilly,2011-03-31T04:16Z,thanks for the up 
,trelawney,2011-12-25T14:13Z,Thanks a lot
