the star power is infinite (well for me it is)"
,chicao,2011-05-08T17:24Z,i'm sorry to ask but is this for ps2 or can i play it on my pc?
,n00b_king,2011-05-08T20:39Z,both i use my PS2 but with a emulator you could play it on PC
,chicao,2011-05-09T01:00Z,"thanks, btw is it pal or ntsc?"
,n00b_king,2011-05-09T01:06Z,NTSC i think
,MrPirate8,2011-05-18T10:21Z,Do I need a guitar for pc or can I use my keyboard when using the ps2 emulator?
,Shadowarrior666,2011-05-21T08:39Z,"n00b_king, about the glitch, it's sad but when i did this hack i tried many and many times to remove this glitch but i couldn't. Some songs work fine and the star power ends normally, but others i don't know why but the star power is infinite, i think that probably the problem is with the ""chart"".

Anyway, i hope you're enjoying the game."
,n00b_king,2011-05-24T22:51Z,"i am enjoying it :)

,n00b_king,2011-05-29T05:45Z,"well can your PS2 play back up games?
