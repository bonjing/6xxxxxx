Plot outline:
During the Victorian era, stingy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge, who hates Christmas, loses his partner Marley on Christmas Eve. For seven years, he runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit, and spends a bitter treatment to his family and acquaintances. However, that particular Christmas Eve he is visited by the doomed ghost of Marley who reveals that three spirits will visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his miserable youth; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. The question is, can or is he willing to change ?
