        Graham McGahan is a cop - self-centred, disenchanted and afflicted 
        with tinnitus. After violent murders rock the local community, McGahan 
        is sent to man a police information van in a suburban shopping strip. 
        As he starts to engage with traumatised locals, he learns to come to 
        grips with his role as a cop and a man. But terror has a way of finding 
        the most vulnerable amongst us, and NOISE shows us we are at our best 
        when the worst occurs.
