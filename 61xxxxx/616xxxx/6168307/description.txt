     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Series following a year in the life of the most southerly
      islands of the Outer Hebrides, off the north-west coast of
      Scotland. It's Father John Paul's first big test as he settles
      into life on Barra. His boss Bishop Joe arrives from the
      mainland to assess the new priest's progress. Meanwhile, the
      newcomer gets an extraordinary gift from one of his more
      eccentric parishioners, and Father Roddy's housekeeper Sandy
      begins a project which she hopes will help families from all
      over the world trace their Scottish ancestry.
