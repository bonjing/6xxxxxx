It's Valentine's Day on the ranch, and host Alison Sweeney ushers the contestants into a room full of chocolate candies for a holiday-themed temptation. Whoever eats the most chocolate will have the option to trade two players on their team for two players on the other - or to keep the teams the same, and the winner will be a secret. But as teams are divided into red vs. black, the winner's choice causes upset in the house. Later, a five-part relay race challenge tests the players' endurance, speed, agility, strength and knowledge. Trainer Jillian Michaels takes one contestant horseback riding, and one team gets to enjoy heartwarming videos from home before a weigh-in results in a Biggest Loser record being broken and another player heading home.
