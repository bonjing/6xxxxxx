Plot:

Five strangers trapped in an elevator realize that one of them is the Devil in this
thriller from director John E. Dowdle (Quarantine) and screenwriter Brian Nelson
(Hard Candy, 30 Days of Night). The first installment of "The Night Chronicles," a
film series in which up-and-coming filmmakers bring to life stories conceived by
M. Night Shyamalan, Devil opens to find five Philadelphia office workers filing
into the elevator of an inner-city office building. But a typical day at the
office takes a sudden detour into terror when the elevator becomes stuck between
floors, and the passengers discover that the Devil does exist, and he's standing
right before them. As emergency workers work frantically to free them, secrets are
revealed and the passengers realize their only hope for survival is to confront
their darkest sins in front of the others.
