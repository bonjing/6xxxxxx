,d-pad,2011-02-12T09:28Z,"@ JJ911: ...in your opinion. and how many of us care about that?


thanks eztv!"
,neolectric,2011-02-12T11:26Z,"thx to seeders etc.  gotta agree, this season is crap compared to 1 & 2."
,mandarp,2011-02-12T12:15Z,Post 2010 this season does suck. This entire Mortis arc is dogshit.
,d-pad,2011-02-12T12:39Z,"compared to the last season, i do have to agree - season 3 can't compare... but it's not total crap, the ventress/nightsisters story arc was pretty cool.

and whatever anyone says, it'll always be better than the worst portions of the prequel trilogy films (which imo would be improved greatly by george lucas releasing a special edition that completely removes haydn christiansen and replaces him with annakin from the animated clone wars!)"
,mandarp,2011-02-12T13:22Z,"I did not like the ventress/ nightsisters arc either, everything that came before 2011 was just okay :("
,DemonsDeath,2011-02-12T17:42Z,"This season is awful compared to 1&2 but this is typical Locus trying to explain everything.

Far as this Star Wars 3D worst ideal ever, He could just film the 3rd set of movies  as promised."
,BikeSter1476,2011-02-12T19:30Z,Thanks
,Snicfritz,2011-02-13T00:10Z,I can't believe you fags have such a lonely life that you feel the need to shit talk a tv show that you're fucking illegally downloading. It's the height of irony. Morons. Download it......watch it...rate it. No one gives a shit about your half ass virgin opinions. 
,michaelsammler,2011-02-17T14:02Z,"Thank you Snicfritz. This is a torrent site, not IMDB. Season 1 and 2 had good and bad episodes, and EZTV delivered regardless. 
Thank you EZTV, and those who keep seeding."
,siandliz,2011-02-18T19:12Z,"snicfritz

Totally agree"
,SerSpec-V,2011-02-20T05:31Z,"We can talk about how this season is because not all of of illegally download this, some of us watch this on TV and I pay for cable so I'm not stealing anything because I have already paid for it.  Now immature moronic comments aside, I agree that is by far the worst season and have been thinking that since 1st episode. I keep hoping it will get better, but I don't know what the writers are thinking. "
,michaelsammler,2011-02-25T10:40Z,"No, SerSpecV, this is not the place for sporting your speedo opinions. This is for the quality of the download, reliability, and technical info related to torrents. 
Go to imbd and join the million of other pin headed opinions on what is ""good"" or not. Paying for cable does not turn this sight into a free for all amateur critic hour. "
,HerstjoriN,2011-03-26T02:14Z,Rock on thanks EZTV as per usual - best quality
,MarkoOhNo,2011-04-13T06:30Z,"If you think this season sucks so much, what are you doing downloading it? Trolling tools."
