1) Molten WoW is the best private wow server (as you can see from population).
2) Registration link works."
,buddahsu,2011-02-16T06:06Z,Molton WOW sucks ass. Eternal is much better.
,ravenland,2011-02-16T22:18Z,"@buddahsu
Don't embarrass yourself posting about your poor little organization. Population and choice of players speaks for itself. Now go back to your little cave and live with the fact Molten annihilated little organizations and communities like you and dominates private server world since it's creation."

Hello friend,can u please explain some things to me,cause im a newb :),
1st)Does This Include The Bruning Crusade?
2nd) How can we install cataclysm after this?
3)Ty for your lovely torrent!"
,ravenland,2011-02-23T19:01Z,"@Liman_Bot

Hello,

1) Yes. This includes The Burning Crusade also.

2) Cataclysm is not supported by private servers (except some poor Chinese servers which allow connection to it and horribly bugged content that resembles another game more than World of Warcraft). If you still want to update this torrent to Cataclysm, start the game and type in your Battle.net account at login screen, and it will start downloading the Cataclysm from Battle.net. Once again, it's not supported by private servers which offer near-retail Wrath of the Lich King experience.

3) You are welcome."
,Liman_Bot,2011-02-23T22:11Z,"@ravenland

Thank you for your response,however i still have a few questions :)

1st)Can i play The burning Crusade,Just the burning crusade with this torrent
2nd)thank you,again!"
,ravenland,2011-02-24T00:58Z,"@Liman_Bot

No. All accounts are automatically created as Wrath of the Lich King when registering on Molten. When I said ""Includes all Classic, Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King"" I meant that it includes all game content.

But If you download ONLY Burning Crusade client and search for some Burning Crusade private servers then you can. There are very few and very low populated Burning Crusade servers. Everyone is playing Wrath of the Lich King right now."
,Liman_Bot,2011-02-24T08:34Z,"@ravenland

thank you,i just started playing on the server,and it's fun!,ty very much!

if i have an questions i will ask them until
happy gaming and thanks once again!"
,KiraPhusion,2011-02-25T12:03Z,"Curious. What software do you use to emulate your own server? I was thinking about offline play? (I know it may sound stupid for some, but I don't mind trying the game by myself, and I have horrible internet connection, so)."
,Castayr,2011-02-27T08:02Z,if your looking for a blizzlike server with 1x rates more working content id suggest http://astralwow.info/
,Patrick71421,2011-02-27T20:38Z,"Go Molten WoW!!!



p.s.  the download is taking forever"
,devueh,2011-03-05T15:37Z,I hope you all know you can download the game clients on the official wow website and patch it if you have an account ... 
,ravenland,2011-03-05T22:09Z,"@devueh

No. This download is the most convenient standalone Wrath of the Lich King download worldwide. Official downloads force-patch too high to Cataclysm (4.0.3) and players are unable to play Wrath of the Lich King 3.3.5a on private servers if so.

Basically this download is the only and easiest way to experience ""Old Azeroth"" again."
,djordje22,2011-03-07T06:47Z,"hey just some questions.
do i need to install the classic wow and add this or does this include all the content."
,ravenland,2011-03-07T11:18Z,"@ djordje22
It includes all content. This question was already answered above."
,kennyv94,2011-03-15T05:24Z,Yeah! Can't wait. Just less than 2 days for this to download. These comments are satisfying to read. Good to know it runs well and complete. Thank You All!
,WayneMatt,2011-03-15T14:39Z,"Ravenland,

I'm here to correct you. It's not the ONLY way to install, but yeah it's the easiest way to install.

But certain countries have Internet Service Providers that limit torrent speeds (mine was like... less than 10kB/s) So I had to install this using Blizzard downloader, till ver. 3 or something, then manually patching until 3.3.5a :X heh. Still works fine! "
,groove420,2011-03-18T15:11Z,"First off, thanks for the upload ravenland.

Problem:
When at the login screen I am prompted to enter in my email and password. (Yes I am registered at Molten).
When the game is connecting, it says ""Downloading Update"". I let it update and it patched to 4.x.x and then proceeded to download 7+ gigs of updates. This broke the game I think, as my login details were no longer recognized at all.
I have re-downloaded the game again and am getting the same problem. It is wanting to automatically download a patch. 
Can someone help with this problem?

Thanks again.


"
,ravenland,2011-03-18T16:41Z,"@ groove420

Yes you made a mistake and patched up too high. 

You should have entered Molten account name at login screen (NOT email address)."
,groove420,2011-03-19T18:35Z,"Thanks for the quick reply ravenland.
I still am unable to log in, here's what I've got.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for any help.

2) Have you activated your account? Every account is activated after you verify your email address (verification link is automatically sent to the registered email address)."

,ravenland,2011-04-03T17:13Z,"@ darkblood1986
You must register with a proper email address. Don't use a fake or disposable email as it will get rejected and you can't change your email address in future. I recommend you register a proper gmail, live or yahoo email."
,ravenland,2011-04-03T17:16Z,"@ rolosdad
This torrent download is easiest ""download, register & play"" version. 

If you have WotLK disks you must to patch up to 3.3.5a (12340), set realmlist logon.molten-wow.com, register on www.molten-wow.com, start from WoW.exe and log in with your new Molten account name. 

Since many people don't know how to do those simple steps it's easier to download this and play."

,robbhope,2011-07-15T09:03Z,"Hi, I downloaded the torrent fully, but I, like a few others, did not know that I should not have logged in with my email address, but rather my molten account.  I installed a 73 ish MB patch, and now I keep getting redirected to blizzard's update to cataclysm or something.  I cancel the enormous download of 8+ GB and I have changed my realmlist back to the molten one from the us.bnet (etc).  

Now when I reopen WoW, I type in my account name (robbhope) and i type in my password, but it says ""YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM THE SERVER.""  What the hell do I do now?

Please help.  I will be very thankful."

,BrantX,2011-07-16T12:48Z,"@xxxdj
That is a server-side problem(whatever you're trying to ask help about), whichever server you are playing on, you have to inform them of the bug, etc. Ask a GM, or contact a developer at their website about it. This torrent has no relation what-so-ever with the problem you are experiencing.

@robbhope
You probably upgraded to a higher patch. Patch 3.3.5a is what MoltenWoW supports. You probably updated past their support. When you open up World of Warcraft, check for the patch number, If it's at 3.3.5a, Check your Realmlist again, if not... Try deleteing your current WoW directory(where the game files are on your computer) and re-extract them.

Great torrent by the way! I'll seed as much as i can when it's finished! Downloading with 2.6-3.0 MB/s

Cheers!"
,xiozerkpixellll,2011-07-16T21:41Z,ok i downloaded this torrent on my laptop and it works fine on my laptop(Windows 7) ... But when i moved the files onto my new pc (xp)  ( i had to do it in 2 halfs and not into the offical WOW 3.3.5a Folder)  it just kept saying -Failed To Open Archive interface.mpq- umm can anyone help with this problem?
,Ltodemax,2011-07-16T22:50Z,"@xiozerkpixellll that means that interface.mpq isn't there. That means you didn't copy it to XP correctly.

This is a perfectly working torrent. It is free and there is no subscription for playing on a private server.

,ravenland,2011-09-01T14:04Z,"@voraxith
No. You can freely and safely play on Molten and Battle.net. Log in to this torrent with your Molten account name."
,voraxith,2011-09-01T20:51Z,"@ravenland
I just want to say that you and everyone at Molten frakking rock!!!  This is the greatest thing in the history of ever, and I'm sooooooooo grateful for this.  No more shall I be stuck to a 20 level cap with all the crappy limitations from the Blizzard free trial simply because I'm too damn broke to pay the monthly fee.  Thank you thank you thank you!  By the way, it only took me like two and a half hours to download, so I suggest upping you maximum incoming bandwidth to speed up the process a bit.  And another question, though I'm not holding my breath on this one: is there a way to transfer my character sfrom my BattleNet account to my Molten account?"
,ravenland,2011-09-02T10:08Z,"@voraxith
You're welcome. Unfortunately you can't transfer your character from retail account to Molten. Molten is by far largest private server and thousands of players appreciate that they can play Wrath of the Lich King 3.3.5a for free (Cataclysm is under development and they prefer not to release it early like other private servers)."
,voraxith,2011-09-04T19:35Z,"Let's just stick with Wrath of the Lich King for now...  I played Cataclysm, and I prefer WotLK better.  Yet another reason why I like Molten.  Again, thanks to all those responsible."

,ravenland,2011-09-06T10:46Z,"@User03
No, there is no alternative to Molten. Especially not those servers you mentioned which are low populated, poorly managed and full of custom items, ""VIP""s and unscripted custom bosses.

Overall, there's no alternative to Molten among servers. When retail was 3.3.5a, Molten was an alternative to retail, albeit inferior since it's a private server, although best in it's kind."
,ravenland,2011-09-07T18:11Z,"@Rockoweed
Go to https://www.molten-wow.com/features/ to see difference between realms. There are a total of 6 realms at the time of writing this.

Lordaeron x1 (exact leveling pace as on retail)
Frostwolf x3 (x3 times faster leveling than on retail)
Neltharion x12 (12 times faster leveling than on retail)
Deathwing x12 (12 times faster leveling than on retail)
Sargeras x20 (20 times faster leveling than on retail)
Warsong (Instant level 80, oriented for PvP only)

For example on Neltharion leveling to 80 can take from 2 to 10 days, depending on how many hours you play per day."

,capmoq,2012-01-07T14:06Z,"Hey guys this is your chance to play on the best Cataclysm server in Europe. No lag, no crashes!
The server is Romanian but a new international realm ""Exodus"" was opened.
This is by far the best and most superb server out there.
It's patch 4.0.6 but works with all patches (4.0.6 - 4.x.x). You can download the game from Blizzard if you want to.
PVP is working 98% and most of the Cataclysm instances are scripted.
IF you want to give this server a chance then follow this link:
wow(.)freakz(.)ro/register.php?inviter=1654
First 10 days it's instant lvl 85!!!


Here are the steps:
1) Register on the link
2) After registration go to WoW - Data - enGB - realmlist(.)wtf (open with notepad).
There replace    set realmlist xxxxxxxx   with   set realmlist wow(.)freakz(.)ro (the first line).
3) Then go back to wow(.)freakz(.)ro site and on the left panel click on ""Download Launcher"".
4) Install the launcher to the WoW folder.
5) Launch the game, log in, create a character and have fun!


It's as simple as that! My name on Exodus realm is Capmoq / Plight / Prodigy. 
Feel free to ask any question in game! See you out there ;)"

Did you verify your registration? They send email verification before account is activated. Also make sure you're not behind a firewall and your WoW can connect to the internet."

Ive never played WoW becos of the sub fee and now i can jam for free

,ewolram,2012-03-23T13:44Z,"currently at lvl. 12 playing at Frostwolf realm and loving every minute of it! ^_^

I've read tons of new people asking how to connect and play World of Warcraft for FREE. To be able to access the molten-wow realms, I've decided to make this guide, hope you find it useful.
Here are the steps:
1) After you have downloaded this torrent, create an Account at https://www.molten-wow.com. (actually u can create in advance while w8ng 4 this to finish! :D) 
2) After registering your account and verifying it by e-mail, you will need to add in your realm lists the molten-wow servers(to be able to play for FREE! :D) which can be found at World of Warcraft/Data/enUS/realmlist.wtf (open with notepad) put ONLY this 2 lines:
""Set realmlist logon.molten-wow.com
Set patchlist logon.molten-wow.com"".
4) The last step consists in entering your account information Username(NOT e-mail add) and Password u made in molten-wow website) after launching ""Wow.exe"".
5) Launch the game, log in, create a character and have fun! ^_^

and ravenland, THANK U VERY MUCH for this torrent! :D"
,woolfy69,2012-03-23T14:59Z,"@ewolram

thanks man- on 90% of downloading ^^
thanks for the steps"
,ewolram,2012-03-24T05:18Z,"@wolfy69 

ur most welcome! ^_^

btw, u also need to add ""Wow.exe"" on the Exceptions Tab in Windows Firewall! :)

it would allow access to molten-wow servers!

see all ya in game! :D

I downloadet this very same torrent once and had a problem. speed was excelent, did it in 12 hours but it got stuck on 99,9% and just would not finish. so i got pissed and just cut the download. i started the game and played on molten for about 3 days. it worked just fine. i even loged on crusade gaming to check on my old paladin there.  but when i reached lvl 63 (i think) on molten the game started to display serious bugs like: complete black screen or  showing only armor and no players, i could not see mobs or the landscape. this repeated every 10-15 mins after loging in. naturaly i think it had something to do with impropper download so i deleted it. now om downloading it again and the same thing repeats it self -.- stuck on 99,9% help please :((("

,Shadow1921,2012-04-22T07:30Z,"Ok i'll explain what this does. This is the game (wrath, burnign crusade, class) all in one. It is most likely used to make your own server (im downloading for an OLD server repack i'm using. If you wanted to play wow online, you would actually need to buy the games (all 4) to play. If you want to play for free, download this torrent, and then look for a REPACK to run it. After setting it up, it should work login with the stuff and you can play single player"
,McLyster,2012-04-23T13:56Z,"@Shadow1921
I don't think you can play this as single player. Thousands of players play this on Molten WoW so just register on www.molten-wow.com, download this torrent and log in with Molten WoW Account name."

BTW don't waste your time on eternal-wow, they fail at everything they do. Cataclysm and blizzlike 3.3.5 realms? Dead and empty. And don't make comments about it they'll be deleted, that staff only likes ass-kissers. It's always the same bullshit excuse: Molten has pro devs that they're paying. Yeah, except much lower ranked servers have successful cata/blizzlike realms. To give you an idea about how much they fail they only fixed now a major marrowgar ICC bug. The same bug that only took a few days to fix about 2 years ago on my previous server (ranked #50). Not surprising that they recently lost about 30% of their population.
So have fun on molten and forget that joke called eternal-wow :)"
,.Leto.,2012-06-25T00:13Z,"LOL @ eternal-wow once again. Genesis blizzlike realm: according to the site homepage 83 horde are supposed to be online. But when you log your character you can see that they're only 12... LOL, those idiots are even ""parking"" staff lvl80 characters to make it look like there're still some high level characters on the realm, when in reality they all already left.
Plus they just released Ruby Sanctum! Freaking amazing, we already had it on phoenix-wow about 18 months ago :D
I could have posted this on their forum but of course the comment would have been deleted.
Fucking retarded server. Fucking staff."
