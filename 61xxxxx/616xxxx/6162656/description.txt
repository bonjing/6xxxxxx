Filmed at the O2 Arena, London, UK on September 30th and October 1st 2008, Stevie
Wonder: Live at Last spurred all sorts of different emotions in me. If I recall correctly, the last
time Stevie toured Europe must have been well over a decade ago, which was also the last
time I saw him sing and play live. A lot has changed since then ~ our leaders, our country, the
world we live in. Stevie's music, however, hasn't.

A quick look at the back cover of this Blu-ray disc was all I needed to know exactly what to
expect from Stevie Wonder: Live at Last: "Part-time Lover", "I Wish", "I Just Called To Say I
Love You", "Isn't She Lovely", "Lately", these are not just some of Stevie's greatest hits, these
are some of the greatest hits of the 80s and 90s.

Stevie's singing throughout the show is relaxed, even casual. At times, it seems like he is
actually enjoying his own voice. During the breaks, he smiles, jokes and chats with the
audience, making sure that everyone is having a good time.


Contrary to what you are likely to see published online, the selection of songs Stevie
performs is very good. Opening the show is a chic intro that effectively warms up the crowd
[Stevie does a lovely bluesy piece with his harmonica]; then come "As If You Read My Mind",
"Master Blaster [Jammin']", "Did I Hear You Say You Love Me", "All I Do", etc.

Stevie is assisted by a terrific 14-piece band, which includes his beautiful daughter Aisha on
backing vocals. Halfway through the show, she sings the powerful "I'm Gonna Laugh You
Right Out Of My Life". Earlier there is a terrific "UK medley" comprised of "London Bridge Is
Falling Down", "Fool On The Hill", "I Want To Hold Your Hand", and "Satisfaction".

"Superstition [So What The Fuss]" and "As" are the final two songs in Stevie Wonder: Live at
Last. The former gets most everyone at the O2 Arena dancing [multiple cameras zoom over
the ecstatic crowds], while the latter gives the band one last chance to shine.
