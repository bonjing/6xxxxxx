I certainly aren't complaining."

Glee was on sunday because it was the Super-Bowl lead-out program this year. =)"

,JackOfficer,2011-02-10T15:15Z,bad idea fox putting this faggy show on after super bowl...glee had the largest drop-off of viewers of any post-game show. 111 million people watched the super bowl and only 26 million kept the post-game show on. last years post game show undercover boss had 40 million viewers
,MC214,2011-02-12T13:32Z,hermyownknee you are a loser..its a 100% real episode...you are just a noob.

If you don't like than don't come to a torrent about it. You clearly think this show is 'faggy' so maybe you should stay away from the torrents and stop commenting on them. People come here to download the shows they like not to read your whiney comments about your homophobia."
