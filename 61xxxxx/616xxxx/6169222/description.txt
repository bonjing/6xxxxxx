
               WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


  Version 4.00 beta 6

  1. Bugs fixed:

     a) "Use for all archives" option in the password dialog did not work
        for several 7-Zip archives with encrypted file names;

     b) "Rename" command could fail to rename archived folders with
        non-English names in RAR archives created by old WinRAR versions;

     c) when WinRAR was running in the background, its tray icon messages
        were truncated if longer than 63 characters.
