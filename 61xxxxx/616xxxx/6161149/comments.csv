,boxorats,2011-03-22T20:05Z,"Thanks to TvTeam for the upload. I downloaded the sample - it's a TV rip with ""SKY CINEMA HD"" burned into the top right corner. The aspect ratio is cropped for HDTV. I find all this disappointing, but the fundamental problem in my view is the bad color. The color is dull and for this movie specifically that's a particularly crippling flaw. The resolution/bitrate feels more like blown-up-DVD than anything, but again, the dull color is what makes this no good to my eyes. My feeling is a DVD with good color would be worlds better. Again, thanks for the upload; I feel this is the right report to make on the video quality.

And to be clear: I put the ""-1"" Quality rating on the torrent here - a Quality rating, not a Legitimacy of Torrent rating."
