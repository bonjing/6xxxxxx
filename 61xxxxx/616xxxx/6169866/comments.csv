Love your hard work and effort to bring quality to this site! Forever grateful!"
,erabu,2011-02-12T18:09Z,do you upload your stuff to other trackers to or have a site of your own if yes where and thanks for for the good work once again
,mandipdas,2011-02-12T18:17Z,"That means, we don't have to rerun the activator anymore. right?"
,mandipdas,2011-02-12T18:18Z,I have already activated my office with the previous activator. How do I activate with this over that one?
[V],thethingy,2011-02-12T18:28Z,"mandipdas, it does.

mandipdas, if you just run the old activator the click the uninstall button, if there is one, then just follow the read me from this"
,mandipdas,2011-02-12T21:19Z,"Thanks for the reply mate. I asked all the questions before downloading. I thought that was another activator. After reading all the instructions, it becomes as clear as crystal. Just one more question though, does that phone call cost me anything or it's free? I am from India, that's why I am asking!!! :)"
[V],thethingy,2011-02-12T21:39Z,"promodsharma, its been in the comments for 6 months and worked with 2007 for 2 years so maybe not, the keys only have a few thousand call ctivations so the key will stop but the method wont.

mandipdas, its free"
,jersson,2011-02-12T22:20Z,"Is this only activator or office included. Very good , thank's"
,deepandhard,2011-02-12T23:33Z,"I tried it with both codes but both times it routed me to a live MS rep.  I know thethingy said to just lie, but I was to chickenshit to do that, I'm too paranoid and all that.  Anyway no biggie, I just used the activator and upped by thethingy a while back I was back to the 180 day cycle again.  Props to thethingy for giving us options."
[V],thethingy,2011-02-13T00:09Z,"deepandhard , I think it depends on your country, the UK you always get the auto system (well I have), just say you are reinstalling or changing from 32 to 64 or 64 to 32 as you can do that. "

,Angnima,2011-02-13T17:32Z,"You are brilliant and should have a gold medal on your skull. Your torrents are always clean and working. I activated on 2 computers without any problems.Though one question, do you think updates are possible? I had a precracked 2007 and that couldnÂ´t take updates. A blue screen was coming up telling it was not genuin. So I think it is clever to block Microsoft update and just use Windows update. For those who do not know Controlpanel-Windows update-Options. There just unclick update for Microsoft update."
[V],thethingy,2011-02-13T18:21Z,"Angnima, updates are fine, mak activation is permanent & always genuine even after the key is barred. "

[V],thethingy,2011-02-14T00:28Z,"ocdboy777, ciberfag just unpacks other torrents then reposts so his copy is larger as it's not compressed, but my one is larger than adobes as it has a load of pdf manuals for the software that you don't get with the adobe trial and it has the windows hotfixes needed if you install to server or xp64bit, all have the same features.

,gurmsin,2011-02-15T18:53Z,"This activator actually works. Just make sure to do a new install of Office 2010 first (don't try activating a previous installation). If you don't do this, you will not get your installation ID (the one long sequence of numbers in the activation window) validated. 

I've also noticed that you can only run this activator once per installation, if you don't get it right the first time, then you must reinstall Office and try again. Otherwise you will not get through. So type the correct code in the boxes when asked about it on the phone.

And yeah, finally I've got an activated Office 2010, after a long time of try and fail! :)"
,playboy_1_2_3,2011-02-15T19:10Z,Thank You Very Much thethingy...greetings from the Caribbean :) This worked perfectly...jus build the confidence to talk to the telephone rep and your product will be activated
[V],thethingy,2011-02-15T20:00Z,"You should be able to back up your activated office licence and restore it to a new install of either 32/64bit office or windows on the SAME computer by doing this;

copy tokens.dat and cache.dat from old install and save them for later on.
reinstall Install Office on same hardware.
stop the ospp service.
copy the 2 files back.
start office and change key to the one you originally used.
restart ospp service. 

That might save you having to phone again after an upgrade of windows or reformat. "

[V],thethingy,2011-02-16T14:54Z,"enjoy.dhruv, and you are following the read me?, cause the keys are valid for install and the keys are valid for the activation code, the keys should get the auto response activation code but most defiantly will get the manual authorisation code, you haven't done something daft like forget to say ""business"" and ""1 pc"" or tried to use the internet to validate have you???"

,whychelo,2011-02-17T00:56Z,"ok i'm new at this so bear with me. I'm having trouble opening the activator. Is it supposed to be an application? Because when I open it, it's just a bunch of jibberish in rich text format."
,auseryes,2011-02-17T08:02Z,"Ok so basically I HAVE to talk to a rep in order to do this at this point?  I tried both keys through phone activation and it said it could not validate and forwarded me to a rep, at which point I hung up.  I'm not much for phones, but I suppose it's the only option."

,cowidster,2011-02-19T15:09Z,"Great! But I hope there will another activation method for people like me in faraway country, Indonesia. I think this method is not easy for us here, due to phone fare, language, and other else. 
I thank thethigy for give valid code before and i have successfully activate Office 2010 pro plus in my two computers. Actually I need to activate more copy, but now I use kms activator for other computers, friend's computer. Anyway, thank u thethingy for giving us easier life."

for those using other office apps that are not part of Professional Plus then this activator works best to activate the remaining non Professional Plus apps;

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6097951

Just activate Pro Pluse with the phone thing then run the other activator with internet off, the activator will try 10 times to activate Pro Plus but will fail each time but will succeed in activating the non Pro Plus apps.


This phone thing will work with any window's/office app that you can find an old mak key for. "
,auseryes,2011-02-19T22:36Z,"I followed what Bossman said (basically needed a way to call UK, I'm in US) and it worked.  Both numbers worked.  The service you use to call only gives you between 5-6 minutes to get it done.  It cut me off a few times trying to get the activation number so you need to be quick about putting stuff in.  I used a google voice number to call the service he listed just fyi.  Thanks thethingy for the MAK and bossman for that free international calling site."
,enjoy.dhruv,2011-02-20T05:46Z,the thingy thanks for your reply.I just request you to make an easier activator which permanently activates ms office 2010.thanks again

- I have a Dell XPS laptop running Windows 7 home premium.
- i had a trial version of office on my laptop already installed when i purchased it so i uninstalled it (going to control panel and removing the program).
- i installed the ''Microsoft Office 2010 Combined Edition X64 64bit''
- when i open word it says i need to activate the product so i follow your instructions from this torrent and when i call the australian and UK number and provide them with the 6x9 installation ID it says there is an error and it wants to transfer me to an operator. i've tried more than 6 times with both product keys
- i have also tried the ''mini-KMS_Activator_v1.053'' and i just get the error stating ''the software licensing service reported that activation is required to recovering from tampering of SL service trusted store''

any ideas on what i can do. should i just transfer to an operator an lie

This is not as scary as it sounds for those of you who are afraid of being caught downloading illegal software... The rep just got on the phone.. asked for the first 6 numbers of the really long one you just got done typing in then proceeded to give me the code to type in on my computer.. then viola..

You should be able to back up your activated office licence and restore it to a new install of either 32/64bit office or windows on the SAME computer by doing this;

copy tokens.dat and cache.dat from old install and save them for later on.
reinstall Install Office on same hardware.
stop the ospp service.
copy the 2 files back.
start office and change key to the one you originally used.
restart ospp service.

That might save you having to phone again after an upgrade of windows or reformat. 

you can use one of the other activators for viso etc at the same time as this, the activator miight try to reactivate this but it will fail, I use this one for the other apps;

with the method to activate without opening a port and it tries to activate pro plus again but fails but activates everything else and when done pro + still has the permanent activation intact. "

1. Originally installed the trial version and used KMS activator.

2. Saw permanent activation and thought that would be nice so I followed the instructions, changing the key etc.

3. When I get to the part where I put in the country, I do not get an installation code or a phone number. It just says [installation code].

4. Now I can no longer renew through KMS.  When I try to useh KMS I get an error stating that the application grace period ended.

5. I deleted the key using KMS and tried again and it would not work.  No firewall or antivirus is running. 

6. I uninstalled office and downloaded thethingy's professional plus X86 torrent and reinstalled.

7. same problem as step 3

8. So I again try KMS and it still says that the trial period is over.

9. I admit that I fail.

03. Go to menu File, Help, Change Product Code, and then enter key:

828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH
 -or-
 3W3MQ-H7M6X-3WYP7-TPCH6-8G8T2

04. Untick the ""Activate over internet"" box at the bottom, and click ""Next"".

05. In the window that appears click ""Install"".

06. When finished the Install process, close word an then reopen Word.

07. An activation window will appear (if not, go to menu File, Help, Activate).

08. Select the ""Phone Activation"" option, and click ""Next"".

09. Pick your country, then ring the number and follow the instructions.

10. When asked for your ID, input the code given in the Word activation window. 

11. When asked which edition, choose business/volume use, used only on 1 pc.

12. A code will be given back, and enter the code into the activation box.

13. Click ""Next"", and Office will say that it's permanently activated.

14. Close Word (and any other Office 2010 application).

15. Restart Word, and go to Help to check the subscription status.

Note: 
- If you don't get the automated system when calling then phone back in the evening or Sunday."

Congrats on this great post.
I have a question.

If someone activates Office by using these keys which you have uploaded here, is it possible that anti piracy websites, and law enforcement agencies would be able to track the activators PC?

As one uses landline number to activate this key, then your number might record on the MS activation line?

If they have the activator's phone number, does that mean he is in lot of shite?

Please comment

Thanks"

,Zinedin,2011-07-18T17:34Z,"How the hell does this work?

The ""PERMANENTLY ACTIVATE OFFICE 2010 PROFESSIONAL PLUS.zip"" file contains only 3 URL files and 2 RTF document files.

What do I do? Just open the RTF files in Word or what? Because they are associated with Word, so...

There is no Readme file on board."
,Zinedin,2011-07-18T18:33Z,"Never mind, I got it, it's activated now. I just had to open the RTF file with instructions. From that point I was good to go on my own.

But I still think it's a very bad idea to write the instructions in a bloody RTF format which happen to be associated with MS Word by default as soon as you install Office.

So you end up, sort of, compromising the whole procedure because of that. Because Word might start communicating with some Microsoft server that would detect an illegal product key or what so ever and block it. There are software applications that do that when you try to circumvent the activation process or use irregular methods for activation, I've seen a few of these.

And yet you are telling people to disconnect from the Internet before proceeding...

Just stay away from RTF man, use simple plain text documents. Why you need RTF anyway? Just to enable some simple formatting and hyperlinking? It doesn't make sense to me. You can easily just write down the URL in a plain text document. Whenever or whoever wants to visit that page, all they have to do is copy and paste it in a browser window and hit Enter.

Otherwise everything worked very well, except for this little misunderstanding, and obviously questionable choice of file format to put the instructions in.

Keep 'em coming! Peace!"
[V],thethingy,2011-07-18T21:10Z,"Zinedin, chill dude, rtf is fine, you have to open word anyhow to put in the key, you turn off internet when reading so obviously you do that before putting in the serial. "

I live in the U.S. so I called after hours so that I would get an automated message. It wouldn't work with automated, so it wanted to send me to a customer rep. I chickened out.

I tried again later when my gf got home, she said she'd talk to someone. So I let her :p. After the automated number fail, she was redirected to some dude in India, and he asked for the first 6 numbers, and that was all he needed. Gave me the full ID key.

The first time it was all automated from Microsoft's side, and I loved the fact that MS paid for the call. The second time I got a real live person, who never even asked where I got the product, he just read the series of numbers to me and waited for me to tell him it was activated. It couldn't be any easier, and it's so ironic to get MS to help you crack their very own products, with them paying for the phone call even. Good work thethingy!"

,Brian1454,2011-07-22T20:19Z,"i used this several times on different computers and it workes great!
It does take you a while (10/15 minutes) and some effrot but it works and it eventually gives you a WORKING LEGIT KEY FROM MICROSOFT!

also, i'll spare you the download since it's just a text file:
-Disconnect from internet and start Word.
-Close activation windows if it appears and go to menu file,help,change product code (the underline text to the right) and enter key:
828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH
 -or-
 3W3MQ-H7M6X-3WYP7-TPCH6-8G8T2
-Uncheck ""Activate over internet"" at the bottom and click next.
-click ""install"", when it's done close word and reopen it again.
-an activation windows will appear, if not go to menu file,help,activate.
-select ""phone activation"" and click next.

NOTE:
it may seem scary to actually call Microsoft helpdesk but it is 100% anonymous, you do not actually talk to anyone (just a bot) and you only have to enter digits with your phone, also it is FREE (for most countires).

-pick your country, ring the number and follow the instructions.
-when asked for ID input the code given in the word activation window
-when asked which edition choose business/volume use, used only on 1 pc
-a code will be given, enter the code into the activation box
-click next and office will say it's permanently activated.
-close word or any other office 2010 application
-restart word and go to help to check the subscription status"

,Horseband,2011-07-26T07:18Z,"@dschof41

This is NOT microsoft word 2010. This is a txt file that tells you how to activate word 2010. You need to download word 2010 seperately. 

ALSO, You never never NEVER should waste discs on .iso files. This is the biggest newb mistake in the torrent scene. You mount the iso with a program like Daemon Tools, Alcohol 100%, Magic Iso, etc and your computer loads the iso just as it would if you burnt it onto a disc. There is absolutely no need to ever burn an iso to a disc."

Well... The accent identifies your mother tongue. Most often, you learn your mother tongue from the country you were born in. Most often people live their lives in the country they were born in. 
Even though it is a generalization and as such is not applicable to the absolute majority, it is neither stupid nor offensive to assume ones place of living from ones accent...

I would like to know if your permanent activator would work in downloading first the trial version in microsoft site
http://www7.buyoffice.microsoft.com/emea1/default.aspx?cache=-717092006&currency=GBP&country_id=GB&culture=en-GB

I am in UK, and when I have installed the trial version and I tried to activate it... the activation by phone is not highlighted or can't be chosen...

Does this mean that I can only use your Permanent Activator by downloading the office 2010 in your torrent site or file?

I hope you can answer since I have re-setted my laptop to factory settings a number of times aalready :D"

Installed it - followed the instructions as per the Activation Read Me - phoned the UK freephone number when prompted and got a totally automated service - no 'humans' at all.
Gave out the 48 digit code generated in Word and received another one back immediately.
Entered this into the appropriate box and, hey presto, fully activated - again, much respect to thethingy for an awesome upload :-)

He gave me the downloaded version he used 14.0.4514.1004 and I tried to install that last night [4 times]. Every time it would get to 99.999999% and finish with a ""setup has encountered an error"" and ask for a reboot.

The only problem is that the 2 product code you gave that produces the codes on the activation window is now invalid... do you happen to have another one?

I will most appreciate it since I live in UK and phone activation is easier for me
PM me the codes if you can't do it here.

thanks again"
,d4bn3y,2012-03-05T20:34Z,Nobody else is disturbed by the fact that you have to call a physical phone number in order to activate software ?? This makes me weary and def have no interest in attempting this activation method...
,skydiver1984,2012-03-06T23:44Z,"I have the 3 day activation pop up, so i then did the activation over the phone UK number followed what thethingy had i.e. 
PERMANENTLY ACTIVATE OFFICE 2010 PRO +.
The notes are based on using Word, but any other Office 2010 
application can be used (phone activation takes less than 2 minutes).

the guy told me that too many users are on this license... so for me its all bollocks"
,MoNeYFiRsT,2012-03-12T15:51Z,"The keys provided with the instructions in this torrent didn't work, so I used the one given by Xfri 3 months ago (page 24) and it worked for me and I was able to activate. Nice one."
,BKSinAZ,2012-03-17T23:28Z,"This Activator does not work. In both cases, I used one of the two product codes. I tried both. First problem, when calling in to activate, your directions say choose Business/volume (line 11). There is no option for that when calling to activate. I picked Micro Office 10 and gave all groups of numbers. Stated groups of numbers I gave were invalid."
,BKSinAZ,2012-03-17T23:40Z,Any new product codes?

,pira7e,2012-05-05T01:05Z,The ID code over the telephone didn't work. I ain't talking to no operator.
,SinesurfR,2012-05-05T03:42Z,the activation ID over telephone method didn't work for me either and the voice prompt was very enthusiastic about getting me over to an operator.  I called twice and tried to call it over by voice as well as type it in with my phone keypad.
,jahbreeze,2012-05-15T02:52Z,"doesn't work anymore, bro.  received response ""I was not able to activate your microsoft product"".  Using microsoft Office 2010 professional plus.  "
