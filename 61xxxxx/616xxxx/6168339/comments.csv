Please read: ""You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed, as this
update is featuring all previous updated content"""

I found this game to be really buggy and also couldnt get the damn thing to load!!

When you install the original SKIDROW release, make sure you tick all three boxes at the end of the install. Let it install EVERYTHING.

Install your gfx driver to latest available.

Install the UPDATE

Then it will work"
,burningbannas,2011-02-17T21:08Z,"quick question! does this download include the original game(i mean is it playable without downoading other things)? if not can someone pls leave a link to the original game downoad THANks, sorry for asking such a dimb q :D"
,didii,2011-02-18T21:07Z,"Works perfect except for online... That's a pity 'cause with version 7 it still worked...
Thanx for uploading anyhow :)"

Two of those installs (directX & dotnet) just didn't work on the original installer for me, but afterwards I found them in a folder called 'dependencies' in the install directory.... still not working, with or without crack files, with or without steam open.

What I noticed is that there's only the 'steam_api.dll' file that needs overwriting when copying cracks over. 
steam_appid and steamclient.dll dont exist in the destination folder anyway... :S


@burningbannas
No I believe it is just an update, you need the original too. GL


anyway, i'm not going to buy this without trying first, made that mistake with 'bloodbolwl... hardly made an hour out of it!"
,Lokrath,2011-02-20T03:01Z,"I'm having the same problem as lots of other people, like Vallhael. I've installed the game, checked all 3 boxes at the last stage like HTC said, I installed this update and c/p'd all the files from the SKIDROW folder, and still it won't start. It's an immediate crash. I have Vista Ultimate, and as soon as I run it (both as admin and not) it just sais ""Magicka has stopped working"".

Please, does anyone know why this is happening and what I can do to fix it? 
Thank you."
,Ratspike,2011-02-20T21:44Z,Does this work online like update 7 does??
,Infi2,2011-02-26T20:19Z,Nope :C
