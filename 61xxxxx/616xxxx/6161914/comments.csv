,fridal8,2011-03-30T22:18Z,thank you. ill do something about the missing episode.
,alice999,2011-04-04T17:58Z,Thank you thank you! I've been looking for this forever. Will seed plenty for this! :)
,Ni-aye,2011-05-11T11:08Z,"fridal8, you absolute fucking hero/heroine...

The only programme on telly worth watching at the minute, and then it's hanging around for repeats on 'Dave'.

Pity I can only get 300Kbps d/l max. gonna take bloody ages, but hey, good things are worth waiting for. Thanks very Much for a fantastic upload!"
,boris72,2011-05-21T12:36Z,"Out of 29gbs you made only two mistakes - as GVOLTT said above 7x15 is a double up of episode 16 and episode 5 (I think anyway) of the same season is a bit scrambled in the middle - and both these episodes you can get elsewhere on TPB anyway. This is a brilliant upload regardless - thank you hugely fridal8, you are an awesome pirate."

,wolf391,2011-12-05T16:31Z,"Episode G15 is as already mentioned G16 (xl)
G16 is not XL
For the missing Episode G15 turn to
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5645641/QI_Series_G_(All_episodes__mostly_XL).5645641.TPB.torrent
this one actually contain G15 Green. You find that some other possible downloads of that episode will also have that same error."

,metallic.art,2012-05-08T01:51Z,"oh my god - THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!
I'm so glad i could find a collection of S01 to S08, this is SUCH a lovely UL - THANK YOU!!
It's become one of my favorite shows, when i was in England for one year i came across it and was taken in immediately, it's such a great concept and the people are the best!

For anyone new to QI: You might be interested in seeing the Making Of, it is - wouldn't you know it - Quite Interesting!

Well, thanks again!
Greetings from Germany"
