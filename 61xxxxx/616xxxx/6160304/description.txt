George B. is a humble janitor who believes in luck and love. Ever the altruist and blessed with a kind of low key charisma, George gathers around him an odd crew of misfits who he enlists to help him restore a stately house that he owns but can't afford to repair. When he falls for a small-town Lolita, the sparks fly.
