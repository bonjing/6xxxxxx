This essay was mentioned at a popular conspiracy forum, but the link was no good, and it seemed to be deleted everywhere. But it was found in an unreadable google cache, converted to pdf and made available here at least for now. I have not read it all yet, doesn't seem to be too much, but because it "appeared" to be censored, I made a torrent for it.
Sample:
Recipe for a Nation 
 
by request 
I dedicate this Manual to the human specie , who suffered so much from its self and from 
the cruel joke called â€˜motherâ€™ nature . 
 
Please read it to the end to believe why you need to spread it . 
When the author is anonymous and no donations are asked , therefore no personal gains 
are sought , the advertising of the Recipe is done 99 % by you , the reader , as an 
unmistakable sign of understanding it as the ultimate political platform and our survival . 
No , this is not a fantasy book , itâ€™s as real as you can imagine our future . 
 
The numbers in brackets refer to each chapter web index found at the end of the book 
where relevant internet links are provided to prove that you are not dreaming .
