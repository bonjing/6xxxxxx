The most addictive flick soccer game ever. An Apple "Staff Favourite", top 10 UK app and number one sports game.
Swipe your finger to curve the ball around the wall. Itâ€™s simple to play, but a real challenge to master and youâ€™ll be totally addicted to it. Especially the new â€œThe Big Gameâ€ mode, where you have three lives and you need to score as many points as possible.
