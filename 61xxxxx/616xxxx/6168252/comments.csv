,lolocar,2011-02-12T16:43Z,I run Killswitch.exe and nothing happens? I tried running in compatability modes and as administrator.
,kornspel,2011-03-31T07:40Z,I can't pass from level 4 or so. The game crashes and screen goes black. Dunno what's the problem.
,honeyes,2011-06-06T00:42Z,"Me too @kornspel. At level four: ""Think Like A Gun"", screen goes black and level isn't load. I thought it was a occasionally bug so I tried again with a new save game, unfortunately same thing happened."

To play the next levels I figured, that u have to delete the folder named ""movie"" , located in the ""LEVELS"" folder witch is inside the game directory. Don't worry, is not that important and WORKED FINE for me.
Enjoy the next levels!"
