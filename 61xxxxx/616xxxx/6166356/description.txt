1st Jubilee Appearance

This scan turned out really nice.  I made the colors brighter and the contrast 

better. Looks better than the original source.  This was back when they still used 

the low quality paper.

I recently started reading comics again. All the comics I own are from late 

80's-early 90's and some mid-90's. I'm just kind of uploading some I think people 

would want to read.  I use a HP printer/scanner that I bought a while back for $99.

I do my best with what I have. So don't be to critical of my uploads.
