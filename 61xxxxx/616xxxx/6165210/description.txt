VaticanCity


This Bird is here already and cracked,but some people still can't get this to operate or work for them.I created full installers for this aircraft complete with all installed liveries.Works 100% on 32Bit system XP,Vista,W7.
I advise to run all Installers as admin especially Mine with crack and Liveries.This is only for SP2 users .But SP1 users can get the files from here or else where and run my crack will also work for them with all liveries included.

64Bit users may try it.It may and should also work,But I can't confirm 100% due to I don't run a 64Bit system.This is the easiest install of 767LVL-D to date including the Winglets.

Step1 Run the LVL-D767 SP2a installer.
Step2 Run the Winglets Installer.
Step3 Run my crack and liveries installer as ADMIN!!!!!!!
Step4 Run FSX say yes to all Start up ther LVLD 767 say yes to all.It may CRASH.

Step5 Restart PC Restart LVLD 767 say yes if asked.Fly if propbs rerun my installer after restart as admin again.Works perfect for me on W7

.Have Fun all



VaticanCity Easy Installers.
For 32 Bit users.
Why not Fly the Best of the BEST!!!!!!!!
For Moderate to Very experienced users FMC in use.



Level-D Simulations: The 767

With years of develpment and research, Level-D's upcoming 767 project will be one of the most amazing product releases for the Microsoft Flight Simulator platform. Designed by the same development team that worked on the famous 767 "Pilot in Command" releases, this version for FS2004 has many new features, systems, and extras to make this a quite remarkable product. It is not just a simple drop-in aircraft, but an entire suite of components that function together in order to give you the most accurate simulation experience possible.

Here are some of the newest features that are not in earlier releases from this development team... Note: Some of these items have never been seen before in a flight simulation product!

Cabin pressurization gauge & logic fully implemented.
Cabin temperature control fully implemented.
Flap load relief protection logic.
Programmation of engine failures triggered by speed (V1/V2/Vr).

Level-D Simulations 767-300 for FSX - Important Notes
Product Release Version: 1.42a (includes Service Pack 1 and 2)

Please read the information in this file including the service pack notes below. It contains important information about this product.

This Product is Configured for FSX Service Pack 2.

This product is configured for FSX Service Pack 2. If for some reason you do not have FSX Service Pack 2 installed, there is an alternate module that will allow this product to work with FSX Service Pack 1. Look in your Path_to_FSX\Modules folder for a file named LVLD.DLL_for_ SimConnect_1.zip. You will see an alternate LVLD.DLL file in this zip that will allow this product to work if you only have FSX Service Pack 1. The best thing to do is rename the current LVLD.DLL to something like LVLD.BAK, and then you can extract the SP1 compatible DLL from the zip file making sure it is in your Modules folder.

Note: In any case, this product requires FSX Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 1.

Configuration Manager and Documentation

The Configuration Manager icon is installed to the Windows desktop. Run the Configuration Manager to configure the aircraft to your preferences. See the Start> Programs> Flight One Software> Level-D Simulations 767-300> menu for program options and documentation. Adobe Acrobat Reader is required: http://www.adobe.com.

Manually Changing Language Files After Setup

French and German language files are in the Level-D Simulations\Language modules folder. LVLDGerman.dll for German and LVLDFrench.dll for French. Place either one in your FSX\Modules folder and rename it LVLDLanguage.dll. The file will provide certain language features to the product. If you remove the DLL from the Modules folder, the language will revert to English. DO NOT REMOVE the LVLD.dll file.

Optimum Display Resolution

This product is optimized for a full screen display resolution of 1280 x 960. Although not required, this setting is recommended.

New Liveries (Paint Schemes)

Aircraft repaints are available for free on the Internet. Please check http://www.leveldsim.com or other popular flight simulation web sites for free repaints. To install the repaint, use the Repaint Manager that is included with the product. A repaint template (Paint Kit) can be obtained from the Level-D Simulations web site.

Notice About Moving Files

This product has special features that require reinstallation from the downloaded E-Commerce Wrapper, should you need to move the software to another computer or make certain hardware changes. Do not move the installed product to another system. Always reinstall via the E-Commerce Wrapper.

Invalid License Error Messages

If you start Flight Simulator X, and you get an Invalid License error message, then please reinstall the product via the E-Commerce Wrapper. If you do not have access to the wrapper, or reinstall does not resolve your issue, then temporarily move the LVLD.dll module that is in the FSX\Modules folder to another folder, and contact support. You will now be able to start Flight Simulator without the error message. The Level-D 767 will not operate until the error issue is resolved.

Windows XP is Required

This product is designed to work under Windows XP and Vista. The product will not work with Windows 98/Me. The product may work on Windows 2000/2003, however it is not officially supported.
