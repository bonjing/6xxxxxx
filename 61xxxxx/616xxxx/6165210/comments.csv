,VaticanCity,2011-02-11T23:38Z,this is easy you make sure you have microsoft ditributables.2005.and 2008 doesn't hurt make sure to have a modules folder for fsuipc 4.5 or above.than run each exe. simple.ask others or did i fuck something up im not sure i never get replys back.Hope that helps .But if I don't get feed back I can't tell or fix or adjust.

Excuse me, I invite the download now, for the umpteenth time down, but when the download is finished, I'm at the end not a single file on the computer and get an error message that no files have been downloaded. I understand that no more slowly."
,mysteryfancy,2011-02-12T03:17Z,"Almighty God, command back. The torrent program was broken. Would like to make no shirt on, guys the download works fine !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bye"

,VaticanCity,2011-02-12T13:39Z,"After a small short nervous breakdown LOL, I decied I'm still here and will still help you fellow simmers.If you still have a problem.If your FSX still crashes write down your crash prob when microsoft says send to m.com ok guys.The best I can do.This should be easy by just running a exe.send all files to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X"
,mysteryfancy,2011-02-12T15:04Z,"Sorry, this is a meaningless phrase. This means making ""no disturbance"". This has nothing to do with gay and what I do in britain? But if you ever want to kill me, come to Germany and do not forget to pray ... LOL

,Flower250,2011-02-16T05:00Z,"@Vatican
HI, one question:
THe instalation works fine, and the product is installed succesfully, vbut when i get to the AIRCRAFT menu in FSX and when i choose the 767, a sign pops up saying:PANEL INITIALIZATION FAILURE, PLEASE REINSTALL THE LEVEL_D 767..
and i've done so but nothing different happens...
what can i do, this is annoying!!
the others level-d 767's from this page have the same problem!

BUT PLEASE IF YOU CAN HELP ME PLEASE!!
ISN'T THERE ANY CRACK?
thanks "
,aarque,2011-02-20T17:23Z,"So far as I can tell, it works perfectly. I get a load screen, help window and all instruments working. Currently flying it between Tblisi and Rostov-na-Donu. Only one slight issue in that I can't select GPS tracking mode on autopilot, but that may be my inability to properly utilize the FMC."
,harrydoucette,2012-03-11T16:33Z,seed please.
