WiFi Spying

Being a newbie to the realm of Network Analysis (spying) and Network Auditing (hacking), I have come to collect a few different tools, a few  of which are compiled into this torrent folder.  The contents of this folder are only for the Spying arm of Networking.  Those that are in the  situation of leeching web access from other wifi spots may need to become familiar with using these tools to best pinpoint the most optimal location to receive the strongest signal.  

If you are in a zone that only has access points that are encrypted, you may wish to research auditing signals to locate passwords, but that is your own personal choice.  Previously being in that position, I found myself downloading and burning to disc BackTrack 4, but upon trying some of the tutorials easily found on YouTube, I concluded that my integrated WiFi card did not support packet injection which is a 
necessary process for network autiting.  So then I had to spend a little bit of dough and get an ALFA AWUS036H Long Range Wireless Adapter for about $30.  I was then able to audit.
