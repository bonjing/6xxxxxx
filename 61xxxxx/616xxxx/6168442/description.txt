Agfaphoto 
digital video camera software
Microflex 102

This is the AGFAphoto camcorder that has night vision capabilities
I ordered it from Seventh Avenue for the great ... Darrell E.Curtis ... a gift for my own personal teacher in computer science:)  
It took just under four months to arrive.  I have windows 7, but installed the Vista driver on my pc since it was that or XP.  I didn\\\'t see anything for Win 7 at the AGFAPHOTO.com home site for an updated download but it doesn\\\'t seem to be a problem.  

I\\\'ve included the serial that was on the original disk

The user guide is in pdf  format
It\\\'s a great little video camera
