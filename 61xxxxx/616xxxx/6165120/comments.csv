1. Burn/Mount the image(s)

okay, one more time.

1. Download the .iso files, cracks and serials.

2. Mount/Burn .iso files with alcohol 120% or daemon tools or something.

3. Just run the autoinstall, and use serial when asked (install EADM too!).

4. Install some expensions when you want, just use serials.

5. Open Sims3Launcher.exe in The Sims 3 folder, and update all your installed games.

6. After the update (with EADM) copy the crack from all Sims 3 games installed, and replace them with the ones in The Sims 3 folders.

7. To start the game, start TS3.exe in The Sims 3 folder.

8. When there are problems, try to run program in administrator mode. Or try to shut your pc off, and put it on again.

Hope this will do it!!

,Gfurst,2011-07-03T04:20Z,"Hey man firstly thanks for the full pack. Here i have a couple of questions and one error to check with you:

-Are we supposed to install all the games, update and then copy all the cracks over? I have the base+generations running ok but wihtout the update (i guess).
-What do you mean the names are in dutch?

And for the error
-I got the Ambicions expansion first( i already have the base), it went surprisingly fast but when i try to install it says ""file* doesn't match in the setup .cab file""
then it asks to abort retry or ignore, retry doesn't work and it ask for about every file.
Also it suggests ""the medium from which you are running setup may be corrupted"", so has anyone had something similar?
My guess is that the iso file may be download wrongly( explaining the fast early download), but it never happened to me before and may be caused from a corrupt source.
Anyone experienced this?"
,Gfurst,2011-07-03T04:33Z,"Yep is definitely corrupt, I tried to open an html with an text editor after copied, and it couldn't open.
Like I said the pop up for corrupt for every file, if i just press ""ignore"" to pass through and then the setup hangs at some point.
Going to delete the supposed corrupt files and start torrent over again.

Another funny thing, i got 87% on a iso that i wasn't downloading( stuff pack), which is practically impossible. 
That makes me believe even more that there is someone seeding the corrupt file, and probably someone download from me, so beware.
BEWARE of corrupt file people, its spreads like fire and eventually trash the torrent, if you notice you have one delete every part of it and start again."
,Gfurst,2011-07-04T00:18Z,"Yep, its definitely corrupt.
I've deleted and let it download again over night, when trying to install same thin happens with the exception of a few files in the end, I also installed Late Night and World of Adventure, they went without trouble.
The game even plays ok, although any content of Ambitions show but doesn't work, even images :/

Be warned to anyone downloading.

Btw, Late night runs extremely laggy, is there anyway to improve this?"
,jojost1,2011-07-04T19:36Z,"@Gfurst:
Thanks for your comment, i'll try to answer all your questions.

- You can install all games, you can pick 1 or 2. It's your choise!
- At my place, i had to update them. You can try if it works without updating the game(s)?
- I experienced this too! At my earlier comments i said: maybe ambitions and high-end loft stuff isn't working, sorry for that! So i can't do anything for you, i'll give you the link for working isos, see below here.

- I've never saw a corrupt file, maybe there is, i don't know! Can't help you with this.
- There are many folders in the torrent/each game. Like 'crack' 'keygen' and 'ISO'. The first folder at each game is for example: De Sims 3 Wereld Avonturen. That's dutch ;) look up here for the translations.

- When it's running laggy;
  1. Your pc is not powerfull enough
  2. Maybe not enough ram or harddisk..
Solutions:
Try to shut all programs off, and all unnecessary programs too. To do it, there is one great program called GameBooster. I'll post the link beneath all this, maybe you should download it?

,denzity,2011-12-31T20:55Z,"Je hebt blijkbaar een onofficiÃ«le gamebewerking uitgevoerd die niet overeen komt met je huidige versie van De Sims 3. We raden aan om deze gamebewerking te verwijdere, of een recentere versie van de bewerking uit te voeren Als je dit niet doet, kan de game crashen, of je kunt te maken krijgen met verschillende bugs.

Wil je afsluiten?

Als ik dan door ga dan draait het spel en dan knalt hij er ineens uit.

Heb alleen Sims 3 nog maar geÃ¯nstalleerd dus zonder uitbreidingspakketten..

Graag een reactie."
