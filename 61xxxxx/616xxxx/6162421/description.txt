I'm a big fan of MMORPG games myself, and this latest installment in the ".hack//" series 
ties that together with my love of cartoons. I enjoyed this 1st episode of the new series
 and think it looks promising enough to deserve  converting to hardsubbed avi and presenting 
for general release for everyone that shares my dislike of mkv format.

All credit for Fansubs goes to Fnolli,
ty for the hard work.
 I look forward to more installments to re encode :)
