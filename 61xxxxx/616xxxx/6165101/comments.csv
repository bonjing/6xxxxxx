 So, stop degrading and complaining about the quality of my torrent, dude. :)"
,Sabi92,2011-05-16T07:01Z,"I have a question regarding the link to the gameboy games. I have just started the game and wanted to trade between Fire-red and Leaf-Green, so i picked my pokemon caugght some and got to the trading center. I changed the save type and made sure it was on Single Computer and changed the pause while inactive. When i go and trade it stops and gives me a black screen that says ""communication error. Please check all connection. Then turn power on and off"" I have tried the wireless adpater and it does the same thing. PLEASE HELP!!! 
besides that, this torrent is awesome!"

Try the following, it may work...

1. Uncheck ""pause emulation when window not active""

2. Set both processes to Above normal priority in task manager 

3. Try using VBA version 1.7.2 (google it)

4. DO NOT hit the turbo (speed) key at any time
