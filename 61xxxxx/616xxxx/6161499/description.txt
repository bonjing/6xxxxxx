"No Ordinary Double Standard"

After a friend is attacked, Stephanie tells Jim 
that she wants to join forces with him to help 
catch the perp. But when Jim informs Stephanie 
that he's built for crime fighting - and she's 
not - the competition is on to see which one of 
them can solve the case first. Meanwhile, Daphne 
feels like Jim is invoking a double standard when 
he allows JJ to date a senior but won't let her 
do the same, and Katie learns some disturbing 
news about Joshua - aka The Watcher.

Enjoy :)
