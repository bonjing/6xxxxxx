I tried this version and it would not detect the videos~ I tried a few other programs and they all failed as well.  I downloaded the latest trial version of GetFLV and used this crack, and it worked! I was also surprised that it detected the video.... the only problem is that the software itself is a trial version~ it would not let me download any more than 10MB

So what I'm saying is that it would be really awesome if you or someone could upload the latest version at the earliest convenience, because it is significantly superior to this one :)"
,stillnotcoolenough,2011-04-22T05:21Z,Yeah. 9.0 would be awesome
,stillnotcoolenough,2011-04-22T05:23Z,"Nevermind. found it. TorrentHarvester found a few.

If no one has Torrent Harvester, i recommend it by the way."
,stillnotcoolenough,2011-04-22T05:26Z,Nevemind again. The ones i found were just scams and not real.
