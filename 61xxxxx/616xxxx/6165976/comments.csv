,shasha2333,2011-02-14T00:26Z,"Excellent XviD @ 1460 kbps, I think all HDTV XviD release groups could learn something from BiA here, it makes a huge difference from standard 1000 kbps that almost all other hdtv xvids use, especially if you are displaying on a hdtv, really hope they keep up this quality."
