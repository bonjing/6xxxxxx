Miss Jones was made immortal in the previous movie but in this one she dies and goes back to hell again (or does she?). Sounds like more of the same and yes it is. But it is very different in nature compared to Part 1&2

First of all, there is no more Georgina Spelvin, so instead now Miss Jones suddenly looks like a young rock-chick, which must have been considered to be a hot thing back in the mid-'80's. This time the titular role is played by Lois Ayres, who also appeared in the fourth movie, which apparently got shot back to back with this movie.

But really the biggest difference is the change of style and approach. The first two movies were still being made from mostly a serious cinematic approach, while this movie is clearly more simply focusing on being a porn. Nothing wrong with such an approach of course but it really goes at the expense of the movie its fun and entertainment level. This director clearly had experience in this business and looses basically all of the other true cinematic aspects, that the previous 2 movies still contained a bit.

But still, this movie is being more and something better than just the average genre attempt. They still put some effort into it and it actually does follow still a sort of story. It's also way more fun to watch still than the other normal, especially modern, genre attempt. The Dark brothers wrote this with more than a little humor and irony. But beware though; this movie puts its emphasis this time way more on its hardcore porn sequences, that last quite long as well, so know what to expect when watching this movie.

Has both Parts 3&4 which was shot as just one movie in the beginning. It takes one DL DVD to fit it all.
