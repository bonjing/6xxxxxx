,bugmeless,2011-02-12T10:32Z,File size seems wrong.  Should be closer to 170MB surely?
,LordReserei,2011-02-12T12:08Z,real?...fake?...what's the quality like since it's less than 100Mb?
,koka3,2011-02-12T12:53Z,Thanks
[T],despo1ler,2011-02-12T15:30Z," The quality is fine, the encoder was experimenting with a new codec and had an economy bitrate setting at maximum so the filesize got shrunk beyond what was set but it's just as good as any of his other releases.As the quality was just as good as normal  It was decided to release it as is rather than re encode it merely to make it a bigger size that ppl are more used to and keep every1 waiting. a cpl of  other shows also had similar results yesterday but are all up to the  regular standard. The settings have been corrected since and further {C_P} releases should be back to normal size, ty for understanding :)

 And all releases made on this account are genuine {C_P} encodes.
 hopefully he will have a trusted skull soon, pls help recommend him for one, ty"

,DFanatic,2011-02-13T05:28Z,"There have been issues with the last few episodes (torrents/files). The night scenes are way to dark. At times you can hardly tell what is going on.  This show is about the young heroes performing on covert operations, most of the episode takes place at night time. Other than that, this is a great torrent. Audio is good and so is the video (aside from the issue mentioned above!)"
,CocaColaberoende,2011-02-13T13:34Z,"Quality is poor, sound is great. As ""Dfanatic"" says when it's night it is hard to see sometimes. If you are irritated by low quality then wait for a better upload. Otherwise super great torrent!"
