I downloaded game and put it in Application folder, I blocked internet access with Little Snitch and tried to run the game, but only thing that happened was message box with LoadSoundBank failed OpenRes, then I click Ok and it shows another message box with 0 inside. Must be some bug. Is anyone else experiencing similar problems?"
