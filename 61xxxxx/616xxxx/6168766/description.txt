After a huge process of obtaining the collection (over 3000 disks amongst other things), I'm pleased to announce that part 1 of the disk collection of the late Derbyshire Ram is now available to download. 

Part 1 contains over 1000 disks converted to PC. It also includes photos and a nice note-file explaining the process that we underwent to bring this to you.
