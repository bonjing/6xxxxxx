Ghost story about a new bride visiting her husband's family home. By far the best part is the opening credits, where we roam the dark corridors from the ghost's POV. That creepy slow-waltz may not be "Great Music", but it's difficult to get out of your head, what the Germans call an Ohrwurm - reminds me of William Bolcom.

The rest of the film, which involves possession, isn't bad, though it has been done better (Rebecca, Jane Eyre etc.). You'll really be waiting for the moments when THAT TUNE starts playing. It's not a bad way to spend 72 minutes. The Man Frome UNCLE even puts in an appearance...

Like most of my movies, this a segmented mpg file joined with combi-movie. It plays nicely in VLC, but you might have to make adjustments to burn it to disc. I'd appreciate any feedback.
