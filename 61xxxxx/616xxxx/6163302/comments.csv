,Dari.-,2011-02-10T02:14Z,1 hr -> 43mb downloaded. Seed please! The average speed is about 10KB/s :S
,daveo76,2011-02-10T08:49Z,I decided to cancel downloading this. it so slow within 4hrs it only downloaded 335mb. but get this it uploaded 820mb big difference. no use putting a torrent on here if download is going to be so much slower then upload
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-10T09:48Z,"Sorry it was slow for you guys.

People havnt been sticking around to seed these past few days.

Hopefully you dont have  this issue in the future."

,davisri2,2011-02-17T19:20Z,"Yes, Alex do not listen to these wailing idiots. All they do is complaining....  Great work, Alex! Please continues what you are doing. we are so appreciated. The World would be a better place if more like you.

Guys! you should be grateful when someone spending most of their efforts and valuable times just for you guys can enjoy. And what do you do?? WHINING....
Even though you are 100% seeders, how many new shows or movies ARE YOU uploading??? (Not talking about seeding). Try to spend 5-10  hours of ripping one Bluray movie and another 10-15 hours uploading to a Server, then you would know how hard it is...  And until then you are no better then those leechers...
Cheers!"
