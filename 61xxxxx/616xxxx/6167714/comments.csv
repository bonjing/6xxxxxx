thanks submitter!"
,RexRexroth,2012-02-18T00:02Z,".iso files are simple to watch on a computer.  Just right-click and open the file on VLC Media Player.  If you don't have VLC Media Player (which is totally free) you're an idiot.  It plays just about any format - audio and video - I've come across.  You can also simply burn the file to a DVD (try ImgBurn) and watch it on any DVD player.

The film is fun, but be warned that it's an Italian copy and has a lot of hard-coded (no pun intended) Italian subs, quotes, and credits under people's names, so you may not be sure who played what role in this saga unless you're up on your Italiano (judges, distributors, prosecutors, family members, etc.).

The Finnish subs are optional.

The soundtrack is great, especially if you lived through the 1970s, and the film is really well-done and at times very funny.
