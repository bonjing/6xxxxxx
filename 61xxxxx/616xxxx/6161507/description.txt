The first PACK from me will include 3 highly anticipated singles that people will talk about lately. They are Jay-Z and Kanye Westâ€™s new collaboration â€œHâ€¢Aâ€¢Mâ€, Avril Lavigneâ€™s new single â€œWhat The Hellâ€ and Britney Spearsâ€™ new single â€œHold It Against Meâ€. For the rest, There is one I really want to recommend to you. Itâ€™s my man Taio Cruzâ€™s cover of the classic John Lennon song â€œImagineâ€. I saw him perform on new yearâ€™s eve in New York city. It was brilliant.
