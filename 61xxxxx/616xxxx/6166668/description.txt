Directed by George Tillman Jr.. 

Starring Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Billy Bob Thornton, Moon Bloodgood, Maggie Grace, Tom Berenger, Jennifer Carpenter. 

An ex-con sets out to avenge his brother's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago. During his campaign, however, he's tracked by a veteran cop and an egocentric hit man. 

NOTE: Another example of misleading IMDB rating, I haven't expected much, but movie is excellent. Engaging, with fantastic cast: Mr. Thornton perfect as ever, Ms. Gugino convincing and great, Dwayne shows great acting. Honestly, I don't know who have not delivered. Even Ms. Capenter in very small role gives great authenticity...
Good "revenge" movie - recommended.
