Startled Insects - Lifepulse


Startled Insects' second album was a remixed version of the soundtrack to an extraordinary 90-minute feature film that was constructed entirely out of BBC Wildlife footage and had no dialogue except for a poem by Walt Whitman read by Richard Crenna at the end.
Check out the track 'Cheetah' that formed the basis for the later Massive Attack track "Eurochild"
