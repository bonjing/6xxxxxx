Zombie Love Song Lyrics

You donâ€™t know me, baby, but Iâ€™ve seen you around.
It might be kind of crazy, but Iâ€™m just new in town.
And now I wonder what youâ€™d think if I said, hey look
Iâ€™d like to get your number and a link to your Facebook.
Now if I tell you what a nice guyâ€™s supposed to
Would that compel you not to scream when I approach you?
Youâ€™ll have to promise me youâ€™ll take this news calmly,
But honestly, Iâ€™m sort of a zombie.

I knew youâ€™d be surprised. You can bet that I
May not be alive, but I sure as hell ainâ€™t dead inside.
Whatâ€™s with the shotty? I ainâ€™t wishing you harm.
You see, Iâ€™d try to hold your hand but Iâ€™m missing an arm.
Brains are all Iâ€™ve eaten all week itâ€™s true,
But if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
So let me take you to Wendyâ€™s. You deserve it.
Yeah, Iâ€™m a zombie, baby. Ainâ€™t nobody perfect.

Iâ€™ll chase you through the yard and all through the house into the dark.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
Iâ€™ve never been so true, but if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.

Baby, sometimes I bite, and you can bet
That Iâ€™ve got an appetite for human flesh.
Iâ€™ll always be near though. Youâ€™ll have to accept that
When I nibble on your earlobe you might get infected.
Cause I fell in love with you and Iâ€™m
Undead but you make me feel alive.
And when I chase you through the graveyard
It feels like foreplay.

If Iâ€™m lying Iâ€™m dying, and I speak truly
When I say I love your mind. Iâ€™ll take brains over beauty.
Weâ€™ll be the undead Dagwood and Blondie
When I teach you how to zombie, teach you, teach you how to zombie.
And everybody will love you, and you can sing along
to this post-apocalyptic, postmortem love song.
So give me a chance,girl. You know Iâ€™ll be worth it.
Yeah, Iâ€™m a zombie, baby. Ainâ€™t nobody perfect.

Iâ€™ll chase you through the yard and all through the house into the dark.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
Iâ€™ve never been so true, but if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.

Brains. Brains. Brains. Brains.
Brains. Brains.

Iâ€™ll chase you through the yard and all through the house into the dark.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
Iâ€™ve never been so true, but if my heart were still beating, it would beat for you.
I wanna steal your heart and eat your brains.
