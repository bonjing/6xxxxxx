You gonna go correct your mistake on Stag Night, or simply have hundreds download a movie they don't want?"

So eager to get a skull and advertise YOUR TORRENT SITE you'll upload anything without even looking at it! Now literally hundreds of people are wasting their time uploading a movie they don't want."
