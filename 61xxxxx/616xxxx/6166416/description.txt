"The Daredevil in the Mold"

A BMX rider's remains are discovered on the 
roof of a warehouse after a failed bike 
stunt. While Booth and Brennan interrogate 
the victim's fellow riders, Hodgins and 
newly mellowed "squint" Fisher (guest star 
Moore) identify the numerous fractures in 
the victim's skeletal structure, and Angela 
recreates the series of events that led to 
the fatal accident. Meanwhile, Sweets turns 
to Booth for advice about his relationship 
with Daisy, and Booth makes a decision 
about his relationship with Hannah.
