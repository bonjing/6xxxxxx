,fatty_h,2011-02-10T16:43Z,Screenshots have no JH watermark. First DVDSCR I've seen without it. Assuming it is a screener...
,shasha2333,2011-02-11T08:39Z,"The JH mark is there, he just took careful screenshots in particular moments when it is not as noticeable. Just zoom in on the middle with any in photoshop and there is the JH"
,BMF916,2011-02-12T06:43Z,"actually the JH  has been blurred,still can't decide if its better blurred or not but its not bad, thanks for the effort anyhow."
,shasha2333,2011-02-15T08:43Z,"It's still there, blurred or not, you can't decide because it's right smack in the middle of the screen and naturally your eyes can't not look at it, same shit different pile."
