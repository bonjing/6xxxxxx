,jonesc16,2011-02-11T05:04Z,Whats the A/V like on this
[S],WTCSWE,2011-02-11T09:14Z,"@jonesc16

If you click on the highlighted number 9(next to files, above size [description] top) you should be able to see the content of the torrent.When done you will also notice that there's a sample.avi  14.82 MiB inside.Download and judge yourself, that way you won't have any doubts if it's good quality or not.
After all the sample file is just 14-15 MB."

Much better than the screener screener."
,-Cortex-,2011-02-13T11:34Z,"Screens look shit (compression artifacts should not be present at such a high bitrate) and audio is only 2 channel which has been messed with.

This clearly isn't a region1/2 DVD rip, it's got to be a mis-labled R5 at best, possibly just an SCR."

,StanOntario,2011-04-10T02:14Z,This is typical of Extremezone efforts that won't play all the way through the movie on a DVD player; and in this case a Philips DVP 3560. Like other Extremezone stuff it kacks near the end of the movie and won't play any further. This one kacks at 1:16. :-(
