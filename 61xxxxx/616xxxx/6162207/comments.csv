,OmniusPrime,2011-02-09T20:14Z,I really appreciate these uploads - it's one of my favorite series - but I wanted to mention that the last 3 torrents probably don't belong in the HiRes category as they're all 640x480. It actually looks like anything #133 and lower is all standard res. But please don't let that stop the torrents 8^).
,OmniusPrime,2011-02-09T20:14Z,"Sorry, I meant #113 and lower."

The title isn't accurate either anymore. Will change it from the next one on.

Tried editing, but editing is disabled? Maybe someone can move the previous two and this one? I hope they don't get deleted because of being in the wrong section."
