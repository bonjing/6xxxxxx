      Tim Marlow and his studio guests discuss two very different
      approaches to the news - Channel 4's The Ten O'Clock Show and
      new movie Morning Glory. They take a look at the latest
      exhibition at the Tate Modern, and hear from Rosamunde Pike
      about her appearance in the film adaptation of Mordechai
      Richler's acclaimed tragi-comic novel Barney's Version.
