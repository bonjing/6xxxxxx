[T],MelloYello,2011-02-10T09:19Z,Hey mirrormaster82 nice uploads.  I got a question. I wanted to try scanning a comic book to see how to do it. I scanned a comic book and it's only 23 pages long but the file is 37.1MB big.  I see how most of your single issues are below 20MB.  Anyways It turned out good and I have it in .cbr format and can read it with Comic Rack just fine.  Just curious how the pros do it.  Thanks for the uploads.  I just recently got back into comics. Your uploads help me to catch up on stories I have missed.
