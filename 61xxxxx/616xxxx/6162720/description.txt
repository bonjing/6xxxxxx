Lost 5'5" x 19 1/4 Redux DVD. 

With tri-fins and 360â€™s to spare, Lost 5â€™5â€ x 19 Â¼ Redux proves that itâ€™s not the motion of the ocean, or the size of the board, itâ€™s the pure shredability of the stick. The remake (redux) of the early 90â€™s surf film, dedicated to thick barrels and short fish, features heavy beach breaks shallow enough to bring the manliest of shaper to tears, some 90â€™s punk tunes, and butt loads of neon. The throwback film loads up on heavy rippers, including Chris Ward, Shane Beschen and Dane Reynolds, putting sub 5â€™6â€ boards to their limits. Ending with Cory Lopez and Ian Walsh surfing some epic, endless tubes, numero dos of Lost 5â€™5â€ x 19 Â¼â€ doesnâ€™t disappoint. And after Kelly Slaterâ€™s recent Pipemasters victory with â€œDeep Sixâ€, a 5â€™11â€ shred stick, the film reaffirms bigger doesnâ€™t always mean better.
