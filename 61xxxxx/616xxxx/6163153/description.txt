Human Resources â€“ Social Engineering in the 20th Century explores the rise of mechanistic philosphy and the exploitation of human beings under modern hierarhical systems. Topics covered include behaviorism, scientific management, work-place democracy, schooling, frustration-aggression hypothesis and human experimentation. Scott Noble, the filmmaker behind the extraordinary and informative documentary â€œPsywar,â€ has made another revelatory and important documentary, available free to the public, called â€œHuman Resources: Social Engineering in the 20th Century.â€

â€œEsentially,â€ says Scott, â€œthis film is about the rise of mechanistic philosphy and the exploitation of human beings under modern hierarhical systems.â€ The film includes original interviews with: â€œNoam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Rebecca Lemov (â€œWorld as Laboratoryâ€), Christopher Simpson (â€œThe Science of Coercionâ€), George Ritzer (â€œThe McDonaldization of Societyâ€), Morris Berman (â€œThe Reenchantment of the Worldâ€), John Taylor Gatto (â€œDumbing us Downâ€), Alfie Kohn (â€œWhat does it mean to be well educated?â€) and others.â€

Read David Ker Thomsonâ€™s review of the film. He writes: â€œIt answers the significant events of the last century the way a glass answers the implicit questions of a man who peers into its reflective surfaceâ€“point for point. It corresponds, in short, to reality.â€
