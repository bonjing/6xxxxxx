""Sassy Sue""--the story of a young man, his cow, and the women who try to come between them--is a much more polished effort. The acting is a little better (though it's still bad), the cast is more effective and there's actually some genuine laughs. A definite highpoint in this one is John Tull's tryst with one of the horny babes wanting some backwoods boffing (""It would help if you mooed a little,"" he snipes). The sex--although simulated and not quite as explicit as that in ""Pigkeeper's Daughter"" (there's a moment in the final scene that pushes the boundaries of softcore, however)--seems a little more genuine in ""Sassy Sue."" Both movies are raunchy fun, though ""Pigkeeper's Daughter"" is raunchier and ""Sassy Sue"" is more fun."
