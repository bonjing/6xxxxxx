"Wheels of Justice"

Harry (Kathy Bates) grows increasingly 
concerned about Malcolm's (Aml Ameen) 
association with the over-the-top Tommy 
and their lawsuit. Meanwhile, Tommy 
struggles to be less ridiculous as he, 
his associate, and Malcolm argue in court 
against large fast-food corporations. In a 
shocking turn of events, Chunhua (Irene 
Keng) is attacked behind the laundromat. 
When her assailant is set free after 
cutting a deal, Damien (Johnny Ray Gill) 
risks serious jail time by taking justice 
into his own hands, while Adam (Nate 
Corddry) finds comfort in his ex-
girlfriend, Rachael.
