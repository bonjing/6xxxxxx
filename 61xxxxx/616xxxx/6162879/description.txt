Additional notes

The band was originally called Amon (USA), and recorded two demos under this name, which were later released on CD as "Amon - Feasting The Beast." They changed the name to Deicide in late 1989, just prior to the recording of the self-titled debut. This was done at the insistence of their then-label, Roadrunner Records, because there was a song called "'Amon' Belongs to 'Them'" on the King Diamond album, "Conspiracy."
