Thanks for (The Cape and) your effort, it is appreciated."

,funpigj,2011-02-09T04:45Z,"Thx for Chuck, 5-0 an The Cape!

PS, watched Chicago Code today, worth checking out...

Outcasts from the BBC was intriguing as well."
,ankit280,2011-02-09T06:41Z,Thanks for Gossip Girl and HIMYM..
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-09T07:40Z,"To all big Thanks.

@funpigj: I did watched new shows, I have the time, because I follow Castle only. So - as you said, CC looks good, engaging and I would follow future  episodes. Mr. Sunshine was really bad, almost stupid. Fantastic cast, but enormously big piece of bad writing. Outcasts (I love SciFi) were ... well... a middle type of sorrow. I would watch episode two to see..."
