2nd attempt at getting this right its working on demonoid so should do here lol 

After searching for a week on various torrent sites to find any of the 3d motive tutorials i finally decided i would buy some and then upload here (and demonoid) for others.

In this torrent i have included the 4 3d motive tuts i could afford...

High Poly Modeling
Modular Building
Sci-Fi Floor
UVW Unwrapping

i will update the torrent as i get more of the tuts.

unfortunately i dont have the greatest connection so please seed this for as long as you can, help the community by sharing.
