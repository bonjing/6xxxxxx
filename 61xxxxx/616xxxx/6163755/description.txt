By the late 70s Motown was far from the powerhouse it had been a decade earlier but, as this collection shows, was still turning out great records. Eleven of the tracks included here made the UK Top 20; some are still known to everybody, but this compilation also provides the opportunity to catch up with others, such as Yvonne Fair's remarkable 'It Should Have Been Me', which have largely slipped under the radar in the intervening decades.

Of the non-hits, the tracks from Teena Marie, Tata Vega and Rick James are well worth acquiring - very much of their time but very strong records nevertheless, and unlikely to feature on other general Motown compilations.

The only odd omission is David Ruffin's 1976 Top 10 hit 'Walk Away From Love'. Maybe there was a reason this track could not have been included when this compilation was originally released, but it should certainly be here at the expense of Smokey Robinson's 'Big Time', which was not a hit and is not a particularly good record either, the weakest track on here by some distance.

Overall, as a chance to get hold of some half-forgotten gems, this can't be bettered.
