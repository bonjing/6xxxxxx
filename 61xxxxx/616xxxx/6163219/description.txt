FUBAR ShutDown 2011 v2
----------------------

This is the newest version of this VERY annoying application!

This will prevent anyone from logging in to Windows.

After installation, nothing happens. As usual :)

Next time any user logs in, they will be presented with a black screen. Nothing else. Just a black screen.
Whenever the user clicks the mouse or presses any key on the keyboard, Windows will log out immediately!



Here is how to remove it:
Restart the computer and boot into Safe-Mode.
Open the Registry Editor ('regedit.exe'), and browse to this key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run

(On Windows XP, the last path will be 'RunOnce')

Delete the value named "FUBAR ShutDown 2011 v2".
