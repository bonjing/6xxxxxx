Cuddy\'s mother, Arlene, is admitted to Princeton Plansboro after complaining about unusual symptoms, but stubborn Arlene insists that House be removed from the case, forcing House to come up with non-conventional - and illegal - means to treat his patient. House instructs his team to follow his lead, and they discover details in Arlene\'s personal life that she kept secret from Cuddy and her sister Lucinda. Later, Cuddy places her trust in House to ensure that her mother receives the proper medical treatment, leading \"by the book\" medical student Masters to reevaluate her responsibility to practice within a code of ethics and to follow her boss\' orders.
