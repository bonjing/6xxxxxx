,DownloaderDogg,2011-02-09T05:11Z,I'm rather new to torrenting (but learning very fast!) and was surprised I could download from demonoid even though I'm not a member (Yeah...found out we get a few nips a week.)  I saw your name there....thanks for sharing your stuff here Mantesh since everybody can't be a part of 'their' world.  I like your stuff!  (No...won't beg for an invite like a dog for a steak.  I find that rather cheezy.)
