Futanari Insanity Part 5.B - Parody Futa - Revision B | From Pr0n_Glutton/black_dragon
Possibly Hosted by others on various trackers.

OPTIONAL: If you followed the optional instructions from the previous torrents, then you may want to just delete part 5 and replace it with this. This is an upgrade to part 5, and it might be easier to "start over" than to manually merge all the new folders with the new, and end up with some possible duplicates

Unfortunately, Empornium and PureTNA are gone for good, so we'll obviously not see them finished there. I will still keep my Empornium name "black_dragon" in my text files to let people know who I was from that site.


FUTANARI INSANITY IS BACK WITH A VENGANCE!

Sorry to leave you guys hanging over a year, but I started pursuing other endeavors and life caught up with me. But now I have a better computer and can reseed some old parts for a good long while now! Though, stupidly of me. I started downloading more pics for "Parody Futa" because I forgot I already made that torrent.  You will either see this as me wasting time on an existing part, or getting tons of more new pics making the torrent more than 4 times better....or at least bigger. Yep 4 times bigger with tons more content, and it actually ended up being smaller than the intended next part "Art Style" which is at like 3 or 4 Gigs now.

In a nutshell, Parody futa 5.B are futanari of familiar game, anime, toon, manga, and movie characters, including a few comics and doujins here and there. I think it was worth the wait. As usual the _Preview folder will have some pics you can check out for a preview, and I think I'll leave a few small folders open that you can download while you wait for the other zip's to download.

Be sure to give me credit when you repost this. And at least give me thanks because you won't find a better pic collection for easy download. Ratings, comments, thanks, votes, reposts etc highly appreciated!
