,6oxtynin9,2011-12-28T05:05Z,"Assuming you have:
*3.55 Kmeaw
*Latest version of MultiMan 2.0.9

It WILL work. Because there is one large file in this game, it will need to be split (if playing from External). Split large file, transfer it to ext HDD via FTP or direct via USB, launch MM and Cache 4GB files to internal.  MM should do all the work. Fix permission too, just in case. If it still doesn't work (assuming you have both of the mentioned above), do a hash check to make sure none of the files are corrupted. If even one file returns as corrupted, re-download the entire game."

,Judirek,2012-04-09T13:23Z,"TO ALL THOSE WHO DOESN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT THINGS LIKE: 3.55, EUR, etc.
Means 3.55 version Custom Firmware is a hacked version of a ps3(you are the one who needs to do this but if you're in a country that sucks in almost everything like mine many people will exploit in doing this so they make it a business) but first check your ps3 version go to 'system settings' column if it's 3.55 below then you can jailbreak(term for hacking it or converting a Sony Original Firmware/OFW to any know Custom Firmware/CFW) but if it's 3.56 above then there's no such way as of now to hack it but there's this recommended E3 Flasher(not sure about the name) to downgrade/lower the OFW e.g. 3.56 -> 3.55 so that it can be hacked for more info about this go to 'ps3iso.com' it's a forum and there's alot of games there that'll work on CFW 3.55 also it helped me alot in games fixes(when you download a game sometimes it wouldn't run so you need fixes), EUR stands for Europe it's the game's region it contains alot of languages so it's bigger in size than the US and JP region, as I've said there are also US for USA and JP for Japanese just go to the site and read posts(it's a forum).
