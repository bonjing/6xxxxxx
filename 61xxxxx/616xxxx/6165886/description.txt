After departing Washington DC-area blues band The Nighthawks, Jimmy Thackery re-emerged as power trio Jimmy Thackery & The Drivers in order put the spotlight firmly on his aggressive blues rock guitar playing. The selections from his Blind Pig releases that comprise The Essential Jimmy Thackery date from 1992 to 2000, and represent what many consider to be his most vibrant and creative period. Special guests include Duke Robillard, Lonnie Brooks, and Reba Russell. 

â€œHis aggressive playing is evident on every track, and his generally intelligent songwriting and savvy cover selection are also on display.â€ â€“ Sacramento Bee

â€œThis compilation of Thackeryâ€™s gruff vocal sides effectively captures the manâ€™s rowdy brand of electric blues, with slick production that matches the commercial rock veneer of the music.â€ â€“ Living Blues 

â€œThis is one of those crossover albums that should have rockers singing the blues and blues buffs doing the duck walk.â€ â€“ Goldmine
