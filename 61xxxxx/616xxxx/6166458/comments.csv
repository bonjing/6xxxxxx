,BladeRunner12,2011-02-14T17:24Z,"Thanks a lot for posting these great GT5 pics, kingkoopa4108! :)"
,BladeRunner12,2011-02-14T21:54Z,"Ahum...it seems that some of these pics do NOT have anything in common with GT5...

GT combined with a little bit of (comic) pr0n? What were you thinking? :)"
,BladeRunner12,2011-02-15T04:32Z,"Please please PLEASE accept my sincere apologies!

It seems that there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with these GT5 images, so please ignore my mistaken comment above!

For some weird reason it somehow ""happens"" that not fully downloaded pics got mixed (?) with other pics. Yeah those earlier mentioned (comic) pr0n pics were already on my computer.

Are there any people who have encountered similar hick-ups?

Again, there is nothing wrong with these GT5 pics, for which I thank you again, kingkoopa4108! "

Yes, I have seen that effect as well, not with this torrent, but with others. I suppose you are using uTorrent as well? Not sure if this is something particular to our client, but yes, this has happened with me before. Somehow it mixes up with other pictures that aren't even near the torrent (but that have been downloaded with the same torrent client, that must be said)."
,BladeRunner12,2011-02-15T20:49Z,"^^ death0100, thanks very much for your comment! :) I'm glad I'm not the only one who has seen this strange effect, because I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me (even when I haven't had too much to drink) ;)

btw: yes, I'm also using uTorrent."
