*PROPER Notes....: Again, CRiMSON is having sync issues. Top.Shot.S02E01.HDTV.XviD-CRiMSON is 150ms out of sync. It is also
		   noticeably overcropped on the left and the bottom. I'm not going to take the time to post screenshots but if
		   you'd like to take a look the best spots are in the very beginning for the left and the close-ups on the 
		   targets for the bottom.
