,redvanilla,2011-02-10T16:14Z,"@all:  ItĂÂ´s unbelievable - almost every file on the first page is marked at least once or even more often with "" -1 "". It seems as if one guys personality disorder has caught up with him/her. Although I only download maybe one file per week, this kind of ignorance and stupidity really gets me mad. It is a matter of solidarity, quite unpopular nowdays but all the more needed!

So everybody, please show your appreciation either with a "" +1 "" or write a comment. A small sign of respect undoubtedly deserved! "
,coolasad,2011-02-10T18:22Z,Thanks for all the episodes

i'm surprised @ you even commenting on the unappreciative nature of the various leeches benefiting from the wonderful and YET UNMATCHED kindness of this wonderful personality (20-40). while it is usual to find ungrateful ingrates, it's likewise usual to find amongst them, reasonable guys like you who constantly have to REMIND them of the need to show some respect and appreciation for the FAVOR being done to them. i for one cant imagine how this guy (20-40) does his thing, i mean, ripping, encoding, uploading not one, two, or three...do you sleep, dude?! RESPECT MAN, R E S P E C T !!!!!!!!"

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-10T19:51Z,"I give everything I have. For that reason only, I refuse to accept shameful, respect-less, negligent, stupid and maniacal
behavior of people who came and would come here.

I have something, they make decision to get it from me - get faster than anywhere else, free of charge,
and as it doesn't suffice - they would come back, again and again, just to make even with the world or myself - for practically no reason at all. At least, the true one I can accept, and more than often, even to comprehend.

I admit, I have stopped trying it, long ago.

To make something very clear: I give everything - literary.
Not my spare time, not my free time - but - all of it.
For best or for worse - I never ever have made nor intend to make any cent out of all encoding and ""torrenting"" - as my time,
I give - every cent into, even if that mean that I would be hungry..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-10T19:52Z,"... 
This summer, at the end of June, my old computer ditched out, reluctantly, slowly died at the end. Just handful of people noticed my virtual absence. Only two dozens asked can they help.
Only ten helped.
Out of several thousands. 

Count all peers you see downloading one of my encodes... Add them together... Day by day, week by week, month by month, years... I have people right here who download from me from 2007, but when I needed help, I haven't even asked.
I knew that I should expect nothing and I know that any men have his own burden.

So, do not wonder why some people are treated differently.
I have my own ""metrics"" to distinguish between the wheat and the tares.
I am and I was good at it.

Right now, only thing that I CAN expect - is 'apparition' of winner of ""Spelling Bee"" contest or some (and same) idiots who try to make me ""right"" (read ""insane"") or to fit me in some box their demented minds were able to create. "
,believenu,2011-02-10T20:19Z,Thank you.seeding is sharing.
,redvanilla,2011-02-10T20:30Z,@highres99: You can be sure people would find time to comment if they cant find their favorite show or anything else beeing different to what they believe to be their godgiven right. But to show any positive reaction seems to exhausting for most of them. Its disgusting! 
,odyssey09,2011-02-10T20:39Z,"Thanks for Friday Night Lights, it will be missed! It's now 22 - 1 on quality, a commanding lead for team 24!"
,red6tiger,2011-02-10T23:05Z,"Thanks for the tv shows posted ... it is only recently that I learned that you existed thanks to a search I did for ""californication s04e05""after that I logged into your account and saw that post more tv shows. Currently I'm downloding ""Californication, Fringe, Human Target, Nikita, Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries"", and I am awaiting the return of ""The Event"". Probably you just put tv shows that you see but you could be posting ""Better with you "" and ""Perfect Couples""? In my opinion I think that would be easier to find the tv shows are not posted on the packs, but individually as you do with the movies and as you did with some episodes of TV shows like ""Californication s04e05 or Episodes S01E05""because many people make the search by episode ... so probably more people would be doing downloads and more seeds and peers, it's just a suggestion. I was going to be your follower and tuned all day to download your torrents. Thanks from Portugal"
,froglog,2011-02-11T00:28Z,Thank you very much for Human Target
,jmac85,2011-02-11T00:33Z,"Excellent quality, as always. Thanks for: Criminal Minds, Human Target, Justified, Law and Order, and NCIS. Much appreciated! (+1)"
,jon4fun,2011-02-11T00:52Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers
Jon

@ All the 'positives' thanks for supporting the man. Please, more often. It doesn't have to be a thesis every time. Just a 'thanks' and the show(s) you like with a '+' for quality.
@ All the 'negative' (3 of you chickenshits) - I don't understand you. Just go away, 20-40 does not need or deserve you shits.

@20-40 - thanks for The CF show and Human Target."
,funpigj,2011-02-11T04:59Z,"Thx for FNL!!  

Glad to see you're doing Justified.  Great show."
,nikoHD,2011-02-11T05:56Z,Hi 20/40 thanks for F.R.I.N.D.S i am a huge Fan of the show! I have never seen it in such great quality!! Thanks again mate. I know requests are on hold but when you start doing requests again could you upload s club seeing double? 
,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-11T07:03Z,"Thanks.

Re: help.  my desktop computer krapped out on me ~last part of May last year too.  What kept me going was an eMachines netbook bought with a meager tax refund.  I managed to rebuild the desktop and get it back online ~ Jan 27.  The only help I could have given is Gordian Knot/XVID'd avi's..."

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-11T10:12Z,"@hkoraddi: Sad. It makes me noxious.

In past few months I have seen drastic increase of attacks from Planet of Morons. It's funny to read what staff on this site (forum and IRC) say about - stubbornly defending sand-box for idiots. 

I wonder how many of these minuses comes from people with multiple accounts, banned uploaders - AND - current, active uploaders, who use ""-"" rating as a weapon of ... self-destruction, trying to make others look bad - for reasons known only to lunatics, what those individuals definitely are. "
,hazel13,2011-02-11T11:32Z,Thank You for FNL for the last time 20-40!!! =>
,highres99,2011-02-11T12:26Z,"@all: i think some mo-fos have taken it as a duty upon themselves to destroy this guy's (20-40) reputation with the minuses, some as a hobby, while others for the simple fact that they cant do what he does! For whichever reason you do that, however, you fools have failed and will continue to fail! All hail 20-40...fuck all you punk ass muthafuckas that aint down with him what he's doing!!!! RESPECT, MAN!!!!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-11T13:22Z,"@red6tiger: Greetings to Portugal. Now - about what you have said:

It's misconception, plain and simple. It's like a discussion about downloads of full albums against individual songs. Count in so called ""Discography"" releases of some musician or group (more albums and few dozen songs inside).

It is absolutely the same. 

Do all people like all songs equally? Nope. Do they need to download those they don't like? Yes, they can and they do just that - they choose what they like or want.

Point - Seeding: It doesn't make any difference - none at all. Ones who would stay to seed would share with others - things they get for free.

Point - Downloading: [CHOOSE] tag is self-explainable. People should learn the things before they are able to use or do anything. So is with torrents. And yes - torrents are less effective when individual files are chosen for download than complete (in full, as whole) download. It is well known fact from day one. If somebody doesn't know that, he would experience that and accept that as trade-off for his ability to choose.

Point - Searching: Anyone with decent IQ know what Google is, and anyone has use it who knows how to use Internet at all, right.

So, writing down in Google Search a term ""TV.Shows.Pack"" and get lined up ALL my uploads of TV packs doesn't look to complicated.

Only predisposition is to know what one is looking for. And maybe to have something between the ears (not just empty skull or some mish-mash inside)."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-11T13:32Z,"""and anyone has use it who knows how to use Internet at all, right."" sounded perfectly sane on my native language, but on English, sounds as rubbish.

Maybe ""anyone who use Internet knows how to use Google"" sounds simpler and better.
Sorry."
