Hey ! Think a second , any of you really think that i upload a game file that canÂ´t be played ? I never did that in years , why do it now ? No one respect more the possible users than myself , the true is that for pratical files i need to do a correct appreciation for each game in what can be worked but just that , never cross my mind for a second doing work that can really prejudicate the gameplay on the users , my conscience is always the best possible analising the possible work and all of you if think for a second and put yourselfs in my position making a pratical file think the same , for original pcdvds isos is always another files with more size that is normal , what the users expected beside the possible doubts about the work is the game working fine for less size and that is one of the goals beside that keeping more as possible the gameplay but still having in mind that is a pratical file and for that everything that can be worked and possibly without prejudicating the gameplay worked , it is what make sense for this type of file , it is true that the user need to have some trust in the uploader but i have to say in my case that having a clean conscience presenting the work for this type of file it is important too and i respect the users and the work more as possible and this it is also true and it is lot of files for this type of work to comprove that ..."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-09T08:55Z,"UPLOADER DISCLAIMER PART 2 AND FINAL PART

i am not saying that sometimes canÂ´t happen have some risk doing this type of work but that my friendly users is inerent of doing this type of files , analising the games are always decisions that can be maked and that must be , on this one the intention was futil videos and the russian language removed thatÂ´s all and the tests indicate everything ok and i already played a while with the file exactly like the users will get , this is true ! I simply try to do what the users expect for this type of files in the best correct way but sometimes the structures of the games itselfs can show some uncertain precison on the result of the procedure to do the work and that it is also true but this my friendly users not with intention , it is because it is what make sense for this type of work , my tests indicates everything fine like the file it is on the first few missions , all of you can believe me and i respect all of you doing the correct work for this type of file more as possible .

Thank you and i wish a nice happy gaming to all of you without borrings but if anything goes wrong i am here anyway and in all this years it wasnÂ´t a single time that i simply disappeared leaving the users without the appropriate help , so i am here for the worst if it is the case too but i repeat my tests are really positive at least for the first missions with everything looking normal .

Cheers and i like of all of you ."

after that any thing special do with uplauncher.exe????"

Just one question to you mate. Follow your instructions strictly but when I run uplauncher.exe it download some files wanted I or not -and after I blocked/denied it with Windows firewall!- showing a message ""Your NAT type is: Strict:Symmetric"".
When it finished to upgrade/downloading I hit play but nothing happens, just give me a message ""The game did not properly install on this system. Please try to install the game again using the installer (DVD or downloaded installer)""

I put the folder -in a Atari folder as your instructions says- on my Program files directory, but I think as I have Windows in other language rather than english, so my Program files directory is called as the translation, could it be causing some problems to your coded arragments done on the file, couldn't it?
Help me if you can, please"

VERRY WELL DONE "
[V],globeplus,2011-02-11T14:39Z,"To daucuskorota : Hi . The executable of this game have a couple of functions that need to execute before worked properly and that functions are : 1 - need to update to a preterit server to the online features 2 - need to recognise the game installed on the computer , conclusion : the need of to recognise the game installation means that the fixed directory is obrigatory and that can only be succeded with the register correct like it is after the normal installation , about the obrigatory update the excutable need the correct ambience on the computer to be accepted that means he makes a search on the possible type of connection to the online and if this feature is ok it simply bypass that like nothing happen , the idea that the player get it is that is tough the preterit server not to be recogined by the excutable but in certain circunstances maybe can happen a possibility that he find that not all the necessary requirements to the online feature are correct , i advice to install again the dxwebsetup.exe and verify please the drivers , directx and vcredists if they are properly installed , if everything is ok the executable when the recognising of the online feature he simply keep going and the button with the PLAY on it simply turns on to the player start playing the game , follow my advices and i really wish to you a good luck on the correction of the mentionated issue and consequently play the game ."

[V],globeplus,2011-02-18T16:46Z,"To sidaster and ALL THE USERS : 

this is an information comment with a disappointed uploader with his care but knowing at the same time that the intention was to get the best possible size to this supposed pratical file , i failed my feellow users , if for one side it is possible to play many and many hours of gameplay like it is now , for other side the player canÂ´t finish the game because the HAWAI location and all his features arenÂ´t available , now the users ask me why you did that ? because i didnÂ´t notice on the tests and the presence of the russian language makes me think that the files was about the language and because only after many hours of gameplay you find out what was about the files not included and that is that the removed files are the HAWAI location and all correspondent missions and things , so excuse me my fellow users for my procedure and i promise a HAWAI file independtly of the file size to the downloaders of this important part of the game can finish the game and the user need this game part to have all the game , so the HAWAI part it will be a complementary part to the all game and count with a few giga to download but having in mind that the game will be really complete no doubt and no frustation after many hours about the possibility of never be possible to finish the file .

Sorry about this and still many hours possible to play with only this file but to really complete the game the HAWAI part must be downloaded too , i am shore that the users understand somehow my behaviour on this procedure because the intention was to get the best possible size to the pratical file of the game .

Thank you all for understand and TEST DRIVE UNLIMITED 2 HAWAI - GLOBE it will be the new complementary file for this one and at this moment in time still a few hours in front on the work with some work to do but it will be available soon as possible .

Compreensive excuses from this uploader to all the users of this file , i repeat the intention was the best for a pratical file ."
