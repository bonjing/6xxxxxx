,press2010,2011-02-12T16:28Z,Thanks for posting. Can you briefly describe what is in the content DVD? If it is tutorials or examples I do not believe that I need it and this torrent would be perfect with just the install.TIA.

[T],tim2251337x,2011-03-02T02:01Z,"oh,by the way,I know wtf I'm doing unlike trin02,and DON'T post other's links on my page,thanx(no offence to anyone except the one that doesn't download and try it,but tries to slam me).I only up torrents I would use personally.

I'm not trying to be an a-hole,but most of these comments(by 1 person)are ignorant b.s.

g'day everyone"
