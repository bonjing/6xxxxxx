Review
"Prior to the adoption of this book (PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, 5th edition), the textbook was FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICS by Halliday and Resnick. Although Halliday and Resnick's book was the textbook chosen by the Physics Department, many students were observed by the faculty to be studying from Serway's book. The students had acquired old used versions of the Serway book, and they were actively studying out of this book rather than the prescribed textbook. Serway's book became our students' popular choice. The Physics Department, recognizing this, adopted a "give them what they want" attitude, and accordingly Serway's book was made the textbook for the calculus-based undergraduate physics course."
