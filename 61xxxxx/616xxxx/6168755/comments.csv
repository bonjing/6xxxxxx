,daveo76,2011-02-13T05:47Z,This is crap. It only sometimes download below dialup speed. most times it won't download. I think the amount of seeders & leechers it says it has is FAKE
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-13T07:46Z,i'm downloading at a minimum of 350 kb/s so i dont know what seems to be the problem.
,daveo76,2011-02-13T08:40Z,for me it only downloading below 10kb/s :(
,daveo76,2011-02-14T10:45Z,@realzeon thanks for your suggestion. I googled the recommended settings for utorrent and applied it and then it went heaps faster. but strange i never had that problem before. the video was very good quality
