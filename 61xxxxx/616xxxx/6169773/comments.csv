,highres99,2011-02-12T16:24Z,"@ 20-40: thanks (as usual) for Fringe and for every other of your uploads. could u please teach me how to compress/encode, i am hoping i get to learn to be like you. (serious, man)!
@justregged: which of the Martyrs, '08 or '09, what's the plot of the movie."
,justregged,2011-02-12T16:43Z,"08 and i wouldn't recommed it tbh, think of the most horrific film you have ever seen and multiply it by a 1000 and you still would have no idea of what this film is. And i dont mean horrific as in scary i mean as in sick and depressing. I suppose the only comforting thing is that its just a movie but it doesn't really help. :("

,starrknight,2011-02-12T19:39Z,"@20-40,

Hey, ive been trying to download your uploads and they take ages because my internet connection is really bad, I know that if I was seeding you then this would help with the download speed but for some reason I can only see you and not actually seed from you :(. Do you know why??

Thanks :-) x"

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-12T20:31Z,"@starrknight: If you have received any bytes from my BitTornado, it's - good sign. At least you are not blocked by your provider or myself (skeletons in the closet).

Now comes what most people doesn't understand: number of active connections is limited - on your side as on my side (to lesser extent). Let say on 50. Any of my swarms has more than 100 peers, maybe hour after I upload some torrent. Now, it means that neither of us both CANNOT connect to other one. What complicates further is ability to get not only mentioned fifty active connections, but again, both of us can establish 10-16 UPLOAD connections only, simultaneously. Now - real chances that you and me can establish not just an connection, but one where you get packets of data from me - drops significantly with number of peers in one swarm.

It seems complicated, but you hopefully can make analogies to some other situations in your life and understand that torrents were invented to  circumvent these problems of single-to-single connection.
Therefore - I have been parroting these words for years - sharing the bytes between all peers in one swarm is crucial and of greatest importance.

Then is irrelevant factor can you or can you not connect to main, or one seeder. Ones who can - get the bytes and pass them to you and other peers.
Theoretically is so...

But, what if ALL peers or majority are hard-fisting bastards, who keep Upload at minimum and  Download speed at maximum?

People get screwed, deprived. Become angry and vent shouting on me. And I have absolutely nothing with any of connection problems.

And - sweet for dessert, if you have not ever received any bytes from me - you are screwed by your provider or network owner and you can do nothing about, except trying to change your program or to apply correct settings just to be sure that you have done all you can.

So as I just did."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-12T20:50Z,"@starrknight: Forgotten, sorry:

Try Stop-Run few times, minute apart. On that way you change the members of your swarm (down-loaders around you) and you can get - better company and more cooperative people around, who would share. But, you must give them too, or your inner-swarm rating would become so low then no one would give you nothing 'cause you have been marked as ""uncooperative"" (by programs, not by people 'per se', of course)."
