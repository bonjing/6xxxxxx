,9GustavBecker9,2011-02-12T06:49Z,"This cinematic masterpiece is the hollywood filmography version for an actual occurance which happened about 276,959 years, 135 days, 6.28967715634 hours, and 79 farts ago. 
One day, so the legend goes, a Yeti woke up from a long hibernation period with a huge icicle between it's legs; similar to the phenomenon known as morning wood, but a lot more significant. Now, our friend the Yeti started taking care of business in the usual way... by going over to this igloo type of ice sculpture he made, and he started to thrust. Nothing special about the whole morning ritual here, but our Yeti friend had a meal the previous night which did not really agree with his tummy. As Mr. Yeti was about to wad drop inside his frigid fornication fabrication fuckin' thing, he laughed, thinking to himself..., ""I'm glad everything here is white anyway, because this would be a real pain in the ass to clean up every morning...."", and he didn't clean it up either, he just left it inside there to feed future fish when the snow melted thousands of years later. Anyway, (fart), the title of this movie is simply just what happened when our Yeti bro ripped a huge fart, mixed with spermicle slushyseed shaft-spit shit. So girls, when you're in a pretty, lightly snowy environment next time, remember when you try to catch a snowflake with your toungue, you're fulfilling our friend, Mr. Yeti's dream by tasting his freeze-dried fuck-stick flow. MMMMmmm... Good stuff huh babes? Yeti Yums melt in your mouth don't they? Okay folks... 'til the next movie review, I'll leave you with 3 spanks on my left ass cheek, 7 scrotal sac scratches, 2 smacks on my monitor screen with my snatch splitter, and a big fart... followed by a smaller, higher pitched one. BOOOOOMMMTTHHT.... blriiiieeeeaaap. That's how it sounded. Take care and remember Mr. Yeti girls!!!"

Eco-vomit. A catastrophe movie with actors that know in their heart that Charlie Sheen is ""WINNING"". The script is very much like an interview with Scheeny. A bit of drivel, a great deal of pompous lies, with a lot of stupidity. How bad is it? It's ALMOST bad enough to be entertaining but not quite. 
There doesn't seem to be a reason for it's plot except to pander to someone who doesn't know enough science to comprehend real issues but likes to scare themselves with ""horror from space"". There IS some emotional melodrama through the same plot lines that make getting crap on your shoe when getting into a clean car the worst part of daily reflection. You come away from the movie wondering WHY someone made it."
