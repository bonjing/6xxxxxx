Personnel:
Solo performer: Joe Callicott (acoustic guitar)

Notes: AIN'T GONNA LIE TO YOU includes the last recordings Joe Callicott made before his death in 1969.
For most of his career, the Mississippi guitarist Joe Callicott performed with the better-known Garfield Akers, until Akers' death in 1959. After then, Callicott lapsed into obscurity until just before his death in 1969, when he was recorded by the blues archivist George Mitchell. Mitchell's recordings show Callicott's style to be a forerunner of the more pastoral folk blues made popular by such younger players as Taj Mahal, Guy Davis, and Corey Harris. Callicott's versions of classics such as "Fare Thee Well" and "Roll and Tumble" display an agreeable baritone vocal style as well as accomplished, subtly percussive guitar technique.
