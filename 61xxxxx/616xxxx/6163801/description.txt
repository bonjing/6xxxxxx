Finally, a MASH release without canned laughter. Ripped by me personally in high quality h.264, these episodes come straight from the UK DVD box set.


Watch using VLC, or any other media player that supports MKV/h.264 (all the decent codec packs support it).

So far the first and second season are up, I'll be doing 3 and 4 as soon as I have a spare day.
