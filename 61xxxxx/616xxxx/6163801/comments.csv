,joeoshawa,2011-04-11T14:45Z,Downloaded this torrent and will be downloading the rest. I signed up just to say thanks and if i can seed living in a place with 2 isp's and severe bandwidth caps you can too. Great job and if the other torrents are as good i vote for you to be upgraded to trusted. Cannot comment on virus status i am a linux user.
,joeoshawa,2011-04-11T14:46Z,and seed comment was to other torrent users not the poster thanks again.
