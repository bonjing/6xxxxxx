An ex-con sets out to avenge his brother's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago. During his campaign, however, he's tracked by a veteran cop and an egocentric hit man. 
A stint in prison usually has one of two effects on a man â€“ it either breaks him down or makes him stronger. For Driver (Dwayne Johnson), a 15-year sentence proved the latter. His strength was not just fueled by time, but also by a hunger to avenge the murder of his brother during the botched bank robbery that led to his own imprisonment. Untouchable on the â€˜inside,â€™ he made plenty of enemies in prison - men who were counting the days until his release so they could exact their own revenge on the outside. Now, on the day of his release, he is hell-bent on reaping vengeance upon the four men responsible for his brotherâ€™s murder. With a list of names and addresses in hand, he sprints out of the prison gates and is immediately on his mission.
