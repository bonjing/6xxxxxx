[S],velvet.,2011-02-10T10:18Z,"Hopefully, some day you will become smart enough to realize that creating a single 64 GB torrent is an extremely dumb thing to do.

No one is ever likely to help you seed a torrent that large."
,drknark83,2011-02-10T11:00Z,"You don't like it, don't download it. This is what I wanted when I got back into comics, so I figure there are others who want the same thing."
,kazaccscan,2011-02-10T12:55Z,"Dear Velvet: Hopefully, some day you will become smart enough to realize that posting such a comment just shows how dumb and arrogant unevolved people can be.
You see, homo sapiens logonsii have learned that you can choose what files within a torrent you want to download.
You, and the rest of homo pretorrentius, will simply become extinct still believing 'no one is ever likely to help you seed a torrent that large' (if not from bleeding through the knuckles dragging on the ground).

It would be appreciated if you didn't slag people off for trying - turn the candle off on the way out, thanks ... "
,drknark83,2011-02-10T14:29Z,"Indeed you are correct, good point. As long as people seed what they do grab everything will be fine. 

And I will be seeding this for quite some time, because like i said, i want to give something back.

Some of this stuff was hard to find, here you are able to get it all in one easy to find place."
,Robert012488,2011-02-10T14:39Z,"Hi: I find that with Large Torrents; you can pick and choose what you want; plus the seeders will be generally there 24/7.. whereas on smaller torrents, the seeders sometimes disappear and never come back.... then the part files you downloaded are of no value at all. 
Since I have some of these; I will see if they  are the same size as the seeder has; if they are; I can load them into the Folder, do a recheck, and help him seed"
,drknark83,2011-02-10T15:50Z,"Thanks alot man, that'd be appreciated. My upstream is pretty beefy so it should be ok, but help is always appreciated.

Also, anyone who is able to is welcome to upload the torrent to other trackers, the more peers the better."
,slackator,2011-02-11T09:08Z,Thanks this has quite a few that Ive been trying to find forever but never could. Due to its size Ill definitely have to get it by piecework but I will seed what I can for as long as I can
,drknark83,2011-02-12T21:17Z,"Thanks, all seeding is appreciated. 

On another note, does anyone have or know where one could get the Giant Size Spiderman series? It is the only one I know of that's missing from here. I would love you if you would put up a torrent with it ;)"
,drknark83,2011-02-12T22:37Z,"Oh, it seems I am also missing Webspinners Tales of Spider-Man, anyone? :)"
,drknark83,2011-02-13T12:17Z,"I managed to find the two missing series, now available:
Giant Size Spiderman: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6171413
Webspinners Tales of Spiderman: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6171417

With this torrent and those two you will have all series listed as core titles here: http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/core.html"
,timyadeadhomie,2011-02-15T07:10Z,"Wow, there's so much here I want to grab but I don't have space for...."
,drknark83,2011-02-15T12:12Z,"Don't let the seed number here fool you, the swarm is doing pretty well. There are lots of seeds via peer exchange and such that are not tracked here."
,ani1993,2011-03-02T00:23Z,"hi, this seems like the best torrent i'v found so far but can any one tell me, is it possible to go inside the different  folders and choose what to download or do i have to accept entire large folders as different packages? 
Also, can I seed the torrent if i only download small parts of it at a time? 
I havent tried such large torrents before so PLEASE help me out guys! Thnx...."
,drknark83,2011-03-02T17:28Z,"Yes, you can select single files. How you do this will depend on which client you use, but normally you uncheck the folder and then click the ""+"" button to expand it, and then you select the files you want.

There should also be a ""Select None"" button to unselect all files in the torrent, after which you can select the files you do want.

And yes, you can seed the parts you download even if you don't download the whole thing. All clients I have seen do this automatically."
,ani1993,2011-03-03T02:10Z,"WOW... I cant  belive i didnt notice that before!!! *takes right hand and smacks head* just, wow!!! thnx!!!"
,ani1993,2011-03-03T02:23Z,"WOW... I can't belive i never noticed that before!!! *Takes right hand and smacks his head ""Thud""* Just WOW!!! Thankx man, this helps out a lot! Now if u could tell me how to go back to the file selection screen after i've downloaded the torrent then it would be heaven! Btw great torrent. :D"
,ani1993,2011-03-03T02:25Z,"WOW... I can't belive i never noticed that before!!! *Takes right hand and smacks his head ""Thud""*

 Thankx man, this helps out a lot! Now if u could tell me how to go back to the file selection screen after i've downloaded the torrent then it would be heaven!

,ani1993,2011-03-03T02:34Z,"HeHe, sry 'bout the double post..."
,drknark83,2011-03-03T21:14Z,"I don't know which client you use, but in uTorrent you just select the torrent, then select the files tab in the bottom window. You can then right click on the files and select normal priority to download them."
,ani1993,2011-03-05T02:12Z,"Oh, yeah now i see it, thnx!"
,shyy71,2011-03-15T08:37Z,"wow thats a huge work man, thats an incredible choice of precious pearls that you offer to us
its like picking in a 5 stars self service

Merci beaucoup drknark83 !! :)"
,NinpoLore,2011-03-31T12:51Z,"Feckin' awesome, man! Yeah, the file size is daunting, and it's a bit of a slog digging through the folders checking which ones you want, but it's sooo worth the effort. There is some older stuff here in the ""Marvel Major Events Chronology"" folder that blew my mind. Death of Gwen Stacy? Original Galactus Saga? Sweet. Kudos. :D"
,cartman19987,2011-04-16T23:40Z,"Thank you! I just grabbed a few that I wanted, and I'll seed those for a while."

,TheHottuB,2012-03-13T00:47Z,"I would just like to say that I downloaded this about 6 months ago after not buying or reading comics in 10 years. Now, because of this torrent, I have been buying comics again. Even the ones that are in this torrent. This may be first time I downloaded a torrent and liked it so much I had to buy. 

Great torrent."
