First add the torrent to your client but in a stopped state, so that you don't start downloading the stupid padding files. Then click the files tab. Click the path column, to order them alphabetically, getting all the padding files lined up, probably at the beginning. Finally select all of them, right-click and select ""Don't Download"" to skip them. NOW start the download. End of story. Instead of hundreds of these little files you get only one ""remainder"" file that utorrent creates.

But it gets even better. When you're done with the torrent (download, seed, whatever) you delete the torrent and even the remainder file is gone. Problem solved!

PS Copy-paste this comment everywhere you see a torrent with padding files, so that users of regular clients can deal with these torrents."
