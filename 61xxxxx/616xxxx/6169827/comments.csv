,rhysporter,2011-12-07T05:08Z,"You probably have OSX Lion Installed - this uses Rosetta to run via the old style of code, and it won't work unfortunately. 

You'll need to install OSX Snow leopard to a USB and run the game from there. "
,sharloch,2012-03-23T08:15Z,dose any one has aerofly 5... the all new version??
,headvoice42,2012-05-08T07:29Z,Seem it supports only the Intel Macs. I may have that wrong but it sure won't work here on a G5 PPC.
