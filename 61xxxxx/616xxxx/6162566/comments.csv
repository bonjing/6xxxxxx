,dark_defender,2011-02-09T15:47Z,Did someone request this? I am sure you must be knowing Friends has been uploaded recently by someone else..all seasons-small size. I am sure you must have your reason..Just curious.
,nitish29,2011-02-09T16:03Z,wow thanks buddy :)
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-09T16:11Z,"@dark_defender: Nope, it's wide screen TNT Europe HiDef broadcast from this weekend. All other encodes I have were old full screen (4:3) or DVDrips."
,skillet92,2011-02-09T16:24Z,"So are u telling you are gonna upload it like occasionally ?
Jus curious! "
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-09T16:57Z,"@skillet92: No, interest is non-existent. People do not want to see early days of Friends in 720p."

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-10T06:51Z,"@appollo33  & @Wycis : As I said - I don't think that I would. BTW. airing  is was hairy - video IS nice, but audio is well below today's standards."
,kawmic77,2011-02-10T10:06Z,"could you please upload the lot, this is way better than dvd- quality?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-10T11:36Z,"ERR.

Sorry.

,coffeeboy2k,2011-02-13T14:33Z,"Kinda late seeing this. Thanks so much for this upload. Too bad not much interest. Well, hope you change your mind about posting the others. Maybe there's little interest because people don't know there's a 720p version of the show now. Can't wait to see this in HD!"
,xtvst,2011-07-08T02:53Z,"It's absolutely amazing to have Friends in HD!
Although the video is accelerated (the sound is a little squeky). I wonder if this gone to air like this or it's an encoding missconfig..."
