*** Sandboxed IE Browsers from Spoon ***

Back in November, spoon.net removed their sandboxed IE browsers (http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/windows-server/microsoft-squashes-ie-on-spoon-users-tweet-their-displeasure/), leaving web developers everywhere rather unsatisfied.

As many know, the spoon.net sandboxed browsers were the most reliable* browsers, aside from using IE versions in separate VMs.

It has now been three months and we're seen no movement from spoon or msft. So, it's time to share these.

These are sandboxed exe's from back when spoon.net was called Xenocode. You can run them in parallel. They are functionally identical to the true browsers

*Mr. "Steve" has commented (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/02/01/html5-and-web-video-questions-for-the-industry-from-the-community.aspx#10123662) on tons of IEBlog posts, and quickly summarizes why the spoon.net browsers are the easiest way to test cross-browser:
-- Multiple IEs - IE8 breaks the functionality of IE6's textboxes.
-- ETester - works great until you need to test print preview or popup interaction and then it fails.
-- Virtual PC with timebombed images of IE6, IE7, IE8 - works, but the 12GB of HD space needed is frustrating when each full image of Windows dies 4 times a year, running a full Windows image is slow and you have to beg for updates because the releases are not co-ordinated and announced well at all.
-- IE Super Preview - does not allow full testing of IE user interaction, JavaScript DOM changes, popups etc.
-- Multiple PC's to run multiple versions of windows and IE. With all the hardware, software, and physical space needed. Ha!
-- Spoon.net IEs - They work, they work just like local native apps once running, and there's no hacking of my real local IE install.
