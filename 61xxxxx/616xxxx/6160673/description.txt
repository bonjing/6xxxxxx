Personnel:

Virgil Thrasher - Harmonica
David Scoll - Washtub Bass


Notes: For the most part Lowery's music is an attractive amalgam of generic and individual elements. Thrasher's harmonica (who is an excellent harmonica player) has more space on this album too. Album contain several songs whose familiar titles mislead you into expecting familiar lyrics.


proper blues...good as it gets...
