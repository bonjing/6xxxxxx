Cooking the West African Way | PDF | 71 pages 

Cooking the West African Way is a great introduction to cooking food from West Africa. This cookbook contains recipes from Nigeria, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Togo, and Benin. The authors carefully explain the food culture of West Africa. For example, how many Eat Africans only eat a couple of times a day and eat very fresh food due to the lack of electricity and refrigeration. 


This book is geared to Americans who want to learn to make West African recipes so the recipes use American measurements, utensils, and methods. There are two sample dinner menus in this cookbook along with the shopping list for each dinner menu. Cooking the West African Way includes basic cooking instructions and explanations of cooking equipment, terms, safety, special ingredients, along with low-fat cooking tips and metric conversions. 

Cooking the West African Way includes the following recipes: 

* Fufu 
* Sweet Potato Fritters (Ntomo Krako) 
* Groundnut Sauce 
* Akara 
* Groundnut Balls (Kulikuli) 
* Coconut Crisps 
* Sweet Balls (From Ghana)

* Chicken Yassa (Yassa au Poulet)

This is a great starting cookbook for West African cooking. There are color pictures for almost every recipe along with clear instructions and cultural explanations. 

The fufu recipe in Cooking the West African Way is rather disappointing since the recipe calls for cream of wheat and mashed potato flakes instead of casava or yams.
