,_CVX_,2011-03-17T00:30Z,"this is a rip, it is not an installer, this is for playign the base game only, if u want expansions find a torrent for the installlation,

this was made from the razor1911 ISO

,Lovely02,2011-05-07T08:25Z,"Just registered to get some help. When I try to open the Launcher, there's a pop-up saying that
""This application has failed to start because d3dx9_31.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.""

@Lovely02

@glad08

I dont know what your talking about sorry

@kaara8722

if you wanted expansions use the ISO i made this rip from it can be found here

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED.5022393.TPB.torrent"
,anonymous4321,2011-06-03T15:00Z,"First off, THANKS - it worked great.
But I'd like to add, this rip is not only for noobs (which I am not), it works great for people who might not have a 5gb plus DVD to save the ISO to and who do not want to run out and spend $15 to be able to use something they planned on getting free."
,Ri4Ri4y,2011-06-03T23:39Z,"Hi! What I must to do when it show me - Unable to start game. Service initialization failed (0x024e424f)
Thanx!"
,_CVX_,2011-06-14T01:40Z,"@anonymous4321

If i had used an ISO all u have to do is mount it via deamon tools or extract its contents with 7-zip

where is the DVD required?

if u cant mount an ISO, and need to burn them to use them then i think you might be a noob in the ISO department, please take a look at deamon tools

@Ri4Ri4y
I never got that error and to me its saying that the application has failed to luanch something try reinstalling or just use the ISO i linked to

,Lol102938,2011-07-17T09:37Z,hi i have installed direct x 9 what do i do know could i please have some help from somebody ?
,ac92,2011-07-20T13:00Z,How come it only takes 4 GB? It should be 6 GB
,ac92,2011-07-23T21:29Z,very good torrent works perfectly
,menzoe954,2011-07-24T08:29Z,Hey I would REALLY appreciate the help since im a total noob when it comes to ISOs..how do i apply the torrent you posted (Sims 3 Raxor1911 final MAXSPEED)?? and is that so I can also apply the expansions and other good stuff? I already d/l PowerISO but i really dont know what to do next! Please helpp!!
,menzoe954,2011-07-24T09:39Z,btw this torrent works perfectly! I would just like to add the expansion packs to this if it is possible. please help!
,Brienen,2011-07-26T06:49Z,"I need some help. I used the ISO you linked me to, which I cannot find in the user's list when searched anymore. Mounted, installed. Nothing in the torrent but the image, so I opened the files in the ISO with Daemon Tools, and found a keygen file in there. Upon running said ""keygen"", McAfee informed me that a Trojan was in my computer now, and I should restart. I haven't yet, I will system restore if need be.

That failing, I DLd a new keygen from elsewhere onthe site, and actually got the game to install. BUT upon running it, everything goes normal util town selection, where I get the prompt ""Disc Authorization Failed - We are unable to verify that your disc is a valid copy of The Sims 3. Please contact Customer Service""

How do I fix this? And was the virus in the link real? If so, expect some ramifications from this, its bullshit."
,Brienen,2011-07-26T06:58Z,"In hindsight, there is a crack file, which I have no idea what to do with. It is an application that will not open."
,dandelionjoker,2011-07-28T14:01Z,hi can u add mods on to this game? plz let me knw thanks
,kaneknife,2011-07-30T07:10Z,how do i put custom content..? I added a Downloads folder since there wasnt one and nothing i put in there appears in game :/
,nberendson,2011-07-30T15:20Z,"I downloaded the RIP and that all worked fine. But when I opened the game, it was all in Russian. I tried changing it through the Start-Run-Regedit process but nothing turns up in the Sims 3 file that allows me to change the language. I need help!"
,_CVX_,2011-08-04T17:39Z,"This is a RIP basically anything uneccesary is removed

and this also includes a painfull ylong installation process

all u do is extract and play

being a RIP alot of things the Expansions depend on wont be there

so get the  Razor911 ISO and install that one (delete this torrent it will be useless if u install with the ISO)

as for failing to start

open the game folder and look under bin for the launcher sims3.exe or watever and use that

as for the RUSSIAN language issue, i have no idea why that has happened i think the game is auto-detecting that language on your PC"
,JellyFaceJade93No1,2011-08-11T19:13Z,"_CVX_ 
Thanks for posting that link helped a lot :D"
,iheartslb,2011-08-15T23:44Z,"Okay, I love you for this, but I know I can't use expansion packs with this.. can I use custom content, and if so, how?"
,amberbrowncrayon,2011-08-16T20:20Z,Well I'm downloading but this is my first attempt at downloading a game torrent and I'm wingin' it on the advice from these comments. Thanks (:
,_CVX_,2011-09-02T22:31Z,"Just download and extract then play, and leave the torrent to seed to others, you will know when the torrent is finished, good luck "
,Saint923,2011-09-07T18:08Z,"Although I appreciate your efforts to make things easier on non-computer savvy folks, I wanna point out its a little rude how many times you state that this is for ""idiots"". A fish will go it's whole life believing it's an idiot if it's judged on it's ability to climb a tree. In other words, some people are most certainly not idiots, but are not familiar with technical operations. Perhaps no one has ever shown them, so they're intimidated by all the different terms that they do not know?  
..Or maybe its just me."
,Saint923,2011-09-07T18:09Z,"Regardless, I'll seed for a day or three."
,_CVX_,2011-09-08T05:48Z,"i never called anyone an idiot and i only used ""noob"" because it is a common term for uneducated/new people

uneducated doe snot mean they are stupid just they have not been taught something

and all my torrents are made to take something and make it simple, such as cracking games etc"
