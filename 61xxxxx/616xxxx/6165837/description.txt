This is one of the most fantastic adventure games ever made. It is heavily underrated, probably due to its unforgiving difficulty.
As the title suggests, it is rather bizarre, with an unconventional taste of humor. Soon, the atmosphere of the game leads emotions to acquire the same shades that compose the cartoony graphics, unsettling ambience music and dialogs that make the adventure less virtual.
The player will need lots of hours to finish this one and often get (very) frustrated, only to experience great moments of self-esteem after solving the puzzles and mysteries of the strange world held within this creation of zany imagination...
Be aware, it has some mild adult content.
