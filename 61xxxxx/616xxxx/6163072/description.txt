 Arguably the best television series ever produced, and certainly the best soap
 opera ever produced, Dallas had it all. Beautiful women, expensive cars, and
 men playing Monopoly with real buildings. It had the best trans-season cliff-
 hanger in history that had the whole world asking "Who shot J.R.?" Dallas is
 an important part of American History, if not world history.
