With UK top ten hits by Diana Ross (Upside down, My old piano), Teena Marie (Behind the groove), Billy Preston and Syreeta (With you I'm born again), the Commodores (Still) and Jermaine Jackson (Let's get serious), this compilation shows that Motown were still a force to be reckoned with as the seventies ended and the eighties began.

Several of the tracks here missed the UK charts but are still worth hearing. Cruising (Smokey Robinson) was an American top five hit although it missed the British charts. I don't know if it was released as a UK single, but it's a great song anyway.

This is a great compilation highlighting the music coming out of Motown as the seventies gave way to the eighties.
