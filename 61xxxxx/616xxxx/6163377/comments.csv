He is however wrong, there are many more, the most important one being that they don't pray to God our Creator - Jesus Christ but to the moongod."

@ Tickles. Just because your views & beliefs differ from other people, does not warrant you to be intolerant and mean towards other religions. Bigot."
[V],joshua13,2011-02-16T05:35Z,"since this works about to be about 1.6 errors per verse, this seems a bit ridiculous. (verses are typically a sentence or two)

Even counting all theological statements as errors you would not find that many different things that could be called errors."

Hardly convincing.  I would love it if someone could explain the contradictions in the scriptures. Every attempt I have seen, so far, is an insult to my intelligence."
