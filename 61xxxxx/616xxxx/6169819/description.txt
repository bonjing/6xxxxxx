The Odyssey (1997)

This expansive television mini-series production of Homer's epic poem is a mix of fine acting and terrific special effects. The arrogant but honorable Odysseus (Armand Assante) and his loyal crew begin their voyage home from the Trojan War, but the gods have a score to settle with Odysseus. The story follows the ten-year ordeal of Odysseus from his battles with the Cyclops and the magical Circe (Bernadette Peters) to his secret homecoming and his confrontation with the treacherous Eurymachus (Eric Roberts). Isabella Rossellini appears as his spiritual guide, the goddess Athena, with Greta Scacchi as Odysseus's faithful wife and Vanessa Williams as the seductive Calypso. The rest of the cast includes Geraldine Chaplin, Jeroen KrabbÃ©, Christopher Lee, and Irene Papas.
