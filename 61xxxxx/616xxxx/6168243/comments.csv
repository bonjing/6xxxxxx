,raindr0ps,2011-02-13T00:26Z,"WTF? What did they do, put all these so-called ebooks in a RAR. If someone dl's this torrent, would you please come back here with a list of what it is or if it is really what it claims to be?"
,UNDER8ED,2011-02-13T06:41Z,"I did a Screen Capture for those of you curios to see what's in this torrent... If I am going too fast for you, after you click on play--click on the + sign to zoom in, and when you wish to stop so you can read all titles under a particular letter; just press pause while viewing the screen capture video.. Hope this helps. 

Here's the link:
