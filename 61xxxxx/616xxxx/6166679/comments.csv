[T],murdoc47,2011-06-30T09:42Z,"no screens, but i won't stop anyone willing to upload some.."
,ADCC,2012-05-28T20:54Z,"Excellent upload, best quality, thank you murdoc47. The only drawback is that it is the 186min version, and not the 215min version."
[T],murdoc47,2012-06-09T23:59Z,"this IS the best version, the director's cut. the only difference between this and the ultimate cut is the comic book pirate cartoon part, which doesn't really have anything to do with the storyline. and you can also download it separately.
so, in my own professional opinion, THIS is the one to see! have fun watching!"
