Folk singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn often wrote about his Christian faith in the 70s, but in a non-preachy way that emphasised his care for fellow humankind. His songs became more political in the 80s, most notably when he released the angry "If I Had A Rocket Launcher" after visiting a Guatamalan refugee camp on behalf of Oxfam. Though Cockburn has always been popular in his native Canada - he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2001 - he has struggled to find an audience elsewhere, peaking with a No.21 placing in the US Hot 100 with 1979 single "Wondering Where The Lions Are".
