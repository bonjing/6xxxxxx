,jvezirian,2011-04-29T00:48Z,"Hey Tim.....

Question and or if anyone else has an answer.. Does the game play into the other chapters indicated. When I first started there were 3 windows with regards to downloadable content. I believe these were for the additional chapters and or play areas. Can they be directly accessed, or are they essentially expansion packs."
[T],tim2251337x,2011-04-29T01:05Z,"jvezirian ,yea,no installing at all.
No registry entries. 
Just unpack and play.
It even creates the documents folder the first time you play it(for saves and such)
It also works perfectly on win7 64bit,because that's what I made and tested it on.
  Have fun with it guys and please seed.......PEACE"
[T],tim2251337x,2011-04-29T01:13Z,"they are expansion packs,or add on's,that are already installed into this game,and it's version 1.41 which will probably be the last.
borderlands 2 is in the making from what I hear,so this is probably the last of the dlc's  for this one.lol"

,tacoman1,2011-05-09T13:15Z,"Great Upload!  it's a RAR file and all you have to do is extract and go into the directory:

,dwatson,2011-05-13T12:49Z,"is there a way of making it not take about 15 minutes just to start the game up from the .exe in the rar file?? its getting very boring! or does the goty edition work online, i think i'd rather have it installed and have it start when i want than have direct play and have to wait for it."
,dwatson,2011-05-13T14:52Z,"@ tim2251337
right, i know this is a massive ask but is it possible to copy any files from this rar archive into the install dir. of my current installed version to make THAT one work online?  if so, what files will they be?"
,Sixpirate,2011-05-14T13:45Z,"From all the comments I hear it's great! Going to start now. 
Someone said something about 30 hours? 30 hours to Unzip it? Lol.

And another comment said ""15 minutes to start up the game.""
Maybe you have a bad processor? "
[T],tim2251337x,2011-05-14T16:13Z,"dwatson are you trying to start the game from within the 'rar',because that would take several minutes to extract the .exe for it to start???

Otherwise if you unpack the whole thing into a folder it works instantly upon clicking the borderlands.exe.

Inside the rar is the 'DIRECTX"" folder and a 'PHYSX"" folder,run the setup.exe in both two folders before playing and you will have no missing files.

The multiplayer works perfectly.

It's already updated to the latest version,nothing needs to be added to this,or altered.

It does take about 20min or so, to unpack(it's a pretty big game).

If these simple things are done,it works perfectly on xp,vista and win7

also, every time i play multiplayer, me and my friends can only play a little bit before we get disconnected from gamespy and can't reconnect after. anybody else have this problem? we can still play but not voice chat or text chat"
,Velo_816,2011-06-29T04:26Z,"@arwing789

That sounds like a video card problem, man. Make sure your drivers are all up to date etc.

If not it's possible that it could be giving out.

As for the online play... I think that's on Gamespy's end. Every game I've joined has been horribly laggy to the point where I just leave due to delay with aiming/shooting and everything else. I'd say it could be me but... my internet is more than capable of a stable connection."

,kelvdawg,2011-10-02T04:45Z,downloads and works fine but after playing for a bit i cant advance pass rust commons east cause i cant get another plot mission
[T],tim2251337x,2011-10-02T19:11Z,"OK guys,their are apparently a few possible probs(but not with the game).
The first thing to do is get your video drivers updated to the latest(very important)
The DIRECTX and PHYSX must be installed,or you get the D9X... or PHX.....error(they are included in the download as self-titled folders)or get them from MS and NVIDIA's websites.
Extract ALL folders from the RAR archive(DO NOT TRY TO RUN THE GAME FROM INSIDE THE RAR ARCHIVE).
Once the files have been extracted and updates done,open the BINARIES FOLDER and run BORDERLANDS.EXE.
The game should run perfectly,if not there are user issues...
Also,DO NOT mess with any DLC folders you may see...They are already installed and tested 100%(played thru complete)
The online feature works fine.
If there are any video probs,,,try dropping the resolution.
Do Not Run Any  Other Programs While Extracting(very important).
This works on XP,Vista and 7(MAKE SURE TO HAVE TE LATEST UPDATES AND SERVICE PACKS)
The game is also the latest version made,so no need to try and update(version 1.4)

I hope this info helps any and all probs

,resi117,2011-10-06T13:44Z,"when i click the .exe, the borderlands sysbol come up then it closes, saying protection error any ideas what this is and how to fix it?"
,coveredindyes,2011-10-07T16:58Z,"To fix problems with content failing to extract and or content that shows up corrupted and also to solve the protection error do the following;

1. Download 7zip for your appropriate version of Windows. http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

2. delete the previous extracted files. ex: c:\program files (X86)\bitlord\downloads\borderlands.. etc.\borderlands etc.. (DO NOT DELETE THE files you downloaded via your torrent program)

3. unzip the zipped content using 7zip.. (Do not use any other program, including winrar!)

4. when it finishes unzipping (you should have no errors), install the physx update and the direct x update via their folders.

5. Now you can run borderlands.exe (application file) in the binary folder.

I spent too much time with this to only realize that it's 7zips fault. So, you should be good. Enjoy the game! :)"

You need to install DirectX and PhysX included in this torrent before starting to play.

Simply download, extract, and run. All 4 dlc's pre-loaded, no cracks, literally just double click and you're into the game.
