,prag16,2011-02-09T23:06Z,I've never downloaded anything but an iso before.  Any special instructions since this is a .wbfs file?
,Zazn,2011-02-11T02:17Z,Haven't test it it yet (still downloading).  WBFS files you need to use a manager to put it on to your external USB hard drive or burn it to a disk.  Just google up WBFS manager and you should find a couple.
,Zazn,2011-02-16T01:24Z,"Tested and it works.  What i did with the WBFS file was use ""Wii Backup Manager""

First click on Drive 1 or Drive 2 and load your hard drive, then click on the file (first tab) and load your WBFS file.  Next, click transfer>Drive 1 (or drive 2 depending on which one you loaded on).  Done.

If you want to burn to a disc, then load the WBFS file.  Then, click transfer and then ISO.  It should make you a ISO which you can burn.

Thanks for the upload!"

,skadragon,2011-02-21T04:55Z,"To play WBFS files just put them in /wbfs/""GameTitle""/ on the root of the drive you use to play wii games. make sure the wbfs file is named only the the game title code eg. SKJE78.wbfs.

eg.
/wbfs/You Dont Know Jack [SKJE78]/SKJE78.wbfs

Backup managers do this for you. but if it's already a wbfs file you can do it yourself. If you use Configurable USB Loader you should already have a /wbfs/ folder."
,Powerslave0,2011-03-02T06:03Z,Can use wbfs to ISO program to convert it to a burnable ISO file.
