      The great winter constellation of Orion is easily visible,
      with its ruby red star Betelgeuse and distinctive shape. It is
      also home to the Orion nebula, our nearest stellar nursery,
      where thousands of stars are being born. Sir Patrick Moore and
      the Sky at Night team take us on a tour of this magnificent
      constellation and its jewels.
