- "People Are Determined to Stay Until Mubarak Leaves": Democracy Now!'s Sharif Abdel Kouddous Reports in Cairo on the Three-Week Long Egyptian Pro-Democracy Protests

The pro-democracy protests in Egypt have entered their third week as demonstrators are holding another massive protest in Tahrir Square. While Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is refusing to resign, the German magazine Der Spiegel is reporting that preparations are under way for him to possibly leave Egypt and visit Germany for an "extended medical check-up." Human Rights Watch is reporting 297 people have died over the past two weeks of protests, an estimate far higher than the Egyptian government has acknowledged.


- Asmaa Mahfouz & the YouTube Video that Helped Spark the Egyptian Uprising

Three weeks ago today, 26-year-old Egyptian activist Asmaa Mahfouz posted a video online urging people to protest the "corrupt government" of Hosni Mubarark by rallying in Tahrir Square on January 25. Her moving call, ultimately, helped inspire Egypt's uprising. "I, a girl, am going down to Tahrir Square, and I will stand alone. And I will hold up a banner, perhaps people will show some honor," Mahfouz said. "...Don't think you can be safe any more. None of us are. Come down with us and demand your rights, my rights, your family's rights. I am going down on January 25th, and will say 'No to corruption. No to this regime.'"


- "The Heroes Are The Ones In The Street": Google Exec and Facebook Activist Wael Ghoneim on His Release After 12 Days in Egyptian Jail

Twelve days after being snatched from the streets of Cairo, Wael Ghoneim was released Monday from secret detention. He is being hailed as a hero by the pro-democracy now movement for administrating a Facebook page key to organizing Egypt's unprecedented pro-democracy uprising. In his first interview after being released, Ghoneim told Egyptian TV, "I never put my live in danger while I was typing away on the Internet. The heroes are the ones in the streets. This revolution belongs to the Internet youth."


- Shooting the Messenger: Egyptian Journalist Shot Dead By Sniper While Covering Cairo Protests

The only journalist known to have been killed during the Egyptian uprising was honored Monday in Cairo. Ahmed Mohammed Mahmoud was a reporter for the state-owned newspaper Al Tawuun. He was shot January 28 when he tried to use his phone to film riot police as they fired tear gas canisters at protesters. He spent a week in the hospital before he died on February 4. On Monday, journalists, family and friends held a symbolic funeral in Cairo, marching from the Journalists' Syndicate to Tahrir Square holding an empty coffin. We speak to Al Jazeera English producer and writer Laila Al-Arian who has just returned from Cairo where she interviewed Mahmoud's widow.


- Detained Al Jazeera Journalist: "The military] viewed so many of us prisoners of war. Our hands were tied behind our back with cables. Our eyes were blindfolded."

Ayman Mohyeldin, the Cairo bureau chief for Al Jazeera, was detained by Egyptian police and was held for seven hours. Inside the jail, Mohyeldin witnessed rampant police abuse. "We saw the military slap detainees, we saw them kick detainees, we saw them punch them," Mohyeldin said. "One of the soldiers I was observing had with him a small taser gun." He also talks about how the Mubarak regime has attempted to silence Al Jazeera. Despite its journalists being arrested and threatened, it's offices set on fire and it's satellite system cut off, Al Jazeera's news coverage of the popular uprising has been unchallenged by other news outlets, and is battling Egypt's pro-Mubarak TV outlets for delivering truth to Egyptians. "I think Al Jazeera Arabic and out Jazeera English have something important to offer. They're offering viewers around the world a contact that may sometimes be missing from Western and foreign media," says Ayman Mohyeldin. "More importantly, they're offering the viewers a view of this country that I think is very hard to get an absence of less and less media. If they were it take Al Jazeera off the air and silence was complete, it would be a great disservice to humanity to get information."
