live the dream, buddy!

ps. i'm glad you get to use your ea-drm account every time EA releases a game - remember when you said you have a programmer friend at EA who ""told you"" the dead space 2 DRM was going to take at least 2 months to crack but then it ended up only taking 2 days? goodtimes, buddy!"

Mine is no longer freezing on the loading screen but I don't have any picture after the loading is done. NOTE I had to do the opposite I changed the 0 to a 1 and it finally loaded. 

I have just a blue screen with random colors and the normal Crysis HUD and audio works but nothing else, looks like the game is artifacting.

I load up just fine as long as the shader thing is 1 instead of 0 but the screen is just a weird collection of colors, its not rendering properly and I keep getting a RED error (Temporary memory out of budget) in the top right corner.
