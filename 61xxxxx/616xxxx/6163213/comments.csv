,WunderSpazz,2011-03-07T19:58Z,"How does one get the actual flight sim scenery database to reflect these changes?  I may be wrong, but aren't I just updating individual plane's FMSes with points that may or may not actually exist in flight sim?  I mean I have a crazy hodgepodge of scenery reflecting the real world at many different times.  How do I make it all uniform?  Any help would be appreciated.  "
