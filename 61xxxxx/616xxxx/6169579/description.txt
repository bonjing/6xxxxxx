Object of the game
------------------

The object of the game is to get a monopoly level market share in a market
that starts out with considerable competition.

To win:
	If there are 2 players remaining:	70% of the market
	If there are 3 players remaining:	65% of the market
	If there are 4 players remaining:	60% of the market
	If there are 5-8 players remaining:	55% of the market

The winning conditions go into play after the 5th year and is evaluated on the
last day of the year.  So having 90% of the market in June means nothing, it's
how much you have at the end of the year that counts.  Your market share resets
itself at the beginning of the year.
