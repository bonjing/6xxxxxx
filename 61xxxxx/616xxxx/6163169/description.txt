
Dungeons - Patch 1.0.0.1 to 1.1.1.0 + DLC
works without crack
------------------------------------------

I'm using the Dungeons-FLT uploaded by extremezone


1.) backup your original KalypsoLauncher.dll

2.) your savegames will not work with the new patch
    So first you finish the old level, then patch the game, then start the new level.
	I've played lvl4, patched and had to start lvl4 again, so not a bit thing as you'll 
	get much more Talent Points thanks to rebalance :D

3.) install the patch

4.) copy the original KalypsoLauncher.dll back to replace new one
	either from your backup or from the torrent the one
	thats pretty much the crack part :]

5.) copy the dlc folder to your Game Directory
Default is:  *:/Documents and Settings\"User"\Local Settings\Application Data\Apps\Kalypso Media\Dungeons

6.) play 



** No intro fix 
*:/Documents and Settings\"User"\Application Data\Kalypso Media\Dungeons\config.cfg

    In Video.showIntro = false
