,kyp0001,2011-02-10T02:43Z,You do!
,Balguren,2011-02-10T03:13Z,Your a god send Kyp now all we need is the most recient one that hopefully fully fixes the gamer :) Great Job.
,Venomko,2011-02-10T04:52Z,"@kyp0001

Thanks, one more question - is the famous ""i can't get past third-fourth level"" bug fixed? ( i think it was third level, at least i was stuck after the second town i think )"
,dopeydave420,2011-02-10T05:23Z,"anybody not able to download the torrent i get a werid message , ""no input file specified"" , and the toher torrent for this is stuck at 98.8 % like the other 100 people dl'ing it"
,dopeydave420,2011-02-10T05:25Z,"nm, got magnet link workin."
,kyp0001,2011-02-10T12:10Z,"There are still multiple bugs after you'll play with 1.1.1.0; seems like they rushed the game a bit. 

If you get stuck reload a savegame and pray or restart the mission and pray :D
Got stuck twice now"
,stentehman,2011-02-10T12:26Z,"I recently installed the Dungeons FLT torrent and it works great so far, there is just 1 problem.
if I install the game it immediately starts with the version 1.0.0.1 and not just with 1.0.
i was about to use some cheats in the future but it won't let me because i'm beyond the 1.0 version of the game.
Next to that if i try to patch it it says : The cabinet file 'PCW_CAB_MNPapps' required for this installation is corrupt and cannot be used while it's fully downloaded and not seeding or what so ever.
Any suggestions? (:"
,stentehman,2011-02-10T12:45Z,what's the problem with deleting my comment kyp? :x
,stentehman,2011-02-10T12:46Z,can't you tell me why? (:
,stentehman,2011-02-10T12:47Z,"lol, sorry for spamming, it appears my comment do appear lol (x"
,Rapsha,2011-02-10T14:02Z,Ive never had to do this before but to get the torrent working you have to use the magnet link or else you will get no input file specified.
,ChickenWingLeg,2011-02-10T15:06Z,"Rapsha is right, click magnet link. The ""Download this torrent"" link seems to be broken."
,GMDFUCKU,2011-02-10T15:40Z,magnet dosnt work for me. none of the files show up
,kyp0001,2011-02-10T17:34Z,"@stentheman
Yes the release seems to be 1.0.0.1. If you get an error while patching, i'd suggest you repeat the install because somewhere you had an error/made one. Be sure everthing is a 100% downloaded ^_^

I MAGNET ever torrent since a year or so, see:

,Rapsha,2011-02-10T17:52Z,yeah im not sure why that happens GMD but it should fill in the empty space with the files a few seconds after the download starts
,reghin78,2011-02-12T01:55Z,"Here's my contribution:
The save folder should be located in
C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Kalypso Media - for XP users
You might want to keep this folder before patching.

Now, if it still crashes after applying the patch, there's no real improvement is there... Restarting from a previous save also worked with the standard version."
,scrns,2011-02-12T05:55Z,"kyp0001's patch worked fine for me but apparently 1.1.1.0 introduces a really nasty bug that crashes the game whenever a mage tries to port out.

1.1.2.0 fixes this... Anyone have this yet?

Also 1.2 just came out too (different from the 1.1.2)"
,reghin78,2011-02-12T11:26Z,"what do you mean by ""mage trying to port out""?
Teleport out? As in leave the dungeon the way he came in?"
,scrns,2011-02-12T11:44Z,"Once mages are fully fullfilled and not fighting something, they cast town portal to leave the dungeon. Takes like 10 seconds to cast, but I think it crashes as soon as they start casting it."
,kyp0001,2011-02-12T22:39Z,"I've gonna wait till past Patch 1.2 or a better cracked version comes out. It has a myriad of bugs :/
Gonna keep seeding it, in case it helps some of you though"
,scrns,2011-02-14T07:54Z,"Could you upload 1.2? It seems the game uses incremental patching, so we will probably need it to patch higher when it comes out =o"
,kyp0001,2011-02-15T02:35Z,"Patch 1.1.2.0 

replace zeroes with O, the letter:
http://www.dem0n0id.me/files/details/2547540/00781329267/


Thx to Hellz89"
,MikePush,2011-02-17T16:37Z,"Works perfectly BUT

BUT BUT BUT

The game crashes every time Novice or any other magician tries to cast a spell to teleport from the dungeon once he is fully satisfied.

Unplayable.

PLEASE upload Patch 1.2, if you can find a way to get it!!!!
We're waiting on you, kyp0001"
,MikePush,2011-02-17T17:24Z,"ATTENTION
PATCH 1.2

""FiendXY at 2011-02-14 13:07 CET:
Hi all,

I found the patches, but I am to lazy to upload them :0) ... there are links it is copy paste from

*megarapid.net/f0rums/t/827656.aspx

I used the first one 1.0.0.1 to 1.2.0.0 Patch.
No more problems with game crash.
Process:
Instal Dungeons-FLT
Instal dungeons_deen_1.0.0.1_1.2.0.0.exe (or the second one)
Start DungeonsStarter.exe with active internet conection)
Now you see screen with request to put the serial number.
Disconect internet conection
Insert DGNS-DZ52Y-CAMK9-RV8HM-H46JV-N6DQ3
You can see screen with email/password.
Push button ""Proceed""
Game is starting.

P.S - In the link above exchange '0' (zero) in word torrent with letter 'o'.

I found this message on demonoid torrents, using it myself!!!"
,akayd,2011-02-19T12:32Z,"anyone can explain why my installer auto closes when it says ""Please wait while windows configure Dungeons "" and countdown-> autoclose -> nothing happen"
,kyp0001,2011-03-21T15:53Z,"Stopped seeding it as the newer Patch 1.2 solves it all and makes it playable (99% :))
