,DeanMachine16,2011-02-12T00:52Z,"Been waiting all week for this one to come out.
Strangely enough I found it here last night and had just finished downloading it from someone else here today, but when I just went to look for it to comment on, it was gone.

If this one is anything similar, the A & V were both top-notch, 10.

I was really surprised to find these here on TPB before Demonoid though. They've usually gotten the DCAU movies a few days earlier in the past."

Thank you, Cartoonworld. I've been looking for this one. It doesn't come out officially for another 2 weeks. Hooray for piracy!"
