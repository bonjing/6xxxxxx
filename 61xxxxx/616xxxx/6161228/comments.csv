A few hours ago i was up at 300 kb/s...
There is no change in the trackers, no trackes has gone offline or timed-out, and right now i've got 2 people downloading this stuck at about 53%.

If anyone know this problem and know how to solve this VERY anoying issue, please let me know."
,PunkBuzter,2011-02-09T07:21Z,"Oh, i allmost forgot...
ALL trackers are perfectly fine...

i've randomized the port a few times,
i've done a network-repair-check in windows with no problems found,
i've made a speedtest with the results:
DOWN: 17.15 mbit
UP: 2.32 mbit
PING 45
QUALITY: 4/5

what is wrong ?"
