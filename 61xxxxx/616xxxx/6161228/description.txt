Now a box is visable in the top left corner of your screen called "AI test"
Press Spawn, Spawn again. Select a Hero to the enemy team.
((There are only a few Heroes chosen to work as AI))

How to make custom map ?

For this part you need to download the original HoN Game.
Go to your game dir C:/program files/Heroes of Newerth/
Open "Editor.bat"
When the loggo of the map makes 2.0 beta is visable, just click the image and you are in.

From here on you have to make the rest by your own hand.
