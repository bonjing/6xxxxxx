,oxlxo,2011-02-10T11:27Z,Many thanks eztv! Been waiting on this show to come back on since last season's finale. Fast and great upload as always.
,gauge1971,2011-02-10T21:08Z,"yeah thanks eztv i do appreciate your uploads great quality, except when you use files ripped by ASAP..They dont play through an external media player. They work ok through a pc but not when burned to a disc or when played through a harddrive/ext player. Ive had the same problem this week with pretty little liars e16 and spartacus episode 3 all by ASAP. never had the problem before with your uploads. only the ones with ASAP in title. sorry to complain but if theres any chance you could ask the ripper to check it out that would be great. Unfortunatley no other copies but ASAP ones are about for these shows/episodes so i got no way round it."

,blakep,2011-02-11T12:51Z,"I've had the same issues as gauge1971 with ASAP files. Excellent quality on the computer but refuse to play off a DVD or USB. Ditto with the latest Spartacus. Thanks eztv for the hardwork, but it's a shame there's no other upload copy available."
,IamTherapist,2011-02-12T10:56Z,"Thanks man, great upload as usual!!  

Just out of curiosity, how do you guys have problems with USB drives with the ASAP files?  Mine work just fine every time, including this one.."
,researcher70,2011-02-12T18:54Z,"I, too, have problems with ASAP files when converting it through ConvertXtoDVD. Watching it on the computer is fine but with the convert to DVD, the sound is messed up. Any suggestions?"
,Feetback,2011-02-21T23:49Z,"Happy. Thank you! ""eztv"" keep eem coming! more please:)"
[T],jerry7_57,2011-03-11T00:40Z,"No problems here, played off of a flash drive in my Phillips stand alone, and also converted the first 5 episodes to dvd with Ultra DVD Creator without any video or audio problems. 4 of those 5 were ASAP rips. "
,gauge1971,2011-03-12T23:44Z,"Just to say that since my last post all the ASAP files have now been working. Had problems with the Early ones, Spartacus E03, Pretty little liars E16, Justified S02 E01, shameless US E03 and this one but have downloaded lots since then and they have all worked perfectly so thanks for sorting out whatever the issue was. thanks again eztv for all your hard work and ASAP."
