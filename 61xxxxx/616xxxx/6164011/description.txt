"My Funny Valentine" 

When a young girl is kidnapped and held for 
ransom, Danny and Jackie place her drug-
addicted boyfriend at the top of their 
suspect list. Meanwhile, Erin and her boss, 
Charles Rossellini, take their flirtatious 
banter a step further.

hypocrisy - [hi-pok-ruh-see]

1. a pretense of having a virtuous 
character, moral or religious beliefs or 
principles, etc., that one does not really 
possess.
2. a pretense of having some desirable or 
publicly approved attitude. 

Seemed like someone needed a refresher.
