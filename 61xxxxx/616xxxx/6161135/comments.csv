this is coming from someone who loved the blair witch project.
the shitty camera work was just an excuse to show the shitty CG trolls full on without being able to tell how shitty the CG was.
the docu-plot made less than zero sense, they get a cameraman to help them film trolls BUT DONT EVEN LET HER KNOW THE TROLLS ARE REAL.
this was just utter shit and pissed me off to even watch it."
,psichoate,2011-05-21T08:31Z,"this is just completely insulting to the intelligence of the viewer.
these trolls eat rocks and can crush cars and eat whatever, but if you throw on some body armor and  a bucket on your head, you can just walk up to them and let them attack you and you wont even be hurt by A FULL ON CRUSHING BLOW AND THEN THE TROLL WILL JUST LOSE INTEREST.
this is some ignorant shit.
if i wanted to point out logical inconsistencies, even accounting for the fact that it is a fantasy, i would be typing all fracking day"
,psichoate,2011-05-21T08:38Z,"and...
like 1% of the movie is perhaps attempting to cleverly allude to the trolls representing something being held from the public by bureaucrats, but this attempt at a 'deeper meaning' is even more insulting to the viewer than the overall nonsense that is the movie.
utter shit. "

,AlanAx,2011-06-23T22:51Z,"Video=10 
Audio=10
CGI=8
Movie=solid 7 an I am not easily impressed!

   Don't listen to the trolls on here I think they went into the movie expecting somthing else entirely, its an indie fantasy film based on a myth about trolls FFS!!! Intelectual is a big word for some of you so well done there...(clap clap clap)
