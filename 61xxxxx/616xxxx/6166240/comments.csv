ENG subtitle: http://www.engsub.net/?p=subtitle&id=95423"
,phorqued,2011-02-11T15:02Z,Not a noob here so please no flaming me - the sound of voices fades out almost completely 2/3 of the way through. Either the video is corrupt or the station it was recorded off of lost partial signal.
,fn002449,2011-02-11T17:58Z,phorqued is right.. I have the same problem... now downloading the repack.

There some sound problem. From 29.10 - 32.10
mins, the sound is muffle. How to solve this.
Hope this version is OK!"
,SomchaiT,2011-03-06T04:16Z,"Reconfirm, no Trojan, check with 'AVAST' and
'Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware'.
They have ratified the faulty part. Recheck
yourself if you're not sure. This copy is OK!
But not perfect. Download the repack copy."
