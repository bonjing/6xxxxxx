,Jakkie_takkie,2011-03-04T21:19Z,hmm I can't burn a cd with the enclosed CDRWin program. Program works but gives an error when starting to burn. Anyone got a clue? With the older RNS-310 versions it worked fine...
,michelvd,2011-03-06T09:03Z,"Strange, since there is no cdrwin enclosed. Is your problem about this download?"
,stekkerke,2011-07-14T09:25Z,"Are these v3 maps?
what is the differance with your previous. post?"
,stekkerke,2011-07-14T12:29Z,"Sorry, my bad. This is the version 2.
Has anyone tested these images already?"
