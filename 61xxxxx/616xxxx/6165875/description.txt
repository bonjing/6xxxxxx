"Hall of Mirrors" 

When an undercover counter-terrorism agent 
is shot, Frank assigns Danny to the case 
because he is the only officer he can trust 
given the victim's involvement with 
infiltrating a sleeper cell; however, Danny 
is sworn to secrecy as to not disrupt the 
police activity in that cell.

Enjoy :)
