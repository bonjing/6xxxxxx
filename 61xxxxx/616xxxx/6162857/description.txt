The devastating blows come left and right as Fitch, Washington, Stone and Sanchez invade the boxing world to investigate the death of Vanessa King. King's fiance, Tommy Westin, is preparing for a big match against Dap "The Detroit Hammer" Fields. The detectives discover Vanessa, an ex-girlfriend of Fields', was hiding a closely guarded secret which could have thrown the fight and its payday into question. Meanwhile, Longford and Mahajan are forced to give a cold case a fresh look: It's been five years since James Lakeland died. Now Lakeland's mother brings new evidence to the squad. A love triangle is uncovered and the detectives must piece together Lakeland's two lives, the one with his wife and daughter and the other with his married lover who has hidden a crucial piece of the puzzle all these years. The detectives are confronted with tough ethical issues in order to bring a resolution to the case.
