Great animated TV show. The complete 26 episode 2nd season is here. 

Golden Age Batman art influences with modern production and interesting team-ups with lesser known DC heros and villians make this animated series an instant classic to Detective Comics fans. 

Thank gawd something came along to replace that "The Batman" crap. That show was such a big letdown after BtAS . 

BATMAN: The Brave & The Bold carries on the standard of superb production from WB studios' DC Animated line. 

All episodes are in HD quality. 

Most episodes were actually encoded by others, many by EZTV and TV Team. GREAT Job by those people and keep up the good ups. All I did was collect them from different sources, edit out a few commercials and rename them to add titles and match each other. 

I dont upload alot of torrents so if there's something I should do to improve my Ups plz leave a comment.

Enjoy!
