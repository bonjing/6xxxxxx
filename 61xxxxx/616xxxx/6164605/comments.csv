,YATMAN,2011-02-11T03:50Z,This broke my Transmit. I had 3.something installed and tried to replace it with this. Now Transmit opens and freezes. ARRRRRRGH could've warned us
,karen_cahun,2011-02-11T12:24Z,"@YATMAN very possible, that this, being a Mac App Store, uh, app (whatever . . .), requires 10.6.6. Haven't tried it myself, but read it elsewhere."
,YATMAN,2011-02-11T18:13Z,Disregard my previous comment. It works now.
