MTV junkies Beavis and Butt-Head awaken one day to find their beloved TV stolen. On their adventure to do a murderous smuggler's wife, they encounter an FBI agent with a predilection for cavity searches, two rather familiar looking ex-Motley Crue roadies, Mr. Van Driessen singing "Lesbian Seagull", a little old lady, and, of course, Mr. Anderson and his trailer. Can the Great Cornholio save the day? Let's hope so!
