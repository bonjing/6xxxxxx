A=10
V=10

if you are burning this, make sure to use a DL disc, otherwise it will not play"

,geffmontrell,2011-07-26T16:06Z,"Ok, I have a problem, use the KMP with external filters, FFDShow and CoreAVC. But the video is slow and the audio cuts out, I have several videos in MKV and reproduce without problems, I do not know what to do, but all I can think is about the DTS as the audio format, you help me? THANKS FOR SHARING!"
