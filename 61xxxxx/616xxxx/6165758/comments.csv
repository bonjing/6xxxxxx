Just not on the Demon village, which kind of ruins the game and made my two days of downloading pointless.
So could someone CONFIRM for real this time that there is NO problem with the Demon village level?"
,sage1210,2011-02-12T01:00Z,"@Actromophile: I also downloaded the previous released but still not have much time for intent play it.

So...I only played the village stage on training mode and still not find any problem.

Is that mean I will not have any crash while  playing in that stage in arcade mode ?"
,Actromophile,2011-02-12T01:23Z,"@sage1210:
I tried to play that level in training and the same thing happens. It freezes the game while loading.
So then I guess you should be able to play arcade without problems.

So this must be firmware-related. Which are you on?
Also, did you run the file in abgx or patch it in any way?"
,sage1210,2011-02-12T02:02Z,"@Actromophile: from my research, i found none modded xbox have this problem as long as they not touch online.

even that modded xbox is an old modded."
,Actromophile,2011-02-12T02:30Z,"@sage1210:
That's weird since I have not been online with my xbox in over 2 years.
So I think it must be firmware-related."
,sage1210,2011-02-12T08:08Z,"@Actromophile: May be like you said, things may went wrong on your firmware."
,residentevil808,2011-02-15T22:06Z,how do you put this on the xbox 360
