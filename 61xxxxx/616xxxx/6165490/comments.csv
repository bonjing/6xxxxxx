how many ppl use bitcomet rly??

will DL anyways though Im too lazy to click on 12 individual links.

Padding files... and I dont even like the show, DL for a friend. He should be extra grateful now that I have to put up with 11 extra files for however long it takes to seed 1.2. Cause Im not going any higher when theres fucking padding files involved.

Oh and btw, did I mention I hate padding files?"
