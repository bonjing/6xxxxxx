What's New in Version 1.5.1

HAM 'EM HIGH CONTINUES â€“ ANOTHER SEARING UPDATE
Angry Birds is back with a brand new update!
New Features in version 1.5.1:
- ADVENTURES IN THE FRONTIER BADLANDS CONTINUE
- 15 NEW LEVELS â€“ ALL CRAZIER THAN POPCORN ON A HOT STOVE
- A NEW GOLDEN EGG THAT IS AS MAD AS A BAG OF HAMMERS
- Watch the Rio Movie Commercial during the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl to find a hidden clue which unlocks a special level of Angry Birds!

In version 1.5.0, we introduced the Mighty Eagle downloadable content. If you get stuck in the game, you have the opportunity to purchase a can of sardines, which you use to lure out the elusive Mighty Eagle. This phenomenal creature will the soar from the skies to wreak havoc and smash the pesky pigs into oblivion!

Mighty Eagle will help you skip the toughest obstacles, but there's a limit: you can only use the aid of Mighty Eagle to pass a level once per hour. In other words, when you pass a level with Mighty Eagle, you need to wait an hour to use him again to pass another level.

Is that all? Far from it! Mighty Eagle includes all new gameplay goals and achievements! In each level that you already cleared using the regular birds, you can smash away freely and try to fill up the destruction gauge! If you want to smash your way through every level leaving nothing behind, you have every incentive to do so!

Mighty Eagle is an in-app purchase in Angry Birds and costs $0.99/Â£0.59/â‚¬0.79 to download. One-time purchase, unlimited use!
Weâ€™d like to take this opportunity to extend our infinite gratitude to friends of our fierce birds everywhere. We thank you sincerely from the bottoms of our fluffy hearts for making Angry Birds the highest rated and best selling game ever on iTunes!
