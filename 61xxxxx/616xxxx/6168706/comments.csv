,nes7day,2011-02-12T06:27Z,Could you upload the complete season 2 in 1080p without watermark please
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-12T08:45Z,"i COULD

but not going to upload 30 gb just for you.

if i get a bunch of requests, then sure. but you're the first, so no."
,nes7day,2011-02-12T11:16Z,"Well, would you consider uploading an episode each week if there's not too much request? (if it's not too much trouble.)"
,lievenazerty,2011-02-12T11:50Z,Yeah I want an 1080p season 1 & 2 no watermar version to of the clone wars plz upload 
,KaitoTano,2011-02-12T14:26Z,nes7day & lievenazerty I can seed 720p ones with no watermark but i don't have 1080p ones
,nes7day,2011-02-13T00:31Z,"KaitoTano, that would be much appreciated, I've been searching everywhere for watermark free, HD version of Season 2. "
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-13T01:44Z,"Season 2 in 1080p was released, but i cant seem to get my hands on the files.

The best that is currently out is 720p."
,ArclightX,2011-02-13T03:39Z,"Hmmm I don't get it, is 720p w/5.1 sound unbearable? or am I just missing the point or something?"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-13T07:44Z,"the point is the request is to upload in 1080p.

there is a MAJOR difference that can be noticed by most people. but the point is, it's not 1080p as requested."
,nes7day,2011-02-13T13:30Z,"Well, I would prefer 1080p, but if there's non available, 720p would just be splendid. As long as there is no watermark on them."
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-13T23:06Z,"well my seedbox is ending tomorrow. So unless i find some money i can use to pay for a new month, i'm not gonna be uploading any 720p stuff.
So i'll see what i can do."
,nes7day,2011-02-14T11:24Z,Thanks
,KaitoTano,2011-02-23T02:25Z,they are getting harder and harder to find now both 720p and 1080p
,nes7day,2011-02-24T06:54Z,"KaitoTano, are you going to upload Season 2 now that Alex can't?"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-25T11:31Z,"Hey guys, someone finally made a donation so at the start of next month i'll have a seedbox and i'll upload season 2 in 720p!

hopefully i can find a good seedbox for cheap."
,nes7day,2011-02-28T11:12Z,"Yay, thank you"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-03-07T10:59Z,"sorry to disappoint again, but the money is frozen in my paypal. cant do anything with it :|

I might have to seed from my own computer, but max upload i have is around 70 kb/s so that's really not a good option.

Sorry again."
