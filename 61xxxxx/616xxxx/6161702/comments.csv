,JKelley,2011-07-14T15:34Z,"Fair to middlin' at best - more items to ""compleat the collection"" than anything else.

There are a few moments, but not enough to justify a series of four novels.

Nothing against the poster (hey - I downloaded them, but I wanted to ""compleat my collection!"") but I don't suggest these if you're looking for an engaging read.  The Reacher novels (Lee Child) or most of Preston Child's stuff is immeasurably better!

But, I do thank you for putting these up - as I said, I wanted to compleat my collection.  (I've also got Doom, Doom II, Doom III, all of the supplement/add-on disks for Doom and Doom II I could find, and loads of downloads.  Doom is the game that got me REALLY interested in id Games!)"
,Aurasan,2011-07-30T23:07Z,"lawls.. to each their own I suppose. I personally love these books, I suspect the subtle character development in them is lost on those who are after a ""shoot 'em up"" style of writing. Naturally I can also only guess that the quality of writing (not the storyline, but the actual prose, grammar and word choices) of the authors is also lost on those who clearly live for video games and their joystick(s).

Unfortunately due to the genre and titles of these books, they tend to attract the wrong reader. If you're looking for a pop-up picture book go download see spot run 3d. If you're after a selection of books to drive your imagination to the far, darkest recesses of your mind, causing you to explore parts of your psyche you have never really known of, give these a thorough read at least twice.

DONT just skim a few pages here and there and ASSume that you know everything about them.

That said, since I had to [F] Downloading due to one seed, I'll be seeding these well-writ pieces of underrated and under appreciated literature for a long time to come.

GLMC; Sincerely, thank you.. but FFS seed your stuff. I'm downloading intermittently at 2kb/s.

lame."
