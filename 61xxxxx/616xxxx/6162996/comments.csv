This is how it is with these Lurkers.

They strike when they feel like it"
,somedude.1001,2011-02-14T11:59Z,The quality of the comics went downhill once they have that TV series going.
,Shuffle_,2011-02-14T12:17Z,Thank you! Obrigado!

And they are Always Late now"
,TraumaHound,2011-02-15T06:17Z,"Awesome, thanks for sharing! I like the calm-before-the-shitstorm feeling the last few issues have had. Sure, there was that one group that tried to storm the gate but they got dealt with pretty quickly. It's the herd of zombies that'll inevitably find their way into the town...they always do..."

,takyirklosov,2011-02-25T12:04Z,"The quality was deplorably dissipated, lacking in skill and nearly tasteless when Tony More was absent from the inside n' out of the comic. =( ...and yet I keep coming back because of Kirkman."
,takyirklosov,2011-02-25T12:07Z,"Oh yes! This torrent is perfect. Thank you mirrormaster82. 

Quality 10/10 

5/5 stars Potatoes

,shirlzknight,2011-03-01T20:20Z,"about to download.... i can hardly wait, n whats this about the books going downhill after the TV show?
 If you have any idea about how R Kirkman feels about the book you would know this is his prize project, his baby! He has stated many times that he is in the position to NOT be influenced by money making ventures and has promised  us to keep the book going until its not good anymore, He and many of the fans self included hopes it will run for many a year to come.Granted there hasn't been allot in the way of forwarding the story of late but he is just lulling us in to a false sense of security. Keep reading and keep buying the books i just download these digital editions until the trades come out and there cool to have on the go too. May the Dead keep Walking!!
thanks for the upload dude Nice!!"
,shirlzknight,2011-03-01T20:23Z,WOW 50 second download!!!
