Description:
Supreme Folder Hider is file hiding software that prevents anyone who uses your
computer from viewing your folders, or more importantly, the files inside.
Featuring a stealth mode, Supreme Folder Hider gives you the ability to quickly
hide files and folders by using hotkeys. Upon hiding a folder within the easy to
use software interface of Supreme Folder Hider, the folders are removed from
Windows Explorer entirely. This means that your files and folders cannot be
clicked on, nor even seen. Windows shortcuts and even recent documents won't be
available for anyone to see. Within the folder security software, you can add as
many folders as you want for quick hiding. Supreme Folder Hider not only will
hide folders, but will prevent all file access, even from the command prompt.

Instead of password protecting folders, the file hiding software makes the
folders completely invisible.

Notes:
1. Unlike other software that only hide folders, SFH will prevent people from
seeing your hidden folders all-together. (It will prompt for a password before
letting you proceed to it's interface.)
2. No installation required. Copy to folder and use.
3. Works with portable media.
