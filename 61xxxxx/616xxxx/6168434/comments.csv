[V],catflap,2011-02-28T22:53Z,"i have the dvd box set of this doctor.

all of the episodes were already posted
when they were aired last year, so, sorry but
i'm not going to rip, encode and post the dvd rips.

i have my own downloading to take care of.

just search and you'll find them all here, or at eztv, or demonoid.

i prefer to do the one-off specials.
i did the animated specials dvd rips and the
children in need special. they are all in
my account."

Could you post a movie called Womb. Matt Smith (the new doctor) and Eva Green is in it. I can't find it anywhere. "
