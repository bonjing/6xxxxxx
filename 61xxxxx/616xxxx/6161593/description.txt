This album sounds like the resurrection of that soft Pop-Soul music played in the early 70s by Bread, America, The Association, The Doobie Brothers, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, etc. But who needs the reanimation of a sunken era?
I for one do. 
What The Beauty Room deliver here is deeply inspired by those bands; even the lyrics have that melancholic sunset gloss. But this is not a warmed-up dish, nor simply a retro album, it's clearly a contemporary production, both in terms of instrumentation and singing styles, and a highly professional one at that. Songs with unusual progressions, harmony vocals, acoustic guitars, phased Fender-Rhodes e-piano, everything simmering at medium speed and volume. Though the power of invention lets up a bit here and there (tracks 6-8), the album walks the line between Pop and Soul with aplomb, and while the songs for the next release could be a bit more varied and perhaps even more daring, the basic formula is fine with me. A most welcome release.
