,J_Danger,2011-02-10T14:55Z,"I do not believe this is official. It's supposed to be a score, for one. Having background noises louder than some of the instrumentals leads me to believe that this was yoinked off of a forum, as I remember someone posted an audio rip straight from the DVD where they tried to tone down the background noises (and claimed to not do a very good job)."

I couldn't get the ""registered"" link to work when I signed up, so I can't really confirm, but I hope this isn't the actual score."

Why dont you download both and check whether they are same bitrate and same files !!

Why would i take the trouble to upload something fake and bother to seed it to !!

Chances are someone who downloaded this posted there!!  "
