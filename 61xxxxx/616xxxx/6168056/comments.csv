Description: The world was shocked with a series of environmental disasters, and mankind is on the verge of extinction. Aliens have returned, determined to wipe people off the face of the earth and started at the same time with one of the most iconic cities of the earth.
New York streets flooded with alien invaders, and the wave of the walking nightmares gradually engulfing the city and its inhabitants. Urban communication systems are destroyed, the buildings are in ruins. This New York City youâ€™ve ever seen.
Neither law enforcement organizations, nor the U.S. military machine can not cope with the invaders, and all who could not escape in time, are already dead. To survive in this chaos, you need the technology, about which neither the earthâ€™s soldiers also have no idea.
One person will inherit something that will help him survive. One super-soldiers, armed and equipped with the latest technologies of the future in Nanosuit 2, take a desperate attempt to save humanity in the streets of New York.

,kiwi_the_pom,2011-02-12T04:57Z,"To the ""United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the ""United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users""!

well i have read this about the leak...

According to a thread at Facepunch.com, the full code for Crytek's shooter sequel set in New York City, including multiplayer and the code key to deal with the online DRM, was posted today. No one is sure where the leak came from, but it's especially damaging because the game is near to being declared gold and shipping to retailers. If the code is recent, """"""it's basically the game that everyone will be playing if they purchase the disc"""""". Crysis 2 is set to come out for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on March 22nd.

Copy the folder to your disk and try from there. Don't just mount the ISO. Then run the crysis exe. Works best from the 32 bit folder in my experience."

@ Everyone nagging about waiting/buying...

First of all that's besides the point.
Second, what are you doing here if ur so into making the rich richer?
Third, I wouldn't have bought the game otherwise at least not at release prices. You do realize you can eat for two weeks even longer if u stretch it for the money it costs to purchase a copy (mind the word copy, ur not even buying anything original).
Fourth, u do realize that this leak is very probably no accident. They now how much such a leak helped Half Life become very successful."

Try any or all of these things to fix your failing game. all of these have already been said, but not all in one place:

1. 800x600 resolution
2. *move* or delete videos.pak in \gamecrysis2
3. Gamer level graphics

Mine still doesn't work perfectly, it's a little stuttery, and crashed just now, but it's quite playable. 60 fps when it's running.

on a seperate note: to pirate haters: stop. This happens, its a driving force, individuals aren't to blame. There are several reasons why this is morally acceptable. Don't believe propoganda.

I will probably buy the game when it comes out as the MP looks awesome. This isn't a cod rip off imo.

The problem is that if you get stuck, trying to figue out whether it is a game glich or just you. kutjez, just ignore the dummies. Use the suit shield and fire away on the gunship. If you use the shielding the gunship stops firing back. You have to find more ammo in the room and it takes awhile. Shoot the guys off the roof first. Now after the gunship crashs and you head downstairs please let me know if you find a way out. I can't and I think maybe it's a game bug but have no way of knowing for sure."

,Shadowblac1,2011-02-22T06:45Z,"OK, for the people having trouble with the gunship, what i did was cook grenades and throw them at the gunship, it takes about 3-4 solid hits to take out the gunner, u can go the back left of the room and theirs a ammo chest with unlimited ammo in it, shoot the people on the roof, when it goes down, DONT jump to the lower level, all that is down their is a collectable, their should be a path in the room near where it crashed, u can exit through the hole in the wall."

,otaku911,2011-02-23T16:10Z,Anybody have the same error as me after the 2nd cutscene. Missing Batterypark gfx? JW if anybody else had it and where to fix it.. I found on youtube there is a multiplayer unlocker out any idea where to download it?
,DoX3D,2011-02-23T22:32Z,"In case anyone is iterested.
Edit the system.cfg.
r_displayInfo=1
Change the 1 to 0.
This will  disable the text onscreen such as
x y postion frame rate.
Also, if you pause the game hit Print Screen.
This will pull up a debug menu.
You can disable graphic quality and other things.
This could be useful for those of you without great gfx cards. By the way, those of you bitching about this game, need to realize that this was a leak, so in a sense a beta.
Unfinished! The game when It's out will be fantasic. I will buy it. Also if you peerblock, and run the game you will notice it has a connection to a game site, will not mention any names."

If u have a problem with cutscenes (I playied 32 bit version and I had problems) then delete video (it's .pak file in ...\crysis2\GameCrysis2) of course u won't have any videos but u will be able to play game, so it is worth it.

,auricon69,2011-02-25T09:08Z,Okay so I have to say this... to all the people that keep posting that this is going to hurt crytek and they wont want to make games for pcs anymore... Does anybody realize that the SAME thing happened to Half-life 2 and in reality had no effect on sales whatsoever and is probably a contender for # 1 FPS of all time. So... sure its a setback so close to release. I'm SURE people at crytek are butthurt. But for one this is NOT the final edition. There are still many changes to be made and there is still a huge incentive to buy the actual game. Or pirate it when it comes out :P
,prst,2011-02-25T21:55Z,"If you're wondering about this version's quality:

1.Audio sucks

2.No way to easily change specs

3.Lots of Bugs

IMO, playing this will only spoil the game. Wait for the properly finished and cracked version."

I extracted the iso to my hard drive and run it off that.  I guess maybe I should try and run from the disk to free up some hdd space.
