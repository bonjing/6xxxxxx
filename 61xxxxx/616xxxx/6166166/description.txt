When Alexandra from the Dr. Phil Family last sat down with Dr. Phil, she revealed sheâ€™s homeless, has lost custody of her three kids, is panhandling for money, and her relationship with her fiancÃ©, Tony, is on the rocks. After the last taping, Alexandra allowed the Dr. Phil cameras to get a glimpse of a day in her life. See where sheâ€™s living and how she spends her days. Next, find out if Alexandra is truly working to get her life back on track, or if sheâ€™s let Tony derail her progress. Dr. Phil drills down to determine why Alexandra settles for men with troubled pasts, and she breaks down in tears while making a surprising admission. And, Alexandra hasnâ€™t seen her children in more than three weeks, and broke a promise she made to her 3-year-old daughter, Leilah. Are drugs to blame? Plus, watch the hostile exchanges between Alexandra and her mom, Erin, and see whatâ€™s driving a wedge between mother and daughter now?
