From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes back to the show Joe Seehusen, the CEO and president of Liberty Guard, a fiercely non-partisan, not-for-profit organization that engages in public education campaigns, court action, and legislative activity in the defense of individual liberty. Mr. Seehusen has held senior executive leadership positions in business, community non-profits and political organizations. He served as the Deputy National Campaign Manager of the Ron Paul 2008 Presidential Campaign Committee, the National Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Libertarian National Committee in Washington DC., and as a senior executive in several for-profit service sector corporations.

On Monday [Feb. 14] Alex said he will not be on the show beause of a story he's working on.  Hosting duties Monday will be handled by Paul Joseph Watson and Aaron Dykes.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
