DockView is a Snow Leopard-only application that extends Appleâ€™s
Dock and shows window previews whenever you hover your mouse over * 
an application or while using CMD+Tab. It helps you visualize the 
windows you currently have open and easily find the window you
are looking for.

Features:

* Live previews. The previews refresh constantly so you can keep an eye  on windows without activating them.

* Customizable. The previews can be any size you want and you can
  choose between six different styles.

* Badge Dock Icons. DockVi

* New can badge Dock icons with the number of windows that each
   application has open.

 * Activate windows. Click anywhere on a preview to activate the
    window.

* Close windows. You can use DockView to easily close windows.

* Spaces. DockView can show the Space number to which a window 
   belongs to.

* No hacks. DockView doesnâ€™t modify the Dock or any system file.

Control Applications:
* Window previews for iTunes show skip, play and pause buttons.
