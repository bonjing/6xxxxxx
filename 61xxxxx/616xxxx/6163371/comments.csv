Only thing I found, and find, strange about all of the movies in this series, is that the narrator ""presumes"" stuff after showing the facts instead of just noting the facts as truth. Thus spinning the wheel of ""conspiracy theories"" AFTER showing waterproof material from the conspirators themselves of the validity of the info..

""The elite need you to believe this BS."" [?]
The elite are coming out of their closets, and that's why we have this info now, info that would have resulted in mysterious deaths for the ones revealing it had it been 15 - 20 years ago. 

""BS""? OK; time for a reality-check?

And just as fast as the goal is accomplished, it is taken away from them again. And the tragic and baffler is: They know it's like that.

I mean; thousands of years of schemes with the endgame being a few years where the reign of lawlessness will rule under the names of freedom and peace.. And they think Christians are stupid?

Gimme a break.. Oh. That's right. Those breaks are harder to find nowadays.. [ ? ] ;-)"
