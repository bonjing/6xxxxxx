Hi There... 


This is allegedly part four of the "Hidden Secrets of America's.." etc. -series.
It has been released before though, under another name, but this version is updated and does strike me as being quite crucial to the series. VERY informative to say the least.

Only thing is they should have released it as part two or thereabout.
Like; why wait until now with the hardest evidence? Oh well..

This documentary is creepy, because it shines a light on the total ignorance on people professing to be "enlightened", but good, because it really nails the matter once for all. Of course it focuses on USA, but the international implications are there, and even more so today than then..

WELL worth the watch..
