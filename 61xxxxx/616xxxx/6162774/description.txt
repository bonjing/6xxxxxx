Clearing my external hard drive I came across this, downloaded from ages ago, and thought I'd share.

It's the Cluedo SWP from old style quiz machine version of touch screens found in pubs.

It does work but I've only ever tried it on XP but if it works on Vista or 7 please comment as personally I have no idea.

Hope it does and hope you enjoy
