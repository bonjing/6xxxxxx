Oingo Boingo - Nothing Bad Ever Happens to Me [promo].avi


HQ very rare promo music video. "Nothing Bad Ever Happens to Me" is a song from Good for Your Soul is the third album by Oingo Boingo. It was released in 1983 and was their final album for A&M Records before transferring to MCA Records. Several songs were recorded but omitted from Good for Your Soul, including All The Pieces, Head in the Clouds, Waiting For You and Lost Like This (a song re-recorded and issued on the 1994 album Boingo).

Oingo Boingo was an American new wave band. They are best known for their influence on other musicians, their soundtrack contributions and their high energy Halloween concerts. The band was founded in 1972 as a performance art group called The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, and from 1976 it was led by songwriter/vocalist Danny Elfman, who has since achieved substantial renown as a composer for film and television.

The group's format changed twice. In 1979, it changed from a semi-theatrical music and comedy troupe into a ska-influenced New Wave octet and shortened their name to Oingo Boingo. In 1994, the band reshuffled its lineup, adopted an alternative rock sound and rechristened themselves Boingo. The band retired after a farewell concert on Halloween 1995, having reverted to the name Oingo Boingo for the concert.
