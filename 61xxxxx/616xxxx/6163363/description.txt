From Wiki:


Charles Hardin Holley (September 7, 1936 â€“ February 3, 1959) known professionally as Buddy Holly, was an American singer-songwriter and a pioneer of rock and roll. Although his success lasted only a year and a half before his death in an airplane crash, Holly is described by critic Bruce Elder as "the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll."[1] His works and innovations inspired and influenced contemporary and later musicians, notably The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton, and exerted a profound influence on popular music.[2] Holly was among the first group of inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.[3] In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Holly #13 among "The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time".[4]






Memorial Collection 2008


Memorial Collection is a 2009 compilation album of American singerâ€“songwriter and rock and roll pioneer Buddy Holly's master takes and hit singles, including some rare recordings. Along with Down the Line: Rarities, this album was released to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Holly's death (February 3, 1959).[1]

In an interview with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Holly's eldest brother Larry Holley commented before hearing both this compilation and Down the Line: Rarities, "MarÃ­a [Elena Holly] told me I was definitely going to just break down and cry when I hear all these CDs, because they've cleaned them (the songs) all up and Buddy's music never has come across so pure before."
