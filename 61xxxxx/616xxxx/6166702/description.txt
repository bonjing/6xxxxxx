"Double-Edged Swords"

Jack and Avery (guest star Elizabeth Banks) 
go to Canada for a final romantic getaway 
before they become parents, but when Avery 
goes into labor, they do everything in 
their power to not give birth to a 
Canadian. Meanwhile, Liz's romantic getaway 
with Carol (guest star Matt Damon) is 
ruined when their plane is stuck on the 
tarmac. Tracy is besieged with the unwanted 
responsibility of being an EGOT winner.

Enjoy :)
