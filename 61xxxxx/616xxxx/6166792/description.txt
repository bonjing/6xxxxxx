Grandma's Boy (1922) Silent with English Intertitles, B & W

Director: Fred C. Newmeyer

One of Lloydâ€™s personal favorites of his films, Grandmaâ€™s Boy is a beautiful tale of self-discovery, with a bounty of comic overtones. Sonny is a self-professed coward who balks at the sight of the town tramp (Sutherland). Armed with a lucky charm given to him by his grandmother (Townsend), he defeats the tramp and the town bully (Stevenson), learning a very valuable lesson about himself in the process.

A standout contributor to the art of silent film comedy, Harold Lloyd (1893-1971) offers new generations a body of film work that is as fresh and entertaining as in its day. His roots were simple â€“ born in rural Nebraska, product of a broken home, and initially destined for the legitimate stage â€“ yet by the 1920s, Lloyd was, both at the box office and in the polls, the most popular comic actor in the world.

His appeal was simple, yet legendary: through his Glass Character, which formed the basis of roles from 1917-1947, Lloyd struck gold with a screen persona that forged new ground. The Boy, as he was most often called, had one trademark â€“ lens-less horn-rimmed glasses â€“ yet was able to reach audiences as no contemporary could. He is regarded as the man who most greatly influenced eyeglass-wearing in America, and this single facet of Lloyd inspired youth worldwide. His screen normalcy â€“ in look and demeanor â€“ allowed moviegoers to relate to the Glass Character no matter what his label. Rich or poor, cowardly or flip, from film to film, Lloyd was a different Boy, and was able to create a cinematic legacy that remains both diverse and uniformly thrilling.

Harold Lloyd might just be the funniest actor youâ€™ve never seen â€“ a silent screen comedian so often placed in the shadow of Chaplin and Keaton -- but he continues to shine in some of the most enduring short- and feature-length comedies ever offered to audiences.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
