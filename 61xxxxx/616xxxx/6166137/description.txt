AppZapper V 2.0.1 including Serials

AppZapper allows you to confidently uninstall virtually any application as easily as it was installed -- just drag and drop. Drag one or more unwanted apps onto AppZapper and watch as it finds all the extra files and lets you delete them with a single click. A slick safety system remembers which apps you want to keep safe, and the log tracks all the files you\\\'ve zapped. Put simply, AppZapper is the uninstaller Apple forgot.
