Blu-ray to AVCHD

I Compressed a Blu-ray movie named '2012' to AVCHD M2TS File, it took 2 days for me. 
The only thing you should do is to burn it with DVD Burner or Blu-Ray Burner to blank DVD9, 
which holds 8.5GB. Note: DVD Player doesn't support AVCHD format. 
Only Blu-Ray player supports AVCHD/M2TS file.

Summary:

Format: m2ts
Resolution: 1920x1800.
Language: Russian  If you want other languages or subtitles, then let me know. ;)
Subtitles: -
