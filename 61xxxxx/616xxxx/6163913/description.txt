While growing up in the Middle East (Northern Virginia) DJ King Pigeon asked himself, "What is the best artistic vehicle for the interpretation and celebration of 'freedom'?" (It should be noted that his only friend in those days was a stick named "Sticky the Stick," so he had plenty of time to ask deep questions).

In his mid-twenties he got an answer, an answer so obvious that it pains any writer of torrent notes to write it out, but write it out I shall. The answer, of course, was "DJ'ING."

Now DJ King Pigeon travels the world hunting down and sharing rare musical artifacts. Whether these treasures are Estonian girl groups, Russian rap stars, Belgian...whatever D.J.F.R.A.N.K. is...or Polish trance artists, he collects them with the skill and determination of Indiana Jones--because DJ King Pigeon knows that these treasures need to be in a museum.

So welcome to the Museum of "Eurotrash or Eurotreasure?" DJ King Pigeon is its curator*, and you are its visitors. Please enjoy yourselves, and don't fart--that's disgusting.

* You thought I was going to say "Sticky the Stick," didn't you?
