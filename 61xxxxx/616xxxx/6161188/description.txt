                    Micky pines for somebody to love so when the  
                    opportunity arises for him to adopt a cat it  
                    becomes the perfect outlet for his paternal  
                    urges. But when the cat is diagnosed with AIDS  
                    he turns to HIV positive Lulu, rather than his  
                    bigoted family, for help. Meanwhile Chesney is  
                    away and Bradford is in charge of the shop,  
                    much to Sita's irritation. The pair argue, but  
                    finally reach a new level of understanding and  
                    respect. Sita helps Carl with a new job for the  
                    Maguires, unaware it's not legitimate. The  
                    police are soon involved and the fugitives are  
                    on the run. Will this be the beginning or the  
                    end of their relationship? And Mimi's knickers  
                    have been taken off her washing line, causing  
                    widespread panic among the women of Chatsworth.
