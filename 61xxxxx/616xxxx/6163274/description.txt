"Pilot"

Friends Mike, Adam and Ethan are each at 
different points in their lives in terms of 
their romantic relationships. Mike is married 
to Lisa and the two have a young son. Family
demands stretch Mike thin in terms of time 
for himself, and he finds himself getting his 
"me" time watching movies in his car, and 
thinking Lisa has no idea it's going on, even 
though she's all too aware. Adam has just 
moved in with his girlfriend, Callie, and he 
finds living together is a whole lot 
different than "she comes over a lot," and 
they are just starting to figure out how to 
reconcile their life together with the 
previous freedom of their single lives. 
Ethan, who is perpetually single, thinks 
dating the same woman for three weeks is an 
extended commitment. Find out how these 
friends navigate these waters.

Enjoy :)
