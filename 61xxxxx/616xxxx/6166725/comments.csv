,rodrot,2011-04-02T01:35Z,works great from my external hdd with kmeaw 3.55 cfw and rogero backup manager. Thanks for the upload.
,negleh,2011-05-13T15:07Z,"It's amazing how many people want free games, but don't have the common sense to read the instructions on how to do just about anything except download them.

When you put all the files in the Gamez folder, you open Gaia Manager or MultiMan. Then you choose to load the game, and it goes back to the XMB. You should have already had another game disc in your drive, otherwise it doesn't work. When you go to your disc icon under Game, it will actually be the game you chose to load, instead of the game that's in the drive, since the way it loads the games is by mounting them."
,negleh,2011-05-13T18:32Z,"By the way, THIS DOES NOT WORK. Download from somewhere else."
,skizo123,2011-06-15T00:00Z,works wonderfully. thanks for upload. no prob with cfw 3.55 and don't need to patch anything. just run from multiman from either internal or external. i ran from internal using ftp transfer

,Beowulf1211,2011-08-07T22:23Z,"You can check for yourself. Go inside the game folder, into USRDIR, then System. 
You'll see wierd files, and the date of modification is dated 2088! it'll put your ps3 into cyclic redundancy!!"
,Beowulf1211,2011-08-07T22:39Z,all these comments are fake....DO NOT download
