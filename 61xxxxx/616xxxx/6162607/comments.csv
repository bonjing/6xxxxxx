,OldBosun,2011-03-14T01:33Z,what's the audio codec-AAC sucks
[T],murdoc47,2011-03-14T08:13Z,"indeed it does. the audio is a quality AC3 640 kbps, converted from DTS
enjoy!"
,Poglodyte,2011-03-30T09:54Z,Hey thanks a ton for this!  Do you know how to make this into an AVCHD?
[T],murdoc47,2011-03-31T07:50Z,"yes i do
(use tsmuxer to make it into *.m2ts format in mere seconds)"
,Sa-Mac,2011-06-22T00:01Z,"Thanks murdoc47, 

I have a question? 
do you know how to convert this to AVI or mp4, I have tried converting it to avi, but it will not turn into a good quality, and it lags a lot.  

Plus I have a Mac and not a PC (only a parallel installed windows)

Thanks !!!"
,Sa-Mac,2011-06-22T06:25Z,"Thanks anyway :D if you can not help me with my previous comment. as I told you my earlier conversion did not work well, but that movie was your other movie ""the god father 1"". This MKV file works much better than the other one (no fence). 
Thanks again, I love your quality on your movies, I have had plenty of movies in my drive which I have replaced with yours, he he :D  "
[T],murdoc47,2011-06-24T21:01Z,"thanks for the appreciation, my friend. i will try to help you with your problem. i don't know if this will work on mac, but let's try. there is a software called Any Video Converter. you can use it to convert any video file to any format, but be sure to use the right settings (to be sure, use ""Original"" in frame size, bitrate etc.) and i think that will solve the lagging. if not, it's time for that much needed upgrade, and i recommend a PC. and just so you know, mkv rules the 21st century right now. keep up and good luck!
and thanks again for the appreciation, it's good to know my work is not in vain."

Chewing through my HDD gigabytes since back in the day xD Love you dogg!!"
,WareIsChris,2011-12-08T01:21Z,Hey murdoc I love your torrents except that when you try to make them an avchd the size is too big for a DVD5. anyway around this?
[T],murdoc47,2011-12-09T09:57Z,"m2ts (avchd) adds on a few megabytes, so you go over the dvd5 limit. a way around this is to simply burn it this way and use an mkv compatible decoder on your tv. nowadays they're built-in."
,ctrlplusalt,2012-02-08T12:58Z,excelent! thank you very much! can't wait for the last film! :DD
