From Wiki:


Justin Townes Earle (Born January 4, 1982 in Nashville, Tennessee), son of Steve Earle, stepson of Allison Moorer, and named for songwriter Townes Van Zandt is an AMA winning,[1] Americana musician based in Nashville, Tennessee. Earle is signed to Bloodshot Records and has four released albums from 2007â€“2010. He currently resides in New York City's East Village


Justin Townes Earle grew up in South Nashville, Tennessee with his mother, Carol Ann Hunter Earle. Earle began using drugs when he was barely 12 years old,[3] developing a serious addiction by the late 90's. In his teens he began playing and singing with two different Nashville bands, a rock band called the Distributors and a bluegrass-influenced acoustic combo, the Swindlers. Earle spent some time as guitarist and keyboardist for his father's touring band the Dukes, but was fired after a dangerous appetite for drugs began interfering with his performances. Once he came off hard drugs, he began putting a new focus on his music and songwriting.


Earle presently tours heavily and played Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival (2008), Grand Ole Opry (March 2008), Historical WSM, South By Southwest (2008-2010), the historic Beacon Theater (May 2009), Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion (September, 2009), Bonnaroo (2009) Bumbershoot (2010) and the Bowery Ballroom (March 2010) with Chicago-based singer/songwriter Joe Pug. In the summer of 2009, Earle co-billed The Big Surprise Tour with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Old Crow Medicine Show, and The Felice Brothers.[5] In May 2010, he appeared alongside his father in an episode of the HBO television series Treme.

Earle returned to rehab after he was arrested for battery, public drunkenness, and resisting arrest on September 16, 2010[6] following a dispute with a concert venue about his pay.[7] He resumed touring on Nov. 26, 2010 in Nashville, Tennessee.

In September 2009, Justin Townes Earle received an Americana Music Award for Emerging Artist of the Year. He also received nominations for album of the year (Midnight at the Movies) and for artist of the year. He had been previously nominated for Emerging Artist of the Year in 2008.
