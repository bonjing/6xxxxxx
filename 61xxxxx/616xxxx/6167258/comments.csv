,The_Reasoner,2011-02-11T15:41Z,"I'm not sure what the problem could be, marty. All the files have worked fine for me so far. I do have one suggestion. I don't know if it will work, but it's something you can try:

1. Load the file in Media Player Classic
2. Click the ""Play"" Menu
3. Choose ffdshow Audio Decoder > Properties...
4. Choose ""Mixer"" (in left column)
5. For ""output speakers configuration"", choose ""1/0/0 - mono""
6. Make sure that ""Mixer"" is the only option checked in the left column - leave all others UNchecked
7. Click ""Apply""
8. Click ""Ok""

Again, I don't know if that will fix your problem, but it's all I can think of. Best of luck. "
