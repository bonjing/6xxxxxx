The Luftwaffe most deadly fighter is simulated to award winning detail and accuracy by Classic Hangars for Flight Simulator X.
"These new fighters gave us a hard time of it... faster in a zoom climb than a 109, far more stable in a vertical dive and they turned better than the Messerschmitt so we had all our work cut out to shake them off. We all agreed it was superior to the 109F and completely outclassed our Spitfire Vs. It was not until some months later that our intelligence admitted the introduction of a completely new fighter, the redoubtable Focke-Wulf 190, designed by Kurth Tank." - Group Captain, 'Johnnie' Johnson, RAF Fighter Ace, writing of his first encounter with the Fw-190 in 1941
This amazing package from the renowned 'Classics Hangar' development team, includes key variants of this incredible warbird - from early A-3 and A-4 models to the monster 2,200hp A-9. The final version of what many say was the finest piston aircraft to ever take to the skies.
Five highly detailed FSX-native interior and exterior models are included, featuring 21 historical exterior liveries in high resolution - supporting bloom, specular bump-mapping and self shadowing.
All are individually simulated to award-winning quality and re-create German micro-mechanics in remarkable detail. Classics Hanagar's "1%" flight modelling data means you too can feel what it was like to fly one of the most feared aircraft in WWII - to a level not yet seen in flight simulation.
