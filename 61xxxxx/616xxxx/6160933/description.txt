Fernando birri directed this film in collaboration with the Cuban film institute. this film is based on a short story by gabriel garcia marquez. the "angel" that falls to earth is indeed an old man with enormous wings, and not at all clean. the very humble and unsophisticated people in the village where it befell, exploit his novelty for profit. the old man is not an angel, but a metaphor that represents natural resources that are lucratively commodified, and finally exhausted. if you are following me now, then you can see for yourself what the carnival represents. at the end of the movie the old man escapes his cage, but unfortunately some of us that have seen this movie have yet to leave ours.
