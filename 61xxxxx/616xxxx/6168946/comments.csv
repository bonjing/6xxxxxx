,ginevraweasely,2011-02-12T09:54Z,why did you put the files in a rar format? you would be more appreciated and we would be more helped if the files were individually represented in the torrent.
,doctord2,2011-02-12T16:59Z,"I agree with the previous comment. I won't download RARs either.

Additionally, your tags are next to useless when used in the Porn category; everything in this category is presumed to already be ""porn"", ""sex"", ""porno"". How about tags that distinguish your upload from someone else's, such as: any stars (starlets) appearing in your upload, production house (if known, ie Wicked Pictures), production year (if known, ie 2004), etc.

You might just have a rare or highly desired video in your upload, but by uploading a RAR and not using proper tags, nobody will know. :("
,doctord2,2011-02-12T17:15Z,"Here's an example of good upload documentation:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6169911/Mouth_To_Mouth__4_Scene_6_Starring__Kelly_Kline__Kinzie_Kenner#filelistContainer

Note how the tags describe specific niches, and the description lists who appears. Whomever downloads this link knows what to expect.

Plus, screens are nice too. Note how another person provides screens not only in comments afterward, but also in the download:

My point is: if you want your uploads to be rated on their *content*, please provide enough info for someone to determine a rating. :)"
,BrandonTheBMXer,2011-02-12T21:14Z,Would you like for me to delete this torrent and upload a new one. With all the propper things? 
,doctord2,2011-02-13T02:19Z,"No need to delete and reupload... you can add description and file list as a comment.

I see that your second upload incorporated our suggestions. Thank you. "
