,gnawingonfoot,2011-06-18T07:34Z,"Thanks for puttinjg this together!  For future reference, it's a good idea to provide encoding information and the details on where the files came from.  If this is, for example, a compilation of eztv releases, it doesn't hurt to leave the file names with the  the encoding info and the release group.  If you ripped or DVRed it yourself, that's good to note in the information.  But I'm happy to find everything all in one torrent.  Thanks!"
