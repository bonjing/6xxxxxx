
Tetsunosuke Ichimura has always been upset about his short stature.
After he sees his parents being murdered by a Choushuu assassin right
in front of him, he vows with all his heart to become strong enough to take
revenge on their killer. It is now 1864, the first year of Genji. Tetsunosuke,
now 15, heads to the headquarters of the Shinsengumi with his older
brother Tatsunosuke, looking to join the historical group to fulfill his
dreams of getting stronger. Little does he realize what he is about
to experience by doing so, for in order to join this army, one
must forego his humanity and become a demon.

Most of my uploads are encoded / compressed to their smallest possible
file size. The quality IMO is still pretty decent though for the filesizes. But,
those of you who have a higher res monitor, may notice a drop in quality,
if this bothers you, then look elsewhere... I will not bend on my methods.
Thank you to those that enjoy my torrents.., I enjoy sharing them with you.
Feel free to pm me if you're looking for something, or have a question???
