If you have a book on spraypainting cars, would you kindly post that also? Thanks!"

I dont know who you confused this book for a book on painting your car.. The title gives it away ""Digital Painting Tutorials"".. not to mention the picture on display. Either way. I dont have a pdf on spraypainting cars. I would go to a professional for that anyways. Theres alot of experience you need before you actually paint your car that you wont really get from a PDF. Its a hands-on experience that you need to undergo. And i doubt that you have ""practice cars"" to practice on. and a can of spraypaint isnt the way to go. Hope you find what you are looking for. Have a good day. :-)"

Please keep up the excellent work! "
