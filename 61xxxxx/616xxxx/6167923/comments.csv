[V],twentyforty,2011-02-12T07:55Z,"@the_shroud: Today's TV pack or any long header in any torrent would suffice.
Hint: Quarks, as electrons too, are member of lepton family.

,jmac85,2011-02-12T08:45Z,"First off, thanks 20-40. I will give this a shot. I've read the long headers and still have no idea what the 'quark' means. Care to elaborate? I know they're all 352p at least...and know what the word means by definition.

Also, eat shit downraters! (+1)"
,r-0987,2011-02-12T09:36Z,Thanks! 
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-12T09:36Z,"Excerpts from omnipresent Long Header:

..."" ONLY for PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, 
some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).
WATCH from 6-8 ft. distance at low-res settings of display.""

..."" 352p = frame-size 624x352(272) pixels, 16:9(2.35:1) aspect ratio, 
playback ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file. ""

...""I recommend 
and have used one system for years - CoreAVC for H264 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5910023/
(""Deblocking"" set to ""Standard"") and part of DivX7-8 for AAC - 
AAC DirectShow filter.""

..."" Recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768 (no matter frame-size).
If you watch on HighDef TV or new HighRes monitor - take a proper watching
distance - 6 to 8 ft. (It's a must then, I KNOW how ugly it looks with nose
in front of screen). LCD panels, especially cheap and affordable ones 
""hate"" low bit-rate encodes. 
I have two monitors connected and same encode looks ugly on
LG LED LCD but looks fantastic on normal CRT Samsung one. 
So, move your bottoms few feet back - or download GB big encodes.
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination."""

""Yes people,quark is meant to be watched as 20-40 says.If you have an HDMI output on your laptop connect it to your T.V. or if you have a play station(I don't have one)use that.Too many people come back and complain about the picture quality but if they only would listen to 20-40's advice there would be no complaints.Those of us who love the quark do not want to lose it again.Respect the quark and the quark will respect you.;0)""

,spiritualiste,2011-02-12T17:07Z,"Once again and again and again...+1 (i never get tired to...)
Thanks a lot for sharing your ÂŤunique-piece-of-artÂť work. We (your regulars) understand the time and love you put on your shares and that's what makes your gifts so appreciated...
Live long and Prosper Twentyforty."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-12T21:39Z,@milayaa: Welcome back.
,razorraj,2011-02-13T17:42Z,hey plz upload SPYGAME & SUPERMAN RETURNS..
,jmac85,2011-02-13T19:40Z,"Thanks for the somewhat explanation on 'quark'. But, you list some encodes as [352p.quark] and others as simply 352p without the '.quark'. I'm trying to get at the difference between a standard 352p and one designated as 'quark'."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T14:05Z,"@jmac85: Quarks are (like electrons) member of lepton family. [lepton] tagged encodes share [quark] encoding technique. So, [quark] is encoding type, and ""p"" tags are  for frame-size. [quark] can be anything between (in Legend explained) 208p  to 1080p, mainly (nowadays) 352p. For example, Harry Potter 7 was encoded  as [352p.quark] and as [720p.quark], and it's tagged little differently than my normal 352p or 720p to make distinction more noticeable."
