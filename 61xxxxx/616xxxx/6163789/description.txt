Release Notes

Source..........: DVDSCR VOB's (Thanks to an old friend!)

Well here is our version of the SCREENER. We used the source VOB's so there

is no Spanish subs at all......and no we didnt just crop them out. Didn't 
notice any property of marks or anything,however there is a JH watermark in the middle of video. Not too big a deal,would have been worse to blur. Anyways,we did our usual work to the video and used the audio straight from the DVD. Should definitely hold anyone over til Retail is available. Enjoy!=]
