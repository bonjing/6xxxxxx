They're mimicing private torrent sites with most of the features of a private except one..PRIVATE SITES ARE PRIVATE! They want you to donate, or keep up a share ratio, but it's open to public WHICH INCLUDES GOVERNMENT/CORPERATION IP'S so there's no reason to join them if you plan on continuing to download from public trackers, they don't get 1/10th the stuff piratebay ! I had a hard time downloading from them because my peerblock was BLOCKING THEM! They don't use their on server, they're on a share server."
