can you initial-seed for just a while?
i'll keep it on a seedbox for a month ^_^"
,sliptv,2011-02-15T02:08Z,"I'll seed for another 24 hours, I've got 4 ready to come up though, so I don't want 3 hogging my bandwidth (not that it makes a lot of difference, I've got SDSL :P)"

I admire whomever made that decision, and of course sliptv for the time and effort for these torrents. "

,MaskWhoRU,2011-11-22T13:40Z,thank you so very much for MASH! very good quality btw
,BarbozaTC,2012-02-27T23:10Z,"Thanks a bunch my friend!
