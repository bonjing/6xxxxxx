The aim of this eBook is to provide both an efficient and methodical approach to creating characters that can encompass both organic and mechanical components and equip artists with the knowledge to learn techniques used by industry professionals. The series provides an in depth account of creating a character from the concept and base mesh stages through to the final detailing and high poly sculpt. It will as its subject adopt the theme of an alien humanoid in battle dress, partly clad in armor and carrying weapons. Each of the chapters will address a certain aspect of the design and show a step by step guide covering the principal techniques and methods used to sculpt the numerous components including the chest and body armor, anatomical detail, footwear and clothing along with various accessories and weaponry. Much of the high poly sculpting and anatomical refinement takes place in Zbrush, discussing the appropriate brushes and tools used but the author will also integrate 3dsMax into the pipeline as a way of preparing some of the base meshes and mechanical components. Although 3dsMax is used in conjunction with Zbrush the modeling techniques are equally applicable to most other 3d packages with the principal lessons proving universal.
