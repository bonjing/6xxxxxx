Today Spanish PlayStation 3 Developer XESC has released a homebrew application he calls PS3
Channels Creator v1.0.
Download: PS3 Channels Creator v1.0
To quote from Elotrolado, roughly translated: Hello! I present a program that I've developed to
create channel lists ps3 to our liking.
The program already has a list of channels to add, but otherwise there is an option to put our
channels or web pages you want!
The only creates our file xil.xml to put directly into our ps3
(/dev_hdd0/tmp/explore/xil/tv/c/63431223453538546/xil.xml). Suitable for all the CFW or dongles
as you only need an FTP or file manager.
The icons and the backgrounds are the same as the pack of colchonerox! I hope you find it useful!
PS: If you have any problems or want to add channels to the next version reply in the thread,
thanks!
