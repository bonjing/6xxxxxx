By the beginning of the eighties, Motown's glory days were long past, yet they were still able to score some big hits. Unfortunately for Motown, there were many more misses and minor hits than big hits as this compilation shows.

Being with you (Smokey Robinson) and One day in your life (Michael Jackson) both made number one in the UK, while Endless love (Diana Ross and Lionel Richie) made number one in America and also made the top ten in the UK. I'm coming out (Diana Ross) made the UK top twenty, but the remaining tracks made little, if any, impact in the UK charts.

Of course, just because they weren't big hits doesn't make them bad records - indeed, many of them are excellent. It's always good to hear the Commodores, Syreeta and Teena Marie, but you'll have to look elsewhere (including earlier volumes in this series) to find their big hits.

Purely judged on the size of the hits, this is the weakest volume in the series. Nevertheless, this is a fine compilation showing that Motown was still turning out some great music in the early eighties.
