Persia wakes Seth up and sticks a huge wad of cash in his face. She wants to know why he is dealing drugs out of her house. She was kind enough to rent him a room and this is how he repays her? She is livid! Seth finally gets the chance to explain that he did quit his job waiting tables, but that's because he started playing poker online and he is really good at it. He won that cash in a tournament last week, its not from drugs! Persia is very relieved and when she hugs him to say sorry, her defenses are down. Seth decides to go all in and do something he has wanted to do for a long time.
