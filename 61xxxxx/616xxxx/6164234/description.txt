The recipes in Vijay Madavan's Cooking the Indian Way have been so popular with my family and friends that several recipes now number among their favorites. Given a choice, my family would have these dishes every night. Be sure to make large portions when you serve these to your guests -- although the dishes are quite filling, you will be astonished at how quickly they will disappear! 

Although we initially found this book in a children's section, it is actually the best of the Indian cookbooks we've seen. It includes a nice introduction to regional differences in Indian cooking, and provides some cultural information, as well. 

Easy, informative, and delicious, too.
