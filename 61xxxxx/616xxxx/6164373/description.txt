*PROPER Notes....: Another release by CRiMSON that is out of sync. Sons.of.Guns.S01E05.HDTV.XviD-CRiMSON is 200ms oos. It is also
		   overcropped. When comparing screenshots between the CRiMSON and MOMENTUM release it is apparent that CRiMSON
		   crops the left, right, and bottom past the widest frame. I have provided evidence in the sample dir and at
		  for only the right side. It looks to be 1-2 pixels difference at a 624x352
		   resolution which would equate to much more at the original 1920x1080 resolution.
