It is with intimate detail that Sydney two-piece kyÃ¼ piece together their music. Freya Berkhout and Alyx Dennison have a unique song craft that yields magnificent results, and a distinct style that intersperses vast soundscapes with vibrant melodies. Itâ€™s pop as much as it is experimental, ornate as it is raw, classical and contemporary in equal parts.

Encyclopaedic in their references and energetic in their delivery, kyÃ¼ have created a musical masterpiece that goes beyond their year together, and their years as individuals.
