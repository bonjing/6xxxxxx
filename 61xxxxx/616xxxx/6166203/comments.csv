[T],nlx_78,2011-02-12T14:56Z,Can't believe Steve Carell will leave the show after this season :(  Hope the rest of the cast can fill up the void. Mainly watching cause of him i guess :)
,iknowyoudont,2011-02-13T02:16Z,I definitely think the show will make a good run after Steve leaves.  I'll miss him but I'm also looking foward to Gervais and Will Ferrell.
