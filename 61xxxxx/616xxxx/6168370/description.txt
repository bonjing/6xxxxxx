"Delicate Sound of Thunder" was released in 1988 as a double album. 
Was published at different times, in various forms with different content.
The DVD has officially this album never released.
This is a direct rip from the LaserDisc, taken by me on Demonoid at waspo.
This is a fantastic concert! It sounds and looks fantastic! 
Includes "Money" - is a bonus!

For the DVD I recommend ImgBurn. Why? Because only ImgBurn uses the most flexible 
algorithm for determining the transition point on the DVD-9. Among the programs that 
specialize in recording, ImgBurn - actually the only one able to create a conformal 
DVD-Video in all cases where it is physically possible (and honestly refuse to write 
the disc, if it is not possible). Another plus - the program is absolutely free to get better at the official site, it has rusifikotor.And so, using ImgBurn to create an ISO file (Create image from files / folders), the program prompts you to select a cell for the transition between layers, select the cell 12, then write the DVD (Burn image to disk). 4x write speed.
