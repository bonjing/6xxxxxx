,kiloloki,2011-02-17T06:49Z,"Damn, and I've been looking for the 1963 version for ages !! Guess the 52% everybody has is now only good to delete ?

Any chance of a re-up please as the 1990 version sucks major compared to the original ..

If you can find the Bogart movie ""To Have and Have Not - 1944"", that would be a great find too :o) ..

Thanks for your efforts too, most appreciated :oD .."
