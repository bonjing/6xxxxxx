Do you have any video like collonial gunsmith about hand forging of muzzle loader barrel?"
,RecycledElectrons,2011-08-23T07:24Z,"Sorry, no. 

I saw such machines at the NRA's museum in Virginia, and then I looked for such material for a long time. The problems are (1) the teaching at that time was hands-on, not book-based (2) everyone had their own style, so even if you find a great how-to book, it refers to other tools the guy made himself.

So, I suggest you leap-frog to modern weapons made with antique means."

Ive looked around and cant seem to find a legit copy.  :("
