Bruce Wayne Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #1

April 1996

Amalgam Comics (Marvel/DC)

I have the first 12 issues of Amalgam Comics. I read that they came out with another

12 issues a year later. Those I don't have.  Thought there might be some interest in 

these. 

Here is an article about the series.
