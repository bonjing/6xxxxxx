Game two of the FAI Carling Nations Cup sees Northern Ireland face Scotland at Aviva Stadium. 
This is a tournament that also features Wales and the Republic of Ireland.

This is not the full match as I missed it live,Its about 70 mins out of the 90 minute game,
I have removed the adds though....
