,pawcio88,2011-02-12T12:57Z,ENGLISH SUBS needed:( can someone post it please?
,Crash613,2011-02-12T13:40Z,"i don't think the comments about him being a noob because he doesn't want RAR is warranted.  

I mean really, who hasn't been burned by RAR before?  you don't know what you are getting until you've downloaded it... then you find out you can't open it till you go to some fucking website, or beg someone for a password.. or download some jankey codec, worse yet it isn't  even the right file at all.

so i can see why people are leery of RAR.  so maybe YOU should do a little learning.

That aside, I trust the Skull and will download this one.. .but usually i, too, wait for a proper AVI to appear."
,pawcio88,2011-02-12T14:39Z,"well, subs for previous episode were published about 5 hours after the upload, so I hope somebody post them quicker than 1-2 days :("
,Riffter.1,2011-02-12T17:11Z,"Major noob alert i'd say...

File is rar cause that's how you get them from the scene.

Anyone who ever traded ftp site to ftp site knows why...
Major private torrents sites share them in rar cause that's how you get them and it's just faster to share them that way.

(With multiple files, more then one can send the release to another ftp.)

There, you can stop whining and go to bed with a bit more knowledge."

,Crash613,2011-02-12T20:21Z,"gee thanks for the ""schooling""..  yeah i know why they are originally in RAR on a trusted FTP site 'scene' connection type scenario.  But here in Torrent-ville there are many reasons (previously listed) why NOT to use them.

So good for you for looking up a few terms (scene, FTP transfers, etc)  but most people will still want AVI in public forums."
,ust2,2011-02-13T02:03Z," Downloaded this last night and there's nothing wrong with it, unpacks and plays fine, no reason to give -1's.

 I'm not really a fan of rar's either though, mostly because they end up taking double the space on my hd, the extracted file and rar's so I can continue seeding, but the damn file is fine."
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-02-13T07:36Z,If you want an avi extract the damn file .You tell me whats the difference between me extracting and anyone else .If i leave it rared i can upload this within 30secs of it being pre'd if it was me i know what i would want
,crypt0gl,2011-02-13T09:34Z,"Everyone knows what rar ""IS"" but the fact is that most fake releases use password protected rar files and like someone else here said everyone has been burned by a rar release before.
Having to download a 500mb file just to find out it's passworded is no fun and I still prefer to wait for non rar release unless i'm really sure. Your so called ""schooling"" is unnecessary as I'm more than familiar with the so called ""scene"". Take a look at eztv releases, any rars there? Why not? Are you going to call them noobs then? No of course they are not."
