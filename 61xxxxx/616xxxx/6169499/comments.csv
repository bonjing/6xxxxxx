,wizkid13,2011-02-13T07:30Z,Love your uploads! It would rock it you shared your Handbrake settings. I have lots to share but haven't been able to achieve that quality and have the small file size.
,hakuna_matata,2011-02-14T09:42Z,thx .. looks like mkvguy is back
,bdummer88,2011-03-04T14:36Z,Any chance you could share your Handbrake x264 advanced options string? I'm also interested in knowing what RF value you are using for this. I've never seen this kind of quality in such a small file size and would be interested in nowing how you achieved that.
