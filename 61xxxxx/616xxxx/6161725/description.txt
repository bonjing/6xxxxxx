Lunascape Web Browser 6.4.2 ORION 

Lunascape is the world's first and only triple engine browser. It has been downloaded over 15 million times and it's available globally in 11 languages. Try it yourself the new kind of speed and versatility.

A new interface mode, ORION, is added to version 6 as a default. This sleek minimalist interface has all the basic functions and will get you going in no time. You can still customize many aspects of interface to your liking.

Our unique Triple Engine keeps evolving. To better support web designers and developers, we have implemented â€œsplit tab displayâ€. You can view a web page in 3 rendering engines side-by-side to easily check the browser compatibility.
