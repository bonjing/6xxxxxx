Very scary how a big US corp is doing these types of things to cover their crimes up. 

Everyone in every country should be scared of this behavior!

Personally, I have donated over $500 to the Assange Fund. 

If you are reading this...you should at least be able to give $5 or $10 with all the money you save pirating here."
