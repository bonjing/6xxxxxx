In the way of some 411, the user should not be confused with the default document that is loaded by Xara at startup - the ""Getting started on your 30 day trial"" (introduction.xar).  Just close the document and it won't appear again.  If you followed the instructions then you're good-to-go with a fully activated copy."

 tophtml wrote about following instructions, but it seems instructions nowhere to be found! Please, explain step by step how to find installation instructions."

,mjinga,2011-09-26T22:58Z,"How to:
1-Install the Prog and close it.
2-Open the Folder Crk and copy the .exe and .dll
3-Open your installation folder in C/progs/xara and replace those two files
4-Start xara and use one of the activation methods. For me only the tel. worked...so click it
4a-open the ""unlock.txt"" and copy the telephone key and paste it in the empty space
5-Activate and enjoy

Thanks webchela."
