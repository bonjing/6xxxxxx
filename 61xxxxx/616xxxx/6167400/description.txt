From the back cover notes: 

"The documentary film "Feiern" presents people whose nights don't stop for 72 hours. Their stories are about tenderness, excess, and self-destruction. About the search for happiness and the fear of being alone. The portrait in 19 conversations, 56 nights, and 13 tracks. 

Berlin 2005: Techno has returned underground â€“ and lives more excessively than ever. And once again the city has become the place to be for those who want to go all the way. 

"Feiern" shows them getting down â€“ sweaty, dazed, deliriously happy. People who dedicate their lives to music, clubs and drugs talk about their experiences.They tell stories of self-destruction as well as tenderness. And every one of them is about the search for happiness: about that perfect moment of collective ecstasy, about the right record being played at the right time, about talking for eight hours to a complete stranger, who you adopt as your best friend â€“ for the night. Or about how it feels to walk into a darkroom and become "a mere piece of meat, to be used and use others". The conversations add up to the portrait of a family and make "Feiern" the melancholic homage to a subculture that continues to celebrate until, finally, a simple cough turns into pneumonia, and a blackout leads to psychosis. In Berlin, says Ewan Pearson, a DJ and producer from London, somebody could bang a wooden spoon on a saucepan- as long as you did it in time, nobody would go home. With a smile he advises his friends: "Donâ€™t forget to go home!". They might not. And rave on happily ever after."
