The emulator comes with the game. Its PSXfin

@Philonetic 

The PC version isn't as good as the original. We all know that. "
,Philonetic,2011-12-21T20:53Z,"For those looking for the best possible version of FFVII...

I've uploaded an Original mod pack with all the mods separated and the old original readme's included, you can find it here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6903748

You can find my alternate mod package with the newer creations here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6903757

MODs don't work on the Ultima version, get the original version here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5867219


@moodude  No, it's better.  I've got full 256kb quality Advent Children orchestra for my music, detailed high quality models to replace the blocky old junk in and out of battle, playing the game at 1920x1080, the list goes on."
