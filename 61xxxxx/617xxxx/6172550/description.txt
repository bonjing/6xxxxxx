    A religious mystery opera. A magnificent doomsday vision. A full         
    length nightmare. Dacapo's Records very first opera DVD features Rued    
    Langgaard's allegorical opera Antikrist witnesses the spectacular        
    Danish co-production by the Royal Danish Opera and the Danish            
    Broadcasting Corporation from 2002. No pains are spared as the           
    composer's revelation unfolds with its intriguing allegorical            
    characters and its powerful statement about the moral decay of           
    modernity.
