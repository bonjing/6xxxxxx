After all these years together, the Blue Collar boys have gotten together one last time to give you one for the road.

Jeff Foxworthy, Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall and Ron White have reunited for more of their hilarious blue collar humor. The first two movies were runaway hits, and this last installment of their concert experience features all-new material from these four legendary comedians.

The show was filmed at the historic Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. with a brand-new show-stopping encore. DVD extras include a freewheeling question-and-answer session with the comedians and an energetic group of college students, exclusive backstage footage, along with some of their usual fun-loving escapades including a wild encounter at the White House!

So sit right down - you've got the best seat in the house for this final ride with your favorite Blue Collar boys.
