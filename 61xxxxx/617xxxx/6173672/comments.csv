""This one-man extravaganza finds John Fogerty plowing the same ground he worked with Creedence Clearwater Revival. This mix of originals and rock & roll classics finds him in fine voice, with the familiar vocal scream and hot guitars augmented in places by saxophones reminiscent of CCR's ""Travelin' Band."" Several of these songs rank with the top tier of Fogerty's Creedence material, particularly ""The Wall,"" ""Almost Saturday Night,"" and the anthemic ""Rockin' All Over the World."" He also delivers satisfying versions of Jackie Wilson's ""Lonely Teardrops"" and Frankie Ford's ""Sea Cruise"" (written by Huey ""Piano"" Smith). The closer, ""Flyin' Away,"" could have come off the Doobie Brothers' Toulouse Street. This underappreciated album is worth checking out."
