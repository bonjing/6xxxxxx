1991's "Let Me In" features thirteen primarily electric songs, lean, muscular arrangements, and some great guitar playing, as well as R&B-veteran Mac Rebennack (Dr John) playing piano on several tracks. The tough blues-rockers "You Lie Too Much", "Medicine Man", "You're Humbuggin' Me" and "Illustrated Man", and the catchy old-time rock 'n' roll of "Barefootin'", are among the highlights, as is the excellent, Elmore James-like slide guitar-workout "If You Got A Good Woman". Winter also does a good rendition of Jimmy Reed's classic "Shame Shame Shame", and he plays some smouldering electric guitar on "Life Is Hard". And don't forget the magnificent acoustic blues "Let Me In", a soulful, Son House-like slide guitar blues. Johnny Winter is by far the best white musician I have ever heard play the acoustic slide guitar...this song brings back memories of his masterful playing on Muddy Waters' "Hard Again" album. There are a couple of minor songs here, but most of "Let Me In" is very solid, making it one of Winter's best latter-day albums. Definitely worth a listen, even if you're not a hardcore fan.
