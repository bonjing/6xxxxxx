 In ""Final Jeopardy"" the category was ""US Cities"" and WATSON answered ""What is Toronto????"" .....be disturbed.

how could WATSON get that last question wrong after blowing through that second round, when the two humans got it so easily? 

someone was clearly controlling it for final jeopardy. did WATSON suddenly develop the ability of humour and the particularly human trait of belittling your opponent by not taking it seriously, knowing they had no chance and having bet so little? every other time (including daily doubles) it showed us the top 3 potential responses WATSON was to consider, but not in Final Jeopardy?

WHY?

FUCK THE NAU, with the secret backroom deals on border security in which Harper & Obama discussed adopting same standards in things like FOOD (despite our very different countries and concerns of people in them) that took place last week....what are they trying to tell us?

is this thing a digital prophet? the second coming of Jesus perhaps? (you heard it hear first) lol

HE'S BACK! ...in digital form!!!

anyways, i find it very hard to believe WATSON could have gotten that last seemingly easy question wrong. somethings up, and im not jivin' with it. "

[T],metalcore.,2011-04-19T15:12Z,"@partykid, then why didn't it show watson's ""top 3 choices"" in final jeopardy then? when in EVERY OTHER case, it did, including final jeopardy on the other episodes? why? do explain."
