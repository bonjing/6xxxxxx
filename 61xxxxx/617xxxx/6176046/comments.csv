,WishEater,2011-09-17T06:43Z,"Hey guys, just to let everyone know that this works PERFECTLY.

When you download trial off their site and install it, it will say that it's version 4.22 (don't know why the site says 4.21)

Also, I have compared the size of files in this torrent, with the trial from official website, and it matches perfectly. (every byte)

The registry values work as well. (You can enter them as serials as well, just make sure to disable your internet)

Thanks a lot nikita! :)"
