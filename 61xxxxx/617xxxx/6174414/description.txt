        Description:

Zeitgeist: Moving Forward, by director Peter Joseph, is a feature length
documentary work which will present a case for a needed transition out of the
current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which governs the entire world society.
This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and
traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical "life ground"
attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural
laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a "Resource-Based Economy".
THEATRICAL RELEASE - Zeitgeist: Moving Forward is planned to be released in 60+
countries and in 20+ languages starting January 15th 2011. This large scale
release is not associated with any major distributor. 
DVD/INTERNET RELEASE - This is a non-commercial project, which means it will
be available for free acquisition via internet in both viewing form and full
DVD download. ZeitgeistMovingForward.com will also have a physical $5.00 DVD
available in mid to late January.
