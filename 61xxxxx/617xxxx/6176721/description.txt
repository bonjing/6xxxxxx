Two main features - a western and a bikexploitation - with lots of fake 70's trailers and commercials, as well as some music videos and live music gigs, a bonus film, all shoved together in Fish and Elephant Production's take on grindhouse.

The Swedish Grindhouse Project was originally concieved from the want to share films we've previously produced and sold on DVD, re-cut them and edit them together as one big film. And what better way to do it with grindhouse double feature?
The fill it out, we produced some new fake trailers for non-existent films and a couple of commercials. 
It is supposed to be enjoyed back to back, preferably not pressing pause at any time - imagine it in your head as an outdoor cinema experience. Why not?

It is Swedish Grindhouse, yes, but almost all dialogue is English, with some English subtitled Swedish (and a little German).


This is an official release straight from the production company under the creative commons license. You are free (and encouraged) to distribute this material anywhere you like, as long as you give credit to the creators, the creators being us.
First, the idea was to sell it - but we realized that this is something we just want to show as many people as possible.
