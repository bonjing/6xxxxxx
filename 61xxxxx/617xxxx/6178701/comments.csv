Are the episodes really 720p?
Do the episodes even work?"
,Mythicism,2011-02-21T03:02Z,"They all worked, I used VLC.
And VLC confirms that what is stated in the description of the torrent."
,dlightz2,2012-02-17T18:09Z,ugh! i wish you could view the files in Windows Media player!

You can view them in media player, you just need the codecs installed.
Download K-Lite codec pack (even the basic is fine for most file types), once thats installed you can use most media players."
