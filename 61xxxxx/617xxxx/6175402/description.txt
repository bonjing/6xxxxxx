To accompany his new film â€œNever Say Neverâ€, Justin Bieber released his second remix album (I would call it EP) â€œNever Say Never (The Remixes)â€ today. The album includes remixes of several songs from his first album, My World 2.0, featuring guest appearances from Jaden Smith, Rascal Flatts, Usher, Chris Brown, Kanye West, Raekwon, and Miley Cyrus. In addition a new track is also included called â€œBorn To Be Somebodyâ€.


NEVER SAY NEVER: THE REMIXES is a Valentineâ€™s Day gift from Justin Bieber to his fans, and a musical companion piece to his documentary concert film, Never Say Never. The album leads with Justinâ€™s new single, â€œNever Say Never.â€ Justin has collaborated with some of the biggest names in music for this album including Kanye West, Raekwon, Usher, Rascal Flatts, Chris Brown and Miley Cyrus. Many of the songs on Never Say Never The Remixes are featured in the film, including the brand new Diane Warren-penned â€œBorn to Be Somebody.â€
