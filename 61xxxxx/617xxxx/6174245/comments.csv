,tomjonhson2468,2011-03-03T19:46Z,How can I get this movie to play?  I use Divx plus player and it only show nothing but black screen.
,evilmonkey99,2011-08-27T21:55Z,"@tomjonhson2468 anyone who downloads HD movies either 720p or 1080p normally uses VLC MEDIA PLAYER. This player typically plays just about all movies. Occasionally you'll download a TS file that still plays in VLC MEDIA PLAYER however might have some skipping problems, and that is when I use MEDIA PLAYER CLASSIC - HOME CINEMA (this player comes with the Windows 7 install. I'm not sure about any other Windows but these two media players are all I ever need. When I have an issue playing a movie with one player then I switch and play the movie on the other player and all is fine. It all depends on how the HD movie was recorded. Good luck. "
,jivemm,2012-04-14T02:15Z,If anyone comes across this that has this movie in full can you please seed temporarily... has been sitting on 96% complete for days with no seeders. Only 300mb out of 8.86gig remaining. I will seed long term afterwards.
