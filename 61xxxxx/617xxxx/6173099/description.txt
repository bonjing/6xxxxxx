Jon Allen's Infinity Deck is like no other deck of cards. It is gimmicked in a way that you just won't believe!

Most gimmicked decks enable you to perform only one effect, or many similar effects. The Infinity Deck enables you to do a variety of different effects with virtually no difficult sleight of hand.

The specially gimmicked deck comes with eight powerful effects covering such things as peeks, reversals, think-a-card, visual changes, transpositions and mental effects. All this without the use of breaks, crimps, side-steals, passes, top changes, in-jogs, out-jogs, glides or false shuffles. Also included is Triumphinity, the routine from Jon Allen's IBM award-winning act. It is the easiest and most effective triumph routine you will ever do!

No other deck of cards does such a variety effects with such a minimum of effort!

You will be able to master it in a couple of minutes. You may even come up with some effects of your own! The Infinity Deck is a truly amazing deck of cards.
