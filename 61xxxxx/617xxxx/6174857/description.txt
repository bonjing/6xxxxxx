Since their emergence in the early 1980s, Depeche Mode has made the remix an integral part of their art. Their remix catalogue, in fact, outweighs their studio releases by a significant margin, and knowing where to begin sifting through the towering stack of extended singles can prove tricky. Fortunately, REMIXES 81-04 offers a Reader's Digest version of the band's remixes, boiling down the best from Mute's three-disc set of the same name, and providing casual fans with a manageable starting point. REMIXES 81-04 acts, on one hand, as a sampler of the band's remix history, but also includes new mixes by contemporary studio wizards.

While not comprehensive, REMIXES 81-04 is outstanding nonetheless, highlighting the group's club-friendly, industrial-tinged dance beats while leaving room for their brooding melodic pop. The oldest mix, Daniel Miller's "Just Can't Get Enough" (1981), with its Kraftwerk-inspired electro-boogie, bears its age but is still compelling. Highlights include Kruder & Dorfmeister's acid-lounge treatment of "Useless," Air's lush re-invention of "Home," and Dave Bascombe's work on "Personal Jesus," which deepens the song's throbbing, hard-driving groove. In all, the album offers a fine cross-section of Depeche Mode's remarkable talent for invention and reinvention.
