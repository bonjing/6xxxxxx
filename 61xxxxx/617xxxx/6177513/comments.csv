,MitsEvX,2011-04-20T19:19Z,"@Mengus-Guido: have you ever thought of installing a codec pack? Which one do you have got? The K-Lite Codec Pack is a good one, but the combined community codec pack also is a good one! What plater do you use? I've got MPC Home Cinema and Splash PRO (which is the best --> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6289541/Splash.PRO.HD.Player.v1.7.0.Cracked.rar)

First try this, then I'll maybe need to ask you about your system specs ;-) Hope you understand all this and can get it all work! :D I love 1080p :D Just downloaded this one, so can't comment on quality yet, but thanks in advance bobnjeff ;-)"
