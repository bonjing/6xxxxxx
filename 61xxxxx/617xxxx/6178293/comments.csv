I installed it, and replaced, .exe file with the one in the cracked folder, but I am still getting Get activation code message.
What did I do wrong? "
,Sinmist,2011-08-18T09:53Z,how do I crack it?
,ionlyknow,2011-09-05T17:58Z,"To crack it, you have to put all the files located in the crack folder into pamela's directory, not just the .exe. "

Where is the crack folder? I open ""pamela.for.skype.professional.v4.8.0.42-ismail.exe"" crack file and it says that it patches something... and it creates a file called ""Pamela.exe"" and then nothing else happens.

I don't see any folders created anywhere, and if I open up Pamela.exe it just opens up the program. I exchanged the original Pamela.exe file (in the program folder) with the newly-created Pamela.exe, I don't get any registration popups, but I still see a link ""Get Activition code"" near the bottom left, as well as registration links in the ""Help"" dropdown menu.

Did I do it right?"
,InterMike,2011-10-20T09:36Z,"Edit: It doesn't create the file Pamela.exe; Pamela.exe is already in the folder. (No other files are in the folder, just the patch file.)"
