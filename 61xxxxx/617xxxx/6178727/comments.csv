It's 1.85:1 which means approx. 1920x1038, not 1920x1080."
,Krabaman,2011-03-04T14:54Z,"Good quality.
Bad movie."
,rl1993,2011-03-12T00:35Z,"It's taking ages to download. It's been downloading on and off now for 2 days and 4 hours, between 12am and 12pm AEST. I seem to have a fairly constant downspeed of 40-50kB/s, which sucks considering the amount on Seeders, However I've only got 6.7Gb, and I've uploaded 7.6Gb.
Please, more people need to seed."
,Krabaman,2011-03-24T13:24Z,"Awesome quality
Movie really SUCKS!!!"
