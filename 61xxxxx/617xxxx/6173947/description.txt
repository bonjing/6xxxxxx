Self-professed "singer of the American West" John Denver shines in this heartfelt, 1995 live concert to benefit the Wildlife Conservation Society. Favorite songs such as "Rocky Mountain High," "Wild Montana Skies," and "Fly Away" are moving and gain fresh perspective from brief comments by Denver. Lesser-known songs like "Eagles and Horses" and "You Say the Battle Is Over" celebrate the spirit of animals and nature while underlining the importance of preservation. Succinct interview clips express Denver's commitment to nature: exploring man's basic hunger for the wild, the dichotomy between the uncultivated and the city, and the power of the individual to effect preservation and change. Striking though brief footage of wild animals like horses, eagles, penguins, and elephants in their natural habitats serve as bookends to the presentation. The Wildlife Concert is a reflective and moving musical celebration of the American West.
