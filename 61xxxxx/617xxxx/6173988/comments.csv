,Revolver31,2011-02-14T20:43Z,going by the samples imho these at the very least rival the pic and audio quality of the dvd but also surpasses in some areas which is impresive given the smaller size i watched all samples through vlc hmmm ok but through powerdvd they look way better as does all the hd stuff i have these are gr8 uploads but im gonna hold off for somthing bigger in size and quality gr8 up tho.
