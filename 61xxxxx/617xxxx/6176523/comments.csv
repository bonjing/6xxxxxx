I am being highly optimistic hoping this show will improve a bit. If it stays the same, i will drop it soon from my list. 
But thanks anyway for the great encode and upload as ever.

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T19:01Z,"Few excerpts from my answers given past few days might be of interest:
NOTE: Read it carefully, many things have been explained there. For more detailed explanation, especially of the terms specific for torrents I suggest Google.

""@starrknight: If you have received any bytes from my BitTornado, it's - good sign. At least you are not blocked by your provider or myself (skeletons in the closet).

Now comes what most people doesn't understand: number of active connections is limited - on your side as on my side (to lesser extent). Let say on 50. Any of my swarms has more than 100 peers, maybe hour after I upload some torrent. Now, it means that frequently neither of us both CANNOT connect to other one. What complicates further is ability to get not only mentioned fifty active connections, but again, both of us can establish 10-16 UPLOAD connections only, simultaneously. Now - real chances that you and me can establish not just an connection, but one where you get packets of data from me - drops significantly with number of peers in one swarm.

It seems complicated, but you hopefully can make analogies to some other situations in your life and understand that torrents were invented to circumvent these problems of single-to-single connection.
Therefore - I have been parroting these words for years - sharing the bytes between all peers in one swarm is crucial and of greatest importance.

Then is irrelevant factor can you or can you not connect to main, or one seeder. Ones who can - get the bytes and pass them to you and other peers.
Theoretically is so...
"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T19:02Z,"...
But, what if ALL peers or majority are hard-fisting bastards, who keep Upload at minimum and Download speed at maximum?

People get screwed, deprived. Become angry and vent shouting on me. And I have absolutely nothing with any of connection problems.

And - sweet for dessert, if you have not ever received any bytes from me - you are screwed by your provider or network owner and you can do nothing about, except trying to change your program or to apply correct settings just to be sure that you have done all you can.

> twentyforty at 2011-02-12 20:50 CET: 
@starrknight: Forgotten, sorry:

Try Stop-Run few times, minute apart. On that way you change the members of your swarm (down-loaders around you) and you can get - better company and more cooperative people around, who would share. But, you must give them too, or your inner-swarm rating would become so low then no one would give you nothing 'cause you have been marked as ""uncooperative"" (by programs, not by people 'per se', of course).""

""@red6tiger: Greetings to Portugal. Now - about what you have said:

It's misconception, plain and simple. It's like a discussion about downloads of full albums against individual songs. Count in so called ""Discography"" releases of some musician or group (more albums and few dozen songs inside).

It is absolutely the same. 

Do all people like all songs equally? Nope. Do they need to download those they don't like? Yes, they can and they do just that -  BUT they CAN choose what they like or want."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T19:02Z,"...
Point - Seeding: It doesn't make any difference - none at all. Ones who would stay to seed would share with others - things they get for free.

Point - Downloading: [CHOOSE] tag is self-explainable. People should learn the things before they are able to use or do anything. So is with torrents. And yes - torrents are less effective** when individual files are chosen for download than complete (in full, as whole) download. It is well known fact from day one. If somebody doesn't know that, he would experience that and accept that as trade-off for his ability to choose.

Point - Searching: Anyone with decent IQ know what Google is, and anyone has use it who knows how to use Internet at all, right.

So, writing down in Google Search a term ""TV.Shows.Pack"" and get lined up ALL my uploads of TV packs doesn't look to complicated.""

**effective = It's known fact. Partial downloads (download of individual files inside the torrent) ALWAYS are slower than download of whole torrent content. It complicates procedure mentioned in text above, about ""asking"" others 'who has what' and their connection and their willingness to actually share. However, if one choose to get torrent as whole, he download from my server (if and when connection is established,  also mentioned above) as fast as his line goes. It's simple, but it can be all complicated by many factors.

Awesome.. thanks!"
,neil_diamond ,2011-02-15T20:01Z,"Twenty Forty if you go over to Iptorrents or torrentday even, you'll never have these problems again. Why? Because THEY HAVE TO SHARE in order to stay. They have to maintain an above 1-1 ration or they get banned. And when people upload say, two and a half men from you here and they get the angry cease and desist or we'll shut down your server use letter from chuck lorri productions, they suddenly are scared to download anything on a public site, anyway. This was a wonderful site. But with all the drive by viruses, and monitering by movie, tv, and gaming producers it's become a war zone. They're not going after pirate bay anymore they're going after US. So the hardcore holderouters simply take and run. This does not happen on a private tracker."
,verazationable,2011-02-15T20:02Z,Thanks for castle and the chicago code
,hkoraddi,2011-02-15T20:36Z,"@neil_diamond-

 20-40 has said it many times that he is here because he loves sharing.he wants to give to the ppl who are not able to have the big files so its dis was.

i even remember once when tpb was down he had uploaded on demonoid.he said there were double digit ppl downloaded from him. it was like waste to him.....

@20 40-thanks for cape and pll.+1 as always.and ty for being human in y'days file."

Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

@ 20-40 - Thanks for Castle, The CF Show, The Daily Show & 2.5 men. 

Thanks also for taking so much time and effort with your explanation below."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T21:07Z,"@neil_diamond: Appreciate your calm tone, but I know that all. If you, however, read carefully what I wrote, not just in quotes above, you'll notice that there is a substantial difference between pure Hit and run person and a poor one, on some shitty connection in some godforsaken part of the world.

First are the worst of a kind, they are not driven by necessity, but mostly by deep, bad place where their mind is set. MPAA and other protectors of righteousness (sarcastic) are - just an excuse. And humans ALWAYS find excuses, and always blame 'cruel world around' who made them as they are. It is human intrinsic, and no one can do nothing about.

Hit&Run is a manifestation of behavioral concept inside almost any human - it is type of black (by nature) opportunistic behavior just translated/transfered on Net. Opportunities always pull the worst out of the man - therefore we have relatively negligent percentage of true heroes, martyrs, so called saints or simply put - people who acted better than 99.999% of others.

I have not tendency to become one, but - my calls always have been in direction 'rise above' than to adapt self-destructive standards prevalent in all societies today. "

Just asking. Not a request."
,etowhid,2011-02-16T01:10Z,"Thanks for HIMYM :)

I personally don't like these ""experimental"" versions; and I think many of your regular downloaders would agree. The quality suffers much, & even I can afford the extra 20-30 MB [I have a 16kbps connection].

I hope you'll reconsider your decision & revert to your original path. :)"

,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-16T03:37Z,"I hope you DON'T stop doing experimental, at least in 480p or less--those who want super quality can wait for 720p ~1GB versions, which I am sure you will continue to do.  Think I have gotten pieces off your BitTornado site, if it is OVM.  Thanks, will see if download is any faster going for the whole shebang."

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-16T10:39Z,"@etowhid: First, I get your  point. But - it's not representative. You should realize that I encode approx. 60 TV shows every week - approx. 250 encodes of TV shows per month - and that math for sure must change the perspective, right? 

So - real life difference is HUGE, more than 10 GB per month (on my side)! 10 GB shifts costs of my regulars (majority downloads ~24 shows per month) by 1-1.2 GB in more bearable cost-range (or keep GB within the range of monthly allowance)  and produce saving of 20$ per capita and per month!!!

My main goal never ever was quality alone, but quality-footprint ratio, decently looking encodes and smallest size possible within the limits of formats, compatibility and - my personal abilities.

Every time I made change it costs: some people go way. I know that and I am willing to take such drift, because I know that cost-awared people would realize benefits (especially when their bills comes from ISP) and are willing to tske trade-offs in quality.

One thing you got wrong: lately shows have been ~170MB (too big, definitely) and enough idiots attacked me because of low quality.

Where you were then? Not just you, but others as you?

These encodes are ~135 MB. Difference is HUGE, one quarter of size. That's like making atom smaller, LOL...

But, I would work on betterment of quality, rest assured, within my personal  limits, of course."
