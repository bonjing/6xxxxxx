,mightymid,2011-05-04T08:54Z,is the ending really missing?
,missbinks,2011-05-31T20:43Z,"Nothing missing. Ends with the boy at the mirror, then credits."
,gansy09,2011-07-16T02:34Z,"Confirmed: the last few minutes of the film are missing. The movie ends with the boy in the mirror, then roll credits. This torrent ends when she crashes and then it cuts out, no credits. What a let down! "
