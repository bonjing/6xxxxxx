Comedian Carlos Mencia performs before a fully-packed house at a Hard Rock Hotel theater in Florida, weighing in on such topical issues as the prospect of a black president, gays in the military, and his recent trip to Iraq while keeping the audience in stitches with his trademark animated style. Whether pondering the use of the N-word or who the ladies always pick jerks over nice guys, Mencia always tells it like it is. Fans take note: in this performance, Mencia has been slightly enhanced to ensure maximum comic impact.
