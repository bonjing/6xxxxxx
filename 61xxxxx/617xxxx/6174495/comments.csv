,DocterSharpY,2011-02-15T02:54Z,This Will Be among the torrents I seed FOREVER.
,Free-Sharing,2011-02-15T04:57Z,old version.
,sthlm080808,2011-02-15T11:36Z,Hm.. do i need 2 download this ? i guess not.. or should i.. i cant decide... 
,DocterSharpY,2011-02-17T16:50Z,"@free-sharing It might be old, but the newversion is having problems so.. I'll update this when it's fixed.

@sthlm080808  It's perfectly safe... the only thing that can happen is you lose your accout do to a ban, therefore to fix that you make a new empty one."
,AudioGhost,2011-02-21T01:43Z,"I tryed installing, it does untill it gets to a file named downloader, then the program become non responsive, i try closing it with the Windows Task Manager, that doesnt work, and just close the program i got to restart the computer. When i log back in, Norton detects virus in downloader file... I, obviously, would not recommend downloading..."
,DocterSharpY,2011-02-23T17:19Z,"@AudioGhost  I May need to upload a better version if it's unresponsive... As for norton It will delete the file so that could be why it's unresponsive.. Just shut down the shields for like 15 minutes.  Then Install And you get the games..
Trust me, I don't want to upload a virus.. People Who do that are stupid with no life.
I personally run this program myself."
,NickOmouk,2011-02-23T22:37Z,Thx man !
,NickOmouk,2011-02-23T22:39Z,"Thx man, work great !"
,AudioGhost,2011-02-25T00:32Z,"ok im gonna try it again, prepare to be hacked if its a serious virus. but, i doubt its anything big, i can get rid of any virus really so it should be all good."
,AudioGhost,2011-02-25T02:22Z,"wow, i installed the recommended hack, it sucks ass and is just as good as every other one, all it lets you download is some valve games, not ALL the games. its just as good as the hack i already own. try making something that will actually let you have ALL the games, and not just a few."
,DocterSharpY,2011-02-25T23:53Z,"@audioghost:  The only way it's been see possible is if you download the GCFs and NCFs for all the other games.  The other Non-recommend versions have it where it shows all the games... you need the ncfs and gcfs... If you're completely willing to get them all... I'll give you a video on where to put them, etc."
,AudioGhost,2011-03-07T05:40Z,video????

I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO THE PIRATE BAY FOR GAMES AGAIN"
,E3Reaper,2011-04-04T19:48Z,Can I have free DLC too?
,ravesdurs,2011-04-08T06:04Z,"To all the people who wants to download it...
IT REALLY WORKS!!!

Follow the instructions on the readme.txt and your good to go.

@AudioGhost: You're stupid...You can download all the games, It's on the preference when you install cracked steam...So read it next time loser.

@DocterSharpY: You're the MAN!!! I'm gonna seed this like forever!"
,billiarn,2011-04-12T09:22Z,Its not really working for me if i try to install a game it says' steam is to busy to handle your request'.
,Notaplayer,2011-04-13T21:18Z,"read the comments.. 
could u like help m dl assassins creed DocterSharpy. From your comment @ audioghost u seem to be able..."
,Notaplayer,2011-04-13T21:21Z,so why isnt my comment showing
,Notaplayer,2011-04-13T21:22Z,"help me dr Sharpy if u can...
could u possibly give me the GCFs and NCFs for assassins creed so i will be able to download it."
,zebedy212,2011-04-14T20:17Z,why is it that when I try to download a game it keeps telling me to try again in a few mins. are the servers slow at peak times or are they onto the crack?
,DocterSharpY,2011-04-20T01:18Z,"Hey Everyone who commented, thank you for downloading, I have not answered you because my computer was messing up because of windows (linux FTW).
@audioghost  There's a video a guy made (for a thing like this, but different thing) I need to look for it again.
@notaplayer I will look to see if I can find this, (remember.. I didn't make this I just am helping it get around and help people enjoy) But I can't add it on  the list.

Although I didn't make this, Feel Free to ask questions, anybody, Only reason I won't answer is if I'm having pc issues! "
,DocterSharpY,2011-04-20T01:19Z,"@zebedy212
Those Are the ones You have to find GFCs And NFCs for, If you don't want to deal with searching just do the recommended version on the install list."
,tonttu13,2011-04-24T00:37Z,"greets, sounds sweet enough, specially about .gcf and .ncf in comments... but wait think i misunderstood something! Oh yeah, got orginal dvd of hl2 but will not give net->fail!
way-around? anyways, WELL DONE!"
,moonwalker14,2011-04-24T21:00Z,I can not call of duty black ops download
,mossy999,2011-04-30T03:34Z,Will this work for networking on Football manager 2011?? cos my footy manager is a cracked version so no steam with the game but i need steam for network play?
,omidchini,2011-05-07T10:53Z,"Hi, I want to play Portal 2 through steam, i have installed the SKIDROW version, how can i make it possible?"
,Senshuri,2011-05-12T19:13Z,"I recently dl this, but with Avast, it cannot scan the whole sector, and thats makes me wonder... Becuase it is passwords protected some files. And another reason, this crack must be copyed to the steam folder, so when you logg inn with your other real account, maybe it steals info or something?

Can somone verify this 100 %? I am still skeptical..."
,Senshuri,2011-05-12T19:18Z,CAn somone also post the games you guys have sucsessfully dl'ed? 
,Senshuri,2011-05-13T14:24Z,"I would recommend NOT to download this. First off, you can only dl some games, and those games are mostly cheap or shitty games, I think Steam can ban your real account too, in form of IP and e-mail adress. 

Just go the easy way don't use hack crak and just buy those game leagally. This is shit by uploader. You could have done more info on this but now I have. Don't dl this!"
,Duhya2,2011-05-26T06:44Z,Or instead of buying stuff we could just pirate games seperatly since this is the pirate bay and not itunes.
,MGimoro27,2011-06-05T07:58Z,Why Can't I Install any games? It just says Steam is too BUSY... What should I Do??
,AMoveFan,2011-06-12T04:57Z,"Wow Thank You DocterSharpY You are to generous I got into the list of games but when I try to instsall 1, it starts then says steam server is to busy now please try again later, Is this a bug and is there a way to fix it or is it really busy and Thanks again DocterSharpY for this, may you live in prosper lol. "
,AMoveFan,2011-06-12T20:22Z,DocterSharpY Please reply .
,DocterSharpY,2011-06-23T18:28Z,"Ok, Sorry Guys, Been away from my pc,  For and bugs, Update Version 
@senshrui,  This works that you always open the ""Cracked Steam"" Program, You make a new EMPTY account if you're afraid.. I actually recommend it. "
,SmokeTheChron,2011-06-30T20:11Z,is good hack or no?
,xwildmanx,2011-07-10T19:21Z,"do not download this at all, it is a virus that gets all your information, and it is all over the internet do not trust this at all."
,lakai12,2011-07-24T01:12Z,THANKS! works almost perfect some games didnt work but it works great!
,lakai12,2011-07-24T01:20Z,"if steams say ""servers too buzy, try again later"" litteraly keep trying eventually it will work"
,bouncedmrhappy,2011-07-24T20:42Z,Will this mess up the current Steam hack I have right now?
,bouncedmrhappy,2011-07-24T20:49Z,"Actually, never mind, this IS the Steam hack I use, so its safe to download. "

,Ardi4n,2012-01-16T23:38Z,"This fucking shit.. DONT DOWNLOAD..
This is only a intstall of the usual steam then if you unstal it and run the NORMAL steam it only getting an error.. The best part is that HE WILL STEALE YOU ACC.. You son of a bitch*
This is no fucking hack its a virus and it fuckup your computer. FUCK YOU MAN! A cant play CS no more and i have virus and errors. FUCK YOU"
,jsummers1,2012-04-12T13:32Z,"Reading the comments, I find the negative ones to be considerably less coherent or even moderately thought through. Everyone else it either worked for or a way was found for it to work. I'm sold. I'll give it a shot. I only have HL2 on my Steam account, anyway... so... feel free to steal it if you really want to lol"
,Ezio144,2012-04-22T16:08Z,"I want to download Black Ops, always that problem that shows up is ""Servers are too busy"" pleeeeeeeeeaase help me I do I fix this problem!??!/!
really want black ops...."
,g7755725,2012-04-28T00:30Z,"no since this is a hacked one you can get banned for that since its in there service terms and that message your getting, it's doing that because the ames are fake and they were added to steam thats why also steam has blocked the hacked one since they noticed alot of downloads one specific program that broke the tos of steam so it's better off not getting banned and buy the games form the non hacked steam"
,aaron.fogle,2012-05-21T17:28Z,i got it downloaded but how do i download games with out paying for them 
,JJ_PR,2012-06-02T02:18Z,Ok so with this I can download free games? or wht someone explain what this crack does and how to use it lol
