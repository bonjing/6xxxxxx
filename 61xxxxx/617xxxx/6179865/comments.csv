,Jackass Jimm,2011-02-22T06:37Z,"cool!  didn't know the new season was starting yet.

I'll wait for at least 4 episodes to be out before I download.

My new strategy for shows since last year is just let them play out their seasons and then watch them in one big marathon.  Doing that with House, Breaking Bad, and Smallville.  Did that with Lost and Dexter.  Only ones I opted to keep as guilty pleasures were Heroes and Survivor.

Definitely thinking if I should for Survivor...thinking not since I like seeing the ""panagona"" or whatever its called.

Plus, Russells back.  The guy is a straight ""playa"" in this game and the people in the jury have twice ignored his great game. "
,Frice,2011-02-24T18:10Z,"Just gotta say this show is just another cruddy reality tv show with very LITTLE to do with REAL SURVIVAL.

If you actually enjoy a true survivalist show check out Les Stroud ""Survivorman"". He goes out alone (he is the camera crew) and documents his survival in a wilderness over 7 days. None of this challenge bullcrap, just a man trying to make a fire or a shelter or catch some food with very little equipment.

If you like robinson curusoe as a kid this show is for you. Oh and fuck Man V Wild he ripped off Survivorman and added hollywood bullcrap, not to mention its all staged and the guy sleeps in a hotel at night where on the show he claims to sleep in the bush. Fuck Bear Grylls."
