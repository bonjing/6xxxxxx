,holabandola2,2011-02-14T16:16Z,Thank you!
,SoundBarber,2011-02-14T17:08Z,There is a problem with this file using MKV2VOB for PS3 conversion. The 'repairing AC3' message comes up and the audio has turned to chipmunks. Same thing with episode 2.  
,dnaks88,2011-02-14T20:57Z,try using gotsent for conversion. imo best app for mkv to ps3. you can get it here: http://www.videohelp.com/tools/GOTSent
,SoundBarber,2011-02-14T23:43Z,Thanks! I've downloaded the app and will try it out
,SoundBarber,2011-02-15T05:52Z,"My computer is too old and slow to handle the conversion. I don't know if it would have worked but, after 3 hours it was at 21% (for a one hour show??) I stopped the process and unless the file is re-posted guess i'm out of luck "
,AntwerpAnt,2011-02-15T17:32Z,FOV Fail.  AC3 has issues.
,mehest,2011-02-16T02:56Z,Albania episode?
,SoundBarber,2011-02-16T05:38Z,Albania is episode 3 which converts fine with mkv2vob
,AntwerpAnt,2011-02-22T22:44Z,"For PS3 [PS3ms] users having problems with the audio, I have fixed it here;
