,woodflute,2011-02-17T18:37Z,Is there a way to watch and listen while the subtitles are turned off? Thanks--

Kjempebra rip i god kvalitet dette."
,woodflute,2011-02-18T20:10Z,"Nice DL. We're watching it with the subs and the Paramount blurbs. Not so bad. The film is so engaging that you don't mind the low sound level  and the occasional blurbs and subs.
V=8, Sound 5. "

,zazoro_dela,2011-02-26T00:37Z,I would like to see some screens before downloading
,kawliox,2011-03-28T11:24Z,The quality is bad. Wait for DVDRIP
,Lazy-O,2011-04-06T19:41Z,Why put subtitles on the movie? i realy dont get it. You can dl your own language subs from subsearch.org...So why ruin the movie with swe sub?
,BackDaFuckup,2011-04-12T17:19Z,i guess people are too lazy and stupid too. I prefer english subs although im speaking and reading swedish and finnish.
,Cameigons,2011-04-18T04:38Z,"I've departed from windows so long ago I have little idea of how video players roll there. But how hard can it be to load a .txt sub? I mean, people should learn how to do this trivial stuff, it's good for their brain cells... :P"
,Gujvuj,2011-05-08T00:44Z,well i need hard subs becuse i stream throuh my xbox
,Karolina-57,2011-08-06T00:36Z,"Tack för undertexterna, tack för att de redan är på plats. En tant i mina år, kan inte alltid lösa saker och ting på nätet, så att få det ""förpackat"" är himla mockligt. Tack för bra kvalité."
