Three totally killer songs kick off Maguire's debut. The throbbing The Real 

World; the utterly transcendent The Borderline ("If we are like water then 

which drop is me") and the captivating If I Could See You.

Think about that for a sec. Any singer/songwriter would readily revisit 

Robert's crossroads to sign a deal with the devil for an introductory salvo like 

that. Add the extremely sad fact that most artists today won't have three killer 

tunes in a lifetime and you can see and hear how far ahead of the game you 

are with Stranger Place.

Though it's easier here to spot her influences (Ani DiFranco, Sarah 

McLachlan, Natalie Merchant) than on her equally fine and defining 

follow-up Keep Walking, Maguire's striking, real world lyricism renders Sarah 

and Natalie mute, while her emotionally textured arrangementsâ€”brought to 

life by bassist Christian Dunham and drummer Shane Nesicâ€”never wander 

into Ani-like self indulgence. Best listened to as a complete work of intelligent 

passion, other haunt-your-head tracks include Somebody, I Thought I Saw, 

Love Song and Stranger Place.
