                In his role as State Vet, Danny works with wealthy
                conservationist Anton Ziegler to catch a group of
                leopard hunters. Ziegler is in the process of buying
                a tiger from Vanessa, who is still struggling with
                her finances and desperately needs the money to
                ensure Mara's future. But when the tiger dies soon
                after arriving at Ziegler's, the finger of blame
                points at Alice. Meanwhile, Du Plessis is distraught
                to discover that the mining company wants to buy
                Leopard's Den in order to build an access road
                through their land.
