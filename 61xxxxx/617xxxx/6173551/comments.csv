,Kafeine,2011-02-15T09:34Z,":'( GeoStar  !! My game is here...
I already earn almost nothing....
You want to bury all of us (small independant Android Developper) or what?

No widget in the 1.24 :P...there's still a good reason to buy the 1.16 :D
I guess this will be corrected in the Games Pack Mars 2011 ??? won't protect it...don't want to bother my official users."
,alaqrity,2011-02-17T19:29Z,"@kafeine: i feel for you. i wish it was easier for app developers to survive on app developing! 

but you are on the pirate bay. don't be surprised what you find here. "
,azguy,2011-02-19T10:56Z,"I download apps here but if I find I truly use it, I go buy it.  A few bucks for an app is usually worth the price - it's the 15 minute trial period that drove me to acquiring cracked apps.  Blame Google."
,j_sodf,2011-02-24T22:52Z,"The only reason i download this is for Launcjer pro. And the only reason i don't pay for it is because i have to use paypal and I refuse to use their services (pay pal tries to silence the truth by workig against wikileaks). I actually want to pay for this app, but i canÂ´t. So until there is a reasonable way of paying for this app i will use the piratebay verison"
,j_sodf,2011-02-24T22:53Z,I meant launcher pro...
,j_sodf,2011-02-25T00:12Z,aaaaand apparently launcherPro wasn't even in this version pack but in the last version from february ;D
