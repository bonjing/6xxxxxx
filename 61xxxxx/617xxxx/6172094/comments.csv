,m0k3d,2011-02-13T18:34Z,I am seeding this in Utorrent but it still shows 0 seeds here on this site? Am I doing something wrong?
,annabelle31,2011-02-13T19:01Z,"You're doing it right. The number of seeds isn't updated immediately, it takes some time.

Just keep seeding and check the number tomorrow. You might be surprised."
,m0k3d,2011-02-13T19:22Z,yes I see that it has already gone up now - THANKS!
,tgjunk,2011-02-14T02:26Z,You should include a detailed list of the books that are in it.
,m0k3d,2011-02-14T02:38Z,"Great Idea, sorry I didn't do that! Now It seems like I cant edit the torrents description? It says ""edit temporarily unavailable""? I am not even sure if the list would fit in the description, but maybe I can post a link to a list here in the comments. Thanks again though - With a little help from you guys I am sure to improve on my torrents in the future! ;peace"
,m0k3d,2011-02-14T03:32Z,"Here is the list of PDFs in this torrent: http://justpaste.it/8dw

Sorry again I didn't get it in the description ;)

;peace"
,m0k3d,2011-02-14T03:39Z,"BTW there are 121 PDFs not 140! 140 was including the ""Supplemental"" folder files too... My Bad! "
,BowWowNow,2011-02-14T18:42Z,WOT!? Only 121? :o) Thanks.
