Brainiac: Science Abuse (often shortened to simply Brainiac) is a British entertainment TV show with a science motif. Numerous experiments are carried out in each show, often to verify whether common conceptions are true (such as whether it is possible to run over a pool of custard) or simply to create impressive explosions. The show centres on the three core branches of science for the key stages in British education: chemistry, physics and to a lesser extent, biology. The experimenters on the show are referred to as \"Brainiacs\", and each episode usually finishes with the destruction of a caravan.

The show is produced by Granada Productions and is broadcast in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland on Sky Digital.

The original presenters were Richard Hammond and Jon Tickle, then joined in the second series by Charlotte Hudson. Hammond left after the fourth, and was replaced by Vic Reeves and Hudson left after the fifth, and was replaced by Thaila Zucchi. The show\'s fifth series first aired on 8 May 2007 and the sixth, on 13 January 2008.

In July 2008, after the sixth series had finished, Sky announced they had cancelled the show due to the sixth series\' low ratings.
