,Laej,2011-02-16T12:28Z,So is it a virus/trojan or what? My a/v detected something as well.
,Gambit24,2011-02-17T22:18Z,nice try A-hole. The loader does nothing but infect your computer. The program still shows up as a trial version even when the loader is being used. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP!! I'll continue using the free version until someone REALIABLE decides to upload good torrent.
,eXoflow,2011-02-23T21:47Z,"@Gambit24

The only thing that is an A-hole here is your mouth."
,melissaishere,2011-03-02T09:57Z,This is a Trojan virus. Do not download!
,piratehunter3,2011-03-02T10:09Z,"don't download this piece of crap, it's a trojan."
,Omarlim,2011-03-10T18:03Z,so does it works??

,4819,2011-03-15T05:46Z,"BUNK!

for one my anti virus symantec removes the auto loader.exe so i must turn off my AV for it to work

second it only gives you trial version

,Zeptinune,2011-03-26T11:24Z,Isn't uploaded by someone trusted so I just went for Lite... not worth the risk of ruining my comp after I've spent months getting it to where I want.

,chazzo125,2011-03-31T02:42Z,"Once again an extremely good download is blighted either by those too dumb to know any different or by those inclined or motivated (by who knows who or what) to write malicious comments or to try to prevent P2P downloads eg by people working for major software companies. 

Turn off your anti-virus resident shield then install! If a keygen or cracked exe is still flagged, then add it to your AV exception list.

ANY torrent that has been around for a while, and has a good number of seeders is CLEAN."
,eXoflow,2011-04-09T22:58Z,"For everyone that doesn't get it, it is supposed to stay on 20 days remaining trial forever.

For everyone that think that there are a virus in it...yes there are. A mother.fUcker type which fucks your mum so badly lol

Deep inside the the encodage of the crack.
I'am sorry to deceive you but 
This one has issue and is compromising your home network. 
Trojan:Win32/Bumat!rts often infect computer without your permission at the background. (Emails)
-allow crackers remotely access to the computer. Without permis
-can spread via network if the infected drive is shared at the network.
