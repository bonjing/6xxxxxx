,gradnmom,2011-02-20T13:18Z,"this is cam shi*t, very low quality"
,Dallas.Maverick,2011-02-22T03:53Z,"It's watchable, not great but OK. A=7 V=7.   I have seen so much worse on here, at least this guy bothered to put the camera on a tripod and record it without people walking in front of him, unlike others I have seen.  The indoor/night scenes are dark but that is only 30% of the movie. 

Thanks for the upload Hiest"

,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2011-02-26T14:04Z,Can anyone comment on if this is a good movie or not? I got the quality down from the other comments but what about the actual movie? Guess I'll find out.
,Undietaker,2011-03-05T02:51Z,"I would rate A/V 7/10 dark in parts sound not clear at times, and people walking past all the time, why dont they take a leak before the movie starts?"
