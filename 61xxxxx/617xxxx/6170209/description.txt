These are the 2 of the best fights ever... the first one then 2nd being the rematch between the lowell based native micky ward. The movie "the fighter" is based off micky ward yet the movie did not cover these 2 fights, which are his best 2 for sure. The first fight was in mohgan sun in CT and the second one was in new jersey.
