,slicedt,2011-02-15T00:20Z,"Audio is decent.
Video isn't great, but it's still watchable. Everything is a bit dark (or too bright), there's some blur and its grainy. If this were an action flick, i'd say wait but it's fine for comedy.
I can ignore subs pretty well, so they don't bother me.

Thx uploader, i haven't watched the source vid but i'm sure this is better, judging by the comments on the other one.
Your dedication is appreciated."
