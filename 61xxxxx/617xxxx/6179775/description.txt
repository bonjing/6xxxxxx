        Happily ever after is just a song away

        When  dreams  and  destiny collide  anything  is  possible and
        wishes  can come  true -  take rising  young star  Elle as  a
        classic example.

        Elle (Ashlee Hewitt) dreams  of becoming a famous  singer, but
        is rocked  by the  sudden and  untimely death  of her parents.
        Forced to move to LA, she becomes trapped as a lowly intern at
        her uncle's (Thomas Calabro, Melrose Place) recording  studio,
        performing  menial  errands and  making  coffee for  obnoxious
        artists such as Sensation.

        A chance meeting with reigning Pop Prince Ty Parker  (Sterling
        Knight, Sonny With A Chance) thrusts Elle into a dramatic  mix
        of intrigue and romantic peril as Prince Charming embarks on a
        fulfilling  quest to  rediscover this  mystery girl  with the
        perfect voice once and for all.

        A  fairytale  of  hope, loaded  with  popular  music and  also
        featuring Keily Williams (The  Cheetah Girls), Elle: A  Modern
        Day Cinderella  Tale proves  that sometimes  dreams really  do
        come true and happily ever after is just a song away.
