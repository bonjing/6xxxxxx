ROBIN TROWER THE PLAYFUL HEART
Original Release Date: 2010 
Label: V-12 RECORDS
Format:Flac

Robin Trower has been heralded as one of the most influential Guitar players to come out of the British Blues Rock scene. Though other names may come to mind, none have the "signature sound and style" of the man who was tagged by the press with the nickname of "The White Hendrix" back in the 70's. Robin was in the audience during a performance by Jimi Hendrix those many years back, and he readily admits that the Experience changed his approach to the guitar. It is obvious to anyone who ever listened to Robin's music that he has taken the ethereal sound that Jimi first introduced to the world, and created his own unique way of expressing himself through the guitar. The result is a unique style of music all his own â€“

For Trowerâ€™s latest album, The Playful Heart, the guitarist offers his most subdued and quietly powerful work to date, featuring the most emotive songwriting and playing of his long career. On the guitar side of the equation, Trower blends his longstanding love of Hendrix (â€œDonâ€™t Look Back,â€ â€œAnd We Shall Call It Loveâ€) with his Blues exploration (â€œDressed in Goldâ€), dialing back the fireworks to craft a guitar sound that is supple and strong, never overly flashy or overwhelming and yet unmistakably his own.
