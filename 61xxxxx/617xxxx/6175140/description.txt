Aqua Teen Hunger Force (also known as ATHF or Aqua Teen) is an American animated television series shown on Cartoon Network's late night programing block, Adult Swim, as well as Teletoon in Canada. It is one of four spin-offs of Adult Swim's Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is one of the four original Williams Street series that premiered in December 2000, before Adult Swim officially debuted (the others were Sealab 2021, The Brak Show, and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law). Aqua Teen Hunger Force is the longest running original series on Adult Swim.[1]

The show is about the adventures of three anthropomorphic fast food items and their next-door neighbor in suburban southern New Jersey. The main characters consist of Master Shake, Frylock, Meatwad, and their human neighbor, Carl Brutananadilewski. Although the main characters besides Carl are fast food items, no explanation is given as to why this should be so in the cartoon. However, In the 2007 a feature film based on the series, titled Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, It is revealed that the three of them (including a fourth member, Chicken Bittle, who was killed later in the film) were created by Dr. Weird, just so they may fly themselves into a brick wall for his mere amusement. This film was released in 877 selected theaters throughout the United States. Another feature film, titled Death Fighter is planned for release in 2012.[2] The series has been cited as an example of postmodern humor.[3][4]

Episodes tend to lack clear plots and frequently place the main characters in bizarre, surreal, and often morbid scenarios. The initial premise of the show, concerning the three lead charactersâ€”Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwadâ€”solving mysteries was dropped in favor of intentionally incohesive storylines, improvised dialogue (often laden with non sequiturs), and absurd visual gags. Situations often involve the Aqua Teens being visited by strange monsters and extraterrestrial beings, most of which are of little power or consequence. An initially structured plot is often abandoned as characters' actions take the story far afield. Little continuity exists between episodes: regularly appearing characters frequently die in an episode, only to appear alive and well in the next. Since its release, Aqua Teen Hunger Force has developed a cult following, and its popularity resulted in three different spin-offs: Spacecataz, Carl, and Soul Quest Overdrive.

There is a reason why i upped this, the only collection copies i've seen in mp4 on torrent are incomplete, they dont have season 6 nor the movie included with it and i believe the community deserved a better torrent, right? These are converted to MP4, playable on Zune, PSP, and IPOD, and your pc if you want. Just dont be expecting no 1080 resolution of them they were designed for portables not your 56 inch wide living room tv.
