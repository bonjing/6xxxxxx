,ClimateDenial,2011-07-03T22:52Z,"I only grabbed S6, which is 480x480. However, the aspect ratio is not specified. Get mp4box and start terminal/cmd. Set the AR for each file with:
  mp4box -par 1=3:2 ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force - S06E01 - Gene_E.mp4""

I don't know what res the other seasons are, but they seem large. Short eps like this only require 40MB for 640x360."
