The Grand Highway  (1987)

"Le grand chemin" (original title)

IMDb Rating:  7.6

Whether you're male or female, you'll relive your childhood through two magnificent child actors in this wonderful and complex story that takes place during one summer in a small French town.

The story is about a precocious 10 year old local girl and a younger boy named Louis.  Louis is visiting for three weeks and is staying with his mother's friend Marcelle while awaiting the return of his expectant mother. The girl befriends the boy and has decided to share her secrets with him during their summer adventure together. The boy learns to overcome the many challenges he's faced with.

Discover how the young man not only personally transforms, but also has a healing influence on the childless couple that he's staying with.

And don't be deceived. This is not a children's film. Sure, a large part of it is about that feeling of discovery as a youth, but it is so much more. You will see the children's perspective of the adults, the adults perspective of the children, the children's perspective of the children, and the adults perspective of the adults.

This film ranks among my favorite French films such as Jean de Florette, Manon des sources, and Le chÃ¢teau de ma mÃ¨re.
