,VitoVino,2011-02-15T03:25Z,"Your welcome jakebot!  It's my pleasure to share this excellent film.  I spent 4 hours synchronizing the subs so they came out about as good as I could get.

It's my first upload to TPB and I have more great foreign language films.  This one has a little nudity in it and one brief fairly explicit sex scene, so I wasn't able to up it to the demon.

Enjoy!"

,VitoVino,2011-02-15T16:20Z,"It would be great if after you've viewed this film you could give it a rating on IMDb.  It's one of the films I'm trying to promote.

I've given it a (9) rating, but I'm very stingy about awarding a (10) to any film.

I ask you to rate TGH because the more people who appreciate quality films like this (with no explosions or shootouts), the more of us who will be sending a message to Hollywood.  Hollywood needs to get back to good storytelling and character development, and cut back on their addiction to CGI.

Thanks!

I'm still seeding when I can, and I often check if help is needed."
