,mrmakira,2011-02-17T23:48Z,"some people use the internet but dont really know how to use it.

Google Search for: audio sync
Find This: http://www.gromkov.com/faq/faq2004-0064.html
Read and Do the 2 Mins tutorial.
Add a Delay of 0.48 secs
Profit.

I mean, how hard is it to do something other than complain.

If u dont know how to Google Search then i'm sorry for u."
