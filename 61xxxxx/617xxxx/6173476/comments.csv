,Mac Genius,2011-02-14T15:22Z,only if seeding & the image worked
,TommyBRude,2011-02-14T16:56Z,"@ Mac Genius
People aren't really interested in seeding this guy's torrents anyway since all he does is upload other people's encodes or dupes of stuff VIPs have made better versions of."
,pinkpetal,2011-02-14T17:15Z,"All right chosen11one, here's one you can prove yourself with: The Break Up. There is no handheld version of it here at TPB, and I really want it for this weekend when I've got to travel. So, ul that for around 400 MiB's and I'll seed it for a month."
,pinkpetal,2011-02-14T17:40Z,"All right chosen11one, I've got one for you. Currently there is no handheld version of The Break Up and I want it. So if you could ul it and keep it around 400 MiB this week I'd be greatful. I'd like it for this weekend while I travel. Do that and I'll seed for 2 weeks. "
,pinkpetal,2011-02-14T17:55Z,I will seed it for a month. My internet is going in and out so I posted twice
