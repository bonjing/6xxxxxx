excellent cd of intimate, mellow music that draws some comparisons to bands like Coldplay, Travis, and Idaho; but a band like Doves would probably be a closer reference point. Lowgold soars light acoustic-based songs that are keen on the wistful melody and full of introspective moodiness. the music on Welcome To Winners is probably a little too mellow to garner extensive radio airplay, therefore depriving them of wild success stateside, but for those who like the solemn tone of bands like Red House Painters with the maturity of groups like Doves, Lowgold is a real treasure.
