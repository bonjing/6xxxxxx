Hive-CM8 NOTES
did the usual stuff, brightness, contrast, rgb, denoise and sharpness. resized a bit smaller because the faces looked too long in most of the moviescenes. audio is resynced to the serenity video since it didnt match on some places. also cleaned some noise and hiss. bitrate is 1800, there is no need for more enjoy
