If you don't like it you can go away,I didn't invited you to download or watch it.However it will be better to have file than using YouTube.

@zeromancer 
What you mean by ""trailers don't belong here !!""
you wanna say on TPB then i wanna tell that TPB is me for a place to share files that doesn't restrict whatever you wanna share.

No point leaving -ve comments if you don't like it go away you are not forced to download /Share."

Thnx"
,BarnicleBob,2011-05-19T22:16Z,"He aint saying that you can't share.  You just posted it under ""Video>Highres-Movies""  not under ""Video Clips"" like all the others.  It causes the search engine to list it like a High Resolution full movie, not a clip so, it is great and thank you but classified under the wrong heading.  You can't tell that it says total time 2 minutes xx seconds until after you click what looks like a full movie heading.  That all.  Just up/down loading etiquette on knowing what your doing when shareing.  Thanx!!!"
