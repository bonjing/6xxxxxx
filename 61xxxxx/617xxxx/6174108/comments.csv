,DMVIN,2011-02-14T17:06Z,"thanks
smaller sizes, yeah"
,bhailog,2011-02-14T17:25Z,"@formerly_azrielle wt da f**k do u mean by experimental?
20-40 is the only uploader who give us quality stuff"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-14T17:33Z,"@bhailog
While not disagreeing with your assertion that Mr. 20-40's uploads are above reproach with regards to quality, had you read any of the posted titles thoroughly, you would not have been afflicted with hoof in mouth disease--and would have kept your profanity to yourself."
,skillet92,2011-02-14T17:47Z,"Thanks alot for Being Human!
Wats wid the experimental?"
,sanyam123,2011-02-14T18:03Z,thanks 2040:-)
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-14T18:33Z,"Smaller, but quality suffers too much. I am too sick to re-write and re-compile my software (sometimes is even hard to type plain answer) and therefore I would try to squeeze best of my current tool-chain or - simply - fall back on so far ""accepted"" sizes and formats. Other ""small-sizers"" (encoders) could do and use new stuff, and I cannot. Well, it goes with ""territory""..."
,punk67,2011-02-14T18:52Z,thanks twenty forty
,coolasad,2011-02-14T18:55Z,Thanks for Episodes & Insecurity.

,jon4fun,2011-02-14T19:38Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

@ ALL - Please LOGIN (create an account if you do not have one) and click the [+] symbol beside QUALITY at top of page for ALL torrents you DL from 20-40. 
It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated for the genius that it is!

Cheers
Jon

@ 20-40 - Thank you for all your hard work. I look forward to seeing what you have managed to come up. Not everything can be a winner (Cinavia comes to mind for those in the 'know'). But if you don't try you'll never know.

Thanks for Californication, Family Guy, The Simpsons & Young Justice.

@ the HATERS [-] on quality - please fuck off elsewhere. Nobody is forcing you to DL anything!

@ Bhailog - Are you SERIOUSLY going to text in that 'tone'??? Don't hide behind substitute characters (f*&k). Just say what you mean. BUT a big WARNING! Show some fucking RESPECT for 20-40! How the FUCK do you think he manages to come up with these high quality/small-file size encodes? Do you remember [quark]? He spends nearly every waking minute of his life, which is being shortened even faster by assholes like you, coming up with new encoding techniques! The man is a living legend and doesn't deserve your crap! FUCK!!!!!! Comments like yours are just so STUPID!
This is from me so don't be hatign 20-40 - attack me if you want to - shithead!"
,r-0987,2011-02-14T20:40Z,dont want to fight! just one question - will you be doing the grammys? 
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-14T22:00Z,"Maybe Mr. Kickass has it, already waiting.
Well, kidding aside, Grammy show is 2h26 long and Live event, therefore out of my scope. I watched it, of course, and it's good one."
,dark_defender,2011-02-14T22:33Z,"Hi 20-40,
I sent you an email yesterday on gmail. Did you check it? Did not get any response there so i am asking here."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-14T23:03Z,"@dark_defender: Nope, and I check e-mail quite regularly, every few hours. If my address was right, wait few hours then resend a copy from your ""Sent Items""."
,the_shroud,2011-02-15T03:57Z,"Wow, just watched Californication on 37"" LCD TV and this experimental small size looked perfectly adequate.
Thx 20-40, you r a genius!!"
,Ataractic,2011-02-15T05:12Z,Thanks for Insecurity. And Episodes. And the Experimental quality is more than adequate for my purposes. Thanks once again!
,r-0987,2011-02-15T07:33Z,"Didn't mean anything bad! Was just saying that since I got part 1 already, I will just take part 2! Anyway, thanks for the simpsons!"
,ahmedv,2011-02-15T09:45Z,Thanks for Simpsons and DH
,hakuna_matata,2011-02-15T09:55Z,"20-40, Hit&Run problem is still there, TV Show Pack method is not working at all. Just look at any torrent after a week. :-( bro its time for seperate files man. "
,hkoraddi,2011-02-15T12:04Z,thanks for being human
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T12:05Z,"@hakuna_matata: Nope. Number of Hit&Runs depends on people, and I can't change that. If they want to grab and run, it is their problem, not of the normal human beings, nor mine.

Highest number of Hit&Runs have individual torrent of small files, especially comedy shows - constantly over 98.9% - and for years. [quark] died because of that, and nowadays small, individual torrents die within 48 h - title  doesn't matter, popular or unpopular, same thing happens. 

That haven't changed and it would be even worse.

Why? You know answer to that, I  think you can figure it out, even if I have second thoughts about 'cause you've missed to ask me about statistics (numbers don't  lie), you've failed to see pattern, you are unable to spot causality and - your ""diagnose"" and ""proposal"" is based on thin air. 

Least but no last, you have spoken a little to much from the high ground, as you are not a plain downloader, but an authority."
,highres99,2011-02-15T12:36Z,"Thanks Bro', more grease to your already GREASED elbows. Regardless of what the haters say, you are tha MAN. RESPECT!
@ haters!: This is from me- FUCK ALL YA MUTHAFUKING DICKHEADS!!! EAT SHIT 'N' ROT IN YR VOMITS!!!!!"
,AnshSach,2011-02-15T13:13Z,@20-40.. love this new expirement .. Do this more often.. :D
,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-15T14:37Z,"Echo AnshSach, but preferably with programs worth watching, though.  Can't stomach the simpsons, or family guy, and californication couldn't be any worse if it starred david duchovny--oh wait, it does star him.  sorry--just my opinion.  couldn't tell any diff between your average xvid avi and your experimental smaller filesize--and those of us with overcrowded hard drives (caused, admittedly by addiction to your downloads) would sure appreciate it--even if quality suffers a bit."
,the_shroud,2011-02-15T16:14Z,Quality on Californication was brilliant but the dark scenes of Being Human was a bit hard to distinguish. But thanks anyway man :)
,shaaani,2011-02-15T16:38Z,would u like to do Shameless 2011 series ???
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T17:30Z,"@the_shroud: Dark scenes from input haven't been altered, I never change brightness, saturation or contrast, maybe few times in the past I did, but not anymore. If people want sun-burned faces and ""colorful"" picture, so be it.
I am sensitive to aspect ratio however, and 98% of encodes of others have just that - especially in movies, where all Earth globes, moon and Universal logo of stars in the circle - appear as squashed. I always fix that.

Anyway, two things bare in mind: there is always price to pay or compromise must  be made. Second: x264 at extremely low bit-rates completely relies on psych-visual set of perception.

Btw, tag [experimental] mean ""quality and procedure fluctuates"", and you've experienced just that."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-15T17:32Z," to aspect ratio =  to wrong aspect ratio

Sorry."
[T],houruoha,2011-02-15T18:37Z,"thanks
:)"
,gtd005,2011-02-15T23:00Z,Thanks for all the packs/shows/movies you do always great quality.
