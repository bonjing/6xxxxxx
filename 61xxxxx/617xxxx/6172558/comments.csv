As you may know, he withdrew all of his addons and I was caught sleeping and did not get a chance to download his new version before it was pulled. If anyone has it and wouldn't mind sharing it with a fellow Orbinaut, I would be very gratefull. Thanks. "

,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-06-03T07:39Z,Another thing! injectors all over this torrent. Injectors are maleware and viruses. 26 of them inside the extraction. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-06-03T07:50Z,If any of you downloaded this and are infected. You will have to manually search for the trojans and also rename each folder and file to be able to delete this off your hard drive. However it does delete a window file that you can not recover with re-formatting your drive.
