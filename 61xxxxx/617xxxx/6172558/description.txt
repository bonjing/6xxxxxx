+ Precession MFD and Videnie Orbital Path Drawing prefer orbiter to not be in the graceful exit mode.
  Videnie Orbital Path drawing cannot be turned on or off within a simulator session - It can only be turned on/off by activating or deactiving the module in the simulation session startup config screen
~ The Yury Kulchitsky TX and Universal Cargo Deck addons did not have explicit Orbiter 2010 versions - may have some bugs, but they work for me.
