Otherwise we have to download some shitty program that tricks NBC into thinking that we're in America so we can watch them on the website. I'll never understand why fucking webisodes aren't made universally available, particularly for such a popular show. 

Get a fucking YouTube, NBC.

Thanks again. It'd be great if you could also upload the latest webisode 'The Girl Next Door' too! It'd also help if this had some seeders I could connect to. 

It sucks that the only thing I want to download for TPB which isn't illegal is the only thing I can't due to lack of seeds. "
