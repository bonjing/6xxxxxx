Was amazed that this movie wasn't here already, as it is historically important: it is the most possibly accurate retelling of the Christie case (as not only does it try to be very accurate but also was filmed where it happened, and shortly after, 10 Rillington place and the entire neighborhood was demolished.

Why is it important? Because the Christie case caused the banning of the death penalty in Britain, and other countries then followed this example. So it's essential viewing in any country considering changing its stance on the death penalty, for or against."
