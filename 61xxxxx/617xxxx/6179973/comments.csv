,kaintfm,2011-03-17T12:40Z,"27 copies uploaded, and yet I'm now the only seed.  Come on, people!  Help me out here!  You don't have to quit immediately, or at 1:1 when there's only 1 seed!

Ah well.  The nature of public torrents, I guess."
,kaintfm,2011-05-14T22:06Z,Over 60 seeds now including PEX and DHT.  Thanks everyone!
,Philonetic,2011-06-04T21:12Z,"New TRIGUN MOVIE: Badlands Rumble, I would upload instead except the shitty fucking upload section wont let me upload any torrents.  

Trigun Movie: Badlands Rumble 720p torrent here - http://www.nyaatorrents.org/?page=download&tid=183371

Trigun Movie: Badlands Rumble 1080p torrent here - http://www.nyaatorrents.org/?page=download&tid=183372

If somebody could upload them to TPB that'd be great.  Or if TPB would fix the fucking uploads or unblock me from uploading it'd be even better."
,xenoFLASH,2011-08-16T21:57Z,why no english subs?
,kaintfm,2011-08-28T04:09Z,"There are English subs.  Make sure you're using the right codecs.  Should have FFDShow, or using MPC-HC's subtitler, or something similar."
