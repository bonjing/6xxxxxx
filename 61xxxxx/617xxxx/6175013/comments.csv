,swin21,2011-02-16T18:54Z,"Thanks alot, perfect. ill seed it for a week or so"
,swin21,2011-02-16T19:00Z,"asheqo, ive had the same problem before and never found out why, so i had to download VTV's version and it worked, give it a try, you might find its a one time problem. and VTV are as realiable as EZTV, just not as quick to upload. good luck"
,Kekkai,2011-02-17T05:51Z,"Sure, by all means seed this -- but not right now.  Right now there are thousands of seeds.  It's far more helpful for the bittorrent community to seed it in a few weeks - when the herd has moved on, so to speak and people who didn't get it right away want it.

I try to seed older stuff, things that would otherwise be in danger of not being seeded or have too few seeds.  It's not a lot to add yourself to the thousands, but in a month or two or six - THEN seeding this (or anything else that came out ""a while"" ago, whatever a while is to you) is really helping people out.

Just something to be considered. :)

Thank you, EZTV, download in less than 6 minutes, great quality as always.  We're all very grateful."
