                    Total Uninstall Professional v5.9.1 + Crack



Release date: 11 January 2011 (updated TU version 5.9.1)


Crack Info:
*********** 
The crack is a cracked "Tu.exe" program file and a patched "Program Options.dat" 
file. So the crack is not a loader, patch, trial reset, or other kind of crack.
No program online registration required, and fully registered and unlocked! 

Version v5.9.2 of Total Uninstall is basicly only a protection update, and 
the developer removed the ability to patch the file "Program Options.dat". 
Therefore updating to Total Uninstall v5.9.2 is NOT necessary.



Program Info:
*************
Total Uninstall - powerful installation monitor and advanced uninstaller.
Total Uninstall is a complete uninstaller which includes two working modes.

Installed Programs module analyze existing installations and create a log with 
installation changes. It can uninstall programs even without the help of the 
supplied Add Remove program.

Just select from the list the program that you want to uninstall and in a few 
seconds Total Uninstall will analyze it and will show in a tree view detected 
files, folders, registry keys and values of that program. You can review the 
details and remove some of the detected items. 

Total Uninstall is ready to uninstall the analyzed program. It will use first 
the supplied Add Remove program and will continue removing remaining items using 
the log. 

Monitored Programs module helps to monitor any changes made to your system during 
the installation of a new program. It allows you to perform a complete uninstall 
without having to rely on the supplied Add Remove program, which can leave files 
or changes behind.

Total Uninstall creates a snapshot of your system prior to installing a new 
program. After the installation has completed it takes an additional snapshot.
It then compares the two snapshots and displays all changes in a graphical tree 
view, marking all registry values and/or files that have been added, changed or 
deleted. Total Uninstall saves these changes and, if you decide to uninstall the 
program, it will reverse the changes to the previous state.

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. Avira AntiVir Premium 
3. avast! Pro Antivirus
4. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
