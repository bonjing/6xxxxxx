,benson828,2011-02-24T14:23Z,"Having problems with this RH. Hope you can help.
When I click on 'Register' it says 'a firewall is blocking the connection'."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-25T06:36Z,"@benson828

If you disconnect from internet, then copy/paste the crack to the install directory, then launch the program,
and then register, then the program should be registered rightaway, without checking for an internet connection.

That's what's already written in the install notes."
,benson828,2011-02-25T10:43Z,Thanks for the reply. Looks like it was due to an older version not removed fully. Rolled PC back to earlier Ghost image and then it installed fine.

,peterpan1971,2011-03-11T02:59Z,I tried to install it today but I failed. I have Vista and I couldn'y find any file Program Data? So after trying to registser was saying that it failed as couldn't confirm my password due to firewall(I wasn't connected). Can someone help me? Please.
,theoriginalphantom,2011-04-05T10:32Z,"@peterpan1971
Try going to control panel, folder options, and enable view hidden files/folders. Program Data folder is normally a hidden folder, so that should get you sorted mate. Best of luck.
Thanks for this RH, muchly appreciated."

,YamiKuro,2011-04-30T23:36Z,"I've tried installing this on two different windows 7 installations now... My first try I thought was because my previous version of Tu wasn't removed properly but now on a fresh (just purchased) computer I've installed the firewall, turned the internet off, and followed your instructions exactly the way they are in the read me but when I get to the registration part it tells me that ""A firewall prevents Total Uninstall to validate online your license""
Thank you for the upload anyway RH, I have successfully used some of your other torrents and they've all worked great."
,Radicai,2011-07-20T18:36Z,"Thank's RH, at first it wouldn't accept the username and key, every few seconds it kept coming up register, so I done it again and then afew seconds later it came up again. (Then I found I had hit allow in the firewall rather then block lol) so blocked it went back to the files in ProgramData removed them all again and put the patched one in, now it works a treat.  Thanks again RH +1"
,cernwulf,2011-07-26T11:41Z,"CONFIRMED and WORKING on Windows 7.

This works fine and I didn't even have to configure the firewall. Just make sure you follow it step-by-step, and remove any previously installed versions.

MAIN STEPS TO NOTE:

- Disable your internet connection during the initial run of the program:
WindowsKey + R > ncpa.cpl > right-click adapter > Disable

- Edit the hosts file AFTER registering with the serial, otherwise T.U will detect it (this isn't specified in the instructions, I only discovered it myself). 

Once cracked, registered, updates off, and the host file is edited/saved, then you can re-enable your internet connection and everything is hunky-dory."
,a4711x,2011-10-10T06:19Z,Don't waste your time. Does not work. You will have to log on to the internet for registration. But registration data are blocked in the meantime.
,cernwulf,2011-10-18T07:27Z,"I had to install this again on another Windows 7 system and had problems but finally worked out the solution.

Note: The hosts file must be unedited to begin with!!

1. Disable internet and install. Don't launch program after.

2. Copy cracks

3. Reboot into SAFE-MODE (this was the key)

4. Run the program, register the serial, and set the updates to Manual.

5. Close it and reboot back into normal mode.

6. Add the entries to the hosts file if you wish (not necessary)

7. Then re-enable internet connection."
