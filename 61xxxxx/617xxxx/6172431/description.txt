Wiley - Professional Windows 7 Development Guide.

Everything you need to immediately get the most from Windows 7

This essential and unique book delves into the various elements that Microsoft fixed from Vista and investigates the new features that Microsoft added in response to user requests. Veteran author John Paul Mueller shows you how to work with security policies as well as manage the Windows Firewall in every way conceivable-both of which are topics you wonâ€™t find anywhere else. In addition, he presents a clear, procedural approach to working with trigger-start services, details how to make the User Account Control part of an application, and shows how to use Group Policy Objects to work with the Windows Firewall. Ultimately, youâ€™ll discover how Windows 7 provides practical, usable functionality, just waiting for you to exploit.
