,docd87,2011-08-10T22:21Z,"very bad imo. made worse by the unparallelled bad narrator. she tries to do this porn flick voice. which is quite annoying and distracting. and she simply READS out of a script. i mean, listen Laura C. Schlessinger, she can actually read a script without sounding like she does. she TELLS you. she narrates. or even better, listen to Tracy Brian. that guy sounds like he just talking to you. he aint reading nothing, he is like telling you from his heart.

this audiobook:
content 2/5 -not anything we cant learn from other better books
narrator 1/5 - bad
overall 1/5 - avoid it"
