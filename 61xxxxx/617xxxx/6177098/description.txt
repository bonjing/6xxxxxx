(Guys, I screwed up my first shot at this, but I believe that I got this one right. I didn't use WinRar on this one, I'm just uploading the actual .pdf)

The Antique Bowie Knife Book, 1990 edition, by Bill Adams, J. Bruce Voyles, and Terry Moss.

IBSN: 0-9626044-0-2

This 556 page book is full of beautiful pictures of antique Bowie knives. There are approximately 252 knives depicted in the book.

This book was limited to 1100 copies, and is VERY expensive, if you can find one.

I checked the book out of the library and painstakingly scanned ever page, photos and text. I then combined them all into a .pdf format that you can read on your computer like a book. 

I hope that everyone enjoys this book.
