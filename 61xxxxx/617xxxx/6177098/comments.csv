However, I'm still new at this, so if anyone can explain what, if anything, is wrong, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks."

Other Torrent Sites will pick this torrent up (knives are popular item); as they pick it up then different trackers will used, so it is better to add some more public trackers"
