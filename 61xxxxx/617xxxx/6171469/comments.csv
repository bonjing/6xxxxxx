Any ideas?"
,mazzila,2011-04-21T21:59Z,"happens to me too. it worked at first, but then I accidentally uninstalled it. and when I reinstalled it, i never got the chance to finish the installation, so when i open the program it tells me to create a catalog or something"
,dxxbro,2011-04-22T19:15Z,"Is there any way of stopping the online(i guess) serial check? 

Lightroom itself is working fine, but when you try to install a plugin it says that plugins have been disabled because the serial is a ""commonly pirated"" one."
