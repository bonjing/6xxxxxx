,kahlilnc,2011-02-27T19:36Z,Does your ps3 need to jailbroken or hacked for this game to work? I am clueless right now
,josevaldo,2011-02-27T22:50Z,"It works fine on CFM 3.55!
For sure this will be the best FPS of the year!

@kahlilnc
you need a hacked ps3 to work, one with a custom firmware installed."
,shahwill,2011-03-01T23:40Z,"hey guys i am stuck on the ""update 1.03 is required screen"", it always freezes

setup - i downloaded off here/ps3ISO and transferred it to internal off a flash drive
i had to split up the 9GB file into parts so i split it using PS3SPLITTER and put those parts in same spot in ps3
im using geohot + wut and it doesnt work on either multiMan or Gaia (both newest version)
im in usa

any help would be appreciated :)"
,shahwill,2011-03-02T00:07Z,"ok im making progress
i figured out that u must put a _ before the folder name in comgenie
but now when i use Gaia / multiMAN it says
You cannot launch split games!
plz help guys! i've been seeding it for days now!"
,josevaldo,2011-03-03T15:02Z,"@shahwill

Do you still have the non-splitted file on your PC? Try to transfer this non-splitted  file whithout a flash drive direct to ps3 internal HD. You do this using a FTP connection betwen your PC and the PS3.
You can find a HowTo Guide on Google, just type ""PS3 FTP connection"".

Good Luck"
,shahwill,2011-03-04T09:18Z,"Thanks a lot @JoseValdo

,wtf911,2011-03-12T13:44Z,"Must be played on external. For the time being loading of split file games on external is not possible. We can hope for NTFS or split file support in the future. 

If just getting the game skip the 1.03 update first, install the game data, then you can go back and update."
