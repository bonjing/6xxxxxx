Plot:
An alcoholic Los Angeles narcotics cop, Matt Scudder, takes part in a drug bust that results in his fatal shooting of a small-time dealer in front of the man's wife and kids. Scudder ends up in a drunk ward, suffering from booze and blackouts, damaging his career and his relationship with daughter and estranged wife.
A prostitute named Sunny comes to him for help. Scudder is introduced to wealthy drug dealer Angel Moldonado and his woman, Sarah, who is a friend of Sunny's and very likely a high-priced hooker herself.
Sunny is found dead and Scudder falls off the wagon. Sarah tries to tempt him with alcohol and sex while Scudder attempts to infiltrate Angel's business, posing as a dirty cop. This results in a San Pedro warehouse shootout involving Angel and a mutual friend, "Chance" Walker. A final confrontation occurs on the tramway of Angel's hillside home.
