    Tony Robinson takes his merry band of archaeologists to    
    Leicestershire to investigate life and death in Anglo     
    Saxon Britain. The Team are intrigued by metal           
    detecting finds and pottery scattered across the fields   
    which suggest they're on the site of a high-status         
    Anglo Saxon burial ground.                                
    By the end of the first day there's no sign of a         
    cemetery, in spite of the evidence. But all that          
    changes the next morning with a flurry of activity         
    revealing burials, cremations and a glimpse of gold.      
    Days of frantic digging reveal every type of Anglo       
    Saxon burial - and perhaps the finest piece of            
    jewellery ever discovered on Time Team.                    
                                                              
    And the Team explore the unique way the Anglo Saxons     
    celebrated their dead, when one brave digger stands in    
    for a dead Anglo Saxon on a funeral pyre, in a fiery       
    recreation of a cremation.
