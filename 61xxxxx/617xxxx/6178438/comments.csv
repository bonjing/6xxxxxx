,tpb1106,2011-06-17T18:20Z,"hi thethingy, thanks for the torrent. i pls need your help for a RE-installation. 
I have v9.3.3 extended installed and wanted some time back make an update to v.9.3.4. This want wrong as it installed another - Adobe Reader X v10.0. After a few weeks v.9.3.3 stopped working telling me ""you can not use this product at this time. you must repair by uninstalling and reinstalling this product"".

Now I need to de-install both (BTW I have the whole of CS5 installed and want to keep it save) in order to install your torrent v9.4.2

Question:
-- which tool I need to make a clean deinstallation of BOTH acrobat without affecting CS5?

Hope for soon reply. Thank you very much for all your effort."
,tpb1106,2011-06-17T18:37Z,cool :(
,cwgate,2011-08-02T02:56Z,"Having now spent 3 days installing and deleting and editing hosts and copying dlls and running tools I have come to the conclusion this is just a standard install and is not licensed.  The prompt for a licence Accept just keeps popping up then it closes.   Totally useless. 
Windows XP SP3 with all updates up to date.
No other Adobe product installed."
,filthyf,2012-04-16T07:44Z,"Ive seen alot of comments stating the usual ""licensing for this product"" expired, no longer works, etc. I have used this torrent on several PC's and recently got the error.

go to thethingy's torrent list and download

""Adobe Clean Install & Error Toolkit V4""

READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY! Thethingy's torrents WORK, and his instructions are PERFECT. Use them step for step and they will never fail.

Thanks thethingy!"
