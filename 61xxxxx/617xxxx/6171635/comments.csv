,joshua1964,2011-03-19T11:26Z,Eglish no German please.
,jiggysiggy,2011-03-26T02:17Z,"no German? why? this is an international website and my message is supposed to be understood by my fellow German citizens and homies. I just told them that all hurt-locker-torrents are under surveillance of a dubious law firm called ""waldorf and frommer"". they sued me for 1000 euros just because I downloaded this shitty american war-propaganda movie. in Germany it has become really dangerous to download stuff via bittorrent, thanks to our neo-fascist angela-merkel-government. I've always been a huge piratebay-fan, but now I am risking a ten thousand euro fine, if I am downloading again. that's why I wanted to warn my fellow German citizens, so I decided to tell 'em in German, because not all Germans speak English. well, no offence buddy, didn't mean to annoy you. peace!"
,sexto57,2011-04-26T22:59Z,"Is this ripped from the German version or the English version? I downloaded the one released THUGLiNE and it's from the German version, but they don't tell you that. So all the hard coded titles are in German. It's really annoying to have to download a 10GB+ file to find out it's from a foreign version because the poster didn't let you know.

Don't get me wrong, I got nothing against foreign releases, I just want to know what I'm downloading. :)"
