,pirate_share_the_love,2011-06-02T05:38Z,yea this is fucking annoying. Didn't work as it is. Apparently you need to track down a bunch of other files to make it work.

,gbot8888,2011-10-30T12:52Z,"works perfectly, one question.. every time I save whilst still playing the game it loads fine if I die etc.. but if I turn off the emulator & try to come back to a saved game at a later point it says there is nothing on the memory cards, any tips ?

other than that it works great."
,celdric,2011-11-03T01:21Z,I'm kinda new at this and I'm having problems running ePSXe.  The instructions say that using any plugin will work but when I try to configure the Video but I don't have anything to choose from.  I tried downloading and installing video plugins but i keep getting errors saying that the module might not be compatible with x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of regsvr32.exe
