,dav9,2011-02-17T21:30Z,Hi.  I can't get a good serial off the keygen.  Any suggestions?  Thank you for your help.
,EnTek,2011-02-19T07:15Z,"I have not heard of the problem, maybe try uninstalling and then move the .rar file to the c: drive (where all the system and program files are), then extract the files and run setup from there.  or try these: 

5B77D-LN5LU-3KGC6-8GAQJ
5BF7Y-A64JY-226DB-7DTQK
5B79Y-V7K2V-326AB-89U8J
5B7NV-4PJQS-KK6CK-9DBQ3
5BFQT-TZRLS-35FAG-PGA8J

Let me know if you got it fixed.  It worked perfect for me first time so I do not know why you are having problems.  You can email me anonymousperson2011@yahoo.com "
,EnTek,2011-04-06T03:55Z,This works great and I have installed it on at least 10 peoples computers.  (Patting myself on the back).
,teeny555,2011-04-29T20:49Z,I downloaded this and did a precautionary scan. It showed a trojan virus!
,EnTek,2011-05-11T07:17Z,"The trojan virus that showed up is the keygen you moron.  It works great and there is not a virus.  If you do not know, most keygens give false positives as virus's."
,tavakolimehran,2011-07-08T02:12Z,Do not know how to come up with the installation code. The READ ME file is blank.
,tavakolimehran,2011-07-08T02:13Z,"Do I really need the installation code? 
is it ok to be connected to internet after installation?
someone please."
,tavakolimehran,2011-07-08T02:16Z,is it ok if I am connected to the internet after installation?
,flarvik,2011-07-20T22:29Z,"The keygen works if you choose ""Register by phone"" and follow the instructions from there.  It will not work if you try to register via internet."
,dad24boyz,2011-08-06T18:23Z,I have tried all the keys as well as ones from the keygen and all of them are not valid.  I called the number expecting to get an automated system and I get a live person.  They are of no help.  Can you help me with this?
,EnTek,2011-08-07T11:24Z,"IT WORKS PERFECTLY IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY.

FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS !!!!!!!!!!!!"
,dad24boyz,2011-08-12T15:58Z,Thank you for your response.  I have followed your directions exactly.  The keygen comes up not problem and gives me the key.  I call the number and get a live person every time.  They tell me the keys are not valid.  Am I missing something?

,brycem,2012-05-02T20:54Z,"EnTek...I've downloaded the torrent...but when I run it in WinZip well I can't fine which files to run as the install...I've tried to read the instructions but as the comments earlier say...they are BLANK and of no help...so if you could give me some help that would be GREAT! I really appreciate it as this program would help my company greatly.
