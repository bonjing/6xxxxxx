,NitrogenUA,2011-02-13T19:45Z,"Data Install worked on my 6.20 TN-C, but didn't - on 5.50 GEN-D3. Anyway, i don't really consider this feature to give us any speed-up."
,Morexion,2011-02-13T19:46Z,"Didn't work on my PSP (1004) 5.50 D3 Promethus 4. Atleast the Tactics Ogre.rar. It just freezes before the first battle. I will try the other rar and let ya know how it goes.

Anyone else have this problem?"
,cincogiur,2011-02-13T23:51Z,"Registered to tell you you're awesome. I have 5.50 GEN-D3, I'm only at chapter 2 but so far works perfect.(Except data install, but who cares about that.)"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-14T01:29Z,"Thanks mate, really appreciate that. Though i'm feeling bad lately, because of fact that i don't own any of these games that i upload, and equally because some developers (like Square Enix) work so hard to bring us good games. So i'd really like to show my gratitude, bying their games. Hopefully things will change for me. Peace."
,cincogiur,2011-02-14T01:36Z,"If it makes you feel any better I usually buy the games that I like, they just come out waaay later in my country, and i hate to import :)"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-14T02:41Z,"A little better now, thanks :) Maybe i should even advocate for buying games, which will look kinda grotesque... Shame, modern games cost so much :\ Not like that 4-10 bucks jewel-dvds five years ago..."
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-14T02:48Z,"Morexion, have you tried different Umd Iso Modes? I use Sony NP9660 mode for this one, aswell as for almost all other games. Cheers."
,Gyakuto,2011-02-14T05:08Z,"Why are some people always cry about Data Install? Why would people want to install data when the damn program isnt even run from UMD.
The game is already on a damn mem card.
And some people seriously install part of it on it again hoping to get better performance.
It's really hilarious...

But thnx for the release"
,1Macedonia,2011-02-14T10:43Z,"Guys i have the same problem,after introduction when u go to fight in the first castle my game freezes and my psp goes off...my version is 5.50 Prome 4...PLEASE somebody help..any sugestion on what 2 do???"
,Ninjen,2011-02-14T13:10Z,"@ Gyakuto

Some games feature extra goodies

One example would be voiced radio transmissions in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, which require data install

Otherwise, you are correct in saying that it's a waste of memory space and that it wouldn't shorten loading times at all (in case anyone else didn't already know, Data Install is really meant for UMD games, for it shortens loading times and increases battery life)"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-14T15:13Z,"1Macedonia, do you use Tactics Ogre.rar? And not the patched one? Hopefully we'll hear from Morexion. Meanwhile, you can try different Umd Iso Modes, aswell as second rar-file. Otherwise, i don't have a clue really, cuz i never spoiled my sacred D3 with that prometheus thing. Sometimes it makes games totaly unlaunchable. Though, i can not deny titanic work of Liquidzigong, who developed it."
,Ninjen,2011-02-14T18:20Z,"In this torrent, there are two copies of this game.

Tactics Ogre.rar (Clean version)
Tested on PSP-1001 5.50 Prometheus-3
Crashes right before start of the opening battle. 

Tactics Ogre patched.rar (Patched)
Tested on PSP-1001 5.50 Prometheus-3
Plays right through the first battle. Doesn't seem to have any problems. 

If anyone encounters any problems, try skipping the cutscenes. it got me just a bit further on the clean .iso, but still crashed a few seconds into the battle. i havent encountered any crashing in the patched .iso yet

"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-14T21:14Z,"Big thanks for info, Ninjen, hope it'll be helpful to others. I decided to keep both verisons basicaly because there could be trouble launching patched games on any kind of prometheus. Couple of times i already saw how patched games failed to work on prometheus, that's why i've added clean version too. Also, i'm using exactly the clean version on my 6.20 TN-C with Prometheus Iso Loader v1, and it works like a charm."
,1Macedonia,2011-02-14T23:20Z,"NitrogenUA:im using the original copy of the game which is 1.50 gb.right know im downloading the rar version,hope it'll work,thanks for sugestion mate...i'll late u know"
,Herz_F,2011-02-15T03:48Z,"Thnx for upload.
By the way, you can always patch clean *.iso files by yourself, using EDecrypt and UMDgen."
,xtian3,2011-02-15T05:55Z,"tnx for uploading the unpatched version, ;D"
,sjssaludez,2011-02-15T14:53Z,"Loving it. =)

,Ninjen,2011-02-16T11:58Z,"No, it is not possible to use EUR saves with a USA game, at least to my knowledge. Also, you cannot convert them into one another. "
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-16T20:41Z,"Combate, to be honest, patched iso from this release works fine on my 5.50 GEN-D3."

,NitrogenUA,2011-02-17T13:43Z,"Try using 7-Zip for unpacking, might work. Good luck. http://www.7-zip.org/download.html"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-17T14:31Z,"GramophonPT, you can use this tiny application called PSPident 0.73. It'll show you technical info about you console. The output will be similiar to this: http://img502.imageshack.us/i/pspident000.png/"

,JIHUIN,2011-02-24T11:14Z,Hi mate! ...just want to ask if you have Ys I & II Chronicles [English]? Thank you very much in advance and have a nice sailing day :)
,Ninjen,2011-02-24T22:20Z,"In every battle with Ninja/Kunoichi, the AI seems to take about 3 - 8 seconds when performing actions with Ninja/Kunoichi class. Just a minor annoyance, I was wondering if anyone also had this problem"
,88Titan88,2011-02-25T01:15Z,"Patched version works fine here! Thanks, Nitrogen! :D "
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-26T03:06Z,"JIHUIN, hi, mate! Yeah, i've got my hands on it recently, though beeing unable to launch it in any way.

You mean, when Ninja/Kunoichi is on your party? Cuz i've already fought against both and they performed as fast as other classes. And btw, Kunoichi is a female-class for Ninja, right?

88Titan88, you're welcome mate.

Speaking of gameplay, the only thing bothering my atm is unability to predict tactically needed set of characters before battle, since you have no idea about the landscape\weather until you enter the location. Which is leading to replaying most locations at least once, and that without considering the difficulty of battles themselves.

P.S.: Targeting at 1TB upload for this one and almost done :)"

""You mean, when Ninja/Kunoichi is on your party? Cuz i've already fought against both and they performed as fast as other classes.""

Nvm, I set the in-game CPU clocking speed to 333/166, which seemed to solve it. it was just annoying because of the few levels where there were about 5-7 enemy ninjas running about"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-27T19:07Z,"glad to hear you've overcame the problem.

I like this game much, if it only could cost "
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-27T19:08Z,*about 15 bucks or less :\
