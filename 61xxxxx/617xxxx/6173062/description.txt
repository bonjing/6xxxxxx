STORYLINE
After 10 years in prison, Driver has a singular focus - to avenge the murder 
of his brother during the botched bank robbery that led to his imprisonment. 
Now a free man, he's finally on his mission...but with two men on his trail, 
a veteran cop just days from retirement, and a young egocentric hitman with
