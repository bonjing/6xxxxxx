,XyberB,2011-02-18T00:56Z,Forgot to mention that it also works with the RNS315.
,MojsterB,2011-06-06T17:06Z,What about Slovenia maps?
,kemphoon,2011-06-10T10:54Z,How burning without an imagefile? Please help
,MojsterB,2011-06-17T18:50Z,You must burn with program which is included!!

Should I burn these files to CD, using the program cdrwin. And then put them in my nav system in the car or what? You can reply in english german or dutch."
,XyberB,2011-08-15T18:08Z,"Yes, burn the images with cdrwin (included), then insert the disk in your satnav with SD-card inserted. The satnav will ask if you want to install the data from CD to SD. You can use a CDRW, saving you money if you want to install all the maps."
