Hey all. Commenter Oswald the Octopus on Engadget. 

Recorded this live so all of you could get listen to this without having to wait for Trent. I will try to do this as much as possible. No credit to me. Everything contained is Engadget\\\'s. (I did view a Samsung site with a popup)

This is my first time at this so don\\\'t hate. If this is illegal, AOL or Engadget can contact me at oswaldocto@gmail.com. I mean no harm.

Cheers!
