New Year's Special

Welcome to the online premiere for the two-hour Live from Darylâ€™s House, A New Yearâ€™s Eve Special, which garnered record ratings for WGN America in Chicago, where it first aired last Dec. 31. The show features highlights of the previous three years of LFDH, as Daryl Hall collaborates with Rob Thomas, Neon Trees, Train, Smokey Robinson, John Oates, Todd Rundgren, Sharon Jones, Eli Reed, Patrick Stump, Toots, Fitz and the Tantrums and Jose Feliciano, typifying the showâ€™s eclectic mix of veteran performers and the next generation of musical superstars.

When it made its broadcast premiere, Live from Darylâ€™s House, A New Yearâ€™s Eve Special improved ratings on WGN America 75% for the time period among adults 35+, with a whopping 102% increase for the Friday 1-3a time slot, as well as an increase of 143% in women 25-54.

â€œFrom the reactions weâ€™ve received since the show started almost three years ago, I knew we had something unique,â€ said Daryl. â€œAnd the broadcast TV ratings simply bear that out. Itâ€™s very gratifying and a tribute to the many talented artists whoâ€™ve appeared on the show. If you build it, they will come.â€

Tribune President of Programming Sean Compton told an audience at the recent NATPE programming convention that he was delighted with the results, pointing to Live from Darylâ€™s House as a prime example of what it takes for a web series to succeed on traditional TV. â€œItâ€™s an Internet show we slapped on and reached 78 million homes without much promotion,â€ he said. â€œThat it did so well is a testament to the organically grown program itself. Darylâ€™s show makes television cool. There is a certain vibe to it that television could use more of.â€
