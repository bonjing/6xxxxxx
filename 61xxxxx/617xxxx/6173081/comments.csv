,captainboggles,2011-03-17T22:11Z,"many reviews say that the original wages of fear is better, but... this is by far the best... music by tangerine dream, awesome trucks, total adventure movie....  Thank you so much. my vhs copy is worn out....  "
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-03-17T23:53Z,"@captainboggles: Agreed! I saw the original after the one, and while good, this is better (also being in color is a bonus.) I liked how the characters are developed before they get to the locale, explaining why they are in such a place (also their previous occupations become essential to completing their mission.)

I only uploaded this just over a month ago... I was amazed that it wasn't here already given how recent/good it was, but when released it suffered from bad timing and was unexpectedly eclipsed by Star Wars so mostly forgotten.

If you liked it, I'm always happy to get a ""+"". ;^)"
,captainboggles,2011-03-19T09:58Z,"just reading the IMDB blurb, I discover there are different versions of this movie, mainly the U.S and european, markedly different in the editing. I guess this is the european version..  be interesting to compare..  "
,captainboggles,2011-03-19T10:01Z,Just noticed the header here says USA..and it's ntsc...    cool.   Thanks again
,bellows,2011-04-02T12:53Z,I have been looking for this film for a long time.  A totally underrated film with great performance by Roy Scheider.  Some deep brasilian tunes too.  Thanks Arrrrrrrrr.  Plus 1+
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-07-11T05:38Z,"You're welcome and glad to have provided it. :^)

It was only the second torrent I made and I've never had to reseed it due to leeches not contributing as much as they download.
So thank you all for keeping it going."
,dogfood123,2011-09-01T02:11Z,A classic film and music by Tangerine Dream that cannot be beat!  Thank you Arrrrrrrrrr!
,tarquin.machismo,2011-11-05T16:45Z,Thanks for the opportunity to finally see this. 
,yoncenator,2012-02-24T11:48Z,"Thanks, I've been looking for someone to write to and complain about this not being released on DVD in letterbox.  does this have any commentary? would love to get that too.  Friedkin is one of the best directors ever.  I heard him say, Scheider wasn't my first choice for this role, he isn't good as a top banana, he's better at backup.  I love this film.  Friedkin also said, ""this is the only film that came out EXACTLY as I had envisioned it."""
