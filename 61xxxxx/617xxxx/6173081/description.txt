Notes:

 - Remake of "The Wages of Fear" which is in French and black and white ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046268/ ) This isn't very prominently mentioned on the IMDB page.
 
 - This is my second movie torrent. I used DVDFab and AutoGK for better control of the quality, and I think it came out better. Comments are always welcome.
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SEED as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
