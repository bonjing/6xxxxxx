,irontowngeek,2011-02-27T18:13Z,"Oracle Enterprise is actually a good distro.
We have no problems dealing with Oracle themselves.
My only real complaint is the f*cking VirtualIron took.
Since we also use VirtualIron servers,OracleVM is just VI.
Virtualbox VM's,actually perform better on Oracle EL.
As to Jazzmelody9's comment,to each their own.
It's a right to say what you feel.
But I personally think the comment fits very well towards
Microsoft.
How many years has Windoze users taken a f*cking.
Sorry,but big Corps rule the world."
