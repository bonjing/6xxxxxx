I see you started uploading a few days ago.  Welcome!  It looks like these are your own rips which is very cool.  Maybe you could include the .LOG file from whatever program you used to rip?  EAC, dBpoweramp, etc.  I know alot of people like to see that, gives a more ""complete"" picture of the rip.  But whatever man.... do what you want!

Thanks again for all the good (new) music!"

All my more recent rips have been made using EAC or DbPoweramp and they have logfiles as well as scans."
[T],rjordan21,2011-02-15T18:26Z,^^^^ very cool. Keep up the great uploads!
