another beauty from you thethingy.
thanks heaps mate.
uploaded quickly and installed easily. "
,CaptnMorgan,2011-03-08T18:19Z,I was just wondering since Norton picked up something in the exe file which I am guessing is a false positive since all of your torrents have good reviews and you have a green skull. It is probably picking up something because the exe file is cracked? I am still kind of new to all of this.

Good torrent, but like a lot of people I get stuck at the ID screen, so I need to fill in serials but everytime ADOBE says that ''We are unable to start you subscription for Adobe Soundbooth CS5 Subscription Edition.''

u just need copy a dll files, like in this instruction :

3) If after using the app you get licence errors and you know that your hosts file is set then you can copy the dll files from the dll folder and paste and replace your own ones.

thanks 4 u seeds My Friend ;)"

,Isenriver,2011-10-27T13:29Z,I'm having a similar problem to what others have said. I've already got Adobe premiere cs5 installed using thething's torrent and i followed the instructions given but I can't get passed the adobe ID page. Replacing the dll files did nothing for me. Any help would be much appreciated:)
,MM2007,2011-12-30T06:56Z,"@Isenriver and anyone else having problems getting past the Adobe ID screen:

1. Click on ""Create Adobe ID"" button
2. Fill in bogus email address and name
3. Click OK
4. Install will continue
5. When install completes you will get a message that your Adobe ID can't be verified and that you will get a notice when you open the program.
6. Click OK and close out of installer
7. DO NOT OPEN SOUNDBOOTH YET
8. Go to thethingy's DLL folder (included in torrent) and follow instructions for replacing the DLL
9. Overwrite the DLL on your machine with the one in the torrent
10. Open Soundbooth error free

Thanks thethingy!"
,Nick3570,2012-02-10T20:50Z,what do u mean by replacing the dll files and where would i find it? Do you mean just replace the dll file in the soundbooth folder in the program files or replace every dll file because i also torrented photoshop and flash from you (thanks for those. they work great)?
,FerrusOxide,2012-03-10T12:55Z,"Have a problem when trying to start Soundbooth after installation. I get through the Adobe ID part just fine and replace the .dll (looks like there's only one I need to replace; I've checked and not found any others), but when I actually start, I get an application error that reads:

""The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the application.""

Restarting the computer, replacing the original .dll, and uninstalling and reinstalling the program don't help. I'm running 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium. Just want to know if there's something else I can try before I resort to the Clean Install and Error Toolkit.

Downloaded several other torrents from you and all of the rest run just fine; no problems at all. Not sure why this one doesn't."
,FerrusOxide,2012-03-10T13:05Z,"Oh, hey, never mind. I fixed it on my own.

What I tried to do was to replace the .dll file in Program Files (x86)/Adobe/Adobe Soundbooth CS5 with the file contained in the torrent's 64-bit folder. That's what gave me the error.

I had to copy over the .dll from the 32-bit folder instead. Now the program is working just fine.

I AM slightly confused as to why this is, though."
,keep_ya,2012-03-26T02:48Z,"Once again thethingy has come through.
The few problems I had were easily solved with a little perseverance.
When the adobe ID is called for, simply create a bogus ID and password.
Once installed you will be told that the ID could not be verified. Simply close the installer.
Go to the soundbooth folder in the programs (x86 if 64 bit) folder and replace with the dll supplied in the torrent. Replace with the 32 bit, not the 64 bit. When I replaced with the 64 bit, Soundbooth refused to run.
Thanks again thethingy."
