Puran Defrag is a very easy to use defragmentation and optimization application. It provides many features which include revolutionary PIOZR, Automatic Defragmentation, Boot Time Defragmentation, Low Priority Defrag. It also sports Individual File/Folder Defrag, GUI and Console Command Line, Restart/Shutdown after Boot Time Defrag, Native support for 64 Bit Systems and many more. All these features smoothly combine together in order to give your system a significant speed boost.

Features:

   * Boot Time Defragmentation to defrag system files like MFT, Pagefile, Registry, Hibernation File etc.
   * Automatic Defragmentation which means you will never have to worry about fragmented disks
   * Low priority defragmentation which means you can now work on your system while defragmentation is going on.
   * System Optimization, which means it moves frequently used files to the faster disk area, which improves performance.
   * Directory Optimization, which means it moves all directories to the faster disk area, which improves performance.
   * Optimization by Freeing Space, which means it frees some faster disk area for temporary files created while Windows is running.
   * Once defrag is over, it can shutdown or restart your computer.
   * It can defrag individual files by simply right clicking on the file and selecting â€˜Puran Defragâ€™
   * Scheduling of defrag by Windows scheduler is supported
   * Even if a file cannot be defragmented due to low space, it tries to defrag it to atleast some extent.
   * It performs a disk check before starting defragmentation after restart
   * Command Line defrag supported
