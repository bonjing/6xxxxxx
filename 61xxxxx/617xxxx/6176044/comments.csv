,setfire2flames,2011-02-24T22:38Z,"I installed MalwareByte Anti Malware Version: 1.50.1 and did everything I was supposed to. Problem is: when I put the register info in, it suddenly disabled the Protection Module and it has a sign that says ""Protection DISABLED""

When I try to enable it a window pops up that reads:

[CreateService] Failed to perform desired action. Error Code: 1072

What do?"
[T],dada_sh,2011-02-25T10:11Z,"@ /setfire2flames/
uninstall Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, restart your computer, run the utility at the following link http://www.malwareby.../mbam-clean.exe
restart your computer again, and then reinstall Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. 

You may download a fresh copy for the reinstall

You will need to reenter your ID and Key after performing those steps. 
Good Luck... Kindly confirm if problem solved ;-)"
