,daba_1,2011-02-16T14:58Z,"Singer and guitarist Warner Williams was surrounded by music as a child. Born in 1930 in Takoma Park, MD, Williams was playing guitar by the age of six, while his mother played the accordion, his father played guitar, piano, and fiddle, and his seven brothers and three sisters all played stringed instruments and sang, performing in the area as the Williams Family. Williams began playing for house parties, fish fries, and church functions, and in time became a fixture on the Washington, D.C., blues scene. He began playing with blues harpist Jay Summerour in the early '90s, and the duo specialized in the Piedmont blues tradition of Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, billing themselves on the folk and blues circuit as Little Bit of Blues."
,daba_1,2011-02-16T15:45Z,"Jay Summerour was born in Rockville, MD, February 16, 1950. And to say the least, he was knee-deep in blues and R&B as long 

as he could remember. His maternal grandfather, Smack Martin, who lived over in Monkey Run off Route 355 was a local guitar/ 

harmonica wizard of note and would regale customers at all the area roadhouses and juke joints of the late 50s. In fact, it 

was he and Sonny Terry, whom Jay eventually met, that prompted him to take up the blues harp at the tender age of seven. One 

of his earliest recollections was of his mother who would play her recordings around the house of James Brown, Little 

Richard, and Etta James. Though church going (and gospel singing), the mother belonged to a social club, the Wonderettes, who 

would organize concerts in conjunction with softball games. ""Things were different then when I was growing up. It was all 

before this suburbia business. Black people would gather at functions sponsored by my mother's group--fish fries, picnics, 

and home meetings we'd call them. And big time artists of the day--Little Richard, Ray Charles, and KoKo Taylor, people like 

that, would perform under these pavillions,"" said Jay. He recalled some favorite venues--Johnson Park in Emory Grove in 

Gaithersburg, Oak Haven in Boyds (Germantown), MD, and Fisherman's Hall, a sprawling, barn-like structure in Rockville. But 

on other occasions they would travel as far south to Brandywine and Pomonkey and Wilmer's Park."
