PLOT
-------------------------------------------------
If you think you knew what it felt like to be the 
bounty hunter behind the visor, think again. The 
Galactic Federation's network computer, Aurora Unit, 
is suddenly and completely corrupted with something 
like a virus. The Federation believes Space Pirates 
may be behind the problem and are soon attacked. Samus 
and other hunters leap to their defense only to find 
that the enemy they face is Dark Samus, armed with 
immense power that no one can withstand.

First-Person Perfect: Players control Samus by moving 
with the Nunchuk and aiming with the Wii Remote controller, 
allowing for a level of immersion unlike anything they 
have ever experienced. It's a quantum leap in first-person 
control.

Wonderful Weapons: Samus employs well-known power-ups 
like the Grapple Beam and Morph Ball, as well as new surprises, 
to help her survive. Using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk 
controllers, players will be able to grasp and pull things 
by using actual arm movements, as well as execute amazing 
feats like aiming and blasting in midair or at a full run.
Phazon's Powers: The game also incorporates a new system 
involving Phazon. If you fill Samus' Phazon supply to a 
certain level, Samus will temporarily go into hyper mode, 
a state in which she can pull off incredible feats. On the 
flip side, if she exceeds the maximum Phazon level, she'll 
perish. Also, for the first time in the Metroid series, Samus' 
ship will be used in active game play.
