Superb compilation of popular '60s material by one of the biggest names in Middle of the Road. With smooth unified voices, the Johnny Mann Singers have sold millions of records in the USA and almost none of those recordings have been released on CD. A wonderful collection of famous melodic '60s hits, such as 'Up, Up & Away', 'The Girl From Ipanema', 'Call Me', 'Monday Monday', 'Windy' and 'Mrs. Robinson'.
