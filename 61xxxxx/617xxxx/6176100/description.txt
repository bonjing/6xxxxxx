Nights in Black Leather was directed by Richard Abel under the pseudonym Ignatio Rutkowski. Peter stars as himself, a German immigrant walking around San Francisco looking for adventure. With scenes shot in North Beach, Land's End, and all over San Francisco, Nights in Black Leather is both an exciting erotic romp and a time capsule of gay life in San Francisco circa 1972.

The film became an international sensation, playing for months at adult cinemas in the US and Europe. Originally, the film was released as starring "Peter Burian." To avoid a lawsuit with an actor named Peter Burian, the star changed his name to Peter Berlin and the rest is history.

The film's original title was Post Haste Hustle, which was changed by the distributor to Nights in Black Leather.

Until recently, no known intact 16mm negative or print existed. Then someone associated with the release of the original film contacted Peter with news that the original negative was in storage in Southern California. This negative has been used to create a brand new 16mm print.
