Formed in October of 2000, Bayside consisted of four musicians looking for a chance to play music the rest of their lives. They recorded a demo and the band began playing shows around Long Island, NY. They quickly caught the eye of Brooklyn, New Yorkâ€™s Dying Wish Records, who released their first EP, â€œLong Stories Shortâ€, featuring the songs â€œFoot Impressionsâ€, â€œDays Of My Lifeâ€, â€œRed Head VS. The Pretty Red Braceletâ€, â€œDowntimeâ€, â€œAsk For Itâ€, and â€œAdvance Letter Goodbyeâ€
