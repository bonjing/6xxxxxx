We had hoped exposing ASAPs bullshit the other night would have led to more of their "quality" 
releases being nuked for crashing standalones. It hasn't and for this we're disappointed. They
are well aware of the problem and haven't fixed it yet. A simple google search of ASAP xvid 
standalones yields results that every one of their pres has had this problem. Over the last 
few nights alone we've tested a few of them and none of them work without remuxing to remove 
their garbage header data.

Skins.US.S01E05.HDTV.XviD-ASAP
Episodes.S01E06.HDTV.XviD-ASAP
Pretty.Little.Liars.S01E16.HDTV.XviD-ASAP

We provided visual proof last time around and have since heard from people in other groups with other 
standalones, this combined with the google results proves it is a legit issue and one that shouldn't 
be allowed to stand. We hoped to have had the support of other leading TV-XVID groups but untill now 
they've remained quiet. Here's hoping they speak up before it's too late and ASAP has crapped on the XViD 
scene like they have on 720. 


PS: The cleaniness of a room has nothing to do with the fucking ability to encode a AVI that complies 
with standalones. But thanks for the cleaning tips ASAP/Immerse leader. We wouldn't hire you or 
a cleaning service you run to clean though.
