,luffarungen,2011-02-16T16:48Z,does anybody know if this works?
,condem78,2011-02-17T12:43Z,"@ luffarungen,

it does work indeed m8te,
ive got it on two comps and its still going good, as long as you dont update it, which there shouldnt be no need as i downloaded the setup.exe from there site a few days ago,

it also is the full product, 
protects logon and explorer whichever you choose,

i will be honest though because its a keygen and it modifies the program to activated version,
some antivirus scanners will see it as a threat, so id turn it off, if you do download, also
i wont be seding for much longer,

hope that helps your query and anyone else whos got doubts as to wheather this is real,

And yes, it works against all but the most sophisticated keyloggers.  Most skids won't be able to  dodge it.  As far as the security of its encryption, I'm looking into that."

,Endre:,2011-05-18T23:39Z,Can't get the keygen to work! :/
,txguy1968,2011-05-22T00:01Z,I have followed your instructions wholly and the winzip file containing the keygen returns an error each and every time.

sorry about that m8te,
dont really know what to say to that, other than ive had it working and so has a few others, is there any chance you can tell us what the code was,
that is also not our keygen, 
the keygens actually by ZWT let me know and ill try to do an upload for the people who have had some trouble with the keygen,
sorry to those whom could not get it

,altezon,2011-06-07T18:16Z,"The keygen is good -- here's how to work it:

When the setup asks for license information follow these steps:

1. Exit your antivirus program

2. Move the keygen zip archive to the installation folder

3. Unzip the archive, being sure to extract the keygen to the installation folder. Don't use the wizard for this step. Choose 'extract', and then browse to choose the installation folder.

4. Run the keygen.

5. Click finish & reboot."
