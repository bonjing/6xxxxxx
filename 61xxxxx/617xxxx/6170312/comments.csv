thanks..it takes lot of patience bud..ur right 4-5hrs for 1gb only...i just put it to download takes 24hrs or more for 4.37 gb...n put it to encode another 12-28hrs depending on movie length n resolution...seeding also takes time..patience is the key...it was frustrating at first bt i hv got used to it now.."
