Based on the true story of Bill Porter, A man with cerebral palsy is determined to become a salesman.
Movies today are so full of meanness, of violence, of generally nasty people, that this small movie about a man who insisted on earning his own way in life just shines like a beacon. William H. Macy's performance is award caliber. Actually everyone in the film is believable, and most are likeable and all are interesting. Bill Porter is a hero for modern America; this movie is inspiring.
