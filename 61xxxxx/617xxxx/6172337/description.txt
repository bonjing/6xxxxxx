Notes: Pure authentic country blues in the East Coast tradition from guitarists and singers Alex Seward and 'Fat Boy' Hayes, billed as Guitar Slim & Jelly Belly on these recordings made in the 1940s. The two alternate as vocalists and even trade off verses on some selections. Alex Seward (Guitar Slim), a friend and associate of Brownie McGhee's, sings in a polished, urban style while Mr. Hayes contributes the rougher, rural vocals. The CD contains nearly the entire commercially recorded output of the duo.
'Their heyday was the '40s and they were one of the last outposts of the then outdated country blues, although with a very sophisticated city overtone. Their playing meshed beautifully together as did their voices ... an amazing bargain for anyone who loves the gentler sounds of the Carolinas.' 
Here Alex 'Guitar Slim' Seward and Louis Hayes ('Fat Boy' or 'Jelly Belly') are captured in New York City. This traveling pair also recorded as the Backporch Boys, Blues King, and the Bluesboys bringing rural, East Coast blues in the tradition of Blind Boy Fuller, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee to their nostalgic constituents who were displaced to the big Northern cities during and after World War II. Hayes and Seward trade back and forth in conversational exchanges before a song that contains verse exchanges. Both play guitar, the only musical accompaniment here. The vocals are adequately summed up as 'rough' for Hayes, in the sense that they're more country-styled, and 'smooth' for Steward, a protÃ©gÃ© of Lonnie Johnson and Sonny Terry. The two play up their differences as the more sophisticated sounding Guitar Slim berates Jelly Belly for his shiftless ways and fondness for 'ten-cent wine.' It appears the two had some wild adventures with disreputable woman in taking their music to the road. The interesting interplay of the basic acoustic guitar work and the comedic exchanges between the two men who scoff at their hardscrabble past makes for a singular record. Mr. Arhoolie himself, Chris Strachwitz provides notes on the players' individual and combined careers.
