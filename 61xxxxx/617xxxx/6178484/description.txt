The main character of this tragicomedy, Bouzykine, has a gift for attracting people. He is always ready to offer his helping hand and cannot refuse anyone. A kind and gentle person, Bouzykine never thinks about himself, thus getting in all kinds of complicated situations. Making a choice, showing a preference for something or somebody at the expense of others is always a problem for him. This goes for his private life, too. Unwilling to cause pain to his mistress, he unintentionally hurts his wife, unable to make a final decision till the last moment. However, he tries to change the habitual course of events, and almost succeeds.
