BMW DVD is easier to find, but it works just fine in Opel. You will have to record as dual-layer.

(note it's DVD90 compatible and not CD70)"
,zelen0,2011-03-12T22:58Z,"Just forgotten to say that another BMW navigation called ""BMW Navigation DVD Road Map Europe BUSINESS"" doesn't work with Opel. 

Only the one named ""BMW Road Map HIGH"" is compatible."
