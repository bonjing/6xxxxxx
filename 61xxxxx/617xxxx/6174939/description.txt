Itâ€™s difficult to determine exactly what The Bird and the Bee singer Inara Georgeâ€™s motivation was for spending roughly half of Accidental Experimental on re-interpretations of tunes from her previous solo album, An Invitation. Was she unhappy with Van Dyke Parksâ€™ fluid, orchestral-jazz arrangements on the latter? Did she just want to give some alternate possibilities their day in court? Weâ€™ll just have to go with Georgeâ€™s own disclaimer that this is â€œnot a regular albumâ€ and take it at face value. Certainly the tunes that are reprised from An Invitation sound shockingly different when trading in their lush, string-laden settings for quirky art-pop. They also sound very much of a piece with the other tracks here, like â€œCaptured,â€ which mates Georgeâ€™s elongated melodic phrases with gooey analog synth tones and Beach Boys-like backing-vocal counterpoint, and â€œGreedy,â€ where her plaintive croon is accompanied by little more than some muted piano chords and a distant atmospheric keyboard backdrop. And while Accidental Experimental seems unlikely to alienate The Bird and the Bee fans, it definitely represents yet another side of Georgeâ€™s musical personality.
