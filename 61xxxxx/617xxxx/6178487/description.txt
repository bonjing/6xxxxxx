                          CTU rls got 2 keyframes within 
                         20 frames, according to the    
                          tvx2642k8 rules this is NOT    
                            allowed. "-Min GOP Size

                             20 and at most 30". CTU's        
                              broken keyframes are caused by   
                              segmenting.
