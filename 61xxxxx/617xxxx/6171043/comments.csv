What are you thinking?  1 file 11.46 Gb."
,AVALAXIAN,2011-02-13T07:46Z,No I compressed all the files into a zip so it would download faster.. there are lots of files actually.
,1069,2011-02-13T13:51Z,"Individual folders would have been probably better as not all would be of use to most people.
 That way you only get what is needed"
,dave1sfx,2011-02-21T18:22Z,"You know a RAR file is smaller than a ZIP file, so you should use WinRAR to compress."
,LeMoNsZ,2011-02-23T22:30Z,Is this the ENGLISH version ? What do you mean by V2.0 ? I have previously downloaded the 'White Rabbit' version. Hope this is the latest version without the 'White Rabbit' and also the working one.
,WinSrv,2011-02-24T20:35Z,What part of the cs5 master collection software do I have to alter to allow me to make copies and use the same product on multiple computers.  ex: I obtain cs5 master collection and I want to run Illustrator or photoshop or fireworks all at the same time on windows 7. But on multiple computers and in different locations. How is this possible ?? 
,dave1sfx,2011-02-27T18:12Z,"Unless the uploader starts seeding again, this torrent is officially dead."
,AVALAXIAN,2011-02-28T01:44Z,"OK I'll give you guys some info... 
My friends and I had a older version of CS5 but we noticed every once and a while (Like every month) Adobe manages to some how de-activate the fake serial. SO we found out a way to keep it running, with the adobe updater still working. we put (2.0) because Pirate bay would not let us reload the torrent and my friend was being a idiot. 

This has all the software and is working completely fine. Note: Everything here works perfectly fine and has been tested.

If you have problems activating it download the Universal Keygen instead.

You can install this on multiple computers. Just copy the install disks.

NOTE: My computer shuts down every once and a while. So the torrent may go to 0 seeds from time to time. Please bear with me. "
,DocOmega,2011-03-06T04:20Z,Please Seed...  :)
,garynyc,2011-03-11T16:17Z,"Avalax can you please help kickstart this great upload again? Most people are stuck at around 89% of the files. Since nobody is sharing the complete torrent, we are kind of dead in the water. Can you help us? Thanks!"
,DrugLord1985,2011-03-28T11:23Z,seed please
,garynyc,2011-04-01T02:26Z,"Avalax can you please seed this App? NOBODY HAS THE COMPLETE APP, at least no one willing to share. We need you to seed for a couple of days....HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH STATES HANG IN THE BALANCE!"
,123jaera,2011-04-20T18:32Z,"This V2.0, isn't about the CS5.5, right?"
,SuperGOY3000,2011-04-27T13:02Z,Let's pray that Avalax continues the seeding=) use the power of thoughts)
,Auron666,2011-05-10T03:44Z,PLEASE SEED IM STUCK AT 89.5% PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SEED
,lino4000,2011-06-06T04:04Z,This continues with 89.5% available for download. Use this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5557534/Adobe_CS5_Master_Collection_%5BCRACK%5D
