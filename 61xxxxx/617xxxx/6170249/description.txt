Blurb:
A film about the most influential man in British comedy. For fifty years, Nazis and Nazism have been a mainstay of British comedy, providing material for everyone from Monty Python and Spike Milligan to Freddie Starr and even Prince Harry. This documentary looks at the comedic portrayals of Nazis in general and Adolf Hitler in particular.
