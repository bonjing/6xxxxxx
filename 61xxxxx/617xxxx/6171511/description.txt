Features:

Yeah, now that doesnâ€™t make any sense â€“ but thatâ€™s why Desktop Poet is so much fun! Just like those little magnetic tiles for the front of your â€˜fridge that have been around since the 90â€²s, Desktop Poet turns your desktop into a â€œvirtual fridgeâ€ area so that you can be as creative â€“ and silly â€“ as you want!

* Let your mind and imagination run wild!

Whether, poet, novelist, playwright, educator, student or a person with a little time on your hands, Desktop Poet puts hundreds of words right at your fingertips. Move them around to create your poems, prose or to brainstorm. The tiles become a visual embodiment of the English language, freeing you to let your mind travel through uncharted territory.

* Finally, a great fun product for your kids.

This is no â€œshoot-em upâ€ game. Desktop Poet assists younger kids grasp simple word structure in a fun way. Other kids can showcase their creative flair. Whether in the classroom or at home, kids can play with words and in the process â€“ learn.

* But, seriouslyâ€¦

You can increase the available vocabulary and decrease the number of tiles. A single tile can have multiple word variations. Highlight the word, click escape and, for example, picture becomes: pictures, picturing, pictured. Need more? Create your own word tile. Set backgrounds, colors and more, making Desktop Poet a creative wonderworld.
