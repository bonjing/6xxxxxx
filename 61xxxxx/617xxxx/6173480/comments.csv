This one does exactly what it is titled and you don't even have to reboot. Worked on XP SP2.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,hyeguy123,2011-07-22T23:58Z,"It works where others failed!

Great work!

P.S. I had the windows script error that said I was ""probably"" using an invalid key, so I was relieved when this worked!"
,hyeguy123,2011-07-23T00:02Z,"Also, just an additional note, it passed the genuine windows check! The validation tool gave me the random string of numbers/letters, and the download went through!

Thanks again!"
,Zeptinune,2011-08-20T22:47Z,"Well I had the annoying popup and the blank screen and I ran the .bat and it all went away..

I THINK.. it's fixed. Last one that did that after a reboot it just came back."
