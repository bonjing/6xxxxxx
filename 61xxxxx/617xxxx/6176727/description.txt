GAMEPLAY
Alien Breed Impact is a top-down isometric shooter set onboard futuristic space craft.

Standing in his way are several different types of aliens who will attack him, usually en masse. He can also suffer damage from explosions, fires, electrical disturbances and enemy turrets. Conrad can run and shoot in all directions, and can collect a number of different guns, grenades, gun turrets and health packs.

STORY
Theodore J. Conrad is an engineer on the spaceship Leopold when it drops out of hyperspace and has a collision with a mysterious ghost ship. Alien creatures cross over from the ship and overwhelm the Leopold, devastating the crew. Conrad must take up arms against these invaders and fight to save his life and the ship. He is assisted by the android Mia, who provides advice and navigation, helping Conrad find the keys, consoles and power supplies he needs to escape each level and ultimately discover a way to save the Leopold.

At the end of the fourth level, Conrad must cross over from the Leopold to the Ghost Ship. While there, he encounters the Moss creature, the final boss.

In the Co-Op Assault multiplayer levels, two men, Barnes and Vance, are trying to locate Conrad by storming through sections of the Leopold. When each section is complete, the characters take an elevator to the next level, detonating the previous stage and moving on to the next.
