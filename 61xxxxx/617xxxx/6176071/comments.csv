,leetwanker,2011-05-08T22:23Z,Anyone else have issue with all the audio commentary over the sketches? Makes them basically worthless for actually watching the show unless it can be turned off. 
,Shadowchaos,2011-06-01T09:32Z,Actually I couldn't get the commentary to work...
,stickdick,2011-07-27T04:10Z,Thanks guys. I'm gettin 1.7 MB/s download speed. I'll be sure to seed about ten times. :)
