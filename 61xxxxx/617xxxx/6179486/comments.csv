,audessy,2011-03-23T17:52Z,You did a great job on these rips except for one thing. You cut out the music on every game. I would've rather downloaded a larger torrent that were identical to the original game.
,ilovepuss,2011-05-18T02:03Z,nice
,Devourler,2011-09-10T16:08Z,Good if you just leave out tm 1+2 cause that's not necessary. also tm 3
,Jinx_Dojo,2012-03-13T04:11Z,"Is the music actually cut out or did ""audessy"" just forget to enable sound?

From the filesize, my guess would be the latter, but it's hard to tell.

Also: are these NTSC or PAL? Thank you."

,Suihtil,2012-05-13T14:29Z,"As someone else stated, this torrent DOES have every one of the Playstation 1 Twisted Metal titles...  But unfortunately, the games' digital audio soundtrack -- a HUGE part of the gameplay experience, in my opinion -- is missing from every game that uses Redbook audio. (Which is apparently every game.)  That's extremely disappointing..."
