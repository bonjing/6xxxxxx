,ogchris,2011-02-17T06:44Z,Thanks KAT.  I don't know how you rip such HQ to size ratio.  Your skull is long overdue imo.
,zkt,2011-02-20T17:02Z,"Seriously... How do you get such high quality in to such small file sizes??

V=10
A=10
(based on the claim that this is a 720p BRRip).

I've seen other BRRips of this movie, and this is by far the best quality and one of the smallest files sizes to download. Played great streaming over WIFI to my Samsung BR Player! Fantastic job KickAssTorrents!

BTW, not a bad movie either. A bit anticlimactic; however, I like the subtle spin at the end."
