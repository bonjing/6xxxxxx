JIMMY PAGE and THE BLACK CROWES LIVE AT THE GREEK
Audio CD 10 July 2000 
Label: Steamhammer
Format:Mp3@320



Recorded in October 1999, this double-disc slab will certainly stick to your ribs, chock-full as it is of burly, brawny riffs and it is as flavourful as it is filling. Without question, the pairing of Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes sounds as strong on your player as it does on paper. Page's playing is more focused and incisive than it has been of late, the Crowes sound energized and inspired by the esteemed guest and Chris Robinson makes a fine Robert Plant. The Led Zeppelin covers, which account for 14 of the 20 tracks on Live At The Greek, stay close to the original arrangements--you can sing along most of the way based on your knowledge of the Zep studio albums. At first, this may seem disappointing, but it becomes clear very quickly that this method is preferable to any heavy-handed reworkings. And they smartly include a few lesser-known tracks as well ("Sick Again" and "Ten Years Gone" from Physical Graffiti and "Out On The Tiles" from III). The real payoff, however, comes with the half-dozen blues covers, which sound looser and more alive than the Zep tunes. This set isn't innovative, surprising or adventurous, but that's precisely where its charms lie.
