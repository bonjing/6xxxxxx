This is a show about the creatures that could roam the Earth millions of years from now and the time traveling teenagers on the road trip of their lives. Using their TimeFlyer (just your typical wormhole-surfing vehicle their friend from the future borrowed from her parents), our crew can ricochet back and forth from era to era on a kind of time safari, discovering and documenting all of the mind-boggling wildlife they encounter.
