,usghkh,2011-02-16T19:26Z,"ever since you started torrents in packs, it became difficult to find only specific episodes/seasons
kindly make separate torrents or full season torrents"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-16T19:45Z,"@usghkh: Yeah, letters are small and Latin. It's really hard."
,justregged,2011-02-16T20:06Z,Thanks for V
,justregged,2011-02-16T20:08Z,If your having trouble finding stuff just bookmark his page
,hkoraddi,2011-02-16T20:20Z,hi20 40-lot of ppl find it difficult to find specific season(not for me).u continue pack but better tag the names pf season name in it.(if hit and run increases den u can leave it).... 
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-16T21:03Z,"@hkoraddi: I tried to understand, but failed pretty badly. I don't get it - every episode has, as the part of the name - a corresponding season tag (number) as any other episodes from uploads of others.
All torrents of full seasons are properly named. 
Give me an example or explain, on best English you can - or shut, please, up."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-16T21:07Z,"@hkoraddi: ... about that subject, I meant. Not on bad way, I simply do not want you to encourage morons."
,gtd005,2011-02-16T21:26Z,Thanks for the shows
,Djalma,2011-02-16T22:38Z,Thanks for NCIS and V.
,believenu,2011-02-17T00:25Z,"duuh... well englsh not good shows called funny names reeddin knot good but can compliane better than getting glass'es..
Thank you. seeding is sharing. question re seeders vs leachers.. showing 2 vs 51 how accurate is that/ do we all qualify as leechers until we upload from the torrent I know you have mentioned this before but if you have time maybe an explaination would assist those slow to seed."
,cindal,2011-02-17T01:35Z,thank you 20/40
,Ataractic,2011-02-17T04:57Z,"2040: believenu's comments pinned another question in my head- if I download only a few episodes from the pack, will I be considered a seeder after I finish downloading? Just curious."
,funpigj,2011-02-17T04:59Z,"Thx for V and N.O.F.

I think what hkoraddi and usghkh are trying to say is that it is that they can't search PB and find the shows inside your packs.

Not an issue for those of us that check in with you every day..."
,verazationable,2011-02-17T07:57Z,Thanks for mad love and the good wife.
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-17T08:27Z,"@funpigj: Yeah, I was able to ""parse"" that - but how does a TPB inability has anything with my torrents. Only btjunkie site can search within the torrents.

@believenu: TPB get the numbers from trackers. None of the trackers works reliably from 2007. I explained that subject at least dozen times in last two months.

@Ataractic: Yes. With some limits and caveats explained yesterday."
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-17T12:03Z,"On Search subject:

Read. I wrote on this page, in torrent Description ""(for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser)"".

Do it. If you decide not to - it looks like one have ""different"" type of problem, and I can do nothing about.

Clicking afterward on torrent is not so hard. It takes less of time than writing complaints (or ""have you uploaded this or that...where is it""), right? Reading - is - unfortunately necessary. In any of the cases. 

If you don't wanna read - it's probably stupidity, plain and simple. And I don't want do anything about.

Use Google. Writing down in Google Search ""TV.Shows.Pack"" and get lined up all my TV uploads shouldn't be so ""hard"" either.

Be nice, be smart, be innovative - and - DO NOT WASTE MY TIME, PLEASE. I cannot deal with personal ""problems"" of yours."
