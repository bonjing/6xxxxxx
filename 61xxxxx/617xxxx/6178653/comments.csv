[T],kriss_kringle,2011-03-08T02:31Z,It has some redone special effects so I think it's the new Lucas cut.

,megahurts_gr,2011-10-12T22:43Z,"To me it appears as if the picture has been severely cropped. In the same way as, for example, the head in the blu-ray cover.
Does anyone know whether the movie was actually released like this?  Or is it due to some flaw in the ripping process? Or is perhaps the problem with my player?"
,megahurts_gr,2011-10-13T00:07Z,"Sorry, it was my mistake. I corrected it."
