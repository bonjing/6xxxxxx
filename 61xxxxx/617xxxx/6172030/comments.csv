,Lovejam,2011-02-16T16:30Z,"Love your choice in movies.
The picture quality is very good - this is very high resolution for this size file.
The audio also sounds great.
Thank you."
,Xlemonad,2011-03-06T23:07Z,"Terrible quality, pixelated and jerky picture. What's the point in making 720p rips with such a low bitrate? High resolution alone doesn't make for a good viewing experience. I'd rather choose an 700 meg Xvid/.avi rip over this any day. I don't get you people...  If this is what you watch on your spankin new HDTV just sell the fucker and watch the movies on your laptop or project them on a cave wall or something. I'll never get people and how they act..."
