Your Face is a Saxophone is an animated comedy series about the advertising industry, and the people who work in it because they couldn't find a job in what they actually went to art school for. Also, everyone has inanimate objects instead of heads for some reason.

We made a pilot episode with no budget in order to raise money for a whole season. Instead of pitching it to a TV network, we're pitching it to you. Yes, YOU.
