,gearlockT,2011-03-02T07:40Z,Is there a single working cracked antivirus on this damn website!! 
,boxit,2011-03-15T12:13Z,"I didn't bother to try using the serial finder bundled with this torrent, so can't comment on that. Instead, I used box mara-fix 1.3 and it works lovely.

Been using NOD32 for years and it's the best AV out there. The only non-free AV I recommend.

Thanks for the upload."
,bytehog,2011-03-17T11:38Z,Thanks.  The x64 versions worked fine on win7x64.  Didn't mess with the activator or the x86 version.

,snarler45,2011-06-14T17:35Z,"Thanks for this you have just saved me.

Hey gearlockT if you want to use NOD32 just google for Nodlogin10.5 it is great.  Make sure you drop your trousers before you install it because it will excite you judging by how disappointed you sound at the momen :)
Cheer up this shit is free and it does not get better than that :))"
