The cast from Ice Road truckers minus a few of the more annoying drive the worlds most dangerous roads. This series actually makes me miss trucking. The dangerous parts were actually the most fun parts. Unlike Ice road truckers in which the drivers in reality worked short (comparative to the average hard driving trucker) hours in situations that were made to look much more dangerous than they are. In this series you get the real thing with some very professional drivers. Note in the original show only Lisa and 2 other drivers were what any serious trucker would consider professional, and Hugh the least.

The drivers take on roads that crumble as they drive. In trucks that wouldn't be allowed on the roads in the US or Western Europe. If you liked ice road truckers but want to see the real thing with actual professional drivers this is it.

Personal Note: Love it, worth watching i thought, had me on the edge of my seat around a few of them turns. Now you can take it on the go with you on your portable MP4 player. Converted just for that purpose. Don't watch while your driving tho... Seriously that ledge and the traffic over there is nuts....I had people that didn't like the original Ice Road Truckers liking this one.
