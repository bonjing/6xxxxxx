Ive been binging on Sabbath for days now..... I have a ton.  Castle remasters, Sanctuary, Black Box remasters, Warner Brothers, Vertigo.... The Black Box remasters always sound the best to me except the Castle Remaster of Black Sabbath.

With so much Sabbath uploaded everywhere I never planned on sharing so .LOG files, etc. are long gone after I archive.  Cover art is included for every album though.

I know zeppfan1968s Discography is here:

My intention is not to dilude the seedbank but it looks like some of those albums are transcoded from MP3. Plus, Ive included every note with Ozzy and Ronnie.

Please help seed as I will be without a computer on 2/19 for about a month.

ROCK ON PEOPLE!
