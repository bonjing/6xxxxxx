Just asking before I go and download."
,Lovejam,2011-02-17T05:08Z,"Aren't the remastered albums supposed to be double CD's with alternate versions of the songs?
This torrent doesn't have the second CD's."

There's nothing to indicate that zeppfan1968s upload are remastered albums.  There are comments that some of the albums are transcoded from MP3 and not FLAC as I've mentioned in my description above.  There are questions about his other uploads and he hasn't uploaded anything in over 2 years so I'm not sure he's around to answer any questions. In addition, I've included every Studio album to feature Ronnie James Dio and every Live album to feature both Ozzy and Ronnie as I've mentioned in my description................ 

@Lovejam

You're mistaken. The Black Box remasters and Castle remasters did not have any alternative takes or second cd's of additional material."
,LP___Man,2011-02-17T14:25Z,Thanks for the reply. I think I'll grab these and re-burn to CD.
[T],rjordan21,2011-02-17T16:09Z,"^^^^ No problem.  My pleasure, enjoy."
,tonyromano777,2011-03-06T01:16Z,Thanks very much mate :-)
[T],rjordan21,2011-03-07T04:59Z,"^^^ No problem.  The music is important enough to me that I wanted to put it all (the Ozzy & Dio years anyway) in one place for anyone to enjoy.

Rock on....."
