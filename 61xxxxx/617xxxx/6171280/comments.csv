,rempuia,2011-07-28T22:49Z,"This is not ""Richard Hammond's Invisible Worlds"".

The Narrator for this release is ""Martin Ball""

I haven't watched Richard's version, but I can guess it'll be a lot simpler than this version, whose storytelling is marvelous, but can be a bit boring at times. Call it too nerdy, if you like."
