A high-intensity first person shooter set in and around the chaotic battle grounds of Berlin during the final days of WWII, where there was a dramatic race between U.S. and Russian forces to capture German prototypes, research and top scientists. The spoils of this race altered the direction of the Cold War and the world at large for decades to come.

Players are cast as Stephen Moore, a young officer in the OSS, the precursor to the CIA. Moore's mission is to race into Berlin and beat Stalin's armies to the highly-advanced German "Vengeance Weapons" research. Players scrounge for weapons, hide from patrols, and fight against both the Russian and German armies in 10 exciting single-player levels in a variety of environments. Single player levels include document retrieval and delivery, close contact skirmishes and stealth missions. LAN play features VIP Escort, Deathmatch and single or Team King of the Hill modes.
