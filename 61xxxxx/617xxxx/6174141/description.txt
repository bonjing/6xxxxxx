It seems like people couldn't get into A New Day at Midnight. A shame, because there's something refreshingly simple and sincere about this one - keep in mind that Gray had to live up to his own sleeper hit White Ladder from '99. His statement with this follow-up seems to be that he's not taking the great expectations too seriously (that came later with Life in Slow Motion). A New Day... suffers from minor technicalities. First of all, it's overly long at 50 minutes. A track or two less would've made it seem more homogenic.
