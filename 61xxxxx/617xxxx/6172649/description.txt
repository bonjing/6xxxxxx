              San Francisco heiress Page Forrester is         
               brutally murdered in her remote beach           
               house. Her husband Jack is devastated by        
               the crime but soon finds himself accused       
                 of her murder. He hires lawyer Teddy            
                 Barnes to defend him, despite the fact she      
                hasn't handled a criminal case for many         
                years. There's a certain chemistry between       
               them and Teddy soon finds herself                
               defending the man she loves.
