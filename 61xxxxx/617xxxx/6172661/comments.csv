[V],globeplus,2011-02-14T00:54Z,"I needed inofensively under the big size of the file make an adjustment on the videos , all the necessary to the gameplay are available but the not really necessary ones was removed and the gameplay still ok (this was tested) but in case of any real problem that i donÂ´t believe that happen i am here anyway to help , the impression after finish the file is that everything it will be ok like it is .

Thank you for understanding with all the respect for the work from this uploader .

enjoy ."
,lucid657,2011-02-14T02:01Z,"What did you use to edit the .usm video files, im trying to edit something. Thnx!"
[V],globeplus,2011-02-14T02:57Z,"To lucid657 : you donÂ´t really need them , most of them are futil videos and only a few have some story , you need an appropriate codec that it is expensive or filling a registering trial to get him , what you can do is a work around with them but you canÂ´t unpack just like that and the cry engine have some features but not clearly the pak files creation , i tested without them and you can do it for yourself and check the difference and see what i mean , they really donÂ´t influenciate on the gameplay beside you can watch one or another video that have a few story but this for more than a giga for shore it is too much for a pratical file , i donÂ´t think you get problems on the gameplay without them but if it happen i am here to check what to do .

Cheers . "
[V],globeplus,2011-02-14T02:59Z,"To lucid657 : i made a small confusion on the before comment , what i mean it was that you can´t pack them back to pak files without the pak builder that crytek uses , you can unpack but not easy finding a tool to pack them back ."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-14T04:01Z,"GREAT NEWS : 

I THINK I FIND OUT A WAY TO PACK THEM BACK  , SO IF IT IS THE CASE OF REAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THIS WAY OF WORK I THINK I CAN MANAGE NOW A RESCUE OR FIX FILE OR SOMETHING , SO ONE MORE MOTIVE TO BE OK GET THIS FILE .

It is tough sometimes to do the pratical files because you can always depend a bit on the type of files that can be worked and you want the size but not damaging the gameplay , so sometimes you need to take decisions under the circunstances of the files of he game but i really want that the users think that my analysis it is always thinking in get the best possible gameplay for less size , that is what pratical files are about ... see all of you and accept my excuses for this conduct on this one but it looks like the correct work , if not i am here to help better as possible . "
[V],globeplus,2011-02-14T04:14Z,"CONFIRMED !!!

 i can really manage a way around in case of really beeing necessary , so everything safe with this file .


happy gaming ."

[V],globeplus,2011-02-15T00:46Z,"To P2P4L1f3 : i understand what you mean , few hours ago was better and during many hours not bad as that speed but sometimes he starts oscilate a little bit and decrease for a while but can turn back to normality anytime anyway it is tough to explain but it is like that , what it is important to say that it is not me restringing anything but the speed itself can oscilate a bit sometimes but can improve too anytime , like i said it is a kind of complicate to talk about it .

[V],globeplus,2011-02-15T01:33Z,"To everyone : i want without censuring in anyway any type of comment about this subject say the next thing : my wish is always since the first second that i start the upload that the users get the file soon as possible , maybe sometimes the internet connection can oscilate a little bit but the idea is the downloaders start using the files soon ... for me after the upload moment it is like everyone already can use the file in more or less amount of time ."
,vincentdesrd,2011-02-15T05:08Z,"Just finished downloading. Some people mentioned a bin64 folder in the other complete versions.

Did you remove it??? If you did then this is the dumbest thing EVER!!!!!"
,royhere,2011-02-15T05:23Z,"To,
Everyone,,,

Up loader uploads torrent. start seeding...

after adding every new lecher the downloading speed goes down...

after completing more that one seed it will increase...

you can see it in your utorent .

in the peers windows you can see that when there is only single seeder every lechers get data directly from him.

utorrent use a request download way...

every lecher request directly to seeder and when he is connected , another person download speed goes down,.

globe torrent speed comes high when only 10 lechers but globe is very popular up loader so, lechers connected very fast... and Now globe torrent software give data to them also...

so speed goes down...

after few hours...

now speed comes maximum....  "

[V],globeplus,2011-02-15T18:41Z,"To vincentdesrd : only now i read your commebt about the bin64 folder , i have news for you : on this beta version the bin64 sucks , why ? because pause too long the running of the game and when you run it it is like you get ununexpected difficulties , so for safe and for the size because you certainly donÂ´t need 2 folders with 900 mb close to run a game , only the 32bit in an appropriate way was the right thing to do and i remeber the intention is to get a pratical file for complete isos are always another files around .

The game runs fine but is missing a lot of textures. All I can see is the water (at the first level), the smoke, sparks, fire and rain. Other textures were missing and I also see some circles, walls and the ground with ""Release Me"" written on it. I updated everything (drivers, graphics card, direct x) but still it's the same. Also, the high spec tweak pack didn't helped either. I tried all the levels but it's still the same. Tried restarting my computer, reinstalled (unpack) the game also didn't helped me playing this beta. I appreciated your work but can you please help me? I'd buy the game when it comes out but I want to see it first before I'll buy the game. I know this is just a beta and isn't in a stable state of game experience. I also expected that there will be bugs, glitches etc. but is there a way to work around with it? I'll will appreciate your help and thanks in advance.
