,MaBlackness,2011-04-23T14:43Z,quality a/v great
,SamZee,2011-04-29T07:11Z,"Seems like every Smallville DVD rip has this same problem. The audio is pitch shifted one semitone up which bothers me to no end. As a result, the episodes run a bit faster. They're about 2.5 minutes shorter."
[T],ajaxen94,2011-04-29T09:46Z,well SamZee as i told you on btjunkie go buy the box set 
,SamZee,2011-05-09T07:21Z,Probably will once the 10-season set comes out.
[T],ajaxen94,2011-05-09T17:35Z,hey SamZee what country do you reside in i have to admit i download the series from the usa and have noticed that the episodes are usually longer than when they are shown here in the uk but that doesn't bother me as it probably doesn't bother other people or they wouldn't download them
,SamZee,2011-05-13T05:42Z,The U.S.  I'm not quite sure I understand -- are you saying that when they air on TV they're shorter than these torrents? But that wouldn't make sense.
[T],ajaxen94,2011-05-13T17:04Z,"@SamZee i Have noticed quite a few series that i download from the U.S seem to be a minute or more longer than our U.K screening not just Smallville, Hawaii 5-0 is another instance i've checked minute for minute of the story but its all there just about 2 mins shorter than the U.S version but the sound dosen't seem speeded up to us"
,SamZee,2011-05-17T03:31Z,Hm. Well that's odd.
[T],ajaxen94,2011-05-17T10:15Z,@SamZee not sure think it's something to do with the frame rate the US is 24 and the UK is 25 i think
