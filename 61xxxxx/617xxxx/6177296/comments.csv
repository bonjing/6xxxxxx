I prefer Mauve personally, but what are you goin' to do?

Many thanks for the entire season, the four a weekend on the Beeb was bummer.

Curious tho, why the differing file sizes?"
,nigeria70,2011-02-21T19:13Z,"Different sources - first six from the Beeb, remainder from Aussies."
,dread.pirate.roberts,2011-02-24T05:00Z,"One four meg piece missing, in Episode 18, for more than a couple days.

What up with that?"
,pavlforg,2011-02-24T22:49Z,"yeah, i've been waiting - along with a load of others - for days for those four megabites!"
,nigeria70,2011-02-25T00:41Z,Not sure what the problem is.  Looks fine on this end.  Any suggestions?
,jingleflapper,2011-02-25T01:14Z,Thanks very much for the upload. Episode 18 has a problem with the missing 4mb. Maybe just upload that individual episode again separately?
,pavlforg,2011-02-25T18:31Z,"yes, maybe uploading the episode would help? But anyway, thanks very much for all of it! It's great. "
,jingleflapper,2011-02-26T04:58Z,"Even with missing 4mb, episode 18 working with VLC player."
,aajkd,2011-02-26T14:32Z,"Thx for the upload! It does however seem something wrong happened when you created the torrent, same for season 2. Noone will ever be able to finish the download with those torrents.. hashfail..

The best solution is probably to recreate the torrents in another program like utorrent, post it, and let people continue their downloads with those. Remember to post a link or notice in the chat.
Alternatively create single episode torrents for the broken episodes in season 1 and 2. Remember to use another torrent client.

Thx again for the upload : )"
[T],tzanev,2011-03-05T17:59Z,Only 1 seeder? Come on people! Judging by the comments at least a 4-5 got the full torrent.
,aajkd,2011-03-08T15:06Z,Read the comments... It can't be completed
,nigeria70,2011-03-08T19:53Z,I posted a separate torrent of Episode 18.
,aajkd,2011-03-08T23:00Z,Great! Thx : )

,cindy25,2011-03-28T04:07Z,"the first 6 eps worked great, but the larger size eps will not work on a stand alone dvd player"
,orisj,2011-04-08T19:21Z,"I'm stuck @ 99.9% for 2 days now.
Anyone with 100% willing to go online for a minute?"
,orisj,2011-04-08T19:49Z,thanx Nigeria70!
,Trench000,2011-04-09T23:25Z,"No one has 100%, 4MB of content in S01E18 appears to simply be failing the hash check.  Presumably a new torrent with correct hashes would have to be created.

Instead just download S01E18 separately and don't worry about the 99.9% on the full season download.
