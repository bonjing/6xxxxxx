,puppyup,2011-02-17T08:29Z,"Thanks for the effort. However, it doesn't make any sense to squeeze 720p into 400MB. You'd achieve a much better quality by reducing the resolution to 480p at most."
,hkoraddi,2011-02-17T08:30Z,thank you so much for this. i think this is ur 1st 720p so small
,ahmedv,2011-02-17T09:21Z,Thank you - this is an awesome movie - one of my all time fav's
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-17T09:29Z,"@puppyup; It does make sense - looks better and is 150 MB SMALLER than my ""normal"" 480p. It's normal length movie.

I can do pretty much what I think what serves purpose best. Downloaders have free will and ability to choose.

And - in past two days I did over 50 partial encodes of Megamind BluRay in all possible iterations and I upped what is the - best. You don't think that I would up ugly encode, don't you?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-17T09:37Z,"@tylr: Please, DO NOT cross-link my torrents to torrent of someone else as you just did on Riddlera's thread too - we both don't need that. It's called ""advertising and promoting torrents of other uploaders"", it is heavily abused and therefore - against site rules. "
,r-0987,2011-02-17T09:47Z,Thanks! And the size is perfect!
,r-0987,2011-02-17T10:10Z,Thanks...
,noxiebhoy,2011-02-17T11:55Z,"hi 20-40,

thanks.
do you have encode of Godfather 1,2,3???"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-17T12:52Z,"@noxiebhoy: Three, four years back I encoded Trilogy as XviD, and maybe year later lost encodes. I don't have BluRays and I am not in position to encode ~11 hours in three movies again (week for encoding and 6 days for upping). Sorry."
,Ataractic,2011-02-17T13:51Z,Thanks a lot for this!
