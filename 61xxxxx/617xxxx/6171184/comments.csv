,handcuffedkitty,2011-08-20T15:20Z,DJ X Factor should be shot in the face for ruining all the good songs. Subliminal messages suck and they don't work. All it did was cause me to delete half the songs in this torrent. If that's what you were going for YAY you! Goal accomplished.

,Spiff_e,2011-12-13T17:21Z,I haven't logged into TPB for years - but I dug up my password to agree 100% with Handcuffedkitty.  Any ass-clown that tags their uploads should be banned from TPB - then shot in the face...  don't download this torrent - unless you like hearing some douche plug themselves in the middle of the songs.
