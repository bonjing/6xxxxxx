NewsRadio is an American television situation comedy that aired on NBC from 1995 to 1999. The series was filmed in front of a studio audience at CBS Studio Center and Sunset Gower Studios.

The series is set at WNYX, a fictional AM news radio station in New York City populated by an eccentric station owner and staff. The show begins with the arrival of a new news director, level-headed Dave Nelson (Dave Foley). While Dave turns out to be less naive than his youthful appearance suggests, he never fully gains control of his co-workers.

The fast-paced scripts and ensemble cast combined physical humor and sight gags with smart dialogue and absurd storylines. Plots often involved satirical takes on historical events, news stories and pop culture references appealing to a sophisticated, college-educated target audience. The third- and fourth-season finales took the absurdity to the extreme, setting the characters first in a news radio station in outer space, and then as crew members aboard the Titanic.
