Steven Seagal might be best known for an action-movie career spanning three decades but, as Justin discovers in this documentary, the Michigan-born actor has many more strings to his bow. As well as starring in, directing and producing his own films, Seagal is an accomplished blues musician, environmentalist, and a committed Buddhist, animal rights activist and philanthropist.

Justin starts out with a trip to Vancouver, Canada, to visit Steven on the set of his new cop drama series. As well as getting a chance to observe the great man in action, Justin has his heart set on getting a part in the show. Next, the pair head off to Stevenâ€™s base in Phoenix, Arizona, where Justin gets to see how the icon really lives behind closed doors.

In Arizona, Justin is granted exclusive and unprecedented access to Steven and his home life. He gets to experience both the glamour of the superstar lifestyle and the day-to-day experience of being an off-duty megastar away from the prying lens of the paparazzi.
