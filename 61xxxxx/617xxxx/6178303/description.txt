If Chris Isaak comes at the Roy Orbison-Ricky Nelson tradition of three-minute country-pop operettas from the pop side, the Mavericks' Raul Malo approaches it from the country perspective. Malo's dreamy, creamy tenor is every bit as intoxicating as Isaak's, and his emotional range is much broader. On this, the Mavericks' fourth album, Malo and his three bandmates demonstrate their complete mastery of this territory with its heavily echoed vocals, its low-pitched guitar figures, its chunky backbeat, and its claustrophobic sense of romance that is almost right but not quite. Bassist Robert Reynolds's wife Trisha Yearwood sings a duet with Malo on Nancy Sinatra's "Something Stupid", but the album's highlights are the four songs Malo co-wrote with former NRBQ guitarist Al Anderson, including a Tex-Mex rave-up juiced by accordion legend Flaco Jimenez.
