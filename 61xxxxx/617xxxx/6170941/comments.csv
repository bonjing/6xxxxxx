There should be a second seeder by now. Whoever you are, please seed. I have a slow connection, and people are suffering from very low speeds without you!"

,Novariko,2011-05-16T08:20Z,Could someone please seed this? Thank-you :)
,NeverEnoughSeeders,2011-07-09T20:10Z,Hey not to be rude a1s but can you seed?
,a1s,2011-10-09T04:04Z,"Can't, sorry. I've deleted the files. That lone leecher, whoever you are, give it up, it's over."
