				  NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nicholas James Vujicic (born 4 December 1982) is a preacher and motivational 
speaker who was born without arms or legs due to a rare disorder known as 
Tetra-amelia. He struggled throughout his childhood to come to terms with his 
disability, and at seventeen started his own non-profit organization, Life 
Without Limbs. After graduating from university, Vujicic began his travels as 
a motivational speaker. At present, he regularly gives speeches on subjects 
such as disability, hope, and finding meaning in life.
