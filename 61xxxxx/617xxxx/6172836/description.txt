Pinguy OS an out-of-the-box working operating system for everyone, not just geeks.

Antoni Norman has announced the release of Pinguy OS 10.04.2, a minor update of the Ubuntu-based distribution for the desktop with long-term support: "Released Pinguy OS 10.04.2 'Revisted'. As 10.04 is long-team support I didn't want it to fall behind. This is an updated version, it's a bit bigger then what it was before (by 300 MB) because I didn't build this from scratch, I just updated the existing 10.04.1.2 image. As of Thursday, 10th February, this was fully updated. I have added TeamViewer 6 to the install. After talking to a few people it seems many people that use Pinguy OS have installed it on a friend's or family's PC. Having TeamViewer 6 pre-installed will help them to give support and maintain their installs." The new release has many more new features, so see the release announcement if you wish to learn more.
