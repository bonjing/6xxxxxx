"A little something I created for all the Phish enthusiasts out there. This was compiled from hours and hours of research, both on the internet and from the companion. I spent a lot of time searching threads and picking out stellar versions of songs from each year. 1984-2000 section will be comprised mainly of AUD's, (98% being the top AUD circulating) with some SBD versions thrown in. 2003-2011 will be SBD quality.

Also, remember that the quality improves dramatically throughout. The 1980's is obv. a bit rough but the recordings do get much better.
