The 2005 return of Webb Wilder!Webb Wilder has developed his unique blend of twangy rockabilly and film noir into a fine, smoothly imagined new album, his first in nine years. From the self-effacing barroom lament "If You`re Looking for a Fool" to the pointed "You Might Be Lonely for a Reason," Wilder skewers his subjects with wit, reverb and a barrel-chested drawl. With his obvious love of British rock and Southern roadhouse, Wilder could be a kind of Tom Petty for the trailer set. "You don`t have to be a good shot with a scattergun," Wilder sings. As the Nashville renegade (he calls his backup band the Nashvegans) likes to say, he and his group play both kinds of music, rock and roll. Echoes of 50s instrumental rock, British Invasion, garage grunge and psychedelia all surface throughout the album.

Webb Wilder hasn't lost a step in the nine years since his last album release. ABOUT TIME has it all: Slambang rockers, twangin' laments, and cool cover tunes. And R.S. Field remains a master producer. This is definitely one all WW fans need to own, as well as anyone the least bit interested in rock and roll and Americana music.
