,sikeorama,2011-02-14T06:27Z,"It's strange.. sometime I lament not being able to find 1080p copies of movies and now I lament not having a smaller version.  

Guess I watch this at a later date.  Props on the effort though, I'll enjoy it that much more when I eventually watch it."

Your effort is greatly appreciated.  Thank you."
