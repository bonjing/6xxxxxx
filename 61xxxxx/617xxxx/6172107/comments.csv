,paradoxal47,2011-06-23T03:49Z,Funciona. Valeu.
,PooperScooperSquad,2011-08-05T07:17Z,All files are MKV files and won't play anything. Am I doing something wrong?
,PhattBouy,2011-08-08T22:51Z,"@ pooperscoopersquad - google ""vlc media player"" which is a free download and plays MKV as well as scores of other video and audio formats.  If your playback is blocky then it is possible that your pc is not fast enough to handle the file processing.  My year old netbook struggles with MKVs as it built for battery life not whizzy processing (so I have to convert to mp4 or avi, etc), my desktop is older but much more capable. If your pc can't cope then (other than getting a better pc!) you want to look for non mkv downloads, I would suggest. Good luck."

,molvica,2011-08-27T22:24Z,cant seem to get it to down load what should I do?
,ItsPete,2011-09-06T00:06Z,GREAT job!
,freedomdwarf,2011-09-22T18:40Z,"Would have been better if you uploaded the disney re-released/rerendered versions - much better quality.

@ pooperscoopersquad - grab the Matroska codec from one of the many codec packs out there. No need for the crappy VLC player.

@PhattBouy - your netbook must be pretty bad then coz my ancient 1GHz PIII PC plays MKV's with no problem."
