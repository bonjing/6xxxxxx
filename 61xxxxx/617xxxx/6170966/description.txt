It all comes down to now.

Murder. Love. Jealousy. And the ultimate sacrifice.

The Queen is dead and the Moroi world will never be the same. Now, with Rose awaiting wrongful execution and Lissa in a deadly struggle for the royal throne, the girls find themselves forced to rely upon enemies and to question those they thought they could trust...

But what if true freedom means sacrificing the most important thing of all?

Each other.




The New VA Series
Last Sacrifice will be the last book about Rose, but it'll be followed by a spin-off series still set in the Vampire Academy world.  Side characters we know from the current series will now be our main characters, and there'll be a whole new storyline (not the last one told from a different perspective).  It is scheduled for release in August 2011 and is called Bloodlines.
