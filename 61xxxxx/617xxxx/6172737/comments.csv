,humbut,2011-02-25T21:17Z,"First of all thank you very much or this nice version of win xp! You've done a nice job.

I only have one problem:
When I installed this, they ask me to enter the name and password of the admin: let's say
L: Yannick and Tanya
P: blablabla

when I start up my computer, the computer start normaly and a dialog box open asking me for Yannick and Tanya password.  I type it but it don't take it.  I have to leave the password space empty and click ""ok"" then, windows star normally.

I did what it is written, I leave the disc at least 2 minutes for at least 10 boots..

I think I don't understand very weel the part: ""Be sure to check your activation status after you have logged in""... I'am even not shure if I log in because my password don't work.

I am not realy good with computerm, can someone help me for that?

Usually, if only one profile is creatade in windows xp we should not have any password to type at statup no?

Thanks for helpin me."

,stevevt,2011-04-23T16:34Z,"Thanks a lot for the very nice work you did. Be sure that I - as well as my father (85 years old by now and still ongoing with XP) - are very happy with the smooth re-installation of your XP-version on an old Pentium III. According to my father, your software runs lik hell! Thanks again for your efforts."
,flatusgass,2011-04-28T10:00Z,"Doesnt it just figure the Aussie is the one who sounds like an idiot and writes in all caps? The closest thing to American white trash, are the Aussie trash, often hard to tell them apart. Cept the Aussies need subtitles since the ""English"" they speak is rarely intelligible. What would you expect from a lineage of criminals whose contributions to the rest of the world are Vegemite, Fosters, and, wait, that's it."
