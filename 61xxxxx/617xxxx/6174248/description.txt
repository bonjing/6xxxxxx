The 2011 Grammys are behind us and friends have flooded me with calls for some of the "lesser-known" winners and acts from the Grammys show.

The top 4 inquiries were about Arcade Fire (The Suburbs named Album of the Year), Esperanza Spalding (Best New Artist), The Avett Brothers (performed "Maggie's Farm" with the Bob Dylan and Mumford & Sons) and Mumford & Sons.

I've put together a "primer" of these artists' music. I do encourage you to actually purchase (as in lay our hard earned cash) the music if you like it as the music biz is NOT the moneymaking machine it was 10 years ago.

All the music is in Apple Lossless format and is ready to import into iTunes "as-is". If you don't like Apple, iTunes, Steve Jobs or whateverâ€¦.find it elsewhere.

The albums:

Arcade Fire - Neon Bible
Arcade Fire - The Suburbs

Esperanza Spalding - Chamber Music Society
Esperanza Spalding - Esperanza
Esperanza Spalding - Junjo
(Gosh..how can the "Best New Artist" have 3 albums under her belt?)

Mumford & Sons - Sigh No More

The Avett Brothers - Emotionalism
The Avett Brothers - I And Love And You
