,RecycledElectrons,2011-02-21T04:21Z,"I'm guessing that you finished downloading it by now, but I'll comment on the ""please seed"" comment anyway.

I have a slow upstream connection, and it takes days to weeks for me to get out new torrents, even with friends helping me.

So, It will take days until the number of seeders get over 4.

Be patient, and crank up your upload so anything you get is sent to the rest of the swarm, instead of me having to re-seed that to another leecher."
