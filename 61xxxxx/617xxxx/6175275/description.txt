A collection of books on reloading (also called handloading.) 

For the unitiated, reloading is the process of making your own ammunition. You need aboot $100 in tools, then you can assemble new rounds of ammunition from commercially available components.

This collection of books is the result of more than a dozen years as a handloading instructor. I hope it helps many of you find the right load.

These are all new scans from February, 2011. None of these files have ever been on the torrents before.

All PDFs are made up of page images, so there are NO TYPE-OHS that could cause ka-booms! The files that end in \\\"- ocr.pdf\\\" have a layer of text under the page image to make them kinda-searchable. This layer of text has not been proofread, and should not be trusted.

please check my other torrents on ThePirateBay. I have many other gun related torrents. I\\\'ll post at least a torrent a week as I am digitizing my entire library of paper books.

If you find errors, such as missing pages, please bring them to my attention. Post a comment, and I\\\'ll try to correct it.
