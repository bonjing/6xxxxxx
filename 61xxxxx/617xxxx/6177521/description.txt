                Kelly is outraged to discover Lillian has formally
                adopted Bonnie and handed her over the business. With
                Bonnie at the helm it isn't long before she shows her
                true colours with a new regime that forces Lillian
                into prostitution. Elsewhere, Libby's new job leaves
                little time to look after Patty, so she hires a
                carer, Jenny. But Patty soon realises that Jenny
                isn't quite what she appears to be and takes matter
                into her own hands. Meanwhile, Carl and Sita's
                relationship comes to an abrupt halt when Sita
                reveals she's leaving Chatsworth for an arranged
                marriage. And Avril and Jackson take action when
                Letitia's crush on Carl gets out of hand. The next
                new episode follows on E4.
