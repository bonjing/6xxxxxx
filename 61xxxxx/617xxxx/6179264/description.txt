Kaizers Orchestra performing the entirety of their sixth studio album, the first volume of the Violeta Violeta trilogy of conceptual albums, live at the venue Cosmopolite in Oslo as part of P3Sessions. And for good measure, some old classics. Enjoy, tell your fellow Kaizer fans, and as always, seed 'till you bleed (and Ompa 'till you die, obviously)!
