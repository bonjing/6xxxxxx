Wow is the first word that comes to mind in trying to describe this concert footage of Jeff
Beck at this London jazz club, Ronnie Scotts.

I have seen Jeff Beck play guitar a few times here and there over the years, but never more
than a couple songs at one venue. Now, I pretty much have an idea of all his guitar-playing
talents......and it's even more awesome than I had guessed they would be. This review, thus,
is for people not all that familiar with Beck's talents. If you already are, you've already bought
this.

In this concert, you see Beck play everything from jazz to blues to rock to ballads to "space
music." The camera-work is very good in that you really get a good luck at Jeff's ability on the
guitar. You see how he produces some of his amazing sounds.

You'll also see what a great band he has put together. Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, Jason
Rebello on keyboards and Tal Wilkenfeld on bass are all exceptional musicians and fun to
watch. All four members of this group can be seen constantly smiling and really enjoying
themselves.
