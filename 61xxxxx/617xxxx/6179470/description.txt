ReplayGain Note: The tagged gain values were generated using the R128 standard. If you use an original ReplayGain scanner, you may want to rescan this album for optimal loudness correction.

Cuesheet Note: I like to use single audio file cue sheets for my own personal use, but I made a multi-file cue sheet for this torrent. I have included both.
