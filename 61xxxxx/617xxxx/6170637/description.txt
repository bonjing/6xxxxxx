[ENCODERS COMMENT]:...............[To all nonbelievers, this is NOT a HD (720p, 1080p) rip made from a BluRay Disc, this is a RE-ENCODE of an already made HD (720p, 1080p) rip from a BluRay Disc. Now, the point of this re-encode is to get a smaller file with a better picture quality and higher resolution which is much better then a standard DVDRIP which has, of course, lower resolution and a larger file, or two of them Enjoy this release and best wishes from ziki11 ;)
