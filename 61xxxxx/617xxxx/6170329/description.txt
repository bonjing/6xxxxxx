A BMX rider's remains are discovered on the roof of a warehouse after a failed bike stunt. While Booth and Brennan interrogate the victim's fellow riders, Hodgins and newly mellowed "squint" Fisher identify the numerous fractures in the victim's skeletal structure, and Angela recreates the series of events that led to the fatal accident. Meanwhile, Sweets turns to Booth for advice about his relationship with Daisy, and Booth makes a decision about his relationship with Hannah.
