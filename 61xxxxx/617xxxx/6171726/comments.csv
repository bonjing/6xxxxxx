,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-03-20T18:46Z,"There is the only ending, afaik. Original one."
,iykwim,2011-04-13T00:20Z,"I'm curious as to why it comes with a bunch of VLC files that don't play anything and why, upon opening this app, the install page is written in something I can't understand and there's a picture of what appears to be Satan in a towel, a swastika, and the number 666? Needless to say I didn't install this and removed it from my computer immediately. XD"

You should not have done it, lol. Just play the game.
Did Swastika and 666 scared you? It's bad, when right symbols (from the viewpoint of the Universe) scare somebody. Something is not right with you."
,Lucasimo10,2011-04-20T00:06Z,What program do I run this on?
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-04-20T14:24Z,"Lucasimo10,
there is only one .exe file. Launch it."
,bastard-samurai,2011-04-23T23:27Z,How do you change the language in the game? everything runs perfect but it is a bit difficult to play because I pretty much just guess how to do everything. I basically just need step by step directions on how to find the language settings.
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-04-24T08:30Z,"@bastard-samurai
After installing the game go to its folder and open ""rev"" or ""rev.ini"" in Notepad or any editor you like.
Then find ""Language = Russian"" and replace with ""Language = English"".
That's all."
,bastard-samurai,2011-04-24T10:14Z,cool thanks for the help.

,ZombehSNAKE,2011-04-28T13:21Z,When I play the game it works fine but after I complete the testroom 10 it says something about cheats in orange at the bottom left and brings me back to the main menu. Am I doing something wrong?
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-04-30T17:28Z,"@Ertsu1
Sorry, cant suggest nothing, but only reinstalling drivers, DirectX and C++ redists.
