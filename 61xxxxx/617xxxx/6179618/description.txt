Well, this is my first torrent ever, and it's of one of my favorite hidden object games ever...since I saw that most of the torrents of it either are lacking, or have hidden little surprises in them.

Within the torrent, you'll find the game itself, the installer, as well as the crack.  I've provided the installer and crack in case the game itself doesn't work, since sometimes transferring already installed files to other computers can be a bit iffy sometimes.  The installer itself is directly from Gamehouse, so if your antivirus comes up (such as mine did when I finished installing), then don't worry about it.  It probably just doesn't like Gamehouse games.

Also, for people who aren't used to the whole "crack" system (if it's needed), I've also thrown in some simple instructions to help you out.  But enough about that, here's a description from Big Fish Games:
