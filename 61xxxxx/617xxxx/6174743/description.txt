Storyline
"From the moment I was born I cried for a month..." 
Eighteen years on, and Justin is no nearer the truth.
 And in a world that increasingly doesn't care, 
maybe just simply relying on friendship is not enough?
 Especially with friends like Billy, Sean and Tommy.
 Set amongst the backdrop of the towering, concrete-clad estates of south London
 'Zebra Crossings' blends a diverse mixture of characters that all share one thing in common:
 The incredible loneliness of living alongside 7 million other people. Blending the surreal,
 and very real, we take an intense journey in search of friendship, belief and religion.
 With a lacklustre father and estranged mother,
 Justin's only source of perennial control comes from an unlikely source,
 his bed-ridden sister Suzanne. But Justin needs is a real mentor,  a father figure,
 someone who can provide guidance before it's all too late. In steps Marcus,
 unlike anyone Justin has ever known before...
