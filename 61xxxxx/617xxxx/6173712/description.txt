T-Bone Walker was born in 1910 in Texas. He became one of the most influential guitarists of his generation, and his licks have stood the test of time and can still be heard in many modern guitarists playing. He was one of the first to play the electric guitar and he was the original guitar showman, playing the guitar behind his head and dropping into the splits, sometimes even playing the stings with his teeth. He plays mainly over blues progressions but with a slight jazz fringe, which translates harmonically to using the Blues Scale most of the time but also using the Mixolydian Mode to add those extra notes, which gave him many of his trademark licks. His style is very smooth and some of his jazz flavour is from the long flowing lines that are characteristic of his style. He worked with many fine musicians of his time including Count Basie, the Jack McVea All Stars and was a close friend of the jazz guitar legend Charlie Christian. He was awarded a Grammy in 1970 for his album "Good Feeling" which was recorded in France during a European tour in 1968. He had suffered from stomach problems and ulcers for many years, probably due to alcohol abuse, but passed away in 1975 from pnumonia.
