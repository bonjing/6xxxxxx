Subtitles (*.srt): English, Spanish, Czech

Note: These subtitles only match this release (runtime 1h 41mn 32s). There is also a release floating around on filesharing sites that has hardcoded subs and runtime 1h 42mn 32. These subtitles won't match that other release and vice versa. I don't know what the exact difference is between the two releases, because it seems nothing is missing really. It's just that some scenes have a few seconds more, others a few seconds less. But no scenes were cut out.
