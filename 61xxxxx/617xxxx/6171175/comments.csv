Like thats what you hope for each time you upoload, some desperate tricklepants laying in wait like a trap door spider shrieking about some gay shit they just have to have.  And can't figure out the search btton
thanks 20/40"
,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-11T00:10Z,"From observation, as far as file size compression is concerned, I've noticed that HDTV seems to produce much better result than Blu-ray could....Just some food for thought, that's all....Anyway, this is an exellent upload....V/8.5....DVD quality....Overall??....Excellent quality for such a small size......Thanx"
,RipTime,2011-12-11T21:52Z,"Great encode job.

Only thing I don't like is the burned-in ""Encoded by: 20-40"" at the beginning. I would have kept the down load if it hadn't defaced. "
,RipTime,2011-12-12T02:10Z,This rip has several places in the movie where garbage is hard encoded into the video. Too bad...I hate down loading shows that are polluted like this. I wish encoders would post that they left their mark burned into the encode. That way I wouldn't wast my bandwidth. 
,NuNu12,2011-12-27T22:16Z,"Thank you very much! Quite pleased with the overall quality.

A: 9
V: 10
English Subtitles: 9 (at some points in the film the subtitles would be faster or slower than the audio)

It did not bother me but at least once I noticed the watermark ""WOWOW"" appear on the upper right corner. And as RipTime mentioned, ""Encoded by: 20-40"" appears at the beginning of the film. Just thought I'd mention these notes in case people wanted to know."
,CJClags,2012-06-11T02:08Z,Props to twentyforty!
