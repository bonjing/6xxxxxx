Hal Larson (Jack Black) is a superficial man whose fixation on the physical beauty of women gets in the way of seeing them also for their inner beauty. Hal, and his equally-shallow friend, Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander) spend most of their nights being obnoxious at nightclubs and being shot down by women.

By a twist of fate, Hal becomes trapped in an elevator with famous American life coach Tony Robbins, who, after talking with Hal, hypnotizes him into only seeing physical manifestations of a person\\\'s inner beauty from then on. Hal later meets, and is smitten by, Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of Steve Shanahan (Joe Viterelli), the president of Hal\\\'s company. Rosemary is massively obese but, due to her kind and generous personality, appears to Hal as slender and beautiful. Used to being overlooked by men due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Halâ€™s interest in her as mocking, but later realizes his feelings for her are authentic, and the two begin to date.

Mauricio becomes increasingly worried about Halâ€™s new taste in women and convinces Robbins give him the trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis. Mauricio phones Hal while Hal is on a date with Rosemary, and says the trigger phrase, â€œShallow Hal wants a galâ€, which serves to break Halâ€™s hypnosis. Mauricio confesses to Hal the truth about Robbins\\\' hypnotherapy, but Hal does not believe this until he runs into Katrina, (Brooke Burns), a woman who initially appeared beautiful to him due to her inner beauty, but whom Hal now sees in her normal, unattractive state.

Hal begins to avoid Rosemary, who in turn becomes melancholic without him around. Distraught that he has not been seeing the â€œrealâ€ Rosemary, Hal accepts a dinner invitation from his neighbour, Jill, with whom he once had an unsuccessful date. The two dine together and Jill tells Hal that she has observed him overcoming his shallow nature, and that she is interested in dating him now.
