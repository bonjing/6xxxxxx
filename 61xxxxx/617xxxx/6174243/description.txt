Rogue Squadron must be installed in a (sub)directory called \'ROGUE\'
Copy the crack from the rs13_nocd folder to the Rogue folder that contains your rogue.exe and 
rogue squadron.exe files.

e.g.  c:\\Program Files\\LucasArts\\ROGUE\\

Click on the Patch! button to patch your Rogue.exe and Rogue Squadron.exe files and
change two registry entries of RS.

IMPORTANT: Copy off your game CD \"rogue\\data\\bundle.000\" and \"rogue\\data\\bundle.001\" into rogue\\data
of your game installation root.

If you are running XP (or Vista), like I am, and if you are experiencing game crashes after finishing a mission, like I am,
you might like the following. 

The game crashes because of a memory fault, its trying to read a memory space that is blank.
Compatibility mode settings are crap, don\'t use. I have included an edited .exe that won\'t crash anymore !!! 

Just rename the original to - for instance - Rogue Squadron.old and copy the file from the \"Edited\" folder.
