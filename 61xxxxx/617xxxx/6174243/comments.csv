,MarcAce,2011-02-15T01:23Z,"Ezrydn, I'm just seeding a game I like and finally got to work on my PC, without any crashes and I'd like others to be able to do so as well. I'm sorry you're running into trouble. Did ya run the hardware config ? (by means of Rogue.exe)"
,MarcAce,2011-02-15T01:53Z,"Ezrydn, In answer to your remark, try any of these:

Make a shortcut of SWEP1RCR.EXE from the CD, put it on your DESKTOP, then right-click and select Properties. change the 'Target' to ""(CD drive letter):\SWEP1RCR.EXE"". The 'Start In' should have the hard drive location of the game.

Try changing the anti-aliasing settings for your particular graphics card. Click on Additional Properties and use the Manual Option for setting anti-aliasing. Use 4xS (Direct3D Only)

Download updated executable file from here ftp://ftp.lucasarts.com/patches/pc/SWEP1RCR.EXE and overwrite the original in the game folder. 
If need be you can get a3dapi.dll and replace it too ftp://ftp.lucasarts.com/patches/pc/a3dapi.dll

Download the patch from http://support.lucasarts.com/trg/xp/swep1racer.htm and install it
Go into your graphics card setup, find the button which allows you to tweak your AA (Anti Aliasing) to the maximum.

Hope this works for ya. "

,ezrydn,2011-02-26T16:47Z,"Sometimes, you have to piss a couple folks off to get the answer you need.  It was NOT to detract from MarcAce's torrent.  It was simply a reach for info.  

Thanks MarcAce for your response.  To the others, go out and ""get some."""
