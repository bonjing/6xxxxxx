For WICKED GRIN, John Hammond takes a break from interpreting the likes of Sleepy John Estes and Blind Lemon Jefferson to have a go at the canon of good friend Tom Waits. Further authenticating this project is Waits's involvement as producer and musician. Rounding out the cast on this impressive project are Sir Douglas Quintet keyboardist Augie Meyers, harp legend Charlie Musselwhite, Canned Heat's Larry Taylor, and Fabulous Thunderbird Stephen Hodges on skins.

Turning to albums like RAIN DOGS, SWORDFISHTROMBONES, and BONE MACHINE for source material, Hammond used his pliable baritone and tasty fretwork to inhabit the characters and seedy scenarios of these songs. Druggies and prostitutes come to life in the 12-bar blues dirge that is "Heart Attack and Vine," while the image of homesick sailor in a foreign port is teased out with an economically played Vox organ throughout "Shore Leave." Elsewhere, Hammond and company make like Los Super Seven on the norteno-flavored "Jockey Full Of Bourbon," with Meyers and his squeezebox making like Flaco Jimenez. The only non-Waits song included is "I Know I've Been Changed," an album-ending traditional gospel number turned into a field holler by Waits's shredded growl and Hammond's soulful howl.
