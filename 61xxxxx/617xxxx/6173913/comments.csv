pastapadre.com/2010/11/23/nba-2k11-patch-details"
,Pepi430,2011-02-14T21:21Z,"is this for NA or EU version of the game?

tnx"
[T],rlf-rls,2011-02-14T21:28Z,"This is scene release... it's made for scene release of the game:
NBA.2K11-FLT"
,ts-archon,2011-02-14T23:47Z,"anyone know how i could get this patch to work with the TPTB version of the game? thepiratebay.org/torrent/5868795/PC_NBA.2K11.Full-Rip.-TPTB
dont wanna have to download and install the FLT version if I can avoid it."
,Brandon187,2011-02-15T14:36Z,"How the fuck do you install this?

""- Install the update by choosing ""repair"" when asked"" Where the hell does it ask that? Be more specific next time please."
,viperstrikes,2011-02-15T19:28Z,@Brandon187 Use 7 zip to extract through the windows installer(it works). Copy the extracted content in the nba folder and then paste the updated crack in the same folder. Good to go after that.
,Brandon187,2011-02-16T07:06Z,"@viperstrikes

Thanks bro."
,am_sirc,2011-02-18T04:37Z,Can we connect to online with this? Not to be offensive but the FANiSO's NBA2K11 release can connect online before the patch came out. If this connects online then I'll re-download NBA2K11 again with this scene's release.
,kuku09,2011-02-25T13:21Z,does this work on the TPTB nba 2k11 or should i have to DL 2k11 of scene
,by11,2011-02-27T04:20Z,does this work??? because i followed your instruction to extract through the installer but it failed..it said corrupted archive :(
,trogglodytes,2011-03-05T01:43Z,"It works perfectly with TPTB version. All you have to do is open it with 7-zip and you'll see the .msp file in there. Don't unpack, just double click it within 7-zip, and it will show the 10 files included. Backup all of them in your 2k11 folder before replacing. 
Play the game and check if the Cavs court is updated. Done."
,kuku09,2011-03-05T15:02Z,"@trogglodytes

when i click on the .msi an error shows up ""the upgrade patch cannot be installed...."" ive tried the official patch too after extracting same message show up."
,trogglodytes,2011-03-05T16:30Z,"@kuku09: You're can't install anything, you have to drag and drop files and replace. If you read my post correctly, I said ""Don't unpack"". If you try to execute it normally as an install file, of course it will fail, because it won't recognize any original file. You have to open the .msp with 7-zip or winRAR (I only tested with 7-zip, but RAR should work too), so you'll see the 10 files inside it. Put all of them inside your nba211 main folder and replace the old ones. (Backup first)."
,kuku09,2011-03-06T05:21Z,"@trogglodytes

thanks sir...i didn't know you could do that haha...im not a newbie but that was a first for me...^_^"
,kuku09,2011-03-06T05:27Z,guys winrar doesn't work...it finds the files as 0kb and corrupted but 7z does
,TheSur5all,2011-03-09T08:51Z,Thanks
,tibidisdik44,2011-03-11T05:57Z,"I have to say...I am completely lost on this 1...instead of opening with utorrent, you open with 7zip? I'd appreciate it if some could help me out."
,abrenica195,2011-05-10T18:39Z,Hello I want to Play ONline but I can;t reqister because I dont have a serial number I just download NBa 2k11 from here do someone of you let me borrow your account thank you
,unit56,2011-05-19T08:47Z,you dont need serial key
,ver2s,2011-05-25T15:56Z,"I did copy it to the installation folder, i chose repair, but no updates, must something with the way i did it"
,Tyson212,2011-09-01T07:15Z,Still no answer on whether or not we can get online with this one...
,Tyson212,2011-09-01T08:33Z,"Opened with 7-zip...

Tried copying (not installing) the 10 files to the 2k11 folder as directed...

Error message comes up telling me all 10 files are broken...

What now?"
,Tyson212,2011-09-01T08:52Z,"Okay I tried the process again....the 10 files were copied...but now it's telling me that the CD is missing when I try to run the game.

If the nba2k11.exe file isn't the new crack, then where is it?

And I didn't see any message asking me to repair anything...all i did was choose the ""copy to.."" option within 7zip...

What am I doing wrong?"
,Tyson212,2011-09-01T09:06Z,"Okay....I'm a freaking moron...

I figured it out...just disregard everything I said...

And yes, online is accessible..."
