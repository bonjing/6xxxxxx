Silvertone is the first album by Chris Isaak, released in 1985, and named after his three-piece backup band.
The album was not a hit until the song "Gone Ridin'" was featured in the 1986 David Lynch film Blue Velvet, the first of many Isaak/Lynch collaborations, though the song had previously appeared on the soundtrack to the film American Flyers the year before. "Dancin'" appeared in the film Modern Girls released the same year, but wasn't included on the soundtrack. "Gone Ridin'" was used in the 1987 comedy Morgan Stewart's Coming Home. Two songs from this album were played on the Fox's long running teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210 including "Gone Ridin'" was played in the Season 2 episode "Pass, Not Pass" and "Dancin'" was played in the Season 3 episode "Castles in the Sand".
