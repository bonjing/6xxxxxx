Everything ready to be used on a EONON D5102 Mazda 3 Unit. This has the Telenav Q2 2010 Maps for Mexico, United States, and Canada. 

This could be used on other units as well. iGo Software + maps is basically what this has, but the sys.txt has been edited specifically to work on the D5102 due to the resolution changes. But, they can be edited to work on other units. 

The maps can be updated through the POI and MAPS folder. To save space, you can delete maps, voices, or languages you do not require. 

Hope it helps!
