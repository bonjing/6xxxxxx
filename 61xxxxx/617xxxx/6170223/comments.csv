,bartomanboy,2011-02-12T20:06Z,"Remember:
do a fresh installation of the original game, that's the Original Distant Worlds, otherwise it will NOT work. 
The patches of the original messes up the Expansion installation.

Happy gaming!"
,bartomanboy,2011-02-12T20:16Z,"You can download the original Distant Worlds from here:

,gimli23,2011-02-13T13:12Z,"i have a problem: 
i downloaded the original distant worlds from the link you gave and installed everything (i didn't apply cracks and updates to the original). when i tried to start the game it said ""distant worlds has stoped working"". win7 x64, any ideas? "
,gimli23,2011-02-13T13:39Z,"@bartomanboy
I have a problem:
After installing everything as the instructions say I get ""Distant Worlds has stopped working"" error on startup. After a few reinstallations (applying updates,no updates,just crack,etc.) nothing has changed.
OS is Win7,64-bit. Any suggestions?"
,Grzegrzolka40,2011-02-13T14:03Z,remember guys that this isnt offical release of any group. patch 1.005 is clean (i checked it with virustotal) but im not sure about other files so better watch out. 
,motley666,2011-02-13T16:13Z,"Gimli win 7 suck, they are unfriendly with older games. Try combatibility mode."
,bartomanboy,2011-02-13T16:49Z,"I had ewactly the same problem. I have Windows 7 64bit too. I'll explain to you exactly how I installed it.

1)Install Distant Worlds Original"
,bartomanboy,2011-02-13T16:52Z,"I had ewactly the same problem. I have Windows 7 64bit too. I'll explain to you exactly how I installed it.

1)Install Distant Worlds Original 
      When using the skidrow version you can enter any cd key you like. Now, what I did, is just copy the CD-key I added in the readme, and change one or two numbers of them. Just make sure it has the same 'lay-out'.
2)Install the expansion with the cd-key added.
3) Install the patch.

This worked for me. If you have any more problems, I would love to help.
Also, don't forget you have to reinstall everything!"
,gimli23,2011-02-13T18:28Z,"It works perfectly,thank you!"
,Silvest,2011-02-17T19:43Z,Do you have the latest patch?
,sdklleged,2011-02-18T21:50Z,"it works! Tryed like 5 times, my mistake was that i installed crack to original dw all the time) win7 x64"
,BioHaZZarD99,2011-02-20T17:12Z,"I have teh same problem as Gimli23, Distant Worlds has stopped working when using teh quick-launch shortcut. However the game menu makes it work. did clean install, even deleted teh program files and appdata folders.

Motley:
Think before you speak, DW was designed for XP/Vista/7, and 7 has no issues with games designed for xp/vista"

I think this is what you're doing wrong, am I right?"
,BioHaZZarD99,2011-02-23T03:57Z,"My problem is with the actual coding of the game. It requires access to it's program files folder, which requires Administrator elevation in Windows 7, so I have to run the game as administrator (a big WTF??! imo, but so is the coding engine of DW)

So if anyone running Windows 7 with the default UAC security policies, set DW quick start to run as administrator, it should work. Fixed my error.

Now only if I could get my automated destroyers to stop picking up all the fucking troops on me!"
,Dead_Devil,2011-03-08T04:24Z,"Greetings.

Can you tell me if you can update this, after 1.501?? I'm sure that there is a new version but the updater always tell me that i have the last version..."
,bartomanboy,2011-03-08T11:04Z,There is no further update. (Yet.)
,morMi,2011-03-08T15:54Z,"I still can't run this game. The same stopped working problem at startup. I tried to install it several times, I am always running it in administrator mode, but still nothing.

I think I installed it as you said, but who knows maybe I missed something. I have Windows 7 and I am starting to give up."
,Coggs,2011-03-08T17:23Z,I too get problems with trying to run it. Anyone got it working?
,Unloved_Grudge,2011-03-09T10:42Z,"I'm using Vista 64 bit and I got it working, here's how:

-Install Distant Worlds. If you already have it installed, uninstall it and make sure the Distant Worlds folder in your hard drive is completely empty. Install the game but do not apply any updates OR cracks.
-Install the expansion using the key code provided in the ""readme"".
-Install the patch and play away!"
,MarQan,2011-03-09T12:15Z,worked for me.. thanks!
,morMi,2011-03-09T14:49Z,"If somebody have a new tip how to make this game work, I would be glad. I tried as Unloved_Grudge said many time. But still the same."
,Dead_Devil,2011-03-09T18:22Z,"@bartomanboy, Thanks for the quick reply.

You say that there are no updates but i browsed the DW forums and there are versions like 1.502, 1.503 and so on. Can you tell me what are those versions?

Thanks in advance :)"
,bartomanboy,2011-03-11T13:25Z,"Maybe I was just wrong! ;)

@Mormi: Do you use the Skidrow version of the original distant worlds?
Because if you do, you will have to enter a serial that has the same 'lay-out' as the serial in the readme, although it can be completely different numbers. (The skidrow version doesn't check the serial, but I got it working that way.)"
,Dead_Devil,2011-04-04T06:27Z,"@bartomanboy, ok then :)

so...can you upload the patchs? :P"
,Dead_Devil,2011-04-11T03:16Z,well...seems you don't want to upload them. Well...it's your choice
,Dead_Devil,2011-04-11T03:18Z,"seems that the patch 1.508 is available to the public

http://www.gamepron.com/file/4226/Distant-Worlds-Return-of-the-Shakturi-Patch-1.5.0.8/download/"
,Dead_Devil,2011-04-11T03:20Z,"well, i guess i will buy this game. It is worth it. :)"
,endemoniada,2011-05-09T05:42Z,Will this work when patched to 1.5.0.8 ?
,endemoniada,2011-05-11T06:11Z,"Man, I can't get this to work, it gives me a ""this program has stopped working"" when I start it up. I tried running as admin, reinstalling, I tried everything. I think it's some .NET error due to poor programming."
,bartomanboy,2011-05-15T18:12Z,"@endemoniada This works perfectly with the 1.508 patch.

I can't tell you wrong, but mostly the problem lies with the computer running the program rather than the program itself.
I had had that error before too, you have to carefully read all the steps explained by me in the comments, then it should work. 
I hope this does the job for you, otherwise, just post another comment and I'll try to help you further."
,dauth3,2011-06-02T04:09Z,"*For anyone having a problem running the game make sure you manually delete your old distant world folder. I think some skidrow files are leftover after uninstall and mess up the game.

*Anyone know a way to install the 1.0.7.0 patch? I can't get it to go with this serial, probably was blacklisted."
,bartomanboy,2011-06-28T00:36Z,"The 1.0.7.0 is a patch only for the original game, you should then enter a serial key from the original distant worlds, and not the expansian.

To make it clear to all other people downloading this, patch 1.508 is the most recent patch at this time, and this works perfectly fine with the serial added in this torrent."
,bartomanboy,2011-07-17T13:14Z,"For those of you still having trouble, I uploaded a new, better torrent with everything you need to install it correctly.
