Storyline: A man finds out that what you don't say to a friend is just as important as what you
 do is this story of how far you can bend a brotherly bond before it snaps. Since college, 
confirmed bachelor Ronny (Vaughn) and happily married Nick (James) have been through thick 
and thin. Now partners in an auto design firm, the two pals are vying to land a dream project
 that would launch their company. Ronny's girlfriend, Beth (Connelly), and Nick's wife, Geneva 
(Ryder), are by their sides. But Ronny's world is turned upside down when he inadvertently 
sees Geneva out with another man and makes it his mission to get answers. As the amateur 
investigation dissolves into mayhem, he learns that Nick has a few secrets of his own. 
Now, with the clock ticking and pressure mounting on the biggest presentation of their 
careers, Ronny must decide what will happen if he reveals the truth to his best friend.
