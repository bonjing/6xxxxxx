John Tams is one of our finest musicians and singers and one of our greatest songwriters. He can sing traditional material wonderfully and, at the same time, has written some of our best songs ever. Harry Stone, otherwise known as Hearts of Coal, and the beautiful Hugh Stenson and Molly Green are just two of his songs that have entered the canon in the last few years.â€¨â€¨On this album, John deals the tradition â€“ reworking several classic songs â€“ and then adds his own unmistakable originals to produce a landmark new album.
