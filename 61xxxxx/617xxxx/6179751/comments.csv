,pinzmoo,2011-05-08T14:56Z,First for me; getting an error on the actual torrent; redirects it to tv series the wire 1-6 then errors
,zookap,2011-05-10T09:04Z,Arnold is a fucking nazi scumbag who writes openly about admiring Hitler. It's in his book on or around page 400 I think. He also wears an original SS death belt which he got from his Nazi scumbag grandfather. Look it up.
,Trigun83,2011-05-25T02:02Z,"lol... if he is nazi, gay or lesbo i dont care!!...

,rocky908,2011-06-28T00:02Z,Terrible torrent. Although the quality of video and sound are good while watching terminator 2 and 3 it cuts to clips of chuck and glee. Annoying to say the least.

,XXD1XX,2012-04-13T14:39Z,"It's amazing how well The Terminator holds up against movies that are released this year and it's 27 years old... o_O 

I love all 4 of these movies! 

I think I'm going to hold out for the first 3 as BR rips though. 

Thanks for uploading this anyway Toilet Sniffer! You're a credit to Pirate Bay even though 90% of the assholes that leech on this site don't deserve a fucking bullet in the head..."
