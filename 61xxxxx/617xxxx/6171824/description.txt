This is the third upload of newly-written subtitles for the BBC miniseries known as 

The Pallisers (1974). 

I have now idea how many of the 26 total episodes I will complete.

As usual I enclose those phrases or words which are uncertain with parentheses.



Computer problems caused this delay in my writing this episode.

My intention is to do The Pallisers 4 before going back to Upstairs, Downstairs.

I will try to finish the last to episodes of Season 1 and stop there, stop UD.
