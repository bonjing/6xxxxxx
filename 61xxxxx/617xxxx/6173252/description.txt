Having led the frontline for the "Icicle Works" throughout the 80's, Ian McNabb disbanded the band in the early 90's after the release of the 5th studio album and started work on his debut solo album. 

Signed to the newly formed label "This Way Up" saw the release during the first half of the 90's of 3 solo albums. Each one crammed full of top quality melodic tunes. 

Since the demise of the record label in 96 / 97 there has been a self financed semi acoustic album which in the stripped down format that it was 
recorded more than ever confirmed what a brilliant songwriter / performer the man really is.

With a new album in Ian Broudie's studio and a record deal with Sanctuary records, year 2001 promises to be a good one for Mr. Ian " Boots " McNabb. The self titled studio album from the former Icicle Works front man who was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Music Prize for his 1995 album 'Head Like a Rock', was  recorded on Pete Townsend's barge in summer 2000 and contains 14 new songs that see Ian returning to his more rock oriented days.

The release of the brilliant new self titled studio album in April 2001 was followed by a rousing UK tour with full backing band.
