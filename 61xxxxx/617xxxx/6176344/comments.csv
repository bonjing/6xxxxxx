,ulikes,2011-02-16T01:30Z,Glad you are back. Was worried about you.
,oemn2011,2011-02-16T03:34Z,"hey guys whats up, listen your torrents are great man , but if you don't mind me saying, it would be a good idea to put on the ""important information"" paragraph that when you burn the dvd's with imgburn and play it on a ps3 sometimes it takes up to 5-7 mins to read the disk ,u know tell the people to be patient and let it read, and not to think its damaged or something. and guys if u have any information on this , is it normal it takes that long to play? or if there is something wrong ? i would apreciate it if u tell me or just confiremed that u got this message.
nonetheless thank you for your time , i hope u can share any feedback with me please leave me a comment or send me a message to my email (oscar-jennifer@hotmail.com) 
thanks. "

[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-16T11:41Z,"ulikes - Safe and well, thanks :o)

oemn2011 - Sounds like your PS3 has a problem, as the initial read should take less than 10 seconds. It might just need the laser cleaned/re-aligned."
,oemn2011,2011-02-16T21:11Z,"hey guys thanks for answering and yea i found the problem , it seems that imgburn burned something wrong in the disk that allowed to take that much to read, this happen with he movie (inception), but i download it robin hood and the a-team and it read it normal. in less than 10 secs the movie was playing ,so I'm downloading inception again and burn it again of course , nonetheless amazing sound and quality ,thumbs up guys keep up the good work 
thanks"
,lvnitup,2011-03-05T06:56Z,"hi i need help, i'm a bit new to this, i downloaded the the torent and tried burning it with ImgBurn but their is no BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders (as per instructions), only a ISO file? so add the ISO file instead but the disk shows nothing on the disc after the burn but is no longer a blank disc. i've also tried mounting it on MagicISO and it says ""Windows cannot read from this disk. The disk might be corrupted, or it could be using a format that is not compatible with Windows.""
any tip from anyone as it is doing my head in!"
