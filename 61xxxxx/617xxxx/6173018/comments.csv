,dkent555,2011-05-15T01:21Z,"Thanks so much for this, you're a star!

I normally buy apps direct from the App Store, to support the developers of their great work, but from time to time get them for free, with thanks to you and The Pirate Bay for existing ;)

Thanks again."
,oceanspeed,2011-07-21T15:38Z,Doesnt work for me.  Makes a LOT Of disk noise and the file in the zip file is dated 2009 which makes me very suspicious.  Anyone else care to comment on this one?

Will there be a fix to this??  Please!!!"
