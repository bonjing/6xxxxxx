The two teams of contestants are all tied up this week - 

literally - in a rope challenge in which teamwork will determine 

which group of players will get to use the gym this week, and 

which team will have to be creative and find other places at the 

ranch to work out. One trainer moves into the house to try and 

get a contestant to open up, and later, one team wins the chance 

to block someone's weight on the scale at a wild physical and 

mental challenge that finds them pushing a train 800 feet while 

answering food fact questions along the way. Then one player 

reaches a milestone at the weigh-in before another contestant is 

eliminated and sent home.
