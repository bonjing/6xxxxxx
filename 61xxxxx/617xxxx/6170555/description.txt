Brooms, by STOMP

Stomp is a non-traditional dance troupe from Brighton, U.K. They use their bodies and ordinary objects to make rhythm and comedy. Their shows are an unique combination of percussion, movement and visual expression. Stomp uses just about anything, from brooms to trashcans, drumsticks to bananas, to make music.

This is their short cinematic from 1995 called "Brooms".
If you like the genre The Blue Man Group is in, you 'll like this one too.
