In December 1914, Charlie Chaplin began his one-year contract with the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, shooting films in both their Chicago and California studios. During that one year he made fifteen films, earned an unprecedented salary and established himself as a firm box-office favourite. Unlike other artists, Chaplin had full control over his Essanay films from writing the scripts and directing, through to choosing his cast members. Audiences around the world clamoured to see his latest Essanay picture.

Charlie Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 in East Street, Walworth, South London, and from extremely humble origins (part of his childhood was spent in homes for destitute children) he rose to become one of the most extraordinary and enduring icons of the cinema, whose power to move audiences is undiminished. In Britain, Chaplin's critical reputation suffered a period of eclipse from the 1960s, in reaction to the high regard in which he was held by public and critics alike at the peak of his career. Now the BFI is leading a major revaluation of his life and achievements.
