Well, they're from Austin, but you would think they were from New Orleans with all the soul they have. Steel and slide guitar by Harry Bodine meld perfectly with Mike Milligan's bluesy vocals, and what results is a mature sound that says they've been around the block a few times. The lyrics, too, emit pangs of a musician's jadedness on certain tracks like, "Can't Live Without It." ("Another night/Another club/ Another line across my face"). The concepts are simple but sincere, the playing not fancy but tight. This is a good record to play when you hang out by the levee.
