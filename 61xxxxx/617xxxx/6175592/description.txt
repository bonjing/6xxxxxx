"A Day in the Life"

When Harry (Kathy Bates) discovers her 
client is guilty, she proclaims his guilt 
in front of the jury when she is not 
allowed to quit the case. The judge has no 
choice but to find Harry in contempt and 
recommend her for permanent disbarment. 
Meanwhile, Malcolm (Aml Ameen) goes 
undercover with Cincinnati's finest in 
exchange for an expunged criminal record.

Enjoy :)
