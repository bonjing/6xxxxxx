Hit the Wall was initially only available as part of the soundtrack in the Iron Man 2 video game. Until now the only stand alone version of the song was a rip that didn't include Randy's vocals.

Now the full song has been released as a digital download single, and here it is, Randy screaming and all! :)

To be honest, there's a torrent with an m4a file floating around too. I took that file, converted it and reuploaded it. Thought I'd save you lot the trouble of converting it yourself.
