,formerly_azrielle,2011-02-13T21:19Z,"Thanks for Outcasts.  Interesting, depressing--do the sociatal sensitives (sci-fi writers) have no hope for humankind?  They have us all making the same old mistakes--shades of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's Lucifer's Hammer set on a new planet.  I for one think we are bigger than that--or would be if we somehow could prevent the same ""classes"" of people from being in charge.  Otherwise, they may just have a point."
