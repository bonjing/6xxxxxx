,namorax2,2011-02-12T22:01Z,Looks like religious paranoid bullshit to me.
[T],verifire,2011-02-13T03:29Z,"Love you too, Neo[n].. ;-)

And as to ""namorax2's: ""Looks like religious paranoid bullshit to me"", there's only one clever thing to say and that's.. ..eeahmm.. ..no.. ..I.. ..sorry. I just can't come up with anything. 
[Might be because what it ""seems like"" to ""namorax2"" doesn't really change the facts of the matter, and ""comments"" like that from someone with no reality check button are nothing but testimonies of ignorance. Sad, increasingly boring, but true..]



But, you, Neo[n].. Did I mention I love you? ;D"

I've also seen William Schnoebelen's Interview with an Ex-Vampire. Despite the massive amount of christian disinfo, he does give some good insight. I'd say it is a very humorous interview to watch because he makes absurd claims and tells fictional stories while smirking and mixing in useful bits of esoteric knowledge here and there. Watch with discernment and a sense of humor./"

Nice post hissil.. Actually got me smiling and nodding my head in recognition of, let's say 'certain' public figures, 'telling the truth, finally!'

'LOL' but with the bitter taste lingering, that of  having connected enough dots by now to enter John Connors analysis of ongoing activity and influences to lead us.. ..where..?"

while trying to limit my comment-comments, I'll violate that for this.

Now:

""I think this is great! Men that refused to be bullied by other MEN about their beliefs of a book written by MEN, proclaiming to be the word of God.""

Well, that's your own statement, and totally subjective. That's your own business, OK by me.

""If you never heard of Jesus, would you go to hell?""

Actually, no. It's not that horrendously unjust.

In Pauls letter to the Roman Christians, he says clearly that those who have never heard of the God of Moses and the Christians, but still lead a life that is good, just like if the law of God was written in their hearts, the one that goes: ""Love your fellow man and love God"", only they don't know of God.

Would a just God condemn such? Of course not. Just read it, it's in the beginning chapters...

""And why is the use of magic considered evil, yet if Jesus uses it, it's a freakin miracle!?!!!!!!!!!!!! ""

Magic or magik is a word to describe the knowledge and power of the Magi of old Persia.

Many, if not all, those schools of having your way via summoning, chanting, making sigills and what have you, call upon spirits or are aided by spirits that does NOT so much succumb to the God of Jesus.
But Jesus did, so all He asked for, He got.
He didn't have to partake in any mystical ritual besides His inner prayer-life to have those miracles happen.

So; two different sources of power for what most would recognize as an act of supernatural forces' aid = Trust and go with and to God or trust and go with and to..?

Is what I wrote today..
