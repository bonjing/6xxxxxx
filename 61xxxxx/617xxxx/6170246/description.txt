Hi There..


With the recent fourth addition to this series of the secrets surrounding the beginnings of the USA, I figured it would be nice if I could recomp all four parts so that they'd fit on one standard DVD-5. Practical for archiving and also for playing in a standalone DivX-player.
Plus it saves bandwidth and downloadtime.. 

The result was actually amazingly good quality, all things considered. 

All in all ca. 11 hours 30 minutes or so of info crammed onto one DVD.
I'm impressed. With AVIrecomp that is.. THAT'S a great app. And free. "Prozac" is a great guy, and constantly improving the software. Respect..

Now; The resolutions are 640 x 480, and 720 x 480 pxl, and the codecs are DivX and XviD.

The series now include the movies:

1. THE NEW ATLANTIS - XviD [2006] - Runtime 02:45:55 (hr:min:sec)
2. RIDDLES IN STONE - DivX [2007] - Runtime 02:54:44 (hr:min:sec)
3. EYE OF THE PHOENIX - DivX [2009] - Runtime 02:51:28 (hr:min:sec)
4. HIDDEN FAITH OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS - XviD [2010] - Runtime 02:59:31 (hr:min:sec)

The upload include front covers and separate logs with the technical details of the recomped rips.
