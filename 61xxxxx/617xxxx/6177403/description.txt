New NodLogin 10.0.3 

All previous versions will stop working. 

The NodLogin is compatible with all products and all 
ESET versions (2.7, 3.0, 4.0, 4.2) 

As you know NodLogin not a crack, not a patch, not a fix. 
The NodLogin not modify any files or windows antivirus, 
does not change the antivirus logs and under windows, so 
All it does is put a valid license antivirus, take 
that profits are recognized as false positives, and 
ESET puts its virus signature database, so that the antivirus 
delete it from your PC. 

To remove the antivirus utility, you should exclude 
folder where you unzip the utility and exclude 
also the folder where you installed the NodLogin. 
C: \ Program Files \ UlisesSoft \ 
If you exclude the folder will not have problems with false positive 
and remove antivirus utility. 

Only versions 4.x 
---------------------------------- 
ESET recently blocked the web server and run nodlogin 
nodlogin gives a message that I could not connect to database 
This is solved in this way: 
1. Login to antivirus 
2. Press F5 
3. Enter the menu: 
Antivirus and Antispyware>> Protection of Internet traffic>> Management 
Address 
In this window we select: 
List of excluded addresses filtering: 
Press the Add button and enter: 
* Ulisessoft * (astericoulisessoftasterisco) 
This will exclude the (ww.ulisessoft.info) List 
Antivirus filtering and thus will not block when connecting to NodLogin 
to the database (it sends an image of the configuration). 

Important: 
----------------- 
If running NodLogin gives the message "No match 
valid licenses now "is because the database 
NodLogin not have valid licenses, this happens generally for 
the products ESET Smart Security "and that the licenses for the 
product are low, just be patient until they update 
database. 

PS: Keep in mind that there are 2 files one for 32bit and one 64bit.
