he Sarah Silverman Program is an American television series that starred comedian and actress Sarah Silverman, who created the series with Dan Harmon and Rob Schrab. The show premiered on February 1, 2007 on Comedy Central.[1] Episodes revolve around the comedic hi-jinks and adventures of Sarah and her friends in Valley Village, California, a district in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles, which is portrayed as an autonomous city within the show. Silverman plays a fictionalized version of herself, an unemployed, immature woman who leads an irresponsible life. Her most notable trait is her undiluted, childlike self-absorption, which commonly leads to awkward, comedic situations in which she insults friends, family and total strangers. The show tackled issues such as abortion, racism, and same-sex marriage. The show was canceled after running three seasons

Another one of my faves after catching it on TVU Players comedy central, got all three seasons here the names are somewhat to be desired but they are labeled none the less. Converted to MP4 for handhelds and portables.
