Description:

The Forgotten Man

Reporter: Quentin McDermott

Broadcast: 14/02/2011

While WikiLeaks boss Julian Assange has been cast as a heroic 
champion of free speech, his ongoing expose of US foreign policy 
would not have been possible without the work of Private Bradley 
Manning. It was Manning who allegedly stole the classified documents 
published by WikiLeaks. It is Manning who now languishes in a US 
military prison.

Now reporter Quentin McDermott tells the inside story of Bradley 
Manning and his daring intelligence heist. David House is one of the 
few civilians allowed to visit Bradley Manning in jail. He describes the 
young soldier's mental deterioration and his struggle to deal with long 
hours of confinement.

He tells the program: "...the US Government is just trying to put 
immense pressure on him in order to get him to crack open."

In Monday's Four Corners we hear the only recording of Bradley 
Manning's voice and we listen to the logs of alleged conversations 
with the man who ultimately betrayed him.

That man is Adrian Lamo. In an extraordinary interview he reveals 
how he came to know Bradley Manning, claiming the young soldier 
openly confessed to him his role in the WikiLeaks scandal.

Four Corners also explores the disputes that have erupted inside 
WikiLeaks. A former insider has told the program how he held deep 
reservations about Julian Assange's determination to keep releasing 
material that might compromise his source.

The program puts these accusations to the WikiLeaks boss.

There is little doubt America wants to punish Julian Assange. But to 
bring a case against him vital questions must be answered: How did 
Private Bradley Manning steal the classified material? How did he 
relay it to WikiLeaks? Did he do this of his own accord or did Julian 
Assange conspire with him to take the information?
