,Sportchek,2011-02-22T17:43Z,"I hope whoever uploads these realizes that season three ENDED at episode 26...
So this is actually season 4.. and now season 4 is over
Good job"
,LakersCentral,2011-02-24T11:06Z,i guess that depends on what you use for your source. http://epguides.com/PawnStars/ has season 3 still going. they only took a month long break after episode 26. not logical that the season ended there.
