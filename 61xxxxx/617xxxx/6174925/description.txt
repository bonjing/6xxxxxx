The Treble Spankers are now an integral part of Dutch music history. Their first album Araban earned a cult status at US college radio. The next single Red Hot Navigator became a radio hit in Holland, their second album Hasheeda lingered in the Dutch Album Top 100 for weeks and even topped Hollandâ€™s leading music magazine OORâ€™s â€˜moordlijstâ€™. Glorious shows at Lowlands festival and Pinkpop proved their triumph is no accident.

Success has not kept the musical cowboys from day-to-day rehearsals in order to excel in front of you as the best and most playing band of this moment. And thatâ€™s a good thing too, because a concert by these Amsterdam guys is an experience you are bound to remember for a long time. Their music is rebellious, and as mysterious as the swamps of Sumatra, and expresses the mysticism of the American Indians. One moment you find yourself on a surf board in Waimea Bay, the next you are in a seedy night club in Casablanca in 1942. Several guest musicians and other surprise elements cause a Treble Spankersâ€™ show to be even more exciting.

These musical omnivores donâ€™t care a rap for trends and externals. They provided magnificent songs by diverse artists such as Kraftwerk, Herb Alpert and 2 Unlimited with new energy. Casually, they added a few classics to music history by means of their own brilliant compositions.

The Treble Spankers are the already legendary Marcel â€˜Supermodâ€™ Kruup (rhythm guitar), Frank Sloos (a hypnotizing drummer), Maarten Heijblok (bass) and â€˜Phantomâ€™ Frank Gerritsen, who not only makes his guitar jump around like Jimi Hendrix in a pinball machine but can also make it sound like a macho flamenco singer from Andalusia. Be sure you get to see The Treble Spankers before they conquer the world!
