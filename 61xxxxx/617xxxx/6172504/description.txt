These two albums are long out of print.  You can still find the cds from $60-$90 though.  The band had some conflict with Sony and their music was never released digitally.  Ive never seen these albums uploaded anywhere.

The vinyl is 30 years old and has been played on many of my turntables through the years so its not in pristine condition.

Classic 80s New Wave/Pop.

Equipment used:  

Linn LP12 turntable, Linn Ittok LV II tonearm, Linn K18 cartridge, Linn LK1 preamp, Cardas Quadlink 5C RCA cable, Pioneer PDR 609 cd recorder, Verbatim Vibe Music CDR.
