Here it is: Guy Forsyth knows how to provide a damn good time by way of gutbucket blues playing. He plays a mean slide guitar himself, and backs that up with the odd burst of dirty blues harp playing, and he has a voice that's a step and a half from Tom Waits, so the vocals have lots of character. The 14 songs on the album are played full force, and the band is as tight as can be, the energy level is terrific, and the album as a whole produces the sort of excitement that makes for a great party record.
