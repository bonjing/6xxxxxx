Book Description
================
Noted historian Barbara Tuchman examines the American Revolution. She provides an insightful look at the war not only from the British and American viewpoints, but also from the perspectives of other nations that were affected by this conflict, namely the Netherlands and France.
 
There's a lot of detail here for the listener to absorb, and while narrator Nadia May's pace may be a bit quick at times, it keeps the story flowing. Furthermore, May's diction is superb, and her tone is bell-like in its clarity. Her performance is always expressive, without being overdone, and she renders the odd moment of dry humor well, making this is an accessible history for the general reader.
