[T],despo1ler,2011-02-15T16:07Z,"@ roysandy, try using google, I got several useful web pages just by cut/pasting from your own comment into the search box on google.
 There are plenty of website with guides that tell you every thing you need to know about how to create and seed a torrent, have you tried reading the FAQ for the torrent client you currently use to download with? try visiting the website for the  utorrent client, they have a forum full of advice.
 All you need to do is look for it, dont rely on others to do the work for you."
