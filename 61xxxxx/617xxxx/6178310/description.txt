The hottest roots rock band on the West Coast, The Paladins bring together blues, rockabilly and good old rock \'n\' roll, with tons of energy and some terrific guitar from Dave Gonzales. Minimalist and raw as hell. Includes Good Lovin\', Going Down To Big Mary\'s, Right Track. Released in 1988. \"Bar for bar and beat for beat, there\'s no better band... this lineup is lethal!\"
