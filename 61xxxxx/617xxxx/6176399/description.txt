The Moment It Clicks - Photography Secrets from One of the Worlds Top Shooters.

The book offers a unique triangle of learning, featuring McNallys distillation of important concepts, his images that illustrate techniques, and the inside story of how the shot was taken, including what equipment was used and how readers can set up similar shots.

McNally can be seen discussing images from the book and how he achieved the perfect shot in a video courtesy of Nikon. Readers can also join The Moment It Clicks flickr group to share their great shots and tell the story behind them.
