Weasels Ripped My Flesh is an album by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, released in 1970.

Conceptually, the album could be considered Phase Two of Burnt Weeny Sandwich. Both albums consist of previously unreleased Mothers tracks released after the demise of the original band. Whereas the pieces on Burnt Weeny Sandwich generally have a more rigid and planned feel captured by quality studio equipment, Weasels Ripped My Flesh mostly captures the Mothers on stage, where they employ frenetic and chaotic improvisation characteristic of avant-garde free jazz. The album's infamous closer and title track is nothing more than every player on stage producing as much noise and feedback as they can for two minutes. Interestingly, an audience member is heard yelling for more at its conclusion. The album also contains Don "Sugarcane" Harris's straight-ahead blues violin and vocal performance of "Directly From My Heart to You" (which is actually an outtake from the sessions for the Hot Rats album).

Thank you and enjoy!!
