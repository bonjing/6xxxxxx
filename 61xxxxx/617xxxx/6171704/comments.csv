Darwin says evolution happens slowly over loooong periods of time. S Jay Gould says evolution happens fast, in a short timespan, because of physical trauma. I was hoping this would be something on Gould?
Or is it just more ugly neo-darwinism?"

,Tattybogle,2011-02-13T15:36Z,"""Darwin was wrong"" Hmm...well yes I suppose he was, in the sense that Copernicus was wrong about the exact details of the Universe. He put the Earth firmly around the Sun and not vice versa. I suppose the fact that he did not continue his theory with black holes, the stars being so far away that you can't see them moving or the effects of relativity at light speed does make him ""wrong"" too.

""It's the science, stoopid!"""
,PhiberOptix,2011-02-13T23:52Z,"Tattybogle: and if we cling to old and outdated theories we never move forward.

This video starts with ""Darwin nailed it! He was spot on!"". No he didn't. And no he wasn't. Critical thinking is what leads science forward. Not a gullible ""let's all think alike""-movement. Spare that for the religious..."
,PhiberOptix,2011-02-13T23:53Z,Keep away. This thing is pure neo-darwinism void of any new thoughts.
