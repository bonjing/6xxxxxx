,TheAnt317,2011-02-15T17:26Z,"Well since shaggyyy fucked up and spoiled it, I might as well just put my thoughts in and say I'm so marked out right now. I LOVED the fact that he came back. It was kind of depressing when he said he might be the guest host of Raw on the 500th episode of Smackdown, but this is so much better, especially the line, ""you have my word I will never go away again."" But that makes me wonder just WHAT he means by that. Is he back to wrestling full-time? Part-time? Did he finally realize after 7 years of getting terrible casts for Disney movies that he should've stuck with wrestling? Man I hope so. I can't wait to see The Rock lay the smacketh down on the whole Raw roster. Loved his promo, loved how he still knew how to work the crowd like a pro and I loved how he actually said stuff like ""ass"", ""damn"", ""hell"", and ""sumbitch"" on WWE-PG. I hope this somehow starts their transition out of the PG bullshit again."
