This pro shot bootleg is the same concert as the 'Bat Out of Hell Original Tour' one. And I dare to say this isn't worse to the original release. This bootleg has been out for many years and it's great. It's complete the sound is very good the only real annoying thing is the big timer that's in the screen all the time. Although after a few minutes you won't notice it anymore.
