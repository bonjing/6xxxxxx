I got a few people wanting a version of my original dead space trainer, so I put it up here for download.

Use instructions:

1. Download
2. Use WinRAR or your favorite unpacking program
3. Extract the file
4. Run Dead Space
5. Run the trainer.


NOTE: The trainer will mention a .DLL when you start it up. This is because I made it on TMK which requires a .DLL. You do not need to download it, nor will it inject it.

THERE ARE NO VIRUSES CONTAINED IN THIS TORRENT.

If you complain about AVG picking it up as a virus, get a better AV such as MBAM.

Ok? Enjoy.

If you like the torrent, comment so that others may see it and enjoy it for themselves!
