It's people like you that makes everything think things are viruses. If someone posts a crack before a release is made, it is prob a virus.

If it is a trainer, it will prob show up as a virus because of false positives you fucking moron.

It's called code injection. Learn what the fuck is going on before you even attempt to taint one of my torrent with your moronic slander."

Just started the game as directed and loaded a previous save, THEN the trainer. 

I did enjoy! Thank You!"

Go to your install folder for Dead Space, and then right click on the .exe, and go to properties, and then details. Last time I checked, 1.0.0.222 was the final version."
