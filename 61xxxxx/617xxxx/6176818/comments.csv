till then keep cheking on my virus free torrents for top needed softwares 
!!!!!!Cheers buddy!!!!!!! & do not forget to rate the ""Quality"" ;-)

@ The-Arfen
why should we use an unsafe crack while we can get a geniune & free license?
anyway thanks for your effort :)"
,The-Arfen,2011-02-17T11:08Z,"The key will be blacklisted. 
did you really expect bitdefender to not see the patch as a threat ?

it changes the bitdefender files of course it is a threat.

dummies, it's your loss not mine.
the files are now closed if you want it open then ask.
"
[T],dada_sh,2011-02-17T18:56Z,"@ The-Arfen:

Kindly stop commenting negatively we do not need your crack  
For your info, this is an original active volume license for one year... many others are enjoying it 
The Quality sign (+15) can show clearly the state...
If you don't like to join the happy group 
feel free & quit please"
,dragongator,2011-02-24T06:47Z,"Would you, moaners, will shut up?! The key is genuine, works as it should and there is no probs at all. I even entered this key before downloading program itself - it was accepted and let me download program directly from Bit Def site with updating it at the first run. Thanks dada_sh! Great app."
