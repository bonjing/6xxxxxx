,millsdk,2011-12-06T05:48Z,Works great! Your burner has to support changing the book type to DVD-ROM before burning.. otherwise it won't work. Working great in my '07 Tahoe!
,drthv8r,2011-12-09T05:38Z,"Thank you for the share it works perfect.  I used a Memorex DVD+RDL, ImgBurn that's included in the file to burn the DVD with, and a fairly new Asus DVD Burner set to 2X burn speed.  I have a 2008 GMC 3500 and it updated the old maps without a hiccup."
