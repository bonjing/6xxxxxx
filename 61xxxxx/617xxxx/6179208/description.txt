The word â€˜fallulahâ€™ describes a â€˜fabulous creatureâ€™ and, if we are to take our cues from her debut album The Black Cat Neighbourhood, itâ€™s a rather fitting appellation for the alter ego of Danish singer-songwriter, Maria Apetri. Attempting to settle here the ancient debate over whether the titular creatures are omens of good or no good at all, it is clear why she has chosen these shadowy felines as her musical familiars. The fact that she is, essentially, a pop musician doesnâ€™t mean that she canâ€™t encompass the mystical qualities synonymous with this (in her view) lucky talisman, perhaps using it as a form of protection as she stealthily slinks into view and demands a fuss.
