Resident Evil Extinction

Storyline: The film begins showing Alice (Milla Jovovich)waking at the mansion, in a scene that is almost identical to the one in the first Resident Evil.Alice moves through obstacles including the laser room seen in the first film, though she is eventually killed by an Umbrella weapons system. Her dead body is taken by three scientists,including Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen), and dumped into a pit outside the Umbrella facility. The pit is shown to be filled with numerous Alice Clones. The camera zooms out from the facilities main entrance (the remaining facility being underground) and shows hundreds of zombies trying to enter the facility, which is surrounded by barbed wire fence.
