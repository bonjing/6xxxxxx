Ed Reardon's Week concerns the story of a curmudgeonly 50-something writer described in the show's publicity material as an "author, pipesmoker, consummate fare-dodger and master of the abusive email". 

The central conceits of the comedy are that Ed lives in genteel poverty with his cat, Elgar, scraping a living as a hack by working through commissions for coffee table books such as The Brands Hatch Story and Pet Peeves, a book of celebrity pet anecdotes. Much of this work comes through his agent Felix and Felix's assistant Ping, an archetypal Sloane Ranger who rejects his amorous advances.

Ed teaches a screenwriting class, held weekly at the local sports centre. This adult education group spend a lot of time giving him advice and making comments about his general lack of achievement, between complaints about being forced to watch his Tenko episode. Ed also "plays" in a Dixieland jazz band with his more successful friends, his instrument of choice being the jug. 

Ed has lived in a one-bedroom flat in Berkhamsted ever since he sold his London home after a messy divorce. This is described as "living at the cutting edge, or above The Cutting Edge, to be accurate, a flat over a hairdresser's".


Much humour comes from Ed's rants and inability to stop himself getting carried away in his angry tirades, often triggered by learning that somebody younger than him is proving more successful (such as the author of Eats, Shoots and Leaves, Lynn Truss; one tirade finds Ed receiving several copies of the book as gifts for his birthday and working how much in royalties Truss will have received because of the book sales).
