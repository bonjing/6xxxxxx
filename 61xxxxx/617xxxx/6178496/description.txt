The ribbon (i.e. the toolbar that is displayed in the title bar) can be customized to include the commands you use the most. Simply tap the down arrow to customize the ribbon, or even minimize it when not in use.



Mobile Devices Synchronization:

The synchronization reconciles meals, workout and health data on both your phone and your PC by merging changes, exactly like appointments or contacts with Outlook. This is far more powerful than file synchronization where one set of changes overwrite the others, leading to data loss in synchronization.

VidaOne Diet & Fitness 3 synchronizes with Android, BlackBerry, iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch, Windows Mobile Pocket PC (touch screen), Windows Mobile Smartphone (non-touch screen) and Palm OS mobile handhelds and PDAs, running MySportTraining and/or MyPersonalDiet. Windows Phone 7 will be supported in 2011. 

The synchronization is invaluable if you or your company switches your phone to another model, if your phone is damaged, stolen or lost, or if you upgrade to a new phone. Whatever the situation, you will always have all your workout data safe on your PC, and you can re-synchronize it with another phone. Case in point, some of the very first MySportTraining users (using Pocket PCs back in 1999) have 10 years of workout data on their new iPhone 4G. 

There's just no other software with such a state-of-the-art capability.



"Lightning fast synchronization with my iPhone" - Rick K. 

Note to iPhone users: 

Due to the iPhone connectivity design, the synchronization between VidaOne Mobile and VidaOne Diet & Fitness can only be achieved via Wi-Fi (not via USB cables). 


The iPhone prevents data from being shared among apps, so each VidaOne app must be synchronized with VidaOne Diet & Fitness. Fortunately, the synchronization replicates the data in all apps. 


The synchronization does not affect the normal backup operations done by iTunes. 
Garmin Downloads:

Download workouts recorded from Garmin devices into VidaOne Diet & Fitness to track all the information you need and review maps on Google. And if you are using an iPhone, your workouts and maps are synchronized with MySportTraining and MyPersonalDiet.

You can download workouts via USB from the Garmin Edge 205 & 305, Forerunner 205, 301 and 305. For wireless Garmin devices, you can import TCX activity files.
