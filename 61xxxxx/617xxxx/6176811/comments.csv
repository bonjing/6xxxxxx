,Zylexm,2011-04-07T21:31Z,"You can use the .Cue files to split the tracks. Search for Medievil Cue Splitter for a decent cue splitting program for windows OS, Im not too sure if it works on mac or linux, someone else will have to confirm that."
,bobbers602,2011-05-09T16:56Z,Is this RAP? What GENRE? Whats hardstyle? LMFAO
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-06-08T20:07Z,@bobbers602 hardstyle is almost the same as hard trance

and @ XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX, Hardstyle is NOT, and repeat NOT hard trance :D 2 compleatly different things :) all different bass and melody samples to start with.."
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-06-19T16:41Z,"Noisecontrollers - Gimme Love

WOW! that song is fucking epic"
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-06-19T16:43Z,"and @jerma88 Check out Deepforce's ""Harder"". It's hard trance, but it sounds just like hardstyle. I didn't said that Hardstyle was Hard Trance, because it isn't. It just sound very simmilar. They both share the awesome bass."
,jerma88,2011-06-20T18:22Z,"@ XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX, you're right, they have their similarities in Rithem and Melody :) you can twist and bitch but they are both brilliant :D but prefere hardstyle, just harder in the Bass :D and sorry if i sounded like an ass.. was just super exited with this album :D"
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-06-22T14:46Z,"@jerma88 no man, you did not! it's cool... and yeah they're both awesome"
