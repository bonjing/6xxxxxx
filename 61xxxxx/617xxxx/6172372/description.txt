Michael Einziger, guitarist from the Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum rock band Incubus enters a new realm with the debut of his first original orchestral composition, â€œEnd.>vacuum,â€ at UCLAâ€™s famed Royce Hall on August 23.

The piece consists of nine musical movements (approximately 40 minutes total) and will be performed by a chamber orchestra led by renowned Los Angeles conductor and Einzigerâ€™s longtime collaborator Suzie Katayama.

The piece was inspired by such iconoclastic modern and avant-garde composers as Igor Stravinsky, George Crumb, Samuel Barber, Krzysztof Penderecki and Frank Zappa.

According to Einziger, â€œEnd.>vacuumâ€ makes reference to his perception of the outer edge of human understanding, â€œthe finite place where rational scientific knowledge stops and pure speculation ensuesâ€¦The event horizon between what we know and what we donâ€™t know is what keeps me awake at night, but also gets me out of bed every day.â€

"simply stated, end.>vacuum is a jagged collection of orchestral music i have been writing for the past year. a horrendously turbulent, and at times serene, aural interpretation of complex patterns and geometric shapes that assemble themselves firmly into my consciousness. a 40 minute-long insomnia-induced orchestral anxiety- attack. (sounds like heaven, right?)

under normal circumstances, i play guitar in a band called incubus. but last year i was forced to stop playing for several months due to a wrist injury that required surgery, as well as a time-intensive recovery. without the option of picking up a guitar, it was during that idle time that i began to write music for the orchestra, which became like a musical game of â€˜tetrisâ€™ for me. a huge challenge on both cerebral and intellectual levels. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s any good, either.

rather than record this music and release it as an album, i thought it would be much more risky and fun to for the maiden voyage of â€˜end.>vacuumâ€™ to happen as a live, unedited performance in front of my family, friends, and fans. with all mishaps intact.

the music will be performed in nine movements, by a group of musicians i am calling â€˜the graviton modern ensembleâ€˜. it will be a mixture of professional philharmonic players and friends. throughout the piece, i will play a variety of different instruments (sans guitar) alongside my brother, benjamin einziger, and my good friend blake mills. suzie katayama will be conducting.

to make this event even more heavenly, the first part of the program will consist of a lecture by my friend and esteemed british physicist, dr. brian cox. he is a world-renowned scientist who acts as a science correspondent for the BBC, and is currently conducting monumental research at the large hadron collider at CERN. the large hadron collider is a particle accelerator, and is the most powerful/ complex/expensive machine ever built by humans (google it). his talk will be a discussion on particle-physics and the mind-bending potential for major discoveries at CERN in the near future.

all this could make for an amazing evening at UCLA, or it could be a train-wreck. weâ€™ll all decide that together."
