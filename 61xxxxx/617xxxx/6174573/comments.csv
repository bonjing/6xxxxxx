Leave off all the extra programs - like IDM, fish screensaver, reg clean, winrar, unlocker, etc.

1) Yes, turn on automatic updates.

Make sure that your first boot device is set to your CD/DVD ROM.

Try burning the CD again on another blank CD, if the problem stays the same it might be your CD/DVD ROM drive, or may be RAM, can't really tell.

,jknice,2011-03-08T09:38Z, hi can anyone tell me addons of this windows
,principlemajor,2011-03-08T10:58Z,"
@ elpeluka, No, you don't have to format again and use the march 2011 version when it comes out. The only difference is that when it's match and there are some pdates, those updates will be integrated into the match 2011 edition by the uploader for those who want to download the latest, but since you have already downloaded and installed february version, you only have to go to Microsoft Windows Update website and check for updates.


@jknice, this one has only Recycle bin on the lower righ side of the desktop, you have to place ""My Compute, My DOcuments and My Network places"" unto the desktop."
,jknice,2011-03-08T11:28Z,"@principlemajor ok can you post screenshots of my document and my computer 
and tell me addons "
,principlemajor,2011-03-08T17:24Z,"@ jknice, the hard drive I was installing this windows Xp on got crashed so I don't have screenshots of the installation. I have used the  November 2010 edition before and has only the recycle bin on the desktop (same issue you have to right-click on desktop, choose properties, then under desktop tab, you click on customize desktop, then you choose which items you want (to appear on the desktop), then OK button and then OK button. That's all.

Secondly, this ISO has no addons like Adobe Reader, Mozilla and the rest, you have to download them yourself and install them.
The screenshot links Maherz posted in the torrent description has been blocked and I cant view it anymore.
Don't know whats happening.

Understood?"

2) updates work fine.
3) No, turn on automatic updates and fear nothing ;)
Burn it as an ISO image, not DATA CD! And burn with minimal speed.
Good luck.

,falafokz,2011-09-24T05:57Z,"to those people who tried to download this torrent and having troubles, maybe the problem is not in this torrent. so before you say anything bad, try to think first and resolved the problem. people like maherz who uploads these types of torrent are just trying to help us. help us with the problems we have in our computers. they dont deserve such words like ""ZVENGAR"" says. we are all here to resolved our problems for ""FREE"". these people like maherz is helping us without getting paid. now, if you wanted to fix your problem without having any troubles i suggest you to get the hell out of this site, ride your car, bring your laptop/pc with you, dont forget to bring SOME CASH, and go to the nearest computer technician in you area. learn how to respect other if you nwanted to be respected."
