,123-abc,2011-02-16T22:42Z,Thanks for the upload man - great to get hold of this years WRC action!
,Ropower,2011-02-17T01:37Z,"hmm, audio is a bit crappy but I am glad someone is seeding it"
,rethawro,2011-02-17T17:03Z,"@Brrnout i've got 1080p 5,6Gb version from OneHD, but my thought it's too much, and of course MotorTV. 

BTW there's no difference between OneHD and ESPN, the same team are making tv coverage for ESPN and for OneHD.

I know this sweden review it's kind crappy, i was really upset when i saw what release team made and i hope for next time."

,msh441,2011-02-23T02:07Z,"WRC is dead on the US airwaves.  Boooo!!!

This is GREATLY appreciated.  Please put up Mexico once it's aired the first week of March.  This is the only way us US fans get to watch anymore."
,WRCFan,2011-02-26T09:33Z,If you could upload the MotorTV version also I would love you for ever. I personally like the longer format
,ford_wrc,2011-03-03T04:27Z,Thanks!  I would love to get a HD version if you ever want to u/l it.
