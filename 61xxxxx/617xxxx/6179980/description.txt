There is an excellent torrent containing most of the old books and modules here:

but one of the classic Mystara IMMORTAL level modules - IM1 Immortal Storm #9171 by Frank Mentzer is missing. I found a copy of it, and am just adding this for others looking for a slightly more complete collection. My hope is that someone will include this in one of the mega-packs that occasionally get made.


For those interested, the immortal rule set based on Mystara included a box set, and three published adventures. I've played the scenarios (and thought them to be pretty cool), but apparently not many agreed, since TSR never published any more. Versions 3 and 3.5 introduced the Epic Level characters, which were far more popular. Anyone wanting the entire immortal series should click the above link, and simply add this module to it.
