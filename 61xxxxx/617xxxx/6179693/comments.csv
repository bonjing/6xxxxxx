I wonder though,.. why have 69 people rated this down?"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-27T19:28Z,All the negative votes come from one person who has a particular disliking to me. Ignore it :)
,shubnyg,2011-07-09T19:29Z,Why hardcoded subs ? This sux...
,PonyJL,2012-01-22T15:43Z,:( looking for the korean version. The ending in the international version is missing like 8 minutes and doesnt explain anything.
,Tuppy,2012-04-05T02:35Z,"What a fantastic film, I'm ashamed I've only just watched it a few days ago. Heard about it long ago and had your torrent for almost 5 months.

Also great quality. 
The look of the film and the camerawork just blew me away. thanks

Now, hopefully I can track this down in blu-ray in my area. I need to own this. =)"
