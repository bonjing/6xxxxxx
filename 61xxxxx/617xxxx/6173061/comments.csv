Thank You!!!
Seems to me you're a perfectionist, and it's a nice thing. I got problem with CD 8, Where Are You, the tracks are skipped from track nยบ 4. In other words, at the end of the track there's a little portion of the next track. I corrected manually.  
One again, a nice upload and congratulations for you collection."
