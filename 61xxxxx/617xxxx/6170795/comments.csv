,jimc001,2011-03-02T14:50Z,thank you 10/10. great Quality
,UsedDildo,2011-03-13T07:23Z,"Very good video and audio quality, however every 10 minutes there's a watermark with the words ""property of the weinstein company - do not duplicate"" (in upper case) appear at the top of the screen for 15 seconds.

Didn't stop me watching and enjoying the film, and certainly will not make me rush out and pay for a copy. It's just annoying so i'll keep downloading other torrents of this film until i find one without the watermark.

Thanks again to the uploader for this torrent, it is an excellent film. "

use vobsub. you just have to have the subtitle and video files in the same folder, with the same name. vobsub will automatically join both"
