This is a CD that used to be sold by \"Brian J. Odell\", I think back in about 2000 - 2002, however to the best of my knowledge it is no longer sold by him either at conventions, or anywhere, so here it is for anyone to download and enjoy.

Below is information and description from the exteriod CD Case and the insert inside of it.  Extract all files into the same folder from within the archive, which is in 7zip format, 7zip is a publicly available free program, google \"7zip\" to find it.

For all of you that want to come in and leave comments claiming that jpeg image files can contain viruses (which isn\'t possible any more today), I\'ve included a screen-shot of me scanning the folder and all contents with Avast! current version, as of the time of submitting this torrent, showing no infections.
