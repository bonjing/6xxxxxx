                  The Story Of Rapunzel (1951) F. Harryhausen
                  -------------------------------------------

An adaptation of the classic German fairy tale. In this version, the story starts of with Rapunzel, a beautiful maiden with extraordinarily long yellow hair, imprisoned in a tall tower which had no doors and only one window, by an old witch who had taken her from her true mother long ago as punishment for stealing some radishes from her garden.

Each day when the old witch came to visit the maiden. She would take great care so that no one would see her and then she would yell, \"Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!\". Whereupon Rapunzel let down her long hair down to the witch below through the only window of the tower. 

Then the old witch would cast a magic spell on Rapunzels hair and it would braid itself into a long rope so that the old witch could climb to the top of the tower.
The witch would the spend the whole day with Rapunzel gazing at her beauty.

They lived this way for several years, until at last a wandering prince chanced upon the strange tower. As he stood gazing at the tower from below, he heard some footsteps and quickly hid behind the tower. He saw an old woman approaching, who later yelled \"Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!\", to the window above.

Gazing up he saw the most beautiful maiden he had ever seen in his life. He saw the maiden let down her incredibly long yellow hair that shone like gold in the sun, to the old woman below. He watched the old woman climb to the top using the maidens long hair as a rope.

He waited for the old woman to leave. When the old woman finally left, the prince courageously climb to the top of the tower.
