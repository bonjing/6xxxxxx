,divx7,2011-02-14T12:30Z,HBGary is a security firm that went too far to win contracts and gain publicity. I have no sympathy for a security vendor that fails to protect itself.
,mqleads,2011-02-14T20:13Z,"Your letter contains too much emotion. You're not a cold-hearted, calculating b***ard like HBGary's clique.
And I feel you're showing your cards too much. You need to be a little more reserved and keep your hand closer to your chest.
I'd like to offer my help in curating any other letters you want to drop. 
Here to help."

,bluecar5556,2011-02-22T05:46Z,"Wikileaks, Legitimate Whistleblowers or CointelPro?
You have to ask yourself, is the information that is 'leaked' hurting or helping the government? Also ask the question, if Wikileaks is indeed a CIA front, if you were infact a whistleblower and went straight to wikileaks, you have essentially been led to the honeypot just as a bee is to a flowers nectar. All I am doing is asking questions, not drawing lines in the sand so please keep that in mind.
