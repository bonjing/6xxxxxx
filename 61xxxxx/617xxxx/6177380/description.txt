           Following an Irish immigrant carpenter from coastal            
           Queens to the Catskills and beyond, this film is an            
           American existential portrait that explores the gulf           
           between the idea of a thing and the thing itself. Having       
           set off to the New York countryside to construct a             
           reproduction of the earliest of American cape houses, the      
           protagonist, an Irish immigrant carpenter, finds himself       
           overcome by an inexplicable fatigue. Debts and                 
           expectations mount alongside the crudest and most naive        
           of deceptions, that of both self and family. As                
           exaggerations become lies, the chasm grows and the             
           Builder finds himself confronted by the unnerving              
           ambivalence of the world around him.
