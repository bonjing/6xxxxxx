From the Publisher
A new edition of this highly-successful text! As it has for the past quarter-century, Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory offers students a complete and comprehensive study of the electronic devices and circuits they need to understand for success on the job. The authors take a systems approach to their subject, covering topics in a "building block" fashion that ensures students comprehend fundamental concepts such as diodes and transistors before they tackle such advanced topics as compound configurations, power supplies, and oscilloscopes. For each device examined, the text covers most configurations and applications. Included are discussions of the full range of related topics typically addressed in the course, with clear, precise explanations and plenty of examples to back them up. A color format highlights and defines important concepts, while line drawings present circuits and devices as they appear in the "real world."
