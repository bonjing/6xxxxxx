Description

The easiest way to keep a journal or diary on your Mac. Saving your memories and returning to them has never been so enjoyable before.


âœ” Simple and beautiful.

Our goals: no useless features and an easy-to-use, gorgeous interface. Begin writing your journal right away instead of searching help files.

âœ” Secure journals.

Your personal diary is safe from prying eyes â€” just set a password for your journal, and MÃ©moires will encrypt it.

âœ” Forever yours.

Industry standard SQLite database-driven file format means that there is no vendor lock-in. Plus you can export your journals to RTF, plain text, or PDF.


âœ” Browse or quickly search entries.

Browse using calendar or view all entries in one list. You can also use instant search to find entries you want to read or edit.

âœ” Spelling and grammar.

Spot and fix spelling and grammar mistakes on the fly or use automatic correction. Smart quote and dash substitutions will make your entries beautiful.

âœ” Quick drawings.

Just like in a paper journal, the new Quick Drawing feature allows you to draw sketches, doodles, or anything you like right inside MÃ©moires.


âœ” Full screen editing.

Now you can focus on writing your journal entries without distractions, because MÃ©moires comes with full screen editing.

âœ” Autosave.

MÃ©moires automatically saves your journals every 5 minutes and before closing, so you wonâ€™t lose a bit. The program is fully compatible with Time Machine for seamless backups.

âœ” Diary printing.

You can print a single entry, entries for a specified period or the whole journal. The program automatically inserts dates and titles where needed.
