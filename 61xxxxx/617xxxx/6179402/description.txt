BT Technology Journal - All issues 1997 to 2009 - MYRIAD

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MYRIAD WAREZ presents the last 11 years of the telecoms corp's own journal

The BT Technology Journal is a journal where BT employees and others publish
papers on different aspects of information and communications technology.
BT in case you didn't know, used to be known as 'British Telecom' and were
the telecoms monopoly in the United Kingdom. Currently they are no longer
a state monopoly but exploit their dominant market position and defy regulators
to cheat and abuse their customers, in particular by (illegal) collusion
between the branch that controls most of the copper network, and the branch 
that retails phone and Internet services to consumers. Not content with 
making piles of money fleecing the millions of people too ignorant, apathetic
or confused to understand that they can switch their landline from BT to other
companies, they conspire to degrade and undercut the services offered by all 
other phone companies and ISPs.

THEY ARE SCUM. Don't get me started on what they have done to public payphones.

Having said that, this journal is an interesting read. In the past it was an
information treasure trove for UK hackers and phreakers, who used it to pick
up all the BT jargon they needed for pretexting and social engineering, as well
as discover just what BT were up to and all the new and exciting corners of the
PSTN. These days it has a few more articles that are either corporate fluff or
loose speculation about 'the future' of communications, often in collaboration
with so-called researchers at once respectable universities. However there is 
still plenty of real technical information. This journal will allow you to get
inside the mindset of BT from their research divisions to their corporate
services and POTS telco operations. Be sure to check out the invaluable 'List 
of acronyms' sections that appear every few issues.

A must for all telecoms enthusiasts as well as hackers, phreakers, spies,
social engineers, explorers, trainspotters and plain old BT haters. Enjoy.
