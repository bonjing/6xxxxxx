Storyline: The film deals with the situation of British prisoners of war during World War II
who are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway. Their instinct is to
sabotage the bridge but, under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that
the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit and dignity in adverse
circumstances. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather
than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese commandant Saito. He is an
honorable but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive. He convinces
himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to
himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with
the enemy. Unknown to him, the Allies have sent a mission into the jungle, led by Warden and
an American, Shears, to blow up the bridge.
