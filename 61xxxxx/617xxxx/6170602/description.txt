http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481598/

An infection which appears to be caused by a bacteria in the water turns out to be more. A fourteen-year-old student, Dannie, feels 

the real cause is linked to her recurring dreams. When the infection reaches an epidemic level. it becomes clear that this infection 

not only kills, but restores the body to a minimally functioning state where the infected become the "living-dead". This unique twist 

on the classic zombie theme, centers around the highly-intuitive Dannie Jacobs and a group of four other middle school students who 

try to save their friends, their town and themselves in spite of the odds against them. While they are desperately trying to find an 

answer before it's too late, they meet researcher Sue who may hold the key to the infection and Dannie's dreams.

Emily Hagins is making a zombie movie. It's feature-length, it's bloody, and the zombies don't run. Just like it should be. But
