Enjoy."
,blackskyshining,2011-02-14T07:59Z,How long are the minisodes? A couple of them are very large files
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-14T11:35Z,"The files are large because some of them are 1080p and some are blu-ray. I didn't mention it in the title because not all files are like that and I didn't want to mislead anyone. To be honest, the 1080p and blu-ray files are no better quality than the DVDrips I used for the first 2 seasons. All files will work on all PC's and all TV's. You don't need a HD set to watch them. "
,anydamnuser,2011-02-14T21:13Z,"Does anyone know where to find the order of the extras?
I would like to watch this again with the extras in the right place between episodes."
,marko.nastic,2011-03-10T01:47Z,seed please
,falvebarm,2011-03-21T06:39Z,"Am I the only one to notice that Season 3, Episode 4 has the wrong audio?  Yes, somehow the audio in S3E4 is the same audio track from Season 3, Episode 3.  I'd be interested to know how this could have accidentally happened.  

I haven't checked yet to see if there are any other messed up files."
,SHRUDE,2011-03-24T11:24Z,"Subtitles would be nice.

there is a whole bunch of dialogue in spanish S3/E3 that would be nice to know what they are discussing!"
,falvebarm,2011-03-24T13:27Z,"Shrude, you need to get .srt files that correspond to the .avi files you using.  I got my .srt files at
http://www.anysubs.com/movie_details.php?movie_id=6597&season=0"
,SHRUDE,2011-03-25T03:14Z,"@falvebarm
Thanks but < i had a look there.. couldnt find anything corresponding to this torrent.

I'm downloading another full series which has all the foreign languages hardcoded subtitles.
All too hard with this torrent.. s3 e4 wrong audio .. etc."
,falvebarm,2011-03-25T05:10Z,"Don't know what to tell you, Shrude, other than the .srt files I got off of AnySubs.com worked perfectly with the .avi files I got from this torrent.  You must rename the .srt file to the exact name of the .avi file or it won't work.  

The ONLY problem I've found with this torrent (so far) is the S3E4 vid somehow had S3E3 audio."
,chriscoon,2011-04-08T05:09Z,Thanks dude! This is a great download! Excellent quality. Hard English subtitles would be appreciated for the Mexican scenes though. My program won't recognize any subtitles so we don't know what they say. Hard English subs are always good!
,opticus,2011-04-22T11:52Z,"S03-E03 alot of foreign language with no subs
S03-E04 wrong audio, some other episode or whatever.
after this I did not watch any more of this season from this.
S1 and S2 is good"
,y3n007,2011-04-25T09:52Z,"To all of you who are bitching like little girls about S3E4 specially the one person who even said he did not watch anymore of the episodes, this is a very easy fix, look for the one file that is wrong from a different source and re download it, stop being a bunch of little bitches, the other easy solution, grab your wallet and go to the store, like Target or any store that sells DVD series and buy the freaking DVD.....Fucking A man!!!!! have some respect IMBD did a great job by facilitating this show to us for free and you still bitch because one file is wrong?, thank for the upload awesome job...."
,Coldblackice,2011-04-28T08:14Z,"y3n007 -- very valid points and I concur, but you epic fail on commenting that ""IMDB"" is to thank for uploading. Toilet_sniffer would be the more appropriate person.

,dank_plant_grower,2011-04-29T18:05Z,"Sweet, only place I've found the minisodes in one place, awesome upload. Thanks Toilet Sniffer"
,nastrudamus,2011-05-03T13:34Z,"thx for putting this together! really appriciate it. one of my favorite shows.. And to all you complaing. there are subs on the internett no prob. or just ask your mexican friend or something if you got one though:) once again, thx dude..! :) "
,nittany,2011-05-15T06:22Z,No hard coded English subs?  Fail.....nobody wants to fuck with .srt files.
,KevMovieMan,2011-05-25T23:15Z,"To all those whining about subs... in Real Life, while listening to another person speak a different language u do not gets subtitles... Breaking Bad is a RL based show... so it makes sense not to have subs... this show isn't based in china where everyone is speaking different... watch the show, watch/listen to the situation and figure it out for urselves morons... nice torrent btw srry 2 clog, hope A/V is good"
,TechnoMax,2011-05-27T20:47Z,"thanks a lot to the uploader and all the seeders, what an amazing show, glad to have caught up with it in time for Season 4 :)"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-06T01:35Z,"I've done a new Blu-ray rip for anyone who's interested. It has subtitles too.

,falselight666,2011-07-13T02:59Z,"Thanks for the upload, it's much appreciated, i have the Australian region 4 DVD of season 3 and it's missing 4 of the commentaries that are found on the region 1 DVD, Ep. 1 - No Mas, Ep. 5 - Mas, Ep. 10 - Fly, Ep. 13 - Full Measure, i think it's missing a few other extras too but i'm not sure, can someone please upload some mp3's of these missing commentaries, i really want to listen to these before i start watching the 4th season. I'd be eternally grateful, thanks again!!"

,dispatch88,2011-07-31T07:14Z,"the audio for (Breaking Bad Season 3 Episode 05 - Mas.avi) is playing the audio for the previous episode.  Also, are there subs for S03 E04?  The first ten minutes or so is all in Spanish and I have no idea what they're saying."
,jenms1983,2011-07-31T14:35Z,"The minisodes say they are MKV files and try to open in Windows Live Movie Maker, but can't be watched in the program. How can I open the files so I can actually watch the minisodes?? Thanks..."
,kludge420,2011-08-03T07:02Z,"@y3n007

Hey, dumbfuck. You comments for expressly for discussing problems right? If you are too fucking stupid to understand such a simple fucking concept you should probably kill yourself and save everyone the trouble of dealing with your stupid ass.

Fucking retard."
,loffi84,2011-08-30T14:25Z,How can this torrent be so slow?
,lostspoil,2011-09-16T00:25Z,yay! thx so much!
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-10-10T18:26Z,"I've done a new torrent with season 4 included.

,therash3,2011-10-10T22:31Z,Thanks so much Toilet!
,dinkie,2011-11-01T00:14Z,"Where are the subtitles?

Does anyone else have working subs? Ive tried all subs found on the first page of google for s3e3 and none work.

Ridiculous of the torrent maker stating that the subs were hard coded, when they were not."
,depassp,2011-11-21T20:51Z,There is a problem with S03E04. The audio is from S03E03...
,honunet,2011-12-21T08:28Z,you cant burn M4V files to Dvd though correct?
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-04T06:28Z,"s3e3 had a problem, I've done a new one with it fixed, it also has season 4. There's a link a couple of posts up or click on my username.  "
