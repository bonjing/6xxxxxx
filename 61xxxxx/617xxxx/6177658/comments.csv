,hauntnut,2011-05-22T08:31Z,"Please be more accurate in your posting about the source for ""Bad Boys II"". This movie is not out on Blu-Ray, and the aspect ratio is an HDTV ratio, which is where this file sourced from originally. "

,coolswitch,2011-08-13T00:06Z,"@sparky

I agree. Lots of people comment without thinking. And in the end, you'd know they they don't know anything"
,twb23,2011-11-20T23:08Z,use VLC if you are on a mac to watch MKV's

,desi_superhero,2011-12-09T20:46Z,"Commenting about the torrent's inaccuracies isn't ""bitching"" but sharing your experience to help others make the choice whether to download or not. 
Bad Boys A/V=7/8 out of 10.
Bad Boys II A/V=7/5 out of 10. It is clearly a DVD upscale and not blu ray rip. Yes, this title is not out on Bluray yet. Even in China.
Thanks for Bad Boys. :)
But, you should have uploaded Bad Boys II with source name and not claimed 'Bluray' as the source."
,NuNu12,2012-01-22T01:09Z,"Beautiful work, thank you so much!

Bad Boys I
A: 10
V: 9 (the video pixelates once about half way into the movie. Other than it, it's perfect!)

Bad Boys II
A: 9 (sound is just a little low so just turn up the volume)
V: 9 (I agree with desi_superhero; the video is not bluray quality. However, it's pretty darn clear!)"
