This 2003 concert from England is made up of 2 sets, the first a pared down acoustic set of vintage blues material, the second a rocking electric set combining blues tracks, Splinter Group originals and Fleetwood Mac classics. Special bonus features include an interview with The Splinter Group, a European Tour film, Juke Box, discography and promo video for "Real World."

Split into two halves, this concert from 2003 features former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green and his Splinter Group performing both an acoustic and electric set. After leaving Fleetwood Mac, Green went through a well documented personal decline, but has re-emerged stronger than ever with the able backing of his backing band, Splinter Group. This concert features a stunning rendition of Fleetwood Mac's "Albatross," as well as a selection of Splinter Group originals, and other covers. 
The disc is in anamorphic widescreen with a fine Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.
