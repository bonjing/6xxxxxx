Kudos to Eaglesmith for never standing still, musically. You can bet his large and loyal fan base would be happy to hear more of the rowdy roadhouse roots rock of old, but he's moving on. His previous album, Tinderbox, had a strong gospel flavor and here he comes up with a spooky, noir-ish sound that also defies easy categorization. Think of it as a soundtrack for a David Lynch film, while Johnny Dowd is another reference point. A new sonic component here is the prominent female backing vocals of Eaglesmith protÃ©gÃ©s the Fabulous Ginn Sisters. Their sweet, yet haunting, voices contrast nicely with Eaglesmith's typically gruff, convincing vocals on songs like the sinister "Tricks" and "Gone Too Long." A Spanish guitar propels "Careless," while "Sliver Of The Moon" has a '50s pop vibe befitting the romantic lyrics ("A secret on the wind, stars blinking above, I've done it once again, I've fallen in love."). "Rebecca Street" is a lovely, sad ballad, while "I Would" has an upbeat feel boosted by jaunty keyboards and call-and-response vocals. Eaglesmith's production is suitably sparse, and is neatly captured by the mixing work of long-time cohort Scott Merritt. Chalk up another winning entry in a discography now encompassing 18 albums, and one with few peers.
