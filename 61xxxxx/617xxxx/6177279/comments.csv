,walktheword,2011-02-16T10:15Z,"justalife the link does not work for some reason if you click it on the page, but it you copy it and paste it on a new browser window then it works.

For MANTESH: All of your picture links are like that: they work but not when clicked from the page, only when they are copy/pasted. Can you fix that please?"
