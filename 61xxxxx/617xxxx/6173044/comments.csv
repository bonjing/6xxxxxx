,allanathotmale,2011-02-14T04:48Z,many thanks!
,unogazzy,2011-02-14T05:41Z,it's the 10th episode not 11th
,maolain,2011-02-14T06:05Z,"I'm confused with the past few episodes, the numbers seem to be running into each other..."
,Flurren,2011-02-14T06:16Z,great torrent as always! I raise my cup o' rum for our fellow pirate eztv and says a big ARRR!
,rancidpunk,2011-02-14T07:26Z,"Guys, it's because they are counting ''road to the north pole'' as 2 episodes."
,r0tt3n,2011-02-14T08:02Z,"Yup, this is mislabelled,  This ep is actually 9x10 acorrding to...

thetvdb - goo dot gl slash jrGg9
tv.com - goo dot gl slash AWe2B

Interesting note - if you count the x-mas ep twice, you should count the opener as double too, which would make this ep 12 (as wikipedia shows).  Either way, 11 is wrong lol - goo dot gl slash A9R45"

,holyfool,2011-02-14T08:32Z,molte thanx!!!  you're great as always!
,aldebaran91,2011-02-14T13:48Z,"i just dont get it its called comedy show
family guy sucks now almost as bad as that stupid american dad"
,Ziho,2011-02-14T14:21Z,You are confused because episode 1 and episode 7 are double time episodes. And some people like to call episode 7 for episode 7+8 because its an hour long episode. If it was so then this episode should be called episode 13 because of ep. 1 allso was an hour long episode. Hopefully it answers your qustion
,supersteve2345,2011-02-14T22:57Z,So when is The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair gonna air the episode list eztv has been using is messed up 
,_subzer0_,2011-02-15T08:43Z,According to EPGuides website this should be episode 10 with episode 11 airing feb 20th.
,poonerrooter,2011-02-15T09:16Z,Thanks ppl never ever downloaded anything before 
,Tamarind777,2011-02-15T14:40Z,"Family Guy is not as funny as it used to be. Macfarlane is using it as a platform to promote his political views. I understand that many shows have been successful doing just that, but it began as great comedy, now it's just getting so stupid."
,RDawgg,2011-02-15T21:41Z,"someone fucked up the titles and named episode 7 s09e0708 and episode 8 was s09e09 
so,yeah
but thanks anyway :P"
,ipfree549,2011-02-16T10:37Z,"@Tamarind777
I totally agree with you! Family guy isn't that great anymore, its always ""Oh My God"" this and that. In the Christmas special, the only part I found really amusing was when Stewie and Brian were trying to deliver the presents to the first house. That bit was the only good piece in my opinion. "
,supersteve2345,2011-02-16T23:42Z,I prefer American dad now I cant really stand how unfunny Family guy is now
,CainUAC23,2011-02-19T08:19Z,"for all those who have, and are thinking about commenting about ""boohoo family guy isn't funny anymore"" THEN DON'T COMMENT.  holy crap, its one thing to not like something, its a completely retarded other thing to waste your breath crying about it.  if you don't like it, then why did you put the effort into searching it???  someone is in denial.  If you don't like it, DON'T SEARCH FOR IT, omg, i know right? what an idea that is lol."
,CainUAC23,2011-02-19T08:21Z,"oh and btw, yes this is the wrong episode listing, it is Episode 10, has been said before, and has been explained, hopefully, people will READ instead of look dumb after posting ""WRONG EPISODE Q.Q""

but that aside, THANKS EZTV for yet another great upload, keep up the good work, here's a box of kudos."
,morrillo,2011-02-23T21:34Z,YOU FUCKING IDIOTS STOP COMPLANING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF EPISODE YOU ARE NOT HELPING NOBODY JUST DOWNLOAD IT WATCH IT AND HAVE FUN IM SICK OF YOU ALL BITCHES 
,tonyromano777,2011-04-21T07:14Z,Thx :-)
,harryham1,2011-04-28T22:24Z,"Just a note (please spread this around if you agree):
1- People that use capitals because you are angry (and exclamations for that matter) stop.
2- People that are this angry and say stuff like ""THEN DON'T COMMENT"", ""waste your breath crying about it"", ""YOU FUCKING IDIOTS"", then calm down and take your own advise and don't ""waste your breath..."" because we don't want to hear it and the only one ruining the comments section is you.
3- people are entitled to their opinions
4- I can't stand it when people say stuff like ""family guy sucks now almost as bad as that stupid american dad"". You ARE entitled to your opinion but it is opinion not FACT (not listening to my own advice with the capitals)
5- I am not ""wasting [my] breath"" here because I think this will do the comments section a huge favour.
6- For Christ's sake, were 'pirates', and last time I checked (that felt dumb; I've never checked) pirates don't fight each-other, but too high prices and channels who don't listen to their writer's advise and make things partially free/cheaper (such as Fox)
7- I am not going to do 'Ten Commandments' so go F*ck yourself if you want more, or better yet write more"
