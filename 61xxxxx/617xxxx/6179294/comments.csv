,johndillinger1932,2011-02-17T05:58Z,"unless you have perrgurdian or something to that effect DO NOT download this...Activision monitors torrents of their games and your ISP will get a copyright infringement notice which they will pass to you..Be smart...cover your tracks...
get peer guardian for windows or Moblock for linux users..."
