The Blue and the Gray

"After spending another Valentine's Day alone, Moe attends a seminar led by Dr. Kissingher in the hopes of gaining more confidence with women. Moe takes the doctorâ€™s advice and asks Homer to be his wingman, but Moe becomes distraught when women are drawn to Homer as well. Meanwhile, Marge discovers her first gray hairs and surprises both her family and the neighborhood by going completely gray and sporting a brand new mature hairdo, but Bart is not humored when the neighborhood kids tease him about Margeâ€™s look. Later, Marge confronts Homer when she learns that he is becoming increasingly popular with the young ladies, but Homer helps Marge realize that he only has eyes for her and proves that love is still in the Springfield air."
