BBC Natural World 2011 A Tiger Called Broken Tail HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Broken Tail was the most flamboyant tiger cub Colin Stafford-Johnson had seen during many years spent filming India's wild tigers. After leaving his sanctuary and going on the run, Broken Tail survived for almost a year where many said it was impossible, in the unprotected badlands of rural Rajasthan. Tracking Broken Tail's extraordinary journey, Colin and his soundman Salim piece together the cub's final days and, through Broken Tail's story, uncover stark truths about India's last wild tigers.
