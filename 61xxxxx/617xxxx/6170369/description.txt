Sweet Lullaby gained a lot of airplay in the UK when released - Bob Harris played it repeatedly on his show. This resulted in three UK tours which were very well received. After their first semi acoustic album the band opted for a much more electric, heavier sound which paid off. 

Stewboss display their love for and pride of American musical heritage on their sleeves and manage to combine all kinds of styles into something unique. Highly melodic, honest, strong - this is music which grabs you. 

The album kicks off with three stone cold classics - "Counting To 7 At Your Old Bar Stool" (Fantastic), "I Hope You Miss Me" (Better) and the title track which for me as a Brit just oozes everything that attracted me to American music in the first place - a lovely tune, an atmosphere that has USA all over it and that only a band from the States could come up with and a natural relaxed feel. Perfect. 

"The Midnight Shift" is another true story this time about a couple struggling to keep together whilst working different shifts at the same factory and never having time for a relationship. A shuffle rhythm and harmonica throughout work brilliantly. 

"If You Were Mine" aches as much as it`s title suggests and "The Moonlight And Me" is very strong. "A Little Goes A Long Way" is completely different having fuzz guitar and a garage band feel. 

If "Up That Wrinkled Street" had been written by an established artist it would have been rightly hailed as a masterpiece telling of a young man (Sarfaty) returning to his childhood home and seeing a photo of himself as a child and reflecting on the loss of innocence and youth. Lovely. 

"Let`s Go To Texas" just belts along - a true rocker and it tumbles along in a demented way. 

The albums other tracks are of as high a quality. Un-missable.
