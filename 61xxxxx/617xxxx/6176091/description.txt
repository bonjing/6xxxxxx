Ive been listening to this album for seventeen years or more and I never tire of the creativity of the guitar playing, the excellent vocals and great numbers. Johnny Winter seems to prove with this album that a great artist can get even better with the experience gained from years of practising thier art. The interplay of the musicians is always dynamic and the album retains a live feel with no apparent overdubing of guitar tracks. The riffs and grooves sound authentic in a blues sense but with the added johnny Winter brand of passion and energy. But it is with the soloing that his evolution as a guitarist seems most highlighted. He seems able on this album to produce an almost endlessy creative flow of articulate musical phrases as if hes drawing on the vocabulary of a guitar language he has spoken fluently for years which I suppose he has. For me listening to this album is always an uplifting experience with the great playing and singing and there seems to be a subtle humour throughout also. This album rocks.
