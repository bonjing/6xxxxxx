,mradoby,2011-02-14T17:49Z,"@azza1969: It is more than OK. Contains a mix of formats. Mainly epub as the info says, but also some txt, pdf, lit and others. Go back and get all the previous torrents in the series, now! Remember to seed. I registered to be able to answer you, and to be able to say this:

Thank you for a great series of torrents, dear Anonymous! "
