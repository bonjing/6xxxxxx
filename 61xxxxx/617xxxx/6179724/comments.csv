,vivatpb5776,2011-04-03T04:43Z,"Okay, I have mixed emotions about this download. On the positive side, the quality is much clearer than the version that I currently have. Additionally, this version is wide screen whereas my version is full screen.

On the negative side, the file extensions are .mkv. Even though some people swear by this file format, it is not the most common nor is it the most popular. By far .avi and .mp4 file formats are more popular than .mkv file extensions.

This all being said, I found an application that may be able to cleanly convert the .mkv files into .mp4 or .avi. It's called simply MKV Converter. If it works, ad if each season is in this format, I will just convert the entire series into a format that I want.

Overall, the quality is excellent and I am glad that I found a higher quality version of this series. Thank you uploader."

,tuneraider_uk,2011-06-23T20:22Z,Meech you are a top man. Thanks for these uploads I have been looking for these for ages. The quality is great. will seed thanks again.
,myhandle,2011-08-19T02:58Z,These are great rips. I wish more people took the time to do high quality x264 rips like this. The only way it could be better is if you included any special features (do the discs have commentary tracks?)
,BadboyJay55,2011-08-19T05:48Z,"Such a great show and quality, how the fuck does this have 3 negatives? Thank you so fucking much Meech, seriously, thank you."
,riplikethat,2011-08-22T23:18Z,"Finished watching the first season with this rip.

Excellent rip. This is how you do a good rip you other cunts out there. Not a 350MB shit for 15"" CRT screens."
,JPPanama,2011-08-28T01:16Z,"Meech, you fucking rock."
,impala63rag,2011-09-25T06:04Z,"Thanks for the upload, Great show, just finished watching every season consecutively through your uploads, good quality, fast downloads, and subtitles. I was very impressed with the show. The only bad thing about it is that now I've seen em all and am gonna have a hard time finding another series that can compare. (although ""The Wire"" was a good comparative series)"
,ozziman,2011-10-25T06:36Z,How do i turn the subtitles off? Thanks for the effort mate. Cheers. 
,rippervanwinkle,2011-11-02T14:18Z,"Excellent rips.  The video is h.264, much better than xvid, audio is untouched AC-3 from the DVD, and there are srt subtitles in the mkv container as well, which any player can toggle on or off.

Anyone whining about the mkv container, or anything at all in the case of meech's The Shield rips, is being ignorant.  If you want soft, blocky xvid then look elsewhere. If you want video that looks and sounds exactly like the DVD then this is it.  Big thanks to the ripper/releaser, great job."
,bill1874,2011-11-22T04:04Z,"Hi meech,
Thank you for these excellent quality downloads of seasons 1 to 7 of The Shield.  Thank you also for posting your comments on The Shield torrent uploaded by Toilet_sniffer_V here on tpb.  Your comments caused me to download the first episode of your and his torrents.  No comparison.  Yours rock.  His do not.  Thank you for the heads up and thank you for the uploads.
Sincerely, Bill"
