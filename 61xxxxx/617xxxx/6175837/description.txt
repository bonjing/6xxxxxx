These are the HBGary emails originally downloaded from HBGary's servers by Anonymous.  With them are the instructions for reading them.  They are compressed with 7-zip LZMA and LZMA2 formats to reduce their size to roughly half of the originals.  Decompressed, they are the exact same as the rar version.
If you doubt me, feel free to download both versions and compare for yourself while leaving a comment for the rest of us.

Props go to Anonymous!

Stay tuned for the Greg e-mails next!
