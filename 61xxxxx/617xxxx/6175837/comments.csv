ppp-70-252-136-155.dsl.ksc2mo.swbell.net


i was in for the lulzez.

hbgary and fbi blacksuits will come after you and guantanamo will be your new dwelling place. say hello to gitmo candidate bradley, will ya."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-15T12:32Z,"I know you were in.  You've been in since the first torrent.  Not sure if you were bouncing off the connection with the d-link DIR-615 or if it was yours, but nice work.  So, you the one listed in DC or Frankfurt? :P 'Cause you weren't the only one poking around my network today."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-15T12:36Z,PS port 1194; nice work on the VPN connection.
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-15T13:44Z,"BTW, thank you for the VPN idea and one of the most fun Valentine's Day's I've had in a while.  I enjoyed watching some of your exploits and payloads while trying to backhack a little.  Didn't know if you screenshotted my note before you logged out, but happy belated Valentine's Day.  If you ever want to chat, let me know.  You probably know how to reach me by now; but if not, I'll keep watch over the torrent and here."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-15T23:50Z,I know I need to learn more.  Now where did I put that manual?  ()  (
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-16T10:51Z,"Anyhow, sorry I missed your call whoever.  Well, technically it was my call too with how you routed it. :P  But you called me at precisely the wrong moment.  But thanks for calling back and letting me know you know quite a bit more about my life here.  Feel free anytime.
See, this is the stuff I wish I could learn; well, that combine with how to remove some of my past rantings from this page.  >_"
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-17T10:11Z,"Hmm, it would seem that people downloading this all over the place are getting hacked.  I setup 3 test nodes and someone keeps trying to hack all 3.  So then, it would seem that someone is taking this 7-zip option personal.  Yeesh, I almost couldn't remote into this darn thing without blocking a few ports and programs.  BTW, what do you do when an ISP blocks proxies, private DNS servers and VPNs?  Time to pay RoadRunner a little service call."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-18T04:51Z,"I hate to tell you this, but you've tipped your hand."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-18T10:17Z,"*Yawn*  Nice fucktard, you just took down some random dude's computer.  What next?  So much for being the ""good guy"" right?"
,bluecar5556,2011-02-18T21:21Z,"There is a book named, ""Behold a Pale Horse"" by William Cooper which can be found here at thepiratebay /torrent/4051182 This man had insider knowledge at the very top of U.S. intelligence then the third and final assassination attempt was successful just as he predicts immediately after publishing this book. "
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-02-18T23:06Z,"Ah yes, he was reportedly killed in a shoot-out with ""law enforcement"".  Whether or not it was actually the case remains unknown.  American police are renown for falsifying reports; I can only imagine what they would do under pressure."
