                           NCIS - The Lost Pilot



O.k.. It was not lost. But originally aired in another TV-series.
This is the actual pilot for the successful series NCIS composed from two episodes. After the concept and characters had been formally introduced in these two introductory episodes during season 8 of the TV-series JAG, Leroy Jethro Gibbs and his team were finally ready to start a series of their own. In October 2003 the two episodes were edited together and aired as 'NCIS - The Beginning'.
However, this torrent includes the two JAG-episodes as aired on TV.

It's fun to see Gibbs, Tony, Abby and Ducky getting down to investigative business as much younger versions of themselves. Also there was a female part played by Robyn Lively. For the actual Spin-Off she was later replaced by Sasha Alexander, who filled the second female team spot for 2 seasons to be finally replaced by Cote de Pablo. Since then Siva (Cote de Pablo) has been faithful to the series with only a few episodes absence.

Just lean back and travel back in time to see how it all began!
