Just watched it and had to keep rewinding on the DVR to listen again to some scenes - if anyone can grasp the full scope of what is being said after just one viewing then I would be inclined to think they are full of sh*t.

It's a mesmerizing story and Samuel L Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones don't let you down. A very simple setup of two men in a room, each trying to convince the other of what to believe in. Or what not to believe in.

It's very much a juxtaposition about philosophy and religion, and truth vs faith. At times, depending on what you believe, it felt like God having a debate with Lucifer. At other times it felt as if God were speaking to Tommy's character. Yet again, there times when it felt as though Lucifer were speaking to Samuel's character.

The story is about finding meaning in life, having hope, faith, and joy in and within your fellow man. Is there a purpose? Is death the finality of all? Is everlasting life joyous or is it damning?

In the end, it seems as though one argument wins out over the other. One certainly seems beaten down and full of despair, but it also ends with questions, hope, and faith.

There's no finality to the story; much like life, and the end of life, we just don't have the answers to all the questions we have. But you still have a choice on how to live that life. Will you be hopeful, inquisitive, joyous, celebratory? Or will you be pessimistic, cynical, sad, and ultimately unhappy? "
