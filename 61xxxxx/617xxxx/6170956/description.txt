Plot:

Is becoming a woman analogous, in some deep psychological way, to becoming a werewolf?
Ginger is 16, edgy, tough, and, with her younger sister, into staging and photographing scenes
of death. They've made a pact about dying together. In early October, on the night she has her
first period, which is also the night of a full moon, a werewolf bites Ginger. Within a few days,
some serious changes happen to her body and her temperament. Her sister Brigitte, 15, tries
to find a cure with the help of Sam, a local doper. As Brigitte races against the clock,
Halloween and another full moon approach, Ginger gets scarier, and it isn't just local
dogs that begin to die.
