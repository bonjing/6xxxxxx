If you want people to support your server cost and whatnot you might want to try giving them something they don't already have from elsewhere.  Here's a hint:  so far as my search revealed no one else has uploaded the HD version of this show on TPB.  I clicked on the VTV version of this file 'cuz it already had 1000+ seeders by the time I got here.  yours has 1 and really, what's the point at this point?  Bring us HD and be clicked upon!  Otherwise you torrents die."
