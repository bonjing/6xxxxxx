"The Final Nail"

Castle and Beckett find themselves on 
opposite sides of the case when Castle's 
old school friend (guest star Jason Wiles) 
emerges as the prime suspect in his own 
wife's murder. As they work to solve the 
crime, Castle comes to realize that one of 
two terrible things must be true : Either 
Detective Beckett is about to arrest an 
innocent man for murder, or his old friend 
is a cold-blooded killer.

Enjoy :)
