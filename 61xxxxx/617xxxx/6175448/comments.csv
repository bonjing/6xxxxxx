Care to explain?"
[T],ct420,2011-02-15T09:32Z,"it's rared because most releases such as this are shared first on IRC or Usenet where rar makes sense.  Many scene release groups such as DIMENSION require that their members post in rar format.

So, what you should be wondering is why so many bit torrent posters bother to unrar before uploading a torrent to the torrent sites.  They do it because newbs are allergic to rar  :)"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-02-15T10:59Z,"well it's not really a thing that release groups require, The Scene has rules that require all releases to be rared.

usually uploaders (such as myself and many others) unrar them or get them unrared before uploading them so that downloaders dont have to do it.

and yea
as ct420 says, even tho it's not that hard to unrar, new users dont download rar videos cuzz they either dont know how to unpack or thing it's more time consuming."
,ScudB,2011-02-15T11:25Z,"Yeah, I do remember using Usenet for sharing files (and compressing them into multiple volumes) back in early 90-s. But this is 2011 for G's sake. Do you guys still use rotary phones or even make your food on firewood?

Why do the extra work and make others do it?"
,Zetterberg40,2011-02-15T13:57Z,"I premise this with I normally don't download .rar's because the ONLY reason people upload in .RAR is not for compression but because then you don't see a full file layout. They are assholes who have added scripts and nasty trojans into the files. I took a chance with this cause Castle is awesome and this is the only 720p torrent and it isn't even fully fucking seeded. I was stuck at 66% for hours wasting my uploads to other stuck bastards. NEVER AGAIN WILL I DOWNLOAD .RAR FILES. BOYCOTT THESE SCRIPTKIDDIE CUNTS WHO UPLOAD IN .RAR  

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. It isn't fully seeded and I expect on purpose. BAN SCENELINE!"
,Zetterberg40,2011-02-15T14:04Z,No seeds for HOURS!!! and probably a fkn dodgy virus ridden .rar. STEER CLEAR IMO...
,ScudB,2011-02-15T23:06Z,"Rar file needs one click to be unrared.

But the point is we're not using ftp protocol to share files, we use torrents.

So why not share actual, non-rared files?"
,wtf_lettuce_tomato,2011-02-18T01:57Z,"With the RAR, am I not still using essentially double the file space if I continue to seed? I mean, setting aside the other arguments, I have to keep all of the RAR files after I've extracted the mkv in order to keep seeding for others, right?"
