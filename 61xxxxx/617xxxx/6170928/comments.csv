,Muq,2011-02-14T22:28Z,"from where you got these soundtrack in 320kbps? In beta there are only soundtracks ogg and about 110kbps.

a pray it will appear in finished version of crysis 2."

Why are you complaining about superior quality??
isnt 320kbps good enough for u??"
,Muq,2011-02-15T10:18Z,"@locobot12
i dont mean i want get better quality than 320 kbps.

Im asking how did you get these songs in 320kbps cause i saw in data files in beta only music in ogg 110 kbps. Sorry for my bad english man. I hope you understood me."
,xxbassplayerxx,2011-02-15T10:19Z,"I believe muq was asking if this is really 320kbps, or just upconverted from the files available in the beta."

,1452,2011-03-26T04:00Z,"Would it be possible to get a torrent that has 

1.  all of the sounds from 'within' the game, such as those made by the nanosuit or other player actions.

2. the sounds that run when you first start the game, such as the ""achieved with cry engine 3"".  

I'd love to have all of these cool sounds so I can customize my pc sounds to make it sound like my pc is a version of crysis 2!  just think, instead of the default windows login sound, you can have 'achieved with cry engine 3"" and every time you do something on your pc, it will sound like a nanosuit :)"
