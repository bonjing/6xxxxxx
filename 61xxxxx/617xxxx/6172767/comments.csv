,sasukeluber,2011-05-23T06:03Z,Can anyone describe how to put this into my game? I extracted the file but where do I put it?
,Alegna05,2011-06-02T01:52Z,"This works beautifully! Thank you.

For those of you that are asking how to use this, extract the file then copy both ""TSLHost.dll"" and ""TS3EP03"" and paste them in the game's bin folder. The path should be something like ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Late Night\Game\Bin"". Overwrite the existing two files when it asks if you want to."
,maebba,2011-06-02T20:27Z,"I don't get it .. :/ When I have download it I do extract all then comes select destination and extract file ... Do I then have to copy and paste this "" C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Late Night\Game\Bin "" there ?  And where ca I do this Alegna05 ? ""Overwrite the existing two files when it asks if you want to."" ?? hehe not so good at this ;D"

,RusSpec,2012-01-21T06:57Z,Didn't work. Says that thing about the cd.
,Akuuntus,2012-04-06T22:38Z,Your instructions are hard to follow. I honestly don't know what I'm supposed to do. I installed The_Sims_3_v1.19.4-FLTDOX and then what? I tried the .exe and it failed. It says to install the update and copy the crack content but there is neither an update nor a crack in the .rar provided.
,cooglies,2012-04-17T18:32Z,Say I wanted to add Sims 3 Pets after this. What do I do with the two overwritten files in the Game Bin? Do I overwrite those with the Pets files?
