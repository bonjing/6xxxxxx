,maravan,2011-05-10T20:33Z," This documentary must be seen for many reasons. It is a history lesson for those who missed the tragedy of the Rowandan genocide. It asks the question: why do we value one human life above another? It tells the story of the courage and conviction of Romeo Dallaire; qualities he possesses to an extent that surpasses what most of us can only imagine. After the screening I attended, the audience was left speechless and was slow to applaud. We all sat in our seats numbed by what we just seen - that human life can have no value on a world wide basis. Please see this outstanding documentary."

,Bambikilr,2012-06-07T12:06Z,"Thank you for this UL. This is such an important movie, about an event, for the UN and the rest of the world, that is a shameful part of modern history, which needs to be told and retold as many times as it takes to make people aware and prevent it from happening again. This movie gives a good insight in the bureaucratic side to the story, the failure from the powers of the west, to intervene and stop the atrocities going on in Rwanda in 1994. Other movies that are important and good in the topic are ""Shooting dogs"" and "" Sometimes in april"". Also see the documentary about RomĂŠo Dallaire that goes by the same name as this movie. "
