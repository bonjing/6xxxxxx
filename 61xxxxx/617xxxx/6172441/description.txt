A documentary filmmaker travels to Jellystone Park to shoot a project and soon 
crosses paths with Yogi Bear, his sidekick Boo-Boo, and Ranger Smith.
Jellystone Park is celebrating its 100 anniversary, however it may be for the last time, 
because attendance is down and Mayor Brown wants to close the park and sell the land. 
If the park is closed, Yogi Bear and Boo Boo will lose their home. They join forces with 
Ranger Smith to save Jellystone from closing forever. Yogi must really prove in this endeavor 
that he is "smarter than the average bear".
