Well, ive spent the better part of my week getting these together and cracking them to work efficiently on most if not all emulators,
this includes-
Desmume
No$GBA
Visualboyadvance (with speedhack)
Fusion(genesis)

Ive included some games with these emulators that ALL WORK
-Sonic 1, 2, 3, Sonic and knuckles, sonic and crackers(homebrew), monopoly, chess, shadow run, and some others!
-Pokemon games-

Emerald Ruby and Sapphire
Mystery dungeon (all versions including explorers of sky)
Pearl Diamond and platinum
The first pokemon ranger game
pokemon pinball
and there are prolly some i forgot, but they all work on my specs
Win 7 home premium
2GB ram
2.2 Ghz processor(cuz desmume lags without the right fram skip set)
