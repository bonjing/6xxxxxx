Encoders Notes
I dropped the russian cam into vdubmod.
I used a color de-noiser on a high setting.
Then i used a normal de-noiser.
I also increased the gamma, saturation & lowered the brightness.
The colours looked off so i changed them with a rgb eq.
Then i sharpened it.
Finaly i muxed my encode to imagines line audio.
Its not great but it is just about watchable on ur pc screen.
The source was prety blurry & there wasnt that much i could do about it.
As its late i thought id do a screenshot comparison beetween mine & imagines.

Remember to download the sample first, to check ur happy with the quality.
Hopefully another video source comes along soon.
Enjoy..
