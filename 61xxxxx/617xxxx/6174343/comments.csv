,richardg8092,2011-12-28T12:53Z,"sanalkjoy - you might have listened to - but you obviously didn't understood it.
Simply putting in more ""HARD work"" is exactly the opposite of what Ferris advocates.
And ""help from GOD"" has NOTHING to do with it at all...
Apply the principles. Get the results. 
Your Invisible God is not involved."
