Sanctus Security Is Proud To Present Another Awesome Torrent




Product:	Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional (SP4)
OS Platform:	32 Bit



Minimum System Requirements


133 MHz Processor
64MB RAM
2GB Hard Drive




This copy of Windows 2000 Professional has been ripped from a Dell OEM installation disc. We have removed several features that are not needed for the operating system to function (and that no one uses) to make this a very small installation disc.

Using nLite, we have integrated the product key into the setup, so you will not need to insert a product key during installation. Also, if in the event that it tells you that the product key is not valid, and you cannot continue, please download and use nLite (http://www.nliteos.com) to change or remove the integrated product key.


This copy is fully updated with SP4, including the SP4 Roll-Up update. The only updates we have not integrated are the Windows Media Player Updates.



This disc comes in ISO (Disc Image) format, so you will need to use an ISO burning program. Try nLite or Nero.


TEST IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE SUCH AS VIRTUALBOX BEFORE BURNING TO A BLANK DISC
