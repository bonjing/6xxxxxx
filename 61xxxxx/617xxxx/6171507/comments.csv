,philmngan,2011-02-17T18:40Z,"@Pulse555 Calm down man, just thought that someone here could point us in the right direction. I'm sure lots of people here have the same question.

I've looked around on Google of course and just found the usual answers of ftp'ing (or using gigabit LAN) to internal on PS3. I hoped there was a way to play direct from external without using internal.
If you know I would appreciate a point in the right direction, thanks."

Thanks again for your help."
,cib9xx,2011-02-19T05:03Z,Ty Man trying it out took me 1 day =(.
,jerrygrand,2011-02-19T14:58Z,"Its simple, if we all had the money to buy every good game that comes out, we surely would. These ""pirates"" as You call them give us a chance to play the game and then choose if we really like it,  not only play it through once and put on the shelf. So dont be a bitch and give the people some respect. 
Thank You Mbb15"
