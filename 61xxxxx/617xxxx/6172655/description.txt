Reality television shows have been all the rage for the past decade, but few staples of the genre are quite as real as Discovery Channel's long-running program Deadliest Catch. Deadliest Catch premiered in early 2005 and has been on air to this day. It chronicles the adventures of crabbers that work in the Bering Sea -- the Arctic body of water hugging Alaska's coast. Sound unexciting? Believe it or not, it isn't.

The competition between captains and crews to catch the most crab in a season is riveting, and things are only made more dramatic by the high-stakes nature of the job. After all, the money to be made in this industry is mind-boggling, as are the inherent dangers of the job. Indeed, crabbing in the Bering Sea is considered one of the most dangerous professions anywhere in the world.
