,stingy.scrooge,2011-02-13T14:59Z,"@ticten

Is there an extended version of this movie? Because in the trailer there is a car chase(Ferrari vs Chevelle duel) sequence which apparently has been cut from the theatrical one. Or was it just false advertising? 

I am sorry if i am being too greedy..but could you also look into doing ""Flags of Our Fathers"".

Thanks for ""Beneath Hill 60""."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-02-13T22:14Z,"Jaack, 
     It's an .avi file, so I think subs are hard coded, and audio is English :(
BR's of classic movies are out, Hope this one will come soon.
Scrooge,
     'Flags Of Our Fathers' are fine and added 2 the queue.
Thanks :)"

,chaiyont,2011-02-14T07:21Z,"Good quality video! 

Dwayne ""The Rock"" is definitely the best of the current pool of ex-fighter/wrestler actors. 

This movie has an interesting twist at end - it's well directed, and well written, considering the genre."

please.."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-02-17T17:08Z,"@ ankit
It seems to be an old movie, Unable to find a decent source. It wont be a quality one if I encode from a 700MB avi source.
I've found a small sized rip for you.

Quality is awesome. I watch movies on my netbook. No big screens for me so your uploads are fine with me. Also my internet provider keeps a tab on my usage. So no fancy 1020p bluray for me. Small uploads are welcome from my side.

THANKS A LOT AGAIN"
