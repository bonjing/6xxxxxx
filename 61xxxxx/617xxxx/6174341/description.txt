Leela is feeling lonely, unable to meet a worthwhile guy. Professor Farnsworth sends the crew on a tax-deductible charity mission to evacuate wildlife from the doomed planet Burgon 6. While approaching the planet, Leela is thrilled to meet the legendary Captain Zapp Brannigan, who is policing the sector. Upon closer inspection, Brannigan turns out to be a pompous dimwit (who also thinks he's God's gift to women). Brannigan throws the Planet Express crew in jail for violating the planet's security cordon, but tries to seduce Leela. When his clumsy attempts to appear suave and sophisticated fail, he scores with pathetic crying. Leela gets the crew released, and they collect wildlife from Burgon 6, but the mission fails when the last animal collected turns out to be a tiny, voracious killing machine that consumes all the other animals. Leela names him Nibbler. Trapped on the collapsing planet without fuel, Leela refuses to go crawling back to Zapp. Then Nibbler excretes a lump of combustible rocket fuel, and the ship is saved.
