,[]Akira,2011-02-18T21:42Z,Is it all uncensored?
,Exevan,2011-02-22T21:56Z,"@noizereduction
what's stupid about child porn?"
,diosoth,2011-02-26T12:54Z,Don't bother. Imouto is run by idiots with no taste in art and any of the good content they have was stolen off other booru sites. Half the good art that's uploaded gets deleted because the site is flooded with trolls.
,ASAPplz,2011-02-27T11:18Z,"diosoth - I see you were banned from Imouto.

Bitter much?"
,ninjamitosai,2011-03-02T20:35Z,"Just a FYI, Nobody is able to download past 99.2%  hence why there's only 1 seed.  But I wouldn't know what the problem is so hopefully the seeder will work it out."
