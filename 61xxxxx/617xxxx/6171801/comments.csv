,pixie4000,2011-02-13T20:01Z,"@h3ll4b0y, It might seem a bit strange, but a lot of people have had issues running the game, seemingly with the shaders on among other things. This is to help prevent that."
,cometangel,2011-02-13T21:00Z,"wilfri14 maybe you dont answer because you dont know? i discovered that fix and the exception part is so the invalid file access text doesnt spam as much, wich results in better fps :)"

,crysis2texturefix,2011-02-13T23:09Z,"TEXTURE FIX!!!

i found that i had to disable my internet to actually start up the game! dont know wether thats Kaspersky being an ass or what, also to fix the texture corruption or missing altogether i went into profile options then created a new profile just name it whatever! i then started a game as new! no more water as road on the first levels and no more glowing heads etc! dont know why this worked, maybe the profile that was in use was a debug or something! Hopefully this works for you too! running the game on 1680x1050 hardcore no problems as yet! all that i see is at the initial load of levels you get a few invalid file access warnings on upper left of screen, but at least it is playable now!
kind regards"

,pyrokinetic,2011-03-10T12:01Z,"@Lacywest

I used to play with wierdass controls too, but believe me, you're best off learning to play with WASD, once you get used to it, shooters are a LOT easier."
