A much smaller version than whats out there for all the handheld users. Converted to MP4 to work all the little video gadgets we got out there. I personally love this show, hard to follow or make sense if you dont understand or respect the far out-ness of this show. Now if you'll excuse me kiddies, im going Delta....
