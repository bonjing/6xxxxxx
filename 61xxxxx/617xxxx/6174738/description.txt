Hey guys I got plenty ov requests for this discography.
I bought the albums Attack Attack! and Someday Came Suddenly with my money
so i guarantee you 100% EXCELLENT QUALITY. 
I also bought their EP "If guns are outlawed, can we use swords?" on amazon as
a digital download but they're demos so we can't expect much from an EP right?
But still all good quality.

I also embedded HD album covers so it'll look kickass if you have an Itouch.
And I also embedded their lyrics too.
I can't do any more to satisfy you guys.

*Note* Their covers "I kissed a girl" etc are NOT INCLUDED for they're not part ov any album nor their discography.

You guys please don't be dicks and seed.
I buy this with my own money and sharing it so don't leave bashful comments.
Give me credit for this and since i'm doing you a favor do me a favor :)

I'm uploading a torrent ov my own music i compose so look up at my torrents!
My project's name is MORNING STAR and i'm giving out my album for free. Please download and leave comments on what you think. Its darkwave/electronica/Screamo so if you like Attack Attack you'll like my music.

Back again to Attack Attack discography, please seed and Enjoy.
