Also it would be much better if you had uploaded all the songs separately instead of a big .rar file, so that it would be possible to download specific songs as required. "
,prashb,2011-02-22T08:05Z,"Will some please SEED?? Torrent's stuck at 1% with ""0"" seeders and 24 leecher's! "
,prashb,2011-02-23T08:23Z,"@ uploader(me4u2010) - Do you even care to seed after uploading? Its been 2 days and only 1.8%(76 MB) has been downloaded since you seem to seed for only like 5 mins a day? 

DON'T UPLOAD DEAD TORRENTS IF YOU HAVE NO INTENTION TO SEED IT!  "
