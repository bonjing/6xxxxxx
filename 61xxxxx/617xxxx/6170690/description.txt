Reviews: 
â€œDavid Hoffmann has produced an herbal reference masterpiece. This is one of the most comprehensive and detailed reference books to be produced in many years and will become one of the standard texts for professionals and researchers. I will place it next to my desk with my most often-used books.â€ 
(Mark Blumenthal, founder and executive director of the American Botanical Council, editor of HerbalGram, and senior editor of The Complete German Commission E Monographs--Therapeutic Guide to Herbal Medicines and The ABC Clinical Guide to Herbs )

â€œHoffmann beautifully blends science with his very holistic approach to herbal healing, displaying a true gift for making chemistry and physiology easy to understand. He not only suggests herbs and dietary changes to treat many conditions but explains why they work. Such knowledge aids both practitioner and herb user in understanding how they can choose the most effective and safe herbs. I applaud this as an important book for herbalism in the modern world.â€ 
(Kathi Keville, director of the American Herb Association )

â€œI consider David Hoffmann one of the most original and brilliant herbalists of our time, who dwells 'on the cutting edge' of thought and is often paving the way for others. The author of one of our finest herbal classics, The Complete Illustrated Holistic Herbal, Davidâ€™s ambitious undertaking of his brilliant new book provides us with yet another exceptional textbook on herbs that merges art, science, and conservation into a system of holistic herbalism for the future. This will be a valuable book for practitioners of herbal medicine as well as for other medical professionals.â€
