At least an 1:1 ratio would be cool, or if you really like this torrent, 2:1 or more would even be better. I usually go to 20:1 (yes, twenty to one) with my first seedings and then periodically seed after that. Any comments would be appreciated."
,.ANCIENT.,2011-10-24T04:36Z,Sorry about that. I haven't checked on this torrent for quite some time. I will be seeding continuously until the end of the year to make up :)
