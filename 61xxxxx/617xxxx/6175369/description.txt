Dragon Ball is the story of Goku, a brave, innocent young boy with incredible powers who is plunged into a mystical adventure that is played out in exotic lands filled with noble warriors, beautiful princesses, shape-changing monsters, armies of ruthless villains and a kooky old wise man.

These are the first 13 episodes of the Dragon Ball series and the full-length feature "Curse of the Blood Rubies".

These are the English dubbed and also edited for content version with a a new soundtrack released on DVD in year 2000, suitable for ages 5 and older.

Video: 720x480, x264, mkv, at 23.976215 frame rate. Feature and all episode have muxed (user selectable) English subtitles except for episode 13.

Audio: AAC Stereo, English, 160 bitrate, at 48 khz.

This is the first time that I can actually say that the converted x264 video looks far superior than the original source (which has very bad combing artifacts).

Please seed after uploading. Any and all critiques would be appreciated.

Enjoy!
