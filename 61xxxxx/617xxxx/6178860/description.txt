One minor update followed by one major, respectively dev_blind v1.1 and OpenPS3FTP v1.3
from developer jjolano. The homebrew app that â€œmirrorsâ€ a writeable copy of /dev_flash,
dev_blind, improves on user experience and other behind-the-scene optimizations, while
OpenPS3FTP packs a serious change log, improving on many aspects overall, resulting in better
performance and stability.
The full change log for each can be found on their respective download page.
Cheers to jjolano for another great release â€¦ err, releases!
