John Fogerty, leader of the legendary, late â€˜60s-early â€˜70s band Creedence Clearwater Revival, returns with The Blue Ridge Rangers.  The first and, until now, only album by Fogerty and the Rangers was issued 36 years ago; the â€œgroupâ€ consisted of Fogerty, who played all the instruments and sang all the parts on the tribute to old-time country and gospel music.  On the new â€œThe Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again,â€ Fogerty is joined by crack musicians Jay Bellerose, Dennis Crouch, Greg Leisz, Herb Pederson â€“ and Bruce Springsteen on a cover of the Everly Brothersâ€™ â€œWhen Will I Be Lovedâ€ and the Eaglesâ€™ Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmidt on Rick Nelsonâ€™s â€œGarden Party.â€ 



Interview with The Wall Street Journal:  


How did you pick the songs for the new album?

Most of them Iâ€™ve been carrying  around with me for a long time.  Iâ€™m kind of always collecting songs.  Itâ€™s been in the back of my mind to do another Blue Ridge Rangers album, so when Iâ€™d hear a song Iâ€™d think, â€œThat would be good for that.â€

Any particular reason you didnâ€™t play all the instruments yourself this time?

Oh yeah.  On the first one, it was a lot of work.  Really more than most musicians have to go through when you have other people carrying the load for you.  About a week after it was done, I felt the feeling of the music wouldâ€™ve been better if I had other really good musicians on it.  But I wasnâ€™t running in that kind of circle back then. I told myself the next time Iâ€™m going to get really good guys.

Thereâ€™s a very nice vibe on the new album.  Were the sessions as mellow as they seem? 

Pretty much.  That was very important to me.  Sometimes, you get good people together and itâ€™s as stiff as a board, with guyâ€™s showing off or stepping on the other guyâ€™s thing.  It can come out corporate-sounding and I sure didnâ€™t want that.  Iâ€™ve got this album â€œThe Great Dobro Sessionsâ€ by Jerry Douglas.  He got a lot of his idols and friends together and he surrounded himself with good people and they had a really great time.  I was going for that.
These sessions were so exciting.  I would say joyful.  They understood my concept of the Blue Ridge Rangers â€“ itâ€™s a certain way of doing it, an attitude.  These guys translated that feeling.  The joyfulness is more important than the particular music thatâ€™s being played.  Iâ€™m very happy with it.

How did the duet with Springsteen come about?

My wife Julie picked some of the songs.  She wanted me to do â€œWhen Will I Be Loved,â€ and in her vision she wanted me to sing it with Bruce Springsteen.  Iâ€™d been wanting to do something with Bruce for a long time.  With her added blessing, it was done.

That line in â€œGarden Partyâ€ â€“ â€œYou canâ€™t please everyone so youâ€™ve got to please yourselfâ€ â€“ does that resonate with you?

Very much.  I realize thereâ€™s a certain segment thatâ€™s not going to like this record.  You know, â€œI hate country music or why is John singing soft.â€  It will be off the radar for some people.  But a lot of people will get it.
That story sounds like you.â€  Then she said, â€œAnd Iâ€™d like you to sing it with the Eagles.â€  When youâ€™re around somebody like that, you just dummy up and go with it.
Don Henley was a big fan of the song and that line â€œIf memories were all I sang, Iâ€™d rather drive a truck.â€  Weâ€™re a couple of guys who donâ€™t want to be packaged as an oldies sort of thing.  We still have new music to make.  We still have creative forces within us.

Will you tour behind this album?

Absolutely.  These are the kinds of songs you play live.  The whole vibe of the recording is live.  When you have people around you who can handle those things, you want to keep playing with them.  If guys can only strum an open G chord, itâ€™s not much fun.

I hope you donâ€™t wait 36 years for the third Blue Ridge Rangers album.  Youâ€™ll be 109 years old.

Iâ€™ll make it a scorcher.
