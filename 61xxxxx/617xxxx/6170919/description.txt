In this edition of On the Edge, Max talks with Catherine Austin Fitts and again deals with American economic meltdown. Max raises the possibility that the revolutions in other parts of the world would come to the US. He says the economic systems favored by some corrupt Arab regime are similar to that of the US, that a mass movement against it in the US is inevitable. He also says the genie index is very high, which reveals the concentration of wealth among the top strata of the society.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
