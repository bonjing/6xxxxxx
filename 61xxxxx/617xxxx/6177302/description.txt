The Writing Practice Book provides a step-by-step guide to writing Kana and Kanji. It is designed to give maximum flexibility to users of The Japanese Stage-Step Course and enables students to learn, practice and perfect their writing skills at their own pace.

The book is divided into two parts; the first focuses on Kana and the second on Kanji. There are clear instructions on stroke order followed by tracing exercises and plenty of boxes are provided for additional practice. Kanji are gradually introduced in sets and are accompanied by the Japanese readings, examples of usage and radicals.
