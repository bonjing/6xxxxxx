[V],ChattChitto,2011-02-15T23:25Z,"In the NFO all needed Instructions are written, just follow the guide step by step :)"
,kernie,2011-02-17T03:02Z,Can this remove keyloggers
,YHH,2011-02-17T08:19Z,"do i hvae to find a new key every single day???? man, thats inconvenient"
,FinalFreedomEclipse,2011-02-18T17:46Z,YHH - you could ALWAYS get your thumb out of your ass and BUY a fricking retail copy of kaspersky (or a license from them online) so you DONT need to keep looking for a new key every single day. Ever thought about that? No?? I dont think so. either that or move to Norton 2011 with the trial resetter which lasts for 120days before next reset. I find Kaspersky to be the overall better program though
[V],ChattChitto,2011-02-18T23:26Z,"Exactly =)
That's why i always write in the Description:
NOTE: If You Like Kaspersky Products And You Can Afford Them, Do Buy A License To Support It's Developers."
,YHH,2011-02-19T02:48Z,"kaspersky isnt exactly affordable here.. and not everyone's a millionaire like you. T.T, FFE"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-02-19T16:54Z,"Also a good point, that's why these keys exist, but there's not such think as ""lifetime"" solution. :)"
,xeereex,2011-02-19T17:17Z,"I cannot install the keys.
No matter what i do, they only show me the purchase option.
They won't let me install or delete keys."
