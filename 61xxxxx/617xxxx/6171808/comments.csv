[T],locobot12,2011-02-14T02:49Z,"THis movie is wack !!

first two were the best!!"
,decebal2003,2011-02-15T10:36Z,"Thanx for the rip, the movie is shit full of mystical crap."
,Go_Vegan,2011-02-17T06:15Z,"I'm sorry, but this is easily the worst martial arts film I've ever seen.  Ong Bak 1, amazing, Ong Bak 2 was decent.  This is fucking horrible. I want the hour and a half of my life back....I demand it."
,Go_Vegan,2011-02-17T06:18Z,"Oi, props for the upload though, thank you!"
,GeorgeClayton,2011-02-19T05:05Z,"Update:  The story was impossible to understand, and most of the story is dragging you through this stereotypical ""recovering hero"" thing that never fucking ends.  ""Yea, we get it already, where are the sick fight scenes I remember?"""
,BarcaForce,2011-03-01T04:17Z,"Tony Jaa is amazing , introducing the world with Muay Thai Martial Arts. I've bought his last 3 movies: Ong Bak Thai Warrior, The Protector and Ong Bak 2 the beginning. I haven't seen this one yet but i suggest everybody watch the first 3 movies. Gotta say he is in the same category as all the other martial art Greats and Legendary fighters. Its awesome he ties in he's country's history, folk stories, legends and fighting style into his movies. May he always stays true to himself and his fellow countrymen and country."
,r1chee,2011-03-10T17:46Z,"have not watched this yet but have the first two so this should be interesting 

thanks extremezone"
,lil_dezrei_ph,2011-04-02T05:28Z,@Go_Vegan lol I agree with you..Ong Bak1 is awesome!
,Kikee_31,2011-04-14T04:02Z,"thanks again extremezone. Downloading now. I watched the sample already though i never usually need to with your Ups, the quality seems guarenteed as long as it has the ""extremezone"" name attached to it. Hope the movie is as good as the first one (or at least the second=)."
,Faizrazak97,2011-05-16T05:50Z,How can i find the subtitle??
,quest12,2011-08-18T21:32Z,Hey you lot stop being retards you got the film for free.
,kockunge,2011-08-21T09:50Z,"...i see it as theyre just complaining about the movie, and not about the person who uploaded it :)"
,kockunge,2011-08-21T10:26Z,"....and people who complains about free stuff might be trolls, but I think its vital to have them writing stuff aswell online in ways of open debate about quality and stuff . ĂÂ´Cause im sorry, the one thing legal downloading sites that cost money have over pirating ones, are that i might be better quality! (THIS movie was alright thou) Im sorry, but if pirating is going to stay progressive and not just something naughty that u do to...it has to put up with peoples troll-comments! its life.  

and the automatic response to any complaints are almost always ""its free stop nagging!"" which is dismissive, even when its tru! Sorry"
,kockunge,2011-08-21T10:31Z,"....and i wanna no if the movie might be crap or not :) -whether its constructive critic or not

/END OF RANT/"
