,tapper101,2011-02-18T13:44Z,"I loved this movie. I'm an atheist and this film made my disbelief even stronger. It can be a bit hard to follow the debate, especially if you are not from an English speaking country like myself, so make sure you have some subtitles on. I watched it with English subs as there was no Swedish subs up yet, and I didn't have much problem understanding what was said in the debate, but there was a couple of words I had to look up. 
Sure, ""White"" used a lot of say ""fancy"" words. But it's not ""White"" who's hard to understand, it's ""Black"" and his old school Louisiana and prison talk.
So what I'm saying is, if English is your native language, you'll understand this movie just fine (you might have to look a word or two up). But if English isn't your native language and you're not that good at it, I suggest you wait and get the subs for your own native language.

A:6 (Keep the volume down if you're using a good set of headphones, cause it will hurt your ears. It's like there's a second layer of audio that's sending out these really loud sounds when they talk in the movie.)
V:9 (Not perfect, but very good)
M:8.5 (The entire film is in set in a apartment in NY, just like in the original play. It does get a bit slow, but Samuel Jacksons' humor and fantastic acting gets you interested and makes you keep looking. Tommy Lee Jones (The professor or ""white"") is acting very well too, and has some very interesting things to say. But if religion is something you're completely uninterested in, or if you only like action/comedy movies where stuff happens all the time, this is not the movie for you. The entire movie is a debate between an Atheist and a Christian.)

It's not a pro-Christianity movie really. You can pick either side of the debate. In my opinion, the atheist is right. Sure he had some slightly exaggerated thoughts.. but he spoke a lot of truth. The Christan (""Black"") is basically saying what all Christians are saying, it's really nothing you haven't heard before... it's the ""God spoke to me"" bullshit. We all know the drill. 
If you're gonna listen extra closely to someone in the debate - it's White (Tommy Lee Jones). He's the eye-opener."

They either want to love a God, or they want to hate/deride someone/thing else.  They need motivation.
Religious believers want to know that there is good behind the world, even though they see bad all the time.
Athiests want to believe that religion is stupid, so they always have a target to poke at.
It's really no big deal what either wants, as none of us make the final choice.

I'd like to make one thing completely clear though.  There is a popularly purveyed LIE that most/all wars and atrocities are committed in the name of one religion or another.  It's become a banner cry for the whiners, but it's baseless.
ALL WARS ARE ABOUT MONEY.  They always have been, they always will be.  Anyone who believes differently is just fooling themselves, or ignorant of the real historical contexts. "
,catch311,2011-02-22T09:23Z,"I loved this movie. It was some great dialogue between white and black.  And you can take it both ways. I love that neither side wins.  And because of that, the viewers can take it either way as well.  I guess the only thing that my mind goes back to for all you atheists, is that White ultimately will die.  And for what?  Now I understand if you don't think your life should be lived following rules and laws of a God that you don't have a personal relationship to.  We all have different hearts.  But I'm just happy that I don't see the world as a bleak vast nothingness.  Because why would I want to wake up everyday and think to myself, ""well great, I'm alive, but really what reason is there to be alive?""

I don't live under the notion that being an atheist means you're a bad person. I do however believe it means you are a lost person.  And until I see proof that there is a plausible excuse for being an atheist, I will always continue to express my views and my beliefs as I believe it is expected of me.  Black did a very good job with his expression of Gods love.  God will not change your heart against your will.  We were created to have free will and that is what Gods love is for.  He loves us because he knows that we love him.  It is eternal and it's beautiful.   God Bless."

""well great, I'm alive, but really what reason is there to be alive?""
-It's simple. The reason for us seekers, agnostics, atheists is to make the world a better place with being good. To learn to be better from one generation to the next. To gather knowledge. Not to keep in the same track, following the same book for thousands of years. That holds us back, and we won't evolve as good to be the more greater beings we can achieve to be.
You ""believers"" believe God, or another savior will come down and make things good, and that's what you always have believed. With other words, that holds us back. It draws a line between us and spirituality. I believe we can reach spirituality through love and harmony and peace. But it ain't gonna happen as long as 30-40% of us don't think we can achieve nothing by ourselves. That one day, we're just gonna be picked up to ""heaven"" if we stay good.
And yes ""azzwipe74"",
I totally agree to your statement;
""if you need religion to teach you how to love then you have problems"".
You're saying it a bit judging and harsh, but I think it's something about that line. ""Believers"" has to read to learn to be good. Us others, who goes the sometimes lonesome road, we learn ourselves. And that's a fact that should be meaningful to you all.
And one more thing; sceptic people usually use the words ""I think"" in front of sentences before their personal views as they speak.
Religious people talk like it's the truth. You have no truth. You have words written down, and experiences you feel you can connect with that. Well, everyone has connections to their beliefs. It doesn't mean it's the fact.
So all in all, religious people are the ones that more often put their beliefs in others, without being open to inputs.
And besides, who wrote the Bible? The Coran? You don't know."
,larsagjorsvik,2011-02-23T01:08Z,"And for the record, my moral and belief actually contains wisdom from the bible.

I believe many of the words about love and understanding.
And that much of it are from Jesus himself.
But I also believe that the leaders, preachers and dicators of that time had something to say to it also. Wouldn't that be the case if it was to happen today?
Look at all the people bringing down the dictators of today's middle-east countries. Are they all believers of religion? They're not all religious. They just care about their own and their kids' future.
It tells me that decent men and women care about our future and our neighbor, regardless of their belief. And that's love. You don't have to learn it from God or Jesus. You can find it everywhere, just by traveling, watching our earth's beautiful nature. Don't you agree?"

An object/Matter can not just appear out of nothingness ... which means there can not  suddenly be a million planets ... heck there cant even be a space !!!

But if you're gonna claim who brought love and understanding to this world, don't say it's from religion. It all comes from rebels like Jesus, not from the ones writing the bible. Not from preachers or popes.

And I agree, religion made better in a world at that time driven by atrociousness and fear.
Even though all religion has it's downsides, it did well at that time. It brought morality to a higher level.
But today, with our knowledge, it's time to figure out to move on from old beliefs. To be open again, to what's around us, even though it's though with all the questions about life and death. Because, on a global scale today, morality provails. So we don't need religious control anymore."

 I am not trying to get in the middle off some dumb ass religion fight, cause they never go anywhere, it's not like you or they are gonna change one another's opinions, but to say religion is the only thing that taught us to love is just ignorance. Would you not agree that in history most of our battles and wars were fought over religion (and i am not talking about recent events, entire human race)? For you not to agree would be obvious ignorance. Every religion thinks ""there's"" is the ""right"" one, and look's different at anyone who disagrees (as you have proven) to me religion has taught us how to segregate ourselves from one another and not unite. 

Personally it truly does not matter what you believe to me, I think what ever you believe, and it makes you a better person then more power to you. But please don't sit here and say ""the only reason we love"" cause I don't believe in a religion, and I know the reason I love my family, and my girlfriend is not because of religion. I grew up with my grandfather who is a baptist preacher, so I know what i am talking about.

If you have to sit here and boast your beliefs, or talk down to another ones opinion it just shows your insecurity in your own belief. I know i am going to get haters trying to troll me, but don't bother cause i am not going to write on this torrent about this, so don't waist your time. Have a good day!"

You say religion changed the world, that was at that time driven by atrociousness and fear, and made it a more moral place. Although I greatly respect Jesus, and do believe that if people were to follow his teachings on how to treat one another the world would be a better place, you can hardly say the Christian church, which was not founded by Jesus, made the world a better place. Instead Europe entered the dark Middle Ages, with many a witch hunt, where an almighty church prevented any form of progress. It was only after the Reformation, Renaissance and Enlightenment, which saw the decrease of the controling power of one single church, that science could blossom. 
Also, it is quite well documented who wrote the Qur'an. I won't go into the details now because I'm afraid otherwise my post will be too long.

""and just allow people to believe what they want, as you would not like your beliefs to be questioned""
What differentiates science from religion is that science demands relentless questioning. It's part of the scientific method. In religions, what is usually regarded as the most laudable quality in a person, is (blind, unquestioning) faith (in a supreme being). This hostility towards an inquisitive mind is my greatest critisism to religion. It's this characteristic that prevents progress. 
So I would encourage this discussion, where each other's arguments are questioned.

I agree that wars are fought over money. There is religiously fueled terrorism, but wars between states are most of the time about money, with the religious reasons given as an excuse for the war to appease the people, to make the war seem righteous. 

@locobot12

Wow, your argument about the fact that ""An object/Matter can not just appear out of nothingness"" and that thus there must be a supreme being who created the universe really got me. 
Oh, wait, then where did this 'creator' itself come from?"

I agree with you, but I was referring to science to religion, I agree always questioning science is the only way further, but an argument science vs religion will never go anywhere. Religion is a set mind, and science is an open mind set. But I do get your point, and it was very much noted."

It just came out of explosion. Everyone will say I am NUTTS. How can humans and this sky and Earth and everything more sophisticated then a Ferrari can just come out of some explosion? Is somebody NUTTS!!!

Who defines what is good or bad? 

Having illegal sexual relations? Is that good? 

How about partying and drinking? Is that good?

How about sending your parents to foster home when they canâ€™t take care of themselves but they took care of you when you couldnâ€™t take of yourself? Is that good?

It is allowed to have illicit sexual relations and drinking until you are out of your mind and Gay marriages!! Whatâ€™s stopping anybody to permit stealing? Or Raping? In the future. Hell thereâ€™s even a porn industry!

@azzwipe74 : Your wife and kids are the reason for you to live. Well God forbid but what happens when they are gone? everybody dies. No offence intended.

@ 99881 : Who is judging who? Really itâ€™s all about having to able to do whatever you want whenever you want without any consequences. 

@ HappyGo: â€œNothing sickens me more than watching people adopt views based on ignorance.â€ I couldnâ€™t agree more. Donâ€™t listen to news and people!! Do your own research. Go and study the Quran (in English Translation) and then make up your mind (Conâ€™t)

@ Allifan: The Science and Physics argument Seriously!! Itâ€™s a man made subject where someone discovers something tomorrow and everything you believed till today was a total waste. And The Islam (Religion) is a God sent (The Quran) itâ€™s a challenge to anyone go read it in English translation and then come and bring me a valid argument after reading it that it isnâ€™t from GOD. I will follow you. But donâ€™t be researching online and find some bits and pieces and tell me that Quran (Islam) allows murder or what not.

And why would you wanna be good? If there is no judgment day! Whatâ€™s the point? "

,cq999,2011-04-30T23:59Z,"Samuel L Jackson&Tommy Lee Jones - it cant be bad.

And here is my opinion about the religions:
At first, every religion basicly the same. It doesnt matter, that you are catholic, protestant, buddhist, jewish, muslim or whatever - the matter is that there is a greater power, and if you agree this, your life will become easier.
At second, the humans never started wars because of any religion; they started them because of the institutes which wants control the people who has faith - it means about the 90% of the whole human race...

Thanx the upload!"
,Honda97,2011-10-31T13:54Z,People!!! God does not exist. 
,tx18wheels,2012-02-11T07:49Z,Quit trying to be so assinine as to attempt to settle the existence or non existence of God on a comment board. The beauty of the movie is the staunchness in which each character intelligently  defines his opinion. Jackson and Jones are capable of playing the character of reverse roles. Enjoy the movie and move on.
