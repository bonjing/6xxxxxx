Starting out in the 1998 circuit, Aaron Olson always had a nack for destroying dance floors. With humble beginnings playing trance and techno, Aaron quickly moved on to Hard Dance after the big Nukleuz bump in 99. Aaron spent most of the next few years jetting around Canada playing clubs and raves alike, eventually settling back down in Saskatoon and concentrating on production.

Aaron's first full production, â€œThe Subversion EPâ€, a hard, tech-trance offering, was quickly snapped up by BK's label manager Scott Attrill for Riot! Recordings. After release, â€œSubversionâ€ remained in the top 100 trance charts for 8 full weeks, along with names like Armin Van Burren, John O'Callaghan, Ferry Corsten and Nick Sentience.

His next EP, â€œEquilibriumâ€, a tech-trance offering infused with hard dance elements, signed to Traffic Recordings, has already gotten support by the likes of Flatland Funk, Scot Project, Luca Antolini, Kutski, Scott Attrill, Anne Savage, BK, Lisa Lashes, Alex Kidd, Kamui, Organ Donors, K-90 & more! It's been hailed by Beatport.com as "...one of the best packages of mixes ever to grace Traffic Records..."

He has forthcoming releases on Kung Fu Wax and a full 3 track EP out now via Tech Fu Recordings, that's already gotten the attention of BK, Lisa Lashes, Andy Farley, JP & Jukesy and others! He has also been in the studio working with Rodi Style on a track called â€œMillionâ€, which has already been licensed to a Tidy compilation as well as gained the attention of none other than Paul Glazby, who will be remixing it soon!

Despite being an up and coming player in the tech-trance circuit, Aaron's got a full on love for Electro/House as well. He has done an Electro remix of Sander Kleinenberg's â€œThis is Our Nightâ€ with huge response on both radio and from the soundcloud team! He has had Electro DJ mixes on DI.FM and has been consistantly booked regularly in the Saskatoon area to push his Electro sound. His first Electro tune â€œEquilibrium (Electro Version)â€, has consistantly had airings on Radio Cardiff in the UK as well!
