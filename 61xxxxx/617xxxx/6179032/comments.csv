,Garak51,2011-02-17T15:39Z,"From what I see, *.exe is some kind of database, but everything is, hmm....polish??"
,azza1969,2011-02-21T12:40Z,"just wondering if anyone has downloaded this,and is it ok?"
,dorota22,2011-02-21T20:30Z,"It is free of virus according to my Norton and it's a very precious torrent - if it is what it seems, namely lots of ebooks in Polish. But the rar file is password protected, and the password in .txt file doesn't work. The data base is very nice though - again in Polish.
I read everything in English but would really appreciate some stuff in polish for my 87 y. old father and it's a rarity to find anything.
But I am not a hacker, so can't access the contents of rar."
,Garak51,2011-02-21T21:36Z,Just checked comments on other site; rar password: ekoprojekt
,dorota22,2011-02-22T20:00Z,"THANX !!! Passwd works. It's a real gem - 5000 books in Polish, I don't know how to auto-run it, i.e. having """"integrated extracting programme"""" but I don't mind just unpacking them one by one. So far .doc but the readme suggests there are other formats too.
Thanx again."
,Garak51,2011-02-24T19:22Z,no problemo
