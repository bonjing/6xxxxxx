A distinctive and eclectic blend of rock, funk, folk, jazz, country, rockabilly, and New Orleans swamp boogie, Little Featâ€™s musical style was forged when Lowell George was fired from Frank Zappaâ€™s Mothers of Invention and told to form his own band.  Bill Payne, Richie Hayward and Roy Estrada joined with him to create Little Feat, a band that would continue recording, touring and transcending musical boundaries long after the tragic and premature death of its founder. 

JOIN THE BAND was an idea born in 2004 just after original Little Feat keyboardist Billy Payne had played on Jimmy Buffettâ€™s chart topping album, License to Chill.  Jimmy suggested flying the band out to his Shrimp Boat Sound studios in Key West to put together the all star project that had been planned for years prior.  With the production team of Payne and Buffett associates Mac McAnally and Alan Schulman in place, the project began to take shape.  

Just as it was impossible to easily categorize the sound of Little Feat, JOIN THE BAND is a true collaboration amongst stellar talentsâ€”the current members of Little Feat including Billy Payne (keyboards), Richie Hayward  (drums), Paul Barrere (guitar), Sam Clayton (Percussion), Kenny Gradney (bass), Fred Tackett (guitar) and Shaun Murphy (vocals) would often provide backup on songs sending tracks to artists giving them full reign over their contribution.  Some songs such as Woody Guthrieâ€™s â€œThis Land Is Your Landâ€ feature Little Feat members on vocals with guest artists Mike Gordon from Phish laying down the bass.  The resulting confluence of Feat, Phish, Guthrie, blues folk and gospel creates a musical gem unique to the spirit of â€œJOIN THE BAND.â€
