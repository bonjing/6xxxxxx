Blaine began playing at the age of 15, and two years later was steady gigging around the Grand Rapids area. Blaine returned to Chicago seven years ago, and after a stint touring with the late, great Little Milton, he currently plays with the Chicago Rhythm & Blues Kings as well as pursuing his own guitar-driven blues sound."
