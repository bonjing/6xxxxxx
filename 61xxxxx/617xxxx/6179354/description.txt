Affectionate but honest portrait of Thin Lizzy, arguably the best hard rock band to come out of
Ireland.

Starting with the remix of the classic album Jailbreak by Scott Gorham and Brian Downie, the
film takes us through the rollercoaster ride that is the story of Thin Lizzy. From early footage
of singer Phil Lynott in Ireland in his pre-Lizzy bands the Black Eagles and Orphanage, it
follows his progress as he, guitarist Eric Bell and drummer Brian Downie form the basic
three~piece that was to become Thin Lizzy ~ a name taken from the Beano.

Using original interviews with Bell, Downie, the man who signed them and their first manager,
it traces the early years leading to the recruitment of guitarists Brian 'Robbo' Robertson and
Scott Gorham - the classic line-up. The film uses a number of stills, some seen on TV for the
first time, archive from contemporary TV shows and a range of tracks both well known and
not so famous.

There are hilarious self-deprecating anecdotes, from the stories behind the making of the
Boys are Back in Town to the hiring of Midge Ure. We hear about the 'revolving door' as
guitarist after guitarist was fired and hired, and the recording of Bad Reputation and Live and
Dangerous - where producer Tony Visconti pulls no punches in talking about how he
recorded the latter - putting the controversy to bed for the final time. Except that Downie and
Robertson still disagree with him.

Finally we hear how drugs and alcohol impacted on the band and how the music suffered,
how one member later substituted golf for heroin, and how addiction and the related lifestyle
led to the death of Phil Lynott.
Contributors include Brian Downie, Scott Gorham, Eric Bell, Brian Robertson, Midge Ure, Bob
Geldof, Tony Visconti, Joe Elliot [Def Leppard] and many others.
