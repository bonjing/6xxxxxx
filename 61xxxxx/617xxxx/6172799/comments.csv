LOL same here ust2 I've missed every episode this season cause I keep forgeting the time changed.  Even though I think Bob's burgers is ok I like American Dad better.

Roger makes the show funny."
,Atheistic,2011-05-07T07:02Z,@heyman1981 Roger is the greatest character in toon history!!! Are you serious!? I've been watching cartoons for 35 years and no way no how no one comes close to the comedic genius when Seth created Roger. You're out of your mind dude!!! If it wasn't for Roger I could almost guarantee it wouldn't have made it this far!
