,itzzlucas,2011-02-13T02:32Z,weow wait for ages and its in rar files? how do i play them all in rar files? :S
,claytona57,2011-02-13T04:14Z,Yup rar files are not worth the bandwith or HDD space.  What a waste of a torrent
,habad,2011-02-13T05:33Z,All u have to do is just extract all the files using winrar and they will all extract to a new folder. In the new folder is one avi video with the whole episode.
,habad,2011-02-13T05:34Z,Oh yeah forgot to say thnxs for the upload. I guess ur the only one who uploaded it too.

,Livens,2011-02-14T00:48Z,"As to my original comment, rar file are a mere inconvenience. I was asking why split it up that way to begin with? Years ago when DL'ing from IRC chat it made sense to do this, as you could connect to multiple files at once and get it quicker. But in todays world of broadband and torrents I o not see the purpose."
