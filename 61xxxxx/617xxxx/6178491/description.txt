Paul Kersey [Charles Bronson] is an architect who served in the Korean War in the medical corps, and he lives in New York City. One day, three street punks posing as grocery delivery boys break into his apartment while he's not home. They beat up Paul's wife Joanna and rape his married daughter Carol Toby, spray-painting both of them & the wall of their apartment "just for fun." Joanna later dies of her injuries, and Carol is left catatonic. Paul's life is ripped apart by this.
