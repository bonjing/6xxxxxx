BBC Panorama 2011 WikiLeaks The Secret Story HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

As the extradition hearing to decide whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange must return to Sweden to face a rape allegation reaches its judgement, Panorama talks to his former right hand man who walked out last year. Assessing what WikiLeaks and its exposing of sensitive official material has achieved, the film examines claims that the organisation famous for leaking government secrets was paranoid about leaks from within and that it has failed to live up to its own ideals on openness.
