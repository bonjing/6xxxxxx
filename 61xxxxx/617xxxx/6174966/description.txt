Absolutely the last versions of these I am going to post (I promise!).  Most have been altered in some way, cover art added, pages made the same size, etc.  If you're satisfied with the previous versions posted then don't bother.  Content is still the same, just cosmetic changes.  I think the only thing that could be done with them now is full text conversion using something like FineReader but that would be a ton of work and would require someone with much more patience than me.
