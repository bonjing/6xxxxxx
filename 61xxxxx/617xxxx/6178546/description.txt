OVERVIEW

   Startup Defender is a small Windows startup manager program that sits
   in your Windows tray and constantly monitors in real time the startup
   locations on your PC to help prevent programs from auto starting up
   behind your back. 

   If a program tries to write itself into any startup location Startup
   Defender will pop up a windows and ask if the program is allowed to
   place itself to start automatically with Windows.

   Also you can disable/enable any programs that are currently installed
   to startup automatically. If there is an entry you are not sure what
   it is then you can Google it to see if it is needed or even harmful
   and choose if you want it to load it at startup or not. For the annoying
   programs that try to repeatedly place themselves in the autorun for
   Windows you can click the auto block so that Startup Defender stops
   them without you having to bother with them anymore.

   Also you can now view all processes and services then selectively
   start/stop each one.
