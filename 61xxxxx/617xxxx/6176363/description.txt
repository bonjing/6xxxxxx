The fabulous fifties were swinging, fast-paced years when, for the very first time, you didnâ€™t have to be just a child or an adult.

In fact you could be something far more exciting â€“ a teenager!

The 1950â€™s saw a sharp rise in the number of young people, the so called â€˜baby-boomersâ€™ who were growing up and hugely outnumbered their older generations. And they wanted music they could call their own.

It was an exciting and rebellious time and its music reflected just that. Whether it was skiffle, easy listening, swing, or early rock and roll, it all spoke directly to the younger generation.

A definite soundtrack emerged for a definite section of society â€“ it was truly popular music.

Now a collection of 60 of these wonderful, influential songs are brought together on The Fabulous 50s, the first release in the My Kind Of Music series.

My Kind Of Music is its own unique brand through USM Media that plans single and multi-artist nostalgic compilations specifically evoking memories and feelings of years gone by. The series then builds into a complete collection of unforgettable recordings.

Titled simply The Fabulous 50s this first, three CD deluxe box set embarks on a marathon journey - from the big stage of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin to the easy tones of Perry Como, Pat Boone and the Everly Brothers, from the guitar stomps of Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran and Bill Haley to the pop beats

Out on USM Media on February 7th, The Fabulous 50s comprises almost two and a half hours down memory lane.

Beautifully presented and thoughtfully compiled The Fabulous 50s gives you just what it says on the tin â€“ fabulous music from a truly unforgettable time.
