this portraits the development of the songs 'red house' and 'hear my train a' comin'' during jimi's short career.
in contrast to 'red house' which starts as a finished composition and is subject to some variations,
'hear my train' begins as a rather non-finished idea and evolves from a rather shyly presented acoustic-blues
to the nothing-could-come-hereafter-version played in berkeley 1970. with billy cox as a bank and jimi and mitch
going really far out...
