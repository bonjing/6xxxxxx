If you want to do something good for the community, provide something that isn't already here."
[T],insinuendo,2011-01-18T21:48Z,"You do an OK job encoding.

Now all you need to learn to do is torrent while respecting others efforts :)

You pulled the same crap with the Kill Bill duology, uploading yours 5 days or so after I uploaded EuReKA's:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6051856/Kill.Bill.Vol.2.2004.1080p.BluRay.x264-EuReKA

I just don't think that's cool for many reasons."

[T],insinuendo,2011-01-19T01:11Z,"It's not only about me.

It's about our shared efforts at trying to build a reliable network of free media for like-minded people, without stepping on each other's toes :)

No harsh feelings."
