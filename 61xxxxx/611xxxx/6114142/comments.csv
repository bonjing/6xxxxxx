,grfam,2011-01-22T15:01Z,thnax a lot!
,VaticanCity,2011-01-22T17:14Z,Anyone interested in Aerosoft Malta X. I've been doing a little work to the FS2004 version to make it more compatiable with FSX. I've added a few things also. It's not easy to play with aerosoft files .It's a touch hard on the FPS though but looks Awesome. Even the FS2004 is hard on the FPS though due to the way the creator built it.Let me know and when I think it's ready I'll up.
,barabas12,2011-01-22T18:40Z,"Sorry to say VaticanCity but BitDefender is making trouble with this saying some virus in build in the .exe(?)

It says: Nebuler 9 Variant.

Is Bitdefender fooling me again or is it explainable or trouble ?"
,VaticanCity,2011-01-22T19:26Z,Absolutely no Virus.Everything that's posted here gets a Eset Nod32 viral scan. Bit Deffender is much like Nortons will pick up on anything. You have my word. Check out my Carenado 340 II everyone trusts me. At least I hope I'm deserving of thier and your trust. Your choice to install or not.But this a fine scenery package.
,barabas12,2011-01-22T20:54Z,"Thanks for the explanation VaticanCity.

BitDefender is making trouble lately so Iâm happy with your answer.

I`m sorry for any inconvenience."

,Husky_65,2011-09-09T03:27Z,"Thank You very much. :-)
I do have one problem with the Aerosoft's program called applicatiion launcher. After an installation of the Zurich Mega-airport, it came as a side dish, and now all my added scenery and airports are on a time limit. After trying to uninstall the Application Launcher, all my Aerosoft airports stopped working. Does anyone have an idea, how I can fix this nasty nuisance?
Thank You all in advance..."
