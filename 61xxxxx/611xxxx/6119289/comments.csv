,mibrons,2011-03-11T17:45Z,"Thank you so much peterwan! I have been looking for this for ages, I tried also crack it myself but coudln't. The old crack had problems with arrays, this works!
You also included certificates for Enhancements, Dark Lights and Dark AI, sweet! Thank you so much, great job cracking dude, I hope you continue with your work.
Any reason why the old interface?
Tell me if you want any DBPro addons, I've lots of them.
Confirmed to work on Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate, I will help seeding."
,peterwan,2011-03-28T11:38Z,"Thanks mibrons. you have mention about old interface, i think you mean the IDE. just look
in the dbpro Editor directory and you will find
a file called EditorNew.exe, but i love the old
ide, because its very odd, never seen such an
ide:). You said something about DBPro addons
if you could seed then it will be great.
anyway have fun..."
,peterwan,2011-05-23T06:49Z,"where are you mibrons motherfucker
