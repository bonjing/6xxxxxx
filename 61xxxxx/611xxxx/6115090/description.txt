
Here is a collection of beginners Flash and Dreamweaver video tutorials 
that are practical, to the point and easy to understand.

Dreamweaver is the most popular web design program used today 
because it makes building websites easy. One of the cool things about
Dreamweaver is that it supports a wide range of web technologies, 
including CSS and HTML, Web Standards, PHP, ASP and ColdFusion. 
In the same token, Flash has become the platform of choice for delivering 
web based software - something that Java Applets once promised but
never delivered. Since the release of Flash CS3 and the new ultra powerful 
(and fast) Flash virtual machine (that uses the new Actionscript 3.0), you 
can now build incredible software easily with Flash.
