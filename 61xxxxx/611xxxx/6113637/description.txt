Use quality DVD disks like Verbatim/TDK/Traxdata/HP for optimal results.
Write them at 2-4x, not more!

====================

If the disk don't work, see this:


Check in the settings menu in Imgburn Writing Tab and check if BookType setting is ticked as "Automatic"
With official firmware only +R DL media will be book typed to 'DVD-ROM'

In Imgburn you may insert the DVD and you select Discovery on the main menu you can check the actual status of the DVD

That this particular DVD works fine although it is DVD+R does not imply that any other DVD's will function.
If this writer is not writing DL DVD's as DVD-ROM, you have aproblem since most DVD-readers cannot handle the DVD+R and DVD+R DL copies

Pioneer drives and Book Type setting
