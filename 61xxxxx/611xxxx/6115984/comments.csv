,sapoclyde,2011-01-21T22:33Z,Fantastic colllection. Thanks for sharing
,thearches,2011-01-26T20:33Z,"Thanks so much.  I don't know a lot about classical. Is this a good way to start learning?

Looks like some of the later torrents have disappeared.  Is there a problem?"
,patrickw59,2011-01-27T11:10Z,"thanks for providing the first half of this wonderful music which I could no longer find in my shops.

When can we expect the last parts of this set of 60 CDs? "
,rosie1966,2011-01-30T13:07Z,"Yes. Looks as though Lucy has been subjected to the mysterious account deletion.

It hits everyone on tpb eventually apart from the lucky few!

I've notice this series is also being posted to btjunkie if you need it all!"
,rosie1966,2011-01-30T13:25Z,"You can download the complete set here:

http://www.mp3tera.org/classical/Leonard-Bernstein---The-Symphony-Edition--60-CD---2010---FLAC--43421.html

Scroll down until you see 'Download' in green and the links are below. If you do not have a premium account with h-o-t-f-i-l-e  (3 months unlimited download can be bought for less than $10 on ebay) then use the excellent Cryptload (the sister application of uttorrent) to download these links.  It will not be as fast as a premium account but it will do the job!"
,patrickw59,2011-01-30T19:40Z,"rosie1966:

only a limited fraction of the 60 CDs is available on jtjunkie (unless of course I made a mistake in my search). Have you spotted the CDs 46 to 60?

I noticed your comment that an account at tpb can be deleted. Why? For what purpose?

Cryptload is only available for PCs. So I will only be able to use it on my system when it is available in version 2.
