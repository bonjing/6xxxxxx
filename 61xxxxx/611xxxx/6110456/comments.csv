,brandont2,2011-01-18T09:33Z,"No complaining intended here. Just a question.

Does anyone know why there's no longer a decent torrent for this show? Or why it takes so long, especially for the 720p copy (if it comes out at all)?

Again, only asking. Thanks to those who make available what they can."
,Prco,2011-01-18T10:16Z,"For some reason the ""scene"" is avoiding American Chopper. At least this season. Releases have been really crappy quality. All it takes is one individual to encode the show in good quality, but nobody is stepping up."
,poopp00p,2011-01-18T17:25Z,"hey asshole ""Prco "", I see you're ""stepping up"" quite a bit with all the different torrenst you've been busy encoding. You people are unbvelievable little bitches whining about others who even bother to up torrenst that theyre not doing enough for your tatses. youre a stupid little bitch, pico."
,Prco,2011-01-18T18:31Z,"Hey asshole pooppop, hey, even your name has something to do with ass, poop.

I would step up if I lived in a region where AC aired jan 17th.

And this torrent IS crap quality, even the description says it, idiot. And the audio is out of sync too.

Being critical about quality is MUCH more useful than idiots with their ""thanks""-posts, or ""stop whining, its free"". Don't you agree, idiot?"
,lontrus,2011-01-18T20:03Z,"well yeap was bad quality but was still watchable...
it's unbelivable how much times us channels have commersials in .. they dont last long but still a lot
in here we have discovery and history channel but they show old series and new come with 1-2 year delay 
actually now they start to get better and the delay starts to be less then year as the jr vs sr started week ago "
,rEdRoLiCa,2011-01-18T20:12Z,"Just wanted to say thanks to the uploader. When it comes to not seeing it at all or this torrent - I choose this torrent every time! I dont care if it's shit, ads or not - without uploaders like this - I dont get to see it at all! So, thanks."
,kivdnallah,2011-01-18T23:05Z,Thanks man was waiting for this:) better then nothing:) keep doning this Higga :)
,poopp00p,2011-01-19T05:23Z,"Hello friendly DLers. Just FYI, bookmark me and look for when I UL the show sometimes as little as ten minutes after it airs her ein California

here's teh info:

American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior - Lee Returns
Mon, Jan 24, 9:00 PM   /    TDC-W 67    /   New 
When Senior tries to repair his damaged relationship with Lee, they begin to talk about everything that has happened between Senior and his sons, but that doesn't deter Senior from following his lawyer's advice to sue Paul Jr. Designs.

American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior - Foreclosure
Mon, Jan 31, 9:00 PM   /    TDC-W 67    /   New 
Tensions are running high between Senior and Junior, as the grapevine continues to hint at possible financial trouble for Orange County Choppers; a bike made for a hospital lifts spirits, while Paul Jr.'s Designs experiences some staff issues"
,poopp00p,2011-01-20T02:51Z,"@ ""pico"" Yeah, asswipe. Keep telling yourself that criticizing and bitching about a torrent that no one else took the time to record and UL for the rest of us is somehow ""helpful"". Keep telling yourself that you fucking lousy bitching ingrate asshole. Thanks for being a giant shroom-head and trying to fuck it up for everyone else."
,Prco,2011-01-20T05:08Z,"@poop nugget

Wow, such fancy words. You could use the time you spent finding those on figuring out how to encode video properly.

""I UL the show sometimes as little as ten minutes after it airs her ein California""

Yeah do it as quickly as possible and don't bother to check if it's any good. You can always blame the source material, lack of intelligence (like that would happen), or alien interference. And don't forget to include the disclaimer that it's free, so that people wouldn't complain about minor things like shit quality or out of sync audio.

Do it properly, or don't do it at all.

I'm wasting my time though. You'll do it anyway and suck at it."
,higga,2011-01-20T06:55Z,"LMAO @ pico shit stain. Look at the big asshole ""daring"" me to stop ULing a show that a lot of people want. Funny how ""pico"" asshole is the big eggspurt on ""encoding"" and ""checking"" all sorts of things, but Mr. JuniorAsswipe doesn't bother to actually have any uploads himself. :D

Stupid bitch. Go choke on a chicken bone ;)

Don't worry, others. I'll keep upping these. Little epicene piss-ants liek ""pico"" try to ruin things for others and I won't give him the satisfaction.

"
,Prco,2011-01-20T20:13Z,"Don't worry nigga, your encoding work doesn't give anyone satisfaction. Booyaa!"
,higga,2011-01-24T22:22Z,"@ Pico - LOL you stupid noob. It's not ""out of sync""  It's a straight recording from TV broadcast, you idiot. Your crappy WMP isn't playing it right. Try VLC, asswipe. "
,begeezus,2011-02-01T02:35Z,@poopp00p where are these magical uploads of american chopper you said you would upload..??
