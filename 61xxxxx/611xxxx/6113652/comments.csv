,UsedDildo,2011-03-13T07:31Z,"Before i try this torrent - can either the upoloader or someone who's downloaded this torrent please tell me, does it also have the ""property of the weinstein company - do not duplicate"" watermark like most of the other The King's Speech torrents seem to?

I've downloaded three different torrents already and all have the same annoying watermark - i want one without.

Thanks folks. "
