This torrent includes .FLV (Flash video, playable with VLC among other players) files downloaded directly from YouTube in 360p quality.

All missions in the StarCraft 2 campaign are included here, with walkthroughs on how to complete them on the Brutal difficulty setting. The commentary is made by Zai, this torrent is created simply for redundancy, if someone wishes to download all the videos via torrent instead of manually on YouTube.

All copyrights still valid for Blizzard Entertainment, the commentary copyright is owned by Zai, all in all this most likely falls under fair use (commentary) and hopefully Zai does not have a problem with the distribution of the videos in this way. Im just trying to make it easier for people who want all the videos at once.

If you appreciate the work Zai has put in, please drop him a note at his brothers (Psy) YouTube channel here:
