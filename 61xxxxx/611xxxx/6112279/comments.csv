,sproc,2011-01-25T21:05Z,"For me it worked perfectly. Appears to be a Microsoft tool eh? Works by doing the usual bios tie in. In any case, while RemoveWAT worked, the latest ver of MSE found it was hacked. This tool perhaps like the tools for Vista work better. Doesn't have the pre boot loader either.

Used on win7 x64 ult MSDN

Thanks."

Try turning off UAC, then restart, then run it as admin. This should hopefully work for you :)"
,anarchist9027,2011-03-12T05:01Z,This is 100% legit straight from M$. It also works with Service Pack 1 too :)
