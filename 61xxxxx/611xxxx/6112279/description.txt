Usage

Double click on kb780190.exe and you will be asked for administrator privileges. Follow the onscreen prompts
For automatic mode, use "kb780190.exe /a" from the command line
For automatic silent mode, use "kb780190.exe /a /s" from the command line.

I would recommend that you do a clean install prior to using this if you have tried to use cracks or other BIOS emulators or cracks because it is not guaranteed to work.
