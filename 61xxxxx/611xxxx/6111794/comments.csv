I have King Arthur The Roleplaying Wargame installed. I installed this expansion and copied the crack as usual. The game starts but itÂ´s exactly the same game I have without the expansion installed. In the trailers says that I should get a new campaign but nothing new happens after installing this expansion (and the same happens with the Saxons Expansion). Does anyone knows what IÂ´m doing wrong. Thanks in advance."
,barbaneli,2011-02-05T01:12Z,"I am having the same problem. Over Reloaded original game release i have installed the Skidrow expansion .

Game is noticably updated to v1.05 in the main menu when started.

Running the KingArthur.exe"" win DLC:wales
shortcut is not changing anything. 

The campaign stays same as in the original when choosing ""New game"", and there are no options to load a different campaign in the menu.

If anyone solves the problem please post some useful information about it."

I cant find it anywhere on torrent sites. Wondering if anyone would like to share! Thx."
,pig2011,2011-08-09T19:39Z,"there's a big problem

i've installed the saxons before druids and it's also made by skidrow for ""reloaded version""

so, after i install druids, there should be 2 DLCs on the menu, right? 

but only druids show up, which means, this  crack is only for druids but both...

WTF!!!!"
