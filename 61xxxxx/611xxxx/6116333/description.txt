THE ARMANDO IANNUCCI SHOWS

The Armando Iannucci Shows is a series of eight programmes directed
by Armando Iannucci and written by Iannucci with Andy Riley and Kevin
Cecil. It was shown on UK's Channel 4 from September to October 2001. Each
show had a rough theme, often somewhat existentialist in nature, around
which Iannucci would weave a series of surreal sketches and monologues.

Recurring themes in the episodes are the superficiality of modern culture,
our problems communicating with each other, the mundane nature of working
life and feelings of personal inadequacy and social awkwardness. Several
characters also make repeat appearances in the shows, including the East
End thug, who solves every problem with threats of violence; Hugh, an old
man who delivers surreal monologues about what things were like in the old
days; and Iannucci's barber, who is full of nonsensical anecdotes.
