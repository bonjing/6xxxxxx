,Insomneac,2011-01-18T08:48Z,"Thanks for the upload.

I assume this is no different to a ""regular"" Borderlands release, as the GotY version doesn't have the DLC included and merely has one-time use download codes?"
[T],Ex_Exist,2011-01-18T15:27Z,"GotY version contains all 4 DLC, nothing further needs to be downloaded. all activated."
,shauwy,2011-01-18T21:15Z,thank you bro good idea to gather all in one package that most are multilingual Another quality upload your assets has good luck Thanks again ^ ^
,roxxo,2011-01-19T01:11Z,Thanks a bunch. Will be seeding this like crazy as soon as I finish it. KEEP IT COMING 
,Insomneac,2011-01-19T07:11Z,"@ Ex_Exist, the GotY edition that's in stores (retail) doesn't have the 4 DLC's included, it merely has codes and you have to download them all.

Unless this is a home made one, or another version I've never heard of?

Thanks again."

,Insomneac,2011-01-19T21:45Z,"Thanks a lot Ex_Exist!

The Amazon box art says it comes with the DLC, but the Amazon reviews all say it only comes with codes.

Anyway, can someone who has actually downloaded this confirm it, please?

,da.judan,2011-01-20T07:24Z,"After I installed the 1.41 patch, it wants a serial number. Anyone know where I can get one of those?"
,da.judan,2011-01-20T07:27Z,I need a 1.41 serial key. . 
,da.judan,2011-01-20T08:34Z,"Nm, I figured it out! Thanks for the torrent man, great work!"
,VenWorx,2011-01-20T12:04Z,"Insomneac,

DVD images contains version for electronic distribution from Nexway. Original game + all 4 DLC in one installer. Plus patch 1.41. Crack for patch 1.41 and securom-decrypted maps for DLCs."
,Insomneac,2011-01-20T21:09Z,"@ VenWorx, thank you very much for the detailed explanation, I appreciate your time.

And thanks to the uploader and seeders."
,Rodan.H,2011-01-20T21:41Z,"It works great! Yes, it does contain all the DLC's just follow the instructions above and woila! But if you have Norton 360 4.0 it will see the crack ""paul.dll"" as a virus so turn of autoprotect. It was my case so I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Thanks to the Uploader and TRiViUM!"
,chicken768,2011-01-21T07:25Z,"@da.judan (or anybody else for that matter)

I'm having the same ""serial number"" message appear, and would like to know what exactly you figured out to get this game rolling. Apologies if that's a stupid question, I'm quite the novice around these parts."
,chicken768,2011-01-21T07:29Z,"@da.judan (or anybody else for that matter)

I'm having that very same ""serial number"" message pop up, and am at a loss here. Being quite a novice around these parts, I would appreciate a more detailed guide to what you ""figured out"" in order to get the game working. Thanks in advance."
,Insomneac,2011-01-21T07:41Z,"@ chook, you have to copy the crack from the Trivium folder (DVD2) to where the game is installed.

Then it won't ask for the serial.
"
,chicken768,2011-01-21T14:34Z,"Thanks a bunch for that! Last night the game launched without a hitch and worked perfectly, however this morning it's giving me a ""wrong disc inserted"" message. I haven't altered anything in any way, so what gives? Sorry for the question onslaught."
,1TWISTED,2011-01-21T14:51Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,Insomneac,2011-01-23T01:06Z,"@ Chook, the reason it's happening is because your Anti-Virus thinks ""Paul.dll"" (from the crack) is a virus and has probably either deleted or quarantined it.

Replace it, then add the file as an exception to your Anti-Virus so that it ignores it."
,traypalazax,2011-01-24T05:43Z,"OK I'm seeding this game but. If I can't get it to work I'll stop seeding it. How to and what makes me get rid of the need for a key? My antivirus is off.
I downloaded, installed, Ran the update. Copied the content from TRiViUM folder. I am missing somthing , please help."
,Insomneac,2011-01-24T10:23Z,"If it's asking you for a key, then it's not cracked properly.

If you're sure you're doing it OK, then it has to be your Anti-Virus.

Sometimes turning them off isn't enough, you have to add ""Paul.dll"" as an exception."
,traypalazax,2011-01-25T06:49Z,"ok when you say ""Paul.dll"". is this somthing I should be able to find , because I don't see it anywhere?
Can someone just explain the procedure without skipping anything, because I think you are expecting me to know something. "
,Insomneac,2011-01-25T08:02Z,"""Paul.dll"" is in the Trivium\Binaries folder on DVD2.

Most Anti-Virus see it as a threat, and usually quarantine or delete it.

That's what is happening to you, and why it's still asking you for a key.

Anyway, easiest way is to install the game, then copy the crack over.

EG Copy the entire contents of the Trivium folder from DVD2 to the game directory, and overwrite if asked.

Then add the entire Borderlands installation folder to your Anti-Virus as an exception so it will ignore it.

Once that's all done, it should work perfectly."
,traypalazax,2011-01-25T16:38Z,"Ok I'll try it. Since theirs nothing in my binaries, do I need to redownload?"
,traypalazax,2011-01-25T16:57Z,"This is getting tiresome. Ok I have 2 files in Programes. AGEIA Technologies, and TVM_BLGOTY,
some stuff in one and some in the other. The Paul.dll is in both. still is not working...

???? 

what do I do now.
All I'm doing is extracting the TVM_BLGOTY1 and 2 in the rare file from the torrent. Any sudgestions. Theirs no file called crack, just the trivium, with DLC's, Binaries, Laungage ch.

Please help..."
,traypalazax,2011-01-25T21:41Z,"what does ""copy the crack over."" mean?
and what does "" EG "" mean?  I've never herd of over as a procedure and I don't see EG anywhere.."
,traypalazax,2011-01-25T21:48Z,"Can somone help me. I have everything I need, But no one to tell me details. Their just telling me to copy stuff, but not where to put it. 

I have every file from the torent extracted, installed, and in the game directory. Even the dll. I'm trying to get past the Key entry window.

Please help...."
,Insomneac,2011-01-25T22:17Z,"""EG:"" is an abbreviation for ""Example"". 

Anyway, I'll try again.

You extract from ISO's from the rar files, they are named ""TVM_BLGOTY1.iso"" and ""TVM_BLGOTY1.is2"".

Then you mount the first DVD ISO ""TVM_BLGOTY1.iso"" in a virtual drive and install the game as you usually would.

When it asks you for DVD2, then un-mount the first DVD and mount the second ""TVM_BLGOTY1.is2"" so the installation finishes.

Once it has, then update the game with the 1.41 patch on the second DVD in the ""Update 1.41"" folder.

Then copy over the contents of the TRIVIUM folder ""Binaries"" ""WillowGame"" and ""LanguageChanger.bat"" over to where you have the game installed.

The default installation path is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Gearbox Software\Borderlands GOTY Edition

That's where you copy the crack files to.

When it asks you to overwrite, click Yes.

The game should now start and run.

BTW, if you don't know what a virtual drive is, then use Google for information."
,traypalazax,2011-01-26T02:07Z,"Wow that was what I needed. The 2Kgames is the game directory in programs. I don't Know why I did'nt see it before. As soon as I followed all the instructions, it worked. Thanks, Insomneac,

Tray :)"
,Insomneac,2011-01-26T07:27Z,"You're welcome, I'm glad it's sorted.

Have fun playing, it's an awesome game."

,Strokey_22,2011-02-25T14:16Z,"Ok. I have installed the game and followed all the steps as said by Insomneac, but I still can't seem to get it to work at all. 

The problem being when I copy the contents of the TRIVIUM folder into the game dir, it hits me with a trojan. And I get a message popping up saying that the file 'paul.dll' could not be written over.

I have McAfee anti-virus software, which I have turned off or changed the firewall etc, but it just still wont work. I have cracked many other games no problem so I am fairly used to getting these games going, but I'm struggling here!

Any more help or advice would be greatly appreciated as I love this game. Cheers."
,jfrench,2011-03-01T00:06Z,okay so the download was super fast it installed flawlessly i copied over the patch and ive been playing. but i tired to play all of the dlc's and they start to load and they never do and when i minimize the game and try to go back to play it asks me for a serial key. did i do something wrong?

,Millerdis100,2011-03-08T17:05Z,"Insomneac is right!

,SnakeskinD,2011-08-24T03:25Z,"Wicked download here, works like a charm once you figure out where everything goes, i can see why ppl are having trouble with this.
this is how i did it:-

1 - Mounted disc 1 with deamon tools and started the install.
2 - Mounted disc 2 when prompted.
3 - When the page about th serial comes up, just cancel it. (needs to be done 4 times, i guess for each DLC??) and th install will finish.
4 - with disc 2 still mounted, open it (explore) to find the trivium folder and 1.41 update.
5 - copy ""paul dll"" from th binaries folder inside the trivum folder to the game install folder.
6 - Install 1.41 update.

The main game should now work.

As for th DLC's....

Inside the trivium folder, is a willowgame folder that contains all th cracked DLC maps. to get the DLC's to work, you have to copy the cracked maps to th main install folder and overwrite. only then, will the dlcs work.

Hope this helps ease some of th confusionbecause this torrent is awesome."
