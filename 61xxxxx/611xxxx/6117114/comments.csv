,sephi09,2011-01-21T10:39Z,Thank you everyone who is downloading this right now.  This is my first upload so I hope I did not make any mistakes.  I plan to have one of the books available by January 28th if everything goes according to plan.  If anyone has ideas about what I can do better please post a comment or email me at dejima42@yahoo.com.  I can also go into more details on what I plan to do to make copies of the books if anyone wants to know more.

,sephi09,2011-01-21T23:07Z,I actually bought a few of my math books from India.  I really wish there were better mathematicians in America or at least within our education system.
,indiaman,2011-01-22T05:09Z,"Thanks sephi09 for this upload.We in India refer quite a lot of books by American authors viz.Resnick Halliday,Thomas'Calculus,Stewart's Calculus,Beer Johnston etc.just to name a few and they are excellent whereas our Indian books are quite stale in comparison.All countries have some great teachers and many pathetic teachers.The story is the same everywhere."
