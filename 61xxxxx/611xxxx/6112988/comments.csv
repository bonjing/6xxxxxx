Come on people write some comments for this awesome upload from dinumatrix.

Keygen worked fine.

I would say I got a 20% increase in performance on XP SP3. Had to keep running it as it recommends only fix 1000 entries at a time. I had to run it 3 times.

btw. I ran the free Auslogics and it missed 1000s of bad entries.

It has backup and compression, so you cannot mess up the registry."

,zeprider1,2011-02-06T05:46Z,"Yes, that's pretty much how all keygens are seen as. Check out the reg snapshot before and after downloading programs. It taught me a lot."
