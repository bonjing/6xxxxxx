,kratol,2011-06-16T05:42Z,you should always put 720p or 1080p in the torrent tittle of a HD encode
,truthy,2011-08-18T01:42Z,BS. 1024x424 is neither 1080p nor 720p. Although the res is HD and not SD - it's a custom resolution. The closest would be a mixture between XGA (1024x768) and 480p (720x480). So if anything at all you should put HD or 480p in the title.
