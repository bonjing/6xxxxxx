The Rally for Relief was held to raise money for the Queensland Floods that have affected up to 75% of Queensland. I thought I could share this very special event.

Note: This video is in .flv and I thought I wouldn't convert it because it is already not the greatest quality. It is watchable though. Not happy? Don't download. You can use VLC Media Payer to watch this.
