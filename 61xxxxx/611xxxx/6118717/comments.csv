,tessseract,2011-01-22T17:13Z,Very good torrent. And a good song. +1 seed from me :) BTW two of the trackers seem to be offline. Don't know if it's just location or the trackers themselves.
,stunizzle,2011-02-14T03:16Z,"There's a few things wrong with this torrent.  At 0:09 there's a quick hiss, and at 2:55 somebody has dubbed themselves a quick shout.  Annoying and dumb.  You'll see.  Great song though."
,nikkymadd,2011-02-14T04:05Z,"The hiss at 0:09 is a noise from the youtube video, which this is likely ripped from. The shouting is just annoying, and not part of the video at all."
