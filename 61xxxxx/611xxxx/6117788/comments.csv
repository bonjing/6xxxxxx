When I installed 1.1.5 it only took up 76.7 meg so to my thinking even with the skins it should only be about 100 meg. Am not calling uploader into doubt as this is a trusted uploader, but am trying to educate myself here."

If you just download the file and stop asking maybe you would be able to educate your own self. Load it to your torrent and you will notice that the actual player is only 100MB. The skins uses 36MB, and if this is too big for your small brains then don't download it. Period."
