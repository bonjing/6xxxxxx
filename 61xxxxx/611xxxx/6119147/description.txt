David Garrett
Rock Symphonies (2010)

The child of an American mother and a German father, prodigy violin soloist David Garrett, born David Bongartz in Aachen, Germany, reached and surpassed many an important milestone before his matriculation at Juilliard in New York. David's interest in violin began at the age of four, when his older brother received a violin from his father -- who himself was a antique stringed-instrument dealer. 
A year later, David had already won a competition, and by seven he was playing in public as often as possible. Within five more years, David had gone on to perform with an orchestra (playing Mozart) and at the age of ten made his concert debut. As his teenage years dawned, David had already released two albums and appeared on television. This kind of talent was quickly picked up by Deutsche Grammophone, which offered and signed a contract with the violinist when he was only 14 years old. He graduated from Juilliard in New York in 2004, after having been a student with Itzhak Perlman. David Garrett has performed with many of the world's orchestras, and in 2007 he played with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, touring the United States with the orchestra in 2008. In 2009 he released a self-titled album on the Decca label. The varied repertoire included music from Bizet, a version of â€œDueling Banjosâ€ plus a cover version of Michael Jacksonâ€™s â€œSmooth Criminalâ€. A year later he returned with Rock Symphonies, an album featuring material from Nirvana, Guns â€˜Nâ€™ Roses, and Metallica.

After a self-titled release that flirted with pop crossover, violinist David Garrett dives deep into that world with his 2010 effort, an album that rocks like its 1766. Most arrangements are simple as Garrett takes the melodies from Nirvanaâ€™s â€œSmells Like Teen Spirit" and Led Zeppelinâ€™s â€œKashmirâ€ and plays them furiously in front of an equally aggressive orchestra thatâ€™s augmented by electric guitars and a standard rock kit drummer. No great revelations to be had, but the tracks work well enough, recasting some of rockâ€™s classics as Romantic-era works that are prime for television commercials designed to sell diamonds or wine to the post-Woodstock set. Rock Symphonies exceeds its predecessor when it comes to the more clever cuts, such as the â€œVivaldi vs. Vertigo,â€ a mash-up of Vivaldiâ€™s Four Seasons and U2â€™s â€œVertigo.â€ Fun how â€œThe 5thâ€ messes with Beethovenâ€™s -- heck, classical musicâ€™s -- most famous piece and how his take on â€œWalk This Wayâ€ references the Aerosmith and Run-D.M.C. version before turning into a fiddle-led hoedown. Keep in mind, the showy Garrett is a polarizing figure in the classical community, so donâ€™t expect your snootier friends to agree, but if your kids spend way too much time behind the violin, this just might turn them on to rock & roll.
