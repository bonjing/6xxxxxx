Because what you want to do there is actually describe what's in your torrent and how to use it.  Lots of people tend to fail to give proper specific instructions routinely, and it confuses many people when they just have to poke around trial and error.  

Plus which, there are many key issues frequent users would like addressed that really ought to be, such as is this torrent immune to the target program's invasive forced autoupdates?  This has particularly been a problem for Trillian Astra, whose ugly color schemes force people to seek alternative IM services.  "

Of course, this is also an archived torrent, which utterly decimates its validity.  Why hide things in a RAR?  What's in there you don't want us to see?  Guess we'll never know.  "
