- Did Baby Doc Duvalier Return to Haiti to Pressure PrÃ©val in the Election?

We speak to journalist Kim Ives, editor of Haiti LibertÃ©, about former dictator Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier's return to Haiti. Ives argues Duvalier's presence will allow the United States and France to install their preferred candidate in a run-off election set for February against the wishes of President RenÃ© PrÃ©val. The international community has threatened PrÃ©val with exile if he does not comply with their interpretation of the disputed results of last November's election. "PrÃ©val, after bowing to U.S. and French and Canadian dictates over the past decade of his presidencies, is now finding out that once he begins to resist a little bit or try to do something his way, that he's going to be quickly dispensed with," Ives says.

Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish was a well-known Palestinian gynecologist who spent years working in one of Israeli's main hospitals. On January 16, 2009, two days before the end of Israel's brutal 22-day assault on Gaza, his home was shelled twice by Israeli tanks. His three daughters and his niece were killed. He has just written a book about his life called I Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor's Journey on the Road to Peace and Human Dignity. He joins us in our studio for an extended conversation.
