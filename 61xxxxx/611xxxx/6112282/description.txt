Drummer Heath Johnson and songwriter Chris Hatfield met in the early winter of 2000. In spite of an initial prolonged and continuing mutual distaste for one another, the pair joined with guitarist Denis Blount to form Army/Navy, releasing a 2002 EP and 2004 full-length for Suburban Sprawl Music. After the release of Army/Navy's self-titled LP, the trio elected to part ways; Johnson joined local rock and roll titans Mr. Sinister and got a divorce, Blount elected to relocate to Manhattan to pursue a career in acoustic design and consultation, while Hatfield remained in Michigan to attend graduate school and join Those Transatlantics, another erstwhile Suburban Sprawl Music act.

After an extended period of time in Those Transatlantics, Hatfield became dissatisfied with the group's pace and inability to capitalize on its potential, so armed with a glut of unrealized songs and ideas, he approached Johnson about rekindling their musical partnership. The pair proceeded to build a recording studio in Johnson's basement and once again embarked on making music together with the caveat that they would not release anything until both were firmly satisfied with the results. Two years later, they came away with an album they could both agree that neither party was happy with. Luckily, both Hatfield and Johnson moved to opposite coasts of the US before any solution could be found regarding their recordings, and thus many months were spent sending mixes back and forth while the appropriate revisions were made. Recorded in Michigan and mixed at studios in both San Francisco and New York City, 'Phenomenomenons' is the culmination of years of collaborative effort between Johnson and Hatfield, along with mixing engineer and former bandmate, Denis Blount.

Currently, Hatfield resides in Oakland, California and is writing and performing with the newest incarnation of Love Axe, and Johnson makes his home in Charleston, South Carolina, pursuing musical outlets with his own variant of Love Axe. The two continue to collaborate on musical projects via electronic correspondence and mutual distrust.
