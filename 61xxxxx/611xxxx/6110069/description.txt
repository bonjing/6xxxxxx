WORKS BEST ON SLIM MODELS!!!! FATS WILL BE BRICKED!!!!
ESPECIALLY 60GB MODELS ARE 100% BRICKED
i tested all of this with no problems on a 250gb slim!!!
also tested on a 80gb cechl01 all worked fine including backup with multiman 1.12

what i did to install and make work
1.usb to hold files...256 mb or bigger
2.put the OFW 3.55 inside /PS3/UPDATE/ MUST BE ALL CAPS
3.flash it from update in your XBM
4.put the geohot 5 mb update in the same place as the original update replacing the 170+mb file
5.update again to geohots
6.put multiMAN for 3.55 unzipped onto the root of your usb drive.
7.install the multiMAN from the XBM pkg installer under GAMES
8.put the contents of PS3_CFW_355_WANINKOKO in that same update folder on your usb. must be named PS3UPDAT.PUP replacing the Geohot update...the 170mb one not the 33mb one...
9. enjoy. multiMAN should work just fine
i backed up my COD: Black Ops and it worked!!!!!
remember after every update to reboot by powering off then back on after 10 seconds off

YOU STILL NEED A DISK IN THE DRIVE.

Waninkoko wonâ€™t have you waiting any longerâ€¦ The infamous hacker in black dishes a full serving of PS3 custom (or modified) firmware; and by full serving I mean all your homebrew, including support for Backup Manager! Thatâ€™s what youâ€™ve been asking for, right?

How to install PS3 Custom Firmware v3.55

1. Download PS3 Firmware Update (OFW) 3.55
2. Install (or restore) OFW 3.55
3. Patch the OFW 3.55 PS3UPDAT.PUP using â€œbsdiffâ€ / â€œbspatchâ€

bspatch PS3UPDAT.PUP PS3UPDAT-CFW.PUP CFW_v3.55.patch

4. Confirm the resulting PUP has the md5 sum of 6eab7f1deea1ed46a1dc9924fd7080b3
5. Rename and copy the patched PUP to a USB storage device: /PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP
6. Flash it from Settings -> System Update (or the Recovery Menu if you need to)

Tools will be available on github soon. See README.txt for more info.

Update: Uh ohâ€¦ Waninkoko speaks up: â€œDo NOT install in Slim consoles! Looks like users are reporting bricking issues. Thatâ€™s weird as the CFW was tested on both models.â€

Iâ€™m testing it now. Please standby.

Update: Well, on my Slim the installation went a-okay! That said Iâ€™ve uploaded the patched PUP for you. And I can also confirm that multiMAN, as a Backup Manager, works with no problem. I should mention I updated from geohotâ€™s jailbreak; I already had multiMAN installed under that (for those wondering why it wonâ€™t install under Waninkokoâ€™s CFW).

Update: There have been many brick reportsâ€¦ Some fat models, some slimâ€¦ Many variables come into play when patching LV2. So right now, itâ€™s like this: If you really, really want backups, then give it a shot, just know the risks involved â€” you could end up with nothing in the end. Otherwise I recommend you buy your games and jailbreak only for homebrew purposes.
