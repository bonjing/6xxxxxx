Rufus Hound invites comedians to revisit their formative years by dusting off their teenage diaries and reading them out in public for the very first time. Will they experience the warm glow of nostalgia or the hot flush of embarrassment?


An 'intimate BBC radio comedy show' in which Rufus Hound gave comedians the chance to revisit their formative years by dusting off and reading out in public "their hormone-fuelled angst-ridden diaries".

Before they begin, the performer puts their diary excerpt into context by recounting the back-story and revealing how old they were when the extract was written, what year it was written and why it makes them cringe.

The series has a strong biographical element, unearthing hidden gems from the guest's life and revealing intimate details of their teenage experiences and personality.
