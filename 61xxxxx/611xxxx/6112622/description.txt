
This is the song from the film Rocky 4 which is sung by John Cafferty. This is the song which I love the most.


This song appears in the film after Adrian meets Rocky in Russia. She says she will stick with Rocky no matter what the outcome of the fight with Drago.


And this is where Rocky finally gets the edge he needed to win the fight. Remember also in Rocky 2 that Adrian told Rocky that she wanted only one thing from him - to win the fight against Apollo Creed.  


The song starts with Rocky skipping and it ends with Rocky on top of a mountain screaming Drago! Drago!



Rocky 4 is the most financially successful film in the Rocky franchise.
