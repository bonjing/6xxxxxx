ACTA NUMERICA - Numerical Analysis Journal - COMPLETE (1992-2010) [MYRIAD]



MYRIAD present the world's most math cited journal - now every back issue



Acta Numerica only has a few articles in each issue - but they are almost all

long surveys of some area of numerical analysis, approximation theory and 

mathematical computation, written by a leading researcher.



We previously released a couple of torrents with some issues in them, but now

for the first time on bittorrent is the complete journal from start to end.



This is one of the most prestidious and influential journals, covering one

of the widely studied subjects, right on the border of pure and applied math.

If you are working in any related field, there is surely a paper here for

you to read through at length and learn from the masters.



The most cited papers for these journal, some of them among the most cited

papers of all time, all of which are included in the torrent, are:



* Numerical solution of saddle point problems

 Michele Benzi, Gene H. Golub and JÃ¶rg Liesen

* The immersed boundary method

 Charles S. Peskin

* Nonlinear approximation

 Ronald A. DeVore

* Discrete mechanics and variational integrators

 J. E. Marsden and M. West

* A new version of the Fast Multipole Method for the Laplace equation in three dimensions

 Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin

* Finite elements in computational electromagnetism

 R. Hiptmair

* Splitting methods

 Robert I. McLachlan and G. Reinout W. Quispel

* Semidefinite optimization

 M. J. Todd

* An optimal control approach to a posteriori error estimation in finite element methods

 Roland Becker and Rolf Rannacher

* Wavelet and multiscale methods for operator equations

 Wolfgang Dahmen



There are approx 120 papers, plus some of the front and back covers of the 

journals which we included for completeness. We haven't archived anything 

this time, because of the small number of files. So people can pick out the

individual papers they want, as long as the torrent stays alive.



The complete list is in the file 'filelist' or on the web at:

myriadwarez@gmail.com for requests, love and any other comments

Greetz to all the people that emailed already - we're glad MYRIAD helped you



If you belong to any private trackers that MYRIAD releases could belong on

- especially ones for textbooks or other academic materials - send us the

details, and invites if you've got 'em.



If you want to get hold of some of the material we're releasing, but you can't

use bittorrent because of bandwidth/ISP/censorship, get in touch.

We will try and help you out.



Mad respect goes out to MANTESH for some great releases - keep 'em coming!

Thanks & love to f- for help getting us access to some of these papers

Props to the warriors of CHOOMSQUAD for releasing the last few torrents to tpb

We check back on all our torrents regularly - so if it's not seeded it will be again soon. Thanks for waiting!
