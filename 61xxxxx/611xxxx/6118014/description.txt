Rakka is a tool for handling multiple repetitions of a layer that can be animated along a mask path. Wiggle Stroke wiggles and repeats a stroke based on a mask path. Both plug-ins offer controls that allows for almost endless combinations to create anything from very basic animations to highly unique effects and background elements, even from just an ellipse or straight line mask path. Path Tools supports 32 bpc color (float). For more information, visit the website.

CFX Sphere Utilities
CFX Sphere Utilities is a set of four plug-ins designed to deal with spherical maps (equirectangular maps) commonly used to texture 3D spheres or as 3D environments. Animating layers and drawing lines on spherical maps are a breeze when Sphere Utilities handles the spherical transformations required. Animations can then be used directly in After Effects with CC Sphere, or any other plug-in that support spherical mapping, or in any 3D application. Spherical maps are also used as environment maps and for panoramic viewers, which are other sources where this kind of capability is important. Sphere Utilities supports 32 bpc color (float). For more information, visit the website.

Damage 2.0
The new standard for creating electronic defects in your footage. If you donâ€™t hold public office or if you havenâ€™t achieved pop stardom just yet, you may find it difficult to ruin your image without help. Damage is dedicated to simulating analog and digital errors and defects in your footage and it now includes two new effects: Destabilize and Overexpose.

Camera Mapper
Camera Mapper allows you to project your imagery onto multiple 3D layers to create breathtaking 3D matte paintings and expand a 2D image into full 3D perspective.

FreeForm
Included with After Effects CS5.

FreeForm 3D Mesh Warp
Only interested in warping, not displacing a layer in true 3D? 3D Mesh Warp adds a third dimension to what you already do with After Effectsâ€™ built-in Mesh Warp tool. Select how many rows and columns you divide the image into, then manipulate the control tangents to create cylinders, curves, ribbons, folding cards, an in finite amount of three dimensional shapes. Note that CS5 users do NOT need to buy this because CS5 includes all the functionality with FreeForm, which is included with After Effects CS5.

FreeForm 3D Displacer
Only interested in using a grayscale map to displace a layer in true 3D? 3D Displacer brings true three dimensional displacement mapping to After Effects. Displacement maps can of course be animated, adding e ffects like rippling water or blowing flags in full 3D perspective â€” no faking. Use mesh subdivision to raise and lower the density of your mesh, and anti-aliasing settings to work quickly and then switch to a fully refined result. Note that CS5 users do NOT need to buy this because CS5 includes all the functionality with FreeForm, which is included with After Effects CS5.

Falloff Lighting
Falloff Lighting provides an enhanced lighting system for After Effects built-in lights from one single menu command. Falloff Lighting acts much more like real world lighting. Reflected light naturally decays or â€œfalls offâ€ as surfaces increase distance from the After Effects light.

Aged Film
Turn back the clock with Aged Film and choose which era you set your shot. Priced at only $49, Aged Film is the best value for achieving this effect in todayâ€™s post production applications.

Atmosphere
Simulate atmospheric conditions such as haze and fog in your composition. Now you can add true 3 dimensional atmospheric falloff in After Effects from one single menu command. No more adding semi-transparent solids between your 3D layers to simulate fog or haze!

DIGITAL FILM TOOLS
Composite Suite Pro
Composite Suite includes visual effects plug-ins that were until recently, available only in-house at a Los Angeles film effects facility. The Composite Suite plug-ins include everything needed to combine multiple images: color correction, blur, grain, matte manipulation, and edge blending. The set features a well-rounded collection of compositing plug-ins such as Composite, Drop Shadow, Edge Composite, Holdout Composite, Light Wrap, Math Composite, Non-Additive Mix, and Optical Dissolve, as well as specialized tools for combining imagery such as fire, smoke, and explosions. There are also many indispensable and useful tools such as Glows, DVE, Matte Generator, Matte Repair, Film Masks, HDTV Masks, Grain, Blurs, Defocus, Distortion, Deartifact, a variety of color correctors, and Light! for creating natural lighting effects.

Power Matte
Power Matte is an easy to use interactive image matting tool capable of extracting almost any object in an image â€” even if you are dealing with fine hair detail, smoke, or reflections. This extraction process creates what is known as a matte â€” essentially a black and white cutout. White matte areas are extracted, black areas not, and gray areas in between represent a level of transparency. Once a matte is extracted, the foreground object can be seamlessly composed onto a new background as well as apply filter and image corrections only within the area defined by the matte.

Power Stroke
Designed with the creative workflow of colorists, film/video editors, graphic designers and artists in mind, Power Stroke introduces a simple, interactive stroke-based workflow to quickly and intuitively perform targeted adjustments. Instead of meticulously drawing exact masks, using inaccurate matte extractions or hand painting frame to frame, regions of interest are isolated by drawing a few simple and loose After Effects open or closed masks. Masks can be assigned multiple corrections and effects such as color correction, recoloring or desaturation, colorization of black and white images, blur, fill light for dimly lit image areas and diffusion/glow.

Zmatte
zMatte is a full-featured blue and green-screen keyer. Using proprietary matte extraction techniques and 16-bit processing, zMatte quickly and simply creates mattes with minimal parameters even if you are dealing with fine hair detail, smoke, or reflections. It is easy to use, yet provides the needed tools when faced with good, bad, or ugly shots â€” tools such as multiple matte creation, automatic spill suppression, sophisticated matte and edge manipulation, and color correction. Visit the website for more information and a free demo.

THE FOUNDRY
CameraTracker
The Foundry\'s camera tracker for After Effects allows you to pull 3D motion tracks and matchmoves without having to leave After Effects. It analyzes the source sequence and extracts the original camera\'s lens and motion parameters, allowing you to composite 2D or 3D elements correctly with reference to the camera used to film the shot.

You can now match camera moves within Adobe After Effects\' 2.5D environment, opening up new, robust options for the placement of composite elements, such as the creation of Fringe / Heroes style \'in scene\' titles, insertion of animated design elements, match-moved virtual set extensions, motion-tracked projection mapping and much more.

Kronos 5.0: GPU Accelerated Retiming
The Foundry has created a Hollywood quality CUDA GPU accelerated retiming plug-in based on their Academy AwardÂ®-winning FURNACE algorithms: KRONOS 5.0. Use KRONOS for retiming, speed-ramping, time-remapping and slow-motion effects, plus the addition of realistic motion blur.

Retiming is useful when you have to make something fit an allotted time segment, or want to creatively move in \"super slow-motion\".

Rolling Shutter
Rolling shutter effects are commonly found with video cameras employing CMOS image sensors, which record every frame line-by-line from top to bottom of the image, rather than as a single snapshot of a point in time.

As parts of the image are recorded at different times, fast-moving objects, or objects that pass quickly through frame during camera whip-pans, become distorted with diagonal skews. Other typical distortions include image wobbles created when cameras are hand-held, and exposure problems with flashing or strobing lights.

Along with being ungainly and unwanted, these image distortions also increase the difficulty of 3D tracking during VFX post production, as the tracking points themselves can be equally affected or not deliver accurate results.

Using Local Motion Estimation technology, we can individually correct parts of the image that are moving relative to the camera, even if they are moving in different directions or at different speeds.

RE:VISION EFFECTS, INC.
DE:Noise
Reduce noise using spatial and time-based (optical flow) methods.

Effections
Specially-priced bundled collections.

FieldsKit
FieldsKit provides smarter deinterlacing and more workflow options for interlacing and pulldown. At the heart of FieldsKit is FieldsKit Deinterlacer, which deinterlaces video imagery with superior results. Using proprietary field reconstruction and adaptive motion techniques, FieldsKit Deinterlacer can build full frames from fields that are of much higher quality than the standard approaches available in most effects and video-editing applications. FieldsKit works in both After Effects and Adobe Premiere.

PV Feather
Provides per-vertex feather control for After Effects.

RE:Fill
RE:Fill mends holes in images by intelligently filling user-specified regions. RE:Fill can replace missing pixels in numerous ways, for example, by selecting the nearest â€œgoodâ€ pixel, mirroring pixels around a hole\'s edge, or cloning from another â€œgoodâ€ region. And the good region can even come from another point in time or from another sequence altogether.

RE:Fill is a plug-in that works in both After Effects and Adobe Premiere.

RE:Flex
RE:Flex brings intuitive morphing and warping directly to After Effects 5.0 or later. Achieve superior results using proprietary and sophisticated technology. RE:Flex is especially easy to learn because it uses the host program\'s own drawing and masking tools to direct the warping and morphing, so there\'s no need to learn a whole new user interface.

RE:Flex, which uses RE:Vision\'s proprietary tracking software, is the first morphing program to combine hand feature matching with automatic image registration.

ReelSmart Motion Blur
Automatically add more natural-looking motion blur to a sequence using ReelSmart Motion Blur. RE:Vision\'s tracking technology is at the heart of ReelSmart Motion Blur, so no handwork is involved. Of course, you can add as little or as much blurring as you need, and even remove motion blur. Finally, you can create interesting effects by blurring one sequence by using the motion from another. ReelSmart MotionBlur is useful for the following:

Reduce strobing in sequences â€” particularly useful when frame rates of video are changed after digitizing. ReelSmart Motion Blur has fewer artifacts than other methods such as frame blending.
Automatically smooth the jerkiness of hand-drawn and scanned animations.
Motion-blur complex 3D animations when your 3D system takes too much time; in many cases, ReelSmart Motion Blur will be much faster and just as effective.
Motion-blur one sequence using another sequence\'s motion for unique effects.
Sharpen image sequences by removing motion blur.
Shade/Shape
Give your imagery volume and depth without the hassle of 3D modeling. ReelSmart Shade/Shape generates 3D models from your 2D graphical and picture elements using RE:Vision\'s powerful and proprietary shading-from-shape technology. The models are then lit and rendered in true 3D. Add further detailing to your 3D models by applying reflection and bump maps. As 2D elements merge and split in a sequence, ReelSmart Shade/Shape automatically merges and splits the geometry in an intuitive fashion. Features include automatic 3D model creation, 3D lighting and rendering, bump mapping, environment mapping, and stable and smooth-over-time shading produced for moving imagery.

SmoothKit
SmoothKit provides the ultimate filter set to smooth your imagery by combining user-directed controls and feature-sensitive methods.

This set of filters complements the basic blurs provided by host applications. SmoothKit\'s emphasis is precise control of the filtering process with no compromise on image quality. For example, SmoothKit has a â€œrealâ€ compound blur that exhibits no blocky artifacts. In addition to effects, the SmoothKit toolset can be used to reduce image defects in a much more intelligent manner.

Twixtor
Twixtor enables you to speed up, slow down, or use frame-rate conversion on image sequences with visually stunning results. To achieve its unparalleled image quality, Twixtor synthesizes unique new frames by warping and interpolating frames of the original. Features include:

Calculation of motion vectors at each pixel
Warping and interpolation of frames to â€œtime warpâ€ input footage
Smart processing of fields in the input and output as appropriate
Stretching of a sequence using a single scaling parameter
Keyframable retiming for complete control on a frame-by-frame basis
Frame-rate conversions made easy (supported only in After Effects)
Video Gogh
The Video Gogh plug-in transforms images and video into painted works of art. Video Gogh is different from other paint filters because it can actually track objects in movies for an unparalleled smooth result. Features include three styles of brush strokes, variably sized strokes, variable distance between strokes (so there can be empty space between strokes), and various translucent brushes. All of the brush stroke effects can be animated, with the ability to leave masked layers unaffected by special effects. Visit the website for more information.
