,Dominhiho,2011-10-27T14:52Z,"READ THIS!

Do not download this, it is a virus.
Shortly after installing I couldn't use task manager, my antivirus or command prompt. Anything that could rectify the problem was disabled."
,cinjaxon,2011-12-29T08:42Z,"Nope, doesn't work. Nothing but the basic regular free download from the website. You say that all these wonderful outputs are covered, but all there is is iZ3D, Anaglyph (Free), and ATi 3D DLP. I installed like you said (really the only way to) and right from the start that's it. It isn't a virus or anything, but no, it doesn't work."
