,divingbuddy,2011-02-07T01:19Z,How about the password for this download without having to give up personal information to some bullshit on-line crap?  If you're going to make someone jump through such stupid hoops AFTER they download your file...then put that in the description FIRST!
,cajunflavoredbob,2011-02-07T08:56Z,"@divingbuddy Are you retarded? It's an *.avi file. What password? Just double click it to play the file. Stop scaring people off from a good torrent, you moron.

@anyone else - This is a perfectly fine torrent. There is no password or anything. It's just a video file and that's it. Just download it a play; that's it; simple. Don't listen to idiots."
,divingbuddy,2011-02-07T13:32Z,"I wouldn't say retarded...just poor aim :D  When I make a mistake I admit it - my 'rant' was about season 2, episode 14 - but I did get the right 'author' - eztv - who did not respond to my post."
