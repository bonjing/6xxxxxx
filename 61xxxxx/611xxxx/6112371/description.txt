STORY
Tells the story of the man who became King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II. After his brother abdicates, George ('Bertie') reluctantly assumes the throne. Plagued by a dreaded stammer and considered unfit to be king, Bertie engages the help of an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Through a set of unexpected techniques, and as a result of an unlikely friendship, Bertie is able to find his voice and boldly lead the country through war.

IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:The Kings Speech scr - Demedic  ..... Thanks
AUDIO:The Kings Speech scr - Demedic ..... Thanks
Right first off thanks Demedic for the vobs  :) Now the source was really nice but did look a touch dull and needed some life added to it. So we made a script to change the colours, white balance, contrast, brightness, chroma and sharpness.... Then used that and vdub to rip the dvd....... Audio we just muxed back the 5.1 audio track. Overall v9 a9 .....Really nice screener
