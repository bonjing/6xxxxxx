Thanks for this n-101."

I generally prefer remasters, but I went to an audio recording school and tend to be picky.t I really enjoy there more popular hits, which is why I thought it would be great to hear them done remastered in Flac too!"

I think when Freddy died is when aids started to scare the world, so wild to think of the politics of those days and then hear the MUSIC just jam right on! Its sad how many people that still wont give this classic band the time of day, some things never change."
