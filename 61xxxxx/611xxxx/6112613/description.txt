The "unknown trainers" are finally revealed, and both will share 

their personal stories that led them to "The Biggest Loser." 

Their contestants, "the unknowns," confront one player they feel 

isn't working hard enough, and later, "the unknowns" and the 

ranch contestants square off for a pop challenge. The winning 

player from each group will get a delicious healthy dinner 

prepared by Chef Curtis Stone, and compete for a coveted 2 lb. 

advantage at this week's weigh-in. Later, Dr. Huizenga gives 

"the unknowns" startling news about their health, and one player 

is surprised to learn they have the highest percentage of body 

fat in the group. Meanwhile, trainers Bob Harper and Jillian 

Michaels single out a few of their contestants to find out what 

really led to their weight gain, and then the ranch contestants 

meet host Alison Sweeney for a water-carrying challenge that 

will give the winner the sole vote at this week's elimination. 

Later, a surprising weigh-in -- which results in shocking 

numbers for one team -- disappoints the trainers in a big way, 

leading to the elimination of one player they feel isn't ready 

to go home.
