---behold the wonder of GOOGLE ... anytime I have a question like that, I type into the Google search window ""How to play MKV files"" and hit enter & bingo you'll get a bunch of mostly easy-to-understand suggestions. (in this case they'll probably advise you to download VLC media player) ..."

--behold the wonder of INTERACTION!
I want to know something, and rather than sort through countless dead or misleading websites,
full of jargon I don't necessarily understand,
or full of spyware and adware,
I simply type my question and hit submit,
and alas!  Countless like-minded individuals
See my query, and my answer is eminent.
Communication is truly a wonderful thing!


but besides that, I have no idea how to play mkv's on a dvd player, i have the same problem on my ps3.  only option is to convert them to avi which is usually a pain in the ass.  I just end up hooking the video out on my lappy to the tv and doing it that way."
,chibwack,2011-02-02T08:17Z,...and by eminent i clearly meant imminent

@xeno100
i think mkv files are only supported on some blu ray players at the moment. haven't seen any dvd players that support it yet"
