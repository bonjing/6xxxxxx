EXCELLENT Above average quality!  And the foreign subtitles are indeed optional which I wondered about before downloading. In fact you can delete the sub file if you don't want them.

The best I've seen posted on one of my favorite movies, which I'm a huge fan of the Swiss one as well.

My only complaint is I wish those ripping the DVD would include the DVD extras.

Pros: Its 720p Bluray with great sound.

Cons: None, no different than the disk."

I suppose this is what the American Style is all about."
