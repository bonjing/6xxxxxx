,Dagda1123,2011-01-29T21:55Z,"The subtitles don't seem to work. Each time I unrar them all i get is the following gibberish: ¥õ©y¥õe¹á5e±ËVü                                                                  
I must be doing something wrong seeing as no one else is having this problem.                                                                                                                                                      "

1) try with VLC (who even uses any other player???) you can load any sub file separately even if it's named like your mother.

2) if the subs on the torrent are bad, GOOGLE to find other subtitle files that may work for you.

gosh..!!!"
