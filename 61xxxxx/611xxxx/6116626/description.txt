This modified executable will let you use MobilePC with _all_ your Garmin USB GPSs via USB, you don\\\'t have to buy GPS 10x or GPS 20x anymore!

Nincsene(x|z) (based on ProITM\\\'s idea)

I put the correct version in this mans hack.

But REMEMBER TO extract GarminMobilePC_50060.rar to harddrive then run main.msi only from harddrive only.

The program will just be chucked on C:/GarminMobilePC (or one of your drives).

Then overwrite with the Que.exe supplied. :)
