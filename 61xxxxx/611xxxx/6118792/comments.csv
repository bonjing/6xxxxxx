Why not write a left wing inspired and make a bunch of money and pass the lefi wing ideals when you are at it? The time of Olof Palme and the time whas right and Sweden ruled. Almost like Ellroy and his LA. Never mind those Beck movies though. ""Its dark, its raining, we have a minimum budget and the movie sucks methan"".  "
,diverdiva,2011-08-20T05:37Z,Thank you! This is the version read by Simon Vance - and if you have listened to the 1st 2 read by him you don't want to change readers! There is another version read by Saul Reichlin - not as good.
