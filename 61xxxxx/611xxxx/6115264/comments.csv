,lem_is_cool,2011-01-23T10:22Z,"Thanks a bunch, doesn't seem to be many torrents out for this. Hopefully I can run it easily."
,Morphined,2011-01-23T12:11Z,"1) Unpack rar somewhere.

2) Transfer the folder to the directory your backup manager uses (either Games, Gamez or some other)
2.a) PS3 doesn't digest NTFS, so you better use FTP transfer (install FileZilla on your PC and BlackBox FTP on the PS3)
2.b) If you have a nice and large external memory device with FAT32 file system, just copy it there, plug into your PS3 and use some kind of a file manager (MultiMan will do) to copy the game from usb to the folder your backup manager uses.

3) Launch your backup manager on PS3

4) Find your game in the list

5) Press LOAD.
5.1)Note that you sometimes need to have a legitimate blu ray inside the PS3

6) Exit to XMB

7) Launch the game that should be loaded by now and look like it's on the bluray you have inserted earlier.

8) Have fun!
8.1) If you have some crashes and hangups - don't panic. Pull of the cord from your PS3 and reinsert it. It happens every now and then, but it's totally fine."
,joolet88,2011-01-23T17:49Z,"Can't get it to work with kmeaw CFW 3.55. It says the gamedata i damage, and then the game close down.
And with the PKG file for 3.55 it says an error has  occurred."
,bajeezus,2011-01-23T20:14Z,"PS3 games aren't region locked, so Eurofags can use this too."
,bajeezus,2011-01-26T03:42Z,"On 3.55, Im loading in multiman, but when I hit play on the XMB icon, it just gives me an error message."
