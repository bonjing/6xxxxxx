The CBI delves into the world of professional fighting when Rigsby witnesses a body found at a mixed martial arts match. At first everyone who works in the arena is a suspect, but our team quickly finds out that there is a connection between the victim, Charlotte Mitchell, and one of the boxers, Manny Flacco: they were sleeping together. The gun used to kill Charlotte is also traced back to a gang murder in 1994. Either man may have done the deed.
