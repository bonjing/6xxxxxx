Synopsis:
A short time from now. . . Violent crime has risen five hundred
percent. One in ten people are hooked on heroin. One in five
people will be assaulted or murdered, and over twenty five percent
of the police force is dead or missing. For police Chief Ernie Lomax
(Johnny Andrews), one thing is dreadfully clear. . . There's a new
pusher in town; someone so vicious, so savagely depraved, that
bringing him down could launch the biggest bloodbath yet.
