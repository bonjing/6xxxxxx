ATTENTION!!!!-----These three files were compressed on a different computer and are out of sync part way in. Original file is gone, so can not redo. Very sorry for your waste of bandwidth. Just glad I caught it before doing more damage. Once again please accept my apology.**********************************************************************************************************------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------														 	http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6113938/Tavis_Smiley_20110118_TTL-------------										 	http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6113931/Ellen_Matt_Bomer_720p_20110118_TTL------------------																					 	http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6113904/Ellen_Jennifer_Lopez_Full-20110118_TTL--------------------																																This is for all the hard work Knallpus (http://thepiratebay.org/user/Knallpus/) has done. For everyone who has downloaded but never bothered to thank him even once, just once in a while would be nice. The MP3's are one continuous file ripped from the vob set at the same bitrate. Your choice: MP3 for each DVD or an ISO ready to burn with both files. 40 tracks on each MP3, 80 on the ISO.Fits nicely on one CD ready to play in any device that supports MP3 format CD's. Please share. Don't hit and run.
