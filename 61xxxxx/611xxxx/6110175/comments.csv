,Skibo12,2011-01-19T20:03Z,hey stop fucking using .idx subtitles DUMBASS use SRT
,arthaxerxes,2011-01-19T20:06Z,"Thanks for the upload. But I don't see any .sub files only .idx files in sub folder. Would you please upload .sub files? I tried some .srt files off the web but they're badly out of sync. 
"
,zkzkz,2011-01-20T10:28Z,"No subtitles. 
Subs folder has no .sub files to go with the .idx files.  Skip this one unless you can speak Swedish."

ENJOY ALL..!!!"
,Smietnikmoj,2011-01-22T07:28Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Unfortunately, some of us won't be able to enjoy the movie due to the subs.  The issue here is that those translations/subs are not for this version of the movie.  And trust me, I looked for others.  Once you try you will see the issue.

I just spent two hours trying to see how if I can somehow go around this issue by changing framerate or setting delays, but it's pointless due to a different text / audio combination."

,swemmel1971,2011-01-24T21:26Z,sorry about the double post but those subs work great with this copy on here. They are audio description subs tho.
,f.kruger,2011-03-12T08:32Z,"Thanks very much for the subs swemmel, they work at least. regards"

,k3rc4,2011-04-07T22:29Z,they dont work for me...
,MultiBethesda,2011-04-18T15:30Z,"Retards, try first, demand afterwards...

Just change the ixvid or what is was for a end file to .sub "
,stalker2755,2011-05-14T21:24Z,"Retard... those are not subtitle files to be renamed like that, only index files with time stamp to offset rules. This release is missing the sub files, the proper ones from the DVD."
,comp_jerk,2011-06-02T22:05Z,All d subtitle To The Given Links Are Deleted...PLease Help I Cant Find Subs
,darclee,2011-06-09T14:25Z,"anyone know where i can get the subs? just read the book, but can't watch the movie ......"
,jengiscan,2011-06-09T14:31Z,I have tried and tried and the subs just dont match up at all....makes it unwatchable ...thanks for the effort though.
,jengiscan,2011-06-09T14:37Z,Sorry to say guys but these subs and the issues surrounding them make this film unwatchable
,alex5813,2011-07-06T00:29Z,"The subs work, just not for this version. They work for the all-swedish version, which can be found here:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4224446/Arn.Tempelriddaren.2007.SWEDiSH.DVDRip.XviD-MoA"
,alex5813,2011-07-06T02:20Z,"Ok, that's weird. This film is a bizarre splicing of the two Arn movies, the Knight Templar and the Kingdom at Road's End. The subs work for the original Arn - Tempelriddaren, which can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4224446/Arn.Tempelriddaren.2007.SWEDiSH.DVDRip.XviD-MoA"
,hendo666,2011-07-14T14:13Z,"Filmed in my home town of Dunfermline, this should be pretty cool.Thanks to the uploader."
,NL_Pirate,2011-07-26T13:11Z,"Ok well the subs are non existent and/or don't work, its a pity because it spoils an otherwise good upload"
,PirateWizard,2011-09-02T06:55Z,I can't find working subs either.
,sendon,2011-09-20T20:39Z,thank u so much for this one
,EliasNord,2011-09-25T01:39Z,"THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FUCKING MOVIE! Would've been nice to know...

This is a merger between both films. The first ""The Knight Templar"" and the second one ""The Kingdom at Road's End""

Fucking retard. You have like both half films cut out. Lite every other scene!! Thank's a lot. Just spent 2 hours watching a FUCKING spoiler! Great job. DIN JĂVLA KUK!"
,KarpoofdaJulii,2011-10-10T22:32Z,".sub files here
http://d01.megashares dot com/?d01=Meujm5q
