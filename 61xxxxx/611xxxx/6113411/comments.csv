,jon4fun,2011-01-19T18:13Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

@ ALL - Please LOGIN (create an account if you do not have one) and click the [+] symbol beside QUALITY at top of page for ALL torrents you DL from 20-40. 
It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated for the genius that it is!

Cheers
Jon

@ 20-40 - thanks for The Daily Show, The CF Show, No Ordinary Family and V

@ jobinmat - please read comment from 20-40 on certain torrents last week (sorry I can't remember which one) but basically [REQUESTS ARE FROZEN]."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-19T19:07Z,"@juanitaho: There was NO difference. Numbers are the same. If someone is not capable to follow my instructions, repeated so many times (whoever has problems - HE/SHE has, not me) that my sanity was repeatedly compromised - can, should, must go direction [eztv].

They have single episodes.

Yesterday - my server was blocked by 54% of downloaders. They do NOT read, they do NOT think that I wish  them good, they do NOT care about - nothing.

They do not care about 97% Hit&Runs. I do.
They just want their TV shows and they want them fast.

REASON WHY downloads are fast is - me.
All other peers together, on ALL torrents upped yesterday, have not reached even 10% of my upload contribution... 2700 peers!

All other  peers together, on most popuĂÂar torrent yesterday SHARED silly percentage of the bytes given by other peers.

To be more understandable - of 10 bytes they got they share - ONE. Fucking disgrace - of P2P, of whole idea of sharing.

Grab. Run. Give nothing.

And now I am eager to listen about fucking complaints and ready to take requests... LOL "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-19T19:31Z,"To clarify further: SHARING is The Core of torrents.
SHARING is NOT just seeding - sharing IS about sharing the bytes given. How (and from where, from whom) for fuck's sake people get bytes? From OTHER downloaders - in general - NOT from the seeders alone. Seeders are by-product, an extension of generosity, a PUMP which role is only to let fresh bytes in.

Currently, we (I) have like 34 people who share everything and 174 who share as best they could. Who doesn't understand me - but know what is right and what is wrong. Who cannot stop wandering about many things here.

 And gazillion of zombies who give a flying fuck.

If bytes are poured to hard-fisting crowd - (not passed-by to other fellow peers) it has the same effect as pouring a water in some godforsaken desert. NONE."

,odyssey09,2011-01-19T20:24Z,Thanks for V!
,azrielle,2011-01-19T21:40Z,"One POSSIBLE solution, twentyforty, might be Opera Unite, which requires sharing ""public"" key to trusted souls only.  Or NeilDiamond's private torrent club, or something similar.  Or allowing re-seeding of some of your conversions by....us.  Thanks for InSecurity, SVU, No Ordinary Family, Silent Witness, and Good Wife."
,WooZism,2011-01-19T21:51Z,Thanx for Insecurity and V and all your hard work and dedication!
,dark_defender,2011-01-19T21:59Z,"@All: Come on people, pay some heed to the words of this great man(twentyforty). He who only wants to help us is shouting like anything only to see he is not heard. WTF !!

I am not boasting but let me tell you, i still seed torrents downloaded from him even weeks ago. I do a check and see which torrent has less seeders and i open that torrent for sharing, especially ones not that popular. Even if i am not downloading sometimes i make sure my torrent is open and i am seeding to max.

But i do have my limitations. My max speed is 60 kbps. I try to do my best. I wish i had more bandwidth to share."
,dark_defender,2011-01-19T22:03Z,"Open your torrent client and see how much have you downloaded and uploaded in last 31 days. If you fall short in uploading then open your fucking limit for sharing to unlimited.

If you think what i said about myself is not true then i would be happy to share a screenshot."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-19T23:43Z,"@dark_defender: Thanks for support. As many people know for years, I do not use capitalization (capital letters) as shouting (people get this from forums and such) - but as an emphasizing the word - it's like someone pay additional ""care"" saying some spoken word, more clearly than others and maybe with slightly increased tone - that's all. However I know how to swear and if I really ""shout"" - people would know that for sure.

Second thing is something that each of you, people with ""faces"" seems not to understand quite right: problem is not in three dozen people like you - carriers of stupid disease mentioned here are people without faces, anonymous majority - and you are over-runned and over-crawdad by them and by factor of thousand and more. As you, people with ""faces"" are over-stretched by mission impossible - trying to fill cracks made by others, seeding dozen or more torrents even if your upload speed is low, to star with. 

Therefore, I tried many times with different approaches - explaining to my ""regulars"" that seeding like that do more harm than good for many reasons. I would mention few: seeding as single seeder with 1, 2, 3 or even 10 kB/s keep some torrent alive - but other side (downloaders) need ages for actual download. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-19T23:45Z,"...to continue:


After let say 48h comes sort of Halloween - Hit&Runners, almost exclusively, these are the people who stumbled upon some title, they took what they need and go. They do not know who to fuck we are, you, me, torrents, bytes or what is all about. They simply doesn't care about anything but their needs and their image in their own mirror. This is overwhelming majority.

And therefore I spoke about sharing - DURING THE DOWNLOAD because this is the biggest problem here. Individual UL speeds become irrelevant - 186 peers (but they have not, as on popular HIMYM torrent just yesterday) CAN REACH 1000 Kb/s exchange without problems (and was 117 kB/s) - and that way efficiently and transparently share the bytes they have, flow of data moves all peers up, fast and easy till 100%. That is what is missing here.

What they do next - strangely for those who doesn't understand torrents correctly - would they stay as seeder or not - doesn't mean as much as people think.
Flow of bytes - exchange - that's the bottom line of torrents. If people care about shared content - they could decide to stay as seeder and that way share personal joy and enthusiasm  with others."
,justregged,2011-01-20T02:03Z,Thanks for V again :)
,verazationable,2011-01-20T02:08Z,Thanks for The Good Wife
,dark_defender,2011-01-20T02:48Z,"@twentyforty: Sorry for mentioning your CAPS as ""shouting"". Din't really put a thought behind this.

Anyways i do comprehend now what you are trying to tell. Sharing and downloading should happen simultaneously and thats what we should promote."
,dark_defender,2011-01-20T02:49Z,"@All: Share the shit out of your torrents while downloading - Keep your upload speed to unlimited.

Do not remove your torrent after download till the share ratio is justified.

Register yourself and get a name. Appreciate the work and support the cause. The cause which is going to benefit you only at the end of the day."
,DMVIN,2011-01-20T04:02Z,"thnx 20-40
cud u pls do white collar from next week?"
,Ataractic,2011-01-20T04:52Z,"Thanks a lot for insecurity. will seed for 2 weeks, at least."
,funpigj,2011-01-20T05:07Z,"Hey 20, thx for the upload.  I appreciate the TVPacks btw, for me it makes keeping things straight.  Anything from you (easily identified by TVPacks) I leave up until I get a decent share ratio.  Last nite I screwed up and deleted a couple of torrents before I should have b/c I forgot you upped outside the packs.

In any case, thanks again!"
,thangcuoi,2011-01-20T06:06Z,"@twentyforty In argument for single file per torrent, a torrent life is very much like nature's natural selection process. If it's a good torrent and popular, it will stay alive for a long time due to the dedication of the fans who want to share the love. Where as the torrent pack life is only a few weeks as most people do not download the whole torrent and hence not able to keep it alive.

You already know it yourself, you can't change people. There is nothing you can do to force the hit-n-run people to seed more on a public tracker like TPB. Hence, the goal forward should be to keep your hardwork alive as long as possible. I would suggest at the end of every six months, go back and have a look at the stats of the individual show and put them together into a season pack.  Those are likely to stay around for years to come."
,ladderman22,2011-01-20T06:51Z,thanks for insecurity!
