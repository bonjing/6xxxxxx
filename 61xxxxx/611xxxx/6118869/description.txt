**windows only, not MAC**
i have added just 2 files to a DYNAMICS download, the dll and the README.
The download i got had no fix but I found one (the dll) elsewhere and now you can 
update to v2.1 I tried without the fix and then ..Poof, walla, no licence! oouchh.
now i'm updated and the program runs again. hurrahh.

here's the files in this package:
BFD2.dll
BFD2_2-1-0-47_Update_Win.exe
bfd21_whatsnew.pdf
dynamics.nfo
file_id.diz
README.txt

enjoy!
