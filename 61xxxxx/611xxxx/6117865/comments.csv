[T],MitZep,2011-01-23T05:19Z,"@jamydoug yu request the same movies to  me and 20-40 like yur african queen i had downloaded half of the source when 20-40 uploaded his copy....
i dont want duplicate work pls request to others nly if i reject and vice versa...."
,ThaGoatMan,2011-01-23T06:16Z,"Thank you brother for accepting the request,your work is much appreciated. "
,jamydoug,2011-01-23T07:49Z,"@MitZep: So u are not gonna do AQ??? i was badly waiting to take it from u and now you say lik this!!:(

Can u atleast do ""American Gangster (2007)"" in 720p
Am requesting it to you only and seriously i do love your movies!!"
[T],MitZep,2011-01-23T08:30Z,"@jamydoug no im not doing african queen now as 20-40 has done it and like yur request for the jerk yu have requested it to everybody me , 20-40, herakler.. only request to one uploader  and request to other only if they don't do it and american gangster has been done by gunnersrock i think so pls search for the movies and request only if no one has done the movie or the quality isnt that good... this applies to everyone
don't feel bad abt it jamydoug but be more vigilant next time.... "
,DevSIN,2011-01-23T09:15Z,"this is one good thriller...
already hav riddlerA's print... 
a must watch movie.... "
,jamydoug,2011-01-23T10:32Z,"@Mitzep: Your point is a valid one!
 But the rip by gunnersrock is a bit more grainy for such a size(checkd the screenshots!!)..but it'd be nice if u do it again with the file size around 1-1.2gb wit a bit more extra bitrate!!

just a suggestion.."
,jamydoug,2011-01-23T10:40Z,"@MitZep: Can u do ""There Will Be Blood""  in 720p too?? There is no proper BRRip of this movie is small size!!"
[T],MitZep,2011-01-23T10:54Z,"@devsin yes this movie is gud
@jamydoug was already doing there will be blood and wll now also do american gangster in best possible quality.... "
