.Originally issued in 1995 on Zulu   .
.Records, A Lifetime Away ended up to.
.be one of the best kept secrets in  .
.trip-hop. An undeniable masterpiece,.
.the album offers some of the best   .
.beats and female vocals I have ever .
.heard in trip-hop. The album has an .
.distinctive ethereal atmosphere that.
.is as suitable to late night trips as
.any of its Bristol counterparts.    .
.Someone can hardly imagine a song   .
.that is more sexadelic than \\\"Virgin\\\".
.or \\\"Contact\\\". This is pure pleasure .
.for the ears, and there is also a   .
.fair share of clever lyrics scattered
.through the 13 songs. A Lifetime Away
.is a must-have not only for PT fans,.
.but for anyone who likes trip-hop at.
.least a bit. An album that shouldn\\\'t.
.be ignored.                         .
