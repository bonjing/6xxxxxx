Teenage Panzerkorps
German Reggae (2011)

Formed in 2001, TEENAGE PANZERKORPS aka DER TPK split members between San Francisco and Berlin and Aachen, Germany. They gather semi-annually to record their primitive post-punk jams on cassette. Their music is often described as â€œkraut punkâ€, a mix of crude Neu! rhythms, blown-out guitars and bass, fuzz organ with vocalist Bunker Wolf ranting in German. The band takes obvious influence from early 80â€™s art punk (Minimal Man, Factrix, Savage Republic, Chrome) & California hardcore blurred into a lo-fi drone.
