[V],globeplus,2011-01-21T09:03Z,"To whaleoilbeefhooked : believe on the uploader , ok ? the picture is absolute normal and getted a smart brightness application to clean completly the picture , after the copy from the dvd is getted the picture can get a little dark personality or little residual particles on the background of the movie depending on the copy or the dvd program to get the copy or the type choosed to make the rip , applying a clean after the dvd rip work is the perfect thing to really have the picture 100% ok , more as possible , so what it is the correct procedure to get a nice copy from a dvd : 1Âº - using a dvd program with a nice type of movie to make the rip then (2Âº) applying correctly a slight correction on the picture to get the best clean picture possible and with this 2 steps you get youÂ´re perfect dvdrip , so if you ask me only the ripping it is enough ? to watch the movie certainly but to got the perfection on the copy the ideal is applying plugins correcting small things on the picture after the ripping and then you get an absolute normal copy in everything , it is just a little work more but still worthy in order to get the best clean picture possible .

,Shoobox,2011-01-22T20:47Z,"Once again a cam listed as a dvdrip.
@Globe, 
 converting someone else's shitty cam to an ever more horrible shitty cam doesn't make it a dvdrip you twat!!!"
,MakMan06,2011-01-25T11:11Z,"Downloaded this thinking Globe does a good job with games, why not with movies? Wrong. This release is complete ARSE. It actually looks WORSE than the original cam. Do not download!

@Globe - Stick to what you do best, mate, games."
