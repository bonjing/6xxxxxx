Derren Brown is an English magician, illusionist, mentalist, painter and sceptic.

This includes every episode of all of his TV shows, all of his primetime specials, all of his books, and other misc videos he has appeared in

I have compiled all of these myself and organized them in a neat manner, and I have done my best to include everything i could find.

Note: To the best of my knowledge, there doesn't appear to be a rip of his 2007 Sci-Fi Channel series, "Mind Control With Derren Brown" (which aired here in the states) anywhere online. If you find it, or you have it and you're willing to upload it, let me know so I can include it!
