"Some Like It Hot"

NTSC Widescreen. Not Rated B/W

This is for you classic movie buffs, A movie about a hot dame 

and two dudes in drag. Starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and 

Jack Lemon

This is not a DVD rip but a image file of the actual DVD so it 

includes menus and an interview "Nostalgic Look Back" with Tony 

Curtis, some 'never seen before' photos of the stars and behind 

the scenes images. And a few other things I am too lazy to list.

Bit it is complete and unaltered.

I just found the DVD un-opened and it went directly to my PC for an 

image copy.


Edit; Usually I scan and post the DVD cover on Bayimage to show 
on the torrent page but NOOOO Bayimage has issues.
So I included the scanned cover image as part of the torrent.
