,adrwblr,2011-01-22T03:19Z,"This is EPISODE 12. The LAST SINGLE EPISODE was 1 hour long and was episode 11. Just because it was 1 hour does not make it 2 episodes. Thank you, fix it."
,jakbarendse,2011-01-22T05:26Z,"@adrwbir
You're actually wrong mate, this episode is referred to as episode 13 in the production code. Hour long episodes are all counted as two episodes"
,Huntereich,2011-01-22T06:18Z,Thank you! Seeding all night.
,adrwblr,2011-01-22T06:59Z,"If it is 2 episodes, it still only has one name. The name of this episode is obviously Ultimatum. Episode 11 was Classy Christmas."
,cambellsoup,2011-01-22T09:43Z,"@adrwblr, NBC disagrees with you; look at their website. Classy Christmas has two production codes of 711 and 712. Do some research.
Thanks VTV."

yeah do some research fuck bean"
,thadream101,2011-01-24T06:44Z,imdb says this is ep. 12 and ep. 13 doesn't air til january 27th...thanks vtv
[T],MelloYello,2011-01-24T07:45Z,The Christmas episodes 11&12.  This is episode 13 dipshits.  The Office has done this before.  Have a 2 part and run them like one episode instead of running the theme song in between.  Anybody have Comcast?  Check on On Demand and you will see the episodes labeled part 1 & 2.  If you haven't noticed IMDB isn't 100% correct on all there info.  They do make corrections from time to time.
,KevMovieMan,2011-01-24T16:18Z,"IMDB says this aired on the 20th!!!! Yes technically the Classy Christmas was 2 episodes, seperate but could have been watched all together as one episode.

I have to believe this is right... I've had others tell me that the new ep aired, I missed it thinking it wasn't until next week but others have told me they've seen it."
,Ginlyf,2011-05-18T12:08Z,thanks! :D
