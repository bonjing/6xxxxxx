Watching fire is both exciting and dangerous. People love it. There is some pre-historic magic in fire. Fantastic Flame Screensaver delivers the excitement of a real-life fire experience direct to your computer desktop. Just leave your mouse for a while, sit back and watch. The desktop dims out and starts to glow ardent orange, creating a glorious effect along with the licking flames. The flames are curling up and dancing on the desktop icons and open windows as if they were wooden logs in the fireplace. It is also possible to bring up some awesome live flaming image onto the display. There are lots of nice samples (Zodiac signs, movie and game posters, Fantasy pictures) come included. Discover beautiful flames to relax by, with the cracking sound of a real fire and the melody of your favorite song.
