Fairly decent family movie...
Many Thanx to Hero_No_1 and WBZ for the Good rip and Thanx to all the seeders for quick download...
I'm not sure if it's just me but the audio on the people seems to be slightly out of sync but seems to be fine when the dogs speak...!!!"

,magicninjaboy,2011-01-28T19:48Z,dont download unless you want subtitles as sound is not working good try films there next time please add sound
