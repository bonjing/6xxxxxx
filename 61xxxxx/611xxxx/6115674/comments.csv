,Sgr76,2011-01-26T06:09Z,"I gotta say...After having a complete nightmare with Nero and Roxio, this program worked great for me. Thanks much bigman...."
,bigman1968,2011-01-26T10:41Z,"@Sgr76 ...
you right roxio is a fuckin pain in the ass, a fucking kick in the balls"
,hammerheadieaglethrust,2011-02-20T06:26Z,thank you!
,candela20m,2011-02-28T15:57Z,"I've tried Xilisof and Imtoo dvd creator, they work much much better than roxio shit, the problem is that when i have a few days off, the registration goes to the toilet.
Then i have uninstall the program and restore my pc to a point before first intalation, and then works again, a pain in the ass, doing this all the time, I'm thinking in buying the program it's worth it. Any comments and recomendations are welcome, fuckers!!"
,skijay,2011-03-04T18:09Z,"thankyou, works great"
,bigman1968,2011-03-05T16:30Z,YOU'RE VERY WELCOME

,bigman1968,2011-05-18T06:45Z,"if you are so fucking stupid and update thats your problem, works for me so fine till now, so dont be sO fucking stupid and, DO NOT UPDATE THE SOFTWARE."
,nosaj128,2011-08-20T00:29Z,"hey ""Bigman1968"" this nothing. Hey folks, I don't know how 'awesome' this torrent was back on 01-20-2011 but this is how it goes after you download. First you install. Next the program starts/runs. Included in Bigman1968's torrent folder along with the program is a text file with serial etc. When you go to enter the serial it does not work. Therefor leaving you with 31.61 MB less then before and a few minutes of your time shredded away. *** I will say one thing positive Bigman1968, and that's thank you for not making it with a virus at least. 

  So folks, if you want an unregistered, trial version of this software that leaves a watermark on your projects then by all mean download.  Cheers.  ;)"
