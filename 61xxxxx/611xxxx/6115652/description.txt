This is a compilation of TV appearances of Bono without U2. There are lots of interviews, etc. of Bono by himself talking about the band, but this is meant to be about his work out side the band. 

There are many volumes I've made of this stuff but the other were posted are or currently posted on U2torrents. The first 2 weren't allowed there because they contain a couple released things.
