Storyline: General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) leads soldiers of the Roman army to a decisive victory against Germanic barbarians, finally ending a long war on the Roman frontier and earning the esteem of the elderly Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus is dying and, though he has a son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the emperor wishes to grant temporary leadership to Maximus with a desire to eventually return power to the Senate. After directly being told that he will not be appointed emperor by Marcus, Commodus secretly murders his father in a fit of rage and then claims the throne.
Maximus realizes the truth about Commodus' patricide but is betrayed by his friend, General Quintus (Tomas Arana), who, albeit reluctantly, instructs the Praetorian guards to carry out Commodus' order to execute Maximus. Soldiers are also sent to murder Maximus' wife (Giannina Facio) and son (Giorgio Cantarini). Maximus manages to escape his assassination, and races home only to find that he was too late to save his family. After burying them, Maximus is found unconscious by slave traders and taken to Zucchabar, a Roman city in North Africa. There, he is bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed), who is a Lanista (owner/manager of a troop of gladiators) and forced to fight for his life as a gladiator in arena tournaments. During this time, he befriends the Numidian gladiator, Juba (Djimon Hounsou), and a barbarian from Germania named Hagen (Ralf MÃ¶ller). Juba proves to be a great comfort to Maximus, encouraging him to have faith that he will be reunited with his family in the afterlife.
