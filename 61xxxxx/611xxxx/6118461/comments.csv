,trekkerj,2011-05-16T00:40Z,"THANKS so much!  This is a treasure. The quality of the tracks is good.  One issue: And this may not be your doing, but I sorely wish folks would stop imbedding album artwork of very low pixel count.  The Mama Cass solo album artwork is only 130x127!  iTunes CANNOT remove imbedded artwork. Meanwhile, I found a cover pic of the same album at 500x489. Not only is that image clearer, contrast and color content are much better as well.  But because the artwork for these torrents is embedded, I can't remove them, nor can I make active my own artwork choices. The same is true for other albums in this torrent."
