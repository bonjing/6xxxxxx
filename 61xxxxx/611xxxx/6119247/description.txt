A fully up-to-date, practical guide to foundation engineering

Revised to cover the 2009 International Building Code, Foundation Engineering Handbook, Second Edition presents basic geotechnical field and laboratory studies, such as subsurface exploration and laboratory testing of soil, rock, and groundwater samples. The book then discusses the geotechnical aspects of foundation engineering, including conditions commonly encountered by design engineers--settlement, expansive soil, and slope stability. Details on the performance or engineering evaluation of foundation construction and the application of the 2009 International Building Code are included in this valuable resource.
