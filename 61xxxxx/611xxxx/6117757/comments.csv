,TonyTheCat,2011-01-23T00:51Z,"just remember to delete the trojan all my antivirus software is picking up on before you burn to disc . An adobe autorun installer just ran and was picked up on windows defender, superantispyware, kapersky, and avg . I mounted to a drive with Daemon tools and everything lit up ."
,TonyTheCat,2011-01-24T16:36Z,LOL.. submitted a copy of the virus to superantispyware and they gave me an update to remove it within two hours . DO NOT BURN NRG STRAIGHT TO DISC !! If your autoplay functions aren't disabled and you do you'll infect your PC . Simply extract with 7ZIP or a similar program and then delete the autoplay files and HDDVD WMP picture . Use DVDFab decrypter or something like that to burn the folder created containing the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS folders . The movie came out and works fine from the original scene releasers ... teknig is the offender here .
