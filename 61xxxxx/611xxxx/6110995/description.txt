Here is a mix of my trance projects which i never finished. All of this songs were made between year 2008 and 2009. Rainforest Energetic Mix is the only song which has some improvments that were done in year 2010.

This mix doesn't include my latest two projects Away From The Sun and Cydonia, which are also not finished yet.

Please don't use this previews as a promotion, or do any remixes because it can happend that i will change my mind and finish some of them one day.
