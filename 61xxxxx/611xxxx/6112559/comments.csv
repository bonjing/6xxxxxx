Technically, yes: A video is 720p if it is 720 lines of video. No matter what the aspect ratio of the picture is 720 is 720.

When it comes to compressing video the idea has become, ""Standard resolution is 1280x720, so if I have a video that's 1280 pixels wide it must be 720 pixels high, even if the majority of the video is letterbox.""

I've even encountered this mentality in professional video. (The original Boondock Saints DVD is an example. The video was widescreen but instead of the video being 480 lines high the overal picture including letterbox was 480 pixels high.)

Unfortunately that's standard now for online media. You just got to get used to it.

As for the 'p' it just means progressive scan. The compression has nothing to do with it. A highly compressed video at 720lines with no interlace is still 720p. Just ask Comcast. They compress the living hell out of their hi-def feeds."

,gregersamsa,2011-01-19T14:35Z,"I second that last comment, Jebus - RAR? Welcome to the 20th century, no need for rar archives any more. And why have to different files in the same torrent? Sure, one could just deselect the unwanted one but that's kind of the point of having The Pirate Bay, different torrents...
Just weird."
