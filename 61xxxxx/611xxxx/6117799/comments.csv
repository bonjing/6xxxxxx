,famemon78,2011-01-25T00:09Z,Dude VIDEO_TS folder that was extracted from the rar file is corrupted ! Video 1_4 cannot be extracted ive tried everything to fix it but its not working ! can you fix it for crying out loud!
,LittleMrJ,2011-01-25T15:51Z,"Corrupted file fix here!!! 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6126817

It's just the 1_4.vob, so you won't have to DL the entire movie again. 

Sorry about that, was a glitch with winrar, the file itself is fine."
,LittleMrJ,2011-01-29T01:58Z,"OK... I realize this is kinda an old & obscure film, & I knew the swarm wouldn't be very big or last too long... but I've seeded for a week, non-stop, with about 100 total leechers. 

So I'm done seeding now. I need the bandwidth.

I'll keep the fix for the bad track up for a couple more days, but then I'm stopping my seed of that one too... Most people just want the sex scene anyway, & that wasn't on the bad track.

Later... too bad people don't seed."
,asc11,2011-04-05T07:10Z,Would somebody please go help out the several people stuck at 88 percent on the replacement for the bad .VOB? Thanks.

great film"
,Neon_Vincent,2011-12-03T03:33Z,"This is why everyone should learn that it's FUCKED UP to use Rar in cases like this.  There is NOTHING to be gained.  DVDs, MP3s, and FLACs are already so compressed that to Rar them doesn't save a damn thing... maybe one percent in rare cases.  No, Rarring this stuff is simply a waste of resources.

So now, knowing that the 4th vob is bad, I still have to download it just to get the good parts since it's all-or-nothing in one rar.  Waste of a whole gig.  And then, it looks like the 4th vob replacement torrent has gone totally dead at 80%, even though this one is still alive, so the entire project is a total loss.

And another thing:  When you rar it, you force me to unrar it to watch it, and expect me to keep seeding the four gig rar.  Eight gigs taken on my drive, instead of just the four necessary.  If you had shared it as the group of files in the VIDEO_TS folder, I could watch it and seed it at the same time.  This is why so many well-intentioned torrents die:  They're unnecessarily rarred and most people won't sacrifice double disk space to seed.

What a shame.

Thanks for trying to share, LittleMrJ.  Next time, please don't rar stuff that doesn't need compressed.  Wish I'd gotten here sooner.  I'd restart the whole damn thing proper if I could get it downed."

ABSOLUTE FUCKING BULLSHIT.  This is the SAME IDENTICAL VERSION as the shitty American release with some of the famous sex scene cut out.  The only difference is that this one has BURNED IN DUTCH SUBTITLES.

I clipped the sex scene from BOTH versions and watched them SIDE BY SIDE and I assure you, THIS IS BULLSHIT.  The scenes are IDENTICAL at 3:02 long.  Plus, the whole movie runtime is the same, about 90 minutes.

There is NOTHING SPECIAL about this shit version.  Top that off with this fucked up Rar with a corrupt number 4 vob fixed in a separate torrent and it adds up to a SHITTY TORRENT THAT YOU SHOULD IGNORE.

If you still want this cut down 90 minute version without the Dutch subs, get it here:

I assure you, you should SKIP THIS SHITTY FUCKING TORRENT.
