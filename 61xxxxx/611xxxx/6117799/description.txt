Wild Side (1995) Uncut/Unrated (NOT directors cut)


This is a low budget, independent, double-cross crime thriller, with Christopher Walken as the main mobster/villain... and a most notoriously infamous lesbian scene between Anne Heche & Joan Chen (which is most fucking excellent, and significantly better in this version than the director's cut version).

I spent hours looking for the uncut version of this film, & downloaded 7 or 8 torrents which ended up being director's cut versions... I finally got this one from a half-assedlink, & decided that I needed to share it here.

This is a full DVD rip, with menus & extras.

HiRez scans of disc & box art.

English with optional Dutch subs.







You're fucking welcome.
