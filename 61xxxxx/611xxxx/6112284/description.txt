                    Kelly and Shane need all the help they can get  
                    when their new fantasy-kidnap business lands  
                    them in trouble and sparks a police      
                    investigation. Meanwhile, Sita is forced to  
                    take drastic action when she discovers that  
                    Chesney's new Muslim driving school venture is  
                    a ruse for wild parties and is draining the  
                    shop of profits, but her actions have    
                    far-reaching consequences. Elsewhere, Mimi,  
                    Patty and Lillian go into battle over their  
                    bingo winnings.

                        Unfortunately we had some technical problems
                        with episode 6. We hope to have better luck
                        with the repeat tomorrow.
