Eliot's Waste Land read by the late Ted Hughes â€“ a rip made from a digital tape jointly produced by Faber & Faber and Penguin Books. A few may at first be disconcerted by the late U.K poet-laureate's gritty North Country voice, but stick with it and you will find it acquires considerable power. (I hope to add other readings of Eliot by Hughes later this year)
