Release Notes -------------------------------------------------------------

Enter Wolves & Machines, a quartet from Michigan, US, whose debut album
"Ailments" was recently recommended to me by our own good DR. I have since
taken quite a liking to it, and I'm beginning to wonder if it could grow into
a dark horse role in so far as making my list is concerned. But until I
actually write the damn thing, I guess that doesn't really interest you
people at all, so let me explain what this sounds like.

It took me a while to make the connection, but these days, I think what
primarily makes "Ailments" so appealing is that its instrumental tone reminds
me a lot of original emocore, delightfully mixing soaring melodies with
abrasive walls of distortion. There are however, quite a few more ingredients
in this delicious compound. For instance, the mainstay of the vocal work is
delivered in a raw Jimmy Stadt-ish (Polar Bear Club) voice which contributes
both in the lead and in backing roles. This delivery will often alternate
with a mumble/whisper style resemblant of those used by bands like Brand New,
Crime In Stereo or The Xcerts, and topping things off there are sparkling
guitar hooks and moments of odd moods - part anthemic, part tranquil - which
reminds me of Lydia.

It may sound a bit strange, but in reality it works like a charm. The songs
perfectly escort the listener between dreamy, floating soundscapes, and
blood-rush, punk-rock outbursts which soak in the kind of raw emotion that
emo and hardcore-purists are always on the prowl for. All are generally well
within the territory between 'good' and 'great', and personally I recommend
making special notice of the opening duo "Missteps" and "Nomads", as well as
the central tripod of "Wages", "Discords" and "Ailments", the last of which
is particularly memorable, via great signature riffage and chorus.

In fact, "Ailments" is a very good record, especially considering that it's a
debut, and there isn't really all that much to complain about. I get the
feeling that more experience and slightly increased production options could
have helped the band make even more of especially their more subtle moments,
and also there surely is room for these guys to get more versatile in their
songwriting. But that being said, the sound of this is still so good that it
can hardly be ignored, and without further ado, I think it's time I just tell
you people to give this disc a whirl, just before I mark it with a
well-deserved: [8]
