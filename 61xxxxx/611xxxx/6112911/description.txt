Hello Mr Wilson!!!

Dennis the Menace is a daily syndicated newspaper comic strip originally created, written and illustrated by American cartoonist Hank Ketcham (March 14, 1920 â€“ June 1, 2001). He began writing and drawing it from 1951 to 1994, when he retired from drawing the daily page and took up painting full time in his studio at his home.

The comic strip became so successful that it was adapted to many other kinds of popular media, including several television shows, both live-action and animated; and several feature films, including theatrical and direct-to-video releases.

Hank Ketcham received the Reuben Award for the strip in 1953. 


Plot: Dennis and Mr. Wilson are not on the best of terms. But when Dennis' parents are both called away on business trips at the same time, and when everyone they know refuses to look after Dennis, they turn to George and his wife Martha (who loves Dennis and sees him as a surrogate grandson) to look after him.

Furthermore a burglar named Switchblade Sam (said name not mentioned in the film, only in the end credits) arrives in town and begins robbing houses, as well as striking fear into the children that he meets.

And to top it off, all of this is happening around the time the Summer Floraganza, a long-awaited event, is scheduled to happen. As a longtime member of the local garden club, George is chosen to host the event. He is excited to have this honor, as he has been growing and nurturing a rare plant for forty years....



Expect non-stop comedy in this smash hit film directed by acclained director Nick Castle (The Last Starfighter 1984, The Boy Who Could Fly 1986).
