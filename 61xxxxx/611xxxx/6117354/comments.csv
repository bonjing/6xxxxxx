,the-dude1982,2011-01-21T20:46Z,"DeltaPan dont worry DarthExile is a fucking troll.
Every Smackdown torrent you should see him like faggots complaining like bitches for his xbox.
Never mind him,fuck his candy ass.
And thanx 4 the upload ;)"
,overelemental,2011-01-21T22:11Z,"Well, even if DarthExile is a whiny bitch, it would actually be nice to get smackdown releases in a container that xboxes can play. But watching this on the PC is better than not getting it at all :)"
,torrtruk,2011-01-21T22:47Z,thanks man!
,aeuinz,2011-08-31T14:35Z,"I despise mp4, does not play on Many dvd players (including mine). Avi xvid play on most of them, and +, it gives a smaller file size, with same quality. I'm tired to do the conversions myself, so when i see it's this damn mp4 format, i go somewhere else..."
