         Rome was the largest empire, the mightiest military force,    
         the most advanced civilization on earth. But most of all,     
         it was a place: a city. Though only traces remain, and most   
         of its ruins lie buried beneath modern streets. Written       
         here, in stone, is the story of the ancient Romans. Using     
         new finds and new thinking the fragments are being pieced     
         back together. These people took a swamp, and drained         
         it. They perfected concrete the most versatile construction   
         material on earth They quarried thousands of tons marble;     
         They used it all to build the imperial capital; Centuries     
         of innovation, endurance, and ambition. This is the story     
          of the greatest city on earth.
