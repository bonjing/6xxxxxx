PLOT:


Bill Firpo has managed to stay honest, but can't help but be dragged into things by his larcenous brothers, the clever Dave and the kleptomaniac Alvin. When the three find a bank so easy to rob that they can't resist, the only question is whether or not they can get out of town before the big snowstorm hits. While the three brothers run around town with their stolen loot, they are beseiged with the kindness of the townfolk that might just set them on the path of rightousness.

Nicolas Cage, Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz are the larcenous Firpo brothers. Bill (Cage) is a good-hearted guy doing his best to keep pathological Dave (Lovitz) and kleptomaniac Alvin (Carvey) out of trouble. But the two small-time crooks lure their brother into robbing a bank in the small town of Paradise, Pennsylvania, where pulling off the heist is a snap compared to getting out of town after a snowstorm hits. And, the brothers soon discover that all their big-city smarts are useless against the unsuspecting, good-hearted townsfolk who shower them with kindness at every turn.
