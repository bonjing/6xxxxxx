Guy Fisher's story is one of drugs, intrigue, murder and betrayal--fodder for a cinematic crime thriller, but it all actually happened. The owner of Harlem's famed Apollo Theater in the '70s, Fisher was one of the two top heroin dealers in New York. The other was Leroy (Nicky) Barnes, deemed "Mr. Untouchable" by the NEW YORK TIMES. The complex relationship the two kingpins shared is the subject of this documentary. Friends, rivals, and allies, these two formidable figures of the underworld were feared by their underlings as well as by the law, who eventually mounted an all-out effort to convict Barnes. When they finally managed to put Barnes behind bars, he was sentence to life imprisonment without parole, with future mayor Rudolph Giuliani acting as prosecutor in the case. In prison Barnes learned of the shenanigans going on in his absence--his gang members were sleeping with his wife and girlfriend, and doing drugs in front of his daughters--and he agreed to become an informant. Barnes was a key figure in putting some of the most notorious gangsters of the time behind bars--including Guy Fisher.
