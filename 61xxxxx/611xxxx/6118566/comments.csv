,gdennis12,2011-01-26T04:43Z,"FXG:  You're so damn good, I think you should upload all MOVIES.  Do you sometimes upload software (Applications)?  I know you will be good at that too."
,xeonvincent,2011-01-30T23:09Z,"Hi FXG, I've been a fan for a while now and I am aware perhaps in order to stop/prevent others from copying your subtitles and then claiming it to be their own, most of the time the 'I' and the 'l' are swapped.

However in ""Life as We Know It"" I've also noticed capital 'S's were replaced with capital 'D's. This makes the subtitles much harder to read as the viewer has to process whether the 'D's shown are really 'D's or 'S's and subsequently causes the movies to be much less enjoyable.

While FXG are among those that makes good quality rips around could you please stop swapping the letters around?

Thanks,"
