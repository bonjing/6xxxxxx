,Coolboy1111,2011-01-30T00:31Z,"This sucks!
The site you are supposed to do some shit on is broken, there is just some text and a white background... no surveys or anything
I refuse to seed this shit, download onther torrent guys"
,KevMovieMan,2011-02-02T16:20Z,"@ Coolboy1111

What the fuck is your problem? It works fine... And stop hatin on ppl who ask for seeds... noobs use this site everyday faggot so show a little respect and for sum 1 who puts Hippy in their name (TrekHippy) u seem very angry...

Coolboy111.... seed or never use torrent sites again... seeding a torrent is its fucking lifeline the more the better... just becus u have a crappy PC dont mean the torrent doesn't work!

Great upload by the way :)"

,Whatjusthappened,2011-03-01T01:23Z,"@ Shaizy96: Learn to fucking spell you dumbcunt

Thanks to VTV for the quality uploads, however."
,PorridgeMachine,2011-04-04T20:38Z,"@ KevMovieMan

It ""works fine"" if you define ""fine"" as being directed to a site (yourbestzone dot com) that forces you to fill out surveys, 4/5 of which force you to spend money on your mobile phone account ($10 and up) and one of which requires connecting an app to your Facebook page (and possibly worse... though this might be the best alternative with a fake FB account).

Bad stuff. Shouldn't have to do any of this."
,PorridgeMachine,2011-04-04T20:48Z,"Please delete/ignore my previous comment. Because of Coolboy1111's comment, I confused this torrent with a different one for the same episode (darkvigilant's XviD - RRV upload).

This is a different torrent, and being from VTV, I assume it's completely fine."
