,markysre,2011-01-22T13:24Z,Thanks man
,romeoluv2539,2011-01-22T14:18Z,Some of us arent drones and like to make our own opinions about a movie...skyline wasnt the best but at least i made it through not peed orr.....I am going to watch this one bcuz the trailer shows promise...Thanks to the uploader
,BetterThanLife,2011-01-22T16:04Z,"I would never watch a trailer since they always ruin movies for me, but anyone who thinks Skyline was the worst movie simply doesn't see many movies"
,matelotanchor,2011-01-22T17:42Z,I watch loads of movies and agree that skyline although not the worst movie of all time was complete shit.

,Chadly,2011-01-22T18:38Z,"Man people are picky eh. Cant even make a better movie then Skyline cant even think of a better movie but yet they complain. Feel sorry for those people. You wanna see what a bad movie looks like try watching I spit on your grave lol old or new... I liked skyline and EUGIIII doesnt, so ill probably like this one since EUGIIII doesnt ;) dont know how you could hate an  idea like skyline, never been done before.... Thanks for the upload...and picky ones please for everyones sake band together and make a better movie :)"
[T],Knaster,2011-01-22T19:12Z,EUGIIII thank you for saying this AND Skyline is the worst you've seen then this is watcheable because Skyline wasnt that bad at all.
,richardpa,2011-01-22T19:32Z,"Decent PPV copy and a steady download...
A/8
V/8
Ok movie...
A bit dark in places, but still a watchable copy...
Many Thanx to TvTeam and Rx for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a decent download...:)"
,EUGIIII,2011-01-22T21:02Z,"I'm not picky at all.I personally thought MONSTERS (2010) was a good movie even though it was ALSO a low budget-it had a decent script , actors and relatable characters. SKYLINE aside from some visual effects ( most of which could've been seen in the trailer ) has none of the above.Just because a story like that  has "" never been done before "" doesnt make it automatically even watchable. The same thing with Vanishing.On.7th.Street - the idea is sort of original and the result  an hour and a half of moving shadows and whispers."
,EUGIIII,2011-01-22T21:51Z,"I'm not picky at all. I personally thought MONSTERS (2010) was a great movie even though it was sci fi and low budget- there was a good director behind it ,decent script ,actors and relatable characters. Skyline aside from some nice visual effects ( most of which could've been seen in the trailer ) has none of the above.Just because an idea like that "" has never been done before"" doesnt  mean the movie is any good.The same thing with the Vanishing.On.7th.Street -idea sort of original  and the result an hour and a half of moving shadows and whispers. And by the way I spit on your grave 2010 may be a ridiculously violent movie but its a pretty well-made one."
[T],jerry7_57,2011-01-23T00:08Z,Thank You!!!
,crackspd,2011-01-23T00:43Z,"To all bums and losers keep your fucking ""opinions"" to yourselves,just thank the uploader,SEED and give us the A/V rating/fake or real!! can you do that/ ye fucking BUMS??"
,Livens,2011-01-23T02:57Z,"No, Ultramarines is the worst movie ever."
,Nergalsyn,2011-01-23T15:49Z,"Skyline Wasn't independence day, but it was certainly a good watchable movie. i've seen much worst uploaded here."
,bfpg8989,2011-01-23T23:19Z,mwahahahhahahahaa lol
,HelpForHeroes,2011-01-24T12:42Z,"""whininguser""...i would love to beat the utter shite out of you!!"
,bfpg8989,2011-01-24T16:49Z,@ HelpForHeroes are you a retard ohhhhh.........dont worry press space button now its cool in it good for you man 
,Raukan,2011-01-25T20:37Z,"@BetterThanLife: I watch ALOT of movie, approximately 2-3 a day since I work with it and Skyline was pure and utter crap if you look past a few decent CGI-effects. The dialogue was so obvious and stiff that it made my ears hurt, the story had more holes than a swiss cheese and the acting was worse than a preschool play."
,raydiobaby,2011-01-26T12:49Z,"Man, i just luv commenters. U guys are the BEST!!  

Thanx for the upload, tvteam"
,kadaverpappa,2011-01-26T18:27Z,I liked the movie! I hope they make a follow up.
,559Josh,2011-01-27T05:43Z,"Whoever put Video as a NINE is just IGNORANT!  This says it's a PPV which means it should be Good to Great Quality!  This is NOT a dub!  This is Excellent CAM-quality at BEST!

The whole movie is in Sepia-Tone (NOT COLOR) and slightly fuzzy!

A- 9
V- 6"

,FreeFallIntoFear,2011-01-30T17:54Z,"Thanx uploader, I appreciate  your endeavor.
By the way, I liked Skyline, waiting for a possible Skyline 2."
,Galactigus,2011-02-01T00:07Z,"A:9:V:8
Pros: its watchable and u can understand it and um picture quality is ok.
Cons: Weirdest resolution when i play this on my computer it cuts off the sides how ugly i'll probably wait for a better rip if there is one coming any time soon I just have to have things look perfect to get the right setting and this isn't good enough for me."
,CryOzed,2011-02-01T02:26Z,Just downloading..:) tnx for the upload!
,bigboss22,2011-02-01T14:21Z,"Just be thankful, You're not a film critic.
You're getting this for free so stop complaining mate All we care about is the A= V="
,hauntnut,2011-02-10T11:38Z,"A/V are actually very decent; most of the PPV rips I've encountered have almost always been very lacking, but this one held it together, especially for such a dark movie. It's not DVD or BD, that's for sure, but it's more than respectable quality-wise. Thanks! Been waiting for this one."
,hauntnut,2011-02-10T11:41Z,"Oh, and 559Josh, get a clue before you rant about something you have no idea about. The only reason we have this is because the movie was released on cable networks' Video on Demand. It has not received a theatrical release yet, so I ask, how would someone have a cam copy of a movie that has yet to play on a big screen? "
