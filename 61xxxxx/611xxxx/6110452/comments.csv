There's 4600 with full downloads and TWO are uploading. "
,Zylexm,2011-04-07T14:38Z,"If you're only connecting to 2 seeders out of 4600 then the problem is obviously not the number of seeders. Check you're bandwidth settings, make sure your bandwidth isnt being eaten by another torrent or application. Failing that, try adding all the extra trackers (use the magnet link) might be able to get you into a decent swarm. 

But again the problem isn't the number of seeders, the problem is on you're end."
