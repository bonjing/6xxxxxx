Friedrich Gulda plays Beethoven's complete sonatas and concertos; all from the '68 Decca recordings, considered by most to be the finest out of the three Beethoven cycles Gulda recorded.

A couple of small notes:
-Some of the file names got messed up because of their length, so I had to trim them a little bit.
-It may look like some tracks are missing, but they're just squeezed into the next/previous track.
-This isn't my own set; it came from a previous torrent which I downloaded, deleted, and now can't find anywhere, but ALL credit goes to the original uploader.
-Though there are no .cue files, you can burn these to CDs with the latest version of Nero and the Nero Mega Plugin Pack.

Enjoy! Still not my last Gulda torrent.
