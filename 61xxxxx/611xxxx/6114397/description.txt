In 2006, the president of the United States is assassinated and while most of the population eventually settles back into their everyday life and routines, a small group of Satanists take the assassination as a sign. The leader of this satanic group, Marcus (writer/ director/producer Ron DeCaro) moves into his fatherÃ¢Â€â„¢s old house along with his wife and daughter (RonÃ¢Â€â„¢s real life wife and daughter) who are as equally demented and murderous as he is. Marcus and his friend Roland (D. Whitney) commit a series of brutal and grisly murders in an attempt to do what MarcusÃ¢Â€â„¢ father failed to do years ago: open the ultimate portal to hell and unleash its infernal evil upon the entire world!
