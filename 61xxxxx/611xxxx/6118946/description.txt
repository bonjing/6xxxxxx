Hoverboard EP (2011)

Hoverboard is a hardcore punk garage band (ex-members of Planet Piss) that I came across. They are currently unsigned & playing clubs in Brest, Bretagne, FR. 
Altough I think they are originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.
They're pretty decent, you should give them a listen.

The picture is from their My Space page at...

If anyone has any info on them, feel free to post it in the comments. Thanks & enjoy.
