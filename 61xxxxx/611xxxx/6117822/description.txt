If you know anything about me, you know that I\'m obsessive. While collecting versions of \"MacArthur Park\" and \"Number of the Beast,\" I also try to pick up any/all versions of the Super Mario music that I can. After hearing a particularly moving version on NPR the other day, I decided to finally gather all of the versions I\'d collected over the years and put \'em together into one torrent file. These range from 8-bit classics to lush orchestrations to cheesy rap to avant-garde productions.
