Quote:
"Carlo Gebler's new play especially written for Radio 3 dramatizes the extraordinary relationship between brother and sister, Charles and Mary Lamb, the writers of 'The Tales Of Shakespeare' (1807), the seminal children's introduction to Shakespeare, which is still in print.

What is less well known are the tragic circumstances, domestic and personal, behind the partnership of Charles and Mary. The Lamb family were London born and bred, bohemian and penniless. A combination of poverty and stress drove Mary insane and she committed a shocking crime. Charles saved her from prison and promised he would always take care of her. Mary was never 'sane' again but during the writing of 'The Tales' alongside her brother she was at her sanest. Literary production gave order and structure to her life. The main essence of this play explores the connection between literary creativity and mental equilibrium.

Carlo Gebler is an experienced novelist and playwright. His novels include ' The Eleventh Summer', 'The Cure' and 'How To Murder A Man'. His plays include an Irish version of 'The Dance Of Death', 10 Rounds ( both at The Tricycle London). He has co- written with Brighton bomber Patrick Magee, 'My Father's Watch- The Story Of A Child Prisoner In The 70s' and has taught creative writing in Northern Ireland prisons for many years.
