,Chr1ll337,2011-01-21T21:17Z,Can someone confirm that Disk 2 is only needed for Multiplayer! Thanks!

but it is true!
THZZZZ!"
,sage1210,2011-01-22T01:49Z,"I wonder why some one always asking about pirate version can play online or not ?

Even they know play pirate version mean sacrifice online mode.

Nothing totally free in this world you know ?"
,keith28,2011-01-22T02:01Z,I just want to say thank you to the uploader im currently downloading and will comment when finished
,XvDCvX,2011-01-22T04:08Z,"Sage I wonder why people like you completely talk out of your ass. I say this from experience and also from being positive that if you have lt+ and you patch and stealth the games properly you canm without any doubt play  online. ALSO even with games like black ops here they snuck ap2.5 after the game was released flagged any user who updated jan 19 and tried to play. On jan 20th the updated patch through abgx was out and the game works 100 percent perfect again. O AND ALSO SINCE I HAD LT PLUS AND I TRIED LOADING BLACK OPS AFTER THEY INSERTED AP2.5 IN THE UPDATE THE GAME WOULDN'T LOAD AND THIS WAS A TRAP TO ANYONE WHO HAD A MOD BUT DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY OR PATIENCE TO UPGRADE TO LT PLUS. People without lt plus will be getting banned and xval 2 shows that everything is cool. I'm sorry I  got upset but I have a friend who won't play online due to the same reason and I literally have been for years. the main thing to realize is that your spewing lies. Many people get kicked and booted all the time, but THIS i ASSURE YOU is due to mis-copying a file, burning the disc before its perfectly verified, etc. I M POSITIVE IF YOU ARE ULTIMATELY Careful with all of your biddings as they attain to burning and YOU WILL BE FINE."
,keith28,2011-01-22T06:37Z,finished downloading and playing thanx again game works just fine p.s whats up with all these pop ups this shit is annoying lol
,pirate247,2011-01-22T07:43Z,"Hey complex thanks for caring about the poor people like us who love gaming but can't afford to pay $60 everytime a new game comes out.
You are appreciated,I just wanted you to know that."
,lt2much,2011-01-22T07:54Z,So do we need to wry about ap25????
,AsssKisser666,2011-01-22T08:54Z,"Thx guys, and thx EA/Viscerial games, this game rulez! True horror game, first game that really keeps me nervous through the whole experiance. Loved first game, this one is even better. Hopefully PC version comes soon as well. 360 version looks great, but pc version will look even better. I just completed ""train sequence"", so far its been GREAT! So buy this game, or dont, it is worth it."
,ckcc,2011-01-22T09:30Z,"Due to some contradicting facts from different websites, I hope that someone who is playing this game(hopefully finished the game) will give us a definite and correct answer for these questions.
1.Confirmed NO AP2.5 and Wave 6?
2. Do we need LT+ to play it?
3. Disc 2 is undoubtedly just for Multiplayer and we don't need it to finish the campaign?

Thanks. =)"

,Mamba4ever,2011-01-22T11:29Z,Where is the patch for Black Ops to make it AP2.5 safe mate?
,NightmareRUS,2011-01-22T11:54Z,"ckcc, 
1.Confirmed. Already finished 1 disc.
2.Well i have LT+ and no magic. Still running good.
3.Forget these legends about 2 disc. You need it to finish single player. As i already said i finished 1 disc and game said ""please insert disc 2."
,SpitvenoM,2011-01-22T12:12Z,"@Mamba4ever 

 I hear you just need to re-rip your disc and run through abgx and it will add the ap25 and will work again here www.xbox360-hacks.com/2011/01/20/team-xecuter-new-dashboard-no-new-fw-needed-patches-coming/#comments"

,c4charlie,2011-01-22T20:38Z,"@joeyboi360 stop complaining about a 1 day download for a 2 disc game, im showing 1 week and thats just for disc 1, i'll download disc 2 when the 1st is finished.  It usually takes about 1 week for me to download a 6-7gb game, ive also been known to download other games in 3 hours and others 17 days. Its great to max out your bandwidth, i get about 900kb/s, but that rarely happens."
,puppeteer666,2011-01-22T22:34Z,"I don't see why it would take a week or even 2 days for 1 disc.
I downloaded this in 6 hours..Both discs."
,puppeteer666,2011-01-22T22:37Z,With Fios you can get this in 6 hours or less.

,dan2183,2011-01-23T10:09Z,"I had no problem whatsoever with disc 1 but when it was time for me to start playing on disc 2 it just died on me. Nothing happens except the ""Insert disc 2""-text. I even tried with my bootdisc first but nothing. When I start the xbox with disc 2 it says the same as other games with the ap2,5 protection, ""clean the disc"" etc... Burnt disc 2 a second time but still wont work. 
Any ideas?"
,Jaak2112,2011-01-23T21:04Z,how to switch to disc2 on a jtag ? when the game is installed on the hdd ?
,ckcc,2011-01-24T10:16Z,I am using the old activation boot disc to play wave 6 games and I have problems with all the games that require me to switch discs. Will LT+ solve all this cumbersome issue? Thanks a lot.
,Slidexx01,2011-01-24T16:25Z,"I believe that activation boot disk must be used every time before you insert backup DVD, so when the game asks you to insert DVD you must run activation DVD first. Try exiting the game, run activation boot end insert DVD2 and run the game.
// 
If that dose not help, patching to Wave 3 will cause you don't need activation boot. Mass Effect 2 and Castlevania worked without problems. I patch all the games with Wave 3 cause I don't want to insert activation boot disk every time, cause its just stupid..."
,ckcc,2011-01-24T17:09Z,"@Slidexx01
Yup. That's the boot disc. However, some games do not save before we have to switch discs. How about this game?

So, will LT+ get rid of this issue for DS2 and FF13 International Edition?Thanks again"

The second disk IS required to finish this game.
I got the ""insert disk 2"" in the end of chapter 6. or was it at 7? Anyways...

It needs the disk 2 no matter what others say."

,mattnclare,2011-01-25T11:46Z,burn it slower x2.4 or x1 if you have shitty burner or dl discs
,yesder,2011-01-25T17:22Z,"Has anyone actually burned this game and played it? I've wasted four verbatim discs, and only one of them get me to the loading screen. All of them either says ""disc unreadable"". I've burned some 30+ games, got LT+ og using Img Burn with the correct layerbreak and all. 
What am I doing wrong?"
,wsong,2011-01-25T19:18Z,I'm having the same disc problem. So frustrating.
,wsong,2011-01-26T00:11Z,Never mind. Switching to verbatims worked.

,Haluwasa,2011-01-26T19:17Z,Thanks a bunch AiTB :) working torrent everythings working great i just dl'd it and patched the iso down to 2nd wave and burned it at 2x speed everything is smooth so far will download disk 2 now and seed :)

,justinkoeth,2011-01-26T22:38Z,Some how abgx360 isn't working for these discs or Two worlds 2? any one else have the same problem?
,zenman76,2011-01-27T02:44Z,"ok here is the scoop.. (Am using a ""fat"" 360 WITH LT+ on BenQ)

Game works just fine, I just finished it on suvivalist (note if you dont like a BIG challenge then start on easier setting cause it was fookin tough)..

Unreadable disc... Try 2.4 burn speed or lower, should solve problems (or get LT+ if you aint got it already)

Game is not on ABGX yet as its not been released. Basic stealth passes fine (I took the risk of playing offline). 

Game needs second disc at ""mid-chapter 7"" (from what I recall halfway through an elevator ride) and there is no save at this specific moment (for those with boot discs) it just freezes and asks for disc 2. 

Hope this helps some people :) "

,Rebeleleven,2011-02-17T01:39Z,"@HUSLNFLO
EVERYONE says that verbatim are the best, and they are correct. I can guarantee you I've burned more disc's then you have. If you burn Verbatim's at the right speed, with a moderately good drive, they'll turn out perfect everytime. I have yet to ever have one coaster with verbatim. TDK are ok, probably 20% coaster rate. Memorex is the worst! Absolute shit. Probably 50% of the Memorex's i've burned have failed. It's kind of obvious you dont know what you're talking about :)"
