,youanden,2011-01-22T09:26Z,"Of course the steps were presented. Mainly the first step, Critical Mass. From the technological standpoint, we have the know-how to create those cities. In fact, all of the technology necessary for creating the automation, robotics, efficient housing exist across many many previously invented products. The cultural transition is the most difficult process. Getting people to understand the movement. If 50% of the US decided not to pay income tax, the government most certainly could not have enough resources to go to court. Critical mass, where people stop watching mainstream news because its bullshit, where the companies have to re-think their profit strategy around relevant information, or stop altogether. Step 2 is the transition. The more people know of another direction, the less people panic, the less chaos there is...  The easier the transition (though will probably still be very harsh). 

Also, I'd like to point out, you're asking Petter how to change the world. Don't expect these few individuals to have all the answers. I quite like the fact that they didn't hand us everything on a platter. People need to get used to checking things out, verifying facts, learning things from books, sources, instead of beautifully-stirring animations. Think for yourself. Come up with your own solutions. Join us on the forums or teamspeak to talk about what you think. Blog about it, record it."

Peter made the theatrical one smaller, the internet release will be a bit longer.
Also Peter has made sure that no one releases it online prior to the release date, there is a watermark identification for all the dvd's that where sent to each coordinator.
Yes it will be free, but this release was not to be released online and everyone who received the dvd were warned about it and even signed a contract.

As far as how I obtained this copy of the film, as I was walking out of the films premiere I saw a paper jacketed disc laying on the ground with nothing written on it. I picked it up and said wouldn't it be cool if this is a copy of the movie. Got home fired up the old DVD player and all of a sudden I'm watching Moving Forward.

Thought it would be nice to share it with you all.
"

FUCK THE FILM!

The Movement is what matters.

We do not need to draw people away from their local Chapters theater screenings!!!! 
No one gives a shit if we steal from rich corporations but these are just normal people who have to pay for these screenings out of pocket!

No, this is wrong in the name of The Pirate Bay.

You are all doing a disservice to TPB and TZM

idiots"
,P2P-ftw,2011-01-23T03:21Z,"Thanks for the share, amazing that this is how it went down!  I wanted the theatrical cut and the DVD cut, and this allows it!  While you say this has no watermark,  There are invisible ones used, so you probably wouldnt know, and if you didnt sign anything you surely aren't held by any agreements, This is the 1st legit rls, and although apparently maddening those deeply rooted in the movement (for whatever reason), you didn't violate anything i know of.  And I thank you for that!  
Im not in the movement persay, but zeitgeist is surely a series that influenced me profoundly, even if I don't abide by it like a religion."

,P2P-ftw,2011-01-23T03:34Z,"@sealabs

Oh enlightened one, how does this hurt the movement? My screenings were in my state capitol 1hr or more away, and only ran 16th-18th,  how many theatres are still airing this?  When I was looking around screening areas, it seems apparent that maybe a dozen are still running at this time, combine that with only about 500 leeches atm, and I guess the local organizations might have lost 1 sale per location from today to tuesday.  Get over it, the fact it was screened in a capitalistic way is more detrimental to the movement than having people watch it ""early"" for free!"

Seeding at nearly my max internet speed ( ~20mbps )

Ratio over 7 already, and the file isn't even complete!

I hope to see 100.000 peers in 3 days before the ""official"" release is out.

I am part of the movement, quite an old member, but I don't exactly like the fact that it was screened just like any other for-profit movie (even if in many theaters the entry was free).
The most important thing right now is that EVERYONE on Earth sees or learns about the ideas promoted by the movement, and this movie is important for that.

Planet Earth is running out of time... if this current monetary system doesn't fall soon, there might not be anything to save... and the civilization will go back to the dark ages (or worst).

Luckily, only 3 days until the official internet release, so this torrent only helps that release a bit... no harm done."
,youanden,2011-01-23T06:57Z,"@wavetrex
Actually, the Chapter Coordinators were told they can charge whatever they liked (assuming within reason), so that they can use that money to help out with local funding/paying for the theater, and overall promoting the movement locally. Peter gets none of it. Peter also said ""If I catch anyone abusing this gift, I will find you..."" jokingly..."

,johnnyboy787,2011-01-23T15:52Z,"@bongripper, it's not supporting the producers that I am concerned about. It's that the entire message of respect throughout the Zeitgeist movies hasn't been heard by the idiot who posted this. Moreover, it's harmed the viewership on the release date, just 48 hours away (seriously, uploader couldn't wait!?) which would help get Zeitgeist out into the mainstream media.

BTW, torrent sites aren't just for stealing."
[T],medesin,2011-01-23T16:48Z,"@johnyyboy787 >> I really have no idea what you are on about.
What's happening here is that PJ gets a load of free distribution by people driven by altruism. Do they not want their message as wide-spread as possible?

I for one wish to choose when and how I acquire knowledge and information. If the producer of the material is stringent about how and when, then I must ask, why? If the how and when has a desired impact in regard to some agenda of the producer, I say I do not wish to be agendad upon.

Btw, this far I've viewed 1:50 and must say I'm not that impressed. Nothing new here (for those familiar with the Venus Project, ZM or/and has seen some of the rather many documentaries on the subject matters released in the past few years). Hoping for a kicker at the end.
Although it is a nice package for the ignorant masses, if it reaches beyond the confines of the warmth of the ""Truth Movement""."

,Gaby_64,2011-01-23T17:48Z,"The Zeitgeist film series are NOT the movement, they are the artistic expressions and views of Peter Joseph. He uses them as a medium for activism to promote TZM and TVP. He has full rights on the films, and this film has been copyrighted and you are violating that copyright.

,un13,2011-01-23T18:42Z,As far as I can see the last screening was on the 20th. I thought it was about the message and spreading of knowledge and thoughts? I dont really se the argument against this upload.
,some1222,2011-01-23T18:49Z,"To the uploader: 
I understand you may have thought that by pre-releasing the movie unofficially you are doing good to other people that may have not seen it, but I got to tell you that you are actually harming the Zeitgeist Movement. Was it too much to ask to wait 2 days for the Official Torrent release of the movie? If you are reading this, and piratebay.org still allows you, please cancel this item and please Seed the one that officially will go out in 2 days. Please."
[T],medesin,2011-01-23T19:04Z,"Would someone please specify exactly how this early release do harm to the ZM-movement?

And seriously, anyone surprised must be rather new on the internets. IÃÂ´m more surprised I didn't get hold of a copy before the official screening-date. A couple of years ago almost everything was avaliable before official release...well, at least a lot of stuff.
Now in all fairness, do go out and crusade against all unapproved distribution of copyrighted materials. Or does this only apply when it concerns something YOU care about?"
,Necrofear,2011-01-23T19:51Z,"Oh. My. God. This shit is scary as hell. Don't you people see that the people in the second part of this movie want a new one world communist state?

Our current world is f*cked up, but this neo-communism will not work."

I also LOL very hard at the idea of legal action being taken.

Thank you uploader!"
,some1222,2011-01-23T19:59Z,"medesin: the author of the movie wanted to release to the internet an internet version, not a cinema version, that's why the people who got the cinema DVD for free they agreed on not publishing on the Internet, it seems promises worth nothing, hehehe.  Spreading the ideas of this film in fact benefit the whole world but is just harming the organization of the movement if I may say. I'm an opensource programmer for like 10 years and a copyleft defender so I'm not being hypocrite. Damn, was it so hard to wait 2days? And please, don't think about you are being 'agended' like if this is a Bildelberg Agenda, LOL"

[T],medesin,2011-01-23T20:17Z,"Ok, so there's a difference between the releases, then I can get that it might be a bit irritating - supposing the online version contains stuff with aim at an online audience (links or whatever).

Still, the theater-releases don't help me much, none near where I live.

So what you will, but there is a rather clear agenda with the whole movement."
,un13,2011-01-23T20:27Z,"Thats like giving candy to a kid and say dont eat. Thats impossible to pull off i think.

Share what you know, so that others will see.  That is the objective of this film.

For those that are unaware that they are sharing a leaked version, in the interest of maximum exposure we want to trend this to Most Viewed. Thus we need to all coordinate and share the same link. We need about 500K views in one day to make that happen. If we make the main page as Most Viewed, you get 1 million additional views just from the exposure alone. If you split the views among 8 leaked versions you'll never get that kind of opportunity again. Please wait for the real link before sharing. http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/

,hissil,2011-01-26T02:08Z,"@G00DY317 YouTube account G00DY317 has been terminated because we received multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement from claimants including: * PETER JOSEPH/ GENTLE MACHINE PRODUCTIONS 
Peter Joseph is a shill. He is spending all his time trying to censor the movie rather than uploading it. The first release date was January 15th. Then it changed to January 25th. If you go to their website it's still not uploaded. Its 8PM on Jan 25th and I've had enough of his bullshit delays and fascist censorship. So I'm downloading and watching this version. Maybe if PJ spent less time being a fascist he would be more credible and get things released on time. I also find it funny I spent 1 month working on a 20 page RBE implementation plan (which was even shown to governmental authority, their reaction? Fear. Probably the same reaction of PJ when he read it) and he ends up banning me from TZM forum for posting it. Looks like he's not serious about any of this shit after all, just in it for the money likely. Sure the first 2 movies have some decent info, but the only one worth your time is Orientation Presentation. Word of advice, don't trust the false gurus, like PJ for instance."

DUE TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, ZEITGEIST: MOVING FORWARD'S OFFICIAL ONLINE RELEASE IS DELAYED FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS.

SADLY, AN INTERNAL, INCOMPLETE COPY OF THE WORK HAS BEEN LEAKED. IF YOU HAVE THIS VERSION, PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD IT. IF YOU DO, IT WILL BE REMOVED EVENTUALLY VIA OUR AGENTS TO ALLOW FOR THE  OFFICIAL VERSION TO SPREAD PROPERLY.

AGAIN, IF YOU UPLOAD THE INCORRECT VERSION, A COPYRIGHT CLAIM WILL OCCUR AGAINST YOU SO THE INCORRECT VERSION IS REMOVED, SO PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD.

THE OFFICIAL (FREE) RELEASE WILL OCCUR ONLY THROUGH VIMEO AND TZM OFFICIAL CHANNEL.

I find this fucking hilarious. Someone who claims to be against the system of corruption is a hypocrite for trying to scare people with copyright threats and legal action. PJ and his 'agents' have an agenda here, and money is certainly involved."

The reason he want wants only one version on youtube is so that the video can go viral rather than people watching multiple versions taking away from the overall views, if there's mroe than 500k of one video in a 24hours it will be put on youtubes homepage. He doesn't care that people are pirating the theatrical version he just doesn't want it on youtube taking away from the official one"
,ryder1,2011-01-26T07:48Z,"Please - please - remove this theatrical version of ""Zeitgeist: Moving Forward"". Trust me, I know that you may mean well butÃ¯Â»Â¿ you are detracting from the official version that is being released by the writer, director, producer, and editor of ""Zeitgeist Films"", Pete Joseph - who, specifically asked, out of respect, that the film was to only be released through specific ""Zeitgeist Movement"" sites and mirror sites for statistical purposes. This was requested by Peter Joseph, himself, because the official and final internet release of ""Moving Forward"" is different than the theatrical release of the film; it is longer, differently edited, and more personal and viewer friendly. Once Peter Joseph releases the final internet version, you may upload and distribute however you see fit. Until then, please respect the film maker's wishes and remove this leak until it is appropriate to upload again. Thank you in advance and thank you for sharing this crucial piece of film making and spreading the truth.

Patients, non-acquisition, those are the roots of science and the spiritual tenet of The Zeitgeist Movement.  Not because I say it, it is what I have learned from the Zeitgeist films.

,hissil,2011-01-26T11:03Z,"Ok bokricket whats your email I will send it to you there. I wrote it 3 years ago as a project for Sociology. It was about ideas and methods on how society could work towards clean energy and better technology, exposing the federal reserve and their agenda, some other things such as the potential of industrial hemp (which strangely is not mentioned in zeitgeist). I expanded on these topics and presented it only to be met with stupid ignorance and fear by TPTB. Shortly after posting it on the zeitgeist forum I was ""banned"". IDFK Why either. I just can't see how getting X amount of views on youtube is going to make a difference. We should be more worried about what actions must be taken rather than cry over trivial shit such as video views being affected by leaked videos. Plus is January 26th and the movie still isn't ""officially out"" word of advice dont set a release date unless you plan on following through. Anyway, I plan on watching both this version and the official one to see what the big difference is."

,Esolc,2011-01-27T20:52Z,Just like every producer works on their film. Joseph was silly to assume he could control the flow of information and your emotional appeals are silly. You should celebrate the flow of information and not try to impede it in anyway. It's nice to be able to pass this around to my friends on a jump drive. You should want this to be as many places as it can be. Take emotion out of your equation and think rationally. Your attempts to manipulate TPB community through comments are impotent. Give up.
,Fant0men,2011-01-28T23:08Z,"Guys, I've uploaded the official YouTube version (it's ~1.8GB smaller than this rip and looks good). That's because unlike this rip, it has H.264 video and AAC sound (both offer great quality/bitrate). Whereas this rip _most likely_ has Xvid video and MP3 sound (I haven't downloaded it so I can't tell).

This rip is also stored in an AVI container, which is an old, proprietary and inferior container format that was developed by Microsoft in the early 90's. A container is what stores the video, audio as well as eventual subtitle tracks in _one_ file.

AVI can't contain any subtitle tracks and it lacks support for VBR audio and certain video/audio codecs. This format is still used today cause most people don't realize that there are better and _open source_ file formats (like Matroska). When the official subtitles for this documentary are released they can easily be muxed into the Matroska file (resulting in less clutter).

Here's the YouTube rip for anyone interested:

,sparx101,2012-05-13T18:26Z,"The Bottom Line

What this trilogy talks about is the same exact thing as the NWO, ruled by Lucifer. What could be the purpose of this framework? Well, simple enough, to console you all and make it look like some ""bright future of mankind"" so you accept the NWO and give an oath to serve Lucifer and Lucifer only, as all of you will be required to do according to information on record.

Remember this well: without your agreement, the NWO and a rule of Lucifer can not be established as it would be a violation of one of the most fundamental Laws of existence, which is Free Will. If this is done without your explicit agreement, the punishment to those who violated this Law would be more than they bargained for. This is the LAW! Under no conditions whatsoever it can be violated, and they know it really well, no matter what they tell you, deluding and zombifying you all and converting you into biorobots - functional biological machines.

This whole ""paradise on earth without God"" ideology is meant not to free you but to enslave you and in the most drastic and violent ways. If you agree to it, you will sign your own death sentence as it is planned to destroy at least nine tenths of the world population ""to restore the balance with nature"" and create that ""paradise"" for the ""elite"" of parasites to parasite on the fruits of labor of the rest of you - ""slaves"", in a LITERAL sense.

Conceptually, this framework does not make any sense even though some things seem to correspond to reality. Because someone has to rule it and make decision to allocate the resources, to initiate the projects and make all sorts of decisions. It can not just work by itself. Someone has to direct this grand show, and who would that be but not the same biggest and baddest bankers that change their dress to look like some ""elite"" while controlling the world just the same. What do you need money for if you OWN the whole world?

Can you even conceive of an idea of getting rid off the bankers and their deadly grip on the world? HOW? WHO has any power to force them to accept their own bankruptcy unless they are even bigger bankers? You mean the UN? Well, but the UN is their ""back door to enslave the world"", just as Harold Wallace Rosenthal states in his six hour long interview on record. It is them who created the UN in the first place.

If you can understand this and see it, there is no need to even read the rest of this critical review. "
