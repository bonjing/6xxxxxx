,JkCleary,2011-01-22T13:34Z,"downloading now, is there anyway you could upload way of the samurai 3 for 360?"
,Kazumi1995,2011-01-24T09:17Z,"oh yeah sorry for posting again 
but if anybody has the two world 1 game 
please seed!!!"
,Powerslave0,2011-01-25T00:20Z,"This does not work in the USA.  Title says NTSC, but is probably NTSC-J, because it does not read in my console.  Yes, I know how to burn, all my other backups work just fine, this does not. "
,JkCleary,2011-01-25T03:10Z,"uhh...it works for mine, it is NTSC."
,gordhorde,2011-01-26T10:35Z,"JkCleary - u say it works the other guy says it doesn't so F it I'm downloading it and then i'll try it i'm in canada so ill let u know he probably just had a bad download needs to redownload cause Morck22 has never screwed me & I've been downloading a lot from him latley the only one I'm having problems is Venetica ONLY 1 seeder and he's never on everybody's stuck at 1.5% so come on Morck22 we love ya bro but come back on line with Venetica so we can all download it LOL 
Thanks for all the uploads "
,digboo,2011-01-27T18:04Z,"Upon insertion of the disc the drive attempts to read it. Unfortunately, the only option I'm left with in dashboard is to ""open tray."" I'm not sure if it burned incorrectly or if this version just doesn't work. I have a standard NTSC system purchased here in the USA (with a flashed drive, of course [not sure the model of drive but it is the first one that is the easiest to flash.]"
,Doowangle,2011-01-28T02:28Z,"This works great, it IS ntsc-j. I am flashed with lt 1.1 but this game didn't need the new patch to play. 

B movie style production but a large game with tons and tons to do. "
,xchillin,2011-01-29T00:29Z,"My USA NTSC (NOT NTSC-J) console is reading it just fine and I am currently installing it to the hard drive. So it seems like another consistent and solid download from Morck22 that is exactly what it says it is, just like always from Morck22. Obviously you have to do things right, use latest version of ABGX360 (ver. 1.0.5), and have latest firmware which is currently iXtreme LT+ Ver. 1.1. Those of you who aren't getting it to work are doing something wrong; sorry :)"
,gordhorde,2011-01-29T01:02Z,woo THANKS Morck22 works great and ABGX360 just verified as of Jan. 28 @ 7pm EST
,digboo,2011-01-29T16:23Z,"Please help me, guys! I've downloaded this twice and burned it twice. Between these two burns, I burned NBA JAM alonge with several other titles for 360 and it works perfectly (yes, layer break is set correctly.) I have a hatatchi dvd drive in my 360 with the ixtreme 1.51. It doesn't have to be updated because it's the one firmware that plays any game no matter how it's patched (I don't hook my modded system up to LIVE.)

Any Ideas?"
,xchillin,2011-01-30T21:20Z,"@ digboo: My only advice is what I already said above; make sure you are using latest versions of everything; regardless if you are on Live or not, new waves and protections are embedded on the disks of new games. If you have latest of everything then you can't go wrong. And follow Jungleflasher Tutorials. No telling what is going wrong for you if you aren't updated with all procedures."

,flyness,2011-02-02T11:47Z,I have Hitachi 1.51 NTSC-U works perfect for me
,Straedom,2011-03-16T04:32Z,Please Seed. I am only downloading @ 7kb stuck @ 27%
,muneFTW,2011-09-26T17:42Z,Really??? More seed please
,Lelele5,2012-03-19T01:06Z,"Damn! One of my favourite games and was happy to find it in the Internet. But only one seeder left. Please people, we need more seeds. It's the only place looks like it can be downloaded. Long live TPB"
,Lelele5,2012-03-19T19:22Z,"I'm begging you guys, please seed it for God's sake! Stuck at 1.2% All I want is play this game. Is this so much? I have a mediocre connection, but eventhough I try to seed the torrents I've downloaded. Please help me out, maybe it means only a video game for you but for me it's much more important. I hope you realize my love for Two Worlds 2. Wish I had a better connection..."
,Lelele5,2012-03-20T12:47Z,"Please, I'm really sorry for flooding like that but we need more seeds. Only one left :( "
,Jimlombriz,2012-04-09T22:25Z,Please Seed !!
,Damitttttt,2012-04-17T00:13Z,I hate to be another person requesting people to seed but someone please upload this game
