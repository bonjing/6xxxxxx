,JGotti2,2011-01-22T02:38Z,"Well, I rarely comment...  I always seed..

But, for all of the people who bitch about MP4 files, or RAR files.. really need to relax.  All you need to do is download CovertXtoDVD3...  It converts ANY VIDEO FILE!!!!  Toss it on a DVD and play it where ever you want.  MP4 files can be converted to DVD within 10 minutes.

Kudos to all who take the time to put ANY type of video file online, for sharing.  The majority of us appreciate you...  "

,bazman0316,2011-01-22T14:50Z,"I agree with DarthExile, when ive downloaded a torrent i put it onto my media player so i can watch it on my tv but my media player does not support mp4 files, so when i have finished downloading a mp4 file i then need to convert it into a avi file, please try and stick with avi files."

,rustedhalo,2011-01-30T00:43Z,MP4 AVI RAR...whatever it's FREE you dicks so stop complaining. FLV will play anything if you take time to burn to a CD to watch on a TV then why not just watch it on TV to begin with. I don't have a TV so I d/l and watch on my awesome PC. quit yer whining.
