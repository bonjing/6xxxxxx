She won't be able to watch any of the movies she is in for a long time due to their content...lol."

Chloe Moretz saw both Kick-Ass & Let Me In at their premiers! Of course, she had to go with her parents but she wasn't going to miss her premiers!

@lostname74
Good for a few laughs? This isn't a funny movie at all. It is just as good as the original. I loved the original Swedish version when I saw it but I still liked this one. Just because it's a remake that doesn't mean it's bad."

,btfan13,2011-01-26T06:34Z,"More than likely this is a DVD-R of the blue ray since it says ""Source: blue ray"" which means the source they recorded it from.  If this was directly from a Blue ray the dimensions would be 1920x800 and around 8 gigs or more to where this one is only 1280x536 at around 4 gigs which means it's compressed."
