My DVD player supports the divx format .please sir help me...I have wasted hundreds of hour but couldn't able to convert. I used many converter but the they take very long time for conversion( usually 3 hours)."

 i hv that similar problem also, it takes too much time to convert & another thing is there might appear some distorted noise also.
i prefer to download avi,mpeg,divx dat format. mkv,flv formats are not supported in DVD players.hope DVD micro controller does support these formats in near future.."
