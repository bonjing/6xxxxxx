
Syfy channel aired one hell of a movie on Saturday January 15th 2011 that is totally action packed. Syfy has finally gotten the Saturday monster movie right for a change.

PLOT:

There is something sinister stirring under the mountain and it has its tentacles woven around the entire world. The creature is waking up and there doesn't seem like there is anything anyone can do but to duck and cover. No matter what people try to do or figure out it keeps going wrong in the worst way and even parts of the town are completely swallowed up leaving people stranded and afraid.
