,CDBlant,2011-01-18T19:06Z,"First!
I know, I know. I'm pretty lame for saying that, but I've never had the opportunity to do that before. 

Thanks for upping this to whoever. 

Hopefully these eps will be of somewhat better quality than the ones I already have. It's probably going to be quite a while until I find out though, because there are no seeds."
,_CVX_,2011-01-20T11:50Z,"your welcome, sorry for the slow upload im running best i can 65K (because there are other users on my network)

and there is one seed, me! :P

1 of me and at the moment there is 137 peers, lol

i am upping with initial seeding because i really cant handle upping a ratio of 1.5 to 2.0

and i wud say before u download the quality is

A10/V9 (pixelates during fast movement)

let me know what you guys think of quality though and happy torrenting

and for god sake SEED if i can so can you :P"
,Docoptik,2011-01-22T22:53Z,"Thanks from Greece!
I have download torrents and all of them had problems with video or sound.
I hope yours will be fine.
I seed as much as I can
(11% and keep hoping ;-) )"
,_CVX_,2011-01-25T07:35Z,"your welcome, and yeah i know that many are shit rips, but i did these from my own DVD's (except season 6, it was best torrent i found thoe :D )

and my PC spent 14 Hours encoding the 5 seaons :P

please do seed there are alot of leechers that have slowed this down for all you guys (had to upload extra 31% because of them)

and please rate :D"
,Wopatoolie,2011-03-12T01:48Z,"67 seeds and getting only 7-10kb DL over 3 days..... at this rate it will take me 2mos to get this, you guys need to open some ports you fking N000BS. you do bit torrents like old people fuck: slow, sloppy and need a booster to get ur sht straight.

not you CVX, with all these seeds SOMEONE should know wtf theyre doing, but im obviously wrong."
,Dot-Hyphon,2011-03-20T05:47Z,"Looks like a great torrent, i'll make sure to seed at full speed =)"
,Tbrenna92,2011-03-21T02:01Z,"thanks for the upload, seeding this and nothing else"
,_CVX_,2011-03-25T12:20Z,"@Dot-Hyphon & Tbrenna92

Thanks! it really helps if you seed!

ive already ahd a friend seed this to 1500%!!!

and we still have bad leeching on this torrent so to anyone who seeds, thank you so much!

and of course! enjoy the show"
,biffbiffson,2011-04-07T22:40Z,"only got the first season, but it's very good quality. thanks! will be seeding for as long as possible."
,graphorlock,2011-04-10T16:52Z,"great torrent, thanks a lot..

it contains all the episodes, but i believe the order is not correct - for example: the first season is supposed to have only 9 episodes, not 13 like in the torrent. your S01E13 is in fact S02E04.
sorry if i'm wrong... it's just a detail anyway..."
,kleptoscope,2011-04-18T04:04Z,"List of ALL episodes to date, follow the link :)
Thanks uploader! Idk about the quality yet but does anyone know where to find them in HD?? I bought the dvds but they look bad on a 50""

,kleptoscope,2011-04-18T04:13Z,"Wow :) literally got every single episode! (minus one episode in season 6, can't tell which till i've downloaded it all and watched them) 

Thanks again for a very good upload! Keep seeding all!! till ur share ratio's 3.0 + :D"
,robert_scallions,2011-04-28T09:12Z,seeding for about a week...
,robert_scallions,2011-04-28T09:17Z,going to be downloading seasons at a time so will be seeding accordingly
,ThorpeEli,2011-04-29T05:59Z,"Thanks for uploading this anonymous dude... You're still a jabroni.

Also, I'm seeding at about 1.7 MB/s so don't nobody bitch about no seeds.  Also, seed once you've got it downloaded cuz that makes me stealing my university's bandwidth more worth it.

Nobody ever reads this shit anyways but I'll probably seed to a 10.0 ratio or some shit like that, so depending on what else I got going I might keep it longer or not as long, whatevs you all want okay bitches?!  I mean FUCKADUCK I'm seeding like 3 times as fast as I'm leeching so ya'all'll get at least 3.0.

I don't normally comment, but when I do it's because I'm seeding more than I'm fucking your sister.

Peace, Love, Piracy, Bitches, Money."
,Cresizzle,2011-05-08T06:22Z,Please seed!!! been tryna DL this for 1.5 weeks.
,_CVX_,2011-05-16T06:31Z,"this torrent was made from DVD's the episodes are in the order they were printed in although i have noticed they are out of order, its FOX's fault not mine -.-

the framerate is the exact same as the DVD these are PAL 4 DVD's that means 25FPS only NTSC has 29.97 FPS if i upscale the fps to 29.97 thats not gonan make it betetr plus it increases file size

season 6 was not encoded by me nor is it from DVD's as far as i know, i only downloaded them

i reccomend using the K-Lite Codec pack with MPC-HC as your player alot of ppl use VLC i dont so pick watever u want"
,Alec51895,2011-05-19T19:25Z,"Damn. Big download, I feel like I'm going to be impressed. 
Thanks CVX"
,Shadow9002,2011-05-23T13:53Z,Seed guys please!!!
,JHD1995,2011-05-26T21:19Z,"I'm not all that pleased with the quality of the episodes. I think it's the frame rate?

http://bayimg.com/MAioOaADE"
,_CVX_,2011-06-14T01:43Z,"@Alec51895
you will be, and thanks

JHD1995
i see what your syaing, thats not framerate the problem is they are interlaced on the DVD i had to run deinterlacing on them and that was the best option i had

please search up Interlacing on wikipedia or something, wat you are seeing is tw frames being merged to create the original frame

they are interlaced on the dvd and i cant fix it

if i uploaded the origianl video then it wud have lines thru it wud u rather that? probably not.."
,sparksv,2011-06-16T16:23Z,futurama is awesome!
,ibeomnivore,2011-06-23T11:26Z,"@graphorlock
There are 13 episodes for season 1, 19 episodes for season 2, 22 episodes for season 3, 18 episodes for season 4, and 4 movies (4 parts each-16 total episodes) for season 5. You can get the list from wikipedia. This will also help you determine what episodes you might be missing. Happy torrenting to you!"
,Mosiah5,2011-06-24T18:18Z,"F**ING FANTASTIC!!
Audio = 10
Video = 10
Movie = 10
thanks for the great torrent!!
forget the chronological order of the episodes! at least you have all of them there right?! nothing a little googling wont take care of =)"
,oyyou,2011-06-27T15:23Z,"Thank you kind sir!
It is much appreciated."
,aldebaran91,2011-07-16T23:24Z,where season 5 u put the movies in season 5 
,cydog2001,2011-07-17T16:36Z,"FYI, this torrent doesn't actually include Season 5.  The four files in the Season 5 folder are the Futurama movies."
,AIMMOTH,2011-07-21T23:14Z,Wrong format (4:3). Deleted.
,Jack14112,2011-07-21T23:22Z,"Thanks for this. I had had a lot of trouble finding all the episodes in good quality. I downloaded for 3 weeks but it was worth it :D 

a/10
v/10"
,Ancient_Anomaly,2011-07-31T20:26Z,"V10? Are you serious? It has some serious flaws:
1. Wrong aspect ratio. (5:4 instead of 4:3)
2. Some scenes are blurred.
3. Lots of compression artifacts in faster scenes. (obviously a 1-pass encode)"
,pvtpatrick96,2011-08-03T23:05Z,"TO EVERYBODY WONDERING WHY SEASON 5 IS JUST THE MOVIES:

Season 5 is the movies, there were no actual episodes in that season.

,_CVX_,2011-08-26T15:37Z,"@COMPLAINERS

THESE ARE FROM DVD THEY ARE PRESENTED IN 5:4 END OF FUCKING STORY

as for the artifacts yes they are from a 1 pass encode dont u read the fucking INFO i pasted? I DID SAY THERE ARE ARTIFACTS and i dont know why the fuck you should complain, you get this shit for free

@ Praisers

your all welcome and im glad you like this torrent, i hope you all seed too :D"
,KarismaticKilla,2011-08-27T00:49Z,"Thanks man, keep up the good work. Don't let those fucking leechers get you down."

,highinsanity,2011-09-08T11:19Z,"Thanks very much uploader, much appreciated cant say the same for the ppl here who hit and run. I only needed 4 eps from season 1 which was 10-13 and its going to take 5 hours and 16 mins, there is less seeders than there is leechers. Just to make a point I will seed my 4 eps when they are done."
,_CVX_,2011-09-09T06:07Z,"yes! too many damn leeches

Can anyone tell me how to re-organize these episodes, because I am really confused! 
Thanks in advance"
,larsral,2011-12-17T12:33Z,"Thanx a lot mate. To those complaining: do it your fuckin' self!

This dude took of his own time to create something for us to enjoy for free, and that's pretty cool in my book,,"
,_CVX_,2012-02-06T12:32Z,"come on guys, they are sorted by the order they were produced, your all expecting it to be arranged by how they were aired which is WRONG, go look on the wiki.."
,thespike,2012-02-15T08:27Z,i have to agree with Ancient_Anomaly.. Its not that its terrible or anything thats bs..A lot of work involved and we thank the uploader for his efforts but the encoding is a little off and for such big files you think that it would be better.. V7 A10..cheers
,_CVX_,2012-05-28T13:11Z,"@thespike

you are correct my encodes were not as good as they should have been

new release here
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7145264/Futurama_Season_1-6_The_Lost_Adventure_[AVC]_[MP3]_[SUB]_[IDX]_D
