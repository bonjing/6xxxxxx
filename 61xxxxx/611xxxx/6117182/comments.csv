,chamouf,2011-01-24T04:37Z,@RobbingHood-This is not related to this download but your FL Studio 9.03. Mine won't recognize or open third party VST Plugins. Any thoughts on what I did wrong?
,principlemajor,2011-01-25T11:40Z,"Hi RH,
I have a problem installing this on a computer running Win XP Pro (SP3).

Error 1920, Service 'F-PROT Antivirus for Windows system' (FPAVServer) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services.

I am the administrator on that machine but it keeps giving me even if I click on ""retry"" button."
