,T4,2011-01-21T16:43Z,2 cds wtf fail
,peterbincyril,2011-01-21T21:26Z,"Don't worry about one disk or two for me.  I play everything off a hard drive myself.  I prefer one file, maybe about 1 gig seems to give  good tradeoff between download speed and picture quality.  But I'm happy for whatever I get and appreciate the effort!  Good quality.  OK movie."
,azzwipe74,2011-01-22T01:03Z,"use ConvertXtoDVD...it will convert and burn both disc,s onto one disc...to easy..thanks for the UL extremezone...hav,nt watched it yet, will coment on A/V when i have."

,abizit,2011-01-26T00:13Z,why splitting ? anyone still use CD-R ?
,dlarrym1111,2011-01-26T01:27Z,"@beikercol : Why not take a very simple approach. I assume your media player has a ""PLAYLIST""? This lets you watch many movies or video clips or whatever, in the order you place them in. SO. . . put in the 1st movie to play, the ""disc 1"", then in the 2nd line (2nd movie to play), place the ""disc 2"". When you hit PLAY, it will play the 1st selection, then it will immediately begin the 2nd selection (or disc 2 in this example). This is the easiest way to have it playback as if it was NOT on separate files/discs. If this type of fix to get around a movie being uploaded in 2 parts is completely foreign and mind blowing, perhaps block buster or NET FLICKS is a better way for you to go as far as movie watching. I can't see the big deal???? a movie being spread over 2 files or 'disks' is not even a real issue. 

Its like saying, ""My computer is hard to use because to make capital letters when I type I have to use that damn annoying SHIFT KEY"" !!!! WHY can't it just KNOW I need a capital letter at that moment!!! ""cry cry cry"",  ""whine whine whine"". 
Not to be mean, but I don't see any real problem???? 
It's amazing this guy/gal was even able to download the torrent with success. Playing 1 file immediately after another is EASIER then downloading the file to begin with?? Go figure??"
,spain00,2011-01-27T17:49Z,"if i wanted to hear a crying baby for 114 mins i would have just paid attention to my own kid.  seriously this movie is bad.  unfunny, a baby cried through alot of it and it was so so so predictable.   quality as far as audio and video is ok. 
script, acting and plot...  i give it a negative 10"
,mafoster,2011-01-28T11:32Z,Thanks for sharing! We appreciate it and who cares how good the movie is? that's up to people to decided on their own!
,The3vilM0nk3y,2011-01-29T15:32Z,@dlarrym1111 listen not eveone wants to sit at their comp desk to watch a movie. most people stream the music xbox and such does not support video playlists

Thank you"
,BabyHash,2011-02-14T07:51Z,"what's with all the rants about the copy being split into 2?? If you don't want it that way then do yourself a favor get your f*ckn' ass out of here and go to a nearest video store and buy yourself an original copy of the movie... Is that so hard???

-currently downloading, just wanna say thnx to the uploader. chao :)"
,kriptikchicken,2011-02-20T16:21Z,"1.4GB I am going to have to use 100 floppy disks!!!!

,Zarkow,2011-03-02T16:35Z,"LOL @ ""if i wanted to hear a crying baby for 114 mins i would have just paid attention to my own kid."" -- same here but replace ""kid"" with ""gf""..."

,gatewy,2011-04-12T13:16Z,"Great upload... do you happen to know the code for converttodvd to get rid of the watermark?

Thanks for ur work"
,sallie6,2011-05-08T11:40Z,"thank you xoxo
I can't wait to watch this movie!

Anyone bothered with 2 cd's I think you can join them using FormatFactory...free download (I use this for joining & converting Youtube clips)"
,brandonhendo10,2011-05-09T14:57Z,Real simple for those of you who still use disc.  Splice the two files together using windows moview maker than burn it to a disc using windows dvd maker. Use one disc by using 4.7 GB DVD-RW.  Bam!  All of those programs should be on any computer with vista or windows 7.  Or since your downloading it to your computer you can just stream it to your tv if that's an option for you.
,LEGENwait4itDARY,2012-04-09T05:43Z,"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE???!!! ONLY ONE FUCKING A/V RATER
