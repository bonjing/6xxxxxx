[T],scenetime55,2011-01-20T19:47Z,simmy boy the releasers name is in the file. and scenetime i dont get my ds releases its just standerd info. our other account  (tv and movies) displays all RG work and thanx to them. so please dont comment bullshit on ours.. also whers your thanx to release groups?
[T],simmyboy80,2011-01-20T20:14Z,"i broke away from the scene about 10 months ago and dump my own ROMs so dont talk shit on my torrents , i made a mere suggestion nothing more so think before you use profanity if i use something of someone elses i thank them in th NFO , YOU DONT !!!"
[T],scenetime55,2011-01-20T20:24Z,you get your roms from rom sites which in turn get them from RG'S but they dont thank anyone. the release group is named in the file. so its ok for you to say i dont say thanx to RG's but you dont even mention them its the last il say on the matter!  hypocrite
[T],simmyboy80,2011-01-20T20:57Z,"I DUMP ROMS PERSONALLY WHAT DONT YOU GET FROM THAT!!!! , i dont download anything from any sites i have extracted and trimmed and hex edited everything i have put on here your obviously a scene lover that wants to shit my name!! i will keeep on doing what i do (before you) and hope to fuck that TPB sees you for what you are !!!!

,mymateluke,2011-01-22T15:52Z,"@ scenetime55 . If it makes a difference. Thanks. But most downloaders aren't arsed about where it comes from so stop with the image bragging rights. Youre always going to remain partially anon so why bother. TIT.
