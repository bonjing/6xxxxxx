Rhyder has the talent to put something great together, but he needs to work out the kinks present in the songwriting on this album before heâ€™ll get to that point. Still, Every Night makes for a worthwhile listen, if only for Rhyderâ€™s voice and the stylistic diversity that accentuates each song.
