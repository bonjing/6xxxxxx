now the main thing...u may find many encodes of this movie with a aspect ratio of 2.41(means many scenes have been cropped out)..bt this release is with a aspect ratio of 1.78(so notthing has been cropped)...

now if someone didnt get what i said then see the 1st screenshot and see this

,jarman007,2011-01-21T11:04Z,"congrats on 100th upload...........

i think i will have to skip it.......i download for only to view on my laptop and quality difference between this and 700MB copy that i have wouldn't be great on 17"" screen......and i would take a lot of time to download too

anyway great upload for those who have to view on big screens


thanks anyway......are any Z warriors release coming soon"
[V],prashant22,2011-01-21T11:24Z,"@rakiem,rubel
welcome...

@jarman
ya i know its big size for u n some others...bt since the resolution was 1280x720 so it got a bit big otherwise it would hv been 2gb...

although i still hv the source n if u guys want i can upload a 900mb version(it is the case just for this movie)...
as the small rip available on net r all cropped so i can provide a uncropped small version...
if u guys want then vote for it..."
,_Dux,2011-01-21T11:29Z,+1 on the 900MB version... :)

gonna skip this one bro.
but i know lots of people with good dl.speeds will love it coz almost all hdlite encodes r more than that size. plus its a reallllly popular movie.
but i really do miss z warriors release. Any new ones coming under that ?? i have my exam on march 6 so i will be commenting a lot less.
keep doing the good work
+1 for the smaller version one of tdk."
,jarman007,2011-01-21T14:29Z,+1 for the smaller version.....will be great....thanks
,i_am_sid,2011-01-21T17:25Z,"@prashant
Congrats for the 100th encode!!!!!!!!!!!
I have some question.
What is cropped and uncropped? Does it mean black stripes above & below in actual frame? 
And what will be the video bitrate of 900MB rip?
"
[V],prashant22,2011-01-21T18:11Z,"@dux,abj642,himansu,prank
thanks n welcome guys..

@muthineni
thanks..n good luck for ur exams...
will be doing less of z-warriors...i'll be doing more of hdscene only...
although i'll do 480p's or 720p's on the basis of how the movie is n its ratings...
so upcoming is let me in 480p -700mb
n yes it will be definately better than the 700mb 720p...

@mkz
welcome..n ya will do those soon rest roky will be z-warriors.. nd blow is really a good movie so wont compromise on quality for that...

@sid
thanks man..i will recommend u this version only...
check these screenshots

u will know which one is cropped and which one is not...

dark knight unlike all other movies has 2 aspect ratio's 1.78(means 1280x720) and 2.41(1280x528)...
many uploaders hv uploaded the whole movie with aspect ratio 2.41(1280x528) means they hv cropped the scenes where aspect ratio was 1.78..

from 00:00:52 to 00:06:28
from 00:36:58 to 00:37:28
from 01:14:25 to 01:22:50
these r some(nt all) runtimes in movie where u'll find aspect ratio 1.78...rest the movie is in 2.41...
so if u hv a copy with resolution 1280x528 means the runtimes i mentioned are cropped like i showed in the screenshot above..."

,KILLrelay,2011-05-24T00:12Z,seed plz!
,Sagiy20,2011-06-14T18:51Z,"I wouldn't recommand downloading this one since it repeatedly restrts my nVidia driver (which is teh latest on win7 - v275.33).
And it ishardly watchable as it crashes my MPC-HC 1.5.0.2827 wich was installed with the ltest K-Lite pack (7.1.0).

So avoid this, 
and I'm gonna download this one:
