Thanks for sharing. ISO mounts ok, but when I run setup a dialog box appears and says, ""Please insert CD\DVD in drive C:"", (my hd) I also tried the Autorun, with the same results. I'm using Power ISO to mount the iso. Should I be using a different mounting software? If anyone has installed this successfully, I would be grateful for some feedback.

Thanks"

your a dumb arse douche, nobody in their rite mind would do those supposedly free surveys sites.
we all know most pirated games dont work online, and the ones that do work don't require you to fill out a survey."
