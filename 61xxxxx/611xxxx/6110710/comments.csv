Big thanks dude..."
,starbuck1983,2011-01-19T00:31Z,"I've got many problem with this file.
It has never happened before with eztv releases so i'm wondering if it is just me or if other people are having trouble with it too.
I can open the file (i'm using VLC) but the image is somekind of freezing, the sound too... it's unwatchable.
I'll try download the first one you released earlier with a problem in sync. At least, maybe it's gonna be easier to see and understand what happens.

Thanks for the effort anyway. eztv is still the best label of quality."
,starbuck1983,2011-01-19T00:38Z,"Forget what i said !
My mistake !

I forgot i paused the torrent this morning because Ä‚  had to leave and couldn't let the computer running.

Now, i though it was finished and wanted to see it, but it is only finished at somthing like 85%
That's why i had problems watching it

please forgive my poor english and my mistake here.

As i said, eztv is the best label of quality here on the pirate bay. it has always been and will always be. ;)

Thanks again "
