This is the entire concert (in synch!!) from 2005.
I've joined cd1+cd2 with "intermission" intact (to retain synch).
I'd noticed people askin 4 cd2 so I joined em from 7Gb and reduced to 2.55Gb with no loss of quality. The gig is 2h 51m 58s and it's the one where the STAGE MOVED!!
Video = H264 AVC
Audio = AAC 
Right now I can't say it's the best (2 modest) but i can say it's the ONLY print (from blu-ray) of the whole concert and it's bin a helluvan effort to do - BUT - 
ENJOY IT AND SEED IT (PLEASE)
