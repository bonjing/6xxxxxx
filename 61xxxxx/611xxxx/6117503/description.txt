As the nation continues to mourn, the story that sparked national debate is now the focus of a Dr. Phil in-depth report. On January 8, shortly after10 a.m., as Arizona United States Representative Gabrielle Giffords convened a constituent meeting in a supermarket parking lot just outside Tucson, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner reportedly opened fire, shooting 19 people, six of them fatally, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl. Giffords survived a gunshot wound to the head, and Loughner was arrested at the scene. Federal prosecutors have filed charges against Loughner, including attempted assassination of a member of Congress. Court filings include notes allegedly handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords, while the specific motive for the shooting remains unclear. Described as a loner, Loughner, the primary suspect, allegedly posted anti-government texts and videos on the Internet long before the shooting, voicing opinions on religion, terrorism and more. In the aftermath of these events, many questions remain: What were the warning signs? Could this tragedy have been prevented, and how can similar acts be prevented from happening again? Join Dr. Phil as he goes beyond the headlines to examine the profile of a shooter and help those victimized by this tragedy begin the healing process.
