Go and buy the blu-ray."
,mrd2011,2011-01-22T22:37Z,"hey, question. I saw how to burn these using imgburn, but if you don't want to put the file onto a disc, how do you watch it? Blu rays are expensive. I was going to put the movies on an external hdd, how do I turn the iso file into a watchable movie file? "

,ulikes,2011-01-23T07:00Z,"You are a genius! I love your stuff so much I've book marked your list. If you except suggestions, I would love to have ""Let Me In"" ""Avatar"" Extended version, and the up coming release of the ""Ten Commandments"" on blu ray being released in March. Your stuff looks wonderful."

Please read the description. HD-R-US has compiled the ISO for us, AVCHD structure and all. IT's just for the convenience. The title clearly says AVCHD, and AVCHD can be burnt onto bluray or standard DVD-R media. IF you want to watch it from an external HDD, then mount the ISO image using ISO mounting software (I prefer Virtual Clonedrive 5.4.4.0) and navigate to the mounted disc image. Usually double clicking it on Windows will play it as a Bluray movie, so alternatively right click the drive and look for the 'Open' or 'Explore' option. Go to BDMV/STREAM and there should be a single m2ts file. That is the movie file. Of course, the file extension is a bit weird compared to mpg or avi, but an m2ts is just a file container for h264 video so you'll need VLC media player, Windows 7's Media Player or a TV/media hub which supports h264 media playback (change the file extension to mp4)."
,BJ12,2011-08-20T08:50Z,"It's not 1080p in height. The details show 1080, even when you right click and check the properties of the m2ts file it says 1080 - but when you play it the movie is around 1920 x 800. I see this happen often and wish I knew why even the details tab of properties can be wrong."
,DosTrece,2011-09-07T10:55Z,"i have mkv files in my computer . can you tell me what program you used to make BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders
