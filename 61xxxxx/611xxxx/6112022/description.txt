However, This is the pre-released version of the game, that was given out at E3 1997.

Dont expect this game to be any better than the original, Its full of bugs, and glitchs, and on top of all of that, the graphics, the story, and the gameplay suck. But Its fun to play to laugh at it

To play just mount the image in Deamon Tools and click the "AUTORUN.EXE", or use ImgBurn to burn to a DVD+R
