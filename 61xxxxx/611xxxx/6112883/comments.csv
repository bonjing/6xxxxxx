,globalpuffer,2012-02-23T08:25Z,"Why am I not surprised,  I was trolling around so fileshare sites looking for something cool to read and I stumble across this little book, which looks like an excellent resource for this particular material, but woe is me, the links were dead.  So I google the book.  And there it is, on Pirate Bay, and of course, Thethingy posted it, because it is cool.  And 48 seconds later, it's mine....  Thanks to you.... Just like so many other ""thingys"" which I now enjoy.  You are a Saint, Mr.Thingy, a modern day Robinhood, and there is a special place for you in Heaven.  The RIAA may not agree, but the rest of us guarantee it.  Hell, I'd be the first to give up my spot for you if by some divine injustice, you get screwed."
