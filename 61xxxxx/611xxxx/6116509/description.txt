Artists of all levels, from beginner to seasoned professional, will find Studio One a serious alternative to the intimidating, bloated offerings currently considered the standards.  Itâ€™s a groundbreaking music creation and production application for Mac OS X and Windows XP/Vista/7 that makes audio recording, MIDI sequencing, and audio mastering ridiculously simple right out of the box.

Studio One changes the rules of the game with fresh code, innovative drag-and-drop MIDI mapping and plug-in management, auto-configuration with PreSonus hardware, insanely good audio quality, unlimited tracks and plug-ins per track, and a powerful, inventive Start page.

And although Studio One Pro hit the scene just months ago weâ€™ve already added even still more pro chops with Version 1.6. From tracking to mixing to mastering and distribution, itâ€™s the creative environment built for intuitive use, speed, and efficiencyâ€“and yet itâ€™s robust enough for the most complex productions.
