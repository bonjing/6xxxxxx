Description

ModBox is a universal Tracker Format Player that plays Amiga and PC module computer music (e.g. Protracker, Fasttracker, Screamtracker) on your iPhone and iPod Touch device.

Features:

Direct fast-mirror internet access to the finest selection of modules from the Modland library with a preselection of over 5.000 freely available songs, over 250 hours of music playtime and access to three decades of computer music. You can easily browse and download your favourite songs from the internet via WiFi, UTMS or EDGE. Using ModBox all your tracked computer music is right away available in your pocket (Modland access requires an active internet connection, internet access fees are not covered by this player). Downloaded songs get stored in the local library for further offline usage or manual management.

ModBox is optimized for speed and performance and runs even great on older devices and/or background playing.

Built-in iPhone/iPod Touch FTP Server so you can manage your own songs or backup your library over WiFi using standard ftp. Additionally you can use your iPhone/iPod Touch as a WiFi FTP USB Stick or provide anonymous access to your module library for friends.

Support for 669 (Composer 669, Unis 669), AHX (Abyss Highest Experience), AMF (DSMI Advanced Module Format), AMF (ASYLUM Music Format V1.0), APUN (APlayer), DSM (DSIK internal format), FAR (Farandole Composer), GDM (General DigiMusic), IT (Impulse Tracker), IMF (Imago Orpheus), MOD (15 and 31 instruments), MED (OctaMED), MTM (MultiTracker Module editor), OKT (Amiga Oktalyzer), S3M (Scream Tracker 3), STM (Scream Tracker), STX (Scream Tracker Music Interface Kit), ULT (UltraTracker), UNI (MikMod) and XM (FastTracker 2) modules.
