KLF Was a dance group from the early nineties who had a music formula to creating a hit track and becoming number 1 in the charts which they did world wide.
I thought was there a formula to make music to create the perfect murder too.
I think I achieved it in this track.The Fred West Murder Music comes through on this.
Happy killing the tracks b-boys & girls.
