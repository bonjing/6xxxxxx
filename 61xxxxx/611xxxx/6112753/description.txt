Is this what happens to all trip hop sirens when they grow up? Do they all go folky? Does this mean that Joanna Newsom was once into trip hop? OMG. Rocking Horse suggests that the former Sneaker Pimps frontwoman is now a tamed and domesticated pussycat. No more posing half naked on the cover of an album. This is full throttle folk, from the hushed delivery to the finger picked acoustic guitar. It's kind of weird and disorienting not because the music is bizarre (it is not, only a bit Wicker Man-ish) but because you get the feeling that this woman has more grooves to give and it doesn't feel really authentic, this woodsy attack but it does sound nice and it sounds lovely.
