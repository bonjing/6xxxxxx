,cyberkeg,2012-01-08T09:02Z,"Many thanks !

Only downloaded the first few so far to test and
they are perfect.  Not to mention they are almost
50 years old.  A10/V10

Thanks again.  Effort is very much appreciated."

I've found so many old tv series ripped to a horizontally stretched 720x480, so it's refreshing I don't have to re-encode these to the right dimensions.  Just a perfect job and thanks for sharing it with us!"
