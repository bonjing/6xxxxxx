,nitrogun,2011-01-21T08:58Z,"Thanks.
As I get older. the more sentimental movies seem to become more interesting than gore/horror. 

As for the smaller format....   
720p looks a lot nicer....  
And 20-40's 800Mb 720p is a third the size of some 720p movies ripped by others, and just as good. 
Just have to buy bigger hard drives. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-21T09:36Z,"@nitrogun: ...or pile of   empty DVDRs and burn till burner breaks out.
LOL, regarding ""going sentimental"" in choice of movies - same thing here. 

Big hard-drives are double-edged sword (in fact, this is stupid English phrase 'cause if sword ain't double-edged - it is not - a sword at all). Last week when one of my 1 TB drives went fishing (bought three months earlier, you know when) I felt how magnitude of the lost is bigger than actual difference in size compared to older HDD sizes.

And 720p looks better indeed, this movie as 480p must be 612 MB (110 minutes) and after short deliberation I opt for bigger frame."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-21T09:41Z,"opt = opted

Sorry"

A Samurai Sword has only one edge, as does a Cutlass, and I think also a Sabre, and a Damascus Sword.......

Re hard Drives failing, been there, done that....

look here

http://drobo.com/products/drobopro-fs.php

look at Drobo FS device, on my wish-list, never lose a bit of data again when drives fail. 
For even more space, there is the DroboPro

Supports the Computer of Your Choice
Connect to your Drobo FS using any Windows, Mac, or UNIX/Linux computer.ĂÂš Whatever system you have, it's likely you'll be able to connect to it over your network quickly and easily.

Easy Expansion to 10TB and Beyond
Drobo FS holds up to five drives allowing you to effortlessly grow your storage to meet your data capacity needs. To add more space, simply insert a new hard drive or replace your smallest drive with a larger one, even when all drive bays are full.

And unlike traditional RAID systems, the BeyondRAID technology in Drobo FS enables you to mix and match drive capacities, brands and speeds. This unprecedented flexibility allows for continuous expansion as available hard drive capacities increase.

With Drobo FS, expansion is automatic, instantaneous and access to data is always maintained.

Protection from up to Two Drive Failures"
,dark_defender,2011-01-21T12:28Z,"@twentyforty: Thanks a lot for this awesome encode. It is so heartening to see seeders more than leechers on this one. I hope this happens with all your other torrents too.
**Thumbs Up*

P.S: I usually don't watch movies of this genre, unless it has high imdb ratings. But i will take your word that it is a good one and watch it."
[T],houruoha,2011-01-21T12:30Z,"thanks you much
seen the TS 
loved it 

:)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-21T12:45Z,"@nitrogun: ...""simply insert a new hard drive"" = (equals) BUY A NEW ONE = if someone buy a new drive ...?... LOL, defying logic for marketing purposes...

2nd= Samurai has KATANA - not a sword. However, it is bladed weapon - by definition, not a sword. Apples and oranges.

Damascus SABER as almost all Arabian bladed slashing weapons is not a sword. Apples and oranges.

In common English too widely used phrase, as I said. LOL again."
