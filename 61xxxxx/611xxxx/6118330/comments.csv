,Achilles295,2011-01-26T13:56Z,"Wow man that's amazing. I have one question though. I also have Spectacular SM, Friendly Neighborhood SM Web of SM etc etc. Problem is I don't know the chronological order of the releases so do you know a place where I can see the order they were released because I don't want to read them randomly.

Anyway, thanks for the great collection."
,firespread3,2011-01-26T17:37Z,I've been trying to find that for a while cuz I have em all too. I'll keep looking and let you know if I find one.
,firespread3,2011-01-26T22:51Z,"I've read on a couple sites that other than major crossovers and stuff there's no exact chronological order, just stories spread everywhere so, idk what to tell ya :/ You could go on marvel's site and look at release dates of all of em and order em like that but that's all i got, sorry :("
,Achilles295,2011-01-30T13:19Z,"Ah well, what can you do? Thank you for looking."
