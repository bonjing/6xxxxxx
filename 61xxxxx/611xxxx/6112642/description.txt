This song appears in the ending credits of Rocky V. It is sung by Elton John. This is one of the better songs sung by Elton as it has a very important meaning for us.

The meaning is this: success and defeat is part and parcel of life. Sometimes you are down, but you won't be down forever. You will rise again to greater heights.

 
This song has a special place in my heart.

Lyrics

Written by Alan Menken
from Rocky V soundtrack

These battered hands are all you own
This broken heart just turned to snow
Go hang your glories on the wall
There comes a time when castles fall
And all that's left is shifting in the sand

You're out of time, you're out of place
Look at your face
That's the measure of a man

This coat that fits you like a glove
These dirty streets you learned to love
So welcome back my long lost friend
You've been to hell and back again
And God alone knows how you crossed that span

Back on the beat, back to the start
Trust in your heart
That's the measure of a man

It's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand
It's the things you understand
Permanent ties from which you once ran
That's the measure of a man

You've come full circle, now you're home
Without the gold, without the chrome
And this is where you've always been
You had to lose so you could win
And rise above your troubles while you can

Now you can love, now you can lose
Now you can choose
That's the measure of a man

It's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand
It's the things you understand
Permanent ties from which you once ran
That's the measure of a man

You've come full circle, now you're home
Without the gold, without the chrome
And this is where you've always been
You had to lose so you could win
And rise above your troubles while you can

Now you can love, now you can lose
Now you can choose
That's the measure of a man
