ReleaseNotes:

The Bloodshot Gamblers were born during a fifteen hour binge
in Las Vegas. "Hillbilly Tim" (aka Tim David Kelly of Kicking Harold
& The Skies Of America) & Country Mac Brian (aka Brian Anderson
of Kicking Harold and Nevershine) did a shot, shook hands and made
a gentlemen's agreement...TO ROCK! "Pain & Other Simple Pleasures"
is the result. It took 6 months of hard work in the studio and many
years of life lessons to make this album happen. Grab yourself a chair,
pour a shot of whiskey & enjoy a ride from the darkness into the light.
2009 release date; bloodshot gamblers.
