DVD1 - Windows 7 x86 Service Pack 1 SP1 - DVD 2.96GB

is Enterprise the ms sp1 integrated into a combined installer or is enterprise slipstreamed with sp1 then combined?

What build is the Enterprise?

thanks......"
,legolash2o,2011-01-19T14:25Z,"Everything has SP1 integrated including Enterprise so should be SP1 build, I'm not at home to check the exact build number but should be same as all the rest.

They are combined in the same install.WIM so when you boot from disk you get asked what version you want to install. Hope that answered your questions?"
,legolash2o,2011-01-19T14:29Z,I slipstreamed it into enterprise then I combined it.

,wikanx,2011-01-20T10:34Z,"Thank you for this, was gonna Slipstream the Enterprise version myself. Saved my a lot of troubles."
,theone_nr,2011-01-20T11:11Z,"Just ONE seeder , i'm going to pass this because until finished to download its come out the original MSDN ISO's !"
,legolash2o,2011-01-20T14:40Z,"theone_nr, it's a new torrent 12GB is size. 69% has already been uploaded and should have a couple of more seeders by the same time tomorrow :)"
,legolash2o,2011-01-20T17:06Z,What percentage is everyone at?
,nyroi,2011-01-20T20:29Z,"Hello.
Is this with norwegian language?"
,legolash2o,2011-01-21T00:14Z,"Just English, but if you probably will be able to integrate a Norwegian language pack."
,mandipdas,2011-01-21T04:50Z,"What is your seeding time period? Thanks for the nice release but I just wonder why no one has not yet completed it after 3 days!!! I know it's a big one but we don't really have to download the whole thing right? So, we just need to download the particular ISO that we'll use. In my case it's Win7SP1AIO.iso. But thanks again for this one. Please just don't stop Suddenly."
,legolash2o,2011-01-21T09:22Z,I'm just going to keep seeding it until there is a bunch sources. It does not help when people finish downloading and then don't seed!
,theone_nr,2011-01-21T09:36Z,"@legolash2o i tell you again , if u are not able to INITIAL SEED at a decent speed and u expect to begg u , i'm never ever download something from u !"
,legolash2o,2011-01-21T10:31Z,"Who said anything about begging?!? I wouldn't want you to beg.

Soon i'll be getting a 50Mbps package, which will be able to upload at 50Mbps too."
,mandipdas,2011-01-21T11:53Z,"Thanks mate, I really appreciate your efforts."
,theone_nr,2011-01-21T18:28Z,@legolash2o as allready told you...until u finish the initial seeding (2 weaks or more) MSDN will come with original discs out =)))))
,Eye_Me_Hearties,2011-01-22T02:36Z,"@legolash2o:

You did so much work, so beautifully that I had to join to comment;

If only you had done the AIO disc in its own torrent!!

ANY DVD-ROM drive reads DVD9's and only people with RW-DL would be downloading it anyway.

If I ever get it I'll seed for a while at 29Mb up!

Gotta love FiOs!! Thanks for your efforts."
,legolash2o,2011-01-22T09:38Z,"Eye_Me_Hearties, your welcome and thanks!!! At least someone is grateful unlike theone_nr :D"
,theone_nr,2011-01-22T10:24Z,@legolash2o gratefull for what ? for waiting a week to down ur torrent ? no way dude ! in just 2 hours i downloaded from TPB the ORIGINAL ISO'S from WZT and in other 15 min. i combined them ! i know the TRUTH hurts but u never realize that !
,legolash2o,2011-01-22T12:32Z,"theone_nr, this torrent is FREE, you spent no time in making it. If you don't want to download it then it's your choice, but since you are not obviously downloading it then can you stop commenting..

You seem like one of these people who would complain if someone gave you a free but old/slow car.

So stop commenting!"
,legolash2o,2011-01-22T12:36Z,"quote ""ORIGINAL ISO'S from WZT and in other 15 min. i combined them !""

Do they have SP1 already integrated into all of the editions? No, so shut the fuck up

Although i do agree i should of uploaded the AIO separately."
,theone_nr,2011-01-22T15:42Z,"@legolash2o first of all the answher is: YES , WZT had THE ORIGINAL SP1 of WIN7 INTEGRATED released on TPB ! BTW. anyone can download at a decent speed (2 hour max.)
Next have u ever hear about freedom to comment and speech ? I believe not ?!
The FACT is anyone can download and comment what they want !
Decent comment , not like u do , that proves to me u are like a child who is not able to admit the TRUTH ! =))))"
,legolash2o,2011-01-22T17:06Z,"You was the one complaining about the speed you tool. Fact is no one has the right to complain about anything that is free, end of."
,Eye_Me_Hearties,2011-01-23T01:24Z,"legolash2o, 

""Although i do agree i should of uploaded the AIO separately. ""

Yeah, THAT'S the comment I was lookin' for! ;)"
,legolash2o,2011-01-23T12:14Z,"lol, :D Well i won't be adding more torrents until i get my new 50Mbps upload, connection.

To be honest, i don't know why i uploaded all 3 images, won't make that mistake twice. :)"
,bratley,2011-01-25T22:15Z,"AWESOME upload !!! downloaded between 600 kbs - 1.1 megs :) clean, very fast/responsive works like a champ used hal to activate and things are wonderful, it's passed wat with no problems and does updates just fine :)"
,dynedain,2011-01-31T02:03Z,Is there something missing from this? When I try a clean install I get an error message about the installer not being able to find required files.
,foxyfishi,2011-02-12T04:48Z,"Thanks, legolash, this is exactly what I was looking for, as long as it's the same as the SP1 that comes out on the 16th.

chess000master, why would I want a hacked version when I already have my own key?"
,legolash2o,2011-02-12T12:45Z,Just to let you all know Microsoft has released an article on the Windows Team Blog and has said that build 7601.17514.101119-1850 is the final. Good news is that this is build 7601.17514.101119-1850 :D
,LFXTrader,2011-02-27T23:34Z,"I am not sure about your last comment about them all NOT having SP1 integrated, they ALL ar elisted as having that in the description you gave.

To avoid any more confusion I need to ask you this question and hope you can answer it for me. 

When not using the AIO this means I can use the latest loader to activate it or my own product key? Correct? And either of these two options would work?

Download speed currently at 6kbps so I may have to skip this after all."
,SearinoxNavras,2011-03-05T13:07Z,"Dude, you can shrink the torrent by excluding Enterprise since there's no easy activation for it. I was able to include Windows Loader to your install and will test on VMware shortly. In theory, should be able to install EVERY x32 and x64 version AND preactivate them, unless you explicitly entered a serial. EXCEPT for Enterprise, as mentioned. I also won't be able to test x64 because my BIOS needs a feature for x64 emulation which it doesn't have."
,SearinoxNavras,2011-03-05T18:13Z,"Okay. I was able to slipstream the loader myself, and I gave the DVD image a go.

Your image has two big problems:

-does not install ""system reserved"" partition with the necessary recovery mode

-does not offer ANY sort of options to format or choose what drive you install Windows on - NOTHING. big problem there! once you pick your windows version, setup starts immediately. there is no option for upgrading a previous windows or managing partitions."
