,dark_defender,2011-01-18T21:01Z,"Hi 20-40,
I empathize with you for this separate torrent thing. I know it is further burgeoning your burden and I hope all these efforts doesnt go futile. I wish Hit-n-runs(Stupid Fucks) were not disproportionate in numbers :(

You have our full support and let us know if we can be of some help."

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon

I'll give this a look even if it is on OWN because of the prodcuers."

Didn't like the packs much tho.. I always took one or two, and they took ages to download.. Hope you continue these singular eps again!

You Rock! don't ever change! :)"
