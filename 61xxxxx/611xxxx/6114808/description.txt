Not a bad pop album by a female singer songwriter (a species that all too often seem to take itself far too seriously), but not an out and out success by any means.
If you're a fan of singer songwriters performing in eclectic styles, then The Reminder could be exactly the type of album that pushes your buttons, but for me, it's pleasant, but relatively inconsequential.
