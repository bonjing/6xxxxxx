@buckweed
This isn't an old red/green stuff. Its real 3D upload.


HOW TO MAKE 3D GLASSES AT HOME:-

1.Cut a pair of eyeglasses out of the cardboard & cut holes for the left and right eye.
2.Cut a section of Blue Cellophane and a section of Red Cellophane. CELLOPHANE is easily available at stationery shops. Its a thin, transparent red/blue/green/orange/yellow sheet used to cover copies and books.
3.Tape the piece of Red cellophane to the left eye cardborad hole (so it will cover your left eye) and the Blue Cellophane to the right eye cardboard hole (so it will cover your right eye).
4.Wear your glasses.
5.Youtube for more options to make 3d glasses at home.
6.Watch any 3D movie with these glasses."
,buckweed,2011-01-24T01:17Z,"@lateman:

Oh I am sorry, the really awesome, fcin A OK BLUE and RED 3d then...jesus!
This is NOT REAL 3d, as in ""you need a 3D compatible fucking TV to watch it"".

But by all means, enjoy your cardbox glasses, I am waiting for the real deal, to play on my 3D compatible sony."
