,dhd75,2011-01-31T15:40Z,May I ask if you had upscaled the DVD?. Afaik there is not BR release of this show. Thanks!
,jags87,2011-02-01T03:16Z,Yeah I upscaled it.  It is definitely not a BR release.
,slacka,2011-09-17T17:23Z,Dude . .  128kbps audio ? *shakes his head*. Why upscale this so it's a 7Gb file and make the audio 128kbps? Sounds like total dog $hit. Thanks anyhow.
