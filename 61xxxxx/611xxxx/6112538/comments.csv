,forwardho,2011-04-05T07:21Z,"*******IMPORTANT ** PLEASE READ ********  Everyone, please be aware that this torrent consists entirely of materials from EXISTING Gene Scott torrents.   We are trying to PREVENT fragmentation and duplication.   If you download this you are going to be wasting a lot of bandwidth because this material already is posted in the other existing torrents.   I'm sure the poster of this torrent had the best of intentions, but this is extremely counter-productive.   If you want to get all of Gene Scott's material, you would be much better served by downloading all of the EXISTING (ORIGINAL) torrents, of which there are now many and can ALL be downloaded in one shot here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5822159/GENE_SCOTT_-_SEPTEMBER_2010_-_FOURTH_-_UPDATED_TORRENT_PAK"
,forwardho,2011-04-05T07:24Z,"If you want to help keep this work alive, please download and seed the existing torrents.  Watch for ones where the number of seeders goes to zero and make sure to seed those especially.   Please DO NOT just take existing material and make a new torrent for the hell of it, because you are wasting everybody's time and it becomes a mess for others to try and sort out what's going on.   

Only create new torrents if you have original materials that aren't already out there."
