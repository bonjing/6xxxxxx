ReleaseNotes:

This album was a welcome addition to many a fan's collection, because it brought together the fun (most of the album) and the hard-to-find (the three cover tracks from Penikufesin). Although we weren't to know it at the time, Anthrax were having internal problems and label trouble at around this time. Joey Belladonna left the band soon after this release. ... This was the beginnings of Anthrax cleaning out their closet in preparation for the more mature sound they developed in the later 1990s. Spring-cleaning was never so much fun.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
