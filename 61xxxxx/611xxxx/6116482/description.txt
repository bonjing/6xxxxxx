    Antti "Zombie" Autiomaa does two things well: play the bass guitar       
    and drink. After several months' sleeping on the streets of Istanbul,    
    he returns to Helsinki where he's called into the army but discharged    
    on mental health grounds after adding turpentine to the officers'        
    soup. Zombie lives bleary-eyed in an apartment off his parents' house    
    where his lonely, unemployed father suffers from heart disease. His      
    girl-friend Marjo has taken up with a hairdresser but comes back to      
    Zombie. His friend Harri hires him as a roadie for his band "Harry       
    and the Mulefukkers" then gives him a chance as a bass player. He has    
    his girl and he has a gig, but can Zombie put the bottle down?
