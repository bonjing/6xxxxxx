Her best album.  Away from MCA and the Nashville sound, she rocks out and mellows out simultaneously.What I Deserve is a beautifully constructed album which veers away from her straight country style. The guitar-rich tracks feature Max Butler and the distinctive tones of Chuck Prophet, with stand-out songs including â€œWrappedâ€, â€œCradle Of Loveâ€ and a superb version of Nick Drakeâ€™s â€œTime Has Told Meâ€.
