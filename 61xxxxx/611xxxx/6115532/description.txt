The developing storyline revolved around the flickering relationship between Terry King a likeable con-artist with a plausible manner and unusual powers of sincerity, and Sandra Gaines an embattled social worker beset with problems in her private and professional lives. The story began with Terryâ€™s early release from prison, as part of a new pilot scheme, to assist in the renovation and re-establishment of a delapidated community centre under Sandraâ€™s supervision.
