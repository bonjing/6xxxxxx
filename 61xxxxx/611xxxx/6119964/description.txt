Death stars are stars several billion times brighter than the sun, and so far away that when their light comes close enough to be seen on earth, it's already over a billion years old. They also give off powerful gamma rays, some so strong that a number of scientists believe one could possibly destroy the earth some day, and there's so little visible evidence that they exist that it wasn't until 1967 that anyone was sure they were out there. Nova: Death Star, a documentary originally produced as an episode of the acclaimed science series Nova, takes a look at these huge, powerful stars, and explores what is known about them and what astrophysicists are still trying to learn.
