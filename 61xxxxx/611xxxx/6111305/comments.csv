Just because you do not understand other peoples issues does not put them in the wrong.
Your ignorant and selfish ""I'm alright Jack"" is not appreciated.
While plenty of people, like yourself, whine unnecessarily, others have genuine issues which could do with some attention.
Noise from fools like you only serve to cloud those issues."

I have no idea what you are talking about. I don't know who you are, what you are referring to or what ""I'm alright Jack"" is supposed to mean.

I'm guessing that you saw something I posted and this was the only place where you could contact me... but considering all I ever usually post is ""Excellent quality, thanks mate."" I'm going to guess that you have misdirected your anger. "
