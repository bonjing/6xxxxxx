Great quality even on 1080 hi def(some parts are fuzzy/pixilated due to playback of his photos and old film cant be helped).

Its great but not knowing anything about it b4 hand i thought it was a comedy show that he did.

Its actually about his life and of course religion and how it influenced him etc and is obvious downfalls.
Great doco/film +1"
