I've searched the whole web and there's no sign of it anywhere (well, not in 320/kbs quality). There is ""Addictive"" in 320/kbs, but I want the whole album. Thanks in advance. :)"

,TyMod,2011-10-11T03:28Z,"Dude, only reason I looked at this torrent is to see if you had left thepiratebay or something and it just seems you dropped off.  I'm missing your uploads!!!!! Don't know how you rip your CDs but they quality kicks the supposed iTune rips uploaded on here so please come back.  Every EMINEM album I have downloaded is from you and the quality is for sure lossless or the same asa the CD itself.  COME BACK!!!!!!!"
