------------------------------

King Henry VIII had a fascinating and enlightening relationship with art. He came to the throne as the renaissance swept across Europe, yet England's new King never lost sight of the medieval chivalry of his forefathers. In the first of a two-part documentary, architectural historian Jonathan Foyle looks at the palaces, tapestries, music and paintings created in the King's name and questions whether the art he commissioned compensates for the religious treasures he would come to destroy.
