Montague Rhodes James, OM, MA, (1 August 1862 â€“ 12 June 1936), who used the publication name M. R. James, was an English mediaeval scholar and provost of King's College, Cambridge (1905â€“1918) and of Eton College (1918â€“1936). He is best remembered for his ghost stories which are widely regarded as among the finest in English literature. One of James's most important achievements was to redefine the ghost story for the new century by dispensing with many of the formal Gothic trappings of his predecessors, and replacing them with more realistic contemporary settings. At the same time, James's protagonists and plots tendâ€”like himselfâ€”to be absorbed with antiquarianism. As such, he is known as the originator of the "antiquarian ghost story"
