I bought this book (Kindle/mobi edition from Amazon here in the UK) for ĂÂŁ8.99, which is extortionate, given the fact that the ebook edition is more expensive than the hardback(!), but I wanted to read it. 

Please be aware that anyone can remove the DRM protection from Amazon 'kindle' downloads by using 'unswindle', which you can use if you follow the instructions here:

You don't need to own a Kindle. Just download the PC viewing application from Amazon, buy your ebook, and follow the instructions in the above link. Then share your purchase with the world!

Lets get more decent ebooks out there. I'm sick of the surfeit of 'self help' and computer books!
