,mishhh,2011-10-25T20:19Z,I agree with animosus. This guy has a quite elevated ego :D. But he's brilliant with the piano
,molly_dog,2011-10-30T03:59Z,"Can't vouch for the quality just yet. I had d/l'd a torrent with only the first 6 DVDs. Looking forward to the rest of the set! Thanks in advance!!

p.s. Animosus, you DO know these are piano lessons and not porno, right? Don't personally find guys attractive one way or the other but this guy looks average enough. He doesn't have a partially-developed fetus growing out of his forehead or seven eyeballs hanging out of his left nostril. I'm interested in learning the piano. How about you?"
