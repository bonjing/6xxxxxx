Learn & Master Piano
Complete Set (14 DVDs, 5 Play Along CDs, Lesson Book PDF)

*** This set came from another torrent site (http://myanonamouse.net/), but was simply DVD VIDEO_TS content. My only doing was the conversion to AVI and labeling of files. Initial posting credit goes to the myanonamouse.net uploader.

Play Along CDs 1-5 (MP3s @ 128kbps)
I don't have the titles for the CDs and their respective songs as they aren't conveniently located in the front of the lesson book like L&M Drums. This shouldn't be a problem since they're referenced by track number throughout the lesson book.
