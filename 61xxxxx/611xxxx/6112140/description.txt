Control Your Critical Health Care Decisions
The Complete Living Will Kit is an easy-to-use guide to preparing your own living will without the expense of an attorney. A living will, along with a health care power of attorney, provides your family and doctors with instructions for your health care and ensures that your wishes are followed-even if you are unable to speak for yourself. Inside, learn how easy it is to prepare all the documents you may ever need. Simple instructions and samples walk you through filling out your own forms and giving your family the power to carry out your health care wishes.
