Two whimsical, aimless thugs harass and 
assault women, steal, murder, and 
alternately charm, fight, or sprint their 
way out of trouble. They take whatever the 
bourgeois characters value: whether it\'s cars, 
peace of mind, or daughters. Marie-Ange, a jaded, 
passive hairdresser, joins them as lover, cook, 
and mother confessor. She\'s 
on her own search for seemingly unattainable sexual 
pleasure.

A french 70\'s masterpiece!
