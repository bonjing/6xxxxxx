DJANGO REINHARDT IN SOLITAIRE : COMPLETE RECORDINGS FOR SOLO GUITAR [1937-1950]b]
Label Definitive 
Orig Year 2005
Format:Mp3@320



Between dozens of recordings made from 1937 to 1950, legendary French gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt waxed one, maybe two titles of solo guitar per year. Often it was less than that. Sometimes he made them at the request of the producers, who surely heard him warming up and decided to capture on records some of that magic atmosphere. Then Django took his instrument and performed whatever was on his mind: in occasions fully developed solo compositions; another times, instantly made up improvisations. This outstanding CD comprises them all for the first time in chronological order, including some very rare tracks and a recently discovered solo from a radio program as a bonus track.
