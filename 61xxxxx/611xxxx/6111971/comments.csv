,ossie7,2011-02-23T22:41Z,"@Devellish: Read the NFO, source is youtube. If you want better quality just buy it!"
,Devellish,2011-02-27T13:20Z,I just gave feedback. I knew the source was Youtube. And why do you think people are on TPB? To buy it? Really? And I'm not even sure if you can buy a cd from FearFM.
,ossie7,2011-02-27T16:30Z,"FearFM has no CD's, but there are dozens of websites who sell Hardcore MP3's for a few cents."
,ossie7,2011-02-27T16:31Z,"Anyway, enjoy the music. Atleast it's easier for you then searching for them one by one on youtube LOL ;)"
