DIRECTOR: Gregori Viens
WRITER: Henry Phillips, Gregori Viens
CAST:
Henry Phillips, Ellen Ratner, Matthew Walker

PLOT:
Winner of the Audience Award at the Slamdance Film Festival,
this uproarious and smart new comedy tells the story of Henry
Phillips, a hapless modern day troubadour who grinds his way
through the heartland, living out of his car and singing his
twisted satirical songs to anyone who will listen. After a
booking mishap involving a Christian fundraiser, he decides
he's hit rock bottom. Seeking to shake things up, he moves to
L.A. where his luck changes overnight. Thanks less to his inept
manager than to a wild case of mistaken identity, he falls
backwards into a string of packed gigs, a record deal and even
the promise of love. But he who lives by the whimsy of show
business dies by it, and reality hits him like a fist in the
face: an innocent miscommunication over a bagel brands him a
neo-Nazi in the world of tabloid journalism. Luckily, somewhere
between rock bottom and nowhere lies the perfect terrain for
his dark and hilarious songs. Hailed by comedy icon Sarah
Silverman as "the best movie about comedy I've seen so far,
" this hilarious and evocative film is "totally primed for a
fervent cult following."
