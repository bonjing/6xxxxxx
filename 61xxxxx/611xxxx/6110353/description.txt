Description

This is a simple and addictive 3D game where you steer around cubes to stay alive. The longer you last, the faster you get and the higher score you earn.

There are helpful power-ups scattered between the cubes. Green boxes slow you down. Blue pyramids make the steering more sensitive.

It has GameCenter integration with exciting challenges and badges.

You can also listen to your music from your iTunes library while playing
