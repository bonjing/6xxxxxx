Wikipedia - Now and Forever: the Hits is the first international compilation album by American R&B/hip hop girl group TLC. Via Arista Records, it was released on September 30, 2003, in most of Japan, November 24, 2003 in the United Kingdom and with a late release on June 21, (see 2004 in music) in North America. The album comprises nearly all of their singles (with the sole exception being "Hands Up," which was inexplicably not included) released between the years of 1991 and 2003, compiling all their albums Ooooooohhh.... On the TLC Tip (1992), CrazySexyCool (1994), FanMail (1999) and 3D (2002), as well as soundtracks to films such as Poetic Justice (1993). Most of the tracks on this album are radio edits in order to fit all of the songs on one disc. While featuring new material, the greatest hits disc contains rare tracks such as a 2003 production "Come Get Some," which featured Sean Paul and Lil Jon of YoungBloodZ, and an exclusive censored version of the song "Whoop De Woo" (a leftover track from the 3D recording sessions (2002)) and a digital download of "I Bet," the single which featured winner O'so Krispie from their UPN reality television R U the Girl. All "singles" on the album appear in their original radio released format. The album debuted to number 53 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart in its opening week with about 26,000 copies sold. However, the album did well in Latin America, peaking in Mexican International album charts at #3 and was certified Gold in late 2004 (50,000 sold). The album has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide.
