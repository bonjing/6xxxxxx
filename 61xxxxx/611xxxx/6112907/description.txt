Transmission was a song by Joy Division that The Smashing Pumpkins used as the final encore at most concerts of their 1998 Adore Tour. Lasting anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes, the song evolved over the course of the tour, and because it was highly improvisational, each performance is very different.

Here are 13 of the best performances, covering the entire span of the tour. Most of them are recordings of FM broadcasts, so the sound quality is great. There are a few audience recordings however.

Enjoy!
