Highway Child
Sanctuary Come (2009)

ROADBURN FESTIVAL 2011 - April 14- 17 013 Venue & Midi Theatre Tilburg - Holland

Highway Child got together back in â€™05. Using a formula combining classic rock and rhythm & blues they simply canâ€™t go wrong. 

From the beginning the bandâ€™s philosophy has been a raw, swinging and rattling rhythm group with a strong vocal in front, all appearing vigorous and real. 

Roskilde Festival Wrote:

Highway Child is for everyone addicted to classic rock â€“ all the good old stuff from MC5 to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. The lads are already an experienced and hardened live band â€“ and despite sold-out shows, an album recorded and ready, and rave mentions in the underground, they still have no record deal. This band should end up in the same league as the best garage rock bands of our time.
