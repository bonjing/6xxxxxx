Description

Why doesnâ€™t the monster ever get the happy ending?

Now, in a magical kingdom far, far away, YOU get to design a monster, give it life, and unleash it upon the people! Play as the WackyLands Boss, and make those nasty knights, heroes, and shrieking princesses PAY!

BUILD YOUR MONSTER
Design and customize your own princess-eating monsterâ€™s face, body, arms and legs. Make him or her as gruesome, funny or cool as you want! Was your monster voted â€˜Most likely to demolish an entire kingdomâ€™ in high school? Only you can decide!

ROAM THE KINGDOM
In twelve colourful, side-scrolling scenarios, rampage across the kingdom, mauling, stomping and incinerating all in your path! From the forest, into villages, across the icy tundra and finally into the castles themselves, terrorise the whole kingdom of Trogon and reclaim your dignity! Wipe out swarms of pesky warriors and wizards, then munch down on some interfering princesses to restore your health!

GRAB NEW GEAR, SEIZE NEW SKILLS!
As you pillage and plunder the kingdom, use your gold coins to buy monster evolutions, new weapons, armor, and ridiculous special items for your monster! Level up, and train up new powers including stomping, fire-breathing, and other special attacks designed to do maximum damage!

BRAG ABOUT YOUR SWAG
Compete for top scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, and show off your own custom-designed monster with a post to your Facebook or Twitter account!


After all... why should the heroes get to have all the fun?
