Wild New World, also known as Prehistoric America, is a 6-part British documentary series about Ice Age America (United States). Like several other BBC programmes, it contains both computer graphics and real life animals. Occasionally, footage of non-American counterparts of the extinct American beasts (like the American lion and the giant American cheetah) are used in juxtaposition with footage of native American animals, like the pronghorn.

Torrent consists of:

1. Land of the Mammoth
2. Canyonlands
3. Ice-Age Oasis
4. Edge of the Ice
5. American Serengeti
6. Mammoths to Manhattan
