Description from Dans Workshop:
You've probably heard of or even built Dave Gingery's Lil' Bertha melting furnace. I built it, and absolutely loved it! Way to go Dave! However, there were a few things I thought to improve after the brief but productive life of my original Lil' Bertha. Heavy duty firebrick with sawn grooves for the element, and a GREAT home brew recipe for lightweight refractory are the major 
improvements.
