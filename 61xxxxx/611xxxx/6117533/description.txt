From Wiki:


Junkhouse was a noted Canadian alternative rock band of the 1990s.

Formed in 1989 in Hamilton, Ontario,[1] the band consisted of vocalist and guitarist Tom Wilson,[2] guitarist Dan Achen, bassist Russ Wilson and drummer Ray Farrugia. (Despite their shared surname, Tom and Russ Wilson were not related.)

The band got its first widespread exposure opening for Crash Vegas on that band's tour to support their debut album, Red Earth. Crash Vegas member Colin Cripps was one of Junkhouse's early mentors and supporters.

In 1993, the band signed to Sony Records, and released a Sony Music publishing demo Here Lies Happiness, which was a collection of their early recordings. In September 1993 they released their official debut, Strays, and promoted the album by touring as an opening act for The Waltons and Soul Asylum. That album was produced by Malcolm Burn, and produced radio hits for the band with "Out of My Head", "Prayin' for the Rain" and "Big Brown Turtle".

The band was also featured on the soundtrack to the television show Due South. Their cover of the song "Oh, What a Feeling" is on the first of the two soundtracks from the Paul Haggis show.

In 1995, they released Birthday Boy, which included a duet with Sarah McLachlan on the song "Burned Out Car".

Russ Wilson left the band in 1996, and was replaced by Grant Marshall.

In 1997 Colin Cripps joined the band after the dissolution of Crash Vegas.[3] Junkhouse released their final album, Fuzz which was primarily written by Wilson and Cripps.[4] Following that album, the band members went their separate ways. Tom Wilson has released two solo albums, Planet Love in 2001 and Dog Years in 2006, and has collaborated with Stephen Fearing and Colin Linden in the supergroup Blackie and the Rodeo Kings.

Although no longer recording, the band still performs together occasionally, most recently with Finger Eleven at a tsunami benefit in Hamilton on February 2, 2005.[1]

The group reunited on November 7, 2009 to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a concert at Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern.[1]

Dan Achen owned Catherine North Studio in Hamilton. Several internationally known artists have recorded at Catherine North over the past 10 years, including Achenâ€™s niece Feist. At a 2008 concert at Hamilton Place, the Grammy-nominated singer held up her favourite red guitar and proudly announced that it was a gift from "Uncle Dan".

In 2008, Achen co-produced a Juno-winning album Bring Me Your Love, a solo project by Dallas Green of the platinum-selling rock band Alexisonfire.

Dan Achen died on March 15, 2010 of a heart attack while playing hockey.[5] On March 20, 2010, Ron McLean profiled Dan Achen and Junkhouse with a segment prior to the Leafs-Canadiens game on Hockey Night in Canada.
