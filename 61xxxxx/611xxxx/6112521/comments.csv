Anyone who's as predujiced against gay's as you must themselves be a flaming homosexual... That's a rather typical correlation.  Ironic isn't it? Ironic that one who screams fire for all to hear is actually a raging flaming inferno.  LoL!  You're such a pathetic human being.  Since when is being gay a bad thing, is that all you've got, just gay slurs?  You're an self-conscious, inadequate boy who's scared of his own sexuality so you project it has a manifestation of hatred.... "
