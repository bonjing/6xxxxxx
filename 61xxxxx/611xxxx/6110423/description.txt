Description

The Band in your pocket, now a Universal App!

Canupa Band deluxe features eight easy-to-play instruments with four entirely new sets!

The Octopus Organ:
- one full octave (13 keys)
- multitouch
- four groovy sounds (e.g. hammond organ)

The Ducky Xylophone:
- slide through an octave, 9 keys

The Grashopper Violin:
- play wonderful tunes by sliding over the fingerboard

The Turtle Maracas:
- tap or shake for some great rattle rhythms

Of course our four old friends from the light version are coming, too:

The Kitten Bongos
The Hamster Trumpet
The Crocodile Ukulele
The Puppy Calimba

All instruments are tuned in e-major, so they sound good together.

But that is not all!
We added PARENTAL CONTROLS:

- Time Limit:
If you don't want your kids to play videogames all day put the app to sleep after a given time - literally!
It was never easier to make your kids turn off the device.
No more struggle, no more nagging.

- Sound Volume Limit:
Prevent ear damage by limiting the maximum sound volume.
This is particularly important when you let your kids play with earphones!

Have fun!
And please write a review and tell all your friends about Canupa Band deluxe.
The more we sell the more instruments and features will be added!
