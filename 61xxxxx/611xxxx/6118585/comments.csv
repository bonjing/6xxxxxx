,Ebay42,2011-01-23T00:24Z,hi can u pls seed on Gran Turismo 5 [EUR][PS3] & Call Of Duty Blacks Ops [PAL & this 1 Thanks U ROCK!!
,Morphined,2011-01-23T12:13Z,"1) Unpack rar somewhere.

2) Transfer the folder to the directory your backup manager uses (either Games, Gamez or some other)
2.a) PS3 doesn't digest NTFS, so you better use FTP transfer (install FileZilla on your PC and BlackBox FTP on the PS3)
2.b) If you have a nice and large external memory device with FAT32 file system, just copy it there, plug into your PS3 and use some kind of a file manager (MultiMan will do) to copy the game from usb to the folder your backup manager uses.

3) Launch your backup manager on PS3

4) Find your game in the list

5) Press LOAD.
5.1)Note that you sometimes need to have a legitimate blu ray inside the PS3

6) Exit to XMB

7) Launch the game that should be loaded by now and look like it's on the bluray you have inserted earlier.

8) Have fun!
8.1) If you have some crashes and hangups - don't panic. Pull of the cord from your PS3 and reinsert it. It happens every now and then, but it's totally fine."
,kallstrom_74,2011-01-23T12:20Z,link to modified EBOOT please.... will this game work on 3.41?

,Boot4se,2011-01-23T22:14Z,"Works great. Running on Kmeaw 3.55 CFW. Using Gaia, Rogero, and MultiMAN BM's. Works great. PSN access too. For any of you still on 3.41, this CFW works great. Guide at gXkJkP (bitly link). Brick chance is minimum w/ Kmeaw CFW."
,joolet88,2011-01-24T18:21Z,"I would say stay on 3.41 ppl, allmost every game worked with 3.41. I upgraded to Kmeaw 3.55 CFW with lv2 patch, and now I can only play like 20% of the game I have."
,masseus,2011-01-25T21:54Z,Sorry for asking guys but how do i make these games work on my PS3. I haven't modified it and have tried to install the Rogero Manager v7.9a and it doesn't seem to work. Any advice would be much appreciated!

,djbaaz,2011-05-16T15:59Z,"3.55 GUYS:

Dont overwrite with the included eboot (3.41)
just unpack and move the files via ftp/extern harddisk.
and start the game from XMB"
