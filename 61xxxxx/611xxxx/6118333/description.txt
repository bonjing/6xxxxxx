comment please and let me know if your getting good, or any, download speed. this is my second try at uploading so im not sure if thisll work. 

this is Harry Lorayne from his 1990 course that has 5 cassettes plus you should download his ebook that is on this site as well. i dont have the ebook in this download.

it helps you to remember:

numbers
faces
locations
languages
dates
card counting
anything.



theres 11 sections that he goes through. awesome course thatll change your life if you take the time to learn it.
