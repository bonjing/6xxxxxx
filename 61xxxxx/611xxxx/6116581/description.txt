This cd has been around as MP3 for a while, but I know the afficionados will apreciate a lossless version.

Review ( http://www.allmusic.com/album/musique-and-sweet-poetrie-hybrid-sacd-w149291/review ):

The subtitle of this album is "Jewels from Europe around 1600," and the "Jewels" could as well be applied to Emma Kirkby's voice and Jakob Lindberg's lute playing -- delicate but strong, beguiling, throwing off brilliant light. Kirkby's light soprano is ideal for this repertoire -- absolutely pure, but full of character and expressiveness, with a security that makes her singing sound effortless. She is well matched by Lindberg's playing, which is fleet and nuanced. He plays a sixteenth century instrument with exceptionally mellow tone that is thought to be the oldest lute still in use. Together, Kirkby and Lindberg draw the listener in as a companion with whom they are sharing precious intimacies. The songs and lute solos are eclectic, by English, Flemish, German, Italian, French, and Polish composers. The songs by the better-known English composers, such as Dowland and Morley, stand out for their expressiveness, but others, particularly the songs of Sigismondo d'India, are remarkable for their harmonic and vocal eccentricities, and the variety of the repertoire keeps the album consistently engaging. The sound of the SACD is clear and bright, and the balance between voice and lute is excellent. ~ Stephen Eddins
