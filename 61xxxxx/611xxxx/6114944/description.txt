The Best of Wedding Photojournalism Techniques and Images for Professional Digital Photographers.

In contrast to a traditional wedding photographer, a wedding photojournalist works unobtrusively to capture the â€œreal lifeâ€ flavor of the special event as it unfolds, and this guidebook addresses the unique challenges and specific preparations required to excel in this field. Calling upon the best and brightest photojournalists to share their images and insights, this updated edition reveals the secrets for capturing all the breathtaking exchanges between the personalities, so that the photographs tell a story rich in detail. Many topics are also covered, such as how to meet and mingle with the main players at a wedding, what to expect in terms of a timeline, what shots cannot be missed, and how to minimize the distractions of flashes, bulky equipment, and verbal requests. Before, during, and after the ceremonyâ€”indoors and outâ€”this volume is brimming with advice for every aspect of the shoot, including selecting equipment and lighting, working with an assistant, properly archiving digital files, and selecting a beautiful heirloom-quality album design.
