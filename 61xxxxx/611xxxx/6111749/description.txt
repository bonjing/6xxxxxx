. 
We came out from the deep 
To learn to love, to learn how to live 
We came out from the deep 
To avoid the mistake we made 
That's why we are here ! 
. 
We came out from the deep 
To help and understand, but not to kill 
It takes many lives till we succeed 
To clear the debts of many hundreds years 
That's why we are here !
