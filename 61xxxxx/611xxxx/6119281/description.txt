  PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER 2011 is here and will bring digital soccer to the next
  level. Central to the heart and soul of PES 2011 is the idea of freedom of
  play. This freedom invigorates the series with the most advanced set of
  gameplay improvements ever attempted by the Winning Eleven Production team,
  coupled with the greatest stride in new content. The result will be a game
  that allows total control over every element of play - even online - to give
  the most lifelike soccer experience next to actually putting on a uniform and
  taking the field.Features:Total Control: PES Productions has enhanced the
  360-degree passing ratio, offering unprecedented levels of control over every
  pass, shot, throw-in, through ball and lofted through balls. Users can pass
  the ball into space, and move their play with total freedom. Players must
  precisely weight their passes and second-guess the runs of their team-mates
  and exploit their movement. Players even can apply pressure on opponents to
  force them off the ball.Shot & Stamina Gauge: In addition to the generic
  power gauge, the Shot & Stamina meter details the player's exact level of
  fitness. Constantly sprinting will have an adverse affect on performance and
  statistics.New Defender AI: Defenders now hold their positions naturally,
  instead of chasing balls that enter their area and work to close down the
  attacker to force mistakes.Animation and Player Physics: PES Productions has
  totally reworked every element of in-game animation. These additions will
  become clear before even kick-off, with the players enjoying fluid, natural
  movements, with more realistic acceleration and inertia than ever before. The
  physicality between players is also improved, which was a priority requested
  in PES forums. Jostling and blocking now looks stunning, while there is a
  larger variety of convincing tackling styles. Ambient animation also adds
  immensely to the in-game atmosphere, as players behave realistically when off
  the ball, and walk and run with a variety of individual styles.Speed of Play:
  The new level of control means that PES 2011 enjoys a more varied pace of
  play, which depends on the situation at hand. The game will burst into life
  as counter-attacks come into play, but players can dictate the pace via slow
  build up or exploiting available space to surge forward. It is harder to make
  long runs from midfield, and successful play will depend on making quick
  passes to create space.Aesthetics: PES 2010 showcased the best likenesses in
  a football game, and PES 2011 ups the ante further. Facial animation has been
  enhanced, but the key advances are over 1000 all-new animations which have
  been recreated from the ground up using over 100 hours of motion captured
  footage yielding more organic runs, turns, throw-ins, tackles, and
  interaction. Tactical and Strategy: The PES Productions team has implemented
  an all new 'Drag and Drop' mechanism that can be used in every aspect of team
  management. These settings are also animated to promote better understanding
  of the plays that have been altered.Feint settings: PES has always offered a
  wide range of subtle skills, feints and turns, but PES 2011 allows users to
  map their favourite move sequences to the right stick, making them more
  accessible than ever before.Master League Online: PES 2011 will mark the
  online debut for its much-loved Master League element, with players bidding
  against each other for the world's best players, and attempting to build a
  squad that can compete with the best against online peers all over the globe.
