,ichilly,2011-05-02T12:06Z,"Thank you, great torrent...
Although I wouldn't call in 'Best' collection...
I wouldn't pay a dime for most of them...
Even got it free thru away more than half of them before installing...Not exactly as the header promises, but the best thing is: a) can get it free, b) there is lots of them...
Seeding, while deleting some of the unwanted members of this collection..."
,Heromist,2011-08-19T22:38Z,"@sparkyhollyhead hey guy, look if your having issues what you need to do is go here on your pc:
C:\WINDOWS\Fonts then unzip the files or what ever and add them to that folder :) done"
,ksm933,2011-09-17T20:20Z,"@@@ Installation Instructions @@@

Go to the folder where the fonts are located,

Do a search for the fonts in the main folder containing the fonts,

Ctrl+A to select all of them

Open \Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Fonts

Drag the fonts from the search into this.

Windows will install the fonts.

Done."
,wakeupscreaming,2011-10-07T22:18Z,"This is a decoy file.
Probably being seeded by a font company.
I checked the fonts -- these are not the most expensive at all. 90% of them you can download off dafont.com. If you are looking for a simple download with alot of fonts, then download this. But this ISN'T a collection of nice or expensive fonts."
