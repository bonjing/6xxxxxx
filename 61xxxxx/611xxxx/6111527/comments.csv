,deadweasel,2011-01-19T01:39Z,"Question: are these compressed or are they the original wav files?  Too many folks out there think they're doing people a favor by compressing them, but the originals contain beat and key information that the core program (MusicMaker) can use to make using these samples seamless and easy.
MP3 format adds gaps to the sounds, making them useless for looping.  Ogg makes MM twitch and crash at random when it tries to preview them. "
[T],trialanderror,2011-01-19T09:01Z,"I can understand your concern. The content of the folders is untouched, they contain the original wav files. The folders are just rar packed for convenient web transfer, which is a lossless compression and thus fully restorable."

,30stmxo,2011-07-02T16:57Z,"When I try to put the music into the editing area a message pops up saying 'The file format (blah blah blah) cannot be read by Magix Music Maker. 
Please ensure that the affected drive is not full or write-protected' 
Do you know how I can fix this?"
[T],trialanderror,2011-07-12T18:03Z,@30stmxo: You need to extract the rar files first. use 7z or winrar if unsure.
