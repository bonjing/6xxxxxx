December 2010 was the coldest in Britain since records began. This film tells the story of the extreme weather of 2010, and explores the science behind why Britain came to a frozen halt.

Britain's roads were in chaos; planes were strewn over runways as airports ground to a halt; thousands of cars were abandoned; trains and passengers froze overnight; ambulance services had their busiest day ever; and lives were lost as a deadly freeze gripped the country.

All over Britain people suffered inconvenience, hardship and danger. There were heroic rescues, tales of human tragedy and heartwarming stories of survival against the odds.
