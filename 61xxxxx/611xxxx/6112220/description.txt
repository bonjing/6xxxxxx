Music : Classical : Lossless
The Hungarian String Quartet was a musical ensemble of world renown, particularly famous for its performances of quartets by Beethoven and BartÃ³k. The quartet was founded in Budapest in 1935 (as the New Hungarian Quartet) and was disbanded in 1972.

There are two complete cycles of the Beethoven quartets, both recorded in Paris:
Mono: 1953 set with the SzÃ©kely-Moszkowsky-Koromzay-Palotai line-up.
and the Stereo set (1960s) with the SzÃ©kely-Kuttner-Koromzay-Magyar group.

The latest is presented here. This is part of the 50 cds "Beethoven, The Collector`s Edition" box set by Emi France, that came out at 2007.

In the purpose of better accommodating the contents of this album, I have made some changes in the order of the quartets so that they can all fit in 7 cds, instead of the 8 Cds that occupy in the box set.
