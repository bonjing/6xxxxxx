The extremely easy-to-use File Renamer allows you to rename many files at once. Version 2.0 added the ability to rename folders. In addition, you can rename MP3 files based on ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, and you get a tag editor. The renaming features apply to sequential numbers, letters, dates, file filters, and you can find or replace part of the filename. You can delete characters, put letters in uppercase or lowercase, add or remove file extensions, and place separators in multiple locations.
