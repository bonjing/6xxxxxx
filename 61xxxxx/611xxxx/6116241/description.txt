                      http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1523980                 
                                                                          
                                                    
                          
                             
                                 
                                                                          
           This is the incredible story of Pablo Escobar, the             
           infamous boss of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, told         
           for the very first time by his son, Sebastian and his          
           widow Maria Isabel Santos. In Nicolas Entel's film             
           Sebastian tells of his extraordinary childhood, growing        
           up with a father he loved but whom he knew to be               
           Colombia's enemy number one. He tells of times of              
           extraordinary luxury and extravagance, and other times on      
           the run. And Sebastian and his widow open the family           
           vaults to share their private and long hidden archives.        
           But this is also the story of two of Escobar's most            
           prominent victims, the Minister of Justice and a               
           politician about to be elected President of Colombia, as       
           told by their sons. They were among hundreds that Escobar      
           had killed in the 1980's. The film follows Sebastian as        
           he tries to break the cycle of revenge and assassination       
           by seeking reconciliation with the sons of his father's        
           victims.
