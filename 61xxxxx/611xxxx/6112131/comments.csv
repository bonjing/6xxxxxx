[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-18T23:45Z,"This has got everything a die hard 24 fan could want. It's a very large torrent because of all the extra stuff it has. Please seed for as long as possible and keep this excellent show alive.

Thanks."
,VSG12777,2011-01-20T04:00Z,Have these been ripped from the original DVD releases? Is the sound in DD 5.1 format? Widescreen 16:9? Just checking cos most of the torrents don't have 5.1 sound - even the HDTV rips.
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-20T16:49Z,All episodes are DVDRips and the vast majority of the extra stuff. There was some stuff I came across that wasn't DVDRips and I put that in as a bonus. 
,iReturnVideotapes,2011-01-20T19:38Z,"I'm not going to download this, but I just felt the need to say excellent work with the tv shows you've uploaded. For years I've hoped that someone would put together a complete list of tv shows complete with their extra features. You do not disappoint. 

As for requests, if you can manage the time, Six Feet Under, Buffy/Angel, and Charmed would be awesome. I know Buffy and Angel are already uploaded complete with features and I've been meaning to get them done, but they are painfully slow and much too large.

Anyway, yeah I made a brand new account just to say thanks. I appreciate all your hard work."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-20T21:52Z,"iReturnvideotapes, thanks for your support. Next up is Friday Night Lights but I'll add your requests to the list. Keep checking back and I'll get them done when I've got some space on my hard drive."
,gazgaz,2011-01-23T10:35Z,"I was just watching the stargate universe and noted the negative comments; I have been watching it on a 14 ft home theatre screen and it is excellent. If you would not mind I have been creating poorer copies 3 times the size of deep space 9 with tmpg. What are you using?
thanks so much"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-23T15:53Z,"DVDRips wherever possible. They're better quality than HDTV.
Stay tuned to boldy download Star Trek The Next Generation which will be uploaded in a few days time. Make it so with the best show ever. :) "
,gazgaz,2011-01-23T21:37Z,Sniffer; I have all the DVDs I like to remove the noisy intro and credits. that is why I asked which program as you do such a good job. But that is ok thnaks for the great results at such a small file size. Gaz
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-26T23:49Z,"Come on guys, seed it please. There must have been 500 people download this and it's showing 4 seeds. Play fair and seed it at a decent upload rate."

,akshat_c,2011-02-20T19:50Z,"@Sniffer_V
Thanks a million man... I have had all seasons for the past 6 months but couldn't watch them coz of the poor quality.. Thanks to you, now i finally can...:)

A request: If you could upload subs (english) for all seasons as a torrent or on one of the subtitle websites..it would be amazing..

Thanks again.."

I see your sense of irony :-))

""Come on guys, seed it please. There must have been 500 people download this and it's showing 4 seeds. Play fair and seed it at a decent upload rate."" 

@Sniffer_V:
Why do you think, there are so many leechers and only a few seeders???
Not everybody invests in a new harddrive, only to seed this mass of data.
Most uploaders have small upload rates given by their ISP (not more than 1MBit).
How many years should they stay seeding before reaching the 100% mark???
Why didn't you upload these episodes separately?

Slap me!

Just think about that, otherwise keep up the good work :-)"

,AtotehZ,2012-04-19T17:16Z,"I just saw the comments on the low amount of seeds per leeches.. This will almost always happen. People are seeding WHILE downloading as well. Not all people download everything, for that same reason they don't appear as seeders.

It's not the same as not having any speed on the torrent."
,Feixue,2012-06-14T01:44Z,"Would be really nice with some more seeders, please. It should not be a single digit next to the 435 available sources:/"
