They dare to ask 37 Dollars for this program that is a (sure, nice but) rather small tool.
I'm not going for that..."

,Swaffles,2011-02-01T23:51Z,"Thank you, sir, for uploading this. I can now record some videos for my Battlefield 1942 modification. And for those seeders out there, thank you for your seeds. I downloaded this torrent in [literally] 5 or 6 seconds."
,ZeeRuX,2011-02-02T11:09Z,Kiweed - PlayClaw is the absolute WORSE recording software ever. Just look at the idiots homepage where he have posted a youtube-clip where it LAGS AS FREAKING HELL... Either he is retarded or blind... Fraps DONT lag like this.. Not even close.... I have used Fraps 3.2.3 since it came and there is no lag at all....
