beef is a local band from toledo ohio. they are a little bit metal, a little bit industrial, and a little bit hip hop.

"before everything ends forever" their self titled album was released in 2010 by tokyo destruction...

they start their self titled, political referencing, album off with a helluva intro, and continue to keep your attention till the very end. the album "before everything ends forever" lines their tracks up as fallows:
1)last analog broadcast
2)too graphic for young viewers
3)yesterday
4) burn me like a witch
5)happy time junction
6)this one's for you
7)welcome to the real world
8)nothing
9)before everything ends forever
10) autumn '66
