Description

*** NEW VERSION 3 ***

HippoRemote Pro turns your iPhone and iPod touch into a Wi-Fi keyboard, trackpad, and remote control, making it the perfect pocket-sized controller for your computer.

You can do everything a physical keyboard and mouse can do. In addition, like a high-end universal remote, you can customize the buttons and tailor them to specific apps.

HippoRemote Pro also has a gamepad mode, letting you control your favorite PC games.

And because it all works over Wi-Fi, you get superior range and no line-of-sight issues compared to traditional remotes. No extra dongles or expensive adapters required.


FEATURES:

- App Profiles: Customize the trackpad and remote buttons for your favorite apps. Pro ships with 30+ profiles and more are added all the time.

- Profile Editor: Tweak existing profiles, or create brand new profiles, with the built-in editor.

- Dropbox Support: Sync your profiles across multiple devices via Dropbox.

- Multi-touch Trackpad: Multi-Touch gestures up to 4 fingers, including 2-finger scrolling and pinch-to-zoom.

- Keyboard History: Remembers what you've typed before so you can autocomplete with a single tap.

- Thumb Scrolling: Makes precision scrolling a breeze!

- Auto App Switching: Launch or switch between programs with a single tap.

- Login Manager: One tap to auto-fill login information for your favorite web sites.

- Macros: Automate tasks by recording your own keyboard shortcuts.

- Pause on Call: Automatically pause what's playing when you receive a phone call.

- Proximity Sensor: Turn off the screen to conserve battery.

- Wake-on-LAN: Turn on your computer from your couch.

- Background Multitasking: Stay connected in the background for up to 10 minutes.

- Integrated Web Browser: Surf the web, update Facebook, check sports scores, and more, without switching apps and without interrupting what's playing.

- Boxee/Plex/XBMC GesturePad: Tired of buttons? Control Boxee, Plex, and XBMC with flicks and swipes.

- GamePad: Handles all your favorite PC games, including ones that require simultaneous keyboard and mouse input.
