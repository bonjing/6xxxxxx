This is a hacked version of 2011 Maps Navteq for Becker NTG 2 DVD Navigation.
The disk has been tested on my car.

If you have an older software, first wait for a software update as a first step.
It's an automatic system.
Don't interrupt this process; first time for me lasted about 15 minutes (bad disk)!
Usually will take 3-5 minutes!


What's new compared to original Mercedes v12 (2010) maps?
- Newer POS's and maps (2011)
- Now you search for the name of the street first, not the type.

Write the image using IMGBurn and a good DVD+R blank (Verbatim recommended)
