http://www.mp3tera.org/classical/Leonard-Bernstein---The-Symphony-Edition--60-CD---2010---FLAC--43421.html

Scroll down until you see 'Download' in green and the links are below. If you do not have a premium account with h-o-t-f-i-l-e  (3 months unlimited download can be bought for less than $10 on ebay) then use the excellent Cryptload (the sister application of uttorrent) to download these links.  It will not be as fast as a premium account but it will do the job!"
