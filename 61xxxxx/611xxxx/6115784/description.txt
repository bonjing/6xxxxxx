Dragon Ball (ãƒ‰ãƒ©ã‚´ãƒ³ãƒœãƒ¼ãƒ«Doragon BÅru?) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. It was originally serialized in Weekly ShÅnen Jump from 1984 through 1995; later the 519 individual chapters were published into 42 tankÅbon volumes by Shueisha. Dragon Ball was inspired by the Chinese folk novel Journey to the West. It follows the adventures of Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven mystical objects known as the Dragon Balls, which can summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls for their own desires.
