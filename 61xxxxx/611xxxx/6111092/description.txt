Release Title:  Season Of The Witch 2011 TELESYN H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Dominic Sena
Tagline:
A 14th century Crusader returns to a homeland devastated by the Black Plague. A beleaguered
church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the two knights to transport an
accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will perform a ritual in hopes of ending the
pestilence. A priest, a grieving knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can
only dream of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness and
fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party arrives at the abbey,
a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge to ensure the girl fair treatment, and
pits them against an inexplicably powerful and destructive force.
