,BinkyDeath,2012-01-29T14:22Z,"To the uploader - Please please *please* don't stamp your name on the video; it totally ruins the video having to look at your name for the whole movie. The quality of the video automatically goes down if you've stuck your name on the picture, especially when we can't turn it off because you've hard-coded it onto the picture.
The English audio is fine but the Hindi audio sounds pretty terrible. Not sure why that is - unless you took someone else's rip, stamped your name on it and recorded the Hindi track instead of ripping it and then pasted it onto the original rip.
Another reason you shouldn't stamp your name on the video is because it's a sure-fire way for the authorities to track YOU down and make SURE YOU are the one prosecuted if/when you get caught. And you're asking to be caught when you put your name on it. It's far more easy to track a stamped copy of a file than an unstamped one. It's really not a clever thing to do for mostly for the reasons I've said.
The picture is pretty fuzzy for the pixel size, especially when you consider how large the file size is.
This copy is better than nothing, but to be honest, with the mistakes made in how this rip/recording was created, there are better versions available. One such version I've found has no stamp, has more than two audio tracks (each of good quality), and the only real difference is that the pixel ratio is smaller - BUT - because of the fuzziness on this video, this other smaller version is the same quality on full-screen.
...Which could mean this copy is just a file that has been copied from that other smaller file and enlarged so it can be labelled as high-definition (except it's not high-definition at all, it's just a large fuzzy pixel ratio).
High-definition means a good quality picture in a large size - NOT a large picture size in a fuzzy quality.
This video IS a large pixel ratio and WOULD be high-definition IF it was also good quality - but since it's not, it can't truly be labelled as high-definition.
I mean no offence to the uploader but felt I had to post this for future downloaders. :/
It's not an extremely bad copy, but the quality would be unacceptable on a film or computer-animated video. You can just about get away with this quality for a sharply-drawn cartoon animation.
To the uploader again - if you ripped and recorded this yourself, I'd suggest that you take a look at the techniques used by some of the best rippers and uploaders on ThePirateBay. These include how to rip, how to compress (and which software you should use, the best is all available for free if you use Linux as your OS) it hard, how to sharpen the picture and adjust the colours to bring it back to high-definition without bringing the file size up again... and more.
This file, if it was high quality could easily be brought down below 400MB (far less than 300MB for this file's actual quality to be honest). I can't teach you the techniques, but thought I'd let you know where to find the info if you're looking to become a good, well-known and trusted uploader for the future.
My first language is not Hindi, but I'll be very interested in watching films in Hindi soon as I'm learning the language (I'm hoping to make it my fourth fluent language), and so I'd love to see you learn how to do great quality rips in future so I (and everyone else) can benefit from your work. :)
I've seen movies that are over 2 hours long be ripped from BRay discs that have a file size of only 250MB and they are truly high-definition. (Seen the same with multiple audio and subtitle tracks and the file size isn't much larger.) If that can be done, that may be your goal. ;)
Anyway, I hope you don't take my post the wrong way. Good luck with learning the tricks to creating a great quality rip. You've got potential. ;)
Trust me - from me that is a high compliment. :)"
