,SirMaxy,2011-01-21T16:58Z,"tpbuservn : That´s what you get if you don´t block the program accessing the internet using a firewall.
the software is working perfectly under this serial. "
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-22T05:01Z,"To be sure, just dont use program with internet on"
,mehest,2011-01-22T12:55Z,"This is actually 6.0.4 or .7.

The serial DOES NOT work with 6.5.1.

Don't bother with it. "
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-22T16:30Z,"Serial works perfect, but DONT use this program with your internet on! It contacts the home network and invalidates serial like a FAG! lol

p.s. Is this the latest version of this software?"

,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-23T07:41Z,"You register with your internet on, close the program, and never open the program again with the internet on"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-23T09:38Z,"Ok listen to me very carefully to get an UPDATED version of this program for free!!!!!!

First off, go to Xilisoft.com and download the latest version of this program.

1) Install program with the internet on

2) Use the following serial to register the program:

NAME: Any name you want

CODE: 1A77-F1B4-A5C5-ECA9-C8AC-B199-CC82-5F00

3) Untick ""Check for updates automatically"" in preferences

3) Close program immediately afterwards. All done, please read below...

----------------------------------------------------

You have two choices:

1) ********** DO NOT USE PROGRAM WITH THE INTERNET ON!!! **********

OR

2) ***** Block Program with: McAfee Total Protection (or similar firewall) > Firewall > Program Permissions > vc.exe > Block *****

YOU'RE VERY WELCOME! ENJOY!"

,osriccc,2011-05-01T17:39Z,"If anyone found the way to make it work again, please share. I mean, I installed it, enjoyed 3 or 5 video conversions, then it wen tunregistered again. I left converting ALL my short film videos from Mac's Mov to MP4 and they only went into 3 mins. max lenght. I've downloaded every single version of Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate and none will work again... PLEASE HELP!"
,osriccc,2011-05-01T18:34Z,"Ok, so if you need to convert HDVs o HD MP4 or similar, get the Xilisoft HD Video Converter and be sure to use the crack correctly. It's working good and has the same features from Ultimate I need (HD in various formats including MPEG2, MP4, MOV, etc.) without any noticeable quality loss. Buy the program if you're needing that professionally."
,Pantera1989,2011-05-04T08:31Z,"Hi if you want to still use Xilisoft Ultimate but can't due to crack just download the portable version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6211906/Xilisoft_Video_Converter_Ultimate_6.5.1_Portable

It is very good too. Put in a folder for itself and use it normally. It will create some local registry entries in the folder it is created. If it gets unregistered just delete the local registry entries and it will be registered once again."
,RADI0EDIT,2011-05-11T19:01Z,fast download + works perfectly. thanks!
,sodade_21,2011-05-29T04:48Z,worked just fine! i think this is the best converter i had since total video converter. is easy ..support almost every known video/audio format..work with Flv videos and its uber fast..it also has some advanced options if you like to mess with but its not a nessecity if you just want a quick and very easy way to convert your vids ;)

REMEMBER: if this program invalidates your crack ONCE, you cannot crack it again. NO ONE at this point knows what trace the program leaves. Your only option is to download and crack the PLATINUM or HD version of this program!"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-06-21T09:51Z,"can I also just say this program is a PIECE OF SHIT! I wasted so much time with it. It converts like crap and makes unreasonably high file sizes.

Use HANDBRAKE. It's free and ENCODES, therefore files are SMALLER, and QUALITY IS BETTER!

i followed (or tried to) your instructions, my version of XVCU^ only just stopped working. i think i did the right stuff with the firewall; using windows 7... i entered VC.exe and update.exe manually but couldn't see any association in the file path with xilisoft; is this unusual? and so, when i came to change the registry i couldn't find it in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT folder...? is it possible that xilisoft have changed the location of the entry? incidentally i downloaded the latest version off their site. i've had this on my computer before and none of the serials seemed to work, i uninstalled and re0installed with my LAN turned off each time also...?

i figured it out, as i'm using windows seven, i had to block two .exe files, but they don't show up as .exe. files in explorer... i ""added firewall rules"" to 'vc' and 'vc loader' and thus far this has worked, when following @megamiaows guidelines; also the registry entry didn't appear as he/she'd described so i searched for ""{1F7B5093-119B-4c50-B705-658A231CEC4B}"" in regedit and that found it (i hope!) deleted it anyway... by the way: you've shown a lot of interest in this software @xxxchromaticxxx to say you think it's a piece of shit!!! ;-)"

,negrrrito,2011-08-22T00:29Z,"Megamiaow instructions are spot on.  I am copying them below for ease of use.  The one thing I will add, is that the regedit solution given is for Win7 64 bit only.  If you have been de-activated and have Win7 32 bit, then you have to delete the same entry, but it is found in a diff place (see below):

,bzrwon,2011-09-19T19:53Z,"OK to all the noobs giving xxxchromaticxxx a hard time for trying to help them, pls hush. If you follow his instructions step by step, it WORKS PERFECTLY fine! Easiest instructions I've had for a long time, you don't even have to use a patch or keygen, which saved me using an AV and MBAM to scan it. I successfully converted a 43 min/177MB .mp4 file to avi,  so far this has the quickest time of any of the other converters out there and trust me, I've used pretty much all of them, everything from WinAVI to AVS, even the free ones like Any Video Converter, Freemake, etc they all had their pros and cons but so far this has been the most reliable in over all conversion quality and speed.
Handbrake is excellent but it's also very limited to what it can do, if you want more variety, then I say use this.
There are a few cons to this though, the interface is a little confusing compared to most, as I like been able to change the bitrate and file size it took me a while to find the advanced options (they're hidden away at the top right hand corner) but once I did it was pretty simple to figure out from there, also the amount of disk space it takes up compared to a lot of the others ends up been about 107 MB in total but in this day and age that isn't really a problem."
,quicksdraws,2011-09-21T02:34Z,Followed megamiaow's advice and I can confirm that it works as well.  Thanks!
,torqueing,2011-10-21T17:29Z,"This is the easy way. A step-by-step guide

Do this through Windows Firewall and it's simple. Remember to install the version in the RAR first.:

1. Download and extract (obviously)
2. Turn off internet connection (best to pull the cable or disconnect via router)
3. Install, probably best not to start.
4. Go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> Windows Firewall -> Advanced Settings. 

   a. Click on ""Outbound Rules"" (on the left)
   b. Click on ""New Rule""
   c. make sure the radio button is on ""Program"" and click next
   d. make sure the radio button is on ""This program path"" and click ""browse""
   e. Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Xilisoft\Video Converter Ultimate 6 (for 64bit systems. Change the path if you installed it somewhere else), select vc and click open.
   f. make sure the radio button is on ""Block the connection"" and click next.
   g. make sure all the boxes are ticked and click next
   h. Give it a name and bingo you're done

5. Do the same as above for ""vcloader"" in the same location.
6. Open program and go to Tools-> Preferences and remove the tick from ""check for updates..."". Then go to Help -> Enter License Code"" and enter the one you were given in the rar. It should be fine.

Two more things to note:
1. Now, you can go and download the new version and because the file-names/path are the same there is no need to enter a different code. This will probably work for the whole 6.x series
2. Test the firewall rules are working like this open the program and go to Help -> Check for updates. You should receive an error starting with ""Failed to connect to network...""

Enjoy"
,Achintya0,2011-10-24T14:42Z,"To all my Pirate friends,
I'm just telling u the ultimate process how to register & get the full version of Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate [any v6.x.x.x version].
just follow the steps below [remember follow exactly as I said]:

1) Download the latest Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate setup file from the official website.
www.xilisoft.com

2) Disable the internet connection in ur computer. [must do it now]

3) Install the Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate software u have downloaded or any of the versions u have.

4) Don't open or run it.
Now Block vc.exe, vc_buy.exe, vcloader.exe and Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate 6 Update.exe from windows firewall or any other firewall included softwares.
If u installed any firewall included anti-virus softwares (as AVG Internet Security etc.) then block using the software, otherwise if ur windows firewall is active then block using it.

5) Now if you have Win7, 64bit, then open up registry & look for and delete this entry:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{1F7B5093-119B-4c50-B705-658A231CEC4B}
or If you have Win7, 32bit, then open up registry & look for and delete this entry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{1F7B5093-119B-4c50-B705-658A231CEC4B}

6) Now open xilisoft program installed and register with any name and use any one of these serials:
1A77-F1B4-A5C5-ECA9-C8AC-B199-CC82-5F00 [recomended for newer versions]
or
ismail-2010-B00A-C6B4FF6-9A90-593E-172E
or
8S366-BAHMAN-H41259-C61C-F316-A8BC-4AA2

7) Turn off Automatic Updates inside the xilisoft program installed.

8) Re-enable internet.

Now enjoy the full version...
I have tested the process on the following versions:
Xilisoft video converter ultimate v6.5.2.0214, v6.5.3.0310, v6.6.0.0623, v6.7.0.0913

Enjoy friends..."
