,crovo,2011-01-27T17:23Z,great! thanks a lot!
,deftond,2011-03-12T19:44Z,"I already have the goonies, what I would like to know is if there is anything different about this rip.  Both versions are 114 minutes long.  Now if it is the 25 anniversary edition it should have the deleted scenes...so the run time should be a little longer.  I guess there is an octopus that was originally deleted.
Can anyone help me out here?  I tried to google it.  Amazon didnt really list a difference of run times.  I would be killer if we could have a dvd iso with the extras included.

Thank you for your sharing by the way!!!"
