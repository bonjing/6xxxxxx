Jean-Michel Pilc has established himself as one of the major jazz pianists to
emerge from Europe around the beginning of the 21st century. Joined by Mingus
Big Band bassist Boris Kozlov and veteran drummer Billy Hart, Pilc mixes
creative arrangements of several familiar songs with his demanding
originals. His take of Cole Porter's "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" is full of
humor (adding a quick dash of "You and the Night in the Music") while retaining
a sensual undercurrent and a sense of adventure with his wild variations, with
potent solos all around. Pilc's adaptation of "Try to Remember" (from the
long-running Broadway musical The Fantastiks) incorporates dissonant bass chords
and several twists that keep it from getting overly sentimental, while the
haunting "Relic" is a reworking of a Franz Schubert theme. The high point of
Pilc's compositions is his five-part suite "True Story," which incorporates many
contrasting styles in its brief segments. Although many jazz journalists have
high regard for the work of Jean-Michel Pilc, he remains a treasure awaiting
discovery by many American jazz fans.
