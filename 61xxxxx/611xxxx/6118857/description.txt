Bunny Wailer was both the quietest and most spiritually creative of the Wailers. However, he also had a dancehall Rockers edge that was best exemplified by the album Bunny Wailer Sings the Wailers in which he reinterprets some of the Wailers material as a solo Roots singer backed by a solid Sly & Robbie based Roots reggae grouping. The album was produced by Bunny Wailer, recorded at Harry J studies. These tracks are re-worked classic Wailers tracks.
