,Flaerley,2011-03-04T23:57Z,"After the installation is completed a command prompt opens up and does nothing...when I try to close it, it crashes. 
???
Profit...
I'm running a ware version of windows 7 64-bit. So far I havent detected any problems with my windows so I think this doesnt work with windows 7. Is anyone able to confirm ?"
,miguelsz3,2011-03-05T06:50Z,Im not a hundred percent on this but I think sure it doesnt support 64-bit systems.
,drlowrey,2011-03-21T06:07Z,"this is v4.1.3 (current ver. as of this date) and the included key works. i've run it on 64-bit version of Vista but it installed as a 32-bit prog.

follow the instructions exactly else what happened to me could happen to you. upon installation complete i let the start program run and began my screen capture project figuring i would register it later.

when my project completed i saw their website URL displayed in the upper left corner of the screen which i later read was the ""watermark"" of the trial version.

follow instructions to get it registered first before undertaking any real work.

THANKS MILLIONS to miguelsz3 for the up and for all the 30 some seeders that helped get me this app downloaded in just minutes. i will remain to seed for as long as i can."
,equazcion,2011-04-09T09:06Z,"Doesn't work correctly for me on Win7 x64. 

I can record the upper-left corner of the screen, but the controls for changing the recorded screen area don't show up at all. The program window is just a big black box.

Thanks anyway tho."
,zfahrenheit,2011-04-10T08:44Z,it does not work well with Windows 7 x64bit. I had two computers both windows 7 x64bit. It works fine on the first one but does not work on the second one. strange. 
,oktan,2011-04-10T23:41Z,Works great ...Even on win7 x64...Thanks!
,miguelsz3,2011-04-13T20:13Z,So........It works and yet it doesnt work for 64-bit systems!?!?!?!?

,Captain,2011-07-31T20:09Z,"I don't know why it's not working on my Windows 7 32 bit.


Whenever I record any game video,the recorded video file gives me the sound but no video.

Also whenever I try to configure any ZD setting
(output directory, keyboard shortcuts etc.), it hangs & so impossible to do any thing.

Used task manager to stop zd working process.

Anyone please help!"
,miguelsz3,2011-07-31T21:22Z,...Try running it in compatibility mode. Other than that I havent a clue. It's been ages since they've updated the program so there might be a few issues here and there.
,gk4u,2011-10-20T13:52Z,Thanks.
,jacsonss,2011-12-19T17:41Z,"Works great on Win 7 64bit.
