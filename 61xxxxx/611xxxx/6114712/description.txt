That aside, the first few pages detail the extent of motive behind the author's writing the book.  It is to help you win games of Magic: the Gathering. The book, if taken to heart, helps you achieve this by teaching you mental "tricks" or mental "habits", for lack of a better term.  Good readings, and I hope this "top deck" was what you were hoping for. -- IvoryMask
