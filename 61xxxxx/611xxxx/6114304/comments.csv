,willyjinkens,2011-01-21T12:16Z,Thanks for all the great work HD-R-US. I was wondering if you were planning on doing the new bluray for Let Me In.

,Gemini_69,2011-01-22T05:03Z,Excellent Quality and great movie. Just got done watching it.
,Gman1646,2011-02-05T05:55Z,"Hash verified but both Alcohol 120% 2.0.1(latest) and PowerISO show it as unreadable (corrupted image).

Anyway I thought Bluray had to be at least 8Gb ISO and could be up to 25Gb.

They are 80% encryption crap filler, please rip to xvid and save us all 5 times the wasted bandwidth!"
