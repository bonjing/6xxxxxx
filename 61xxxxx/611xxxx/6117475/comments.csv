,olleberg20,2011-01-21T14:13Z,SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,g8aso,2011-01-21T14:29Z,File is way too small for the whole show unless it's in diabolical quality
[T],n2kmaster,2011-01-21T16:05Z,"it was a youtube rip, before complaining about size and question anyones motives here, its a webrip as said. Its upped strictly for those to impatient to wait for someone to get a higher quality version, g8aso no one is forcing you to download, and if complaining about a free download and the first one as well is the way you wish to go, let me know whats better than free k?"
,olleberg20,2011-01-21T16:05Z,why did you download it then fool
,g8aso,2011-01-21T16:49Z,Just a factual comment............what is the problem with truth?
,Scotsman90,2011-01-21T18:30Z,I'm actually surprised that it hasn't been uploaded yet. it usually gets released around 2 hours before it's even shown on tv
[T],n2kmaster,2011-01-21T18:49Z,"@olleberg, downloaded and reupped it asap cuz no one else put it up yet and a small fast download was what i was aiming at until these pickers are showing up seeding for 2 seconds and leaving 900+ people waiting, HELP SEED!

@g8aso, sigh, its not a fact, its a youtube rip as the description says, 360p resolution, go bug someone else or help seed. No reason why this couldn't be upload, poor res or whatever, no one else has ANYTHING, so i figured SOMETHING was better than NOTHING!"
,MLVtorrents,2011-01-21T18:52Z,"n2kmaster, you and your torrent SUCK............. k"
,MLVtorrents,2011-01-21T18:57Z,"n2kmaster provide us with something better or take this down. you are wasting everyones time K

YOU SUCK"
,Scotsman90,2011-01-21T19:31Z,"stop throwing abuse at him, he took the time to upload this for you since there wasn't another one around but I can comfirm that the RUDOS version is now up on the net"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-01-21T21:46Z,"thanks thats all i was waiting for, i appreciate your feedback Scotsman, MLVtorrent eat my butthole, take it down, who the hell are you MPAA come to bitch at me for ripping youtube LOL!"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-01-21T21:50Z,"and i mean if you can't read the description then you're at fault. I even gave you the heads up it was a simple yahoo rip, GET OVER YOUR OWN STUPIDITY! Like Scotsman said, at least i took the time to put SOMETHING out, funny thing is MLV you got jack s*** on here for torrents, so you're a file leech complaining that someone upped something. I laugh in your general direction, then fart in it, the give ya the high sign, there ya got you got 30 seconds of my time. If you want my friendship 10.95$/hr...."
