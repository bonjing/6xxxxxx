,kimmo1977,2011-01-20T12:04Z,"been on 99.9 % last 2 hours, what a f***"
,Undietaker,2011-01-20T13:07Z,thanks TVTeam I will spread my seeds to all
,breena51,2011-01-20T13:58Z,Quit your bitching ASSHOLE. If you don't like free movies then go to the theater.. 
,Raptorix,2011-01-20T15:06Z,"Its not the size of the file that bothers most people, it's the splitting in two 700Mb files. Nobody used CD's anymore. Anyone know what program i can use to join these 2 files?"
,murphylaw2006,2011-01-20T18:03Z,"use virtualdub to join files,1.open video file 1 under file tab,2.click append video file from file tab and select 2nd file,3.go into the audio and video tabs select direct stream copy in both,4.save avi as in file tab.
4 steps and its done in a matter of minutes,virtualdub is freeware from www.virtualdub.org,if this is too complex then i suggest u buy velcro shoes cause mamma aint gonna be around to tie ur laces forever mkay"

Decent movie too... 
Many Thanx to TvTeam and TWiZTED for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,moshster,2011-01-20T19:39Z,I agree.  The 2CD rule applied in the old days when hard drives and USB storage was more expensive.  This rule should be abolished by the Scene.

I cant get that vitualdub to work at all. Im sort of a noob to all this lol so bare with me :) everytime I put in a file in virtualdub (and ive tried many different formats) it says this to me MPEG Importer filter:Invalid pack at position 3: marker bit not set; possibly MPEG2 stream. What does that mean? Other then that thanks for telling us about it :) looks like it could be good..."
,sevilalucard,2011-01-20T20:18Z,Complete waste of time CD 1 = NO VIDEO STREAM FOUND! CD 2 FINE. So you can watch the end of the movie if you want
,sevilalucard,2011-01-20T20:22Z,"nm i guess that one was removed but i dont know, hope im not wasting my time downloading this one."
