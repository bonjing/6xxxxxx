Either way I appreciate your effort so will continue to seed for as long as I can, hopefully at least a day or two. From the few minutes I watched before realizing it wasn't in Eng. was excellent quality. "

The quality of the movie is excellent. The style of the animation appears a little crappy to me but the kids will absolutely love it.

When playing the movie using VLC player a non English language initially played. To change to English I selected:
Audio / Audio Track / Track 2

When I did this the sound volume dropped but it was in English."
