
This is Cities of the Underworld. In metropolises around the world today, skyscrapers loom overhead, traffic blares and vendors hawk their wares. But below hide city upon city, each with its fascinating and unknown history. With infectious enthusiasm and runaway curiosity, and aided by instructive computer animations and maps, host Don Wildman explores these layers often hundreds of feet down to transport you underground and back in time.
