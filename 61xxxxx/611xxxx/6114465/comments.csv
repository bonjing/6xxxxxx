,alfabetz,2011-01-27T07:37Z,"When downloading Photoshop CS5, it doesn't have an English option but everything is in English ... How do I make it so that the Photoshop part IS in English?!"

,nobduck,2011-02-22T18:47Z,"Hi to all.

Sorry. I'm new and don't know all the techniques.

Can you tell me how to compile different "".rar"" after downloading? Which software for Mac should I use?

Thank you for your answers.

Regards."
,iphonezapper,2011-04-12T22:28Z,"@nobduck The Unarchiver (http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html) is the best that I have found.

Go to the link above to see the list of supported file formats. Really great free program to get!"
,Maledictus,2011-04-19T17:56Z,Is there a way to get it in English?
,laurelwithhonor,2011-04-23T17:08Z,"if anyone is interested.. i found out how to make this english on a mac!

if you have a mac...

1) install it as directions are given

2) go to finder

3) type in ""tw10428.dat""
a file with that name should come up (if not, just try typing in "".dat"" and something with a similar name should come up

4) right click>get info on that file

5) change the name of the whole file to ""tw10428.bck""

6) save changes

7) reopen photoshop

it should work!"

peut on m'expliquer pourquoi ?

merci pour votre aide "

thank you for your help"
,jkwilborn,2011-06-15T05:51Z,"It would be very NICE if up loaders would put in the CPU that is required.  It gets very annoying to spend half a day and when you finally get it together, it runs on an Intel, not a PPC processor.  I know it's older, but if anyone complains, I will accept a new Mac (or used Intel Mac) from anyone if they think it's so easy to upgrade."

,petree28,2011-08-15T18:21Z,"To every on have problem unzipping the files:
the first one is the only one that you need to unzip. all the others will not work but it will still install

Anyone who doesnt have a window to draw on:
Go to file/new/set pixels for W=175 H=100
then open

To get your key:
Open PSMACES.part1.rar Folder/KEYGEN/Keymaker/keymaker and it will generate a product key that will work. but before you put the key in make sure that you have completed the Adobe keypass thing so that it wont recognize that you put in a wrong key code."

,Niosis,2011-09-16T17:27Z,"Well, due to the overall shoddy nature of this torrent I feel like I should make a flaming review regarding how terrible this torrent is. However, I will withhold my anger and stay productive.

Firstly, THERE IS NO ENGLISH LANGUAGE SETTING? WTF? Even if you do the instructions listed previously in the comments(which weren't even PUT in the original torrent as they should have been) The file folders are still going to be in whatever language you installed it in.

Secondly, THIS DOES NOT work on 10.6.8. I followed the instructions VERBATIM and my computer doesn't even show the .exe file when I use spotlight. After locating what I believed to be the .exe file, I tried to run it and it said parts of the file are missing (which is the same problem the above poster is having). Juuuuust great.

Avoid this torrent like the plague and go download another one. If you don't have Lion yet, chances are you'll have to deal with CS4 for the time being. I personally want to wait for Lion to get an update before I commit."
