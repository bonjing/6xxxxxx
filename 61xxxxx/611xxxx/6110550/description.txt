DESCRIPTION:

A seasoned pianist need so much more than a few ebony and ivory keys. Orchestras around the world use different tunings and have different acoustics. A concert grand piano can't be truly part of them without adapting. For the first time in the App Store, Virtuoso Piano Classic gives you the possibility to adjust the piano to match all your needs.

- Virtuoso Piano Classic is the first and only piano application in the App Store with "Master Tuning". Tune Virtuoso Piano Classic from 415.0 Hz all the way up to 466.2 Hz. Have it in harmony with every instrument and orchestra.

- Also, Virtuoso Piano Classic is the first and only piano application with "Adjustable Reverb". To have Virtuoso Piano Classic in the perfect acoustics, you can change the mix of the reverb.

- "Universal Nomenclature" gives you the chance to have the key labels the way you want. B or H? Doesn't matter. With Virtuoso Piano Classic you have them both.

NOTE: Virtuoso Piano Classic has been designed to be used with headphones or external speakers. Use one of them instead the built-in speakers!
