Jolicloud 1.1 - The Anywhere OS

Jolicloud is not a traditional OS. It was built for netbook users to leverage the Cloud and make their life easier.

Jolicloud is designed to work with as many different netbooks as possible. It is based on Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 - but don't worry about this older version number, Jolicloud has some of it's own repositories to provide more up to date packages to it's users.
