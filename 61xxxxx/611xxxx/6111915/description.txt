[ The 4th and Final Billy Rucker mystery ]

There is someone on the streets of London who will stop at nothing to make a point... As she walks home from work one night, Josephine Thomas is brutally attacked and left to bleed to death. Billy Rucker had known her, briefly, and he soon hears about the tragedy. At the request of Jo's distraught colleague, he agrees to look into the murder. As he begins his tentative enquiries, things move horrifically close to home. A friend of Billy's is found dead, and in the throes if what seems to be a crazy nightmare, Billy must bury his grief and tackle his most dangerous investigation yet. But something else is concerning Billy - are these murders horrible coincidences, or is Billy somehow the connection between them? And if this is the case, will he be the next target, or is the killer working to a far greater plan: a ceaseless vendetta that will send Billy's world spinning irrevocably out of control...
