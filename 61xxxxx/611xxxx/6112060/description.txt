INSTALL:

(1)  Decide which version of BitDefender 2011 you want to install.    
3 different versions are included, each in either x86 (32bit)      
or x64 (64bit) flavours.

(2)  You can choose any version you'd like, either "AntiVirus",          
"Internet Security", or "Total Security".  If you're unsure        
of which one to choose, just install "Internet Security".

(3)  Make sure you choose the right flavour (x86 or x64) for your  
system.  Don't worry, if you pick the wrong one Windows will    
tell you so.

(4)  Double click on the installer or your choice and follow the      
prompts.  If you are prompted to create or sign into a            
BitDefender account, just make a throw-away email address and  
use that.

(5)  Once the installation has finished restart your computer in    
"Safe Mode".  To start in "Safe Mode" press the F8 key when        
your computer starts to boot.  A menu will appear with several    
options.

(6)  When your Desktop has started in "Safe Mode", right click on    
"Box_BD2011.exe" and choose "Run as Administrator".                

(7)  Click on the button marked "Year 2047".  A dialogue will appear    
telling you that the operation was successful.                      

(8)  Restart your PC again (in normal mode) and it should be done.  

(9)  Make sure you update BitDefender and run a virus scan.    

note
Some antivirus programs may claim that the keygen included    
is a virus or trojan.  This is just a false positive, I've        
scanned the file thoroughly and I have used it on my own PC.  

If you're still worried that this file may be infected and        
you don't want to take the risk, then I suggest you download  
a free antivirus product or purchase BitDefender.
