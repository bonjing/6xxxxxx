,Crazyhunter,2011-04-17T13:26Z,I tried 32 bits works for windows 7.But could not not run the crack it was deleted before i could run by the bit defender.tnks any ways i used a key from another torrent and it did work.
,alostm,2011-06-03T16:56Z,"Heads up, everything works as the uploader said, great job kill3rk, i got over 12,000 days but after updating i suddenly couldnt connect to the internet . i tweaked it around to see if i was missing a setting but nothing not even when i disabled bitdefender firewall. i switced back to safe mode and uninstall the patch but still the same (i could acess the internet in safe mode)
so i googled it. Apparently this happens to some users, i'm just happy i'm not demanding for a refund right now. ps: i used bitdefender 2009 for 20 months and it was fantastic"
