According to the story below it would be the one from kubrick since that's the one with Jack nicholson. The picture of yhe dvd cover however is from the stephen king version . I'll tell you which one it is after I've downloaded."
,cyril19,2011-04-17T16:00Z,It's indeed the one from 1980 with jack nichelson not the redone version from stephen king
