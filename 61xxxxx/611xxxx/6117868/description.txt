RDimH presents - The History of Now: The Story of the Noughties

Preamble: This is a reupload of a torrent found lurking onI feel this Torrent needs to be shared as much as possible, simply because it is invaluable to our generation, and future generations.

A 3 part documentary looking back at the last decade (2000 to 2010) seeing where we went wrong, where we went right and what the hell just happened in Britain and around the world. A very interesting insight, especially for any Historians. Presented in a balanced way, this documentary will bring back nostalgic feelings, the love of hindsight and leave you wondering where we will go in the next 10 years.

A must-see.
