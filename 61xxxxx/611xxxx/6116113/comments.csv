,zippyderppyguy,2011-01-24T01:14Z,"To unlock all zombie maps on Black Ops, simply break out of your chair (back buttons on controller) and head to the small computer again. Instead of inputting DOA, type in the following sequence â3ARC UNLOCKâ (with a space in between). If you have done it correctly, you should see a message saying the cheat has been activated pop up on screen.

Why the hell would anyone need a code generator?? Just need Google to unlock all the zombie maps.. sheesse "
,Charbis,2011-01-24T10:53Z,"To get the real extra zombie maps for free, please look for ""TheCoDReportClassic Zombiemaps"", the file should come with an account called BlackOps Taco. Thats all you need to unlock Nacht Der  Untoten, Shi no Numa, Verruckt and Der Reise. Please don't download this =)."
