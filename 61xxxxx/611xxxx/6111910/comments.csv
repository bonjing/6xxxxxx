I see two other seeds besides me on this and the torrent is not even two hours old. Maybe some people helping out, or maybe people spreading bad blocks?

Any comments appreciated."

To kind of answer your question, I know that some bittorrent clients, outside of utorrent and azureus, can send out false statistics. It may show someone as a seed even if they only completed 1 file.  It could just be someone helping out though like you said."

But I did notice one video in Lana Lopez's set #195 missing. Namely 195_04_peerpressure1920x1080.wmv
I've been searching all over the place for this one, but to no avail. If you or anyone else happen to have this one, it'd make my day!"
