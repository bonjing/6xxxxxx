Piers Morgan Tonight 2011 01 20: Ricky Gervais

Ricky Gervais is the guest on the CNN interview show hosted by former "Daily Mirror" editor (and current "America's Got Talent" judge) Piers Morgan. Much of the interview is a discussion of Ricky Gervais' hosting of The Golden Globes.

The filesize is a bit bigger than the standard 350MB because some extra material is included at the end from Anderson Cooper 360. In that footage, Anderson Cooper has a short discussion with Piers Morgan and Joan Rivers about Ricky Gervais' performance at The Golden Globes.
