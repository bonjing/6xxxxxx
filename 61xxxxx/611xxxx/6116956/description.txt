Plantation Lullabies is an album that can sneak up behind you (or jump right out in front of you) and surprise you time and time again.  Me'shell sings with such a rare combination of matter-of-fact confidence and soulful restraint that_Plantation Lullabies_ should sound great for years and years.  If "Dread Loc" doesn't melt your knees, then nothing will.
