,keitherton,2011-01-19T01:36Z,"Oh blah, all you fucks...

I think it's safe to say that, in the UK vs US content war, we copy each other.  There's a ton of shows that we Americans watch that was brought over from the UK, and that's rad!  But be honest, Brits, you have plenty of shows/films that are derived from American stuff too.  We both have an eye for quality, and arguing about who has the best is honestly a smidge ridiculous..."
,JackOfficer,2011-01-19T18:49Z,"the US show sucks, mtv = garbage
fuck 720p...1080p or xvid or go home fag
(xvid =  able to play on most devices,
1080p = superior, 720p = who gives a shit)

piratebay pop-unders are fucking bullshit :)"

,horgin34,2011-03-17T09:04Z,"@keitherton

If you actually look it up, the US has done way more copying of television shows (some successful, some not)

True both countries can produce quality TV shows but when the US does so the BBC (or one of other broadcast companies) will acuire the rights to regularly air it. That basically never happens in the States. Also we have a lot more available channels, so there's a lot more room for not so great shows."
