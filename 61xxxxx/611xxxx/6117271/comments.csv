[H],HeroMaster,2011-01-21T14:18Z,"Here you go extreme read it well:

Notes This was a bad nightmare. There is majour issues with the audio out there for this. Took a massive line sync job to get this right. This was due to the fact that imagine had spliced the audio together using several different pieces. Because of this the sync is slighty loose from 11mns in to aprox 25mns in but it def isnt bad nuff to ruin your enjoyment of this movie. I ask you to be forgiving of this and to concider that due to the state of the source audio, it was impossible to get this 100%. Untill better line audio or studio audio becomes available, this is the best yer gona get. Take it or leave it."
