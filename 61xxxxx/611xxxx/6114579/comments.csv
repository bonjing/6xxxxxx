,Dobik2000,2011-01-20T11:43Z,"Hey, people, if you check the files included, yes there are a couple of things left from the disco boys, but that's only like 4kB. The rest is mostly an avi file called fico-llshits. So even though the description is off, I'm guessing it's still good. I'll keep you posted once I'm done downloading..."
,Dobik2000,2011-01-31T17:21Z,"Huh, sorry, I forgot to keep you posted... Anyhow, don't worry about the whole ""the disco boys"" thing, the movie's there. The quality is fine (a/v 9/9), but I have to admit the movie rather sucks (in my opinion)..."
