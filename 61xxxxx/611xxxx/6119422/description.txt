Tagline
Despite being no saint herself, Julia Cody has shielded her seventeen year old son, Joshua "J"
Cody, from her Melbourne-based criminal relatives who they have not seen in years. After
Julia dies in front of J's eyes from a self-inflicted heroin overdose, J, who is slightly detached
from life, feels he has no choice but to contact his maternal grandmother, Janine "Smurf"
Cody, the family matriarch, for a place to live. Smurf rules the family with a borderline
incestuous love over her three sons, the quietly menacing Andrew "Pope" Cody, the
hyperactive Craig Cody, and the barely of age Darren Cody. Pope and his best friend, Barry
"Baz" Brown, are armed robbers, with Darren their up and coming apprentice, while Craig is a
mid level drug dealer. Melbourne's Armed Robbery Squad is after specifically Pope, who is
hiding out. But when the standoff between the Codys and the Armed Robbery Squad is
brought up a notch...
