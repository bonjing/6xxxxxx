,Masterfrog,2011-01-18T16:27Z,"Why aren't these newer series released in 720p? I can't even watch anything less any more, it's like stabbing my eyes out with a rusty spoon."
,Jankavkee,2011-01-18T17:53Z,"Since US shows are not shown abroad, for the most part, most countries lack the download speed of the West. I live in India and up until 6 mos. ago my download max speed was 32 kbps...now it's up to a whopping 60 kbps which means it normally takes more than 2 hours to download a 350 MB file. So if only 720p at more than 1 GB size per file was all that was available it would eliminate the possibility of any ""timely"" downloading for those of us stuck in ""slow"" countries. "
,bert745,2011-01-18T20:41Z,"Hey, masterfrog, ever thought that this site was not just for you?
Ever thought that the original programme may not have been aired in HD?
Ever thought about anyone but yourself?"
,Jeroenert,2011-01-19T02:51Z,This show IS available in 720p smartass! Just search for it. It's from dimension. 
,silveroakleaf,2011-01-19T03:39Z,Something tells me Masterfrog has never seen a rusty spoon in his life...just silver ones!
,Masterfrog,2011-01-19T15:06Z,"Jankavkee: Yeah I know some countries are privileged with great broadband, but what you're proposing isn't really a problem because 720p being available is never at the expense of the lesser quality option.

bert745: Pretty much all shows air in HD. Sometimes some cartoons don't because it's completely moot for them, but that isn't the case here. Stop talking out of your ass.

Jeroenert: Wasn't when I searched. And other series like House, How I Met Your Mother and Lie to Me arrive pretty much instantaneously in 720p. Many of the newer series have been very slow with the 720p release, when it's been released at all, so I'm just curious why that is."

i dont know why the good folks at eztv dont upload many of their newer shows in 720. it'd be nice if they did, but because more people tend to dl the lower quality torrents, the demand for the 720 just isnt big enough to justify providing it on a regular basis."
,kbekman,2011-02-08T08:02Z,"...lower quality torrents, *MAYBE* the demand for the 720 just isnt big enough to justify providing it on a regular basis."
