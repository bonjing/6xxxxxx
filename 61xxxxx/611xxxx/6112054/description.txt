If you like boogie rock like Status Quo or early Kiss then this is something for you. 
This is the unsigned rock band from Sweden, that you now can hear on german webradio www.sqrr.de  or on the english webradio www.realhitradio.co.uk.

This cd has been made CD Of the month. On www.sqrr.de (Status Quo Rock Radio)

So hurry up and get your own copy of this superb rock cd. And here you also can get the videos for some of the songs.
Play it loud and boogie on through the night.

Cheers from Sweden
