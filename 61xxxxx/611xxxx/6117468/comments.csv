[T],trialNerror,2011-01-22T12:39Z,I'm not picking up GHI.  CRiMSON can do it.  It just takes a little while for it to be allowed on public trackers and was getting tired of waiting after a whole day so I ripped my own.  My one and only for GHI.  Crappy thing is CRiMSON's was released like half hour after I posted mine.  Lame.
