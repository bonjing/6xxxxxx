I will be uploading what I have of SuperSexyHeroines.com shortly, but I am not paying anymore money to the silly little empire of Jon, the owner. He doesn't give a crap about what his users want, obsesses over stupid comic strips, and makes promises he can't keep due to his sites being second to his full time job. The picture quality has diminished because he still lives in a dial up webmaster world, which altogether isn't worth even paying ĂÂŁ12 a month for. If you want emails and comments ignored and deleted by him, go post on his blog. That's how downright rude he is."
