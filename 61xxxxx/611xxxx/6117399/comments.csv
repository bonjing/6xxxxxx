"
,subotai68,2011-01-21T18:36Z,"@ avilatech -- Maybe if you'd spent more time getting a real education and reading books that had INFORMATION in them, you would know how to write right.  Right?  Evolve, you throwback.  Embrace reason."
,DaBigSky,2011-01-23T19:48Z,"No the WTBS was to make a profit pure and simple.  Tracking has nothing to do with it. 

If the information was the TRUTH nothing could stop it from being distributed.  What does the scriptures say ""What you recieve freely... give freely.""  ""The very rocks themselves would cry-out if no one preached""

The literature the WT promotes is not free you pay for that. Sometime the recipient pays for it as well as the publisher so it is paid for twice.  If God was really concerned to get this message out he would have made it free.  As supported by the scriptures.

The right way of distribution according to the WTBS is to make profit.

Some may argue that this is privy information only for the DUB's but, anything in secrete and hidden from the light; can't be good.  Wake up!!!

The truth can defend itself, so why keep it hidden. The Holy Spirit can help anyone understand God's will.  You don't need brainwashing teachings to understand God's will.

The Watchtower Society is a Non-prophet organization.  Thanks to Elcosta for uploading this so many can determine for themselves without the brainwash brow beating of a Bible study with a DUB what is the TRUTH."
,DaBigSky,2011-01-23T20:23Z,"Here is some food for thought.  In 2000 the were only 8,755 of the (anointed-memorial partakers) and in 2010 there were 10,857 partakers.  

According to WT pronouncements the anointed class was closed in 1935.  Those older enough to be baptize in 1935 would be well in to their 70's or much older. For years this number has gotten smaller due to these people dying off. Now the number is increasing to the sum of 2102 in ten years.  ????????  The are only 144,000 that are suppose to be of this class according to WT teachings.  

Even if some faithful person were removed from this class the numbers would remain the same or be less; not increasing.  Where is the TRUTH in this????

Thanks again Elcosta for the upload.  "
,EdwardTeach,2011-02-15T22:09Z,"Gods messengers? They are counterfeits of the real thing, dishonest practitioners masquerading as the messengers of Christ. Nor do their tactics surprise me when I consider how Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is only to be expected that his agents shall have the appearance of ministers of righteousness, but they will get what they deserve in the end. 2 Cor 11:13-15 "
,yoshimira,2011-02-18T08:43Z,"I was told, actually, that this material is provided to any who ask for it.
I am not in a position where I can go to the ""Kingdom Hall"" and order a copy and wait how many weeks until it arrives.
However, it is a great research tool that they have made available free of charge and by their own words available to whosoever wants it.
So I'll seed it till my face turns blue."
,LeGra,2011-03-01T03:31Z,"In the spirit of the 70's, ""Right On...yoshimira !   I'm married to a Witness.  And ALL publications are FREE.  They only ask for donations.  And last I heard, donations mean whatever you can afford to give.  For many in this terrible economy, that makes means FREE!"
,LeGra,2011-03-01T03:34Z, I agree EdwardTeach.   You couldn't said it better.
,tyrale,2011-03-07T13:00Z,"According to the WL:


YOUR USE OF WATCHTOWER LIBRARY

1. What constitutes proper use? Watchtower Library has been designed for your personal use. Hence, you may copy, print, or excerpt from the data for your personal use. But you may not distribute the program or large sections of the data to others who do not own Watchtower Library on CD-ROM. Do not sell Watchtower Library or put the program or data on the Internet or any electronic network.

2. Who may have a copy of Watchtower Library? Watchtower Library is a research tool for Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses, not for the public or for institutions such as schools or libraries.

3. May I copy the program and data onto the hard disk of my computer and then not use the CD-ROM? Yes, you may do that. Less disk space is involved when you access the data directly from the CD-ROM; however, the speed of some operations is significantly improved if the data is stored on the hard disk. 

4. If I personally own several computers or PDAs, may I copy Watchtower Library and/or its data onto these? Yes.

5. May I make a duplicate of my CD-ROM as a backup in case I lose or damage my original? Yes, but this does not refer to duplicating the CD-ROM for others, which would fall outside the realm of personal use.

6. May I write commercial software or utilities that employ the program or data from Watchtower Library? No. It is not proper to charge for or to receive money from writing or distributing any software that employs the Watchtower Library program, utilities, or data.


Obviously, the uploader made an error by uploading the software..."
,lnarvaez,2011-04-23T01:06Z,"thank you so much elcosta!!! I downloaded this one and the spanish one too. Me and my mom love you.!!!

Don't listen to all those haters out there. We have netbooks so cd's are totally useless to us and we don't have the money to buy an external cd/dvd drive.

People talk without thinking, that goes for JW's too. 

What are we suppose to do? Go without the library? Even though we have netbooks? 

Besides, there are millions of brothers and sisters in 3rd world countries who use pirated software because they can't shell out 100 bucks to buy window 7 or microsoft office. 

They will continue to use them until the day they die because that's just how it is. No one is or can be completely sinless. 

I bet a lot of those people who tell you to to not upload because it violates the law, are from highly developed countries who have no need of this. 

All the poor brothers and sisters out there with netbooks thank you. : D"
,JOKERTIJ,2011-05-04T17:27Z,GREAT WORK  Elcosta YOU ARE REACHING THOSE OF US THAT SPEND TO MUCH TIME IN COMPUTERS NOT ENOUGH IN PUBLIC THANK YOU FOR PROVIDEING THIS INFO FOR US WHO ARE OPEN MINDED AND ARE WILLING TO LOOK AT ALL OUR OPCION THAT ARE OUT THERE. THANKS AGAIN.
,LeGra,2011-06-02T23:39Z,"Question!   Why are their Jehovah's Witnesses in The Pirate bay?   Isn't just BEING, in The Pirate Bay, considered to be WRONG?  Just askin........"
,Dmg83,2011-06-12T07:31Z,"@LeGra

  It's only trading copyrighted materiel that is Illegal.

To other comments here: Matthew 12:24-26 At hearing this, the Pharisees said: “This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Be‧el′ze‧bub, the ruler of the demons.” 25 Knowing their thoughts, he (Jesus) said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. 

 So if Jehovah's Witness are doing the work of the Devil how will his Kingdom stand?"
,acondor,2011-07-27T00:22Z,People on the internet don't like Witnesses? How deliciously original.
,OriginalTopCAt,2011-12-16T01:13Z,"Thanks for the torrent, edwardteach, learn to love your enemies. Much to learn young jedi."
,142856,2012-01-16T10:44Z,"Torrent is good: AAA

Plus I donâ€™t believe in copyright laws when it comes to immaterial things, things we cannot posses anyway by nature like thoughts or ideas or digits. If a person has a thought for example and want to keep the thought for himself, He better not to tell anybody. The moment he gives something to the public automatically he accepts the law of the public, and that is our law. My disobedience to accept copyright laws, comes from ancient Israel where people was ordered not make profit by giving to their brothers. Also my God (I donâ€™t know about yours!) has always been open to me keeping no secrets from me. In ancient Israel he was gathering old and young, men and women, even children to listen to his Word. How anyone can keep me away from the beloved Word of my father? Only if it is his word and not of my fatherâ€™s Word!"
