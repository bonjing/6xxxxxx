,froglog,2011-01-19T16:14Z,"Thank you for African Queen.
Im still having very slow download speed from some of your uploads, with peerblock allowing you or even not on at all. Tv.show.pack.2nd.week.jan. Started to downloading last night & still only 64.8% i guess this is because of no seeders, o well not your fault.
Looks like i need to get in earlier.
African Queen is coming fast @ 300 kB/s + .
Thanks again for all your hard work & help."

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-19T21:22Z,"@froglog: I am sorry, you are definitely late, Weekly.Pack is seeded by me and very rarely, by someone else aside... and - most important - Weekly.Pack is assembled ONLY for downloaders who missed some show during the week, and the pack shouldn't be taken as whole - especially after there stated TimeToLive - 24h. In that 24h I seeded over 150 GB of that torrent alone - and I even can't allow myself to get on bottom of that."
