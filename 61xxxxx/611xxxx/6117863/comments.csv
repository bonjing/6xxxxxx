,supagusti,2011-01-21T21:10Z,I don't think that this one is MULTI5 - can anyone confirm pls?
,Chr1ll337,2011-01-21T21:18Z,Can someone confirm that Disk 2 is only needed for Multiplayer! Thanks!
,ckcc,2011-01-22T09:35Z,"Due to some contradicting facts from different websites, I hope that someone who is playing this game(hopefully finished the game) will give us a definite and correct answer for these questions.
1.Confirmed NO AP2.5 and Wave 6?
2. Do we need LT+ to play it?
3. Disc 2 is undoubtedly just for Multiplayer and we don't need it to finish the campaign?

Thanks. =) "
,supagusti,2011-01-22T10:11Z,"AP2.5 = NO : confirmed
DISK2 = part of the single player campaign (higher levels)
LT+ not needed to play the game, but a ban might be possible"

,yesder,2011-01-25T17:21Z,"Has anyone actually burned this game and played it? I've wasted four verbatim discs, and only one of them get me to the loading screen. All of them either says ""disc unreadable"". I've burned some 30+ games, got LT+ og using Img Burn with the correct layerbreak and all. 
What am I doing wrong?"

,Gierard,2011-01-31T20:12Z,"I'm at 99% please seed.

It should be a rule in torrents to keep uploading for 1 week after the download have finished

I do that with every single game I download, after that week I delete the download."

,Fenura,2011-02-20T11:58Z,"You must have a flashed xbox to play burned games and no you cannot play it from an usb stick 
however you can flash the xbox on your own but i do not recommend it if your not familiar with the area."
,rialin,2011-02-25T18:09Z,"Lmao@dzilla91

Seems a bit misplaced to complain when downloading a ""stolen"" game. Just be glad this opportunity exists, no matter leecher or seeder numbers. If u want it really fast, buy it"
