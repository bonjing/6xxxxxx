,941640278,2011-01-21T17:15Z,"I have been following Mike for several years now.  He used to be really big here at PB with like 3,000+ torrents, but one of the Moderators went nuts over all the gay porn and deleted his account.  He was MikeXXXRyan then.  Also a lot of straight assholes were targeting Mike's torrent with homophobic comments.  

Mike has put up four of his personal videos but doesn't leave them up too long.  He's really a hot looking guy but I can't get him to give me the time of day.  My favorite video of his is one where he pays this totally hetero married handsome hunky stud to fuck him doggy style.  I must watch that one at least once a week or whenever I want to really get off.

From other messages Mike has posted he has said he is now legally married to a guy and they live and work in San Francisco.  Mike runs two websites, both gay adult material, and he used to run a gay dating site but sold that site after meeting Greg, his now husband.  I had joined the dating site and remember reading their public posts.  Mike wanted to get married and have a couple of kids.  Greg had put up a video of himself and his dog, Skipper, that was really cute and not long after that Mike and Greg were dating.

Mike is six feet tall with dark brown hair that is short now (I think - can't be sure) but he used to wear it long, to his shoulders.  Greg is six one, 32, and two years older then Mike and runs a non-profit organization for children (diabetes? Leukemia?).  They are both health nuts, ride bikes, surf, Greg used to play pro tennis, Mike is a big swimmer.

Too much info? I'm I obsessed with the guy?  Probably but I'm happy for him (and Greg, the lucky dog)!

He puts up THE BEST porn!  Thanks Mikey!"
