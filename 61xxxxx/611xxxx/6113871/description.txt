Shanghai Noon

Hilarious comedy who make people piss there pants regularly!
Starring Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan.

Like the cast aint a perfect key to succes, The movie is also funny from second 1 until the end.

The princess of china has been kidnapped. Its all up to Chong Wang (Jackie Chan) to get her back. While hes on his search he runs upto Roy Obannon. This cowboy will help Chong with the search. These are all ingredients needed for an evening full of laugh!

Enjoy!!
