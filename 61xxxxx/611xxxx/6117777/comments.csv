,Originalrider,2011-02-15T00:13Z,@ use11. im having the same problem and i havent touched this torrent. im running win7 home 64 bit... did you try playing before using this update?
,fima_007,2011-02-23T22:50Z,"BIG sorry for all if i'm lost for some time
about compatebility: runs perfect on winXP 32bit(x86) and needs to set compat. options on vista/W7 as, run as admin and(optional, if game crashes) comp. mode WinXP SP3.
for me(W7x64RUS_C2DE2140@2.3Ghz_ENGTS250 1GB(G92)_P5Q SE2) it runs perfect, except fatal error after LAST maitenace window(game login normal, but crashes on ""enter the world"")

2 8emakos: 
""start download the game and abort it after ~1-5%
"" i mean dowload portion from official server, stop and shutdown client Add missing files(from torrent) of game, then resync with server. easy ;)

for some rare cases you need download youself theese files because, game needs to detect OS and hardware. Check your drivers and OS for junk(system must not be ""half dead"":).Reinstall is optional

TODO: As soon as server stop thow me from game, I'm create another torrent with LATEST cheanges and fixes

bottmline: it seems the problem on the server side only(because only kernel fails, 3D are good) we get the hotfix on this in no time

ALL what i'm said is writed on 2:50AM(GMT+5)"
