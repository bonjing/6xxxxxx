,scottsasse,2011-03-01T01:46Z,"What in the FUCK is it with you Aimee fans downloading this torrent & NOT seeding it back???? If you hit & run KARMA will ass-fuck you!!! I have seeded out so far to a 28:281 ratio!! If I stop seeding this torrent you can send a seed request with a sincere PROMISE to seed back to DrWynnScott@gmail.com .I'm really not a dick but out of all my torrents this one really pisses me off. Realize I did NOT have to share this bootleg and recognize that someone else may want to seed off you what I seeded to you. Enough said!!!! Love, DrScott"
,maxpower100,2011-03-05T03:43Z,"I would be willing to seed this, but I don't know if I can connect to it to download it. Utorrent shows 1 in swarm (from tracker.publicbt.com) but it's not connecting. Tracker.thepiratebay.org shows: 'No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it'."

I was looking for something else and only found this torrent by accident. I'm glad I did. :)

,scottsasse,2011-03-05T20:01Z,"THANKS ""maxpower100""!! When I woke up today and finally saw 2 seeders it made me glad once more that I shared this one of a kind concert with the world. And THANKS for taking the time to comment and typing the track-list (which I was too busy to do).That's what torrents are all about, helping out your fellow man/woman.The force is strong with you ""maxpower100""!! You're one of the few in the world who actually should be having children:):), Love and Respect, DrScott"

,Swiftbow,2012-05-07T00:06Z,"Many thanks to OP for this torrent and for responding to my reseed request!

I will be seeding this torrent for at least four weeks beginning today, any requests to reseed after that, if OP can't respond you may request at whome5555@yahoo.com.

Include instructions on how to reseed a torrent you didn't originally post, I always seed after dl-ing but have never initiated a torrent.

Thanks again, OP!  "
