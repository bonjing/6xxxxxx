I just came across a high quality bootleg from a show I attended in 2003. Aimee played a 19 song set (at least 90 minutes). The last track is a pre-show radio interview in which she performs 2 live additional tracks. Most of the credit goes to my good friend Rebecka for smuggling in the high quality DAT recorder. I ripped this from the master source and the quality is very good for a bootleg. The bitrate is around 185kbps. (Most of my uploads are in lossless FLAC) But that would have been a huge file and my up speed is location limited right now at around 42kbps per torrent. That said, If you REALLY want a perfect FLAC copy of a track or two, I will be happy to re-rip and post as a separate torrent. Just leave a comment here or e-mail me at drwynnscott@gmail.com . (You can also send re-seed requests if this torrent is no longer seeding). Anyhoo  .....please do the right thing and SEED back at least what you get!! ENJOY and support the artists!! Love, DrScott
