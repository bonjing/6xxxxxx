After 40 years at EMI, Queen called it quits and moved to Island Records.

With that came news that all of Queen\'s albums would be remastered with bonus tracks throughout the year starting in March.

In the meantime, they\'ve released this newly remastered version of Greatest Hits II, still one of the top ten best selling albums of all time in the United Kingdom.

Tracklist is the same as the standard UK CD version. Audio files only.
