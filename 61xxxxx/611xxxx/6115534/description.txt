BDK NOTES
Well here i go with my version of the Green Hornet. i know there is several out there already but everyone has got their taste.thanks to SERENITY for such a nice cam.on to the work. this one was very heavy on the red a little dark and a little noisy. adjusted the red in it cause people dont need to look red also the hue and saturation along with brightness and black levels denoised and sharpened. hope you all enjoy. BDK
