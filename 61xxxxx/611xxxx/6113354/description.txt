A confused and muddled day in the life of one time Variety Star, Count Arthur Strong. 
An expert in everything from the world of entertainment to the origins of species, Arthur is all Tourettic tics, false starts and nervous fumbling, badly covered up by a delicate sheen of bravado and self-assurance. Everyday life with Count Arthur Strong is an enlightening and entertaining experience.


Cast:
Steve Delaney
Sue Perkins
Dave Mounfield
Alastair Kerr.


[color= blue][b]S00 are early Counts from The Mark Radcliffe Show.
These are before Count Arthur got his own show
The titles used for S00 were made up by me to keep them in some kind of running order.
Most run at about 25 minutes so are almost like a real Count show.[/b][/color] 

Thanks to the original poster of the un-edited S00 in this torrent.
