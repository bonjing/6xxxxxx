,PsychoLogic,2011-01-23T01:26Z,"A few reasons, standalone DVD players don't support AAC, neither does the XboX (I believe 360 does, not the original).  My audio receiver also can't stream AAC directly like it can with AC3 or DTS.  And the last mp4 rips I downloaded drifted out of sync by >200ms towards the end, dunno if it was just a crappy rip, the mp4 bucket, or vlc/smplayer's fault, but it was annoying."
