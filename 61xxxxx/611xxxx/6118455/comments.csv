,herl0ck,2011-06-05T21:40Z,"I'm afraid the last 7 or so minutes of the credits are missing :(
otherwise good work as always -- excellent quality/file size ratio"
,Morrissy,2011-08-09T06:48Z,"Whats with the english subtitles hardcoded in, it's an english speaking film. Next make a seperate SRT. file so people can choose if they want subtitles or not."
,argot2004,2011-09-04T00:18Z,"This movie has hard subs in English.  At first this is a bit annoying, but the sound quality is a bit imbalanced (the background is too high and the dialogue is drowned out by it) and so the subs actually do come in handy.

This movie is excellent.  At first it doesn't make any sense, but as you continue watching, the plotline develops and it becomes engrosing.  From what I've read, the movie bombed; my guess is it didn't pass the 'Saturday at the mall' test.

V: 10
A: (because of the imbalance) 4
M: 8.5

Thanks to the uploader"
,royce44,2011-09-22T00:43Z,The audio is out of sync but it has subtitles hard coded in. It's watchable but obviously not ideal without proper audio.
