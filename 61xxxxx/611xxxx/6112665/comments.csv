,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-01-19T11:00Z,"OOO, i have just got Handbreak program installed on my computer (windows vista) 
i click on the ""iphone & ipod touch"" preset, i then uncheck the box ""Keep aspect ratio"" 
then select (width - 480) (Height - 272) i keep the Cropping set to Automatic. 
On the ""video"" tab, i keep Framerate (FPS) at ""same as source"" 
on the Quality section i change the (constant quality) to Avg Bitrate (kbps): 400 
i then tick the boxes for 2-pass encoding & Turbo first pass.

whats your verdict? have i done this right? or would you change anything??
Thanks for your help"
[T],qwersd,2011-01-19T12:41Z,thanxxx... u really rock...
[T],on.off.on,2011-01-19T22:29Z,@yohohoandaBottleofRUM yeah just dont do a turbo pass on first pass. 
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-20T16:48Z,why no turbo pass?  Not that I know what that does or anything.  However I essentially do a turbo pass or fast pass in my encodes.  There are some parameters that can be lessened on the first analysis and it will run significantly faster on first round.
[T],on.off.on,2011-01-20T18:08Z,it looks bad if u dont do a normal pass in handbrake.. dont ask me why but it does
