i'm tired about repeating the same thing over & over again about false positives detected by your crappy av. time to get a new av mate."
,imunionjack,2011-02-08T00:16Z,"I used a copy of this from the day it was released But I too had 1 alarm when I first uploaded it to here to share and it wasnt a false positive. I never did get the alarm again but I still removed it as I didnt want tp spread it no matter how small a chance.
Theres several CS5 Portables onhere now and all very similar. Is this EXTENDED FOR SURE?
Doesnt really need the plug ins added as peeps can get them if needed.
I would have tho given some install details on the info page instead of copy/pasting your normal torrent info. It makes it more personal to the share.
Ill try it out b4 I pass it to my members. Ta muchly"

Uh... False Positive? What a load of BS!

,Stealth64,2011-02-11T22:10Z,"Uh... False Positive? What a load of BS!

Using PEid I unpacked it and found I nice little backdoor (which my AV caught and destroyed) called ""BDS/Poison.bhtb"" (Back door server).

It uses a ""Runtime Packer"" to avoid detection, don't trust the file if it says it's clean, it unpacks the payload after.

""In order to aggravate detection and reduce size of the file it is packed with a runtime packer.""

,skinny_gorilla,2011-02-12T03:05Z,"VERY NICE!

Now I can do some additional work wherever I want having it on my USB. 

Works without installation. No serial required. Plug and play baby.

Thanks..."
,DragonF.C.Porto,2011-02-18T00:10Z,"Thanks..obrigada, good work"
,shadman04,2011-02-25T13:01Z,"Kentucky Kid, your trojans are pretty neat.  The other part about telling people that it's a false positive is also a good approach.  But I've looked at the code, your installing trojans on top of pirated software.  No good."
,peewee-hermen,2011-03-02T23:35Z,"all of you people who are saying KK is a virus spreader.. shut the fuck up your getting things for free and he is risking his ass just so you fags can have fun with the pirated things.....if you dont like it then go out and buy the real fucking thing, otherwise keep your faggot mouth shut and enjoy free programs at someone elses expenses as for the so called viruses, i have been downloading his apps for a while now and my computer is running as fast as the day i bought it ...which is fast...."
,SaltSlasher,2011-03-19T19:48Z,"Hey thanks for the cool PS CS5, but mainly for the plug-ins(I didn't have a fraction of the these)

But I am having the same problem as before. Every time I open a Topaz Plug-In, my mouse freezes so that I can't do anything!! I have to ctr/alt/delete and log off, just to get things working again!

Does anyone know how to fix this, I have spent hours tring everything imaginable!

I will seed for sho!"
