[T],_Slimoo_,2011-01-21T16:48Z,"I use a standard text file on my torrents.

eg.
First 2 lines say what it is
Bottom is file info.
I just change the description and a few other bits.

Problem is TPB have disabled the EDIT so I could not change it.

If I deleted it to repost I get other issues.
Part of the torrent needs to be changed, as you can't re-upload as it is

This is not an option as it's also posted on other trackers and Twitter

It would mean seeding 2 torrents

Thanks for sharing. I love these sort of things."
