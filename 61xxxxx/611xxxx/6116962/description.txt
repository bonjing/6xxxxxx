Review by David Jeffries

There are times during Good Day to Cross a River when the audience is laughing so hard you know they're wiping tears out of their eyes. Standup comedian Greg Giraldo gets them to this point because of his unique pacing. He's a sleazy, disgruntled guy on burst mode, hammering his audience relentlessly with cynical, outrageous, and extremely funny observations. Great thing about Giraldo is that despite his fast pace and all the disgust and ire, he doesn't reach the temper tantrum/nervous breakdown point like Lewis Black, making an hour with the guy a pleasure. Course, Black probably wouldn't touch anything as distasteful as "The Floater," a reality show featuring paraplegics battling it out in a lake. He can be as gross as you'd expect a Howard Stern favorite to be, but his gross is more like National Lampoon's gross was in the '70s with biting wit and toilet humor riding side by side. "Terrorism" is a layered routine that suggests he's well aware of Lenny Bruce, while "Sexual Saturation" goes in a primal direction and foams at the mouth while obsessing on naked mannequins. His versatile style brings into question why his appearances on Comedy Central's series of celebrity roasts brought him to fame. As funny as they are, they seemed canned and merely amusing when compared to this excellent performance.

Biography by David Jeffries

Known for his intense delivery and intense material, standup comedian Greg Giraldo (December 10, 1965 â€“ September 29, 2010) became famous thanks to his regular appearances on The Howard Stern Show, The Late Show with David Letterman, and the Comedy Central television network's series of celebrity roasts. Before he roasted folks like Chevy Chase, Pam Anderson, and William Shatner, Giraldo was a regular panelist on Comedy Central's Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. Besides developing and starring in his own sitcom -- Common Law, which lasted one season in 1996 -- and his numerous talk show appearances, Giraldo has been featured in two Comedy Central Presents specials -- one in 2000, the other in 2004. Also in 2004, he appeared on Lazyboy's "Underwear Goes Inside the Pants," an international hit that topped iTunes' electronica charts. In 2006 he released his debut album, Good Day to Cross a River, on Comedy Central's record label. Midlife Vices followed in 2009.


Death

On September 25, 2010, Giraldo overdosed on prescription medication. After he failed to appear for a scheduled performance at the Stress Factory, police officers found him in his hotel room at the Hyatt Hotel in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and rushed him to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in that town. TMZ reported that he had been in a coma for four days when his family had life support removed. He died on September 29, 2010.
