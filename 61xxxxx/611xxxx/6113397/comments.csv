Good news: If you dont't want to download, don't care or whatever. Just go to www.history.ca navigate to Ice Pilots NWT and watch from there.
!!!BUT!!! If you're outside Canada, YOU MUST REDIRECT your browser via Canadian proxy, to watch the show :(. 
How to do it, just google, it's not a rocket science.

Bad news: Quality, well I would say, is far from perfect. It's a rip from History.ca website /.flv file/. 
AND PLEASE stop bitchin, how to open it. Just use decent video viewers, or again google is your best friend. 
/ V-7; A-5. / Anyways, still watchable.

Please seeeeed !!!

And at the end, as usual: BLAME CANADA !"

,lion38,2011-01-21T15:42Z,"Thanks matey

1. May I ask what application you used to download the flv from the history.ca site?

2. May I confirm,  are you a Windows user?

3. I'm trying to learn might you teach your method in detail, please kind sir?"
,tellme2,2011-01-21T16:42Z,I'd like to learn how as well. Can you teach us mirogster?
[V],mirogster,2011-01-21T17:40Z,"@lion38

Guys, i'ts simple like abc:

1. I'm using Replay Media Catcher.
2. Yes, I'm on Windows 7.
3. I'll try:
If you're outside Canada, you must redirect your browser to Canada via proxy (try google: canadian proxy). And use it like 'middleman' (proxies are that for) between your computer, History.ca server and file itself. Their copyrights forbid to watch outside canada straming video :(
Files are stored as FLV (web streaming Flash), so for now there will be no better copy :(
Just run flv catcher first, then normal browser (with connection set to proxy) and navigate to canadian server :) 
So, in short:
Redirect to proxy, have a good RMTP ripper (web straming ripper) and finally some patience with settings & experimentations. 
Good nite & Good luck!"
,tellme2,2011-01-21T18:59Z,"You are very kind to teach us your method, thanks"
,tellme2,2011-01-21T19:20Z,"So may I confirm as I'm not a Windows user so I would like to teach my Canadian friend how to do this himself thus no proxy needed. Is this the correct procedure?

1. go to the history.ca site no proxy needed for Canadians
2. open the Replay Media Catcher application first
3. select the video on the history site you want to view
4. use the RMC application to grab the cached flv file and save it

Are those the exact steps in order and if not will you correct me?"
[V],mirogster,2011-01-22T00:18Z,It should work like charm :) But it will be the same file as here :)
[V],mirogster,2011-01-22T00:19Z,But actually you can download all the shows from history.ca :) 
,tellme2,2011-01-22T00:35Z,I appreciate your helpful advice. I want to learn how to do this myself as well. Yes I understand the same files but learning to help myself is better than depending on others all the time. Of course I can come here weekly if you continue to supply them but this magnetic link stuff sucks. I'm on a PPC Mac and the magnetic link thing fails so i had to ask another buddy to get the link url for me. what a hassle and it may continue on future uploads of yours. Best I also can help myself and teach a friend in Canada to help me so no proxy which also will not work for me as I've already tried numerous times through various sites. It is a Windows thing. PPC Macs for this seem to suck on that site especially. Maybe Intels would be better but no Intel
,lion38,2011-01-22T00:39Z,"Nice lesson mirogster, thanks"
,kentolsson73,2011-02-08T04:21Z,Thanks alot mirogster!! Been waiting for season 2 a looong time now :-)
