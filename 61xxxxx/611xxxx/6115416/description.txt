Writer Jennifer Hills (Butler) takes a retreat from the city to a charming cabin in the woods to start on her next 
book. But Jennifer's presence in the small town attracts the attention of a few morally deprived locals who set out 
one night to teach this city girl a lesson. They break into her cabin to scare her. However, what starts out as 
terrifying acts of humiliation and intimidation, quickly and uncontrollably escalates into a night of physical abuse 

and torturous assault. But before they can kill her, Jennifer sacrifices her broken and beaten body to a raging 
river that washes her away. As time passes, the men slowly stop searching for her body and try to go back to life as 
usual. But that isn't about to happen. Against all odds, Jennifer Hills survived her ordeal. Now, with hell bent 
vengeance, Jennifer's sole purpose is to turn the tables on these animals and to inflict upon them every horrifying 
and torturous moment they carried out on her... only much, much worse.
