This is for all the hard work Knallpus (http://thepiratebay.org/user/Knallpus/) has done. For everyone who has downloaded but never bothered to thank him even once, just once in a while would be nice. The MP3\'s are one continuous file ripped from the vob set at the same bitrate. Your choice: MP3 for each DVD or an ISO ready to burn with both files. 40 tracks on each MP3, 80 on the ISO.Fits nicely on one CD ready to play in any device that supports MP3 format CD\'s. Please share. Don\'t hit and run.
