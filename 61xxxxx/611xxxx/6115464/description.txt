This is a high quality DVDR of Van Halen's stop to Baltimore, Maryland in 2008. It's got superior sound and video quality and from what i'm told this comes straight from the taper. It's audience shot, but has excellent closeups and pans. I have tons more Van Halen, so i'll eventually upload them! Enjoy!
