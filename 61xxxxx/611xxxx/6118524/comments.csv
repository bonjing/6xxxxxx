,BringMeDown,2012-01-08T22:23Z,"Thanks for uploading this.  I can't say anything about the quality of the video/audio or the film itself.

I can say that the download is quite slow.  Not many people seeding right now apparently.  I'll seed for a few days once I've got the file.  I up at 280 KB, so it should help out quite a bit.

Good luck."
,BringMeDown,2012-01-08T22:26Z,Actually forget my last comment about it being slow.  I'm getting 1.2 MB/s right now.  Not as great as I'd like but it'll do.  :)
