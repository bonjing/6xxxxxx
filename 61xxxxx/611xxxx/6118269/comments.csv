,Chr1ll337,2011-01-21T23:23Z,Can someone confirm that disc two is only needed for Multiplayer?
,ckcc,2011-01-22T09:34Z,"Due to some contradicting facts from different websites, I hope that someone who is playing this game(hopefully finished the game) will give us a definite and correct answer for these questions.
1.Confirmed NO AP2.5 and Wave 6?
2. Do we need LT+ to play it?
3. Disc 2 is undoubtedly just for Multiplayer and we don't need it to finish the campaign?

Thanks. =) "

,Gierard,2011-01-30T18:45Z,"you will need also the disc 2 in order to finish the campaign.

By the way, the disc 2 have 2 corrupted .rar files so... well you wonÂ´t finish the campaign.
Why donÂ´t you just upload the .iso files?"
