,mrizzo2,2011-01-23T20:11Z,"Hi, as the torrent edit feature doesnt seem to work at the moment, Im making this comment here if you dont mind. Im sorry to say our ISP server has just gone down for this rea, they are indicating a fix within 24 to 48 hours for crissakes. I apologize to all tha are seeding on our torrents and especially for those that have been so greatly downloading on the Upstairs Downstairs torrent of ours. We will be up gain as soon as we are able and are expecting to improve our speeds even more we expect based on the nice response so far from our ISP to our needs in promoting culture sensibly and we believe and maintain - legitimately. We hope they are up even sooner than they indicate. thanks again Michael Rizzo Chessman"
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-01-24T08:43Z,thanks for staying on the job folks - we were down for only an hour perhaps! enjoy your seed!
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-02-01T13:20Z,"hi folks, we we have just been informed by our ISP that we are now having to pay for every GB we upload (no cap) we have to slow down all our torrents until such time as we have a different arrangement in place. sorry! (it was to begin in march, however we just upgraded our download speed too and that was an excuse to change the terms on us as of right now as we are being told). We hope there are other seeds that can assist too."
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2011-02-07T23:51Z,"Hi folks, we are still trying to get a better rate on bandwidth once the regulators allow for this once more in this country. (the recent decision by the CRTC put an end to unlimited bandwidth - for the moment) In the meantime, please be prepared to share your seed as our speeds are only meant to keep you going while you share the seed. So you're welcome to in, but you will need to be prepared to share. thanks "

,notouchx,2012-03-14T10:02Z,"Acorn has recently released the US version of ""Upstairs Downstairs The Complete Series 40th Anniversary Collection"".  It's up on amazon, and has not been torrented yet to my knowledge.

That collection is going to be the best quality that can be had, because the original series was recorded on video tape instead of film, which is very unfortunate but there's nothing to be done about it.  Quality will be slightly better than what you see here because they went back to the originals from iTV and did a better job of translating it to NTSC than previous collections.

That collection is also remarkable because it is the first and only edition with English subtitles for all 5 seasons.  At present none of the subtitle sites have these; you will only be able to find subtitles for Season 1 and part of Season 2."
