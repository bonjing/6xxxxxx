The collaboration between Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson was now a formal one, as they were issuing albums as a team. This was their second duo project to make the pop charts, and it included anti-nuclear and anti-apartheid themes, plus less political, more autobiographical/reflective material like \"Summer of \'42,\" \"Beginnings (The First Minute of a New Day),\" and \"Fell Together.\" Scott-Heron was now a campus and movement hero, and Jackson\'s production and arranging savvy helped make his albums as arresting musically as they were lyrically. ~
