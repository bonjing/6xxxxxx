,dzilla91,2011-01-22T07:10Z,Thanks For All Those Who Are Seeding This With Me Now :)
,slosh74,2011-01-31T03:17Z,does it work 
,dzilla91,2011-02-01T08:46Z,@slosh74 - why would i waste my time to seed and create this image plus upload if it didnt work?? Yes it is working... -_-

,stirfly,2011-02-21T02:25Z,do we need to mod for this to work?
,funzo22,2011-02-21T22:31Z,"I downloaded the ISO, my xbox drive is broken so I wanted to FTP it to the xbox but I tried to open it with an XISO extraction program, invalid XISO. I thought that's okay because it could be UDF and still be legit but mounting the disk reveals it's a completely empty ISO, no video partition or data, I'd like someone else to confirm seeing as I haven't actually burned it but I'd say this is bogus"
,funzo22,2011-02-21T22:34Z,"also to the less knowledgeable people, your xbox must be modded to play ANY burned games and this will NOT work on a 360, just go ahead and download a version that is intended for a modded 360, you will need to burn it to a dual layer dvd and it requires the security sector which is unnecessary for xbox 1 because if it's modded then the whole security system is defeated (unlike on the 360)"
,dzilla91,2011-02-22T04:44Z,"@funzo22 ay fuck you.. my shit works... i uploaded this to be nice cus i spent alot of time finding a working copy.. and this is to burn to a single layer dvd not a dual one.... if you cant get this working then you must be a retard or have  a very low I.Q. as for ftp... well i never have used that so i wouldn't know if it work, but i guarantee 100% that if you burn this then it will work.."
,funzo22,2011-02-24T03:42Z,"@dzilla91 why the fuck would you insult me, I've been a part of the xbox scene since the beginning and if a 3rd party unbiased person was to read our posts I'm sure they would conclude that I know a hell of a lot more about this stuff than you do.

Also it is very clear from your response that you have no idea what I just said in my post or you would have responded with some kind of logic. 

But anyways I was careful about my post to clarify that I never burned it because MY XBOX DVD DRIVE DOESNT WORK. About 30% of torrents on the web are fake/not working if it doesn't fucking work for me I'm going to post, if it works then someone else will post and say that, thats how this shit works, you should understand why it looks suspicious when only the uploader has commented saying it works multiple times.

and finally it is appreciated when you upload WORKING torrents (not that I'm saying this is for sure not working) but flaming people for no reason is not appreciated. Yes this is a little bit of a flame but it is not for no reason"

,ProtectedVLS,2011-04-25T11:09Z,Im new to piratebay how does one go about seeding?
,dzilla91,2011-06-22T20:14Z,to seed all you have to do is keep the file running on the torrent program you used to download it...
,dzilla91,2011-06-22T20:16Z,@leyon533 glad this worked for you..
,DJCoppy,2011-06-26T00:34Z,"already have burnt 2 dvd's, tried different speeds & layerbreaks, have tried to fixed the ISO with SS Merger and abgx360 but can't seem to get it work.. It starts up, shows the xbox logo, screen turns black for a sec & gives me an error screen & says that the original xbox game is not valid.
I've got the newest iXtreme, the 1.9 version on my xbox 360.
Any tutorial would be greatful as I'm still a bit noob at this as i just bought my xbox 360. Didn't even flash it myself but my friend did..

Thanks in advance!"
,DJCoppy,2011-06-26T11:13Z,"3rd dvd used, tried the iso burner leyon533 mentioned but still gives me the same problem.. as far as i know, the ISO needs to be upgraded & rebuilt with xbox 360 SS merger but there is no ss.bin file which it needs for the process.. Or maybe just original xbox games aren't supported by iXtreme ;/"
,dzilla91,2011-07-09T01:05Z,@DJcoppy Sorry but only works on modded original xbox with burned single layer disk....
,Spartahog,2011-09-29T16:04Z,"Alright! I downloaded and burnt it to a single layer DVD using IMGburn and plays perfectly, also it is in English since I had issues with another file(Torrent) trying to pass for English when clearly it wasn't. Thanks for uploading and seeding and will continue to seed as much as possible.!"
,wimgezel,2011-10-12T20:07Z,"heb dit juist getest en werkt perfect!
thanks
I just tried this one and it works perfect"
,julio1939,2011-10-26T15:10Z,Perfect! absolutely perfect! My children are so happy!
,Zal777,2011-12-28T23:12Z,"I have an Xbox 360, before I download it, will it work? I already have an HDD, and the update to play original games, but do I need to mod it? I hope not, thnx!"
,Tagoly777,2012-03-01T03:49Z,"Won't work on my Xbox 360?
I get this error after seeing the original xbox logo
after inserting the disc: ""family settings prohibit original xbox games"" 

But family settings are off, so what do?"
,dzilla91,2012-04-22T05:38Z,Sorry as stated before this will only work if burned to single layer disk on ORIGINAL XBOX ONLY! Will not work with ftp or xbox 360.
