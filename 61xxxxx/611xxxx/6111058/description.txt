Sanctus Security Is Proud To Present Another Great Game Torrent




Product: Call Of Duty
Platform: PC, First Person Shooter



Game Description: Call of Duty was released in late 2003 after a few months of enticing previews
and game play movies.  Before it even came out, people were calling it better 
than Medal of Honor: Allied Assault; MoHAA is widely called the best WWII
game ever created.  That would be hard for any game to live up to but in my
honest opinion, it lived up to the hype.  Call of Duty features 24 intense
single-player missions and a whole different game mode which allows you to go
online via the Internet or LAN to go head-to-head against other players around
the world.

Call of Duty is a unique game in that it calls for teamwork, strategy, and 
squad based combat rather than your typical shooter game in which you just
charge ahead and shoot the enemy.  In this game you must cooperate with your
squad members. If not you will quickly find yourself looking at a quote from
Winston Churchill on the game over screen.  The enemies are smart, they will
use cover, throw grenades, throw your grenades back at you (I'm not joking),
and lurk in the shadows or around corners waiting for you to let your guard
down.
