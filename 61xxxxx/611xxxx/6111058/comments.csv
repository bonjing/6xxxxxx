,SanctusSecurity,2011-01-19T22:13Z,"Copy the ""CoDSP.exe"" file to ""C:\Program Files\Call Of Duty"" and replace the original file with the crack."
,the-linux-group,2011-01-21T04:03Z,"Thank you! Got it all working and beat the game. Do you know how to get multiplayer working? I always get the error ""CD Key in use. Please try again later."""

,Raddaya,2011-02-10T14:43Z,"I've mounted both the ISOs on your Magicdisc, and have installed it up to where it asks for CD 2. I click OK, but it doesn't recognize the second one. Help??"
,dkhere,2011-02-10T17:30Z,"It is working...
@Raddaya: Wait for some time after mounting the second... Then click it again...
And mount it in the drive where you mounted the first cd, otherwise it won't work..."
,Raddaya,2011-02-11T08:55Z,But how can I do that? The installation process starts up a whole new window which I can't escape from to mount the second...I've been mounting both of them at the same time until now. I think I'm missing something...can you help?
,SanctusSecurity,2011-02-13T04:38Z,"Raddaya: Press ""Alt+Tab"" to go to the desktop, or use the ""Windows"" key to get to the desktop, then mount the second disc in the same virtual drive."
