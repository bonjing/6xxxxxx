Overview of NAVI
As a rule, the NAVI system is composed of the following 6 navigators and 4 content reference services:

Navigator Service
â€¢ Case Navigator
Indicate a symptom or characteristics of the problem so that the system will search for and show matching cases
from among the actual cases stored in its database.
â€¢ Device Information Navigator
Use it to bring up error/alarm/jam logs and parts counter readings it has collected from the connected machine. It
can also point out those parts that have exceeded a specific pre-determined setting by way of indicating the need
for attention.
â€¢ Service Mode Navigator
Use it to turn on service mode items built into the machine from a PC. With the NAVI system installed on your
PC, try indicating the DISPLAY and COUNTER settings or making ADJUST and FUNCTION settings.
â€¢ Electrical Component Navigator
Use it to bring up circuit diagrams or sequential diagrams for arrangement or operation of electrical components
(e.g., motors, sensors), as when isolating the source of a problem.
â€¢ Work Procedure Navigator
Use it as a source of reference when finding out steps used to replace a part or install a machine. It also shows
instructions on how to repair various problems.
â€¢ Report Navigator (for user data management and report preparation)
Use it to compile data collected from the machine when preparing a service report. It may also be used to
maintain user data.
