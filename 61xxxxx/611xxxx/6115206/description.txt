Kind of a corny attempt to make a story from the Beatles' album of the same name.  Some songs are not from that album tho.  Originally made in 1978, it contains a lot of talent from that era.  Petr Frampton, The Bee Gees, Steve Martin, George Burns, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Billy Preston, Earth, Wind & Fire, Donald Pleasence, Frankie Howerd, Sandy Farina, Paul Nicholas, and Dianne Steinberg.  It is a very fun movie for all, but still got a PG rating.  5.1 sound it Dolby Digital and DTS. 2.35:1 it is widescreen.
