Hope you're doing well.
I just watched 'Nothing personal' which you had uploaded with the movie pack on Nov 30 (I think).

Great movie.
Just saying thanks for that!

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-20T18:42Z,"@dark_defender: I did all Season one and first two episodes of second. Response was catastrophically low. It  is a waste of my time - and very very limited resources.

Therefore, long Header of my torrents contain:

""Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own."""

,odyssey09,2011-01-20T19:20Z,Thanks for Friday Night Lights... sadly not many episodes left :(
,dark_defender,2011-01-20T19:47Z,"@twentyforty: Ofcourse, its your call. I never meant to ""request"" White Collar. I saw fresh ep being released, so i asked if you are going to include it. Just a query, nothing more sir :-)

,silveroakleaf,2011-01-21T02:47Z,"20-40, as always, thanks for Crim Minds, V, and Naughty Wife...Packs can be a pain when we want to save files in different folders.....BUT it is nowhere NEAR the GIANT effort I KNOW you put into encoding these.

You should consider setting up some sort of private tracker system exclusive to those that truly embrace the spirit and philosophy of P2P."
