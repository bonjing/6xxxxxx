Lisa Ling hosts this installment of "National Geographic Explorer," which follows the actions of private security firms in Iraq. Willingly thrusting themselves into perilous situations, these workers tempt fate to earn a few hundred dollars a day. Made shortly before such companies closed off public access, the documentary features interviews with on-the-job contractors and footage of encounters with insurgent forces.
