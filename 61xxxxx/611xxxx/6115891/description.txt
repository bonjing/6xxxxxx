-Version 2.0 (Cosmetic Update)

Changes:

1.  Removed all scanner images that fell in the begining of the cbr files, these screwed up file previews in Linux and Mac (can't speak for Windows, but I am sure it was the same). All your file previews should now be the comic book cover. I did not remove scanner images if not placed as the first file as they deserve their due. 

2.  Renamed files to flow better.


-Version 1.1
New trackers for best seeding experience.
