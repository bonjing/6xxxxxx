Vector Land Class patch updater -- updates Vector Land Class from 1.0 to 1.01

The patch addresses these issues:

All VectorLandClass tiles- Main features include: removal of airfield polygons from data to avoid conflicts with existing airports and work better with upcoming VLC airports (thousands of minor agricultural strips are still present!), addition of more port areas in the south Island, miscellaneous tweaks/error corrections.

All DTM tiles- Main features include: inclusion of Great Barrier Island which somehow was absent from the original dataset!, better terrain elevations around airports, watermarks on DTM tiles to avoid piracy, miscellaneous tweaks/error corrections especially around sub-tile boundaries.

All \'Base\' data tiles- Main features include: lake heights for minor lakes better tied to mesh, removal of Homer tunnel from roads data, miscellaneous tweaks of errors in source data.

Default object libraries- Addition of a couple of new radio towers.

Seasons file- Better colourisation of seasons- Spring now appears greener while summer appears browner.

VLC Configuration tool- Updated config tool which fixes issues for those using larger windows font settings as well as addition of functionality to disable library objects.
