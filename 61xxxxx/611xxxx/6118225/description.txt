Rise Of Artificial is a musical project founded during the autumn of 2010, by two of the most prodigious electronic music producers in Romania, Bogdan Popoiag (UNUÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³) and Cezar Stanciulescu (Junkyard). 

The radio premiere of the project took place on the 10th November, by the release of the first single entitled Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³Ne placeÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³We like itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³, which was first presented on Radio Guerilla.

At the moment, the two producers are preparing a repertoire of approximately 15 tracks, which will be included on the following audio material. The same discography will also include tracks previously signed by Junkyard, tracks that have been on the Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´ArpegautÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ album and hereby reinterpreted in a R.O.A. characteristic manner.

The compositions are both common and separate, based on inspiration. Bogdan is also the director of the video created for the track entitled Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³We like itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ and he will also contribute to the visuals part of the project, while Cezar will perform the primary vocals. 

In January 2011, the band intends to include two more members, responsible for the electronic elements of guitar sounds and live drums. The voice, the synthesizers, the acoustic drums and the electric guitar will therefore contribute as signature elements to the 100% Live concerts that are to follow. Up to any further changes, the ROA project shall perform with two members, as DJ Gigs.
