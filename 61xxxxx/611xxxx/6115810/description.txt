Dragon-torrents.com new releases first



Becky (Rachel McAdams) is a hard-working morning TV show producer, or at least she was until she got fired. Desperate to get a job, she finally gets an interview with Jerry (Jeff Goldblum) - who is desperate to hire a producer for the struggling show \"Daybreak\". Becky accepts the job and it proves to be more difficult than even she might be able to handle. She has to fire the sexist co-host, then try to convince egotistical news reporter, Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), to take the job, and then try and get him to actually do the job, properly. And she has to do this while falling for handsome Adam (Patrick Wilson), and trying to save the show from plummeting ratings. Will Becky be able to hold on to her dream job and her sanity?

NOTES:



IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Morning Glory 2011



Got to say firstly ...check the sample,not the best but ok for you cam lovers

The russian video was pretty poor to be honest ....loads of glares,dark in some scenes,colours all over the/cplace

and the worse part it looked like it was filmed through a goldfish bowl.

Now we tried to fix / correct what we could......even straighten up the video and stretch it out a touch,but haven\'t complete fixed

the perspective as there is camera movement so it changes and not worth the time to cut the video up in to different parts and fix.

Also had to make the film a touch duller because of the glares were really bad ......



Overall for a cam v5 a5 .......camlovers yes,quality whores HELL NO!!
