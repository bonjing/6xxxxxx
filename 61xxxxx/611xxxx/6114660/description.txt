"Awkward Paws is the one man project by Canadian university student, Craig Mara, who uses guitars, synthesizers, pianos, drum loops, and other samples to share his unique brand of DIY pop music. Recorded entirely at his home studio with no outside assistance, Craig packs his songs with sonic detail, which only compliments the unconventional pop songs, making this album an experience not often heard by independent artists. Previously nominated for local album of the year in his town with his debut, this album is a big step forward and brings in ambient backdrops, and squalls of noise to stronger, moodier songs, and better performances. This is for fans of Built to Spill, Modest Mouse, Spiritualized, Wilco, and Radiohead. Awkward Paws is currently recording his third album which will be out next year."
