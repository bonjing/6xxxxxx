Welcome to Megacity and welcome to your new job: bus driver!
Get behind the steering wheel of one of the many different bus models and master one of the countless tracks in the fictional city Megacity.
But keep and eye on the timeplan and transport as many passengers as possible. Reckless driving or unpunctuality will result in a bad reputation and penalty fees.
Only when you keep the schedule, you can arrive at the bus stop when the most passengers are waiting. Too early or too late and you wonâ€™t be able to sell that many tickets.
Depending on your success and reputation, the tracks get more difficult, longer and more complex.
Choose between different bus models, 8 different bus models are already included, more can be downloaded via the internet. But remember, only paying passengers will result in enough cashflow necessary to run the bus company.
Buy or rent larger busses, keep the service running and check up on all busses. Or invest in ad campains or special offers to attract more customers.
Extra income can be generated by renting ad spaces on the busses.
A total of 18 completely different tracks through different districts (suburbs, downtown, industrial, business center etc.) offer long hours of fun and challenges.
Prepare yourself for driving in all types of weather conditions (sunshine, snow, ice, rain, fog), different daytimes and the number of passengers depending on the daytime and weather as well.
To show what you are made of, you can try to get into the world-wide highscore list.
No matter if you are beginner or pro, this simulation challenges everybody.
