Mark Wills - Looking For America


Lyrics
------------------------------------------------------

Iâ€™m chasing down a memory
Of the way that things used to be
Kids playing underneath an old street light
Knowing they were safe when they laid down at night
I'm looking for something I ainâ€™t seen in a while
Iâ€™m looking for a factory
Where a man can feed his family
Not worried about them moving it South
Closing the doors and shut 'er down tomorrow
Iâ€™m looking for America

Chorus

The land of the free and home of the brave
Seems like I just woke up one day
And it was gone gone, long gone
But I know in my heart is still out there
Can somebody please tell me where
Iâ€™m looking for America

Iâ€™m searching for an old church steeple
Where inside you find people
Who live their lives unashamed
And they ain't afraid to say God name out loud
Iâ€™m looking for America

Chorus

Iâ€™m out here looking for the truth
A few folks to waive the red white and blue
Who still believe freedom isn't free
And I guess is up to you and me to find it
Yeah we got to find it
Cause weâ€™re looking for

Chorus
