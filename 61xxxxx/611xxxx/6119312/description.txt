This spy parody was the first of 3 well-produced 
feature films that Morecambe & Wise made
during time off from their TV series in the mid 1960s, 
and one of two that were never uploaded here.

If you guys do a good job helping me seed when you finish, 
then maybe I'll upload the other one tomorrow.
