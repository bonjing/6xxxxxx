Much lower file size, but apparently also 720p?"
,AlfNader,2011-08-13T12:06Z,MPAAss: The smaller one looks terrible compared to this because it has a really low bitrate. That one will look ok in scenes with little movement but otherwise it will be blurry and pixelated while this will look much smoother throughout.

Movie: 10/10

The (debatably) quintessential action movie, as awesome as always. Transfer is surprisingly good, with expected film grain. File includes a 5.1 DTS audio track and a 2.0 stereo track. Video quality is superb. Well worth the 6.5GB."
