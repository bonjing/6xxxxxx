,tpbang,2011-01-21T18:58Z,"Hello Sam ,
I need a serious help from you, can you give the full details about to how to encode movie in mkv to avi so that i can watch all movies through playing dvd player? My DVD player supports the divx format .please sir help me...I have wasted hundreds of hour but couldn't able to convert. I used many converter but the they take very long time for conversion( usually 3 hours)."
[V],SaM,2011-01-21T19:18Z,u have a sample u can check it and decide 
,K4L3L,2011-01-21T21:47Z,"SaM...
Can you please post a link to the subtitles for this file?"
,Agent.25i,2011-01-22T00:51Z,"donr be a dick sam, he was asking a valid question... did you just re-up another copy of an oos file?"
,Riblit,2011-01-22T02:05Z,down load a movie converter i use prism video converter but thats not free theres heps of free ones out there
[T],artpepper,2011-01-22T02:14Z,"You're being evasive, Sam. Either it's OOS or it's not. This 'watch the sample and decide' bullshit won't fly. 

I'm going to assume that your shifty answer means that this is OOS. I'll wait for a more honest uploader. Shame on you."
,teejai,2011-01-22T03:39Z,"Sample - Very little speaking, only near the end are you able to match up any movement of mouth to words, and it seems to be ok but only way to know for sure is to watch the entire movie I guess (Just cause the sample is in sync doesn't mean the rest is).. Quality wise it looks/sounds good, its a R5..  I think it should be fine though, I'll download, watch and let you all know"

download a prog called -CONVERT X TO DVD
its easy to use and in my opinion the best and quickest way to burn dvds from downloaded files"
,hulme226,2011-01-22T10:25Z,"@tpbang
As per your Q ""can you give the full details about to how to encode movie in mkv to avi? "" The easiest and quicikest (for me) is mk2vob (it`s free and easy to use, see link below (l still owe those guys/gals some donation) like l said it`s FREE, so no payment.
http://www.3r1c.eu/mkv2vob/mkv2vob.exe
To your next Q ""My DVD player supports the divx format .please sir help me...I have wasted hundreds of hour but couldn't able to convert. I used many converter but the they take very long time for conversion( usually 3 hours). 
No need to convert downloaded movies to watch on your divx enabled DVD player, just burn it to DVD disc (or better if your DVD player can play USB video)
For the burning of downloaded divx/xvid (which most downloaded movies are) to DVD, l use various software, but for ease of use DIVX Player comes trump see link below.Like l said for ease of use and Once you get to know all the softwares available you can choose and pick)

Hope it helps."
,mutualaff,2011-01-22T10:28Z,The audio is in sync. 
[V],SaM,2011-01-22T11:51Z,if it was oos i wouldn't have upload it here..or i would say that in info...source used was the same shity line around..but no sync issues...

If there is no need for size change try something that works for me!
Go to- My computer, tools, folder options,view- then uncheck box where it says -hide extensios for known file tipe, apply!
Now go to folder where is your movie, right click on it, properties, under general where is the title of the movie you change last three letters from mkv to avi or divx, hit apply and you are done!!

Just be sure to check that bow for file extensions back to avoid problems!

Again, this works for me, hope it will solve your problems!"

Commenting on quality is not the same thing as bitching and complaining.

,dlarrym1111,2011-02-16T06:49Z,"@Dappleblood : Impossible to be a VIDEO_TS file type. That is the format used in retail DVD's You cannot fit a full length movie using the VIDEO_TS -encoding/format/file type- with a small amount of memory. It would never fit into the stated 704.72 MB.  I guess you could compress the ever living hell out of the movie but the quality would be so screwed it would be un-watchable.

Furthermore, SaM posts great quality uploads and 2ndlly, I can't say for certain, but I have not seen a VIDEO_TS format (DVD-R, already authored to be burned to a Blank DVD.

Lastly, Thanks SaM for your ""as usual"" great quality, However being an R5, the Audio does suffer for it.

@Dappleblood : If your VIDEO_TS comment means something else, (you didn't give much in that comment to go on) I may stand corrected (don't know your meaning)."
