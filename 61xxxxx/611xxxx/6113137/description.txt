The Kings Of Nuthin'
Fight Songs (2002)

Eight men strong and featuring piano and saxophones, Boston's The Kings Of Nuthin' play a gritty, street punk version of '50s rock, big band jazz and swing. It's boisterous, exciting and fun, and makes you immediately think how great it would be to see this energetic music hybrid performed live.

With a voice that makes you wonder how vaudeville would have been if Jimmy Durante was a street punk, front man Torr Skoog barrels his gravelly vocals through each song, while Zack Brines hammers on the piano in a decidedly manic fashion. This alone could carry these guys, but the saxophones and washboard are pure icing.
