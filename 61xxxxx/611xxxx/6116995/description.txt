Review by David Jeffries

Only a slight step down from his excellent debut album, Good Day to Cross a River, Midlife Vices is comedian Greg Giraldo in fine form, ranting and raving about despair and depravity in front of a N.Y.C. audience where the crowds are most accepting of his scummy sense of humor. New York provides the inspiration for the first part of the set, being a city where insults like "You Got A.I.D.S Yo!" are shouted across streets and where arguments about the best Disney song results in fist fights and "MF'n" name-calling. This tough background is perfect for the gruff Giraldo, who came up on the Comedy Central Roast circuit, and as his very funny bits about growing old, politics, and sports shoot off one rapid-fire gritty joke after another, it's easy to ignore how standard the topics and the structure of the set are. Save some routines about peanut allergies and a shift towards greener energy production, this familiar-feeling set could have come in any era from the '80s onward, but Giraldo fans don't care much about innovation. They prefer gutsy stuff, sometimes gross, and sometimes downright mean, but always funny with that cocksure, New York state of mind. On that front, Midlife Vices satisfies, and anyone who appreciates grisly humor or "Kangaroo Fucking" will be laughing.

Biography by David Jeffries

Known for his intense delivery and intense material, standup comedian Greg Giraldo (December 10, 1965 Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ September 29, 2010) became famous thanks to his regular appearances on The Howard Stern Show, The Late Show with David Letterman, and the Comedy Central television network's series of celebrity roasts. Before he roasted folks like Chevy Chase, Pam Anderson, and William Shatner, Giraldo was a regular panelist on Comedy Central's Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. Besides developing and starring in his own sitcom -- Common Law, which lasted one season in 1996 -- and his numerous talk show appearances, Giraldo has been featured in two Comedy Central Presents specials -- one in 2000, the other in 2004. Also in 2004, he appeared on Lazyboy's "Underwear Goes Inside the Pants," an international hit that topped iTunes' electronica charts. In 2006 he released his debut album, Good Day to Cross a River, on Comedy Central's record label. Midlife Vices followed in 2009.


Death

On September 25, 2010, Giraldo overdosed on prescription medication. After he failed to appear for a scheduled performance at the Stress Factory, police officers found him in his hotel room at the Hyatt Hotel in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and rushed him to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in that town. TMZ reported that he had been in a coma for four days when his family had life support removed. He died on September 29, 2010.
