"This book looks at all aspects of a psychology career from being an undergraduate major through the weighty choice of a career in neuropsychology and everything in between. This book would work well as a textbook for a career planning course or for an individual who is contemplating entering this field." (Suite101, August 2010)

"A worthy addition to the growing literature on the keys to success for undergraduate psychology majors, the Helms and Rogers text is likely to be one of those books that conscientious psychology students refer to again and again."
â€”William Addison, Eastern Illinois University

"The Helms and Rogers text truly focuses on helping students achieve their educational and career goals. The authors go beyond the typical career books by presenting a realistic, robust, and diverse picture of possible careers in psychology. Bringing a variety of careers to life, the professional spotlights and profiles of real psychologists represent the true diversity of careers in the field. I look forward to discussing it with my students."
â€”Tracy Zinn, James Madison University

"Helms and Rogers present critical information to help students get the most out of their psychology major. In addition, this book will answer questions about graduate school that students don't even know they have to ask. If students take the advice seriously, it will ensure their success."
â€”Barney Beins, Ithaca College
