,babak160,2011-01-20T12:33Z,the seed/peers statistics update is not that frequent. 
,Monroville,2011-01-20T17:59Z,"Just to let everyone know, I will be unseeding just for the next few days "
,Monroville,2011-01-20T18:01Z, I am concentrating on moving this file over to cramit-in (which should be done in 32 to 48 hrs).  After that I will begin reseeding until someone has this at 100 percent.
,Monroville,2011-01-31T15:03Z,"If this ever starts to die down Seeder wise, post a comment and I can begin re-Seeding.  I usually check up on this at least once a month."
,Phov,2011-07-30T15:12Z,"thanks a lot

,tgruuu,2011-10-04T00:11Z,IÂ´ll be seeding this for a couple of days.
