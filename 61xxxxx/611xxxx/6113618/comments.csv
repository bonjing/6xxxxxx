,egervari,2011-01-20T04:58Z,"Can I get this to work while being connected to the internet? With other dlc packs, the game reports that the dlc's haven't been authorized if I run the game while being connected to the internet... but everything works fine if I am not connected. Anyway to change this? "
,tyrune18,2011-01-20T10:11Z,"@egervari
Honestly, following my instructions precisely means that I can play the game with all DLCs installed perfectly while being connected to the internet. I tested it several times, so I have no idea why you can't be connected to the internet when you run the game. All the advice I can give you is to do a clean install of ME2 and make sure you perform step 5 of the instructions before you install any DLCs. Other than that I haven't got a clue what the problem may be...
Hope this helps."
,egervari,2011-01-20T11:55Z,"Actually, I figured it out. giveme2entitlements_v2.exe does not work if you have more than 1 internet connection or are using a pppoe connection (common for dsl). It selects the wrong network adapter by default, so that is why is doesn't work. I found a file called MassEffect2DLCUnlockerGUI.exe which does the same thing, but you can select the network adapter before it applies the fix to that .ini file. Too bad you didn't also include this file :( If you do a google search, a guy named inatan or something made it."
,tyrune18,2011-01-20T14:46Z,"@egervari
Great job figuring out the problem. You have my thanks.

So, all the people that can't be connected to the internet when running the game just have to download the ""MassEffect2DLCUnlockerGUI.exe"" file and run it instead of the ""giveme2entitlements_v2.exe"" file. The file can easily be found on google."
,Xplinter,2011-01-20T18:23Z,"Thank you for the update, i will try to make it work this time."
,Xplinter,2011-01-21T17:43Z,"It worked perfectly!!! Thank you very much.

It took me a lot of time to install but it was totally worth it, I now have all 20 DLC's installed.

I also noticed that with your older torrent I had just installed 6 DLC's (including the Shadow Broker) but this torrent worked perfectly.

Thank you!

You do realize that you first have to install the DLCs before you use the activator, right!?! There is nothing to activate if the DLCs are not yet installed (that's why it can't find the DLC folder). The activator ""giveme2entitlements"" doesn't install the DLCs for you: you have to do that manually by double clicking the other .exe files in the torrent....."
,Sugram1,2011-01-26T22:21Z,"ok then i ask is ""giveme2entitlements_v2.exe"" activator? if YES then i'm dumb XD cos i think it is file what installa all DLC file XD"
,tyrune18,2011-01-26T23:03Z,"@Sugram1
YES, the giveme2entitlements_v2.exe file is the activator and it does NOT install the DLCs!!! You should run this file only AFTER you have installed the individual DLCs. The individual DLCs are installed by double clicking all the other files in the torrent (such as ME2_AegisPack.exe, ME2_Hammerhead.exe, ME2_Sentry.exe, etcetera).
I can't make it any clearer than this. Next time READ the instructions better!"

OK, I have tested everything for about 24 hours. If you own the retail copy (Physical copy, not sure of DL'd ones) you don't need the crack.

By the way what do you guys think about the hammerhead. Everyone (almost) hates it in the Bioware forums. I think that if improved a little bit more it could offer a fun time in ME3. I wonder if I'm the only one who doesn't miss the Mako from ME1."

No, I'm missing only one. Project Firewalker is included in this torrent under the name ""ME2_Hammerhead"". You're right about Alternate Appearance Pack 2 though... It is not included in this torrent, but you can download that one separately here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6161393/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_-_Alternate_Appearance_Pack_2

,tyrune18,2011-02-28T14:57Z,"@MBHunter
You can easily download the activator separately using this torrent. Just download and open this torrent and then specify in you bittorrent client what files included in the torrent you want to download and what files you don't. In your case, just select the activator and deselect everything else. That should work fine. I'm afraid I can't tell you exactly how to do it because the procedure depends on your bittorrent client, but it should be very easy to find out. I trust you can figure it out...
Regarding the fact that you use an original version of ME2: don't worry about it, as long as you follow the instructions precisely you should be fine..."

,tyrune18,2011-03-01T21:08Z,"@Sugram1 
You should indeed receive a message on Shepard's private terminal concerning the Firewalker pack when you have installed the DLC correctly. As that doesn't happen in your case, I suggest that you first check whether the files are correctly installed. You do this by opening your ME2 directory, then you go in the ""BioGame"" folder and then in the ""DLC"" folder. In this folder there should be one folder for every installed DLC. The folder for the Firewalker pack is called ""DLC_UNC_Hammer01"". If you can't find this folder it means that the DLC is not installed. In any case, try installing the DLC again (when all fails use Vista compatibility mode when running the installer) and run the activator once more. If that doesn't solve your problems I don't know what will...

Good luck!"

I have discovered that it is simply due to there being absolutely no files in the folders for each DLC. i have looked, and only three of them actually contain files, the rest are blank folder, and there should be more folders in the first place.

I have tried all of the compatibility modes and running it as administrator. I have tried different variations on installing each DLC. I have tried manually making sure that every single folder in the game directory is directly privelaged to my account, and every other account. I have made sure the files are not read only. I have tried disabling all forms of anti-malware on my computer.

The installer for the DLC pack gets to the part where it says ""executing commands."" The bar continues to move for a little bit, and the computer thinks for a moment. After a few seconds it says setup was complete, despite the bar only being 1/3 of the way to comlpetion.

Suggestions?"
,hamazan,2011-03-10T09:17Z,iamnohippe-have you checked your files with your torrent program to ensure your download itself is not corrupt?  I am using Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit and everything installed and worked perfect.
,Dopoush,2011-03-14T15:50Z,"I thought I would share my experience with this torrent, and installing the DLC. Not only to hopefully help others, but to give back for such a great upload. First ... 

Windows 7 64 Bit edition (So yes, it does work on this platform)

Second, the read me was backwards for me. It said to patch this game, drop the crack, then install the DLC. Using this method however, ended up in me getting wrong CD key code errors when trying to start the game. By patching, installing the DLC, then dropping the crack in, it fixed this for me. 

Lastly, I used http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5354755/Mass_Effect_2_%5BFULL%5D___Games4theworld__ this torrent, instead of the 13+ gig Mass Effect 2 torrent. This is the same game, just with all languages stripped out other then English. Yes, the huge gigabyte difference is all in the dropping of the multiple language audio files.

Side note: Anyone saying ""Key-logger"" or that their virus scanner picks this up as a ""Trojan"" or any such nonsense is completely wrong. It is common knowledge that anti-virus pick up many programs made to help crack or pirate software as harmful for your computer. Being a computer nerd myself I can guarantee you this torrent is not only 100% safe, but the best on the Pirate bay for ME2 DLC.

Thanks

For ppl who are receiving the following error message ""Could not get adapter entropy"" or the giveme2entitlements/MassEffect2DLCUnlocker keeps crashing you should have a LAN card on your PC.

The DLCs and crack exes worked fine right after I installed a LAN card, or re enable in BIOS if disabled.

Thanks again for this awesome Torrent."
