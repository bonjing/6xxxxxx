To what point is SATA supported?
SATA I
SATA II
SATA III
Are drivers for all three included?
Most new mobo's now have 2 SATA III ports and 4 or more SATA II ports."
,platonios,2011-03-26T13:41Z,"if this will work i will announce you as my hero. I am interested on x64 bit version service pack 2.

P.S for all : (this might help some) I use vuze torrent to download programs (right now I am on a mac) and I saw in the window vuze's interface that this torrent has no folders and all the files where in the root directory listed by name. BUT when I did a right click on a file and gave the command ''show in finder'' (''finder'' as we say ''win explorer'' for win systems), the file was in the appropriate folder. Which means that this torrent has all of the 6 folders that the description says.

final cnclusion (before the installation cause I'm still downloading this) : 

YES DOWNLOAD IT. 

Folders in the root directory of this torrent do exist.
I will test it for viruses,install it e.t.c, ''fight'' if problems and issues come up and will comment.

we must help each other

A big THANK YOU @SanctusSecurity"
