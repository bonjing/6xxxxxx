Road Kings
Rockabilly (2003)

Having a love for early country acts like Johnny Cash and Hank Williams, members of the Road Kings wanted to add their own brand of country and modern rock to their home state of Texas. On top of their ZZ Top, Junior Brown, the Supersuckers, and Beck influences, Jason Burns (uptight bass), Richie Vasquez (drums), and Jesse Dayton (guitar/ vocals) made their Surfdog Records debut in 1999 with self-titled first album.
