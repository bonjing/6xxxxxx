It reacts differently from all the others; open a command promt instead of an installer, there's no image showing up on the ""My Computer"" CD Drive, etc. Just little things that indicate that maybe the .iso file is bad or missing something."

,msporredoss,2011-09-07T20:15Z,Just tried to install and yes the Scooby Doo is not working.
,angelsoft,2012-01-09T17:38Z,Spongebob isn't working for me. It'll mount and install but there are no actual program files like in the others.
