    BASSWEIGHT is a feature length documentary that offers an                
    unparalleled insight into the subterranean world of Dubstep.             
    Charting the genre's growth from obscure origins in south London to      
    global recognition today, the film features in-depth interviews with     
    many of the DJ's, producers and promoters who have been instrumental     
    in Dubstep's ongoing evolution.                                          
                                                                             
    Skream, Benga, Kode9 and Mary Anne Hobbs are just some of the key        
    players who have contributed, reflecting on the movement they've         
    helped shape; a movement that has come to define the importance of       
    underground music in the 21st Century.                                   
                                                                             
    This highly stylised film travels from Dubstep's birthplace in           
    Croydon to Europe, Brazil and Japan, demonstrating just how huge an      
    impact this initially indigenous scene has made at an international      
    level.
