,bajeezus,2011-01-23T07:43Z,"Since a lot of people are still new to this, can someone explain how your could go about playing this?"
,Morphined,2011-01-23T12:07Z,"1) Unpack rar somewhere.

2) Transfer the folder to the directory your backup manager uses (either Games, Gamez or some other)
2.a) PS3 doesn't digest NTFS, so you better use FTP transfer (install FileZilla on your PC and BlackBox FTP on the PS3)
2.b) If you have a nice and large external memory device with FAT32 file system, just copy it there, plug into your PS3 and use some kind of a file manager (MultiMan will do) to copy the game from usb to the folder your backup manager uses.

3) Launch your backup manager on PS3

4) Find your game in the list

5) Press LOAD.
5.1)Note that you sometimes need to have a legitimate blu ray inside the PS3

6) Exit to XMB

7) Launch the game that should be loaded by now and look like it's on the bluray you have inserted earlier.

8) Have fun!
8.1) If you have some crashes and hangups - don't panic. Pull of the cord from your PS3 and reinsert it. It happens every now and then, but it's totally fine."
,-spook-,2011-01-23T13:29Z,Thanks for the instructions Morphined. I'll try it out and let you guys know if it works.

Yes that should work. If Gaia manager doesn't read it try using other backup managers such as Rogero manager or Multiman."

,Killerko,2011-02-06T03:33Z,"Ok guys, here is the detailed installation on this one... as I had a hard time to get it to work and there is NO explanation anywhere on the interwebs..... I almost went to buy the game >.>

this worked for me:
(i have 60GB ps3 the first model sold in UK)

1. you need to run Kmeaw (3.55) CFW... so if you are still on geohot get kmeaw by first installing sonys official firmware (3.55 for me) and then Kmeaw one on top of the official one... (It said a few times to me that the file was corrupted so I redownloaded it a few times, that sorted the cfw)

2. when you are running kmeaw you need a backup managment program... as the description here says OpenManager 2.1 (more exactly version ""2.1 J-2"" aka ""OM 2.1J-2 OMAN01234.rar"" is the one that worked for me) just google it, there are more versions... just copy the pkg file to any USB stick and install it from Install packages menu

3. now you need some LV2 patcher.. again as there is no instruction anywhere which one should I use I had to try all I could find... and the one that worked for me is Kmeaw-Lv2Patcher-v9.pkg Copy it to usb stick and install from install packages menu on your ps3.

4. now get a EXTERNAL hdd or some sort of storage that you must have formated to FAT32... win7 will not help you and you need some sort of external fat32formater utility.. there is a few of them hiding on the interwebs (with gui as well as console ones).. just google one and format it, create GAMEZ (or GAMES) directory (I just created both since I didnt know which one will the backup manager pick and copied the game twice) and copy the whole BLES-01040 folder inside. NOTE that you dont need any external EBOOT file, the one included in this torrent is just fine!

5. now you are almost ready to go... but there is some kind of ""bug"" that the lv2 patch + backup manager sometimes doesnt work as it should. this can be fixed by reseting your video settings of your ps3. so switch your ps3 off and start it by holding your ps3 button for a short while untill you hear ONE BEEP. your ps3 will start in low resolution mode. set everything back to normal, set your sound and disable INTERNET under network settings.

(continue in the next post)"
,Killerko,2011-02-06T03:36Z,"(continue from the previous post)

6. Start the LV2 patcher and select the first option of the 3 available. the one that says 3.55 and press X twice to cofirm.. it should return you back to XMB.. now start the OpenManager and you should see your BLU-RAY disc game that you have inserted in your ps3 and a Dead Space 2 right below it if you copied everything correctly.. on the right side there are different options, just leave everything OFF and start the selected game by pressing X. It will once again return you to the XMB but you should see 2 discs instead of your BLU-RAY title inserted... one for DEAD SPACE 2 and the second for EXTRACTION. So go and install DEAD SPACE EXTRACTION (its the second disc icon) it will take some time, after install it will ask you if you want to play right away and when I said yes extraction started without any problem.

6. again since there is this strange bug repeat step 4. to reset your ps3 and video settings. start lv2 patcher, select the first option saying something about 3.55, press X twice and you are back in XMB.. start OpenManager and select DEAD SPACE 2, leave everything OFF on the right side and press X to start.. it will return you to XMB where you can start the game with the first disc icon ""DEAD SPACE 2""

hopefully this will help somebody! just google the versions mentioned.. it should not be a problem to find them somewhere.... or try different versions"
