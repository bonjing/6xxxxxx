So I dont wish to sound ungrateful in any way but is there some reason why both the tv team and scenebalance has missed episodes 3 and 10? My wifes an avid watcher of these series and she nags me almost constanty about series 3 and 10. I am starting to think about killing her and buring her in the back garden if she doesnt stop moaning, so you see your actions could save a life if you upped these episodes soon :) Thankyou."
