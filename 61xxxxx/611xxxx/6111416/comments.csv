,juap,2011-04-13T22:55Z,"You cant even reproduce it in the iphone, ps3 etc... ""usable format""?? pfff... if you want a feedback so here is one: DONT USE THIS SHIT"
,juap,2011-04-13T22:57Z,"No bajar esta pelicula porque no se le pueden poner subtĂ­tulos, elijan otra como esta: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5354609/Pandorum_2009_BDRip_H264_AAC-GreatMagician"
,keithasdf,2011-05-12T07:37Z,"this is shit man! hate people complicated things. just wanted to watch on my pc, thats all!! if you want people to burn on disc, than make a full blue ray version, no one gonna bother with this!"
,jopalopalis,2011-06-10T08:02Z,"Hey Whingers, Go buy the movie if all you can do is whine. Nuff Said."
,yasuodances,2011-07-10T07:02Z,"HD-R-US, 
Don't pay them any attention. Others are greatful for your uploads. I prefer the ISO format because I can burn straight to dvd with out having to open MultiAVCHD and waiting a couple hours for it to reencode for use on Bluray players and PS3. 

For those that use PC, it is not hard to use a program like Daemon Tools to mount this and watch from your pc with a program like UArcs TotalMedia Theater. Just install the UDF 2.0 Reader driver first. 

Either that, or you can mount it and go into the bdmv folder and play the 000000.m2ts file directly.

Thanks for the up!"
,yasuodances,2011-07-10T07:04Z,"@ wadeal,
Learn what camcorder AVCHD is before you ridicule. It is the prefered format for bluray content.
You should not come into this torrent post if you can not read the title of the torrent post and understand what it is about."
,bobalazs,2011-09-05T16:08Z,"Love the very nice quality. thank you.
Loaded up in daemon tools, and played back the m2ts in mpchc. "
,ninline,2011-10-02T02:15Z,"Idiots who don't know what they're doing should not post.  When they do we all know they're lame ass morons.  If you have a problem, ask nicely and people will attempt to help you.  When you whine and bitch we'll just spit on you.  The poster was kind enough to encode the movie for blu-ray quality burn on a standard DVD.  This is a service to those who desire it.  For those that don't....shut up and go elsewhere."
,audvid,2011-11-26T05:54Z,"@ yasuodances and ninlines, you dudes said it right on the money..all these unappreciative, technically challenged whining babies who complain and bitch about how they can't figure out this file-format shit out and how render/play AVCHD..read up and do your homework or move on...instead of cursing the fine efforts of the few who go to the trouble of uploading  fine torrents for the benefit of the many that get it.
just bitchin a little..."
