,arcus4451,2011-01-18T22:35Z,I cant believe the North Korean guy at the end. Give me a gun so I can kill the Americans o great leader. After a US doctor made it so he could see again. WTF
,kamandcompany,2011-04-17T07:25Z,"@arcus4451 actually Lisa Ling is the ONLY American in that country when this is filmed everyone else that actually works for the doctor is from Nepal and live in Nepal. But yes, the guy at the end is absurd. Does he actually believe that he can kill even a single American by himself"
