350mb for a 43min episode"
,darclee,2011-02-18T10:33Z,"Hi guys, 
Is this the complete 5 seasons?
I think there are many more episodes than this.

Just wondering.

Darclee"
,freeisbetterthanpay,2011-03-03T12:30Z,@darclee not sure really since in wikipedia the episodes are at the wrong the place and bears ultimate survival is a special episode and there are some episodes are missing so I'm not sure that Should I download this or not.
,Roan393,2011-03-10T06:43Z,"Hey I've got a question, I looked on wikipidia and it said there were 63 episodes in total, and to make sure of that I added the amount of episodes each season from 1-5, and I found each the number of episodes to be 60..
No I did not include the specials

But on here its says there is 45 files so I can't see how this would be the full season 1-5

Also its safe to say each episode is 350Mb So 350*60 = 21000
Or rather 21.0Gb
So I still fail to see how this could be all 5."
,BloodyZebra,2011-03-26T05:29Z,"If you compare the epsodes within this torrent to those wikipedia lists:
Season 1 has 9/15 episodes
Season 2 has 6/13 episodes
Season 3 has 8/10 episodes
Season 4 has 6/11 episodes
Season 5 has 12/7 episodes
A total of Seasons 1-5 has 38/56
This leaves 18 missing episodes. Note: the above numbers are not fully acurate as the episoded in this torrent do not all corespond to their actual seasons"
,Shadow9002,2011-05-09T20:33Z,Thank you dude very much!
,anm00727,2011-05-10T00:25Z,"just to clearn things up, these are actually the first 3 seasons instead of 5. episode numbers dont correspond to each other:
season 1 is season 1 and 2 of this torrent
season 2 is seasons 3 and 4
season 3 is season 5"
,Weho2,2011-08-20T21:00Z,"hmmm based on the file structure, this cannot be complete as stated by other commentators, caution when you download, it isn't complete."
,PhreakU,2011-09-11T12:24Z,"Holy shite people...  Do some legitimate research and you'll know what's what.  Look at the file names in this torrent and compare it to what you find on Wiki and TV.com - It's not that fucking difficult.

anm00727's comment is 100% accurate.  This is Season's 1, 2 & 3 (including specials).

Why is it all fucked up, you ask?
Because in the 'torrent world' the episode/season file names were inaccurately listed compared to one's in the 'tv network' world.  You can probably thank EZTV for that nonsense.



The laziness & lack of intelligence in today's people fucking astound me."
,Zeptinune,2011-09-28T22:58Z,"Shockingly disgusting quality.. Looks like shit on my 42"" LED TV. I was able to find 8 episodes that are 720p (880mb each) though that's only 8 episodes of the 7 seasons I need to download... :/ Why do all these suck? Surely one of you guys has Discovery HD."
,Man.vs.Wild-HD-720p-PLZ,2011-11-14T22:42Z,is it possible to upload all man vs wild in 720p please?
,MuzzaFuzza,2011-12-08T11:27Z,"This is nice quality for portable entertainment on your phone or portable player.

Maybe not so much for the PC screen unless you are in it for the content mostly.

A little confusing with the incorrect season names, will make it harder to pick up the show from another torrent after I am done watching these, but I think I'll manage.

All in all great torrent! Quality is relevant to the file size, for better or worse.

Thanks for the upload!"
,btfitfbbmth,2011-12-26T02:48Z,this is only season 1-3 with specials. download speed is average of 400kb/s
