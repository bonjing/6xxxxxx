â€¢ "Cave Party"
Tyrone, Pablo, and Uniqua pretend they're cave folk and set out on a quest to Tasha and Austin's cave to hook up with the first party in recorded history. Along the way, the three friends invent items to help them cross the frozen landscape, such as sleds, skates, and the like.

â€¢ "Race Around the World"
Austin is amped up to win the gold medal in a race around the world. But he has some competition, in the form of Pablo, Tyrone, and Uniqua, who will battle him all the way. Well, it's actually more like friendly competition. Adventureâ€”and buttloads of singin' and dancin'â€”awaits!

â€¢ "Eureka!"
Everyone but Austin joins in for some good old prospecting fun. The pals congregate in a canyon and whip out their metal detectors to try and find some buried treasure. Though the gold eludes them, they score some sweet dinosaur bones. Which is kind of like gold, you know, with the preciousness of learning and all.

â€¢ "Castaways"
Austin steps back in and Tasha hits the road as the four pretend they're marooned on a desert island. Singing and funny tricks commence, but, thankfully, no cannibalism.
