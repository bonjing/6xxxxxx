SUMO Hatsu Basho- Day 10 - Jan 2010 (Xvid-AVI)
Welcome Back Sumo Fans.  Here is day 10, of the Hatsu Basho
File Folder contains;
-	Hatsu.2011.10.E.mpg		Original English broadcast *.mpg
-	Hatsu.2011.10.N.mpg		Original Japanese broadcast *.mpg ****NOTE**** The Japanese Audio cuts out just over half way.  I still have left it in the Torrent because of the interesting stuff in the beginning.  Problem is due to my CSP and hopefully will be resolved before tonight.

-	Hatsu.2011.10.E.avi		English ONLY AVI.  (See above)
-	Hatsu.2011.01.docx		this description, in a document
-	Torrent downloaded from Dem*noid.com.txt		advertising!

Choose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (faster DL).
