- Patrice Lumumba: 50 Years Later, Remembering the U.S.-Backed Assassination of Congo's First Democratically-Elected Leader

This week marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first democratically-elected leader of what is now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Lumumba's pan-Africanism and his vision of a united Congo gained him many enemies. Both Belgium and the United States actively sought to have him killed. The CIA ordered his assassination but could not complete the job. Instead, the U.S. and Belgium covertly funneled cash and aid to rival politicians who seized power and arrested Lumumba. On Jan. 17th, 1961, after being beaten and tortured, Lumumba was shot and killed.
