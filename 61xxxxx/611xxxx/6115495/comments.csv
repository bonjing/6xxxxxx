Opens fine, no trial pop up, but you can not start/stop monitoring. "

You have to install the monitor tracker (which is included) first.

When you have the Refog window open, click on the upper left logo (which says 'Monitor') and choose install.

Monitor tracking will work in no time.

Works perfectly for me. Appreciate the upload.
