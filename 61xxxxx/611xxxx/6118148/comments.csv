Really? This sounds like the biggest pile of pretentious wank ever."

the highlight of the movie was right here: 
http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2410592768/tt1481572

she is as hot as the character got but the movie is boring, no story line and has a complete lack of interest

if she wasn't in it, i would have turned it off before i got halfway into it"
,preposterous4,2011-03-23T02:16Z,awesome film. those who don't like it are ignorant and sad
,Covenant99,2011-04-17T14:37Z,"Somehow the Audio doesn't play on my PC, I wonder why...

I'm using Windows Media Player and MP Classic with latest codecs, doesn't work on both.

I'm watching mute film here with no subs....

Can anyone help?"

,atk444,2011-06-28T08:26Z,"Instead of trying to be a critic, realize that nobody cares about your opinion. And those that spoil the movie for others should be shot. Just post the quality of the upload and subtitles if missing. Assholes! 

Thank you for your time and dedication uploaders!"
,atk444,2011-06-28T08:29Z,"And for those that can't play this or any other file... use VLC Player or format factory to make it playable. Both are free.

And if you like the QUALITY regardless of how the movie itself is than give the uploader a +1... that is how they become trusted and gain recognition. "
