,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-01-22T05:29Z,"OOO, i was watching some 'Handbreak' tutorials on youtube & was just wondering, 
for ripping from a copy protected dvd disc, do you first use 'dvd-decriptor' or 'dvd-shrink' for getting the .VOB onto your computer & then put the .VOB into Handbreak for converting? or just use handbreak to do the whole job? hope this does not sound to confusing.. lol
Thanks again"

[T],on.off.on,2011-01-22T13:45Z,@yohohoandaBottleofRUM I only rip Bluray rips or Dvdrips so I've tried it. But if your gonna do a dvd directly i would go with dvd shrink. then u have the vobs on the harddrive ready for use
