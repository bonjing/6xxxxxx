,MajorRazor,2011-03-09T03:27Z,"Downloaded this today March 9, 2011. When I started playing in VLC, audio plays, but grey background also covers whole screen. Then I get message from Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime library: 'Assertion failed. For information on how your program can cause an assertion failure, see the Visual C++ documentation on asserts. Press retry to debug the application - JIT must be enabled'. After some time I also get 'VLC encountered a problem and needs to close' message. I just wanted to see this movie, instead got to see this big message. What a waste of precious download bandwidth!"
