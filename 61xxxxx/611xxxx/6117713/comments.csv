,RexRexroth,2012-04-24T23:13Z,"First and foremost: THANKS!

Apparently this version of the CD was released only in Canada.  Neither Amazon USA, Amazon UK, nor Amazon Germany recognizes the catalogue number B001439702.  The three other sites list ""Revolutions"" with a considerably different tracklisting and only 16 tracks.

I have been trying for hours to find the corresponding CD artwork. I have the correct front cover, but can only find the back cover tray card with the 16-track version.

I hate to ask for more, but if you have an actual hard copy of this CD, could you possibly scan the artwork and add it to this torrent?

Again, many thanks!"
