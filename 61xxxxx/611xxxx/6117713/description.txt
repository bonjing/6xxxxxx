From Wiki:


Stephen Lawrence "Steve" Winwood (born 12 May 1948) is an English international recording artist whose career spans more than 40 years. He is a songwriter and a musician whose genres include soul music (blue-eyed soul), R&B, rock, blues-rock, pop-rock, and jazz. Winwood is a multi-instrumentalist who plays the electric organ, synthesizers, bass, drums, guitar, mandolin, violin and other stringed instruments. His trademark style is singing in a tenor voice and playing the Hammond organ. In addition to his solo career, he was a member of the bands the Spencer Davis Group, Traffic, Blind Faith and Go. Winwood has won numerous Grammy Awards in the United States of America.

In 2008, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Winwood #33 in its 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.[1] In 2005, Winwood was honored as a BMI Icon at the annual BMI London Awards for his "enduring influence on generations of music makers." [2]

During his teens, Winwood played Hammond B-3 organ and guitar in "pick-up" bands that backed up well-known US blues performers. He formed Blind Faith in 1969 with Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Ric Grech. His first solo record album was published in 1977. In 1986, Winwood went to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 with his song Higher Love, and with this earned the year's Grammy Award for Record of the Year and another Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. In 1994, Jim Capaldi and Winwood reunited the band "Traffic" for a new album, Far From Home.
