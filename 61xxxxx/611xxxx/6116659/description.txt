                      http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1192624                 
                                                                          
                                                    
                          
                             
                                 
                                                                          
           Winner of the Audience Award at the Slamdance Film             
           Festival, this uproarious and smart new comedy tells the       
           story of Henry Phillips, a hapless modern day troubadour       
           who grinds his way through the heartland, living out of        
           his car and singing his twisted satirical songs to anyone      
           who will listen. After a booking mishap involving a            
           Christian fundraiser, he decides he's hit rock bottom.         
           Seeking to shake things up, he moves to L.A. where his         
           luck changes overnight. Thanks less to his inept manager       
           than to a wild case of mistaken identity, he falls             
           backwards into a string of packed gigs, a record deal and      
           even the promise of love. But he who lives by the whimsy       
           of show business dies by it, and reality hits him like a       
           fist in the face: an innocent miscommunication over a          
           bagel brands him a neo-Nazi in the world of tabloid            
           journalism. Luckily, somewhere between rock bottom and         
           nowhere lies the perfect terrain for his dark and              
           hilarious songs. Hailed by comedy icon Sarah Silverman as      
           "the best movie about comedy I've seen so far," this           
           hilarious and evocative film is "totally primed for a          
           fervent cult following." -- A.V. Club
