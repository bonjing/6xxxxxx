Serial works, I thought maybe I could download from companies site and insert serial that way but that wasn't possible because you have to buy the pro version. Scanned with Norton Insight and all is well. Nice little program from what I can tell. Question; can you update? usually you can't but I thought I'd ask. Peace to all, from Kitchener On. Ca."
