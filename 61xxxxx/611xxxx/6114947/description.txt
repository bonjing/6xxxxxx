Alien Soldier (ã‚¨ã‚¤ãƒªã‚¢ãƒ³ã‚½ãƒ«ã‚¸ãƒ£ãƒ¼?) is a side-scrolling run and gun video game developed by Treasure for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was released in Japan and Europe, but can be rather expensive due to its rarity in either region. The game was playable in America on the Sega Channel cable service and has been reissued for PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages Treasure Box disc. The Sega Ages version, whose disc also includes Gunstar Heroes and Dynamite Headdy, removes the sprite display limit, which makes the game run in a smooth frame rate without any slowdowns in big boss fights with explosions. Also, the player can select either the sprite-based pixelated graphics of the original game, or a new non-pixelled mode, which gives them a hand-drawn look re-created by Treasure. The game was re-released again on the Wii's Virtual Console download service in Japan on October 9, 2007, in Europe on November 2, 2007, and in North America on November 5, 2007.

The game is listed in The Guinness Book of World Records Gamers Edition 2010 under the category 'Most Boss Battles in a Run and Gun game'.
