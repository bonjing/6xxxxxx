,JAYBEE123,2011-03-15T22:06Z,"Im a VERY grateful downloader and I dont want shooting down for asking this but is there a reason alot of films are ripped/encoded at 23.976 fps? This gives the annoying `Judder` on playback,I rip all my dvds in 25 fps no problem,no diffrence to size either...Just wondering....."

Its a pretty good movie, not the best. It starts out kinda stupid.

BUT it has a magnificent cast and is worth watching for that alone!
 Kristen Bell
Jamie Lee Curtis
Sigourney Weaver
Odette Yustman
Betty White "
