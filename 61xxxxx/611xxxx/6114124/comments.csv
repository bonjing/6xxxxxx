,mst63,2011-01-20T09:21Z,"Thank you

Il look after GEX Europe V2 or update V2"
,pumpernickel,2011-01-20T15:30Z,"This did not work: ""3) After the installation procedure (copying files to the directory) is
   finished, don't click on Finish in the installer, but click on Cancel."" 

But the Cancel button was inactive (W7 64), so I killed the installer in the Task Manager.
All works fine - thanks a lot."
,VaticanCity,2011-01-20T19:06Z,Hope you all enjoying this and yes your right you must use the Task Manager to kill the process.Then delete what needs to be deleted. Any you will be good to go.Thanks for the clarification pumpernickel.Hope you would have figured it out.But now it's in writing and is correct.
,Jimstalk,2011-01-20T19:42Z,"delete the whole scenery folder located in FSX main DIR??Thats suicide!!Without the scenery folder the game will crash when loading.Ive just tried this.Heres what ive done:

I finished the steps 1,2,3 and 4 

But then you say:

5) Delete your scenery folder! Also from the recycle bin!

6) Copy the folder named ""scenery"" from the PCC Group folder to your
   Stuttgart X folder, which is normally situated here:
   FSX Folder Path\aerosoft\German Airports 1 - Stuttgart X\




I loaded the game (without touching my scenery folder {steps 1-4} ) then i made a quick flight to EDDS...Some of the airport buildings seem to be fine but the other half of the airport still has the default FSX buildings and lights.....

PLEASE GIVE ME MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS

THANKS!!"

,VaticanCity,2011-01-20T21:46Z,It's very simple to do.Failure to execute this will launch the Launcher and Blob your other aerosoft products.Hope this is better. Aerosoft is getting a bit wiser these days.Good Luck Jim
