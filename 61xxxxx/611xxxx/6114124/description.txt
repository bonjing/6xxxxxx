German Airports 1 - Stuttgart X (FSX+FS2004)


 The first airport of German Airports 1 is now \"ready for departure\" in Microsoft Flight Simulator. In good tradition, the award winning German Airports team provides this scenery of Stuttgart airport in a stunning quality.
This add-on of Stuttgart airport represents the latest status of development of the real airport. The buildings, the layout of the runways and taxiways as well as the navaids are exactly as they are in reality. Numerous new buildings and the newly built exhibition center right next to the airport have also been included.

A photo real ground texture has been used for the base of the scenery to ensure a real life feeling of the airport. The terrain has been edited to be compatible with other add-ons such as â€žScenery Germany 1â€œ,â€žGerman Landmarksâ€œ and â€œUltimate Terrain Europeâ€œ. One of many highlights of this scenery are the Dynamic Airport Enhancement Services AESLite which brings a near to life virtual reality into the scenery with its vehicles on the apron and on the near motorways!
 
Many years of experience in creating virtual airport sceneries have once again paid off and can bee seen in the new masterpiece of Stuttgart Airport which not only convinces with its rich details but also with a terrific frame rate.
