,graitor,2011-08-05T23:10Z,"So I've never played this game, and am confused as to why there are multiple versions..."
,Teknos,2012-05-28T21:32Z,"There are multiple versions of this game because these are fan-made hacks of the original Chrono Trigger (SNES). You can play the original to get the intended experience, or you can mod the game with one of the fan-made patches. These files have already been patched. "
