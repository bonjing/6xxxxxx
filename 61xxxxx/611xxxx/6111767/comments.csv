,jamiekitson,2011-01-30T02:51Z,For me the audio was way out of sync :(
,Sharak23,2011-02-01T04:05Z,"good quality, it was about DVD quality. The movie itself was slow, and at first I thought it was boring but... its telling the story of these two people, and if you think back to your teenage years Im sure it was somewhat boring as well which lead me to appreciate the raw factor of this film.

 The cast did a good job, and overall if you are looking for a romantic love story or a hollywood entertainment flick take a pass, for now. When you are in the mood to appreciate its rawness and realism, give it a chance. "
,atomblonde,2011-02-01T20:45Z,"Don't believe the haters... this movie is amazingly well acted and has a very poignant (albeit sad) story to tell.
I highly recommend!"
,jstans84,2011-02-07T14:11Z,@Atomblonde What haters? The movie has an 8.0 rating on IMDB. 
,henry76,2011-02-17T14:02Z,Awesome...Thanks :)
,mrjoshyman,2011-02-18T23:02Z,"any reason why the audio is terribly off sync in windows media player, but its better (not perfect) in VLC player?"

,brown8605,2011-03-05T09:50Z,"This movie is deffinately the best I've seen so far this year. I've seen people complain that it's boring but I really didnt think so myself. I almost felt on the edge of my seat, wondering how it was going to play out. It's a great movie and certainly deserves a watch.  "
,scottsasse,2011-03-13T23:05Z,"A & V=great for 700MB file. M=shit, typical relationship problems of unhappy people and alcoholics. The story is a tired one. YAWN!! "

,Drop-22,2011-08-18T19:01Z,"@jamiekitson You said ""For me the audio was way out of sync :("" 

Did you consider that you are slow at understanding...Or maybe, just maybe you couldn't pour water out of a boot if there were instructions on the heel..."
,Drop-22,2011-08-20T15:58Z,"Hmmm, love isn't given...love at first sight is a hormonal illusion...Loving is work...sparks fireworks flash as indication...light never shines always as bright. OK film, not for faint-hearted, could be good food for thought for couples...this lonley old cynical bastard had bitter/sweet relief/cold turkey...not commited don't bother!    "

Have you considered that there are people who don't live on the computer and don't know everything there is to know? Sure she could have asked for help or searched, but it's not like they were giving a bad review of the torrent, just simply stating a simple problem..

I'm sorry, but I hate people like this with their back handed remarks like everyone's supposed to know everything at all times. Everyone has to start somewhere.
