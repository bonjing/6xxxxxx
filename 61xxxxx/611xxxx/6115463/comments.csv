Threat detected!
Threat name: Trojan horse Downloader, Generic9.AHLW
blah, blah, blah

:-("
,attius,2011-01-21T06:54Z,"I don't know of any threat, then again, I use this on a mac. As far as I can tell, the keygen is the same as the one used for mathematica 7, so if you are concerned, maybe you can find a mathematica 7 keygen from somewhere else and try that."
[S],velvet.,2011-01-21T08:04Z,"Never take chances.
Always run keygens inside Sandboxie."
,713-2388,2011-01-21T18:56Z,"It works!
(I used VMWare w/ WinXP to run the keygen on my Mac)
Start Mathematica and when prompted about your ""Activation Key"" use ""Other ways to activate"" buttom at the bottom, then run the keygen provided here and copy your MathID in the first box (the top one), generate... now (this tricked my for a while) use the lef box content (the one that looks like LXXXX-XXXX) as your Activation Key (even if the mask is different) and your generated password.
VoilĂÂ ."
,wadkcaj,2011-01-23T20:10Z,Works fine. Thank you!
,xinostaw,2011-02-03T22:35Z,"extracted it. ran the app (without sandbox). and it pulled up a menu bar ""mac keygen"" but no window. none the menu items do anything. (OS X.5.8)"
,node02,2011-02-20T02:13Z,"I am not able to generate the activation key and the password using the Mac Keygen standalone program that came with the download. No gui is available comes up when I double click mac keygen. Do I need to install Windows on my mac to get mac keygen to work. Please help, I badly need to use Mathematica for my school work. I would appreciate any help."
,wizpig64,2011-02-22T09:44Z,"Using the methods described by 713-2388, did not work for me."
,footin,2011-02-24T18:10Z,"does this cracked version offer all the functionality as the licensed one? i mean, especially will it connect to the Wolfram Servers and import up-to-date data of various fields like market, geographical, astronomical etc."
,attius,2011-03-04T22:28Z,node02: besides X11 (which comes w/ your mac on the installation disc) I can't think of anything you should need to run the standalone mac keygen.
,attius,2011-03-04T22:29Z,footin: unfortunately I think you need an account with wolfram to use that data. everything else works though.
,mangobeta,2011-03-07T15:34Z,"I'd like to point out that the mac keygen is for mathematica 7.01, while the download is Mathematica 8, which requires an activation key.

Eitherway, if you can get it to work, let me know, but for those of you starting, this is what I've got:

Download. Copy Mathematica into your Applications folder. Open mathematica, and when asked to activate, click on 'other methods' and then click on manual activation. here you should see the Math ID the keygen will request.

Next, Download unarchiver to open the mac keygen. Insert information as requested... and I'd say enter it and you're good to go, but here's where you need the activation key...which isn't here...unless I'm stupid."
,mangobeta,2011-03-07T15:40Z,"Wait, yes. stupid. as 713-2388 writes, just use the license number as the activation key. tricksy indeed."
,hifas_shorty,2011-03-21T21:46Z,"Probably a stupid question, but would this work on Windows.
Windows 7!!!"
,codeTONY,2011-03-22T18:38Z,"tried using the Lxxxx-xxxx code given by the keygen as an activation key, as suggested, didn't work. I may have a newer version of mathematica that doesn't accept this kind of code or something, it expects a xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx activation code."
,cool3pehr,2011-05-14T01:42Z,"I download the torrent, unzip the keygen on mac, run the keygen, the program loads but nothing comes up to the screen, then try the windows based on, it says MathID does not exist !!!!!"
,jjbuelvas,2011-06-17T15:34Z,"guys... I installed it and all but can't seem to get it to work...  I try to use the functions and it keeps prompting me to upgrade worlframalpha API or whatever, apparently they cap the number of access to functions per user so wtf..  is anybody else having the same issue? "
,jaffaCake5,2011-06-18T07:42Z,I'm having the same problems as jjbuelvas. I can't make WolframAlpha queries without getting an error. Anyone have a solution?
,acerspades,2011-07-03T18:40Z,"When I launch the keygen a window pops up saying 'Launching ""mac keygen""' and just stays there..."
,acerspades,2011-07-03T18:51Z,Now having the same problem as jjbuelvas and jaffaCake5
,gchenfc,2011-08-03T21:50Z,"Im having a similar problem as described by xinostaw
the keygen opens but there is no window or anything.  any help plz?"
,meridjal,2011-09-01T16:19Z,"Having the same problem, please remove non working downloads - thanks"
,Funkybeatzzzz,2011-09-08T04:37Z,"Downloaded and activated without a problem.  But the keygen is for Mathematica 7 so you get none of the Mathematica 8 features like the smart inputting, which is the whole reason I wanted this.  Waste of time to download!  Just go to www.wolframalpha.com and it does the same thing... FOR FREE!!!"
,testItUp,2011-09-10T06:04Z,"I found a working crack for Windows that's specifically for Mathematica 8 via the cracknews.com website:

http://cracknews.com/Wolfram.Research.Mathematica.v8.0.0.0.torrent/get_186050_Wolfram.Research.Mathematica.v8.0.0.0_crack.html

I ran it in sandboxie, didn't see anything suspicious."
[T],guud23,2011-09-25T06:11Z,"This works fine and has the full features of Mathematica 8.

To use the keygen (either on a Windows machine or with the wine standalone), open Mathematica and when prompted to register choose ""Other ways of registering"" and then ""Manual Registration""

The Activation Key war formerly called the License No.  In the key gen, enter the Math ID given from Mathematica, and then enter anything of the proper format (XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXX) in the Left box of the keygen.  Then, press generate and you will have a working Password.  

The key is to replace the contents of the LXXXX-XXXX field with something of the proper form (XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXX)."
,Crazy-Dutchman,2011-10-02T15:30Z,Keygen wont start. Not in sandbox not in windows not on mac...
,fiolent21,2011-10-04T21:16Z,"it""s great!thank""s a lot!!"
,starvin_marvin,2011-10-27T18:27Z,"This works great! Thanks a lot! It took me a while to get the keygen to work though. I ended up downloading the Wine and WineBottler apps separate to get it to work. 

If anyone else is having trouble with the keygen on their mac, go to this website and get the Wine and Winebottler apps (they both come in one download, and they are free): 

http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/

When you get it go to this website:

http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/virtualization/run-windows-apps-on-your-mac-free-with-wine-bottler/

If you look under ""Installing Custom Prefixes"" it gives you a guide on how to open up the keygen file."
,hekri,2011-12-09T10:20Z,"Could anyone please give me detailed instructions how to install mathcad 8.0?  I'm usin windows 7 downloaded it without problems, but can't install it.
I can't find the setup. :("

,Asymov,2011-12-13T01:07Z,"@hekri
uhm... This version of Mathematica cannot be installed on WINDOWS 7.  This version is for OS X (Apple) computers."
,skinbag11,2011-12-30T12:57Z,"Guys, the programme downloaded and installed fine, and I even got the keygen to work. 

But now that I am on it, whenever I ask it to do something (eg 1+1), it says, 'Request denied by WolframAlpha server (3004) ...visit 'this site' for more information'.

It was SO close to working, how do i fix this?? 

Thanks"
,skinbag11,2012-01-10T14:28Z,"PLEASE, does anyone know how to help me? 

Im dying to use this software...THANKS!"
,fiekert,2012-01-14T12:30Z,"if you want the newest version with working keygen native on mac, you should take look at my account. "
,Twilight_Sparkle,2012-01-23T09:49Z,"before you start up the mathematica, be sure to have an application that can block its outgoing connections (like LittleSnitch).

There will be a .dmg and keygen mathematica_8.app file in the folder when you get it. Open the .dmg and move it to the apps folder. after it's installed, open up the program in the apps folder. then start up the other mathematica_8.app file in the folder you downloaded. When mathematica starts up, click ""other ways to activate"" at the bottom of the window. You will be redirected and there will be a Math ID that is given to you. Copy that and paste it into the keygen program. then hit save and you will be given the key and password. Throughout this installation, block any attempts of outside connection the program tries to make."
