The 2nd EP from the crazy experimental insane deathcore grindcore "squealcore" metalcore hardcore band. INTERRUPTING COW. My band, of course.

"Pocket Full of Entrails" the EP includes 6 songs with crappy recording but somehow are irresistable:
1. As I Dine on Pig Intestines: The Introduction
2. Floating Monkeys *
3. Infestation Manifestation of Crones **
4. Needlenose
5. Pocket Full of Entrails

Next album, the debut full-length, coming early 2011 along with the "Like a g6" cover!
