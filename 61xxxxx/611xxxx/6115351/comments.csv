,dandeak,2011-01-22T21:48Z,"man, this doesn't have english subtitles!"
,buur69,2011-03-21T14:30Z,"I can confirm that this ISO doesn't have English subtitles (why do you need them when the spoken language is English?), but everything else is there as mentioned. It's the European PAL DVD as sold in the retail stores, including menu and all.

Many thanks, Lindoff41! Brought back some favorable memories."
,buur69,2011-03-21T14:32Z,BTW: as spoken language can also be chosen for Spanish instead of English.
