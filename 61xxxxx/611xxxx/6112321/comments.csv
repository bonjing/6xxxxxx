,taitiez,2011-01-19T04:52Z,"Hi guy's........thanks for this movie. The sample looks great. Will you be dubbing the last in this series as I, along with many others (no doubt), would appreciate you time and effort in coverting this movie for our pleasure.

Kind regards    Rod"
,Undietaker,2011-01-19T10:57Z,"Hey Rod if this is THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST?  this is the last one in the series, I will d/l to find out"
,taitiez,2011-01-19T20:54Z,"@Undietaker......the movie is called ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"". This maybe the second movie in this 3 movie series.

Once again thanking you in advance.....Rod"
,Undietaker,2011-01-19T23:13Z,@ Rod I downloaded this and it IS THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST if you read above that is the title and its true to title wankbrain
,taitiez,2011-01-20T00:14Z,"Hi it's wankbrain here. If you care to google ""Michael Nyqvist"" and look for ""The end of the Millennium for Michael Nyqvist - The Globe and Mail"".

If you care to read the paragraph near the start of the article, you will see that there are 3 books in this series. They are The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire and the last one is The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest. These are all out on Blu-Ray discs.

The question that I asked was, are you guy's going to dub the movie ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"", if so it would be greatly appreciated.

Once again - thankyou.....Rod"
,roroboy,2011-01-20T16:34Z,"@tatiez - Group STiEG posted a good dub of Girl Who Played With Fire. I know it doesn't say so on the info here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5691103/The.Girl.Who.Played.With.Fire.2009.DVDRip.XviD-STiEG(ENG_SUBS) but it matches the files and source I downloaded. And I either got the torrent here or NTI, but I imagine they mirror the same file. Best of luck!

Best of luck!"
,roroboy,2011-01-20T17:35Z,"@tatiez pt 2

Sorely mistaken, my friend. That is not a dubbed copy, I confused it with my rip of Dragon Tattoo. But I'll keep an eye out! I don't usually enjoy dubbed versions, but this series is the exception for me."
