Slippery Slope (2007)

A sexy screwball comedy!

To get her film to Cannes, she'll have to get it on!

When a cash strapped feminist filmmaker; Gillian (Kelly Hutchinson), meets a mysterious
producer (Laila Robins), she secretly takes a job directing a porn film in order to get her
master work, "Feminism For Dummies", out of the lab.  Soon, her own slumbering sexuality is
awakened in surprising ways.  This arouses the suspicion of her politically correct husband,
Hugh (Jim True-Frost) and leads to a madcap finale of mistaken identity that threatens to
upend Gillian's best laid plans.  Fresh, witty and wise, Slippery Slope is an unforgettable
screwball comedy for our times.
