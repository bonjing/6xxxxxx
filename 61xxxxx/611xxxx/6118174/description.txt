Exiles from the Paris Commune of 1871 settle in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Their stories inspire later generations. Professor of history Horacio Gonzalez says: 'La Comuna es como un sueÃ±o'.

Four hallucinations of dissolving time and space, mixed with stories from the asambleas and piquetero groups of 2001-2003. Sun glitters in blood between cobblestones; a parliament of chairs floats over a barricade; a loner sends out signals from his apartment every night using a table lamp and a flag made of garbagebags; a city of the future rises on the other side of a dry plain. The narrator says: 'We were masters of the geography of the city'.

Four songs of 1870's Paris re-recorded in Buenos Aires 2009 - L'Insurge, Le Temps De Cerises, Elle N'Est Pas Mort, La Semaine Sanglante.

Art video premiered as installation in the Liverpool biennale 2010.
