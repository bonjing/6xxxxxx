,rspeed,2011-01-26T10:33Z,Badly in need of more seeders.
,seedneeded,2011-02-07T22:35Z,"Despite there being seeders, none of us peers can connect to them, and we are all stuck at 99.9%"
,tigersfang,2011-02-17T18:10Z,"Stuck at 99.99%.  

Original seeders may elect to seed only part of the file - like 99% of the file - and wait until a larger number of ""saturated"" leechers (i.e. leechers who have accumulated all of the available pieces of the file) build up before seeding the remaining portion of the file. This ""forces"" or ""encourages"" the leechers with part of the file to share what they have downloaded with each other - and with any new leecher who happens to join the torrent - while the original seeder watches from the sideline. At a point determined by the original seeder, he can jump back in and seed for a few minutes until he is sure that a few new seeders will stick around - at which point he can leave for good. 

It's a very bandwidth-efficient tactic -- for the seeder, anyway."
,niarlttep,2011-02-26T09:47Z,"Hi !

We wait for a long time
we reach 99.99%  !
please seed a little !"
,ARhupam,2011-02-27T01:57Z,"Is there any hope of getting from 99.9% to 100% ?
What needs to happen? Can whoever it is PLEASE ""jump back in"" long enough to get us who are stuck at 99.9% to finish this download? Anyone? or is it really hopeless & we should just give up? "
,sirmonday,2011-03-10T02:55Z,I think we're being trolled...
,mandrig,2011-03-10T19:33Z,Will this run on Lion?
