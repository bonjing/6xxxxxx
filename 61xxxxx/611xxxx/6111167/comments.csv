,muthineni,2011-01-18T15:59Z,"personally sir i think this is better for the seeds. And torrents have chances of staying alive longer( a little ) but dont know how much trouble it is for you... multiple uploads and all seems like double work..

thank you and will seed the shit out of this 85 mb.dont you worry"
,muthineni,2011-01-18T16:04Z,"sir ,personally i think this is better for seeds and also the torrent has a better chance of being alive longer ( a little atleast) but dont know how much trouble the multiple uploads and seeding each one will cause you. 
thanks for this. will seed the shit out of this 85mb. "

,guitarblues14,2011-01-20T00:38Z,"I've been downloading from your torrents for quite some time but I never got to say thanks bcoz I didn't have an account then. Thank you for your uploads, you deliver excellent quality stuff & in really small sizes too. 

On a side note its great that you are doing single eps now as for someone with a really slow internet connection I find them better to dl & easier to seed. Thanks a ton (:"
