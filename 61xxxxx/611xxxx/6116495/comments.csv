,Anza-Power,2011-01-21T20:37Z,Bad video quality...
,Anza-Power,2011-01-21T20:38Z,Video quality is bad...
,ROU-KillingTime,2011-01-22T04:15Z,"The video and audio quality aren't great, but I'd rather have something that's not great than have nothing at all. Thanks despo1ler!

BTW - Anyone know where I can grab a copy of the previous episode ""Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases"" ?"
[T],satos7889,2011-01-22T12:51Z,Pls upload earlier episodes of batman the brave n the bold..  season 2..
,Anza-Power,2011-01-22T17:19Z,"@ROU-KillingTime yeah but I'd rather wait for a good quality upload and enjoy it and not watch this and not enjoy the episode because of the quality...

Sorry 'bout the double post btw, my browser was acting up..."
,ROU-KillingTime,2011-01-22T21:04Z,@anza-power I know what you're saying. If and when a better quality version is available I'll be downing that and deleting this copy. Only 175MB so it's not a big deal for me as my connection is uncapped. I totally get that downloading something twice must suck for people with monthly DL caps though.
,hello40204,2011-01-24T14:08Z,"where is season 2 , episodes 22, 24, 25? any help can't find them anywhere . thanks "
[T],despo1ler,2011-02-02T04:19Z,"here's the better quality release you were waiting for :)
