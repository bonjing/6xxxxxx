Storyline:College students Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), along with their friend Ã“li (EyÃ¾Ã³r GuÃ°jÃ³nsson), are backpacking across Europe. At their hostel, they meet a Russian man named Alexei (Lubomir Bukovy) who informs them about an undocumented hostel near Bratislava filled with beautiful, American-loving women.The three subsequently board a train on which they meet a peculiar businessman (Jan VlasÃ¡k), who freaks Josh out by placing his hand on his thigh. The three leave the train at a small Slovakian village, and check into the local hostel, finding themselves sharing a room with two beautiful single women, Natalya (Barbara NedeljÃ¡kovÃ¡) and Svetlana (Jana KaderÃ¡bkovÃ¡), who invite them to the disco. At the disco, Josh is saved from a gang of impoverished children looking for money and bubblegum by the peculiar businessman. The next day, a young Japanese backpacker, Kana (Jennifer Lim), approaches Paxton and Josh, who are searching for Ã“li, informing them that her friend, Yuki (Keiko Seiko), is strangely missing as well. An MMS photo sent from Yuki's phone shows Yuki and Ã“li, with the word "Sayonara" beneath it. A while later, they spot a man wearing Ã“li's jacket. Not long after, Paxton and Josh receive a second MMS photo message from Ã“li's phone, in which their friend appears in a closeup face shot with the text "I go home". Then, the scene shifts to the source of the photo, revealing Ã“li's severed head sitting on a table. Paxton and Josh decide to leave Bratislava with Kana the following day. Paxton later notices that the photo of Oli and Yuki has been faked. Although Josh is anxious to leave immediately, Paxton talks him into staying just one more night, so they can have sex with Natalya and Svetlana one more time. Josh reluctantly agrees. Later that night, while partying with Natalya and Svetlana, Paxton and Josh are slipped tranquilizers. Josh stumbles back to the hostel while Paxton passes out in the disco's storage room.
