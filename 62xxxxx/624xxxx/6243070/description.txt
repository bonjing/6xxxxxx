 Description:
 Some of our best Great British produce is under threat and in this campaigning
 series, ten of the BBC's best-known chefs and cooks are on a mission to bring 
 our traditional produce back from the brink. Each chef champions a produce    
 that is close to their heart but is in danger of being lost forever if we     
 don't rally behind it. The programmes are a call to action and aim to         
 encourage people to rethink their buying and eating habits. To get to the     
 heart of the problem, each chef travels the country meeting farmers and       
 producers to find out exactly what we need to do to reinvigorate and save our 
 great heritage foods. Most importantly, they show us how to cook fabulous     
 meals featuring these great British ingredients.                              
                                                                               
 In this first episode of the series, two-star Michelin chef and co-host of    
 Masterchef - The Professionals, Michel Roux Jr. gets passionate about the lost
 art of bread making. He's concerned that mass-produced, bland-tasting loaves  
 have made us forget what real bread should taste like. He campaigns for the   
 return of the artisan baker to the UK high street and shares his own unique   
 recipes to show how easy and rewarding home baking can be.                    
                                                                               
 Hot on his heels, the Hairy Bikers get revved up and join the Great British   
 Food Revival campaign to highlight the plight of the British cauliflower. It's
 fallen out of fashion as other greener vegetables have become more popular and
 have taken its place in our shopping baskets. The Bikers are determined to    
 show that not only is it nutritious, but it can also be versatile and         
 delicious. They rustle up three mouthwatering recipes where the overlooked    
 cauli becomes the star ingredient.                                            

                                Enjoy!
