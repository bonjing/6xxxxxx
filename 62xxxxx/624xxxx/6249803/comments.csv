,sanebutoverwhelmed,2011-06-27T18:16Z,What bitrate is this? It's tiny!
,TheMott,2011-09-25T13:33Z,The bitrate is variable (VBR) and averages around 200kbps. For most listeners this will be fine considering the quality of most speakers and headphones that people own. If it's not OK for you then you probably know that already before you've got to the end of this comment.
