History
 
Early career
 
Formed in June 2010, the band consists of Justin Young (vocals, who previously worked under the name Jay Jay Pistolet, playing indie folk), Ãrni HjÃ¶rvar (bass), Freddie Cowan (guitar, younger brother of Tom from The Horrors) and Pete Robertson (drums).[4][5][6][7] The band was initially formed by Young and Cowan with a third member who soon left.[8] The band released their demo "If You Wanna" in the Summer of 2010 where the track received praise from Zane Lowe, who named it as his 'Hottest Record In The World' on 18 August 2010.[9] After playing their first gig in Leicester, they embarked on their first UK tour between September and November 2010, and interest in the band led their first London performance (at The Flowerpot in October 2010) to sell out, with the audience including Alex Kapranos, Marcus Mumford, and members of White Lies and The Maccabees, and 200 people having to be turned away, the performance being described by Clash as "fantastic, exhilarating and exciting".[8][10][11][12][13]
