"The Fragile Beast"

When a war veteran locks his wife in their 
basement to keep her from cheating, her 
lover Miguel (Guillermo Diaz), approaches 
Harry (Kathy Bates) to help -- but asks 
that she not involve the police due to 
their immigrant status. Meanwhile, Adam 
(Nate Corddry) takes on his first divorce 
case where he represents Lynette Zales 
(Ann Cusack) after a romantic affair she 
orchestrated for her husband to spice up 
their marriage develops into something 
more. Elsewhere, Jenna (Brittany Snow) and 
Malcolm (Aml Ameen) confront each other 
about their kiss.

Enjoy :)
