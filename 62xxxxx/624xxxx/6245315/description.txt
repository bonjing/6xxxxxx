Plot:

The current method of raw food production is largely a response to the growth of
the fast food industry since the 1950s. The production of food overall has more
drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior.
Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations, the global food
production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals
production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized)
resulting in enormous profits, which in turn results in greater control of the
global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the
food itself, of the animals produced themselves, of the workers on the assembly
lines, and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the
companies, and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap
food regardless of these negative consequences...
