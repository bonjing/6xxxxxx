Misty Edwards is an American indie musician from Kansas City, Missouri.

Although she is the daughter of a music teacher, Edwards did not begin her career until the age of 19. At age 19 she joined the International House of Prayer as an intern. After she joined she was asked to begin playing the piano at their services. In her role as a leader of IHOP she often leads worship and prayer services. Edwards is now considered to be the second best known leader of IHOP, after Mike Bickle and their most recognizable worship leader. She also writes articles for Charisma.

Edwards frequently incorporates bible verses into her music, particularly concerning eschatological themes. She believes that worship music is very important because it brings Divine presence to the church. Her music is often accompanied by a speaker who repeats several phrases periodically. Edwards has released several CDs, some of which are accompanied by acoustic versions. She also plays at the annual Onething conference.

At the 2010 Winter Olympics Kelly Clark was seen singing a song by Misty Edwards karaoke-style moments before her bronze medal performance.
