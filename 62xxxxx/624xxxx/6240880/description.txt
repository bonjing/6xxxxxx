                Last in the series of the drama set on a South
                African nature reserve. The family prepare to make
                their last stand to prevent the mining company from
                destroying Leopard's Den. Du Plessis and Fatani bring
                elephants to stand in the way of the bulldozers and a
                stand-off ensues. In the resulting chaos, Caroline is
                knocked over by a policeman. When they learn that her
                injuries are infected, Danny wonders whether they
                might be better off in the UK - at least until they
                can find a new home. But Du Plessis learns that rhino
                poachers are working in the area and sees a way to
                persuade Danny that he has to stay in Africa.
