M4V Can't be readed on PSP."
[T],program3r,2011-03-16T21:14Z,And i would like to find a place where i can find PSP movies with eng subs. Show some respect for the people who can't hear.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T21:29Z,psp reads m4v just fine.  stop post dumb things.
[T],program3r,2011-03-16T22:06Z,Ok but how about subs. SRT can't be used with PSP.

,gocry_emokid,2011-05-26T10:21Z,"I can't speak for newer PSPs, as I only have an older one, but I can say that some m4v files just can't be read by it. It's very unfortunate, and it seems random-- some videos I have made MYSELF work, while others I've used the same program on just don't, for no discernible reason.

Regardless, there's no reason to squeal and rage just because something doesn't work for you. Sometimes a download is bad, sometimes there's a problem with your player, and sometimes there's just random, unexplainable issues. Either way, unless something is a genuinely shitty copy OR carries a virus, there's no reason to get all up in arms over it.

P.S. Again, can't speak for new PSPs, but old-school ones simply don't read .srt files. Subtitles aren't an option."
