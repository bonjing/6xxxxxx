      Sir Patrick Moore celebrates the 700th episode of The Sky at
      Night at his home in Sussex, with the help of special guests
      Professor Brian Cox, impressionist and amateur astronomer Jon
      Culshaw and Lord Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal. A stellar
      panel of astronomers gathers to answer vexing questions from the
      viewers, while Sir Patrick has a close encounter with his
      younger self.
