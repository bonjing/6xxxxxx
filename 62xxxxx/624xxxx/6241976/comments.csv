,drifri,2011-03-14T20:56Z,if this is same torrent  as on other sites then DOES NOT WORK
,exdeee,2011-03-14T22:55Z,"@drifri: Seems like this game uses some kind of protection that provides a black-screen on startup. the torrent itself is fine, and will work using the right method of booting.

I'll update here whenever I find a solution for this problem. if anyone else found a solution, feel free to post it as a comment. "
