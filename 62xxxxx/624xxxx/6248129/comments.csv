,fahadu,2011-04-18T17:37Z,hey man does this game work on a non cracked wii?
,lmecan,2011-04-22T02:16Z,"Dude. You need to install the homebrew channel and get yourself a loader like USBLOADER or NEOGAMMA. Look for it on google, you don't need a modchip to play it."
,PNWpirate,2011-06-14T07:50Z,Did not work with 4.3u and Neogamma.  May try re-downloading.  Any suggestions?
,jay2601,2011-06-14T18:27Z,"Do i need to do anything else with this when i've downloaded it??? Tried putting it straight onto harddrive with wbfs but says error while trying to read image file from disk? 
Help anyone??"
,tjpMFface,2011-06-27T19:36Z,"i ALSO WAS HAVING MANY PROBLEMS GETTING THE BACKUP DISK LOADERS AND MOST USB LOADERS [USB GEKKO BEING ONE] i ALSO HAVE wII 4.3-U.  i NOW USE THE WBSF MANAger 3.0 and USB loader GX.  The manager is  super simple and the loader has given me only one or two game freezes that rebooted and carried on w/o error.  So PWNpirate and jay2601 give that a try and good luck.
BTW, thanx for the upload as well."
