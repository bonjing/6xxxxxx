I've compiled 3 resources along with the tools needed to create a virtual instance of Mac OS X (tested with Snow Leopard - working) on an Intel *AND* AMD host. 

Included needed boot disk downloads, screen shots, text instructions, and the torrent for the image I used. 

Required:
VMware Player or Workstation (I used VMware Workstation 7)

Virtual Box (not tested, VMware works for me)

An image of the Mac OS X install DVD (included a torrent for one, DMG images work if you have one, as do stock DVDs purchased from apple)




Good luck to all, and dont ask me for support, I just compiled. I know nothing of Macs, and don't intent to, I did this simply to say I did it. I've deleted my image after verifying it works. That should go to show you, if it can work for someone who knows literally nothing about Macs, it will work for you. 

Zipped - no password - 75MB~ ZIP versus the 150MB~ extracted. 
I would have left individual files but I have limited bandwidth, so that's two people with everything versus one for every 150MB I send out.
