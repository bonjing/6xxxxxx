Not that I'm a fan of their music, but the whole scandal fascinates me. It's definitely worth a watch.

There is audio static every few seconds. It's worse at different times. You can still hear what's being said, and you'll grow more used to it as you continue watching. I'm not the one who ripped this, so don't complain to me.

Enjoy.
