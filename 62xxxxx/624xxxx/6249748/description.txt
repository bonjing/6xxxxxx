What would you do if you couldnâ€™t get along with one of your relatives? Would you just cut him or her out of your family tree? Dr. Phil speaks with two families who are on the verge of doing just that! Melissa says she has the mother-in-law from hell who is obsessed with her son, Tyson, Melissaâ€™s husband. Melissa says Betty accuses her of stealing her son and brainwashing him to reverse his vasectomy, and sheâ€™s gone so far as to ask a stranger online to spy on the couple and report back. Betty says Tyson is no longer the same person since he married Melissa, and she just wants him back in her life. Whose side does Tyson take? Then, Pat and Rosie are sisters embroiled in a 10-year feud over their deceased fatherâ€™s house and will. Civil and family attorney Areva Martin weighs in from a legal perspective. Dr. Phil wants to know: Is a house worth tearing apart a sibling relationship?
