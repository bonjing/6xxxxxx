THIS IS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF WINDOWS PHOTO GALLERY 

THAT CAME OUT I BELIEVE IN 2007.  WHEN I UPGRADED TO A NEW HP AND WINDOWS 7, 

WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT WINDOWS PHOTO GALLERY WAS NOW "WINDOWS LIVE PHOTO GALLERY".  I tried and tried but I just
 
didn't care for it.  FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME LAST SUMMER MICROSOFT ALLOWED 

ONE TO HAVE BOTH THE WINDOWS PHOTO GALLERY AND THE WINDOWS LIVE PHOTO
 GALLERY.  NOT ANY MORE.   THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE BUT GUESS WHAT PHOTO 

GALLERY LOVERS, HERE IT IS.   DO NOT LET THE NAME FOOL YOU.  IT'S TITLED 

WINDOWS LIVE PHOTO GALLERY BUT IT IS THE OLD TRIED AND TRUE.   HOPE SOMEONE 

BESIDES ME IS HAPPY.
