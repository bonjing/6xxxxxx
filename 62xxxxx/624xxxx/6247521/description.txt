This Tegra HD version Samurai II: Vengeance is optimized for use on NVIDIA Tegra based Android devices only.

While the iOS version got rave reviews for its stylized manga graphics and quick, bloody gameplay, Samurai II for Tegra based Android phones and tablets delivers even more visual stunning graphics and polished gameplay.

Samurai: Way of the Warrior was featured in Best Games of 2009 by Apple â€“ Samurai II is a true successor, aided by over a year of focused development. Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers. Screenshots donâ€™t do Samurai II justice â€“ the fluid action has to be seen running at 60 frames per second.

But looks alone wonâ€™t carry a game â€“ the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new 
experience for hack â€˜nâ€™ slash gamers on the go.

Samurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he 
get his Vengeance?
