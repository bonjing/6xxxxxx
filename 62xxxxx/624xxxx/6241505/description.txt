French filmmaker Mathieu Weschler has invested two years creating the first feature-length (88 minutes) machinima movie made in the world of Grand Theft Auto IV. The â€œtrashmasterâ€ divides his time between collecting garbage and cleaning up other forms of trash fouling up New York Cityâ€™s streets: dealers, small-time criminalsâ€¦ When the dancers in his favourite strip club are mysteriously killed, the trashmaster finds himself hot on the trail of a particularly twisted serial killer
