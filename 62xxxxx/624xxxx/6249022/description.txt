Fans of the new crop of folk revivalists, such as Mumford & Sons or the Avett Brothers (with whom this duo have toured), will get a huge charge out of David Wax Museumâ€™s latest self-released album, Everything Is Saved. Multi-instrumentalists David Wax and Sue Slezak, along with several musical guests, fuse elements of Mexican folk with an original take on Nick Cave-esque spiritual/indie rock. Fiddles, accordions, guitars, horns, pounding piano, lots of percussion, powerful vocals and the odd backing choir of singers or multitracks come together in a new folk-gospel that has a bit of the offbeat sideshow tone that the pun on Waxâ€™s name suggests, but thereâ€™s nothing gimmicky about the wonderful confluence of traditional and post-modern sounds.
