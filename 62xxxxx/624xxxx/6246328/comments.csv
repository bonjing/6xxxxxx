,TeeSoBeta,2011-03-16T04:35Z,besides wtf else does ABC have goin for them?? Honestly?
,ThaiDennis,2011-03-16T05:04Z,"Not officially canceled yet, but it's not looking too good."
,Quad-K,2011-03-16T06:04Z,"I like it due to its extended character developments..i mean how different is the actors attitudes now compared to the start of the series? Besides the priest guy, hes always gonna be the same -.-

But thats the reason its gonna get canned, its toooo long. I like it that way but many loose focus on it and dislike it. So we shall see if a season 3 will make an appearance."
,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-03-16T06:30Z,"Yeah, download the show, just set your cable box to the channel to watch it, so they still can get strong ratings, thats what i do. Plus i download it for the no commercials.  Anyways i hope its NOT over, this is by far the best series ive seen to date, besides NCIS!  

Thanks a  bunch eztv, always the best and on time!"
