          * Full Russian bluray was used for this release. For the     
            audio, I directly converted the DTS-MAHD into AC3. Just    
            check the sample.                                          
                                                                       
          * Special filters used which takes a lot of time to encode.  
            For those who wait knows what they're getting and we       
            do not disappoint.
