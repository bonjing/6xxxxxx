mc chris has done it again!

In his newest album aimed specifically at kids, mc chris really hits home for kids everywhere. Featuring his pre-released "Hallowween" where he sings about eating too much sweet and getting cavities, as well as many other fun and innocent rhymes.

No offensive material in this one, completely safe for the youngins
