PLEASE"
,dlarrym1111,2011-03-23T06:03Z,"@Ugresset: Your incorrect, not ANY of the picture is missing on one side. Check your aspect ratio and or how your media player is recognizing the video. you are the only person out of almost 100 comments (87) that make this claim of the movie being off to one side. I have already downloaded this exact copy and it PERFECTLY CENTERED. Check your Media browser or goto your obstetrician and have your eyes checked.

ALSO @teejay11: Cage has many good movies. IMO, these were pretty good movies hes put out going back to 1983 (these are not in chronological order): Rumble Fish, Leaving Las Vegas, 8mm, WINDTALKERS, FAST TIMES at RIDGEMONT HIGH,  MATCHSTCK MAN, the remake of ""THE BAD LIEUTENANT"" (ORIGINAL HAS Harvey Keitel playing ""THE BAD LIEUTENANT"") I HIGHLY recommend to see the original. Its not that long ago that it was made (1992). to continue on GREAT Nicholas Cage movies: Knowing, The LORD of WAR, Raising Arizona, CON AIR, The ROCK, National Treasure: Book of Secrets, KICK-ASS, Bangkok Dangerous, and maybe some others I can't recall. He's done some movies that I didn't like, but, the bad movies don't negate the quality found in the ones that are good. If you came to this page, you would have ONLY come here from wanting to see NICHOLAS CAGE, so you too must have some Nick Cage movies you like. You can't have anyone here believe that you wanted to see this film for the performance of Ron ""the huge gap guy with the Guinness book of world records for have the greatest length of in centimeters separating his upper lip to the bottom of his nose"" Pearlman. Ron Pearlman is chosen for roles where having that gigantic space between his nose and upperlip is an advantage. The best example is the Beauty and the Beast TV series with Linda Hamilton. His makeup was that of a part man, part Lion or some type or Large cat. (like the Animated Disney Movie.) This huge gap made it easy for the makeup artists. seriously, go look at any clip of that show and you'll see, its bizarre how massive that space is. If he tried to grow a mustache to span the distance, it would be an 2 inches tall!!! Thanks all, Download is great.!!!"

Movie is ok-ish if you can forgive dialogue like Nicholas Cage saying things like ""I've saved your ass a hundred times"" ( Its supposed to be the 14th Century!). and a couple of dodgy Ray Harryhausen- type SFX. otherwise..  grab a couple of beers and have a break."

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

================================= Â«Â« ENGLISH Â»Â» ==================================


Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

Fucking retard, that was just an example, and 2 of those are not active, wich you would know if you klicked on them you idiot..

IT's NOT about me bitching you ungrateful idiot, it's about in general, people do not seed or say thanks, which will eventually make these big guys, just as secret_myth did, QUIT DOING THIS, so say thanks insted of bithching yourself you F***** UNGRATEFUL IDIOT!!!
People like you make these people not want to upload these awesome things for free anymore, so STFU and say thank you, or get the fuck out of TPB and the p2p (share and care) world!!!
Moron.. "
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-03T20:07Z,"AND FYI (yes payed attention to your thanks, great!)
I posted these on these top 100 torrents, to make people AWARE of what can happen that affect all of us if you do not behave better against these people who do this for us for free..

These in top are just a way to get people to notice, it's these others that I am concerned a lot about, like 3Li and HDLiTE, great teams, but even 3Li left because of morons can not behave.
That's what I am referring about, and a better example and myself, since this is not about me or you, just your ignorance attitude and personal attacking at someone who is trying to help you as well to NOT LOSE my and our favorite release teams!!"
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-03T20:19Z,"@jing500 and all who cares-
Also FYI I was of course not seeding 3 exactly same, errors that I do not have to waste my time explane to you made it 3, just one active, and now they are all gone, happy?

More importantly then that..
And I do not care about quantity of uploads, thats just ridiculous.. Focused on some movies that is really hard to get, and as long as noone have uploaded that one to other sites, we are the only ones that provide it..
All new common are these other great guys awesome at uploading, and there by leaving that to them, and therefor I as many others do not want them to go away, just because of some stupid silly thing as people can not behave proper against these who provide these awesome rips to them for free!
Do you understand what I am trying to do?
Can I talk to you civilsed or will you be one of those idiots who only can say stupid insults?
(I gave you one of those posts back there, yes, so we are even on that hehe) But seriously, be as a regular normal human being or I will not waste my time take this any further with (IF SO) an ignorant rude person..

Oh please take care of facts before insulting retard, yes it is wrong, but I can not change it, edit has not worked for ages.. (Am going to make a new one correct, but have not happened yet, not felt for it, since as I wrote, have I uploaded quite a lot to pretty many people still, even though it was not correctly named, so that is not the problem......)

Thats why I made a comment in all the other Pyaar Impossible! with a link to this one, which obviously worked because of what I wrote above..

Yes correct would make more hits, but once again, that was just an example, not relevant to this mater it self, so drop that if you want to have more answers, read the post before this one, and you hopefully get it?   "

Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 7%...

Movie was bad, really bad. Boring, laughable dialog, horrible acting, and just a mindless film through and through... it's what I expected, however I just didn't think it would be so a pointless."
,Plasmadude,2011-06-30T20:31Z,"Thanks  great film.
good download"
,RosaBling,2011-07-02T05:05Z,"Thanks again, YOU ARE DA BOMB!"
,oak415,2011-07-02T05:18Z,Next time just rate the Audio and Video quality people. I don't think anyone cares about your opinion of the movie itself.
,shinobiXRT,2011-07-04T01:15Z,Nicholas Cage + Disney = Shit films
,cuban23,2011-07-05T01:40Z,come on people seed 11 kbs come we can do better than that
[T],cdesade,2011-07-06T09:01Z,"oak415: Look man I find most of my films to watch through TPB, and I appreciate a M: rating. At least Americans aren't afraid to speak their opinions."
,MacTee,2011-07-08T22:43Z,cuban23 thats most likely your own fault on your end.  I'm getting a minimum of 320kB/s and max 600kB/s.  Doubt i'll even get around to watchin it tho considering how shitty it(supposedly) is.

,gumamela,2011-07-18T17:06Z,"oak415: i agree with cdesade. i do appreciate movie ratings too. most of the time when i dont know what to DL, i go to top100 and choose movies i havent watched.. its a waste of time (or maybe im just lazy) to go to imdb to see if i will like the movie. so to  cdesade and others who gives m rating, thanks! 

now on to another movie, guess i wont be dl'ng this...."

Don't know why Nicholas Cage took this role, but it wasn't ALL bad. Just was kind of campy.

Thanks for the uL."
