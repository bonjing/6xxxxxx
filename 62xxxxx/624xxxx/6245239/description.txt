I started off collecting, "The Golha" music, from the net, originally for myself and my father.
After some searching, I managed to come up with this collection.
Some have very good sound quality, and some do not!
I thought I owed it to others to share, hence this torrent.
I shall seed as long as possible, so please if you download it, then seed it ...
It is not zipped, so once the download starts, you can pick and choose the ones you are missing from your collection.
If you have more, and are willing to share, please contact me temp@computer-surgery-nospam.net (remove -nospam from the address first). I'd love to add them to my collection.
