,jadotben,2011-03-17T02:19Z,"Games crashes always at the same place in the ""Chase by V-rex"" level.
I tried to remove game and download again to reinstall, same issue :(
Too bad, i began to like this old game .... 

Thanks anyway...."
,defecator,2011-03-29T13:58Z,"Confirmed. The game always crashes at the ""Chased by V-Rex"" level, after you climb the vertical wall and follow the river. I tried running the game in compatibility mode for XP or Vista to see if this would somehow fix it, but it didn't work.

I don't know if it's an unpatched critical bug in the original game, that's gotten worse in Win Vista/7, or a crack bug, but it does stop game progress at that point.

Thanks for sharing, anyway :)"
