But primeval creatures await them: giant insects, dinosaurs, and King Kong. Based on Peter Jackson's 2005 remake, King Kong lets you play as Jack Driscoll and Kong himself.
Jack's levels are HUDless FPS levels set on Skull Island. Jack must use a variety of weapons, traps, and fire to kill or repel Skull Island's fauna. Kong's levels are third-person brawlers set on Skull Island and New York City, where Kong must puzzle his way through environmental obstacles and thrash his opponents

- Survive as Jack in a world crawling with predators and live the legend as Kong.
- Use weapons, traps, and your team wisely to survive in first-person as Jack.
- Break jaws, slam enemies, and throw massive objects in Kong's colossal third-person battles.
