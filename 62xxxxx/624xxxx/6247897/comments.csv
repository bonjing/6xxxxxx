PATCH 1.01 Description:

Single Player :

- Fixes an issue that prevents the player from accessing the DaVinci Disappearance DLC under certain circumstances. 
- Fixes 2 random crashes. 
- Fixes an infinite loading problem in the game menu.

Thanks for understanding , i will stop soon enough borring the users with my games files , i donÂ´t know the users never happy with anything , too much work for not beeing understanded .

Globe has been providing good shit for a long time you racist cunt - not everyone on the internet is completely fluent in english - the Pirate Bay, for instance, is NOT AMERICAN - you have PTSD or something? 

Globeplus goes out of his way to try to provide a bunch of leeches with free goods and he/she does it in a way that provides an alternative to the massive packs of the main cracking groups - if you don't like what Globe is giving you for free, then ---- ummmmmmmmm - don't DL it? PERHAPS??

there are plenty of non-ripped versions for you to get you fucking fascist. 

i'm not DLing this myself, but thanks for trying Globe - none of these whiny fucks would take the time to do this shit themselves - and they're still whining even with the many alternatives available. "
