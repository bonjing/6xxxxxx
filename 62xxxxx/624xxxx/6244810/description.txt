Description: 
In the second stop in his exploration of the wonders of the 
universe, Professor Brian Cox goes in search of humanity's very 
essence to answer the biggest questions of all: what are 
we? And where do we come from? This film is the story of 
matter - the stuff of which we are all made.Brian reveals 
how our origins are entwined with the life cycle of the 
stars. But he begins his journey here on Earth. In Nepal, 
he observes a Hindu cremation. Hindu philosophy is 
based on an eternal cycle of creation and destruction, 
where the physical elements of the body are recycled on 
to the next stage. Brian draws a parallel with the life cycle 
of the stars that led to our own creation.
Next, he explains how the Earth's resources have been 
recycled through the ages. How every atom that makes 
up everything we see, was at some time a part of 
something else. Our world is made up of just 92 
elements, and these same 92 elements are found 
throughout the entire universe. We are part of the 
universe because we are made of the same stuff as the 
universe.
