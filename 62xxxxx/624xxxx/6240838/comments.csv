,dmk12,2011-04-01T19:50Z,"Good to see a solid Godzilla collection from a single source, and these are better quality than th dl's I have.  Just wondering though if you could post the subs for these movies, my hearing has aged faster than I have.  Will you be posting 1969.Godzilla's Revenge, 1984.The Return of Godzilla ( aka Godzilla 1985 - North American Release ), and 1989.Godzilla VS. Biollante.  Toho Studios has released 28 Godzilla movies that I know of.  Also the 2002 MechaGodzilla should not be listed as a II, 2003 Tokyo SOS was its direct sequel."
,wyldewolf,2011-04-03T22:27Z,Actually dmk12 there was a Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla 2 . The Film that you are referring to was titled  Godzilla Against Mecha-Godzilla followed by Godzilla Tokyo SOS. Imdb has the list i believe. Jimejvr thank you for the ups . I appreciate it and so do my children. 
,dmk12,2011-04-04T13:15Z,Understood wyldewulf - I only meant tha G v MG II was not the 2002 film.  G v MG II was a 1993 release.  Right with you on the thanks to jimevjr.
