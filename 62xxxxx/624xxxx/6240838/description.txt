DIVX DVD RIP ENGLISH VER. NO SUBS.

Godzilla taps into his gentle, nurturing side after he adopts an orphaned lizard, Minilla, who rose from 
the ashes of a failed scientific experiment. Minilla is such an innocent, however, that Godzilla has to 
work overtime to protect him from marauding hybrid insects that have ballooned to gargantuan proportions. The 
most dangerous of them all is a mutant spider known simply as Kumonga, who's hell-bent on total destruction.
