,Mcspiffles,2011-06-11T14:34Z,"It is indeed. The Day The Earth Stopped is made by the Asylum, which is widely known for capitalizing on big-company promotions with cheap knock-offs of their films. Using a trivial budget, they throw together their 'stolen' movies in a few months, and have been known to get them out around the same time as the real movie. They take the claim of 'inspiration', even though almost all of their titles are ripped off from bigger company films.

20th Century Fox actually threatened legal action against The Asylum for their rip off of The Day the Earth Stood Still, but never followed through with the law suite.

For The Asylum's cheap movies, this one actually isn't that bad (and they do get pretty bad). The quality of the movie is pretty good, both audio and video, so it's a trustworthy torrent."
