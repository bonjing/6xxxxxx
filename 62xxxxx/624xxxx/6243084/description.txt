Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck\'s web site. I have edited out the music played during the commercial breaks.

*yawn*stretch*...  huh?  what?  we\'re back already?  ok!  sorry today\'s show is a bit late, had some tech difficulties.  Show is up now and complete, any pops/skips you hear (especially in hour 2) are from the broadcast as I received it.  good to be back!
