Being a hardcore Walking Dead fan, when reading these comics in the .cbr files, I saw several pages that I enjoyed the art so much I wanted to print out some for the art alone. So what I have done is uncompiled the .cbr files back into the original .jpeg scans used to make up the .cbr files. I thought other fans of this series may want to do the same so I'm sharing them here. I also included the original .cbr files for hose who may have an incomplete collection.

Enjoy and please seed.
