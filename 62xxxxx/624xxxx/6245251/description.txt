I bring to you the OST from Namco's latest installment from the Tekken franchise-Tekken 6!

Now as much as this game stressed me and probably most of you out, ontop of the awkward scenario campaign, a big postive plus was the soundtrack that came with it that made you want to boogie while doing a mean Steve Fox combo.

As with all my OST's this is the complete kit and kaboodle, no missing songs here=]

Sooo please seed, leech, comment and enjoy=]
