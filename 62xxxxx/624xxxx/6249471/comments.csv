Will this copy need to be registered after 60 days, or is a key included?"
,bert16,2011-03-28T19:39Z,"It installed OK on my desktop, but when I tried to install it on the laptop, it said ""Licensing Initialization Error OxC004D301."" Is anyone else having this problem?"
,traderphil,2011-04-02T05:35Z,"This installed just fine on my laptop, and no key was required.

Thanks again webchella"
,ahmedam,2011-04-09T12:56Z,"Is this product full with crack ?
or no need for crack ?"
,mightyh,2011-04-21T17:20Z,"It worked perfectly. I burned the ISO image in a DVD and installed from there. Registration was automatic, I did not have to do anything. Thanks a lot webchella...keep up the good work!"
,Newb787,2011-06-06T02:09Z,60 day evaluation then it goes tits up. u can save yourself some time and download this directly from microsoft's website.
,mylarkee,2011-07-07T03:21Z,"This is a good download that installs good. The splash window says it's licensed to me. But in the help menu the ""Register Online"" selection is still there, also there is on mention of any time limit on this download. I went through the ""Register Online"" procedure. I was not kicked out, but I still see ""Register Online"" on the help menu. So, I don't know and I suppose it's anybody's guess...I will just wait and see. ;)"
