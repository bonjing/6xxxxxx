
The Oxford Guide to English Usage is an essential theme-by-theme guide to correct written and spoken English. Its unique organization by subject gives a complete overview of English usage, providing full advice on both rules and exceptions. Now thoroughly revised to incorporate the latest spelling, pronunciation, and usage information from Oxford's most up-to-date dictionaries, the Guide illustrates points of usage with quotations from real authors, from Virginia Woolf to David Lodge.
