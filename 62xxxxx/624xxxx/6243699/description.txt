Oklahomaphobia EP (2010) and a bunch of old stuff from 2004, 2007, and 2009.  Several Sockeye covers, a Ween cover (Mr. Would You Please Help My Pony).  Songs about Bigfoot, Oklahoma, Stem Cell Soup, Ginger Girls, and other important topics.

This is a completely legal torrent, created by The Powerhead Kids.  We believe in free music.  Sharing can only help the small bands get noticed, and it might hurt the big corporate bands but, so what?  Fuck em.  They mostly suck ass anyway.
