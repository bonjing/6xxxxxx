I will put a flash version of this mp3 with a slidewhow of some pictures on youtube tonight sometime."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-17T00:19Z,"I am supporting several torrents here....none of them which I am attempting to seed will seed. I have been able to ul close to 400 dls on one torrent now but it takes forever, forever. My speed in uTorrent is .2 kb.
I know enouhg to know that something is wrong. I have numerous trackers available in the torrents. It shows peers. I can dl other torrents at 300-600 kb and upload while dl those torrents. And yet just these very small torrents take hours to seed. And I am the only one seeding a torrent now which 400 people have dl. I assume that may be because others are having the same problems. My router is being flooded ever few seconds with hundreds of request through my upnpn opening and yet only a handful of actual dlrs. And no will respond in these.
I hope somehow these stay to document this."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-17T01:13Z,"Thank you for DL this, very much.
I like this as I said at least for now. Thx"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-17T08:38Z,I am actually for the very first time seeing uTorrent successfully UL in this torrent alone.
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-17T21:27Z,"And again, for others who are supporting these other than myself, I have no idea who you or or why. I am grateful. And always will be."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-19T14:06Z,I am in the process of moving my stuff from my laptop to my desktop...so I can return the laptop...cause I can no longer afford it. I have been continously flooded beyond what was happening before and have have had little access to the net today. I will support a few of these in seeds soon. Thx in advance for waiting and I'll get here later this sat afternoon for u...thx again.
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-20T23:36Z,"Again I have now been attempting 2 seed this 4 2 days now. I don't even c a seeder here?
I have been knocked off the net repeatedly over the last few days. I can barely get oin the net these days..and Microsoft spaces does not show any progress in my ul this 17 mb file to my Skydrive. And my Blog has now lost access to my Picassa Web Album, which is present bu Goggle fro somereason reports its own Google Picasa as not shoing my account..which is the account hosting my google Blog?"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-21T00:37Z,"Thx, you have no idea how greatful for anyone to pay any attention in this. I recognize in what I record...how much better it was in a time cannot remember. But it is coming back little by little. I dreamt of playing a Grand all night last night. And when I got up this morning...it is getting better...and I am enjoying the hell out of it now. I have ul about 9 mb of this succesfully and have now got it on Skydrive after 2 days. it is linked on my blog under Piano for anyone who wants a quicker link. My Blog shows to me visiting links from their previous ril, but does not show the ip to me of who is visiting. I always used to consider that in following links from TPB."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-23T10:15Z,"Thank you again in so very much in dl and listening to these...maybe not in what anyone does in these things to resolve any of this...but maybe in these...when I play I play what I felt when Eddie, and if you can feel that...than that is more important to me than anything...and in this is a relief to me. It does not tear at em the the words do in trying so very hard to reach out...in this music...I can reach out. Thank you. I hope I continue to get better at this. I enjoy it and your listening makes me feel better. thx"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-25T23:30Z,I see you here as a leecher...I guess that means you may be attempting to DL. Thank you. good Luck in the dl...it takes a while.
