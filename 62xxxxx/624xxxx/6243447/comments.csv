,baybeh,2011-11-14T10:14Z,"Terrible. Took ages to download and most of the files don't play properly. Both the video and audio are choppy, as if in slo-mo. Some of the extra's which may have been ripped differently do play ok, but 90% of the package doesn't. This uploader's fucked up. Don't download."
,baybeh,2011-11-14T10:15Z,And I have a high-powered computer. It's not my comp that has a problem.
