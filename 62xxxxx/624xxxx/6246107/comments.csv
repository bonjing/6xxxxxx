[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T02:01Z,"If its new to bluray and is of this year I'll probably do it as long as it doesn't look completely retard.  There isn't any reason to request most things.  Most requests simply ignored, if your request was processed it was likely on my list to do anyhow or fit the criteria above."
