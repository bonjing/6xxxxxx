,fang3claw,2011-04-05T22:05Z,"Ok this is just slightly ridiculous. I am the only one seeding this torrent. Of nearly 300 peers? The available ratio of the torrent is .986, which gives me the 98.6 percent download that I have and have been on for 3 hole days. Little Tip if you guys want me to continue seeding after an uploaded ratio of 1. Seed while you peer. Don't wait until you have the entire torrent. "
,david4311,2011-04-05T22:51Z,There is 50 ppl with 98.6% with 240MB left to 100%. Dunno who seeds this torrent anymore (max i saw was 0 (6) at Seed).
,Ble_eP,2011-04-06T02:45Z,"Almost there! Dady just need another 1.4%, then it's seeding time. Hope my computer isn't too angry at me for leaving it on for a week."
,darksosis,2011-04-06T10:51Z,ok ffs! what kind of person just create the torrent and leave it ...there is not any seeder all peers are just downloading instead of uploading for 17.5 gb I had uploaded 79gb in 4 day and still stuck at %98.6 so what now ...no1 shares no1 seeds...the real question is where the hell are u reece...?
,Collun,2011-04-06T15:24Z,"Seeds 0 (0)

,curlyqu,2011-06-04T14:46Z,"People of PirateBay, this torrent was created by ME originally on demonoid. Go to demonoid and search for this torrent to see. Also there are more precise instructions in the comments. I post them per page of comments so they are always there.

On the first page of comments...

""What DLC have i missed?""

""Yeah, swear i put it in...
Ah well..
All the DLC is in there...""

No reece, you didn't put it in. I did. If by some chance a MOD reads this, please remove this torrent. Thank you."
,zasadar,2011-06-09T03:23Z,wow TY  is this the latest version too?
,rauno595,2011-06-09T10:43Z,"Wanna install the DLC?

Install origins and awakening, update to 1.04.

Then go to the game folder, enter bin_ships.

In there you will find lots of stuff but you need daoupdater.exe

After that just navigate to the DLC folder and select the dazips one by one... would go faster if all this crap was in one folder not each in a seperate one but whatever. After that click on the first dazip in the updater list, scroll down to the last one and shift+click it(Hold down shift while clicking, for the more... uhh. Mentally challenged ones.). then choose install selected."
,0belisk,2011-07-03T01:49Z,So I download it and can't install all the Campaigns. Anyone knows how to install this completely?
,Dark-Fox,2011-07-04T13:11Z,"Installation

,Stianwc,2011-07-25T00:49Z,"okey guys,
1. unpack

2. mount with daemen tools, u must download it, and if you dont know how to mount youtube it.

3. install

4. move the files from the fake cd that u created with daemen tools to C: Program files

5. Play the game"
,Stianwc,2011-07-25T00:50Z,seed! sorry for double post
,CakeMonster,2011-07-30T17:47Z,"This is how you install DLC

You need to run DAUPDATER located in the Dragon age origins folder sub folder bin-ship

You double click the program “daupdater” no need to run as admin, then a window opens, then you look down in that window and click the button called Selectt Dazip then you go to the dlc folder in this downloaded torrent and each file, this will take a very long time.

And the torrent itself and all the files work perfectly if you follow the read me instructions and do what I have just written"

,j1s91,2012-04-15T03:10Z,"Hello! First off, this seems to be a great torrent and I'm seeding it at night! 

Now, for the reason why I'm commenting. I'm having a pretty small, but annoying problem. I'm at the last step, replacing the original ""daorigins"" with the cracked version. I can't seem to find the original file. I know it's supposed to be placed at ""C//Program.Files//Dragon.Age//"", but it's not there. The only file there (except for the folders) is ""DAOriginsLauncher"". I've tried replacing DAOriginsLauncher with ""daorigins"", but that leads me to an error. 

So, my question is: am I trying to put the crack in the wrong place, or did I do something wrong in the process?

Ps: I've followed the instructions, and done EXACTLY as it says. Re-installed 3 times, no changes. (I installed DAO, DAO-A, Patch, fixed DLC).

I would LOVE a giving answer, thanks!! :)"
,j1s91,2012-04-15T03:21Z,"...Forget my earlier post! In any case, if anyone is as retarded as me:

You need to place the CRACK inside C//Program files//Dragon Age//bin_ship, where the original ""daorigins""-file is located.

Jesus, I feel so stupid. Great torrent though, creds for upload - I will keep seeding!"
,sporeboy,2012-04-15T23:44Z,"how do i install DLC? the readme does not tell me HOW all it says is just ""install DLC"""
,sporeboy,2012-04-15T23:45Z,"and i cant find the reauiresauthorisation stuff seriously, add a youtube guide to show us HOW to install this instead of writing text that leaves out detail"
,nread2010,2012-04-16T00:10Z,"To install DLC search your computer for ""daupdater"" no quotes. Run the DAuploader. Now hit 'select file' (or whatever it say's) on the dauploader and find the Downloadable content folder that came with the torrent. Start selecting the .dazip files that you want to install and then install them. So in short, you install DLC (and Mods) with the dauploader.exe. The RequiresAuthorization text in the addins.xml file won't show up until the DLC is installed, it will just look like another language until you install the DLC. You will have to change RequiresAuthorization=""1"" to RequiresAuthorization=""0"" 22 times in the file. Good luck"
,nread2010,2012-04-16T00:12Z,And after it's all said and done make sure you put the daorigns.exe crack file (located in the crack folder in the torrent) in the Dragon Age/bin_ship folder and then create a short cut on your desktop.
