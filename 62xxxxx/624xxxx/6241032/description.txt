I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THE FILES THEMSELVES. I do however take credit for bringing all of these files together; for renaming them and organizing them; and for the text files. :)

Let's go over what's in this insane package.

First up we have the core game, Dragon Age: Origins.
Next we have the expansion, Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening.

So those are the base of the Dragon Age experience, but what about all that juicy DLC?

And if that wasn't convincing enough, this next bit of info should do the trick.

	* Offical Prima guides for both Origins and Awakening!
	* High quality maps of Ferelden and Thedas!
	* Official Collector's Edition bonus disc filled with tons of extras!
	* The official soundtracks for Origins, Awakening, and the DLC campaign 	'Leliana's Song'!

I realize the size of this torrent will turn many away but I assure you it is well worth your download speeds. (Assuming you don't already own most of what's in this torrent.)
Huge thanks to the many people involved with the files included in this torrent.
Have fun!
