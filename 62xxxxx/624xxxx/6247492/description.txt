Twilight Zone fans including myself figured out 
the ending of this fun story early on.  
I won't give it away here, except to say that this has 
elements of "The Monsters are Due on Maple Street" 
and "Stopover in a Quiet Town" combined. :) 

Mary Crosby guest starred a few years after she 
shot J.R. and left DALLAS.
