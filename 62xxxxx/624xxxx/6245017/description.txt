                       SHOCKER: NO MORE MR. NICE GUY (1989)
                       ------------------------------------

Wes Craven's Finest To Date.

This one is his best, apart from his other gem, The Serpent And The Rainbow.

In this one, Mitch Pileggi plays his most famous and iconic role, the psychopath Horace Pinker: TV repairman by day, serial killer and practitioner of the occult arts at night.

Our hero in this film is played by the excellent Peter Berg.

Plot: One day Jonathan (Peter Berg) has a dream in which he witnesses his family being slaughtered by a maniac. Having seen Pinker's TV repair-van
in his dreams, he now tells his father, detective Lt. Don Parker (Michael Murphy) where to find Pinker, but under one condition: that he accompany his father on his mission to capture Pinker... 

But Pinker is not the easy prey that they think.
