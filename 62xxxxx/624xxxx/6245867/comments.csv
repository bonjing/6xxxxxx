,azisco,2011-03-20T15:30Z,"This is German only? That seems like something that should be put in the title. Or description, for that matter."
,azisco,2011-03-21T01:04Z,"Perfect! Averaged 1.1 MB/s dl and the game works almost perfectly with the packed in Skidrow crack.

The only issue I've encountered after playing a couple hours was one massive graphical glitch when I first started the game, but it was fixed when I changed the video settings. Probably just a load error.

Great torrent overall. Thanks!"
,azisco,2011-03-21T01:05Z,"Gah, disregard the above comment. I just realized this is the wrong AC:B torrent. This is embarrassing..."
,Overlordhavoc,2011-03-21T19:10Z,"When i load the game i get a graphics glitch where in the loading screen Ezio is transparant.

In the game movies i can see only eyes and when the level loads i just get half a player and a scrambled world... 

Looks like a serious graphics glitch but i have an ATI HD5850 graphics card with the latest drivers installed... 

Anyone else had this? Fixes? Ideas?"
