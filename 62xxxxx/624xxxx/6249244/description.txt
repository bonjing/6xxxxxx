Warning: This is a BIG file. It has the screen captures and auto quality of that you would expect on Lynda.com, but not of  the movies have been compressed to distort their viewing quality.  The Example Files alone was 1.3 Gb. I will seed this exclusively of other uploaded for a few days and indefinitely after that at a reduced rate., and then it will be up to you guys to sustain it.

PLEASE, PLEASE share with you fellow downloaders to make this go as fast as possible...

The training is awesome, I never knew what Aperture was until I watched this training, it's almost as powerful as Photoshop Bridge is to photoshop with major differences in color control. I never really understood why there were so many controls when I was just using it a a photo repository.
