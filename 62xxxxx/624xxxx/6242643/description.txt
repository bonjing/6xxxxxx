From the makers of Farenheit comes Heavy Rain, a game I believe should of been Game of The Year 2010, another great exclusive from the PS3.

Now with this unique, multiple ending masterpiece was an emotional filled soundtrack that instantly listens to it brings back memories of the game and trying to find out who the Origami Killer is.

As with all my soundtracks, I have compressed them with 7zip so it makes it a much smaller file to download which will require 7zip to extract them.

The list of songs on this OST can be found here
