DIVX DVD RIP ENGLISH VER. NO SUBS.

The heroic Godzilla faces off against an environmentally deadly monster called Hedorah, who apparently 
originated from a meteor that fell to the Earth and then metamorphosed into a creature so toxic it has the capacity 
to destroy the entire planet. But Godzilla won\'t let anything like that happen to the only land he knows as 
home. Yoshimitsu Banno directs this rare film.
