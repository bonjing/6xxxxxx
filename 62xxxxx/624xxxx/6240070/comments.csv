,nittany,2011-03-13T21:17Z,I hope this doesn't have any hard coded korean subs like some of the other releases.  Doesn't say anything about hard coded subs in the info above so let's hope.
,califazer,2011-03-13T22:30Z,"The subs are blurred out, hence the title of the torrent having 'BLURRED' in it. Otherwise, a great copy of a horrible movie :)"
,MarsLulrich,2011-03-14T02:56Z,horrible google translated english subs.

Yeah, just started watching the movie and it's all blurred on the bottom.  I thought the ""blurred"" in the torrent name was the release group or some other shit.  

I figured if this movie had hard coded subs and they were blurred throughout the entire movie, the releaser would have put something in the info above...guess not."

,dlarrym1111,2011-03-17T20:54Z,"I'd rather have the subs then someone using that LAME software that doesn't truly do anything to remove hard coded subs. As anyone who wasted bandwidth to download this can see, it blurs the subs out. Sadly, it doesn't discriminate between the picture and the lettering. Also the blurred area is ALWAYS there, even if there is an action sequence that didn't have subs for those few minutes. NO MOVIE has subs that are there every second of the film. But now, there is a blurred area for the every second of the film. If it only went blurry when subs appeared, I might have a different opinion about all this.

I wish it had been uploaded as is. If I, want to go and use that software on my personal copy that I got from the download, then I would have that choice. subs, even if I can't read them is a million times better then having the area, like on this copy, being blurred out for the ENTIRE movie!!!

Anyway. . . . 

It would have been nice to leave any modifying like that up to the person on the receiving end.  Personally I would NEVER use that software on ANY movie, for all the above reasons it creates.

I know someone is going to call me an ingrate, However, I DO appreciate any up-loaders efforts, but I don't think its wrong to comment on my reasons that I found it unwatchable.

Save the blurred area, the movie is really good quality, V9/A7.

 Besides, .BONE. probably was NOT the person that did the blurring. It may have come to him from yet another source already that way. Some may not have any issue with the blurred area, so he did right by putting it out here for anyone to upload it if they want to

.BONE. is definitely a trusted and awesome up-loader and TPB member.

peace all.!

Maybe others will read this and may or may not agree with me, but at least I was honest. I wasn't speaking ugly about the up-loader either, I just thought that this mod to the movie was something that DIDN'T improve it."
