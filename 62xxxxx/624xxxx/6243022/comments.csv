[V],Murlok,2011-03-15T17:41Z,"rupankur  if you bother to open ,nfo you will see it"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-03-15T18:51Z,"When running the .nfo I got some weird screen. So I tried to open the .nfo with Notepad and it worked !!!

If I was not so smart with computers I would never found out what the f*ck the .nfo thing is about.

Now I know why in the past I could never find keys and instructions, cause I used to delete .nfo files.


....... lulz .. :D ...... Cheerz m8. :)"
[V],Murlok,2011-03-16T20:02Z,RobbingHood  Hehe you should get yourself the program for making .nfofiles.Its hard to find but you can always ask me.Its 2 of them I got only one working with win7 x64 :)
,ragman420,2011-03-17T02:55Z,I've always just renamed nfo extensions as txt then deleted all the useless irritating ASCII pictures  that get in the way of reading the actual useful information.
[V],RobbingHood,2011-03-17T15:29Z,"@Murlok 

There's even a program to make .nfo files ?? Wow, that awesome !! 
I guess it must be a very large and heavy program, like Adobe CS5.

Well, first I'll try if I can make an .nfo file from a text file by changing the extension. Maybe the created .nfo file can even be opened with Notepad and saved as .txt file !

If it works then I'll spread the message around the world ..... ^_^"
[V],Murlok,2011-03-18T13:50Z,"RobbingHood  that will not work!,nfo are a very small prg only 2.773 kb :)"

,Kamidora,2011-05-25T14:23Z,"Murlok

It appears Print Creations is beyond the capabilities of the crackers or just not important enough..

Can we respectfully ask for Arcsoft Print creations, if possible.

Thanking you in advance"
,zchamp,2011-05-25T21:25Z,says .nfo corrupted.
