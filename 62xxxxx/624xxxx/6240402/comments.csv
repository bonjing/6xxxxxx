BATTLE ((OF)) LOS ANGELES

thanks for the upload because i myself wanted to check this one out.
but for the people who will just give the uploader grief because they think this is another movie this is a heads up.

THIS IS NOT BATTLE: LA the high budget movie
THIS IS BATTLE LOS ANGELES a syfy movie"
,scottyjay94,2011-03-13T19:55Z,otherwise its a 10/10 av for a tv B movie
,druzhnik,2011-03-13T19:57Z,HDTVRip? impossible
,chedderz66,2011-03-13T19:59Z,Not the movie currently playing at theaters. That one is Battle: Los Angeles. This torrent is some cheesy SYFY network movie called Battle OF Los Angeles. Watched some of it on SYFY channel. Boring and lame effects. 
[T],extremezone,2011-03-13T20:06Z,"yes it's a syfy b movie  , i hope in about 1-2 month we will get a good quality of the original Battle: Los Angeles (2011)"
,chedderz66,2011-03-14T02:17Z,Haha all you schmucks downloading this thinking you're getting Battle: Los Angeles   
,djxeroic,2011-03-14T03:25Z,Those dirty motherfuckers at The Asylum are at it again!!!
,killer9785,2011-03-14T04:50Z,1.3 rating on imdb and they dont rate that harshly too. Defiantly not worth the download.
,tmankeny,2011-03-14T07:07Z,"You fellas must be knew.  extreme always uploads the B movies.  click on his name and he has it all. He also uploads A movies but i think he gets more of a kick from the B movies.  i know i find the shroud of names funny and love the comments it produces. especially from the ones that realize what they downloaded and the fact they state their obvious lack of tact and attention to detail. 

thanks again extreme.  keep the Bs coming!!!!"
,tmankeny,2011-03-14T07:16Z,you fellas must be new.  extreme has all the B movies.  he loads A movies as well but i think he gets more of kick from the comments by the less tactful when they realize what they have downloaded and then they post their obvious inability to detail. 
,goatmanilla,2011-03-14T07:47Z,"Downloading and watching this just because Kel Mitchell stars in it.  (from Keenan and Kel)

Battle: LA is probably the sickest movie I have ever seen, and i've seen just about every thriller/syfy/action/justbadfuckingass movie ever.

This just can't compare.
Nice try though.

Hit me up when you get B:LA.

,odishion,2011-03-15T20:48Z,Hey.. I love these odd syfy channel versions of Sci-Fi. As long as they keep to SF it's worth looking at it. Sadly they are F*d up with all their interesting shows cancellations.

,DarthExile,2011-03-16T13:05Z,the topic of the movie is cool makes you think about our drone army and how the elite are going to trick us into thinking its aliens   its 2011 so how come the soldiers in iraq dont have drones and instead risk there lifes are the elite just buying there own drne armys like in terminator 3 i think so
,thepenguinator,2011-03-16T21:16Z,"@jefhongo nothing fake about this one, totally valid upload and detailed description leaves no room for doubt. If someone mistakes this for Battle: LA then it's completely due to his own fault, not the uploader"
