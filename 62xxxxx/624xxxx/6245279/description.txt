With the release of Yakuza 4 upon us, I thought I would share with you the OST from last year's game Ryu ga Gotoku 3..well spotted eagle eyed downloaders that's the japanese name for Yakuza 3 and as you can probably tell by the title this is a rip from the japanese soundtrack.

Don't let that put you off as it is quite an amazing soundtrack with some epic songs that bring back memories of swinging a thug into a wall otherwise i'll send Mr.Kazuma round for a visit=P

Please seed(so people can download it faster), leech, comment and enjoy=]
