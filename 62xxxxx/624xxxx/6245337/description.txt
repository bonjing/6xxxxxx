     SUMMARY:
              Ever since the earliest missionaries and explorers
              returned from Africa, stories have been told of
              strange water-dwelling monsters living in the Congo
              Basin. The native Pygmy tribes speak of the
              Mokele-mbembe, an animal with a long, thin neck and a
              body the size of an elephant that seems to resemble a
              sauropod dinosaur. Could there be a population of
              dinosaurs living in the remote jungle? Read more:
