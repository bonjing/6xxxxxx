Partisan groups under charismatic leaders wage a desperate battle in this story of guerrilla warfare set in Napoleonic Spain. The hero of The Gun is the gun itself, a massive 18 pounder that is dragged across the mountains and plains of Spain - an epic task. Throughout the story, the gun changes the lives of those who fight each other to the death in order to gain control of it.
