Is your version of Kontakt a buggy mess? Does it freeze at the end of updating the database (4.0 series)? Or does it freeze when you try to load your instruments, making it for all intents and purposes useless (4.1 series)? No more! The proud 4.2 series is here! The bugs of the previous Kontakt 4 versions have been fixed. The instruments load (a major fix,) and the program doesn't freeze when you rescan the instrument library (a lesser fix, but still important.) Now you can load all the newest instruments, and if you have support for 64-bit VSTs, you can take advantage of the x64 plugin. (32-bit plugin also included, natch.)
