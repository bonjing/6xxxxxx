,mrporton,2011-03-16T09:35Z,Thanks for this. I'm curious to know why the size is so big? The size of the original Team ASSiGN release is only 469MB

[T],theLEAK,2011-04-21T23:48Z,How to open this in Reason 5 and SONY ACID Pro 7? Please help. Reply ASAP. Thanks
,wibble00,2011-04-25T02:58Z,"Hmm... Installs okay, but is still time-limited ""Demo mode""...

I installed the standalone only (Not VSTi or RTAS add-ons)

Any idea how to solve this?

Cheers,

Wibble00"
,dyrgutt,2011-05-18T02:18Z,"Installed fine - though the 64bit VST, is not the 64bit VST?!  When you check the file against the 32bit version, they are exactly the same; hence, it runs bridged.  'So what's up there team'?  Thanks for the UP though, but i recommend to those wanting 64bit functionality - wait until someone releases 4.2.3. cheers all"

This is not a instrument for Reason (because Reason is a closed DAW), in acid pro you can add a new VSTi from settings..."
,pawnone,2011-06-12T08:19Z,noob question but how does this .bin and .cue need to be mounted my computer tries to open it with VLC media player
,pawnone,2011-06-12T08:22Z,forgot to mention i am using windows XP
,lilnemo_music,2011-07-02T08:48Z,"Hey guy this actually does work. Thanks gyaradon.

My only question is, on the install, how can I link it to Cubase so i can open it up there. I tried putting the 32-bit and the 64-bit VST-plugin location to the VSTpludin folder in Cubase. but still its a no go. 

Thank you ahead of time. Would appreciate some help anyone."
,lilnemo_music,2011-07-02T08:51Z,"pawnone... to answer your question. 

1..mount it on PowerISO (make a virtual disks so that your computer thinks it has a disk from the file.)

2. Go to my computers and a CD should pop-up

3. Install

hope this helps"
