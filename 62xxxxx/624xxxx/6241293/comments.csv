Destruction is all islam is about, just read this Qurâ€™an 9:88 â€œThe Messenger and those who
believe with him, strive hard and fight with their wealth and lives in Allahâ€™s Cause.â€ Qurâ€™an 9:5
â€œFight and kill the disbelievers wherever you find them, take them captive, torture them,
lie in wait and ambush them using every stratagem of war.â€ Qurâ€™an 9:112 â€œThe Believers fight
in Allahâ€™s Cause, they slay and are slain, kill and are killed.â€ Qurâ€™an 9:29 â€œFight those who do
not believe until they all surrender, paying the protective tax in submission.â€"

Jesus.Their accounts are purposefully convoluted and ripped out of context. Without the inclusion of Bible characters and stories, the Qur’an and Hadith
would be very thin on spirituality.We would be left with little more than temper
tantrums, threats, and terror. No one would confuse it for a religion."

This is excused by this paraphrase, ""If I find something that is better than what was, I will take the latter.""

If all the radical muslims were to completely vanish, within a generation there would be another crop of them.  It's just the way the koran is written."
