Lo-Pro is an American five-piece hard rock band. They released a self-titled album in 2003. However, after touring in support of the album, they were dropped from the Geffen record label. The band then spent years working on new material, and streaming many new songs on their Myspace. Eventually they released the Letting Go EP on July 14, 2009 while on the "Stimulate This" tour and later digitally on October 21, 2009. In early 2010 the band finished a second LP tentatively titled The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge, originally to be released on May 25, 2010,[2] but delayed two weeks and released on June 8, 2010.[3] The band is currently working on finalizing an often mentioned acoustic album, to be released in early 2011.
