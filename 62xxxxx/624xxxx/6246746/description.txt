THIS IS ONLY FOR MAC.

This is the complete patches for WoW from 3.0.1 - 3.3.5a.
If you want the uploader go to: 





To play join a private server. All the private servers run on 3.3.5a(all I know of).
The server I use is   molten-wow.com. It really fast and there are tons of players.
When you log in log in with the account you made on the website. To do this you have to change the realmlist.wtf(WTF!!!(lol)). To do this replace:

set realmlist us.logon.worldofwarcraft.com

with

set realmlist logon.molten-wow.com

(or whatever the server you sign up on says to do)
