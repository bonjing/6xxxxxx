Ive purchased all 3 Ott albums after I ""previewed"" them from Piratebay ;)

Awesome tunes by the way , OTT fans will not be disappointed. "
,manwithname,2011-05-12T23:54Z,"I may sound like an echo, but it's of great importance that Ott get payed for his work. At least for me. Cause if he stops making music I don't know what to do!!"
,poparanoya,2011-06-13T22:56Z,"Awsome that he's done a new album.
