Austrian movie "Freispiel" form 1995, directed by Harald Sicheritz - For all those who also couldn't find it anywhere, particularly the expat community.

After Indien and Muttertag, the third in the very popular row of "Cabaret-films" of the 90ies. It's about the life of softie music teacher Robert Brenneis, who holds the whole world responsible for his own failure (not to become a rock-star etc.). After a sereis of crisis at work, at home etc. he finally discovers that the biggest obstacle might be himself.

Shows parts of the "Fremd"-programme of Alfred Dorfer, particularly the Song "dahoam".

Highly amusing dialogues who partly found their way into everyday Austrian language.

Audio: German
