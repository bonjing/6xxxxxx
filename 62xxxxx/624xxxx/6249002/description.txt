This package contains Rosetta Stone Version 3

CorkScrews are prepackaged wine prefixes inspired by the "Wine bottle" of
Crossover (cxgames.). This package was built using ArchLinux and also 
tested on Ubuntu 10.04, it should work properly on any Linux distribution
 with wine properly installed.

To install the game run rs_installer.sh. This will extract the archive 
to ~/.wine/wineprefixes/RosettaStone. 

This package only contains the main rosetta stone application.
You will need to install at least one language for this to be useful.

To install a language, mount the iso or CD to /media/cdrom, then run 
~/bin/RosettaStone, and add the language as normal.

If you do not mount the CD to /media/cdrom it will not be detected.

You can find language packs on your favorite torrent site, I personally
tested this one: 
http://bitsnoop.com/rosetta-stone-v-3-swedish-level-1-3-q911554.html

If you don't know how to mount an ISO here is an example:
sudo mount -o loop /path/to/somelanguage.iso /media/cdrom

To launch the application execute the script located in ~/bin, either by double 
clicking on it, or from a terminal enter: "~/bin/RosettaStone" (case 
sensative). 

I reccomend adding $HOME/bin to your PATH, especially if you 
want to use more then one corkscrew. 
A desktop launcher is not included with this release, but you can easily make one 
yourself using the included icon.

To uninstall delete the RosettaStone folder in ~/.wine/wineprefixes.

I encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other applications 
and games. This package along with the installer can be freely redistributed 
and/or modified only by qualified software pirates. If you are happy to see a game 
or program you like running on linux be sure to let the developers know. 

For other packages just search "CorkScrew" on your favorite torrenting site.
