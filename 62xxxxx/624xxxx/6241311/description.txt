Leadfoot
Take A Look (1999)


Based in Raleigh, NC, Leadfoot is a southern-influenced hard rock/heavy metal band that includes two ex-members of the influential thrash metal/hardcore punk outfit Corrosion of Conformity (COC): singer Karl Agell and bassist Phil Swisher. COC has been through its share of personnel changes over the years, and some of them took place in 1993, when Agell had a falling out with other members of COC and was fired. Swisher left COC as well that year, and the two of them soon formed Leadfoot. A major departure from the thrash metal and hardcore punk that COC is known for, Leadfoot has favored a much slower, groove-oriented, gritty style of heavy metal/hard rock that often underscores its fondness of southern rock. Leadfoot's first album came in 1997, when Roadrunner released Bring It On in Europe. The band ended up signing with The Music Cartel, which put Bring It On out in the U.S. and released its second album, Take A Look, in 1999. Like COC, Leadfoot has gone through its share of personnel changes; in 1999, Leadfoot's lineup included Agell, Swisher, drummer Tim Haisman and guitarists Graham Fry and Scott Little.
