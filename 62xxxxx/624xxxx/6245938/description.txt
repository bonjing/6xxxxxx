Notes

First working english release wins .. there is no need to dupe every
release with one from a different region. There are no region locks.
And yes, also games bought in the USA can be multi and played on Euro
consoles (and vice versa
Therefore we don't tag our releases with a source region, and we encourage
other groups to do the same and siteops to deny such useless dupes and
adjust rules

Enjoy This Fine DUPLEX Release
