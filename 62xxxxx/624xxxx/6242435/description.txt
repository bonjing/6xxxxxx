Dario Argento's Greatest Horror Film To Date

Suspiria is the greatest horror film and a true masterpiece made by Dario Argento. As a big horror movies fan, this is my favorite Argento film and it is much better than Phenomena, Inferno and Tenebre.

With great special effects and a great background score by the Goblins.

The film is about one of the three mothers (Witches) who is called Suspiria or 'the mother of sighs'. Susie Bannion (played by Jessica Harper) arrives at a ballet school in Germany to perfect herself. There she is welcomed by the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett). She befriends Sara (Stefania Casini) who tells her about a friend of hers who had vanished without trace and who believed that the school was actually a coven for witches and the only one who knew of a secret entrance to the coven. When Sara disappears mysteriously, Susie begins to investigate the rumour of The Black Queen who had previously been the owner of the school.
