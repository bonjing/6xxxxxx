,mini1guy,2011-03-30T13:35Z,"Hey everyone, I have a very important announcement,
apparently the guy who made the original dragon ball z kai is plagiarizing dragon ball z, now from what i read they are going to stop production of the dragon ball z kai series, ending with the Japanese episode 97, but I don't know if they will keep dubbing episodes into English or not."
,klown3plus1,2011-04-11T02:56Z,are these episodes cut or the uncut versions? thanks
