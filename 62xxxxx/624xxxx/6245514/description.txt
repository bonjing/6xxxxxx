IMDB Info

When a massive power outage plunges the city of Detroit into total darkness, a disparate group of individuals 
find themselves alone. The entire city's population has vanished into thin air, leaving behind heaps of empty 
clothing, abandoned cars and lengthening shadows. Soon the daylight begins to disappear completely, and as the 

survivors gather in an abandoned tavern, they realize the darkness is out to get them, and only their rapidly 
diminishing light sources can keep them safe.
