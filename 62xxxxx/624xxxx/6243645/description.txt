It's 1999, and the United Nations has established a base off the coast of Japan to study the huge monsters stomping Tokyo. But when an evil band of women from the Moon try to conquer Earth, the monsters must be freed so they can defend the planet. Astronaut Katsuo Yemabe (Akira Kubo) and his crew accomplish this dangerous mission, and now, it's an epic showdown as Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan and their pals put the smack down on the alien invaders.
