,ganstacrizzab255,2011-07-23T07:02Z,"Alright. This is not what the description made it sound like, so let me go ahead and clarify two things:

1) OST stands for Original Sound Track, emphasis on the Original part, because when that gets printed on something, they're not kidding. Original literally means it's the original soundtrack that plays during the scenes of the movie/game, completely unchanged from how they are heard in the movie/game. If the selections from the soundtrack have been arranged in any way, remixed, or in the case of video games, their MIDI sheets ran through a more sophisticated synthesizer, it's no longer an OST. It's an Arranged Soundtrack.

2) Remastered means just that. It means that it's still the same work, but it's been cleaned up or the quality has been bumped up. When you remaster an old film, you don't re-cut it or add different selections of a scene, you just clean up the film. You go in and remove film grain, clean up areas where they forgot to check the gate for dust/hair, removed black lines around objects in composited shots, etc. When you remaster audio, you don't re-record the audio, you just clean it up. You increase or decrease the room tone, remove static, etc.

This soundtrack is an arrangement of the OST, using completely different themes that don't sound anything like they did in the game. That means it's neither OST nor is it remastered. It's just an arranged soundtrack, one of many for FFVII. DOUBLE FAIL. So you might want to change the description and not waste anybody else's time who just wants the OST."
