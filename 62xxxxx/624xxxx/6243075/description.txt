Perhaps one of the greatest Playstation games of all time, if not the greatest RPG of all time second only to Chrono Trigger is Final Fantasy VII, a game with a great story, great characters and amazing music.

So what sdobson87 incorporated brings to you(hey it might catch on) is the remastered 4 disc OST from Final Fantasy VII, the songs are still the same but they just sound better, more remastered=P

Please note you will need 7zip to extract it=]

Seed, leech, comment and enjoy=]
