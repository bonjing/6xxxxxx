,videox,2011-03-16T03:40Z,"@randyandi: If you like more quality, then go search some FLAC. The whole discography is not in FLAC nor 320 kbps (which is lossy, not lossless).

Besides, you can't even distinguish the loss of quality between 128 and 320. Again, if you are an audiophile, then go buy some LPs."

You're welcome. Enjoy."
