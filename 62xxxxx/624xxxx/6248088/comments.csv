,dario7000,2011-04-01T07:31Z,"I download the software with no problem, i install it step by step how you write in the instructions, but when i try to run the patch seem like if the patch do not recognize the file, Any suggestion? "
,claynelson,2011-04-07T14:49Z,im not seeing the lic file or the patch all i get is the rar files and unpack them to get a bin and cue file.  help would be greatly appreciated.  thanks
,chmod777,2011-04-08T05:44Z,"Instructions are wrong, refers to patch.exe which does not exist.
HS-AD10.exe does exist, but seems to do nothing.
Included license file HS-AD10.alf does not load.
And there is no way to activate.

Basically, this entire thing is useless!

Maybe Altium uploaded this torrent themselves just to frustrate??"
,claynelson,2011-04-08T05:46Z,found the files mine is also saying can not find the file dxp.exe
,chmod777,2011-04-08T05:47Z,"claynelson, the .bin and .cue are disc images. Use some software like VirtualCloneDrive to mount the images, and you will see the install files."
,lolermaster,2011-04-10T04:17Z,"This thing works, just use your damn brains ... come on!"
,claynelson,2011-04-10T06:01Z,run it as admin works fine for me now.
,sjsnew,2011-04-12T00:23Z,"In case anyone is still having trouble with this.

1. After unraring and mounting the bin/cue files, install the program as usual.
2. In the root directory of the mounted DVD, inside the ""TeamHS"" folder, copy the exe and alf file to the root directory of the installation (by default, this directory is C:\Program Files\Altium\AD 10).  The alf file can really go anywhere, but I found it easiest to leave it here.
3. Run the exe file and click the patch button.
4. Open Altium Designer.  It will report that it does not have a license.  On the My Account page (this is the page that it opens to by default after the install...you can also get here by going to Help>About>My Account button), look for the option to ""Add standalone license file"".  Navigate to the location of the alf file and select it.  The license is now all set.  It may say ""Subscription Expired"", but it will still work.

Don't forget to check out the additional libraries and goodies in appropriately marked folders in the root directory of the DVD.

Hope that helps anyone else who may get stuck."

,impr0v3d,2011-05-04T16:46Z,"okay. im really sorry but this is the first time i encountered something like this xD 

i got PowerISO for mounting stuffs, but should i extract all the .bin and .cue files from each rar file? or just one? or should i mount the all the rar files? 

im really confused. sorry"
,sjsnew,2011-05-09T04:00Z,"@impr0v3d

Extracting from the main rar file will automatically extract from all of the other parts (r00, r01, etc).  Once extracted, you would then mount the bin/cue files that were inside."

,thewiseone,2011-06-19T22:57Z, HS-AD10.exe hits as a trojan 
,longword,2011-08-17T00:31Z,"If it detects worms, trojans or anything, get a better antivirus :-) It's safe and clean, unless you already have something in your system infecting stuff for you on the fly.....

Besides, mostly it's reported as malware... as most keygens and patchers..."

After make this running I've notice that all elements become invisible (hide) while moving. Altium is useless with that. I've tried find out Altium settings but it did not help.
Any suggestion what it might be? Any one have same problem?
