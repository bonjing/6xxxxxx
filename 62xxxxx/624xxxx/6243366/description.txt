But now, one known only as â€œThe Masked Magicianâ€ defies his fellow conjurers to disclose on video the tricks that have captivated audiences for centuries!
Youâ€™ve always wondered how they saw a woman in half, make an elephant disappear, shoot an arrow through a human body, escape from a padlocked water tank. Now youâ€™ll learn the secrets behind these and many, many more tricks and illusions. Plus, at the end of each show on this video youâ€™ll learn the magic behind an illusion not shown on TV!
The specials featured performances from the Masked Magician, who performed large-scale illusions and smaller-scale close up magic tricks, before revealing the secrets of the tricks.
