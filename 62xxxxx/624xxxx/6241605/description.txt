Not recommended for young viewers, very dark and boring for average viewers.

The movie contains one of the longest average shot lengths in any motion picture 145.7 s.

The famous opening shot of Bela Tarr's "Satantango" is done in a single take lasting seven minutes.

 It is of a herd of cows walking across an empty landscape as the camera pans from right to left. 

 A single long take approximately 4 hours into the movie lasts an incredible 10 min 14 s.

No action, no comedy, No music, extremely slow, not entertaining just cult, annoyingly depressive for most people I believe. I warned you!

You need a lot of patience with  this movie. Have a look at the sample before dl.

In a small dilapidated village in 1980s Hungary, life has come to a virtual standstill.

The autumn rains have started. The villagers expect to receive a large cash payment that

 evening, and then plan to leave. Some want to abscond earlier with more than their fair

 share of the money. However they hear that the smooth talking Irimias, whom they thought

 had died, is coming back. They are apprehensive that he will take all their money in one

 of his grandiose schemes to keep the community going.
