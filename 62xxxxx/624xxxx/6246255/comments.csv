,dukeofurl,2011-03-16T05:04Z,"It's fairly fast for me, coming in at over 600 kB/s, and uploading 85 kB/s.  Though the speed is changing a lot, dropping as low as 500 kB/s and high as 1 MB/s."

You're really complaining about the speed of this download? These people are amazing, the show aired yesterday.. YESTERDAY! Yet it's already available here to download all thanks to VTV so please don't complain it's rude.  Have a little patience, most people who missed it when it aired have to wait until it reruns or is out on dvd so you should feel privileged to be able to not only watch, but download to own, so so soon."
,dukeofurl,2011-03-17T00:01Z,I downloaded it before it was even finished airing on the west coast (where I am) because I wanted to watch something else.
