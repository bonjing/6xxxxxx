[V],HobbitGamez,2011-03-16T22:18Z,It is worth noting that a USB microphone compatible with the Nintendo Wii is absolutely required for playing this title.
,researcher70,2011-03-17T04:24Z,Thank you very much.

Looking forward to seeing more releases from you!"
,madecepeda,2011-03-25T01:16Z,"I can't get the mic to work: All rockbands and guitar heros work with it except this game.
I have a chipped wii."

Occasionally the game will not recognize the usb mic if it has not been plugged in prior to powering on the Wii. But the mic has been confirmed working with either IOS249 base57 rev21 or IOS250 base57 rev21. Good luck."

Is the homebrew link? Also can you download onto a dvd and load into wii? Please be nice on comments people this is 1st time I have ever written on here and trying to figure out how to play wii games downloaded from TPB. I am very much a novice."

I cannot post the link as it is a banned domain on TPB for whatever reason. Just download the torrent or go here for the link (you will need to register at suprbay to see it):

You cannot do it through CD or DVD, you must have an SD card. There is absolutely no way around that."

Try IOS 222, 249, and 250. It should work with one of those. Use a WBFS formatted hard drive."
,Schizoman,2011-05-17T19:04Z,You mention this works with the Dolphin emulator on the PC but I have that and when I go to load the file it says it's an unrecognized ISO and I can't play it.  How do I get it to work?
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-05-17T23:58Z,"@Schizoman

If it will not work it is not supported yet. You have to wait for further development."
,durlan,2012-01-06T17:22Z,I had the same problem as mimi80 and found that using ios 224-mload fixed it.
