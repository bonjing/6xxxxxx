He maybe on your next one you could grab a bunch of Corduroy Mavericks stuff. They have some amazing traxx. ;P"

Thanks! Yeah, I've already added Corduroy Mavericks, though it's mostly remixes done on other tracks. I'll dig a little more. See if I can find some more"

Hey how come the files are .rar? Is it one continuous track?"
,frogski,2011-06-02T16:05Z,"@gtech211

No, they're individual tracks. In rar to prevent cherry picking :P"
,nazali1983,2011-06-10T19:45Z,"Thanks for the upload mate, You no doubt paid a lot for these tracks as i do, And shared the wealth!"
,frogski,2011-06-15T14:57Z,"@nazali

yeah, it's true. I usually spend 40-50 Euro's a month buying tracks. I don't really mind that. What I don't have much is time, which requires a lot to go through all stuff and pick out the better tracks :)"
