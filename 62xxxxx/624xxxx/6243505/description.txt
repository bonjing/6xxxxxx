         Witness an 8.9 Mega quake then watch as a 30 foot high        
         tsunami Destroys many cites of Japan. Its only a matter       
         of time before a devastating earthquake hits a major          
         American city and wipes it off the map. Scientists now        
         believe that day could be sooner than we thought. And         
         its not Los Angeles or San Francisco thats in danger. But     
         Seattle, Washington, the crown jewel of a region called       
         Cascadia in Americas Pacific Northwest. Scientists fear       
         Cascadia could suffer a catastrophe of global proportions:    
         a megathrust earthquake. It is the largest earthquake the     
          planet can create.
