NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Battle.Los Angeles

Here we go finally with this ......we've been working on it for a few days now,but different issues stopped us getting this
out earlier,oh well get there in the end
The russian video was pretty nice but made up of 3 cams i believe as the video changes,specially near the last 30 mins or
so......its defo 2 versions that for sure as we have a silver they used,which matches the last fight scene but no the start so.
Anyways.....the video has been video like normal,changed rgb colours,sharpness,brightness etc....
The audio is pretty decent line ....few little drops in audio levels and squeaks but decent overall.
Syncing was a PITA ......due to some dark scenes and the fact the way its cammed (studio wise) its like green zone was,as if your
running with the man so this made it hard to watch their mouths alot of the times :lol:
Pretty sure we go tmost if no all insync so ......
