I bought this DVD at a much higher price assuming that the media quality would be good.
But it seems this Pebbles company had burned the data in some low-quality disc. 
Further adding up to my frustation they have write-protected the disk,so that no one can make a copy of it.
If they think they are smart. They should also know that MUCH-SMARTER people are in this world.
I am not a kind of person who would normally encourage piracy.
But this stupid(moron,worthless...what everrrrr)company had frustrated me a lot to do like this.
Atleast here after let those people burn the data in a good quality DVD.
 
 Till then folks, enjoy downloading... and atleast keep seeding till you get the share ratio as 1.000
