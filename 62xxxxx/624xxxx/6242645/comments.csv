If you are too much of a dumbass to have ever tried to install the game once then stfu 
cuz you just dont know what you are talking about 
the fukin installer requaires a fuckin cd key which of course cant be used universali cuz steam is a shithead and will only let your account use that key "

i am currently running win7 x64 ultimate"
,MulliganM,2011-03-14T21:58Z,"@Everyone....

Ya you cannot install it cause the ISO hasn't been cracked. You can install the game by loading the ISO and copying everything into a folder on your desktop..

Than Download PHOENIX 1.4 ... If you don't want to do this delete the ISO and wait for the game to come out or tell someone cracks the steam ISO... 

Remember just cause someone got to download the game before everyone else doesn't mean its going work for you with out a work around..."
,MulliganM,2011-03-14T21:59Z,"@Everyone....

Ya you cant just install game by loading up the ISO. It hasn't been cracked!!!!

This is the full ISO for those who bought it on steam and have a key for it.. If you don't want to use PHOENIX 1.4 delete the iso and wait for someone to crack it!"
,medicina,2011-03-14T22:26Z,@yarghhh i have another error..it says that sysinstall cannot be found...i think razor1911 will make release tommorow...steam is their gorund...
,Rando_q1,2011-03-14T23:34Z,Yeah. and Razor will include their own game installer what will unpack this game and then we can crack it too:) so that week old iso is not pointless...

,nerdpox,2011-03-15T00:31Z,"Guys. It's very simple. There isn't a crack yet, the game hasn't even been released. Before we start squabbling over bullshit like this, let's just sit back and let the professionals do it. I'm sure SKIDROW and RAZOR1911 will have releases before the week is out. "

,chazmrokar,2011-03-15T11:06Z,"For the noobs who are saying this isnt working:
You just have to open the image (Homefront.iso) via Deamon or some virtual mechanics and COPY all contents of ""DVD"" to your disk. Now move the installer into folder with install stuff, launch it and read the screen instructions. Remember - if ""any key"" doesnt work, use ENTER!

,yarghhh,2011-03-15T19:53Z,"0MaDMaT0 
Still I don't see any sense in this. Isn't better to wait for scene release than download non scene and then doing all this shit? You all really can't wait a week or two? Kids this days. Can't wait few days to make life easier...

oh and FUCK you  Warhammer Dow Retribution runs without a crack 
so there is some sense in going through all this because there might be some hope that the game runs without a crack some hope ..."

,elitegamernl,2011-03-15T20:22Z,"@yarghhh as you told us already it is TRUE
it extracts fine but the game itself just stays in the processes but won't show itself ;O running on Windows 7 Ultimate X64"

My installer it at 0982/2757, so it will take a while. "
,TexasMilitiaman,2011-03-17T22:13Z,I can verify that this is legit.But just like hello212345 I too can only get to the menu screen and nothing but the credits and exit buttons work.The crack that is out named steam crack only is the crack i used so apparently we are going to have to wait for a more reliable crack.
,TexasMilitiaman,2011-03-17T22:20Z,"Guys this is how I installed the game.I got the clone copy and I unrared the files and then got this installer and put it with the unrared files of the game and run the installer from there and the game will install fine.But like I said before the crack named ""Steam crack only"" only gets you to the main menu of thew game and only the credits and exit buttons work.I think with a day or two we will have a better crack."

,myth1337,2011-03-23T22:45Z,"I got this to work fine after some trial and error. 

First, follow the steps orchlon has provided below:

1. Download the installer.

2. Extract all the content within the ISO file with WINRAR or any other ISO tool.

3. Put the installer into the directory where you extracted the ISO.

4. Download msvcr100.dll from here:

http://www.dll-files.com/msvcr100.zip?0WMmUGbEeS 

and extract it into the same directory you extracted the ISO.

5. Create a folder anywhere on your hard drive that is not protected.

6. Run the installer and everything else should be self explained.

7. If you complete this process and you don't see the Homefront directory where the files ""installed"", RESTART YOUR COMPUTER!

If the files are where they should be, then download the sound and ammo crackfix from UFO.sule here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6254403/Homefront_sound___ammo_crack_fix

and all will be well with the people!

Paper Bitches!!!!!"
