,DarkLightHeart,2011-03-18T11:14Z,"Working just fine on 5.50 GEN-D4 AKA  GEN-D3 w/prometheus 4
only funky thing about it is the exit menu is japanese still? everthing else is english so it doesnt matter maybe its a game flaw?"
,qzpogi16,2011-03-18T11:56Z,"it doesn't work on 5.50 gen d3, it only shows an error code:80020148, how sad."
,roach1988,2011-03-18T14:09Z,"made it to work on 5.03 m33-6 by patching iso with isotool v 1.75
but the game hangs and i think its an issue with a sound file because whenever i create new character and try to test out the voices it hangs.
i i dont test the voices while creating character it hangs at the very first mission in about 10secs..
any1 else having same problem?"
,DarkLightHeart,2011-03-18T18:18Z,Not me but i heard hanging at the first few missions has happened to quite a few people. you might have to try prometheus 3 or 4. or maybe try Pro-B3 with the iso tool patch. i heard people got it to work with those things
,DarkLightHeart,2011-03-18T18:21Z,Btw ive played a few of the first missions and this game is f*cking beast. personally i like this game a lot so far so its definetly worth updating your CFW to get it to work. im going to update soon to so that i dont have to worry about it for awhile. just not to 6.20 TN-d cause that shit sounds sketch to me
,roXas_XIII,2011-03-18T18:50Z,Guys? Do you know how to put the ISO Tool in you're psp? I'm new at this. :| Please reply. :|
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-18T18:55Z,"You're welcome, guys.

Based on reports, the game doesn't work on any firmwares lower then 5.50 + Prometheus-4 .

On a verge of 2011 i've came to a conclusion that it's time to move on. I loved 5.50 GEN-D3 much, but new games dictate their own compatibility rules. I'm using 6.20 + TN-D HEN for three months now. And so far so good. All the plugins i've used are already ported and all new games i've tried so far work like a charm, except couple maybe.

No patching method as of yet."

 ur link to the patched version doesn't work.. says it doesnt exist or sumthing.. "
,JIHUIN,2011-03-23T09:42Z,"@babyPEANUT
I've patched the game using ISO Tool v1.970 by Takka and use TOTWRM3, the game will start but unfortunately on the first mission the game freeze and restart your PSP...not a successful patch at all...but thanks a lot for the effort.

@NitorgenUA
The GEB patched version you have uploaded recently also has the same problem...I believe that is the reason why you remove the torrent link...but anyway I will search for other method to patch this game, this is much more challenging to me...

If there's really no solution to patch this game then we should move on and update to Prometheus 4... Nice brainstorming with you guys."
,eXpiation,2011-03-23T13:56Z,"Hey guys.

I'm on 5.50 D3 now and the patched game runs, however it does crash when trying to play certain audio/video files. (trying to play the first tutorial video for instance guarantees a crash).

From what I've seen here, people have had mixed success. I'm considering upgrading to 6.20 / 6.35, however I'm not actually sure that this would fix the crashing?

Can anyone on CFW 6.20 / 6.35 confirm that using those versions to run the unpatched game in fact results in no crashing? Thanks!"
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-23T16:24Z,"joshvil, yup, i've deleted it, cuz it didn't worked out. The game still freezes, while performing any actions in mission.

eXpiation, i can confirm, i've successfuly passed 1st mission on 6.20 TN-D, though haven't tested it further due to lack of time."
,bsen,2011-03-23T16:34Z,"Hi every1, m new to this firmware, i have psp 2001. i upgraded it to 5.50 prome-2 from 5.50 gen-d3. and now i cant play some new games like nba 2k11, dragonball etc. i saw new prome-4 is out but dont know if i can directly upgrade from prome-2 to prome-4. can ne1 help me???????????           thnx"
,eXpiation,2011-03-23T19:15Z,"Thanks NitrogenUA! :)

Okay, I've updated to Prometheus 4 (http://www.psp-hacks.com/2010/12/03/5-03-5-50-prometheus-4-released/) and I can confirm the crashes have stopped. Woo! (tested with the first tutorial video and misc voices and they all work!)

Been a bit reluctant to go to 6.xx since afaik you can't load ISOs natively with it?

When I look at the libraries included with Prometheus 4 (libaac, libmp4), it makes sense that audio/video would cause this game to crash, since fw 5.x doesn't support these media formats!

@bsen - I updated to Prom4 from Prom1 on a PSP Fat and everything seems to work fine here :)"
,JIHUIN,2011-03-24T02:55Z,"@bsen
Yes, you can upgrade directly from Prome-2 to Prome-4. See the link given by eXpiation."
,joshvil,2011-03-24T16:34Z,"finally i made it work on my psp 3000.. took me almost 2 days to do it. 

for those using psp 3000 cfw 5.03 gen c.. i think the best solution is to upgrade to prometheus 4.. after upgrading freezing has stop and i even passed the kongou mission problem i had before.. 

tnx for this upload love this game.. :) tnx NitrogenUA"
,baphomatt,2011-03-26T03:08Z,I got this one working on my silver slim (2000) running cfw 5.0 m33-6 by decrypting the eboot and patching prometheus me631 in isotool 1.97. The only issue I had was whenever I pressed the home button the text was in Chinese.
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-26T22:46Z,"baphomatt, haven't worked out for me. do you use prometheus on your m33-6?"
,baphomatt,2011-03-27T04:13Z,The prometheus plugins? No I don't use any plugins.  I patched it with isotool 1.97. First I decrypt and patch the eboot then I patch prometheus then picked the me631 folder.  I'm going to have to test it out again to see if I have any of the issues other users are talking about.
,baphomatt,2011-03-27T05:31Z,"I've made it through character creation, the tutorial missions and the first mission with no lock up, sound or visual issues. Again the only issue is the chinese text when home key is pressed.  Again, I'm on 5.0 m33-6 without any plugins.  I'm too stubborn to upgrade; praying that Dark Alex will release another cfw.  But, I think that day unfortunately will never come."
,baphomatt,2011-03-27T05:35Z,Thanks for the great torrents NitrogenUA!
