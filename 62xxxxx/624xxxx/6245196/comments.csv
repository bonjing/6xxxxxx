,SupremeClientele,2011-03-17T01:55Z,are there subtitles on this?
[V],SaM,2011-03-20T23:13Z,Subtitle(s): English + Multi-Sub
,BoonesFerry,2011-03-21T02:38Z,I wish there was a srt file for just the non-english parts. It's annoying to have subtitles throughout the entire movie. 
,BoonesFerry,2011-03-21T02:46Z,"I downloaded an srt for non-english parts only 
from another torrent. I'm all set. "
