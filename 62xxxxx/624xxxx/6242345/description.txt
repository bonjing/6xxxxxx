Hereafter (2010)

Directed by Clint Eastwood.

Starring Matt Damon, Bryce Dallas Howard & Cecile De France

A drama centered on three people who are haunted by mortality in different ways. George (Damon) is a blue-collar American who has a special connection to the afterlife. On the other side of the world, Marie (de France), a French journalist, has a near-death experience that shakes her reality. And when Marcus (Frankie/George McLaren), a London schoolboy, loses the person closest to him, he desperately needs answers. Each on a path in search of the truth, their lives will intersect, forever changed by what they believe might-or must-exist in the hereafter.

I downloaded Vlinders copy and found that a large part of the film is French speaking.

I added custom English subtitles but only for the French speaking parts, these subs are not hard-coded, you will need to switch them on in your players menu.

Enjoy.
