Maybe  The Pirate Bay can arrange to have telesync  cams uplaoded in their own special place?
thanks"

Terrible ts copy m/2 v/0.5 ds (download speed)/2
Took me 1.5 days to download. Also the movie is split up into like 20 different files. Unloader may be retarded. "
,b0urna,2011-05-17T15:51Z,"This is an uncompressed telesync rip, copied straight from the DVD. Seems like the correct category for the movie, and the uploader (not unloader) doesnt seem quite as retarded as the people making these comments (learn before you speak). 
Its a free torrent, take it and quit whining, or (like me) wait for the retail DVD rip. "
