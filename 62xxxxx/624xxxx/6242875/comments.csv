,frailwordscollapse,2011-06-15T18:04Z,YES! Been looking for a good quality version of this audiobook for a while. (the other ones literally sound like they're underwater) And the tracks are consolidated to chapter by chapter and everything. And it's still narrated by Nathaniel Parker. Thanx very much zeves! Excellent upload!
,frailwordscollapse,2011-06-15T18:38Z,Ahh dammit I just realized chapters 7 - epilogue have crappy quality as well. But this is still a good upload.
,Dr.Oranges,2011-08-24T03:02Z,"Yes, everything good but chapter 7 sounds like it is read by a 70's Dr Who robot voice.."
,Dr.Oranges,2011-08-24T03:12Z,"NO!
Sorry but it is almost unbearable, chapter 7 that is.
FIND ANOTHER DOWNLOAD IF POSSIBLE!"
