...................................NFO:.................................................W4F PRESENTS: Q.and.A.AU.2011.03.14.Julia.Gillard.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F
 
RELEASE DATE: 2011/03/15

Genre: Reality/Talk Show
 
Description:

"Q&A puts punters, pollies and pundits together in the studio to thrash out the
hot issues of the week. It's about democracy in action - on Q&A the audience
gets to ask the questions." 
http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/


Q&A isn't something we usually release (we can if there is significant interest), 
but last nights episode was a bit special, notably for when Prime Minister Julia
Gillard was ambushed on air by a question from Julian Assange. Made for great television!


"WIKILEAKS founder Julian Assange has levelled a question at Prime Minister Julia
Gillard via video link from house arrest in the UK, asking if she swapped information
about citizens with foreign powers."   (The Australian,)
