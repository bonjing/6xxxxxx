Quality is great! Those of you thinking it's undersized for 1080p will be pleasantly surprised. Runtime is short, it's shot digitally with practically zero noise, and we have lots of still scenes and scenes with a high amount of bokeh. Not undersized at all!

You will notice a slight jaggedness in the picture though. It's present on 720p rips as well, and it looks like it's on the master as well (looks like the thing was shot in 1080i and converted to progressive). I wouldn't blame that on the rip.
