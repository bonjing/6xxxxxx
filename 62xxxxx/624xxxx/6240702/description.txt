Let's face it, Sonic '06 for the PS3 and 360 is perhaps the worst sonic game of all time but where there is a negative there is a plus, a clusterfuck of game can produce an amazing soundtrack.

So I bring to you in a 332MB 7zip file, a three disc OST including an extra folder known as Vocal Traxx which has some pretty good remixes.

Details about the OST can be found at:

Please remember, you need 7zip to extract the OST.

Enjoy, seed, leech and comment=]
