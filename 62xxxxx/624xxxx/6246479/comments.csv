[T],FatFreddy007,2011-03-16T07:57Z,hey ctang... welcome!!!
,Jester647,2011-03-17T15:31Z,"Hi Ctang!

Welcome back man!

I am so glad!"
[T],ctang,2011-03-17T22:59Z,"well guys/gals, i have this about 60% seeded...hope you all seed this for a really long time"
,1970chrisnov,2011-03-18T00:58Z,thx ctang
[T],ctang,2011-03-20T04:46Z,"you guys honestly suck for seeding...seriously suck...people that join private sites always ask when joining why i left here...month later tell me they dont know how i lasted as long as i did on public sites

perfect time for a facepalm"
,inksza,2011-03-22T19:56Z,"taking it, thank you very much:)"
,keleieke,2011-03-23T04:43Z,"Private trackers is like living with my mother.

TPB will always be my first luv."
[T],ctang,2011-03-23T18:10Z,"well obviously your on the wrong private trackers...there are a lot of shit private trackers out there but thats bc they have so many rules and no draw for people to want to be active members (seed, upload)"
[T],ctang,2011-03-23T23:19Z,"i am very good friends with tater lol...we share a seedbox and use it on the private sites

even if there was a 1:1 ratio that people had to abide by then this site would be 1000000 times better...thats all it would take...ban there damn ip addresses and things would get really interesting really fast

-ctang

agentbay, nice to here from ya"
,keleieke,2011-03-23T23:32Z,"What I especially like about TPB is the population.  Unlike private trackers with so few leechers, TPB has enough that payback is a breeze.  I wonâ€™t even get into the ratio gluttons with their speedy seedboxes on the private trackers.  The fastest connection/seedbox gets the bulk of the upload ratio (upload credits) while the slower get left with no one to seed too.  Slow connections loose in a private tracker world, imo.  At least on TPB, thereâ€™s more often enough leechers.

And look at hjsn1 who hasnâ€™t uploaded anything new in ages; many of his torrents are still aliveâ€¦ as are yours, ctang.  Hopefully, ctang, you arenâ€™t trying to pied piper the awesome NTSC DVD5 uploaders to private trackers.  Weâ€™ve already lost so many (djfred, tater, mikemelo, omegafox, punisher_latin?).  At least you still come around and I appreciate that.  Sounds like others do too.

Agentbay, I donâ€™t get your â€œscumbagâ€ comment.  Sure there are, but why would that upset you?  I doubt youâ€™re often left as the lone seeder.  How do you see whoâ€™s a scumbag?  What do you mean about giving back?  Hopefully, ppl look at their torrent clientâ€™s total ratio stats and keep it at least 1:1.  I heard on a private tracker, â€œtorrents shouldnâ€™t be freeâ€.  What the hell does that mean!?  Does paying for a torrent with ratio or credits somehow make it more legit?  Does it make an uploader feel more rewarded?  ctang?"
[T],ctang,2011-03-24T01:46Z,"you have a very scewed view of public vs private trackers (well most private trackers)

on public trackers people do not care about ratios at all...even though you say that my torrents still have some seeders even after all of this time, my torrents on private sites have many seeders still...every torrent is like that

plus on most of the private trackers there are games to play for free"
,keleieke,2011-03-24T05:09Z,"Sorry my post looks like crap; hope it's still readable.  What it says is that I miss you and your friends, ctang."
[T],ctang,2011-03-24T05:54Z,"im sorry to say this but if you miss us then you will be required to figure out a way to get on the private trackers because that is where omegafox, mikemelo, tater and myself now reside

i have no connection with hjsn1 or djfred (actually at times i wondered if they were the same but am not sure) or punisher latin and have no idea where they are or why they stopped uploading

but you have seedkey still and he uploads all the new movies that come out worth watching

tater, mike, myself and omega all do mostly older movies...if that is what you want then your back at square 1 and like i said, need to find invites to the private trackers...im sorry you miss us but none of us have any desire to come back and continue uploading to the public sites, i.e. tpb, demonoid...if our torrents show up on here it wont be by any of us"

you can honestly go fuck yourself...i looked for fuckin 2 years for these and finally fuckin broke down and bought them and you have the goddam audacity to fucking say some goddam bullshit like that...go to fuckin hell

i was pissed as all hell to see that they were already uploaded when i put them on here bc i fuckin wasted my $70 on them...so go fuck yourself"

@ftfx:  if you knew what the fuck you were talkin about you could check them yourself and you would see that i didnt remove anything...look at the menu structure...if there was spanish subs/audio that i removed then tell me where the language selector is on the discs that dont have the spanish...plus, it says it in the description that i spanish isnt offered on the 2 discs...it has always said this...your proof is that it is impossible to edit the torrent description once the torrent index is created...ask any moderator on tpb...believe me or not, i could give a shit less"
[T],ctang,2011-04-11T06:09Z,"@xtfx:  sorry about the name wrong in the post b4 this one...that was my mistake...and i meant english not spanish (well i meant spanish but then realized you said english)...still my answer is the same...im assuming you posted the other zumba disc in the comment bc you think since that has english subs and mine doesnt, that i removed them (thinking that they are the same, i just re-uploaded getting this info from the dickweed that was making comments b4, unless you are in fact this same dickweed just a different username, sorry if that isnt the case though)...anyhow, i have no idea what is on that other torrent as far as audio/subs as this torrent is not the same torrent...it could be bc duh im sure im not the only one in this world that has actually bought something but i did not rip that guys torrent off

i was going to take the time to scan the documents that came with the dvd's but since it seems that nobody will appreciate them im not going to do them...sorry if you wanted them but others have pissed me off to the point to where if you want them, then too bad

,xtfx,2011-04-18T22:15Z,"Where are the english subtitles in it ? are you saying it was inside ? i searched everywhere in the menu and hack it inside of the film, nothing and WHERE IS IT ? I can understand WHY they are not happy whether haven't any subs in it !!! EVERYBODY NEEDS SUBS, that's how simple it is ! on the original there were ENGLISH AND SPANISH SUBTITLES INSIDE, look for the original purschase at the DVDS TRUE STORES !!!  we pay internet for download which is expensive !!! IT IS NOT FREE HERE AT ALL ON THE NET, WE PAY FOR IT, EVERYBODY PAY FOR IT !"
[T],ctang,2011-04-18T22:49Z,"there were no subtitles at the source...just like the description says

i dont know if there is something in google translate that isnt translating for you (that is if you dont know english) or what is happening that you dont understand that there are no subtitles and never were...i never remove anything when i upload a dvd torrent...thats not how i operate

as for you saying that i misled you and about your internet and blah blah blah, seriously, look at the description...does it say subtitles anywhere...didnt think so...it says english AUDIO and spanish AUDIO...subtitles NONE

and you no what, where are there menu's at that say that would give you subtitles...thats right there isnt any...and to even further me being right (bc you may say that i removed them), if i removed them there would still be a space that said set-up, subtitles or well something on the main menu and there isnt...so how do you explain that

[T],ctang,2011-04-21T23:27Z,"nice to see your a class act lol wow...thats all i have to say

and by the way, if you have a 6 disc set its missing a few discs...there are the 4 discs that i put on here which is the Zumba Total Transformation pack and there are also older dvd's from early 2000's (which is also 4 discs) so your missing 2 discs

why do you think i removed anything...there clearly isnt any subs for those 2 discs or other audio...im at a loss but oh well...clearly the over 1000 people that have downloaded this from me just on here arent complaining, just you...guess that makes you the dickhead here...you act like i told everyone that whatever the fuck you wanted was on all the discs and then you wasted your bandwidth for nearly 18GB just to find out that i was wrong...dude, this isnt my first fucking time around the block...clearly it's yours and you have no idea what the hell your talkin about

i get on this page now just for my enjoyment of bashing you after a long days work...at first i thought we were just on 2 different pages and you weren't understanding me for some reason (was giving you the benefit of the doubt) but i have come to realize that your nothing but scum between my toes (which isnt anything to be proud of right at this moment...almost feel sorry for you lol)...well thats probably an upgrade compared to people around you...if only you could see what i imagine you to look like...you'd probably wanna kick my ass just for that...but anyways

and by the way, i encourage you to make more nonsense comments on a daily basis on this torrent that way others can get a good laugh just as i have reading your comments (and well i guess my comments as well!!!)

insert facepalm now :)

thank you for this excellent download,
you are a credit to this community,

99% of people on here appreciate what you have done, remember, just because someone does not say thank you, it's mostly just because they probably don't have an account,

and please don't keep replying to all those arseholes giving you a hard time, they are insignificant fleas with nothing better to do than try to get you into an online slagging match, don't lower yourself to their level,

keep up the good work.

@02jeko:  agreed!!!!!

@rudidas:  unfortunately for you, you have to find Pal format if your dvd player doesnt accept both ntsc and pal formated dvd's...but you can play them on your computer, just use dvd player app already on your mac, or you could use vlc player

@oiboibilly:  for dvd9, locate nero recode from the main nero menu and add dvd9 folder and burn...make sure you check advanced analysis (will do 2 passes instead of 1) 

for dvd5, locate nero express from the main nero menu and add 1 of the dvd5 folders...click next and make sure the correct dvd burner is checked and click burn...you can title your dvd as well or keep it what it says...repeat process for the next 2 dvd5's

how to download and burn this torrent

1. click ""download this torrent"" on this page
2. download utorrent from utorrent.com + install utorrent
3. after installed utorrent, double click on the torrent file you downloaded...should be "" Zumba_Total_Body.........
4. should open up in utorrent, now just click ok or continue or whatever it says
5. wait for it to completely download...and i mean 100% complete
6. get back on here and check a few posts up from this one to see the burn instructions

let me know if that helps

,Snapperhead1,2011-06-18T19:01Z,"First of all..........THANK YOU, THANK YOU THANK YOU for this incredible torrent.  After downloading from TPB for years, it still blows me away the whining I see on this and so many other torrents.  Ripping off other peoples torrents??????? WTF????  This is THE PIRATE BAY......LOL  its all ripped off from some place or somebody.  I could give a RATS ASS where it came from.  I am truly grateful to CTANG for taking the time to upload these high quality files that add to the quality of MY life.  And to all the lame whiners actually threatening you with violence or the like..........Go FUCK YOURSELVES.  You couldnt kick anyones Ass......because your a pussy that still lives with their parents and has no life.  Because your mommy brings you all your meals, and makes up your room, you have way too much time to just sit and bite the hand that feeds you.

Again..........thanks ctang.  You have uploaded countless GREAT torrents.........and for that I am truly grateful.  The Bay works because of selfless people like you.  All the other haters are just ants at a picnic..........."

,Divalish1,2012-03-25T00:23Z,"First off I've gotta say that I love you for posting these! Amazing quality. I'm new to this torrent thing. I managed to get the basics burned to a dvd and everything is working except for the menu, I was wondering if there's a way to make the menu work in a dvd player? I'm using dvd flick to burn. thanks!"
[T],ctang,2012-03-25T04:31Z,"how are you trying to play it...the menu is working fine on my rip, as i still have backups on my laptop and just checked again...try using VLC player...its cross platform so good on mac and windows

1. Open VLC
2. Click on File>Open Disk
3. Select VIDEO_TS and then click on browse
4. Locate the folder ZUMBA_BASIC and highlight it
5. Click Open
6. Click Open again
7. Give it a second and it will open up the DVD file structure located in the ZUMBA_BASIC folder

If you still dont have menu's after doing this then perhaps your download is corrupted somehow...let me know what you find out

-ctang"
,Divalish1,2012-03-25T15:38Z,The menu is on the dvd it's just not interactive. What should I do if some of the files are corrupted? Should I download the torrent again? I wanna give a copy to my sister so I appreciate you responding so quickly. :)
,Divalish1,2012-03-25T15:41Z,"the menu also works on my computer, it's when I burn it to a disc, it just plays but I can't use my remote to control it."
[T],ctang,2012-03-27T03:57Z,"i hate to tell you to try to burn it again, but if your willing to try it again, burn at a very slow speed...like 2x or 4x
