    Beach volleyball
    Curling: To push the stone down the ice, first hold the B button down, then move the Wii Remote forward at the right time to throw. Twisting the remote to the left or right will add additional ""curl"" to the stone. As the stone moves down the ice, you can sweep the ice in front of it by wiggling the Wii Remote back and forth.
    Figure skating: Follow the set path with the Nunchuk's analog stick, and flick the Wii Remote close to the center point of the trick circles that appear to perform tricks.
