[T],xxThugxx,2011-05-19T22:39Z,"guys sorry i've been away, i was locked out of my account because TPB said my account was hacked and some suspect torrents were uploaded. i've sorted it now though, so i will try to get on all your requests asap =)"
[T],xxThugxx,2011-05-19T22:40Z,"Kenyl sorry for the late reply mate, there is really no need to reflash your phone, you could put your device in recovery mode, and use adb to push your framework-res.apk back to /system/"
,Kenyl,2011-05-21T06:28Z,"Thanks Thug...i'm not familiar with ADB,so i flashed to the latest rom.Thanks for tips though...nice share,mate.."
[T],xxThugxx,2011-05-21T10:02Z,"You always run the risk messing the the framework Kenyl, you should always make a backup, if it happens again, just ask and i'll make you an update.zip you can flash from recovery to restore your framework =)"
