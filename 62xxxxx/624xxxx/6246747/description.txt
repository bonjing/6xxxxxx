Description: 
This episode celebrates the classic and uniquely British 
culinary invention of high tea. Almost every family has a 
different take on which recipes are best to fill up the family 
in the evening and so the Bikers are on the hunt for three 
mums and their take on the perfect high tea.
Like generations of farmers' wives before her, our first 
mum Polly has to feed her hungry husband and kids every 
night, so the recipes she shares have been tried and 
tested countless times over the years. Her beef and honey
stew, and lamb and mint sausages never fail to impress.
Lisa is playing culinary detective, enlisting the help of the 
Bikers to uncover the mysteries of a family recipe book that 
hasn't been cooked with for years. The tasty results include 
simple meat patties and some great sweet-treats called diggers.
Nancy is the third mum and she shares a transatlantic take on tea with her mum's 'hockey puck' meatloaf and a great potato salad.
Inspired by the mums' culinary invention the Bikers cook up a great duo of savoury pies, and a divine lemon curd Swiss roll.
With the mums ready, hundreds of foodies descend on the Bikers' recipe fair. Amidst the recipe swapping and general mayhem the bikers create a teatime classic - meatballs in gravy. Meanwhile, food historian Gerard Baker challenges the recipe fair visitors to a historical skills challenge - making a pie known as a 'chacky pig'.
