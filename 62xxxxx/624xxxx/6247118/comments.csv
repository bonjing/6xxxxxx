,Ataractic,2011-03-18T13:14Z,"Weird. Where did all the comments go? and suryamukhi- yes, the rating system is flawed- it allows you to rate every time you login."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-18T13:22Z,"Interesting h0w all the damning comments have suddenly disappeared.  Again it SCREAMS collusion on the part of one or more TPB staff members.  Notice that the rating system hasn't been changed, though."

,DevSIN,2011-03-18T14:31Z,"@2040 : ah i was waitin u to delete & re up the torrent...
u took ur time .
nice job ...ignore the morons ...
u keep doin wat u do best here ^^"
,believenu,2011-03-18T14:32Z,my guess is that someone at tpb are finally investigating and removed comments while they ... maybe do something productive.. I just hope that twentyforty does not leave us his friends forever..
,dark_defender,2011-03-18T14:34Z,"No, 20-40 did not delete or has re-up the torrent. Someone else has deleted them to cover their tracks as i have been told by 20-40 himself."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-18T15:29Z,"I can delete the torrent, not the comments. I have been waiting for two days on some action from TPB, but I have seen deleting of proof where attackers have identified themselves, have been caught in misdoings, terrorizing me (and us) with gazillion of minuses.

They have just changed objects (all my torrents get now tons of minuses), not the objective.

I have no proof of that. Just the continuation of absolutely same shit - get me down, stop my uploads and down-rate my status.

FYI I have many, many, many TV shows and movies ready for seeding."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-18T15:57Z,"...and I never have thoughts of deleting this torrent. So, I haven't touch it. Somebody else - did."
,abj642,2011-03-18T16:05Z,"i had great respect for TPB but the mods have made me lower my respect towards it with their actions...
some of the mods are hell bent on irritating 20-40 which is very sad when a VIP uploader is treated like that...
hey mods get a life.."
,pankaj14_in,2011-03-18T16:18Z,"we r with you 2040...
keep it up...."
,Dr-nidO,2011-03-18T16:24Z,"have to agree that quality system needs fixing....

just tried +1 on the last 50 or so torrents of 2040 and was successful despite the fact that i had already rated most of them previously....

tpb should target the root of the problem that seems to be the faulty quality system which is being used for harassment... "
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-18T18:32Z,"Five small-sized movies (four were requested in deleted (not by me) comments.

Movies are in TV pack

,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-18T18:42Z,"Just remember, kian89, you're being watched--by loyal 20-40 fans with good memories.  Remember justregged's warning?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-19T10:45Z,"@azrielle: He already opened free e-mail account and with new one applied for membership under different user-name. He can do that as much as he like. He can have multiple TPB account, each and every under different user-name and using gazillion different e-mail accounts which are available and active within minutes. They all have done that. They have been banned and appeared again and again. They would scream again (in fact, our dwarf just did).

I have nothing against mental illness, efficient enough... therefore I advised these to stay quiet and enjoy the ride."
,believenu,2011-03-24T12:57Z,just got to watch movie.. great show .. funny irrevent all good.. sex drugs rock and roll.. pirates for freedom..
