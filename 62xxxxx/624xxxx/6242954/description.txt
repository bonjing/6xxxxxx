notes
Strangejuice is an original, eclectic Australian band that began as a two piece busking outfit in 1998. Many years on, Strangejuice focus on musical variety and lyrical content, and have strong groundings in recording and composition.
Utilizing a range of musical instruments, (from conventional Guitars, Piano, Sitar, Banjo, Tanbura, Bodran, all the way to the quirky, Shuffling Cards, Footsteps, screeching birds), Domestic Bliss is an exceptional, original, carefully thought out, well-produced musical experience. 

Harmonious vocals and brooding, prophetic lyrics are what we have come to expect from Strangejuice, after the double LP â€œBrown Songsâ€ (a collection of early works) was released internationally in 2008, and this album certainly does not disappoint. After four years in the making, songwriter Mike Anderson (West Australian Song of the Year 1998 Nominee) considers this collection his best work so far.

Although a conventional songwriter, Mike Andersonâ€™s 5 years of experience in composing music for film and television impregnates the album with a deep and atmospheric quality, and his desire for real instruments and aversion from synthesizers makes for an original, earthy experience. 

Here are some song reviews from the triple J website:
The Middle Class 
rating: 3/5 
What a jaunty tune! Part sea shanty, part drunken saloon singalong, part proletariat folk.. it\\\\\\\'s unusual but that\\\\\\\'s what makes this song stand out. 
Dom Alessio, triple j radio host


Mea Culpa 
rating: 5/5 
What an incredible voice! It demands attention, and rewards with sweetness. Those lyrics are very mysterious.

The Middle Class 
rating: 4/5 
Very original, very Australian - I can hear a lot of work went into the recording and it paid off. Dig it.
