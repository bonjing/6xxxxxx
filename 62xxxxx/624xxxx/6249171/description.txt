I have put together a full set of the 1995 Goosebumps kids TV series. 
The guy R.L. Stine wrote the books then he started the show, well any who I've 
went threw hell to get all the episodes but I got them all. Now 97% of the 
episodes are in DVD quality(one or two actual DVDRips) but a few are VHS 
quality but that doesn't mean there unwatchable, there just not DVD quality. 
I loved this show growing up but it kind went sour around the end of season 3 
but maybe your kids or you may NjOY this show.

When I was a kid I watched a lot of TV and I got a lot more shows I am looking 
for, so when I get another TV set I am going to up it; mostly will be "Are You 
Afraid of The Dark", "Rugrats", or "X-Men Series". Here are a three sample clips just 
to show everyone how the quality looks...

-----------------
DVDRip Quality
-----------------

-----------------
SDTV Quality

VHS Quality (VHS Quality Varies)

The full Goosebumps set is very hard to get because there's no full VHS or DVD 
set for this series just a few random episodes here and there, so grab this 
while you still can.
