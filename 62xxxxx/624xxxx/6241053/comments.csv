I contacted them in questioning if Murray work in DC then and now is what may have been keeping staff at the White House from responding, and the US AG from responding.
I have not always not been tactful. I no better to threaten anyone. And I have never done so or ever wished to in anyway.
And I have most of the emails I have sent in my storage directory. My emails and there response. Which have mostly been limited to a few by the SLO, and a few by an acquittance at MHAt. No one else at all."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-14T01:09Z,"There is a man in Tulsa who around 15 years ago killed his two teenage girls in their sleep and also his wife with a hatchet. I was told by someone at the time that worked in cases concerning Child Sexual abuse that the father killed the girls to cover up his abuse of them.
These kids were my brothers neighbors when he lived in town. The girls were my nephews close friends.
I no longer feel comfortable in anyway in holding anything at all back that is even remotely coincidental.
I so not have the resources to know if this is irrelevant. I have reported this in my last email with the OK SLO for DHS, who refuses to respond.
Just to even respond."

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-14T09:25Z,"As I have said in her before, before returning. I have to leave this alone for while. It may well be that they will continue to ignore in the shear scope of who refuses to respond.
And in that with the limited resources that I have there nothing I can do about this. I have made it public. That is all I can do. As I said in another forum recently that perhaps I need to remember my place.
And in that statement I make myself noxious thinking that that is the reality in this world. The rich, the powerful, and connected seem to protect themselves despite the morality of doing so.
What I am saying is true. To protect these people with out even considering the potential for what they have done to children over the years makes it difficult for me each day to focus off these things. This is not want I wanted the world to be. It is not what I was taught as a child and in these last few weeks I wanted so much to prove to myself that I was wrong. But I am not and that more painful to live with every morning than terror I wnet through as a child."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-14T09:32Z,"And I have to focus off these things, at least for awhile because it just tears at me each moment.
I stopped seeing my family right before Christmas when my brother-in-law hit my nephew instead. And then just a few days later after learning my fathers real diagnosis I found that my sister had let him move back in again.
And I will go no further.
I love my nephews beyond anything. And desperately resent being forced to make this so public.
But at that point in realizing it was each Christmas I'd go in the hospital in the past in fear of hurting myself. It was each Christmas or Thanksgiving after seeing my brother. I realized I had to stay away from them for my health."

The only thing in her otherwise is Chris Russos comment ot me after Eddie died that his family was in the New Orleans Mafia. They moved right after Eddie died. I have Chris' pictures through out my year books. He is real. And he didn't say hey I think I'm related to the guy in Jim Garrisons prosecution in New Orleans of Clay Shaw.
He said the New Orleans Mafia. I thought he was full crap at the time. I had never heard of it myself til many years later.
