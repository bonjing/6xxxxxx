+ Denotes a Japanese Bonus Track Edition

*Note 1: On Dosage, there are 2 versions of the song "Crown" 1 is the original 
         version with "She Said" as the hidden track, and the other, is my edit 
         breaking "She Said out, and making it a stand alone track. The reason I 
         did that was for me, a several minute silence gap is annoying. Esp when 
         listening to it mixed in with other stuff, then you got this big gap in 
         play. Anyway, enjoy

**Note 2: Very different from the hidden track version on Dosage.
