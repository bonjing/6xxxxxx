,irfan1990,2011-03-13T23:36Z,what is activation key can any one tell me pleassssssee
,ntongh2o,2011-03-13T23:50Z,"It's only good to play once considering the game length and content, there's no multiplayer or DLC. It was only sold for $10 so don't expect much. Supposedly made in under 6 months too. You can tell it's not a retail game when you play it."
,ntongh2o,2011-03-13T23:51Z,You don't use a key you copy the skidrow stuff into your installation folder - it's on the ISO
