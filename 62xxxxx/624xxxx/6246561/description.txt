Some Van Halen tunes.
The band when it was a cover band playing songs of Aerosmith, Led Zeppilen, ZZ Top,and others.
The albums/sets may not be complete.
Be warned that some of the tracks are audience recorded and therefore low quality.

These were converted long ago, so there is a chance that a newer HiDef conversion has been pushed. (If so please post torrent link in comment, thanks)

Let me know if this torrent should hang about or be trashed.
