,Flogan,2011-03-15T08:40Z,"Dude, its the US version. U know the good version :)"
,Quad-K,2011-03-15T09:26Z,"The uk version is still good, i just cant stand the accents, no offense :)"
,cjolwd,2011-03-15T23:13Z,"Yes Quad-K, heaven forbid someone speaks in a proper english, it drives me mad too.

,NeutralGold,2011-03-16T02:04Z,"Holy cow... I didn't even know there was a US version... I started watching the Euro version about 3 weeks ago and watched all of Season 1 and the Pilot in a day or two. I watched the first episode of season 2. To be honest I'm a little bit of a TV show freak. I watch a lot of stuff and this show is a little bit boring to me but I liked it enough to keep watching. 

But now that I know there's a US version I'm gonna have to check it out. 

Sorry for the confusion eztv on my part and thanks for the heads up Flogan."
,NeutralGold,2011-03-16T02:05Z,"oh and sorry when I said ""this show"" I was talking about the Euro version. "
,NeutralGold,2011-03-16T02:08Z,"BTW I don't mind the Euro Accent's. It's nice to watch stuff with a proper english accent rather than an American like myself acting. You can tell a difference. 

If you guys haven't watched ""Misfits"" you should really give it a shot. That show is so freaking hilarious. It's a euro show and I've not laughed so hard in a long time. "
,Moynes,2011-03-16T03:33Z,hey cjowld just because someone has an english accent doesn't make it proper english...... we speak the same language moron
