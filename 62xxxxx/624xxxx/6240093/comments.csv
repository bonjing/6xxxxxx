Using the disaster in Japan to further your psychotic agenda is the lowest of the low.

Fuck off you swine."

now, i seriously have to ask, did you even bother to LOOK at any of them?  there are MANY fake videos, such as commercials and videos that only say to go to a website to view the video, was even some videos of people on a camping trip.  there are DOZENS of duplicate videos that are just different resolutions of the same feed.  there's also videos that are just people's youtube broadcasts of them talking about the earthquake.  there's quite a few videos which were made from people pointing a digital camera at a tv showing a news broadcast when those news broadcasts are already in the collection of videos.

i downloaded all three of your torrents totaling 219 videos.
after about an hour of work, i'm already down to 124 videos.
that's almost 100 videos that were fake or duplicate."

Over 90% is redundant."
