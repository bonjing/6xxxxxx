That said, this book can help you get started if the thought of public speaking makes you hungry for two Big Macs, i.e., makes you nervous. The chapters are laid out nicely, guiding you through the various components of giving a speech as well as techniques on how to control your emotions. What I found most beneficial was the part on preparation. I was always too lazy to prepare and my instinct was to improvise, but this book showed me how to overcome that tendency and think about what I was going to say.

In all earnest, you don't need to read this book or any other book to become proficient in public speaking, but if a book helps you calm down and gather your courage, this book should be on your shelf.
