This DLCs pack AUTOMATICALLY installs patch and crack 1.01
----------------------------------------------------------

Crack has been modified to provide access to bonus items.


New installer is built on a much more complicated script to provide a proper automatic installation. I've tested it many times, but just in case - report any problems if you'll encounter any.


Oh, yeah, forgot to tell - this is still a Beta patch.






Readme copied from previous torrent:

------------------------------------


Ok, this is a repack of all existing Dragon Age 2 DLCs. It contains:


- Black Emporium
- Pre-Order Bonus Items
- Signature Edition Items
- The Exiled Prince

(Isaac's armor from Dead Space 2 is obviously included too).



IMPORTANT NOTES (yes, important, so read):


* Everything is cracked for you, you only need to press "Install";

* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list;

* Installing a new patch or a different crack WILL disable DLC bonus items, because accessing them requires hacking "DragonAge2.exe" file, and as you know, patches and cracks replace this file.

Feel free to share this everywhere you can and want. You shouldn't have any problems, but just in case, report anything.

Oh, and the usual warning: Comodo, ClamAV, and probably Avira may detect any and all my installers as viruses. I don't know why, and I don't care. There are no 
viruses, and have never been any.
