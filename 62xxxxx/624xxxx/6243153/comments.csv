,Jared87,2011-03-14T23:14Z,"Illiria, you are awesome. MANY thanks. I'm astouned that you haven't received a skull icon by your name yet. :) 

Yes, there will continue to be more patches, more cracks, and more DLC for this game, and we are going to need to re-do this every time... but such is the life of a pirate, and this is BY FAR THE BEST DLC TORRENT for DA2 as of right now. Thanks again. 

P.S. I predict at least 2 ""SEED!"" posts will immediately follow this..."

,illiria,2011-03-14T23:51Z,"@ x1Black1x

I don't release cracks, just modify them to be compatible with DLC items and include in DLC repack.
If a new crack won't be compatible by default, sure, I'll look into it."
,chip211,2011-03-15T00:13Z,thank you finally i can save and also thanks for the DLC
,illiria,2011-03-15T01:08Z,"@ Chisato

If you only knew how many things my installers do. They patch files, copy, delete, execute commands - stuff you'll never see beyond the simple progress bar. :) So yeah, if I wanted to nuke your computers, I could simply do that with a set of commands and scripts. :)
Unfortunately, the more complicated installer is, the easier it is to make a mistake. That's why I ask to report any problems."
,illiria,2011-03-15T02:26Z,"@ Chisato

Not just ""addins"". It first copies patch and crack to temp folder, then copies the DLCs to game folder, then runs the patch from temp and installs it silently, then copies crack from temp folder, then deletes these files from temp, coz they are no longer needed.

That is why, I suppose, Avira, ClamAV and Comodo detect my installers as viruses. They often do a lot of crap behind user's back. But all that crap is needed for proper installation."

,illiria,2011-03-15T07:53Z,"@ fatshinobi

No real suggestions... My installer detects game path from the registry, but if you're using a repack, you may be missing that registry key. In other words - did you make sure you've installed it in the right location (game directory)?"
,mushi123,2011-03-15T10:09Z,"ty for this! :D

+1 for you 

ps. how to use the stone man and how to get the signature edition and pre order item?

thx in advance"
,illiria,2011-03-15T11:11Z,"@ mushi123

I don't think the stone man can be used at all (you mean in Black Emporium, right?). You get Prince from ""The Exiled Prince"" DLC, and you get dog with ""Black Emporium"". Stone golem is not for use, was never meant to be. It's just a decoration. I was disappointed too.

You can get the items if you go to your (or your uncle's, in first act) house, and there you'll find the ""Special Deliveries"" chest."

@ katie916

Yeah, sorry for false warning with these anti-viruses, I've no idea why they detect even the simplest installers of mine as threats.
I realize it is unpleasant to have a repack that your anti-virus constantly tries to delete, but there is nothing I can do about it at the moment.

I will create some simple installer and send to these companies for testing, so they can remove the false detection, but I REALLY don't have the time for it now."

,illiria,2011-03-18T15:12Z,"@ zottffssen

You do not need to install this version. The only difference from my previous torrent, is that Patch 1.01 was included. This is a PC ONLY patch. If you are playing on Mac, just use my previous torrent, because the patch is NOT for Mac anyway. Other than that, everything else is the same.

@ Quiksilver_One

Your problem is ABSOLUTELY unrelated to my pack.

First - my pack does not include ""daorigins.exe"" file at all;
Second - it detects installation path from ""Dragon Age *2*"" registry key - it could not possibly mistake game locations.

Whatever the problem is, either you made some mistake, or whatever programs for DA:O you have been using. As I said - completely unrelated to my DLC pack."

,illiria,2011-03-18T16:13Z,"Ok, I've researched on Ring of Whispers. So far there is no reliable way to crack it. The only ways are to hack your profile, and to use a mod that unlocks the items.

Problem is - both don't work for me, and may very well not work for you. If I'll include these, then at least half of the users may/will start reporting all sorts of problems.
Especially it will affect the users that bought legitimate copy of the game. Hacking their profile or using such mods (which are likely ineffective unless you hack your profile anyway) will lead them to a ban from BioWare.

********************

To make a long story short - as I said - so far there are no reliable ways to crack the Ring of Whispers. You may Google for it and see if anything works out for you, but I will not put my DLC Pack in jeopardy by using something which is likely not to work, or lead to really bad consequences for legitimate users.
I won't do it for a single ring, anyway.
Sorry.

As soon as there is a reliable way to get it here (EXE hacking, likely), I will."

Norton?? I'm using Norton (Symantec, actually, but it's from same developer and uses same virus definitions). It doesn't detect it as a virus. o_O Shit, this is really bad. If my own anti-virus will start complaining at my own repacks, this will be very bad...
If this will start happening, I'll unleash Hell on Symantec."
,illiria,2011-03-18T16:18Z,"@ Rucklier

It won't conflict with your already installed DLCs. It will overwrite them - but with same DLC files. Like re-installation."

Just updated my Symantec and Norton (I have both on different computers) - both did not detect anything. I don't know what did they do in Norton 360 2011, but the rest of Nortons don't detect anything - even with latest virus definition files.

Also hurrah! I just scanned my other installer and got 0/ 42 on VirusTotal!

I'm afraid you'll have to reconsider. I've passed the game two times (I'm modding it, have to) after that patch and crack, and didn't crash once. Seriously.

I suggest you to include words ""maybe"" and ""probably"" in your next statement, because if the game crashed a few times for you, it does not yet mean it will crash for the rest of the world.

First off MAJOR props for being so on top of this and responding! I've been tryin to get the RELOADED release installed and running on my Mac book Pro for the last few hours but I've run into numerous snags.

I mounted and installed the ISO no prob. When I went to start a new game, I didn't get past the load screen. The whole thing froze up and wouldn't budge. After some reading around I figured it was to do with the graphics bug so I checked my drivers and they were all solid. I ended up patching the game and trying to find a lone crack for 1.01 out there but cant. 

Basically! I'm reinstalling the game right now to get a clean start, so my question for you is... how can I use -your- patch/crack/dlc bundle kit of awesome and win to update my game on my mac?

I install everything correctly and when I go to play it I can't seem to get past the BIOWARE sign in the intro.

Any Suggestions?"

,KidSmooth,2011-03-27T13:33Z,"Ummm, Im confused lol...

Did the install, there was no errors, everything went fine...the game has been updated, but now I'm getting the  EA games activation screen, and it wont let me play until I give a valid serial. 

I don't think the cracked worked, or something. 

whats up?"
,Lorkken,2011-03-27T16:33Z,Works like a charm for me.Tnx for compilation.
,Fendtx,2011-03-28T13:00Z,"I installed the Reloaded Dragon Age - version and played a few times. Then I found this, installed it and tested it. Black Emporium and Exciled Prince does work but the items won't show up in the chest in the house. Any solutions to this problem?"

,AtotehZ,2011-03-28T15:20Z,This works perfectly. People who can't make this work either fail to patch the right folder or are trying to patch a wrong installation/version.

,Tomdog420,2011-03-28T17:39Z,"Thank you, very nice setup.  For those of you having issues with the EA screen, you have to replace the .exe with the cracked one, at least I did.

The only issue I'm having is I walked through the quests available to me in about 20 minutes, is this all there is?"

,Fallerup,2011-03-29T14:43Z," @ illiria 

yeah, maybe I should have included the word ""may"" in my comment, as in, ""the game may crash"" and so on. I'm just speaking from personal experience with this. For me, it does crash sometimes, but not often. finished the game 4 times now and I've had around 2 crashes pr. game, so it's not so bad. The only thing I said, it wasn't perfect. Maybe it won't be like that for everyone, maybe it will.

as for the game it self, it's horribly bugged, especially if you use awakening save, I would recommend using origins ones, especially if you played rogue in your save (Not gonna say why, because that would be a spoiler), but it has to do with a certain NPC that you need to look for, that quest doesn't show up and you get ""a fool's gold"" quest instead. There are a few other quests that are bugged as well.

so use origins save for a perfect (as near perfect as possible) experience."
,illiria,2011-03-30T07:28Z,"@ OrangeForest 

Save data can't be loaded because the required patch is missing? Hm, I know that this issue stands for. You install a patch or DLC, then you remove it, and you get the message.

Also happens if you use some mods. Of if you use some different DLC unlockers before (then ones I did not include here coz I consider them not reliable enough).

Anyway, check the game for something it had before, and lacks now. Be it a patch (1.01 Final, for example, I use Beta here, but they are the same), DLC or a mod.
Or just reinstall."

After installing dlc, load an older save and you'll be able to play Emporium. If you try to play after ending the game, they don't work. Unable to read the letter on the desk that trigger the quest. "

I Can't Summon the Mabari Dog
& 
(I'm unsure of this - I got a quest about 'The Exiled Prince' when I got to the chantry board, I saw him, but as I got closer he just disappeared. Was that just an bug, or will he appear later on in the game?)

I did that, and..
I may have lost all the signature edition items. 
Everything works as before & I kept  ""The Exiled Prince"" DLC.
