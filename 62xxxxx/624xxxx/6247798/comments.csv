,atomic666,2011-05-27T05:41Z,am i the only person that had issues with this torrent? it was corrupted multiple times while downloading (i had to keep re-forcing it) and then pretty much every song skipped.
,atomic666,2011-05-27T05:44Z,"ok forget about the skipping thing. but yeah, while downloading it got corrupted and stopped itself life 5 times"
,bob.lb,2011-05-30T03:36Z,Almost more trackers than songs! O.o
,CameroSaurusRex,2011-06-03T21:10Z,"Atomic, I have downloaded the torrent once again and I've had no problems. Sometimes if you are using a wireless network data can be lost within the transfer, so this may cause your torrent to fail the hashcheck and appear corrupt. Also, you should run a virus scan to check for a virus attacking your filesystem, if you do not have an anti-virus program, I would suggest Malware-Bytes, as it free and powerful. Hope this helps

,bayplar,2011-07-31T00:00Z,"Dude, almost 250 MB of your torrent are the same files with an extra .bc! extension, why would you do that? Endgame and Appeal to reason are in good quality but everything else isn't. I highly reccomend you go and download the rest of the disks (If you care about quality) here:

,sk1dawg,2012-06-18T23:07Z,"when the torrent is downloaded, are all of the songs organized by album? or are they just the songs?"
