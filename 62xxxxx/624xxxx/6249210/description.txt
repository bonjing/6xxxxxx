        You can't die twice.

        A missing  teenager, mysteriously  resurfacing long  after his
        disappearance. A  fractured family,  welcoming him  home after
        years of  anguish. An  awkward reunion,  where tensions simmer
        beneath the surface. A  loved one has returned,  but something
        clearly is not right. One determined FBI agent senses that the
        boys story does not quite fit. But if he is who he says, what
        is the family hiding?  And if he is  not, then who is  he, and
        why  is  everyone playing  along?  As pieces  of  a mysterious
        puzzle are put together, an unveiled past will reveal deep and
        dark secrets.
