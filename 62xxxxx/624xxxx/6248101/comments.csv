and movie is great!"
,scottsasse,2011-05-15T23:22Z,"THANKS pluto, I've downloaded quite a few of your torrents lately and have not been disappointed yet. Love the small file size so I can quickly check out a movie and if it's a keeper then I'll download a 4GB version. But for 500MB file size your rips are the ""schizznit"" and most importantly your audio quality is much better than most other small small file conversions. THANKS again and THANKS to all you proper seeders out there!! Lotta Love, DrScott"
