                       SUPERSTITION 1982 DVDRIP
                       ------------------------

In the same vein as Suspiria, but THIS EVIL IS UNSTOPPABLE!

This film also concerns a witch or "daughter of Satan" who was executed by drowning in a pond, as it was customary that witches were afraid of water during those ages...

Years later the witch's curse still looms about the place were she was killed. This place is been used now as a lovers lane by teens.

Some kids playing a prank on some love-lorn teens are the first ones to face the wrath of the witch. Soon the Rev. David Thompson (James Houghton) is called in to investigate.

But will he be able to stop this evil? It is for you to find out.

Excellent special effects and background music. The acting is adequate for a horror film. Those of you who are squeamish and faint of heart shouldn't watch this film alone.

An interesting film for your horror movies collection.
