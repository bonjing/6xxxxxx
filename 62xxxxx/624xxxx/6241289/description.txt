                          By The Name Of Allah

Allah is above the seven heavens far from His creation but with them wherever they are cognizant of them, their deeds and hearts. This is explained through given evidences from Quran and sunnah. Allah rose above the throne which contradicts the void creed of the Ash'arites and those agree with them that Allah is everywhere by His self.
