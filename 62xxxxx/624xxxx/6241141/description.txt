Music Videos : Rock : DVD quality
Here are a couple dvd's I picked up as Christmas gifts over the years. Hawkwind LIVE. The first is "Night of The Hawks" live 1984 at The Gaumont Theatre, Ipswich, UK. The second is "Classic Rock Legends" live in 1990. Not sure about the venue, but it's a nice trippy few hours of The Hawks! NTSC vts/vob files. Menus preserved, untouched. Enjoy!
