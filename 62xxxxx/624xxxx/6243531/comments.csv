[T],MelloYello,2011-03-15T04:05Z,There are avi's available why are you donwloading files you don't like?  It takes like 5 seconds to turn the rar's into a avi file.
,flame_,2011-03-15T04:44Z,"@chair_tard: splitting to rar files and adding error checking file is not for us p2p people, but for the scene (the guys who capture, encode and distribute these in the first place). They use automated bots to distribute their works over the ftp, which as far as i know lacks proper error checking. With this rars+sfv method the transfer could be fully automated and be more reliable.

In fact, without these we'd probably never see a release like this out here. P2P is not the primary target/channel; we just get some good stuff as an aside. So like it or not: rar splitting is here to stay. If you so dislike it then wait for a guy/group who unpack it and puts it up as one file. The user ""eztv"" for instance is doing it nicely."
