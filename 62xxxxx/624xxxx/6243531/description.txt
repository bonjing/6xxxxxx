"Out of the Chute"

A young professional champion bullfighter is 
admitted for treatment after being attacked 
by a bull. After conducting multiple 
inconclusive tests, the team enlists House's 
advice outside of the hospital while he 
attends to a few issues away from the case. 
Back in the hospital, the bullfighter's 
condition continues to worsen, but with 
disappearing symptoms and the patient's more 
frequent mini-seizures, the team's last 
option is risky open-heart surgery. 
Meanwhile, Masters develops a crush on their 
bullfighter patient much to Taub's surprise.

Enjoy :)
