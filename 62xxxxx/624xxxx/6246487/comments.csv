[T],program3r,2011-03-16T21:23Z,PSP can't run m4v.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T21:32Z,"you are wrong, stop posting nonsense."
[T],program3r,2011-03-16T21:52Z,Ok but how about subs. SRT can't be used with PSP.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T22:18Z,i didn't claim it could.  srt is only provided for advanced user who want to use SRT in another method such as muxing contents to mkv.
[T],program3r,2011-03-16T22:26Z,"I'm VERY SRY 4 that. I wouldn't bother you again.
I've just realise that i need to use pmpplayer.
So forgive me. And Thank you very much 4 your work."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T22:47Z,don't know what that is.  all my release play native on psp without any hacks or modifications.
,YOURDREAMMEC,2011-03-16T23:02Z,i'm guessing we won't get Harry Porter :(
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T23:38Z,Harry Porter?  probably no.  PT did all harry potter though.
,kian89,2011-03-17T14:29Z,PT??
,thefan23,2011-03-17T21:45Z,kian: PT is poppedtart did the boxset of 1-6. we should wait till part 2 comes out so we can see both.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-18T06:16Z,PT already did HP like I said.  not going to dupe it as the outcome would be identical.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-18T12:57Z,"i'm confused :(

yes, i'll probably upload HP 7, but I dont have plans to upload HP 1-6 at this time."
,wildkru,2011-03-22T07:02Z,@holyRoses:which encoder u use ?handbrake?
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-22T14:21Z,ffmpeg
,Takamine6,2011-03-23T05:11Z,"Thank you so much, Holy Roses. You do great work. I was wondering if you might know how I could boost my volume when I transfer movies to psp. It is hard to get volume out of the psp when playing movies. Thanks again for you great work. I always look for your name and seed as much as I can."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-23T15:21Z,I already boost it by 10db.  I know psp is crap audio for some reason.  If i boost it anymore it will just get distorted for everyone.  Use headphones is all i can say.
[V],poppedtart,2011-04-12T00:55Z,? :(
,papa43,2011-06-12T04:49Z,works great when you use audio/video cable for psp on your big screen thanks holyroses
