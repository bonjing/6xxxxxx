,minychit,2011-03-21T08:43Z,Has anybody tried this yet?
,Duardo,2011-03-21T15:17Z,"Yes it works perfectly
because CyberPiraten is a boss"
,minychit,2011-03-21T17:38Z,"i have a slight problem
Ive tried downloading this already and used another serial that diddnt work.( but another torrent)
When i run the .toast it doesnt even ask for a serial probably because i already inserted for the other one....
How do i make it go back and let me put the serial included in this torrent??
thanks for all"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-03-22T08:38Z,"Delete the file ""Final Cut Studio System ID"" from /Library/Application
Support/ProApps/  This should cause Final Cut Pro to re-register and ask for
the serial number again. "
,TijmenDal,2011-03-22T23:11Z,"It doesn't work for me. Halfway through the installation it just aborts and that's it. No report or something.
I followed all instructions... really weird. Some would be appreciated. I'm on 10.6.6, but will be upgrading today as I just saw 10.6.7 was released."
,Duardo,2011-03-23T06:10Z,"Most likely because you are trying to install Applications you do not have. I do believe all of them are Livetype, Final Cut Pro, and compressor. Basic math will be very beneficial if it says installing 50GBs of software and you downloaded 3.48 GBs of data, something is very wrong. If you hit install and add it up and install 3.48 everything will work perfect. 

This is NOT a full Final Cut Studio just the cool parts. 

Big Thanks to CyberPiraten for the upload,"
,minychit,2011-03-23T08:55Z,"Thanks cyberpiraten
Except that file isnt there...
Ive checked my other libraries aswell but nothing...
really weird"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-03-23T09:55Z,You just need to uncheck te check boxes cause you only got Final Cut but not the others. 
,minychit,2011-03-23T16:27Z,"Yes i read your installation advice but i have been doing that every time. I need to find a way to put your serial in but i cant find that file so that i can reregister. I think the serial is for another version of final cut pro so it doesnt work.
It tells me the installation has failed each time."
,minychit,2011-03-23T16:30Z,"i always uncheck everything except final cut.
I just need to find that file so that i can reregister... i just dont know where to find it.
I downloaded another torrent before this one and used a serial that didnt work... so now im stuck with that one until i delete it..."
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-03-23T20:12Z,Have you uninstalled it first? Don't really know about that.. But try googeling it or you can write a thred at suprbay.
,minychit,2011-03-28T22:19Z,"arghh wrote a thread on suprbay and no one is replying yet...
I have a feeling my problem is unique lol"

I have FC6 from earlier, does that mather in anyway?"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-03-29T22:02Z,Try uninstalling the previous version then :) 
,yap_toshi,2011-03-30T06:21Z,"Hi,

I'm having this problem can I do something about it?  â€¢ Final Cut Studio Installer requires that your system have 128 MB of VRAM; this system has only 64 MB of VRAM.
 Thanks"
,gr8motive,2011-03-30T09:27Z,"Cyber, are u just assuming, or do u know it, because if youre not sure ill rather keep my old vers than nothing, and since it takes amount of time to install i just wanna know if thats the reason ;)"
,nicoleruo,2011-03-30T12:35Z,"hi cyberpiraten, i have finally download this app, but is the serial number out of the date? since it keeps saying that the SN is invalid.  SOS ... :)"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-03-30T14:27Z,"@yap_toshi 
You need to upgrade your Video RAM, might cost you a little :)

,ragefresh,2011-04-02T06:05Z,"Hey quick question, I got the serial to work and unchecked all of the boxes except for the Final Cut Pro Box.

Please help me with this. I have a 64 bit macbook pro 4gig ram plenty of harddrive n such"
,ragefresh,2011-04-02T06:26Z,"Ok I got it to work now, soooo nvm :D thanks

@TiJmenDal what you have to do is, even though you uncheck everything but finalcut pro, Click ALL of the arrows so they drop down, a few of them have hidden boxes that remain checked. So click the arrows and uncheck EVERYTHING

once again Thank you Cyberpiraten, I will check out the after effects torrent next "

,DalittleBIGmen,2011-04-13T08:14Z,"@Shonyc, first you need to download a torent download program such as transmission or xtorrent. Both pretty good. I prefer transmission cuz its simple interface, and you can select which files to download easily. 

Download the .torrent. Do not open it. Second click the file and go to get info. Un the menu select Open with-> choose the program you chose. Then click Change All and there you go.

Gor easy acces go to preferences and choose automatically check download folder and delete torrent files. 

Hope it helps. "
,Syllith,2011-04-14T04:15Z,For those of you having trouble at the installation screen (It says it fails) you need to uncheck all the boxes at the installation type screen except for Final Cut. Then hit install and it should work perfectly. Saves a ton of space to. Like 55 gigs
,alexstudio117,2011-04-16T08:53Z,"After installation, it took ages to scan all my audio plugins, i have removed those that were causing problems, but now I get a crash report regarding KGCore plugin, that is actually a framework inside the final cut application itself. What can I do about that ? "

Also, if anyone is having trouble because they didn't unclick the boxes, you have to download a Final Cut Remover program to wipe out all the old files (you pretty much can't do this on your own), then you can re-install it. It is really quick and easy. I recommend this one:
