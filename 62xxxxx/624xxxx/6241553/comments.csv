,johnyrotten69,2011-03-31T10:48Z,"I installed only Crysis so far cause I couldn't get that to work at first. but I finally was able to make it work by doing the following:

- move the cracked Crysis.exe to the Crysis\Bin64 folder
- then right click it and go to properties
-select the ""Compatibility"" tab
-check the ""Compatibility Mode"" box
-from the drop-down menu select Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) 
-BE SURE TO HIT the APPLY BUTTON

The game is working perfectly for me. "
,tenshi_musha,2011-04-01T13:27Z,"yeah,my bad.forgot about the compatibility part.thanks johnnyrotten!"
,Bubblegummypop,2011-04-03T19:49Z,"I can't get it to install,after clicking the autorunCD.exe and the install that appears afterwards  on the menu.I tried doing what johnyrotten said but I get a Could not launch main application! message.If you could help it'd be nice, I currently have windows 7 home premium 64 bits."
,tenshi_musha,2011-04-08T00:08Z,you didnt copy the crack over.put the crack in the install folder and overwrite the existing application with it.then run it in compatibility mode
,some-little-smart-brown-g,2011-10-22T16:53Z,"sorry for bothering you tenshi, but could you seed this again? there aren't any seeders left."

,tenshi_musha,2011-12-06T23:57Z,"not to sound noobish,but whats the easiest way to reseed?recreate the torrent?"
