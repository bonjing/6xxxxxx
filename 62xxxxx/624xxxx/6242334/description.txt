This is a dutch version (so the image is not from my version) of the 1999 Monopoly Board Game for PC.



1. Mount the image 
2. Install
3. Make a shortcut to your desktop and quit your mount tool. There's no need for a crack and you don't need to mount the image before playing!  


 

Have fun and seed for others (I think dutch people......)!
