Hi Pirates!

Destruction Derby 2 is a well known arcade game from the late 90s. 
Better graphics, physics and more tracks.
Truly a classic game.
For old school gamers it is a must have!

There are 2 ways to play with the game.

1. Dosbox (there are tutorials on youtube)
2. Turn off hardware acceleration. There are several faqs about this on the internet. Just google it. (as I know in most of the cases it doesn't work under Vista or 7)

Have fun :)
