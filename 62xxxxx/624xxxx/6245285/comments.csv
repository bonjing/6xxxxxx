,SCVanguard,2011-03-17T05:31Z,"Awesome...I used to play this game religiously back in the day!

Slight problem...I've put the files from the torrent into my ""oldgames"" folder on the C: drive but I can't figure out how to mount them into doxbox.  Any help?"
,POOSTANEPALETTE,2011-04-24T17:31Z,"this torrent does not work, when you install it, it barely installs anything and asks you for the CD when you try to run it, even though its mounted already 

waste of time here guys "
,Kordovaner,2011-04-26T07:03Z,"It does work! Under xp and vista the install runs just how it should. Under win7 I had compatibility issues. I've clicked on install after mount, and nothing happened for 2-3 minuters but after that the a window popped out with a compatibility error. I clicked on x and then I was able to install the game. I guess you need to change compatibility to xp\98.
There is another way to play with the game. Just install microsoft virtual pc. Load xp on you vista\win7 under virtual pc and then you'll be able to play. Dosbox is a bit more complicated, you can google it. "
,POOSTANEPALETTE,2011-05-01T21:40Z,"well, i downloaded dosbox and tried to run the game, got it running and its all fucked up, like the resolution isn't correct. I actually very rarely find a game that i cant run so this torrent is not very good, im just saying "
,sumguy65,2011-06-08T13:52Z,"ive downloaded this and i only have 3 files
DD2_PC.img
DDC_PC.sub
DD2.cdd

all dosbox things i have read says there needs to be a .exe .com or something else file. HELP?"
,Kordovaner,2011-06-10T20:37Z,"I see what is the problem. I have the original disk and Im using win7. When Im running the install on the original disk the setup runs fine, but when im trying to do this with a mounted iso or a different image file it fails. Can't figure out what the heck is wrong. I've created several types of images and all of them has this issue. Keep in mind that this game is very old as well as the cd.
What Im going to do is install the game on my pc, and create an image of that and I will include the original files of the cd as an image file because of the music. 
Is this method proper for you guys?
I need some feedback as well."
,Kordovaner,2011-06-10T22:57Z,"Finally I've made a proper, working iso. I'm going to delete this torrent and reupload the working one again. I guess I'll spend time with this on monday. "
,Mavlar,2011-11-02T20:49Z,"You ok? Pal just wonderd if you can mount this on any virtual drive, i have magic cd, will deffinatly seed for a good few weeks used to love the game lol!! "
,simplymuh,2012-06-22T20:42Z,Why can't you just make it so it mounts easily. This dos box shit is pissing me off.
