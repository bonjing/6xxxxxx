,DJR3D51GN,2011-03-22T02:13Z,"A: 9 (telesync innit)
v: 6 (has been zoomed presumably to adjust for cam video quality is blurry in some places and over exposed but very watchable)

titles are in an eastern european language i think but pretty self explanatory, easily the best version i can find atm. no rars either. im using gom player so i can adjust the exposure levels manually its a great bit of software highly recommended for cams and ts"
,DJR3D51GN,2011-03-22T22:48Z,This is definately a TS ... cam video with synced sound thus the 9/10 rating i gave for the audio ...
