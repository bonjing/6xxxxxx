I uploaded 436 BBC Horizon episodes on Demonoid which is a bit bigger than this torrent, but divided up into 9 seprate torrents, each about 30GB.. thanks..? I guess.. it's in English too I suspect.. and I'm guessing this is NOT the History Channel version of the same title (The Universe).. the first few episodes don't match up what I have in my archives anyway."
