I am sure you can find more copies if you know where to look. :)"
,nittany,2011-03-17T06:36Z,"Downloading now, will comment back sometime on the quality.  The DVD rip of this movie I downloaded a few days ago had hard coded Korean subtitles...which means it got instantly deleted after wasting my bandwidth.

Hopefully this one is fine.  What does the ""RC"" in the torrent name mean?"
,DrScrat,2011-03-17T15:12Z,I believe the 'RC' is for ReCoded. That's how the BlueRay DVD is 'compressed' to 2.26 GB.
,DrScrat,2011-03-17T15:22Z,"Sorry, forgot BluRay have a different Region Coding (and its been a long night).

    * Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus the Republic of China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan and Korea.
    * Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.
    * Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as the People's Republic of China and Russia.

So RC basically is Russia (probably Romania also since subtitles are that language) and China"
