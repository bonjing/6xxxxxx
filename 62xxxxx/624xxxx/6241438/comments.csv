With chok dee nit noy, it will work OK now.

Will let you know after I have downloaded and tried it.

Thanks again."
,SDguy,2011-03-17T08:33Z,"Sorry to say, but this has the same fault as the original. No matter what I use to watch it or burn it, the screen freezes at 1-hour 40-minutes and 14-seconds.

With luck, it will be a single faulty frame or two that I can edit out.

Will try that and let you know how it goes.

If anyone else has any ideas, I'd be really grateful."

If there is any chance that someone could just upload a full coy of Disc#1, we would be really grateful.

Thanks for reading.
