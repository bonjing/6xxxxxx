,gate2padfoot,2011-03-14T17:43Z,"hey buddy, can u upload it again in 720p???"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-14T18:36Z,"@gate2padfoot: All three parts have been encoded and uploaded many times from 2007. in all possible formats, and re-upload makes no sense. Out there is gazillion of 720p encodes. And these have not -1000 as my encodes lately - therefore presumably are much better than mine, buddy."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-14T18:38Z,"Have you understood REQUESTS ARE ""FROZEN"" or just are fucking illiterate."
,hkoraddi,2011-03-14T22:39Z,thank you.
,silveroakleaf,2011-03-15T01:43Z,"20-40, you outdid yourself again, thanks!  I just downloaded these in 720 to encode the trilogy myself and you beat me to it... WITH subs!! Thanks again.

All you ass-clowns that don't like (or appreciate) these encodes and the work they represent, go somewhere else."

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-16T07:53Z,"@hazel13: No problem. Regarding HP 7, I did TS maybe five months ago. Since then, only two PayPerView rips appeared, both really crappy, with problematic sound too and I decided not to touch them than to wait for BluRay or DVD - and I am still waiting..."
