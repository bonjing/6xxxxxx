I found this book to be a fantastic history of the oil industry and an interesting, thoughtful perspective on the not-so-dismal future of petroleum. I've read about 20 books on energy over the past two years. For me, this one ranks a close second to Vaclav Smil's "Energy at the Crossroads: Global Perspectives and Uncertainties"; ("Age of Oil", however, is much better suited for a general audience). I found it scholarly, logical, and pragmatic. I think readers will appreciate how Maugeri unravels the complex world of oil prices, economic, political and geological impact on exploration/production, and the mysteries of reserves accounting. At $49, the book is expensive, but I think it's worth the price to anyone who's interested in the history of and prognosis for oil. I read it in two nights and found it well worth the money.
