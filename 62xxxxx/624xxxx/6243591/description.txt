"Turnabout"

Still reeling from the attack in Alaska, 
President Martinez (Blair Underwood) 
reasserts control over the situation and 
his administration, counseled by Sterling 
(Zeljko Ivanek) and his Chief of Staff 
(guest star Roger Bart, "Desperate 
Housewives"). Sophia (Laura Innes) learns 
the details of Thomas's murderous 
rampage. Thomas (Clifton Collins, Jr.) 
sets Sophia and Martinez further at odds. 
Elsewhere, Michael (Scott Patterson) 
leaves Leila (Sarah Roemer) in safe-
keeping with a close friend, Diane Geller 
(guest star Gabrielle Carteris, "Beverly 
Hills, 90210"), while he goes on the hunt 
for Thomas. The NSA continues to decrypt 
the satellite transmission, hopefully 
before it's too late.

Enjoy :)
