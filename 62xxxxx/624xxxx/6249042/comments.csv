Islam is the most violent and self centred religion on the planet today. Strange how Islam stems from one of the most war torn areas of the world wher leaders will wipe out entire villages based on a tribal feud that dates back centuries."
,freeze889,2011-03-17T07:17Z,"Ishaq:327 “Allah said, ‘A prophet must slaughter before collecting
captives. A slaughtered enemy is driven from the land. Muhammad, you craved the desires
of this world, its goods and the ransom captives would bring. But Allah desires killing them
to manifest the religion.’”
Think about this!!!"
,sarsapil,2011-03-17T08:12Z,"Islam is THE ONLY religion that if you convert to another religion, according to sharia law, you should be killed, thus denying a basic human right... That makes it a barbaric and despicable religion."
,ekarth22,2011-03-17T09:06Z,"the extreme low number of seeder and leechers, alone sufficient to explain Islam's popularity amongst internet users."
,beowoulfe,2011-03-17T11:44Z,"There are many peaceful suras in the koran, but out of mohammad's own mouth they are no longer relevant.

Many sites reveal the ""not-talked-about-agenda"" of muslims, but this site was especially a good read for me: http://www.citizenwarrior.com/2010/07/but-there-are-peaceful-passages-in.html"

,sarsapil,2011-03-21T16:22Z,"The stupid attempts at replying by muslims here show you gotta be a retard to join islam, it's shameful that some blacks who were slaves sign up to this religion of SUBMISSION so they become slaves again... do they have a secret ambiiton to be slaves again? C'mon, brothers, wake up and get out, be free men once and for all..."
,aemalkawi,2011-04-02T04:16Z,"ndeed I respect Prophet Jesus and his religion & let me tell you that if don't then I can't be muslim since thats what our religion orders us. And no you can't judge on islam by the deeds of those, the only way to judge is to learn what this religion orders his followers,,,, can one judge on your entire family by what you do!!!! most families have good and bad members and I cant tell that the family is good or bad unless I meet them all or at least knowing what the family leader order them then it is not his fault that some or all of them did'nt obey 

so can I judge on christian based on what the US army did in Iraq( remember the cross that was hanged on a tank's canon)??Vietnam??japan(2nd WW)?? 
Or the most powerful support for Israel to kill children & elderly & even the inncocent youth in palastine, (& please don't tell me that those who fight for their country are terrorists too),,,of caurse if I do you will be looser but I don't Because I know what is real christianity 

And about the aim of muslims in killing unbelievers!!!!! I think you never read quran, If you did then you will have noticed that It only ask for killing those who try to kill you first, and please look for this sentence in quran Surat Al-MÃ„Â'idah ayah 32(((whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely)))

and this in Surat Al-'An`Ã„Âm ayah 151 (((Say, ""Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason."")))

and please look carefully at this one that tell to fight only those who fight you:
Surat Al-Baqarah, ayah 190 (((Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.)))

please know before you judge on anything

best regards all
Ahmad"
