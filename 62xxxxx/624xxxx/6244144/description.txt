Despite the name this is NOT porn! :)

Various artist compilation from Cooking Vinyl records.  Contains a couple of tracks from Michelle Shocked which are slightly different from the versions on 'Short Sharp Shocked'.

NOTE! Due to a damaged CD the Rory McLeod track (Farewell Welware) is corrupt and does not play properly.  However, I have included it here for completeness.
