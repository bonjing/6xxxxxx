,kpelrine,2011-03-20T18:40Z,Is this the uncensored version?
,Sharak23,2011-04-16T06:12Z,"This shit is censored. When I watched it last night on TV they didnt censor it, so why is the torrent one censored? Lame as shit"
,mufasan,2011-07-07T06:58Z,Thanks! Was a fast DL avg. 2.6mb/s.
,lunchbox1134,2011-09-17T00:41Z,"Sharak23 - what time did you watch it? because if it was after 12am Eastern Time then chances are it was what they used to call the Secret Stash, where they showed uncensored versions of things. this was probably ripped from the first airing, which would have been censored.

it doesn't say anything about being uncensored in the description, so you really can't complain about that because you kinda shouldn't have been expecting it to be uncensored, since it wasn't specified as being such. yup. thanks for the up TvTeam, you guys are great! but alas, i was looking for an uncensored version as well."
