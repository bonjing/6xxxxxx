,Poeticile,2011-03-16T07:14Z,Comment : Is the No Exp fixed? The AP measures taken by Nintendo means you can't level up pokemon. 
,hazdawg11,2011-03-16T08:38Z,You can level up your pokemon. 
,Poeticile,2011-03-17T05:33Z,"Holy crap, then this is some good stuff. "
,Poeticile,2011-03-17T05:42Z,The NoCashGBA doesn't open...
,hazdawg11,2011-03-17T06:01Z,I think you need to have an Intel mac. It works fine on my MacBook Pro 2010.
,hazdawg11,2011-03-17T06:09Z,NoCashGBA opens and runs fine on both my iMac 2009 and my MacBook Pro 2010. I'm not sure if it works with PPC macs.
,Poeticile,2011-03-17T07:20Z,Got it to work - but randomly crashes around Route 2. Help? 
,hazdawg11,2011-03-17T07:25Z,"For the first time, it crashed for me around Route 2. Just save before you get to route 2. If it crashes, continue from where you are and it should not freeze (worked for me)"
,hazdawg11,2011-03-17T07:25Z,"If NoCashGBA does not open, move it to your Applications folder =D"
,Duardo,2011-03-17T13:44Z,If this works you might be the worlds best cyber pirate
,bmml003,2011-03-17T16:23Z,Nothing happens after i hit start on the black version

Great Torrent OP"
,Poeticile,2011-03-18T00:41Z,"Finally got it to work! Thanks for the torrent, hats off to the man who made noCashGba into a Wine Wrap. "
,Myles22,2011-03-18T01:45Z,"whenever i exit out of the application the cheat gets deleted along with my saved date.

what am i doing wrong :("
,InfiniteSpoils,2011-03-18T04:59Z,"THanks hazdawg for the torrent, but the explanation was very unclear, causing most people to be unable to play. Here is a CLEAR step by step instruction:
1. Unarchive the file.(just double click, and archive utility should come up)
2. Drag the ""No$GBA"" application inside the ""Pokemon Black & White + No$GBA for MAC - HaZZa"" folder into applications. (this should solve the unable to open application problem)
4. Drag the black and white nds files into ""documents"". (optional, but i recommend it.)
3.Open ""No$GBA""
4.A ""Select  Cartridge"" window should come up. select ""documents"", then click on either game: black or white, depending on what you want to play.
5. After a few seconds, a Nintendo DS emulator should pop up, but with an error of ""cant find save location blah blah blah....."" with a blue background and white font.
6. click on utilities in the DS screen, top left corner.
7. Click cheats. A new window should pop up.
8. click add new.
9.Open the Read me file inside the ""Pokemon Black & White + No$GBA for Mac - HaZZa"" folder
10. copy all of the codes provided inside of the read me, depending on which game u choose.
11. control+v to paste inside the bigger box of the ""Cheats"" window. Then click on the check boxes of ""RAW"" and ""Action Replay DS"". Click ok.
12. Now click on ""file"", which is next to Utilities.
13. Click ""Reset Cartridge""
14. Play!

Hope this helps! Took me awhile to figure out what the Read me instructions meant."
,InfiniteSpoils,2011-03-18T05:04Z,"By the way, everytime u want to play again, all you need to do is select the game. the same error window should come up. THen CLick on cheats. U should see the cheat you created last time. double click the check box. click ok.
Again. u have to do this every time."
,InfiniteSpoils,2011-03-18T05:06Z,"And to save, all you need to do is during the game, press enter. then at the bottom half of the emulator, there is an option called ""save"" should appear, along with ""bag"" ""pokedex"" blah blah blah. click on it with your mouse, and select yes."
,Teumeusseuk,2011-03-18T05:28Z,"Can we get the screen bigger ? xD
thanks ^"
,Poeticile,2011-03-18T08:17Z,"I +2'd 4 times, rofl. "
,C4blacksun,2011-03-18T18:36Z,wont save for me either. every time i quit the emulator i have to retype the codes and start a new game. i saved in game lots of times but it didnt matter.
,Poeticile,2011-03-19T04:03Z,"Hm...same here. Didn't save my game, any help? "
,C4blacksun,2011-03-19T11:29Z,oh wait i got it. you need to move the game file to the documents folder. and when you quit you need to press file and quit on the small emulator screen. if you quit from the No$GBA bar it wont save.
,tapoq2,2011-03-20T12:45Z,"great torrent here pokemon white works perfect after following the read me, just wondering if theres any more action replay codes (such as the ecounter code where you can encounter any pokemon) i tried codejunkies but those codes didnt seem to work"
,phite,2011-03-21T03:05Z,I also am wondering if it is possible to make the screen bigger.
,chadmpiper,2011-03-21T05:27Z,do i have to enter the codes manually?
,chadmpiper,2011-03-21T05:35Z,i try to paste them in but it doesnt work blaah
,Duardo,2011-03-21T06:44Z,"Just to clear things up about the codes, you HAVE to put them in.  
1. open the readme and copy the codes Command + C
2. Open the App and hit your desired game file 
3. Hit Utility> Cheats> Add New
4. Paste in using a right click, Command  + V WILL NOT Work
5. File> Reset Cartridge 
6. ??????
7. Profit

As for the saving problem 
You need to save in-game and then exit the app for it to actually save. If the ROM crashes when you are in game it WILL NOT SAVE, SUCKS TO BE YOU, This is a pretty stable port though, I've seen it happen once after a LONG time so save every so often. You can get mods here http://us.codejunkies.com/search/codes/cheat_codes.aspx?selp=17&game=Pokemon-Black&gameID=17826873&page=0 


Yes they work with both versions, 
Enjoy Guys.

,hazdawg11,2011-03-21T09:57Z,"Sorry for the lack of clear instructions =S this is my first torrent so if you get it to work please comment and if you have any problems, post as a comment. I think for the saving issue you must close the application by clicking the red X instead of Cmd+Q or quitting from the bar. For Pokemon Black codes go here: http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/DS/pokemon_black/action_replay.html and for White go here: http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/DS/pokemon_white/action_replay.html"

,MarkNoyes,2011-03-22T01:41Z,"So, wait. I have to play the game with all the cheats enabled? I am confused."
,MarkNoyes,2011-03-22T02:52Z,"I figured it out. You are able to uncheck the cheat codes.

@phite I changed my monitor's resolution to the lowest setting, which made the emulator almost fullscreen. Not sure if there is a better way to do it."
,Duardo,2011-03-22T05:03Z,"No just the cheat code in the readme that makes the game playable, its not actually a cheat really. You just have to enable it to play."
,phite,2011-03-22T21:22Z,"@Mark
yeah thats what i've been doing it would be nice if there was a better way though"
,goldlukei,2011-03-23T01:08Z,how do i make the game larger?
,Duardo,2011-03-23T06:12Z,"I dont think you can make the game larger, or at least I haven't found a way to yet."
,Aypolo,2011-03-23T08:22Z,"I'm getting a black screen when I hit new game? ( Pokemon black, with cheats enabled, it loads but after I hit new game it goes black)"

""the save data could not be accessed""
Please turn the power off and reinsert the game card.... any idea on how to fix this?"
,jwillybilly,2011-03-24T01:56Z,nvm figured it out you need to go to the cheats and enter the one that needs to be on!
,Duardo,2011-03-24T17:46Z,"''facepalm''
No saved data, I've already explained this. Enter the Cheat Code and go to file> Reset cartridge and you are ready to go"

I checked the cheats, they're fine
someone help me plz?"
,L.amore,2011-04-06T03:34Z,Has anyone come up with a means to turn the sound off?  If you do it in the emulator options the program essentially runs to a halt.  Appreciate any advice.
,jhodes,2011-04-06T04:52Z,One question so far: How I save the game?
,haloisgone,2011-04-06T22:00Z,"Jhodes in order to save the game
press enter to access the menu in game
then choose the save option now in order to truly keep the data quit the emulator after you save.Then reset the game and your save will be there!
btw Warning!!! If the game crashes and you have not saved by quitting the emulator and resetting the game you will lose all unsaved progress!!
I lost about 2 hours so I learned my lesson"
,haloisgone,2011-04-06T22:02Z,"Oh when you quite the emulator
make sure to press file then quit."
,austin99,2011-04-08T22:37Z,"i downloaded it and the emulator says ""save file could not be accessed, please reset the rom"" any help? (i did try reseting the rom)"
,idinvour,2011-04-09T09:45Z,"Great torrent, but how do I use other cheats? I was able to find some other codes, but do I enter them the same way I entered the main ""cheat""?"
,rusty69er,2011-04-10T10:39Z,"great torrent. I dragged the whole folder into applications so the game boy didn't work. You have to have the gameboy icon in the applications separately. that may be some people's problem. 
any way to turn sound off though. i did it through options but it put the speed to 10%"

,luigi636,2011-05-01T05:27Z,"If you're on snow leopard and want to get a bigger ds screen, you can just zoom in with ctrl+scroll up"
,shazzam87,2011-05-02T16:57Z,"Thanks for the torrent, works perfectly. Just one quick question, with the cheats how do you activate the them, as in, some of them happen automatically, such as the full pp and hp at all times, where as the more xp cheat im guessing you have to press a certain key, anyone figured out what it is? Thanks"
,SMEEEEEEEEEEE,2011-05-02T20:22Z,"Thanks for the great torrent, works perfectly . For those of you wondering how to disable the sound without having the program crash to a hault, download the newest version of No$GBA.exe from the site and open it using crossover. You have to enter in the cheat the same way you did with this torrent in order to execute the ROM (you can disable it after the ROM starts). Then in the the 'Options'-> 'Emulation Setup' under 'Sound Output Mode' select None. 

 Also, if you don't want to start from scratch again, locate the No$GBA that you were originally using, right-click the icon and press 'Show Package Contents' then under 'drive_c/Program Files/NoCashGBA/Battery there will be a 'Pokemon Black/White.SAV' file there. Copy that into the 'Battery' folder of the newer No$GBA folder. Hope this helps."
,SMEEEEEEEEEEE,2011-05-02T20:32Z,"Sorry, don't bother with the suggestion I just gave for disabling audio, still crashes upon battling."
,Lldor,2011-05-18T13:35Z,"well i just downloaded it and the emulator aint opening, any suggestions?"

,RasmusDub,2011-05-25T18:03Z,thank you for the torrent good sir
,Shadow868,2011-05-30T03:15Z,"So just a couple questions:

First, is it possible to have to separate games going on at the same time? As in, it's like I'm holding two GBA's instead of one. Primarily so I can trade with myself.

Second, is there a way to have multiple games going with the same game cartridge? Perhaps a save file of some sort that can be moved out of the way to create a new one, and then interchanged based on which game you want to play?

Thanks in advance.

Oh, and awesome torrent!"
,Shadow868,2011-05-30T03:16Z,"Sorry, typo:

...possible to have *two* separate..."
,Shadow868,2011-05-30T03:28Z,"Well after a little bit of exploring, I answered my own question. The second one from my above comment, actually. Follow these steps:

1. Right click the NoCashGBA app
2. Select ""Show Package Contents""
3. Open ""drive_c""
4. Open ""Program Files""
5. Open ""NoCashGBA""
6. Open ""BATTERY""
7. The save file with extension .SAV will be there with the name of the game you're currently playing. You can change the name of the file or move the file out  of the folder; either way, the GBA app will ignore it, allowing you to start a new game without erasing your data.


Still working on the other question, any insight is appreciated..."
,adangarcia619,2011-06-17T05:25Z,"WOOO! I got it to work! 

One question though, Can we play other DS roms on No$GBA? Or black & white are the only ones that work? I don't want to download anything and mess up my app or save file :S"
