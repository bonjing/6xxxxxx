The first patch for Football Manager 2011 (version 11.1.0) was issued on the game\'s release date; one of the main reasons for the patch was to update the ownership details of Liverpool F.C. which had changed hands between the game discs being printed and its release, the financial situation and points deduction at Dundee F.C., as well as other bug fixes.[11][12] Version 11.1.1 followed on 12 November which fixes a number of minor bugs.[13] The third patch, v11.2.0 came available on 16 December which fixed many bugs and improved the Match engine. One day later a \'Hotfix\' became available to fix a bug which didn\'t allow players to continue on their saved game if they were running a Polish League after they had installed the v11.2.0 patch. v11.2.1 is the latest version of the game. v11.3.0 has now been released as of 8 March and includes all World Transfers from the January transfer window, as well as various game fixes.[14]
