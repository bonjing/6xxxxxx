Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the music played during the commercial breaks.

Notes about each hour.  Please remember I haven't listened to the whole show yet myself:


Hour 1 ends oddly.  This is how I received it (captured).  I'm capping the rebroadcast of Hr1 as I type this.  If it ends normally I will upload a new Hr 1 (possibly just the end?)... if it ends the same I will post a comment.

Hour 2 has a rare moment of inside baseball.  During one of the breaks they were playing a sound clip.  I left that in.

Hour 3 has two notes.  One is the first commercial I left it all in due to the oddness of it.  The ironic second note is that Glenn did a recorded commercial that was web broadcasted.  I left that one in too just for the fun of it.  :)
