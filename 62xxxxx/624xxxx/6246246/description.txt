"Original Song"

With Sue Sylvester coaching Aural Intensity, 
Blaine and the Warblers' dynamic set list 
and tough judges Tammy Jean Albertson (guest 
star Griffin) and Sister Mary Constance 
(guest star Devine), the kids of New 
Directions decide the only way to win 
Regionals is to write and perform their own 
original songs. Meanwhile, Quinn is hell-
bent on getting Finn back and ruling 
McKinley once again.

Enjoy :)
