[T],frapper101,2011-03-14T15:29Z,"thanks 4 transformers and outcasts
:D"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-14T15:30Z,"Thanks.

@shaaani: Reason for not doing Shameless US, without doubt one of the best series that ever was (maybe only US version better than UK original) and hopefully long-lived is, as I said, of technical nature, not the show itself (one I personally adore and wouldn't miss an episode). But, I stated that ""I hate and I don't need to explain every single move and every decision"". 

Frankly, whatever I choose to say wouldn't make any difference  to you or to anybody else, regarding many, many shows... You haven't pay a single dime for my work, so my choices are - just mine. Do not get over your head. Please."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-14T15:40Z,"@abobill & @Dr-nido: Last week Dr-nidO said ""sorry, I broke the rule without knowing"".

In same text, as I pointed to back then, is clearly written:

""Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.""

Fuck... I post that text every day, even more than once - and like gazillion times altogether."
,hkoraddi,2011-03-14T15:59Z,thanks for the transformers.i used to watch it wen was a kid and i still like it
,jmac85,2011-03-14T17:36Z,"Appreciate your efforts! Thank you for: Californication, Outcasts, Shameless (I'd been downloading 720p), Simpsons, and Transformers. [+1]"
,Dr-nidO,2011-03-14T17:58Z,"@ 2040

first of all know that i really appreciate your dedication and the amount of time you must put in your work,its wonderful to get almost all of the shows on daily basis in great quality...
your exemption for house was wonderful.. 

my previous comment was just a sad exclamation that you dropped a show you were previously doing

it does not mean that i don't appreciate getting
all the rest, every day :-)

I am really sorry if i came across as an ungrateful git...

keep up the great work and as alyawys +1 "

first of all know that i really appreciate your dedication and the amount of time you must put in your work. and the exemption for house was really great of you...

that said my previous comment
""no Breakout kings anymore :-(""
was just a SAD exclamation on my part to not see a promising show that you were doing before.

it does not take away the fact that i love getting latest episodes of AALLLLl the other shows, every day , in GREAT quality :-)

I am really sorry if i came across as an ungrateful git ...

keep up the great work and +1 as always"
,the_shroud,2011-03-14T19:00Z,"Thx for the Californication n Being Human.
Have you heard of the web TV shorts spin off Becoming Human? Our speed is too slow for streaming and I think not playable in our region..... "
,jon4fun,2011-03-14T20:19Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encodes/upload.

Cheers
Jon

Thanks for Califnornication and The Simpsons.

@ the_shroud - BBC3 is combining the Webisodes of [Becoming Human] and airing as a single show on 20th March. If you ask REALLY nicely 20-40 may encode and up this once off."
,cindal,2011-03-15T01:36Z,thank you for being human and shameless
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-15T09:31Z,"@Dr-nidO: Why nobody have said ""Breakout Kings"" are good. Please, continue it."" or similar. Or plain Thanks for BK? No one.

If one really read even once my scribbling, what decides ""the faith"" of the shows is pretty understandable.

Actions speak louder than words.

So - I would encode BK 02 tomorrow and put it daily pack - but: if one likes something, that should be outed.

Strange how morons who have clicked gazillion times on ""minus"" on every torrent I up are more persistent than ""normal"" people.

@the_shroud: I would put eps 1-7 in daily pack tomorrow, Tue. (Mon. airings). Ep.8 is not aired yet."
,ahmedv,2011-03-15T11:42Z,Thanks for Simpsons
,abobill,2011-03-15T13:35Z,"hey 20-40, I was a late downloader to Breakout Kings but I expressed my thanks as soon as I had watched (around the same time as I asked the above question)

Anyway thanks for the hard work, much appreciated"
,abobill,2011-03-15T13:36Z,and thanks in advance for episode 2 of BK
,the_shroud,2011-03-15T16:54Z,"Thank u Thank u Thank u 20-40
