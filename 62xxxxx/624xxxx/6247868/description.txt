 INSTALLING

 To install Windows Tiny7 from this CD, set your PC 
 up so it will boot from the CD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.

 There is no upgrade option available in Tiny7,  because the option
 is removed.

 Only install Tiny7 onto a freshly formatted partition or hard disk.

 You do not need any product key in this release - the installation
 of Tiny7 is unattended, apart from in the very beginning where you
 choose which drive or partition to install to.

 All installations are set to US English. If you do not want the US
 keyboard settings, you will have to change this in Windows when it
 has installed (as opposed to choosing it at install time), its easy
 enough, just open the "Keyboard Settings" folder in the desktop
 eXPerience folder and read the included ReadMe.txt that is there.

 Special note from eXPerience:
 
 I have used this modded OS for a few days and it seems every bit as fast
 as Windows XP. If you have always wanted to use Vista, but were holding
 out for Windows 7 - its worth it! This slimmed edition boots up fast,
 shuts down fast, opens applications fast, even VMware v5.5 runs fast
 on it once its started up. File copying seems no slower than XP. All
 in all this new Windows really blows away XP because of all the new
 features. You have to remember XP is from 2001 when no one even had
 such a thing as "Wireless" or a SATA drive. Now all this new hardware
 runs on Windows XP but the OS was never designed to run it really.
 You might wonder why not just use Vista - don't even go there. Lets
 just pretend Vista never existed. In fact Microsoft should have not
 ever released it but I guess they had to in order to improve on it
 and eventually get it right - with Windows 7.
