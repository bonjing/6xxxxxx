[T],keeybee,2011-04-03T23:03Z,The torrent seems to be ok. Others are downloading it. Try the Forum for help. Or maybe try downloading with the Magnet link.

@Zeeburg: Every decent software music player can play .flac (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files. Try jetaudio if your crappy wind0ws media player can't. Better yet, switch to linux (read ""ubuntu"") or even Solaris. Not that it will solve all your problems, but I will feel less inclined to kill you because you would have commited suicide already (hopefully)."
