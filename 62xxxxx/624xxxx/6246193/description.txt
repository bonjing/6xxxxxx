When a massive power outage plunges the city of Detroit into
total darkness, a disparate group of individuals find themselves
alone. The entire city\'s population has vanished into thin air,
leaving behind heaps of empty clothing, abandoned cars and
lengthening shadows. Soon the daylight begins to disappear
completely, and as the survivors gather in an abandoned tavern,
they realize the darkness is out to get them, and only their
rapidly diminishing light sources can keep them safe.
