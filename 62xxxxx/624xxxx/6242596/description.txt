PLOT:
Four friends set out on a motorcycle adventure weekend, clocking
up miles in an attempt to outrun their age and urban lifestyles.
After bartering with a local land owner for a place to set up
camp, they spend the night reminiscing over their wasted youth.
The following morning they spot an ominous looking caravan, and
decide to investigate. Within minutes, an idiotic prank leads to
a series of brutal events and a deadly race for survival. A
modern plunge back into the worlds created by movies such as
'Deliverance' and 'Southern Comfort' but with a gritty British
twang. Kidnap, murder and a hidden past are just some of the
reasons these four adventurers should have stayed at home. An
action thriller that will make you question who the villains
really are. You cant outrun what's in your blood[/code]
