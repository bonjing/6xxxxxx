This live album was released after Keith found out crappy sounding bootlegs were being traded for $75.

From the liner notes:

You wanna hear some good music?  Heres some guys that wanna play it for you.  I figure, if you can get 5 or 6 guys to work together in total harmony it is quite possible that the whole world could.

- Keith Richards
