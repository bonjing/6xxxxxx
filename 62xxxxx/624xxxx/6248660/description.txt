The Bells of Saint Mary's  1945


"Father O'Malley the unconventional priest from 'Going My Way' continues his work for the Catholic Church. This time he is sent to St. Mary's, a run-down parochial school on the verge of condemnation. He and Sister Benedict work together in an attempt to save the school, though their differing methods often lead to good-natured disagreements." (Helton)

This DivX movie plays fine in Media Player Classic and VLC player. I couldn't get decent fidelity when I originally ripped it for 700MB file size, so I'm sorry that it is just over a gigabyte, but The quality is almost verbatim this way.  Please seed, comment, leave tips and tricks for ripping new DVDs.
