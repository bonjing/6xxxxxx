Joe Beck - Brazilian Dreamin 

Label: Venus Records
Original Release Date: 2006
Quality: flac + que

Joe Beck has had a long career, though he remains an artist deserving of wider recognition. These 2005 sessions are a relaxing affair that will delight fans of Brazilian jazz. Joined by bassist Ira Coleman and drummer Thierry Arpino (who is known for his work with violinist Jean-Luc Ponty), Beck's fluid electric guitar (while sometimes overdubbing an acoustic rhythm line) makes the most of each selection, playing a heavy dose of popular tunes by Antonio Carlos Jobim and his own tasty originals. Highlights among the Jobim compositions include the bittersweet "O Grande Amor" and the easygoing "Felicidade." Harmonica player Gregoire Maret is added for the leader's gentle bossa nova "And Here's to You" and Jobim's bittersweet "Falando De Amor." Beck also offers an inventive samba arrangement of John Coltrane's "Giant Steps" that adds a few twists while played at a slower-than-typical tempo, so it sneaks up on the listener. Highly recommended! ~ Ken Dryden, All Music Guide
