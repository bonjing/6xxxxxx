We all remember Sonic The Hedgehog 1,2 and 3, we all remember the nostalgia playing them again when we are older and most important we remember how amazing the music from the first Sonic games were, ahh so many memories.

Fear not Sonic fans, I bring to you in a 138MB 7zip file Sonic 1,2 and 3 OST's now ain't I kind =P

I also included a modified Dr.Eggman's theme from Sonic 2 that I got off youtube a while back.

Also big credit goes to some cool cat called Elixir from gameshrine where I got Sonic 2 and 3 OST's from.

You will also need 7zip to extract these files.
