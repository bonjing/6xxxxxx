i was thinking getting some of his add cap in to and putting it on ur .iso files...

his work>>>

- Up to date windows XP English 32 bits version + 
- Up to date wmp 11, ie 8, Direct X 9.0 June 2010, Silverlight, Adobe Flash, Java, msxml, capicom, vcredist, Winrar, Unlocker, Sptd, Aspi, Net framework 2.0 sp2, Sata oem drivers,  Ati drivers, all Hdmi drivers, creative audigy driver

If you use Microsoft Update site, do not update Root Certificates October 2010, as this CD contains a newer version named ""February 2011 Root Certificates"", due to the Microsoft stupidity, they push up an old rootsupd.exe  


which of those cap i should get from him?"

[T],Maherz,2011-03-16T17:57Z,"@coolshahzad
You have to burn the image you download on a CD.

@eyesbreak
You don't have to make it bootable, it's already bootable.
You just have to burn the image you download on a CD.
Don't extract anything, chose burn image to disk.

@-jaatboy-
Avira.

@narmenia
There's no problem with this release.
Try another source for Office 2007."

Thanks for the upload but some help is needed by a Mac user who is trying to install this on a MacBook.
Your comment states that a serial key is already inserted into the ISO but on my installation it is asking for a Product Key. Has something gone wrong or do I need to find a valid key somewhere."
[T],Maherz,2011-03-17T23:42Z,"@pak123
I didn't create it.
But this one works even if your HDD is not SATA.
Regarding your question about integrating programs into XP CD, you have to search Google or YouTube for tutorials.
Search for ""nLite"" tutorials and downloads.
Good luck.

@DarthBubba
Thank you :)

@coolshahzad
Since I started doing this, I'm always and everytime is asked the same question! And I always forget to mention that :)
Sorry my fault, it's 32-bit.

@andr3i_304100
Privet Andrey, kajecya ti russiyanen :)
Anyway, turn on automatic updates, don't worry about being caught.
Good luck.

@chuckie6
If you install it on a MacBook you will certainly need a key, even if it's already inserted.
Use this original key (the same I inserted in this Windows release):
MR49R-DRJXX-M6PX2-V96BF-8CKBJ
Good luck."

,Scarba,2011-03-28T00:17Z,"Hi Maherz,

I downloaded this torrent hoping to fix my pc problems but it's not working.

After it loads up the necessary drivers and whatnot, right when the Windows Installer is about to launch I get a blue screen with the error:

""STOP: c0000221 Unknown Hard Error
\systemRoot\System32\ntdll.dll""

after which I need to restart the pc.

Please note I tried installing from my old Windows CD (it doesn't have the updates and I can't have it turned on because it's not cracked) and this one allows the execution of the Win Installer without any prob.

Any cahnce you can help me with that? perhaps it's something you put in the installation that's messing with that particular .dll?

Ty in advance! "
[T],Maherz,2011-03-30T15:59Z,"@jkhd
I'm not.

@tgp1968
You're welcome.

@Scarba
Burn the image on another type blank CD with minimal speed.
Good luck."
,seethestars,2011-03-30T20:23Z,hi. anyone can help. tryin to use this as an upgrade. but keygen shown earlier here doesnt work on pc. any ideas. many thanks.
,Scarba,2011-03-31T06:14Z,"@Maherz: I did it the first time with minimum writing speed on a quality CD; I also troubleshooted everything hardware related like cables/ HDD/ CD-Rom and couldn't find anything wrong - I replaced the .dll in question and it still didn't work.

After all that I thought I should give your earlier WinXP release a go and it worked beautifully.

Updates are working without a problem and the software is clean and safe.

Thank you!

One more thing though - regarding your WinRAR torrent - how do you apply the key to the product? I tried replacing the one in its installation folder and also in the %APP.DATA% one with no success. It still says I have 40 some days from the trial. "
,ipdra,2011-03-31T18:17Z,"Hello, thank you very much for this.
May I ask if I can Instal Microsoft Essential ?

I have try and I m getting an error that the file is not a valid Win32 application. 
Something with Windows Genuine ?
Thanks"
[T],Maherz,2011-04-01T05:20Z,"@seethestars
You can't use that key to upgrade.
You have to do a clean install.

@Scarba
Strange thing! I'll look into it in the next release.
Regarding winrar, just download and install, they key will automatically be copied to the installation folder. If not copy it manually.

@ipdra
Ofcourse you can!
But seems that the file you have is corrupted. Download again and install.
This has nothing to do with Windows Genuine.
Good luck."
