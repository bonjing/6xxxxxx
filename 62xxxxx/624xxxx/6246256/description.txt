~grimreaper420 instructions~VERY IMPORTANT

1.)BACKUP everything with Blackberry Desktop Software (latest version is 6.0.1.18) a full backup takes seconds to complete.
2.)BB desktop software default is (C:)>Library>Documents>BlackBerry>Backup [for Windows 7 users]
3.)Either download BBSAK from http://bbsak.org/ or get it from the folder, it's up to you:)
4.)Use BBSAK to wipe device - WARNING - everything will be deleted (except for any contents in your microSD memory card). 
5.)Use BBSAK to load OS6 9700.6.0.0.499 to your BlackBerry (9700) smartphone.
6.)After you have completely installed OS6, you can proceed to restore the backup file (from BB desktop) and any other backup using BBSAK (third-party apps)  to your BlackBerry smartphone.
7.)Enjoy everyone:)


Other tips: 

*After you wipe the device, you should see a code 507, that is perfectly fine, which means you correctly wiped the phone correctly.

*The installation of OS6 will take anywhere from 20-40 mins, let it completely finish properly, do not unplug your USB cable while phone is being wiped, or is in the process of installing an operating system (OS).

*BBSAK can backup all your third-party applications. 

*Make sure Blackberry desktop software is installed already as it will make current and future installations easier.

Q&A: Is the latest Beta OS6 for my BlackBerry Bold 9700 better vs. the official OS6?

Some people will prefer the most recent Beta OS6 for their BB Bold 9700, compared to an official OS6 due to people's intention of maybe tinkering, or just having better luck and stability with the latest Beta OS6 file vs. the official one.
Also, what I find interesting is there seems to be a lot more demand for a Beta version vs the official version...so here it is!
