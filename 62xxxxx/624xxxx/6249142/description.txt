â€¢Game Overview
Ragnarok Online is certainly one of the most well known MMORPGs out there. The game was originally released in 2001 and has since had a lot of success. The game has always been â€˜Pay-to-playâ€™ which is why private Ragnarok Online servers became so popular. Iâ€™m surprised it took Gravity so long to launch a free version of their game, but in October 2008 gravity launched a single free-to-play server on iRO (International Ragnarok Online) called Valkyrie which would pay for itself by selling â€˜cash shop itemsâ€™.  The free server â€˜Valkyrieâ€™ is largely the same as the pay to play servers, but with slightly slower experience gain. If youâ€™re not familiar with the game, Ragnarok Online is a 3D Fantasy MMORPG with detailed 2D sprites and beautifully animated visuals. It has a large selection of playable classes and a huge game world to explore. The game may be a bit older than other MMORPGs, but itâ€™s still been able to keep fresh with regular content updates from the publisher. If youâ€™ve never played Ragnarok Online before give the game a try!
