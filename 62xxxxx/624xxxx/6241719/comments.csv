,jorge56,2011-04-11T04:28Z,"stkrup, the movie also has  English audio, I put it there myself.  You must be having trouble switching between audio streams. If you want to watch on a blu-ray player make sure it can play AVCHD.
I burned the movie to disc and was able to watch it on PS3 which plays AVCHD.

What is ISO format?"
,jorge56,2011-04-11T04:37Z,"Don't mind my question, ISO format = disc image"
,denisjosimar,2012-04-07T06:49Z,Great Movie + audio latino is the best thing. movie needs more seeders.  Count me in.
