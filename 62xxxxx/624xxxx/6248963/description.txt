Now we've got members: Tiny Disasters on/off There is no sound in space, there is no wind on the moon 

The production and recording of this album was a tiny disaster in itself, and the album contains 8 tiny disastrous tunes of massive psychedelia, heavy oriental-ish pop and quite complex tunes. The album received splendid reviews in the Norwegian press, and is delivered with a nice booklet of Yokoland's art and a secret.
