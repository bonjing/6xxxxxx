,Dcks,2011-03-16T15:36Z,"""This game requires additional data to run on your phone. Do you want to launch the download?""

What to doo....?  on some other torrents, you get a folder with all the data.."
[T],xxThugxx,2011-03-16T15:46Z,"Dude there is 21 games here, if i included all the SD Card data the torrent would be like 4GB lol"
,Dcks,2011-03-16T16:22Z,"rather that,, but can i just download it to my phone? ;)"
[T],xxThugxx,2011-03-16T17:00Z,"There all cracked, so like it says in the readme, just treat it as if it's a retail copy you bought. so you can download the data from gameloft and play games online :)"
,xsyrhies,2011-03-19T03:31Z,Awesome!
,jasperchua,2011-03-20T12:29Z,additional content is taking too long :(
,lambo_sv,2011-03-24T11:51Z,"thx alot!

If u download the additional files, put you'r wifi on ofc -.-
Most of them are around the 350MB.

All the games are working on Galaxy S except Asphalt 6 :'(

Is there already a solution or a newer version?
It crashes when it starts the additional data download.."

,f.tremblay94,2011-05-20T22:16Z,"Does it work for Androids without sd card slot, like the Nexus S? If i copy the .apk file in the internal memory, will i be able to install the game or app?
Thanks"
[T],xxThugxx,2011-05-22T10:32Z,"f.tremblay94 i havent tested on a nexus s, but its just a newer galaxy s right? so i see no problems :)"
,mumihp,2011-05-26T17:57Z,"I'm new the android scene, this can be seen as a pretty stupid qrestion, but is there a difference between android apps and android HD apps? or is the HD app for only Android 3.0 tablet????

Thanks xxThugxx for this, the games a pretty good."
,vachan007,2011-06-11T13:46Z,"thnx 4 d games.....i installed some games... i have sonyericsson x8(2.1), the  intro videos are not supported by the default  media player so the game doesnt get opened....assasins creed works great as i changed its intro video format....but some  games like hero of sparta cant  be opened if the intro video format is changed, it redownloads the original video which is not supported....pls help!!! pls help!!! pls help!!!"
,Wasteofair,2011-06-15T15:51Z,These games will not let my wifi connect to my network on an Inspire. Won't let you download the extra data without wifi so they are unplayable for me.
,call_me_nobody,2011-06-16T19:51Z,"I think this just are the apk apps, u must then download the gamedata on ur phone;)"
,108454,2011-06-17T08:53Z,"works like a charm, note: after installing you need to download extra files varies from 500 mb to 100 mb, use wi-fi to dowload these files!

also you need a file explorer app, and app installer,"
,jyrki69,2011-06-17T13:32Z,"Hi!
I downloaded all games and send them to my SD Card 8gb,some games work good,but Assasins Creed,Gangstar,everything is good until i try to play them,when the game start there is too much black space on the screen,like i can't see a caracter on my screen it's black,how to fix that???"

,Steampumpkin,2011-06-27T14:12Z,"Most of these are working great on my Nexus S, but a few (Dungeon Hunter, Spiderman, Splinter Cell, and a few others) just hang about on the download screen without actually doing anything (tested but using those with a download progress bar, it doesnt move). Also, Let's Golf 2 seems to be stuck on an infinite loop on the opening cinematic. Loving the upload though, thanks :D"
,Steampumpkin,2011-06-27T14:13Z,"Sorry for double post, but the moment I posted that I noticed that the progress bar had started moving. It's taken about 30 minutes to connect, but obviously it gets there in the end :)"
