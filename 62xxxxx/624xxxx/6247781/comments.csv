,osriccc,2011-05-01T18:29Z,"This is great, saved my ass. I had 86 clips from Mac's Mov (which hardly workds with Winows, even having codecs) and first used th Ultimate version, got it burned by Xilisoft because I only had the serial and no crack, so PLEASE CRACK CORRECTLY BEFORE USING AND ENTERING FALSE NAMES AND SERIALS BECAUSE THEY'LL BE FOUND OUT. I converted the videos correctly. This is the one and only program that allowed me to convert from Mac's Mov (captured in Mac from HDV) to HD MP4 without any noticeable quality loss. Please support Xilisoft by buying this one if you're into this kind of job. I already did! Give it a try first though."

Thank you [HB]!"
