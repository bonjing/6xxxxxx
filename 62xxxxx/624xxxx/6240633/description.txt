The film charts the rise and fall of the notorious Irish gangster Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who held Dublin in his thrall during the 1980s with a series of daring robberies, gaining the name "The General".

The film tells the story of Cahill's life of crime exposing his deep-seated resentment and open defiance of all authority with his relentless battle with the Irish police force. He over-reaches himself when he and his gang (Adrian Dunbar, Sean McGinley) steal paintings belonging to the Beit collection.
