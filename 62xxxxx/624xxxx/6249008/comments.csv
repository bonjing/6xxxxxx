For those who don't know:  Blaine is played by Darren Criss, a San Francisco straight actor who pulls off this kiss as good as any gay guy does.  What makes it memorable is Kurt kisses his back, open mouth, hand to face and they linger to enjoy the moment - and then kiss again!  

Glee is broadcast over the very conservative ""Tea Party"" Fox network who HATE gay people yet the conservatives wouldn't dare speak out against Fox.  If this had run on ABC then ever bible-thumbing church across the U.S. would be filing complaints with the FTC.  

Growing up I NEVER saw anything like this on prime time TV.  Finally, at last we are seeing life for what it really is and gay people being depicted as human beings who happen to fall in love with each other.  "

More people need to hear a heartfelt truth.
I love Glee :)"
,941640278,2011-03-17T14:06Z,Thanks Mike.  One of the members of the Warblers (Telly) tweeted some inside news.  He says The Warblers will release their own album soon and will remain on the show for a while - until Blaine auditions for the New Directions.  I would assume Blaine and Kurt would leave the boys school and go back to Kurt's old high school.  Don't know how true the tip is...
