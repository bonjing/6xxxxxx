It's definately not a seeder issue, I'm downloading at 1.8MB/Sec while also downloading Battle of LA at 1.1MB/Sec. You must be on dialup or DSL! LMAO This is the second torrent I've seen you complaining about only getting 14KB/Sec, You probably have your upload limit set to 1KB/Sec too. Quit bitching, it's free!

Thanks Uploader, Totally watchable and not 80 RARs...You Rock!"

,fosdike,2011-03-19T06:40Z,Egads.... Don't download and watch this if you have epilepsy. The flickering is diabolical (in the sample at least!).

,Reviewer,2011-03-20T09:10Z,"@Cozen

If you are so concerned about the legitimacy of the piratebay, then you fucking download it and tell us the A/V you piece of shit."

,skimmer911,2011-03-23T17:37Z,if you want to sort the sound quality out use a program called wavepad sound editor i managed to remove all hiss made sound 10x better then pasted it over the video using videopad editor then muted the original soundtrack
