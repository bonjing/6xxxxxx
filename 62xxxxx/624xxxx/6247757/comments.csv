[T],TeamPS,2011-04-06T15:35Z,"It's a spoof. It is 3.55 CFW that spoofs 3.60. Basically, it isn't what ipodguy79 says it is."
,ipodguy79,2011-04-07T01:18Z,it is a custom firmware ...and it dose work not creator just put it all together for easier  downloading .... 
[T],TeamPS,2011-04-12T01:42Z,"@ipodguy79

Yeah, but it isn't 3.60 CFW. It's still only 3.55 CFW."
,lgw11,2011-04-13T19:30Z,will it work on 3.60 ?
,mihopoulas,2011-04-20T10:38Z,its not working on 3.60 just tried it.. Another spoof. Before uploading and fullilng us with lies try using it on 3.6 version or dont write that its compatible liar and loser.
,xiIix,2011-05-14T07:04Z,"He obviously doesn't speak fucking English guys, give him as break. Anyone can see how this guy mixed up his words incorrectly and made a mistake. He didn't mean to actually intend people to believe that this was a jailbreak for 3.60, he just doesn't know how to say it properly in English. I noticed this before I even started reading the comments. Fucking morons."

       CFW 3.60        

IT IS A SPOOFER OF 3.60  FOR 3.55     

DO NOT DOWNLOAD FOR CUSTOM FIRMWARE . THIS IS NOT IT!!                                                                  "
,Kyle2011anon,2012-02-27T00:07Z,"For anybody who downloads this and any other JB's for any firmware version over 3.55

NONE of these are real. Nobody has made a legitimate jailbreak since 3.55 because Sony fixed their algorithm to be harder to crack whereas before Sony's algorithm for PS3 firmware 3.55 and below used the same algorithm.

Heads up: These are all fake. No I'm not trolling they are simply fake lol trust me. I've tried. You filled out a survey for nothing. And I just hope like hell you didn't give any of these sites your credit card number."
