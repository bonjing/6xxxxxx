,DragonKP,2011-03-16T17:20Z,"So do not download and get lost. This ""crap@ for you is treasure for other people.

By the way - this place is NOT your fucking property so take your miserable complaints somewhere else (I suggest publish them on the wall of your own WC)

Another agent provocateur ???"

It seems you suspect almost everybody to be , as you so handsomely put it , agents provocateur.

I cannot stop you from uploading a lot of crap!

But listening to most of the stuff youÂ´re spreading about yourself makes it even more sickening when you have to endure a stuttering
 computer generated voice.

I find it fascinating to hear and read the opinions of others but people who claim to tell ""the truth"" about stuff just makes me angry.

IÂ´d like you to start thinking by yourself for a bit
 instead of just ruminate what others have thought.

If youÂ´re so desperate to ""spread your gospel""
then for fucks sake have the decency to record the crap in your own voice."
,DragonKP,2011-03-19T14:38Z,"Thanks for uplifting comment sven_svengali2, but you look to me like another leecher (0 uplods - ZERO!) who do not contribute anything, but only complain.

If you don't have what you like, you like what you have. Therefore do not download my stuff, get lost from here and do not even think sticking your nose here again.

On the bright side the number of downloads and public & private comments show different point of view than yours.

Have a nice day and take a hike!"
,wetmouse,2011-03-26T06:32Z,Your uploads are the worst in the long history of TPB. You should be banned for being such a fucking 'tard and for questioning your intellectual superiors. MP3s of books narrated by Stephen Hawking have no fucking business on a torrent site. So take them elsewhere or else!
,DragonKP,2011-03-31T18:29Z,"wetmouse - geniuses like you is really spot here just look at your torrent upload info - ), zero, nil, nilch !!!

Anyway wetmous means what - WET MOUSE?, mouse which is going soon to wet? or something els?
enough of name-calling

I DO NOT care what you thing, and as long as there are people who want th here books, and not Hollywod ""quality"" of voice it will be done, and you may get lost.
you do not own this plase so ban yourself and go to XXX section to comfort your broken ego.

Ciao bambino!!!"
,DragonKP,2011-04-01T05:26Z,"I apologize for all PirateBay's users that I had to use such language for treating ""wetmouse"" character.

I did it just to teach him a little bit of remorse, and give him a chance to comment. He did nothing, so I conclude we are square (= I owe him nothing + he owes me nothing). But if he decides to attack me later you will see firefly x 1000 flying.

And that's me - DragonKP"
