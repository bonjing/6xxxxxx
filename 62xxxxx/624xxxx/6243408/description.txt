The best antivirus for Mac now scans the Apple iPad for malware and malicious files

Only VirusBarrier X5 provides comprehensive protection from malware and network threats. VirusBarrier X5 is the only antivirus program for Mac that includes full anti-malware protection together with firewall, network protection, anti-phishing, anti-spyware features and more.

As malware changes, protection needs to be reinforcedâ€¨While viruses, Trojan horses, worms and other forms of malware are a constant threat to computers of all kinds, cyber-criminals are turning to new techniques to infect and control your Mac. 

These new threats come silently, with little warning, over the Internet: in many cases, simply visiting a booby-trapped web page can compromise your Mac. Focusing on malware or network attacks alone is no longer sufficient to protect Macs from the dangers of the Internet.

Comprehensive protection with VirusBarrier X5â€¨VirusBarrier X6, the latest version of Intego's network and malware security program, includes more than 100 new features. With multiple threat-detection techniques, improved methods of detection, combined detection protocols, proactive behavioral analysis, and a full range of defensive functions, VirusBarrier X5 protects Macs from all known network-based threats, as well as all known malware.
