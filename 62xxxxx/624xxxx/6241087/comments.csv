,ms7hue,2011-03-14T11:35Z,Yep. I uploaded it. But not sure if I did it right. If not post and I'll try to fix it. It works fine tho.
,DarkVOX,2011-03-17T00:04Z,"It's an older game.  Games from back then didn't usually take up a lot of space, at least installers didn't.

It's in a DMG file, so that's why it's only 632MB.

I download a UT2004 DMG that was around 2.3GB or so, and after extraction and stuff, it was 6GB"

,Fullsail88,2011-10-17T03:38Z,look.. WHAT IS THE CD KEY MAN. IM TIRED OF GETTIN ON THIS SITE AND GETTIN HALF ASS TORRENTS
,hackosaurus,2011-10-17T21:33Z,"FULLSAIL88. SHUT THE FUCK UP. you're searching for free games and not only do you want it free but you want a free valid cd-key to play online? You're a dumb-ass. The ONLY reason this site could even be CONSIDERED morally right is for the people that really DO want to try before they buy, and that's an assumed no for 99.9% of the leechers on here... It's ok to get mad at a bad crack job but seriously?, you expect someone to just give you their paid for key? the crackers work hard at providing games to the masses on a timely schedule, show a little respect"
,hackosaurus,2011-10-17T21:35Z,"also forgot to mention.. it is ASSUMED that any cracked game on here will OF COURSE not be playable online unless it is a LAN game, and even then, some games still detect the serial keys"

,chadamjhn,2011-11-20T17:29Z,"works fine on intel macbook w/snowleopard when  rosetta downloaded from software update to run the installer. WONT WORK ON LION THO AS PPC!

,locus11,2011-11-21T17:17Z,If you have Lion do NOT download as this is the PPC version. Lion does not support Rosetta which is req. for PPC apps on Intel macs
,DonGTIU,2011-12-27T12:14Z,"Seriously beautiful torrent! 

Everything works right of the gate. Great video and gameplay options, LAN and Server-Hosted multiplayer (haven't tried that yet...)
