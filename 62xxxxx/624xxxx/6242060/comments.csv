,killword,2011-03-14T20:51Z,"Looked at this one thinking it might be the late novelist David Foster Wallace.  

I'm not sure this is to my tastes (even though most of what you upload is).. still, I wanted to chime in to agree with spiritualiste and qudub -- your regulars appreciate the time you spend on each torrent and are more than happy to wait a little longer to download files you deem to be worth encoding at a higher level of quality.

Thanks!"
