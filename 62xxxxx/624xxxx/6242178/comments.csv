,Nicsta55,2011-12-21T10:25Z,"I have a problem... After installing the game i launched it, it came up with an error: Fatal error: cannot set display mode. i could still play the game, but when i entered a level i could not see anything exept for some of the floor i was on.... If anyone has the solution to the problem can you please help me?"
,RafVne2,2011-12-26T10:47Z,"Just finished it. It does save for me, so can't help cause I don't know what's the issue... if it's win 7 you may have to run it as admin, so it has permission to write... 
damn this game is hard even on normal, without the quick save it would take forever to finish it... I remember back... several years ago I played it I think on PS2 abd I didn't have the quick save... it took forever...

oh... running on xp x86"
,spdon,2012-03-04T21:44Z,"thanks to the uploader good game. working on me, windows 7 64b."
