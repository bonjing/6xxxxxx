INXS - Original Sin [promo].VOB


Very HQ rare promo music video with untouched AC3 6ch audio from the promo DVD. "Original Sin" is a hit single by Australian rock group INXS released in 1984 on their fourth album The Swing. It was written by Michael Hutchence and Andrew Farriss, and produced by Nile Rodgers.

It was released as a single in the U.S. in December 1983, where it reached No. 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984. In Australia, it reached No. 1 in 1984, and became an international hit during that year.

Singer Daryl Hall sings the chorus along with Hutchence. According to an interview done in Australia, Hall says Nile Rodgers called him up and asked him to sing on the song. Rodgers had produced the song "Adult Education" for Hall and Oates the previous year.

The music video was set in Japan and features INXS singing the song arriving on motorbikes, as a fairground is set up and taken down around them, all brought in and removed with large trucks.

INXS (pronounced "in excess") is an Australian rock and New Wave band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney. Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar/sax. For twenty years they were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose "sultry good looks" and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.

INXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.
