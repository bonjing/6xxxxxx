Patched Pokemon Black Version And Pokemon White Version For Nintendo Ds ROM.

Works on No$Gba + DesMuMe.

Pokemon + Place Names Are Translated Japanese Not Official English Ones.

Tested Working (By Me) On R4i SDHC.
DOES NOT WORK ON TTDS OR R4 REVOLUTION.


This  Is In .rar Format To Make Download Times Shorter (512Mb Down To 131Mb) So Bitzipper Or Winrar Is Needed To Extract The Files

If SomeOne Could Test It On Other Cards And Comment Your Findings It Would Be Appreciated
