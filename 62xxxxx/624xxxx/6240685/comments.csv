If it doesn't would it be possible if there could be a file? 
Thanks"

@lalawawa, no it doesn't work for 3dsmax 2012. I advise anyone not to do it since it will corrupt your entire 3dsmax program and I bet none of you want to reinstall 3dsmax again. Its pretty explanatory that it say 2010-2011 version of 3dsmax. I wish someone seeded a 2012 version of this fumefx.. "
