                Comedy series following the personal and professional
                challenges faced by those responsible for delivering
                the biggest show on earth, as the Olympic Deliverance
                team try to get through to the end of the day, the
                end of the week and the end of the year without all
                the wheels falling off at once. With time ticking
                inexorably downwards, the marketing team come up with
                a major public event to mark the '1000 days to go'
                milestone. A huge clock designed by a modern British
                artist will be installed outside the Tate Modern on
                the banks of the Thames in a ceremony performed by
                both Seb Coe and Boris Johnson and will count down
                towards the start of the Olympic Games. The only
                problem is that the clock has a potentially
                disastrous design flaw which no-one seems to have
                noticed until it's too late. Meanwhile the process of
                deciding which public figures should be approached to
                carry the Olympic Torch on its journey around Britain
                has begun.
