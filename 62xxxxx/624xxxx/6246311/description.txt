OK Gang, as the Tiny Island of Malta can now lift Italy's censorship of the Pirate Bay and join in the fun here, I give you this selection of VOB files all tagged and good to import into the Video Discotheque software of your choice.

From an original ISO here on TPB I have spilt them into tracks and tagged them saving you all that work.  Sadly people in Italy still have severe internet censorship by there 'media dictator' but at least Malta is clear again now.

Please see files for track listing.   VOB (MPEG2) format files un altered and original Promo Only DVD quality.   PLEASE TPB PEOPLE STOP POSTING MP4... It is a format designed for portable media players and looks rubbish on a full sized screen.   DON'T destroy a video file by compressing the living daylights out of it using MP4 

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!
