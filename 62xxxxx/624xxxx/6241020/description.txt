We all remember the early 90\\\\\\\'s arcade classic from Konami, X-Men The Arcade Game where you could pick as one out of 6 X-Men to battle the evil Magento with voice acting that was so bad, it became infamous and now legendary. 

It\\\\\\\'s now been brought back to light after being released on the PS Store and XBLA, so as you played it, wasn\\\\\\\'t the music pretty damn epic?

I thought so, which is why I bring to you in a compressed 56.7MB, the entire OST for X-Men The Arcade Game including the lines that were said in the game.

Please note, 7zip will be required to extract the file.

Enjoy, seed, leech and comment=]
