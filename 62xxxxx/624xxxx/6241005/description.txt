    he Team face one of their strangest challenges ever:       
    digging through a church graveyard in search of what      
    could be one of the largest Roman structures ever built  
    in Britain.                                               
                                                               
    Tony Robinson and his band are here at the request of     
    the Reverend William Burke, vicar of the historic St     
    Kyneburgha's church in Castor, Cambridgeshire.            
                                                               
    Under very close supervision, the Team must dodge the     
    thousands of burials in the graveyard to get to an       
    ornate mosaic floor that was reportedly discovered        
    almost 200 years ago.                                      
                                                              
    It could be the missing link in a village that is        
    crammed with massive Roman walls and old reports of       
    exquisite finds. Could they all belong to one vast         
    building, dubbed a Praetorium, that would have            
    dominated the Roman skyline and the whole region?        
                                                              
    Time Team fan out through the village to dig up gardens    
    and playing fields and locate the different pieces of     
    the jigsaw. Can the Team reach the mosaic under the      
    burials, and convince the sceptics that they've found a   
    building the size of a Roman palace?

      Due to the events in Japan, Channel 4 changed their      
      schedule and didnt update the epg or any listing,we     
      therefore missed the start of the hd broadcast as it   
      it started 30 minutes earlier than expected,the epg at  
      the time of this release is still showing the old        
      listings, sorry folks, this is all we can give you      
      at present.
