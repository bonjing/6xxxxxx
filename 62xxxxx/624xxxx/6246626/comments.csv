,daba_1,2011-03-16T15:22Z,"Bill Perry (not to be confused with the late bluesman of the same name who passed away in 2007) is a Mississippi blues guitarist/singer/song writer. Perry was born in Tula, Mississippi, on land where his ancestors had worked as slaves, and he has been playing Soul, Blues and Gospel for over 40 years.

â€œThe Way of Bluesâ€ opens with the romping-boogie title track. Atypical of the rest of the album, itâ€™s performed in the droning poly rhythms associated with the North Mississippi hills musicians. According to the liner notes, the entire CD was recorded, mixed, and mastered at Studio 61 in Clarksdale MS, but the first two tracks sound live. :P)"
,daba_1,2011-03-16T15:24Z,"Track two is titled, â€œThe Way of Blues Pt. II,â€ and it indeed continues the exact same upbeat party begun in track one. Iâ€™m not sure why they split the fun into two tracks. Instrumentally, there are Bill on electric guitar and vocals, a second electric guitar, bass, drums, piano, and harp is added in track two. Sample lyrics, â€œWe play the Blues both day and night / we wonâ€™t stop â€“ even for a fight / Thatâ€™s the Way of the Blues.â€ Together, we get 8:12 minutes of a smile starting, dance inducing, heart pumping ruckus.

Track three finds Perry solo on acoustic guitar singing 12 bar blues, â€œGive me a shot of whisky / Iâ€™ll play the blues all night.â€ Titled â€œA Shot of Whisky,â€ Perryâ€™s voice sounds like he has indeed enjoyed that water-of-life enough to season his vocals, without taking away his ability to hit high notes when desired. His guitar hits right in the gut as he demands no gin, wine, or beer because â€œhard liquor is quicker.â€

And, speaking of â€œwhisky,â€ the 12 bar, track five claims a â€œBluesmanâ€™s best friend has always been â€œâ€˜Jack, Johnny, or Jimâ€™/ whenever you got a problem, you can always depend on one of them.â€ While not many experts will tell you that the solution to your problems is drinking whisky, Perry sure sounds convincing as he again is solo on acoustic guitar with lots of single note picking.

The last cut is a wonderful, jazzy piano instrumental departure from the first eight. The double tracked pianist is Perryâ€™s son Bill Perry, Jr. with Shy Perry on bass.

Every track is a solid winner."

,daba_1,2011-08-02T22:03Z,"Bill ""Howl-N-Madd"" Perry is one of the North Mississippi hill country's best-kept secrets--or at least he was, until he and saxophonist Alphonso Sanders took second place in the solo/duo category in this year's International Blues Challenge in Memphis.  Hailing from Abbeville, Mississippi, only a few miles down the road from Foxfire Ranch, he knows how to rock the juke with nothing more than his guitar, his foot, and his voice.  What is it with that voice?  His vocal stylings are haunting, compelling--a broad, choked vibrato that owes something to Howlin' Wolf and something to the diddley-bow, with a gravelly, bourbon-soaked edge.  Some of us think he's the best blues singer in Mississippi.  Maybe that's because he's lived a remarkable, wide-ranging life that has taken him far beyond the Magnolia State. 

Perry was born in rural Lafayette County; his father was a cotton sharecropper and moonshiner--""a country hustler,"" according to his son--and young Bill Perry spent his share of time in the fields.  He moved to Chicago as a young man and spent time in the clubs listening to Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Mighty Joe Young, but gospel is where he got his first break.  By his late 'teens he'd recorded gospel for Chess Records, toured the country with various groups and, played bass and guitar behind the Five Blind Boys and Shirley Ceaser.

In 1966, after a 12-day stint at Harlem's Apollo Theater, he found himself in Memphis, broke.  He put on his good clothes, went out to a club, and ended up hooking up with Little Milton, his Chess label-mate.  Touring with Milton, he began to sing, and he backed up T. Bone Walker, Freddie King, and other blues stars.  His odyssey took him back to Chicago, where he worked at Chess as producer and session player until the label shut down in 1975.  Later Perry ended up on the West Coast--backing up Little Richard and Johnnie Taylor, writing and producing two albums for Cash McCall.

By the late 70s he was burnt out.  He retired from music for eight years.  Then, in 1987, he moved back to Mississippi and got back to work.  During the 1990s his family band, The Perrys--with daughter Shy on bass and Billy, Jr. on keyboards--played weddings and frat parties and made occasional overseas trips.  Over the last decade, Perry has begun to play and record more of his own music, including, for the first time, some solo work in the classic Mississippi-bluesman groove.  He moonlights as a DJ on WROX in Clarksdale.  He's also started to teach local kids at the Delta Blues Museum as part of the Arts and Education Program.

""I'm not your typical bluesman,"" Perry told an interviewer.  ""I'm stable and in a stable marriage for many years, so I don't sing about love lost and things.  I look around me and see what I see and write about it and sing about it.  The sounds that Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Charlie Patton and all that stuff that they was playing, I have tried to take and borrow from that and add in my own special blend of experience over the years."""
