Sam Cooke was essential to early soul music, a fact perhaps never more apparent than on \\\"Bring It on Home to Me.\\\" With Lou Rawls harmonizing, Cooke paints a portrait of desire and heartache that wears the cloak of secular R&B but draws its weighty feel from gospel. This near-perfect introduction to Cooke\\\'s short but prolific career also features gems like \\\"You Send Me\\\" and \\\"Cupid,\\\" irresistible trifles \\\"Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha\\\" and \\\"Twistin\\\' the Night Away,\\\" and all-time Sam Cooke classics like \\\"Wonderful World.\\\" GREATEST HITS comes close to superseding all previous Cooke compilations, with superlative remastering, an informative booklet, and excellent graphics.
