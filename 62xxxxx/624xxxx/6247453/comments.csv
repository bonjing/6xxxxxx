Do this game works? do i only download the iso.file or the rar.files also? but it seems that the size is to heavy to carry?"
,Leiemorderen,2011-06-10T04:43Z,"Okay, I'm sorta a noob to this, so bear with me...
I downloaded the torrent, extracted the file downloaded with winrar, installed the game with the setup, updated it, put the crack in both the torrent download folder, and the actual game folder, and it's asking me for the product key. Is it in the readme file, or did I just crack it wrong? Please respond. Like I said, I'm a noob."
