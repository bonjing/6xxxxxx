    The Battle of Bosworth was the decisive battle of the      
    Wars of the Roses. It was the beginning of the end of     
    three decades of treason, rebellion and dynastic         
    warfare.                                                  
                                                               
    Against huge odds, Henry Tudor won the day to take the    
    English Crown. It was a turning point in English         
    history, the end of the Middle Ages and the savage        
    beginnings of the country we recognise today.              
                                                              
    For five years, a team of archaeologists have been       
    combing this blood-stained ground. What these             
    archaeologists have found is changing the entire           
    understanding, not just of this iconic battle, but the    
    very nature of warfare at this time.                     
                                                              
    Experts now believe that the battle was not only fought    
    in an entirely different place from the 'official' site   
    but that gunpowder weapons, including large cannon,      
    were used in far larger numbers than previously thought   
                                                               
                                                              
    In order to test these theories the team build and fire  
    replica cannons and cannon balls, and deploy some of      
    the most sophisticated cameras in the world to examine     
    the grisly remains of soldiers killed in the Wars.        
                                                             
    The conclusions they draw radically change the view of    
    medieval warfare being ruled by knights in shining         
    armour.
