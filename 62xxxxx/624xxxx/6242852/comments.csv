,tmrdnz,2011-03-24T18:48Z,is it cam or not ? 
,yberkukk,2011-03-26T21:34Z,"If you look at the title it says TELESYNC. If you never have downloaded before, that means that it is a Cam. So read the top line before you write something. It usualy says what kind of quality the film is!"
,asseemnes,2011-03-28T14:21Z,"Thanks, bedankt :-)

And one more thing about the comments above:
Rango was just released, it's not available on DVD yet, so what do you expect ?!
Ofcourse it's cam, if you can't accept that you simply have to wait for the DVD version.
But this is not bad at all, thanks again.

The best one I found so far was Bone's that had no flickering but when I encoded it so I could play it for my kids on their tv, it lost sound after 22 minutes. Maybe NLUPPER has a better encoder. If so, thunbs up to ya. I will come back and comment afterwards."
,keallineage,2011-04-02T16:20Z,Has the same flickering in bright scenes as most of the copies going around. Looks like Bone has the only good copy.
,ManWithTheGoldenEye,2011-04-03T19:26Z,"het betere loserwerk..
blijven posten in DVDR sectie coolio;
uw titel gaat daar niets aan veranderen.
Misschien toch is leren converteren?"

,niichan,2011-04-12T22:38Z,Terrible quality. I got a headache after watching for 2 minutes.
,Spider_Crazy,2011-04-20T14:38Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS... Its a cam version, the background has lines shimmering, the audio was not very good.  Please just wait for another version to be uploaded"
