Music critic Mark Wilson calls Eric's 2005 release, More Regrets, "a masterpiece of dark, ambient textures, layered soundscapes and subtly hypnotic grooves." With More Regrets, we find Eric experimenting with different approaches to his sound, and this experimentation continued into his next project.
