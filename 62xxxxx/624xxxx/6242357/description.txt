ROY BUCHANAN THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION
Label Polydor 
Original Year 2006
Format:Mp3@320

A feast for seasoned guitar-slingers and apprentices alike, this collection features the master guitarist Roy Buchanan performing signature pieces like his instrumental version of "Sweet Dreams" as well as live versions of Al Green's "I'm a Ram" and the traditional blues "Hey Joe." Though Buchanan performs vocal duties creditably on the biblical "Story of Isaac" and "The Messiah Will Come Again," aficionados will be transfixed by the blistering guitar runs of "Five String Blues" and his sensitive playing on a live version of Neil Young's "Down By the River."
