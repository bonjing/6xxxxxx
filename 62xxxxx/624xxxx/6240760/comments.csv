It is highly recommended to use Little Snitch to block them - EyeTV (Elgato) is calling home.

Edit YOUR host-file (use the Host-Manager from Macupdate.com, it does a well job), Put following into the host:
127.0.0.1 services.eyetv.com
127.0.0.1 updates.elgato.com

Block it with Mac OSX Firewall too."
