One of Canada's finest singer/songwritersâ€“Well crafted lyrics and a voice that knows how to deliver them"-TC Magazine

Critically acclaimed in the press with frequent comparisons to artists such as Steve Earl, Tom Petty, Blue Rodeo, Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, Trevor Alguire tells tales of life on the roadâ€“â€“his words painting pictures of his country and its people.
It is these comparisons said of 'As of Yesterday' (his first release) that landed Alguire his first record dealâ€“â€“proving that Alguire was only at the start of such musical depth, finding himself label mates alongside his idols Steve Earle, John Hiatt, Kris Kristofferson, and Buddy Miller.
Having toured extensively now for years from coast to coast across Canada and Europe, Alguire's second album Thirty Year Run was released opening for Martha Wainwright at the international acclaimed Ottawa Bluesfest last year. 
Two of Alguire's songs have since been released on Blue Rose Records compilations along side (Gurf Morlix, Steve Earle & Dwight Yoakam.)
"Alguire smoothly mixes Alt.country, Americana and Roots rock with his strong vocals and creative songwriting to create 
'Now Before Us' one of those albums you cherish and keep on spinning
