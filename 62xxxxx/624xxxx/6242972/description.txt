    A photographer and his models go to an old, abandoned castle to shoot    
    some sexy covers for horror novels. Unbeknownst to them, the castle      
    is inhabited by a lunatic who believes himself to be the reincarnated    
    spirit of a 17th-century executioner whose job it is to protect the      
    castle against intruders.
