I watch this when waiting for a new episode from the original series; but it`s very hard, with Forest Withaker playing a very annoying, distracting and horrible part. -The way he moves, and talks, just fucks the whole thing up. -After a few episodes, I don`t get that annoyed anymore, but I really wish they kill him of, and but someone else in the lead-role instead!"
