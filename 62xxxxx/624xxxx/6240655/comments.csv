[T],Distrance,2011-03-15T01:07Z,"I wish others would appreciate my efforts enough to keep the torrents alive. It again shows only 0 seeds, even though my client shows that there should be 7 seeders already. I can not upload continuously so please seed instead of shutting down the torrent as your download finished :("
[T],Distrance,2011-03-16T18:01Z,"Well there aren't that many finished downloads at the beginning so more leechers is obvious. What I don't like is that I spent few first days seeding and have the torrent still end up with 0 seeds as those who finished it first have stopped the torrent so that they would not have to seed. I can only upload 1MB/s at maximum which is not much if you've 50+ leechers. Also often it doesn't even work at maximum speed.

As for your recommendations .. PeerBlock sounds good but it's not like I can tell in advance that who is seeding and who isn't so blocking people would be impossible .. No idea what the second recommendation is relevant to this and for third .. Well I was the one who uploaded this so I don't really understand that one either >."
[T],Distrance,2011-03-16T18:07Z,"I also do variety of other stuff on my computer that require full bandwidth so I can't seed 24/7. With that said, I feel my efforts being wasted when I seed for several days whenever I can ( which means I can't do that '' other stuff '' while seeding ), and still end up with 0 seeds + me.

Just look at my previous torrents .. The 2004 torrent has been up for over a month and it only has 1 seed left. 

I am running out of harddrive space as we speak. What this means is that I need to delete some of the older files which means that in exchange, I can no longer seed my old torrents .. Which is why it's essential that they would stay alive without me :x"
