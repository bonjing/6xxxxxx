After requests here and there to upload nice PS2 games working on the PCSX2 PC emulator and the first rumours information about more than 1000 pages that can be behind the upcoming GTA V on the argument , i decide to upload this file , easy autorun with keybord and gamepad already configurated and the game ready to go in windowed or full screen modes , here is a 3 minutes video showing the autorun working :

Please copy or write in succession the link to the address bar to go to the download page . Thank you .

NOTE : i tought like it was the keybord and the gamepad was already binded correctly but the essencial information of the binding was somewhere else on the computer , so i tested and looks that with this fix it will be ok including the normal automatic launch of the game without anything else running , please give it a try !

,vineet120,2011-03-15T11:01Z,globe@ - plz upload Assassins creed Brotherhood..........
,Ghanijazz,2011-03-15T12:20Z,running slow everything is good when in ride getting slow cpu running at 40% ram 30% but game slow
[V],globeplus,2011-03-15T14:05Z,"To vineet120 : i will get the game but the crack can take time to be available , i need the worked executable in order to do all the possible work properly and test him too , will see the development about the worked executable for this game , can be normal ? can be a python server emulator like assassins creed 2 ? can simply nothing be found in anyway ? well , will see what happen .

To ghanijazz : the game runs with normality with nice framerate and total normal graphics , maybe you can say that here and there a few and i mean a few frames less compared to the normality but no big deal for a ps2 emulator and a nice game certainly very positive and the version included is the latest available , so you get the best possible shot and you can always try things on the configuration of the plugins to improve too , but my friendly user , generally speaking for this game the emulation is really very good in my opinion .

Thanks for your comments ."
,Ghanijazz,2011-03-15T15:12Z,thanks anyway but u keep great uploading...never mind i will try with my ps3 to play this game
