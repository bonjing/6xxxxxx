Accountability is not a consequence ... it's your competitive advantage!

Early in the Minnesota Twins 2009 exhibition season, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire discovered a note on his desk from Justin Morneau, his star first baseman. It read: â€œGardy: I forgot to run sprints after the workouts yesterday; I am fining myself.â€ Next to the note was a hundred-dollar bill.

Entrepreneur, author, and speaker Sam Silverstein asks: Is Justin Morneau accountable because he's a superstar or is he a superstar because he's accountable?

In No More Excuses, Silverstein identifies the Five Accountabilities shared by all truly successful people and organizations.

â€¢ Shows why accountability gives businesses and individuals the competitive edge
â€¢ How to instill accountability throughout the enterprise
â€¢ How the Five Accountabilities can support both values and strategic intent.
â€¢ Includes interviews with 50 carefully chosen Accountability Masters from six continents and all walks of lifeâ€”including academics, Fortune 500 CEOs, and Hall of Fame athletes.

No More Excuses also features on-line resources for implementing and reinforcing each of the Five Accountabilities on a daily basis. Read itâ€”and expand your own Accountability Zone!
