YOU CAN ALSO WATCH IT HERE - http://vimeo.com/peaceoflove

or download from -(m e d i a fire)com [slash] peace)



3 iso\'s of dvd\'s from - http://netinetifilms.com

and 5 dvd rip\'s from the same site


* DVD    - 22,4 GB (.iso of part 1,2,3)
* DVDrip - 3,63 GB ( parts 1,2,3,4 & 6)


You can choose of course which do you want in your torrent program.


If you choose high quality (DVDs), please be sure to check the 4th & 6th 

dvd rip and other stuff as there is no corresponding dvd image to this.
(btw big thanks to Nikolai for supplying me the rip of fourth dvd and 

Orbem for rip no. 6 - team work right?)


As a bonus i add everything that i could find on Nisargadatta Maharaj

+ Awaken to the eternal - a movie probably most of you have
+ Tatvamasi - Nisargadatta biography which probably most of you don\'t have :P
+ all of nisargadatta\'s books and papers i dl\'d long time ago from ed2k, 
  I hope there is no virus in them :P ( can a virus be in .doc file?)
+ pictures
+ books and \'Waking from the trance\" program + some custom meditations of his student Stephen Wolinsky



Sorry for crappy description, but i hope it\'s enough...i\'m really busy and i have been preparing this torrent for like 2 years :P

I have also big adyashanti colleciton and all that, which i wanted to upload here long time ago as well. Last time i made uploads \'qigong collection\' and \'raw food 3\' it took me ages before i completed the description :D

Ok, enjoy my friends and much love 

one more thing,haha, i thought i would upload complete collection but day 

before uploading i noticed (after one guy has pointed out to me that most 

things which claim to be complete are not) that one more part is missing 

from netinetifilms.com - part 5 - \"moments with nisargadatta\".


Whoever has please share and mail me. (any other spiritual movies to 

share on the vimeo channel are welcomed, thank you)

Need anything? mail me or pm

love
qm
