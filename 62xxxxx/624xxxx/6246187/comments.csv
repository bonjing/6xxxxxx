,millennium5,2011-03-17T19:04Z,"This is crap, the vatican did not burn witches at the stake but Bible believing Christians, they called us Heretics because we red the Bible and believed more in the word of God that in the Pope. The pope by the way is the Antichrist as described in the Bible and the RCC is the Whore of Babylon.

And the Pope is behind the NWO too, beware of the second beast from revelation. Nicolas Cage is a Freemason and they are like all other secret societies controlled by the Vatican via its Gestapo the Jesuits."

1. this is a movie, chill out

2. this is not the best place to preach religious shit, quite frankly, no one cares anymore, and those who do are just hoping they get to 'heaven' which is of course a fairytale, that said, i hope you enjoyed the movie."

Millennium 5 - STFU, Please reserve the right to remain silent and more importantly the 5th amendment: no should admit to being a dimly-witted moron, unable to suspend theatrical disbelief, especially in such a public forum and open medium."

""Why use xvid for 720p instead of h264? ""


Maybe 'cos some players can`t handle H264, but they go well with Old good friend XviD. Why do I download XviD 720p and not H264? 'cos my girl have a PS3 and PS3 can't show subtitles unless the movie has them on a avi/divx container in Xsub format, we're from Argentina and we talk spanish.
There may be other reason as well.

Thanks TvTeam for Xvid HD movies."
