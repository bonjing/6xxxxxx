[T],program3r,2011-03-17T10:17Z,Does it all with subs?
[T],n2kmaster,2011-03-17T12:13Z,"Nope no subs, everythings english to as well. Even the oriental releases are english dubs"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-03-23T06:16Z,"K theres an issue that arose for some reason, 3 of the movies aren't the same sizes as listed with this torrent, Barb wire, Where the Wild things are and Gamer, if stops at like 98.7% dont worry you've gotten the whole thing, i have no idea why this torrent is all messed up all the sudden."
,BetlehemWhore,2011-04-21T01:56Z,"thanks! Really nice collection. please seed some, cheers!"
,BetlehemWhore,2011-04-22T17:26Z,"Come on n2kmaster, please seed and I promise to seed this back a month. Please, seed, seed.
;-) "
[T],n2kmaster,2011-05-06T04:22Z,"I am seeding, i never stop on my torrents unless i see 0 people interested, as long as i see 1 person trying to connect for a copy i always seed the torrent. Lets see you put out over 600 movies in 2 torrents for your ipod and keep tip top speed and not be the most popular gal at the ball lolololol"
,80cent,2011-07-16T04:52Z,@n2kmaster whats up? u said u seed but i look at seeders and it says 0 and there are 63 leechers. once its downloaded ill seed for a couple of days only prob is my connection isnt great but ill still seed. whats up with no seedin?
,mrhead91,2011-07-19T16:37Z,"good idea, but there is absolutely no seeds at all"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-22T21:10Z,actually if either of you two had descent torrent programs you'd see 3 seeds on it. And if you're gonna bitch how about you upload 700+ movies on 2 torrents constantly.
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-22T21:22Z,"not only that, 3 times MPAA zapped the machine hosting the torrents, thank god its firewalled and fed thru a network drive or they wouldve gotten the pc itself. I just rebuilt the machine and theres still 3 seeders on it."
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-22T21:25Z,"annnnnnd I'll add the other movie pack has 57 seeders on it, i don't seed my stuff eh, funny stuff."
,Ballefar81,2011-07-29T19:05Z,"Stopped at 98,7% :-/"
