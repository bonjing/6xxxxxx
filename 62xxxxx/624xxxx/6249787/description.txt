Another fresh beta release from today...
Still as beta stage but quite stable in fact.
Try at your own risk
Btw however final release of VLC 1.1.8 should be out at the end of this month.
Enjoy
seed with me asap,please !
as long as you can...
Ty for understanding
file is 100% clean,untouched and 100% trust
I repeat :
i just convert it in 7-zip for more convenience
this is just the direct setup executable that has been compressed to 7-z(7-zip)
so please,don't tell me i am dangerous for that.
I don't try to hide any crapware,virus or spyware inside this archieve for such thing.
Anyway,i saw many users downloaded it and i have never get any bad feedback about.
If you are suspicious about...then just don't download it,that's all !
or you trust and believe me or...not !
As far as i know i propose,you decide...therefore in this way,you are not forced to download it so.
Hope i've been clear about... 
therefore now i wish you have and get a pleasant download for this torrent.
note : you must give at least min 50 ko/s speed up from your part.
try at least 30 ko/s if you have a low slow speed up
if you freeze,then disconnect and retry with more speed up
by the fact i'm seeding multi-torrent,trafic can be a bit slow or else
Sometimes traffic congestion can appear also...
I try to fix and regularising it as well.But this is not so easy like that.
just be patient and you should get it.
Sometimes i must stop or temporary suspend a specific seed to increase or improve another one.
You know all about now...
ty for your interest
