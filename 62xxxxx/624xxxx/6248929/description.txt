Born on the original Christmas Day in the stable next door to Jesus, Brian (Graham Chapman) grows up to join an anti-Roman separatist group. But as he tries to escape trouble with the law, he finds himself reluctantly thrust into the role of the Messiah. Monty Python legends John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Michael Palin co-star in this classic religious satire that pokes fun at fanaticism and hypocrisy.
