Islam is truly horrific, the ultimate dead end of a society that decends into anarchy, mass murder and ignorance. I recommend everyone to watch this, the fog must lift on the wests lack of knowledge on this totalitarian and completely evil ideology."

,tywdyfor,2011-03-16T00:07Z,"Quote ""some Muslim parents tried to force their Jewish sons to convert to Islam""- What?!!!!. 
I'll bet all those that died in 911 loved Muslim 'freedom of choice'"
,bafridi,2011-03-19T21:22Z,"@ tywdyfor: Brother I'm wondering, how can you miss the Quranic verse ""Let there be no compulsion in religion"" and also the REASON why this verse was revealed, If you mention anything out of context, then it seems something else, and dear don't get blinded by the Media, do some research 9/11 is an inside job and now most of the people know that, watch this for some info watch the video with title :""We'll Blame It On The Muslims, Naturally"" - 1996 by TheFlexEffect

btw Brother, Muslims love the humanity, here is the verse from Quran which shows the Extraordinary Value of Human Life, ""On that account We ordained for the Children of Isra`il that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole humanity: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole humanity. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear (guidance), yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land. (5:32)"
