But next time, can you upload a 300mb version?  These ones can be a bit choppy at times for me.

Please consider it.  Thanks"

,dude2x187,2011-03-15T06:50Z,"I also had to create an account just to say something. First of all great job on uploading these amazing quality episodes. And second of all, if you do begin uploading lower quality episodes, please don't stop uploading these HD ones. The guy up there who wants crappy quality episodes can easily find them just by googling it. But these episodes in HD are hard to find. You're one of the few who uploads in HD. So please continue uploading the high quality ones. Thanks BurgundyRanger!"

For episode 7, I'll upload torrents for both versions -- HD first. We'll see what the stats are to see if doing both is viable when episode 8 airs on April 10."

thanks"
[T],burgundyranger,2011-03-16T20:48Z,"I don't have any other versions. After reading the comments, I decided to check to see if I could play them. (I have no need since I watch the show on TV each week) I found that the picture froze for me too. A little googling led me to download the KLite Standard codec pack and now the files play just fine in WMP. Still have issues with Real Player and QuickTime."
