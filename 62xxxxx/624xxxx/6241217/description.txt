Here are three cds of mash-ups, of sorts, of Beatles, and solo Beatles, music. The makers of these cds took two different versions of a song, edited them together, and created a new version. For instance, on Volume 1, there's a version of "Love Me Do" with both Ringo and Pete Best drumming. There's artwork with each volume but, for complete track details, go to bootlegzone.com. In reviews of this series some people find it really interesting and creative, and some think it's crap. Feel free to judge for yourselves.
