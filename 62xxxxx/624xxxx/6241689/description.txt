A neurotic and unhappily married man falls in love with his transvestite cousin in this quirky Italian comedy. Leo is an obsessive and unhappy man. He is married to Simona and the two are miserable. He suffers many psychosomatic ailments and real phobias, such as an allergic reaction to cheese fumes, and a dread of being locked in a bathroom. When accidently does lock himself in a public bathroom, he becomes hysterical until he is rescued by a class call-girl Giulia. She had been watching him from a distance. She takes the unconscious Leo home. When Leo awakens he discovers that Giulia is really his cousin and former playmate Gioulio who admits to always having loved Leo. Initially Leo rejects Giulia's new life style and shrugs her off as a confused man, but gradually he comes to love her in every way.
