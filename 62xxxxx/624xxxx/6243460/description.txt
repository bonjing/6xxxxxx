ok here\'s the deal. 

the last two strokes albums have been composed of 50% great songs and 50% terrible songs. so i got to thinking..what if i took the good songs off each album and combined them to make one great album?

so here it is, half of angles and half of first impressions, put together to make an album that is just as good as Is This It?

if you want, you can just pretend that the strokes last 2 albums never happened, and that this album followed room on fire. i won\'t blame you.
