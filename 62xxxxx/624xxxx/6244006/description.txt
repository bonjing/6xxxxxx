Both Jane Russell and her uncredited stunt double look great in skimpy swimwear throughout the Technicolor and SuperScope romantic adventure Underwater. Ms. Russell is cast as the wife of fortune-chasing Richard Egan, who takes her along to the Caribbean on a treasure hunt. The couple is accompanied by mercenary Gilbert Roland, priest Robert Keith, and Egan's blonde-doxy secretary Lori Nelson. While exploring the depths in search of untold riches, the little party is menaced by a band of modern-day pirates, led by Joseph Calleila. Partially filmed on location in Mexico, Underwater was completed in a newly-constructed underwater tank in an RKO Radio soundstage. For its world premiere, Underwater was projected on a submerged movie screen at Silver Springs Florida, and the invited guests were encouraged to don aqualungs and bathing uits so that they could watch the picture while swimming! A similar publicity ploy was utilized nine years later at Marineland of the Pacific for the premiere of The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1955).
