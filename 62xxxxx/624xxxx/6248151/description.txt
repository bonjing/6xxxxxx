Britney Spears announces her seventh studio album is titled Femme Fatale. The iconic global superstarâ€™s title Femme Fatale is a tribute to bold, empowered, confident, elusive, fun, flirty women and men. Itâ€™s not a conceptual album, Spears is letting the music speak for itself. Sheâ€™s worked hard on it for two years and she considers it to be her â€œbest album to date,â€ true to where she is now personally and professionally. Femme Fatale (Jive Records) is executive produced by Max Martin and Dr. Luke. Few artists have earned the distinction of having five No.1 debut albums, and 24 Top 40 hits. She most recently set a new one-day precedent for single sales with her current No. 1 hit song, â€œHold It Against Me.â€. Jonas Ã…kerlaund shot the video for the song. Spears is peerless among her contemporaries. Throughout the years, Britney has consistently released hit after hit for over a decade, selling close to 70 million albums cumulatively worldwide.
