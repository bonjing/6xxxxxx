You delude yourself if you think what you're doing isn't wrong. You could at least be a man and admit it. It is software piracy and it IS copright infringement to use a product you have no license for, and it really doesn't matter if you think Creative Assembly deserve shit.

I understand some excuses like ""I don't have the cash to splash on this"" or ""I wouldn't have bought this anyway"", but what I can't understand is someone playing a game (such as yourself) and calling the developer and the game itself shit. Why do you play their games then? No one forced you.

But then again --- you have exclusively uploaded Nazi bullshit here on thepiratebay, so maybe that explains why you have shit for brains."

It's the turn based campaign that just doesn't work, it's like Civ but really unfocused and eventually easy (more like an RPG than an RTS).

I skipped Empires and Napoleon just because that era looked really gay but Shogun was my dead favorite.

No rush to buy it right away though, these games always need to be patched to hell and back and always have an expansion or two holding back features.

Save your money until the full deal is released and patched."

I didnt say it was complete crap after i have modded the game it will no doubt have better AI.

I was arguing against the guy for he said CA assembly deserved to get paid because he apparently thinks their great.

NOT. Perhaps Shogun 2 will have awesome AI i dont know. What i DO KNOW is that for instance a team of TWO people managed to make a extremely good game with awesome AI and decent graphic PLUS historical accuracy (""Take Command:Second Manassas"") Whitout the CA budget.

Which means CA SUCKS and does NOT deserve our money until they treat us with respect instead of retards even if some of us clearly are retarded......

With that said.....yes i will probably buy this game anyway but only because im retarded."

@Knaster

From what i remember the AI problems started happening when they switched to 3D, but it still does not account for the broken features in the Medieval 2 campaign and apparently Empire and Napoleon were terrible games.

If i was to take a guess it is that they are pumping all their money into the graphic end of things, graphics are nice but an RTS really needs more than just pretty pictures.

Shogun 2 is a good chance for them to stop fucking around and get it done right.

Also i figured out how to get the original Shogun working on Vista with the newer Nvidia cards, you need to disable Hardware Acceleration (on Vista this means downloading Direct X control panel)"

Its called intellectual property m8.

and you only have to pay for it for 50 years after the writer made it then its free.

I think thats fair cos it means bands and writers can make a living from their work.

However I have no sympathy for any big LTD or INC company. if you look up company law they are actually classed as a legal person or ""entity"" and infact have more rights than any human being. oh yea, and they live forever-or untill they go bust.

,Nick13ro,2011-03-15T19:41Z,Actually the copyright length in the US is 95 years from publication or 120 from creation. It started with far more reasonable lenghts: 14 years and if the author survived it was extended another 14 and that's it. At this rate the publishing monopolies will want to extend copyright to more than 2000 years and demand copyright from anybody selling a Bible.

Again, more proof that we need to pirate and fuck these big companies up!

What use is the writer going to have for a 2000 year copyright? hel be dead!

only companies can profit from this who deserve none of it. It should be released to the public for free as it was baisically their property from the beginning.

Now I have the shakes real bad, been looking forward to this game for ages, but whenever I try to install the game from ISO, Steam just pops up and starts downloading it. 

Seems like a waste, considering the fact that I've already got the files on my harddrive, but I can't figure out how to install the game locally.

Does anyone have any useful tip for me? I'll buy you a beer if you do."
,haggisofdeath,2011-03-15T21:20Z,"@Mesko2 

Not the same thing. game artists, programmers and writers get paid SALARIES.

CEOs and publishers ruin the game and try make big profits based on SALES

The real people whos job it is to make the game dont get paid very much and certainly do not get paid based on sales.

try actually learning about an industry before you support it.

Music is very different. Bands get paid per sale of the product and therefore rely upon fans buying albums.

I wish people would formulate their own opinions for once and not believe the shit they see on TV."
,Bendico,2011-03-15T21:42Z,"@haggisofdeath

You're right and you're wrong. Yes, they have fixed salaries, but if the company cannot afford to pay them and has to fill bankruptcy because the business isn't bringing in the dough then you know the reason --- bad sales. Why? If people couldn't pirate I know am sure that at least 50% would buy the game even if it means that they can barely pay the rent. People are that addicted to games.

I know of a Swedish developer that had bad sales (but made great games) that went bankrupt. The financial crisis also hit them hard, but still...

This is also the reason a lot of developer's prefer making a multiplayer game."
