,Mahekun64,2011-03-15T21:30Z,@Jimstalk I'm not taking request's at the moment because I am new here. I WILL BE taking request's in a month or so until I get a hang of the bay XD. Sorry but I won't be able to grant your request/wish. BECAUSE you made a bad first impression. kthxbai
,Mahekun64,2011-03-15T21:31Z,@Jimstalk I WON'T give your request because you made a bad first impression KTHXBAI
,Mahekun64,2011-03-15T21:31Z,oops 2 comments EEP sorry if you are reading this staff =S
,Jimstalk,2011-03-16T15:47Z,"bad impression???WTF DUDE??I just gave you some advise.......

If someone makes a request in your torrent page,that doesnt mean that YOU have to upload it asap...Generally speaking he DOES NOT REQUEST IT FROM YOU.Next time just read the request..If you cant buy the addon (or cant crack it) then just ignore his request.Its not just you who reads this stuff.Another ''pirate'' may work on that..........:)

Ohhh, thanks for the Super Cub........

,mysteryfancy,2011-03-17T14:50Z,"Oh man, I was so glad when the full-Proll catshit finally kept his mouth is naughty and everything was peaceful again. Let it here guys. Reconciled to you and give you a hand. We are pleased and grateful that we have this center and you as Uploader. Jim was certainly no dispute. He wanted to explain to you just the rules here because you're new. Apologies that I was here involved, but in friendship is all beautiful. That's what I mean."
,mysteryfancy,2011-03-17T14:54Z,"Sorry. For those who do not know. The Catshit was a, well, bad user here"
,Jimstalk,2011-03-17T19:00Z,"@mysteryfancy

Some months ago i requested from a tpb admin to block catshit's IP or delete his account from their database.A few weeks ago i finally received the following answer :""Dear Jimstalk,thanks for informing us on time.Our team has checked your issue and we succesfully blocked the user catshit1 from our account database.The reason is:user misconduct,abuse,spamming,bad language.Unfortunately there is no permanent ban in such cases which means that this account will be reopened soon.Thank you for keeping our community clean.Please let us know for other problems.

,Jimstalk,2011-03-17T19:02Z,At least he wont be able to download any addons...........at the moment.....
,mysteryfancy,2011-03-18T12:53Z,"@ Jimstalk

Thanks Jim, that you have catshit then shot down. A minimum of decency, respect and honor in the community must be. But this is only my personal opinion.
Sorry, but I write a miserable English"
,chuckmamuck,2011-03-19T15:54Z,"ahhh, the legendary catshit1, the master antagonist.
he exsists cus you let him, he winds you up, you attack him(which is what he wants) and the monster evolves.
best thing to do with ppl like that is ignore them, if you dont feed them they quickly die off.

is this any different to the other otters on here?
i think i'm using V1.11 "
