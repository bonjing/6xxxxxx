Why spend money on importing this bad boy(or girl in this case)when you can get it from here for free? What I am bringing to you is the 5 Disc OST from the January 2010 smash hit video game from SEGA Bayonetta which is only available in Japan whereas the one we got was called the \"Climax Edition\" which featured only a few songs from the game unlike this bad girl that includes all the songs featured in one of the finest SEGA games since Sonic Adventure.

Yours, for free, in a compressed 2.85GB file, aren't you lucky=P

For a list of all the songs listed in this file, please click the link below.

Please note that you must have 7zip to extract this file and the song format for these is .WAV and no I am not converting them to .Mp3 files.

Enjoy, seed, leech and comment ^_^
