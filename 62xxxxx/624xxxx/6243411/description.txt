Part 3. Indian Art
Griff Rhys Jones goes to India in search of exquisite textiles. Can he solve the mystery of an extraordinary Indian floor cloth kept in Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire for over 300 years? Who made it and does the skill that produced such a work still exist? Griff travels to Gujarat in India, famed throughout history for its beautiful hand made textiles. He goes off the beaten tracks to the towns and villages of the north west plains and discovers how centuries old printing, dyeing and embroidery techniques are still the cornerstones to a way of life and are full of meaning. Finally, he travles to the heart of one of the most reclusive and fiercely traditional societies in India, the Rabari, who are famed for their toughness and their astonishing embroidery. But can the custom of spending decades making dowry gifts survive in the 21st century?
