Center of the Universe: Anachronisma

The most sentimental album by the C.O.U. put out so far. Part one in a trilogy about time and space, this album is a retrospective on the popular music from the last century, all wrapped up in sheets of folk-instruments, anachronisms and whistleable melodies.
