The critically acclaimed single-player experience of Assassin's Creed is back and better than ever as Ezio returns in an epic struggle against the powerful Templar Order.

Now a legendary Master Assassin, Ezio must journey into Italy's greatest city, Rome, center of power, greed and corruption to strike at the heart of the enemy. Defeating the corrupt tyrants entrenched there will require not only strength, but leadership, as Ezio commands an entire Brotherhood that will rally to his side. Only by working together can the Assassins defeat their mortal enemies.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers a never-before-seen multiplayer layer. Players can help the Templars by using Abstergo to train in the art of Assassination to eliminate the Assassins once and for all. Players can choose from a wide range of unique characters, each with their own signature weapons and assassination techniques, and match their skills against other players from all over the world in different game modes.

Bugs and Comments

* It is _not_ advisable to install the game into the Windows folder (usually
 C:\Windows), a subfolder of the Windows folder, nor the root of the system
 drive (usually C:\).

* It is recommended to close all other running programs before installing the
 game, to reduce the risk of software conflicts.

* If using the Saitek P2600 Rumble Force Pad, it is recommended to use the
 drivers published by Saitek (see section 3.2) instead of the drivers that come
 with Windows. With the Windows drivers, you may need to remap the Up/Down axis
 of the right stick through the in-game options menu for it to work properly.

* ATI Eye Infinity and Matrox TripleHead2Go
 These peripherals are supported in the singleplayer mode but not in multiplayer.

* MadCatz Modern Warfare controller
 To use this pad, install the madcatz, saitek software. Then use the pad in-game
 with a mouse/keyboard configuration. (the madcatz, saitek software emulates a mouse
 and keyboard)  http://www.madcatz.com/Default.asp?Page=213
 It works as a keyboard mouse emulator instead of native gamepad controls.

* Generic controllers display problem in Hud and Menu
 On some controllers with letter buttons, the game will display them as numbers using
 DirectInput.

* If using Realtek High Definition Audio, Soundmax HD Audio, or nForce Audio, you
 may experience sound anomalies. To work around the problem, reduce the Hardware
 acceleration slider to 'Basic' in the Windows Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio
 Devices -> Audio tab -> Advanced -> Performance tab.

* Some SFX are playing too loud when the sfx setting is at 1.

* If using an AMD dual-core processor, you may experience fast flickering of the
 in-game menu items. To work around this problem, install the AMD Dual-Core
 Optimizer available on the AMD web site (see section 3.2).

* If you experience graphical corruption, make sure your graphics driver's
 control panel is _not_ configured to override application settings.
