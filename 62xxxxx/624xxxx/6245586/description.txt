This is an outstanding recording transferred with great care using very good gear. This is not my rip. Thanks to the original uploader and his fantastic cartridge!

Vinyl LP transfer at 24-bit 192khz so if your PC soundcard doesnt support it, or you want to burn to cd, youll have to convert the files to 16 bit 44.1 khz.
