He has 21 CD's as a leader to date, and has been a featured sideman with Stanley Turrentine, Jack McDuff, and Kevin Mahogany, among others. Gary Giddins in the Village Voice calls him â€œone of the most distinctive guitarists to come along in recent years.â€ He was voted one of the Top Ten Guitarists in the 2001 Critics and Readers poll of Down Beat, and has been elected a Rising Star in the 2004-2007 Downbeat Critics Poll.

Stryker grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, moved to New York City in 1980, and joined organist Jack McDuff's group, travelling all over the U.S. for two years (1984-85). From 1986 to 1995, and 1998-2000 Stryker played with tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, performing at all the major festivals, concert halls, and clubs throughout the world.
