A man struggling to start his life over finds love under unexpected circumstances in this stylized drama from Greek director Panos Koutras. After serving fourteen years in prison, Yiorgos (Yiannis Kokiasmenos) is released and makes his to Athens, where he hopes to find the son he hasn't heard from in years. Checking into a cheap hotel, Yiorgos meets a woman named Strella (Mina Orfanou), who makes her living as a prostitute. Yiorgos and Strella end up spending the night together, and when he wakes up Yiorgos is confident he's found the woman of his dreams -- and isn't at all troubled by the fact Strella is a transsexual. With Strella by his side, Yiorgos feels confident he can mend his broken relationship with his son and make a fresh start, but it isn't long before he's confronted with a burden from his past he may not be able to shake. Strella (aka A Woman's Way) was an official selection at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival.
