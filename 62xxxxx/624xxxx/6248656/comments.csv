Because I'm the only seeder."
,bob.lb,2011-03-18T17:31Z,"Slow? You're kidding, right? I only downloaded what I didn't have (the new album and the B-sides), but this was done in under six minutes. Without a doubt the fastest torrent I've ever used. I'll definitely seed."
,StereoMaster,2011-03-30T14:28Z,"MORE SEEDERS/LEECHERS = Faster you get :)

Know is it a good speed of this torrent.
If there are new songs or albums I update this one :)"
