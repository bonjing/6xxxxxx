,munna_m,2011-03-19T13:15Z,plz do more in 3d
,munna_m,2011-03-19T17:08Z,"downloaded it. unsatisfied because of high file size and low resolution.normal resolution is high but when it is played in stereoscopic player, resolution decreases.
i have downloaded another looneytunes episode from other uploader. it was great with low file size of about 100mb and hi-resolution.
i'm not degrading u but try to do in less size with hi quality"
,raster,2011-04-08T21:59Z,"munna_m I put up good torrents allways.

This is 2011 in 2011 20gig film is small. you can buy a 2Tb HDD for under ÂŁ70 download speeds in uk suck but still we can get from 10mbit to 100mbit.

300mb for 3D program is good.

And I was only seeing how menny would take it.

Next to come tomorow will be ""Dark Country 3D Half SBS""
