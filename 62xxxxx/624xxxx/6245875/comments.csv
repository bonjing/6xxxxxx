,kaz050,2011-03-17T07:19Z,"@Devilishredbeardishness

If u can run AC2 fine on what ever settings u had on it then u can run this no problem. only downside too not paying for it is not being able too invest in shops.
@vate1973 
i dont see it as a problem in ACBH even with all low settings u still get shadows and depends on your setup u have going on or u playing it on a labtop?"

Same goes to those who can't save, since this torrent installed perfectly for 99% of the other users, it's clearly something to do with your computers, try Googling the problem first."

,lowstandards,2011-03-18T18:45Z,"confirmed downloaded and works.  Of course, it's Skidrow.  However, this game runs like crap on my pc!  

Intel i-7 860 quad core o/c 4.0Ghz
8GB Corsair DDR3 
ATI HD 5870 @default speeds
Corsair Vertex2 SSD

Fraps says I'm getting constant 40-60fps (I use v-sync) but the game just stutters a lot and is sluggish.  And that is at 1920x1080, no aa, max graphics.  

Please bear in mind that Assassin's creed 2 ran like butter on my system.  I am also playing currently Dragon age 2, GTA4, Splinter Cell Conviction, Dead Space 2, Dirt 2, and Just Cause 2 with maxed graphics and they run silky smooth.  

Weird that AssCreed Brotherhood runs like crap. And you know how smooth it has to be to time the climbing and combat.  

Anyone else having these issues?  "

,jakalbrow,2011-03-19T18:10Z,"Like some of the users around here, i've been experiencing a crash to desktop problem while launching the game.
Specifically, when it is launched, the ubisoft logo starts animation, but before completion the game crashes, showing a white rectangle at the top left corner of the screen while keeping a black background around the rest of the screen.
I downloaded the clone dvd, updated the game with ""ac_brotherhood_1.01_online"" and used skidrow's crack on the ""online"" folder (both contained in torrent found at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6250690/Assassins.Creed.Brotherhood.FULL.v1.01.Update-SKIDROW)
I tried the P2P release as well, before updating, and disconnected the internet cable. The same issue occurred, making me think this isn't a crack issue, but rather a system one.
I'm running a windows 7 ultimate 32bit recently clean installed (1.5 weeks), and went after .NET framework 4.0, visual c++ 2005, 2008 and 2010, XNA framework, java, directX 11, knowing that these are requirements for most games.
My specs are:
AMD Phenom II X4 965 black edition
ASUS m2r32-mvp (a little outdated, i know)
Two Kingston 2GB ddr2 in dual channel
Sapphire Radeon HD 5870 1GB GDDR5 (latest driver)
Corsair VX550W power supply.
Am I missing anything needed to run it, soft or hardware-wise?
Some feedback would be greatly appreciated."

,2012637,2011-03-21T02:59Z,"Upload: 10 (Works)
DL Speed: 2 (15-30 kbps)
Game: 10
Graphics: 7.5
Overall: 9

The gameplay continues to be awesome (this is definitely just a large DLC from AC2; Definitely not worthy of another title in the series).

Graphics are NOT what I expected. You would think Ubisoft would have taken the time to perfect not only the gameplay aspects that were lacking from the second game (which they certainly rounded quite well) but the visual imperfections as well. The shadows (even in DX11) continue to be flawed; The foreground continues to jitter quite noticeably as well. This has been the 3rd release and Ubisoft have still not managed to port; If your monitor does not support 16:9 resolutions, expect to have the annoying black bars that take up an inch on the top and bottom of your screen. (And yes, considering this is the 3rd release in the series this does now count as a flaw).

Also note I run this game on max; 40+ constant frames per second in DX11.

So... overall? I would give this game a 9, simply due to the fact that you stay considerably ""hooked"" throughout the entire game while having to deal with the minor yet annoying graphical flaws.

A+ for Skidrow yet again as well as the uploader.

Thanks guys and happy pirating!

P.S. I am making sure to seed as I felt extremely disappointed downloading at 30 kbps. Please be sure to do the same with any and all torrents you download. It saves us all a lot of time!

Cheers!"

I would download the game and not buy it because its not worth 60 bucks ( or 50 euro). I finished the game in 2 days, and didnt even play die hard. There will be a assassins creed 4 because the ending sucked. Well, after you finished the game, there is not much else to do. I uninstalled after wards because multiplayer isn't availebale. Its a great game, great story, graphics, animations, ect but like the previous ones, the duration of the game and the availability of locations is very dissapointing. To bad you dont have more locations to play with apart from Rome."

Read the reviews bro, personally I think this is the best Assassin's Creed, I played through the other two, usually the endings are a bit wacky, but I can excuse that because the game play is so original and exciting. People told me the multiplayer would get old quick, but I can't get over walking around the Al Hambra and just owning confused bewildered people. If you liked Assassin's creed you'll love this!"

It probably has something to do with multilingual versions of windows.

I tried reverting the language back in english, but it didnâ€™t help at all(maybe a reinstall would help). Anyway I found a solution to our problem:

1. Find file â€˜ACBrotherhood.iniâ€™. I Installed the game in a different partition, than the OS one, and in the root of that partition, ACB created a folder baring its name(Assassinâ€™s Creed Brotherhood), in which saved the gpu/keyb preferences.

2. In that folder create a subfolder named Saves.

That ought to do it. Have fun ppl.

P.S. In case the game cannot create new saves for some bizarre reason, try using these  (They are 3 newly created saves. You â€˜ll probably need to have the updated version of the game though 1.01 for these to work properly)."

Problem is that ACB doesnt support special characters when saving. so if your c:\Users\""name"" has any special chars game wont save.

Solution is next: in control panel open user accounts and create a new account without any special chars like: ACB, Mark, Marry, Play, Karthus... :)
switch to that account and play the game. It should save properly now.

I downloaded the Patch http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6277327/Assassins_Creed_Brotherhood_SKIDROW_patch_1.01__DLC_unlocker_and and the crack by skidrow in utorrent.  SKIDROW folder contains ABCSP.exe and AssassinsCreedBrotherhood.exe . I mounted the game in BD-ROM(:H). I click (:H) and installed the game to Local Disk (:C). I copied the crack to the folder. I clicked the game-ABCSP.exe .... and still it needs a serial key! What does 4. Copy all files from SKIDROW folder to the game installation? what does game installation mean? is it the one in the BD-ROM H or the one in my local disk D?

Open it and you will see a SKIDROW folder. Go inside it and copy all files inside. ACBSP AssassinsCreedBrotherhood and SKIDROW. Copy it and paste it to the installed folder and replace those existing ACBSP and the others there that had the same name as the one in the SKIDROW folder. now you cn play it without serial number."

you don't need to take any extra steps, the bink dll error is because of you didn't copy pasted the cracked .exes in right places, you have to undo the steps you've done then copy one file to c program files and the other to where you installed the game and replace originals, then play. hope this helps."

1) Try to update your Video drivers & check again.

I found the Special Edition w/ The Officer unlockable and The Trajan Market for super cheap (not going to mention where) for less than £20 - it's worth it.

1) Mount a virtual drive, install the game to C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher if using 64 bit windows or
C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher if using 32 bit windows
Make sure you install it of drive C, not D, M or Z...
2) on the virtual drive open the UPDATE folder and launch the updater.
3) on the virtual drive open SKIDROW folder and copy all two files
4) paste these files to Ubisoft Game Launcher folder
5) just to be sure, launch skidrow.exe and press space button to exit
6) now launch AssassinsCreedIIGame.exe and play the game

3. install it to wherever
4. after installing, go to your ""sr-acbrh"" again, open ""SKIDROW"", copy everything inside and paste into your main brotherhood folder, click replace.

In that folder u have three .exe files copy the ones named ACBSP.exe and AssassinsCreedBrotherhood.exe. The one named skidrow.exe is not nessecary.

Now go to the folder to where u installed the came by default this would be c:/program/ubisoft/Assassin's Creed Brotherhood/ (dont know if the english version of windows is using c:/program). in this folder paste the 2 files u just copied and press replace al. now start the game.
Enjoy

P.s the reason it ask u for serial is becuse u havent cracked it. do as above and it wont ask.
this version can only be played in offline mode,"

Great work Guys! I checked out different people's comments on how to unpack and work this :)

Running Windows 7 X86bit. 
Nvidia Ge-force GTX 260 - 1440-900 resolution
and it looks great with no problems what so ever :D


1.Unpacked all into 1 folder using Winrar.
2.Run the set up and let install.
3.Back where you unpacked all the files is a folder called Skidrow. Copy Skidrow.exe and paste it in C://programe Files/ Ubisoft/ ubisoft game launcher.
4. Now in the skid row folder there are 2 other icons. Copy and paste them in C://[programe Files/ Ubisoft/ Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
5. When it asks.. Make sure you replace it.
6. Then i went back into Ubisoft game launcher and ran Skidrow.exe and then back to Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and ran the ACBSP.EXE.

It did not ask for a serial key and runs perfectly.
And for those who want to play it online needs to find/download a crack."

1. Download it
2. Mount the cd-image (i used dameon tools)
3. Run the setup and install it where you want
4. copy the things in skydrow into the folder weher you installed the game
5. run the game and have fun

if you get an error like : d3dx9.dll is missing from your computer. you will need to install directX other wise it wont work. if it ask for the serial key you didnt copyed the crack into the gamefolder or not corectly. if its shut down after a few secounds maybe there were problems while downloading.

,Luuk1151,2011-06-17T13:53Z,"@Haxeboyy you don't need a serial key. It's cracked.
1. Download game
2. Mount the game
3. Install the game
4. Open the download file with PowerIso
5. Move all the files from the SKIDROW-folder to the place where the game is installed. Don't move the SKIDROW-folder, only the files in it.
6. If you all those things, you don't need a serial key."
,Luuk1151,2011-06-17T13:57Z,@rawoofi I read on a site that you have to cope the files (the SKIDROW.exe) to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher. Paste it in that file. I did this and the game works fine.

,scooting,2011-06-19T08:34Z,"Thanks to EnglandFighter, it's working perfectly. His explanation is on page 43, but I'll just copy it here.

1.Unpacked all into 1 folder using Winrar.
2.Run the set up and let install.
3.Back where you unpacked all the files is a folder called Skidrow. Copy Skidrow.exe and paste it in C://programe Files/ Ubisoft/ ubisoft game launcher.
4. Now in the skid row folder there are 2 other icons. Copy and paste them in C://[programe Files/ Ubisoft/ Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
5. When it asks.. Make sure you replace it.
6. Then i went back into Ubisoft game launcher and ran Skidrow.exe and then back to Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and ran the ACBSP.EXE.

P.S: if this is your first time installing a skidrow game, don't be alarmed when you run the skidrow.exe file. Just let the credits roll and press ESC when they're done.

Once again, many thanks to EnglandFighter for the explanation and extremezone for the .iso! "

I hope this helps someone a bunch.

4. Playing smoothly, no crashes so far - AC2 Skidrow release would crash on me occasionally. Bonus outfits unlocked, so the DLC unlocker must be working; meaning the side quest should also be unlocked, but I haven't gone that far into the story to confirm.

,streetbum149,2011-08-25T09:10Z,you guys must be fuckin retarded or something. one of you expected multi-player and another expected arkham city?!? its not even out yet man! only logical question even asked was about weather or not it effected all games with a ubisoft launcher. i don't think it does as long as you only start it from the crack. meaning if you try to start it from the other one (there's two exe's) it will launch the ubisoft downloader and patch AC Brotherhood. the only thing that will screw up is this game because the crack wont work.

,0Convergence0,2011-11-22T08:10Z,"This is not a multiplayer crack, no offence skid, it's cool what you do, but I don't think you'd know how to bypass server authorization. Game isn't what I expected it to be. It's some kind of futuristic timetravel shit in the back of a van in arabia, all of the medieval assassination stuff is some guy hooked up to a dream/memory monitoring computer system. I was like what the fuck.. and all of the cutscenes, dammit the cutscenes! There's too many, it's a burden to even skip them. I hate the loading screens too. Shit tier game; would not reccomend. "

,stevemasta,2011-12-03T20:52Z,Which image am I to mount/burn and how does that even work? My game is extremely laggy: can't even walk out of the first room with the alien chick who got done talking to desmond
,DonSpark,2011-12-04T14:22Z,"@stevemasta 
-points at description- there is only ONE iso file in the folder you just downloaded. Mount the iso file, click on ""open"" instead of running the autorun and double click the ""setup"" exe. After installing DO NOT play, but go to the disk again, copy everything from inside and paste in Program Files/Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. Now ur free to play. To fix the lag just lower the graphics or get a better graphics card.

@pentdragon00 
if you wanna play online, buy the original. Cracked games dont have multiplayer access."

Dude Stfu and get out your parents basement. Assassins creed has a story, An actually well thought out story. Go back and play your brain dead COD games with all the other 8 year olds on Xbox live and leave the work of art to us real gamers. What idiot bashes a game because he cant understand it. This is the 3rd title. Go play the first 1."

,oobio,2012-01-04T01:19Z,"SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE WITH PRODUCT ACTIVATION!

1. Download the Torrent. If you cannot successfully complete this step, I can't help you.

2. Look at what you just downloaded. There should be a BIG file called ""sr-acbrh.iso"". Mount this image with a program such as PowerISO or DAEMON Tools, both of which have Torrents on TPB and guides on usage online.

3. After Mounting, if it doesn't prompt you (which it should), go to Computer and install.

4. IMPORTANT: Do not try to play the game after installing because you will be asked for a SERIAL! That is the reason for the crack. Instead, go to Computer (or My Computer), right click the Brotherhood icon, press open (do not RUN it) and go into the ""SKIDROW"" folder. Copy the files inside.

5. Almost there! If you don't already know, find out if you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit machine:

32-bit: Place the copied files into C: Program Files/Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

64-bit: Place the copied files into C: Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

6. Exit out of all the windows and junk that was open. You can now go into Computer and double click the Brotherhood icon to play without a serial. You should see a ""Skidrow"" window shortly before playing.

I hope this helped. If the game runs slowly, try turning down the graphics. Otherwise you might need a better video card."
,AlphaCrazyyZ,2012-01-04T02:19Z,@Donspark Will this remove the need to activate the game ?

,BluLegion,2012-01-24T14:32Z,"Works perfectly, a great release. However there is one problem: it seems that, to buy weapons you have to invest in shops, which can only be done when logged in (which can't be done with this torrent afaik). Is there a way to bypass that and just buy some frikken weapons? Or is Ubisofts attempt at working DRM actually successful for once? I don't really care about Multiplayer for now, but I'd sure like the ABILITY TO BUY SOME GODDAMN WEAPONS IN SINGLEPLAYER. Fuck Ubisoft."
,BluLegion,2012-01-24T17:20Z,"Nevermind, to buy certain weapons you need to do Shop Quests, which you don't need to log on for.
