Halloween 6: The Producer's Cut

Okay to start, this version is way better than the one that was released in theaters. This producers cut in my opinion has to be one of the best in the series, aside from the first of course. For those of you who don't know much about this cut, it has about 45 mins of unseen footage, like a different beginning and ending. These cuts are kind of hard to come by, but if you talk to the right people or check eBay.com or eBay.co.uk you might find a copy. Anyway, the changes that are in this film make the plot more interesting and keeps you in suspense through most of the scenes. It's interesting on how they explained Michael was so unstoppable. Makes sense I guess.

The Cut Footage

A different rare cut of this film contains a new opening title, a flashback to 1989, and several other interesting cut scenes. This version also shows us that Jamie survived her attack from Michael in the barn and was put into a hospital emergency ward. She is recuperating nicely there when the man in black enters and mercilessly shoots her to death. Another startling cut scene has Loomis shooting the man in black to death. As Loomis checks on the body, the dying man curses the doctor to be Myer's new guardian. Loomis has a breakdown and Michael dons the clothes of the man in black, walks off, and opens the series up to it's next sequel. Fans should see the film the way it was really made - a far better piece of work than the wide-released version.


Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers

Director: Joe Chappelle
Genre: Horror
Publisher: Dimension Films
Released: 1995
MPAA: R
BBFC: 18
Starring: Donald Pleasence, Paul Rudd & Marianne Hagan

It's six years after the events of the last film and Michael (George Wilbur) is back. So too is the mysterious cloaked stranger with steel-tipped boots. As predictable as ever, Michael is still after his niece, Jamie (J. C. Brandy). He reaches his quarry a little late, however. By the time he impales her on a sharp object, Jamie has already given birth to a baby boy. Therefore, since the bloodline continues, Michael's work isn't done. And because the baby is on its way to Haddonfield in the care of someone Michael terrorized during his original night of terror, guess where the killer is headed? And, of course, what kind of party would it be without an appearance by doddering old Doctor Loomis (Donald Pleasance, who died soon after completing this film) http://levi186.tripod.com/
