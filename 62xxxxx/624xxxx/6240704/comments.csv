,f.kruger,2011-03-28T17:05Z,"A7V6 Same rough quality as ALL the others, regular flicker bad image. I advise to wait for better file so as you don't waste a good movie. EvilJobby must have watched it on his Iphone"
,f.kruger,2011-03-28T17:06Z,PS thanks for the up anyways.
,keallineage,2011-03-31T04:35Z,Anybody encoded this one? Bone's copy worked great on PC alone but when encoded (so I can play it on the kid's tv) it lost sound after 22 minutes... encoded and burnt it 3 times... same thing. Can somebody comment if they encoded before I waste more time?
