A batch of great songs designed to keep the heart pumping, and Paul certainly delivers. In keeping with the well documented love of Sci-fi that both Pegg and Frost share, each track has some link to science fiction. It is a more than diverse collection of classics from a range of genres such as Punk (\\\"Another Girl Another Planet\\\" â€“ The Only Ones), Soul (\\\"Just The Two Of Us\\\" â€“ Bill Withers & Grover Washington Jr., \\\"Got To Give It Up\\\" - Marvin Gaye), Rock N\\\' Roll (\\\"Flying Saucers Rock N Roll\\\" - Bill Lee Riley), 70\\\'s Pop / Rock (\\\"Hello It\\\'s Me\\\" - Todd Rundgren, \\\"Dancing In The Moonlight\\\" - King Harvest, \\\"All Over The World\\\" - Elo), Reggae (\\\"I Chase The Devil\\\" â€“ Max Romeo) and the 50\\\'s Sci-Fi inspired \\\"Planet Clare\\\" by B52\\\'s. Even Cantina Band\\\'s \\\"Syd Masters & The Swing Riders\\\" is a rock-a-billy cover of the music playing in the bar on Tatooine in Star Wars: A New Hope â€“ famously Simon Pegg\\\'s favourite film. The collection also features exerts from David Arnold\\\'s original score.
