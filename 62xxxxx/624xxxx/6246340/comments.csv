,ed.boey,2011-03-21T10:41Z,"One thing for sure:

Jesus ain't Christian and JESUS CERTAINLY AIN'T MOSLEM AND HE IS NOT ARAB. Stop wasting your time trying to convince other people about your ""PERFECT RELIGION"" and your ""PERFECT PROPHET"".

Just use your own brain and let others use their own brain to make their own decisions. But one thing for sure, your satanic god will command you to hate and kill others who cannot see any truth about your religion"
,manosteell,2011-06-30T13:50Z,"Opposite of brainwashing (which clearly the media has done a great job of, on you already) Islam challenges one to use his God-given REASON to prove to himself with evidence (not blind faith as in other religions) or because he was born into, that Islam is the true prescription of God to the way of life. In the original Quran from over 1400 yrs ago, which is the only book to never have been changed or tainted = humans are formed from the fusion of semen and sperm, then forming a clot of blood, then muscle on top of bone = 1400+ yrs ago. The mountains are like pegs which keep the earth from shaking = 1400+. The universe is in the perfect mathematical arrangement, all the dimensions, cosmic energy, atomic proportions to sustain life on earth; any slight degree of variance and we would not exist (coincidence? evolution? Don't fool yourself) = 1400+. All these scientific miracles which were only discovered by human advancement and technology in the past 2 centuries, and a reason why most scientists who study the Quran revert back to Islam. Enlighten yourselves; use scholarly resources if you are not too lazy to research, instead of listening to fox news.  Read about the Illuminati and how Satan motivated Charles Darwin's THEORY of evolution and considers preachers of that theory among the highest rank of his misguided followers. You must have really come from apes, with your monkey point of view; because even the devil believes in God, so what does that make you???
There's a reason why it still remains the fastest growing religion in spite of hate mongering; a reason why Muhammad is the world's most popular name; and a reason why the Quran is the most memorized book on the planet, in its unchanged form since the beginning of its inception, as God has promised.  Wake up!!!  May we all find peace"
