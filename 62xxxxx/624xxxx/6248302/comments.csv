is it too much to ask for Nov and Dec too? *blushing* I really appreciate this and hope it wasn't a huge inconvenience."
,linee1,2011-03-17T01:55Z,And I promise to seed it for a while in case anyone else is looking for it. Thank you soooo much!
,linee1,2011-03-17T03:17Z,Oops... I forgot October somehow. I have most of B&B for that year except those last four months. I really like the story with Bill and Katey. Glad to see they're still together now.
