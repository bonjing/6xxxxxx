,rhaoul,2011-03-16T20:52Z,is it a cam version thanks for answer
,imbackagain0101,2011-03-16T21:58Z,this is a TS (cam with line audio)
,cnhgreek,2011-03-19T20:38Z,"I can't believe some of you people, people take a chance, time and effort and TRY to make you misserable bastards lives better and ALL you do is fkn complain. More than half of you folks just DOWNLOAD so cut people some FKN slack MOST are trying more than WE can say about some of you losers!!!!"
,RodBrasil,2011-03-21T03:52Z,"Best copy so far.
A=7
V=7"
,scrappler832,2011-03-22T06:37Z,"Well that's watchable copy if you do right filter settings but keep in mind that after 1h:24min it suddenly pops to a very low res cam and then there's eye cancer everywhere, this ain't no joke.
Also the audio gets dizzy and muzzled up along with this, not to mention the russian audience's heads who appear in the middle of the screen for the entire end sequence.

I'd say it's 6/10 upload but nonetheless better wait for better release to seed lol"
,diesel_a2s,2011-03-23T06:51Z,thanks for the upload
,Preskinn,2011-03-23T18:20Z,People really should just download the sample if they want to know quality... faster that way...
,bmss,2011-03-26T03:53Z,"Good upload safcukoo9 great quality as usual... btw swissjoe, who the fuck let you on this site you cut/paste happy bastard. The person that told you about the ""Bay"" should be kicked in the balls...stop pasting that stupid shit on every torrent... ASSHOLE!!"
,creek75,2011-03-26T09:15Z,"swisjoe is annoying, but he is right about one thing; this is a CAM not a TS. A good CAM I grant you, but still a CAM."
,Mazorca,2011-03-27T01:23Z,"finally the right movie!
Thanks, brah!"
,cristi_74,2011-03-28T19:25Z,"Ce-a mai buna varianta pana acum!

Mersi uploader!!!"
,hrpik,2011-04-01T07:32Z,"A6/V6/M5

Audio is decent for a TS, video is also decent... has a few shadows of theater heads and odd sounds."
