isn't good. Your advise to turn UAC off was good because the Mempatch works now but 
the Key generator gives the wrong activationcode.
I'm sorry because I'm waiting for Revit Architecture 2012. But you can't have it all.
Work on your Keygenerator man."

The keygen work awsome. DonÂ´t know what you did wrong man.

Thanks Chris-Aksel for good work!!"
,hristianaki,2011-04-27T16:14Z,"I seem to have the same problem with the keygen, it's giving a shorter key than required...:("
,drkblz,2011-05-19T10:33Z,"When using the crack, make sure you delete the ""Paste Here"", so that ONLY the activation code is there. The code should be long enough to put 1 character in the last box."

,fupaphil,2011-06-12T22:00Z,"Hey, I'm new to this. When I open the installer it says I need the 64-bit installer, not the 32. How do I solve this? Thanks."
,oatsie,2011-08-19T21:36Z,"I've downloaded the Torrent but can't figure out how to unpak, mount, burn it etc with DAEMON Tools.  All I get is that the files are ""not a supported image"".

Help, please..."

,rikimimi,2012-02-11T03:54Z,"I got through everything and pasted the code into X-force, when I click on MemPatch it asks if I'm admin. I read about having to be admin .. but where do I set this? I'm admin on my comp. 
When I click on ""generate"" it gives me the code but that code doesn't work .You're right that only 1 letter is in in Box 15, but the error message appears that there is something wrong. 
Please help!"
