Crazies are on Crusade, and normal people are just - bystanders or pure, uninterested parasites who haven't dignity not just to click on fucking plus, but to say simple Thanks for coming here everyday and grab/rob us/me blind.

Day by day just 24 people act as they should. Their screen-names are here, saying Thanks and seeding, presumably best to their abilities and other thousands - are - well, you have the idea by now."
