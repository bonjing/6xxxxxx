If you're hearing that, you're doing something wrong. I happen to know VLC works perfectly with FLACs.

As for the torrent, great work. I was pretty stoked to see a FLAC torrent for a youtube artist. Usually, I'd be lucky to find 96kbps."
,kevnah,2011-08-17T23:21Z,can you please redownload these as mp3s instead of FLAC

If you are having trouble with .flac files, its the player you are using. VLC will work, media player classin on windows, pretty much anything on linux. just google it peoples"
