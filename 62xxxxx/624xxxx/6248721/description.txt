This is a revealing look at the formative and yet often overlooked five-year period in which the legendary guitarist developed into his own playing style on the 'chitlin' circuit before moving to Greenwich Village. Before he was famous, by 1966, Jimi Hendrix had performed with Little Richard, Ike and Tina Turner, Sam and Dave, Wilson Puckett, and the Isley Brothers. He'd won the Apollo Theater's famous Amateur Night competition. Blue legends B.B King and Albert King had tutored him. Becoming Jimi Hendrix is about a man who was consumed by his passion for music, practicing day and night, but who endured harsh criticism and frequent rejection by band leaders intolerant of guitar feedback from a shy yet cocky kid trying to steal their spotlight. From 1962 to 1966, hendrix learned to please a crowd, dress like a star, and survive some of showbiz's shadier characters. This is the formative journey of one of the world's greatest guitar players - before fame, before London.
