Two of them is close to acceptable; taking up 8% each of the total dvd size.
Five of them takes up only 4% each of the total dvd size, making them useless in sound surround enviroment.

Adding them up gives the result that this 4,36 GiB sized dvd contains audio at the size of 1,4 GiB. But...the main movie - including audio - is 3,3 GiB, the rest is menys, extras and trailers and so on.

This means that the movie (all the frames consisting the movie) is only 1,9 GiB..!

Horrible! Only good (enjoyable though) for viewing on small screens, like a small computor screen."
