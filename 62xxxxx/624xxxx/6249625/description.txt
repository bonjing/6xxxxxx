Plot

The plot begins where the original left off, with Simon Qing (Lam Wai Kin, an old hand at the genre, having starred in â€œChinese Erotic Ghost Storyâ€ some years back) feeling pretty happy, having added Lotus (AV star Hayakawa Serina) to his collection of concubines after murdering her husband Wu Da Lang (Ng Chi Hung). Needless to say, the sex obsessed man is soon lusting after a new challenge in the form of Pinky (AV star Uehara Kaera), who reminds him of the woman he lost his virginity to. Since she is married to one of his friends, this sets in motion a whole new series of wicked schemes as he tries to make her his. Matters are complicated when Wu Da Langâ€™s brother Wu Song (Wu Qing Zhe) returns for revenge, reminding Lotus of a passionate encounter from the past. Trying to keep one step ahead of Wu Song and his increasingly unhappy wives, Simon enlists the help of family maid Plum (Winnie Leung, who previously starred in a number of horror films, including â€œDeadly Campâ€, â€œDial D for Demonsâ€ and â€œNew Bloodâ€), though it seems that even he may not be able to worm his way out of trouble this time.
