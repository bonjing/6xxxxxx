Overlooked masterpiece from the great Dario Argento is simply one of his best films of the 80's and arguably his most bizarre work!

Young girl, who has a psychic bond with insects, must use her powers to try to stop the mad killer that's terrorizing a Swiss boarding school.

Director Argento has often proclaimed this to be his personal favorite of his films and it's not hard to see why. Story-wise Phenomena combines all of the elements of Argento's other films; a crazed serial killer, a touch of the supernatural, a detective-mystery, and a sense of being like a fairy tale. It's a story that draws one in, from the startling opening murder sequence to the horrific climatic twists! The plot is completely off-beat, giving the audience no idea of what to expect at any moment. As always, Argento's direction has a splendidly flashy style and gives the whole film a unique, strange atmosphere. Lending all the more to the weird atmosphere is the glorious music of Goblin, who provides some of their finest work here. In addition Iron Maiden also serves up a great metal-rock number. The special FX are quite impressive, especially the shockingly good makeup work - just wait for the finale!

The cast is also pretty good, and thankfully the dubbing isn't as bad for this film as it is for some Italian movies. Young Jennifer Connelly (only 15 here) does an enchanting performance. The late-great Donald Pleasance is good as always as Connelly's befriended scientist. Daria Nicolodi does a terrific turn as Connelly's teacher.


This is the Italian cut of the movie. Some scenes don't exist with English audio
so it switches to the Italian audio.
