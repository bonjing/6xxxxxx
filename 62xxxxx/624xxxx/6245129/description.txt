 PLOT:
 In Minangkabau, West Sumatera, Yuda a skilled practitioner of 
 Silat Harimau is in the final preparations to begin his "Merantau" 
 a century's old rites-of-passage to be carried out by the 
 community's young men that will see him leave the comforts of his 
 idyllic farming village and make a name for himself in the bustling 
 city of Jakarta. After a series of setbacks leave Yuda homeless 
 and uncertain about his new future, a chance encounter results in 
 him defending the orphaned Astri from becoming the latest victim 
 of a European human trafficking ring led by the wildly psychotic, 
 Ratger and his right-hand man Lars. With Ratger injured in the melee 
 and seeking both his "merchandise" and bloody retribution, Yuda's 
 introduction to this bustling city is a baptism of fire as he is 
 forced to go on the run with Astri and her younger brother Adit as 
 all the pimps and gangsters that inhabit the night hound the streets 
 chasing their every step...
