From Wiki:


Social Distortion (sometimes referred to simply as Social D or SxDx) is an American punk rock band formed in 1978 in Fullerton, California.[4] The band currently consists of Mike Ness (vocals, guitars), Jonny Wickersham (guitars), Brent Harding (bass) and David Hidalgo, Jr. (drums).

Social Distortion temporarily disbanded in 1985, due to frontman Ness' drug addiction and troubles with the law, which resulted in extended stints in various rehabilitation centers, that lasted for two years. However, the band reformed around 1986 and have continued being active today, even after the death of longtime guitarist Dennis Danell, who succumbed to a brain aneurysm in 2000. Since its inception the band lineup has been a virtual revolving-door of talent, with many members coming and going â€“ Ness has been the only constant member.

To date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two compilations, one live album and two DVDs. The band released its debut album Mommy's Little Monster in 1983, which was quite popular in the United States. Social Distortion did not release a second album, Prison Bound, until 1988. That album attracted the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band in 1989 and issued their highly successful self-titled third album a year later, which peaked at number 128 on the Billboard 200, and featured their well-known hit singles "Ball and Chain", "Story of My Life" and the cover of Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire." The next three albums, Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell, White Light, White Heat, White Trash and Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll were also well-received but not as successful as the self-titled album. Social Distortion released their most recent studio album, Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes, on January 18, 2011, which was the fourth anniversary of the death of former Social Distortion bassist Brent Liles. The band also released their first Greatest Hits compilation on June 26, 2007.








Mommy's Little Monster 1983


Mommy's Little Monster is the first album by American punk rock band Social Distortion, released in 1983 (though the CD erroneously notes 1982).[2]

The album was critically-acclaimed but was, however, not commercially successful. The album includes their live staples "The Creeps", "Another State of Mind", "Telling Them" and the title track, which has been frequently played by KROQ.

In 1982, Social Distortion took part in the tour with Youth Brigade (as chronicled in the documentary Another State of Mind) and broke up shortly afterwards. However, because of the tour's success, the band reconciled not long afterward and decided to begin work on their first album. They recorded the album in a single session. Mommy's Little Monster was recorded at The Casbah in Fullerton, California, on December 24, 1982, for numerous hours to cut down studio costs, which explains low budget production.

The exposure afforded to Social Distortion from the tour and subsequent documentary led to Mommy's Little Monster being a surprise hit despite being self-released. However, the album went out of print in the mid-1980s after leader Mike Ness started to take the checks that were coming in to 13th Floor Records and which were meant to be put towards future pressings of the album or new releases, and used them to subsidize his drug habit.

Mommy's Little Monster was reissued several times, with different formats and labels. The album was originally released on vinyl LP in 1983 on 13th Floor Records, a label owned by their manager at the time, Monk Rock.

The Triple X Records label reissued the album on vinyl and cassette in 1989. Six years later, Mommy's Little Monster was re-issued once again when Ness started Time Bomb Recordings with some of the profits he made from Social Distortion's Epic releases, and reissued Mommy's Little Monster on vinyl, cassette and CD through a distribution deal with Arista Records. The 1995 version has remained in print ever since.

To date[when?], the 13th Floor and Triple X versions remain out of print.

A gramophone picture disc version of Mommy's Little Monster was released in 2001, but it is also rare

The cover of the album has an image of a skeleton and human child (wearing a mask), who are seated in a chair watching a war movie featuring a mushroom cloud in a somewhat abandoned house, with nothing except for the chair, television, mailbox, three lead pipes and a lot of debris. It is suggestive of the after effects of an early hydrogen bomb test and an archetypal hardcore image. The album cover was designed by Art Morales.

Prison Bound 1988


Prison Bound is the second studio album by Social Distortion, was released in 1988. This is the first album with bass guitarist John Maurer and drummer Christopher Reece. It expands upon the punk sound of the band's highly regarded but commercially unsuccessful first album Mommy's Little Monster (1983) by adding elements of Johnny Cash style country and The Rolling Stones style rock and roll.

Today, Prison Bound is looked upon as a turning point for Social Distortion, paving the way for the commercial success they achieved on their next album, Social Distortion, which was released two years later.

After this album was released, Social Distortion left Restless / Enigma Records in 1989 and moved to Epic Records for their self-titled album.

The first track, "It's the Law", was originally titled "Justice for All", which has the same lyrics. "Justice for All" later appeared on the 1995 compilation album Mainliner: Wreckage from the Past. The fifth track, "Prison Bound", was only released as a single on KROQ-FM. The album contains a cover version of "Backstreet Girl" originally recorded by the Rolling Stones. The album's title track contains a reference to Johnny Cash's "I Walk the Line". The band went on to cover Cash's "Ring of Fire" on their next album.

Social Distortion 1990


Social Distortion is the third and self-titled album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on March 27, 1990, through Epic Records. After touring in support of its previous full-length studio album, Prison Bound (1988), Social Distortion signed with Epic in 1989 and began work on its first album for a major label. The album furthered the rockabilly, blues and country music experimentation of their previous album with songs like "Drug Train" and the radio hit "Ball and Chain".

The focus on the alternative rock scene helped bring attention to Social Distortion. The singles "Story of My Life" and "Ball and Chain" were able to find an audience on alternative rock radio and on MTV. Social Distortion was the band's most successful album to date, and their first to enter the Billboard 200; the release peaked at number 128. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.

"Story of My Life" is a playable song in the videogame Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. "Story of My Life" and "Ring of Fire" were later released as downloadable content for the Rock Band.

Somewhere Between Heaven & Hell 1992


Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell is the fourth studio album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on February 11, 1992. It continues the melding of country and rockabilly influences with punk that began two albums before with Prison Bound. Clear influences include Hank Williams (on "This Time Darlin'") and Johnny Cash (on "99 To Life"). The album also marks the first time that a Social Distortion line-up had not changed in three consecutive studio recordings.

This was the last Social Distortion album with drummer Christopher Reece, who was replaced in 1993 by Randy Carr.

White Light, White Heat, White Trash 1996


White Light, White Heat, White Trash is the fifth album by American punk rock band, Social Distortion, released on September 17, 1996, by Epic Records. The album was produced by Michael Beinhorn. White Light, White Heat, White Trash is the last Social Distortion album to feature guitarist Dennis Danell who died on February 29, 2000, of a cerebral aneurysm at the age of 38[1]. It is also the band's last release on Epic Records. The album received Social Distortion's highest ever chart position, entering the Billboard 200 album chart at #27. Stylistically, the album is harder and considered a return to their punk roots.

The title of the album is a play on the 1968 Velvet Underground album, White Light/White Heat. The Velvet Underground record is known for being one of the most original, and probably the heaviest, records of the time[citation needed], just as White Light, White Heat, White Trash for Social Distortion has a harder sound than those albums preceding it.

Sex Love and Rock 'n' Roll 2004


Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll is the sixth album by American punk rock band Social Distortion. It is their first studio album in eight years, since the release of White Light, White Heat, White Trash in 1996, the longest gap between Social Distortion's studio albums to date. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the fall of 2000, but was not yet completed, and it was officially released on September 28, 2004. A great deal of the album is a musical eulogy to former guitarist Dennis Danell, who died in 2000. The album's opening track, "Reach for the Sky", was released in late 2004 and became one of Social Distortion's biggest hits.

Social Distortion could not release a follow-up to White Light, White Heat, White Trash partly because of their various other activities, most obviously those of frontman Mike Ness. He released two solo albums in 1999, one with original material (Cheating at Solitaire) and one with song covers (Under the Influences). Due to his touring schedule with the band, Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll was set aside for a number of years before finally being completed in 2004.

The song "Nickels and Dimes" is a play on hardcore punk band Minutemen masterpiece album "Double Nickels on the Dime".

Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes 2011


Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes is the seventh studio album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on January 18, 2011.[10] It is the band's first album recorded with bassist Brent Harding, their first album of new material since 2004's Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll, and their first release on Epitaph Records. Work on the album began in 2006 and it was originally forecast for a 2007 release, but was pushed back several times while the band continued touring and writing new material. After four years of writing, Social Distortion recorded the album from February to July 2010 at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California. Drummer Atom Willard left the group during the recording sessions in favor of his other band, Angels & Airwaves. He was temporarily replaced by Scott Reeder before David Hidalgo, Jr. joined as the band's new permanent drummer. Despite being listed as a band member on the album, Hidalgo did not actually play on it; instead, the band hired session musician Josh Freese to record the drum tracks. Social Distortion is currently touring in support of Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes.
