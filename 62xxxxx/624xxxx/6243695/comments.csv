@Starscream79
Must have been the same bastards who cancelled Firefly after 13 episodes. They have no knowledge of what represents good SciFi. Syfy sucks."
,madanchi,2011-03-15T20:55Z,"its cos the ideots dont realise that sci-fi shows dont get the mass amount of views like the mainstream shows get, fucking ideots"

,321Ignition,2011-03-15T21:37Z,"Its because the networks rely on Nielsen (who admit the surveying is flawed) which only polls about 25,000 households, which in turn are supposed to represent the millions upon millions of tv viewers.  We can thank those 25,000 (who, as a reward for hosting the Nielsen box, get a check or other rewards every once in a while for participating) for our 2-hour American Idol and [whatever] Dance and all of the other crappy reality shows that take the place of better programming."
,Neo_aeoN,2011-03-16T07:36Z,"Never been accused of having good tastes but as far as a scifi/drama blend, this is the bees pyjamas. Whoever cut Se03 needs a hyper-wedgie. VTV rox."
,Shaktipat,2011-03-17T14:43Z,"Thx :)
I keep watching this, because I miss Stargate SG1 and Atlantis; but unfortionatly this series has removed almost everything that was good in the Stargate realm. -They`ve made it into a soap-opera based more on intrigues and hostility, hardly any alien or new world encounters, and none of the episodes are stand-alone. They could have made it work eventually, with more exploring and such... but what kills it the most is the hostile environment between the crew on the ship, and the lack of humour.  -What made them think that replacing humour with hostility would be a good idea? They should have known that most stargate fans would react as they have; being very dissapointed in general. And with this mistake, and this series being taken of at the end of the season; they`ve probably killed the Stargate realm for good... that`s very very very sad... Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis was two fantastic shows; Atlantis was the best ever made, in my eyes. "
,Purple_Spy,2011-03-17T22:07Z,"Have to agree with Shaktipat here. I really loved the style of SG1 and atlantis. Granted, SGU is by no means bad and did not deserve to be cancelled, but it is certainly not what i expected from a stargate series, nor is it what i wanted. While it is a good show, its by far my least favorite of the stargate series."
,Sirez,2011-03-21T11:19Z,"I agree with most of you and HAD to comment becuase of some of the longer comments already on here...being an AVID!!! Stargate freak of nature and having watched every single Stargate episode known to man...yes even SGI (Stargate Inifinity) which was by far the worst...props for trying to appeal to the kids too though but it didnt fly so well with most of the adults lol...I would have to say SGU definantly takes some getting used to...didnt start liking it untill about the 5th epsiode...Light I believe...but you've got to hand it to writers for the awsome character dynamic that eventually started to unfold...how the hell would you NOT expect some hostility between a few dozen people trapped on a space ship with limited supplies 38 some odd galaxies (yes I attemted to count) away from earth with no promise to ever return home? seriously?...anyhow...the main reason rather upset with this is because I dont get to chill with a friend once a week to kick back, watch some Stargate, and drink some beer...also becuase its just going to be the end of Stargate with no promise of ""Extinction"" finishing off Atlantis...it's still just chillin in SF bay in my oppinion...what about tha Wraith! Earth is still in DANGER!!!...anyhow...im going to get to downloading this AWSOME! episode considering I watched it on frikin 'SyFy' and definantly intend on buying in the future....and continue to watch the rest of Continuuem ^_^, thanks for the up VTV"
,zapphb,2011-03-22T21:05Z,Brilliant!
,Josh8491,2011-03-27T00:39Z,"Thanks VTV . . You guys are always reliable.

and it does suck that they've canceled the show but in there defense the show took a whole season to kick off, and its so far from the original stargate fan base that it might as well be something else. its just too different for all the older SG fans to relate to it."
,Dhatz,2011-08-10T17:07Z,"don't forget there is Transformers Prime being aired, don't let em cancell it."
