Bowser and Blue are a musical comedy duo from MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec. They've been working together since 1978 and have released more than fifteen albums. They've also starred in several television specials and several more theatre shows. Check out their videos on youtube.

If you like this album, please buy a copy. They self-publish their work and anything you spend actually goes to them, not a multinational record company. Their website is www.bowserandblue.com (easy to remember) and you can purchase their albums and DVDs there; if something is currently out of print, they're willing to burn a copy for you.

Bowser & Blue at the Comedy Nest was recorded live on 22 December 1994 at the Montreal Comedy Nest. It was released on their private label, You Guys Publishing (now at 352 Lansdowne Avenue, Westmount, QuÃ©bec, H3Z 2L4). It's an excellent introduction to their music.
