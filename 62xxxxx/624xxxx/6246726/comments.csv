,hmrdsdsa,2011-03-18T02:11Z,"@ srawrats, duh you bleeping idiot. the roast just aired on comedy central. they won't have an uncensored version until the dvd comes out."
,america69,2011-03-18T15:00Z,"You should've known it would be the censored version. Comedy Central will likely air the uncensored version on a Saturday night sometime in the next few weeks, like they do with every other roast they've had..."
,GregyPooh,2011-03-25T02:37Z,the situation= EPIC FAIL
,Sharak23,2011-04-16T06:14Z,they aired this last night at 3am uncensored. Why are the torrents censored
