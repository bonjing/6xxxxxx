My upload of AIC, its mostly complete, only missing the "We Die Young EP". There are several torrents out there claiming to be it, but they really just take the tracks from music bank, and tag it as the EP.

As always, my discogs have 100% complete/accurate ID3 500x500 album art.

*Note 1: I actually only included the 1 exclusive track on this release, the rest 
         appear in the box set, and I don't need to fill my drive with duplicate 
         content.

**Note 2: The Club/Jungle remixes are the same. The Jungle & Trip Hop mix do not 
          have very good sound quality, it was the best I could find, but in my 
          opinion, they aren't very god anyway.

As always, please help me seed, and ENJOY.
