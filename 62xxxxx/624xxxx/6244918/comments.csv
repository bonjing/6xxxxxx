The download was very fast and, although I haven't watched the whole thing yet, it does include the end credits (at the end of course).  I'm not qualified to audio and video a rating, but the few seconds I looked at looked and sounded fine.  Thanks."

A great DL & a great video! I wish all DL were as easy & trouble free. I will be watching out for cad40 for further DL's. Thanks cad40 & keep up the good work. "
