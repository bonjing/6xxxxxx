,vivek36929,2011-03-15T16:03Z,"yify, i logged in to tpb just to say u don't need to upload narnia trilogy...twentyforty has uploaded it already.
i respect ur and other uploaders' hard work...it's just sad how some selfish downloaders request the same movie to every uploader...  lots of hard work is geting wasted on same movie"
,vivek36929,2011-03-15T16:04Z,"forgot to say....u r currently the best uploader on tpb
thanks for everything"

,raj888,2011-03-15T16:24Z,"yify we cant say anything about ur uploads, u keep us updated all the recent movies thaks man,u do very rare work"
,dkhere,2011-03-15T16:34Z,"Big thanks dude...
After narnia please upload The Mechanic and green hornet.."
,UAofE,2011-03-15T17:28Z,"What the fuck is ""Traverls""?"
,munna_m,2011-03-15T17:38Z,"@vivek36929
may be u have good band width.but what about the others who dont have. ofcourse twentyforty has done narnia but it is above 1gb.we love yify's torrents for not only having high quality, but also low size. i've been waiting for narnia since many days to download from yify because he promised to upload it. plz understand"
,munna_m,2011-03-15T17:46Z,"@vivek36929
also one more thing to tell, 20-40 had done narnia trilogy at 352p only, but yify is going to do it in 720p.20-40 had done narnia 3 but it is above 1gb"
,sgourab,2011-03-15T17:57Z,thanx for keeping both my requests.....:D (^_^)
,star.00.7,2011-03-15T18:01Z,"@UAofe,

there has been some spelling mistake 
dont consider that!! off course its a 
human error,YIFY has done his best till
now.
be HAPPY with the movie,dont u worry about
the spellings..."
,dkhere,2011-03-16T03:32Z,"@vivek36929: twentyforty uploads movie in .mp4 format and that one is a stupid format which gives high clarity but large size...
Whereas YIFY's upload is in .mkv format and that one produces high clarity with low size...
I have only limited free bandwidth for 8 hours a day..."
,dkhere,2011-03-16T03:34Z,@UAofE: Man!! You really don't know what that is??? Well then go for any other uploader who has the correct name..
