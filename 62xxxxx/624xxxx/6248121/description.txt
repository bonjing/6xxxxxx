Le Party of the title is an event held in a men's prison periodically, featuring outside entertainers. Many of the prison staff and their families (and most of the prisoners) attend, and feelings run high. In this film, various female outsiders meet, have encounters with, and occasionally run afoul of the male prisoners. In addition to these main stories, several others include the efforts of a prisoner to escape through dressing up in drag and impersonating the female guest of a prison official, and the suicide plans of a man prevented from attending. This gritty drama is based on the prison recollections of scriptwriting consultant Francis Smiardi).
