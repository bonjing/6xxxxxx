When gods go to war! A new epic ongoing exploring Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. The 1928 publication of The Call of Cthulhu established one of the most feared characters in the history of horror fiction: a terrible alien god capable of worldwide destruction. But Cthulhu was actually only one of the minor gods in Lovecraft's pantheon - there are things far bigger, badder, and meaner roaming the cosmos, ready to come to call.
