BUDDY GUY HOLD THAT PLANE
Label Vanguard - VNP 5315 (UK) LP
Original Year 1972
Format:Flac


Buddy Guy is at his best with slow blues, which is what comprises most of this album. The title cut is right up there with songs like "One Room Country Shack" and "A Man and His Blues". In addition to composing a more jazzed up version of "My Time After Awhile" Guy also manages to put a unique and enjoyable spin on the Muddy Waters classic "I'm Ready". Another standout is "You Don't Love Me" a smooth soul-blues cut reminiscent of the Chess years.
