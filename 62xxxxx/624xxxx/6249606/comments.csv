Let's change that
I love this band and couldn't find a torrent so tried it since I trust hoch88 and it works great some what slow download thou because not many Seeds yet but I'll seed it for a while and when I say some what slow like an hour or 2 so not to bad 
Just put it on Alcohol 52% or any other free Virtual Drive programs then use iTunes or another program to rip em off the CD that's what I did and it works perfect 
Thanks for the UpLoad "
