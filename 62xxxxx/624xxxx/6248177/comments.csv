,JkCleary,2011-03-16T21:39Z,does this fully work on prometheus 4? i've tried a couple others but they freeze on the first mission.
,Asgfsda,2011-03-17T02:38Z,"Try backing up, deleting, then replacing your various plugin folders.
I had bare my root folder then replace them all with backups.
It might not be necessary but It worked for me.
I was freezing on attack till I did It.
It works fine on Prome 4."

,marshmello1230,2011-03-21T11:19Z,i'm using 5.50 prom 4 and it freezes in the first mission.
,mjnovak,2011-03-22T18:08Z,"This .iso works great for me, no errors or freezing. I am using m33-6 and prome-4 plugin.

I made some codes for CWcheat that work with this iso and since there seem to be a lot of codes floating around that work with various iso I thought that I would just post these ones here for those who download this one. 

The codes I made are to multiply items in the inventory to 99. I made one for each item slot in the inventory so you don't have to deposit and withdraw items from the storage if you don't want to.

,redhatGizmo,2011-04-08T22:22Z,"To Fix the Freezing issue 

1.Dowload the patch from here -- bit ly/ehgtrT   --and extract it.

2.Run WQSG UMD and open the iso 

3.Go to PSPGAME\SYSDIR

4.Now Drag N Drop all files from ""M631"" Folder To PSPGAME\SYSDIR

5.thats It Close WQSG UMD and Copy Iso to psp. 

Tested & Working on 5.00 M33.
