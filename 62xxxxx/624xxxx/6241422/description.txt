The Who - Join Together [promo] (PCM+AC3).VOB


HQ very rare promo music video with untouched LPCM & AC3 6ch audio from the promo DVD. "Join Together" is a song by British rock band The Who. It was released as a single in 1972, and was one of three non-album singles relating to the aborted Lifehouse project, along with "Let's See Action" and "Relay". It reached number 9 on the British singles chart and number 17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It was included on several compilations, including The Who: The Ultimate Collection and 20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: The Best of The Who.

The song was first performed live on The Who's By Numbers Tour from 1975-1976, albeit more bluesy and abbreviated while attached to "My Generation"; it was played in this same arrangement early in the 1979 tour. It was performed once on the 1982 tour as well, tagged on to the end of "Magic Bus". For the 1989 tour, it was brought back, this time in the same arrangement as the studio version. On January 13, 2011, the band played this song with guests Debbie Harry, Jeff Beck and Bryan Adams as the show-closer for the Concert for Killing Cancer benefit show.

Lifehouse was a science fiction rock opera by The Who intended as a follow-up to Tommy. It was abandoned as a rock opera in favour of creating the traditional rock album, Who's Next, though its songs would appear on various albums and singles by The Who, as well as Pete Townshend solo albums. In 1978, the Lifehouse project was revisited by The Who including new science fiction related songs by John Entwistle with a slightly changed plot on Who Are You. In 2000, Townshend revived the Lifehouse concept with his set The Lifehouse Chronicles and the sampler Lifehouse Elements. On 1 May 2007, Townshend released an online software called The Lifehouse Method in which any "sitter" could create a musical "portrait."
