,aemalkawi,2011-04-02T16:46Z,"is that what you hear from other enemies of islam, who said women have to submit to men AT EVERYTHING, they only have to respect their husband and obey them ONLY in what is right, MEN TOO HAVE TO RESPOND THE SAME, this is how islam try to keep the relation between couples good to save their children from being missing of one of his parents,,,,,,,,

and about the TENT, this never been asked by islam!!!!!!!!!!! these are an old arabic traditions and never represents islam, and for your knowledge I bit you heard about hajj,, do you know that it is not allowed to put a tent while doing it,,,,   ISLAM ONLY ASK WOMEN TO WEAR SOMETHING THAT COVERS HER ATTRACTIVE TO MEN IN STREET AND THIS IS TO PROTECT HERE FROM BEING RAPED OR FALL TO SOMEONES LIES AND LOSS HER DIGNITY BY DOING ILLEGAL SEX

about Muhammed _peace upon him_ marrying little girl (not girls),, actually at south regions in asia and africa women become adult earlier than
north because of hot weather there, and at that times where there were no schools or universities it was normal to marry small adults even between non muslims (eg. christians) so stop talking about what you don't know

best regards all, hope God guide you the right way

,aemalkawi,2011-04-02T16:48Z,"about womens education, it is actually not only allowed in islam but it also is encouraged to.
In quran there are many sections talking about how education is important without specifying men or women,   and if you have any enlightenment you will find that in universities of arab muslim countries there are much more women than men. and even in europe countries there are many muslim girls who attend universities, As a proof: remember the problems that occured when govements try to prohibit hijab in universities, that means that there are muslim women that attend universities 

so what ever anybody here or other places try to show the islam is camel drivers just imagine that by what I seen here I have understand that you are the blind people that has no sight of looking, you are only being treated as blockheads by your goverments that try to show you islam as a monster, and they know you will never seek the truth , you will just follow what you here

i'm not against anyone here, sorry if anyone got me wrong but I'm trying to show the truth 

look at september 11,  who you think did it, of causre your government show you as if islam did it to announce their war on terrorism, but despite the fact that al qaeda can't be considered muslims I can't imagine that those who live in caves can do such a huge attack in such a great country please have open minds and think

best regards all, hope God guide you the right way
