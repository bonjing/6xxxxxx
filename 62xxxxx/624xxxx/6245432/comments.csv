There is a working installer! Stop posting bullshit and first do some research."
,shauwy,2011-03-15T21:44Z,"the game can be installed with ""homefront installer"" or ""phoenix 1.5 beta"" the game is installed over the crack to wait and not be looking a bit stupid.
@ SMILEHAPPY not say fake because it was you who posted that fake death vĂÂŠrolers bullet hole
see all the post and comment of DibyaTPB and yours!!!"

,Guillo_89,2011-03-17T21:22Z,"Ok, I'm having a problem.

After I unpacked with phoenix (1.5 beta3), I downloaded the steam fix unlock but I can't install this fix. Whenever I try to unpack the content to any folder an error comes up. It either says ""ERROR: archive data corrupted (decompression fails)"" (or something just like that), or it says ""CRC check failed"". Whatever the message, the thing is that I can't unpack the content, therefore I can't update the damn game. 

I've tried to google it but no one seems to be having this problem. If anyone gives me a solution, I would be extremely grateful..."

A personal note -

This game is terrible, you play as the American resistance, yet you don't feel like a resistance, you have amazing technology that the Koreans find hard to destroy, and the whole look, feel and presentation of the game is Call of Duty like.

I'd recommend not bothering downloading this game, though I understand if you want to despite what I've said, I was told the exact same thing yet downloaded it anyway.

I can only imagine the Multiplayer is an exact copy of Call of Duty too.

I hope this helps."
,Dyrdal,2011-03-20T23:25Z,"I followed your instructions, but it doesn't install, this error message appears: ""The program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."""
,ijiboom,2011-03-20T23:37Z,Just download the dll file and add it in the folder where the installer is... I did it and it worked
,The77s,2011-03-21T11:04Z,"If you're getting ""The program can't start because MSVCR100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."", then follow these instructions -

You're a f*cking retard, GTFO and take your massive, untold amount of fail with you.


@iambobby

Same thing happened to me, it installed to - C:\Program

Try their, even though I told the Installer to install else where, it didn't.

So check C:\Program, all my Files were installed to there."
