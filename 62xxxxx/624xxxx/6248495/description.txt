Right of Rebellion - Brainless Britain EP



Right of Rebellion are a three piece band from the shit town of Dunstable. They're climbing out the rancid marshland and trying to make a name for themselves. Over the coming months you can catch them on the underground circuits in the UK.


Right of Rebellion are against:
Racism 
Homophobia
Sexism
Capitalism
Nazi Punks/Skins


The recordings are raw as fuck.


"Old skool Punk! Vocals delivered with true grit this three piece could well find themselves with a cult following fast! Taking influence from GBH right through to NOFX Right of Rebellion will not be uncertain about what they want to say!" - Majick Music Group
