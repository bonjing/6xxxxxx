There are two ISO images from a two-disc set (Encyclopedia Britannica 2003 Deluxe Edition): Disc One and Disc Two. There is no physical damage to either of the compact discs. I am unable to test this, however, because of hardware limitations.

Here are the system requirements exactly as they appear on the outside of the compact disc:

System Requirements:
Microsoft Windows 98/2000/ME/XP/NT
Macintosh OS 10.1 or higher
Pentium 266 MHz, 350MHz recommended
iMac or Mac G3 350MHz or faster
128 MB of RAM/256MB recommended
400 MB hard disc space available
CD-ROM drive 800x600 resolution/16-bit color/millions of colors
Mouse, printer, speakers and internet connection recommended




Here is the serial number: C3BA1AFA00000017
