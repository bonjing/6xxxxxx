When can we expect season 3 ?"
,toomin25,2011-03-19T16:59Z,"@gajko: I'll upload the other seasons as soon as I have enough seeders on the current seasons. I.e. As soon as I have enough seeders for season 2, I can then stop seeding it myself and start seeding 3. As soon as I have enough seeders for season 3... and so on. "
