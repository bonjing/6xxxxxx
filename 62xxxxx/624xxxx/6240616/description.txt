And here you go, the next The Complete Torpedo album.


If you dont know Torpedo, shame on you. It is one of the best european comics around, and THE best gangster comic ever made.
Finally IDW have released it, in a nice hardcover deluxe album, which you SHOULD run out and buy or order from Amazon, after you have seen this scan. This comic deserve no less.

If you have to read 3 european (non-scanlated) comics this year, I would suggest Torpedo, Largo Winch, and Spirou and Fantasio, thats how good this is :).


Torpedo follows the story of a gangster whose life is traced from the innocence of childhood to amoral adulthood, and nearly every stop explored along the way. Abulis distinctive narrative builds the story over time and Jordi Bernets masterful renditions of the title character are stunningly cinematic. Torpedo is the Godfather of comics, in both subject matter and execution.
