Money makes the world's economies function. But money is the most misunderstood subject on earth. Bankers and economists spend millions of dollars in an effort to PREVENT people from learning what money is and understanding its uses and misuses. After all, money is power. And those who have the money have the power. And having both money and power means KEEPING that money and that power for yourself and preventing anyone else from also obtaining that money and that power.
Whether you are the leader of a country or the leader of your own small family, knowing WHAT money is means that you can understand HOW and WHY the International Bankers have become such dangerous swindlers and thieves.
