The Current Crisis in the Middle East
St David's Hall, Cardiff
2011.03.12

===========

As an unapologetic critic of both American foreign policy and the neoliberal turn of global capitalism - which he identifies in terms of class warfare waged from above against the needs and interests of the majority - Chomsky offers a searing critical indictment of US foreign policy and its many interventions across the globe, pointing out that continued support for undemocratic regimes, and hostility to popular or democratic movements, is at odds with claims to be spreading democracy and freedom.
