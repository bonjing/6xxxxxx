who said women are raped in islam!!!!!! what???have'nt you heard the punishment of illegal sex in islam,,,,,,,  when anyone want to talk about islam violence they talk about the punishment of theift, illegal sex, killing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

then when you want to talk about having no rights in islam you say that it allow raping or killing???????? 

the only meaning of this that you only fight islam without knowing anything about it

 about women, it is your communities that give them no right, but that depends on your meaning of rights, because if women rights means that they can be fucked anywhere and that can disobey their parents, and can wear anything that attract most guys in street then let me say we don't want these rights becasue these are insults for her, and our women consider them so, we don't force the women here to wear good covering clothing ,they do this because they know the right and wrong and they are ashamed of wearing short dresses like your women, our women wear those clothes to protect their dignity,,,,,,,,,,

and women in islam are respected much more than your communities, they are treated on the basis that they are more soft and need care, they get pregnant and can't have a hard work that affect her health negatively, indeed women are not prohibited from any job unless it affect her dignity badly

every women right were preserved and protected by islam fore more than 1400 years and you don't have to tell us how treat women, we know better, but

all what you need is to get more open and know what is real islam, not only sitting and watching TV and judging on what islam's enemy want you to see
