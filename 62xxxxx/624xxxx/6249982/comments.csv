Also it'd be nice to have English forced subs too, as most English speakers don't want English subtitles for the English-speaking parts."

Disagree with you jonny about forced subs. A separate srt for non-English speaking parts is far better."
[V],-jonny-,2011-03-19T13:51Z,"No. Forced subs are more useful than complete subs. Subs should always be separate, and in MKVs they nearly always are."
[V],-jonny-,2011-03-19T13:52Z,"Oh, it seems you don't understand what ""forced"" subs are."
,Hillwalker,2011-03-20T13:11Z,Unnecessary snide comment jonny. I wasn't attacking you.
[V],-jonny-,2011-03-25T12:56Z,Nothing snide about it. A mere observation.
,Hillwalker,2011-03-27T23:31Z,"Your observation is incorrect, and my point still stands: separate passive text files are a better idea, as they can be switched on or off at will. If people wish to force them they can always remux."
