The problem with this 'theory' is that this version of history is very difficult to prove because those secret societies that advance history according to their 'vision' are covering their tracks and are in the position to be able to write history. Just like Napoleon said: history is written by the victors.

To the example: you do not need a ""predilection to metaphysics"" to see the parallels. And it is not just the book of Enoch. It is also mentioned in the Bible book of Genesis (ch 6). And Egyptian mythology, and Sumerian, and Indian, and Chinese, and Aztec etc etc. 
It isn't important that you believe it. The Luciferians (freemasons, Rosicrucians etc) believe it and act accordingly! 

Since they are in the seats of power it is good to be informed about them."
