,Andymac54,2012-03-06T10:52Z,"so im D/L now, and its a pretty quick download with 35 SE....  but just curious...do these two need mounted to a virtual drive, or is the no cd crack included... it was just sketchy to me a torrent can have 35 seeders and not a single negative comment"
,jeff35,2012-04-08T15:34Z,downloads really fast for the amount of seeders. Great game... i have loved the oddworld games since i was 5
,jeff35,2012-04-08T15:37Z,Holy balls..... i just peaked at 2mbps....... omg these are some good quality seeders
,undeadsecret,2012-04-20T15:03Z,signed in just to comment. this is garbage. the first Abe's Oddesy.. crashes my windows. i wouldn't risk getting it.
