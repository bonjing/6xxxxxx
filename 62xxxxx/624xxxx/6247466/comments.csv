,ankit280,2011-03-17T11:32Z,"@ticten
your rips are great and although its entirely your choice which movies to do.. but please don't do Ben Hur and Season of the Witch.. they have been just uploaded by Yify.. any1 wanting tem movies can download it from him
http://thepiratebay.org/user/yify"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-17T12:20Z,"I agree, coz Avatar is a movie you must see in 720p at least, That's why I delayed and I'm not at all happy with this quality too. 
I can do Season Of The Witch @ 480p under 300MB, if no one wants it, I can skip it, no problem :)"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-17T12:24Z,"I can do Ben Hur in better resolution, I'm not claiming anything, but I can make it better though ( I admire yify ).
Also trying to do some nice Arabic movies, I wish I had an unlimited internet connection :( :( :( :( :( "
,banukaknight,2011-03-17T12:52Z,"Season of the Witch
95minute long.
in 500mb.. are you kidding me??? 
i have a internet connection with average download speed of 40kbps.
in that case.. gonna take at least 4 straight hours to download the rip by YIFI...
idk boy.....
do what you think is right.
"

,Erich505,2011-04-28T05:26Z,Skips and freezes all over the place. Unfortunately it happens during the best scenes in the movie. All of you should watch the entire film before commenting. This is crap all day.

My home theatre cannot play .mkv 5.1 and you're the only one uploading hi-res, low size, non-mkv movies.
Reply!!"
