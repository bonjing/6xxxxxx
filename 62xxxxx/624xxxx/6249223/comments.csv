,shmeghead,2011-03-18T01:50Z,"NO IT IS NOT A REHASH!!! There was a piratebay torrent, and a few of the books are from that torrent, but there are many other tube manuals. If you bothered to check out the files in the torrent, and even bothered to notice that this torrent is 1.72GB, where as the one you refer to is 775MB you might have noticed that. And if you read what I wrote, I don't even take credit for the original scans. "

So, shmeghead, thanks for sharing. Don't let those few fools harsh your buzz."
