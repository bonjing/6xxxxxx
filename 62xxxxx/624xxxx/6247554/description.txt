1.	Backing Up Information
o	1 
Insert the Norton Ghost 2003 software CD into your computer and follow the automated instructions to install it. Note down the serial number it gives you as you will need this to use the "restore" function.
Once the program has installed go into the start menu and select Norton Ghost to bring up the main menu panel.
	2 
Choose "backup" in the menu screen. This will open the backup wizard. The wizard will ask you to select a source drive and a backup drive. The source drive is the main hard drive of your computer where all your saved information and programs are. This is usually drive C but may be multiple drives as well.
	3 
Choose a backup drive. The backup drive is either an internal or external hard drive onto which you want to save a copy of your files. It is a good idea to choose an external hard drive so that if you lose your computer, you still have all the information. Plug this hard drive into the computer and select it as the backup drive.
2.	Restoring Information
	1 
Choose "Backup/Restore" in the main menu. In the restore wizard again select your source drive. This time your source drive is the hard disk that holds your backup files.
	2 
Choose your destination hard drive. This is the drive of your computer which originally held the files, and for whatever reason, lost them (usually C drive).
	3 
Select next and the files will begin to be restored.
