,Newvo,2012-03-09T15:33Z,"Hi! I'm using the latest version of uTorrent and it somehow is not able to begin downloading the files from your magnet link. Couldn't even fetch the files list from it. Not to menthion there is no torrent file for this torrent of yours. 
All the other magnet links from this site works well, so it must be something with your particular torrent."
,captnzap,2012-04-21T03:00Z,Same as Newvo.  Magnet does not pickup torrent information.
