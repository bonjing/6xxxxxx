Thankyou MARCODRGZ  !  "

Version 1: has the lead guitar is heavely distorted and plays a solo.

Version 2: the lead guitar is not distorted and is very very soft, some riffs of distortion can still be heard after the solo but they are bairly noticeable.  

This wimpy version of Let It Be seems to be the standard since in other albums play V2."
