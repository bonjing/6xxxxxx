I am just afraid if the seed falls to 0 that it will get dropped some day.
The other is Halls photo witch can be found in my Blog under the Piano link with a picture of the Saturn Test Facility in New Orleans in 64.
And my two Piano tunes which I hope I get better at soon."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T09:36Z,"I am switching to my blogspot wintersbutterfly.

I will also tweet new posts.

TheTwitsEnd

I have two new posts. This one and one called Uncle. I will start seeding this in just a little while.

If possible I will only tweet new posts rather than comment in here.
I have had no desire in the past to tweet.

U do not need to follow but if u can search for my account name or the usual tag wintersbutterfly.
If I lose the blog I will just torrent my backup here. thx

I will try a few more songs soon...if I find any I ever like. I will post them here on tpb someday when I feel comfortable with them."

(I am unsure which post to put this in..my picture is here...I hope she see this someday)
In my heart despite how flippant I am in my posts is an enormous pain as I realize more and more the absolute certainty in 385 downloaded torrents now and the extent of information that is now in this my family is probably aware of these being up here. And in that partially is that old fear, not to hurt dad, not to tell, of how bad I am.
But mostly just sorrow as I said in my last email to my sister. I wish this was different so badly. But it isn't. I wish the world was different but it isn't.
And to know beyond a doubt I will never see any of them again. At least once in keeping in contact with them was a potential in something in this to resolve.
Of it not feeling so terribly bad. Of getting ride of that empty feeling. Compassion for what my mom went through.
And I will say it in my bitterness cause I just know no other way.
At what point does a husband say to a wife. Honey I'd like to molest the kids.
How exactly does that take place between adults?
And if not that straight out?
Upon discovery of what your husband is doing, does it rip you apart the same way it has me now in my memories."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T14:41Z,"And in that I not only feel for her, but I understand the intensity of that emotion. And it tears at me for her despite my painful memories.
And I know around 74 in the playroom one day noticing that far off look in her eye and knowing that she was no longer there.
I have seen that look now in so many victims eyes.
And recently before my pain drove me away in their denial and inability to acknowledge these things.
She was doing so much better and so much happier it seemed.
And hurts inside me to bring her back to this.
I never chose too. I never chose to.
I want her to know that and my hatred at this world in not being able to work this through any other way but so publicly.
I have the quilt she made me. That may mean nothing to her at this point. But I have nothing else, but the quilt.
And these words to will only bring her more pain. And it is so hard to hold on to the certainty of Everything. "
