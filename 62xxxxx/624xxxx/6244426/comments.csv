I am not saying I have access to anything special in any of this. I was doing this for my own interest in what I could remember and this is most likely pretty much general knowledge.

 But I am like this with everything, is what I was trying to point out and failed to. I can tell you at least in the 80's who was in what movie...little dumb details....in detail... so why is my memory or the validity of what I am saying apparently questioned.

But that wasn't the intent in posting this. I see these things here not as criminal or suggestive of conspiracy just strange crap that people forget a little about in history. And they make me think about odditiy of everything. Thats all. Just got bored is all. I just like the details in the forest sometimes."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T11:53Z,"And my editing in here is none existent...This is what I face when I try and make something presentable. I get bored sometimes til the sun comes up....I usually sleep from 6- about 1:00 in the afternoon.
And as I have said, short of staring at he walls..there aint much to do,."

You now why the band the Police have their name.
IT was of course the drummer I believe who was an original founder of the CIA also. 
Or is that one of those urban legends like Mikey choking?
And um...my favorite of all in WWII the cooking lady in England. And that is really funny to me at least."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T12:47Z,the drummers father...I wish I didn't leave so many words out...the drummers father.
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T12:50Z,And the Gong Show guy who ended the movie saying he wanted to create a new Game Show where they bring in old men and ask them to consider their lives after handing them a hand gun. The one who after looking back doesn't do himself in...wins a refrigerator.

Same Bat Time?

This is from a post on my Blog. This part fits. Its what got me started here:

I do know that the two Dulles brothers coordinated the CIA among the elements of the original NSA established in law under Truman and those who had served in intelligence in WWII, Casey who was head of the CIA under Reagan was one of those originals, and it was Casey that Woodward or Bernstein interviewed right before he died of a tumor immediately after being subpoenaed to testify in the trial of Oliver North, I think before the Senate.
And no I am not paranoid enough to believe Casey who was head of CIA was done in to avoid his testimony. I am however paranoid enough to believe that he just may actually not have died when they said he did."

The only thing in her otherwise is Chris Russos comment ot me after Eddie died that his family was in the New Orleans Mafia. They moved right after Eddie died. I have Chris' pictures through out my year books. He is real. And he didn't say hey I think I'm related to the guy in Jim Garrisons prosecution in New Orleans of Clay Shaw.
He said the New Orleans Mafia. I thought he was full crap at the time. I had never heard of it myself til many years later.
