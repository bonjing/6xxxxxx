,Guillo_89,2011-03-17T21:23Z,"Ok, I'm having a problem.

After I unpacked with phoenix (1.5 beta3), I downloaded the steam fix unlock but I can't install it. Whenever I try to unpack the content to any folder an error comes up. It either says ""ERROR: archive data corrupted (decompression fails)"" (or something just like that), or it says ""CRC check failed"". Whatever the message, the thing is that I can't unpack the content, therefore I can't update the damn game. 

I've tried to google it but no one seems to be having this problem. If anyone gives me a solution, I would be extremely grateful.

Also I downloaded every version of the steam update and none seem to work"
