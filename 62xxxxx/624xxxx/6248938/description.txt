James Guthries relationship with David Gilmour and Pink Floyd dates back to 1978 when he served as co-producer, engineer and sound mixer on the album, The Wall.  He eventually won a grammy for his efforts in 1980.

He originally mixed Gilmours second solo album About Face in 1984 and then went back to remaster it 22 years later in 2006.
