,polarhawk,2011-03-24T18:28Z,"the game asks if it should upgrade my console as soon as i load it. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid, but will this block my xbox due to AP 2.5? And if it does, will I still be able to play my old backups afterwards?"
,bball230,2011-03-27T22:23Z,"in my experience, when i update games after i have downloaded them and used abgx 360 it doesnt matter. I dont think it has anything to do with ap2.5. its just a game update."
