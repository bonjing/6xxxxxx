Daryl Hall takes the 40th and latest webisode of Live From Darylâ€™s House to Kauai, Hawaii, where he and old Philly pal Todd Rundgren join together live from Toddâ€™s house for a rousing seven-song set that includes Daryl Hall and John Oatesâ€™ â€œBeanie G and the Rose Tattooâ€ and a cover of the Delfonicsâ€™ 1970 hit, â€œDidnâ€™t I Blow Your Mind This Time.â€ The newest installment of the Webby award-winning Internet series, which recently made its broadcast debut on WGN in Chicago to impressive ratings, will debut at www.lfdh.com on March 15.

Hall and Rundgren have known each other since the â€˜60s, when they were both fledgling musicians in Philadelphia, with a love of R&B, soul and doo-wop groups, reflected in their earliest music. The two previously paired up in a previous Live from Darylâ€™s House and now Todd returns the favor, with some down-home hospitality that includes an old-fashioned Luau Show, burying a pig in the dirt, serving up some amazing poi, with fire, hula dancers and a special performance with local musicians of â€œBang on the Drum.â€

â€œItâ€™s always great when friends come all the way out here to visit,â€ laughed Todd. â€œItâ€™s even better when they come to play. Thanks, Daryl!â€
