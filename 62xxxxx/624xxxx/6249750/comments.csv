,KnowitAll,2012-03-02T19:46Z,"Boy, you guys don't get around much do you? Ok. To jailbreak an ipod touch got to www.redsn0w.us.

To jailbreak an iphone or iPad 1 or 2 go to www.greenpois0n.us. 

Next, to add these games to your iDevice use iFunBox (www.i-funbox.com). Open it, connect your iDevice to your pc with its cord,(wait for itunes to get out of the way, close it) and click Install App| App Fast In button. Search for the app (mine's on the desktop) and click it to install. You're done! exit the program.

I would suggest then unplugging your iDevice and turn it off, wait 5 seconds and turn it on. Connect to itunes again and sync, then Transfer your purchases to the pc and back it up. Hope this helps. :D"
,KnowitAll,2012-03-02T19:49Z,"By the way, after you jailbreak I would suggest you get the source for Installous through Cydia. You can download all the games you want through it."
