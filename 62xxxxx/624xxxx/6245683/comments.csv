,Tamarind777,2011-03-16T04:56Z,The link to download the torrent does not work.
,Rhiannel,2011-03-17T20:32Z,"That is odd. I have people downloading the torrent as we speak. I could only try to re-upload the torrent again, as editing torrents is temporarily disabled. 

I'm sorry for the inconvenience. "

Thought I'd just let everyone know. :)"
