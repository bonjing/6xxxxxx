,grays0n,2011-03-14T08:25Z,How do you decode this? I't's asking for a filename encoding to which none work? Please help me.
,Lixifer,2011-03-14T09:29Z,"@Grayson: Its packed and can be unpacked with ""winrar"".  After that the unpacked video file is mkv and can be viewed with ""vlc"".  I hope that answers your question."
,grays0n,2011-03-14T10:36Z,Unfortunately I am on a Mac and have tried every unRARer there is but I do indeed use VLC to view MKV files.
