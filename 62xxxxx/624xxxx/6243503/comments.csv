,outlaw_star1982,2011-11-07T18:48Z,ALL FILES ARE IN .M4A(MPEG 4) FORMAT. Please note this in the description incase thats not what people are looking for. thanks.
,lovefromIndia,2011-12-06T09:35Z,Thanks a lot. Quality is real good. Love MUSE.
,GDPanda,2012-01-06T22:42Z,Excellent torrent! Files are organized and perfect! Thank you!
,sabeku,2012-04-01T15:46Z,"Very fast download! Although, as some other Muse discography torrents have mentioned, this too lacks some songs.
""No cave
No b-sides
No Hyper Music
No Hullabaloo""
There are only 58 files (songs) in this torrent, not the ""94 completely unique tracks"" Muse has.
[thanks Blacker.Death.Metal for providing the information from another torrent]
And be reminded as outlaw_star1982 said, all files are .m4a format. If you can't play them, look into a program that can, such as Foobar.
Thanks for the good download! Will seed!"
