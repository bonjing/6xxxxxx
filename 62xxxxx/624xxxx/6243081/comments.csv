,yarzoPB,2011-04-10T21:15Z,Awesome quality rip and very funny movie.
,Vkitsune,2011-07-14T09:34Z,"Excellent quality, picture is nice and crisp. It certainly does have a meta heavy plot to it...

@peeyoosh Yes, I liked it. Next time perhaps stick to the Transformers movies and Schoolhouse Rock cartoons."

,kingjoser,2011-10-30T11:05Z,"It started out ok, but towards the end got boring and i was starting to get annoyed by the bad actors. And the people with the Binoculars interrupting the movie all the time was stupid! Should've cut them out. 4/10. I like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes better! Good quality, though"
