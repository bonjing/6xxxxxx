Street Fighter IV, not as good as it's later counterpart Super Street Fighter IV but still when SFIV came out back in 2009 it was what every SF fan had been yearning for and boy how it lived to the hype.

Albeit for me, I could not and still can't master the big hyper moves but that aside I found it an amazing game as I'm sure you do, and what was even more amazing was the music in the game, every stage, intro, etc had upbeat music which is why boys and girls I bring to you the Street Fighter IV OST.

Now before you start worrying if this OST always contains the two minute Indestructible opening them, the answer would be no as I have managed courtesy of youtube and converted to .mp3 format the full opening theme, also in the folder is a pretty nifty SFIV instrumental remix along with a few other remixes which also pretty nifty.

Here is the OST list minus the remixes:
