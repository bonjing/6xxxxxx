,pro00mo,2011-05-28T02:15Z,"WOW!!! This movie is a fucking joke!! Why would they make such a dumb shit thing? Best part is the first 2 minutes of the film, a cunt cop comes out of the trunk and talks shit, e.g why did the chicken cross the road? No reason! Why do we fuck? no reason! why does my cock go hard? no reason lol. shit film!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,Zakap24,2011-06-29T21:58Z,"you're supposed to comment on the torrents themselves and not the movie. 
However, I personally love the movie."

,adje666nl,2011-09-15T19:21Z,do u have to be stoned to like this movie?
,kingjoser,2011-10-30T11:04Z,"It started out ok, but towards the end got boring and i was starting to get annoyed by the bad actors. And the people with the Binoculars interrupting the movie all the time was stupid! Should've cut them out. 4/10. I like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes better!"
,vignater,2012-01-24T14:59Z,This gotta be one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Both me and my mum loved it. Great upload!
