,radumanu,2011-08-10T09:44Z,Can you explain to me the moment in the end where Cornelis is in Denmark and he sings and everybody understands and sings the song with him. I guess most of them being danish... either Cornelis was singing in danish? or  danish people have no problem understanding and singing in swedish? I'm a bit confused...
,radumanu,2011-08-10T10:13Z,"BTW: here are english subtitles which perfectly fit this rip:

,cochcoch221,2011-11-28T00:32Z,radumanu! the thing is he was singing a song that everyone knows. it's to show that many young people started listening to him also. and its not only danish peolpe at roskilde. a lot of swedish kids go there too. and he is infact singing in swedish it's just that anyone who's ever heard of him knows that song.
