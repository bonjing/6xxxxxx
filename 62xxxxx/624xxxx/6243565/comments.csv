I received word from my ISP that my IP had been flagged for downloading/distributing copyrighted material.  Don't make my mistake; go download and use PeerBlock (www.peerblock.com)

Happy Pirating!"
,Damien74,2011-03-22T02:13Z,"Better using a VPN. If you wanna use Peerblock with torrents you need lists to allow seeders or you wont be able to. And those lists costs money. Ads are not allowed here collinds, even so neatly ""hidden"" as yours are. "
