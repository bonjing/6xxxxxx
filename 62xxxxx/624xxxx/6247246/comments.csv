You must first have a BitTorrent client
Search uTorrent or BitTorrent.

After you've installed it, go to this torrent and click on ""Download this torrent"""

,onlymeyana,2011-08-12T18:42Z,"locobot12: It's not ""Singles ALL"" if you put one song from the album into a folder and call it singles...

Singles includes mixes...

ex ""Set fire to the rain"" includes this files...

1. Set Fire to the Rain [ThomasGold Remix] 5:50
2. Set Fire to the Rain [ThomasGold Dub] 5:21
3. Set Fire to the Rain [Moto Blanco Remix] 7:38
4. Set Fire to the Rain [Moto Blanco Edit] 3:35

So... it's not any mixes in this torrent... and that is not ""Singles ALL""..."

,seivohc,2012-03-01T07:31Z,Can someone please tell me whether it is possible to select individual albums/songs with the magnet link? I used to not use magnet links because I like to select what I want from a discography. Now I open the magnet link in uTorrent and don't seem to be able to select what part of the discography I want specifically. Thank you!
,looolzing,2012-03-03T14:54Z,I can't download it!?!? Help me!!
