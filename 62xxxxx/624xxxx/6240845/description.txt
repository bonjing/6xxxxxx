DIVX DVD RIP ENGLISH VER. NO SUBS.

This cult classic pits the legendary Godzilla in a battle to the finish against invaders from Space-M: the chicken-headed Gigan 
and his evil cronies, who have turned an amusement park into the home base from which they wreak havoc. But Godzilla 
won't let them get away with their plans, even if it means venturing into enemy territory. Hiroshi Ishikawa and 
Tomoko Umeda co-star.
