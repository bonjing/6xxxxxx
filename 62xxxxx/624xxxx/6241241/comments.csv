torrent is trusted... i've used it long time ago...
just.. the seeding is not that healthy... give it a try.

about Lord of the Ring triology..
ticken has mentioned too may times... that the movies are too long... and gonna take like 900mb each... and the electricity failiers occer make it impossible to convert them..
and gonna take like a whole week just to upload the 3 files.
so... dont u think it would be a little more kind... to movie on. 
(btw it is a good movie... just too long man!)

looking foward to see some Mystery | Thriller | Action movies in the list ...

because i don't think StyLishSaLH has the enough time to.. listen to all the requests; download movies; convert them; upload on torrent...
and ....PLUS+ to search for old entries ?? :\

so.. i'm asking everyone.. ""help each other out yaar!
