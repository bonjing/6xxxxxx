This little app packs a lot of special features into a small package.  The controls are kind of acquired but you will know after playing with it for awhile why they called it FLARE.  The best effect can be achieved by using the flames texture. Give it a try and see.... If you like a preset that you made don't forget to save it, because it only handles a single image at a time.
