The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 463,000 copies in its first week. It received general acclaim from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 84/100 from Metacritic.[12] According to The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), The Black Album is \"old-school and utterly modern\", as it showed Jay-Z \"at the top of his game, able to reinvent himself as a rap classicist at the right time, as if to cement his place in hip-hop\'s legacy for generations to come\".[13] Pitchfork Media ranked The Black Album at number 90 on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s,[14] and Slant Magazine ranked it number 7 on its list of the Top 100 Albums of the 2000s.[15] Steve \'Flash\' Juon at Rap Reviews.com gave the album 9/9/9 saying, \"Whether this release will settle the debate about his rank in hip-hop or just fuel the discussion further is ultimately not as important as whether or not this is a good album. It\'s not a good album - it\'s a GREAT album.\" [16]

According to Billboard, the album is Jay-Z\'s top selling album of the 2000s and the 136th highest selling album of the decade in the United States.[17]
