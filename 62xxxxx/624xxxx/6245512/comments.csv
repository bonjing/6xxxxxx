 GOOD LUCK FINDING A CRACK FOR ANY NEW UBISOFT DRM!"

,Insomneac,2011-03-16T04:53Z,"And the reason why H.A.W.X 2 wasn't cracked isn't because they can't, it's because they're not interested.

If a group wanted to, they could easily crack it."
,xiIix,2011-07-07T17:20Z,"They NEED to crack Hawx 2. Why in the world would they not be interested in cracking it?? It makes no sense. The DRM war is important, they need to crack that game, and every game ubisoft makes, because otherwise they win! I have a sneaking suspicion that they can't crack it, otherwise they would've. It's that simple. I URGE a group to prove me wrong. 

I would be willing to put up $100 towards the labor involved in cracking this game. I of course wouldn't pay until a result was given, but I would indeed pay. Like I said, this is about more than just getting a game for free, this is about the war against DRM. Ubisoft are evil assholes and I would rather give my money to a cracker."
