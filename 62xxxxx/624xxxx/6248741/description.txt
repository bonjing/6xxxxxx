Center of the Universe: Apokryfa

â€œApokryfaâ€ is an album that defies both space and time, and borrows or steals from myriad influences. Over the mountains of azerbaijan, to the greek isles and to the british isles via Armenia the stringed and reeded instruments carry us. Backed up by a seventies drumkit, accordion and deep electronic frequencies, Apokryfa will be a folksploitational journey to unknown regions.

The songs on this album are based on excerpts of written music and traditionals, found on travels to Serbia, United Kingdom, Syldavia, Bosnia Hercegovina, Belgium, Spain, Sweden and Norway.

Some parts of the songs are also reconstructed from Albanian and Azerbaijani sheet music. Apokryfa is C.O.U. 12th album, and it completes the triliogy a about space and time that startet with the albums \\\\\\\"Anachronisma (2056)\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Simulacra (2008)\\\\\\\"
