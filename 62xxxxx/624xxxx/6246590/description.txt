Some very old tunes.
Music from 1890s thru 1920s with a few from post 1940,
and a selection from Victoria Spivey.

Be warned that these tracks are digitized from old source and therefore low quality.

These were converted long ago, so there is a chance that a newer HiDef conversion has been pushed. (If so please post torrent link in comment, thanks)
