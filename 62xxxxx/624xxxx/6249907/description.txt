Exponerad [Classic 1971][VhsRip].avi

Lena is alone in the city while her parents are on vacation. She's torn between her innocent boyfriend and the older, more experienced and sadistic sociopath Helge. She tells Jan about Helge. He gets angry and slaps her, so she runs away and hitches a lift with the promiscuous and friendly couple Lars and Ulla, whom she takes to Jan's mother's summer cabin. The day after, Jan finds her there and takes her back to the city, where she is yet again drawn to Helge. Lena's memories, the present and her fantasies are frequently mixed.
