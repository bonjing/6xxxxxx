"The Way the Cookie Crumbles"

When Cleveland sees all of his childhood 
possessions around town, he learns that his 
parents, Freight Train (guest voice Craig 
Robinson) and Cookie (guest voice Frances Callier) 
have been selling his stuff to get money after 
being scammed out of their life savings. Together, 
Cleveland, Freight Train and their friends get 
together to bring down the con man who targeted 
their family. Meanwhile, Rallo gets a toy Mr. 
Microphone and tries his hand at being a 
commentator, announcer and stand-up comic.

Enjoy :)
