might (band)

Big Red (song)


I don't believe this song has anything to do with Russia, or chewing gum.  But, I could be wrong.

Off the band's first release "might ep" (2009)



The 2nd half has a nice rumbling march - 

boom.

I am typically always seeding - check it out for any might media I can find!

The group is gaining attention - now is the time to start documenting - 


If this is good to your ears - spread the word.
Share this music - the band shouldn't mind new fans.
