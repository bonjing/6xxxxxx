It's funny to read ""to avoid fakes, always check that the torrent was added by tvteam"" 

There is no s16e08, so what's up with the statement?

Fake fake fake fake. This is like episode 1 of season 16 or something. Either way it's not E08."
,Bi$hy,2011-04-22T16:19Z,why say its fake? isnt it a special?
,rsalad,2011-05-12T14:13Z,"This is S16E05, in its' entirety. I have no idea what TvTeam is thinking with this."
