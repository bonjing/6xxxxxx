,Gewruu,2011-03-17T03:55Z,"through the metal door and at the bottom of the ladder there is a minecart booster, get those 3 carts to push eachother around and then step on the pad"

,mcstat,2011-04-14T08:10Z,Wow this is a pretty epic build. Easy to get lost in. Lots of insane rooms that I don't understand.
,Gewruu,2011-04-27T04:46Z,@mcstat: you're welcome. and yeah. the base in between the surface and the cavern is supposed to confuse you.
