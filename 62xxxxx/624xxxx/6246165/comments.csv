[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T02:06Z,"Until imageshack actually starts deleting images I will not stop using them.  They have the best performance of all the image hosters I have seen and are very simple to upload to.  Use work around documented above that I am placing in every torrent (use https or google chrome new tabs). 

Just change your bookmark to:

https://thepiratebay.org/user/HolyRoses/"
,noOrp,2011-03-16T06:29Z,"@ HR,

tried doing all the above mate,

even signed up on imageshack ...

couldn't see the pics even while being logged in...


maybe use photobucket or something ....which is easier for you to upload & us to see :)"
,vCJv,2011-03-16T12:14Z,"Thanks, your HTTPS idea worked for me."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T13:00Z,noOrp the only issue is imageshack is blocking the picture if it detects an http_referer of thepiratebay.  using https while talking to piratebay makes it so when you click on external links the http_referer value is not sent.  google chrome also does not send http_referer on open in new tab.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T13:02Z,i also upload to other sites where the picture is embedded in the BB code if you want to just try those sites.
,shadowgp7,2011-03-16T16:05Z,"Thanx for the great releases and your time...can i make a request?

80s classic, BMX Bandits (Released yesterday in Blu-ray only in the US).

P.S:Best UPLOADS!"
,Critic_101,2011-03-16T17:26Z,I remember BMX bandits its the one with a very young Nicole Kidman in one of her first roles!
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T18:59Z,seems like i saw that on some movie channel a few years back.  i'm old :(
,noOrp,2011-03-17T10:39Z,"@ HR, 

tried using Chrome also, mate ....

same issue :/"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-17T12:52Z,what actually happens?
,noOrp,2011-03-18T20:40Z,"it just shows imageshack blocked domain thing,

with that frog in a cube logo..."
,ZZXX22343IceSkull2234XXZZ,2011-03-24T02:25Z,"Not sure what your issue is mate, I use chrome and I just copy/paste the link into a new tab and it shows up. "
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-24T03:08Z,whatever noOrp is doing is wrong.  clear your cache or something.  the images are fine using the solutions i provided.
,ifranklin,2011-03-26T04:57Z,"HR, thank you so much for all these movies.  I am a first time user and brand new iPad 2 owner. I downloaded this movie and it will play in iTunes, however when I transfer this or Jackass3 to my iPad it will not play or the sound won't work or if I scan for it will freeze.

Should this format and settings work for my iPad 2?

Thank you for all the help to anyone who can help answer this question"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-27T01:47Z,should work fine.  dont have an ipad2 though to test with.  you are the first person to say an issue with ipad2.
,Salster07,2011-03-28T23:09Z,"Hi HR,

I am having problems playing this on my PS3 with a thing called cinavia. It mutes the movie after 30 minutes and won't play sound. It makes no difference if I watch it over PS3 media server or off of a USB stick. Any one else having this issue or does any one know how to actually fix it.

Thanks"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-29T01:21Z,"this will happen with all sony films.  there are workarounds posted on youtube.  they require modifying your audio settings, but i dont know if they still work."
,EiNST3iN,2011-03-30T18:25Z,What is the resolution?
,kurtly,2011-06-10T13:36Z,"Hi

Your uploads came highly recommended to me, and as such i have downloaded many, the video is fantastic and i am guessing the audio is too however i can not get any of your uploads to play in 5.1. They all play in 2 channel no problem but no surround. I am playing the files on PS3 and then through my amp, i have triple checked all my settings and they are fine - i checked them against another download and it plays in 5.1 no problem. Can anyone help me with this? i have downloaded about twenty titles from holyroses - all the same. Audio is just as important as video for me. Thanks and keep up the fantastic work!"
,kurtly,2011-06-10T13:42Z,please disregard everything i wrote except how wonderful your downloads are. Video and Audio is superb. Im a dick there was one setting i didnt check which gave me the option of 2 ch or 5ch. Thanks again Holyroses. much love
,kurtly,2011-06-10T13:45Z,pls disregard my comment. prob sorted. thanks again for the uploads . Audio and Video  is superb
