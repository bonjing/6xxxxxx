Should you have questions, Fifth Generation System\'s technical support staff
is available by calling 504-291-7283 Monday through Friday 7 AM to 7 PM
(Central Time).  We hope you enjoy using Direct Access 5.1!  
 
============================================================================

1.   Device Driver Installation (Optional)  

     The Direct Access Network Device Driver must be installed on each    
     workstation separately using the installation routine INSTLDEV.EXE or  
     using an editor to modify the CONFIG.SYS file.  After installation, the
     workstation must be rebooted to activate the Device Driver. 
    

============================================================================

2.   Usage Tracking of Custom Applications when the Device Driver is Loaded 
     
     Two entries will occur in the Usage Tracking Log file for a Custom
     Application if the Direct Access Network Device Driver is active.  This
     will not affect the total time recorded for the application because the
     first entry will have N/A as the total time.  


============================================================================

3.   Disable \"Shelling\" to DOS with Device Driver 

     You may want to use the Device Driver to prevent access to DOS by
     disabling the ability to \"shell\" out of applications.  To prevent
     shelling, you must do two things: 

     1.   Install the Device Driver as described in the User\'s Manual.
          Answer \'Yes\' to the question that asks \'Do you wish to activate
          security?\' 

     2.   For any menu items that have the capability to shell out to DOS,
          you will need to change one of the option settings. 

          a.   Go to Create/Modify Sub-Menus for the item for which you
               will disable the \"shell\" function. 

          b.   Press the F8 key. 

          c.   Set the option for \'Disable Control-Break\' to \'Yes\'.
