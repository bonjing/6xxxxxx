,Roqwell,2011-03-18T00:50Z,I'll be seeding for like a week once this gets a decent amount of seeders!
,haj_ali,2011-03-18T01:09Z,"droidip:  you are the best, man.  Thank you so much for all of your high quality and useful uploads!

Been hoping for this one for a while!

Any chance you could ul gratuitous space battles for mac?  This game is not possible to find for mac.

Once again, thank you for all of your hard work, you have a lot of fans!!"
,brownl123,2011-03-18T06:01Z,does this work? also could you get doom 3 and fallout 3?????? thnks! you rock droidip!!!!
[T],droidip,2011-03-18T11:57Z,"@Poeticile works without any problems for me. If you read some comments in app store you can find out that even people who bought this game have some problems. 
@brownl123 I uploaded this because my followers is almost 1000. Its not mean that I will upload all real games.
Thx :)"
,twistquist,2011-03-18T16:22Z,"I still cant believe I paid money for this on the mac app store...

The port in general is probably fine if you have sufficient hardware.. but I had to turn dynamic shadowing off and have everything set to shit just to get a decent framerate.



I then went to steam under windows and bought it again for well under half the price... Everything turned on, maxed out, amazing framerate.. and an actual community to play it with.



Pirate the shit out of this, they shouldnt even be allowed to put pieces of trash like this on the store when it was obviously not running ideally for what the tech specs said was recommended. "
,haj_ali,2011-03-18T20:15Z,"@twistquiet
its likely a combination of a shitty port and shitty mac graphics drivers.  I assume it worked well on windows, on the same machine, no?

Look at Starcraft 2 and almost every other game, same thing.  Apple should really be receiving more heat for this, they charge this much for a computer, claiming its the best and the fastest, but bottleneck the hardware with cheapskate drivers."
,vichetmeng,2011-03-19T10:30Z,Please seed :( ! I'm downloading at 30kb/sec !! And this game is 9 fucking GB ! Seed for god sake ! DAMN ! :(

Thanks !!!"
,Poeticile,2011-03-20T18:49Z,Love it how the seeders drop from 90 to 50 in a couple hours. 
,imahaxyoo,2011-03-21T11:38Z,"Please shut the fuck up about PC vs Mac, thanks.
FYI If you struggle to run this on your Mac you must be seriously out dated? I run the ported version on a LAPTOP and my FPS is absolutely fine!
I know its stupid to 'update' your computer just for a game, but you'll have to face it sooner or later that if you can't even run this, wait till new games come out."

btw, your uploads working great! gratz on your purple skull!

,adhi5000,2011-03-21T22:44Z,what happens if you update?
,rbonds,2011-03-22T01:17Z,"Thanks for the upload, but when I try to run the borderlands app from the crack.zip file (I unzipped it using Zipeg) it sends me an error saying, ""Failed to find default engine .ini file to retrieve My Documents subdirectory to use.  Force Quitting.""
Still seeding just in case it's only me :)"
[T],droidip,2011-03-22T12:28Z,"@adhi5000, rbonds Unzip (just double click) crack and move it to install dir. Replace and run it, now you dont need to put in any serial. 
If you update it will ask for a serial, the crack is not made for 1.0.1 yet."

,slam999,2011-03-24T01:33Z,"Plays like shit. I have a badass Mac Pro tower, 2 duel core 3 GHz Xeons, fast video card, and I can't get more than 10 FPS in 800 x 600, lowest settings for all video options.

640 x 480 runs even slower, about 1 FPS.

As I got to the second mission more and more enemies became invisible. Now the little robot dude is invisible too. 

This must be an awesome game on PC but this port is craptacular. 

Installed the 1.01 update and that doesn't help either."
,thisisnotfunny,2011-03-24T19:14Z,Does anyone know how to install the add-on? I finished the whole game but I didn't encounter any add-on content.

,zander05,2011-04-06T14:11Z,Still no luck with me. I created a read/write version of the main Data dmg and then added all the dlc1 data into the relevant folders.

Here are the instructions:

1. Go to /Applications/Borderlands and mount BorderlandsData.dmg
2. Open up Disk Utility
3. Right click on the BorderlandsData.dmg file in the left column and select convert
4. Select read/write and save to desktop
5. Once that is done unmount the "
,uliengue,2011-04-16T05:41Z,"Borderlands.dmg that was opened from /Applications/Borderlands
6. Go to /Applications/Borderlands and mount BorderlandsAdd-On.dmg
7. Go to /Desktop and mount the newly created read/write BorderlandsData.dmg
8. Go to /Volumes/BorderlandsData/WillowGame/CookedPC/
9. Make a folder called ""DLC"" in /Volumes/BorderlandsData/Data/WillowGame/CookedPC/
10. Go to /Volumes/BorderlandsAdd-On/Data and copy all 4 DLC folders into /Volumes/BorderlandsData/Data/WillowGame/CookedPC/DLC
11. Unmount all Borderlands images from desktop and backup/remove BorderlandsData.dmg + BorderlandsAdd-On.dmg from /Applications/Borderlands

,uliengue,2011-04-16T05:42Z,"13. Run Game
14. You will notice a series of ""Ambiguous Package Name"" errors related to DLC3. This is due to the fact that there is 2 sets of similar .upk files referencing to this DLC in the dmg image. Pay attention to which files they reference to. Press Ok to ignore.

15. When the game is loading up you will be prompted about the DLC activation. Press Ok for each prompt. Test out the game and the DLC by using a teleporter and see if the DLC areas show up.
16. If the DLC content works, you can now remove the conflicting files that point to /Volumes/BorderlandsData/Data/WillowGame/CookedPC/Patch. They should be:

/Volumes/BorderlandsData/Data/WillowGame/CookedPC/Patch/dlc3_PackageDefinition_SF_LOC_DEU.upk

/Volumes/BorderlandsData/Data/WillowGame/CookedPC/Patch/dlc3_PackageDefinition_SF_LOC_ITA.upk

17. Run game again to see if it loads properly."

20. Select compressed and save to desktop
21. Once that is done unmount the Borderlands.dmg that was opened from /Applications/Borderlands
22. Remove BorderlandsData.dmg from /Applications/Borderlands
23. Move /Desktop/BorderlandsData.dmg into /Applications/Borderlands

,zander05,2011-04-16T11:36Z,@uliengue Im pretty sure thats the method i tried a while ago. It didnt work for me...but i could easily have gone wrong somewhere. Im looking forward to hearing your verdict.

,zander05,2011-04-17T01:33Z,"Unfortunately i deleted my character and cant get him back. Would anyone with a roland character, who has completed quite a few levels (but no dlc), be interested in making a torrent with the save file? Located in 'library/preferences/feralinteractive/savedata'

p.s. i know that there is a Mordecai save file included in the download, but im not a fan of playing him."

,zander05,2011-04-22T16:23Z,"@mc23422 Sorry to hear its not working for you. Not that it helps your problem, but everything works perfectly for me...including online.
Can you be more specific about the problem? Is it gameranger which is not working the second time? How far does borderlands open? Does it crash at the ""which load file do you want to open?"". If thats the case, then it happened to me once too. Turned out that it was because when i was playing online someone had given me a modded gun. What i did was go back to multiplayer and drop the gun. Then borderlands worked fine again."

@TryBeforeBuy Im running a 2010 top spec mbp 13"" and there isnt any lag for me (only a little in the general knoxx addon, but all i do is reduce the game texture a little). Only thing i can suggest is that you make sure anti-aliasing is set to off. This will increase your performance a lot.
If that doesnt work then just make sure that you are not running any other programs whist playing."

thanks!"
,zombird,2011-08-31T03:16Z,"Thanks, works perfectly.

If anyone is having trouble here's a few tips-
First off, check the minimum specs. 
1.If you don't have Snow Leopard 10.6.4 or higher, this won't work. 
2.Make sure you have at least 1GB RAM(Although I recommend at least 2GB) 
3.Make sure your graphic card has at least 128MB
4.10GB of Hard Drive space
Okay, now for installing and whatnot-
1.Open the DMG included in the torrent
2.Drag the folder ""Borderlands"" into your Applications folder(The DLC is included in this folder)
3.Extract the zip file included, which will have a cracked Borderlands.App
4.Move the cracked app to the Borderlands folder, now in your applications(replace the existing one with it)
5.Launch the game
6.A window will come up, simply uncheck the box on the lower left of the window. No need for a serial number... and that box won't pop up anymore
7.Play. 
If you don't have great specs like me, make sure you set everything to low in the options. And in the case of this game, it still looks great on low.
One more thing, to access the DLC you must have the fast-travel option enabled. You will get this later in the game, and it will be at the New-U stations. Jacobs Cove, T-bone Junction, The Underdome and Tartarus Station are the 4 fast-travel locations for the DLC. 
Enjoi."

1. Go to /Applications/Borderlands and mount BorderlandsData.dmg
2. Open up Disk Utility

,D-Hustle,2011-12-21T20:10Z,"

Those with problems opening up stores and inventory change the shortcuts in options. Without goin too much into it you gotta set all the ""map"" shortcuts to one button so the rest will disappear.
Like, I found out if I press ""K"" that menu pops up no problem so I just went in and set all the menu stuff to ""K""..

Once you set two of the same the other one will erase. Jus mess with that an you'll know what I mean. "
