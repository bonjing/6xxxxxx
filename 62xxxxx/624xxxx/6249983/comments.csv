,mk318020,2011-03-31T18:53Z,Please Seed This Iam Stuck At 82% .Thanks
,btfan13,2011-04-01T22:41Z,Works great!  EXCEPT the 4:3 scale is off and leaves thick black borders on both sides of the video.  Previous versions of Video Editor always scaled it just right but this one does not.  If you can live with that then this is good.
,dvit85,2011-04-09T10:16Z,Great....thanks...works fine...
,L4F,2011-04-17T07:34Z,"Easy to install... Works Great under Windows7 Ultimate X64.

Much faster, more reliable, than the previous version.

Thanks a Lot for the UP!"
,Green-Banana,2011-05-01T07:35Z,"Thank you!  Thank you SO much!  I've been Googling and asking around the internet for MONTHS now to replace Windows Movie Maker, which freezes up with the simplest task of frame navigation and trimming, both of which this program handles impeccably!  And to think, all anyone ever needed to do was point in this direction for the answer!  Once again I have proven that I am apparently smarter than anyone else on the internet because they could not figure out this program existed, whereas I found the crack right here all along this whole time.  Thank you again.  "
