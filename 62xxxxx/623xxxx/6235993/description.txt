This is a new expanded version of the Three Sides Live album with altered sequencing and additional tracks. The recordings on this were done on the 1980 and 1981 tours for Duke and Abacab. The studio tracks that made up the fourth side of the vinyl version have been removed and placed with their respective albums. There are two songs not continguous with this era included on Three Sides Live: "The Fountain Of Salmacis" from 1978 and "It/Watcher Of The Skies" from 1976. I was going to cut these too, but "Fountain..." is flawlessly connected to "One For The Vine", so I left them.
I have used the Abacab tour setlist as the basis for the sequencing and attempted to keep the running order of songs from that tour in order as close as possible. Several songs played on that tour are not available so they have been replaced with songs from the "Duke" tour (in most cases). The additional songs on this not found on the original Three sides Live CD are from the Archive 2 box set (marked with an asterisk (*) and from the Perfect Three sides Live bootleg (marked with a plus (+).

Notes: The five songs from the Perfect Three Sides Live bootleg are originally sourced from mp3s taken from a vinyl source that I declicked. Some artifacts of the record still remain. I have been unable to locate a lossless source for this, hence the use of mp3s for the mastering. I want this to be perfectly clear that there are lossy sources mixed with lossless on this one. I have listed it under "other quality" for that reason.
Although I was going to make this one continuous concert the version of "Man On The Corner" on Archive 2 fades out at the end. Fortunately this fade occurs about half-way through the set, so it worked out conveniently as if there was an intermission.
