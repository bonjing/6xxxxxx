A 10/10 

On a side note, please everyone, remember to ACTUALLY BUY THIS if you really really like it. mc deserves your money, he's literally as independant as you can be. And besides, he's a really cool dude. :D

And if you CAN'T buy it, then just donate 5 bucks to his Cystic Fibrosis jar at the shows or on the site."
