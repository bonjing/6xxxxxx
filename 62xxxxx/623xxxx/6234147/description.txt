David Baerwald first came to prominence in 1987 as one half of the duo David & David, with David Ricketts. David and David's sole album, Boomtown, went platinum and stayed on the Billboard album chart for over a year, winning substantial critical acclaim. The duo split up following the success of that album for unexplained reasons.
 
Following the breakup of David and David, Baerwald focused on writing for others, often under pseudonyms, though he found time to record and release two albums: Bedtime Stories, a romantic album based on tales of suburban ennui and decay; and Triage, an ambitious narrative song-suite about the fringe-dwellers of America's paranoid and disaffected subcultures. Both albums were released to critical acclaim but did not see the commercial success that Boomtown did.

In fall of 1992, with friend and producer Bill Bottrell, he cofounded the Tuesday Night Music Club, which then helped launch the career of Sheryl Crow.
 
His songs have been recorded by a wide range of artists ranging from the aforementioned Crow to artists as disparate as Japanese classical artists the Yoshida Brothers, opera legend Luciano Pavarotti, rebel-country frontrunner Waylon Jennings, Bangles front woman Susanna Hoffs, country star LeeAnn Rimes, jazz artist Holly Cole, critic's darling Jesca Hoop, and actor/singers Kristen Stewart, Nicole Kidman, Ewan Magregor, Ethan Hawke, Hayden Pannettiere, Ashley Simpson, and Steven Strait, among many others.
