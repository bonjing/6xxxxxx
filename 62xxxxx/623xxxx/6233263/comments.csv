,cstkyd,2011-03-12T19:09Z,is this game works with 5.00 m33-6?  sorry got a slow bandwidth here that's why i'm asking...
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-12T19:17Z,"don't know, actually. have no 5.00 m33 to test. maybe someone will come up with it. though, i recommend updating to 6.20 TN at least, cuz all the new games work flawlessly with it and therefore doesn't require additional patching. cheers."
,tab_qwerty,2011-03-17T05:02Z,can u pls give me a firmware to update my psp on 6.20??plssss.my current yersion is 5.50 gen-d3
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-18T18:18Z,"if you've a non-slider monoblock PSP 1000/2000/3000 you can dl official 6.20 firmware from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6074084
if you've a PSP Go! you should dl official 6.20 firmware from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6074252
After downloading and updating to 6.20 just google for 6.20 TN-D HEN or dl it from psp-hacks.com
Also you'll need a Prometheus Iso Loader or it's analogue. Good luck."
