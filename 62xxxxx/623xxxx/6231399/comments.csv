,scottielass,2011-04-02T17:23Z,Thank you.
,Scazza,2011-04-17T16:48Z,"Thank you so much for these. They're great.

Some lines of dialogue/sides of conversations are omitted when they're not immediately relevant, and there are a couple of obtuse word choices that you have to think about. But the poster is right that they're better than what's out there for sure. So download the blank video (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5432881/Forbrydelsen_II) and add these subs."
,tumbler,2011-04-19T16:04Z,"thanks for your efforts, but unfortunately the subs are still incomprehensible, especially when they are discussing the politics.

I'll just have to wait until they show it on the BBC I guess"
,aajkd,2011-11-30T14:21Z,davidou's subs are better than these.
