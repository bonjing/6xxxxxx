ZOMBIECRAFT mod for minecraft. ON TORRENTS!
I DO NOT own this mod.
I got it when the links were working but now they are down. 
Just wanted to share this with you guys so you could use it.
Installation is self explanatory(and there are bunches of tuts out there)
If you want to use this with a cracked minecraft, rename zombiecraft.jar to minecraft.jar in the bin folder. N-Joy! Notice that this mod is very bugged so if it doesn't work, dont blame me.
