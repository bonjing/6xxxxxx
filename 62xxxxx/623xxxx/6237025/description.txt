Birdy the Mighty Decode 1
Federation investigator Birdy chases the space criminal Geega through space
to Earth, where he hides in the entertainment industry under a human disguise.
Birdy goes undercover herself, posing as famous model â€œArita Shionâ€ that often
uses a â€˜space girlâ€™ look. A male student, Senkawa, stumbles upon a fight be-
tween the two one night in an abandoned building only to be severed in half as
he is used as a shield by Geega against Birdy. Birdy heals him from imminent
death in some fashion- but Senkawas body, and life, are now changed and
permanently linked to Birdy.

Birdy the Mighty Decode 2
Birdy and Tsutomu are still co-existing in the same body, as Birdy continues her
duties as Federation Investigator and celebrity persona, and Tsutomu seeks to
balance them with his normal everyday life. When a criminal group connected to
the Ryunka incident escape from custody, hiding themselves and their alien
identities on Earth, Birdy and Tsutomu are thrown back into action. It seems,
however, that there are other forces involved, as well as old faces, which give
Birdy time to reflect on the past, and the people that influenced her.
