,c0ldsteal,2011-04-02T21:52Z,"Thanks for the upload! DVD torrents of this series are scarce, and your upload includes the English Dub. The uploader's info is unclear, but I can confirm that Episode 26 (included) is indeed the Cipher OVA.

V 7/10
A 10/10


For the tiny file size per episode, this is excellent quality, but I'd rather it was perfect quality even if larger. Netflix has Birdy available to ""Watch Instantly"" with higher quality, but its nice to be able to save this in my collection. "
