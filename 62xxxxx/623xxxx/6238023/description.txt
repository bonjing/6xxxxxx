DIVX DVD RIP ENGLISH VER NO SUBS

Mothra, a giant -- you guessed it -- moth, was a heroic force with its own movie series, and this film pits the flying 
insect against our scaly friend with killer halitosis. Featuring kitschy effects (the fairy twins who talk to Mothra have 
even been parodied on "South Park"), Godzilla vs. Mothra was directed by IshirÃ´ Honda, making it one of the series' standouts.
