RDimH presents - Generation Jihad, 1st March 2010.

In the second part of this series, Peter Taylor investigates how young Muslims radicalised over the internet formed themselves into a terror network that spread across three continents. Aided and abetted by two young fanatics in Britain, these cells plotted major attacks in Europe and America - culminating in a plan to explode three enormous truck bombs which, it was claimed, would dwarf the London bombings of 7/7.
