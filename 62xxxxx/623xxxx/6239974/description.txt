Russ was on cloud nine, living up senior year at college and enjoying his dream of having his own television show when it happened: GRADUATION! Broke, and suddenly with no job or plan, Russ finds himself living back home in his small town with his degenerate friends. The only solace Russ discovers is in chasing after Tara, his old high school crush. Russ, with no help from his friends, struggles to find his place in life.
