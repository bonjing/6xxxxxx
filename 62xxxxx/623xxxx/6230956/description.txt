SteerMouse supports USB and Bluetooth mice. It will even work with mice designed for Windows PCs. You can customize your mouse freely even if there is no Macintosh's driver.

Adjusting the cursor's Tracking Speed and Sensitivity.

Apple's driver only allows adjustment for the Tracking Speed. SteerMouse lets you control the Sensitivity on top of that. Adjusting both configurations makes it easier to find the ideal setting to fit the movements of your hand.
Apple Mouse becomes more useful.

SteerMouse has convenient and unique functions that are not included in Apple's mouse driver. With SteerMouse you can get the best use out of Apple Mouse. SteerMouse also supports the wirelessÂ MightyÂ Mouse.

  movement, which moves the cursor to the dialog box's default button, etc...

* You can customize the scroll ball.

* You can adjust the cursor's speed and acceleration. (Apple's driver allows you to
  adjust only the cursor's acceleration)

* You can customize Mighty Mouse in each application.

SteerMouse moves the cursor automatically.

When a window or dialog box is activated, SteerMouse automatically moves the cursor to a specified location on the screen: the default button, the cancel button, the close button, etc... And thanks to the cursor's animated movement you never lose sight of its position.

SteerMouse supports the Tilt Wheel.

You can assign horizontal scrolling, a vertical scrolling or shortcut keys. In addition, you can adjust the scrolling speed and acceleration.
SteerMouse supports up to 16 buttons.
