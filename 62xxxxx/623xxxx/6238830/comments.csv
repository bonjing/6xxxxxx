I riped a movie today, it took 5 hours for ripping and finally when i uploaded, i got an error

Error Name : Could not connect to remote server.

I faced the same problem few months ago and it kept me offline for a while.

From 31st December 2010 to February 5th 2011 i had the same issue, I was able to do every thing except uploading.

Only difference is that it was TPB at that time, and now its aha-share & ET which is giving me the same error.

Not only me, there are more people who had the same problem.
