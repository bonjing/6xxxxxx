p.s. i'm running windows 7 32 bit. tnx"
,shady000,2011-05-01T11:41Z,"okay, so i found the golden pen games folder in my drive d,opened it and found the folder named ""gta san andreas extreme edition 2011"", opened the folder, and the contents are:
- GData.7z
- Golden_Pen.exe
- icon
- SData1.7z
- SData2.7z
- Setup
now what am i supposed to do with these???"
,fc322,2011-05-01T20:28Z,"It worked fine for me on XP -32 bit

Here are the instructions:

1) First unzip with 7-zip (free program)

2) Mount the iso with PowerISO (free trial program)

3) Inside the iso go into the folder called AutoRunSource and run the GTA San Andreas - Extreme Edition 2011.part1.exe

4) Change the directory path that says D:\something\something to the path where you
   want the game installed.  On my PC it is c:\games\

5) After install is successfull (leave the iso mounted) and double click the icon on your desktop.
   The path should be c:\games\sa_launcher.exe"
,the67bug,2011-05-02T00:25Z,"ok so all downloaded and installed . compatibility ive played around with all settings (im using 32 bit windows 7 on a dedent spec machine) but i sttill cant get it to play i also tryed a few differnt locations for the directory, as soon as your logo shows up and then the spray can makes noise the programe gets a black screen an audio stopps and programe crashs instantly  ...windows troubleshhoter says APP CRASH .

,shady000,2011-05-02T09:23Z,"yup, runs great. only problem encountered is that there's no sound during the cutscene. or is that normal? :/"

Please fix."
,john depp,2011-05-06T03:13Z,Win 7 - 64bit here.  I got same no dialog sound problem.  Also there are absolutely no cut scene sound.  I googled it and I saw some solutions but none worked so far.  Frustrating.
,SJCarline,2011-05-10T03:17Z,Win7 x64 Absolutely no issues exept radio but thats not an issue...just put some music in the user music folder....does anyone know if something like this has been made for gta4? That would be awesome.
,dewy421,2011-05-10T15:06Z,does this work on windows 7 64 bit

,will93,2011-05-19T19:32Z,does it freeze on the big smoke mission - strictly buisness for anyone else?
,Oxade,2011-05-25T16:19Z,"@will93 - Yeah, I have the same problem, if you're talking about the part where they jump on the bike. In my case the game is still kinda running, birds are flying by and everything, it's just that the camera doesn't follow. 

When I minimize the game and click on it again, I'm in the menu and everything's working, so it's not frozen.

You using cheats? My best guess would be that it has something to do with them, since not everybody seems to have the problem. If I find something, I'll let ya know.

Oh yeah, I also have the problem tsitsa01 has. Don't know why it's happening, but I use the Teleporter prog, it's in the crazy trainer in the launcher menu. Just make sure you save any location before you die, then you can teleport there if you start falling. 

Cheers"

,soulies21,2011-09-01T14:00Z,"i can see alot of people are having trouble installing the mod of this game

first of all you do have to have the original game installed before you install this other wise it does defeat the purpose of the mod 

when you have the original game installed already extract the mod into the original gta folder and the cmd window will open if you do the extraction right and you will see everything being extracted properly but if thats not enough info for you peeps then lemme know ill make some directions for ya"
