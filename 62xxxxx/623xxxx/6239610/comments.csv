,samoerai3000,2011-03-13T20:08Z,"@gansuk, mate thanks for the upload. does this one save correctly? I got the save/load issue on the other releases."
,K3R,2011-03-14T01:44Z,"@samoerai3000, that issue is a crack issue involving single-core processors. Once a cracked version of 1.01 is released you'll be able to save correctly. Just download the crack when it comes out and replace the one you're currently using. A lot of people are waiting for it, including myself."
,samoerai3000,2011-03-14T03:28Z,"@K3R, thank you kindly for the reply. I'll wait for the cracked 1.01 then. cheers"

Once it gets to the intro video, my game crashes, every time when it get's to the darkspawn attacking the castle. I was wondering if it wasn't maybe something I was doing wrong, or if my computer just hates me."
