,indaloman2002,2011-04-28T20:25Z,"Brilliant, my PC died, had to reinstall and have lost 11 years of research. Was on Legacy who did not want to know about reinstall, so that was 30 quid up the shute. No one should have any problems downloading this. Thanks Oglecowboy for the patch as well"

,indaloman2002,2011-05-05T18:32Z,"This downloaded like a deam. BUT the prog itself is very inflexable, you cannot for example change birth to baptism otherwise its ok, I much prefer Millenium's Legacy 7, a great prog."
,indaloman2002,2011-05-05T18:37Z,"Now tried out, very inflexable cannot change say birth to baptism, quite important really if you want to be accurate"
