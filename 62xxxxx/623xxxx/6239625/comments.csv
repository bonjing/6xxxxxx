,Frosty-Snow,2011-05-02T03:26Z,@harjaap1234567  u install (autorun) after mount then u move the crack content from the mount over to the Installed file. Works like a charm
,MasterLane23,2011-05-11T14:12Z,"@Deezy6586

I had the exact same problem but make sure you copy across the rld.dll when you copy across the .exe file from the crack folder otherwise it just is trying to load something from the .dll file but can't find it unless you take it across."
,dolcichw,2011-05-16T07:37Z,great upload... only trouble im having is that i have no audio during game... any ideas?

,mikeakanice,2011-05-20T21:44Z,The torrent only came with two files. The Rld and the reloaded file which isn't really anything. I'm missing the crack. 
,mikeakanice,2011-05-20T21:45Z,"Can anyone explain to me what you did to make it work.  In like "" a dummy version"" Because I really don't understand what's going on unless i am missing files with the downloaded torrent."
,nastynacho,2011-05-21T05:30Z," @mikeakanice,

2. Burn or mount the image.
 3. Install the game.
 4. Copy over the cracked content from the Crack dir on the DVD to your
    install dir.
 5. Play the game.

,Kooh,2011-05-21T11:38Z,"For those who want to play the lastest version (1.1) just dwl the mini image from gamecopyworld, it work even with the game patched. Just make sure you have advanced emulation turned ON in deamon tool."

,Kooh,2011-05-24T02:36Z,"@nastynacho

Do you have the latest version of DT lite ? And when you check advanced emulation you have to check securom also. Work just fine for me with 1.1 ^^"

Tried with Securom Checked under Advanced

but it didn't work............ strange? "

how exactly do i do that. what i did was mounted the image, installed the game, unzipped the crack, then copied the crack into the c drive....then that pops up when i play it. did i skip a step or something?"
,nialllos29,2011-05-26T13:55Z,never mind. got it working

Sorry to be another one asking but i'm a bit of a noob and need assistance! Managed to mount the image and the game opens n stuff but when i click to play a game the screen goes blank, can still hear the sounds tho.
