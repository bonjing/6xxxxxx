(next time, can you put the bit rate and the fps a little higher [1000 & 29] ? TIA)"

Peace bro, keep up the good work ;)"
,Archonin,2011-06-05T04:09Z,"Great upload ^^
For you ppl asking for English dubs ...
It's a dual-audio. It's already in English. It even says so in the description.
Though, I can't understand why anyone would want to watch it in English, unless you can't read of course.
The stupid dub'ing ruins the entire show.
Now, for what matter :
Great upload ^^ Impossible to get a hold on over here. Of course watching in Japanese with subs ;)"
,Tha1Heat,2011-06-09T00:42Z,Really Really Amazing!! NiCE one!!
,FreelancerZENA,2011-06-23T13:22Z,"I used VLC to change to english dubs. However, when I do, the audio is dysynchronized. I don't know if its the same with the Jap dubs. can I get some help? How do I fix this?"
,Philippine1,2011-07-16T03:25Z,some of the episode in english audio are dysynchronized in jap audio they are all synchronized. What happened?
,ajhalo,2011-08-29T16:13Z,so its eng subbed right? Archonin
,tribeswarrior,2011-09-05T02:32Z,"damn. do you people even read the other comments before asking a question?
its available in English dub, or Japanese audio with English subs.
you probably wont get answers about dub problems because barely anyone prefers them. you lose tons of plot info and the voice actors suck."
,EmoEmoEmo,2011-09-24T22:51Z,Thanks +1
,iRodney,2011-10-23T17:34Z,"This is a great upload. Thanks themanuel.
It is what the title and description says it is. :)"
,Core101,2011-12-09T22:53Z,"For this anime i prefer the dub , loads of them are desynchronized , if you want the audio to be fixed convert it to 29.87 fps and the bit rate to 1000 , that should be fine for most of them , thanks for the share"
,H_Mist,2012-01-31T06:48Z,"already have this anime, so didn't dload. Just wanted to say that the dub for this anime is actually very good. "
,bikers123,2012-03-13T17:21Z,"Thanks man!!
The quality is superb and it's small in size. Audio works fine except in some episodes it is desynchronised , don't worry you can easily sync them with vlc.
Everything else is great. Keep up the good work. Two thumbs up!!!"
,bikers123,2012-03-13T17:24Z,"@all
It's dual audio.
In vlc : Go to - Audio>Audio track>Select the audio(Japanese or English).
Don't ever disrespect an uploader because you don't know something.
Btw, the English dub for this anime is great!!!"
