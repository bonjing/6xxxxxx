Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R1 & R2 (Dual-Audio)
[1280x720 BDRip] Vintage 2006


Code Geass R1:
The Empire of Britannia has invaded Japan using giant robot weapons
called Knightmare Frames. Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its
people the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch,
vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia. Years later,
Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess
and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's who've stolen
a military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force sent
after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for
disobeying orders, while the military secret, a young girl, gives Lelouch the
power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is
secretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare,
Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion
to destroy Britannia once and for all.

Code Geass R2:
It's been one year since the failure of the Black Rebellion and the
supposed death of Zero. Britannia has assigned Area 11 a "correctional
education" status, where Elevens are made an example of by brute force,
to try to prevent any future uprisings and suppress rebellious thoughts.
Unsuspecting high school student Lelouch, oblivious to his rebellious
past as Zero, stumbles upon a scheme on his life and the life of a
mysterious woman known as C.C., who reveals to him his forgotten
purpose and his "true" self. Destroying his assailants and declaring
himself Zero once again, Lelouch sets out to finish what he started.

Most of my uploads are encoded / compressed to their smallest possible
file size. The quality IMO is still pretty decent though for the filesizes. But,
those of you who have a higher res monitor, may notice a drop in quality,
if this bothers you, then look elsewhere... I will not bend on my methods.
Thank you to those that enjoy my torrents.., I enjoy sharing them with you.
Feel free to pm me if you're looking for something, or have a question???

MKV on X-Box 360 & PS-3
The best media server I have used is "PS3 Media Server", which
despite the name apparently works with the 360 as well. It's super
simple to install and much less bloated than any of the other
options that I've tried. (like Tversity, Orb, Mediahome)

Or if you prefer to convert the files for direct download
onto your machine you can use mkv2vob.



Due to the high volume of requests I recieve. Please only pm me if you have a
question or request. All "thank you's" should be left in the comment section.
