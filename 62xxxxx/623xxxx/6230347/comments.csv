,425paul,2011-03-09T16:28Z,Windows 7 has moved the hosts file to a different location where it is harder to find. And you need to replace ALL of the amtlib.dlls with the cracked versions; there are more than just the 3 listed here.
,tt4under,2011-03-09T17:04Z,windows 7 did not move the hosts file location... it's in the same place: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
,tt4under,2011-03-09T17:06Z,"Yes, i forgot to mention: The patch works almost with any Adobe CS5 product.. just copy/replace the amtlib.dll file for every product location. Enjoy"

Also, once you find your hosts file, replacing the hosts file takes some work. You first have to change the security settings to allow you to modify it or replace it. "
