,Rockstar-1,2011-03-12T05:04Z,Ahhh Yeahhhhhh already!
,71460,2011-03-12T05:16Z,I'm downloading to see if my computer is good enough to run this game. Then I will buy. Thanks AiTB
[T],Beebe85,2011-03-12T05:37Z,Thanks
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-12T06:27Z,this isn't steam is it?
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-12T06:29Z,"@ 71460, why don't u just download the demo? its smaller."
,Rockstar-1,2011-03-12T07:44Z,"Canyourunit.com, bro"
,tmcmahon51,2011-03-12T09:16Z,"He's got a valid point. Most of the time, the full game runs smoother than what gets released as a demo."
,sharmila123,2011-03-12T09:33Z,"thx AiTB.. some one please confirm as sson as download gets over...Reloaded guys please release crack when game comes out 
Thx to all those of yoy who take the time and effort and risk.."
,IceDeathBoy,2011-03-12T11:27Z,this game is so worth buying...
,h3ll4b0y,2011-03-12T13:51Z,"clonedvd... means no crack?
cheers"
,sharmila123,2011-03-12T14:09Z,there are no seeders for this torrent.. those who have downloaded atleast seed for a 5-6 hours so that other can download too ... 
,haggisofdeath,2011-03-12T14:41Z,"Dont buy this game. Pirate it. 

I paid for the Empire Total War and NTW and its still broken.

They release DLC and expansions to milk more money before they fix games.

Also since Steam hijacked this series its been plagued with multiplayer connection issues so its not worth getting it for that either unless ur willing to buy a special modem and spend weeks trail and error testing to get it to work.

These devs dont deserve our money. They fuck us, We fuck them. Simple.

Oh and @ randir14...system requirements will be very different cos the demo has no high res textures and no anti aliasing. both very demanding on GPU and VRAM. 

Learn some baisic IT skills before commenting about things u dont understand."

,big_buka,2011-03-12T18:19Z,i hope that this is not a fake
,regentas,2011-03-12T18:38Z,@ haggisofdeath I have empire and NTW and it isnt as broken as you say and stop saying bullshit like dont buy if people like the game they should buy it and if developers are so worthless as you say why are you even playing theyre game go cry in the corner hater
,runwhen_useeme,2011-03-12T18:48Z,"I'm a little hesitant. Only 11GB, when wiki says it should be twice that"
,ascorius,2011-03-12T18:51Z,ETW and Empire was by no means broken. ETW had driverproblems and crashes for a vocal minority... not including me. Both games worked well from release. That being said I will personally buy this game as Creative Assembly is one of the few developers that make good PC exclusives... I don't want another dev to start creating consolized crap like Bioware did with DA2. CA will have my support :)
,sdebeli,2011-03-12T18:57Z,Would any of those who managed to download please seed? There's probably a thousand people stuck at roughly 57% because there are no seeders online.

,Chemical321,2011-03-12T21:36Z,"I pirated Rome: Total War, since I had no exposure to Total War prior to that game. Since then I have bought Rome:Total War, and purchased every Total War game on Day 1.

,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-12T22:40Z,"LOL, obviously people that play this type of game are stingy boring assholes, who wouldn't seed a torrent if you begged them, My suspicions were correct, you Total War gamers are a bunch of tight nasty assholes."
,ascorius,2011-03-12T23:33Z,"@devilishredbeardishness: Oh no, the guy thats downloading a TW game is insulting TW gamers. Contradictory much? And why the hell are you bitching about seeding... are you in a hurry to download a game that has no crack? Dumbass"
,majuaraan,2011-03-13T00:07Z,"@mrwrong, ok first off no there is no crack, and secondly we all know as much as your broke ass love the game, you would not have paid for it, you would just still download it or pay your internet bill or buy a game acctually worth 50 USD"
,SweatyGremlins,2011-03-13T00:54Z,"Played the original Shogun to death as a kid, i even have the old box in my cupboard (It does not work on new gfx though)

Medieval 2 was good but broken, i avoided ETW and NTW but can't ignore this one.

Hopefully they do justice to the original :)"

,RoughNeck205,2011-03-13T01:44Z,"Ive already preorderd limited edition of this game.  I fukign love total war series.  Been playing since the beginning.
The modding alone makes TW one of the best series on earth.  But each game starts off buggy and is patched within a month.
Usually u just work around the bugs.
Didn't see the note about no crack released yet that sux. Wanted a head start on my weekend before the work grind friken pulled my teeth out again."

,salmael,2011-03-13T13:00Z,"It is probably not a good idea to download it now. I think that on the 15th steam is going to upload some unlocking shit, like missing files or so. Only then the scene will be able to crack it, unless thereâ€™s been a leak from Dev. If not, you surly donâ€™t expect the scene to write those files on their own, do you?
By the way, I think the Devs have finally found a way to keep the game unpirated until the release date :)"

â€¢First you need to mount the mdx files using daemon tools.

â€¢Then run pheonix and at the top open instruments/Update ContentDescriptionRecord/Internet and wait for that to do its thing

â€¢Go to instruments again - SID Unpacker this time and hit 'Scan a SIM-file' then browse to where daemon tools mounted your mdx files (Computer/YourVirtualDriveHere) and choose the SIM 

â€¢Several gcf files appear on the lower list, you need to select the exe/data/redist/your language then hit unpack, choose your directory same as you would when installing a normal game (usually program files)

â€¢From here just let it unpack, it might seem like it stops but it's usually just the larger files being unpacked so be patient

â€¢It will ask you occasionally to pick a different sid to continue, just read which one it needs (disk one or disk two) and browse to those virtual drives to select the sid, just like when a normal game asks to insert disk 2

thats it, should unpack without a problem hope this helped"

@Syfilis 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢First you need to mount the mdx files using daemon tools.

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Then run pheonix and at the top open instruments/Update ContentDescriptionRecord/Internet and wait for that to do its thing

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Go to instruments again - SID Unpacker this time and hit 'Scan a SIM-file' then browse to where daemon tools mounted your mdx files (Computer/YourVirtualDriveHere) and choose the SIM 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Several gcf files appear on the lower list, you need to select the exe/data/redist/your language then hit unpack, choose your directory same as you would when installing a normal game (usually program files)

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢From here just let it unpack, it might seem like it stops but it's usually just the larger files being unpacked so be patient

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢It will ask you occasionally to pick a different sid to continue, just read which one it needs (disk one or disk two) and browse to those virtual drives to select the sid, just like when a normal game asks to insert disk 2

thats it, should unpack without a problem hope this helped

-I open phoenix 1.5, scan Sim file (disk 1)  and select the exe/data/redist/language then unpack;
- somewhere near 4.5 Gb it ''asks'' me for disk 2, so I mount disk2(with daemon tools just like before) and a couple of seconds after inserting it stops and I find that the folder where I unpacked the game is only 4.60 Gb big.
 I forgot to mention that when I mount the first disk the actual installation bar of the game starts and I can olny go as far as the steam verification code!

4)Click Scan a SIM File
5)Navigate to the disk you just mounted and click the SIM file (should be only one)

i'm not sure i understand your problem, the only time you need to get to disk 2 is after you scanned the sim from disk one, chose the exe/data/redist/language and started to unpack.

then when it tells you it needs the sid from disk 2 browse to disk 2 with the option it gives you, you will have to do this multiple times.

After that I simply applied the Chinese patch, which is available in torrent, also linked in these comments. 

If you still can't figure out how to do it, you're an idiot and you don't belong on a torrent site anyway. 

By the way, the game is absolutely stunning. Brilliant mix of style, art and functionality that was missing with Empire, in my opinion. "

I can confirm that the Chinese crack works 100%.
How to install:
1)In Pheonix, go to Instruments->Update Content Description Record->Internet
2)Mount the first disc with (preferably Daemon Tools)
3)Go to Instruments->SID Unpacker
4)Click Scan a SIM File
5)Navigate to the disk you just mounted and click the SIM file (should be only one)
6)Select the stuff on top and your language) and click unpack and choose where to install it
7)A white window with some text should pop up, let it do it's thing and eventually it will ask for the next disc
8)Mount the other disc and point it to the SIM file as you did with the first one
9)Download th Chinese crack at BakaBaka's link and run the program. It's kinda hard to understand since its in Chinese but just keep clicking the button second from the right (and make sure you point it to your installation directory)
10)ENJOY!!!

you cant load saves before this new patch but so far i don't have problems(20 turns ) will update if something change..."
,Piratapr,2011-03-16T14:41Z,"@Peyton76

worked with phoenix 1.4

Peyton76 instructions 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢First you need to mount the mdx files using daemon tools.

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Then run pheonix and at the top open instruments/Update ContentDescriptionRecord/Internet and wait for that to do its thing

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Go to instruments again - SID Unpacker this time and hit 'Scan a SIM-file' then browse to where daemon tools mounted your mdx files (Computer/YourVirtualDriveHere) and choose the SIM 

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Several gcf files appear on the lower list, you need to select the exe/data/redist/your language then hit unpack, choose your directory same as you would when installing a normal game (usually program files)

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢From here just let it unpack, it might seem like it stops but it's usually just the larger files being unpacked so be patient

Ã¢â‚¬Â¢It will ask you occasionally to pick a different sid to continue, just read which one it needs (disk one or disk two) and browse to those virtual drives to select the sid, just like when a normal game asks to insert disk 2

thats it, should unpack without a problem hope this helped    ( page 10)"

Then select SID Unpacker, scan a SIM file, and point it to the Daemon Tools drive with the mounted MDX file, and it should show up there. It will ask for the second SIM file later on - mount the second MDX file and press okay. Install the Chinese patch and crack, and you're away."

didnt tried those as im only interested in grand campaign. And also here its the biggest issue as its the longest part of the game.

IÂ´m seriously starting to think that this game wont be cracked, or at least cracked in a stable fashion. For now I guess im content with playing the tutorial and the historical battles, but I would aprecciate (as would we all) if someone from The Scene was able to work out either a working crack or a way around the stupid Save Game problem, since it seems to be the only issue with the Chinese crack version.

,DarkDemon135,2011-03-17T18:00Z,"Well if you reaaaaalyy want to play the game with the chinese crack - there is a temporary solution that might work. Might! Haven't tried it myself..soo..
You can either manually alt+tab and backup save games every X turns, so if the game crashes it - you'll have a backup.
Or you can run a .bat file on the background:

@echo off
set time=300
mkdir backup1
mkdir backup2
:loop
Echo Backuping save folder...
xcopy /q /y save_games backup1
Echo Waiting for %time% seconds...
ping 127.0.0.1 -n %time% >nul 
xcopy /q /y save_games backup2
Echo Waiting for %time% seconds...
ping 127.0.0.1 -n %time% >nul 
goto loop
pause

Put the .bat file file here: C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\The Creative Assembly\Shogun2 
It will create two copies of the ""save_games"" folder after the number of seconds, specified in ""Time"" variable. 
BUT! Remember, that if the game crashes, you have to close cmd.exe window with the .bat file!! Otherwise it will rewrite backuped save_folder with a coruppted one. "

Make sure you have DirectX and C++ installed.
You can find these in recources->redist on the first disc."
,ZackAttak,2011-03-17T20:59Z,"OK EVERYONE- I'm going to post these step-by-step instructions for the LAST TIME. DO NOT ask questions on how to install until you read this thoroughly, step-by-step
You will need:
a)""Phoenix"" to install the game:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5161938/Phoenix_1.2_(for_installing_Modern_Warfare_2_Steam_Version)
b)The Chinese crack:
http://u.115.com/file/f3f1e3e7c5
c)Daemon tools Lite:
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite
---OKAY, NOW TIME TO INSTALL---
Step 1)Mount both discs with Daemon Tools, you may need to add another drive (right click the DTools icon, go to Virtual Devices-->ADD Virtual drive)
Step 2)Run Phoenix, go to Instuments-->UpdateContentDescriptionRecord-->Internet
Step 3)go to Instruments-->SID Unpacker
Step 4)Press scan a SIM file and point it to Disc 1 (the first one you mounted)
Step 5)Select the stuff at the top and your language
Step 6)Click unpack and show it where you want to install
Step 7)When it asks for the next SIM file from Disc 2, point it to disc 2 like you did with disc 1 (when it asks for the next SIM file, it's also on disc 2)
Step 8)Run the Chinese crack. Just keep clicking the middle right button, but make sure you tell it where you installed the game
Step 9)Make sure you have the redistributables installed, (DirectX, C++) they can be found in Resources-->Redist on disc 1
If you have any problems PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD READTHIS AGAIN OR READ OTHER COMMENTS, 30+pages of people asking the same questions is ridiculous. 
And there IS NO CD KEY so stop asking.
Thank You..."

all this rubbish about saving game multiple times etc isnt going to work.

This issue only occours with people who have cracked the game, if you look on the official forums in the support section there is almost no mention of this. 

either the crack is nuked or most likely the developers have put some kind of failsafe into the game so once it has detected the game is cracked it stops all future saves from working.

2 options

buy the game(wouldnt advise this after the state of empire when it game out)
wait for a scene release(which might not ever come) and then buy the game if you think they deserve your money. "

But when I click on ""continue campaign"" which loads my quicksave, I don't crash any more. I did this multiple times and it seems to work, for me.

Second theory is that in the first few turns, I moved all my units around, but having units bunkered in cities does NOT corrupt save files.

I am somewhat certain that your save game does get corrupted. Or it's the failsafe feature embedded in the game. And obviously Chinese shit isn't good enough."

11. then go to the crack ali213.net-11gpatch158

Yes that did help, thank you for taking the time to type it out that way. I had not known of the phoenix program to bypass steam. I am currently using it as you said, though it's been going for a few minutes now and hasn't asked for Disk 2. It seems to be taking a while on the .pack files, but I'm assuming that is because of the size of the game.

Maybe if the uploader had enough sense to put the instructions in the information box you wouldn't have 30 pages of comments with 40% asking how to get it working. Just saying. Sorry your life is so shitty you have to come on things like this and rage comment just to make yourself feel better."

@Arcueid that is fucking hilarious, i haven't been able to reach to the point where that event is triggered but that is fucking comedy that the CA implemented a event that recognizes you don't have a legit copy & the games become harder & towns become unhappy.

,dontpKaniC,2011-03-19T14:59Z,"come on people if you want the damn game than buy it!!!!
and theres a couple of reasons for that:
1. you get the multiplayer
2. you wont have to wait for an unknown period of time for the crack (besides there is no guarantee there will be a crack)
3. you wont have to wait for a crack each time an update is made
4. you will support the game makers (although there aint much to support)

so quit yapping and go buy it!!!!!!!!

also quit asking those noob questions about how to mount an image download or install a game. there are other forums where you can find the answers. besides all of these questions were answered before, so prior to asking how to install the game read the previous comments!!! (although since there is so much of them it could take some time... but then there wouldnt be so much if you noobs werent asking the same damn questions 10 times!!!!!!!!! Its a goddamn cirlce)"

just pirating it out of curiosity and because i'm a bit bored"
,Piratapr,2011-03-19T16:08Z,"@dontpkanic why u here if u buy games, get out of the torrent sites then. Go troll official sites."
,digital43,2011-03-19T16:29Z,"im pretty sure no one is really coming up with crack at this point. Even if the crack comes out, it will be obsolete since CA said there will b lots of patches. Also, the issue with the save files could be CA's antipiracy countermeasure for piracy, since as far as i know, ive never seen a crack (even the ones that are not perfect) that causes save file to not work. Anyway, the conclusion that I drew is that buy the game. I bought it for $39 at newegg. they are doing $10 off promo until 3/21. I really do think that this game has a lot of replay value so i dont think its waste of money"
,Hokrollo,2011-03-19T16:41Z,Anyone could give a tip how to install this? Because I don't see any other ways to install it others than the Steam installer (which needs serial). So you guys done it - please tell how.

,dontpKaniC,2011-03-19T17:08Z,"@ Piratapr i didnt buy it. at least not yet so im just like you guys waiting... and i didnt buy it simply because, although i pretty much like total war games, i dont like them enough to be willing to pay for them. my message was directed at people who were waiting for them for a long time and cant wait to play. although i admit i would want to play it too i can wait. after all im not the one posting WHERE IS THE CRACK and I CANT WAIT NO MORE  messages right?..."

Im having trubbles with step 5 there is nothing for me to select in phoenix and every time I press unpack it says select something I have mounted both discs and selected the sim file in disc one and scanned it but now what?


read this thoroughly, step-by-step
You will need:
a)""Phoenix"" to install the game:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5161938/Phoenix_1.2_(for_installing_Modern_Warfare_2_Steam_Version)
b)The Chinese crack:
http://u.115.com/file/f3f1e3e7c5
c)Daemon tools Lite:
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite
---OKAY, NOW TIME TO INSTALL---
Step 1)Mount both discs with Daemon Tools, you may need to add another drive (right click the DTools icon, go to Virtual Devices-->ADD Virtual drive)
Step 2)Run Phoenix, go to Instuments-->UpdateContentDescriptionRecord-->Internet
Step 3)go to Instruments-->SID Unpacker
Step 4)Press scan a SIM file and point it to Disc 1 (the first one you mounted)
Step 5)Select the stuff at the top and your language
Step 6)Click unpack and show it where you want to install
Step 7)When it asks for the next SIM file from Disc 2, point it to disc 2 like you did with disc 1 (when it asks for the next SIM file, it's also on disc 2)
Step 8)Run the Chinese crack. Just keep clicking the middle right button, but make sure you tell it where you installed the game
Step 9)Make sure you have the redistributables installed, (DirectX, C++) they can be found in Resources-->Redist on disc 1
If you have any problems PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD READTHIS AGAIN OR READ OTHER COMMENTS, 30+pages of people asking the same questions is ridiculous. 
And there IS NO CD KEY so stop asking.
Thank You...

,acetatte,2011-03-19T20:10Z,"ok for both patches it is the same button: The big one on the left.

The first patch will prompt an installation wizard and you must manually select your installation DIR as it only assumes where you installed it.

Second patch: you will see an auto updater for a split second and then prompt a box with a yes or no which will launch the game and it is perfectly normal. As long as there is no error it was patched successfully and the game will work. 

***Also you MUST start a new campaign , no exceptions. the old saves even with all your troops outside will still carry the bug as i've tested. 

The only thing I am not aware of this patch is if the 50 turn thing bug is fixed or not, hopefully someone can tell us here as I have no time to play it ATM"

I am now on turn 58, Chosokabe Clan, have saved and loaded multiple times and have not received a single ""youÂ´re a pirate"" message after turn 50. 

This is how:

- DL cloneDVD version. (11.87gb on TPB)

- Daemon Tools Lite (important - Lite version recognizes .mdx type files, that constitute CLONEDVD version.

- Phoenix 1.4 Beta 7

- Uptade [contentsdescription} on the program on the Instruments TAB.

- Unload all contants on SIM file except languages with dont want. (or all just to make sure)

- Point to CD2 on Daemon when required.

- DL 1st chinese crack from ali231 (200Â´s mb i think) into the folder created with Phoenix

- DL crack V1 (7 mb) and extract into the same folder. Run the Crack on middle button, DONT RUN GAME YET on the right button.

- DL crack v2 and extract in the same folder as always (9 mb I think? no matter, search in TPB). Run. After running crack on the middle button, run the game on the right button. Game will work from normal .exe or shortcut from there.

For all of those who had graphic or Steam related problems, sry not being able to help, I had none to begin with, just savegame and turn 50 messages that were resolved with V1 and V2 of ali crack."

1. Download this torrent
2. Google ""Phoenix 1.4"" and download
3. Launch Phoenix and click the Instruments Tab and update the ""CDR"" by using the internet
4.Using Daemon Tools lite, mount the first mdx image.
5.After updating the CDR in Phoenix, click on the instruments tab and click on SIM unpacker. 
6.Then select ""Scan a SIM-file"" on the bottom and locate your mounted image.
7.Once selected, you must click on the title of the game (Shogun 2) under ""AVAILABLE GAMES (click on them)""
8. After, select ""unpack"" on the bottom. (Make sure to make a folder to which your extracting to.
9.As the Phoenix unpacks, it will ask for the first disk and the second. When this happens simply go to your Daemon tools and unmount your current image and mount the disk Phoneix asks for.
10. Once done unpacking, Download this crack,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6258022/Total_War_SHOGUN_2_UPDATE_CRACK-FLT_DiBYA and apply it to your extracted folder.

I had the same problem, don't update your video card driver but DOWNGRADE it. I have an ati and I had to downgrade to 10.11 to get it working. It also fixes the range arch problem.
