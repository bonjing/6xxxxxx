Snakes & Arrows Live is a double CD Rush recorded at two performances at the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam, Netherlands on October 16 and 17, 2007. On the DVD several songs recorded in Atlanta, GA on July 22, 2008 that were not included in the main set are available as bonus tracks. This is because later in the tour the setlist was altered somewhat, replacing four songs. This release contains all of the tracks from both setlists combined together in their correct placement to give the listener a full on Rush show that no one heard in this form at any of the shows. Due to the editing/removal of the video intros to several songs on the CD version, this is all taken from the DVD audio. Its in stereo 16/44.1 so you can all play it on your CD players.
