,skreemer,2011-03-31T08:56Z,"thanks, mirrormaster82.

this comic is getting worse and worse.

iÂ´ve already deleted the previous 80 issues and will stop seeding this one right now.

a mexican soap opera is better than this cheap drama story.

it seems all the energy of the writer has gone to the tv series, so good luck on that and please stop harassing us with these comics."
