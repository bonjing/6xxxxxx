Anyone got the strategy guide?
Downloaded the free sample and looks so much better than the one for dragon age origins."

It's a periodic problem with TPB. Click on the magnet link and it should work. Also, you could find this torrent on t o r r e n t z(.)c o m and dl from one of their many links.

It is neither fake nor virus."
