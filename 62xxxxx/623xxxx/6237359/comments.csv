But what's a Bitrate ? 

If it affects the speed of the download, no one else seems to be too worried.

If it affects the quality of the music, you just need to remember that most of these tracks were recorded on vinyl, over 30 years ago, and were not intended to be played on CD or DVD quality players, so a couple of scratches and crackles add to the authenticity !!

Sorry to disappoint."
