         While everyone else is busting their butts in the gym,        
         one of the contestants becomes the focus of Jennifer's        
         wrath for being lazy. The couples go to Jamaica's Cakes       
         in Los Angeles to sample and select wedding cakes, but        
         not everyone will take a taste. The winners of this week's    
         wedding challenge walk off with their dream wedding cake,     
         while the losers earn a major penalty that could cost them    
         the entire competition. Two couples face off in a physical    
          endurance challenge that will send one couple home.
