,trashe555,2011-03-12T14:09Z,RAR? I'll bet that this torrent is bulls*t. Am I right?

- Go complain somewhere else, this torrent is a .rar because of the movie + my new ""Publishers Notes"" (when you click on it, it opens and tells you who made the torrent and other info about me"
,LostEpilogue,2011-03-14T05:01Z,"720p HD and less than 700MB? Yeah... when you make a fake, make sure you know what you are doing."
,frant1k,2011-03-14T05:02Z,"Any word on quality? 720p at this filesize is dubious at best, unless the bitrates are next to nothing, defeating the purpose of the extra resolution."
,kamuraowns,2011-03-14T14:53Z,"720p = 1280 × 720 not 608 × 336... and I don't know what is the .exe, I use Mac, so be careful"
,FatFreddy22,2011-03-14T22:32Z,"@torrenters
-THIS IS 720p HD as long as you don't have your desktop resolution really high, so when you full-screen the movie, it gets pixel, anyways, if you don't trust this torrent, not my problem go buy the movie."
,Fritzhacks,2011-03-16T19:13Z,"The actually Movie is in the rar folder but there is also a .exe most likely a Bot. so its safe to torrent this just do open the dont .exe its probably a Bot, virus, or Rat"
