Downloaded Massive 1.0.1... installed fine worked great, but i've got some ksd files that can only be played in the up most up to date version of massive, so ...

I Downloaded the update to 1.5 everything looked good, no errors or anything until i try to load the ksd files, error message of the top of my memory is ""cannot read file"" or ""cannot open file""... please help, been trying to do google this for the last 2 days! read the manual and everything :)

,thedman85,2011-07-01T14:01Z,"@DJ-eMiiX unless i'm not understanding, this is an update. You already have massive installed yeah? Don't mean to state the obvious :) I have version 1.4, need this to update so i can use a few new sound files i found online"
,De_W_eY,2011-07-07T09:45Z,"I got the same "" no previous version installed "" message.  I think this probably is just an update."
,m477yp4rk3r,2011-07-09T23:40Z,"works perfectly for me (Ableton v8) awesome upload thanks!! if ur having problems, download one of the FULL versions off pirate bay (any will do) then run the setup included in the release"
,darionPD894,2011-07-17T06:36Z,"i downloaded it, have an existing massive 1.4 i believe, am quite new so this could be a simple fix but when i go to extract a specific file with winrar it says i need to have the following volume. i found a way around it and click on the first file, extracted it with keep broken files, and when i ran it it said it was corrupt. i would really appreciate help as i purchased some presets not knowing they were for a new update."
,AyminnrDj,2011-07-28T20:50Z,"Its an update to version 1.1.,5 but it crashes every few minutes. so you can better keep your older version."
,Disarmonia47,2011-08-01T06:39Z,Having the exact same problem as darionPD894
,EdmAddict,2011-08-02T11:46Z,Thank you and thank you Team Air. 
,Mattheli23,2011-08-15T02:27Z,"I've got the same problem as Christomania. i downloaded this so i could use some presets i downloaded. If i open up the program on its own, they work fine, but when i try and open it in cubase 5 it is still version 1.1.4, i had a look in the stienberg/vstplugins folder and the dll file for massive is for 1.1.4

is there something i need to do to get the 1.1.5 dll files to make it work in cubase?"
,erikh3213,2011-08-25T04:32Z,How to I install this. Please help.

,mavamaarten,2011-11-27T19:26Z,THANKS! All other massive downloads errored when I opened some files. This one works fine.
,NickyXplosion,2012-02-11T12:31Z,"Works fine until Native Instrument put a glitch in it.

Delete the file and massive will reload the database perserving still preserving your sounds"
,AnonKoran,2012-02-16T00:46Z,"HOW TO INSTALL: (or how I did it)

1. Go to the website, download the TRIAL.
2. Install the Trial...
3. Browse to C -> VSTPlugins
4. Delete Massive.dll
5. Run Massive Update 1.5
6. While installing see the VST Plugins on the confermation screen? Click that shit. Click install full or something.

(IF USING FRUITY LOOPS)
7. COPY from C -> VSTPlugin -> Massive.dll
8. PASTE in C -> Image Line -> Fruity -> Plugins
9. ?????
10. Profit."
,eji253,2012-03-06T22:13Z,so i unzip the massive 1.1.5 file then i get a list of files and another zipped file called a-nm115.rar and when i go to unzip it i get a message saying please insert disk but there's no iso files or anything..someone please help
,eji253,2012-03-06T23:27Z,now its just saying that the massive setup file is broken when i try and run it
,Reaper513,2012-03-24T16:18Z,Man i just figured out that YOU HAVE TO HAVE 1.14 FOR THIS TO WORK NOT 1.13 Thats what it means by no version installed.
,phantomxjohn,2012-04-18T09:00Z,"sorry i never checked up on this torrent

you must have update 1.3 and 1.4
before you install 1.5

and it works fine"
,phantomxjohn,2012-04-18T09:16Z,"i installed massive to check if everything is good

total installation couldn't be easier:

1. install massive  1.3
2. install massive  1.4 UPDATE
3. install massive  1.5 UPDATE

there is NO: cracking, no glitches, no problems

thanks everyone who put in the effort to seed
and keeping this torrent alive"
