For their major-label debut, Omar & the Howlers were trimmed down to a trio, but that didn't decrease their power. If anything, the group sounds leaner and meaner. Hard Times in the Land of Plenty is one of their finest releases for this reason. It's a rough and tumble collection that is driven as much by fine original songwriting as it is by the band's edgy sound.
