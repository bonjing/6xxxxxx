During her career Ella recorded four television shows for the BBC: 'Ella Swings' and 'Ella Sings' in 1965, 'Live from Ronnie Scott's' in 1974 and 'Live from Montreux' in 1977. The four shows have now been released on DVD as 'From The BBC Vaults', with superb vision and sound remastering, and on this CD as a 'Best Of' the first three shows. The BBC don't have the rights to issue tracks from the Montreux show. 

I also have the DVD which I'll upload at a later date.
