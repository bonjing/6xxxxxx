         Ever since the earliest missionaries and explorers            
         returned from Africa, stories have been told of strange       
         water-dwelling monsters living in the Congo Basin. The        
         native Pygmy tribes speak of the Mokele-mbembe, an animal     
         with a long, thin neck and a body the size of an elephant     
         that seems to resemble a sauropod dinosaur. Could there       
          be a population of dinosaurs living in the remote jungle?
