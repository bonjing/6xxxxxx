By 1964 the United States had been "invaded" by a number of British bands, led by the Beatles. The Rolling Stones were seen as more rebellious and rowdy than The Beatlesâ€”they were the "bad boys" as opposed to the "good boys"â€”and this reputation only served to enhance their popularity with their teenage fans. The Stones far outlasted the Beatles and all the other 60s-era British bands, however The Rolling Stones not only continued, but flourished, their tours drawing enormous crowds for decades. 

The Rolling Stones: A Musical Biography chronicles the fascinating adventures of these Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees and sheds light on what has allowed these music legends to enjoy such lifelong popularity and success.
