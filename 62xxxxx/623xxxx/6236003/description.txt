As requested by Jaminbenb, here is Kansas' Two For The Show resequenced as if it were a real concert and not a live album with bonus tracks added later.

This was a bit of trouble to figure out a good sequence, because it was recorded on two different tours which had greatly differing setlists. I based my tracklist on four setlists from 1977 and 1978 shows, trying to get the songs grouped together in the same order as on the lists. A lot of artistic freedom was taken in this, but I think I got it to sound like a real show would.

The tracklist is as follows:

01 Hopelessly Human
02 Song For America
03 Point Of Know Return
04 Paradox
05 Icarus (Born On Wings Of Steel)
06 Down The Road
07 Belexes
08 Closet Chronicles
09 Mysteries & Mayhem
10 Excerpt From Lamplight Symphony
11 The Wall
12 Lonely Street
13 Dust In The Wind-Acoustic Guitar solo
14 Lonely Wind-Piano solo
15 Cheyenne Anthem
16 Miracles Out Of Nowhere
17 Child Of Innocence
18 The Spider
19 Portrait (He Knows)
20 Carry On Wayward Son
21 Journey From Mariabronn
22 Sparks Of The Tempest
23 Magnum Opus
24 Bringing It Back


Below are the setlists I used as reference. You can see how different they all are, and maybe how I figured out how to do this the way I did.
