LimeWire Resurrected By Secret Dev Team. Last month, the Gnutella-based

file-sharing client LimeWire was effectively outlawed after a U.S. federal

judge granted a request from the RIAA to shut the software down. Now, not

even a month later, LimeWire is back as good as new. Not only has a secret

dev team reanimated the hugely popular client, but they have also made a few

significant changes which make it better and more streamlined than before.




LimeWire Pirate Edition is free, open source software based on the final beta

version of the popular LimeWire filesharing application. After Lime Wire LLC

stopped distributing its software in October 2010, a horde of piratical monkeys

climbed aboard the abandoned ship, mended its sails, polished its cannons and

released it FREE to the community to help keep the Gnutella network alive. LimeWire Pirate Edition is pure P2P software; it does not depend on any servers

operated by Lime Wire LLC or other companies. It does not include any adware or

spyware, and it cannot be remotely monitored or shut down.â€ Based on LimeWire 5.6 beta

Turbo-charged downloads

Optimized search results

AVG Anti-Virus
