,bizmark2000,2011-04-05T13:22Z,"Supreme Commander 2 v1.250 Definitive edition = http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6237979/Supreme_Commander_2_v1.250_Definitive_edition

This game is currently Working, Checked and Tested it. And it works Fine, even better then fine, no buggs at all.

Several things you need to remember:
The installation is so easy that it doesn't need a guide. Just read what it's asking you and press next. It's that easy.

Here are the steeps for really NUUB people.
- First step Install Steam and make an account. then Logoff from steam when installing this crack.
- Mount game
- Choose Language
- If it asks, install Net frame If it doesn't skip this step.
- Tic to install DirectX, Visual C++ and SmartSteam
- Choose Steam Version ( Online Multiplayer ) "
,bizmark2000,2011-04-05T13:26Z,"- Choose Steam Version ( Online Multiplayer ) To play ONLINE.
- When you get the Windows Command (window) do not close until you se the text that it's done and press any key to close. ( The installation is slow so be be patient )
- Mini window will pop up and asks you to choose language. Choose language and close it.
- When the installation is done. 
Start (SmartSteam) then to start the game go to Star - All programs - Supreme Commander 2 - And press on (Play.exe)

You are done now. and can play Online with others.

,Drkpl8,2011-04-10T22:58Z,"umm.. i have a little problem with this torrent.
i've chosen ENGLISH but all the text in the game is spanish, but the audio is english.
if i run the options cmd a console pops up where i type in 1(english) and then ""6"" for language change, but then it says something unable to find a version of the runtime.... bla bla(error)

i mean when i want to research something or build something i cant read that...
please help? : /"

,fight4anarchy,2011-05-01T10:22Z,"for anyone having trouble with the language jst do this.

1. C:\Program Files\Supreme Commander 2\gamedata

2. then look for a file like this ""loc_ES"" (e.g. ""loc_DU"") depends what language yours is coming up in but make sure the last to letters of the file are in capitals. and what you want to do is rename in ""loc_EU"" and there you go... now in english :) "

,demsccrstd,2011-05-30T18:03Z,Whenever I go online it says there's players on but it cannot find any servers? Anyone know why that is happening? Other than that the game works perfectly fine. Thanks uploader.
,blasterdick,2011-06-02T11:38Z,Can somebody help me i cannot see any players in the room. 
,ihatejuggy,2011-06-05T18:26Z,"Everything works perfectly, multi as well. Just follow the instructions given with the file (for single player or multi player versions).

Online play is the tricky part as there is a very very small online pirate community for this version and it'll be a good 1 month or so before you even see a server or another player. (Always showing 440etc players online but 0 severs scanned or if you are hosting NO-ONE EVER LOGS ON!!!)

The solution is the join the steam group "" Machine/Awesome "" and use it to track fellow smartsteam supreme 2 underground players / invite them to your games.

My in-game alias is Falcon1.

Thanks uploader and thanks razor."
,streetbum149,2011-06-08T04:57Z,"@ihatejuggy ya playing online is a real bitch with pirated games, one of the main programs i used to play on tho was pretty good (tunngle). it was basically like setting up a lan game with friends at home. what really sucked tho were the occasional assholes who would come on just to cheat, and in turn cheat everyone else out of a good time."
,streetbum149,2011-06-08T05:11Z,"@tazeris, i have a solution! take a very large hammer and smash your computer. lol jk on a serious note tho its probably your mem\graphics. on a game like this id say memory because of the large amounts of units and the like. but if its from cut-scenes\messages as you say it may be something different entirely. sorry i cant be of more help but this sounds like a pc wizard question, which i am not."
,streetbum149,2011-06-08T06:38Z,now that i am installing this i see just how complete it really is. the download not only comes with all updates and the dlc it even comes with a WORKING trainer! very complete indeed. thank you to whatever master-mind was behind this great one-shot installation.

,WOLFGANGTHOR,2011-06-12T21:17Z,"UPDATE

okay I think I figured it out, because I originally installed the non-online is probably the reason it only had SKIDROW as the char. Installing the online version now, hopefully works."

,Jurosem,2011-06-17T14:41Z,"Game works, fine, all is good, except... is it just me, or does this game suck a little? This is supposed to be the sequel, yet if I played both this and the original without the benefit of a title, I would guess they were the other way around. The game has been unnecessarily simplified and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of strategy involved now.  Aren't sequels supposed to be bigger and better, rather than simpler and more tame? ;)

Thanks alot for the torrent though, and also for the advice on how to switch to English."
,swingster,2011-07-06T16:33Z,"How come this ""package"" doesn't include the DLC although it says that it is included? (You can see it isn't installed by checking the left side of the launch screen where it should say ""infite war pack"" and then there should be a check box)"
,kpeonlajn,2011-07-06T16:50Z,"The DLC doesnt work with ""online mode""!

Yes the DLC is installed, is checked working in offline mode, but you can only play skirmish / campaign with it. "

,xnajera006,2011-10-02T20:04Z,"I am unable to get multiplayer working. I am new to Steam as well as SmartSteam.

I followed the instructions and have read the guide.pdf

I did select the Steam Version for Multiplayer Online when installing.

I also made sure to wait until the command prompt window said it was finished.

When I run SmartSteam, Steam launches however in the running programs I do not see smartsteam.exe, I only see steam.exe.

I have never purchased a game on Steam and currently can not add friends.

I do see other server when in Steam and I browse for them.

I have tried both launching supreme commander 2 from within steam and from the actual exe directly.

I have also tried launching from the options.cmd and selecting number 3 ""Play online with Steam -single or multiplayer-

I have previously seen the ""Enable DLC Content in Skirmish and Multiplayer"" checkbox but that is gone now (I assume after launching steam as that was when I noticed it was gone)

The specific problem I have is when I go to host a game, put in the server name and a password (or no password) it simple pops up with an in game error message of ""Connection Failed""

I read somewhere on the internet that SmartSteam was not working but I have no idea if that was old and has any relevance at all.

Any guidance would be appreciated.


"
,xnajera006,2011-10-04T01:22Z,"Ok, so I figured it out on my own. On a hunch I checked the connection log in the Steam folder and found out that it was sending a request to Steam servers and Steam was then sending a disconnect back. 

It turned out that the APP ID I was using (which came with this download and others) was ""banned"" by Steam.

To correct this you need to use a working app ID in the %gamedirectory%\bin\steam_appid.txt file."

What do you mean by using a working appid?
