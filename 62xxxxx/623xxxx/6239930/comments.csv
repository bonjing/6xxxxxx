[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-13T22:48Z,"it would make more sense to upload this under the title ""THE WAVE"", as that's what it was released as in English-speaking countries."
[V],BOZX,2011-03-14T04:53Z,"i kno u have this in ""The WAVE"" title...

since ""Die Welle"" the original release name so thought not to modify this and also doesn't make sense as it have a German Audio wid Eng subs....

ppl will find it anyway"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-14T11:33Z,"actually it does make a lot more sense to name it by it's english title.

and the vast majority of your foreign film uploads have their english-speaking countries' title, so this is just ignorant inconsistency."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-14T11:35Z,"people searching for ""the wave"" (which they are much more likely to do) will NOT find it."

,fuckit105,2012-01-19T03:31Z,I NEED this ( as all of the not-english speaking countries people) without subtitles so I can put by my own subtitles of my language
