Messing around with my new Sony Vegas Pro software and decided to make a Music Video for this KISS song from their most recent studio album "Sonic Boom". Took the live version from Rock Am Ring, Synched it to the Studio recording and added extra snippets from throughout the Rock Am Ring concert into the mix to create a best of what Kiss do live in the one song (given the footage I had to work with).....Enjoy!!!
