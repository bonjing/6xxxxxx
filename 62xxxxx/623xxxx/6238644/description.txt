During the early 1980s there was a resurgence of interest in the ladies' evening wear styles
of the early 1940s peplums, batwing sleeves and other design elements of the times were reinterpreted
for a new market. The shoulder pad helped define the silhouette and was
reintroduced in cut foam versions, especially in well-cut suits reminiscent of the WWII era.
Before too long, these masculinized shapes were adopted by women seeking success in the
corporate world and became an icon of women's attempts to smash the glass ceiling, a
mission that was added by their notable appearance in the TV series Dynasty..
