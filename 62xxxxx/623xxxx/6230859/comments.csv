,Hippi69,2011-03-11T03:24Z,What's the bit-rate on this?
,User897,2011-03-11T09:34Z,"Goddammit.  Why isn't there one in 1080p without the DTS distorted sound shit?  The picture is great, but constantly having to turn the sound up and down sucks!"
,Skram0,2011-03-15T05:13Z,It says AC3 is included too. Can't you just select AC3 instead of DTS... :?
,Skram0,2011-03-15T05:18Z,"Why is this 1920x1080 when this movie is actually a 2.39:1 ratio!?

So it should be around 1920x800. So what's up with the extra 280 lines!? Is this zoomed and cut!?"
,Skram0,2011-03-15T05:44Z,"Hmm, never mind. I found that some versions of this movie is 1920x1080 to preserve some IMAX quality."
