,hakuna_matata,2011-03-11T18:59Z,"Hey this Melanie got to be lucky at getting special treatment for you 20-40 :P
and on a serious note .. I want to know the preset for x264, cant seem to figure out exact settings, though getting good results but not like urs."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-11T19:43Z,"@hakuna_matata: She asked, as humans did, but forgot. Starting with Please and ending with Thanks. Just that.

Regarding x264 - there is no secrets, every movie has .nfo with EXACT encoding parameters. Anybody with even low level of encoding knowledge can replicate EXACT command-line which is absolutely same for 480p too.  Besides, just yesterday I gave away encoding .bat and parameters inside are unchanged from my own - just sizes are different, as inputs are predestined by Melanie,

Quality of the source determines quality of the  output - one CANNOT re-encode XviD and expect some sort of magic. 

In re-encoding output is always worse than presumably nice, error-free input. Re-encoding is like Xeroxing - copy is always worse looking than original. But - IF one re-encode to make files smaller - loosing the quality should be anticipated trade-off.

And - as I  said gazillion times - I use my own software and - more important - out there are better encoders than me, maybe not so stupid, as I surely am, but according to many screams - many people is much better in x264 encoding than I ever be. As every fool cannot make 2 or 4.34 GB great looking encode."

,[[PALADIN]],2011-03-12T08:08Z,"your uploads are the best ;)  thank you for all that you do... 

just FYI i got a notice from MGM for downloading ""Tangled"" just thought you should know (dont think you can do anything about it ... but just FYI "
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-12T09:20Z,"@[[PALADIN]] : Any of the people who downloaded that torrent CAN see and collect Internet addresses of ALL other downloaders. They can limit their download speeds and be present as downloader for days - and during that time quietly, in peace, collect IP addresses of anybody who joins in. That is what they do for years. 

Other thing are contracted agencies (law firms and specialized companies) who have been hired by ALL Holly-shit production companies to monitor net activities.

Keep in mind that memo from several production companies encourage employees to report any suspicious activity they spot during their every-day's use of Internet. Several memos from 2007 onward goes further, practically rewarding employees AND instructing them to even encourage their family members to use to the maximum whole P2P sharing and report their findings back, certain in ""We doing the right thing"".

Let me remind you that ""We doing the right thing"" lies beneath all perpetual evil, injustice and wrong-doings of any province. Hitler was saying ""We doing the right thing"".

Be careful. Run PeerBlock, that way you would block major anti-P2P groups. About individuals, who are permanent residents of the Dark Side - you can do a squat.

NEVER reply to those accusations. If they obtained that information on illegal way, gathering info from engaged individuals - that cannot legally fly. They are just fishing, as Nigerian financial ""experts""."
