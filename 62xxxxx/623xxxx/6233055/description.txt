Kids constantly kicking and screaming at each other, doors slamming, dogs barking â€” what would you do if you had to deal with this chaos in your household? Thatâ€™s the question Jessi says she grapples with on a daily basis. She says her husband, Jeremy, acts like a child, wonâ€™t help discipline their two kids and hikes every day while sheâ€™s left to run the household. Jeremy claims his wife is just jealous that he has a life outside the home. See what happens when mother, PR maven and Dr. Phil special contributor, Kelly Cutrone, makes a house call! And, Jessi tells Dr. Phil that she suspects her hubby is cheating when he says heâ€™s going out for a run. What does Kelly discover when she investigates? Can Dr. Phil help Jessi decompress and create a true partnership with Jeremy? Plus, meet a woman who says she hates being a wife and mother and regrets having three kids.
