I thought about posting a torrent titled ""klingons in the whitehouse"" and thought if I did perhaps I too would get a four page spread on MSNBC. ( You know priority and such for the news media)
But then I figured I'd also have to take a picture of myself in a Tony the Tiger outfit and post it here too. :)"

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-11T09:15Z,"BTW I frequently hate my music beyond anything you can imagine. There is a part of these left in side me that despises myself so deeply at one point I literally had to hid even the knowledge of knowing that I knew how to play so I wouldn't detroy myself in hatred. Do you have any idea what it is like.
I said once I don't know which is worse;
the ending of another day
or the beginning of a new one.
Can you possibly imafine what it is like to have a monster like Ted inserted so deeply in your soul from how cruelly he hurt us, and how so elequently he diplayed how evil God was to me then.
That in the mornings sometime still. The only thing I have to fear. Is being alone with myself.
Until finally I realized it wasnt God that hurt, that hated. Its just people."

Today a friend met me in the hall and gave me a pepsi and I said to my other friend, ""If the world was like the people who live here..it would be a nice place then."" In these people who have so little and understand so very much.
I have lived her for close to 15 years now. They know. I have never had to have the police come here once for me. Ever. And I take care of people here as they take care of each other. Sometimes this world is beyond me, in its silence.
In its culpability."
