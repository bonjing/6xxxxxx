,Wolseley,2011-04-05T01:40Z,Are those AVI files?
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-05T14:07Z,"They are mp4 files, the quality is still good, more so later on"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-12T03:27Z,"How does everyone like it? In case you were wondering how I combined the vids in seasons 4-8, I used VideoPad. I uploaded a torrent, with the full version, that way you don't have to constantly redownload, like I had to for a while. Anyone have any problems?"

10 days"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-28T04:21Z,"Yeah, sorry it's quite a big file, I'm trying to seed it, but in the mean time, I do have them posted individually, seasons 1-3 have sufficient seeders, seasons 4-8 I'm still working on, I will post when they are doing better"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:06Z,"All of the seasons are up individually, plus I have started uploading DVD quality of seasons 1-5, the dvd quality are actual dvd rips. "
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-09-01T02:54Z,"I might be removing this torrent, considering I already have all of the seasons up"
