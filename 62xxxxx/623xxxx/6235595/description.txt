           In "The Cutting Edge: Fire & Ice," Francia Raisa reprises      
           her role as Alexandra "Alex" Delgado in film franchise,        
           whose figure skating career came to an abrupt halt after       
           her partner (on and off the ice) became injured. As their      
           love affair cooled, a heart-broken Alex stopped competing      
           and turned to teaching. Enter James Van Behr (Fehr), the       
           smoldering bad boy of speed skating, who has had fiery         
           Alex in his sights as a skating partner ever since he was      
           banned from speed skating. There aren't many girls who         
           say no to James Alex may well be the first. However,           
           James pushes her buttons, challenging her like no one          
           else and her fighting spirit returns. She agrees to be         
           his partner and they begin a grueling practice regimen         
           fueled (and occasionally derailed) by their own                
           tempestuous relationship which heats up as they get            
           closer to competition. But will their passion destroy          
           Alex's chance to bring home the gold again?
