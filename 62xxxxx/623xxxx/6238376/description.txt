Donovan's First 2 Albums Remastered & Expanded 

What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid (Released: 14 May 1965)

Donovan's album debut, What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid, presented his breakout British single, "Catch the Wind," and added an assortment of pleasant folky jams. Though he was often derided at the time as a pale imitation of Bob Dylan, there isn't a lot of evidence here; true, he does cover the Woody Guthrie song "Car Car (Riding in My Car)" and gives it some twang worthy of the master, but his style is his own, slanted toward the mysticism of British folk less than the earthiness of its American cousin. Donovan summons the proper age-old weariness for "Goldwatch Blues," gets a bit bluesy for "You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond," and lets it all hang out for "Keep on Truckin'." [A 2002 reissue by Castle added four bonus tracks, including versions of "Catch the Wind" and "Colours," plus the B-sides "Why Do You Treat Me Like You Do" and "Every Man Has His Chain."]


Fairytale (# Released: 22 October 1965)

Donovan's second album found the Scottish folkie in possession of his own voice, a style of earnest, occasionally mystical musings indebted neither to Woody Guthrie nor Bob Dylan. True, Fairytale's highlights â€” "Sunny Goodge Street," "Jersey Thursday," and "The Summer Day Reflection Song" â€” use a sense of impressionism pioneered by Dylan, but Donovan flipped Dylan's weariness on its head. His persona is the wistful hippie poet, continually moving on down the road, but never bitter about the past. The folkie "Colours," already a hit before the album's release, is also here (though without Donovan's harmonica). A few of his songs are inconsequential and tossed-off ("Oh Deed I Do," "Circus of Sour"), but a few of these ("Candy Man" especially) succeed too, thanks to Donovan's effervescent delivery. [A 2002 Castle reissue added six bonus tracks, including a version of "Universal Soldier" and the B-side "Hey Gyp (The Slowness)."]
