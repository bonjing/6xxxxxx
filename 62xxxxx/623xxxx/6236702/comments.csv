,TiNiK,2011-03-12T07:40Z,Thank you man! I dont know what ill do withouth you!
,TiNiK,2011-03-12T07:41Z,BTW Could you tell me how you get the file from Teamoco site?
,amisnaru,2011-03-12T17:28Z,"Yeah! Finland represent!

also,
I wouldn't mind if you kept uploading these FLV's even when there are scene releases.
These save HDD space and the quality is perfectly OK for a talk show."
