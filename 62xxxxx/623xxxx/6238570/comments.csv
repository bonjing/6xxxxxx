,Deadlegend186,2011-03-13T14:38Z,"Thanks skidrow brilliant work as usual, pity its such a low budget game, I have only played for a few min's and it may be fun perhaps but its only one and a half gig for a reason, real shame as from the look of the movie trailers the movie looks well good but they rushed the game out.
oh and the controls are not properly mapped for the x-box controlled so I am going to make a pinnacle profile if anyone is interested.

D

PS I will seed for as long as I can to help others.

What do you think?

can someone tell me if this is the final cut, its bad, cut scene's are cartoon stills? whats that all about?"
,Cerebral222,2011-03-15T10:50Z,"Nice game, recommend dropping anti-virus before installing & playing; thats if you trust the uploader. Norton 360 v4 picks the Paul.dll as a Packed.vmpbad!gen1, whatever that is. I dropped anti-virus to play, no problems so far. My thanks to Sunblock and Skidrow for this upload."
