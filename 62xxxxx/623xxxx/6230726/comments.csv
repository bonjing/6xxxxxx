,DFigotin,2011-03-09T21:16Z,can you do the .mkv for ipods on the first movie?
,phiber0,2011-03-09T21:50Z,"NO. F$%k Apple.  They can't go with the standards out there that are common and played on 99.9999% of ALL OS's, then that's your fault for buying their shitty devices.  Don't worry, in a year or so they won't support your stuff so you can get something useful that will work out of the box."
,hardlime,2011-03-09T22:50Z,"you got your period or something mate? stop being a dick, the guy was only asking! cheers for the up HolyRoses....seen in imax theatre. pretty impressive visually even if the story was a bit thin."

,CodeZero23,2011-03-11T04:13Z,I'm new to burning movies on blu-ray.  If I wanted to play this movie on my stand alone blu-ray what would i need other than a blu-ray burner?  Thanks for any help
,SecretAgent21,2011-03-11T05:14Z,"aaah man, you're insane, greetz from MX! thank you!

,krazyq,2011-03-11T06:28Z,"i have a 37""led lg, will 1080 vs 720p matter? because im almost done with the 720 version and wondering if i should start on this one"
,User897,2011-03-11T09:30Z,"krazyq

720 will work perfect for that size of TV.

Just be careful with the sound.  All of the ones I have tried so far have a TERRIBLE DTS to AC3 conversion, resulting in TOO LOUD action scenes resulting in distortion, and TOO QUIET dialog scenes."
,hippygonemad13,2011-03-11T17:02Z,"Thank you so much for the upload, HR but the reason that I like downloading from you is because you primarily upload in m4v. MKV is cool and all because of the multiple audio tracks but it's really bulky and doesn't work on anything other than a computer. Will you be uploading another in m4v or should I covert this?"
,gamest08,2011-03-11T18:07Z,A gr8 up bt Please seed :( Im getting only 13 kb/s
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-11T18:14Z,I only uploaded this because the normal people were not uploading it in a timely fashion.  Yes a 720p m4v will come.
,EbilPhish,2011-03-12T06:41Z,"Fuck imageshack they have always been sucky, use imgur next time =)"
,telaras,2011-03-12T09:23Z,please seed!!!
,krazyq,2011-03-12T09:44Z,"how come when i play these bluray files from my portable hdd plugged into my tv the video works but no audio, or sometimes      the 2nd audio file will work which is usually a foreign language, i have the le5300 37"" lg,  is there  a way around this?"
,Reginaald,2011-03-12T12:44Z,13 gb O_O
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-12T16:33Z,@krazyq sounds like the player built into your TV does not support DTS audio.
,jrizz0,2011-03-12T19:11Z,Seed people! SEED!!
,M15h4r,2011-03-12T19:55Z,"HolyRoses: thank you for great job, I've been waiting too long.. :/

,pharaohrocks,2011-03-28T08:58Z,Great man. I love it. AWESOME quality and def worth the wait. Took me a week! I don't care. The quality is awesome and everything. 10/10 all the way.
,devilss81,2011-03-30T19:39Z,VERY VERY SLOW download. its been a day and im only at 40% and @75k/b. the top was just over a 100. this better be a great movie. 13G makes me think its good quality. i hope its worth the time. 
,john.shephard26,2011-04-01T16:07Z,"O my god, I'm downloading with 7 kbps since 29.03.11 its 13gb  movie, it says it needs 7 weeks to download, now I know this is for free but I really don't want to wait 7 weeks, so pleeease SEED FASTER!"

,xxbyke4lifexx,2011-04-05T22:34Z,thanks man...people please seed...i know it sucks to have 13 gb of dead of space taken up be a movie but than again the person who you uploaded it and seeded it from did the same thing...so keep it going...Long Live TPB
,alejandroc19,2011-05-01T22:25Z,Awesome quality. I'll be seeding for days. I suggest everyone else do the same just leave it seeding in the back round and you'll be helping others out. Just realize that everyone else is a person just like you who wants to enjoy the movie so try to sympathize and seed for people.
,hecumi,2011-05-06T16:18Z,"seed people seed !!! this site should do something to whoever doesnt seed!!! 367 seeders and im only getting 1kbs whats wrong!?
i always seed anything i download from here at least 5 times its original size so lots of other people can use it and i alway seed over 40 kbs for each torrent so why am i getting 1 kbs of download speed from this torrent, seed!!! "
,xylolz,2011-05-07T18:10Z,thanks
,MrReaper,2011-05-09T07:50Z,Currently seeding @ 400kbps. 
,Blackout046,2011-05-13T17:22Z,Will this file sync to my iPod Touch 4th Gen using iTunes? Phiber0 your opinions F$%king suck so GTFO.
,.Leto.,2011-05-22T03:42Z,really bad audio quality. basses are too loud so you'll hear distortion during the whole movie.
,CakeMonster,2011-06-21T10:11Z,"This is a great torrent.

I have watched the movie several times and there have been no problems. Both audio and video are great."
,neblin7,2011-07-03T14:43Z,Very nice ul.  thanks HolyRoses! =)
,hamks,2011-07-21T12:20Z,"Hi!
first of all thx a lot HolyRoses for ur huge effort! [like always! ;) ]
I wanna know that is it 3D version?

Although, I guess it wouldn't be, because its res is 1920*1080 so it's normal and for one eye(2D) not specialized for each eye = 3840*1080, han? that's right?)"
,amerelium,2011-07-31T02:15Z,"Picture is very good, BUT sound is poor - volume fluctuates a lot, like active sound normalization has been used, and there's clipping noise."
,legofreak7373,2011-08-11T19:58Z,"ISP is watching. beware. they contacted me, no not me, even worse... my mom! its a chill movie tho... just make sure to transfer your all your crap to a portable HD. and delete torrent file after. "
,pierobon,2011-11-14T18:28Z,"Hey, VLC tells me that this file has 6 subtitles tracks in Eng, Eng, Eng, French, Span, Port.
But I can not see the subtitles files like the Tron Classic torrent you uploaded.
Did you embed the subtitles inside the file?
Cause they seem to be non existent, VLC won't load any, even though he is giving me the option to choose between them.
Thanks."
,charlene17,2011-12-13T07:08Z,"Does someone know why when I seek in some 1080p movies (like this one) I really fast get bad sync between audio & video ?
- windows 7 x64 with a intel Q6600 3.2Ghz 4Go ATI HD 5830. Drive is a WD 2T0 caviar green. Audio is Asus Xonar DX.
- MPCHC last 64 bits edition for media player.

,President_Kush,2011-12-16T16:32Z,"@bergfurgaler.  Most people probably don't even know what studio monitors are.  1 thing they are is super expensive, not to mention all the rest of that gear... If they could just afford to go out and buy that stuff, then they'd probably just buy the bluray along with it, not wait to download it.  "
,BlkWltz19,2012-01-26T05:11Z,"Superb upload! 

Audio sounds great on my setup (and that's w/o bergfurgaler's killer system). I am using the x-fi fatal1ty sound card with turtle beach x12 stereo headset. X-fi set to entertainment mode/headphones. Using VLC, the audio device is set to 5.1 Have no audio issues here, and that's essentially emulating 5.1 too. "
,Zasz1,2012-03-24T08:53Z,"Tnx alot! great quality, but im not sure if this is a FHD"
,Fuunguus,2012-04-12T11:26Z,"Upload: 400kb/s Download:100-50kb/s 

What the fuck leechers!? SHARE!"
,balanced,2012-06-16T19:03Z,People complaining about lack of seeding and leechers need to realize that for North Americans anyway we really can't afford to seed much after getting a full copy of the download.  That's because in North America (and especially in Canada) the ISP's have imposed ridiculous bandwidth 'caps' which make it prohibitively expensive to download and upload movies.  They do that on purpose because here in Canada anyway the same companies that provide internet service also provide cable and satellite television programming that REALLY REALLY sucks and they are trying to prevent people from using the internet for downloading and streaming entertainment thus cutting off the revenue streams for their shitty television offerings.  So when you get people on here that don't seed back at least 1:1 that is what's happening.  Some of these plans have caps of only 60GB per month and then they charge $1-$2 per gigabyte transferred after that!!  So that means a download like this you could do only twice with a 1:1 ratio and then you're done with your cap for the entire month.  Hopefully that adds some kind of perspective to the behaviors you're seeing.
