,saltmanstoner,2011-04-03T20:08Z,"Since this has so few comments, I feel obliged to say that this release is amazing. I now have a version to use on every computer I come to. Slow-ass 98 box? Use CS. Linux + Wine? Use CS2? Reasonably modern? CS3. High-endy? CS4-5. Small file sizes, excellent, clean download. Will seed until 1:2. Thank you webchella!"

,dailen,2011-04-26T05:40Z,"you're retarded...these work great, Avast found no viruses, aside from some annoying ""setup.bat"" that launches a browser window for some dude to make some money they all work great. I extracted the setup files using 7-zip to folders and just deleted the setup.bat to avoid the hassle."
,jakobslad,2011-05-10T04:37Z,"Does this work after 30 days? Because there was no serial or anything to register it besides saying the ""RegLog"" couldn't be found when I clicked register."

,ozzybrent,2011-06-07T23:37Z,"Hey, I'm new to all of this. Can someone please tell me how to install CS5 ..... Exactly Which files do i need to extract and run. I've been looking through all the files and none of them seem to jump out at me like with other programs i've downloaded here on pirate bay. Any help would be appreciated."
,dude2030,2011-08-01T02:42Z,"!!! CS1 is infected with VIRUS ""Trojan.Win32.Generic.pak!cobra""!!! 

But others (CS2&CS3&CS4&CS5) are clean."
,Emelin551,2012-05-11T21:17Z,nice work!!!
,wolfbeast,2012-06-14T20:01Z,"CS1: infected!!
CS2: didn't try
CS3: works partially
CS4: doesn't work, missing dlls
CS5: broken, doesn't open half the files
and ALL of them send you in your browser to various adfly and other ad pages upon launch.

You don't deserve your green skull. You should crawl into a hole and repent."
