SUMMARY:
The Underwater Universe generates three types of
deadly waves, each bigger and more destructive than
the last: Rogue, Monster and Tsunami. This episode
will progress from bigger to bigger waves and explore
how these killers are born and what makes each unique
We end the hour with the biggest recorded impact wave
in Earth's history: a mega Tsunami over a hundred feet
high destroying everything in its path. How did it
happen? How did the planet survive? And could we be
hit by a wave that big again?[/CENTER]
