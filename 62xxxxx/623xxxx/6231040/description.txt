More than forty million people suffer from chronic, debilitating headaches, and in the United States, we spend more than $4 billion on over-the-counter painkillers. This widespread health problem can leave you merely annoyed with a minor discomfort or completely incapacitated from an excruciatingly painful migraine. 25 Natural Ways to Relieve Headaches will give you hope to relieve headache pain, no matter what its origin or intensity.

25 Natural Ways to Relieve Headaches offers new organic methods for finding relief from headaches. Author Romy Fox explains headaches' diverse triggers--such as air pollutants, stress, and diet--and how to avoid them. She also presents natural ways to alleviate pain with treatments such as:

* Meditation
* Herbs
* Homeopathy
* Acupuncture
* Qi Gong 

These are only a few of the effective methods to be found in this book. Each is thoroughly explained and includes addresses, phone numbers, and websites for further information, such as finding a practitioner in your area. With this breakthrough title, you will not only find relief from pain but perhaps a path to a headache-free life as well.
