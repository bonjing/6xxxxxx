They may be three guys from a west coast Swedish island, but the sound that drives the Johnny Lennartsson Group is anything but homespun. Lars Winther (bass) and Peter Larsson (drums) make up the trio of what Johnny Lennartsson describes as "a real band". "We're not dropping out of one project and into another, JLG is something we're all committed to," he adds. Ten years after first bringing together his own band, Johnny travelled to study at the Dick Groove School of Music in Los Angeles in 1992. Learning the ropes of blues and jazz guitar by day, he spent the evenings developing a rock fusion sound, gigging at venues such as the Palamino Club.
