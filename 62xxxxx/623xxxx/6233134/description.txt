TestDaf Training book, for people who don\'t know,
TestDaf is a proficiency test in the German language.
This test is usually a mandatory test in order to study in a University in Germany (although there\'s also a DSH test as an alternative).

I haven\'t seen much material for TestDaf online.
So I took the effort to scan this book
(took me a while, so please show some appreciation)
actually, I haven\'t seen any material... So here you go, enjoy!
