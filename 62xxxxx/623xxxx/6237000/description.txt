Life on a remote Greek resort island is forever changed when two atomic bombs are accidentally dropped there when a NATO plane flies overhead. This comedy chronicles those changes. When the pilots realize they've lost their load, they bail out of their plane and head for the island to get help. The government has beaten them to the punch though and has already sent out an agent disguised as a resort developer. All of them are busily looking for the missing weapons when the island is suddenly filled with clamoring, hedonistic tourists who believe the developer is going to build the best resort in the area first. When the Agean fish living just off the island begin to mysteriously die, everyone there realizes that the jig is finally up and they so give in to their wildest desires.
