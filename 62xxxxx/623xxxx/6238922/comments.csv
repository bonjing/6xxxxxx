,odan47,2011-03-13T17:42Z,"I've never used DW before, why is this download so big?  When you go to the website to purchase it, the download is 5MB."
[V],polisdavid,2011-03-15T21:24Z,"odan47,

It's that big because it has thing that are invisible to the OS - In other words you can burn it to a DVD an make a bootable Disk out of t - although as I said this failed to work in Snow Leopard."
,espirates,2011-03-19T07:00Z,So how do we convert this to just an app if we don't want to burn it ?
,enjourni,2011-04-18T04:54Z,"Comments don't make any sense. You mean you can't burn the DVD in Snow Leopard, or that the disk boots to Leopard instead of Snow Leopard? As long as you can repair a Snow Leopard drive, who cares what OS it boots?"
,enjourni,2011-04-18T04:58Z,"I think a clearer question is if this download is an official Revision 1102 disk, or something you made by applying the 4.3 updater to a 4.0-4.2 boot DVD?"
,enjourni,2011-04-18T04:59Z,"In other words, is this an official Revision 1102 DVD or one you made by applying the 4.3 updater to a 4.0-4.2 DVD?"
,pikzel,2011-04-27T23:05Z,"Won't boot my MBP 2010, and as enjourni said, it's not about the OS (it's about the hardware). A Revision 1102 DVD is needed, and this doesn't look like it.

,virus.app,2011-10-01T06:36Z,sl compatible and wont boot in sl.. pls explain that. i have sl on a macbook pro (bought it april 2010). one of the apps i downloaded from tpb sez my hdd is failing. thot this wud help....WILL IT?????
,nemosrings,2011-10-01T11:59Z,"I'm still happily using DW 4.2 on Snow Leopard, MacPro 2008 without issues. If this version is not working for you, perhaps 4.2 will. I have 2 boot drives in any case for maintenance & in case of corrupted system (which actually happened a month ago.) I know multiple drives or partitions are not easy concept for MBP users however."
,nemosrings,2011-10-01T12:05Z,I've used the dual drive boot concept for over a decade now. The ol' osx & classic os9 boot concept never died lol. Makes maintenance so much easier. Not to mention other options.
,virus.app,2011-10-01T14:51Z,do u have 2 different os installed in each of the partitions? y didnt i do it?.. so by doing this one can fix os related problems..? 
,virus.app,2011-10-02T07:21Z,653890 items out of order in my sl mbp.. but cant do anything abt it. guys i need this working on sl. my mbp is slow.. gets stuck every second click. what do i do?
,nemosrings,2011-10-03T09:45Z,"I have 4 HDD's on my MacPro, a system drive on each of two drives (though one of them uses a partition.) At one point I had OSX10.5 & 10.6 but was easier to have 10.6 on both for compatibility reasons. It would be possible to partition an mbp but not easy. I used Drive Genius to defrag drives first, then partitioned when I wanted to add or remove partitions, but that would mean using a DG boot disk for an mbp. Read the DG instructions carefully about how to partition drives. Defrag is first step & you cannot defrag a drive with an active system on it. Thus a boot disk needed. Unless you have another mac you can network boot from with DG on it."
,nemosrings,2011-10-03T10:12Z,"There's a utility disk called LEO which has both DW & DG & other utilities, it is supposed to be a bootable disk but I have not tried to burn to disk yet or boot from external drive. If it boots for you then could be potential answer instead of partitioning. You would need most recent version for Snow & Lion. www.funtener.org/programas-gratis-f3/topic-t284506.html or you may find a later version."
,virus.app,2011-10-03T18:58Z,thanx nemos. will try DG am also downloading DW4.2. will post the results. leo is too big for me. i have idefrag bt it is not bootable. will try everything to get my mbp working as it did 2 months ago
,nemosrings,2011-10-05T02:32Z,"LEO is around 1.95 GB but is supposedly a boot disk either for a DVD or external drive (incl. flash drive), and has all the main mac utilities. But as I suggested, I have not tried booting with it yet. Disk Warrior is the main one you need I suspect. I do not trust DG's directory checker, it has in fact caused issues for me in past & DW had to fix it. But DG is good for other purposes."
,nemosrings,2011-10-05T02:35Z,And I think it's been about 10 years since Techtool Pro fixed anything for me. lol Nowadays I see it as a useless piece of heavy machinery that does not do much practical whatsoever. DW is no. 1 main fixer.
,virus.app,2011-10-07T06:06Z,ok dw 4.2 didnt work either..it didnt boot on startup(dvd).. dg works fine. the defrag failed twice at around 12%.. some bad sector issues.. dw should work from a hdd with sl. all the problems i face today were caused by dupeguru when i tried deleting the many duplicate files i had in my hdd. i must have deleted some system files. not blaming the app for it..repaired the startup volume with sl disk. but i still see the spinning wheel everytime i right click.. maybe i am too fast for my computer..  thank you for dg nemos. will take your advice and exercise caution while using dg.
,nemosrings,2011-10-09T01:26Z,"Someone else posted a DW that some say does boot if you burn it the right way (not using toast.) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6713181/Diskwarrior_4.3_Revision_1107_Official_Boot_DVD_%2809.2011%29_%5BMULTi

I don't know what was wrong with that Leo link I posted earlier. Those files were supposedly rar files but were not set properly, the dipstick. I downloaded leo start of year but lost it on an ext hdd.

BTW not sure how old your mac is, but bad sectors sounds more like HDD issue, the drive itself might be dying. Some utilities will close off bad sectors to hide the problem. Just hope it's not an increasingly growing issue with a bad drive."
,ij98,2012-06-01T13:55Z,"Thanks! computer crashed. this app saved my ass! i didn't test the dvd function, since before DW dvd never worked for me. i had to reinstall the Lion system on a 16gb SD card. Worked pretty well, but very slow (probably has to do with the SD card). Made sure I followed the requirements for the formatting of the SD card before Lion install (about 11gb space at the end). This leaves about 4 gb left for various rescue softwares. At the end, I tested four different available rescue softwares, only DW was able to directly fix the disk.

I also have previously tested creating a flash based boot disk, derived from various rescue software DVD's. All failed miserably. I suggest people don't waste time burning expensive DVDs and optical disks. Just buy a 2 gb flash drive and create a toast image or something similar to it. You can test it before wasting your time burning an optical disc."
,ceilingtracer,2012-06-19T23:31Z,"this shit is no joke!  almost brought to tears by a hard drive failure giving me ""invalid sibling link.""  HD is back up and running within minutes of completing this download."
