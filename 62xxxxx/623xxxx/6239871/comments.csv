[V],hiest,2011-03-13T15:24Z,"Hi Hero-No-1,

Sorry for disturbing you now,

I tried to report this issue in suprbay, but i get an error saying : COULD NOT CONNECT TO REMOTE SERVER.

I have reported this guy SoftWarez before, he used to show his frustration by writing bad comments in my section, It was around an year from now when i reported him with my friend's account Jayden_Federer, 
i think he was warned by a TPB helper for yelling and writing foul comments.
Now he has started it again,

I believe i will get a permanent solution this time.

He thinks he can upload any external torrent he wants, but if i upload an external torrent, he calls me a thief, there are n number of external torrent uploaders, but this guy always targets me in particular.



Kindly do the needful,

Thanks & Regards,
hiest."
