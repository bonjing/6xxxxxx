,crimson_king,2011-03-14T20:47Z,Has anyone installed this? Just wondering if the keygen is clean...
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-03-14T21:19Z,The keygen is clean even the paranoia norton 2011 did'nt find anything.
,Germinate,2011-03-18T08:04Z,Thanks man works perfectly.
,umim,2011-03-19T14:42Z,42 pieces? Why?
,Cofra,2011-03-19T15:45Z,"Don't work for me. I have Windows 7 64-bit on a new Vaio. 

I'm able to start it and fill in the serial and then it starts the installation. But after a while it restarts my computer. Doesn't start over when the reboot is done.

Any advice?"
,Usedhuman,2011-03-21T20:27Z,"Not sure what I am doing wrong, but following the instructions I am getting please insert disc:1 errors"
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-03-21T23:12Z,"Usedhuman , try to install from iso or try mounting the iso with WINRAR OR POWERISO , used those programs my self and worked fine."
,rtsaus,2011-03-31T22:43Z,"@UsedHuman - Got Enter Disc 1 prob when trying to install when ISO mounted with UltraISO, burned to DVD instead and installed perfectly"
,Thuggish456,2011-04-01T04:43Z,"""This is a known Trojan... it is recommended that you quarantine this threat""

""PWS-SpyEye!env.a""

From AVG 2011


...

What's up with that?"
,Thuggish456,2011-04-01T04:43Z,"That's from running the crack program to register, by the way"
,Thuggish456,2011-04-01T04:45Z,"PWS-SpyEye!env.a

AVG identifies a ""known Trojan"" when you open the registration cracker

...

What's up with that?"
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-04-02T21:49Z,"@Thugi

The crack is flase positive , most of antiviruses start to plink when they see keygens/cracks. Nothing to worry about. If are skeptic , you better buy this software & support the developers."
,ljbew,2011-04-05T03:08Z,"I'm DL now some ppl say they will be back to tell. I might i don't know WTH I'll be doing in an hour!

""The security system (softlock license manager) is not functioning or is improperly installed""

,ljbew,2011-04-06T19:19Z,"Well Well Well @Thuggish456 Slap me in the face as many times as you like to. It does have a Trojan. At least I admit my faults. Ive got ALOT shit off tpb. Never had a trojan from a skull. It's not Chris fault by no means, I read ALOT comments on tpb about false post etc etc. Im not going to risk working around my firewall (I went to) that is already off (says not recommended)n anyway #FML 
 Thanks Chris for your time and effort that you put in, never seen your name B 4 I typed in AutoCad their you was.

 :D Cheer's

,ruly,2011-04-09T08:06Z,"It installed perfectly, but how do i change the language from japanese to english now?"
,rubengarciajr,2011-04-16T19:54Z,ifongliao>  Yeah I also have the same problem with the security lock error.  It seems to lock you from launching the program as it will close immediately.  
,rubengarciajr,2011-04-16T21:02Z,"It seems that if u fuck up during the cracking, that security lock shit will come up and prevent the program from launching.  Tried removing and re-installing several times and same shit.  "
,ifongliao,2011-04-20T18:53Z,"@rubengarciajr

yeah, needed that software, any luck at ur side? i see alot of Brothers having no issue with it.. but i just cant get it to activate..

help help~~"
,ifongliao,2011-04-20T18:59Z,"@rubengarciajr:
yeah, screwed up during that part, any luck with your side?

Brothers anyone help~? tried googling also doesnt help.."
,rubengarciajr,2011-04-24T06:34Z,"I haven't tried messing with it again.  It's probably so files left on there, that's causing it.  Last solution would probably be re-installing Windows, but wish there was something easier.  "
,Thuggish456,2011-05-06T04:30Z,"Mine was working perfectly for a while, and then it just took a crap on me, saying something about locksafe or something like that.  Now AutoCAD won't open, at all but all the other stuff will.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled everything several times. 

What's weird is I never even get to the point in the instructions where I run the crack anymore, because when I re-open the program, well, it doesn't open.

What happened?  Anyone know?"
,kadisio,2011-06-02T22:42Z,Thank you very much!
,Thuggish456,2011-08-14T03:13Z,"Something is wrong.  I have been trying to reinstall this program forever, but it thinks that it's already installed.  I have done all the REG edits that autodesk forums recommend, but there is one that will not go away.  It is in HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software.  It's called ""autodesk.""  I delete it, I restart, I come back, it's there.

Is this something that you did, or does autodesk suck that much?"
,rubengarciajr,2011-08-21T10:59Z,"Thuggish) same thing here. I get the software lock crap message and the program doesn't open. 

It seems like when u un-install it, noT everything deletes and u end up with the same thing when u reinstall. "
,westin86,2011-10-14T00:59Z,"If the software locks you out try deleting the license files. They are located...

On Vista or Windows 7:
C:\ProgramData\FLEXnet\adskflex_00691b00_tsf.data
C:\ProgramData\FLEXnet\adskflex_00691b00_tsf.data.backup 

On Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\FLEXnet\adskflex_00691b00_tsf.data
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\FLEXnet\adskflex_00691b00_tsf.data.backup"
,Thuggish456,2011-11-13T22:24Z,"I tried deleting the license files, but to no avail.  The problem is that when I go to install AutoCAD, it says that it is already installed.  But it is not.  So I can't install it, so I can't use it.

This does not happen with Inventor Fusion.  Just AutoCAD.

What the hell?"
