Christian has just moved into the neighborhood and today a friendly neighbor stops by with an armload of books. She introduces herself, and tells him about the neighborhood book reading discussion group. He laughs at her, and explains that normal, cool people don't exactly read books on Friday evenings. She is bummed, and takes her glasses off for a moment. Christian spots something cute about her and starts flirting. Maybe this nerdy neighbor has a surprise underneath that boring exterior!
