Only thing to say is that it looks more like a really good DVD rip as apposed to as crisp as a blu-ray or HD DVD rip but I could be wrong. Its just fine anyways, and im very greatfull as it is of perfectly fine quality UL. I only said the maybe not high res as there are some REALLY picky people out there. But reguardless, for my NON money its a great quality UL. (Relax, I pay my cable bill and get comedy central and watch this show all the time) I just miss an episode or two now and then and its really great to be able to DL the episodes i've missed. Thanks for the great UL!"

HDTV refers to the source, XviD is the format. If people want the high def one they can download the 720p version."
