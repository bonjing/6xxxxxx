,shasashu,2011-03-12T09:51Z,@markkeane there can be only 2 reasons: the drive u r downloading to is FAT32 or you don't have enough disk space left. make sure you have some extra space remaining thean yr download size.

,bartock,2011-07-16T14:50Z,"This is probably the stupidest question but being new to this, I am going to ask it.

Is there any particular software that one needs to burn this properly so that it will run on a XBOX 360? Never done this, so I gotta ask. 

I probably sound like a dumb-ass, but I am clueless.

Thanks All."
