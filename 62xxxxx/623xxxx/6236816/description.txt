It is all go at the Solana as Mateo prepares for his first water aerobics class. 
But when Donald takes a funny turn in the pool, Mateo finds himself in a spot 
of bother and has to ask Les/Lesley for help. The Garveys get a shock when they 
are approached by a gangster who tells them that they have inherited Mel Harvey's debt, 
and they attempt a very risky bet to pay off what they owe. Noreen's problems with Pauline continue - 
she has decided she wants to leave Benidorm early. Liam is still stuck to Natalie's side, much to Sam's annoyance. 
Gavin is becoming extremely suspicious of Kenneth - who arrived in Benidorm with no money but now seems to have rather a lot of it.
