This is the official release of Windows 7 64-bit with Service Pack 1 integrated straight from Microsoft's own MSDN network.

It's 100% legit and untouched, no serials or anything is included so this is only for people wanting the clean, untouched official Microsoft released Windows7 installation with Service Pack 1 integrated.

It's universal which means you select your edition upon installation (Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate etc..)

I wont be uploading the 32-bit image simply because I use 64-bit myself and the only reason I'm sharing this in the first place is because I know how difficult it might be to get your hands on a fresh, untouched and legit Windows7 installation with Service Pack 1 integrated without paying Microsoft for sending you one.



So this is it, I hope you enjoy!
