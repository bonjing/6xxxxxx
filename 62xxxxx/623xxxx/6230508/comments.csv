,RamGuy,2011-03-10T09:38Z,"The reason for it being small is the WinRar 4 BETA compression I guess, the ISO image itself is 3,32GB.

The bad speed is simply because I just got a 25/25mbit line so in the start with more leechers than seeders it might take some time."
,bambong,2011-03-10T12:04Z,"hey, am i the only one having this problem. when i click 'DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT'. It says no input file specified."
,Eagle|,2011-03-10T15:14Z,"Hi! Can this be activated with Windows Loader, have you tryed? :) Or does this SP1 include make somekind of trouble..."
,RamGuy,2011-03-10T22:29Z,"If you are having problems with the ""Download this torrent"" link (doesn't work for me either) just use the Magnet Link.

I don't really know if you can use Windows Loader for activation as I'm only using legit Windows 7 Serials myself."
,Eagle|,2011-03-11T17:43Z,"@azad115, Thank you, that I was expecting. :) Now I will download this and then format c: .... :D Have a nice weekend all of you users. :)"

Just have to decompress the rar files to a single ISO and either burn a dvd or use a usb installer as I did. Installed without a hitch. I dowloaded a separate Windows Activation Loader and it activated it with no problem first try on my Compaq laptop using the HP OEM registration. 

Thanks, I'll seed this for a bit so get it while I'm doing it."
