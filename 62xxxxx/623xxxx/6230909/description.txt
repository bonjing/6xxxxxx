The Tonight Show With Jay Leno 2011 03 02:  Simon Cowell, Jeff Gordon, Travis Barker & Cypress Hill, Battle of the Jaywalk All-Stars.

The video quality is quite watchable, but not as nice as a scene release (for some unknown reason, no scene release in XviD has materialized for this). The source was non-HD, was 4:3 and this is not a digital capture.
