,calleja62,2011-04-07T22:53Z,"Usually I only download from trusted uploaders, due to the risk of viruses (no offence Ferrari, you did good, but still I have to be careful).

This is a good torrent, and I intend to seed."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-09T04:51Z,"Thanks everyone, yeah I can understand about the ""being careful"" thing, I hate viruses, I have at least two antivirus running at all times. O by the way, if you want to look for my gamertag on Halo 1 PC, it's O'Malley"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-09T04:53Z,"Plus if you have Halo 3 on Xbox, my Gamertag is         O Ma11ey, yeah, I kept the trend from Halo 1 and up."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:51Z,"Thank you everyone for seeding, I will now be uploading Crashday as a thankyou, I hope you like it, it's a racing/ destruction derby game."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-12T03:32Z,Crashday is now uploaded
,kekepnk,2011-04-14T02:02Z,"i feel pretty stocker right now but i really need help with halo 2, please"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-16T04:37Z,"It's ok, if I like someone's torrent, I usually check to see what else they have, I'm trying my best with Halo 2, it's just that I'm getting more leechers than I am seeders, if you are able to dl it, could you please seed, I know it will take a while, but it will really help out."
,waaaasupp,2011-04-16T16:40Z,Hey every time I try to run Halo.exe I get a fatal error message saying one of the files is missing or corrupted. Any ideas?
,JonathanX95,2011-04-19T07:32Z,works great! Thanks!
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-23T05:39Z,"@ Waaaasupp 

The only thing I can think of, is that it didn't download properly, try deleting it, and redownloading it. If not, then it might be compatibility issues"
,darcussss,2011-04-27T15:15Z,i love you man 100%works
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-29T16:58Z,Your welcome

,FallenGamer1994,2011-05-14T05:10Z,I had a lil problem i went to play online and then I hit multiplayer and hit internet and tells me I have to manual update you know how to fix this or you have something i have to do to play online. I tried looking up the update and couldnt find it i found one from microsoft but i figured that would be a bad idea since it is a downloaded game
,CBHPwns,2011-05-16T09:53Z,"Thanks for seerding, so do people still play this online? Im looking for a shooter my pc can run."
,Rockchuckhe,2011-05-25T22:07Z,"@ FallenGamer1994

I have the same problem. Game works amazingly, I just cant connect to any of the servers. It just gives me an ""unable to connect"" message, then sends me back to the Main Menu. I've tried disabling my firewall, that's not it. Tried going to the website given for the ""manual update"" but that just directs me to some xbox live crap. Suggestions? Preferably a solution."
,TK_22,2011-05-26T07:21Z,Do you have to install ??? 
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T06:45Z,"@ TK_22

No installation necessary, basically put it wherever you want it, then just open up the executable (Halo.exe) "
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T06:51Z,"If you happen to be using XFire, and it won't detect it (which is what happened to me at first) I will give you a walkthrough

Open Xfire

Go to notifications (it looks like an asterisk)

Click on detect games (over on the right panel, scroll down, until just above you're game list)

Wait for it to locate games

Double Click on the not installed text (locate on the left side, directly underneath the Installed text)

Scroll down until you see Halo (not halo custom or trial)

Click it

On the right side, change the setting from automatically detect to manual detect

Click browse

Double click the Halo.exe (you have to search and find wherever you downloaded the game to, so if you saved it to a flashdrive, it would be on there)

Then, next time you open Halo, it should say Xfire ingame enabled

Hope that helps

If you have xfire, check out Ferrariaftrdark

What are you running for a computer?"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-07-31T02:09Z,"@ Fallengamer1994

I've had similar problems lately with certain servers, but most dedicated servers work fine, it has to do with internet connection, and what version they are running. I'm currently trying to find a patch to fix this."

Yes you can, press t to talk to everyone, or h to talk to your team only."
