[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-13T07:06Z,"I'm getting many many requests, and I couldn't check all my torrents, so if you can wait I'll do them.
Avatar took more than 600MB !!!
Should I up it ???"
,banukaknight,2011-03-13T07:43Z,"typed ""Avatar"" on 1337x.org
the 1st 2 pages filled with torrents..
size says 1GB plus..
in that case..
of cause 600bm is bearable..
but..
not sure if it'll get fair enough number of seeders/down loaders... as the movie is kinda old now..
so...
who wants AVATAR ???

(other than me :)"
,supcena,2011-03-13T08:03Z,"yay yay yay....finally its out ...been waiting for ages ....thank you so much man and happy to know that you're a fellow indian ....
@Avatar -there are rips sized around 600 mb already present on piratebay ....so its upto you mate ...

,banukaknight,2011-03-13T12:48Z,"@supcena
i tried.
and wt i found was 3 torrents from MKVGuy - 700mb, 600mb, 400mb.. the screen resolution orr the snapshots didnt give a good expression...
so.. idk boy..
think StyLishSaLH should give the prioriy (lie do fist).. the newst movis...

think about the oldies when there's no worth stuffs to do..
anyws.. dont you wish to do some bollywood stuffs yaar?
i wasted a whole day downloading DON 800mb torrent.. well it was kinda worth the down..

give a try to do some old sharuk's work...
like veer zara, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehena, or.. Billu Baber** 
(if u get the time.. as mr Riddler aint having much time for that.
chak de india yaar.

,Icehawk75,2011-03-14T08:29Z,"Great torrent seeding at 38kb/sec , sry guys i have low bandwith only 256kbps upload/download thats my full potential "
,banukaknight,2011-03-14T09:32Z,"MKVGuy - isn't uploading anymore.
Riddler - prefers to do HD quality rips
most of the time 1GB in size.. (which is unbearable)
YIFI - good quality 500mb in size..(350-800mb)
pluto999 - good quality. 400mb .. (bearable size) but takes quite a while for him to do the uploads
then..
comes the StyLishSaLH ticen :)
300mb in size (250-450mb)
great quality
good supporters.. and rocking indian.

Who would you chose ?
lol
jai ho bhai."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-14T11:42Z,"I like that comparison :)
I've on 50kbps upload speed icehawk :P
I'm waiting for better sources, else I'll be upload fast, I can re-encode from 700MB avi, but that wont be good. 
So wait & get a 4+GB VOB file or a 1080P mkv, here I'm :)
Thanks for all the support friends.. "
