,Sevakidd,2011-03-15T18:31Z,"It says ""No input file specified"" when I try to download the torrent.....something up??"
,AnitialD,2011-03-16T04:57Z,"Sevakidd,
No idea what that means, ur the first one to comment so I dunno whats up. No complaints or compliments just a pretty good # of downloads so far....Sorry. Anyone else having any problems?"
,prosit,2011-03-16T08:44Z,"Yeah, it doesn't work. Go to iso... (another tracker) instead. There it seem to be uploaded correct."
,AnitialD,2011-03-16T19:27Z,"Well I have 4 trackers that are currently working that I'm using to seed with...right now so, click the link to see em

I'm not sure why everyone is having a problem... I have the the torrent uploaded here and demonoid."
,Sevakidd,2011-03-20T19:18Z,I still can't get it. I don't know what that image means; is there another place I can download this? Please tell me as I am not so techno-savvy on these things :)
,AnitialD,2011-03-21T04:08Z,I dunno what else to say but just watch it on YouTube...
,Sevakidd,2011-03-21T19:34Z,"I'll just wait til someone who knows what they're doing uploads it properly. I've been downloading on Pirate Bay for 2 yrs and never had this problem once, so I'd think about that if I were you: and others have the problem with your upload. Thanks for uploading it, but much more effective uploading something that people can USE, you know? "
,AnitialD,2011-03-22T07:30Z,"Or maybe ur a dumbass...ur the ONLY one having a problem...this isn't my 1st upload here and I never had problems or complaints with my previous torrents. I also have many people thanking me for this upload on Demonoid, which is the exact same torrent u can't figure out how to download here. Also, if there was a problem I don't think people would be seeding it...like they are. And I still don't even know what problem ur having...click on download this torrent  and use utorrent to open the torrent. It will download. Done. You just said ur not so techno-savvy on these things, well I am and I know how to upload a torrent. You don't even have to do anything but put the movie/samples/pix/etc in a folder create the torrent and seed it...pretty much no way to ""do it wrong"". Sorry ur having problems...hopefully someone will do exactly what I did so u can magically download theirs. I'm the only one who has uploaded this anywhere as far as I can tell since it's 3/11 release so don't hold ur breath..."
,pnixte,2011-03-23T15:01Z,"Sorry, as of March 23 there is no way that this torrent can be downloaded. AnitialD, try it for yourself."
,AnitialD,2011-03-23T23:12Z,"Your Right pnixte! Sorry Sevakidd for being an ass. It doesn't work ""HERE"" when u try to download but if u can get on Demonoid, u can still download it there , it works I just did it. I'm also gonna reupload here in a bit. Thanx again."
,AnitialD,2011-03-23T23:47Z,"Here Sevakidd and all, I reuploaded this torrent, link below, it should be working this time.

Any problems let me know. Thanx."
,AnitialD,2011-03-23T23:51Z,"I'm the only 1 seeding the new torrent, so be patient till we get some more seeders. I'm seeding as fast as possible. Thanx"
