So, with that said, the fact they had to trump up a ""glowing"" review will tell you how sad this ""horror"" film really is. Slow, boring, and filled with painfully bad actors, confusing shots, and a wretched score. This ""movie"" is more like a visit to the dentist for a root canal than a clever stylized horror film. Gaudy, stupid, and just plain irritating. Don't waste your time. Get the perfect popcorn, turn out the lights, but watch something else. Figure skating will have you more on your seat than this piece of crap."
