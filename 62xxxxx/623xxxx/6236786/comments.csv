,scott808,2011-03-12T05:24Z,I wouldn't download this.  The guy took eztv's normal title.
,tiss2,2011-03-12T05:31Z,"what do you mean ""normal title""? Sceneline is one of the biggest uploaders .."
,Berserker1982,2011-03-12T08:33Z,"""Normal title""??

eztv's got their own site (which has been down for maintenance for a while, btw) and people get their shows where the quality and timing is. If eztv slacks or doesn't even bother uploading an HD version, the party who does gets the DL. Survival of the strongest."
,blackest,2011-03-12T08:43Z,oh come on... packed into rar ? how do I know if there's a password ?
,castiboy,2011-03-12T13:36Z,"meh... rar packing of video torrents is stupid, there's no compression at all really, and i can't just DL it to my NAS directly..."
,scott808,2011-03-12T18:44Z,"Yeah there is no point for the rar.  The file is exact same size as eztv's.  What I mean by ""normal title"" when someone has uploaded as many as eztv has he uses the same exact title over and over period for period.  When someone copies that exactly generally they are trying to catch people that are impatient or don't notice it wasn't uploaded by their normal dl.  This could be as simple as just wanting to get noticed as an uploader or could just be lower quality wasting some of your bandwidth.  There is the possibility that could even be a virus or key logger though."
