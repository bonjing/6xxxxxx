,SarahK_2009,2011-04-27T09:27Z,"sry to post again, but hey.. I've never done this before. I watch a tut on youtube and figured out how to ""mount"" the tse.exe to the game file, but it won't let me. It says they're is not enough space to add the crack file. now what?"
,Darkforge317,2011-04-30T21:40Z,"Guys, My Norton 360 detected a virus named Back Door  or something like that. It's a virus that lets the host get into your e-mail,facebook,twitter, Etc... I trust Norton 360 100% and trust me... whenever I try to start the game it says invalid Sims 3 disc. Even though I put all the files on a DVD disc. So this torrent is pretty much just shit for all of us."

,sioux2,2011-05-06T15:35Z,"Seriously a waste of time. Once downloaded, Sims 3 icon does show up, but doesn't give an option to install. Doesn't come with keygen, crack, or instructions. Shows virus warning. "

,rrpostal,2011-06-01T19:01Z,"I generally don't like to pile on people just because they haven't done this a lot. But it does bug me when people think they know what they are doing and obviously don't. 

Thanks for the game. Haven't gotten it all yet, but it looks like it's put together in a good way and what I want is there."
,isunes,2011-06-06T23:27Z,"To the techsavvy users who got this to work:

I pasted the crack in the folder, but there was no pop up to replace it, or anything, so I just removed the AutoRun application file.  But when I clicked on the crack nothing happened.

This is my first time, so can someone nice pleasee write out a list of instructions? (TWSS)

Thank you!"
,Artist-8,2011-06-19T02:14Z,"Alright, since everyone else is busy being mean, I'll help out some of you who are new to this. I mean we all start somewhere right ;)!


Before the instructions though, please be aware that I have not downloaded this completely as yet. I usually read comments beforehand and did the same for this one, which brings me to the instructions:

1.	First, open up the main folder, Sims 3, mount the .iso file and run Setup.exe.
1a).	If you donâ€™t know how to mount, then download a virtual drive tool. I personally use both Daemon Tools Lite and Virtual Clone Drive (both freeware), as they, combined, support every image file I have ever come across. I prefer VCD over Daemon Tools whenever possible. Itâ€™s just less noticeable, in a way.
1b).	Once youâ€™ve downloaded the virtual drive tool(s) of your choice, open them. For some you have to enable virtual drives, and for others itâ€™s on by default. Itâ€™s simple enough. Then hover over, or click on, either â€œMountâ€, or the drive shown (e.g. â€œDrive K:â€) and select the file to mount. This is, once again, the .iso file in â€œThe Simsâ€ folder.
1c).	Once that is done, a popup should appear if autorun is enabled. Otherwise, go to My Computer and right-click on the virtual drive.
1d).	In either case, you want to run Setup.exe. (Once again, this is usually the case, though some games come with a separate installer from the Crack-er, which has to be used instead of the normal Setup.exe. However, I have only seen this in one game so far, Shogun 2 Total War.)

2.	Once setup is running, it should ask for a CD Key or Product Key. It appears to me that this should be in the Serial.txt file of the relevant folder. (Once again, havenâ€™t actually got the game yet ïŠ.) Find the serial number and input it.

3.	Continue with the installation and notice where the program is being installed to (the installation directory).

4.	Once the installation has successfully completed, open up the installation directory. (Normally, games install to C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86).)

5.	Now open the Crack folder (in a new window), and copy and paste (or drag) its entire contents to the installation directory. (Sometimes, though this doesnâ€™t work as the systemâ€™s main files are located in a subfolder, called something like â€œSystemâ€ or â€œbinâ€. If you are pasting to the right location though, you should get a confirmation asking if you would like to overwrite. Select â€œYesâ€ or â€œOkâ€ as applicable.

6.	Now the game is installed and cracked and should hopefully be working.

7.	Start the game.

8.	After youâ€™re sure that the game itself is working fine, proceed to install the expansions in the same way. (Two notes here. First, if youâ€™ve already started playing and donâ€™t want to lose the game, make a backup. No harm done either way if you do. Second, some games, like the old, but still awesome, Zoo Tycoon 2, need you to install the expansions in a specific order. Iâ€™m not sure about this one. Just to be safe, though, I recommend you do a quick Googling session and find out the order of release and install in that order, with the one released earliest first and the latest one last.)

9.	If anything goes wrong, comment below, I am bookmarking this page for a month or two.

NB: Please make sure that you do not install any updates without ensuring that a crack is available first. You can usually do this by googling â€œSims 3 Crack xâ€, replacing the x with the patch number, like 1.1.13, etc. Once again, if you are unsure, donâ€™t patch, comment below and Iâ€™ll try to help.

PS. I'm sort of a scatterbrain, so if the communtiy can spot a mistake or something I have missed out, please comment.

Spread the love,

,Artist-8,2011-06-19T02:17Z,"Sorry for the double post, but for some reason, the quotes that I put in to help identify folder, etc, were replaced with â€. So wherever, you see that pretend it's quotes, or alternatively, copy and paste in word, edit > find (or ctrl-f), find and replace, find â€, replace with quotes and replace all. 

Thanks,

,lupinmodz,2011-07-19T14:30Z,does it need updates? and what is the installation order?

,TheSpidr,2011-08-18T20:57Z,it says disk authorization failure when i try 2 play aftr it loads wat do i do???
,NiteLite2,2011-09-03T05:19Z,I've got the same problem as Spidr...
,NiteLite2,2011-09-03T10:53Z,"Fixed it, for some reason it just didn't copy the crack right or something the first time I did it...If anyone else gets the same message all you have to do is copy the ts3.exe from the crack folder to the ...game\bin folder, and then it runs just fine.  Oh, and make sure you're replacing the file not having both the original and cracked exe file."
,Refantasy,2011-09-09T23:03Z,"Hey, I used Daemon Tools to install it, updated it, and I replaced the TS3 file with the one provided.  Everything seemed to be working fine, but once I actually got into the game itself, it tells me that it can't authorize that I'm using an actual disc (which I'm obviously not) and to contact customer service.  Any help?

By the way, this works perfectly up until this.  No viruses, and it downloaded in about a day.  Wonderful.  (:"
