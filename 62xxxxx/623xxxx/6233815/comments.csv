,murdagunz,2011-03-11T17:06Z,"Why do people say Bulletstorm had a dash update?
It didnt have a dash update. It was confirmed on ixtreme forums,plus it didnt ask me to update and I play the game almost daily.

Also, ABGX will not verify or patch this until the official release on the 15th...or a lil bit after."
,murdagunz,2011-03-11T17:09Z,"And thanks swelog for a dope share.

Also, anyone playing this before the 15th risk getting flagged and banned if its not patched and u dont have LT+...but in all cases modded console risk being banned anyway. So pls dont whine."
,AnonGuyz,2011-03-11T17:18Z,Still downloading got the torrent yesterday when it was only 40 minutes old. and at 49.4%
,AnonGuyz,2011-03-11T17:19Z,and just curious has anyone actually tried it out to see if it works and is safe to play on xbox live
,clo239,2011-03-11T17:48Z,"@black_shadow_1981 

where do you get your disc's I but mine off of ebay 17.75 for a pack of 10 verbatim.

And i think it's 18 plus tax at Best buy for a pack of 5!"
,black_shadow_1981,2011-03-11T18:08Z,"im in the uk i use 25 packs of Verbatim they have a lovely white disc finish to them and i have over 70 backups without any coasters, never had any at all, i pay about Â£22 (thats about $40 i think) i use play uk

its not just the cost its all the work that gos into haveing to rip the disc again add patch blah blah and reburn just to get around a new dash!

i guess thats the cost of getting free games i know i still come up ontop in the end.... so many people out there paying for 360 games like $80 each! RIPOFF"
,black_shadow_1981,2011-03-11T18:41Z,"this dash update on here must be the same as the one found on Dragon age 2 because i didnt have to update when i put this game in

if you updated your dash for dragon age 2 then you shouldnt have to for homefront

ive played about 10mins of homefront and it seems damn epic, the opeing movie is AMAZING it shows a timeline of stuff leadding up to 2027 (i will not say anymore because i dont want to give anything way)"

Aone Gold Edition Dual Layer DVD+R DL 8X 8.5GB Discs

Never a coaster! always burns fine using imgburn and the best thing is they cost 7 pounds 59 pence on ebay! next day delivery!

,DJ_SEVEN,2011-03-12T04:02Z,"Bulletstorm has an update, depending on what dash or firmware ur useing!"
,IMUSA73,2011-03-12T07:27Z,"Bottom line on all these Xbox360 games you download... and I have been doing this for a long ass time... 

JTagged - Download and play it! Because you are probably banned or blocking xbox live anyways! 

JungleFlashed Custom Firmware - Download it and then run it throught the ABGX.net GUI app and launch it through that... let it download correct files/patches and write them to your .iso
Then do it once more just to be sure everything went through... all text should be green when it scans it... you can skip the game crc scan the 2nd time if it was good the first run didn't show yellow/red text results... After that you are good to go!

PAY ATTENTION!!!!!  If  the game has not been released to retail...  and you don't want to get banned from Xbox Live... just wait!!! Damn, you are getting the game for FREE! So just freaking WAIT!  or disable xboxlive and play it and risk some flag getting logged to your console key and when one day you get the famous Microsoft Your Banned message... don't cry to mommy for a new Xbox or try calling MS... because you are stuck like Chuck!!! Anyways!! Hope this clears it up...

Oh and for the people that have never downloaded a game online and don't have a modded Xbox360... forget about playing the game altogether unless you plan on modding your box... 

Plunder and SEED! ARRRRRR!

Peace"

,blazeon420,2011-03-12T16:07Z,if you use live i wouldnt put this in my console as it may get banned during next wave. wait till released.
,IMUSA73,2011-03-12T18:51Z,"It's normal for updates in popular games... for instance, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has updates all the time... My console has a flashed lite-on 93450 and my xboxlive has been working fine with it... Just make sure you read my comment about using ABGX.net app for patching games with the correct waves, video files, etc.  and you are good to go.. if you see ANY yellow text I would not run it... unless you just skipped the Game CRC check/scan.. if you did it once and it found and scanned the game ok then you can skip it... 

More than likely this game will be ready to play the same day it is released!"

,midgr,2011-03-12T21:42Z,Can somebody show me how to make this game wave 2?
,Mr.T_3,2011-03-12T23:01Z,"@nilu4u 

release 15th march is right mate. I wait till release for my games to make sure they have the right updates on abgx so i don't get banned so i always read my release dates to be sure."
,Mr.T_3,2011-03-12T23:13Z,And UK release the 18thMarch.
,Mr.T_3,2011-03-13T00:01Z,"I know alot of people will already know this buy for those that don't or think they know but don't have a clue really and for all those saying they been downloading games an playing them on live for ages an think they know everythin guess what you don't because just like the new AP 2.5 software running in the game video files now, they don't tell you when there gonna use new software to catch people out so their is no way you could know about it.
Unless you work for microsoft or a game developer that uses the software for stopping us pirating games so don' try give advice on it coz it's all under false pretense.
Now if you just wait till the release dates then run the games in abgx they will update the files for the games yes but then if their is a full dash update then you would then have to run the games through abgx again before playing them on new dash updated consoles to make sure they have the right files again for the new dash updates.
And this doesn't mean evertime u get a game update this is just for the dash updates as in the new kinect dash that was released before christmas.

For example and i know alot of people will already have pointed this one out, Halo reach was one of the first games to have AP2.5 software but come out a while before the new dash, this is one sure way to catch alot of people out because you won't realise it till it's mentioned somewhere or you try play the game and it blacks the screen out but that is how it's done, Flagged xbox. Simple as that.
Microsoft and game development company's aint just gonna sit back and watch their money float out the window while we reap the benefits of free gaming "
,Mr.T_3,2011-03-13T00:18Z,"Sorry for the previous essay, just annoyin when people brag an give false info. Like it's difficult to copy games

@ fanfasnight

Check your gamertag pref see if that particular gamertag has auto sign in activated, this sounds like the problem your having. And no matter what console you recover the gamertag on the pref always stays the same. Hope this helps"
,fanfasnight,2011-03-13T02:02Z,"Mr.T_3 thank you but it was off the sign in. No idea why this not working , it doesnt make any sense. Its the only game that freezes with when im sign in and  if play with different acount in the same console works . And that gamertag works fine with all other games but not homefront . this is just stupid"

,Mr.T_3,2011-03-13T12:29Z,"@ fanfasnight

That is a weird one mate, This usually only occurs when the game update is not available from xbox live but that would have to have live active for this to stop working like that. Same with the AP25 does the same thing thats why it's always best to wait till release date for all the abgx stealth/patch files.

@ nilu4u

The waves are the different files they use to catch out piracy basically, for example the latest wave is 11 - AP25. "

,Chr1ll337,2011-03-15T17:42Z,"@xboxroberto0125

No, you wont get banned if you use ABGX properly! Maybe you have been banned but that's just cuz ur shit, kid! Get raped! :D"
,Milner132,2011-03-15T17:59Z,"@Chr1ll337

HAHA YOU KNOW THIS!


But, in all seriousness yall, its always a good idea if theres a new dash update to not install it unless your sure its not anti-piracy.

abgx, when used effectively with the latest LT firmware, stops you from getting banned."
,coolguymandude,2011-03-15T19:52Z,well the game works THANK YOU..but my god it kinda sucks ..it is fun at times but if you are low on dvd's just wait for crysis 2...
,acidbrown,2011-03-15T20:41Z,"Hey.
Downloaded and burned.
When trying to run i only get the white screen with the Xbox logo. I have not updated the dashboard..could it be that´s what´s causing it not to load the game?"
,MmMmarsh,2011-03-15T20:43Z,does anybody know if it works on live it says its not on the abgx database or somthing
,MmMmarsh,2011-03-15T20:45Z,does it work on live w/o getting banned i ran it through abgx says its not on abgx datbase or somting
,tommen_h,2011-03-15T21:12Z,"Hi guys!

I have a modded xbox with LT-firmware (Not LT+). I have installed the uptdate on Bulletstorm, and got asked again for Homefront...

Will my console get banned from either games /update? 

Haven't dared to go live since AP2.5 was announced. 

Am i ""Safe"" or fucked?

Thanks!"
,murdagunz,2011-03-15T23:04Z,"No verified fix yet in ABGX...be patient. I here bad reviews anyway,but I would still like to play it cause Black Ops sucks ass and i've been playin MW2 lately in its place. 

I might actually like it. 16 vs 16 is dope. I like MOH and BFBC2 cause of the fact the maps are huge, but dont like traveling 5 minutes just to get in the battle lmaoo.

Also, if you box is not banned and u play this game on or offline...you will be flagged for ban unless ABGX comes with a patch soon. Also check out Xval to see if your flagged yet."

,MmMmarsh,2011-03-16T00:34Z,i tested my luck and thankfully it worked!! i was also playing mw2 cuz black ops is awful and i like it better than both of them.

,machgnr0331,2011-04-03T22:56Z,works great on live and everything. You have to buy a battle code which is 800 ms points but better than spending $60 on game. Better than black ops. Thanks

and u r done : )"
,GigaBoii,2011-04-10T01:15Z,"HA! Homefront IS NOT better than black ops. I dont even think its better than COD2 or 3 HAHAHAHA! This game blows. But worth downloading (and seeding!) to play... might be one of those games I never play until a friend requests me in a session. Other than that, I'd rather play BBC2, or Crysis 2... "
