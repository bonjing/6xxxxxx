Part 3. Vanilla and Saffron.
Kate's journey takes her from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco to the plains of Spain as she uncovers the story of the world's most expensive spice, saffron, before crossing the Atlantic to Mexico, in search of Vanilla, a spice discovered by the most famous Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes. In the Atlas Mountains, October is saffron harvest month for the Berber people. Kate joins local saffron farmer Ahmed and his family to harvest their crop.

She witnesses a spectacular death defying fertility dance and meets the people determined to keep Mexican vanilla alive in the face of the massive competition from other producers.
