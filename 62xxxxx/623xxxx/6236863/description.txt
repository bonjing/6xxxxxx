Often billed as the next generation of the Laurel Canyon sound, rootsy quartet Dawes evoke the spirit of their predecessors by matching acoustic-based music reminiscent of the Band or Harvest-era Neil Young with Byrds/Crosby, Stills & Nash-like vocal harmonies and lyrics that aspire to poetry. The quartet's debut album, North Hills (named for the group's Los Angeles area hometown, which is only 20 minutes away from Laurel Canyon), was recorded almost entirely live in the studio to 2" analog tape, an approach perfectly suited to the combo's earthy sound.
