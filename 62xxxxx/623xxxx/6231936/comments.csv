,narklo,2011-05-09T21:57Z,"For those coming here, the ISO works in PCSX2, but it's missing a LOT of audio. You still get the menu music and the fighting impact sounds, but ALL voicework is completely gone, and there's no music during fights. It's pretty impressive that this entire game was stuffed in 100mb, but overall I highly recommend you spend another hour or so downloading http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4490678/Dragon.Ball.Z.Infinite.World.NTSC.PS2DVD-STRiKE"
