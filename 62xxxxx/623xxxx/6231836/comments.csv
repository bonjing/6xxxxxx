,luis_yudul,2011-03-10T05:42Z,this is the real thing!
,rspeed,2011-03-10T08:44Z,"luis_yudul claims this is the real thing, but for him to know that he'd have to have downloaded it.

His comment was left 15 minutes after the torrent was uploaded. Additionally, there is currently only one seeder.

This leaves three options:

1. luis_yudul is the uploader and his opinion can't be trusted (and the file is likely a scam).
2. luis_yudul hasn't really downloaded the file.
3. Both luis_yudul and the original seeder have absurdly fast internet connections (~38 Mbps), but luis is an ass and didn't seed.

If you finish downloading and it asks you to fill out a survey to get a password, the file is absolutely a scam."
