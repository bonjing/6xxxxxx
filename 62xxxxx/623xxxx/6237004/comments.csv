,Yamcha67,2011-03-15T17:40Z,"There is a retail version of the game for Mac OS.. It was released a while back.. Infact I've downloaded it, but there is no serial or crack :(.. can't play it"
,Purt303,2011-03-22T06:33Z,"This was a real bummer. This thing downloaded great and the first time i started it up it went to black screen and complete computer freeze. Then it WORKED PERFECTLY, the graphics sounds everything worked amazing and then i went to get Carl a haircut for a mission and u can buy anything it says it SPACE bar to buy and you do, but that only scrolls the diff options. Please get this fixed because like it said while i was playing it was FLAWLESS. I give up on gta for mac/PC for now...."
