Amstrad Action Issues 1-117 complete (October 1985 - June 1995)

Amstrad Action was Future Publishing's first magazine, dedicated to the
CPC range of home computers. And it definitely was NOT an official
Amstrad publication.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on
public Torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used, and some of the horrendous colour
schemes in the later issues. The relatively low DPI of the source images
doesn't help either, and paragraph formatting is a bit random at best;
again, this is worse in the later issues.

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please checkfor more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and everyone on the WoS forums for help and
advice.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
