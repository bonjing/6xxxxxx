,Whoapaw,2011-03-12T17:31Z,"Did you rip this yourself? I ask this because it does not really sound like 320 kbps. I have a 320kbps version of 'Heart in Your Heartbreak', and the drums sound much better in that version, than they do in this download. I hope you did not just reconvert the 128kbps from the online stream into crappy 320kbps files..."
