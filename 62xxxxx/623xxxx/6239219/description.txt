The delicate essence of a nu pop-rock with authoral vein, is the main theme of these songs in the new upcoming â€œI Already Love Youâ€, by the ex-Devics singer Sara Lov.
Peace and sweetness wrapped in a box full of hypnotical and seductive sounds, that come from the artistâ€™s past experience in dream-pop with his mate Dustin Oâ€™Halloran from 1998.
Sara mixes the soft and typical sounds from eterea world of Cocteau Twins, and in tis second solo album (after the 2009 â€œSeasoned Eyes Were Beamingâ€ supported by Zac Rae â€“ Fiona Apple, Macy Gray, Gnarls Barkley -), trie sto explain love a sit should be, filled with empathy and intimate dreamy suggestions, recreating, in that cover collection, from Black Heart Processionâ€™s â€œSquare Heartâ€, to Ron Sexsmithâ€™s â€œJust My Heart Talkingâ€, flying from country to dream-pop itself, also covering Patti Pravoâ€™s â€œLa Bambolaâ€ and Magnetic Fieldsâ€™ â€œPapa Was A Rodeoâ€ and the masterpiece â€œThere Is A Light That Never Goes Outâ€ from The Smiths.
Positive in creating and covering too, pointing out that kind of kindness, almost lost today.
Precious!
