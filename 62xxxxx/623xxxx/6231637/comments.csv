[V],mkvGOD,2011-03-11T23:38Z,"@petrpan004

I plan on doing a lot of TV, to list them all would take too long. I will also keep up to date with all the shows I've posted so far, by releasing the entire season when it is finished. So sit tight. I also take requests!

@ALL

I will be extremely busy this week so I will not upload anything else until at least Sunday March 20th. But lots to come after then!

In the mean time I hope you all are enjoying the uploads.

Remember to Seed!!!!"
,dkhere,2011-03-12T03:04Z,"@mkvGOD: I think we have enough to watch March 20th...
Hope you will start uploading after 20th...
And thanks for all the uploads..."

notify plzz"
,MasterFuse,2011-06-25T14:43Z,Appalling video quality. Complete waste of a download. I'll see if one of the others is any better.
,pjsmoke,2011-06-27T01:25Z,"Yeah, if you plan to download this and keep it in your collection it's not worth it...the video bitrate is much to low, however it's watchable from a distance.

This torrent would of been great if it had a much highter bitrate to accommodate the 900p resolution. 

I hope he re-uploads an improved torrent, similar to his Sons of Anarchy, Rome and others.

So basically, if you love this show wait a while or ask mkvgod to upload a better quality version of The 4400.

I have asked but he hasn't responded, so who knows.

Anyway, end rant."
,pjsmoke,2011-06-27T01:28Z,"Oh I forgot, mkvgod reuploaded a hugely improved Jericho that is excellant...so download that before it dies, low seeds."
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-29T19:05Z,redownloading now. will reup in the near future

,Giri20,2011-11-23T18:29Z,@Lee sharp: Install k-lite mega codec pack and play it in media player classic :P 
,Giri20,2011-11-23T18:32Z,"@mkvGOD: Please try to re-upload a different print of 'The 4400', even 720p like the 'Shameless' or 'Dead Like Me' will be awesome. This one cannot be viewed with any satisfaction. Video bitrate is too low on this one."
