,plush2,2011-05-31T19:22Z,"I pity those who can't appreciate this film (and even brag about this in the comments). Its silliness, humor, kafkaesque absurdity, its explicit and implicit self-ironic breakings of the fourth wall all make for great, unusual filmmaking. Rubber is well worth seeing in HD as it's also exceptionally beautifully shot.

Another plus: I didn't know anything about this film before I watched it, so when I read ""Roxane Mesquida"" in the opening credits, I was very pleasantly surprised.

If you consider yourself a dummy who is likely to complain that ""Booo, dude, I totally, like, don't get the plot or whatever"", don't watch this film or you'll be bored, even though there's the occasional graphically exploding head thrown in for good measure.

Thanks a bucket to the uploader."
