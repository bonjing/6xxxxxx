http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War_%28Machiavelli%29

Conclusion: check the sources before claiming something stupid!"
,TawnyL,2011-03-15T21:52Z,"dont matter who wrote what, you cant listen to this crap anyways"
,DragonKP,2011-03-16T17:32Z,"So do not download and get lost. This ""crap@ for you is treasure for other people.

By the way - this place is NOT your fucking property so take your miserable complaints somewhere else (I suggest publish them on the wall of your own WC)

Another agent provocateur ??? "
,DragonKP,2011-04-01T05:43Z,"And thank you stryde2101 for nice comment. As you probably see I try to add knowledge to this place, and keep it parasite free. Unfortunately those internet ID squads payed from some small country close to sea near Europe are trying to do what they can to discredit them. Therefore I suggest for them books of Victor Ostrovski - look at DragonKP logo."
