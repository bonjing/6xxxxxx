,mzuks,2011-03-24T08:34Z,Any1 knw how to increase speed of torrent downloads tried most of the things online but there is no significant change in speed. have a slow internet speed and usually download at 30kB/s but this is downloading at btw 0.1-0.2KB/s
,polarhawk,2011-03-24T18:05Z,"the game asks if it should upgrade my console as soon as i load it. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid, but will this block my xbox due to AP 2.5? And if it does, will I still be able to play my old backups afterwards?"
,JustinV77,2011-04-05T14:39Z,lol homefront sucked balls
