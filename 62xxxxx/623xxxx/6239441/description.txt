Kidnapper (ç»‘åŒª Bangfei) is a 2010 Singaporean thriller film about a kidnap set in Singapore. The first action-thriller film made by Kelvin Tong, it was a joint venture between Scorpio East Pictures of Singapore and RAM Pictures and PMP Entertainment from Malaysia.[1] Tong opted for a thriller film as opposed to an full-fledged action film as he felt this was more realistic in Singapore saying "people here (in Singapore) don't run around with machine guns".[2]
