Kundaliniâ€“the energy of eros that lies at the base of the spineâ€“can be overwhelming once activated. Times of activation coincide with the key astrological passages of Saturn, Uranus, and Chiron in oneâ€™s birth chart and are often experienced as periods of spiritual emergency, confusion, and imbalance.

In Liquid Light of Sex, Barbara Hand Clow opens up new dimensions for understanding what occurs during these key life passages, which most of us experience three times in our lives. In the authorâ€™s words, â€œwe form at age 30, we transform at age 40, and we transmute at age 50.â€ Focusing on the transformation at age 40â€“the time of imbalance and spiritual confusion often referred to as the â€œmidlife crisisâ€â€“she explores how kundalini energy, the liquid light of sex, can be creatively channeled by unblocking the chakras. Offering effective methods for achieving physical, emotional, and spiritual growth during this important life passage, Liquid Light of Sex presents a roadmap for using celestial cycles to navigate positively and productively in times of great life change................
