RELEASE INFO:
This 2-CD soundtrack was released Oct. 30, 2007, and features various artists covering nearly three-dozen Bob Dylan songs. Please understand that the songs used in the film of the same name were for the most part the actual Bob Dylan recordings, whereas the songs in this torrent are covers (save one). As best as I can remember, very few of these cover versions were used in the movie ("When The Ship Comes In" is one exception that comes to mind; there may be others). I'm not positive if every song below is featured in the film (though a great many are), but conversely there are definitely some songs in the film that are not represented on the album ("Visions Of Johanna" being one obvious example). It's best to think of this album, released three weeks ahead of the film, as a musical tribute to accompany the film's release. And it succeeds in being one of the finest collections of Dylan covers ever, though many leave me yearning for the genuine article. Check out Cat Power's version of "Stuck Inside Of Mobile", it's excellent; Willie also does a nice job with "Senor".

Most notable is that this album features the first official release of the long-bootlegged song "I'm Not There 1956" which Dylan recorded with The Band during the infamous Basement Tapes sessions in mid-1967. It is the only recording on the album actually performed by Dylan (a cover version by Sonic Youth is also included). The "1956" that follows the song's title is as much a mystery as the song itself.
