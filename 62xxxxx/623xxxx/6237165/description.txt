Product Description

The Hollywood Trainer AB BLAST is what you've been waiting for - 20 minutes of the most effective, functional and challenging ab exercises to deliver the ultimate mid-section! In this super ab routine, you will target all areas of the mid-section: rectus abdominus (the six pack), internal and external obliques, transverse abdominus (the deep muscle that act as a corset pulling in your lower belly and supporting your lower back), erector spinae muscles (muscles which line the spine) and lumbar muscles (muscles of the lower back). This workout gives you everything you need to get the abs you've always dreamed of and challenges three major fitness components: muscular strength, muscular endurance and body composition (increase of lean body mass / decrease of body fat). You're on your way to the ultimate set of abs! Â· Sculpt and define abdominal muscles Â· Improve core strength and stability Â· Feel results after your first workout
