Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock is a solid A&R guy: He discovered Wolf Parade and SPIN faves Mimicking Birds. His latest discovery, Portland, OR-based psych-rock quintet Morning Teleportation, adds to his record with their debut album, Expanding Anyway, out March 8 via Brock's Glacial Pace Recordings. Listen to the entire LP below, exclusively via SPIN.com.

With their high-energy live performances and eclectic sound (banjo, talkbox, synthesizer, trumpet, theremin), the band built blogosphere buzz and rocked summer festivals including Bonnaroo. Their LP captures their essence onstage.

"Yelping and shouting like a genuine mental case, frontman Tiger Merritt rides a joyously chaotic wave on [the band's] debut," writes Jon Young in SPIN's album review, featured in our upcoming April issue. "Morning Teleportation possess their own wacky identity, lurching from avant-garde mischief to pop operatics to folk sweetness."
