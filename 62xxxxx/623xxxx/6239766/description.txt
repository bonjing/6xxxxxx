These are documentaries about accidents at Nuclear Power Plants. The following incidents are covered:

* Chernobyl, Ukraine
* Three Mile Island, US
* Windscale, UK

There are several documentaries about the first two, as they provide different viewpoints.

They come from various sources, and the image quality varies strongly, but I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. And of course, don't forget to seed, there are many people out there who want to watch them :)
