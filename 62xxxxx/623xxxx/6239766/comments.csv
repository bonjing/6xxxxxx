,Cobra001,2011-03-16T12:18Z,Why you don't seed?
,Zirrozify,2011-03-16T18:16Z,"I have been seeding this from start. I've had to pause all my other downloading and seeding activities to achieve the amazing speed of 80 KB/s, which means it will take a while. It appears several people now have a 100% of it, though. I'll seed this myself for a few more days and then go back to paying attention to my other torrents. I trust you guys in keeping this alive."

Gobachev's comments are interesting, if correct. I never thought that Moscow would have been so much in the dark immediately after the explosion. Did he truly need to send the KGB to Chernobyl to see what his own scientists were really thinking?  

I found them well worth a look. Enjoy."
