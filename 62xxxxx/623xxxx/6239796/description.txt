                             By The Name Of Allah

Sheikh Muhammad Ibn Saleh Ibn 'Uthaymeen said: I sincerely advise, myself first, and my Muslim brothers, especially the students of knowledge not to make haste and be quick when a new issue befalls a person until he verifies the situation, gains knowledge and then speaks, so that he does not speak about Allah without knowledge.
