 | "What a question! Of course the new THE  VERY END album  is |
 | awesome!  Otherwise   I wouldn't  have   done it!",  states |
 | legendary producer  Waldemar  Sorychta   (e.g.   Sentenced, |
 | Sodom, Moonspell, Tiamat,   Samael). And he is damn  right! |
 | Massive,  modern & unique  Ã» thrilling  songwriting and  an |
 | open minded interpretation   of modern  metal contribute to |
 | the  genuine  sound of THE VERY END's new   album "Mercy  & |
 | Misery"  as well as the    heavy,  yet always organic   and |
 | dynamic   mix of Sorychta and his partner  in crime, Dennis |
 | Koehne.                                                     |
