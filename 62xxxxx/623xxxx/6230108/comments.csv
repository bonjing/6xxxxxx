Oh yeah the Carlos del Junco concert was great. He had the harmonica sounding like a bagpipe doing Amazing Grace. Another song he did ""My Laptop"". My other friend did not realize at first that the guitarist and stand-up bass player stopped playing. All the sounds where just him playing with the drummer playing light brush. He played blues,jazz,swing,country gospel and other styles.
Thanks again for everything!!!! :P) "
