,Master2873,2011-10-17T15:56Z,"I have one complaint so far. How about you put the file information up on the site. It shouldn't be a picture that's going to be gone later anyways like it is now. Also if a majority of the information is in the NFO file all you do is open it up in notepad, and hit CTRL+A, than you hit CTRL+C, then you go to your browser window and hit CTRL+V. Viola! If one is that lazy I just made it easier on you."
