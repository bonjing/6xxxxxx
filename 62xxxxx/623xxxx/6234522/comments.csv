,jacksteffel,2011-05-07T09:59Z,"Great idea, even with corpses and rejects.  FiancĂŠe mad me take rejects out when they pulled the chick from the shower; never have seen the rest.  Corpses wasn't bad for a debut, but the halloweens were impressive and enveloping.  "
,jacksteffel,2011-05-07T10:00Z,"How do you upload?  Do you use laptop w/ wireless, so you remain untraced?    I haven't finished downloading yet, but this seems to be the most interesting fan edit I've heard of in three years.  This is the only reason I ask: If I sent you an avi, would you upload it for me?
Thank you.
