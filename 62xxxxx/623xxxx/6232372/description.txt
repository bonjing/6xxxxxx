
Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle

Region: US
Language: English

Tested and working on PSP-2000 (6.20 TN-D) + Prometheus Iso Loader v1.

Instructions:

Extract game-iso from archive to ISO directory on your Memory Stick. This can be done using WinRAR, 7-Zip or Total Commander.

This game IS NOT PATCHED so most likely it will work on prometheus firmwares only, aswell as on latest 6.20/6.35 firmwares with respective tools.

And remember these files are for the custom firmwares ONLY!

Enjoy & Have fun! :)
