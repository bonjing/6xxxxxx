experience,the picture image will alternate
between 2.35:1 and 1.78:1 aspect ratios.
The black matte bars on your screen
will adjust accordingly

Please check the screens and sample before downloading..
If you like to download/encode/upload and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Thank you"
