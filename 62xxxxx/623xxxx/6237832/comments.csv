but I appreciate the upload nonetheless."

,WhiskeyKid,2011-07-18T22:26Z,"Wow...lotsa books, zzolee30.  While most are not necessarily Geographic in nature, the ones that are are pretty good picks.  Thanks for the huge upload!

If you don't want to download 18GB of books that you aren't looking for, you can always pretend it's like a yard sale; just pick out what you want.  

@empo0411, Files-->(1109)-->Ctrl+F-->Discovering Physical Geography...No."
,gwrgwir,2012-02-17T23:02Z,"Thanks for the ups, m8.  Looks to be around half actual geo/related, but those that are, are solid."
,gr33nday,2012-03-23T19:41Z,Hey! Nice collection. Though I would recommend to re-seed under a different name as not many books here are on geography.
