Storyline: Alex Rogan lives in a trailer court where his mother is manager and everyone is
like a big extended family. He beats the Starfighter Video Game to the applause of everyone
in the court and later that day finds he has been turned down for a student loan for college.
Depressed, he meets Centauri, who introduces himself as a person from the company that made
the Game, before Alex really knows what is going on he is on the ride of his life in a "car"
flying thru space. Chosen to take the skills he showed on the video game into real combat to
protect the galaxy from an invasion. Alex gets as far as the Starfighter base before he really
realized that he was conscripted and requests to be taken back home. When he gets back home,
he finds a Zan-Do-Zan (Alien Bounty Hunter) is stalking him. Unable to go home and live, Alex
returns to the Starfighter base to find all the pilots have been killed and he is the galaxy's
only chance to be saved from invasion...
