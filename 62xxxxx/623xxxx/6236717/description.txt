The first seven of the albumâ€™s nine tracks were recorded live in San Luis Obispo, Californiaâ€™s Fremont Theater during three nights in March 1996.  The last two tracks are studio recordings of new compositions recorded in November 1995 (with subsequent overdubs and post-production lasting into 1996). 

The last time Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Alan White had worked together on officially released studio recordings was 1978's Tormato.

Awaken is one of my favorite compositions.  Its performed here in its entirety and is excellent as always.  Wakemans Pipe Organ is recorded well and with the right playback equipment will loosen your floorboards.......!
