
In the last few years Latin music, new and old, has started to move back into the popular consciousness and onto hip dance floors. This alburn brings together eleven much sought after dance-floor fillers from the TICO and FANIA labels. They could all loosely be described
as LATIN SOUL.
LATIN SOUL was a movement that started in 1962 and was in full glorious flourish between 1966 and 1969. It introduced the WATUSI, BOOGALOO, PACHANGA, JALA JALA and a host of minor dance crazes. Although the roots of the music lay in Puerto Rico and Cuba, It finally burst out of New York, a noisy brash expression of teenage experience. Î› genuine mix of traditional Latin rhythms and Black Soul and R'nB resulted in a powerful dance beat, breaking many of the rules of Latin orthodoxy: using lyrics often sung in English, a horn section using two trombones, and laying them against an accentuated back beat straight from R'n'B.
The young Bugulu turks of Spanish Harlem were not simply copying Black Music but were creating a genuine new style, an upwardly mobile mix up through the melt-down of musical barriers. (from liner notes)
