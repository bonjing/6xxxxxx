Whether you are a Happy Monster Band fan or a Tally Hall fan, I think you\'ll like this. I am huge Tally Hall fan and own all of their songs. When I found out that they did the music for the kids show Happy Monster Band, I was pretty excited. Anyway, I used youtube clips from the show to make MP3s of the songs featured. Enjoy!

Support this band by going out and buying all of their albums!
