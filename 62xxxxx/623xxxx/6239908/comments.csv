Just because you have seen worse does not mean they have seen worse. and I like how you are talking shit about there a/v review, and you don't even give one. SoftWarez is a trusted uploader, so i am sure hes not a ""spoiled"" leech. Next time put more time into giving a a/v review before talking shit to another (and i am not even downloading it cause I only download 8 and up a/v). If you call that spoiled, I call that patient for a better copy. 

 Thank you to the people actually giving a review."
,Kronical4,2011-03-15T03:09Z,"@D335T0 

 And one more thing, so you can learn about a TS a/v review, just because it's a ""v-9 a-8"" for a TS does not mean it's a badass copy it means it's a good high def cam copy, still not a dvd copy, so when you review a TS it's strictly a review based on a cam copy. Which i am sure seeing how this movie just came out it's prob. a horrible copy."
,Randy47sm,2011-03-15T03:27Z,sound and movies out of sink. Turn the sound off if you want to watch it.
,Randy47sm,2011-03-15T03:31Z,Sound and movie are not in sink

Audio - 2 secs out of sync, 2 channel 1/10

,cryskonig,2011-03-17T01:57Z,"To all of the ""flick bitchers"" out there, I actually saw this in the theater and it flickered like a bitch on the big screen too. More rushed Hollywood crap."
,anderson444,2011-03-18T04:09Z,"I would wait for a better copy. 

Nice try but the flickering and out of sink audio is just too bad for me.

Thanks anyway."
,Drake9669,2011-03-18T20:19Z,"If the audio is so far off, you can use VLC media player. You can change the sync of the audio/video so that it plays right. It's the only media player I use when I download these cams and DVD rips."
,DemonicArc,2011-03-19T20:25Z,"Hey SoftWarez, thank you for letting me know it's Telesync, I would never have guessed from the god damn telesync tag in the god damn title of the fucking torrent, so shut the fuck up you piece of retarded shit, you're not being either informative or fucking clever by saying telesyinc has telesync quality, you're just being a fucking counterwhore."
,raidensolid,2011-03-22T15:47Z,"hey!!! people who doesn't satisfy and give a god damn bad comment here..go watch movie on cinema why give a bad comment,they just sharing what they got to share to people.@ softwarez,kronical4 FUCK OFF!!!!!
