Installed ""cIOS Installer Xr21"" on ios249 with base ios58 and then Mighty Loader - and it started!"

can you give us a little hint about what you said? is there any guide to do that? i've downloaded 4 isos and nothing worked.... "
,azazeal90,2011-06-15T13:20Z,"THIS MIGHT HELP YOU FIX IT-------------------------

I used ""cIOSX_rev21"" and chose IOS 249. Then the ""IOS 58 v????"" and installed it on IOS 249. 

I used Mighty Loader v 15 to play. But this action made the USB Loader GX unable to start. 

Same with Coverfloader

IMPORTANT: if you do this fix you'll have to use Mighty Loader. "
