Website:

- Sonye.Theme.v1.1
- Sonye.Theme.v2.1
- Optional: QTTabBar (Tabs for Windows Explorer)
- Optional: Manual Modders, i include Tools and all images used. :)

Compatible: Windows 7, Windows 7 SP1, x32, x64.

Synopsis: 
Are you using or a fan of the Extreme Aero Themes but notice there are problems
with viewing in some applications? Well, here's your fix! This theme provides
just enough tweaks to please the eyes, but not too much where it causes any
ill-effects with viewing or performance. 

NOTE: Sonye Theme v2.1 is the latest release, both work flawlessly and are 
beautiful. The versions vary slightly only in appearance. Both versions offer
multiple colors to choose from with matching colors for system files :)

* I updated both Sonye themes to support Windows 7 SP1 and both x32/x64.
* I also include all images used for the manual modders.

QTTabBar is optional but i don't see why you wouldn't use it. Windows Explorer
without tabs is just not right. I provided a preview of this.

Enjoy
