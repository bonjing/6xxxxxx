Those are just some suggestions from the list of B&N free 7-day-trial titles....I tried to pick the more expensive ones that I thought other people on here might be interested in!  

If you do manage to crack and upload any of them, I would be very grateful!!!

I don't know how many requests like this you are getting, but I tried to pick out general-interest titles...."
