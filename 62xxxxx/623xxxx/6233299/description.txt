Description:

This review is from: The Jesus Movie: Read and Share DVD Bible (DVD)

My 3.5 year old daughter absolutely LOVES this movie. We had talked a lot about Jesus before watching it, but not much about the crucifixion. This was a great introduction to it! We sat and watched the movie with her for the first few times, and she asked many questions during (and since). It's definitely gotten her thinking! It is perfect for preschoolers, as it is not a gory depiction of the crucifixion, yet gets the point across. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with toddler/preschool age children who is wanting to spur them on towards Jesus.

JESUS:

Born of a Virgin, he was killed for our transgressions, his blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live with the Lord in Eternity.


RAPtURE  (My transportation outta here.)

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
