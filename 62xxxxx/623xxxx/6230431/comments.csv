,Robin5555,2011-03-09T22:42Z,"I have all the film directed by Oscar Winner Well Known Famous Director Satyajit Roy.

The main story written by another great writer Munshi Premchand.

It's Satyajit Ray's only one movie direction in Hindi language.

Sanjeev Kumar & Saeed Jaffrey they are the brilliant performers & played superbly in the movie.

The massage delivered in that movie is also relevant till now although we got the freedom over 60 years or so.

A must must watch film, great up SIRJI ! many many thanks for this.

LONG LIVE malikjee & TPB !
