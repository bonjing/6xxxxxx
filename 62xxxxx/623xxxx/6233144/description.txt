Arthropods are the most numerous and diverse group of animals and studying these organisms requires the use of specialized equipment and specific procedures. This
text describes effective methods and equipment for collecting, identifying, rearing, examining, and preserving insects and mites, and for storing and caring for specimens in collections. It also provides instructions for the construction of many kinds of collecting equipment, traps, rearing cages, and storage units, as well as updated and illustrated keys for identification of the classes of arthropods and the orders of insects.
