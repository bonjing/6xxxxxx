,xONE2NVx,2011-03-12T20:47Z,AGBX stealth patches games so that you can play them on XBOX Live
,Chr1ll337,2011-03-12T21:22Z,"Yes, I know that but, ehm, I use ABGX everytime I'm going to burn XBox 360 games and it works flawlessly so why do I need to download this?"
,xONE2NVx,2011-03-12T21:54Z,"different games have different ""waves"" most common Wave 4,6, & 9. AGBX only comes stock with Waves 1-4."
