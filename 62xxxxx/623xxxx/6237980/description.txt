    Jamie tries to address the issue of discipline head-on     
    with the kids, which includes banning mobile phones in    
    lessons.                                                 
                                                              
    New teacher Alastair Campbell thinks he can get 20         
    apathetic kids excited about politics by showing how      
    they can change the world, but his lessons in how to     
    argue spill outside the classroom.                        
                                                               
    Having got off to a rocky start with the kids, David      
    Starkey has a showdown with Jamie, which leads to a      
    fresh beginning, and turns for advice to one of his       
    fellow teachers: the results impress the students, as      
    well as the head teacher.                                 
                                                             
    Simon Callow hopes that a contemporary twist on Romeo     
    and Juliet and a trip to the theatre will bring the        
    students round to Shakespeare, but conflict ensues.       
                                                             
    Meanwhile, photographer Rankin hopes that personalising   
    their portraits will help the students to reveal           
    something about themselves.                               
                                                             
    And Jazzie B's tough but fair style seems to be winning   
    over converts among the previously unengaged kids.
