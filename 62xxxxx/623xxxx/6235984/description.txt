Music : Rock : Lossless
These are the complete official release versions of the concerts used to make the legendary "Made In Japan" album. This set has been assembled from several sources. The main concerts are from the "Live In Japan" 3CD set. On that set several songs are missing in order to fit each show on one CD. On a computer there are no such time restrictions, so I rebuilt the shows to be complete. The music released on the original version of "Made In Japan" is here taken from the DCC Gold disc release. Also used was the bonus encores disc from the remastered version of "Made In Japan" and the one remaining missing track from the "Listen, Learn, Read On" box set. I originally created this set in December 2007 from mp3 sources, but this is an entirely new remake from all lossless sources done in 2011. I've seen all these sources compiled together in a single torrent before, but no effort had been made to actually segue the material together and make the shows seamless, so I did it myself.
