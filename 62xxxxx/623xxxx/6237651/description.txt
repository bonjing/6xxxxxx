Part 1. Australian Art
Griff crosses the globe to the remote Torres Strait Islands between Australia and Papua New Guinea to explore what remains of an unusually creative and warlike culture. Cut off from the rest of the world for most of their history, the islanders were fierce head-hunters who believed in magic and sorcery. What made their art so striking and powerful?
