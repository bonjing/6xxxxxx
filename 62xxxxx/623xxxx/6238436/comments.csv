I was searching for it a lot and I guess it`s just disappeared from the Internet ;d.
Buying a vinyl is not an option, as I don`t have proper equipment to rip that baby ;/.
It would be soooo awesome, if u could :)

[T],Abrasax,2011-04-02T16:14Z,"Hello scanarch!

The problem is that I have had a serious computer problem for a long time and it could take time to fix that or in worst case it's junk. So the file could be lost. However I make a new rip on this computer in the next few days and upload it for you. Want it in flac or mp3?"
