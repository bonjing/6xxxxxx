,scillage,2011-03-12T21:08Z,This works PERFECTLY on my DSTTi. Just it didn't work but then I realised I had to copy and paste the .dat file with the folder into the root of my card. Thanks! :D
,calijim,2011-03-13T23:25Z,FINALLY!  This worked with my R4i Happy Box!
,klecha50,2011-03-14T01:00Z,"R4i card works great now, thanks alot"
,leor0111,2011-03-17T11:13Z,is this for R4 deluxe too?
,jab26,2011-03-27T21:37Z,"I can't get my r4i to work with this, could anybody tell me where i'm going wrong please"
,dragonmyc,2011-04-08T04:24Z,"well jab26, you have to go into the r4i folder and copy and paste everything and put it on the root of your sd card. root is when you go to ""My Computer"" and click on your microsd. The window that comes up is called the root. Just put the files in there. You should be able to take it from here! :)"
,kimykrijg,2011-04-30T21:02Z,i copied and pasted all the maps in the root map but the game is still a white screen when i start it. what did i do wrong? btw my card is a r4 revolution
,dragonmyc,2011-06-22T19:05Z,"Sorry for the late reply, kimykrijg. First off, you're not supposed to copy all the maps onto the SD card. Since you have a r4 revolution, you have to open ""R4--Clone YSMenu"" (or the ""R4-SDHC--R4i-SDHC TTMenu"" if you have a SDHC card). Once inside the folder, then you copy everything and move it to your SD card. If it doesn't work with the ""R4--Clone YSMenu"" then try it with ""R4-SDHC--R4i-SDHC TTMenu""."

,dragonmyc,2011-10-16T05:40Z,"Trav01, sounds like you might have a bad Pokemon White.nds file. Try the link below. If it doesn't work, I'm not sure what else to tell you.

,AV0NS3,2012-03-06T23:46Z,"I've R4 SDHC. I've copied all the files from inside the ""R4-SDHC--R4i-SDHC TTMenu"" folder onto the SD card. In the menu I choose TT menu. It download, dowload and dowload, and nothing to do. I wait one minute, but nothing else. What can I do? Sorry for bad english!"
