,ganjiry1,2011-06-11T11:29Z,"hi  DibyaTPB thanks so much 4 the up. ive looked 4 this 4 a while now cheers!
is this the oem or retail  like download4all says?

i hav a oem disc that came with my pc. can i just use this and activate it with my product key so i havent got so many updates to do? 

any help is much apreciated thanx in advance"
,urbanriot,2011-08-21T06:21Z,"This is most definitely OEM.  If you have a legal product key sticker on your PC or laptop, this is what you need this disc for, for a fresh install of Windows 7.  If anyone comments otherwise, they're wrong, this is OEM. "

THANKS  to  many  uploads  to choose from  oh  is this  untouched version  of win 7"

,humpahoe,2012-03-12T14:37Z,@Xenonite. You fuckin idiot. you didn't pirate this. There's no key attached with it.
,Xenonite,2012-06-10T03:54Z,"@humpahoe Yes, I did. Piracy is the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted software. This download is not authorized by Microsoft (they would prefer I buy the DVD from them)."
