Thanks in advance!"
,appmaster,2012-01-19T14:04Z,"Might be late but quite simply you just

1. Download this torrent
2. Download ImgBurn
3. Buy a DVD+R DL (NOT DVD-R DL!!)
4. Put the DVD in ur drive, open ImgBurn, load the .dvd file that you downloaded from this torrent, select 2.4x write speed, and click ""write""

Easy."
