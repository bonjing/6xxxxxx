This is a 24 bit, 48 kHz transcription of a pristine copy of Robert Hunter's long out-of-print LP Jack O' Roses. The analog rig used to extract the sound from the grooves is near state-of-the-art, producing essentially none of the tracking distortion or surface noise normally associated with LPs. The sound is cleaner and more detailed than you may have thought possible in LP transcriptions. 

Equipment used for A/D conversion: 

Linn Akiva phono cartridge
Linn Ekos SE tonearm
Linn LP12/Lingo turntable
Audioquest LeoPard tonearm cable
PS Audio PS2 preamplifier
Kimber PBJ interconnect
M-Audio Audiophile USB A/D converter

The mildest possible declicking (Click Repair, DeClick 1, DeCrackle off, wavelet method, pitch protection) was used to eliminate some of the more obvious ticks and pops. Other than that, there has been no noise reduction.
