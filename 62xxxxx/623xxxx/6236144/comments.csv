,RatRanger,2011-03-12T18:51Z,"@ireallyamabum if you had read the title ""The Adjustment Bureau (2011)(TS2DVD) NLSubs-DMT""

you will see its a TS2DVD pr if you are unable to separate the letters TS to DVD the TS st the front being Tele Sync

anything with TS i personally assume is recorded from Tv some of which are good others bad 

so no need to get hot and bothered about it."

Can someone develop a field or way of distinguishing movies which have hardcoded or selectable subs?"
,ireallyamabum,2011-03-14T08:08Z,"@ratranger im just saying that this is Clearly the dvd section. wtf does tlesync ToDVD mean?! that u can burn his cam shit copy on a blank dvd? there are thousands of ppl downing this and i guess at least a few expected dvd quality. and i cant believe anyone outside of amsterdam would like to see nl subs covering half the screen. they should create a pure dutch category where they can post their crap without bothering Everyone else. i wrote this cuz ive accidently downed bout 15 unwatchable dutch hardcopyd subs. but hey keep it up nlupper002, why be a normal person when u can be a dick?"
,EatMyAIDS,2011-03-14T08:09Z,I don't know why a ts is in the dvd rip section... IF ITS NOT A DVD RIP!
,Plasmadude,2011-03-21T17:43Z,"4+ GB for a cam is assinine.
Perhaps   TPB can set up a cam section so that we dont waste our time downloading bogus shit.

,IceClowns,2011-03-31T20:14Z,It does not matter what format its in!! When it says DVDR its only asking for movies that have been ripped from a dvd. not movies that have been filmed and put on to dvd and loaded onto pirate bay as a dvdr!! when people see DVDR they want DVD quality!! Format does not matter!!
