The DÃ¸ is a French/Finnish indie pop band founded in Paris in 2005. The band is Olivia Bouyssou-Merilahti (singer and musician) and Dan Levy (multi-instrumentalist). The duo has been backed on stage by three different drummers (JÃ©rÃ©mie Pontier 2007-2008, JosÃ© Joyette 2008-2009, Pierre Belleville since 2009). Their first studio album A Mouthful topped the French charts in 2008, making them the first French act singing in English to reach that position.





A Mouthful (2008-2010)

A Mouthful was released in France in January 2008. The rest of Europe and Australia released it later that year . It was very well received by critics and the public, ranking nÂ°1 in the French charts on the first week. It was acclaimed as an eclectic record, drawing inspiration from various genres as pop, folk, rock or hip-hop, while keeping an integrity and an original approach.

The first single from the album was On my shoulders, followed by At last and Stay (Just a little bit more). The music video for At last was directed by Belgian choreographer Wim Vandekeybus.

The band went on tour in Europe and Australia for over 200 shows. They spent summer 2008 playing at most of the biggest festivals in Europe (EurockÃ©ennes de Belfort, Paleo, Provinssirock, Vieilles Charrues, Roskilde, Main Square Festival, Pukkelpop...), flew to Australia for the V Festival in spring 2009, and spent two weeks in America, playing from Mexico to Canada, NYC to LA, in September 2009.

A Mouthful was officially released in the US in April 2010 on Six Degrees Records, including 3 bonus tracks.
