PLOT OUTLINE
__________________
Professor Phillip Brainard, an absent minded professor, works with his assistant 
Weebo, trying to create a substance that's a new source of energy and that will 
save Medfield College where his sweetheart Sara is the president. He has missed 
his wedding twice, and on the afternoon of his third wedding, Professor Brainard 
creates flubber, which allows objects to fly through the air. I looks like 
rubber, so he calls it flubber. This film is based on the 1961 Disney classic, 
"The Absent-Minded Professor.
