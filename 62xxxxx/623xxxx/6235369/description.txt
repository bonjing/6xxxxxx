Florida native Mike Diaz goes by the name MillionYoung, and pools elements of Animal Collective, Toro y Moi, and New Order into his drowsy, circular soundscapes. Like fellow chillwavers, he sings wistfully over a blend of acoustic instruments and electronic programming, and uses a retro 80s palette of synth sounds. After the Be So True EP and Sunndreamm EP generated a buzz online in 2010, Diaz announced that his first full-length, Replicants, would become available in early 2011.
