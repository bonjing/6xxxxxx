,NYsmooth,2011-03-11T16:02Z,"I dont think knowing what region its from is useless,it has nothing to do with it playing on ant ps3 since there is no region lock.What is has to do with is DLC for region specific games.If it is a game I dont plan on getting DLC for then I dont care if it is PAl or NTSC but if im planning on getting or have DLC for a game I definately want it NTSC.And that is the reason region matters.BTW there is a fix for this at PSXscene for eboot.Tried it with this dl and it works.Thx for DL and every1 enjoy."
,ARTiKNL,2011-03-11T17:41Z,"And what if I wanted to get a save file for the game? I'd need to figure out which region its from too.

Fix is also at PS3ISO."
,Lateralus1980,2011-03-11T20:10Z,It's also nice to know for downloading fixes as many are region specific

,majuaraan,2011-03-15T01:10Z,Actually the region does matter becuase if your poor like me and still have SDTV you can't play PAL games on NTSC console. doesn't support it

,Tonguefreak101,2011-03-17T02:39Z,this is NOT the USA Version.. its BLES00962 and will not work with the DLC (online play code) if your system is US.. the US Version is= BLUS30530. Guess for the US people with US Systems will have to wait for the US version to be uplaoded..
,Tonguefreak101,2011-03-17T12:46Z,"Back again, ""Swelogz"" i am going to have the USA Version soon.. i wanted to know if i could some how give it to you so you can keep it going?? I will be only uploading it till there is a few 100% downloads, from there it will be up to everyone else to keep it alive. I will Update everyone on when i get this uploaded.."

,Muz134,2011-03-21T16:27Z,"i'm new to this jailbreak stuff..i can't seem to get the game working
i bought a ps3 with a cfw already in it plus 3 games
i downloaded this ..copied through gaia manager and when i press x to launch it sends me back to the xmb

,Shauncold,2011-03-31T04:02Z,"I get the same disc ejected error after installing patch as well. If somebody can explain why this happening, I would greatly appreciate it. I saw this game work on CFW on youtube so I know it works, just don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm using Wutangrza JB and multiman 1.16.11."
,aasimtom,2011-04-13T20:45Z,"Thanks for the up.

But I get this error code: 80010017

I've Kmeaw 3.55 with latest MM and I tried play from Internal but same error code over and over again. What could be the reason and a viable solution would be much appreciated.

Thanks"
