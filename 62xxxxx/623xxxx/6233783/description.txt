Release Info

The year is 2027. The world as we know it is unraveling after fifteen
years of economic meltdown and widespread global conflict over dwindling
natural resources. A once proud America has fallen, her infrastructure
shattered and military in disarray. Crippled by a devastating EMP strike,
the USA is powerless to resist the ever expanding occupation of a savage,
nuclear armed Greater Korean Republic

Notes

This game needs Fw 3.56

First working english release wins .. there is no need to dupe every
release with one from a different region. There are no region locks.
And yes, also games bought in the USA can be multi and played on Euro
consoles (and vice versa
Therefore we don't tag our releases with a source region, and we encourage
other groups to do the same and siteops to deny such useless dupes and
adjust rules

Enjoy This Fine DUPLEX Release
