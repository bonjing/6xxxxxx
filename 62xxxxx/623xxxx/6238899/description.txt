I was never happy with the album "9012 Live-The Solos". It always felt to me like a fragment of a live album, not a whole album. What I've done here is to take the audio from the DVD of 9012 Live and add the solo pieces from the CD into it. The DVD (and the redundant portions of the CD) were recorded at Northlands Coliseum, Edmonton, Canada on September 28, 1984, and the solo pieces were recorded at Dortmund, Germany on June 24, 1984. The solos added to the sequencing makes for a less commercial show that begins to recapture some of Yes' prog rock roots. Conversely, adding the concert to the solos makes it seem like a full live album now instead of a highlights collection.

More to come. Enjoy!
