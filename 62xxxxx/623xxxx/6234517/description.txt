A decade ago, Ray Favor was a remorseless killer for theBlack Ops cell Bravo One Nine. He did what he was hired to do 

out of patriotism and duty. Now, having amassed a fortune but deeply troubled by his past and suspicious of his own 

nature, Favor is motivated by something more: a chance to right the wrongs he committed and restore balance. He gets 

that chance deep in the Philippines , where the disappearance of two teenagers leads Favor and his Bravo team to 

confront an illegal operation by the Russian mobâ€”and an evil so deplorable that it can only be righted by the means 

Favor once used to wreak destruction. Now, driven by a hungry sense of purpose, Ray Favor will seek retribution by any 

means necessary. And exact a violent justice without mercyâ€”or regret.

First in Phillip Finchâ€™s stunning new series, Devilâ€™s Keep is a suspense-packed international thriller introducing a 

powerful, complex, and memorable action hero.
