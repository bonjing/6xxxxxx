Finally, a MASH release without canned laughter. Ripped by me personally in high quality h.264, these episodes come straight from the UK DVD box set.


Watch using VLC, or any other media player that supports MKV/h.264 (all the decent codec packs support it).


All 11 seasons are now up! I'll seed for a couple of days on this torrent, then I'll start them all up again with limited bandwidth for a little while longer, just to build up the health a little.

Every episode has been uploaded glitch free, without the annoying canned laughter (save one episode in season 7 that had no alternative audio track available) and in high quality h.264 for your viewing pleasure.

***PLEASE***

Seed for as long as you can, and always make sure you seed AT LEAST what you leech. I can't seed forever if you want new releases!
