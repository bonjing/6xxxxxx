Jay Lang, a Mississippi Delta boy, has been playing Mississippi Roots music for 15 years now with various bands and line-ups. His music experience started in Greenville, MS sitting in with various local musicians like Willie Foster, John Horton, T-Model Ford, and Eddie Cusic who would all tell him, "you ain't no good, but yoou have a good ear and you don't mess us up. Come back next week." After three years of woodshedding and bartending in the Delta he moved to Oxford, MS where he formed his first band, Three Legged Dog which featured traditional, old-school country blues played at break neck speed with a full four piece band. After touring the southeast and living in many different places Jay ended up back in Oxfrod, Ms ready to start fresh with a new band and a new sound, Jay Lang and the Devil's Due. The formula is simple: electric slide guitar with a heavy backbeat and super-bad guitar leads.
