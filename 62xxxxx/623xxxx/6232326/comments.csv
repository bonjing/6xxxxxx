,anuzbitt,2011-03-10T13:42Z,"Roach_666
you have to add the line to make the signatured items to work by way rlf-rls discribes edit the lines in the decrypt_dlc.bat he means use a notebook and add the line : 
rem Signature Edition
deda2drm.exe DA2_PRO_COL C70C-FD85-FD48-FB7C-1035-5683-62C2-4979
just like the other 2 lines inside the bat. file.. that decrypt the other 2 dlcs and then after run it :D basicly it allworks like a dream"
,sephticle,2011-03-10T13:45Z,"When I run decrypt_dlc.bat with the edited text in it, it tells me:

""'deda2drm.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file""

And then the DLCs are unauthorized, so it's obviously not supposed to say that.

What's the deal?"
,MaDaFaKaS,2011-03-10T13:53Z,"i need help with the ''run activator'' step

,Lasher,2011-03-10T13:59Z,"Hey guys. I need some help installing the DLC. ok I follow the instructions, to the letter. But it continuously tells me Dragon Age 2 isn't installed. and the thing is, it's not.. not really. I downloaded the clondedvd version, unrar'd it to my desktop, added the crack to the folder it un'rar'd to, and it works, I didn't physically install it, so is there a way to bypass it? the activator thing seems to be shit, all it has are ??????????????? all over it.

and Shadowhawke 
i unrar the deda2drm.zip into the same folder s the zip file... just keep all the files together when u run it ..... oh apart from  a critical step he missed in the guide but is writting in the yo. txt file is you should copy the unlockables.gda file into dokuments/BioWare/Dragon Age 2/packages/core/override you will find the file inside the deda2drm.zip folder.... dont give up on this it works.... oh or you could try this one donno if it works just saw it http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6232599/DA2_All_DLCs_Items_unlocked"
,Sethelae,2011-03-10T14:28Z,hey so i did everything that is written in the instructions but when i run the dlc decrypter it keeps saying that it cant open the erf files..i dont know what to do...

,Rucklier,2011-03-10T14:53Z,@Lasher in your clone dvd files look for the _install file and it will have whatever language you want to install it in. run the autorun and let it do its thing.
,Shadowhawke,2011-03-10T14:59Z,"@anuzbitt 
Many thanks it worked. :)"
,phynx_C4,2011-03-10T16:11Z,"for those having problems accessing some of the DLC.... i actually ran the activator again and followed the steps AFTER i installed the dlc, then i ran the decrypt_dlc.bat

after i logged back in the dlc quests showed up, hope this helps"
,Newet,2011-03-10T17:22Z,"Okay, so everything works fine (big thanks to uploader) I do however have a problem. 

GAME SPOILER!!

!!
!!




After I get into the chantry (once I'm done with Sebastian's first mission) I go to the chantry and find him talking the the grand cleric, everything goes fine until he joins my party, whenever I click on him to level up the game crashes to desktop...help?"
,Furious1964,2011-03-10T18:07Z,"Does this unlock the following:

Might of the Sten
Apostate's Courage
Adder of Antiva
Seeker's Bulwark
Ring of Resilience"
,TweakWRC,2011-03-10T19:04Z,"@Furious1964

No, it unlocks a shitload of items like blood dragon armor and co but not the items you listed.

Otherwise it works flawless, both Sebastian and Black Emporium (and of course the bonus items). 

P2P were the first who cracked the game, now they were the first to realease proper working DLCs, thx a lot guys :D"
,MegaNewb4,2011-03-10T19:48Z,"I have a problem: in the game my unlockables show that most of the item like Ser Isaacs armor are highlited meaning they are unlocked but when I enter the game there are no quests pop up and I cant find it in the delivery chest.

Help? please"
,turock3,2011-03-10T20:20Z,"@Furious1964 Yeah, it didn't unlock any of those bonuses for me either. It did unlock everything else though, including the DA Legends items, dead space armor and some of the store exclusive ones. As for the SE items like the ones you listed, no dice on that."
,Shadowhawke,2011-03-10T20:43Z,"@MegaNewb4 and Furious1964

Use this it unlocks everything. :)

(yes i tried running it with admin)
a command screens pops up for 1 sec"
,buttnipple,2011-03-10T21:29Z,the dlc's wont work but the items work
,Lasher,2011-03-10T21:37Z,"Thanks for the help guys. I managed to activate all, and I've triple checked to make sure all the text was put in correctly, exiled prince and black emporium have a tick next to them in the downloadable content tab in the games main menu, but they aren't in the actual game, i can't see anything about sebastian or any quest in the chantry, or on the chantry board, or letters in my house, i also made a new character and got to my house in kirkwall, all i managed to get working is the sig dlc, not prince or emporium. "
,Lasher,2011-03-10T22:12Z,"Okay, I managed to get it all working, aswel as the 5 special items some people are having trouble with. 

Go here: http://rghost.net/4707562?key=dd595eb6aa865d4dff22b94533358f4c

download it. It's no virus or anything fake or shit, it works 100%.

it's like the dlc activator in this torrent, but better, you don't have to edit anything or install anything, it contains a rar that has the addins folder, which u just copy paste, and the activator, u specify the path of where the game is installed, click activate and it will work fine. you can tell if it works if next to version in the dlc tab in the games main menu, if it says 1.0.

however exiled prince will bug if you've already been to the deep roads. and won't allow u to click the chantry board."
,GrimMaggot,2011-03-10T22:45Z,My black emporium and exiled prince DLC aren't...well activating. The items and such all work its just...Well the quests for the black emporium and the exiled prince aren't popping up.
,GrimMaggot,2011-03-10T22:54Z,So a little question...I open the Downloadable Content menu in game and it says all my DLC is unauthorized.
,Lasher,2011-03-10T23:25Z,"delete your addins folder, and replace it with the one from the rar from the link i posted above, then run the activator from my link, click english top left, then specify where the game is installed, and click 'activate dlc' then exit. it should say version 1.0 not version (unauthorised 1.0)"
,buttnipple,2011-03-10T23:38Z,@GrimMaggot i haz the same prob D:
,Rucklier,2011-03-10T23:48Z,@Lasher thanks man that worked for me as well and it was much more simple than this. cheers.

,Valamyr82,2011-03-11T03:59Z,"Lasher - please make your stuff into a proper torrent and upload it here to TPB. Itll get much more visibility that way, and people will be more inclined to trust it.

Thanks, Val"
,Velhomestre,2011-03-11T06:48Z,"Thanks for this torrent, it worked fine.

But there is only 1 dlc item missing.

It is called ""Ring of Whispers"". According to official site one needs to buy at least U$15 of products at razer or another site.

Could anyone try to get this item for us? This is the last dlc item available that is not in this torrent.

PS: Also for the ones searching for ""The Antivan Garrote"", this dlc item was ""removed"". According to official site it will be released soon."
,Lasher,2011-03-11T07:47Z,"I have no idea how to upload torrents, or make them etc. I've wanted to for a long time, help people out with cracks, or upload my hardstyle/metal collection, anything small due to my crap Internet. 

Only problem is I am pretty dumb when it comes to doing it, so I never do. "
,Lasher,2011-03-11T08:02Z,"You do Sebastian Vael's quest. And he joins you in ACT 2. (After you complete deep roads) however... If you are already on act 2 and install the exiled ponce, he will be at the chantry board like normal, and you will see a cutscene like normal, but when u go to get his quest from the chantry board, you will see the ! above the board, but you won't be able to click it, alas...bugged. and you may have to wait till your 2nd playthrough.

,Avallone,2011-03-12T09:12Z,"I got solution for Clonedvd version:

Copy bin_ship directory from unrared clonedvd version to default installation folder: C:/Program Files 86x/Dragon Age / Dragon Age 2 - I got it so). Then ran the Activator, and activate the Folder, where clonedvd version is /not version in program Files !!)
Then Run launcher and click configure and go to repair and click on all the 4 parts (yes all the 4 parts) after doing it the game itself will repair the reg file for u and thn quit... Then install all DLCs decrypt them, etc, and it worked .. ;) "
