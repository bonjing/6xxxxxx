  The epic sequel to Lightning Warrior Raidy, this new erotic 3D RPG brings
  Raidy to the desert town of Lake Blue. Raidy's biggest and best adventure
  yet, with new gamplay elements, locations, and dozens of new monsters and
  characters!

  "Ugh... desert travel is terrible on the skin, let me tell you!
  Why did I ever choose to come this way...
  If I don't find water soon it's going to be troublesome.

  Wait, what's that in the distance - an oasis?! And a town next to it!
  Civilization at last..."
  I am Raidy, wandering the continent of Else as a swordfighter. I can freely
  bend the power of thunder to my will, so people have taken to calling me
  the "Lightning Warrior". I'm traveling far and wide to improve my fighting
  skills and search for clues about my past, and my mysterious power over
  lightning.

  After defeating the monsters in the Cubust tower in my last adventure, I
  left the village of Sadd behind and continued on my journey. My travels
  have taken me across the desert to the oasis town of Lake Blue. Looking
  forward to a break after the long and dusty journey, I settled in for the
  night at the local inn... only to have its peace shattered by the cries of
  the young, beautiful innkeeper!

  I rescued her from her mysterious assailant, to learn that the town was
  living under constant fear of attack from a gang of marauding bandits led
  by a cruel woman called Jammy. It seems my vacation won't be so uneventful
  after all! I set out to find information on the gang's hideout, and a new
  adventure begins...

  The epic sequel to 3D RPG Lightning Warrior Raidy, Raidy II brings our
  heroine's world to life as never before! Featuring a brand new map
  interface, the town of Lake Blue and its surroundings present a host of
  new locations to explore, with new items, equipment types, weapons
  (including the legendary Sexcalibur), and gameplay elements - including
  a gold economy, dual-wielding weapons, and a new charge-based Thunder
  Slash! Hordes of new "monster girl" enemies for Raidy to face in victory
  or defeat are present as well - with more than three dozen new monster
  types and two dozen named characters, not to mention fetishes from yuri
  to bondage to futanari and beyond, this is an action-packed RPG you won't
  want to miss!

  We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us
  or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care
  because we think that scene means that every game should be released.
