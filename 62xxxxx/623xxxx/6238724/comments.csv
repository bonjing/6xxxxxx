,CosmicKobal,2011-06-28T09:16Z,"Maybe this will help someone. After unRAR'ing and mounting and installing, i looked everywhere for the install directory. eventually i figured out that i needed to copy the 'lighting warrior raidy II' folder from the CD to my PC. then i copied the 'RAIDY_2_US' file in the 'FASiSO' folder on the cd over to the 'LIGHTNING WARRIOR RAIDY II' folder that i had just coppied from the cd. now it works fine so far. so, the short version of what i just said:

1. after unraring and mounting and installing, co to my computer, right click on wherever you mounted the ISO and select 'open'.

2. copy the LIGHTING WARRIOR RAIDY II folder to your desktop( or wherever you want it to be really).

3. copy the contents of the FASiSO folder ALSO on the CD over into the LIGHTNING WARRIOR RAIDY II folder you just copied and when it asks you if you want to overwrite, say yes.

thats pretty much it. hope this helps someone. :)"
