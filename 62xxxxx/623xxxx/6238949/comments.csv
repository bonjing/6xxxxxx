My favorites are All I Long For, You Changed My Life, Falling, This Is Love and Where The Sun Meets The Sea but I also like several others.  Great albums.  Thanks for the upload - U R T B!"
,MikeXRyan,2011-03-13T06:11Z,"Andy, you are right, deMarco could be Greg's younger brother and it is probably the first reason why I was so intrigued by the two singers.  The first time I saw their picture I thought Greg and deMarco were related and deMarco has the same blue eyes!  You must have seen pictures of Greg on the dating site?

My very favorite J&D song is The Italian Song because deMarco sings to Jason in Italian and even though my Greg is Irish, we spent ten days in Italy during our honeymoon.  And The Italian Song is very romantic.  

Please!  Download the movie and watch it.  J&D are very funny.  I love watching them.  It is obvious they are in love with each other, especially deMarco with Jason but he is much more private in his affections then Jason.  You'll notice it is Jason who initiates the public kisses and touches but it is deMarco who obviously adores Jason.  

I love their harmony and both write many of their own songs.  This Is Love was written (and sung) by deMarco and Jason's high tenor voice is amazing.  

Thanks for downloading and please seed.  These two guys really need the support of the Gay community.  They were ostracized by their own churches and I'd really like to see them be showcased and appear at the Grammys.  Wouldn't it be cool to see them sing at the Grammys AND win a Grammy?  The gay community can make that happen!  Let's do it! :-) "

And it is such a romantic song!  deMarco's Italian mom sheds a tear or two whenever her boy sings it and Jason is so sweet when deMarco takes his hand.  What a great life together they are having!  Where is MY Prince Charming? LOL!"

I can report that these two singers will become fathers to a set of twins in just a few months via surrogate.  They have not announced which one is the biological father or the sex of the babies.  They haven't gone real public with the news but are announcing it at their concerts.  

It would be nice if any downloaders would leave a comment or two.  "
