I am not a spiritual person by any means but want to share this movie and these three albums with my gay buddies and friends because I love these two guys, Jason and deMarco.  

They have two of the most unforgettable and beautiful voices you may ever hear.  This package includes a documentary on their lives entitled We Are All Angels (avi format) and three of their current albums, Till The End of Time, Spirit Pop and Safe (MP3 format).  

Don't get me wrong, these are NOT bible-thumping holy-roller religious Gospel songs.  They are amazing love pop songs and you'll want to hear and play them again and again.  

They were both solo singers in their separate churches (deMarco is the dark curly haired one, brought up a strict Catholic boy in Canada and straight before meeting and falling in love with Jason.  Jason, the blond, is the oldest of three brothers and grew up in the very strict Pentecostal religion.   They met one evening in a Los Angeles Italian restaurant and fell in love with each other.  They are now legally married altho the film was made before their wedding.  They are funny, handsome, extremely candid and saucy about their romantic life together and if you're gay, then please see, hear and support them.   

From the Advocate:  Being in a committed romantic relationship, legally married and working together is not easy. Now add in the fact that you are a gay couple and former Gospel singers and your life and career is really tough. But that's the life of Jason Warner and deMarco DeCiccio, known professionally as Jason & deMarco. Their story is the basis of -We re All Angels- a documentary that is making the rounds of film festivals and cable television channels across America.

Enjoy!
