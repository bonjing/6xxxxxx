After just two Years after \\Kingdom of Welcome Addiction\\, Chris Corner with his band comes with new album.

\\Volatile Times\\ is set to be released on March 18 (the release date was postponed by two weeks). As their official website states, it will come out both as a CD and a vynil record. By the way, itâ€™s said to be IAMXâ€™s first vynil release.

Chris Cornerâ€™s project promises to present a song for free in a few weeks. And the spring is all planned for European tour already.

Volatile Times has the following tracklist:

01. I Salute You Christopher
02. Music People
03. Volatile Times
04. Fire And Whispers
05. Dance With Me
06. Bernadette
07. Ghosts of Utopia
08. Commanded by Voices
09. Into Asylum
10. Cold Red Light
11. Oh Beautiful Town
