,theRealKarmine,2011-04-10T19:07Z,"every crack made to fix nod32 shows up as a virus to nod32.  want to know why?  either you are using some other SHITTY AV to scan this, or never knew that a file that attempts to modify the antivirus is considered a threat."

I installed the antivirus and it works great but I have *problem*: whenever I restar of turn on/off my laptop ESET icon in bottom right part of the screen changes color and I see message ""maximum protection is not ensured..... *click here* to...."" 

After clicking on link ""click here"" everything works ok but I am tired of clicking each time I restart or turn on/off my laptop. Is there any way this could be fixed??

Many thanks in advance for quick reply!
Adi"
