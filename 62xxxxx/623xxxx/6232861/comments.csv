Question.. do u all like to play these with keyboard ,, or  game comtrolers hooked to USB on PC,, ???"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-10T20:15Z,i personally use a controller hooked into usb. but i'd be able to play with a keyboard too.
,1TWISTED,2011-03-11T14:33Z,"Thnks for reply,...  do you have any brand/type u like best?
I have 50 or so P-3 1.2/1.4 CPUs  PCs that are going out to non-proffs around the STATES  and I need the lowest $ I can, but with the best control for the games.  Most people at the churches and rehab centers know nothing so sinple is better. Thnk,  again.."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-11T22:14Z,"logitech (some people call it logitek) are great and by far the best of the best of the BEST!!!!! :) lol just kidding. they are great controllers but any pc controller is great. some people might argue and say that an xbox 360 controller is best but NO, not even close. the way a gaybox controller is set up is shit to begin with. any other pc controller is setup like a playstation 1 and 2 controller which is the way any controller should be. gaybox = epic fail."

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-04-06T05:48Z,use different plugins the .cue file does nothing.....
,pento,2011-04-11T13:09Z,I dont know what plugins you're talking about but i used cuemaker and it works perfectly now:)
