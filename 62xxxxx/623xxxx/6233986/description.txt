Not since Lucinda Williams debuted with an all-acoustic solo album of traditional country blues in 1979 has an artist appeared on the folk-blues scene with the immediate authority of guitarist Kelly Joe Phelps. Equally indebted to traditional pioneers of Delta-style country blues like Leadbelly and Blind Lemon Jefferson as well as more exploratory visionaries like Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder, Phelps sings with dusty wisdom and plays like a master.

Lead Me On opens with the traditional gospel tune "I've Been Converted" but focuses almost exclusively on magnificent originals from then on.
