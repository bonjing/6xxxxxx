2 July 2010 | by flores_idealist (United States)

I was disappointed and frustrated to see that the only review of this film so far was by a woman who had the nerve to dish on a film that she walked out of after only the first 40 minutes. Seems to me that that should automatically disqualify her review and critique on that grounds alone.

My partner and I, on the other hand, stayed for the entire film, and would have quite happily stayed for a second showing if they'd decided to have one. We agreed that it was the best lesbian film that we've ever seen (and we've seen most of them that are out there).

When the reality is that most (though thankfully not all) lesbian films are mediocre at best, and embarrassingly bad at worst, ""Elena Undone"" sets a new standard for what lesbian films can and should be: intelligently written, well-cast and well-acted and well-directed, with natural and believable dialogue, a storyline that is actually believable, and characters that you can relate to (and may even want to be friends with), and extremely erotic scenes that still manage to be tasteful and believable."
,asc11,2011-04-21T12:36Z,"It is rare to find all of these qualities in a mainstream blockbuster feature film, and nearly impossible to find them in lesbian movies, so I was thrilled almost beyond reason to see what can be accomplished in lesbian film-making.

And then there's the astounding beauty of the two co-stars and the incredible and believable passion and eroticism of the connection that builds between them as the movie evolves. To say that this was a satisfying element of the movie would be a serious understatement... I have never been so aroused by a film, and couldn't stop thinking about it for the entire week since I've seen it. I have watched the trailer at least once a day since and am totally hooked! I am not embarrassed to admit that I have fallen hopelessly in love with this exquisite film.

I encourage every woman-loving-woman out there (and our friends and allies) to do whatever it takes to SEE THIS FILM, even if it means buying it sight-unseen (yeah, it's THAT good!) We need to create a market for more high quality lesbian films like this, and the only way to do so is to provide support to the talented filmmakers who gift us with delicious movies like this one. SEE IT -- YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
