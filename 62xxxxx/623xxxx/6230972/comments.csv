,ragnarock04,2011-03-10T21:59Z,thnx for the info......can anyone plz tell the aspect ratio?
,DasheriM,2011-03-11T05:20Z,ragnarock04 can't you read it? 1920/1080=1.77 AR...
,IDManz,2011-03-11T19:16Z,"Speeds very slow guys... downloading since it had 10 seeders, max speed @ 30 kbps... seed plz "
,rishiket,2011-03-12T08:18Z,The aspect ratio keeps changing between 1.77(16:9) and 2.35:1. 
[T],jonnoel1,2011-03-16T02:33Z,"This is definitely a BRRIP, but the last comment is correct. The aspect ratio changes a few times during the move, but the quality of the movie is excellent. Definitely worth the DL, although the DL speed was extremely slow. Not enough seeders. Took me almost 12 hrs."
[V],Scrufuss,2011-03-20T18:14Z,"FYI, when I clicked the link for the image it went to a page that said ""This domain violates  image shacks TOS""
So I just pasted the link in the URL instead..
Picky twits, aint they?"

,mljucko55,2011-08-21T23:39Z,"absolutely great rip :). absolutely shit movie :(

ragnarock04

you too want SAMNhaNc3 do rip Matrix Trilogy. Wish he had a website or facebook page so we could ask him. His LOTR extended 1080 is actually better then CHD version. difference? 

SAMNhaNc3 version - 24GB
CHD version - 74GB

you tell me who got the goods. so please do MATRIX TRILOGY 1080P and if you can FIGHT CLUB 1080P. Thanks man."
