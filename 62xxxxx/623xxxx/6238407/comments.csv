,centynul,2011-03-14T18:17Z,"I do not think there is a crack/install.txt in this ISO...?  Did someone forget....?  ;)

PS -it is not ""size: DVD 63x50mb"" as NFO states - but rather a 4.4GB iso and an NFO (as above)..

Defo no crack included...   ;("
[V],Masterzilla,2011-03-14T20:13Z,Have you check on DVD once you mounted it?

,FaerieGrl,2011-05-29T12:05Z,"Thanks for this awesome pack! If it's not too much trouble , would you tell me what I'm doing wrong with the keygens? I install the program don't let it connect to the net , disconnect the internet and when I'm on the activation screen I open the keygen, but I still windup up short 5 characters to have a complete activation number. This has happened with every autodesk product I've gotten so far that has this keygen. Any help would be appreciated"
