,RatRanger,2011-03-11T20:30Z,without even downloading this i can guess that the dub is russian and if you are lucky there may be an alternate language. this uploader does not offer any infomation and has on occasion uplaoded another file to the one stated on the torrent DOWNLOAD AT YOU OWN RISK!
,Poglodyte,2011-03-12T02:54Z,"yep we get it thanks.  there's always the russian overdub, but usually chinese too and english subs... there is a risk, but it's worth it for me cus i love kung fu movies so i'll take anything i can get.  i'll always post the info on the ones i download"
