How do your choices in men affect your life? Dr. Phil sits down man to man with Angel, the father of Rachaelâ€™s baby, to ask him the hard questions: Why did he get Rachael pregnant, whatâ€™s in store for the future, and is he going to marry her? And, Dr. Phil doesnâ€™t mince words when he gives Gloria some insight into her behavior.
