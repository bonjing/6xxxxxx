Lastest beta build from today (continuous nightlies build...)
stable enough
Final release should be out to the end of this month...
See also my other torrents based on VLC 1.2.0
beware :

you can download experimental versions of VLC that are daily generated from the VLC code that is currently in development.
Several issues that existed in previous versions of VLC might be fixed here, but since this version of VLC is not yet finished, you should expect other problems and issues.
WARNING: The nightly builds are UNSTABLE and may not work at all.
There is absolutely NO SUPPORT for it from the VideoLAN Team. 
Use at your own risk so !
Ty for understanding
Note :
you must give 30 ko/s minimum upload if you wanna get this download.
No upload from your part will result : frozen download...
That's the way !
torrent is a sharing job.
I see again and again too much clients that don't give upload enough...
And even few of them give no upload at all...
sicky unfair...
So in this case,don't be surprised to get slow download and perhaps even nothing at all !
...
