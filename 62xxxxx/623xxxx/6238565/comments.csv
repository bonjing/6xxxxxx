,agranel,2011-03-12T21:48Z,Thank you!
,shauwy,2011-03-12T22:02Z,HO yeah!!! in english thanx Extremezone for the game and Skidrow for the crack great job!!!
,ThomasDollar,2011-03-12T22:14Z,"oh shit, so the game is really that tiny... and i thought it would be released like in a month or so... thx anyway :)"
,dumas1000,2011-03-12T22:36Z,"This is a digital download only game, contains only a SP campaign, is roughly 2 hours in length, and was developed in 6 months. It will sell on Steam, Xbox Live, and PSN for $10. It doesn't even have full live-action cutscenes, from what I understand. Basically, the model of full, 60-dollar movie franchise games hasn't worked that well, so konami is trying something different here. Anyway, that's why the game is so small. It's not what you would call a complete retail release. "
,mapel110,2011-03-12T23:46Z,crashes at startup. can't play. :(
[T],extremezone,2011-03-13T00:49Z,renew your directx/drivers
,dumas1000,2011-03-13T01:07Z,Can somebody check to see if the skidrow folder contains a virus? Kaspersky doesn't falsely identify viruses very often. 
,dumas1000,2011-03-13T01:20Z,"The Skidrow folder does not contain a crack. It contains a call sign-type launcher app for Skidrow, which has nothing really to do with the game, and it also contains a single .dll file. Paul.dll, which my anti-virus indentifies as a virus. Does altering that .dll file, even without a crack, somehow launch the game or what? Or is Paul.dll nothing more than a virus?"
,Memscorp,2011-03-13T01:29Z,"@dumas1000 It's a false postive. Avira was raising red flags too. Scanned paul.dll with VirusTotal, 7/42.

Also, I crash on startup."
,mapel110,2011-03-13T01:57Z,"@the people with startup crash, get in the support folder and install/update those files. After that, the game starts flawless."
,humbertoj,2011-03-13T02:02Z,"Hi, please, extremezone explain me what exactly you say on Step 4. Sorry friend i'm new in to this.

I download the game, Install it and is asking me for activation code. please help me. "

,RMJ13,2011-03-13T02:45Z,"install the crack!
IT IS IN THE iso ""skidrow"" FOLDEr

,dumas1000,2011-03-13T03:30Z,"I've confirmed that the .dll file produces a false positive with some anti-virus software and that it does launch the game. But it's not actually a cracked .exe file, which can be confusing. There is no cracked .exe file in the Skidrow folder.  "

,GrosShadock,2011-03-13T10:12Z,"Thanks a lot, it works fine.
Well, at first I had crashs, even after having used the content of the support folder to perform the necessary system updates... but then I tried to launch the game ""as Administrator""... and this time it worked !

So, if you're on Windows 7 (64 bits), and are having crashs when launching the game, try to LAUNCH IT ""AS AN ADMINISTRATOR"" (right click on the launch icon, and select ""Execute as an administrator"" (or something like that cause I'm not using English OS so I'm not sure of the exact translation). "
,neemox,2011-03-13T10:12Z,"OK works perfect !
For those who cant run the game or get error do this : Right Click>Properties>Compatibility>Run>Windows XP (Service ) "
,samirnasri,2011-03-13T10:59Z,Hello I have a problem:after installing (everyhting from support) (game is cracked) i clicked to play the game and it says:BattLA.exe has encountered a problem....... please help (i have windows xp)
,ThomasDollar,2011-03-13T11:50Z,"my god, what a horrible game... i would have completed it though if i could only strafe! thats right folks, u CANT STRAFE left and right in this game, only move - which makes this a pain in the ass :]"

,klord2010,2011-03-13T12:26Z,"if you rename your paul.dll to paul.dll1 or something similar (i did that for backup purpose) your game will crash. so delete/overwrite original file completely, or copy/move it somewhere else."

Run in compatibility mode WinXP SP2"

,klord2010,2011-03-13T12:55Z,I don't think that was the problem... weird. it might be related to skidrow's securom emulation... if i'm not wrong i can't smell one more scene flame war. :/
,samirnasri,2011-03-13T13:15Z,"in compatibility mode i have only: windows 95,98,NT and windows 2000. "

,chapperznightmare,2011-03-13T14:40Z,oh yeah thx extremezone all good
,futyu,2011-03-13T14:53Z, takes 1h to finish game wtf ... 
,helliformer,2011-03-13T16:19Z,What did you expect? It's a spin-off game from a movie which is released at the same time. This is just a cheap advert for the gaming community.
,jh-76,2011-03-13T16:38Z,works fine!!

,r083r73h,2011-03-13T17:31Z,"The game works smoothly on Windows 7 Service Pack 1, but remember to disable your antivirus program. Copy SKIDROW.exe and paul.dll to the ""bin"" folder then double-click on BattleLA.exe. That said, the game is very bad. Everything from graphics to sound effects seems very amateurish and not particularly entertaining. Removed it after a short time."
,Lappers,2011-03-13T17:57Z,"Just a heads up, I have played a lot of FPS shooters and this is one of the worst.. Its not even slightly fun in hard-mode."

,porkchop01,2011-03-13T19:38Z,what is the activation code cause that the only problem im having
,creek75,2011-03-13T19:45Z,"If you have to disable your AV on cracked games then you either have some crapware like McAfee or the crack is infected.
I run ESET Smart Security and have never once had a false positive."
,creek75,2011-03-13T19:48Z,"AVG, McAfee, Symantec (Norton) all blow-goats.
Only ESET and Microsoft's own AV (yep really) are any good.
AVG, McAfee and Symantec (AMS) all take money from the various publishers to add well know cracks to their signature files - ESET and Microsoft don't. That means AMS are all bloated and slow."

,Rayan1337,2011-03-13T22:14Z,"Great job as useual extremezone. 

Game is err..pretty bad.  5/10 imo but ehh,yeah what can you expect for 10 bucks? 

For anyone having trouble,you have to copy the contents of the skidrow folder in the /bin/ folder and not on the main folder as usual"
,Rayan1337,2011-03-13T22:16Z,"Misspelled usual there,feel like I have to correct myself.

Oh the sensitivity and controls in this game are retarded. You can change them in options of course. Easiest way to beat it is with the sniper,go for headshots,usually instakill. Otherwise empty half of your mag just to kill one."

,Staffieone,2011-03-14T16:06Z,"I'm not sure if some of you are illiterate or just dumb. You don't need an activation key as arathanstorrents posted earlier.

In the skidrow folder there is a .dll file called paul.dll

You copy this file and paste it where you installed the game inside the BIN folder. Replace the old file with this .dll and you are good to go.

I'm sure typing this is futile as those dumb enough not to figure it out on their own won't read this and will post probably right under this, ""what is the activation key"".

,BarrySoetoro,2011-03-15T05:19Z,"Wow. This is about as generic as it gets. 

Washed out colors, dated textures, dirty bump mapping, mostly static shading, scripted ""physics"", underwhelming weapons effects, boring level design, average audio at best... played it for 20 minutes and almost fell asleep.

Hollywood cashing in again. Mass produced bullshit cash grab.

If a game based on a movie comes out within a year of the theatrical release, beware. If it comes out at the same time, just don't bother at all.

I keep going against my instinct, hoping maybe one day someone will do it right, but it's always the same. Games released as basically part of a movie promo package are absolute trash."
,Sgt-Sandstorm,2011-03-15T07:54Z,"Okay, running Win7 (64b) and my game didn't even load up, all I did was change Compatibility to Vista SP2 and Run As Admin.

,sekondar1,2011-05-20T21:26Z,need activizion code
,tony419,2011-05-31T15:57Z,"Good working download,  sh*ty game. Most antiviruses detect paul.dll as a virus,it aint, so either disable ur antivirus or make paul.dll an exception in your antivirus. Right from the start, with the jpeg newsreporter down to the absurd button configuration, its obvious this game is just a marketing strategy to attract gamers to the film, without any serious creativity put into it, 4 me, a failed strategy."
,pe16pe,2011-06-13T23:47Z,thanks i will download it
,WoWguy6,2011-06-17T17:20Z,It still needs a activation after copied paul.dll fuck you

,Viperr101,2011-06-27T19:16Z,"_________________READ__________________

As of June 27th, the paul.dll file DOES NOT work. I'm using windows xp sp3, tried every possible solution including turning off hardware sound in dxdiag, and the program still crashes right on launch. All support folder redistributable are up to date, and I'm running as admin. Do paul.dll files stop working after a certain amount of time and get blocked? 

And no, I'm not one of the retards who didn't put paul.dll in the bin folder. I overwrote the existing one and it still doesn't work, crashes instantly right when launching game. Reinstalled the game like 3 times and it just doesn't work. I think it's safe to say the file doesn't work anymore."
