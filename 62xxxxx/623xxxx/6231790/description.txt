From Amazon:
"Not only does this double-CD set contain the best from the Vertigo years (1975-1980), it contains the entire "Live at Marble Arch", long an expensive and rare item on the collector's market. Plus you get the entire "Squeezing Out Sparks" album, usually considered to be the high point of his career. One problem with this collection, though, is an apparent error where studio versions of songs from the live "Parkerilla" album are included rather than the correct tracks from the live album."
