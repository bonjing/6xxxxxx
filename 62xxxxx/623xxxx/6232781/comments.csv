,muk0690,2011-03-10T19:46Z,@twentyforty: Will you be doing Tron Legacy and The Fighter bluray 720p?
,psipsina111,2011-03-10T19:58Z,"hi would like to get Little Fockers can anyone suggest a good download, the comments for some are not promising and cannot find 20-40 version which I know would be GOOD. TIA"
,psipsina111,2011-03-10T20:13Z,OH sorry for previous post the Little Fockers is not out on DVD yet. I will wait.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-10T20:29Z,"@muk0690 : ""Fighter"" is done yesterday and sits on the server for slot to be freed... 14 hours right now. I am afraid it would be 12 hours more...then.

Tron Legacy is in encoding whole day today and it would be upped and active roughly 40 hours from now."
