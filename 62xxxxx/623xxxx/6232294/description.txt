Songs That Made This Country Great - 1992 A true greatest hits collection including some stellar Wall of Voodoo work but mostly songs from the three solo albums, rarities and song/film work. From a review of the record in Goldmine..."Not just a tired string of random selections; but an album that hangs together alarmingly well as a full length listen and proves beyond a doubt that Ridgway's efforts over the past decade make him deserving of recognition as one of the most consistently imaginative songwriting talents." 16 tracks. 


Not another album to listen to in West Texas, long after dark, when the rest of the world slumbers...... Stan's tales of the bleak side of humanity will transport you far beyond the lonesome cattle traces to somewhwere you may not want to go.
