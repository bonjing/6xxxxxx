Excelent video and audio. I'm impressed with Matroska format. Really needs to be a god to handle it? Or is there a good software like Gordian Knot was to Xvid and Dvix? Please enlight us !  :D

I only missed the 'Previously on Defying Gravity' part on episode 11 because I could not find subtitles to match it in my language, but fortunately there are free (and easy) subtitle editors to solve it."
