Original title: BÃ¶deln Och SkÃ¶kan (The Headsman and the Harlot)

Plot:
A film set in the early 1700s. An innocent man (Niklas Ek) is sentenced to death on the charges of stealing silver. When the current executioner commits murder, he may have a chance to escape his own execution, but only if he assumes the executioner\'s job. As the executioner, he is hated by all. During a visit to the local brothel, he falls deeply in love with Ursula (Stephanie Sunna Hockett). 

Very rare Swedish historical drama, from Hrafn Gunnlaugsson who directed amonst many others, the legendary Viking film \"The Raven Flies\". This is set in the Middle Ages in Sweden and is a vivid depiction of life in those times. Described as like a Rembrandt painting coming to life, it\'s both beautiful and cruel, whilst also thrilling and astonishingly intimate. Certainly grim in places and with both violence and nudity it\'s not always a comfortable film to watch but then the Middle Ages weren\'t exactly an easy time in which to live!. Possibly the most authentic film ever on the Middle Ages, certainly one of the rarest.
