thanks for the tip, Neuview looks promising at first glance, but it utilizes the old Codecs, which is required to be installed on your system. 

The reason i like SPlayer, VLC, and the like: is the innovative 'Binary Codecs' technology. It bypasses the need to install Codec Packs, which do more harm than good. Download 'Autoruns', take a look at what's installed before and after installing any Codec Pack. It's outrageous! When you install Codec Packs, it's loaded at every system boot, regardless if it's needed, which increases boot time, and Codec Conflict is common.

Which is why i prefer SPlayer."
