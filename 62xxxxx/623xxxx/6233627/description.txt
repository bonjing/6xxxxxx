Personal Synopsis:
I have been on a search for the best Media Player. I want a player that will 
play any format i throw at it, but remain light, portable, and stealth. So i can
play it anywhere, carry it with me on my USB Stick, and not leave any trash on
the host computer. I have tested sooo many, including CyberLink, VLC, SMPlayer,
KMPlayer, Storm Player, QQ Player, MPlayer, etc.. 

The last one standing is SPlayer. It played everything i threw at it while 
remaining light, fast, and beautiful on the eyes. They even offer a portable
version on their site, but it's not 'Stealth', it leaves registry keys and files
behind. So i created this.. If you don't mind trash being left behind, you can 
download the official portable version from their site.

Stealth Notes:
- Encapsulated all registry entries

- Disabled Auto Update

Features:
- Low Consumption

- Extreme Compact
- Safe and Portable
- Automatic Matching Subtitle
