I have been involved with bodybuilding for the past 10 years and I have seen fads, trends, and scams come and go. Iâ€™ve literally spent thousands of dollars
on supplements, magazines, training systems, diets and weights in my effort to find the most powerful way to put muscle on fast.
Iâ€™ve also seen and studied how the supplement industry operates. Both as a customer buying up the latest craze, and as an "insider" with my own company. I must issue you a warning here. My discoveries will not only shock you but may make you a little upset. Thatâ€™s understandable. I felt exactly the same way when I first discovered this "inside information" of the supplement industry.
