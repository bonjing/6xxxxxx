The story is about a pair of young Thais, a loser guy ("Ter" Chantavit Thanasevi from Coming Soon) and a woman (new-face actress "Noonaa" Neungtida Sophon) who meet while traveling in South Korea.
the guy as he's being left at Bangkok's airport by his buddies. He has no luggage, is wearing only a T-shirt and jeans and has "dumped" written across his forehead in magic marker.
It's not apparent why he's going to South Korea, alone, on a package tour. He doesn't relate to the Thai fascination with Korean pop culture and hasn't even traveled very far outside of Thailand.
The young woman, also traveling alone, is on the same flight to Seoul, but is not part of the tour group.
A drunken first night in Seoul has the guy mistakenly eating dog then getting drunk and landing at the backpacker-hostel doorstep of the woman. She lets some words in Thai slip, and the guy, a lost and lonely puppy dog, sinks his teeth into her and won't let her go until she helps him.
He's lost in Seoul, been left by his tour group, has no luggage or warm clothes and can't speak much English or Korean. The woman takes pity on him and agrees to let him tag along on her tour of Korean TV-show locations, on the condition they don't tell each other their names.
