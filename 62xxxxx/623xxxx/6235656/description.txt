as usual :

no cd key,serial,crack,ect,ect...

Just the ISO file and a simple nfo txt as read-me,just a bit changed by me !

Please,use fast upload to download this torrent if you can.
I cannot give more than 1 Meg up and i'm already seeding multiple-torrents at the same time.
Opera brother torrent client is disallowed cause making huge trouble on trafic
That was the case for JetAudio yesterday night...
I monitoring each torrent that i let here.
Then i can see and discover,if a connection of a client is bad.
Don't worry,i don't spy anymore.
I just want to get the best possible trafic for each of my torrents.
...
use only : utorrent,bitspirit,shareaza,vuze/azureus on windows
All Linux users are allowed to use most of torrent clients excepted Opera brother
Please,again and again :
If you see that your upload or download freeze,then disconnect and search what's wrong about...
Ty for understanding
It will take probably a quite long time for you to get it and i'm sorry,i make
my best.
However if you are able to be patient :
I swear you will get it !
Seed asap ! and as long as you can !
I repeat : open your upstream to max (= 0,for unlimited to maximize your best upload speed
otherwise use a descent upload speed to increase speed down. trafic
I will need many seeders for help me !
file has been compressed to get smaller size and therefore should take less time to get which i hope and wish to all.
i hope you will be cooperative so !
