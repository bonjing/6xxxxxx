,ljparker,2011-04-18T02:02Z,"Hey there,

How do you go from disc one to disc two, etc. once you're done with a disc? Thanks"
,syuvial,2011-04-18T04:11Z,"I really love this game, but i've tried emulating it before, and it didn't turn out well. Is this a version in which the freezing and hangups are magically gone and everything is fun again?"
,blueskunk,2011-04-28T11:08Z,"this is a very good torrent, plays with no problems for me :)"
,hostile84,2011-05-11T18:22Z,"Every time I try to unzip disc one, i get an error message saying that it is either an unrecognized format or damaged....please help. "
,davitz,2011-08-16T14:16Z,probably noob question but how do i play this i have ePSXe working but i dont have an exe file in this dragoon download just a .7z so im stuck at how you get it to work in the emulator
,Starfish2483,2011-09-05T15:02Z,"@davitz - just extract the 7z file with winrar and you should get an iso file go to epsxe and go to file then run iso, and find your file.

@ljparker - when the game tells you to switch to disc 2, etc. press esc (on keyboard) go to file, and then change disc."
,Charzrls,2011-09-11T00:15Z,For some reason everything is playing really fast? What did I do wrong lol
,ralph123,2011-09-15T16:37Z,rename images from .iso to .bin this will enable the FMV sounds while playing under ePSXE 1.7

,heavenboun5520,2012-06-10T09:09Z,"The game keeps freezing on me during the last disk. When Im in Ulara and I talk to the chick that tells me where charle is, when I leave that area the game always freezes, has worked good until now. I also cannot go back disks, like when I have to travel back to fight Faust the game will not switch backwards. Any help would be appreciated."
