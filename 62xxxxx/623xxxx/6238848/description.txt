5 skins for PowerDVD 10 Mark II build 2701:

Black, Gamut, Kopimi, Kopimiiiiii & TPB (The Pirate Bay)


Changes between the default and the modified skins:

- Replaced the backgrounds* and removed the Feature Icons (logos)
- Changed the autohide delay from the tabs to 1 sec (default = 3)
- Smaller Mini Mode: removed the Cyberlink logo & the Config button
- Fixed Mini Mode buttons (the white lines) + black Volume Control
- Removed the Upgrade button and the divider before the Help button

* credits from the backgrounds go to the original creators!!


Install:

Extract the Skinpack to the skins directory and run the batch file of the skin that 
you want to use. You can switch back to the default skin by running BlackSatin.bat

The skins apply per user account, so each user can apply its own preferred skin.


Cheers,
