,the_shroud,2011-03-13T05:34Z,"Hi 20-40, Thx for the upload. I heard the bluray contains a short called Tron: The Next Day that bridges the 2 films. Is that included in here?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-13T08:12Z,"@the_shroud: Just a movie, my friend. Otherwise, I would mention an inclusion..."
,bender1110,2011-03-13T14:49Z,Good movie - but GREAT movie @ imax (sound + expanded picture)
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-13T20:16Z,"Well, five mouths in my family have 76 cents per day for food (when we pay our bills). Tickets to cinema costs approx. 4,2 bucks, per capita of course. I cannot leave my house (almost bed-ridden). So, your ""great"" turns into ""fuck the pirates - give your money to Holly-Bolly, they need it more than you"". That equals to ""Fuck you twentyforty"", right?"
,the_shroud,2011-03-14T08:04Z,"OK, much thx anyway. Sorry for late reply, been offline for a while. Still grateful I can get back on unlike those in Japan. My thoughts to victims of the Tsunami"
,mrmigo22,2011-03-14T12:42Z,i want to seed this can some one explain to me how i can do it please?
,bender1110,2011-03-15T06:57Z,"eh I dont know where u came up with that from great movie @ imax. I know about ur situation and it wasnt even directed at you. I know you dont go to the movies but you do have to realize some people do.
btw. I didnt pay so does that help? "
