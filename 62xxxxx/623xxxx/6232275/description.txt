In this 1991 album, plenty of the Ridgway elements which supplied the vitality to previous releases are present - but more avant garde tones are starting to be introduced. Mini, ambient compositions punctuate the main tracks and an increasingly experimental tone is adopted as the album wears on. Boasts one of Ridgway's most haunting and moving songs, "Right Through You," while "Harry Truman", "Roadblock", and the other-worldly "Beyond Tomorrow" make for a richly varied pallette that transports the listener from rural towns to the farthest reaches of the galaxy; from historical tragedies to lives in the balance; the album embodies them all. The delusionary underdog epic "I Wanna Be A Boss" is the albums sole single and ends up on morning drive time radio shows throughout the U.S. and in the U.K. Off on tour again.
