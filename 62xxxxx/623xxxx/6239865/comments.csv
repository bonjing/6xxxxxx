this is not a freedom restriction, this is a straight way of life and islam give you the right way of doing everything right and YOU have THE CHOICE,,,, islam does'nt force you to stick to it , but tell you how to be a complete nice person< and that is why many people go to islam, you think he is leaving his freedom, but for him he take it as if he is going to learn the perfect way of life

it only need an open mind to understand this, open mind that differentiate between freedom restriction and a perfect way of life

sorry brother if I disturb you, I just want to clear the idea, you have the choice to understand or not

Ahmad
