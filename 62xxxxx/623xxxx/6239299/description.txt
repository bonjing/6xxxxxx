mp3   320kbps   with covers


This was recorded during a saturday night party at home.
So the participants were a bit pissed...
and check out the back cover for the guest list...WOW!




If you're into Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee
then you might want to download this.   'Cause
they were amongst the guests...and this is real
difficult to get.


The audio quality is damn good.


And this album itself is a fuckin' masterpiece.


A rare gem and one of the finest blues albums
you'll ever have in your collection.


IMAO...it's that fuckin' good...


And where blues is concerned...it takes a lot to
impress me...BUT THIS DOES
