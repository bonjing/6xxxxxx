I donâ€˜t know how much anyone knows about Ernst Zundelâ€˜s life, but his wife Ingrid did a great job making this video.., despite having to use almost all old VHS video cassette material... 

Other than that, I would rate the video and audio quality (for a home-made documentary) as A9 / V9 "
[S],velvet.,2011-03-10T23:28Z,"Ernst Christof Friedrich Zündel is a German Holocaust denier and pamphleteer who was jailed several times in Canada for publishing literature which ""is likely to incite hatred against an identifiable group"" and for being a threat to national security, in the United States for overstaying his visa, and in Germany for charges of ""inciting racial hatred.""
He lived in Canada from 1958 to 2000.

Use of the international standard of date notation would prevent this confusion."

Ya know.., I find it quite amazing at times, how some people are so ""biased"" in their thoughts (and just resort to ""name-calling"").., that they seem to have an attitude that virtually says: ""I've already got my mind made-up.., so PLEASE don't confuse me with the facts"" !!

As it has been sooo correctly said by others in history.., ""Truth does NOT fear investigation""...

Also another important point to consider is:

""He who wins the War.., also writes the History"" !!

Yes / No ??"
,Borzoi,2011-05-04T22:42Z,"Oh.., and BTW.., the ""scheme"" that was used to deport AND imprison Mr. Zundel, was by way of a ""bogus entrapment"" arrest for violating one VERY small immigration law on Feb 5 2003.  It was done in order to shut down the projects (a library of informational archives) that Mr. Zundel and his wife (Ingrid) were working on at their residence in Tennessee.

This ""great and egregious violation"" of the US immigration law, was nothing more than Mr. Zundel missing the very routine ""2nd interview"" (30 minutes maximum !) that was to be with his American wife.  This interview is to prove that they had a ""bona-fide marriage"" (bank accounts, housing, insurance, photos, etc.)  It's required approximately one year after an immigrant marries a US citizen (at which time is the 1st interview with an immigration agent).  This 2nd interview is nothing more than a follow-up.

But, here's ""the twist"" !!  What ""they"" did.., was to change his interview appointment to an earlier date, but without first notifying him !!   So of course, when he didn't show up for his appointment, they just came to his home (multiple armed agents at that !) and arrested him.  What an easy and cowardly ""set-up"" it was !!

That led to two years in a Canadian prison, and another 5 years in a German prison.  FINALLY, as of March 1st, 2010, he's now living in the 400+ year old house of his ancestors (needing MUCH work) in south-western Germany.

The problem is.., he cannot come back to the USA for another 20 years because of his ""violation"", AND his wife cannot go to ANY of the European countries for fear of being arrested, just because she runs a web-site dealing with ""Non-PC"" subjects !!

So until they can win some kind of legal battle, on either of these two VERY controlled continents, these two VERY devoted and loving people can only on RARE occasions (and at GREAT expense) be with each other.., but it MUST be in a ""neutral country"" !!"
