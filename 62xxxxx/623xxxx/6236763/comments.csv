,tisk,2011-03-12T22:20Z,Seriously zakimar1? The Templar Knights were disbanded 800 years ago and you take offense because an author of a graphic novel uses the myth surrounding them for his fictional story?

that's the point, the templar in this comic are a bunch of racists, bigots and murderers. this comic was meant to inform people of the racism going on ATM.
the templar in this comic are the antagonists, the bad guys, the evil power hungry racists, and what better to inform people about racisim than potraying racists in the comic, as the bad guys."
