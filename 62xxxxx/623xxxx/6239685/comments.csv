I like how they tell you what he is saying, when he is speaking cligon or whatever."

,Gondie8472,2011-03-21T04:48Z,"Looks Decent, not playable on PS3 though. Protected by an audio watermark called Cinavia. It is an in-audible code in the audio track. The PS3, and some Blu-ray players will check the audio source for the watermark, and recognise that it is not being played in a theatre like the watermark states it should be. Works fine on a PC though. A-6, V-7. not bad quality. thanks for the upload."
