OMG"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-13T09:40Z,O Well I guess for now it stays here I have had to try 4 times before I managed to up and post in here and because of the volume of the text in the description it kinda locks thing up in the posting. The contents are the description which is a copy of all of the comments together as torrent from all the information I have posted.
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-13T09:41Z,I think I may be a little distracted in here. You think my spelling and grammar was bad before...or as Cheech and Chong said in Denmark...did you just that thing fly across the room....
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-13T09:43Z,"And Please PLease do not Flame in here on this post despite all temptations. I did not meen to post in here. This is a very serious complicated post rying to bring attention to a close friend of mines suicide when he was fourteen from the abuse we were suffering.
At least in those things give respct to him and flame if you need to in how incredibly hard to believe the info in this post is. It is real. I am trying to post out of here in casee other have limited this setting."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-13T10:29Z,jeez this is like posting on 4chan :)
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T09:29Z,"I am switching to my blogspot wintersbutterfly.

I will also tweet new posts.

TheTwitsEnd

I have two new posts. This one and one called Uncle. I will start seeding this in just a little while.

If possible I will only tweet new posts rather than comment in here.
I have had no desire in the past to tweet.

U do not need to follow but if u can search for my account name or the usual tag wintersbutterfly.
If I lose the blog I will just torrent my backup here. thx

I will try a few more songs soon...if I find any I ever like. I will post them here on tpb someday when I feel comfortable with them."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T09:36Z,"btw in here is some how by my fault an entire section missing on comments about JFK and Bobby's campaign manager OBrian's relation with Hughes, the firing of Cox and the resulting missing 18 minutes.
and our neighbors the Russos and their possible connection with Jim Garrisons lead witness in Clay Shaws trial.
Strange facts that float around from the past is all, but interesting anyway. I think I missed alot of comments in this post...If interested u may want to scan the other posts"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-15T13:51Z,"Actually I just wanted an excuse to come in her to see the Porn Ad at the Top....  :)


If I am not mistaken my utorrent shows 385 ratio with a number of megabytes DL. 

I really should have posted in here to begin with.

Anyway...thx..alot

And check out a post by clicking above on wintersbuttefly to see the directory of my posts. The new one is Cat's Eye.

It is just of random interest.


It contains references mention about OBrian....


The only thing in her otherwsie is Chris Russos comment ot me after Eddie died that his family was in the New Orleans Mafia. They moved right after Eddie died. I have Chris' pictures through out my year books. He is real. And he didn't say hey I think I'm related to the guy in Jim Garrisons prosecution in New Orleans of Clay Shaw.

He said the New Orleans Mafia. I thought he was full crap at the time. I had never heard of it myself til many years later.

And Compare the name in my dad's work journal among other entires I posted that listed a Tom Rasso or Russo as a contact back in 64...

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-16T00:19Z,"It has now been over two weeks since the OK SLO's and a member on the board of MHAT responded in emails stating their desire to investigate these reports I have made. That afternoon instead two officers came to my apartment and informed me that I was no longer to email anyone but the OK SLO - who of course did not respond for three months after receiving her email from Childwelfare.gov, who is now also refusing to respond again.
I originally sent the OK SLO for DHS 4 emails in December detailing the extent of what was involved. For three months, until I posted these torrents she never responded further after requesting the information from me.
2 weeks since the officers responded, she again refuses to acknowledge this in email. She has not responded to my two or three emails since the officers came out. I have not emailed her in week.
There is no email concerning an investigation or a refusal to investigate. None. And neither has MHAT responded in any form. Not email or letter.
And Saturday I sent a 3rd email to ChildWelfare.gov asking who I could send email to when State Authorities refuse to respond. ChildWelfare.gov has not responded.
No one has asked me to stop posting or seeding here or anything at all. They simply will not acknowledge these reports at all. All the way from the State to the Federal Level. Even the Obama Administration through White House staff have been informed of what is happening. No one will respond in anyway."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-16T00:19Z,"I have now seeded over four hundred downloads of one of the major posts cantaining at least most of the information and comments in these posts. I am receiving about 30 visits a day on my Blog.
I know have Graig list account which required 7 days of waiting to be able to Post.
I will now on Craig s List forums internationally in their Political Forums to increase the traffic here.
I feel it has become to document this publicly in the governments refusal at this point not only to fail to investigate but they will not in anyway respond. Except with Police Officers."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-23T09:43Z,I am concentrating on uploading my piano music...I see people always in here attempting to dl....If you'd.. like the music is not bad...and for me it verifies what I have said. For 50 years none of my friends or even I - knew I could play like this til it came back last year in a rush of memories after one of my nephews was being hurt...again. Sometime I hte what I play and yet it is more than just plunking down chords...And yet I have no idea...even the chords I am choosing...no idea what I am playing in the chord structures at all.
