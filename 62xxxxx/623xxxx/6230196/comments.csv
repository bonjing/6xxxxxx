,bert16,2011-03-10T04:32Z,"No offense to anyone and I respect everyone's tastes, especially when it comes to computers. But I can't understand for the life of me why anyone would still be using Windows XP in this day and age. Of course if the person has an old computer and no means to upgrade it, then it makes sense."
,kami2k,2011-03-10T06:05Z,does it include all the hotfixs till march?
,avatar_24,2011-03-10T09:00Z,"@bert16

I have Win7 but i'll always recommend XP for those who have no money for the new comp.or just wanna speed, instead of shiny icons,aero features etc.Did you ever try BE (pirated) of XP?Do you know that every file in that XP  is decoded into assembly language.This is copyright violation..lol."

,milkytech,2011-03-11T17:01Z,"@bert16...

There are many reasons someone would want to run xp this day and age. For instance:

1.  One might have a security system whose proprietary media player will only work on XP and earlier.  Won't play on 7.
2.  One might have an older pc that still kicks ass because one built it themself with the best components possible in 2001 but some of the hardware (video card) doesn't have any drivers for OS's newer than XP.
3.  One might want to embed audio in an email. I have researched this diligently and it seems this can only be done via Outlook Express on XP SP1 or earlier.  After SP2 no mas.  
4.  One might think your a fucking retard and want to install XP out of spite!"

,nekti,2011-03-15T21:47Z,"I completely agree with ntire2000,bert ur fucking stupid...besides...win xp rulzzzz..win 7 trash"
,bert16,2011-03-16T03:25Z,"ntire2000 - let me clarify that when I posted the question about why people would still want XP, I was referring to people like me (and possibly you) who didn't pay a dime for Win 7. Of course it makes perfect sense that in a corporate environment where you can't simply download a torrent. upgrading to 7 has many disadvantages (eg., the price, old computers that run well on XP, and my favorite: the fact that you can't just upgrade, it's gotta be a fresh install for it to run well."

[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-03-19T12:44Z,"@coolshahzad

well... if you made an USB drive to install from, the origin of your problem might be the inability to point toward the booting information, either due to a missconfigured bios to firstly try booting from USB device, or an error on your flash drive. check bios first booting device and also don't ""stuck"" with ""win 2 flash software"" try other methods googlin' for it 

if you receive that error only when dealing with 64 bits xp, then use win to flash while being in an 64 bits environment ! meaning you have to install a 64 bits version on your computer anyway... prior to convert an 64 bits version OS to flash drive ;) 

because there are some differences of interpretation if you are on a platform already (32bits) and trying to adjust something aiming the other platform (64bits)"

,BearGrizzle,2011-03-26T02:19Z,Well heres a good reason into wanting XP instead of windows 7 it uses alot less juice when you watch a movie or you are downloading a huge torrent or even when your little ones want to play snes or N64 or playstation or wii emulator its shows on your electric bill its suprising how much juice windows 7 sucks out just for shiney icons and if you are smart and you run it on high performance witch uses 100% of your processors capabillitys instead of the default of 50% it sucks out electricity big time.

windows 7 is ok, but with regards to performance i'd chose windows xp...
