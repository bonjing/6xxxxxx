,robbib,2011-03-11T02:54Z,PLEASE stop rar'ing that stuff...
[V],DibyaTPB,2011-03-11T03:04Z,.
[V],DibyaTPB,2011-03-11T03:05Z,Need to get stuff fast?? Then you will get rarred and unraring a 176 mb file does not takes much time or space. Dont be so lazy to do few clicks..
,robbib,2011-03-11T03:09Z,"Nvm, no thanks. I rather wait another 10min and download another one. In the end its the same release and c'mon... sitting at 32mbit i dont care about not even 10 more mbyte.

Thanks for answering though."
[V],DibyaTPB,2011-03-11T04:31Z,Well well your wish. Most scene stuff comes rared. I rarely unrar them which are quite popular and then it takes time to post.. Anyway i rarely post tv shows beside UFC and WWE. I will post less shows(i dont want to compete with the bots) but all of them will be seeded perfectly with good speed. EnjoY!!!
