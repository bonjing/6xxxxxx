,desserts,2011-03-14T06:04Z,"Did you disconnect from net, patch your hosts file and select ""Adobe Creative Suite Master Collection CS5"" from the keygen menu?  Try serial 1325-1764-6193-4470-7874-9578."
,Polopaul,2011-03-19T20:00Z,"when i open the cs5 folder it only shows another folder called acrabat x pro, inside there is a AcroPro installer, does that have CS5 on it, where is the key gen? looks like alot of missing stuff, also what about the amtlib.dll patches?"
,Polopaul,2011-03-19T20:25Z,"disregard my previous comment, found the rar cs5 file floating in the download folder, will try it tomorrow and let u know, thx"

I installed and everything worked perfect.

Can I install updates?

Thanks!!!!"
,Dylan10,2011-04-09T21:09Z,"I do what the instructions said but everytime i open a program says the same thing ""not valid serial number"" I had to download the programs individualy from your torrent becuse it only worked that way(computer slow i guess).

so like this program only usable offline> becuse i put the internet cord back in it pulls that message up all the time.

PLEASE HELP!"

Maybe you must generate other serial. I followed these steps:

1. generate a new serial
2. disconnect the cable
3. manually edit the host file 
4. Install

works without problem.

My only question is whether I can install updates"
,Dylan10,2011-04-13T05:11Z,"well thats strange becuse i used the keygen corretly becuse it accepted it but yeah maybe i have like 5 different serials on the programs so maybe thats the issue but since ive never had this before i wouldnt know, i think il stay with it offline and not use it with the internet, since i shouldnt update it anyways."
,Dylan10,2011-04-30T18:53Z,"The answer to the updates are probably not, i dont see why you guys want the updates anyways. i mean what more do you need?"
,AJJON1,2011-05-03T21:39Z,"Gerat job desserts!
