Better Love Next Time offers help in coping with the pain and heartache of a bad breakup, but more than that, it reveals how to overcome the lingering damage that a broken relationship can leave behind â€“ how to heal your romantic soul. J.M. Kearns presents a simple (and entertaining) way to diagnose what went wrong, so history won't have to repeat itself, and explains how to decode the "guide to compatibility" written in your own past. Witty, frank, and full of real-life stories, Better Love Next Time ensures that when you do find a new love, you will arrive whole, renewed, and empowered to make it the one that lasts.
