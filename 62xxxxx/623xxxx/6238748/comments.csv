Also when getting the final , also get the lastminute fix torrent for the final as it contains fixes for some start.bats.
If u know your way around DOSbox there is no need for this but is an easy fix that overwrites those old faulty batfiles.

,thisismylongnickname,2012-03-26T09:36Z,"I have just downloaded about 6 GBs  in over 4 weeks. I hope I can get the full torrent in another month or so, but looking at the current rate, will take another 6 months :(

For those thinking it's just my connection - I have downloaded other torrents at a rate of about 1 GB per hour."
