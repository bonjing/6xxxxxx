,k11o,2011-03-11T11:24Z,"Update: If you have the virus follow these steps:

1. Download and run a rootkit scanner. TDSSKILLER is a good and free. (find on google)

2. Download and run a malware scanner. PCTools Spyware Doctor is good free one.

3. Download and run CCleaner with advanced settings. Also free.

You should be good to go. Rootkit virus's like these are nasty. Good luck."

So in order to take out the virus i gotta do those steps right? do i have to take out the music as well?

@k11o 
I did what you said and everything seems to be fine, do you think theres any chance that this Rootkit could still be hidden somewhere in the computer?"
