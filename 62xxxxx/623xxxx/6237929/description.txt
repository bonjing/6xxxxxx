DIVX DVD RIP  ENGLISH VER  NO SUBS

In this sequel to the 1954 cult classic, two pilots (Hiroshi Koizumi and Minoru Chiaki) land on a remote 
island and stumble upon the earth-shaking terror of two gigantic beasts locked in battle, one of which is later 
determined to be a relative of the infamous city-stomping Godzilla. The enormous reptiles disappear into 
the ocean, only to reignite their mighty clash in Osaka, where the two monsters naturally bring mass destruction to the city.
