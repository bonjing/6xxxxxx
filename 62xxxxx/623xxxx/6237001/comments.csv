,Riski24,2011-05-16T06:34Z,"great upload, excellent quality"
,DPooch,2011-06-20T22:33Z,"Slight bummer that the final act episodes are in Japanese, but they thankfully have English subtitles.
Otherwise, great quality, thanks for the upload. I will continue to seed this great series as much as I can."
,Diveus,2011-06-22T19:25Z,"@DPooch - If you check wikipedia for final act, the dubbing hasn't started yet. They only started casting the voice dub team."
,Faquad_Klown,2011-07-15T04:21Z,"ok, first, thanks for this up.
now my prob. lol

my wife had this on her old laptop and played via vlc, worked great.  eng lang, no subs.

however it wont play via vlc on this one at all and everything else either goes to original audio or plays eng audio but with subs.

how can we remove the subs?  windows media player fix preferred but whatever works for win 7 64bit would be fine if we need to get her new soft.

thanks"

A: 4/10 (annoying high-pitched noise; poor quality)

It's really difficult to watch due to the audio. I wouldn't recommend downloading this."
,potaness,2012-01-11T04:15Z,this is english dubbed! 
,sammyymarie,2012-01-13T06:03Z,can you upload season 6 by itself???!?!?! please!?
,h62anklol,2012-02-02T12:13Z,hay can any body upload inuyasha final act english dub complete..............or atleast upload the cmplete audio of the final act english dub episode 1-26........please any one.....
,phat_71,2012-02-13T04:04Z,"Half a brain and 5 seconds worth of google searching and you guys would know that The Final Act hasn't BEEN dubbed yet, and so clearly it's not going to be available in anything other than Japanese audio.

Also, anybody who's having troubles with the audio, you're an idiot. Upgrade player/codecs, and try again. You people really should know these simple things if you're actually going to bother downloading a torrent in the first place, it's not that difficult..."
