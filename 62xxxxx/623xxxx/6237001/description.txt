Most of my uploads are encoded / compressed to their smallest possible
file size. The quality IMO is still pretty decent though for the filesizes. But,
those of you who have a higher res monitor, may notice a drop in quality,
if this bothers you, then look elsewhere... I will not bend on my methods.
Thank you to those that enjoy my torrents.., I enjoy sharing them with you.
Feel free to pm me if you're looking for something, or have a question???

MKV on X-Box 360 & PS-3
The best media server I have used is "PS3 Media Server", which
despite the name apparently works with the 360 as well. It's super
simple to install and much less bloated than any of the other
options that I've tried. (like Tversity, Orb, Mediahome)

Or if you prefer to convert the files for direct download
onto your machine you can use mkv2vob.





Due to the high volume of requests I recieve. Please only pm me if you have a
question or request. All "thank you's" should be left in the comment section.
