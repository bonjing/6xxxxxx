This is the follow up album to the famous Nothing Sacred album. This is a must have for any DAC fan, it maybe elusive and hard to find a good copy of, but can be done. The songs are very funny, & witty. This cd is not for the faint of heart. David is not a racist, as another person seems to think, David even has a black person in his band. This is recommended for all die hard DAC fans.
