,some-young-guy,2011-03-13T00:23Z,Many language majors suggest that English is probably the most retarded of all languages.  Everyone learning English would only accommodate laziness of ones not wanting to adopt a more efficient language.

Oh yeah: and I propose that anyone who is enough of a chair sniffer to wax intellectual, PARTICULARLY over the pro's and con's of a LANGUAGE, only to use such parochial, outdated terms(retarded? REALLY?)... I don't know. I can think of no suitable punishment for such a walking cliche.
Besides, it was obviously a joke. Save your self-righteous indignation for people who are willing to pretend they care.
Oh yeah: your mother is a fat, disease carrying, son of a motherless goat. So are English majors. Go major in something ""more efficient,"" like training you tonsils to ""accommodate"" the ""laziness"" of my BALLS! Is THAT RETARDED enough for you "
