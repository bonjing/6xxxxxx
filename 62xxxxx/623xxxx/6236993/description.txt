Michishio Nagasumi's life couldn't be anymore normal. In an odd twist of
events, during his summer vacation he ends up almost drowning in the sea.
Luckily, the cute mermaid Seto San appears to save him. However, San is from
a yakuza mermaid family and according to their law, if a human is to catch sight
of a mermaid, either he or the mermaid must die. The only other way is for
Nagasumi to be taken in as a family member, marrying San. In attempts
to save both of their lives, Nagasumi asks for San's hand in marriage.
Nagasumiâ€™s summer vacation reaped more then what he would
expect, as he must now protect San from others
finding her secret out.

Most of my uploads are encoded / compressed to their smallest possible
file size. The quality IMO is still pretty decent though for the filesizes. But,
those of you who have a higher res monitor, may notice a drop in quality,
if this bothers you, then look elsewhere... I will not bend on my methods.
Thank you to those that enjoy my torrents.., I enjoy sharing them with you.
Feel free to pm me if you're looking for something, or have a question???
