I am a victim of Childhood sexual abuse.
I should never had to got to this point to get someone to respond, not just investigate, but respond to my repeated reports over twenty years that have gone unreported to the appropriate agencies. It is the law that such reports be passed on to appropriate agencies concerning these reports and they are not being reported by the various hospitals, clinics, doctors, and case managers I have reported this to for over twenty year.
The law does not state that organizations are only required to pass on the cases they believe are true. It states by LAW it is required to pass on ALL reports of Child Abuse to DHS.
DHS WILL NOT REPSOND in any form at all now.
They refused to investigate 2 years ago my 17 year old nephew having to force his father from the house with a baseball bat after her husband pushed her and broke both her wrists.
They did not investigate because two weeks after I spent an hour on the phone with them, and my Case Manager followed up, DHS said the di not investigate because they insufficient information.
This is not slander on my part, or harassment.
I am not trying to sue anyone.
I want NOTHING in this the protection of my nephews and other adults who as children were hurt by these people.
If they investigated and found nothing to support my claims that is one thing.
But they are not and haven't fro twenty years. And MHAT has not responded about their President Elects involvement in this when he was 19.
Only the Police came to my door and told me to stop.
This is not right."

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T14:23Z,"am losing connection every ten minutes from someone flooding through my upnp settings in my router.
In order to stay on the net I am having to disable upnp and thus shut don utorretn. I could open an indivual port, but that would not help.
This last attack not only knocked me off the net again, but it removed my usb wirlees from my hardware. It removed it.
The same thing happened last night. It took me two hours to get the operating system to recognize the usb device again.
I am using an new N usb Wirlees reciever with no problems unless I attempt to seed these posts.
And it is getting very frequent now as I posted these last posts.
Most of the information is up. Again the actual copies of the documents concerning thes posts are on a thumb drive with a friend.
I will repost these in the future if the seeders drop them.
Until then I hope the few people I have seen DL these will seed them for me now.
I have to close uTorrent and my upnp at this point. I can barely stay on the net otherwise."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T14:28Z,"If nothing else in this post at the moment since I was not to even do an itinitial seed of a 1.81 kb file I hope someone can copy the discription of this post and re UL it as torrent for me. with the tag Winterbutterfly.
If not I will try to reseed at some point soon.

I am no longer having problems on the net now that I have closed my upnp ports and stopped seeding.
I have now decided to provide the original documents in a rar file soon to verify what I am saying."

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T15:38Z,My sister explained to me a few years ago that what happened the night we shut down IAL was that my father hide his company in USTC to avoid a million dollar fine. She told me directly that the company stopped existing to avoid the fine. It took me years to realize that IAL which in the '60s was valued at $2 Million had become a major component of USTC which when sold to SGS of Switzerland in the 1990's was valued at $160 Million
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T15:43Z,"My father eventually became Sr VP of USTC and director of the Certification Division. He represented the company in Tokyo to MITI securing a government recognition of USTC as the only inspection agency to inspect products shipped into Japan. It was my fathers Certification program and recognition from MITI that encouraged SGS to pirchase USTC.
SGS now test 3% of all products in the world. USTC is now SGS North America.
Another reason for the purchase of USTC by SGS was the Hanover nuclear plant in Washington State.
But at shortly before SGS purchased USTC my father was aware that the US government was investigating forgeries involved at Hanover which resulted after the purchase of USTC in the fine against USTC and suspension of further USTC work in that field."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T15:45Z,"A few years ago my father told me that along with attempting to work on the construction of the Black Fox nuclear plant in OK.
USTC did work across the US in the Nuclear Plant construction field.
Including the work on Three Mile Island."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T15:48Z,"And again if you do not hear from me again on this for awhile it may be that people are more concerned about shutting me up than keeping these people from hurting children, and also in many other various forms, they seem to be above the law.
Is that because of Bud's involvement in Intelligence in WWI or my fathers."

Please pay close attention to the comments in the other post"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T15:55Z,"I have said repeatedly this is in no way bullshit.
I have no commented enough information for anyone interested to verify for themselves the contents of these posts.
Again as victim of sexual abuse I should never had to been forced to go this point in my concern for my nephews.
This is inexcusable."
