Xcode Final build 4A304a



Xcode is the complete developer toolset for creating applications for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. This package installs the Xcode IDE, the Instruments analysis tool, iOS Simulator, and OS framework bundles in the form of Mac OS X SDKs and iOS SDKs.
 
Xcode 4 requires an Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later, and includes SDKs for Mac OS X 10.6 and iOS 4.3. To develop apps targeting prior versions of Mac OS X or iOS, see the section titled About SDKs and the iOS Simulator below.
Xcode 4 does not support developing for PowerPC; you must continue to use Xcode 3.2.6 to develop applications for the PowerPC architecture. The Custom Install section below has instructions to install both Xcode 4 and Xcode 3.2.6 on the same Mac.
