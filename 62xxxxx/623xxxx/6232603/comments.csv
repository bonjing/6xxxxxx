,dghle4,2011-03-11T09:27Z,"Burned it but did not work. XBox start to read it 3 times and stops. Using latest dashboard & LT.

This is an improved version of stoked released in 2008 in the US."

,dghle4,2011-03-14T08:10Z,Did a test with CD DVD speed & disk was bad. Reburned and now it works great. 
,General__Lee,2011-03-15T02:02Z,"Just burnt this and its telling me to install an update in order to play this game.
Is it safe to install the update or can it effect the flash?"
,polarhawk,2011-03-24T18:38Z,"have the same question as the general, is it safe to run the firmware upgrade the game asks for?"
