,12uel,2011-03-11T03:47Z,Great upload. Thanks so much for uploading great titles and for making the audio in AC3 format so I can listen in surround sound via my PS3 and receiver. Some uploaders use AAC 6-ch which my PS3 only outputs to downsized stereo. Is there a way around this that you know of or this is just the way it is with all PS3 in dealing with 6-channel AAC?
,12uel,2011-03-11T03:50Z,"In terms of subtitles, is there a way I can watch your movies with subtitles on my PS3? Can you do them in the future? If not I understand but please explain....thanks..."

i believe there is a way for stereos to play 6 channel aac but it would require a new modern stereo.  I dont have a ps3 or such a stereo."

,Critic_101,2011-03-11T14:24Z,"Well just my 2 bits, Ps3 does support soft subs but just not with m4v a.k.a mp4. If you want soft subs to play on ps3 download any avi xvid divx format video and use the software xsub to add soft subs to your video. I have used upto two soft subs embeded in same video file on ps3 and works fine."
