[T],honchorella31,2011-03-14T09:56Z,@horgin34  NO i will still use imageshack if u get a little frog in an icecube when u click on the screenshot link just copy and paste it in2 ya search bar it still works easy as that. maybe next time a please or a thanks 4 the upload would help. but i suppose sum people r just picky.

,aaronp6l,2011-07-09T15:26Z,All you have to do is right click on the link and say open in new tap to see the pic. And if that still dosnt work for you then you should stop using Firefox or Internet Explorer and use Google Chrome.
