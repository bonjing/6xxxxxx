Papoose "The Most Lyrical One" 

Born in Brooklyn, New York City by Liberian and Native American parents, Papoose made his first attempts at rapping at the age of 7. He was given his name by his grandma Vivian because of his childhood resemblance to a Native American child. Inspired by Kool G Rap, Rakim and Big Daddy Kane he made his first appearance & became known to the public when he appeared in 1998 on Kool G Rap's Roots of Evil album.[1] The following year, he released his first single, "Thugication"/"Alphabetical Slaughter".
