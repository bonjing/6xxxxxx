,kaliesdad,2011-03-12T03:08Z,"Experiencing technical difficulties with my PS3.  Lately most of the movies I download for my PS3 say they are unsupported, but not all.  Tangled worked just fine, but it’s the only one that has worked in some time now.  I’ve tried renaming the files like you suggest in your description with no luck.  All play extremely well on my PC’s (Thank You!) but every now and again we like to watch them when we are home.  Any help would be appreciated, Thank You."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-12T03:57Z,What method of ps3 playback do you use?  A technical change was implemented starting with unstoppable. Did all films prior to this work?  Any since unstoppable?  Only report on HR works. Any other ps3 users out there?  Comment on status. 
,Colourform,2011-03-12T05:34Z,I have been having issues with playback on ps3. Usually your mp4 worked flawlessly. All using PMS. I tried upgrading then reinstalling java etc. Now I went back to original format and have been dicking with it for the last 2 days.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-12T06:05Z,Try good old fashion USB stick please. 
,12uel,2011-03-12T06:27Z,"I have no issues with my PS3 during playback. I have version 3.5. All of the movies i have downloaded from you worked flawlessly, that is, after transferring from my USB flash drive to the PS3 hard drive. There are no hiccups when i play a movie from the PS3 hard drive but plenty of pauses when played from my USB drive hooked up to the PS3. Just my 2 cents."
,Critic_101,2011-03-12T10:29Z,"No issues with playing videos on Ps3 so far all work fine even the ones after unstoppable and the only issue might be with columbia sony pictures since they have cinavia audio protection in their movies, but their is a workaround for that also so all movies play fine. Except for a slight pause when you change audio tracks. Hope this is helpful HR thanx."
,Colourform,2011-03-12T15:04Z," I have never uploaded anything to my ps3 using a stick. I have used Ps3 media server 1.10.51 since I purchased the ps3 with no problems. M2ts, mp4, m4v, and avi seem to work the best for me. I am hardwired again and working just fine. Had to change some codecs and move some things around. The answers are there if you put in the time."
,hippygonemad13,2011-03-12T15:58Z,Thanks for the upload HR!
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-12T16:31Z,"ok, sounds like the ps3 issues are isolated issues regarding setup or playback methods."
,ultimagic,2011-03-12T18:02Z,"hey HR, are you familiar with this site?
http://getvideoartwork.com/"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-12T19:34Z,yes
,Sneaner,2011-03-12T19:44Z,Thanks for the upload HR! I get all my movies from you. Any word on Harry Potter Deathly Hallows?
,Romeox0306,2011-03-13T04:48Z,Iron Man 1???? Please
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-13T18:22Z,"Looks like ""Monsters"" on netflix is one of the first titles to support Dolby Digital playback via Apple TV iOS 4.3."
,noOrp,2011-03-15T14:39Z,"@ HR, 

could you please uploading your screens on tinypic, photobucket, anywhere else except imageshack..... 

unable to see the screens, even after following what's written here.... even after being logged in on imageshack ! "
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-15T19:42Z,connect using firefox and using the https protocol instead of http.  then clicking the links will work.
,sinand99,2011-03-16T00:26Z,"screenshots dont work! imageshack is a shitty site! Always upload screens to bayimg, you idiot!"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T01:12Z,what?  imageshack is the best there is in my experience.  i'm sorry you can't follow simple instructions.  i'm sure i am also far smarter than you.
,noOrp,2011-03-16T06:29Z,"@ HR,

tried doing all the above mate,

even signed up on imageshack ...

couldn't see the pics even while being logged in...


maybe use photobucket or something ....which is easier for you to upload & us to see :)"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-16T13:06Z,"(Connect to TPB using the https protocol if you wish the below images to be clickable links.  Otherwise use Google Chrome and right click and open in new tab.)

logging into imageshack or having an imageshack account has nothing to do with it.  If you copy the URL and open a new tab and paste the URL it will also work."
,themorningstar69,2011-03-16T17:11Z,"My only comment to everyone complaining about imageshack is, why do you need to see screens?  HR's work is always the best quality.  If I convert something for iTunes, then an HR download becomes available, I delete my version and download his.  Past, Present, and Future review of all HR HD torrents:

,Vishnu1976,2011-03-30T15:08Z,"HR-

Just writing because I have been downloading your torrents for some time and have to say you are BY FAR the best uploader for movies on the ps3!!! I really like the way you do the two tracks of audio...FIST POUND

Just letting you know I ALWAYS play your files on my ps3 and have never had any problems. I will post back if any problems occur with this one, but I always use a flash drive and always have the latest update. Nice Work"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-31T18:47Z,"great good to know.  the 2 tracks are for compatibility purposes and they also have to be in the order that they are.  a lot of people complain about it, but it will never change.  blame everything on apple :/"
,repeater1,2011-04-01T23:53Z,"Your Encodes are usualy spot on.
360 and PS3 studder.
TVersity is not able to transcode for the Iphone either. when played threw MPC the ration is incorrect and is stretched.
Compared to your release of ""Red"" which played fine on all 3 devices and MPC
I compared ""Red"" to ""TRON"" with Media Info but could not tell where the difference lies.

If you could revert back to how you were previously encoding. That would be awesome.

It could be on my end but I'm not having issues with any of your older releases, just some of you recent releases."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-03T05:16Z,everything repeater1 said above is complete horseshit.  this is the typical way these people say these comments.  start out with a complaint but then compliment.  they try to earn your trust that their complaint is legitimate when in fact its a complete lie.  most likely he is a paid stooge.
,repeater1,2011-04-05T06:42Z,"hey seriously, I don't know how you took that as a complaint. It wasn't meant that way. 
I'm really not sure how you took what I said the wrong way but you obviously did. I did say thanks for the up.

basically what I was trying to say was TRON was displaying all stretched when viewed in media center classic.
also Tversity was not able to stream it to my iphone where as your older rips were playing fine.
The PS3 and 360 played it but the 360 stuttered more than half way threw. Where as your other rips never had that problem.


Seriously I wasn't complaining or giving any horseshit, I was  only trying to give my feedback and hoping that if you had recently changed up the way you were encoding.That maybe you'd revert to the setting you used in ""RED"". (just as an example)

Seriously man, don't start thinking that everyone is complaining. I wasn't."
,dh1199,2011-04-23T23:29Z,"People. Don't download this file. This movie is encoded with Quick time codec. If you don'e have quick time palyer installed on you PC or Mac, you won't be able to watch this. You all know how crappy the quick time is. Look for proper MP4 format file.
Thanks."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-28T16:55Z,@dh1199 you are wrong and retarded.  stop posting comments on the internet.
,polarissucks01,2011-05-11T09:35Z,Thank you! you are the only person that has movies that will play in 5.1 on my apple tv. You rock! 
,Blackout046,2011-05-13T05:16Z,"We all know HolyRoses torrents are perfect.

@repeater Get a better computer. That 1986 Apple Lisa isn't designed for HD playback. Neither is my 2005 Powerbook G4. Maybe you burned it wrong anyways.

@dh1199 You damn troll..."
,samdon97,2011-07-24T08:22Z,dude i need to know what is resolution of video plz fast urgent 
,Wave_rider,2011-11-27T10:27Z,"@ NoOrp and themorningstar69 and you other morons talking S***, you obviously don't know s***, and seldom use TPB. Copy the image links and paste into your browser, or do as the Uploader suggests in the description. I mean really, how stupid are you. As my dad always said, think before you speak so you don't look completely stupid. In your cases. Utter FAIL.

...and learn how to use the site before bashing a quality uploaders torrent.

In regards to torrent. A/V is good quality. 10/10. Looks great on WDTV and WDTV live. Deleted 11GB I had previously downloaded!"
,StevenH91,2012-01-27T07:41Z,Awesome quality. Thanks HR
