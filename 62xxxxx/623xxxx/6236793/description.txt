This is Modern Warfare 2 for the PC, I believe it's all set to play after extracting, if not the installation file should be there somewhere. Multiplayer does not work for whatever reason, if you can figure out how to get it to work, just leave the directions in the comments, other than that, the only thing you need to know is that iw4sp.exe starts the game. Any problems, just comment. Please seed, it kills the download for everyone else if you don't. Enjoy
