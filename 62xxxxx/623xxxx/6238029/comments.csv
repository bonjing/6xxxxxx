,MetalManCD,2011-03-22T03:55Z,"Can someone help me? I put the crack in the directory, but it says that the application fails because of a missing component. Any solutions?"
,stharm,2011-03-22T20:50Z,Im having a hardtime finding the activator to install the DLC can anyone tell me the directory path to the activator?
,Movie-Fan,2011-03-25T12:01Z,the activator is in the rar just extract and its there
,stharm,2011-03-26T18:16Z,there is no rar file in the torrent tha i can run
,dutchdrag0n,2011-04-02T22:49Z,"First run the iso provided, install the game.

Then place the crack files (found on the cd deamon tools opened) in the dragon age 2 folder overwriting the file in bin_ship with the same name as the file found in the crack folder.

Then look up the place where your unpacker placed your torrent (utorrent or something), open the Dragon.Age.2.DLC-P2P map there are the rar files for dlc.

Open the rar files with winrar or whatever program you use then install them one by one.

That's it for the people who are new at this, i know how annoying it can be finding this out on your own :P

Btw thx for the upload thumbs up ;)"
,jarsofclay5,2011-04-11T11:52Z,if you have daemon tools lite why is there still i need for a crack
,Awesker91,2011-04-19T06:12Z,"Starting to download... if this one works (which I'm sure it will due to the other comments) i will start seeding :D
thanks movie fan"
,Awesker91,2011-04-20T06:07Z,"Hi!! When i run the autorun a lot of errors appear, the only thing I understand of them is XML...
when i run the setup, it says that the amount of files to instal is 0 or something like that, then it continues normally, but at the end it doesn't install for shit ... could somebody give me a tip ??"
,Awesker91,2011-04-20T06:49Z,"Ok, i managed to fix my errors, but now, when i want to run it i must activate it, and when i put the key i put on the install it rejects it... tips from someone already playing it??"
,Tim_the_Unlucky,2011-04-26T16:03Z,Cant find the keygen...where is it?
,the_newguy_123,2011-06-07T21:08Z,hi im new to this and i've tried to follow your instructions the best i could but daemon tools does not open any crack files from the cd. I've opened the dlc p2p folder and ran the .exe's unrar'd the rar files how do you read the activator it shows nothing but weird symbols and letters i can not make out?????? also i can not find any files to replace nor is there an override folder or profile.bat???? if anybody could help it would be greatly appreciated no dis respect movie-fan thanx 4 the upload! 
,foxfan,2011-08-01T14:31Z,not the best seeding but i hope its work :)
