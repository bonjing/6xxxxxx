Roots Natty - Rasta Resiste (2000)
---------------------------

Max Rivera formed the band back in the summer of 1995 
after relocating in Puerto Rico from Costa Rica where
he escaped years before, looking for a more natural 
way of life and closeness with nature and culture. 
After being called by the Most High to play reggae music
he came forward to his native island of Puerto Rico 
to share the teachings of His Majesty with his brothers
and sisters of his island.
