I have recently uploaded a file called PSP 6.35 PRO B for the psp system 
and i have mentioned that you must have version 6.35 to make the files works
for those that doesn't have version 6.35 this is your update version of 6.35
simply just place this file into your psp game folder and you should see a option of the update pop up inside your psp game > system storage menu once you selected it'll automatically update your psp system to version 6.35 ( Make sure that your PSP system is fully charge before you go through with the procedure otherwise it would not work )

Hope this works 
If not please let me know
