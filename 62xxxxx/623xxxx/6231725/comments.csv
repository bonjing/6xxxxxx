,Dnice808,2011-03-10T06:44Z,Is this CFW?
,SickPandaZero,2011-03-10T06:51Z,yes 
,SickPandaZero,2011-03-10T06:58Z,"this is just a version update for your psp systems 
not the actual custom firmware, since the new 6.35 PRO B needed system version 6.35 which means you have to change your system version and this is what you need to change it  "
