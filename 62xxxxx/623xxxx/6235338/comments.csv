No warnings and it does works all fine. Doesn't se any problems with this release. Thx thx!"
,Wisher_SiD,2011-03-18T01:14Z,Does this finally work online?
,virdicyer,2011-03-25T11:17Z,So... where's the torrent that includes the game with all the patches so we don't have to download and install 16 things?
,sp0tty,2011-03-26T23:14Z,"@virdicyer
I don't see one, why don't you download them all and upload it yourself? or are you unable to do such a simple task without having it all handed to you on a silver platter? How do you think these torrents get here in the first place, spoiled brat."
,Reaper24,2011-04-01T23:11Z,"virdicyer, you don't have to do such a thing. Just download the latest one and apply it. That's all."
,Reaper24,2011-04-01T23:15Z,"Seeing as how this torrent is pretty fishy, I'll download and scan it (avast!) and tell you the results."
,Reaper24,2011-04-01T23:49Z,"Alright, it's clean and it works. Torrent speed is great too.

However, I'll add that the first time I tried to run the game after the update, it crashed. It works now, though, so no probs."
,Valexar,2011-04-04T00:00Z,It works.
,amann95,2011-04-05T11:06Z,"""it works"" but does it work online"
