,torrentdemonoid,2011-03-11T21:31Z,"So, what's the deal??? Is this a fake or the real deal? Can anyone comment as to the veracity of this release?"

,Kikee_31,2011-05-06T01:56Z,"Saggin, if you are aware that this is not the right title, that it is in fact the first movie, then why the f*** havent you changed the freakin' title so everyone else will know too??! Yes, mistakes happen, but now that you know and arent doing anything about it its not a mistake, its an ""on purpose"". 

***Also, you have a SKULL & CROSS BONES naming you a ""TRUSTED"" so the fact that you've left this file titled as is IMO warrants removal of that cute little pink stamp. (not trying to be mean, i just tend to rely on the skulls as a helpful way of selecting ULers im not already familiar with). hope im not sounding like a total asshole. like is said... just my opinion  "
,acquiesce5000,2011-05-09T00:04Z,This is not Hoodwinked Too..my grandaughter was very disappointed.
,mason_tucker,2011-05-10T11:07Z,Its the old one loser !!
,criminet1,2011-05-16T05:02Z,Saggin apologized for the mis-labling in the comments .. READ THE COMMENTS PEOPLE .. keep up the good work Saggin
,ashlewis,2011-05-18T13:33Z,If its 1 y dont u change the title many thx for a good try tho
,drevil360nl,2011-05-19T12:26Z,"Dit is deel 1. Bedankt voor de ""goede"" info. Als je niet weet waar je mee bezig bent, doet het dan gewoon niet. Zonde van de tijd. Prutser!"
[T],Saggin,2011-05-20T23:57Z,"het fijne van deze site is dat ik niets kan veranderen aan de titel of de tekst.
de mensen die niet tevreden zijn adviseer ik om naar de videotheek te gaan, of ze kunnen zelf gaan posten
de beste stuurlui staan aan wal
voor de positieve onder jullie 
het is idd die uit 2005, des alniettemin is het top kwaliteit en gratis"
[T],Saggin,2011-05-21T00:05Z,"is idd deel1 uit 2005
maar kan niets  veranderen op deze pagia 
volgende keer beter"
[T],Saggin,2011-05-21T00:06Z,"i cannot change anything on this post, next time better"
,Kikee_31,2011-05-22T07:02Z,"hi Saggin. i was looking for this movie AGAIN and for the second time selected this file. I noticed my comment from a while back and i feel really bad for being so nasty, especially about something so trivial. I must have been having a bad day or something. 

Anyway, Saggin,  im Sorry for being such an ass. There was no call for such hostillity. i would never have spoken that way to  someone  face to face, someone who would give the spoils of their hard work to a total stranger FOR FREE!! SO, ill say what i should have said the first time: ""Thanks anyways, Saggin. Mistakes happen, right?;) ""
     I dunno if this comment sounds just as excessive as the first but i really felt so bad when i read my previous posting Saggin. Ive gotten so much from you ULers here in TPB.  i just dont want the one thing i give back to sound like anything other than Thank You!!! 
"
,AlpooplA,2011-05-23T07:02Z,"Even though this is Hoodwinked 1, it is a GREAT movie for kids and decent for adults."
,5ynic,2011-05-23T23:26Z,"Read the whole comment thread - I love the way TPB users are starting to form a proper community instead of flaming all the time.
Thanks for the explain Saggin - it's odd that TPB doesn't allow u to edit the title, but I guess I can see why they do that.
Thx for all the ULs mate, and ignore the haters."
,Zatticus,2011-05-29T00:57Z,"So has anyone found a legit copy of hoodwinked too hood vs evil yet? I can't seem to find any torrents that aren't broken, unseeded, or links to paysites."
[T],Saggin,2011-05-29T19:51Z,"hello Kikee_31  

its ok we al have bad days atleast you are a real man to type another comment and preieet what we uloaders are doing for frr
thanks for the comment ;)"
,Cheezez,2011-06-06T20:46Z,"Yes.. This is the first movie. It shows on the COVER!!! 
I noticed it the second the page loaded. 

If you didn't, then lol @ u!

LOL"
,WuWup,2011-06-26T04:39Z,Was looking for 2 but didn't know there was a 1 nice tnx goed gedaan kerel
,BenisonQPS1,2011-06-27T01:36Z,"RE: seeing the Picture.  It may take awhile for it to come up for some people.  I didn't see it until I read the comment RE: it LOL.  Anyway, I was Looking for ""Too"".  Too bad this is not it.  Keep up the good work anyway Saggin.  Maybe TPB powers that be will update the site to avaoid errors like this, and let users change the title, when mistakes made.  Think of all the wasted time for all the users, and posters answering comments....."
,JimTV,2011-07-18T14:53Z,great move but the FIRST ONE. title is incorrect!!!!!
,Redt0rrent,2011-07-18T17:17Z,"is first one, but the sound is too quiet. and its straight from a dvd with many files, i just want one."
