This package contains Dragon Age 2

CorkScrews are prepackaged wine prefixes inspired by the "Wine bottle" of
Crossover (cxgames.). This package was built using ArchLinux and also tested on Ubuntu 10.04, it should work properly on any Linux distribution with wine properly installed.

To install the game run da2_installer.sh. This will extract the archive to ~/.wine/wineprefixes/DragonAge2. 

To launch the game execute the script located in ~/bin, either by double clicking on it, or from a terminal enter: "~/bin/DragonAge2" (case sensative). I reccomend adding $HOME/bin to your PATH, especially if you want to use more then one corkscrew (hint: google it). A desktop launcher is not included with this release, but you can easily make one yourself using the included icon.

To uninstall delete the DragonAge2 folder in ~/.wine/wineprefixes.

I encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other applications and games. This package along with the installer can be freely redistributed and/or modified only by qualified software pirates. If you are happy to see a game or program you like running on linux be sure to let the developers know. 

For other packages just search "CorkScrew" on your favorite torrenting site.
