BBC The Spice Trail 1of3 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Kate Humble goes on the trail of some of the world's most valuable spices revealing their history, trade, mythology and usage.

Part 1. Pepper and Cinnamon.
Kate retraces the steps of 15th-century explorers as she sets out on a spice trail to India and Sri Lanka. Kate begins her travels on India's 'Spice Coast', uncovering the story of pepper, once known as black gold and now the most consumed spice in the world. She does the pepper dance to shake the berries from their stalk, meets farmers fighting back against a disease that is devastating pepper crops, and is taught the centuries old secret language still used by the traders who wheel and deal in the spice. From India, Kate heads south to Sri Lanka, to the land of cinnamon - a place shrouded in mystery to Europeans until the Portugese accidentally landed on its shores. She attends the spectacular Buddhist festival, or Perahara, which celebrates local resistance to the invaders. Kate also takes part in the delicate process of harvesting the spice and making a cinnamon quill, and witnesses the crucial make-or-break negotiations of local farmers trying to sell their crops.
