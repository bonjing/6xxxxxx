DRACULA: SPANISH VERSION (1931)
*******************************************
Considered by many critics to be far better than the English version of Dracula, it is not simply a Spanish-speaking movie but an original film on its own. Presenting a mixed cast from Spain, Mexico, and Argentina, it has truly a Latin flavour to it, quite sensual and suggestive. Rising to a higher tension than the English version, it actually runs almost 30 minutes longer than Lugosi's Dracula, which was filmed simultaneously. 
Director Melford not only adapted but extended the script and action in an original way. The final result is a blend of mystery, sensuality, terror, and comedy. Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield is quite delirious and delivers an unforgettable performance.
This torrent includes a 4-minute introduction with actress Lupita Tovar, who offers delicious insight into the creation and spirit of this great movie.
En otras palabras, hablamos de un DrÃ¡cula con sabor latino...
