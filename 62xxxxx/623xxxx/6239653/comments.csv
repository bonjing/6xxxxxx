If I have all of the completed shows that I have downloaded from the daily packs in one folder and then add the weekly pack will utorrent check the files, notice they are complete and then start seeding them automatically?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-13T18:56Z,"Yes, but before pressing Start, be sure to make Skipped for ones you have not (or do not need) - or these files would be downloaded."

You may wanna fudge your your crazy good quality to size ratio or perhaps cut back on your dedicated service if you really wanna convince us you are trully less than divine lolz!

All hail the torrent god twentyforty!

JK keep up the good work and feel free to make as many mistakes as needed in the future because everything else speaks for itself !D"
