DIVX DVD RIP ENGLISH VER NO SUBS

Two of the greatest movie monsters of all time face off in this classic sci-fi flick directed by IshirÃ´ Honda. On a remote 
tropical island, King Kong is going ape after a drug company attempts to remove him from his habitat. Meanwhile, encased 
in an iceberg, Godzilla is chilling out -- until a submarine accidentally collides with it and sets him free. When the giant 
creatures cross paths in Tokyo, it's World War III.
