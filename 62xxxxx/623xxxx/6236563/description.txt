Bob Dylan - The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9- The Witmark Demos 1962-1964

The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 â€“ The Witmark Demos: 1962â€“1964 is an album of demo recordings Bob Dylan made for his first two publishing companies, Leeds Music and M. Witmark & Sons, from 1962 to 1964. The album, released on October 19, 2010, is the latest addition in the series of official "bootleg" recordings issued by Columbia Records.[1]

The album features 47 tracks with Dylan accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, harmonica and occasionally piano. The recordings were only available as bootlegs until the 1991 release of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1â€“3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961â€“1991, which included three of the demos.[2] A fourth demo, a version of "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right", was included on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack, which came out in 2005. The remaining tracks on The Witmark Demos were being officially released for the first time. While Dylan recorded subsequent versions of most of the songs, the album features 15 that were produced exclusively as demos and had never been heard before except as bootlegs.
