,LaiTEAM,2012-06-17T14:43Z,"I've just installed it in my PS2 HDD with HDLoader. I'm playing it right now. IT WORKS PERFECTLY (IT'S PAL).

As I am using Ubuntu, I had to mount the MDF and generate an ISO from it, all with Acetoneiso. I don't know why mdf2iso doesn't work, it says it's alread an ISO file (WTF).

I'll be seeding at least until I reach a 2.0 ratio.
Thanks for the upload :)"
