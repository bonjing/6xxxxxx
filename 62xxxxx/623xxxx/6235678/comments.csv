I already have:
1-Steve Jobs
2-Mark Zuckerberg
3-Larry Ellison
4-Henry Kravis
5-Sergey Brin & Larry Page
Downloaded these 5 mentioned above right off the bloomberg site.

But I am looking for:
--Richard Branson
--Charlie & David Koch
--Netfilx's Reed Hastings
--Craig Newmark
--Marc Andreessen
Can't seem to download these using Real Media ""Download this video"" button. Every time i try to do it with these, it only downloads the stupid advertisement that comes at the start and not the video it self.
Arrrrggggghhhh...
Can anyone help?"
,thetorfish,2011-08-26T11:00Z,use Internet Download Manager instead of real player while the desired video is playing
,frakattack,2011-10-07T01:30Z,"@Michaelfcp thankyou for uploading this, butt each time I click download this torrent chrome tells me that the link is broken, can you fix it please. I'd really love to watch this

@ aryaveer  if you've got all those episodes you should upload them for us :)"
,Michaelfcp,2011-10-16T12:19Z,click on magnet link please... I think it works... for some reason The Pirate Bay has the edit option temporally unavailable
