I found one on this site that's 38 gigs and says blu-ray, i also found one on demonoid called web-dl which is about 34 gigs and there's this one. Out of the 3 which one has the best picture and sound quality? Which should I download and I don't care about size"

,Aylissan,2011-06-29T20:26Z,"not sure if it's my computer but disk 2, 3 and 4 aren't working properly for me, they keep skipping and the image is all grainy, pretty much impossible to watch. Disk one worked fine and haven't yet finished downloading the other disks but this has got me wondering if it's worth continueing."
,MajiNPic,2011-07-10T15:35Z,"Too bad disc 5, 6 and 7 also aren't working.
Maybe because of bad ripping software."

,MajiNPic,2011-07-21T06:08Z,"@lwilli2009
No, I didn't preview. I got 100% hash checked but they're still not working with any software."
,NewfieRocker,2012-05-04T00:10Z,"Has anyone recently downloaded this and played it successfully?  I suspect that somewhere along the way that some of the files have become corrupt, because I can't get it to play using any software on pc or on dvd after burning it!  It freezes like crazy and I have downloaded 100% of the files all 7 dvds."
