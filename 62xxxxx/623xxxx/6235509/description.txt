The band is from Montreal, Quebec, Canada and performs 60s-style garage rock. They took their name from the French word for a bowler hat, a referral to a clothing stereotype of the 1960s Britain. The bowler was a symbol of the stodgy businessman, which became an representational symbol of the surrealist artist, RenÃ© Magritte. Their best known song is a French language retake of the song My Generation, by The Who. Chapeaumelon contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the American movie Eurotrip.
