As they continue their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion set into the members of the team and one soldier develops a stomach infection. The tensions further increase when the team is encountered by a bright light at night. As the team opens fire, two soldiers confront it and are immedeatly vaporised.
