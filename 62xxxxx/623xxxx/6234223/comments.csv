,RipOrDie999,2011-03-11T04:07Z,"The quality of the show has declined significantly, but thanks for the upload, which is as awesome as ever!"
,Vid_Pillager,2011-03-11T04:19Z,"Thanks for another great upload! Waiting for your site to open up!!!
I need help finding a movie (released in theaters this year--may not be out yet?) my daughter wants to see. 
I'm looking for the name ... The movie is a love story about a boy and girl growing up in a small town. They live next door to each other and go to school together. That's all she could tell me LOL! If someone can help that would be great!"

,exShinobixO,2011-03-11T19:43Z,"@ Vid_Pillager -- that movie is called ""Flipped""

Its a nice movie, me and the wifey watched it on date nite and enjoyed it very much"
,Bronze-Dragonrider,2011-03-11T19:56Z,Vid_Pillager - is is a new movie or old one? The first thing that came to mind was 'My Girl' but that's fairly old... that description could fit a lot of movies!
,bas_tsak,2011-03-11T19:56Z,@vid_pillager the movie your looking for is called UP
,eqzpert,2011-03-11T20:39Z,"OMFG, 32k seeders!"
,redactedwv,2011-03-11T22:30Z,"Everyone getting along... offering suggestions... kind offers to help find/seed a sought after title... not a single unprovoked attack on an innocent bystander... an uploader so known and trusted as to make a/v ratings pointless... 33-friggin-thousand seeders... no fights over imperialism or 911... an unfamiliar (to me), but seemingly legitimate subtitle link... sincere (though brief, i'll grant you) insights regarding the quality of the production itself... multiple friendly expressions of gratitude to the uploader....& no spam. By the gods, no spam.

Someday, fathers will sit around the campfire telling their children about this comment section.

 'C'mon dad... Not one argument about nationalism? Not a single person spoke dismissively about the quality of a stranger's genitals?' 

 'No, son....It was wonderful. People worked together toward a common goal, and they did so respectfully and in friendship'. 

 'Yeah, okay dad....and you had to walk 6 miles through the snow to get to school, we've heard it all before....'

Anyway.... Thanks EZ. Always sincerely appreciated. Hope all will be well with the main site soon. :)"
,streetraceros,2011-03-11T23:00Z,"I must agree with RipOrDie999, this episode has unusually low quality in comparison to others, but tnx anyway"
,Blackadder75,2011-03-13T22:54Z,@redactedwv  :  lol  best comment evah
