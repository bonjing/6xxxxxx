,krilindrs,2011-05-10T10:10Z,"nice album from richard durand.
as stated in the description the tracks were mixed but have been ""separated"", but there is something about the ""separation"" that don't feel right(it's like if a second or less than a second is missing from the transition from 1 track to another).
overall, good quality(8/10), thanks 4 the upload"
