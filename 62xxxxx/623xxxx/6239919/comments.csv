Pages 25 and 52 are still out... Unless the Torrent can still be seeded to 100%

It Might be better to upload just the jpg panels; sometimes the cbr files do not just want to form correctly.. if I unrar the CBR then I can see all jpgs except 25 and 52.."
,Robert012488,2011-03-15T06:16Z,"Right now; it is 99.9%, 64KB missing.. The CBR archive shows one bad page, however if you extract the jpgs from the CBR - there are no pages missing (all are complete). so it might be that the 64KB is something that attached itself to the CBR...Now if I reassemble the JPGs into a a New CBR. I find that the Archive is not broken.."
