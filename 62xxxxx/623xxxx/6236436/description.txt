 Masti express is a story of a true hero rising 
 against he odds. Rajpal Yadav at his career    
 best portrays a role of a common man compelled 
 to be a part of death defying and gruesome     
 situations that have the merits to give him the
 best objective in his ordinary life - 'educatio
 to his son' who otherwise is just another brat 
 in a slum with an uninspiring future.          
 Yes this is the story of a father desperately  
 trying to get his child 'an admission' in a    
 renowned school and provide him education. The 
 story will definitely connect with Indian      
 audience as in some time or the other in their 
 life time; they  have gone through a similar   
 feeling.
