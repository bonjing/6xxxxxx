                             By The Name Of Allah

In conveying the message of Islam to a non-Muslim, it is usually not sufficient to highlight only the positive nature of Islam. Most non-Muslims are not convinced about the truth of Islam because there are a few questions about Islam at the back of their minds that remain unanswered. This book will help non-Muslims to discover and know more common questions about Islam in more depth.
