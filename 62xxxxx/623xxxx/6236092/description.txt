Ron's new album sees him link up with bob rock as producer , a guy best known for his work with metallica !! It just seems sexsmith will keep ploughing his own furrow regardless of recognition. 

That said after the latin influences and piano balladry of "exit strategy" this is a change of slant again . Combined with super smooth production sexsmith has made an outright pop album crammed full of jangly guitars ,subtle touches of harmonica,strings,horns, accordian and some really good songwriting . 

To his credit rock doesnt get in the way of sexsmiths songs and instead just tries to make him sound as radio friendly and approachable as possible . Which means you get that tension between the bold and sunny sounds of "believe it when i see it" and "no help at all" and the actual lyrical content which is melancholy in extremis. 

Along with the touching little vignette of "michael and his dad" and the pure pop of "love shines"  these are the best tracks by a fair distance and its true what the other reviewer says about the 2nd half falling away a bit . 

But at the end of the day will this pristinely produced record find him a new audience ? Personally i doubt it , sexsmiths 70s influences keep him a little distinct from the coffee house soundtracks which is probably the place he needs to be right now. And although its a nice sounding record weve been here before with "retriever" and its not such a bold step as say "blue boy" or "cobblestone runway" were . 

I hope im wrong though .
