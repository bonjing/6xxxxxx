                Big Trouble in Little Cranford.
                Sitcom about slack admin workers at a law firm. It's
                Fox Cranford's 30-year anniversary, but the
                celebration is a damp squib involving Gloria's
                homemade cake. Kenny is panic stricken when he
                mistakenly thinks that Tania is pregnant, Mike is on
                the verge of meltdown, the firm is going under and
                the icy silent partner Miss Fox is on the prowl.
                Tania and Shelley decide to hold a proper party to
                cheer Mike up. Kenny is in charge of the food and
                drink and with Darrel and Asif's help it quickly goes
                pear-shaped.
