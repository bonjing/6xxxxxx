,laned130,2011-10-29T05:15Z,Would have downloaded except for the HHI branding on all the files - I really don't want to have to spend time renaming all the files!
,ThaPyratBay,2012-03-19T23:21Z,"Yeah, what the dude said... you need-ta make sure that you're making these songs organised precisely, created fairly, and everything works audio track-wise. Overall, it seems okay."
,AlHubbard,2012-03-28T00:43Z,That's really annoying.  Who does this guy think he is?
[T],raidy,2012-03-28T04:14Z,"Thanks for the comments... Our stuff is named and internally tagged as per scene rip specs. Sorry it doesn't meet your itunes or windows media player style of naming.

I'm sure you can find something else more to your liking. No real need to make useless comments or poorly rate the torrent because you're upset that we've tagged it. We did the rip, we feel we deserve the credit for it."
[T],raidy,2012-03-28T04:16Z,"As for organized, etc.. We rip using EAC secure mode rip. Encode it using lame v3.90.3 using alt preset standard. We tag/name using Morgoth mp3 releaser with our templates. Everything offered *IS* as the Retail cd contained. Except scanned images. We take pride in our work and sound quality."
