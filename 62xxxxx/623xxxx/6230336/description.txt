Simply put, I took the audio off the DVD and made this stereo mixdown for CD. I crossfaded all the songs together to make it sound more like a real concert. There's nothing I like less than live albums with fades between the songs. The studio material is in an additional folder and includes the alternate mix of Children of the Light from the box set.

More to come. Enjoy!
