- Mother of 9/11 Victim Condemns King Hearing on Muslim "Radicalization"

New York Republican Congressman Peter King-chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security-held a controversial yesterday on what he calls the "radicalization" of the American Muslim community. Critics call the hearings a modern-day form of McCarthyism. We speak to Talat Hamdani, the mother of Mohammed Salman Hamdani, who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Minnesota Democrat Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, broke down in tears at the hearing when telling the story of her son. We also speak with Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.
