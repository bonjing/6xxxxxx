How Machines Work is a wicked trip inside, under, over and through the guts of ordinary - and extraordinary machines from our daily lives. Photo-real computer animation takes us where no camera crew can fit, or even survive. Entertaining commentary untangles complex design and engineering for all ages, while having fun along the way. Fly, flood, speed, spin, crush, cut, push, pull, tick, and tock. From a handheld tattoo machine to a coal-crushing power plant, an escalator, a machine gun, and a bomb robot. Fifty-two machines in 13 action-packed episodes make all of us experts on How Machines Work. 

Missing one episode! Somehow my PVR missed that one, but will cap it as soon as it is shown again and upload it separately. 

Enjoy!
