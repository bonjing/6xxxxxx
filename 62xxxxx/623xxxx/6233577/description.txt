Sharp-tongued comic Lewis Black leads viewers through a series of segments that point out the ridiculousness of the frenzied consumerism and sometimes mindless traditions that surround us in the weeks between Thanksgiving and January 1. In addition to reports from a turkey farm, Black offers up observations from fellow comics like Bob Saget, David Alan Grier, an Craig Ferguson.
