The Village left behind... For each one, a different alibi...Moving to the city was easy; taking your heart with, impossible... Those childhood recollections, those cultural roots entice your thoughts time and time again... And when you look back, the nostalgic journey begins...The village, the bonds, the memoirs and a rustic love story... Vasanta and shaku, Kalli and Viru, A story of rising personalities and their amends with time...An album of picturesque memories reminiscing lost personas... "Sumbaran"
