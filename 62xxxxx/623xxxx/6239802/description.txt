might (the band)
Hush Hush (the song)

Single off their Studio LP "Pine"

---

This is their Big-Solid-Tone track - 
The drums go from ear cutting chorus,
to huge solid-steady zeppelin style verses

sick vocals,
killer guitar tone,
and a bass that sounds like a heavy engine machine farm


in the background you can hear some vintage analog synthesizers making some haunted noises (I can't tell what they are, however)

If you like this real rock - SEED! - Share!

Real bands need music to sell shows!
NOT shows to sell music!

Good music needs to be circulated - 
people deserve better than the chop, screwed, and glued computer-tron shit-sandwich rock that's been all over the radio.

digital filters, auto-tune, over use of compression,
pads, digi-synth, click tracks - 


that's not music.

our ears know better -
