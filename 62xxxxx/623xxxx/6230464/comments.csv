,yohohoandaBottleofRUM,2011-03-11T09:18Z,Wow!! i wasnt expecting to read a comment like that on ChattChitto's torrents??? maybe MrAntivirus is the creator of Nero burning rom & is pissed off with this??? lol  :-)
,Greekguy6,2011-03-11T16:43Z,"He doesnt work for nero. he is just an idiot.

Shut up mr antivirus. I have downloaded most of his stuff & never once did any of my laptops or desktops find out a virus. I have mcaffe & norton & kasp. So get a grip & stop being a idiot."

[V],ChattChitto,2011-03-21T13:09Z,"@brocktron1 Yup! If anyone follows the Instructions precisely it will never fail! I am still using it and no issue at all. The key for this is to block NERO from accessing the Internet even before you enter in it the serial. So just before it asks you to enter the serial block it from accessing the Internet. This way your serial will never get ""Blackkisted""."

,Hevithan,2011-03-30T22:16Z,"If you're like me and just skim the description, move on to comments to see if it's good ... you will miss something important lol ... 
||-WINDOWS SP3 IS THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR INSTALL!!!-||
I skipped that part, and now i can't install. And I don't want SP3 ... Other then that the DL speed was pretty quick and didn't pick up any virus alerts... If this was SP2 compatible I'd be on it like white on rice in a glass of milk on a paper plate."
,OEM,2011-04-08T07:05Z,"As expected this doesn't work. Drop an AVI into NeroVison and you'll get a ""Patent Activation"" error after the Trial serial has expired. Same as every other Nero 10.5 release.

A special activation serial is needed in addition to the regular serial, and there hasn't been a working one since v.10.0.13100. And those keys are blacklisted in the newer versions. The KeyGen that is floating around is useless."

"" note:its recommended to block nero burning rom from calling home using your firewall as the key serial might be block.""
 can you instruct me how to do this ... thanx.."
[V],ChattChitto,2011-04-20T00:30Z,"@OEM
I have been using it for over a month now on a daily basis and never had this problem!!
Working flawlessly!
and that might be happening with you because your not blocking it from accessing the internet

@julz0428
You can do that using your FireWall."
[T],antz172,2011-05-04T09:10Z,"Works a treat, thanks"
,daltron101,2011-05-08T00:10Z,"Fast DL. Easy Install. but shouldn't there be a way to burn ""MP3 CD's""? I can't seem to figure it out."
,daltron101,2011-05-08T01:07Z,"Nevermind, Ignore that comment... I was just being a dumb dick. : ) Thanks for the upload. this is the first NERO 10 Ive gotten to work on windows 7. peace."

,ctofct,2011-05-17T21:55Z,"Has anyone tried this version 10.5.10300 with Windows XP 64 Bit?  I think Nero 9 is the newest version that will would with it but not sure. If anyone has tried to install please leave comment,  thank you."
,Flintstone_Redneck,2011-05-20T06:25Z,"Installed correctly and I blocked program from calling home via Trend Micro Firewall.  I pasted the serial number and then restarted program.  Still shows Nero Burning Rom TRIAL.......

What did I do wrong, if anything"
