,QborT,2011-03-10T20:30Z,"aspect ratio is off (for some parts)... MYSTiC fails again. lulz

They cropped the movie to remove the letter box black bars.  But the movies aspect ratio changes between 2.35:1 and 1.78:1 (something to do with the IMAX filming) so it is supposed to be like that.  

MYSTiC fucked it up, this is another garbage rip."
,User897,2011-03-11T09:22Z,"Well, these are all ""garbage rips"" to be honest.  The DTS to AC3 conversions are all shit, and WAY too loud and distorted."
,Thor-csf,2011-07-14T22:28Z,"This rip is totally bad quality! Don't download it!
The image quality is awful and the upper and under parts are cropped, making the aspect ratio distorted.

I recommend ViSiON rip. Nice quality and correct aspect ratio."
