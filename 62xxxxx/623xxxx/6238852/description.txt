PLEASE SEED THE CONTENT YOU DOWNLOAD
I am posting my files for a period of 30 days, I figure that if everyone who downloads my files do the same, these files could be on Pirate Bay for a good while. PLEASWE SHARE THE TORRENTS
Also, looking for active collectors of rare hard to find 50â€™s to today rock music.
Contact me at write_2us@yahoo.com with the subject title PB. And lets get our collections growing. 
I am up to 400+ concert DVDs of good quality. 
Thanks
