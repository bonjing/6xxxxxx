This video was shot by the venue's owner - 
He's an odd fellow who, during live performances, jumps in front of the band taking camera shots --- He uses the clips for promotions.

I ripped this video from his vlog,blog,tweet,twat site, cleaned up what I could, and posted it in various departments of the internet.

I do not know why the song is titled "Rocky II" - as far as I know, because it's new, it may be a temporary name.

The band, might, is starting to gain attention - so I'm trying to post anything I can now, so it may be documented properly - and easily accessible to all fans.
