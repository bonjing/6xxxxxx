,iPod87,2011-03-09T15:12Z,"Thanks so much for the upload HR and with English soft subtitles too. Though I've only been able to get subtitles to work on iTunes.

For some reason subtitles don't show up on iPod Classic despite changing the video setting to subtitle on. I wonder why that is? Anyone encountered a solution."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T15:27Z,i know the subs work with iphone and ipod touch and the ipad and ipod nano.  the really old ipod videos didn't support it as far as i know.  i dont have a modern classic to test it.
,Hdavila,2011-03-09T16:43Z,"HR,

Do you know of a good website or app that has subs, specifically in Latin Spanish or Spanish. I've used iSubtitles and Subler but they just can't find Spanish. 

And as always, Thank you for your uploads!"
,iPod87,2011-03-09T17:17Z,"Thanks for your response with regards to the subtitle issue in iPod Classic.

Apparently according to various forums iPod Classic doesn't support soft subtitles but does support hard subtitles, so I'll try to see if I can view subtitles on my iPod Classic if I choose the burned in option on Handbrake."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T17:22Z,"you can use google language tools to translate.

http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en

open the included SRT file with notepad or wordpad.  Select all (control A), copy (control C).  Now paste in the text box (control v).  Choose language to translate from/to.

Command key on a mac and probably textedit instead of notepad.

Save the translated text to a new .srt file using textedit/notepad.

Here are 2 subtitle web sites

http://www.opensubtitles.org/

http://subscene.com/

Test if subtitle is compatible using VLC and skipping around various parts and making sure subtitle displays at correct location.  You can use my ""source"" as a search argument on these sites but other dvd or bluray source may work fine as well.

add subtitle to m4v using subler, be sure to change the language drop down.  save file.

"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T17:34Z,doing this method will make a decent srt file.  I have tried it with translating spanish to english and it worked pretty decent.  somethings will be goofy if the sentences break into 2 lines or 2 different timestamps.
,whitee_rabbit,2011-03-09T19:55Z,"HR, are you gonna upload the 720p of this movie?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T20:27Z,of course
