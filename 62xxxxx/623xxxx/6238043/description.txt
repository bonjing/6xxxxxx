Video for Lit's "My Own Worst Enemy," off their 2001 album

Atomic.



Notes: There's one scene around the 2150 frame mark that's 30fps

but rest of vid is 23.976. A couple of scenes with bowling

balls going down the lane had to be fully deinterlaced, which

resulted in ghosted frames. Couldn't be helped.
