Brisbane, Australia

110min

Filmed from the stands with my sony hrd-xr150e



I used ConvertXtoDVD4 to burn my .MTS files direct to dvd and when i play it on a dvd player the date and time stamp are on screen but not when played through WMP. S if anyone knows how to correct this please PM me.

People have not been SEEDING when complete, if this continues i will not upload any more of my masters

I will be seeding my 4 latest torrents 24/7 (best times are 8am - 8pm AEST) as i am not downloading anything

I HAVE A SHITTY CONNECTION (UP SPEED 24Kbps)
SO BE PATIENT

If you want to author the DVD more (menu's etc) go for it
Just give credit where credit is due ( Taper SS666 )
