*Release Notes...: I know the third episode is missing. The source from last week's episode had some pretty bad errors. In
		   the beginning of the season, Discovery Channel was reairing the previous week's episode before the new
		   one, but it looks like they stopped. They are only airing new episodes once as far as I can tell. If
		   anything changes and I see the third episode reair, I'll definitely try to grab it.
