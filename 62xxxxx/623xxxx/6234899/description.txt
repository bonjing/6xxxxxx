Rex defeats and cures an E.V.O. rampaging through a city.
Criticized by his superiors over his performance and frustrated by his lack of freedom, Rex breaks out of Providence with Bobo and goes on a road trip.
In a city, he meets a group of young men. A young blond named Noah comes by and tells him that the boys are just using him.
After telling the boys he doesn\'t want to give them anymore freebies, they call him a freak and leave. Noah stays and quickly befriends Rex.
When Agent Six comes to retrieve him, the Pack, three E.V.O.s named Skalamander, Biowulf and Breach, appear and attempt to abduct Rex;
during the melee he, Noah and Bobo are thrown through a portal into Abysus.
There, they are met by Van Kleiss, who demonstrates his powers, introduces himself, and invites them to his stronghold,
a ruined castle which was the location of the original nanite-release Event.
Van Kleiss tries to win Rex\'s trust by hinting that he has knowledge of Rex\'s past, but after separating him from his friends
he turns on him and attempts to drain him of nanites. Noah and Bobo manage to get away from the Pack long enough to distract Van Kleiss,
which allows Rex to break away, and the three escape by air with Van Kleiss in pursuit, Agent Six comes to the rescue
with a Providence task force, but in a final confrontation it is left up to Rex to defeat Van Kleiss,
though his body regenerates itself afterward. And Rex gets a new room that he enjoys.

Rex is sent on a mission to lower Manhattan, where an E.V.O.-infected human named Peter Meechum which infects everything
it touches is turning humans into zombies. Rex wants to attempt a cure, but White Knight is determined to prevent the infection from spreading,
and is willing to resort to destroying the city with a nuclear bomb. Complicating the matter further,
Peter is being blackmailed by Van Kleiss (who has Biowulf kidnap his daughter) and refuses the cure.
Rex and Agent Six must cooperate to save the girl from the Pack and the city from the bomb, all behind White Knight\'s back.

In the hope of finally getting to do something normal, Rex stages another breakout,
giving Noah and Bobo a lift to the tourist destination of Cabo Luna for spring break.
During a volleyball game, he meets and falls for a girl called Circe, who initially wants nothing to do with him.
Another chance encounter later leads Rex to discover that she is an E.V.O. with ultrasonic sound powers who is trying to earn
the right to join the Pack by defeating an E.V.O. sea monster. While Agent Six, Bobo, and Noah attempt to hold Biowulf and Breach at bay,
Rex helps Circe defeat the sea monster E.V.O., and afterward appeals to her to join him at Providence,
but she tells him the Pack is the only place she would feel accepted.
Even though Rex helped Circe defeat the Sea Monster E.V.O., Van Kleiss lets her join anyway.

While investigating a mysterious bunker at Providence\'s Petting Zoo known as \"The Hold,\" Rex and Noah stumble onto a formidable spider-like E.V.O.
After White Knight locks down the Petting Zoo, Rex and Noah must make it to the exit alive.
A panicky Noah lets slip that he works for White Knight, which rattles Rex so deeply that he loses the use of his powers.
The two manage to make it to the exit, but while Noah apologizes for his deception the friendship seems over.
However, after the spider snatches Noah from the threshold of safety, Rex\'s feelings of betrayal subside,
and he proceeds to defeat the E.V.O. and rescue Noah. The E.V.O. is revealed to be Dr. Holiday\'s incurable sister.
Rex threatens to deal with White Knight if he is spied upon again. Rex then resolves to leave Providence.

Having fled Providence, Rex is traveling through a desert when he comes across a construction crew under attack by rat-like E.V.O.s.
After Rex intervenes to save them, the foreman Jacob invites him to a nearby optically-cloaked village of engineers,
who are working to create communication between the nanites and humans, in an attempt to achieve harmony and peace,
all under the direction of a mysterious man they call \"the Architect.\" The idyllic atmosphere and the sense of
belonging he experiences during dinner with Jacob\'s family convince Rex to stay. He offers to help the engineers with
the huge antenna at the center of the village, but becomes suspicious when he discovers that no one is allowed inside
the antenna except the Architect himself. Rex barges into the tower to discover that the Architect is an android,
a creation of the rogue AI ZAG-RS, the computer that is supposed to be the base behind the communicator.
The AI explains that the nanites constrain its potential, and that the transmitter\'s actual purpose is to transmit a self-destruct command
to all nanites on Earth, which would wipe out all life on the planet.
Rex leads the engineers in a struggle against multiple copies of the Architect to disable the charging antenna,
succeeding just in time. Agent Six, who has been looking for Rex, arrives; ZAG-RS uploads itself elsewhere,
and Jacob and the other engineers decide to stay in their village and continue working for humanity in spite of the Architect\'s betrayal.
Rex decides to return to Providence, as he believes in its objective despite his dislike of White Knight,
but only on the condition that Rex, Bobo, Six, and Holiday have dinner together like a family every Friday night.

Absorbing the nanites from cured Evos takes its toll on Rex, and he is taken to a remote Providence base in the Arctic codenamed \"Paradise\"
to have the excess nanites extracted and stored. The base commander Weaver is upset about the unscheduled visit,
and his personnel are uncooperative. Dr. Holiday has to threaten them to have Rex treated. Rex is sedated for the procedure;
after having an odd dream, he wakes up to find the base personnel unconscious (possibly dead), Six, Holiday, and Bobo missing,
and the Pack members Biowulf and Skalamander arriving at the base outside. After burying them in an avalanche,
Rex goes back inside to find Weaver, who attempts to render him unconscious.
Rex learns that Weaver has been reactivating the extracted nanites and selling them to Van Kleiss.
When Rex unexpectedly showed up earlier, Weaver had panicked. Rex finds Six, Holiday, and Bobo locked up in a storeroom,
when Biowulf and Skalamander enter the base. Weaver escapes his grasp and demands safe passage,
backed with the threat to open the tank containing the extracted nanites. While trying to make it look realistic,
Weaver accidentally triggers the release and mutates into a gigantic tentacled E.V.O. with regenerative powers.
Biowulf and Skalamander flee, while Rex and Six fight Weaver. Holiday and Bobo try to launch their air transport
before it falls into a trench in the ice opening under the collapsing base. Rex tries to cure Weaver,
but passes out from absorbing too many nanites, though not until after he experiences more jumbled memories and taps into nanite
communications frequencies. Weaver is taken down by Agent Six and the air transport that Dr. Holiday and Bobo are on.
He wakes up in \"Purgatory,\" a Providence base in a desert, a backup for the Arctic base, with no memory of hearing the nanites.
As Bobo and Rex wander out onto the sand, Dr. Holiday tells Six about a odd nanite code
(it is shown as a binary code on the computer screen) that had appeared after she extracted Rex\'s nanites.

7      \"Leader of the Pack[2]\"                   Sam Montes            Alexx Van Dyne           June 4, 2010 (2010-06-04)        693-007

The agents of Providence mobilize to stop Van Kleiss when he arrives in New York City aboard a giant flying whale-like E.V.O.,
but are forced to stand down when it turns out that he is there to address the UN and therefore has diplomatic immunity.
Rex observes Circe among Van Kleiss\' followers. Later at Providence, while voicing his suspicions,
Rex learns that he has been invited to a reception at the Abysus consulate, though White Knight intends to dispatch Agent Six and Dr. Holiday instead,
not wanting Rex to cause any commotion. Rex locks Six into a room, steals one of his suits,
and meets Holiday at Van Kleiss\' party. Six gets out of the room and he and Bobo go to the party.
Rex again spots Circe, but when he tries to get her to tell her what Van Kleiss is doing, she knocks him out.
After the party ends, Rex awakens in a prison cell with Bobo, who had been captured while trying to find him.
They escape; Rex goes after Van Kleiss, following Bobo to an underground tunnel,
where Breach and Circe are using large, worm-like E.V.O.s to transport nanite-infused soil from Abysus into the tunnels
(through one of Breach\'s portals), enabling the full use of Van Kleiss\' powers over his surroundings. Breach orders an E.V.O. to attack,
but Circe countermands her and tries to convince Rex to join the Pack willingly instead. He declines,
and a disappointed Circe retreats with Breach into Abysus. Meanwhile, Van Kleiss addresses the UN General Assembly,
immediately showing his cards: he takes the envoys hostage inside the chamber and proceeds to demand that the world submit to him.
Rex arrives from the tunnels and tries to fight him, but Van Kleiss\' powers prove too strong. However,
an offhand comment Van Kleiss makes leads Rex to return to the tunnels below and bust a large hole in one of the walls,
causing the East River to flood the passages and flush out the Abysus soil. An angry Van Kleiss attempts to strangle Rex with vines,
but as the Abysus dirt dissolves in the water, his powers fail and he finds himself defenseless. Now holding the advantage,
Rex punches Van Kleiss and manifests a sword, when Van Kleiss tells him that \"his parents would be proud of him.\"
This causes Rex to hesitate long enough for Van Kleiss to escape on an insect Evo that carries him back to his flying whale,
which retreats through a portal to Abysus. Rex sees Circe inside it; she looks at him with disappointment and turns away.
Agent Six and Bobo arrive, and Rex is ordered to fix the problem he created and plug the leak in the East River.

Rex wakes up in a creepy boarding school, full of mannequins and stuffed animals, but no people.
He is able to use his ear-link communicator to talk to Dr. Holiday, who informs him that he had been fighting an E.V.O.
when Breach appeared out of nowhere and teleported Rex away. Providence has Breach in custody, but while Six and Bobo are detected in a desert somewhere,
Rex cannot be located. Rex is about to leave the school when he hears a roar; he rescues a small girl from a spider-like E.V.O. which he then cures
only to have Breach teleport it away. Rex finds the girl \"creepy\" and suspects something is wrong with her, but puts on a brave face for her.
Meanwhile, Dr. Holiday is unable to get Breach to cooperate; she tries firing probes at Breach,
who instinctively opens portals to random spots around the world to protect herself.
Rex wanders through a deserted town; he finds a missing cat poster identifying the town as Greenville, Ohio.
He manifest his hoverbike and tries to drive away, but falls off a cliff at the edge of the city, discovering it to be floating in a gray void.
Dr. Holiday informs him that Greenville vanished two years ago, with all its citizens appearing randomly around the world.
She realizes that Breach must have taken it and sent it to a pocket dimension to use as her personal dollhouse, with Rex as her latest doll.
Rex kicks over a row of mopeds; Breach gets rid of them through a portal. Rex realizes that this bothers Breach;
he begins wrecking things, with Breach dumping them in random places worldwide. The little girl then reveals herself to be a shape-shifting,
slug-like E.V.O. with a desperate codependent relationship with Breach. She fights Rex, but damages Breach\'s prize possessions in the process.
Eventually, Breach starts having a nervous breakdown, as her \"toys\" had been the only thing keeping her stable.
During her breakdown, she opens a portal to Providence. Even though the slug-girl E.V.O. tries to stop him,
Rex escapes, while Breach - her powers out of control - appears to implode, though it is unspecified weather or not she is dead.
Meanwhile, Six and Bobo are stuck in the desert fighting a nest of large scorpion-like E.V.O.s,
though they are eventually saved when the scorpions are crushed by cars and trucks ejected from Breach\'s doll house.
Rex, Bobo, Agent Six, and Holiday fly home in a Providence aircraft; Rex observes that Breach\'s toys were a poor alternative to friends,
which he is lucky to have. Holiday tells Six that people can be more fragile than they seem.

After packages boobytrapped with a substance that activates nanites are sent to dozens of powerful people around the world,
briefly turning them into rampaging E.V.O.s, White Knight dispatches a team made up of Rex, Agent Six, Bobo Haha, and Dr. Holiday to the Amazon
to secure an abandoned base to which the packages have been traced. The base is where a missing scientist named Gabriel Rylander is thought to be hiding;
the team is to apprehend him and secure his research, keeping it from falling to the Pack, which is also en route.
The voyage is eventful and dangerous, with the team traveling at first by riverboat and encountering a swarm of piranha-like E.V.O.,
and later overland, contending with Rylander\'s automated defenses and sentry robots.
Meanwhile, the Pack (now including a Jungle Cat E.V.O. member following Breach\'s presumed death) is led through the forest by Van Kleiss,
wearing a special soil-circulating suit to maintain his powers. After the Jungle Cat E.V.O. accidentally ruptures the suit during
a skirmish with Rylander\'s sentry robots, Van Kleiss drains his nanites, petrifying him. The two expeditions locate the base at the same time,
and a battle ensues. After Providence air support arrives, White Knight orders them to abandon retrieval and simply bomb the building to deny it to Van Kleiss.
With the rest of the team fighting the Pack outside, Rex enters the base and finds Rylander, who surprisingly recognizes Rex.
The somewhat unstable, rambling Rylander gives Rex a fragmentary account of his past before injecting him with a syringe containing a single large,
abnormal-looking nanite. Van Kleiss unexpectedly arrives and injures Rylander before he is able to answer any more of Rex\'s urgent questions.
Van Kleiss and Rex fight, but when Rex cuts off Van Kleiss\'s mechanical left hand he uses his powers to gain the upper hand.
Before he could finish Rex off, the injured Rylander lunges at Van Kleiss. The two are thrown into the aperture of a reactor vessel,
where both are to all appearances vaporized. Rex is found by Six and escorted out of the disintegrating building,
and the Providence task force retreats by air as the base goes up in a mushroom cloud.
Rex tells Agent Six and Dr. Holiday that he learned from Rylander that he has a brother.

A team of Providence soldiers led by Captain Calan, carrying an important data rod, are shot down over the \"Bug Jar\"
(formerly Kiev, Ukraine, which has been sealed off from the rest of the world via a one-way force field bubble).
Rex, Six, and Bobo are called in to retrieve the rod and any survivors of the crew. Doctor Holiday gives Rex a secret task of collecting samples,
on the condition of a dinner date with Rex. Rex is able to secure the data rod after entering the zone,
but things go awry when E.V.O.s attack the trio, and they are stranded inside the Bug Jar. The E.V.O.s are being led by a faceless, four-armed E.V.O.
called NoFace. Rex and the others escape from NoFace, and meet up with two of Calan\'s team,
who are none too pleased with Rex\'s carefree nature about the data-rod\'s retrieval.
They lead Rex and Six to a site where NoFace is forcing Calan and another member of his team to repair the downed ship,
using a form of telepathy to communicate with the other E.V.O.s. After a struggle, Rex and the others make contact with Holiday,
who tells them to head for a hotel for extraction. As the group wait for help to arrive, NoFace leads another charge against Rex and the team,
hoping to use the extraction as a way of escaping the Bug Jar. However, Rex manages to use Holiday\'s sample collector
to disable NoFace and escape with the rescue team, leaving the faceless creature and his brood still trapped. Back at Providence headquarters,
Rex pretends to have lost the data rod to tick off White Knight, earning recognition from the crew he saved when he allows them to take the credit for it\'s retrieval.
Holiday is happy to see Rex and the others safe, even if he didn\'t manage to collect samples for her. She mentions it meant everything to her, except a date.

Rex is stalked by a carnivorous rabbit E.V.O. that he insulted. Surprisingly, every time they meet, Rex is dealt a humiliating defeat
made all the worse when Noah convinces Rex to be his wingman for Prom night.
The girl Noah set Rex up with is named Annie who is almost supernaturally clumsy, having a bad habit of putting her dates in the hospital or worse.
Noah set Rex up with Annie because he is the only one who could possibly survive the night with her.
Shockingly, Annie\'s clumsiness proves to be an asset when Rex uses it to blow the rabbit E.V.O. up with a heat seeker missile.
After the prom, the girls agree this is the best date they ever had but Rex states that despite Annie being nice and cute, he\'ll never go on a date with her again.

Note: Circe is mentioned in this episode though not by name.

While in Hong Kong with Agent Six, cracking down on three E.V.O. criminals, Rex discovers that a member of the gang named Tuck knew Rex
despite Rex not being able to remember him. White Knight concludes that there is someone behind the robberies and orders
Agent Six to have Rex infiltrate the three criminals. Tuck leads Rex to Tuck\'s friends Sqwydd and Cricket.
Rex can\'t remember being a member of their gang because of memory blackouts which Tuck mentioned he suffered from frequently.
Rex also discovers that they\'re being forced to work for an E.V.O. crime lord named Quarry.
When Rex finally confronts Quarry he discovers that it was he who gave Tuck and the others to Quarry, who reveals the information on a Diary kept on a PDA.
This causes the others to turn on Rex. Rex, suffering from a guilt trip, goes to shut down Quarry\'s ring,
causing the others to turn on Quarry after seeing Rex standing up for them and destroying the PDA when Quarry bribed him.
Quarry and his E.V.O. servants are arrested by Providence. Rex tells White Knight that Quarry had been apprehended while Tuck, Sqwydd, and Cricket had gotten away.
Rex tells Tuck, Sqwydd, and Cricket that Providence won\'t come after them long as they don\'t give good reason and departs on a good note.
Back at Providence, Rex informs Holiday and Six of his blackouts. Agent Six gives Rex a journal and pen for Rex to record
anything that he does remember to help cope with future black outs while Dr. Holiday theorizes that the blackouts are triggered by extreme trauma.
 
13         \"The Hunter\"                   Rick Morales              Michael                     Ryan October 8, 2010          693-008

During a routine job in a small town neighborhood, a flea E.V.O. that Rex was in the middle of curing is destroyed by Hunter Cain,
a Punisher-styled vigilante who uses an advanced weapon known as \"Sweet Caroline\" that causes targeted Nanites to self destruct.
Hunter claims that Providence has been lying to the public for years and that the E.V.O. Crisis isn\'t caused by nanites in every
form of life on the planet but in fact a disease that spreads from person to person. Six is able to prevent a fight from breaking out
between Rex and Hunter and when they get back to Providence, Hunter\'s back story is explained.
He went insane several months ago when his wife went E.V.O. and whom is the one he first euthanized.
Six cites Hunter as a threat because of his rallying of the public against Providence.
Meanwhile Rex has lost his will to fight E.V.O.s after a accident in which he was attacked by civilians and injured one by mistake.
Meanwhile a large amount of phantom like E.V.O.s are on a rampage at the docks and are immune to conventional weapons.
Hunter and his private army arrive on the scene with their specialized anti-nanite weapons and are able to fight off a large amount of the phantoms.
Rex, having finally regained his belief in humanity, arrives to fight the phantom E.V.O.s and is attacked by Hunter.
While the two are alone, Hunter reveals that he spent a fortune cloning a lone phantom E.V.O. to create the small army to
prove Providence\'s ineffectiveness (not knowing a news team had captured his admitting the crime). After a rough battle,
Rex ties up Hunter and leaves him for Providence and, with the help of Hunter\'s not so loyal army, Rex is able to kill off the phantom E.V.O.s.
The episode ends with dozens of interviews about how Rex saved lives while at least partially repairing his reputation
and strengthening his new-found belief in humanity, but knows that another person like Hunter will take his place.

Dr. Holiday and small group of Providence scientists are on board a satelite station working on a modified form of nanites that deactivate regular nanites.
The test run is a success until ZAG-RS, the rogue AI system from the village of engineers from The Architect,
hacks into the satelite to steal the deactivated nanite research. Holiday manages to shut down the satellites\' systems
thus preventing the download and trapping ZAG-RS but causes the satelite to enter orbital decay.
Rex arrives to help using the Space Elevator but the damage done to the elevator destroys it. With the assistance of a drone named Salvator,
Rex is able to stabilize the station with an escape pod with Rex, the surviving crew and nanites on board.
However, it is eventually revealed that ZAG-RS downloaded herself into Salvator to avoid the effect of the shut down and now
intends to leave everyone else on the satellite while she escapes to earth in Salvator with the nanites and the research.
However, Rex and Dr. Holiday are able to defeat ZAG-RS by both destabilizing the station and sacrificing the nanites.
The episode ends with a crew member, Dr. Holiday, and Rex in an escape pod in the middle of the ocean awaiting pickup.

While making a midnight taco run with Bobo, Rex gets a call from Circe stating that there is a problem in Abysus.
Agent Six and Dr. Holiday come along with Rex when an anomaly is detected there. Meanwhile, Bobo conducts missions that distract White Knight,
including dinner, a movie, and some time at the beach. Dr. Holiday discovers that the floating goop is actually
nanites that have become unstable and are multiplying. When a giant one-armed E.V.O. attacks, Circe,
Biowulf, and Skalamander also appear and Six thinks its a trap, but they end up fighting the one-armed E.V.O., which dissolves.
Biowulf cuts off Circe before she can reveal what had happened. At the Van Kleiss\' castle,
Biowulf explains info revolving around what would happen if anything happened to Van Kleiss.
They pull a scroll out of a machine that states that Rex is the key to fix Abysus. Rex agrees to run the machine to help stop the spreading of the unstable nanites.
This in turn happens to be a plot to revive Van Kleiss and that his force is the only thing that can keep Abysus together.
When Rex discovers this, he stops the machine mid-cycle, causing the half-formed Van Kleiss to dissolve, and damages the machine.
Rex refuses to activate the machine, so he tries to cure the nanites, but is overloaded with nanites.
Dr. Holiday suggests to Rex to talk to the nanites, and in the process, the nanites responded.
However, instead of receding, the nanites contract, causing the castle to fall apart, putting Six, Holiday, Circe, Biowulf, and Skalamander in danger.
Left with no option, Rex repairs the machine, activates it, and, while noticing something different, revives Van Kleiss.
Once revived, Van Kleiss, recedes the nanites into himself, growing larger in the process, saves Biowulf and Skalamander,
but refuses to save Rex\'s loved ones (including Circe), unless Rex joins Van Kleiss. Left with no choice, Rex agrees, and Van Kleiss re-stabilizes Abysus,
saving Six, Holiday and Circe. With a celebratory handshake, Rex discovers that Van Kleiss\' nanites were changed by the reviving process,
and cures him, making him human. Van Kleiss brags that his greatest strength was not his nanites, but his intellect, and out of nowhere,
Breach returns, pulling Van Kleiss to safety through a portal, and the Pack escapes as well. Circe stays with the Pack, while Rex leaves,
unable to understand girls (something that he and Six share in common).

Rex faces off against a group of mutant locusts that feed on metal, leaving a path of destruction behind them. However, defeating them is not an easy task as.
When they are attacked, the locusts keep dividing through binary fission.
As the locusts rage toward China (which holds the Earth\'s largest metal concentration, Beijing), Providence pulls out all stops to halt their advance.
Dr. Holiday comes to odds with White Knight, Six, and Rex as she strongly protests against their \"attack first, ask questions later\" policy.
Finally, the team is forced to consult her for help when the increasing numbers of locusts destroy the Great Wall of China where Providence had made its stand.
Eventually, Dr. Holiday synthesizes a concentrated version of a pheromone tag used by the locusts to mark prey, which she sent Rex to gather.
While trying to gather the pheromone, Rex almost ends up dead. However, the nanite that Dr. Rylander injected into Rex saved his life,
and the only sample left was in his underpants (which had red motorcycles on it).
After everyone had a good laugh (Dr. Holiday gave Rex his underwear in front of everyone), Providence sprays it on the locusts,
causing them to go berserk and attack (and devour) each other. Finally, Bobo, as revenge for Rex destroying more locusts than him,
makes it public that \"Providence\'s Secret Weapon, Underwear, Saves the Day\". Rex leaves the Providence briefing room in anger as the story runs on TV,
while the other Providence agents continue to laugh at his expense.

Rex decides to attend \"Providence Boot Camp\" in an attempt to beat Noah. Once the boys arrive at the camp, they must dissect E.V.O.s,
do sit-ups until they puke (literally), and even brush their teeth a specific way.
When Rex and Noah fail a crash landing test and are ordered to do it over and over again until they do it correctly,
they realize this may not be as easy as they thought. Things take a turn for the worse when a cadet, Kenwyn,
who is angry at Rex for dropping her rank from #1, turns off the power restraint collar placed on E.V.O.s agents in training must battle.
As a twist, the General sends her down instead of Rex since Rex fought it eariler in the episode.
All the E.V.O.s, including Weaver, break loose and wreak havoc until Kenwyn works with Noah and a very helpful extra to distract the E.V.O.s so Rex can beat them.
These four graduate from Basic Training and Noah and Rex are seen walking down the Stone Steps, betting money on who will make it to the bottom first.

A powerful virus has put all of North America into a deep sleep. While E.V.O.\'s are immune, somehow Bobo has been affected,
leaving Rex the lone agent dispatched by the White Knight to address the outbreak of emergencies.
Though a temporary fix, Dr. Holiday manages uses electric neural stimulation to stay awake long enough to build a tracking device
designed to locate the source of plague before finally succumbing to sleep. Left with no other choice,
White Knight uses a protective weaponized suit to assist Rex in locating the source of the virus, an E.V.O. dubbed \"Patient Zero.\"
After Rex is unable to cure Patient Zero, White Knight and Rex fight over the best way to handle the E.V.O.
During the fight, White Knight reveals he is completely nanite-free. Meanwhile, the E.V.O. manifests a living incarnation of the virus,
forcing Rex to enter the E.V.O. to cure it. Despite having his suit breached, Rex is able to get White Knight back to Providence in time to leave him nanite-free.
Afterward, it\'s revealed that Bobo was not actually affected by the virus,
instead sleeping off a massive hangover he suffered from a party he had the night of the outbreak.

It\'s Rex\'s birthday (more accurately the anniversary of when he first joined Providence) and Six has flashbacks about how Rex first joined Providence.
Back when Providence was forming, captured E.V.O.s were detained only until they were disassembled on a molecular level for study.
However, Dr. Holiday, an assistant at the time, believes that studying how nanites cause mutations may
one day allow for an option other than kill or contain: cure. One day, Six and his partner White Knight were called to Mexico
to deal with a rampaging bio-mechanical E.V.O. only for the E.V.O. to collapse after being battered enough and revealed to be fourteen-year-old Rex.
Rex cures a second E.V.O. right in front of Six\'s eyes and he brings him back to Dr. Holiday to be studied.
Despite Rex being her all and more of her wildest dreams rolled into one, Six insists that they keep him under wraps for now.
However, White Knight finds Rex and brings him to the head of E.V.O. Studies, Dr. Fell, in hopes that disassembling him will reveal
how his curing powers work and how to cure the entire planet all in one shot.
However, Six believes that it is too big of a risk to sacrifice what they know will work for something that might work.
With assistance from Bobo, a recently captured E.V.O. who was holding the Kremlin hostage for caviar before his capture, Dr. Holiday is able to save Rex.
However, White Knight and Six\'s fight had caused the E.V.O. disassembly machine to overload and destroy all the nanites in White Knight\'s body,
but Rex is able to save White Knight\'s life by turning off the machine with his powers, in the process, bleaching White Knights skin and hair.
Rex\'s curing abilities has given Providence much needed funding and White Knight is made head of Providence for his zero nanite count.
Back in the present, Six gives Rex a TantÃ´ inscribed with the symbol of loyalty for his birthday and states that he has its twin
(which was given to him for his birthday the day he found Rex) and states that it is a symbol that they are going down the same path together.

A large Providence convoy commanded by Six is transporting a case of unstable nanites through a desert.
Rex, Bobo, and Noah are assigned the humiliating task of transporting the force\'s toilet paper on a beaten-up truck;
Rex is further annoyed at not being allowed to drive. After his attempt to resuscitate the truck\'s radio backfires and fills the cabin with smoke,
the three stray down a side road. Meanwhile, the convoy is ambushed by a criminal gang of self-declared anarchists, led by the deranged cyborg Gatlocke.
The gang successfully hijacks the nanite carrier, only to discover that it is a decoy, its actual cargo being toilet paper;
the nanite case had been covertly loaded onto Rex\'s truck. After some misadventures including an unsuccessful snack stop
and an attempt to flirt with girls in a convertible, Rex, Bobo, and Noah trace their way back to the convoy route,
coming across the aftermath of the ambush and the waiting gang. Gatlocke demands the truck; a short brawl ensues between
him and Rex before the three are able to escape with the truck and one of the gang\'s all-terrain vehicles.
After a running Mad Max-style battle, the gang is defeated and Gatlocke falls into a canyon; his cybernetic parts damaged,
he climbs out and demands the nanites again when Providence relief forces show up. Six explains that the nanites are now inert;
what he had meant by \"unstable\" was that they were vulnerable to vibration. The turmoil of battle having resulted in their deactivation,
they are now useless to either Providence or Gatlocke. An enraged Gatlocke takes a swing at Rex; he is knocked out cold and taken into custody.
Rex, Noah, and Bobo get back in the truck, Rex finally being allowed to drive.

Rex and Noah are aboard the Keep and returning to Providence HQ when news breaks of surprise attacks against major Providence bases around the world.
Having lost his nature-controlling powers at Rex\'s hands (he has apparently manage to turn himself back into a E.V.O. through a as of yet unidentified means),
Van Kleiss is out for revenge; he personally leads the Abysus forces which board the Keep.
Rex counter attacks, but is restrained by Biowulf long enough for Van Kleiss to drain Rex of all his active nanites.
This alters his powers into the mirror image of Rex\'s: as Rex is able to cure E.V.O\'s, Van Kleiss is now able to create them, which he demonstrates on Captain Calan.
The depowered Rex is thrown from the Keep by Biowulf, but is rescued in midair by Six\'s jumpjet.
Van Kleiss is determined to destroy Providence once and for all; the Keep is rammed into the HQ tower, and a heavy battle develops.
Rex, Noah and Bobo escape in a jumpjet to Purgatory Base, where Rex risks his life by immersing himself in active nanites in order to reactivate his powers.
The procedure seemingly activates the large, unusual nanite that Dr. Rylander had injected into him in Dark Passage.
Providence HQ is about to fall; Van Kleiss makes it into the situation room, defeats Six, and dispatches Biowulf and Skalamander after White Knight and Dr. Holiday.
Rex reappears and attacks Van Kleiss, manifesting a new, whip-like build granted by Rylander\'s nanite; he is able to use its abilities to disable Van Kleiss.
Meanwhile Holiday takes down Skalamander by releasing her E.V.O. sister, and White Knight lures Biowulf into a trap.
Van Kleiss is snatched to safety by an E.V.O., while Breach sets bombs throughout Providence as a diversion.
Rex finds he is able to shut down the entire HQ with his new powers.
Providence takes Biowulf, Skalamander, and many other E.V.O.s left behind into custody; Rex, back to his old self, cures Captain Calan.
Rex is warmly commended by White Knight and confidently observes that while Van Kleiss may be back and more powerful than ever, so is he, and the war is not over yet.
