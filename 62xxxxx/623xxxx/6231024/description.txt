Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of four, John Keeler's life has been marked by a determination to make it as fulfilling and rich as possible. In this honest and heart-warming book he describes his journey from childhood to adulthood; from that initial diagnosis, through dealing with pain, fear and ignorance, to his situation today, where he feels in control of his diabetes - it no longer controls him! 

At times humorous, at other times raw and blunt, John Keeler highlights the feelings, experiences and the (often overlooked) practical difficulties that people with diabetes often face. Here you will find advice on how to avoid the common pitfalls, honest descriptions of the emotions you may feel, as well reassurance and support. 

This book is aimed at fellow sufferers, but also their families, friends, and health care providers, who wish to learn more about how you can live life fully with diabetes...............
