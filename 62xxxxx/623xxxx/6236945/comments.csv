,res687q,2011-07-22T14:57Z,Thank you! After trying so many of these this was the only one that ACTUALLY worked!
,JPeterson,2011-09-21T17:19Z,can you tell me who made this disk? so I can ask for support for it. in vmware the cd drive is not found after reboot (only a and c is found) so setup can't continue.
,vpittol,2011-10-17T05:44Z,jpeterson: this problem is well known in vmware a workaround is coping the folder to C: and start the setup from local disk
