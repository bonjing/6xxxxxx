Coleman Randolph Hawkins (November 21, 1904 â€“ May 19, 1969) ,American jazz tenor saxophonist Hawkins was one of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument. As Joachim E. Berendt explained, "there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn" While Hawkins is most strongly associated with the swing music and big band era, he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s
Lester Young, who was called "Pres", in a 1959 interview with The Jazz Review, said "As far as I'm concerned, I think Coleman Hawkins was the President first, right? As far as myself, I think I'm the second one." Miles Davis once said: "When I heard Hawk I learned to play ballads."
 Hawkins was nicknamed "Hawk" and sometimes "Bean".
