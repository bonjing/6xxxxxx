,YuMaNuMa,2011-04-05T14:00Z,"Nah, its not difficult at all but this guy is being a dick, taking over torrents that are usually uploaded by eztv and making them in rar nightmares. That's right, im ungrateful that your uploading because if you weren't uploading I'm sure someone with a bit of sense will upload proper 720p in actual mkv or avi files.

If your not going to do it properly then don't do it at all. "
