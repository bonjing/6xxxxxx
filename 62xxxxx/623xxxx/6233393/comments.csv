,JoeEDangerously,2011-07-16T10:06Z,"Sorry guys. I'm having technical issues. Both of my torrents are not seeding. Apparently the tracker is down, and I can't seem to fix it. Please be patient. I'll be back up ASAP, but until then PLEASE SEED! It's a small file. I can't do it right now. I need some help with this. Let's all be cool and help each other out."
