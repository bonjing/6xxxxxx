      DEFACED hardcoded the english softsubs for the french parts    
      into the avi which is not allowed."Burned subtitles are only   
      permissible when present in the source" (txd2k9).              
      For those who think it was present on source, you are welcome  
      to check their DVDR. Their xvid/dvdr and our xvid are all      
      from a R1 DVD and it does not have hardcoded subs. See         
      Sample dir for matching samples etc.                          
      For those who wish to watch the movie with the subs for       
      french parts only, they are streams 7 and 8 on the vobsubs.
