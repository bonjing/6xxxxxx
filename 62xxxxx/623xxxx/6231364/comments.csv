,jg4545,2011-08-20T17:03Z,"Hi,
I installed the app without any errors.  I skipped the part where it asked where to install documentation.  However I can't see the VS Icon on the desktop or the launch vs.exe file anywhere.  How do I launch VS2010.
Thanks in advance.  Also the installation never asked for a key."
