PLOT:
Jasin and his vampire brood's time is running out. In order for
them to survive, Jasin needs to find a mortal to turn into a
vampire to spend eternity with. Los Angeles provides plenty of
young candidates. The brood has their eyes set on Tara, a young,
gorgeous blond college student. Tara is open to the idea of
becoming a vampire, but someone else enters the picture to
disrupt the brood's plans. Caleb, a fresh face college student
new to Los Angeles, keeps dreaming of a mysterious stranger.
At school, Caleb meets the stranger, Jasin, and they have an
instant connection. The problem is that time is short, and
Jasin needs to convince Caleb that eternity as a vampire can
be a very sweet life.
