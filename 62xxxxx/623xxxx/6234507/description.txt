Anyone growing up in the UK in the 60's, 70's or 80's will remember the iconic nature series with Jack Hargreaves, puffing away on his pipe as he led us into the world of fishing, farming, hunting, horse riding and oher nature pursuits. This is a 27 episode summary of a series that ran for nearly 30 years, condensed from the best episodes of the tapes he bought from the TV company after the series ended.
