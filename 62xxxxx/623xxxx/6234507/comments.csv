[T],Smokey9t9,2011-07-08T12:55Z,I'll soon be releasing a re-edit of these with the file size reduced to something more suitable than a massive 490mb per file for only a 24 minute episode. Whoever ripped these used a ridiculously high video bitrate. I'm testing the conversions and 190mb per ep is looking good as a compromise between picture quality and file size.
