,yourmate,2011-03-19T05:57Z,Robston ... does putting the link for the complete series mean you won't be uploading the remaining episodes?
[T],Robston,2011-03-19T17:37Z,"No.

It's just that CaptainCap asked about Episode 17.

My torrents are broadcast episodes, smaller files, different file format, and a different bitrate, so I'll finish off the series.
