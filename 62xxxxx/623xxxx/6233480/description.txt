In this almanac appear stories of love, renewal, the importance of community and our relationship to the earth. Shadowing these lighter themes are darker truths of untold atrocities committed by settlers on indigenous Australians during colonisation, the mass hysteria regarding a Scottish witch-hunt, flourishing love and good old-fashioned heartbreak. 

The album weaves a compelling musical tapestry balancing contemporary influences with classic, folk-rooted song writing and is the third studio album by Anglo-Australian quartet Emily Barker & The Red Clay Halo.
