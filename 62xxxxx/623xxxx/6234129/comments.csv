Why download the whole KIS 2011.Here is the link without KIS but with detailed instructions.

At the time I did do a search for similar torrents before
I tested and uploaded mine, and I came up with no
results, so I decided to share this with everyone with
great step-by-step instructions.

I included the KIS 2011 so that people would not
have to download 2 separate torrents.. this is a
""one-stop-shop"" where you get everything you need.

Plus.. with my torrent, there are files within it that
""make it seem"" like it will work with older versions
of KIS. I scanned ""ALL"" the files, but did not test
with ""older"" versions, only the ""newest"" KIS."

,Twizted1,2011-03-11T21:55Z,"Any ""experienced"" user of torrents, cracks, patches,
knows that this is the MOST COMMON ""false positive""
out there.

Of course its going to give this warning, because
they (Kaspersky) want you to ""have"" to BUY their
product.. otherwise, how will they make money?

Use this torrent, or don't.. I know it's working for
me, and my system is still running strong."
,dubistjac,2011-03-12T17:27Z,It's working properly for now. I hope fltlib.dll file will not used as a spyware to steal personal info by another software.

Make sure that you do ""everything"" correctly using
the Universal Shield and adding the ""exclusions""
inside Kaspersky."
,Twizted1,2011-03-17T00:28Z,"Ok just to make sure.. you did these steps right?

Add exclusion rules:

Open KIS2011:
- Settings
- Click the cardboard box (icon)
- Threats and exclusions
- Exclusions
- Settings
- Exclusion Rules
- Click on ""+ADD"", Select object


32Bit OS Users Path:

C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.dll
C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.ini


64Bit OS Users Path:

C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.dll
C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.ini

*** INSTALL & CRACK Universal Shield ***

After it is installed.. REBOOT (Kaspersky still TURNED OFF / DISABLED)

-- Run the program using the CRACKED .exe file

Then...

Click on PROTECT, Select FILE (on left side) and browse for the following two files:

C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.dll
>>>> (make sure it is set as NO ACCESS)

C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.ini
>>>> (make sure it is set as READ ONLY ACCESS) [will have to click ""OTHER""]


Select SECURITY (in the menu), Trusted Processes, Add to List

C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\avp.exe

And click OK

*** AND THEN DO THIS ***

Select Options (in the menu)

Enable - Protect After Exit
Enable - Protect On Windows Start
Enable - Protect In Windows Safe mode
Enable - Password Protect (if you have multiple users on your computer)

*** AND THE FINAL STEPS ***

Reconnect internet, start KIS and re-enable these:
1. Settings >> General Settings >> uncheck ""Enable Protection"".
2. Settings >> click the cardboard box (icon) >> Self-Defense >> uncheck ""Enable Self-Defense"".

That's it! Complicated but works well, does NOT mess up on reboot as the dll is protected."
,Twizted1,2011-03-17T22:31Z,"@inewphone

It's ""probably"" due to the fact that you might still
have the FOLDER and FILES from the .RAR file on
your desktop (or wherever).

Just follow the instructions provided, and it will not
detect the ""REQUIRED FILES"" for this to work.

So in essence.. go ahead and delete that file UNLESS..
another program that you are using is using that
""cracked"" file that it detected."
,x5452EO,2011-03-21T17:07Z,Thank you very much. it is working like a charm.

,lewis56,2011-03-29T17:17Z,"I have followed the instructions correctly. It works as long as I do not reboot the computer.  Once I reboot, the fltlib.dll file gets deleted and requestes me to put the key again. Even univershield I have done as per the instructions.  What could be the mistake."
,lewis56,2011-03-29T17:20Z,not working once rebooted the fltlib.dll file gets deleted.  Any suggestions.
,Twizted1,2011-03-29T21:41Z,"@lewis56

You ""must"" follow the instructions for putting the files
in the ""EXCLUSION"" part inside Kaspersky.

And you must also follow the instructions about how
to ""PROTECT"" the files using Universal Shield..
and give those files ""the proper read/write/do nothing"" handles.

If the files are getting deleted, and this is not working
for you, then you are NOT excluding the files
with the Kaspersky ""exclusion list"" feature (as instructions say to do)..

And you are NOT ""protecting"" the files with the
program Universal Shield (as instructions say to do)..

Please .. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, DO NOT
SKIP STEPS OR TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO
ACTIVATE ""SELF DEFENSE, ETC"" WHEN IT DOES
NOT TELL YOU TO."
,whys0seri0us,2011-03-30T02:59Z,The key no longer works even with the Universal  Shield option.

,dubistjac,2011-03-30T11:44Z,Unfortunately yesterday evening licence file was exploded by Kaspersky. :(

,Twizted1,2011-03-30T23:47Z,"Funny at all you saying that your ""keys"" are blocked..
My Kaspersky (pirated using this method) is still running strong.

If yours is not working, then it is due to ""human error""
not the programs, or instructions."

,dubistjac,2011-03-31T13:56Z,"@Twizted1 Bro, KIS wants to update fltlib files. But Universal Shield have locked the files. So KIS can't update and it has to reinstall the application. Please search new methods."

ATTENTION EVERYONE !!!

This is no longer working. Those darn Kaspersky
programmers are smart wankers :)

If you like this AV, then here is a little trick that
allows you to ""RESET"" your ""TRIAL"" as many times
as you want to.

Wait until you have around 10 days or so left, and
then try this:

** STEP 1:
Open Kaspersky and allow it to load.

** STEP 2:
Disable ""Self-Defense""..
Settings > Card Board Box icon >
Uncheck ""Enable Self-Defense"".

** STEP 3:
Exit the Kaspersky program.
Right-click the icon in the
""Task Tray / System Tray"".. Click ""Exit"".

** STEP 4:
Click ""Run"" within your ""START"" menu and type:
regedit .. and hit the ""Enter"" key.
This will open your Registry Editor in Windows.

** STEP 5:
Locate the file ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > 
SOFTWARE > Kaspersky Lab > protected >
AVP11 > Environment"" in your ""Registry Editor"" 
and click the ""Enviroment"" folder to open it.
You will see ""ProductStatus"" in the list in the 
RIGHT WINDOW PANE after the folder opens
(some scrolling is required).

** STEP 6:
Right-click ""ProductStatus"" and choose ""Modify"".. 
Type this: Beta .. and click ""OK"".
Exit the Registry Editor.

** STEP 7:
Re-open Kaspersky.

** STEP 8:
Open the ""License menu"" (bottom right of 
Kaspersky window) and click on ""Activate Beta License."" 
Follow the directions in the dialog box till you reach ""Finish.""

** STEP 9:
Re-Enable ""Self-Defense""..
Settings > Card Board Box icon > 
RE-CHECK ""Enable Self-Defense"".

Your Kaspersky TRIAL has been reset.


Question: Does this method convert Kaspersky 
to ""BETA"" version or no?

Answer: No! Your database will NOT change .. 
This is only considered an ""evasion"" method.

Enjoy your ""endless"" trial periods if you continue 
to use this method.

,matthill4569,2011-04-01T05:43Z,@Twizted1  does this method only work when u have 10 days left?  or can u apply it right away?   and how long does it reset the trial for?  thanks dude. ill try it now and see what i get.
,Twizted1,2011-04-01T06:56Z,"@ matthill4569:

Question 1: You can do it when you have 29 Days

Question 2: Yes you can apply it right away, FOLLOW
THE INSTRUCTIONS I POSTED.

,Kashxk,2011-04-25T02:01Z,"I don't know if you've notice this, Kasper now have the auto patch feature and is patching this version x.556 to a newer version [x.57something] and I think that it's because of that patching that the crack don't work anymore [as Kasper lab has surely block this crack in the new release] after restarting Kasper after complete update. By my side, I was getting this prob; Kasper was not launching after restarting it after a complete update. There was an avp.exe process with less than 10K memory usage running but no Kasper icon at the bottom right and a Win pop up saying that av is turned off. After doing a repair, it would auto detect that the 2048 days key is a fake. Thus no crack effect. If a way can be found to prevent the auto patcher to patch the Kasper, the crack would surely continue to work. Already tried to block avp.exe write and delete thru universal shield with no result. One shall try to do an audit [file/properties/security/auditing] of the avp.exe to perhaps understand better what's happening while auto patching as it bypass Universal shield. Hope that this notice will be useful. Thanks to the creator of this crack for his effort."
