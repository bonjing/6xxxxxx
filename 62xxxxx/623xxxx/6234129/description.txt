--------------------------------
--- INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT ---
--------------------------------

- INSTRUCTIONS (very detailed)

- Kaspersky 2011 Internet Security. [Version: 11.0.2.556en]

- Universal Shield 4.4 ["file protection program" that will "safe guard" the
.KEY files.. if you follow the instructions PERFECTLY.. no room for errors]


Complicated but works well, does NOT mess up on reboot as the dll is protected.

** I "think" it will work with other version. **
** Only tested "and using" with KIS 2011 v11.0.2.556en [[INCLUDED]]
