,Kronical4,2011-03-09T21:46Z,Thanks Shadowhawke! +1 from me.
,Illanair,2011-03-09T21:47Z,"If they require the XML editing, aren't they just as encrypted as Black Market / Prince? Eg. they don't work yet? -.-"
,toto621,2011-03-09T22:11Z,"need decrypting too, like the other 2 DLC, wait for decrypter ^^"
,Kronical4,2011-03-09T22:11Z,"@Illanair

No it does not work for now, as stated in the info ""WAIT FOR THE DECRYPTER"". Though I would download it now just to already have it ready :)"

,uroshuchiha92,2011-03-09T22:41Z,Yeah thanks for the upload.I'll wait for the decrypter.
,Gektei,2011-03-09T23:36Z,"No need to wait for the decrypter from what I can tell.  When editing the manifest.xml, change requiresauthorization=""1"" to requiresauthorization=""0"" and delete the part that says MID=""203"" leaving just a single space between Bioware=""1"" and requiresauthorization=""0"".  Save, close, play.  I haven't actually gotten to the point where I can see this DLC working in game, but it no longer says ""unauthorized"" when you click on the downloadable content button from the main menu.  Will update if 100% verified."
,uroshuchiha92,2011-03-09T23:59Z,If you mean that your not at the part where your at your own house with the delivery chest then no...not working for me.I got the items from Dragon Age Legends and registering for newsletter on forums and tomes from 1milion demo downloads and sharing on facebook.But no signature edition items yet.
,Maikoes,2011-03-10T00:41Z,"@ Gektei: Doesn't seem to work. Yes, it doesn't say ""Unauthorized"" anymore, but the DLC won't come up either."
,Mad_Fm,2011-03-10T01:06Z,Thanks Shadowhawke.
,Gektei,2011-03-10T01:15Z,"Roger that.  Seems we will have to wait on a decrypter then.  I'll take a look at some of the other config files, but I doubt there's anything further I can do at the moment."
,Illanair,2011-03-10T01:23Z,"@Toto: Odd - I missed that last bit. Must be the horribly organized description ;)

/topic: The XML editing will only allow the game to run the DLC - the actual files will still be encrypted, so the game can't actually touch them. Hence the need for a decrypting tool (I'd wager less than a week)"
,shanefilan,2011-03-10T01:26Z,thanks bro. But I should wait for decrypting tool
,toto621,2011-03-10T01:33Z,"I tried the russian DLC activator version 6, it didn't deypted DLCs but the ""bonus unlocker"" button worked a bit, it unlocked 4 items (belt+lion sword+lion shield+tome), here is the download link :

There's your decryption right there! "
,toto621,2011-03-10T02:37Z,"After some try, all 18 bonus items were unlocked using the russian activator, pretty good, now we just have to wait for decrypter :)"
,KenjutsuShai,2011-03-10T03:09Z,"**READ PLEASE**

This DOES work, and so does the other DLC (Black Emporium/Exiled Prince)

You have to CREATE AN EA ACCOUNT in-game and LOGIN. After you LOG IN, the content WILL WORK.

I am PLAYING THEM BOTH RIGHT NOW as well as THIS. This DOES WORK. But you MUST make an account!!"
,markoose,2011-03-10T03:33Z,"You must be pretty damn stupid to login to EA servers with an illegal copy of their game. 

Yeah it will activate it but they'll have your I.P. address which will mean shitstorm for you.

Anyone who actually knows what they're doing will wait for a decrypter."
,Kronical4,2011-03-10T04:06Z,"@markoose

You obviously did not play DAO, or ME1,2, everyone logs in, and they do not do anything about it, at all. But you do what you want, i am not gonna tell you what to do, as you shouldn't either.

@KenjutsuShai

I have tried that before, and I have had no success, I guess your lucky :), thanks for the help though. 
"
,premiado,2011-03-10T04:43Z,"Works with a legit copy. Not with a ""erm hmm"" copy."
,lulzorama,2011-03-10T05:29Z,"@kenjustsu:

The content does NOT appear in the chest, not the signature edition stuff anyway. The only stuff I've gotten to appear is using the russian downloader thingy (link on this page) and pressing the buttons, then clicking the one under the email, finding the profile thing, and then it unlocks a few items int he game, but NOT the sig edition content. "
,KenjutsuShai,2011-03-10T05:42Z,"@markoose

And exactly how will they know it's an ""illegal copy"" might I ask? Because I have a NO-CD? NO-CD's are NOT illegal you stupid fuck, if I want to use a NO-CD with a copy I BOUGHT I have every damn right to do it.

Let's say they somehow know my copy is ""illegal"" as you say (which the thought alone is retarded, much like you) and they ""have my IP"" as you say, what then? They use my IP to track me to my ISP to track me to my HOUSE so they send their G-MEN to my doorstep? I'm not Gordon Freeman you dumb fuck.

Thank you from Russia, now go fuck yourself."
,KenjutsuShai,2011-03-10T05:46Z,"@lulzorama

I'm sorry it doesn't work for you, but just like the other DLC, I installed the DLC and it appeared in my ""Downloaded Content"" and when I went to Gamlin's House in the bedroom my chest was starry and I saw all my nice items there.

I'm sorry it doesn't work for you but making an account worked for me."
,Kronical4,2011-03-10T05:49Z,"@premiado

Okay that makes sense, thanks for the info."
,firemark,2011-03-10T05:58Z,Is it possible to install that on PS3? there is same folders
,hunter837,2011-03-10T06:07Z,"the decrypter is already out in the black emporium+ exiled post (available in the comments), the file has two bats, on decrypts both dlc from some keys already written inside the bat, the other bat, slurpdakeys.bat, gets the keys required to decrypt the dlc out of a machine decrypted by connecting to EA, what we need is for someone who decrypted the signature DLC to run this bat and post the key here, then add the line deda2drm.exe DA2_PRO_COL ****whatever key goes here**** to the decrypt bat "
,hunter837,2011-03-10T06:13Z,we need someone who decrypted the signature DLC by connecting to EA to run slurpdakeys from the black emporium decrypter and post the keys retrieved in slurped.txt
,frankb716,2011-03-10T06:19Z,Well i did have connect it to my account and now have my item !!!And if they come at My door :P ill never download a game again i swear!! but for now !! let play :D

,Kronical4,2011-03-10T06:26Z,GUYS I HAVE IT WORKING BUT ITS NOT LETTING ME POST THE DECRYPTER FOR YALL.. BARE WITH ME
,Khro,2011-03-10T06:41Z,"When I double click the exe provided in this torrent, it says that Dragon Age II must be installed to run the signature DLC content. I have definitely installed it already, so what do I do?"
,KenjutsuShai,2011-03-10T07:24Z,"**For those who get the error ""Dragon Age 2 must be installed first""**

I've noticed that if you install the game or if you got the copy that I got where it just extracts and you run the cracked .exe for and than you MOVE the game folder or RENAME it, you will get the error.

I don't know if you all are getting the error for doing that or for something else, but for those who did rename/move the folder, try renaming it back. That worked for me."
,Furious1964,2011-03-10T18:08Z,"How can I unlock the following:

Might of the Sten
Apostate's Courage
Adder of Antiva
Seeker's Bulwark
Ring of Resilience "
,flankers,2011-03-10T19:05Z,"All those dlc are sadly really poor...prince was mere assigment without any story. I expected a bit more from that. It is just content removed from standart game again :( Witch hunt, Awakening and Shadow Broker FTW. Those are true DLC.

But one thing is atleast ""visually"" interesting. Staff of Pharlatan. That would be nice to have here. "
,uroshuchiha92,2011-03-10T21:30Z,Is there anyway to make this work?I have the items in extras as unlocked but they are not in the chest at home...
