Rather than have 3 different torrents I have created one torrent with, as far as I know, every episode of Peppa Pig available

This has been pieced together from lots of different torrents so thank you to all that have taken time to put the various dvd's and TV rips.

Some episodes aren't perfect because I have cut them from torrents that have all the episodes together in a single file but they are as good as.

I have put them up as individual episodes so you can download the entire collection or just the files you want or need to complete your collection.

If you are looking for the DVD's the Wikipedia page gives a rough idea of which shows are on which dvd's  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppa_Pig#DVD_Releases
