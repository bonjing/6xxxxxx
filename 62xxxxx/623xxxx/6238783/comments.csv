,bert16,2011-03-23T02:22Z,"How or where do you find an updated list of trackers like the ones you uploaded? As you're aware, trackers are like anything else on the web -- they come and go. The important thing is keeping up to date."
,bert16,2011-03-23T02:44Z,"Another thing: How do you add the trackers to uTorrent? The first time I did it I think I got it right, but now it's not working. I highlighted the file I trying to download, went down to where it says ""trackers"", left click to where it says ""add trackers"", but when I paste them only one shows up, and if I paste another one using the one-by-one system, it puts just one and erases the previous one. What am I doing wrong?"
,neil22768,2011-03-24T17:27Z,your doing it right just highlight all the trackers in the list right click and copy them go to your torrent add tracker on the last tracker already in the list make sure you press enter twice they need to have a space inbetween each tracker but ive already done that in the list so just press enter twice after the last tracker in the list should work fine
,bert16,2011-03-25T03:28Z,"OK, thanks - I think I got it now. I highlighted the torrent, clicked on the tracker tab, and pasted them in, and they're all there. Also, how do you update the list? If that's a secret, then can you upload a new list every now and then? There's a proggie I leeched from one of the sites called ""Tracker Checker"". I haven't installed it but I don't know if it would be useful for finding them."
,neil22768,2011-04-01T09:01Z,lol theres no secret to find working tracker all i do is when i download a torrent i just check the trackers on it then if i see some that are working that ive not seen before i just copy and paste them into notepad and use them on my downloads and uploads simple
