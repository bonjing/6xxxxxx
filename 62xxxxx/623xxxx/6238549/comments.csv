    *
      For their first day on the job as the new protectors of Metro City, Megamind and Minion are selling off the gadgets from their evil lair. But when one seemingly harmless ""button"" unleashes the gigantic robot MEGA-MEGAmind, the duo will have to resort their old tricks to restore order in this all-new action-comedy from DreamWorks Animation.

Um, you're a fucktard, just like the idiots who ripped this. It's not a small file.

This is a 15min SHORT, so 312MB is BIG, not small (that's about 2.4GB for a 2hr movie!). This should be on the order of 100 MB.

Having said that, this one isn't as bad as some others."
,alveolate,2012-03-13T05:16Z,"@michael yes, it's a Short, everyone can see that. the noob is entitled to calling it ""small"" as compared to the oversubscribed 4~8gb BRRips out there (regardless of length). you, on the other hand, could use some industrial-grade mouthwash."
