Conspiracy theories are not clever, they're not right, they're stupid. And evangelizing Christianity at a time like this is terrible.

I personally have no problem with all of the people saying they are praying for Japan. Because they're not trying to evangelize people. People can be praying to whichever god they wish about this matter, as long as they don't try to chastise people for not being Christian or Muslim or the like about it. Or think that praying is some kind of substitute for donation. No god would think that prayer is even equal to donation. I'm personally donating to the Red Cross, and I am praying to the Pagan gods for Japan. But I'm not deluding myself to think religion should be a more important part of this than hands on help. So don't try to make this about Jesus!

I will download these, if only to spread videos around that others can see, footage of what's going on in Japan. But I think the religious tone to these uploads in cringeworthy. You make me sad uploader, you really make me sad for doing this this way."

,lorenzho,2011-04-14T03:00Z,"awaken888 thnx for the up, but physical Israel are not Gods chosen and the rapture is a lie. Jesus is the seed of Abraham, as well as the Blessed Hope."
,zaroba,2011-05-02T19:47Z,"between your 3 torrents of videos about the earthquake, you have 219 videos.

now, i seriously have to ask, did you even bother to LOOK at any of them?  there are MANY fake videos, such as commercials and videos that only say to go to a website to view the video, was even some videos of people on a camping trip.  there are DOZENS of duplicate videos that are just different resolutions of the same feed.  there's also videos that are just people's youtube broadcasts of them talking about the earthquake.  there's quite a few videos which were made from people pointing a digital camera at a tv showing a news broadcast when those news broadcasts are already in the collection of videos.

i downloaded all three of your torrents totaling 219 videos.
after about an hour of work, i'm already down to 124 videos.
that's almost 100 videos that were fake or duplicate."

Over 90% is redundant."
