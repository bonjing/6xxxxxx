,kmc1979,2011-03-12T13:44Z,"@S.45

think what dirty_nigger is trying to say is don't be such a dumb fuck... do ya think bone is psychic... these things don't exactly have release dates... now go back to fucking your sister ya redneck klan loving ballbag..."
,GrosShadock,2011-03-12T14:50Z,"What I wonder is why is it usualy from Russian that the cam arrive first.
I mean the movie is filmed in English language and in the USA, so it would be more logical that leacks would come from there.
Someone knows ?"
,some-young-guy,2011-03-12T15:48Z,"Russian's paties aren't bunched as tight as ours is when it comes to compliance with foreign copyright laws.

@webo_0, because American film makers traditionally target American dollar holders as their target audience.  Any chance the average South African has more US Dollars in his pocket than the average American?  Be thankful we gave ya District9.  We could have very easily filmed that in PhilTHadelphia or Dirtroit and accomplished the same slum effects."
,some-young-guy,2011-03-12T15:49Z,Russian paNties*
,Rob93,2011-03-12T16:32Z,"Plus, (and this is by no means intended to be a blanket, ""always the case,"" rule) I would be far more likely to become immersed in, or feel a strong sense of empathy for someone who looks quite different from myself and my community. And even MORE SO w/people who SPEAK differently than I, & my peers, speak.
I understand how crude that may sound but it's the truth. Xenophobia has been around for a LONG, LONG TIME! Sometimes positive results come from it(like when confronted with a horde of hostile aliens bent on destroying all humans and stealing their world), but more often, people become victims of it. It has a tendency to snow ball into something FAR REACHING and CRUEL, e.g. eugenics, Nazism, etc.
I WOULD like to point out that, though I am admittedly ignorant of the background, ""Dirty_Nigger"" is probably NOT a good way of promoting community and liberty. But HEY, who the f*#K am I, SI?"
,S.45,2011-03-12T16:47Z,"@kmc1979
How hard is it to guess a date? maybe it's pretty hard for retards like you. But for real people it's pretty easy. If anybody knows the release date of the R5's it should be the people ripping them dipshit. now please try again on insulting me because that redneck shit doesn't work. This isn't 2007 buddy."
,S.45,2011-03-12T16:50Z,The R5 rip should be out around 7th April 2011. See how hard that was! Fucking morons!!!
,creek75,2011-03-12T16:52Z,"Tokyo destroyed, Paris Destroyed, London Destroyed... but they waited to get Los Angeles last. D'yu know why? Can you imagine the conversation on the alien ships. ""Aw, commander why the f**k do I have to go there of all places. The smog is terrible, the people totally up themselves with Prius cars that actually get shitty in town mileage. They think actors are best place to run the government. They pretty much f**ked themselves already - why bother?"""
,creek75,2011-03-12T17:00Z,"
Tokyo destroyed, Paris Destroyed, London Destroyed. Now at last they turn on Los Angeles.
Do you know why the aliens went there last? Imaging the conversation on the alien space-craft. ""Aw, Commander! Come on, don't send me there. There's smog, everyone is up themselves driving a Prius that in reality gets shitty mileage in town, no one there actually realises there are other countries in the world, they won't even notice us if we don't go there, plus they think actors are best placed to run the government and provide informed social comment. They have pretty much f**ked themselves anyway! Why bother invading?!"""
,Prosper0,2011-03-12T18:43Z,when do americans learn to make movies?
