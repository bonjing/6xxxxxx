,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T12:50Z,"I have never uploaded a torrent before. I am back in the days of Bulletin Board Systems, IRQ, News Feeds, then Mule and now torrents. But I have never uploaded anything.
I notice in uTorrent I am have no traffic and no connected peers even at times when TPB reports Downloaders. It has taken at time several hours to seed a 23 kb file.
But in my router Logs which I have been collecting for the last several days and am in the process of doing a WhoIsIP on, I have hundreds upon hundreds of connection attempts to my uTorrent port every few seconds....and yet no peers in uTorrent.
I am not DL or UL anything else.
And I wonder if it associated with my constantly being knocked off the net and receiving blue screen in win 7 and other lockups.
I am losing connection now every 10 minutes.
I have gone for days upon days on the net with no problems.
It is only when I attempt to seed.
After looking up the IPs in my logs I am considering posting the contents of those logs in my next post and the names associated with any organizations that own those IPs.
I understand from reading in Forums that Media watchdogs are now flooding torrent seeders through the trackers in retaliation.
These posts are not in anyway illegal and contain no copyright info.
Is the flooding being done illegal?"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T13:22Z,"I am losing connection every ten minutes from someone flooding through my upnp settings in my router.
In order to stay on the net I am having to disable upnp and thus shut don utorretn. I could open an indivual port, but that would not help.
This last attack not only knocked me off the net again, but it removed my usb wirlees from my hardware. It removed it.
The same thing happened last night. It took me two hours to get the operating system to recognize the usb device again.
I am using an new N usb Wirlees reciever with no problems unless I attempt to seed these posts.
And it is getting very frequent now as I posted these last posts.
Most of the information is up. Again the actual copies of the documents concerning thes posts are on a thumb drive with a friend.
I will repost these in the future if the seeders drop them.
Until then I hope the few people I have seen DL these will seed them for me now. 
I have to close uTorrent and my upnp at this point. I can barely stay on the net otherwise.

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T13:27Z,"I will however work during the next few days to remove from my logs any organization names that are relevant that have been flooding my router and computer.
I will post these here. I have hundreds upon hundreds of IPs. If they are not proxies of some time or valid DL. If WhoISIP references any organization I will post those IPs here in the next few days.
Posting the contents of these Posts are not illegal.
I would assume flooding an individuals network via the internet simply because they are torrenting, I would think that would be illegal."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T15:11Z,"My sisters husband's Company in which she is an executive is in Ochelata. They have branch offices in Beijing Paris and representatives in Cairo and Indonesia among other locations.
I have now decided that it is necessary to inform the IRS that my brother-in-law has been forging my sisters signature on legal documents, primarily his income tax statements for the last twenty years or so. He is already facing $190,000 in back taxes on their 7,000 sq ft home. He has been funneling most of his income through his parents as gifts to his family to avoid paying taxes. He lists little income from his company in which he serves as President.
I have previously reported this to the government and received the links to the IRS to mail the forms involved. I will do this this evening.
I am merely stating what I am now in the process of doing. I have avoided this in the past because I have felt that it would diminish what I was trying to accomplish.
I have been trying in this to avoid being construed as being vindictive in anyway. But I believe all of the details in this need to be released both to the IRS and here publicly to document.
Let me make clear. I am simply making public record of what I am now doing to document this.

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T15:26Z,"There is a man in OK who is currently serving 14 years in prison for his part in a penny stock scheme which was responsible for $50 million in stock fraud.
On that project my sister was the PR representative involved in the stocks in question. She was paid $30,000 to $60,000 a year for her part time work from her home office to represent him and the others convicted in this, which involved Ruby Beverages and other stocks.
The fraud involved the release of media information to escalate the price of the stocks and then dump the stocks.
I am unaware if she gave deposition or testimony on that case. I do not believe she did.
Which considering her involvement concerns me.
I cannot get people to listen to my reports of a fourteen year old boys death from severe sexual abuse in 1974 which involves 1) a state Advocate on the Board of a Major local Mental Health Organization and who also serves with a Health System that works with children currently and 2) a Juvenile Counselor for the Tulsa Police Department who as times worked unsupervised living in tents with kids on Ropes Courses.
The connection between my inability to get DHS to respond to these reports over 20 years to very many doctors, clinics, case managers, and hospitals concerns me when I see that my family also appears to be above the law for some reason in many other areas.
I think these issues need to be made available to the public because the government seems to be failing for some reason in investigating these things. And the media refuses to.  "

Please read particularly the last few comments in all my posts but mostly IAL and Ochelata. The comments contain more info than the torrents now"
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-12T23:09Z,I have linked this to Youtube. I am in the process of linking it on Craiglists forums internationally
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-13T08:44Z,"I am in Bit Spirit Finaly starting to see the 2 most important posts on here being seeded consistently. I see on each of the two latest posts around seven seeders.
And I am relaxing now a little. I have put these here because they will not be acentral server to be removed by someone under presure.
On my Blog someone from a forum posted on my Inland Post how special Eddie was, and how special a friend I am to see that he is not forgotten. And others are safe.
In so many have turned away, so very very many individuals and organizations I once admired, respected, and believed...his words are an incredible comfort to me in thi.\s."
