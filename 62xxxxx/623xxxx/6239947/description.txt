Single from the 2010 Indie-Rock release "Pine"
By: might

New Hampshire Tone-Based Indie Rock



This song has Tons of Toned-Out Atmosphere - 
a mirage of analog synth is swimming in the background - 
very powerful vocals - 
the Bass is running through a Rotary speaker cabinet,
so it sounds like a crazy organ is driving the groove - 

killer track off a great Indie release!

If you like this real rock - SEED! - Share!

Real bands need music to sell shows!
NOT shows to sell music!

Good music needs to be circulated - 
people deserve better than the chop, screwed, and glued computer-tron shit-sandwich rock that's been all over the radio.

digital filters, auto-tune, over use of compression,
pads, digi-synth, click tracks - 

that's not music.

our ears know better -
