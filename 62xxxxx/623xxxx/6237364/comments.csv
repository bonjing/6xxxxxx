,lillibit90,2011-03-17T10:33Z,"It doesn't work. It says its illegal copy!

I Drag Papers app to Applications Folder
And I move the archive com.mekentosj.papers.registration.plist to

/Library/Preferences/ (Register for all users)
~/Library/Preferences (Only for you)

But when I start the app. First it ask where install the paper's library and the order of the documents, and later appears a pop-ups saying its an illegal copy and open the official paper web page for buy it.

Any idea?"
