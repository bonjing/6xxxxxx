,ed.boey,2011-03-21T10:44Z,"One thing for sure:

Jesus ain't Christian and JESUS CERTAINLY AIN'T MOSLEM AND HE IS NOT ARAB. Stop wasting your time trying to convince other people about your ""PERFECT RELIGION"" and your ""PERFECT PROPHET"".

Just use your own brain and let others use their own brain to make their own decisions. But one thing for sure, your satanic god will command you to hate and kill others who cannot see any truth about your religion"

in islam it is prohibited to kill anyone anyone anyone    UNLESS he attacks you or killed someone on purpose, and even if someone killed one of your family in purpose, you have the choice of forgiving him and then he will only punished for the puplic rights 

that was just to add for your knowledge

you are wrong about jesus_peace upon him_

I'm muslim, but it is a fact that he is the prophet of christianity, the original christianity, not the christianity of these days that had included many human additions and subtractions, the reason for which we believe in jesus & chritianity but knowing that this one is not the right one so allah sent Muhammed _peace upon him_ to complete the same message of jesus_peace upon him_

in Quran there is a great respect for christians because they are very close to right but they are also have a lot of distortion that were made by higher leaders within them

here is section from quran in Surat Al-MĂÂ'idah ayah 82: ((((You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah ; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, ""We are Christians."" That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.))))
