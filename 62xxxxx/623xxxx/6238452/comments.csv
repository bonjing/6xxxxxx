Thank you and enjoy , all the dlcs are already available and ready to go in this Role Playing Game , portable game file ."

what speed is everyone getting cause mines pretty crap"
[V],globeplus,2011-03-13T10:48Z,"To crossebby : thank you for your comment and about Dead Space 2 , everybody knows that sometimes the worked executables can get circunstancial bugs on the gameplay , 99% of them probably ok but one or another game can get slight problems because the work on the executable , can happen if you know what i mean , for Dead Space 2 in particular , it is a bug on Chapter 7 that it is easily passed by with the new crackfix but that it is not everything and on the start of chapter 11 a new bug in a door happen and for this one you have saves immediatly after that point available or if you prefere the unlocker that can be downloaded from the Game Copy World , i recommend too to take a look at the Trainer+12 that gives you absolute control in a nice way on the gameplay with infinite health , ammunition , stasis , money , 99 powernodes , oxygen , hacking time and maxinum inventory slots and one hit kill and zero gravity but on this last one circunstancial bugs can happen , it is really just playing , launch him click on the correspondent keys to what you want then just keep going chapter after chapter until the game finish , of course that you still need to understand how to make some moves inside the gameplay , moving objects for example but that it is the game itself , so this game on the inicial worked executable got 2 bugs on the 7 and 11 chapters but thatÂ´s all , nobody dies and they are easy bypassed .

Cheers ."

,Pogaru,2011-03-13T18:54Z,"I have extracted the game in C: but,
1.SAVE/LOAD DON'T WORK
2.There is not sound in cinematics but this is less important
3.DLC are present but I don't know how to to launch them. Maybe after finishing the game they will be work.
Most important thing, save/load, don't work
