Heart - Magazine


Wiki info:
1977 release
The change in labels resulted in a prolonged legal battle with Mushroom's creative director Shelly Siegel. Mushroom, still having a 2-album contract, claimed they had the legal right to release a second Heart album after all. Having retained ownership of the 5 unfinished studio recordings Mushroom mixed them without the band's approval. The label also added Here Song, a rare b-side, and filled up the rest of the album with 2 live songs recorded in 1975 at The Aquarius Tavern, a Seattle rock club. Mushroom released the collection as Magazine in the spring of 1977 at the same time that the group was preparing their next album for Portrait titled Little Queen.
According to Flicker, about 50,000 copies of the original Magazine album were pressed. 


...For the 1978 version Heart chose to re-record, remix, edit, and re-sequence the recordings.
