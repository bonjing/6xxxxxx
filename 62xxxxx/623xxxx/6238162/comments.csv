The album was first released by Mushroom Records without Heart's permission in 1977. Then the band sued the record company successfully, and forced them to recall this one. To satisfy their contractual obligations for a second album the band RE-RECORDED this album with changes in the lyrics, instruments, length of songs, etc. The new version was released in 78. If you're a Heart fan, get this one too, it's rare!"
