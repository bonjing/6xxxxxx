,AARRGG,2011-03-09T21:17Z,does everyone get their stuff from the same source or just rip eachother off with the same copies with only the tiniest differences to them?

Wait for a better release, Watching this copy on big screen will be a mistake. 
And yes Its missing the beginning as other releases."
