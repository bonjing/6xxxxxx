,scotla_6,2011-03-12T00:42Z,Does this work on r4?
,Tomdaboy,2011-03-12T05:50Z,@scotla_6 yes it should
,CandySlush,2011-03-12T07:01Z,"I just get told that the file is a firefox document, also there is no readme? Help!"
,Tomdaboy,2011-03-12T07:43Z,@CandySlush It is a .rar file so you need to have winrar to open the file.
,Rolekewl,2011-03-12T11:55Z,"It DOES work,but it's too laggy for my computer (even after 3D disable).Giving 1+ on quality"
,xgst,2011-03-13T02:13Z,"Ive been doing this all day and nothing seems to work. I wiped everything I had and tried one last time, got no$gba, and downloaded your game file. I got all the codes in and replaced but it freezes when I hit new game. help?"
,Tomdaboy,2011-03-13T02:50Z,"@gst 
1.Have you tried using Desmume? 

2.Also make sure that the settings in the readme are the same in the no$gba .ini

3.make sure the settings are flash512K for the NDS Cartidge Backup Media, no cash(or opengl for better quality), Sound is on, and the code is activated then game is resetted.

4. If none of these helped you, I'm sorry I couldn't assist you but if a save file is all you need, I'll be happy to upload a save file for you."
,Roroos,2011-03-13T17:01Z,How do I change the codes?
,Tomdaboy,2011-03-13T22:01Z,"@Roroos press f2 add new, then paste the code, action replay code(AR), then create, double click to activate, reset emulator. :)"
,xgst,2011-03-15T05:14Z,"I appreciate the help tomda boy. as I typethis and waste your time, I am downloading everything new... for the 8th time (and yes I have kept track) hopefully It will work. thanks again."

,Tomdaboy,2011-03-15T09:24Z,@xgst np Hope you finally get it working somehow.
,XoLWoX,2011-03-21T12:56Z,if you download desmume emulator 0.9.7 you dont need the codes it will save like an original DS
,Roroos,2011-03-23T10:11Z,That isn't working maybe i'm just stupid cause this is the fist time i have to change allot but when i try to do that the only ting i can change is the name :')
