A millennia ago, the world of Nosgoth fell under a dark shadow. Kain was murdered and chose to become a vampire. Upon exacting his revenge, he had the choice to sacrifice himself to save the world, or become its ruler, and, in doing so, plunge it into darkness. For Kain, the choice was obvious.  

One day, Raziel, the first of Kain's vampire lieutenants, evolved before his master Kain. For his transgression, he was cast into The Lake of the Dead, where his body burned for aeons. Rescued by the mysterious Elder God, Raziel now sets out to avenge himself in Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver. 

Gameplay occurs in a 3D, over-the-shoulder style, with some elements of Tomb Raider. Many games carry themselves with eye candy, or else they sacrifice graphic quality for gameplay. Soul Reaver falls victim to neither trap, excelling in both categories.  

As Raziel travels through Nosgoth, he can switch to the spiritual realm, a twisted mirror of the physical world. Each world has different properties that he must recognize in order to proceed. Also, it is impossible for Raziel to die; loss of energy will simply lose him his corporeal form, forcing him back into the spirit world.  

To stay healthy, Raziel must consume the souls of his victims. His vampiric brethren are vulnerable to fire, water, and impalement, and Raziel employs all with equal relish. One person's blasphemy is another person's sustenance!    

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is a gloomy, mysterious, and enjoyable game, with a cinematic storyline and stunning sights and sounds. Don't wait for a full moon; enter Kain's realm as soon as possible.
