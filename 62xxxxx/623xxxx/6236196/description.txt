 Description:
 A special hour-long edition of Bang Goes the Theory sees the team set up camp 
 in their very own weather workshop. Their mission is to get under the bonnet  
 of our winter weather and explain it as never before.                         
                                                                               
 Dallas, Liz and Jem find out first-hand what it feels like to stand in one of 
 our worst British rain storms and to have a blizzard smack you right in the   
 face, as they challenge their ingenious weather chamber to recreate the       
 conditions of two recent big storms in order to really experience how much of 
 a punch those weather events packed. And in a genuine Bang first, they attempt
 to make cloud, rain and snow in the studio and from scratch.                  
                                                                               
 In the first half of the special we explore what makes wind, where clouds come
 from and why we get battered with wet and windy storms every winter. In the   
 second half, the team turns down the temperature dial as they ramp up the     
 challenge to explain the science behind the big freeze that has paralysed the 
 UK for two winters in a row.                                                  
                                                                               
 As they uncover the extremes of our winter weather out and about in the       
 wettest and windiest parts of Britain, back in the studio we follow table-top 
 demonstrations that put the science of the weather to the test, from how to   
 make your own cloud, to whether boiling water will crack a frozen windscreen  
 and why some kind of snow is simply the wrong kind..                          

                                Enjoy!
