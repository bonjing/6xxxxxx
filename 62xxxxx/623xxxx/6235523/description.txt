Rozencrantz and Gilderstern are Dead

I saw a play in Snowmass with a friend about twenty years ago. I love it. It was at a summer festival. It was Shakespeare's Hamlet from the point of view of Rosencrantz and Gildenstern.
When these two were in Hamlet you saw it from their perspective. And as everyone knows in a Shakesperean  tragedy, everyone dies in the end.
Towards the end of the play Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are given a sealed note and are encharged to escort Hamlet to England who by decree of the note is to be killed by the King there.
Hamlet discovers this, jumps ship, after changing the note to have the unsuspecting dupes done in themselves.
At some point they read the note and realize their fate. And in this version of the play Rosencrantz says to Gildenstern.

Have you ever wondered at what point as a child you realized that you didn't live forever? It must have been trumatic in that moment. And yet for the life of me, I cannot remember when that was.




Shakespeare created life in Romeo and Juliet.
They seem to be real people that existed in time to us.
He merely breathed life into them through his words,
for eternity.
And in these words, I hope to keep Eddie alive in this world
as he is in the next, forever.
And all I can remeber of him to tell you is
that he had God in his eyes. It wasn't a metaphor, it just was.
And if for just a moment that takes your breath away, than somehow someway you have just felt him too...

Too many ideas from movies
Too many Romeos and Juliets.

I love you Eddie.
