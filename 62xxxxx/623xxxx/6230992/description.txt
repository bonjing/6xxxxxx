The rules of Survivor are simple: average Americans are abandoned in the middle of some of the most unforgiving places on earth. Divided into teams, they participate in challenges given by host Jeff Probst, and every three days, the losing tribe must trek to Tribal Council to vote out oneâ€¦ More of their own. Halfway through the game, the challenges shift to individual competitions when the tribes merge and become one. Now the game is every contestant for themselves.

The game is simple: Outwit, Outplay, Outlast, by winning immunity, thus not being eligible to have votes cast against yourself. However, the players must be careful about who they send packing - because after the merge, a jury of previously voted out contestants begins to form, and each week they return to watch the Tribal Council ceremony. At the end of the game, they vote for one of the members in the finals to win one million dollars and become the next Survivor!

Generally, each season begins with a twist - something different to surprise the new castaways. Survivor is a game of adaptation, and the final two or three of each season are the players most able to adapt to their surroundings and to the people they are playing with. Survivor focuses on the people, and the social commentary that surrounds them. The game revolves around how these players can Outwit, Outplay, and Outlast.
