Imagine the leaders of one of New York Cityâ€™s top real-estate firms coming together every Monday morning to hearâ€¦the moral and spiritual thoughts of a Rabbi.
Imagine them returning, week after weekâ€¦coming to eagerly anticipate those five minutes as a moment of uncommon peace in the worldâ€™s most brutally competitive environment.

Wouldnâ€™t you like to be a fly on the wall? To hear the paths Alan Lurie traced for his listeners, how he helped them bring together their spiritual and business lives, the sacred and the profane? Five Minutes on Mondays compiles these talks for the first time, sharing Lurieâ€™s deep and profound inspiration on the challenges we all faceâ€“at work, and in life.

Lurie draws on millennia of philosophy, theology, and science to help us answer our deepest questions, comfort our deepest yearnings, and become better peopleâ€“more connected to each other, and to the Greater Purpose.
