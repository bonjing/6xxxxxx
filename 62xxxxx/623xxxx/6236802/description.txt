PROPER Notes.....: In the UK this docu is aka 'Master of Disaster - Death Trap'. BiQ's release has jerky playback and 
		   blended frames throughout. The original framerate of this series is NTSC not PAL. You will notice 
		   in the screenshots that the two have slightly different orientations. That's because the screenshot 
		   of BiQ's release is a frame blended from two different frames. Both screenshots were taken from the 
		   first frame at a scene change.
