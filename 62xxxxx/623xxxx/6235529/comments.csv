,enonumus,2012-03-12T08:18Z,"This is identical to the other full DVD torrent.  Something is wrong with this rip.  In technical terms it looks like a non-terminated signal, where the light colors are completely blown out, and everything else is washed out.  It might not seem to bad if you didn't have a proper copy to compare it to, then you can see that it's a MAJOR problem.  I absolutely would NOT recommend this torrent to anyone, you're way better off downloading a 700MB XviD copy.  Also, this torrent took 2 or 3 days to download, only 1 or 2 seeders at any given time.
