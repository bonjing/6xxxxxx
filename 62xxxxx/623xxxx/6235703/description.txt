Ok, this is a repack of all existing Dragon Age 2 DLCs. It contains:


- Black Emporium
- Pre-Order Bonus Items
- Signature Edition Items
- The Exiled Prince

(Isaac's armor from Dead Space 2 is obviously included too).



IMPORTANT NOTES (yes, important, so read):


* Everything is cracked for you, you only need to press "Install";

* You will need to access your Special Deliveries chest twice in order to obtain Signature Edition and Pre-Order Bonus Items. Which means that you will need to exit the house, and return again;

* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list;

* Installing a new patch or a different crack WILL disable DLC bonus items, because accessing them requires hacking "DragonAge2.exe" file, and as you know, patches and cracks replace this file.

Oh, and the usual warning: Comodo, ClamAV, and probably Avira may detect any and all my installers as viruses. I don't know why, and I don't care. There are no viruses, and have never been any.
