,thankuforurhardwork,2011-03-11T17:49Z,thank you very much looks simple and you already did everything for us if i screw this up i should probably never touch computer again...
,illiria,2011-03-11T18:02Z,"@ thankuforurhardwork

You're welcome. :)

BTW, seems you need to access the chest twice only if you do so from your estate, not the uncle's house. Probably just the way the game handles things. Or maybe some of the items you can grab right away, and some when you become a Champion. Who knows.

Anyway, I guess I should upload more of my works... Probably Dragon Age: Origins full DLC pack too. Just not sure if anybody still needs it."

,KracKils,2011-03-11T21:14Z,Sounds too good to be true but it is possible it's as good as stated. Looking for further confirmation that the exe file is legit. Tends to be scary using a exe file blind.
,TheVGamer,2011-03-11T21:14Z,You're the man! The first DLC that actually works for me (copy&paste v of DA2).
,illiria,2011-03-11T22:17Z,"@ KracKils

Everything I make is in EXE files, because I make repacks. I prefer to make things easy, so I make everything automatic. Check my other torrents - it's all legit.

@ Everyone

Thank you for your support, people."
,Maddlyl,2011-03-11T22:51Z,"Everything works perfectly!
i really recommend this torrent"
,druid513,2011-03-12T04:04Z,"There is no quest for new prince character? I complete main story already. I can access to a new room to change appearance and summon dog, but there is no new quests and new map? "
,illiria,2011-03-12T04:43Z,"@ druid513

The quest is called ""Faith"", if I'm not mistaken. Prince himself is not a quest, and he does not give you the quest. The woman in the chantry gives you the quest. Check for quest called ""Faith"". I think that's it."
,illiria,2011-03-12T04:48Z,"Oh, and if you've completed the game, woman got killed and the chantry got destroyed. So you probably and likely can't get the quest after completion. I believe you have to play this quest before the final game events take place. I did, and it worked just fine."

,jamesensor,2011-03-12T05:08Z,If it isn't for these guys to publish these torrents and let us play and see all content i would never found out this game was a huge scam from EA... thank you all :)
,dark_illusions,2011-03-12T05:58Z,works perfect nice work on the fast upload and all with the game still being new
,gx240,2011-03-12T06:18Z,Great job on this.  It's the only working DLC pack I've seen so far.
,Lasher,2011-03-12T08:04Z,I wanna get Origins. + Full DLC. although I'm downloading a 20GB Mass Effect 2 + full dlc and patches. lol.

is the staff of parthalan included...???
i need to know this before i download this torrent.."

,illiria,2011-03-12T16:09Z,"@ skything

Yes, your staff is included, I just launched the game and checked - it's there. :)"
,illiria,2011-03-12T16:14Z,"@ daucuskarota

Looks like Ring of Whispers isn't there, probably has not been cracked. Can't tell for sure though. I'm not the one who made the cracks."
,steveleven,2011-03-12T16:15Z,"i have downloaded the first DA2 (clone DVD) that was available and it should be compatible with this, technically it is, but i still have minor issues which i dont have with another (without DLC) crack: 

- no Black Emporium
- no The Exiled Prince
- and for some odd reason the frame rate doesnt drop, but the whole game slows down to a crawl, menu's, combat, walking, etc etc...

now i already started playing without the DLC, but i know anyone would rather play with it. any tips?"
,illiria,2011-03-12T16:28Z,"@ steveleven

Might wanna try NVIDIA Beta drivers, if you have NVIDIA graphics card. In latest beta they claim to have improved compatibility with DA2. As for missing DLCs - no idea. Sure you're installing in the right folder? I can't be of much help, sorry."
,steveleven,2011-03-12T16:29Z,"oh i forgot to mention, i got ""a"" staff of parlathan, but (forgive my ignorance) where's the sword staff of parlathan...? all the other items are there i checked =D"
,steveleven,2011-03-12T16:44Z,"well illiria i'll tell ye what i did: 

i downloaded http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6220745/Dragon_Age_II-CLONEDVD%5BThedesiaddA%5D . and i got a crack with it (but thats not important). 

i set that up and i didnt change a thing, i unpacked, and used the installation exe. that came with ur DLC pack, and i noticed another DA2.exe which put in the installation folder (bin_ship)."
,Senteliks,2011-03-12T16:44Z,thx i download this in 4 sec it work perfect 
,dragowar,2011-03-12T16:46Z,this torrent ROCKS!!!!!
,illiria,2011-03-12T17:30Z,"@ Jibi

From what I can tell, it's normal. Quests appear during the main campaign. Post campaign save is needed for future DLCs.

These DLCs will not appear in your post-campaign save, they were never intended to.

Because (SPOILER):

Prince's quest is involving appearance in/near chantry, which was destroyed at the end of the game."
,illiria,2011-03-12T17:34Z,"@ steveleven

That is correct. My installer uses RELOADED crack which was patched to unlock pre-order/signature edition items. If I wouldn't change EXE, you wouldn't get any items at all. EXE itself doesn't cause any slowdowns, however. I'm not sure why do you have this problem. Or why DLCs don't work for you."
,illiria,2011-03-12T17:37Z,"@ steveleven

I assume not all the possible items have been unlocked with the available patches/unlockers. You, errr, will have to live with it. :P Maybe in future releases of unlockers everything will be cracked, but so far it isn't. You still get tons of items, so I wouldn't worry much."
,steveleven,2011-03-12T18:01Z,"im just lucky the version i downloaded doesnt require the whole installation (key codes, long waiting times) and when ever i do remove the characters are saved lol. so Illira keep up the good work for those that it did work =D and keep making these easy patches/DLC packs and i hope the next one works for me 

CHEARS!"

,uroshuchiha92,2011-03-13T01:20Z,I wish someone can crack the Ring of Whispers already...I know it sounds greedy but I want to have everything.Its even worse when your only missing one thing for the whole collection :P
,accrow01,2011-03-13T01:29Z,"The DLC doesn't work for me, not sure where I'm going wrong, I just downloaded the game and installed the crack that came with it and then tried to run your DLC and it gives me an error when trying to copy the files over.  So I dunno what is up, or how to fix this."
,illiria,2011-03-13T04:16Z,"@ accrow01

If my installer gives you an error trying to replace the file, then your ""DragonAge2.exe"" file is likely in use. Check if it's in use, or restart your computer."

@ smi10tha

Working crack for what? I already warned - do not replace the EXE file, it will disable pre-order/signature edition items (you will likely still have them if you already got them, but they won't appear in New Game).
As soon as a new patch and crack come out, I'll look into modifying the new crack to access the items again - if it won't be made by default."
,btor718,2011-03-14T01:45Z,"Just wanted to toss in my two cents here.

Installed like a dream and everything was unlocked in-game.

Thank you for the excellent work. Keep 'em coming!!
"
,Ratspike,2011-03-14T03:06Z,"This doesn't have all items, it's missing the Ring of Whispers, anyone know how we can get it?"
,Vegasbob,2011-03-14T04:27Z,"Ok so just to make sure i'm understanding this correctly. Part of this pack includes a modified ""DragonAge2.exe"" file which can be used to replace another crack file and this one IS required for this cracked pack to work correctly in game and give you the DLC items you've been able to unlock here. 

It's strange they decided to do it this way this time although not supriseing they made it so your .EXE file is modified based on what DLC you are eligible for. Or am I completely wrong here and there is simply something you had to do with the .EXE to make the DLC content avalible also?"
,whitescar911,2011-03-14T06:27Z,"Can someone help me plz, after i installed the pack the game crashes every time i load my saved game and when i start a new one. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled and now all my saved games still wont work, Whats happened?"
,illiria,2011-03-14T12:17Z,"@ Vegasbob

Normally DLCs do not require a modified EXE file - you are correct. And, I believe, future DLCs will not modify the EXE in any way.
What seems to be the case, is that Signature Edition (and probably Pre-Order Editions) have a different EXE than standard edition. I assume there is some flag in EXE like ""EnableBonusItems=1"" (or 0, for standard edition) - something like that. And while it is enabled in various pre-orders (from different gaming sites) and Signature Edition, it is disabled in standard.

@ whitescar911

Not a clue why does your game crash, and especially spoils the savegames. Maybe it has something to do with the RELOADED crack that is included in my repack? Or maybe something went wrong in your Windows/drivers. I can't say for sure, sorry.
The game does have savegame issues on single-core processors though, it is well known. Try using your old crack, if it will help. You won't get items this way, but you'll get other DLCs."
,Airsolo,2011-03-14T14:53Z,"You done a very good work.
I had the others dlc's installed and I download yours just to see if was OK and i was amazed because its is easy and fast to instal.
