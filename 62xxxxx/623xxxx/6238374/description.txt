Product Description
Concise and authoritative, this book set the standard for excellence in basic mechanics texts. The major emphasis is on basic principles and problem formulation. Strong effort has been made to show both the cohesiveness of the relatively few fundamental ideas and the great variety of problems that these ideas solve. All of the problems deal with principles and procedures inherent in the design and analysis of engineering structures and mechanical systems with many of the problems referring explicitly to design considerations.
