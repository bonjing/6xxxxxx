PROPER Notes.....: In the UK this docu is aka 'Master of Disaster - Avalanche'. ViLD's release has jerky playback and 
		   blended frames throughout. The original framerate of this series is NTSC not PAL. A good spot to see
		   the jerkiness is about 00:04:36 with the snow fall. There is also distortion in the bottom few pixels
		   in many frames throughout the release. For the blended frames, I provided some screenshots.
