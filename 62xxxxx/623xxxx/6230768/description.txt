A psychological thriller set in the world of New York City
ballet, Black Swan stars Natalie Portman as Nina, a featured
dancer who finds herself locked in a web of competitive intrigue
with a new rival at the company (Mila Kunis). Black Swan takes a
thrilling and at times terrifying journey through the psyche of
a young ballerina whose starring role as the duplicitous swan
queen turns out to be a part for which she becomes frighteningly
perfect.
