,azer000,2011-03-13T11:40Z,"Seeing as I'm blind, I can't comment on the video quality, but the audio is perfect for a stereo version! It's not the line audio, and the end credits are not cut down, so I suppose this must be some kind of early dvdrip, pity that tha audio is not 5.1"
,imbackagain0101,2011-03-13T12:21Z,many tnx
,cartman19987,2011-03-13T16:32Z,"The video quality is very bad, I'd give it a 5. Audio is decent, an 8. Yes, I know the DVD comes out April 11, but there is almost always a DVD-quality version out way sooner than that. Unfortunately, that's not the case for this movie, or Little Fockers."
,azer000,2011-03-15T18:49Z,"Anyone an idea about when the bloody dvdrip will appear at last? The DVDRip of Angels & Demons was release THREE MONTHS before the acutal release in the US! HP7 will be released in less than a month, so it's about time for a dvdrip!"

Thanks for the up Murlok, but will wait for a better rip."
