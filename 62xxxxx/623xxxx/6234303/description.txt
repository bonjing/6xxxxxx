Describing the music for Homefront, Harwood explains, "Stylistically, the orchestra, which was fused with electronic elements that were supported by Asian percussion, was the brick and mortar. I also wanted to use guitars (both acoustic and electric) to help sell the locale. Asian instrumentation such as the erhu and pipa are heard to help mold the sonic quality. When we recorded the orchestra we did so in New York and it was a thrill to hear the score brought to life by the caliber musicians here in the city. To me, Homefront represents something rare in gaming, where the story and what it has to say are integral in the experience. Composing music for Homefront was a pleasure. I hope you enjoy listening!"
