Real Genius 1985 Comedy Nerds College Tech Mystery Soundtrack 80s Val Kilmer

By far the best of the 1980s "nerd" comedies featuring highly intelligent
protagonists, "Real Genius" catapulted Val Kilmer to stardom. Like many
good 80's films, "Real Genius" is backdropped by a memorable soundtrack.

Unfortunately, like many other 80s films, it suffered from a horriblly
grainy DVD transfer. (The "glowing Kilmer" DVD cover was also hideous.)

One of the all time best 80's college movies, 3 November 2001
10/10  Author: thirdi from United States

Val Kilmer is hilarious as a college genius on par with Einstein, but is more interested in partying and chasing girls. A new arrival to the campus, Mitch, is a brilliant 15 year-old whom Val takes under his wing and tries to get to loosen up and have a good time.

There are probably some important themes and ideas to analyze within this movie, but for me it's just an old-school personal favorite that I've seen about 100 times. Great 80's music soundtrack and funny performances. William Atherton is perfect as the self-important, snobby professor, and another highlight is Robert Prescott, who plays his butt-kissing, nerdy assistant "Kent".

A movie that asks the question, isn't life experience just as important for education, as classrooms and books? A very funny, fine film that is up there with "Animal House" in my opinion.
