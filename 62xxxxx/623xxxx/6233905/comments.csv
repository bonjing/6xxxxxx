,artistofwords,2011-07-17T03:47Z,"First off, if there's subs, that'd be really nice to know in advance of downloading the film. Second, I don't get what it is with you people and hardcoding them. I mean, jesus rollerblading christ, at least give me the option to disable them. "
,artistofwords,2011-07-17T03:48Z,"whoops... wrong torrent. Erm, carry on, gentlemen. "
