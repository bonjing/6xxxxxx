The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions  album  by Howlin' Wolf, was one of the first of the super session blues albums, setting a blues master among famous musicians from the second generation of rock and roll, such as Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Charlie Watts, and Bill Wyman..

Backstage at the Fillmore Auditorium, after a concert by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Electric Flag, and Cream, Chess Records staff producer Norman Dayron spotted the guitar players of the latter two bands, Michael Bloomfield and Eric Clapton, talking and joking around. Dayron approached Clapton and, on impulse, asked "how would you like to do an album with Howlin' Wolf?" After confirming that the offer was legitimate, Clapton agreed, and Dayron set up sessions in London through the Chess organization to coordinate with Clapton's schedule.
