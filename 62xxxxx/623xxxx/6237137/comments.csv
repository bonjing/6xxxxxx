,invader__,2011-03-19T20:06Z,"I think this hint is worth for those who want to reinstall anydvd but cannot get rid of expired trial sys block

If you just want to keep using anydvd in trial or reapply the crack, the first thing to do is unistall it (sure :P). 

Then you'll need a live linux distro cd or usb. 

After booting in linux, search for the remaining files that anydvd had left locked when unistalled and delete them.

Sure to prevent all this stuff again prevent anydvd checking for updates in the preferences, as mentioned above.

Have fun!"

,george1052,2011-03-27T23:50Z,Thanks but the license doesn't work for me either. Tried 5 times. I followed the instructions; even tried it with and without the Internet connection. Guess it's just not meant for me. Thanks again!

Guess it's just not meant for me. Maybe I'm wishing and hoping too hard...lol. I need a dvd-copying software program that will combat these newer dvds (layers upon layers upon layers of files...32g and up!)
Thanks again!"
,george1052,2011-03-27T23:54Z,Oooops! I think I hit the submit button one too many times!
,MktgGuru,2011-03-28T01:03Z,"george try these instructions, look at #9:

1)Uninstalled the old version of anydvd.
2)Make sure your disconnected from the internet.
3)Install the AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD.
4)If it asks to reboot, do it.
5)if your computer restarts anydvd will load (you will get trial version) now close anydvd.
6)click on ""AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD Reg"".
7)Open anydvd and you should have a fully registered version.
8)If you get ""trial expired"" don't worry move on.
9)Do a search for anydvd.chk and delete it or rename it to anydvd.bak, you will have to enable hidden files and folders. the locations are as follows:

for xp the location is:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk

for vista:
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

for windows 7 the location is:
C: Drive\Program Data\Slysoft\Anydvd\anydvd.chk or anydvd.key

10)Now open anydvd you should have a fully registered version while your there go to settings and disable check for updates
11)You can now reconnect to the net
12)Enjoy

NOTE: It's Recommended to block AnyDVD from calling home using your FireWall as the Key might be blocked."
