Music : Metal : Lossless
What you are looking at is a combination of the albums A Real Live One and A Real Dead One. But not each one on its own disc the way Maiden has released them, These have been resequenced into the order of the set on that tour. I researched the setlists of the shows used to make the albums and created a sequence that approximated the way the songs were played at them. I also included "Hooks In You" from the b-side of the "Fear Of The Dark" picture disc (This song was recorded on the previous tour, but since it was put out on a disc relative to this album I figured I'd throw it in for kicks).

WARNING: "Hooks In You'" is originally from a 320 mp3 source. Its all I could find. I had the picture disc single for FOAD, but even though the b-side said it was HIY it wasn't. I only found it about a year ago online, and only as an mp3. It is upconverted to flac in order to facitate gapless playback I'm making this clear so no one thinks I'm intentionally trying to scam anyone by upconverting lossy recordings and not telling. If I had been able to locate a lossless source believe me I would have used it.

More to come. Enjoy!
