,trippa76,2011-03-13T00:55Z,"Hi ClaudiaZ, really appreciate your work, but i notice in the last two weeks i havnt been able to watch TYATR on my ps3. I keep getting an unsupported data error, i know how to recode video files but can sumtimes be labourious. any chance of going back to the way it was?"
[V],ClaudiaZ,2011-03-13T18:44Z,"@ uncleroy and mickeymichael: You're welcome, this arbitration week has been great!

@ trippa76: I'm afraid I haven't changed anything about my video converter program, so I can't figure out what's the problem... anyone else is having issues with Y&R videos?"
,trippa76,2011-03-14T13:24Z,"Thanks 4 the reply ClaudiaZ, im not that advanced with codecs and things, but from what i can tell the audio kbps is different to what it used to be. I can play Y&R episodes from the start of the month but none from the last two weeks. Ive been watching Y&R episodes from this site for the past year. I got fed up with the ps3 being so sensitive about video files, so i went and got a media server for my t.v. works fine now. But i'd like to thank you for your hard work and prompt reply. Thank you "
