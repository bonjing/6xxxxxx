Wendy Craig stars as Barbara Gray, a Nanny caring for the children of the rich and well-connected in 1930s post-war Britain. Always on hand to solve problems and offer good old fashioned advice, all with a British 'stiff upper lip'.

When Wendy Craig, who both acted in and created the show, submitted her proposal for the series to the BBC, she used the pseudonym Jonathan Marr because she was afraid that if her true identity was known, she would be dismissed as merely "an actress who thinks she can write".
