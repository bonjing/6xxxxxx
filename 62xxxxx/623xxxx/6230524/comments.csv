[V],twentyforty,2011-03-09T22:56Z,"@dex13troy: Situation here on TPB is ugly, insults and stupidites everywhere and every fucking day. It's like when some punk, right from the  street breaks into someone's home caught family there who just was in middle of nice, quiet dinner... He calmly joins, grabbing from everybody's plate, eat and eat and eat, till was full.

Then he said to house-lady: ""You cannot cook, my mother is better cook than you ever be"", say ""Fuck you"" to present father and grab his own crouch showing something obscene to children.
Instead of leaving, on his way out he just roll his pants down and relief his bowels right on the floor near the doors.
Family would be  astonished - but I would be not. I have that here every fucking day.

One episode as 720p right here is one day of my life. Given away. What for?"
,ArtieT,2011-03-10T11:42Z,"Ah, sorry to see that 2040. Good analogy. How ironic that the minusizers have ttaken against 'friends'!  That's what happens when you think you have to be as offensive as possible (why??)...

Anyway, great work as ever, sir. Btw, in case you didn't know, the last ep (06, 'knowledge') of satirical comedy 'How TV ruined your life' aired Tue night, so might be available from your source, if you want to do it.  In it he talks a lot about 'Ghostwatch', which you kindly encoded for us - great minds, eh?! 

Thanks again, and don't let the buggers get you down!

Cheers"

""@ALL 20-40 fans: Where the fuck are you guys? Cant you seem to realize that when you download you should click on [+] sign above. Thats the least you could do in return.

Why are you letting the [-] hitting gutted heads RETARDS ruining the moment. Not just on this one but on so many other torrents of 20-40 as well. You know his quality is among the best available in this size.

You cannot change the way [-] hitting head's think but you can take charge and out do them and you know how. Try and be responsible.
Show some respect to this man(20-40).""

I am posting it again as most of you tend to forget this thing."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-10T15:46Z,"Nobody (except few) gives a fuck. I got 50 minuses in last 24 hours but my shit, my crappy, worthless encodes have been download 1240 times. 

Well, maybe I would go fishing for a while.  Nobody responsible read my arguments anyhow... and ""+"" clicks came from - twelve people altogether."

,Mickaus,2011-03-23T20:58Z,"People are being unfair, trying to compare a show from almost 17 years ago (season 1 started late 1994) with todays shows released in 720P.

The shows were originally recorded in analogue, you can't really compare it to the latest gen cameras that shows these days use.  Its actually surprising how well the remasters have come out, the picture quality and colours are far superior and these are not just simply crop jobs - they do have extra picture on either side! These are far superior to what anyone could find on DVD, that said it should also be kept in mind that the output can only be as good as the source!

Seinfeld is another show that looks vastly superior in the remasters (even season one) compared to its DVD counterparts."
