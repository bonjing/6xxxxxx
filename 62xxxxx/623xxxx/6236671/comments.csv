,manpret_tea,2011-04-08T11:11Z,"here's a trainer for the game but you need cheat engine to function.., http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_patrician_4.shtml#Patrician%20IV:%20Rise%20of%20a%20Dynasty%20v2.0.1%20+3%20TRAINER"
,a3sir,2011-05-15T06:26Z,will there be a 2.0.4 update?
,Kermit,2011-06-19T04:48Z,"With all the DRM-crap today, it should really be stated what vendor-version this if for?
Steam, Gamersgate, Kalypso itself, boxed version - what? Because this add-on will NOT work unless it's run with the original game from the same vendor.
I've bought this game in the boxed version (since I like boxed versions) and wanting to try this expansion before I decide to buy it to, I downloaded this release - but it simply won't run.
On startup to install it just insists I don't have the original game installed, and aborts the install.
I guess this must be and issue related to DRM - this release is actually a Steam-version or something, and will therefore never ever work with my boxed original game.
So thank's for the effort AiTB - but you really ought to add the information about what vendor the version comes from in the future, since this makes all the difference."
,Kermit,2011-07-06T12:26Z,"@IkkuhHAI:

Yes, I know the game is made by the company Kalypso. That was never the question.
The question is what VERSION of the game this release is compatible with?
Since the different versions of the game the different vendors offer won't work together.
So if this release is originally from Steam - itÂ´s meant to work only in conjunction with the original game - in the version Steam released.
Combining an original game released by Gamersgate with an add-on released by Steam will not work - itÂ´s specifically NOT meant to!

So therefore - detailing from what company the release comes, is really, really important."
