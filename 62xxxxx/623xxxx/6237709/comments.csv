[V],twentyforty,2011-03-12T14:12Z,Thanks my friend.
,skillet92,2011-03-12T14:16Z,Thanks alot for Fringe! :D
,psipsina111,2011-03-12T14:47Z,"@20-40 I greatly appreciate your uploads and I would like to ask if there is a quick way for me to recognize your past uploads, so that when I make a search I can put it in the search title?"
,longdistance,2011-03-12T14:59Z,Thanks for Fringe!
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-12T15:52Z,"@psipsina111: Easiest way is to listen my advice above and bookmark my page.
Second way is Search on top of the page in form
+h264
but you must know for what are you searching for.
For TV.Pack doing the plain Google (TV.Pack) is better idea.
On TPB a search within content of the torrent is  technically not possible.

I do not intend to tag my torrents on any special  way, and people who know and follow me for years have my page bookmarked and usually go there pretty regularly."
,psipsina111,2011-03-12T16:28Z,@20-40 Thanks for the reply. I do have you bookmarked wish I had known of you earlier and saved a lot of download time. I will do as you advice with the +H264 thanks again

,WooZism,2011-03-13T00:35Z,"TY for Fringe.

I somehow missed Episodes 5 and 6 of this season of Fringe and was wondering if it wouldn't be to much trouble for you to upload them in one of your Sunday weekly recap if not no worries I only ask if it isn't inconvenient if it is I'll find them elsewhere 

Again thanx for your hard work and dedication !D"
,the_shroud,2011-03-13T03:47Z,Thx 4 Fringe
,hazel13,2011-03-13T03:53Z,Thank You for Fringe... =>
,Ataractic,2011-03-13T05:55Z,"Sir I have a a BIG request- My hard drive crashed, and all the shows I have marked for 'watch later' are gone too. If you have any of these files with you, can you please add them in your weekly/daily packs?

Episode 4 of insecurity (managed to salvage others, don't know how)
all 4 episodes of mad love
entire season of boardwalk empire

I would have added 'The walking dead' to the list too, but thankfully, I have your Bluray torrent for that (:

If you can't do it, its fine. I feel bad for asking after everything you've done for us.

Thanks, Once again. "
,AbeVigodaLives,2011-03-13T06:12Z,"Thank you, TwentyForty. Your uploads are very helpful to people with slow (rural USA) DSL connections. It's great to finally be able to see Real Time without clogging up my Internet connection for many hours to download a 550MB file.

I'm curious about the word ""quark"" in some of the file names. What does that mean?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-13T07:54Z,"Thanks, folks.

@WooZism: I would add these two in TV Packs during this week. I can't tell exactly, so check it out.

@Ataractic: I would add InSecurity and Mad Love in TV packs during this week. Boardwalk E is gone because I had hard drive crash too, back in first week of February.

@AbeVigodaLives: Quark's are member of leptons (as in physic) and format is explained daily in every Long Header of my torrents. Basically, quarks use to the max all available psycho-visuals and common goal of quarks is smallest footprint possible. (First Quark was Skjull, full-length horror movie of 98 MB). Quarks have been beaten to death since their arrival here and praised and pooped upon to unimaginable extent."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-13T15:04Z,"May I ask if you are going to do any more Hawaii Five-0, or is it over for the season?  I can't watch it on regular network on regular basis."
,Ataractic,2011-03-13T15:52Z,"Thanks for uploading the files in the weekly pack, sir."
,WooZism,2011-03-14T02:56Z,Alright will do and a bonus thank you for the added effort I'll do my best to avoid missing anything in the future to keep your workload down !D
