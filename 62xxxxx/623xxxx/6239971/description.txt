          A look at the period of time musician John Lennon and his
   family spent living in New York City during the 1970s.

          *Left at 29 fps due to lots of archive footage that didnt
           didn't need IVTC. Hybrid source and no subs on disc.
           on another note imdb seems to have 2 links - 2010 and 2011
           with 2010 having more information so went with that.

                         Big up all scene massive!
