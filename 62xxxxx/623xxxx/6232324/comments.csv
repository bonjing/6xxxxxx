There is a series of events related to it.

I am not trying to get traffic. Just attention to what happened so this isn't forgotten.
I explain myself better in my stories than I do here.

I would like peole to see that my writing there isn't as bad as it is here.

It is simply wintersbutterfly on Blogspot

It for some reason doesn't respond in Google searches."

I live in an apartment for people with disablities who cannot afford other housing.It is independent apartments. Today a friend met me in the hall and gave me a pepsi and I said to my other friend, ""If the world was like the people who live here..it would be a nice place then."" In these people who have so little to give and understand so very much.
I have lived her for close to 15 years now. They know. I have never had to have the police come here once for me. Ever. And I take care of people here as they take care of each other. Sometimes this world is beyond me, in its silence.
In its culpability"
