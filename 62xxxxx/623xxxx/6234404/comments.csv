,claudefrog,2011-08-10T03:24Z,i cant add them to itunes??? i can play them fine with vlc media player but it wont go onto itunes or even when i click import in the library it wont happen. ???
,Zoombinis,2011-08-13T06:09Z,You can't reed them with itune and it's normal. itune can't reed Flac (witch is the best quality) you have to convert it into mp3 with a converte. just enter flac to mp3 converter in google.
,XxM24Ty,2011-08-22T06:50Z,"Convert Flac to Wav files with this PRO program which is free for NOW (normally cost $24, but they give you the serial when you click purchase) -http://www.koyotesoft.com

After you convert Flac to wave I like to burn an audio CD with Nero, next I rip with Itunes in 320kbps AAC- The audio CD is normally recognized by the music network and Itunes will populate the song titles automatically (PeerBlock users- HTTP must be OFF for Itunes to get song names) -It's very easy to do.

Omg no need to burn the cd!
Just make an image and mount the image with something like daemon tools lite.
