[T],headdock,2011-03-12T14:01Z,"I just noticed there is no sound in the CD3 folder. I dunno why that is, but if you want to download this torrent, deselect CD3 folder. Its a waist of time downloading that folder.
Sorry for that and the worst thing is..... I have no copy of that 3rd CD."

[T],headdock,2011-03-13T11:32Z,"Hiya loellah,

thnx for your reply. Yeah it`s shitty that the 3rd cd misses the audio. I have no clue how that happend.
I try to check everything b4 I upload the torrent, but unfortunately I overlooked this enoying error. My bad."
