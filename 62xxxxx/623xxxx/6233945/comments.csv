,emkemannen,2011-05-09T16:43Z,"doesn't work..what am I doing wrong? It says it's recorded, but when I look in folder where it should have been saved it isn't there.."
,(WCP)poetin,2011-05-21T08:29Z,I have the same problem...
,anima88,2011-05-28T19:28Z,"Works on my win7 64bit.
What this program does is recording ALL sounds coming from your computer, even your incoming msn messages and system sounds. It also copies the artist and title of the song currently playing on spotify into the filename. Better turn off other programs and record with this while you sleep.
I currently use this program to record radio & skype conversations, while playing some 70minute long mix or whatever on mute, then later i edit the filename to what im really playing."

,sebas158,2011-06-27T00:53Z,anyone else having the problem with the error 'launcher.exe is not working'?
,st0ra,2011-06-27T18:48Z,"remember to use the ""stereo-mix"" not the mic""

emkemannen:

try starting the program as administrator (right clich, run as administrator)

2. Remember to set the folder to save the mp3's in"
,sebas158,2011-07-03T02:38Z,"can't run anymore, because it updated to 3.0.

I'd love you if you upload the new spotify for us :D"
