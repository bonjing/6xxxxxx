Peace :)"
[T],raidy,2011-03-12T08:23Z,"Retail means that the cd is a retail copy. As in, purchased in the store. It's not a demo copy or pre-release for radio stations. I am one of the rippers. HHI is Happy Hacker Industries; an audio/video ripping group. Scene quality but without the scene l33t ego crap. :)
