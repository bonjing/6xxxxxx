,ghexsel,2011-03-12T06:19Z,"ahhh the fallacy of the ""greater than"" is so broken.  If a house needs an engineer to be built, and humans need a god to built, then allah must need another god to build it, ad infinitum.  

The Universe doesn't need a god, it is consistent and beautiful as it is.  The idea of allah just creates inconsistencies.
