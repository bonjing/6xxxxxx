I had never heard of Marc before his appearance in the latest Conan.
After that, being a stand up comedy fan i looked up his work.
I see a lot of myself in him and many of his guests and his podcast has helped me many times.
If you liked any of the premium episodes, buy them.

Out of respect for his work, i will remove premium episodes if any financial harm is caused.

This is a compilation of premium and mostly free episodes i find most interesting, content or guest wise.

- Respect!
