Developer drizzt has officially released fuckPsn v0.6.
Now if youâ€™ve been using what you believe
to be 0.6, you should ask yourself: When did I download this?
Because if you downloaded fuckPsn
v0.6 before today it is probably not the official version from drizzt.
This Windows executable â€” by the way, Linux works too,
visit the source â€” acts as a DNS and
SSL Proxy server getting you back on PSN by using your PC as an intermediary.
Requests from the
PS3 are sent to your PC and certain data is manipulated and forwarded along to PSN.
Can Sony
detect this hack? Well, perhaps â€¦ version 0.6 does take an extra precautionary step by using an
empty console ID.
