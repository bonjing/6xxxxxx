,CubanDoucheBag,2011-03-14T12:30Z,does it have an album cover for iphones?
,SoftWarez,2011-03-14T16:49Z,"nah, but you can add it by yourself.. just go to Google.Com and download .jpeg file of the cover and go to iTunes and then add it. Piece of cake :)"

Thanks for sharing though, looking for a wav or flac version."
