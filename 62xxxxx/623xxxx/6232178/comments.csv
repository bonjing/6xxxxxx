,YeOldeSnake,2011-03-10T20:08Z,"AiTD isn't like resident evil , resident evil is like AiTD"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-10T20:48Z,"re was first, therefor it's like resident evil. plus re is slighlt better. maybe aitd 4 is decent but tbh i didn't care for it much my first time playing."
,putzie,2011-03-28T10:48Z,"Actually, the original AitD game came out in 1992, while RE1 didn't come out until 1996.
So RE is like AitD.
Just saying.

Anyways, thanks for the upload.
Works fine for me."

,Labifalls,2011-05-23T01:09Z,Alone in the Dark was the first survival horror game and inspired games like Resident Evil etc.
,piggiihf,2011-07-30T17:19Z,Alone In The Dark > Resident Evil.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-11-29T00:21Z,"re = better, better story, better setup, better enemies, bosses, better gameplay, better everything.... alone in the dark came out first but is far less popular and the fact it was out first doesnt make it better :)

both are good games though. more ppl know resident evil so putting ""like resident evil"" makes more since cause more ppl will understand"
,gellis2010,2012-01-18T18:57Z,"Taken from a website:

""Anyone who has played the Resident Evil or other modern ""survival horror"" games should really take a look at Alone in the Dark. It turns out, as many of you probably already know/remember, the basic mechanics used in Resident Evil were pioneered about ten years ago by Alone in the Dark.""

thats all he was getting at i think.

 thanks for this fuctupunk. Nice to go back and see what i wasted most of my time on :)"
