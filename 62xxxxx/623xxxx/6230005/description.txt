Comments :
Ray Bradstone (Levesque) is the best wheel man in the business, but he is
determined to go straight and be the best parent he can be to his daughter,
Sally (Winter), and make amends with his ex-wife, Lynne (Gish). As Ray
struggles to find honest work, his old bank-robbing crew, led by Phillip
Larue (Corrigan), offers him one last job. He agrees at first, but changes
his mind at the last second leaving the crew without a driver. Ray decides
instead to serve as a chaperone for Sally's school field trip. When the
robbery goes awry, Larue blames Ray and chases the school bus all the way to
the Museum of Natural History in New Orleans. Ray must deal with Larue, while
supervising Sally's class on what becomes one of the craziest school trips
ever.
