|             Discription             |
|                                     |
| - WinRAR is a powerful compression  |
| tool with many integrated           |
| additional functions to help you    |
| organize your compressed archives.  |
|                                     |
| - WinRAR puts you ahead of the      |
| crowd when it comes to compression. |
| By consistently creating smaller    |
| archives, WinRAR is often faster    |
| than the competition. This will     |
| save you disc space, transmission   |
| costs AND valuable working time as  |
| well.                               |
|                                     |
| - WinRAR supports all popular       |
| compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, |
| ARJ, LZH, ACE, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, |
| BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).                |
|                                     |
| - WinRAR is ideal for multimedia    |
| files. WinRAR automatically         |
| recognizes and selects the best     |
| compression method. The special     |
| compression algorithm compresses    |
| multimedia files, executables and   |
| object libraries particularly well. |
|                                     |
| - WinRAR allows you to split        |
| archives into separate volumes      |
| easily, making it possible to save  |
| them on several disks for example.  |
|                                     |
| - WinRAR is also ideal, if you are  |
| sending data through the web. Its   |
| 128 bit password encryption and its |
| authenticated signature technology  |
| will give you the peace of mind you |
| have been looking for.              |
|                                     |
