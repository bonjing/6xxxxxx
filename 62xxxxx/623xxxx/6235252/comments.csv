Thanks for your reply. Worked fine. Nice weekend. bye"
,IRULE010,2011-03-14T12:21Z,"Sorry to be a pain but can someone clarify how you use the key please. I've installed WinRAR. By 'drag it in' I'm not sure if you mean into the shortcut or open the program and drop it in there, so I tried both. It just says there is an error and that WinRAR doesn't support the file type. Am I doing something wrong?

Many thanks."
,rayk64,2011-03-15T23:05Z,"@IRULE010: copy, or drag the key file to ""c:\program files\winrar"" folder"
,_-D-O-W-_,2011-03-16T16:17Z,"There are 2 ways:

Start WinRAR and drag the rarreg.key into the window. WinRAR automatically places the file in the winRAR folder.

Or you can manually copy rarreg.key to the WinRAR folder.

In most cases the WinRAR folder is:
C:\Program Files\WinRAR\"

,Hidden04,2011-04-25T07:27Z,How do people seed illegal things without their internet providers shutting them down?
,donkerinternet,2011-04-26T21:14Z,Nice needed it in dutch so just go to winrar.nl or your language winrar website en download the version you need and use the key from here and works great!
,paulderby,2011-04-29T00:18Z,"Hidden04

Is Internet service providers shut down the internet of EVERYONE who did things illegally on the net, then they would not have many customers left!!!"
