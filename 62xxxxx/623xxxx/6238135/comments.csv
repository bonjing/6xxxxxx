,klipsch12,2011-03-12T22:38Z,"Just thought you might want to know...  Jesus wasnt born of a ""virgin"". A common misconception. The Hebrew word almah, ""meaning a young woman of marriageable age, was translated into Greek in the Septuagint as parthenos or 'virgin.' Had the Hebrew meant to say virgin it would have used bethulah, which means specifically a virgin.""  Just one of many examples of how the original stories and mythology based on heresay, on top of heresay, for hundreds of years  that was eventually written down to form what is known as ""the bible"" . I cannot fathom how anyone can dedicate thier lives to something based on loose translations from thousands of years ago. It is very sad indeed."
,Ukonkivi,2011-03-13T21:30Z,Please keep evangelizing and conspiracy theories out of Japanese tragedy upload video. It's disgusting.
,wetmouse,2011-03-13T22:44Z,"""You may be right but i bet he had a nice virgin ass, one that i know i would love to get my cock right up in there""

You are not alone, my friend. Most evangelical men are closeted Jesus fantasizers, including the uploader. "

now, i seriously have to ask, did you even bother to LOOK at any of them?  there are MANY fake videos, such as commercials and videos that only say to go to a website to view the video, was even some videos of people on a camping trip.  there are DOZENS of duplicate videos that are just different resolutions of the same feed.  there's also videos that are just people's youtube broadcasts of them talking about the earthquake.  there's quite a few videos which were made from people pointing a digital camera at a tv showing a news broadcast when those news broadcasts are already in the collection of videos.

i downloaded all three of your torrents totalling 219 videos.
after about an hour of work, i'm already down to 124 videos.
thats almost 100 videos that were fake or duplicate."
