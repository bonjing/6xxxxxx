With Departing, the RAA further refines the exuberant guitar work; intricate percussion; everything-on-the-table, earnest vocals; and infectious, keyboard-sprinkled arrangements that have won the adoration of critics and fans alike.

â€¨â€¨Though Departing is viewed by the band as a companion piece to their first album, the band has allowed itself to stretch out. As the main songwriter, Edenloff will bring a song or idea to the table for the band to take it apart and build it back up. â€œSince the songs tend to hinge on the interplay between the drums and the vocals/lead instrument it can sometimes take a lot of the time to find that fundamental core of the song before we can really move forward with it. Sometimes this might mean taking a song that was initially written on guitar and making it a keyboard song (i.e. "The Breakup", "Under the Knife" and "North Star") or taking a keyboard song and making it more of a guitar song (i.e. "Tornado '87")." says Edenloff.

â€¨â€¨Bringing closure to the exploration of themes of love, loss and leaving that began with Hometowns, Departing contains ten songs about growing up and moving on.
