In this boot CD are the most popular and useful tools anyone would ever need.
The best of the free software, the best of the commercial software, and it all
fits on one CD-R that's readable by any computer worth booting on. Not
everything can read a DVD, and USB booting is hit and miss at best.

It's been a long time. How have you been? Things have changed since we last
met... I got myself a corporate IT job, still doing computer repair on the
side. But being a side thing, kinda has its pros and cons. On one hand I don't
have constant first-hand experience using the disc anymore. On the other hand,
I can also take a step back and look at it from a designer's point of view...
how well does it work? What does it do good, what's bad, what could be done
better? How can I make this the [ULTIMATE BOOT CD] it claims to be?

This disc, a minor half-version revision, is the answer to those questions.
Scoured through every option, considered the usefulness of some tools, added
others, collaborated with users over Facebook, gutted some functions and built
others. A launcher here, a script there, and about 1,500 WIM captures. I
imagine I went through some 20 ISO re-burns, 150 virtual machine boots, 200 VHD
mount/unmounts... I can't even count how much time has been put into polishing
this thing. All for the love of making computer repair accessible to anyone
that wants it.

Of note... let's see here. Virtual Floppy enables you to mount images from your
USB stick to be used in a boot selection like MiniXP (for F6 SATA/RAID drivers)
or DR-DOS (BIOS flashing). VFD with file copy allows you to make a <1mb RAR file
accessible to DR-DOS or Hiren's DOS in a virtual floppy. Wireless drivers in
MiniXP along with improved Ethernet and storage support. Mini Linux provided by
RIP Linux. Bootable partition and imaging utilities provided by Acronis True
Image and EASEUS Partition Manager. Improved Memtest86+ with failsafe mode to
resolve startup hangs. Kon-Boot 1.1 is really v1.1 now, with support for 32-bit
and 64-bit Windows. Tons of new utilities in MiniXP with new launchers to
provide easier access. ERD 5.0 is integrated with MiniXP for offline system
restore and service/driver management, and Microsoft DaRT 6.5 (x86 and x64) are
added to support Windows Vista and 7. Antivirus scanning with real-time updates
is provided by DaRT 6.5's Standalone System Sweeper, and allows you to load
definitions to a USB stick for live updating.

This ain't yo mama's BartPE compilation.

Once you dive into this disc, you'll never need another boot CD.
