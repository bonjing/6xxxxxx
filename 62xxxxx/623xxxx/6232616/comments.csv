David Norris (Matt Damon) is a charismatic politician running for the United States Senate. In 2006, he loses his early lead and is rehearsing the concession speech in the hotel bathroom, where he meets a woman hiding in one of the stalls. Having overheard his speech, she encourages him to be more original and honest. Immediately attracted to each other, they kiss before being interrupted, and Norris leaves to make the speech. Inspired by the woman, Norris goes off script and makes an honest speech that is widely praised and makes him an early favorite for the 2010 Senate race."

,kidderxl5,2011-03-10T14:01Z,"This is a cam, compared to a dvdrip the quality is a4/v4"
[V],globeplus,2011-03-10T14:47Z,"To kidderxl5 : now it is proved : YOUÂ´RE CRAZY ! why ? because where you can watch any indication of a cam from the sample , please watch again and tell me if you donÂ´t start watching the movie with the normal introductions in a quiet and soft clean picture like the normal dvds , jesus why are always guys that decide for himselfs create ununcessary implications with the uploaders for no matter what reason ? You donÂ´t need to be like that to watch the movie files , just download them if you want thatÂ´s all , stop implicating without a motive . JUST STOP DOING THAT ! Thank you and understand once for all what a screener is ... i repeat basically is a nice copy maded from a VHS or DVD .

Cheers ."

,Intrazone,2011-03-10T22:38Z,"Confirmed Cam, not a screener.
A=5
V=4"
[V],globeplus,2011-03-10T22:52Z,"NEWS : i will stop indicating what type it is the movie file , the available original was worked by the dub plugins better as possible and that it is all that matters and if someone ask me what type it is i simply answer that i don´t want to generate discrepant opinions about the subject , ok ? All right , like this no ununcessary speculation ."
,blusniffer,2011-03-10T23:54Z,"Actually a screener is an advanced version of a movie and basically a pre-release copy which is sent to critics, producers, award ceremonies etc and should be at least 90-100% of the finished movie quality+ can easily be mistaken for being the actual dvd!
So guys any file thats either too dark/bright, a little blurry or needs touched up before watching is probably a good cam."
,blusniffer,2011-03-10T23:58Z,Film companies now even add serial numbers to the screeners so they can tell which employee's copy has been leaked to sites like PB ansd sue them for copyright!!! lol

,blusniffer,2011-07-30T13:32Z,"It's a cam guys, bone has the blu ray rip like hundreds of other quality uploaders!!!!"
