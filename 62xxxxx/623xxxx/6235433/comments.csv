,i_am_sid,2011-03-11T17:30Z,"@TwentyForty
Can you please encode

-------------The Descent (2005)--------------
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435625/

No BRrip available between 700 to 1000 MB. 
I know requests are on hold. But its my favorite movie and seeders from its one and only source are reducing. So im requesting it early. 
You can have the source now and encode it later when you will be accepting requests."
,froglog,2011-03-11T21:11Z,Thanks for Bloodrayne 2005
,silveroakleaf,2011-03-12T02:07Z,Damn...movies that only have 2 stars on IMDB...can't say 20-40 isn't an equal opportunity encoder!
,bender1110,2011-03-12T04:53Z,ha - yeah I find that movies between 2-6 stars are the worst - below 2 is unintentionally funny. Between 2-6 is just boring.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-12T07:11Z,Just read NOTE.
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-12T14:31Z,"Thanks... 

I think I might like this movie .. putting it on que now.

@bender1110 dont get blind by faith. sometimes well sometimes the rating dont  justify. I dont mean they dont. they do most of the time. but then sometimes they miss out. many times I dont like those 6-8 rating movies as well .. like chick flicks .. if I were to vote i vote then 2. but then people vote 10 and it balance out at 6, LOL so just chill. darling.

@CIA Spies
.. you got ""-"" at 9 now. Dont worry KBG is watching. all u ""-"" MF get a life.. Do something else, like Eat Live Move out of the Room.. or just Die."
