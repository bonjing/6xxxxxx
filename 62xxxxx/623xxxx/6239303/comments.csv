,slamminuk,2011-05-02T13:55Z,I'm guessing this is only for MN7 versions and not MN6 as I cannot get this to work?

,JackieDan,2011-06-07T22:31Z,"Very good! Works well.
Can we rely on more updates in the future? This would be great.

Thanks again."
,gribenson,2011-06-24T15:01Z,"It didnt work on my 2110 max, but then I found out you have to copy and replace the maps one by one. Do not replace the MapDrawer.nfs file. This will hang up your navigon. Try with one file at a time and remember what you did if something goes wrong. 
The maps can be be selected in ""show map"", ""options"", ""settings"", ""map"", use the """" to select the new card (2011). 
Hope this helps. âş"
