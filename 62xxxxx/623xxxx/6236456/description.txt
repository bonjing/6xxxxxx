                The Curtains.
                A new six-part comedy written and produced by Robert
                Popper, starring Tamsin Greig, Paul Ritter, Simon
                Bird and comedy newcomer Tom Rosenthal, plus special
                guest star Mark Heap. Friday Night Dinner is a truly
                original series about the Goodmans, a family who have
                made an art form of their eccentricities. In the
                third episode, Mum's excited about the new curtains,
                but the boys and Grandma think they're horrible. Mum
                is annoyed. Meanwhile, Dad drops Mum's beef casserole
                all over the kitchen floor. It looks disgusting. Dad
                scoops it back into the dish. The boys are not happy
                about their meal. Later, the argument about the
                curtains spreads, and Jonny leaves in a huff to go to
                the pub. Adam joins him. At home, Mum and Grandma are
                still not talking, so it rests with Adam to resolve
                the family argument. But can Adam save the day?
