The Australian Pink Floyd Show was the first Pink Floyd tribute band to tour in the UK all the way back in 1993.

The 'Aussie Floyd' received the ultimate endorsement in 1996, becoming the only Floyd tribute band to be asked to perform for a member of Pink Floyd - David Gilmour - at his 50th birthday celebrations in London.

This spectacular two and a half hour show returns to Manchester by popular demand in April 2008.
