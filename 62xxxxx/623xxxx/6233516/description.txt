Season 02 - Episode 09 : BUFFALO SCORES - 44:15

Buffalo scores the charter of a lifetime when they're asked to transport the Stanley Cup on a tour of the North. Cup fever spreads quickly around Buffalo, and for Mikey, what begins as an innocent love for this hockey icon soon becomes an obsession.
Meanwhile, a Transport Canada violation forces Joe to give up his licence for 10 days. He reluctantly looks for a captain to replace him on the passenger run he's flown for almost 30 years.
