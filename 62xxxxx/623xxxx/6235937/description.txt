This is a debian live-build of openbox,iceweasel and xchat.  I use emdebian to upgrade (in squeeze) and make the iso smaller.  I have now tried to include the linuxmint live-installer and although the dependencies installed the deb itself is in /usr/local/bin/ and I would appreciate any comments on how to successfully install it.  Smxi, sgfxi, gparted and inxi are installed.  I hope this works for lots of you.
