Japan's iconic giant lizard, the menacing Godzilla, returns for another bout -- but this time, he's up against forces much stronger and dangerous than he is: Mechagodzilla II, a robotic version of himself built by the United Nations after the Japanese government pleaded for help in dealing with its menacing monster. But Godzilla is bent on prevailing over his high-tech foes, which won't go down without an exhaustive and thorough fight.
