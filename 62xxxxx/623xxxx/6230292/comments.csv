,-TheFox,2011-04-17T13:53Z,"To much mods man.
And you have use'd ""SAMI"" don't use ""SAMI"" use ""IMG TOOLS"".
The mods is better when you use ""IMG""

I was unstalling everthing you had been mod'd in.
And there is some files missing becous of the SAMI mod installer.

The game was good yes.
But don't give the ""SAMP"" with the torrent, it will lead to non online(you need to installe it your self, follow the link if you need it "" http://www.sa-mp.com/download.php ""
And the that one the ""SAMP team, has create'd""

Good luck!"

,Ramonder,2011-06-05T10:10Z,"This game sucks. There are 10+ failure SAMI mods installed which totally ruin your game. And don't bother trying to uninstall those mods with SAMI since your game wont run annymore then.
STOP SEEDING"

Have fun!"
,pkbros70,2011-06-16T04:51Z,"The game has everything 100% downloaded and works completely.  It has a few car mods that have been uploaded using the 'San Andreas Mod Installer"" but they are for the better and work well with the game.  It has all of the audio that you want and i can't think of anything that this game does not have. 

I currently uploaded 1gb and i'm going to continue till its over 5gb."

Go to your Documents.  There will be a folder called ""GTA San Andreas User Files"" then go to ""User Tracks"" and then copy music over to that location.  Once you moved the files over you have to detect them while in the game under advanced audio options i think.  Just explore in the in-game audio options and you will come across it."
,Pero96,2011-06-18T18:08Z,"Fuck this shit...There is no multiplayer exe...

,Wolfach,2011-06-21T13:46Z,"@AbAmerican

Just one question, is there any way to remove those car mods? Otherwise superb upload!"
,TehPwnzerfaust,2011-06-21T18:15Z,Thanks for the virus!
,AbAmerican,2011-06-21T23:27Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD OR SEED THIS TORRENT FOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS

Pirates,

I've got some problems with this upload.
I strongly recommend stop seeding and downloading it.

On this moment people got problems with audio, carmods and multiplayer doesnt work.  Somehow, 75% of the time Multiplayer works,  so thats way to low ratio to keep the torrent up in the air. Im all gonna fix it


Im gonna fix it all in a few days, ill remake the torrent or just adjust this one, you'll hear from me later.

DONT SEED OR DOWNLOAD FOR THE NEXT 7DAYS PLEASE."
,Wolfach,2011-06-23T16:37Z,Does this mean you'll remove those carmods?

,AbAmerican,2011-07-11T21:15Z,"Fixed the mods, Samp Issues solved,  it HAS to work now.
After downloading do NOT i repeat, do NOT move it to another file or directory.  
Njoy GTA SA like it should be!"

,someuno,2012-03-24T20:24Z,"My recommendation: do NOT download.

 While the game downloads fast and works like a charm, with no need for any installment operations, it is filled with some mods that look like created by some socially awkward tweens. And the problem is, I'm not around that age anymore. (awh the good ol' days, how i miss them! *swallowing thick nostalgic bitterness*)

 I do recommend it though if there is nothing else that works, but otherwise the really juvenile mods just ruin the overall gameplay. 

(It even contains an unremoveable, cartoony chopper bike with a giant skull on it, that fills the entire countryside.)

I havnt bothered yet to check if it has got multiplayer. But choose as you wish!"
