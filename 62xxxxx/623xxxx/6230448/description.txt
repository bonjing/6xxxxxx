Yello has been chugging along consistently ever since their debut on Ralph Records with Solid Pleasure. They have been setting the standard for audio mixing and production ever since. This recording moves into some new territory for Yello with regard to composition, but the production is mind-boggling. They just keep getting better at producing sounds that vibrate holographically. This is a great recording for newcomers to the group. Lots of seductive high energy dance grooves and lots of different moods.....and a sense of humor! 

Known by most listeners for their 80's hit Oh Yeah this group has been making cool creative music for years and Pocket Universe is no exception. After a brief introduction about the big bang and aliens the cd launches into sci-fi dance club heaven. Dieter Meier's vocals blend with throbbing beats,quirky touches,catchy melodies all climaxing with the spastic heart attack inducing Resistor. Like most of Yello's music it's not quite normal but given all the bland dance tunes around nowadays that's a good thing.
