,DLSteve,2011-04-05T12:28Z,"20-40, I would like to say thank you for your diligent work, I'm sure the community appreciates it very much.

I would like to ask you a question tho, with your movies I seem to get a recurring problem, about 80% through I get a stuttering with the audio, and it then goes out of sinc, this usually makes watching the movie unpleasant.

""The Abyss"" stopped just after 2 hours and stalls there. ""

""The Town"" stutters almost at the end, then the audios gone.

I use the same setup as you, LED Tv with external HDD connected via USB.

Some advice would be appreciated. I would like to believe it is just me. Thank you twenty-fourty"
