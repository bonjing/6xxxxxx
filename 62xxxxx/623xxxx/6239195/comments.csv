Many didn't like the movie, but IMO, it's like Independence Day w/o all the overly dramatized gay acting.  Great story that represents the human will to survive.  Also similar to Black Hawk Down in that there is a shit load of shooting and dying"

It is not the B movie ""Battle OF Los Angeles""
And it is a good screener.

I'd say best cam i've seen in a while. Occasional russian subs aren't a problem.
Thanks the upload. :)"

,rhmum,2011-03-30T23:44Z,"getting annoyed with the ""check sample"" bullshit. am i the only one that noticed the sample is generally taken from the best part of the film? seriously, a sample isnt going to tell me if it gets unwatchable on dark scenes, or if 15 minutes of footage is missing, or if for 30 minutes some guy keeps getting up and down in front of the cam. im not being picky, i just dont want to waste my time. i think the question of the quality is entirely legitimate"
