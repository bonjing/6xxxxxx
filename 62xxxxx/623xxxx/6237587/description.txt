Every release of Ronnie Lynn Patterson is a major event. This rare bird does not
record very often, but each of his albums are a success.

Solo, trio for jazz or contemporary music, Patterson finds enthusiasm of his
pairs and media. Five years after Mississipi, outstanding album for piano trio,
Ronnie Lynn Patterson confirms with Freedom fighters that he made a perfect
synthesis of jazz afro-American inheritage and of European contemporary
tradition. With the significant collaboration of two major young French jazzmen,
Louis Moutin and StÃ©phane Kerecki, providing a mastered groove as well as a
strong pulse, he creates up to the last groove the trio form, king of the jazz.
