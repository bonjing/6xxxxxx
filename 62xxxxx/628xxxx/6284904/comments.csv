Progressive = You display every line (analog video had everything in lines so the vertical resolution terminology is a bit of a leftover from that era.) of the image in one go.

Interlaced = You display every second line. First pass starts at line 1 and then the second pass on line 2. A primitive and very basic form of compression. Only tradeoff is crappy image quality if you display moving pictures.

So it's 1080(p)rogressive, not 1080pixels. Ofc you could argue that there is 1080 pixels there and you would be right. But it would still be incorrect in that context.

Sorry about that, just had to get it out. Thanks for the upload. :-)"
