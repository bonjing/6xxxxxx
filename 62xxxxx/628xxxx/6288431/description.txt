This video is one of the most hard-hitting interviews that Ernst Zundel ever gave to one of his political enemies !!  A stunning interview addressing the centuries-old enmity between the Germans and the Jews...

The video is about 120 minutes long, with a introduction by Ernst Zundel explaining and showing just some of the many books in his possession (authored by Jews !) that he used in answering many of the questions presented to him in conjunction with this particular interview !!

The quality of the video is quite good (A9 / V8) when one takes into account that the master was made with the old style video cassette cameras that were affordable for that era...

After watching this incredibly well spoken and articulated interview.., then PASS IT ON in whatever way possible... !!!
