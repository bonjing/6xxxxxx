@kristafa here is a link http://www.microsoft.com/games/pc/age2.aspx
to run the game just run empires2.exe

@deccal05 im not sure why that is happening just google for some keys and if that doesnt work look for a different crack, this shouldnt happen as you are the only one it has happened to i would guess you are running windows vista/7?"
