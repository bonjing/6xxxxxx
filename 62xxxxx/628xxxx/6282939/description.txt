    3 men get stranded on an island. They are captured by this group of      
    people who turn out to be members of a group under the direction of      
    Karl Sr. and his son Karl Jr., who are the famous butcher/slashers       
    from the first two Violent Shit movies. Soon these three men and a       
    bunch of exiles are given a chance to run away from the group            
    members; unlike some others who are brutally murdered. However they      
    decide to fight back and a gory and violent battle ensues.
