,jmac85,2011-03-31T18:02Z,Thank you for this upload. I saw you mention it the other day and was curious whether I'd see it. I will seed at 200 KB/s until I get to 2.5:1.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-31T18:27Z,"@jmac85: That's why is upped. If you want to support this torrent, start to seed after, let say 48h. There is no point in seeding when I am present with 25440 kB/s, but later, when I free the slot."
