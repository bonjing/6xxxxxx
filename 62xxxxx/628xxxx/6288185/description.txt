What began as a one-off project among giants of traditional Celtic music has blossomed into a full-time endeavor for Patrick Street. No. 2 Patrick Street picks up where their debut left off, though this time the group feels a little more comfortable in their own skin. 

Accordion player Arty McGlynn and fiddler Kevin Burke have become a single unit, utilizing their instrumental wizardry on each and every song. Like agreeable siblings, they burn through "John Mckenna's Jig," "Hard by Seifin/Woodcock Hill," and Jackie Daly's own "Sweeney's Wheel" with a fervor that is awe-inspiring. Vocalist Andy Irvine provides the record's most memorable tune, "William Taylor." It's the tale of a woman who joins the British Navy in the guise of a man to rescue her betrothed, and features an infectious melody and strong playing (and singing) from the entire collective. Irvine also does a great reworking of Woody Guthrie's "Tom Joad," and offers up his own politically charged anthem with "Facing the Chair." Patrick Street, with their newfound confidence, have the potential to be a true force of nature within the burgeoning Celtic music scene, and the divine No.2 looks likely to pave the way for a third offering.
