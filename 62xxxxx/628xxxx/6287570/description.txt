*********

Back when the Earth was being overrun by glaciers, and animals were scurrying 
to save themselves from the upcoming Ice Age, a stupid sloth named Sid, a woolly 
mammoth named Manny, a saber-toothed tiger named Diego, and an acorn-loving 
saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat are forced to become unlikely heroes. The 
four reluctantly come together when they have to return a human child to its 
father while braving the deadly elements of the impending Ice Age.
