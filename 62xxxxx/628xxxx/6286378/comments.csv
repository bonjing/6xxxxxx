,Drop-22,2011-08-05T00:59Z,"Credit where credit is due: This is a remake of a French film called 'Cible ĂŠmouvante' with Jean Rochefort, Marie Trintignant and Guillaume Depardieu...I haven't seen the 2010 version. The 1993 version with Jean Rochefort as the assassin is superb...A surprising amount of French films, especially comedy, get remade for the anglo markets, yet the French are supposed to have no sense of humor.
