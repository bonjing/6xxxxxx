,TitanioVerde,2011-04-11T18:45Z,"Congratulations for your first torrent. Let me cordially correct you some points:

- Please, do not upload in .wav. Even for purists, this is a waste of weight and traffic. Music is usually distributed in MP3.
- If you want to give the audio in a pure and lossless quality, there are other options. A popular lossless format is ""FLAC"". You should find converters for this easily.
- More importantly: this is NOT the soundtrack of Radiant Historia. I know because I bought this limited edition, too. Please, name it ""Piano Selections"", as it appears in the cover, instead of ""Soundtrack"". I was looking for the real soundtrack that I can hear when playing Radiant Historia.
- Your tags are not working correctly. Try separating the words with commas.
- If you are going to maintain this torrent as it is, please keep as a seed during a lot of time, specially if there are few or none seeds.

Anyway, thank you for the share. There will always be people going to appreciate it a lot."
