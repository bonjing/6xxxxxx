This is a rip of the soundtrack from Radiant Historia, a recent RPG for the DS about time travel and choices. It is ripped directly from the CD that comes with the game.

This is my first time creating a torrent, and also my first time ripping from a CD. I hope the quality is okay, and if it isn't, I would appreciate an alternative method being posted.
