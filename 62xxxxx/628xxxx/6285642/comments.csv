1. Polynesian units can't embark themselves (not from the beginning, nor after optics discovered),
2. language changed from english to french (why?! I ask why?! I know it's beutiful language and stuff but cmon:), can change to diffrent language but not to english
I had skidrow7 patch installed and I can't find out what done wrong. Anybody else have problems with this dlc?"
