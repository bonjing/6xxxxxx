,yoeori,2011-03-29T22:42Z,TNX! i have all the episodes exept epp 20
,whmxtra,2011-04-19T09:14Z,"dude wtf, I started this dowloa hours ago and only to download to eps I missed, now hours lated I'm stuck at 67% even though I've uploaded more than twice that.

I don't mind sharing but when my dowload speed is 1.2kbps and my upload is 1204 kbps that's just wrong. I'll leave it for a bit cause I want to get some sleep but if I wake up tomorrow and it's the same way I' m switching to another torrent and site as I'm not waiting a week to download 2 files"
,DrevdW,2011-05-03T20:05Z,Why are some of the files so big? Usually the anime series are 175MiB per episode.
,VicCrew,2011-05-15T22:54Z,"@whmxtra : I'm sorry about your poor download speed, but I stopped seeding  after uploading 1 TB, so don't blame me.

@DrevdW : Some files are bigger than other, because the quality is signifcally better. These files are HD (720p)"
,Skittlz8D,2011-06-13T04:54Z,@ whmxtra...you can always limit ur upload availability.....if u don't wanna upload more than 40 kps/s then set it to that and check if that helps at all ur downloading speed....hopefully it works ^_^
,BobaFett_X1,2011-07-10T15:03Z,"Not all of the episodes are of the same quality. But most of them are between 320p and 480p along with one 720p episode > which makes it very watchable.
A-9
V-8 (overall quality and for such a small download, its reasonably good)
Many Thanks tot the uploader !"
,finisher489,2011-08-09T17:02Z,Nice!!! It's actually a pretty good TVRip compared to other Disney Channel/Nickelodeon ones. 
,xpandora197,2012-02-15T06:11Z,Love it!! is it possible if you can upload season 2? like in a set? I cant find it anywhere for download! (I dont have internet at home to watch it online) thanks!!
