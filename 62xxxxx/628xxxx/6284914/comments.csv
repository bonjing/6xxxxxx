[T],megadethmen,2011-04-22T15:35Z,you should download k lite mega codec pack then install it. most likely you need a codec ---
,tehteh123,2011-04-23T13:46Z,"You should of made it dual audio japanese and english. As much as i love the japanese version, i spend most of the time reading and dont get to see the video."

,kreem,2011-05-14T11:00Z,"Not working with Divx, VLC or Windows Media Player - Divx says needs additional Directshow filters.."

,Theshinji,2011-05-24T23:44Z,"As stated, the K Lite video codec pack for media player should allow it to cover the vast majority of video files. I got it years ago and haven't ever had trouble playing anything."

[T],megadethmen,2012-04-08T08:58Z,"leave vlc, use splash pro or media player classic. also remove one of the codec pack, only one at a time or they will mix up!!!"
,Crotana,2012-04-11T08:04Z,"2 files are currupt I think. I was actually trying to play those files, coz they got Dled first. Other files are wrkin properly. :D"
