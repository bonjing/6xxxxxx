Description......: For the first time on American television, we uncover the surprising connections between the United States and 
		   the Vatican, from America in its infancy to the Cold War and beyond. This is also the first time that American 
		   audiences get an intimate and revealing look on how Pope Benedict XVI lives, works and functions in his papal 
		   role. With specially granted permission, viewers experience a world rarely seen as we reveal Secret Access: 
		   The Vatican.

Release Notes....: There was a pretty even mix of film and NTSC video in this show with a little bit of PAL for some crappy stock
		   footage. I think missing frames are worse than dupe frames so I kept it at 29.97.
