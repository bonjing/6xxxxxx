        I would like to keep PS3/Xbox/standalones compatibility - therefore, 
        I need feedback from users of PS3/Xbox and different standalone 
        MP4 capable players and QuickTime users.
        Without feedback I cannot achieve wider compatibility.
        And most certainly, not from the thin air.
