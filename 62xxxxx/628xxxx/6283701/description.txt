Thank You for Arguing is your master class in the art of persuasion, taught by professors ranging from Bart Simpson to Winston Churchill. The time-tested secrets the book discloses include Ciceroâ€™s three-step strategy for moving an audience to actionNas well as Honest Abeâ€™s Shameless Trick of lowering an audienceâ€™s expectations by pretending to be unpolished. But itâ€™s also replete with contemporary techniques such as politiciansâ€™ use of â€œcodeâ€ language to appeal to specific groups and an eye-opening assortment of popular-culture dodges, including:

The Eddie Haskell Ploy
Eminemâ€™s Rules of Decorum
The Belushi Paradigm
Stalinâ€™s Timing Secret
The Yoda Technique

Whether youâ€™re an inveterate lover of language books or just want to win a lot more anger-free arguments on the page, at the podium, or over a beer, Thank You for Arguing is for you. Written by one of todayâ€™s most popular online language mavens, itâ€™s warm, witty, erudite, and truly enlightening. It not only teaches you how to recognize a paralipsis and a chiasmus when you hear them, but also how to wield such handy and persuasive weapons the next time you really, really want to get your own way.............
