This is a special edition of this in 1996 released album.

True X-Files lovers wil know of the existance of 'Scully's Theme' from Season 8. This very short track has never been released before officially. 'Scully's Theme' only lasts 1:33 mins. I made it a 9:08 mins. long version. My version is free from clipping. I put this track right before the first track of the album and I gave them all new track numbers. So 'Scully's Theme' is track number 1, the former track 1 is now track 2. and so on...

I have used Mp3Gain to normalize the volume at an average 89 db. The bitrate is 320 kbps. All tracks are properly tagged and the album cover is embedded in the mp3 files.


Enjoy...
