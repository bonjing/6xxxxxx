,tomerzz,2011-04-02T09:55Z,"stay away from this version of windows 7 ; i've installed it on  ""modern"" hardware (intel e8400, 4gb ram) with 2 not so modern pci cards - pci ide/raid controller connected to ide hd and sound blaster live value (both work fine under xp 64bit !)
both cards were not recognized. also, the driver found on microsoft's catalog website for the ide controller did not work and would not install! although it stated the exact  hardware id vendor from its hardware tab (ide\..........)
one thing i noticed about this ver, is the lack of aero interface. 
that's one dvd disc gone to hell..."

,cmonroy,2011-08-16T08:28Z,"Works perfect for me... Except that after updates (required to fix some nasty issues running on a VirtualPC 2007), it says the license will expire in a couple of days.

Any patch or way to activate it?

Great share, HobbitGamez!"
