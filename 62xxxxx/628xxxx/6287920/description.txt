Product Description
Any chess player can become better by harnessing the power of imagination. This fresh approach to problem-solving helps players make fewer mistakes and encourages independent and original thought. Even though much has been published on chess tactics, strategy, openings, and endings, few books have focused on training the brain to think and evaluate. The many examples of different moves provided here do just that, by emphasizing the benefits of logic and quick wit. Some of the new concepts, such as progressive and reciprocal thinking, aid in preventing unnecessary and foolish errorsâ€”and assure players of making winning choices.
