By the by, does anyone know how to remove subs from a .mkv please?

My samsung tv has a built in media player (dope, would definitely recommend) but when a .mkv has inbedded soft subs you can't switch them off.  Can on my comp in vlc but not on tv.

Any easy quick ideas?  Cheers!"

,gregersamsa,2011-04-02T11:02Z,"I'd say that anyony with a little skull next to their name is probably NOT spreading viruses or whatever.

But I'm sure that jeetepuuuuus, who hasn't uploaded a single torrent, has all the information and knowledge to make such a claim. Surely he's not just any sort of idiot that cries wolf everytime he gets a virus and wouldn't blame anyone and or everyone except himself for leaving his computer wide open to attacks. Nah..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte 

blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

PS: Feel free to copy and spread this to all torrents you download and upload, please!"
,tapper101,2011-04-03T00:12Z,"This is kind of hard to believe... not only do you upload the BluRay version before you upload the DvDrip - you're also doing it on April 1st. The torrent is also rated -2. I'm calling the joke. ^^

I'll take a look at it though. Perhaps I'll get a good laugh. Or perhaps.. it's real :) Let's hope so! Been waiting for this one for ages."

,rocknzac,2011-04-05T18:44Z,i have downloaded 5 different copies including this one and none of them work on my ps3.  about 20 to 30 min into the movie a message pops up and turns the audio off. havent figured out the problem completely yet but so far this is not a good copy.

,Delron41,2011-04-06T01:36Z,Yep. Wish I'd read the comments first. This is useless if you stream to PS3. That fucking Cinavia bullshit cuts the audio through most of the movie. Thanks for the upload though!

Cheesy crime partner comedy and really poor acting - don't expect Jacky Chan & Chris Tucker combo here. 

Cameron Diaz is old now but still looks fine :P

Yeah it's an action movie but no real fight scenes... just blowing up a lot of shit.  That's why $120 million budget.

Seriously, there are a lot of good movies out there.  This one is a complete waste of time even though it's free."
,john depp,2011-04-11T17:20Z,Oops I forgot to thank you extremezone.  Always grateful for your uploads and I know you don't make these movies that I didn't enjoy.  I blame directors for that :)
,phattsao,2011-04-11T19:16Z,"It's a pain in the ass, but there is a way to bypass Cinavia.  Basically, you play the movie until it pops up, then go to ""date/time settings"" and move the clock ahead one hour.  The movie will then play for another 20 mins before another Cinavia warning.  Repeat ad nauseum.  Or just watch it on your pc.  "
,john depp,2011-04-11T23:44Z,"Don't watch it on PS3 guys.  That stuff is for gaming and it's such a unreliable machine.  You will break that machine if you keep over using it.  

Cinavia can kiss my ass and just get a laptop with HDMI output under 400 bucks nowadays.  "

,Ichigo0Soul,2011-06-30T03:54Z,"@steelgurder1
You should probably just download a DVDRip instead of a BDRip. Most DVDRips are in AVI format and can play on the 360. Plus, the file size is a hell of a lot smaller."
