,spaz7,2012-05-07T07:35Z,Works Perfectly! People....your not supposed to click on GET THIS TORRENT next to that there is supposed to be a link in brackets (GET TORRENT FILE) if that's not there then pirate bay must have deleted the torrent. This happens its not his fault...if you want the game go to torrentz type wwe impact 2011 pc and pick the first one
