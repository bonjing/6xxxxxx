[V],twentyforty,2011-03-30T22:05Z,"@hardik_860 : It is advertised only, no one actually has it yet,  as Amazon.com sell in advance, very often books or Blu-ray are advertised before actual release.

We wait for someone to actually buy disk and gave for public use. I do not have money to buy that disk.

@Fangular : Go  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1809362/  and follow the links."
