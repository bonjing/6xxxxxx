,LOLiverPB,2011-04-01T21:06Z,"Inspiron, first of all, I made a music video and it finished today, tiestos - I feel it in my bones, check it out if u have time plz

Its called Pure Nano Rythm on youtube.

Second. Do you know how many tracks I used becuse of you, I made 19 world of warcraft movies with basically 75% of all tracks used was possible only becuse u are able to split and upload them. For example on one movie I have uploaded on my youtube channel, a movie called ""Fire and frost"" at the 8:50 mark that track was downloaded from you and I was able to use it becuse of you.

So the things you do is amazing, for me its gold, its almost as amazing as all these good tracks that are made. So yes, your doing a great job."
