You have to have .NET framework installed if you want to use the activator. Just use windows update and install everything related to .NET framework. That should solve your problem.

What do you mean ""are the files still here""?

,matthew_rs7,2011-04-21T20:40Z,"I have a Question.

I have a legit box copy of Mass Effect 2 that I purchased. If I download this DLC pack and use it, will it work with my copy? Will my CD key get screwed over?"
,tyrune18,2011-04-22T09:18Z,"@ED1XCD
It appears that people with certain specific internet connections experience this problem (you being one of them). In my search for a solution I stumbled upon a different DLC activator that might solve this problem. You can download it here: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6334605/Mass_Effect_2_alternate_activator_(DLC)

Whether or not it works I cannot say, because I have not encountered the internet connection problem myself...

@matthew_rs7
I'm afraid I can't be sure. I suggest you try installing the DLCs and running the activator (perform only steps 7 & 8). I suppose you do not need the crack because your copy is legit. Other than using the crack I see no reason why installing the DLCs would screw up your CD key."

,tyrune18,2011-04-29T01:08Z,"@goree2010
Since your copy of ME2 is legit, I suggest you first try installing the DLCs without applying the crack. If that doesn't work you can always apply the crack anyway. However, in any case you will still need to use the activator to authorize the DLCs. As far as I know, none of these actions will corrupt your copy of ME2. Just make sure you make a backup of the main executable before overwriting it with the crack just to be sure.

@DeepbloodEclipse
I wish I could add the link of the second activator in the description, however, for some reason the piratebay wonĂÂ´t allow me to edit my torrents (it keeps saying that ""EDIT is temporarily disabled"" for some reason). So as far as the link goes, the comments section will have to suffice (see one of my earlier comments)...

,tyrune18,2011-05-19T18:02Z,"@Notere
Is your operating system 64 bit? If so, try installing the DLCs using 32 bit compatibility mode...
The files in this torrent are all unmodified and thus original. The files are therefore not the problem, so it has to be your system..."
,Notere,2011-05-20T03:06Z,"Ah, true. It is 64 bit. So I will try reinstalling all my DLCs as such. "

,tyrune18,2011-05-21T09:57Z,"@Notere
You shouldn't actually do it like that. Try right clicking the DLC executable and selecting 'properties'. Now go to the tab 'compatibility' and enable 'run this program in compatibility mode for:'. In the drop down menu just select 'windows vista 32 bit' or something like that. Running the installation files in this mode should prevent you from getting the corrupted file message. If it doesn't work immediately just try any of the other compatibility modes listed in the drop down menu until it works. You should be able to get it working this way. Let me know how it goes..."
,Notere,2011-05-31T11:29Z,"Well, bright side (after a bit of personal neglect to the thread) is that I got kasumi to work. The normandy crash site and terminus armor/weapon aren't, however. There is no ""windows vista/7 32 bit option. It's ""windows vista/VistaSP1/SP2"". Same for XP versions. And only one windows 7 (general) option. I got kasumi to work hammering at it with the XP options until it stopped being dumb, but the others just won't do it. They refy00000se to work at all. Even running the giveme2entitlements in an alternate compat mode doesn't open them. "

I bought the game retail so I didn't crack it. The problem I did have was installing the DLC then having it crash on loading the part of the game involving it. Usually a reinstall of the individual DLC file  followed by running the activator. For some reason I can't run these in compatibility mode. The OS selector is stuck on ""Windows Vista"". Regardless, all of these DLCs seemed to function. After a few days, though, the game started crashing before the intro splash screens. It would leave a collapsed window and then lock up. I can't figure out how to get around that one. "
,cyberisto,2011-06-12T05:44Z,"Ok, I got what's up. It was running it as ""vista"" in compatibility mode because Win7 switched it when I installed using ""recommended settings"".

Extract the .rar file from the exe with ""Universal Extractor"" (google it)

after ""UE"" does the extraction. 
find the folder that has the .rar and uncompress with winrar or 7 zip (i got like 3 files errors while extracting), I didnt care and proceed anyway.

look into the extracted folder for the DLC_[name]_[name] folder, which has a [CookedPC] and [Movies] folder
Copy that folder into ME2/biogame/DLC
run the giveme2entitlements_v2.exe and replace the Masseffect.exe with the cracked one

Again Thanks!!

I have never uploaded a Torrent before & would like some help please, WHICH I would believe be of benefit to all that have had problems getting the DLC content to work!!!!

After & I say many hours off screwing around with downlods & stuff, reading every forum I could get my eyes too I finally have got everything to work!!!! Again everything to work!!!!

Yes ""Bring Down The Sky""
Yes ""Pinnacle Station"" Which I might just say here that I have the Name ""Pinnacle Station"" in my DLC Content box when I access it!!!! Wicked :)

No ERRORS Galaxy Map, Overheating,Saves etc etc To be honest Iv thrashed the Game flawlessly several times now to level 60 & have imported it to ME2 no problems at all :-)

Im working on the ME2 & DLC install process at the moment as I have for this one!!!!

Iv written a Install guide for me & for even a first user to understand as I might be a Qualified Tech but others arn't Aye :)

 So If anyone is interested in helping me sort out my first torrent & take it off my hands as I can't hoste it from here then email me Slider-69-@hotmail.com

 Many Thanks to all the tirless work & effort the uploaders do to bring us which I have found for the most part excellent torrents (for the ones I trust :))

!!!!!!ERRORS!!!!!!
------------------

Note:- For people who are receiving the following error message ""Could not get adapter entropy"" or,
the giveme2entitlements/MassEffect2DLCUnlocker keeps crashing,
you should have a LAN card on your PC that is enabled but not plugged in,
& block the mass effect files in your firewall. 

You can't have your onboard enbabled either!!!
The DLCs and crack exes worked fine right after I installed a LAN card.



Alternate Loader (which is included in the install folder but can be found here)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found this program on google giving me an alternative in activating Mass Effect's DLC's because the program
 ""giveme2entitlements_v2.exe"" doesn't work for me as for a internet connection issue.
It allows the user to select the network they currently use as in my case.

This program is not mine!

Instruction: (What I did)

1.)Download the program (in google if you don't trust this)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6334605/Mass_Effect_2_alternate_activator_(DLC)

2.)open and then select your network (It will create a file named ""BioPersistentEntitlementCache"" 
located in my case in *...\User\Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect 2\BIOGame\Config\...)

3.)done

P.S. If you used the program ""giveme2entitlements_v2.exe prior into using this,do delete the file 
""BioPersistentEntitlementCache"" first



Authentication errors 
---------------------

Can be fixed with the above.
