This is the final updated version (date: 29 March 2011) of my previous torrent "Mass Effect 2 DLC Pack 19-01-2011 [tyrune18]". BioWare has announced that from this point on no new ME2 DLCs will be released anymore, so I'm afraid this is it as far as Mass Effect 2 goes. So this torrent contains all DLCs that have been and ever will be released for ME2.

All the DLC files in this torrent are original and not modified in any way, so they should work. 
If you want to play Mass Effect 2 with all the downloadable content installed just follow these instructions to the letter in the indicated order:

1.  Install Mass Effect 2
2.  Apply the patch in order to update the game to version 1.02
3.  Copy the crack to the "Mass Effect 2/Binaries" folder and overwrite the existing file
4.  Start the game
5.  Go to "Extras - Options - Online" in order to turn off the "Upload Gameplay Feedback" and the "Auto Login to EA Online" options (set to "No")
6.  Exit the game
7.  Install the DLCs (22 in total):
	- ME2_AegisPack
	- ME2_AltAppearance1-1
	- ME2_AltAppearance2
	- ME2_Arrival
	- ME2_BloodDragon
	- ME2_CerberusArc
	- ME2_CerberusWpnArmor
	- ME2_Collectors
	- ME2_EqualizerPack
	- ME2_FirepowerPack
	- ME2_Hammerhead
	- ME2_Incisor
	- ME2_Inferno
	- ME2_Kasumi
	- ME2_NormandyCrash
	- ME2_Overlord
	- ME2_ReconHood
	- ME2_Sentry
	- ME2_ShadowBroker
	- ME2_Terminus
	- ME2_UmbraVisor
	- ME2_Zaeed
8.  Run the file "giveme2entitlements_v2.exe" to activate the newly installed DLCs
9.  Repeat step 3 just to be sure (some DLCs also install the 1.02 patch possibly overwriting the crack copied in step 3)
10.  Play the game with all 22 DLCs installed

If a DLC file has become corrupted or if it doesn't work properly for whatever reason, you can redownload it directly from Bioware's server. You do this by copying the following URL into the address bar of your internet browser:
 
http://static.cdn.ea.com/bioware/u/f/eagames/bioware/masseffect2/ME2_DLC/FILENAME.exe

In this URL, replace "FILENAME" with the DLC name as stated under step 7 of the aforementioned instructions. For example, if you want to redownload the "Alternate Appearance Pack" you copy the following URL into your internet browser:
 
http://static.cdn.ea.com/bioware/u/f/eagames/bioware/masseffect2/ME2_DLC/ME2_AltAppearance1-1.exe

Should you still encounter problems, I advice you to read the comments sections of this and other "Mass Effect 2 DLC" torrents on The Pirate Bay, because they contain a lot of information and possible solutions.

Enjoy!
