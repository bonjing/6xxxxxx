Synopsis: I use this frequently, as i type without looking. Tiny SpellChecker is
extremely light, unobtrusive, customizable, and portable. This works right from
the start without any modifications. You can add words to the dictionary, you 
can adjust it to the way you work. The interface is user-friendly. Tiny 
SpellChecker is compatible with any Window/App that you type on.
