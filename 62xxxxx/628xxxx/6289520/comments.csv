,lozenges,2011-04-07T01:32Z,I downloaded and not a movie... its an interview with the behind voice actors...
,Nazher,2011-04-09T16:34Z,"@Lozenges, now that was pointing out the obvious you know.

If you'd read the info you should have seen the plot:
""Edith Bowman travels to Brazil ahead of the release of animated adventure Rio where she meets cast members including Jesse Eisenberg, Jamie Foxx and Anne Hathaway."""
,cro508,2011-04-11T15:47Z,"@Nazher you don't have to read it, you just look at the size (191.33MB) and there you go. a movie should be between 700 and 1300MB. anything less is probably something else/fake."
,falconers,2011-04-12T10:30Z,This can not be the film Rio if it runs for 20 min. Why put this rubbish up if you don't describe it properly.
,TB_71x21,2011-04-24T10:54Z,Does anyone have the password for Fusion's Rio d/l? It directs you to a website that no longer exists. F***ing a55hole c*nt could tell you this BEFORE you d/l it......f***ing useless c**t.
