about the facebook fan page:
the page got enough fans to acquire a shorten desired url..
(example: faceeebuk.com/StyLishSaLH)
but.. that specific url... isnt available as it's already been used for a user profile...

... so.. any suggestions for a alternative url name ???

... i'd sayy...
faceebuk.com/StyLishSaLHoffical
faceebuk.com/StyLishSaLHpage
faceebuk.com/SaLHtheStyLish
faceebuk.com/StyLish  "
