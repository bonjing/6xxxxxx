From the Infowars web site ::


Alex welcomes to the show tattoo artist Levi Smith of The Jade Monkey Tattoo in Phoenix, Arizona, who has been tattooing quick response codes -- QR codes, which is similar to barcodes -- that can be scanned by smartphones and lead to Facebook web pages. 


Alex also talks with trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, and business consultant Gerald Celente, and Paul Craig Roberts, the economist and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan Administration. 


Alex covers the latest on the Fukushima nuclear meltdown and other important news.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
