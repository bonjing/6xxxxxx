,SingleSanctuary,2012-06-04T07:51Z,"I like how all of these uploads say 1080p and 720p but aren't even what they say. Especially the uploads with like 10gb that says ""1080p AAC"". They're not even 480p for crying out loud! I'll probably end up getting this one, though. I'll let you people know how good the quality is on a 52 inch tv with hdmi connection."
,SingleSanctuary,2012-06-04T07:59Z,"Actually, I'm an idiot. All of these uploads are 480p. Although, they're definitely not what they say they are. If you want actual 720p your best bet is to get the 1080p uploads. At least then, they have 720p (it's not 1080p, look at the damn info--Video resolution). Technically, this upload shouldn't be in the Highres section but what can you do. "
