ebootFIX.exe

This tool processes whole game folders;
drag & drop the folder of whatever PS3 game, the parent
folder holding all the game files and sub-folders onto
this executable and after it crunches away
youâ€™ll be left with two new folders: [NPDRM] and [RETAIL].
Whatâ€™s the diff? From _readme.txt:
[NPDRM] â€“ content ready to be installed as PSN-style XMB game:
You will find two PKG files in the folder.
The tool will decrypt and sign all executables (EBOOT.BIN and
other .self / .sprx files) to make them compatible with lower firmware versions.
Follow the generated INSTRUCTIONS in [NPDRM] folder.
[RETAIL] â€“ all files which you can replace in your original backup copy to play the
game via a Game Manager.

ebootMOD.exe

This one takes a single file â€” drag & drop an
EBOOT.BIN or a .self or .sprx â€” and itâ€™ll result in a
decrypted and signed file that is again
compatible with lower firmware versions.
Of course you can find more info in â€œ_readme.txtâ€ and at the source.
Also included is a version of multiMAN v1.16.11;
a test build that properly handles sprx files when using â€œshadow copy.â€
