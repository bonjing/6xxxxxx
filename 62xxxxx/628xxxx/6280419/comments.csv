,HellsGayngel,2011-03-29T23:37Z,I don't think it's the same source. For one the files are different sizes...
,cri0s,2011-03-30T00:46Z,"Far better quality than the other (dvdrip) version. 
It's not as dark as the other version and the sound is better as well.

However, it's not a perfect copy, since there seems to be constant flicker. 

Nonetheless, the best rip so far.

,derrynj,2011-04-02T01:05Z,"i would still call this < dvdrip quality. Seriously, how can you fuck up a BRRip? Leave the fucking thing in H.264, let the people who need H.262 have the DVDRip"
,Benishdamenish,2011-04-03T03:17Z,"lol, derrynj speaks the truth"
,captcont,2011-04-03T18:56Z,My download speed keeps going up to 300kb/s and then suddenly dropping right down to 0. Anyone know what's going on?
,DirtyLogic,2011-04-03T19:35Z,"Personally I wonder why they would list this as a BRRip.  It might have a BR source, but the res is 720x304???  Maybe someone should tell these guys that 720p means 1280x720...."
,Sham_unbeatable,2011-04-04T05:57Z,no seeders please help guys

,figure6,2011-04-09T21:03Z,"I'd say this is the best copy so far out there.
It's in dolby 5.1 aswell. My scores reflect the fact that it's not the real deal.. ie DVDRip even though it may say it is.

Please go to TigerDirect, Newegg, or Fry's Electronics and build your own inte/nvidia mini-itx Home Theater PC. Don't believe the hype of the ION2. Use dedicated video.

,hrvatskipirat,2011-08-08T18:30Z,"I've downloaded loads of 720p videos and they made my PC run slow. In this case, the quality is the most you can expect from a torrent. It runs very smoothly on older PCs and the quality is REALLY loads better than in the screenshots. Download highly reccomended to all HP fans! Thanks, extremezone!"
,watbol,2011-10-29T08:58Z,"Perfect BRRip quality!
