,The77s,2011-03-30T23:36Z,"It's a decent game guys, although I serverly disagree with the Devs saying it's ""The most realistic Racer ever"" (They've clearly never heard of rFactor or GTR) because it's not realistic at all, really, the Physics don't seem to be that much different from the first, which wasn't realistic.

Another problem is I think they actually downgraded the graphics, I'm running it at Full with 1920x1200, 2xAA, 8xAF (Which is what I run NFS-Shift at) and it looks worse than there first game.

I though it might just be PC, so I looked up some Console gameplay and it looks the same on Consoles, it might be an improvement for Consoles maybe, but it looks terrible compared to the first one on PC.

Maybe they'll release a Patch which will add better graphics? Doubt it.

They do need a Patch, though, I get 60FPS solid on NFS-Shift Patched, but on this I get about 40 - 50FPS, so they need to do what they done with NFS-Shift and release a Patch to improve performance for NFS-Shift 2.

Over all, a good game, nothing particularly new and improved from the first (If anything, downgraded, because of the graphics) but it's still a decent game, NFS-Shift Series is fun, so it's always worth a play, but in its current condition, I'd rather stick to NFS-Shift, that is, until they Patch it, if they Patch it, rather."
,rolosdad,2011-03-31T00:23Z,"coolman 5659,,  you download crack separate..AITB got a crack on here for it..dont know wat u mean where to extract groups??? just mount it with deamon tools and install. ..when it asks to activate say ok then cancel on next sceen then apply crack when its installed.;)"
,rollydesign,2011-03-31T00:23Z,Which version is this the US or EU and does it have the 900 deegre animated steering?
,rolosdad,2011-03-31T00:28Z,"the 77...wouldnt say it looks worse than shift..just not any better..im enjoying it ,but its definatly not a simulation..EA cant get away from there arcade roots, but i think thats a good thing really. havnt got the time i used to have to devote to learning every corner like i did in gran turismo,s..and fortza..good game i think..and best of all its free.;).."
,The77s,2011-03-31T01:42Z,"@rolosdad

It is worse, I went ahead and took some Pictures and Movies using FRAPS on the same settings on both games, Need for Speed - Shift does look better, I've also Googled it and many others are agreeing that the graphics have actually been downgraded.

The gameplay is slightly better, but the graphics are slightly worse."
,The77s,2011-03-31T02:26Z,"Installation Guide -

1. Download Torrent.

2. Mount ISO (I use Power ISO).

3. Install game.

4. When prompted to Activate the game, choose Cancel and let it finish Installing.

5. Download a Crack (You can get one off Skidrow's Website)

6. Copy & Paste Crack into Need For Speed Shift 2 Unleashed Directory.

7. Play the game.


If anyone has any problems or didn't understand, say so, and I will try to help.

,bbzlov,2011-04-25T14:06Z,"Okay,

First the install was easy just extract the iso and remove the crack from the extracted folder. Mount the iso using Alcohol 120% or something. Go to my computer and open the iso that has been mounted and run AutoRun.exe and install. When it asks for a serial just press cancel and the installation will finish like normal. When the install has finished un-tick the box that says EaDownloader or whatever it's called. Press finish. Copy the contents of the crack folder that you removed from the extracted iso and put it in the shift2 install file in the c drive. Then go back to my computer and open up the mounted iso and click auto run. Also block the program from accessing the internet. The game worked perfect for me this way. Smooth game play and okay graphics but the actual game is a FUCKING PILE OF SHIT. I would recommend trying another game but +1 to AiTB for providing another good torrent :)"
