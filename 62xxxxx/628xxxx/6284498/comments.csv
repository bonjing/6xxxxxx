[T],honchorella31,2011-03-31T18:39Z,yeah the moie is dark but if u compare the screen shot from source and mine u will c i did lighten it a little but if u do it 2 much u spoil it after all it was ment 2 be a dark movie. but hey its 1080p under 4 gig and free if u dont like it download the source which is 11 gig or wait 4 the blu-ray n go n buy it.
,S111or,2011-03-31T19:03Z,"Sorry if I'v offended U.Never ment 2.
It's just that I go tused 2 get the very best quality from U, and as I can C, from your comment, that's exactly what U'v uploaded.~

Thanks again."
,hsn_kmr,2011-04-01T11:11Z,"Dear honchorella ,

I have few doubts , which I want you to clear from you :-
1. How are you able to upload a bluray rip even before the release of the original Bluray Disc ?
2. What should be the video bitrate of the Rip so that I can get Crystal clear picture on a 19 to 22 inches monitor ?
3. What is the Ideal Bitrate of a 720p Encode ?
4. Since this rip says ""1080p"" . Why is the Resolution 1920x800 ?
5. There are so many Bluray rips on the net for this movie , So which one would you prefer ?
6. I once downloaded Inception's Rip by secretmyth after seeing the screenshots which were very sharp and  had indepth Detail. But when I saw the movie it was not as sharp as the screenshots . Why ?
Please clear these Doubts . I would really be thankful to You . I am asking this all just because of Curiosity . My intention is not to offend any uploaders .

Thanking You 
God Bless You

[T],honchorella31,2011-04-01T16:11Z,"i will try and answer these the best way i can.

1. How are you able to upload a bluray rip even before the release of the original Bluray Disc ?
Pre release blu-rays.

2. What should be the video bitrate of the Rip so that I can get Crystal clear picture on a 19 to 22 inches monitor ?
depends on you resolution.

3. What is the Ideal Bitrate of a 720p Encode ?
its up 2 the encoder more bitrate better picture more bitrate bigger size.

4. Since this rip says ""1080p"" . Why is the Resolution 1920x800 ?
1920x800 is 1920x1080 but with the black bars cut off.

5. There are so many Bluray rips on the net for this movie , So which one would you prefer ?
mine haha. i have a hand full of trusted rippers i use 4 source - CHD, framstor and a few more.

6. I once downloaded Inception's Rip by secretmyth after seeing the screenshots which were very sharp and had indepth Detail. But when I saw the movie it was not as sharp as the screenshots . Why ?
screenshots can make the picture look better than wot it is sumtimes thats y there is a sample so u can check the playback quality.

hope this helps clear things up."

,rectan01,2011-04-17T18:59Z,"great guality picture and good sound as well. but this is not 1080p. maybe a little more than 720p possibly 1920x800. however this movie was very boring and drawn out.
v=9
a=9
m=6"
[T],honchorella31,2011-04-18T21:22Z,"1920 x 800 is 1080p with the black bars cut off top n bottom hence y u dont c any black bars on the screenshots. the black bars r then added by the media player of your choice or ps3, wdtvlive etc then that makes the movie 1920 x 1080. the black bars r cut 2 make more bitrate available for the encode of the picture and not black space of the bars."
