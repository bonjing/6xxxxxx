Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
         
Autodesk Simulation software, part of the Autodesk solution for Digital Prototyping, 
provides a range of mechanical simulation tools to help designers and engineers 
make decisions earlier in the design process. Support for multi-CAD environments 
and extensive finite element modeling tools help manufacturers study initial design 
intent and accurately predict product performance. Autodesk Simulation allows you 
to validate and optimize designs before manufacturingâ€”increasing efficiency, 
minimizing reliance on physical prototypes, reducing costs, and decreasing errors.
