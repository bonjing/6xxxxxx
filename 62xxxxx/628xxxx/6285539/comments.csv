Checked the .sfv file , even unrared my self and installed just fine. Can't think what seems to be problem that your download is corrupt , as all others is fine.."
,zappaz123,2011-04-03T10:24Z,"if original seeder has any corrupted files, it does'nt help to just replace the bad files.

They are allready out in circulation meaning any new downloader willl get bad data.

Only remedy is to make a new torrent, so a new clean circulation is created."
,zappaz123,2011-04-03T13:50Z,I get da error too - pls be a good boy and make fresh torrent.
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-04-03T14:30Z,Unrar only 1 .rar file with winrar . There should be no problems as i exstracted it my self. no errors. i will seed thouse again so mby someone who finished got it corrupt and now seeding to others the same corrupt files. 
,zappaz123,2011-04-03T18:45Z,"I have to be honest ;)

I got the mec.simul. 100%, removed it from uTorrent and right-click extract on the single .rar file. 

It gave error-msg on the iso just before end of extract. This it did twice.

Later i tried again - still on the single .rar, knowing that rar continues by itself to next.. and by surprise it finished without any errors

totally weird

maybe uTorrent still had it's claws on something though the DL was removed from uTorrent..."
,zoisdim,2011-05-07T04:22Z,"When i press the button for installation after extraction i get the message 
""Can't find setupUi.dll""
anybody has an idea whats that?"
