A musical about teens in love in the 50's! It's California, 1959 and greaser 
Danny Zuko and Australian Sandy Olsson are in love. They spend time at the beach,
but when they go back to school, what either of them don't know is that they both
now attend Rydell High. Danny's the leader of the T-Birds, a group of black-jacket 
greasers while Sandy hangs with the Pink Ladies, a group of pink-wearing girls 
led by Rizzo. When they clash at Rydell's first pep rally, Danny isn't the same 
Danny at the beach. They try to be like each other so they can be together.
