The group says:

It so happened that we made a new album. We got an idea about it two years ago, right after release of "The Book of Kings", but due to different reasons we've created and completed it just now. "The City of Men" has in itself all the grief and joy, all the fears and worries of recent years. Everything that surrounded us for these three years is now under the cover.
