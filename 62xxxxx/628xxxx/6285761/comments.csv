,noirehtagemot,2011-04-01T12:21Z,"No definition of economics is just ""wrong"", that is silly. On what basis do you disregard the one offered in favour of the one you link to? What makes the socialist definition so wrong? The fact that it is socialist? And what makes your definition so right? 

Really, it all depends of the context: the definition you quote is 100% true, within the context of a capitalist economy. That fact cannot be disputed.
But to use it within the context of a society that is admittedly non-capitalist is, again, silly; a different definition is needed there. You provide no reason that such a definition cannot be used in a society that rejects capitalism and its values, assuming, much like von Mises, petitio principii that capitalism is the only way to go.

There is also no ""slandering"" of von Mises here. His claims regarding practical rationality lack substance and are not properly argued for, and not even Hayek agreed with him on that part, citing it instead (very true!) epistemological reasons against centralisation."
,noirehtagemot,2011-04-01T12:42Z,"Furthermore, no one really took von Mises's claims that seriously until the collapse of the USSR, when suddenly people emerged claiming ""told you so!"", completely ignoring any of the million other possible reasons for the collapse.
I guarantee you no one considered even the centralised state capitalist deamon that was the USSR ""impossible"" at the height of the cold war.

Yet this torrent here has nothing to do with Communism or traditional socialism.
Hayek is not addressed, nor is most of what von Mises said. It is just a short summary of a very narrow problem; that of practical rationality without the use of money.

Now, is practical rationality without money possible if we assume your definition of Economics, that ""Economics is about the creation of wealth through the method of division of labor""? Off-course not, that much is pretty much obvious in the very definition!

But, if we are to assume another society, with another form of Economics, and other goals (like sustainability, equal allocation, etc.)? Can we then make rational decisions without money? In the documents in this torrent, it is argued that yes, yes we can.

The discussion on whether such a society is desirable or ""good"" is not a part of this torrent; that is a discussion to be had elsewhere. All these documents argue is that, given the society presented, rational decisions without money would be possible."
,noirehtagemot,2011-04-02T21:46Z,"I will address your posts one by one.

1) Oh, I see! Well, if it's Mr. Bastiat's opinion that society consist of exchange, and your opinion that this ought to be interpreted as capitalism being the only game in town... well, then I guess I simply have no other choice than to forget all this nonsense! I mean anything other would require disagreeing with opinions that are in no way backed up by fact or reasoning, which is just sheer humbug, don't you think?



Common now, really? All you've done is restate your previous point, but with the word â€œexchangeâ€ instead. Yes, perhaps Bastiat is correct in THIS society being based on exchange, but that does not mean ALL societies MUST be... there is no reason we cannot imagine ANOTHER form of society that is not based on exchange! The Venus Project, for example, advocated precisely such a society, though there are other examples, like Parecon."

,noirehtagemot,2011-04-02T21:52Z,"2) I have no major objections to your statement that Economics is not yet truly as a science, or anything else you state in your second post.



3) What von Mises was claiming, and what is being refuted here, is that rational decisions are NOT possible without money. By admitting that they are, you are yourself denying Misean economics.

Everything else you say is derived from the COMPETLEY BASELESS ASSUMPTION that a society without exchange cannot exist. 
[You also try to make it seem like the only alternative to money is barter, a statement which is demonstrably false â€“ look up more information on Anarchist Catalonia, for instance, for a historical example. But let us not get into particulars...]

The point is that what's being presented here assumes a DIFFERENT society, one not based on exchange or money or capitalism. To claim that this cannot work because exchange is necessary is silly; air, water, food, etc. are necessary. Exchange may be necessary in SOME societies, like this one, and certain outlooks and philosophies may â€œrequireâ€ it. But to say that no society can exist without it is just wrong. Even von Mises admitted that such a society could exist, that needs could estimated in some way (though he obviously did not like the idea of such a society).

The only, count it, ONLY somewhat valid argument that has been raised against a moneyless society (note that Hayke's argument concerns USSR-style centralised societies, with or without money) is that of rational decision-making provided by von Mises. More importantly, it is the only one being addressed in this torrent.

By admitting that rational decisions can be made in a society without money, you forfeit the argument. Discussion over. Doesn't matter what  Mr. Bastiat's opinion on this is, or how you choose to interpret it: this torrent (and thus this argument) does not concern it, but concerns the Economic Calculation Problem alone. Do not goal-post and try to make it about something else so that you can still â€œdebunkâ€ what I posted. This torrent makes one point and one point alone, and you clearly admitted it was correct. DISCUSSION OVER."
,noirehtagemot,2011-04-02T21:54Z,"4) But for the hell of it:
I agree that a better theory of value is needed. However, I do not think that money can have a role in it. You don't seem to understand WHY some people want to abolish money. This torrent does a good job of explaining that. Like Neurath said, believing that the value of everything can be boiled down to a single unit is irrational â€“ there is just no way that the true value of things can be expressed that way. But this is a wholly different debate...

Repeatedly calling what I posted â€œnonsenseâ€ does not magically make it so, I'm afraid. You have not posted a single good argument for why it is so. In fact, you admit that the one and only thing argued for is true!
Now, you take what has essentially become a SUPPORT of me and what I have posted one step further: you and admit that, even though you personally consider it â€œnonsenseâ€, you have no way of refuting it. Thanks, I guess... "
,boo113,2011-05-02T15:02Z,"I'm all for reading debates on economic issues such as the calculation problem but i think by being associated with a ridiculous  movement such as zeitgeist, taints it a little bit. For the same reason I don't read most of those awful ""catholic libertarians"". The reason may seem petty, I know, but I have a knee jerk reaction everytime but they air those darn Zeitgeist movies too much in my country.

I will read the O'Neill piece, though."
,noirehtagemot,2011-05-03T17:53Z,">>boo113

There is absolutely no association between the piece written by O'Neill and the Zeitgeist Movement, apart form the ideas being applicable to a ""Resource Based Economy"", an idea that the Zeitgeist Movement supports.

Organisations that have the right values (i.e. values one can agree with) ought not to be ignored, no matter how ""ridiculous"" one may think that they are, but assisted through education and rational discussion.

The Zeitgeist Movement especially is such a loose association of so many different people (including conspiracy theorists and hippies, but also rationalists and skeptics) that dismissing the whole movement is problematic."
