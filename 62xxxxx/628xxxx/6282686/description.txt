The author Professor Dr. B. Prabhakar Rao has vast experience as a teacher, administrator and
clinical biochemist. Though there are several textbooks in Biochemistry written by Indian authors,
this book differs from others in that it comprises of questions and answers in all aspects of Biochemistry.
Almost all the commonly asked questions in viva voce examination in Biochemistry are covered by the
author. Subjects like metabolism of xenobiotics, biochemistry of cancer and clinical biochemistry
which are of biomedical importance are also covered in a lucid and simplified manner. This textbook
which is a compendium of questions and answers in all topics of Biochemistry is not a substitute for a
textbook of medical Biochemistry but certainly is an adjuvant to it. This book is useful not only to
undergraduate and post-graduate students in Biochemistry in India but is also useful to those preparing
for other examinations in other countries.
I earnestly hope that this book will receive appreciation from students and teachers.
