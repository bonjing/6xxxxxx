,Raztax,2011-04-09T14:48Z,@kopend2010 PS3 really blows for watching movies. Drop $40 and buy a DivX player
,mrbean1905,2011-04-11T21:40Z,Great quality but agree with @kopend2010. Cinavia copyright notice comes after the 15th minute on PS3 and mutes the sound.
,shiftedx9,2011-04-13T06:51Z,"guys, the ps3 kinda sucks for viewing torrented files. it accepts a very limited number of formats and you will have problems. this cannot be avoided, and the rippers arent going to accommodate you. stop complaining"
