Tabbed Browsing

Add tabs on top of Finder. The same tabs as seen in Google Chrome.

Show System Files

Show me all files on the disk.

Visor

Convenient system-wide Finder always one key-press away.

Folders on Top

Don't make me think. Folders should always go first in list view.

Cut & Paste

Use keyboard shortcuts to move files around. Faster than drag & drop.
