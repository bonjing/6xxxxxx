Notes:

 - Only a 5.3 at IMDB and not really overrated in my opinion, but hey, it wasn't here so now it is. :^) Please note that the source had no subtitles or secondary audio, the audio was not good at times and the video is grainy at the end... not the encode's fault.
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
