,amitpetkar007,2011-06-19T12:39Z,hey.. currently i made VM of Fedora 14.. its working ok.. now im trying to make VM for Win XP professional.. whn i tried doing it.. Vmware tried to update via Internet.. the machine was offline though.. shd I allow updation or not?? Reply soon.. :)
,Slammer94,2011-07-14T01:53Z,"I didn't see any info on how to register this, so I'll just assume that putting in the serial during installation was enough to take care of it. Thanks a million for this! As far as I'm concerned, it's far superior to virtualbox. "

,donkeydick121,2011-09-11T05:22Z,"Xellent. Been using this for yonks and have at least 10 vm's but they're inaccessible for a while as I have a problem with a dynamic drive on 2 new Samsung 1tb hard drives on a RAID array. They're too fast for the system and I keep getting the dreaded ""write delay error"".

I downloaded the new Win 8 beta vm only to find out it's incompatible with this version so I've just got v8 beta which should be ok.

Keep up the good work..."
