PLOT: A Marine Staff Sergeant who has just had his retirement approved goes back into the line of duty in order to assist a 2nd Lieutenant and his platoon as they fight to reclaim the city of Los Angeles from alien invaders.
NOTES:
Here we go with a really nice r5 of this..........Battle: Los Angeles

Source was very nice as it was ,but we did a little bit of filtering....increased the colour,add
more sharpeness,cropped and resized,changed the brightness and contrast etc....
Audio we just needed to sync to our rip ...and also its complete line inc credits.
Enjoy folks
