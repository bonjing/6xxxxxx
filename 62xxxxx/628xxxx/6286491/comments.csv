,alfaboy10,2011-04-01T22:26Z,"This was one of the best episodes ever!
Geez, how can you not like it?"
,.Leto.,2011-04-02T03:12Z,This is by far my favorite show but this was the worst episode ever. What should have been a dramatic and intense episode got completely ruined by all that useless and inappropriate singing.
,toffeeapple2010,2011-04-02T03:46Z,I think the producers have been watching too much Glee. The singing totally ruined all the suspense and drama.

,arcanadx,2011-04-07T21:30Z,"I didn't think this episode was good the first time i watched it. But then I changed my mind after the second watch, it's actually a pretty good episode. A lot people were saying the singing was bad and didn't fit the drama, but then I recalled Callie's opening lines of the episode about the mysterious human brain. Well this is how Callie's brain worked after the accident. All the singings is actually a special form of Callie's thoughts the whole time- how the doctors would perform on her case; the progress of how Callie think of the propose from Robbins, from ""I don't know"" to ""Yes, I'll marry you"". (Remember when Sheppard said ""it possibly means that she's not ready to wake up"") Anyways, It's just my random thinking. And off the topic, many actors/actresses got really good voice~
Thx eztv, great uploads as usual!!"
