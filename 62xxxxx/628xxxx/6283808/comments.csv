[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-01T00:43Z,"Thanks for the comments friends, I'm really grateful for ur support :)
'Gone With The Wind' took 650MB :(
Sorry, it's lenghty movie.

1hr 30mn=260MB (Normally)
This one is 3hr 58mn !!!!

I've given max. settings, doing 2nd pass, needs 11 hours more to finish. 
So it will be here only after 'Runaway Jury'. I'm trying my best to upload one torrent daily. 
Thanks everyone.

,dkhere,2011-04-01T03:55Z,Is there anyway you could upload your movies in mkv format??
,dexter-22,2011-04-01T04:59Z,thx dude :)
,dexter-22,2011-04-01T06:49Z,can u tell me wat do u use 4 such small rips
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-01T07:23Z,"MKV is nothing but just another container, it's less compatible than mp4.
but it reduces 1-2mb when compared to mp4,
@ dex
Use 'MeGUI' for encoding. :)"
,banukaknight,2011-04-01T10:27Z,"there was a time i used to like.. MKV movies.. but not anymore... not after i found StyLishSaLH ... and jeffjam555..
mp4 files seems to have better quality compared to mkvs... and even smaller in size(as i see)...
so... wanna be perfect.. then just stay the same [Bruno Mars :]

< about the FB page... >
24 more fans during the last 14 hours... :)) 

watched HP7 last nite... 
quite drama type (less action, adventure, syfy-ness)
awesome quality yaar.
thanks load."
,rideverest,2011-04-01T17:20Z,"A/V/M 10...seriously

I plugged and played this small sized file on my BD player with hopes it does not suck but turn out to be different. Fully stretched on my 42'' FULL HD Flat Screen without blurry images. It was 80% like FULL HD!!!

,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-03T23:16Z,"This version is more watchable than twentyforty's ~1GB 720p BR-RIP version (who admittedly did no color or contrast correction from the Blue-Ray)--the dark scenes seem to be lighter, and therefore picture details seem clearer.  And the English SRT file is nice too--it even works with the above-mentioned 720p version!  Haven't bothered to download his 480p version as yours is everything I want or need."

,in_dg94,2011-06-26T20:07Z,"i must be doing something wrong because when I tried to play this fullscreen on my Lenovo x220 (12"" screen, 1366x768) it was extremely poor quality.

I expected that, but I've seen some folks say they put it on their 40"" screens and the quality was good.  So, what did I do wrong?  (sorry for the stupid questions)"
,in_dg94,2011-06-26T20:13Z,"y'know, I spent a good 3 hours playing around PRIOR to posting up my question, because I knew as soon as I posted it I'd figure it out.

Well, I was right.  Great job, thanks for the upload.  I'm a dope.  *slaps self repeatedly*"
