 Close to the end of the American Civil War, injured Yankee soldier
 John McBurney is rescued on the verge of death by a twelve year
 old girl from an all-girl boarding school in Louisiana. At first
 the all-female staff and pupils are scared, but as John starts to recover,
 he charms them one by one and the sexually repressed atmosphere becomes
 filled with jealousy and deceit. A few of the girls go after him as well.

 After rejecting the headmistress for a younger girl, McBurney gets his
 comeuppance in the form of some painful Freudian symbolism â€” he falls
 down the stairs. Eventually his leg is amputated by the headmistress,
 so as to avoid gangrene. After going on a rampage that scares all of
 the women, he reforms and announces his intention to marry one of
 the teachers, but it is too late; he has alienated the youngest girl,
 the one who first found him, by killing her pet turtle after throwing it
 aside in a drunken rage. In response, she is coached to pick mushrooms that
 the headmistress and girls use to poison him.
