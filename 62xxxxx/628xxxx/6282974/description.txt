XVID DVD RIP ENGLISH NO SUBS


After restless real-estate scion David Marks (Ryan Gosling) weds middle-class beauty Katie McCarthy 
(Kirsten Dunst) against the wishes of his disapproving father (Frank Langella), suspicions of 
murder fall on the unmoored heir when his wife mysteriously vanishes. Though he's not indicted in 
her disappearance, people with ties to the case begin turning up dead when it's reopened two 
decades later -- and the unhinged David is the prime suspect.
