,ZenRhino,2011-04-04T05:29Z,"Do you have the other 5 songs listed in Wikipedia's entry of the movie that they say are part of the ""score"" of the movie that didn't make the ""official soundtrack""? Here is the list of those 6 songs:
""Prologue"" by Immediate Music
""Crablouse"" by Lords of Acid
""When the Levee Breaks"" by Led Zeppelin
""Tomorrow Never Knows"" by The Beatles
""And Your World Will Burn"" by Cliff Lin
""Panic Switch"" by the Silversun Pickups"
,sheesh10,2011-06-12T15:15Z,what is the quality? is this from the score cd itself? or its just some web rip?
