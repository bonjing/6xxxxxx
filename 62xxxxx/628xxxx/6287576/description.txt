All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes is the third official solo album by English rock musician and songwriter Pete Townshend. It was produced by Chris Thomas and recorded by Bill Price at Eel Pie, A.I.R. and Wessex studios in London. It contains compositions salvaged from later albums by The Who, although being clearly similar to all Townshend solo efforts (just like the late Who albums).

The album was widely criticized at the time for its spoken-word lyrics and extensive use of synthesizers and a more New Wave sound that was atypical of Townshend. Some of the more traditional songs - "The Sea Refuses No River", "Somebody Saved Me", and "Slit Skirts" - were received better than the experimentations - notably, "Stop Hurting People", "Uniforms", and "Communication".
