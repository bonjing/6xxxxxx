,ziggi1000,2011-08-28T08:50Z,"Hi derp247

First thing download VLC, from http://www.videolan.org/vlc
if you don't have. Then right click on the directory where you download all those files and 
select ""Play with VLC"". 
VLC is a free application and safer thn Microsoft crap, you can play many video formats with it."
