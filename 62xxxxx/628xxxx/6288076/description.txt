
Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 â€“ February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. 
Although an accomplished pianist, he owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. 
He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death. (wikipedia.org)
