Appreciate this greatly. Fantastic work HolyRoses."
,hsn_kmr,2011-04-01T11:13Z,"Dear holyRoses ,

I have few doubts , which I want you to clear from you :-
1. How are you able to upload a bluray rip even before the release of the original Bluray Disc ?
2. What should be the video bitrate of the Rip so that I can get Crystal clear picture on a 19 to 22 inches monitor ?
3. What is the Ideal Bitrate of a 720p Encode ?
4. Since this rip says ""1080p"" . Why is the Resolution 1920x800 ?
5. There are so many Bluray rips on the net for this movie , So which one would you prefer ?
6. I once downloaded Inception's Rip by secretmyth after seeing the screenshots which were very sharp and had indepth Detail. But when I saw the movie it was not as sharp as the screenshots . Why ?
Please clear these Doubts . I would really be thankful to You . I am asking this all just because of Curiosity . My intention is not to offend any uploaders .

Thanking You 
God Bless You

,Orsm_Torrents,2011-04-01T12:17Z,"is this a quality download and is it the same as a rip?
A/V ?"
,Orsm_Torrents,2011-04-01T12:24Z,a/v?
,lekkeralgemeen,2011-04-01T13:13Z,HR always offers great quality uploads! So this one is quality as well!
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-01T23:47Z,"Quality is subjective.  The best possible picture and sound is the bluray disk.  You will see lots of people write 10/10 on things I would consider to be 2/10.  Rarely do I think these are 10/10.  More realistic average is like 8.5/10.  It depends on material and source.  You will always find flaws if you look hard enough.  In general though if you are looking that hard then you are probably not watching the movie.  Some releases I just think are god awful because they use horrible sharpening enhancers to downplay that their bitrate is very low.

If you are follower just click the download button and go back to whatever you were doing.  You should know by now there isn't any other viable alternative.

If you aren't following maybe you should be."
,themorningstar69,2011-04-02T08:00Z,"hsn_kmr:  I can't answer all of your questions, but I'll try to answer some.
1)  Release dates of dvd's and blu-rays are different from region to region, country to country.  While a movie may not be available to buy in say the United States, it may be available to purchase many weeks sooner in other counties.  There are also different answers for this, for example, someone who works at a store that rents movies is often able to take home and watch them a week or more before the release date.
4) 1080p refers to a resolution 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels with progressive scan (as opposed to 1080i where the ""i"" would indicate interlaced.)  When something is 1920x800, it simply means that the black bars above and below the picture that are included on the blu-ray, or whatever, are trimmed from the copy.  In that example, it is taking 280 lines of black bar off the picture.  It is still 1080p picture, just without the ""empty"" space.
As for your 5th question, which torrents you should download just depends on what you want to use them for.  In HR's case, they are specifically geared toward ""direct playback on Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, iPod, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, and VLC.""  If you plan to play the movie on one of those devices, HR is the way to go.  If you are using a device with HD playback, go for the 720p's, if it's like an iPod, or older iPod touch or iPhone then you want the portable version."
,henrikhoe,2011-04-02T13:48Z,"If you live in a country like me that needs subtitles, you can use my mp4box and mux twizted subtitle to this movie.

after its muxed, used ultra edit and change the text to sbtl. then you have full working subtitles on your apple tv/ipad whatever"
,hippygonemad13,2011-04-02T13:55Z,"Great quality, HR. Best copy on TPB. Thank you so much."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-02T18:18Z,if you upgrade your ATV v2 to iOS 4.3.1 you will loose descriptions.  Apple is a total retard.  Please complain.  Also iPhone no longer displays chapter pictures as of iOS 4.2.1.  Complain to apple if you do not like these changes.
,ultimagic,2011-04-02T19:49Z,PERFECT!!
,themorningstar69,2011-04-02T21:42Z,"HR, where do you go to complain about the descriptions, I had noticed they took them off.  When I tried to research it all I found was people saying that it was the new update.  I have been hoping they will change it back with a future update, but it will probably take a number of people complaining.  Where to go and what to say?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-02T21:53Z,"http://www.apple.com/feedback/appletv.html

ldes nor desc atoms are displaying.  Its either a problem with iTunes 10.2 or iOS 4.3.

I haven't done any advanced troubleshooting and narrowed it down to exactly the bug they have or if its a new thing where they do not want you to see descriptions anymore.

It could very well be they don't want you to see descriptions on user generated content.

,henrikhoe,2011-04-03T11:36Z,"For those who dont like the ÂŠ Holyroses 2011, etc in the metadata, you can remove with metax"
,ultimagic,2011-04-03T11:53Z,"hey HR, what software did you use to add tags? i use metax but it doesnt have account name and purchase date. thanks."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-03T19:16Z,"fyi the description stuff effects retail videos from the iTunes store.  If the media was in your itunes prior then the descriptions will show up.  If you remove item from itunes, close itunes, relaunch itunes, re-add media the description will no longer show up.  it effects retail assets from the iTunes store as well.  Just tried it with my purchases.

I imagine this will be fixed."
