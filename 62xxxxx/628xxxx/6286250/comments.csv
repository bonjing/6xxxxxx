,rofldinho,2011-04-01T04:14Z,Doesn't work on VLC or WMP. Asks for a codec to be installed which then takes you to a random website.
,HBgutten,2011-04-01T04:37Z,"This file does work. I use VLC, and MacBook pro. Zippet the file, and converted it to apple tv. Nemo problemo!"

,John_Hill,2011-04-01T11:37Z,THE QUALITI ISN'T THAT GOOD FOR AN HD EPISODE....
,DamonST,2011-04-01T11:44Z,"Whilst I do truly appreciate the uploads, and am of course greatful for your work, is there any reason at all to RAR the file? Usenet, fine, but what difference does it make on torrents, aside from an extra level of work at each end of the transfer process...?"

,bla1913,2011-04-01T16:50Z,How annoying are those Rar's. And what for anyway? Back to the 90's.....
,John_Hill,2011-04-01T21:51Z,"hawkboy4 at 2011-04-01 13:01 CET: 

Yeah, you're right...My bad....My apologize to the uploader...."
,Aldaron83,2011-04-02T10:56Z,"Ye, rar-files are not needed anymore. People who downloads HD-stuff often have a decent connection. The rar-files just takes up time."
,YuMaNuMa,2011-04-05T14:06Z,"This guy is being a dick, taking over torrents that are usually uploaded by eztv and making them in rar nightmares. That's right, im ungrateful that your uploading because if you weren't uploading I'm sure someone with a bit of sense will upload proper 720p in actual mkv or avi files.

Mine you that sceneline refuses to upload in avi or mkv format for whatever reason. 

Everyone who is uploading torrents is doing a world a favour but if your going to attempt to do us a favour then at least do it properly. Really sure you didn't get that green skull for uploading rar formats even though its so easy now to convert it back and forth before uploading."
