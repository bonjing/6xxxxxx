PINETOP PERKINS PINETOP  PERKINS AND FRIENDS
Original Release Date: 2008 
Label: Telarc
Format:Mp3@320

Joe Willie "Pinetop" Perkins is a blues music institution, an influential player with enough talent to play well beyond his boogie-woogie barrelhouse roots. Perkins has won so many W.C. Handy/Blues Music Awards for his skills that in 2006 The Blues Foundation just changed the name of the piano category award to the "Pinetop Perkins Piano Player of the Year."
Pinetop Perkins And Friends is the blues pianist's first album in three years, and a fine follow-up to his 2005 set On Top. Spend better than six decades performing the blues, and you'd have a list of friends as lengthy and impressive as Perkins, too. Collaborators here include well-known blues artists like B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and Jimmie Vaughan as well as respected, behind-the-scenes veteran players like Willie Kent, Bob Stoger, and Willie "Big Eyes" Smith.
