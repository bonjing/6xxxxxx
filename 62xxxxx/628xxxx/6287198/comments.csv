I already had a torrent of 8.5gb but i am stuck at 99.1 %. Does anybody have full torrent. I want to see this one alps but in HD 720p or 1080p."
,55trucker,2011-04-14T04:48Z,"I am wondering why this has been downscaled to 720p when the Bluray release is 1080p?  
Goooooood movie, tho"
,payong,2011-04-14T07:16Z,what's with the size dude??
,55trucker,2011-04-16T01:01Z,After finishing this torrent and starting to seed...I noticed that there is something in the background (it seems to be hidden) that still shows as dl'ing at a very very slow rate but it doesn't seem to be adding to the torrent file. Hmmmmm....
,freedomdwarf,2011-08-08T15:30Z,"@55trucker - that's the standard torrent traffic overhead.

@BOZX - Why the huge file size??
Good quality: A9/V8. 
Why do all these movies look like they've got a grey filter?? All the whites look dirty grey. Always have to run a filter thru Virtualdub to get any decent contrast before I burn them."
,tpbuser8,2012-02-05T19:09Z,Is there a glitch near the beginning for this rip?  Read somewhere that AMIABLE re-released a REPACK which has no glitch.  Could someone who finished the download comment on this?  Thanks!
