                Dark Secrets.
                DCI John Barnaby takes on his second case as the head
                of Causton CID. A social services investigator calls
                on elderly eccentrics William and Mary Bingham, but
                he is sent away rudely by their daughter Selina and
                her husband Eddie Stanton. Artist Maggie Viviani also
                had a run-in with the investigator, so when his body
                is found in the river, they all come under suspicion.
                Barnaby learns that the Binghams never recovered from
                losing their elder daughter and son in a drowning
                accident, and discovers that the daughter's body was
                never found. Then Mary is discovered dead. Could a
                mysterious reference to a moon crater called Bingham
                hold a clue?
