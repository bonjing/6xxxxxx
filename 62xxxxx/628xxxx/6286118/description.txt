Kiss fans are like the trekkies of the music world. Strange, bizarre creatures that are never satisfied with any attempts from their idols to keep the franchise going. I, for one, am not surprised that hard-core Kiss fans have blasted this set. It's almost uncool for any Kiss fan to like anything the band puts out now. I simply say this, if you want an excellent overview of the bands entire output then this is it. Yes, I own every Kiss album and probably would have liked to have heard more demos and outtakes however the reality is that most demos are poorly recorded, substandard and not really worth hearing. What the band has done is provide not only the rarities, but also the absolute cream of the crop of their entire catalogue. Don't waste your money on the deluxe set, the only difference is the packaging. This set presents value for money. If you are a newcomer to Kiss and would like to know what they are about then I suggest this box set is all you need (and maybe Double Platinum or Greatest Kiss). The sound is excellent and the booklet presents some insightful observations from mostly Paul and Gene about each song. Especially fascinating are the disc 4 observations by Paul on Kiss' non-makeup 80's output (a very diplomatic "the best I could do at the time"). Gene also is quite frank about former members of the band that let him down.
Disc 1- Highlights: The Eddie Kramer demos and most of the rarities.
Lowlights: Why is "Anything For My Baby" on here?. It just shows what happens when the Beach Boys meet Kiss. Surely there were better numbers from that album to pick!
Disc 2- Highlights:The seamless joining of "Alive" material: Paul's disco version of "God Of Thunder"- what an eye-opener!
Lowlights: Mad Dog and the soundcheck recording of I Want You which sounds remarkably similar to the "live" version on "Alive II"
Disc 3- Highlights- Joining "Detroit Rock City" to the live "King Of The Night time World" good choices of material from the solo albums (except Peters') and the rest of that late 70's/early 80's repertoire.
Lowlights- "Don't You Bring Me Down", why is that here? Lack of extra material. Less disco, more rarities.
Disc 4- Highlights- Best of a small choice of good stuff. Eric Carrs' demo is excellent.
Lowlights- running time (more demos perhaps? Or more album tracks). "Time Traveller"- booooooooring!
Disc 5- Highlights- Finally "Got To Choose" Unplugged on CD! The acknowledgment that "Carnival Of Souls" exists and that it had good songs.
Lowlights- Slowest version EVER of "Rock And Roll All Nite". If everything is that slow Alive IV will be another 5 disc set.
Ignore the morons, and buy this set if you want to hear the best of Kiss and want to delve a little into their vaults. It's a well balanced and presented set. Definitely worth a look.
