,jotunhammer,2011-04-01T18:47Z,"passing 2.5 quota in about 20 minutes...and still it says available only 1.954 copies. Those whos not getting a full copy right now, blame the fuckers whos not seeding...cause Im not dedicating more of my bandwith to cover for the fuckers whos not seeding any."
,jotunhammer,2011-04-01T18:48Z,after I hit 2.5 quota I will put it to 30kB/s so there will be some but im no longer gonna send at 1.2mB/S
