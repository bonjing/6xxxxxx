Notes:  The "Guitar Man" sessions (tracks 1 - 3) feature Elvis goofing off between takes 1 and 2 with an informal song (nicknamed "The Prisoners Song"). 
This is a very explicit song and the takes of "Guitar Man" following also contain X-rated language !

The "Silver Bells" outtake was accidentally released by RCA on a cassette single for a limited time and is very difficult to locate ! 
   
With covers. Enjoy!
