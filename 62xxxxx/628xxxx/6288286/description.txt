          Sergeant Ian Goode and his custody team try                 
          to stay emotionally detached when they deal          
          with youngsters who are familiar with the            
          legal system, and there is a nine-hour battle        
          of wills with a person who refuses to give           
          his name. Meanwhile, the sergeant finds              
          smuggled cigarettes, and charges a drug addict.
