 Description:                                                                  
 Fiona Foster examines the potential impact of cuts in state funding for       
 charities looking after the elderly, children, families and the homeless. Many
 hard-pressed organisations are under threat of closure in the next few months 
 and Fiona investigates what effect this could have on some of the UK's poorest
 communities.                                                                  
                                                                               
                                 Enjoy!
