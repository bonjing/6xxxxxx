A small list of 3D movies I've collected and watched, and feel like sharing.  They all work on any tv, all you need is 3D glasses, in this case, the red and blue lens ones.

I'll keep looking for more to add, so keep posted for a new torrent coming soon, hopefully.

Video info
----------
All videos are in .MP4 format except Toy Story, which is in .AVI format.  They should work with any and all players but if not, I highly recommend getting KMPlayer.  I use to play everything from .AVI to .MPEG to .MKV. To date, I haven't found a format it cannot play.

With so may customizable features, this player is great for laptops, desktops and netbooks with Windows or Mac installed, sorry Linux.

NOTE
----
If any of the above imdb's refer to a movie in it's 3D context, it will usually be referring to it with the new 3D technology, these movies are Anaglyphic (red and cyan glasses) and not polarized.

Hope you guys enjoy this small collection, I'll also be uploading it toas well.  Happy sharing;
