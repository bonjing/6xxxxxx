,psut,2011-04-09T02:55Z,"As it says in the description, they are the full ORIGINAL DVDs with the copy protection, etc ripped out of them.  If you want to burn it to a 4.7GB DVD, you can use a number of programs to do so.  Otherwise, yes, you can just use a DL DVD.
""Toast"" for macs does a great job.  I'm sure there are tons out there for PCs, but I honestly don't remember any right now.
You can also open the VIDEO_TS folder within the download using VLC media player (or a number of other media players out there) & play it off of your hard drive as though it was in a DVD player.  Enjoy!"
,theonenonlykyler,2011-04-11T03:02Z,oh i know that of course. but i wanted it on my tv.. aparently my dvd burner is junk and doesnt burn DL dvds so i ended up turning it to an iso file and got it to stream to my xbox using windows media center. disc two is taking forever to download though :/
,psut,2011-04-26T07:19Z,"I don't know if it will work with an xbox, but I have a PS3 and there's a free google program called PS3 media server, and it works really well with my PS3, as well as my blu-ray player for streaming over my network.  You could try ripping the files to mp4s or something and then streaming it that way. The media server program is here:  http://code.google.com/p/ps3mediaserver/
Hope it helps!"
