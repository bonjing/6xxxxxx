,2838178,2011-04-02T12:55Z,"so far so good
thx for the torrent robbing!"
,oferpop,2011-04-02T13:37Z,"So FRAPS 3.4.0 gets released (if this is legit), and Beepa release 3.4.1 the same day.
It's also been like this in 3.2.X and 3.3.X.

Beepa delaying updates just to troll pirates?

Also, if this IS legit, thank you so much! The new features are a must have for me."
,Itbankrock,2011-04-02T18:14Z,Thank You RobbingHood!
,DeathMast0r,2011-04-03T14:32Z,"Works like a charm, just assure to block the program with Windows Firewall or your personal alternative. 

And no, this would be a quite late April fool. "
,wesleathy,2011-04-03T15:34Z,"Legit, works!"

,Ruamrudee,2011-04-05T04:12Z,"It is 100% working, please remeber to block FRAPS via Windows Firewall or your favorite programs :D

Thanks a lot uploader"
,Itbankrock,2011-04-07T05:17Z,"Dude, it won't launch again, i blocked this program yesterday, but now............ =/"
,Itbankrock,2011-04-07T05:20Z,"Oh, it's working for now, :P"
,tschauk,2011-04-07T14:46Z,"PLSSSS Robbinghood, upload 3.3.3, that one was way better then this one

,battleangel,2011-04-08T08:20Z,Please look into cracking PlayClaw (http://www.playclaw.com/). Would be nice to have an alternative to Fraps.
,BeepBeepimajeep,2011-04-23T04:06Z,"I would also love a crackt version of the latest playclaw.
There is one on this site but it doesn't work any more.
And the main problem is that you need a special codec for the playclaw files to be able to open them and edit them."
,TheMisterDutchy,2011-04-26T22:48Z,"Worked, Thx
Just do what the ream me says!"
,iMesmerizing,2011-04-29T08:11Z,"I will admit, I'm the biggest noob you will find when it comes to actually doing as it says, the correct way. Why is it so important to block this program from Internet access? I can't find it in my Windows Firewall list, so I can block it... Can someone explain exactly how to? Thanks."
,thyagus,2011-04-30T03:25Z,Can someone tell me the IPs it uses for updates? I don't use a firewall and would rather edit hosts file and loop the ips.
,fallenpixels,2011-05-01T23:08Z,216.92.28.131
,thyagus,2011-05-04T02:44Z,"Thank you for the IP fallenpixels, seems that blocking it trough the hosts did it. Installed 100% ok with internet ON and no firewall.

hosts:
127.0.0.1  216.92.28.131"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-05-06T12:58Z,Works perfect. Thanks mate.

,Supernova91,2011-06-01T11:53Z,Wont work for me when I try to run the video it saves it just brings up a musical note on windows media player and plays the sound in the background. sometimes gives a picture with the sound. Divx player just says it cant read it and may need direct show filters... downloaded them and still nothing. Ive torrented fraps before and not had this issue :|
,moonwalk11,2011-06-04T02:41Z,Doesn't work for me. I can't even get it to record anything. I push the button that it says to push to record movies and it doesn't do anything. No error. It just doesn't do anything. I know I am doing it right. It just doesn't do anything.
[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-04T14:35Z,"@Supernova91
@moonwalk11

It's working for everyone cause it's the retail version. Obviously both your PCs suck, or maybe something else ....."

,Yorkfield,2011-06-13T18:46Z,"Hi RobingHood, my name is Cov ... do you remember me from the SuprBay forum ?
I was the one regarding Synthesia :D

Wanted to say, Fraps v3.4.0 is awesome!!
Just make sure all, to disconnect from the internet durig installation and disallow Fraps to access the internet within Windows Firewall before you launch Fraps the first time.

peace & out"

,jnada1,2011-08-07T01:25Z,"@Supernova91

Your computer may not have the power to run the program."
,echo873,2011-08-15T13:58Z,"Ummm... idiots, this version is nearly 5 months old. The latest one is 3.4.6 (3.4.5 is the latest cracked one)."

,TheEpicGoldNinja,2011-09-02T21:48Z,"@Supernova91

You need to have the right codecs.
Google up ""K-lite Codec Pack"" and install either the standard or full version. "

,WayneCM,2011-10-09T05:41Z,"When I record, it acts like a screenshot? I press F9, and record some..I stop it and go to play the video, the sound plays fine, but the video is just like a picture."
,hagenh,2011-12-30T12:48Z,"It finished in less then 10 sec, holy shit :D "
,oggybones,2012-01-13T22:59Z,5 or 6 seconds. I wish everything downloaded that fast.
