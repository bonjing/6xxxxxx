                      Fraps v3.4.0 (Full Registered Version)



Release date Fraps v3.4.0.13130: 29th Mar 2011


Fraps (from "Frames per second") is a universal benchmarking, screen capture, 
and real-time video capture Windows application that can be used with games 
using DirectX or OpenGL graphic technology. It is commonly used to determine 
a computer's performance with a game, as well as record gaming footage. 

The program is very popular in the making of amateur machinima films.
Fraps can take screenshots in various formats: BMP, TGA, JPEG, and PNG. 
(However, only the BMP format is available in the freeware version.) 

In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as:
- Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video while 
  playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima revolution! Throw away 
  the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never been this easy! 
  Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560x1600 with custom frame rates from 
  10 to 100 frames per second! 
- Benchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting 
  in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame 
  rate between any two points. Save the statistics out to disk and use them for 
  your own reviews and applications.
- Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key! 
  There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot. 
  Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped.

The lossless Fraps codec allows decoding of Fraps-encoded videos (using a media 
player capable of decoding the AVI container format) or transcoding to other 
video formats (with the use of the right software). The Fraps video codec manages 
to capture videos with minimal impact on game performance, as it has been 
optimized to achieve compression higher than uncompressed RGB, resulting in 
smaller filesizes, though the lossless format is considerably less space-efficient 
than more heavily compressed lossy video formats such as DivX. This is because 
encoding on-the-fly to a high-compression format such as DivX would have a large 
negative impact on game performance (as of 2007) and only a very fast hard drive 
could record the immense amount of data produced in using uncompressed video. 
The Fraps format is a compromise of the two.

Fraps 3 - New features and a new look!  
- Fraps is now compatible with Windows 7 and the latest DirectX 11 games.
- Ventrilo & TeamSpeak users have long wanted a way to record their microphone 
  and speakers at the same time.  
- For Windows 7 and Vista we've added realtime sound mixing to our video recording 
  so you can now capture both sides of the conversation!

NVIDIA have recently included stereoscopic 3D support directly into their drivers. 
If you play your DirectX9 (D3D9) game with 3D Vision enabled you can use Fraps to
record the game in full 3D too!  You'll get a side-by-side stereo AVI recording 
that you can drop straight in to a stereoscopic 3D player!

Finally, we are aware that more and more people are putting Fraps to professional 
use. We've added a new option to force lossless RGB compression to ensure that you 
always have the highest quality video output to work with.


Changes in Fraps 3.4.0 - 29th Mar 2011:
***************************************
- Added configurable buffer size for loop recording mode.
- Increased video capture performance at high resolutions.
- Fixed slow recording of Minecraft at default window size.
- Fixed benchmark crashing when configured to stop automatically after 1 second.


System Requirements:
********************
- DirectX 9.0c or DirectX 10
- Requires Administrator rights
- Supports all modern CPU's (Pentium 3 and above)
- Captures fastest with an NVIDIA GeForce or ATI Radeon graphics card
- Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista and Windows 7

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.

15. No Promises ... No Debts!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. Avira AntiVir Premium 
3. avast! Pro Antivirus
4. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
