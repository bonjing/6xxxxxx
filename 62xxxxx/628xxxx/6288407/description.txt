                The Mercedes.
                A new six-part comedy written and produced by Robert
                Popper, starring Tamsin Greig, Paul Ritter, Simon
                Bird and comedy newcomer Tom Rosenthal, plus special
                guest star Mark Heap. Friday Night Dinner is a truly
                original series about the Goodmans, a family who have
                made an art form of their eccentricities. In this
                episode it's Adam's birthday. As he arrives home, a
                silver Mercedes almost runs him over. Inside, is
                Sheila Bloom - or 'Bitchface' as Adam and his family
                call her. 'Bitchface' is famously obsessed with her
                Mercedes, and after some catty remarks about Adam's
                'Yugo', she speeds off. Dad reveals that he used to
                have a thing with Bitchface years ago. The boys
                can't believe it. Mum's not happy. Later, the family
                abandon dinner and go for a Chinese, but Bitchface
                is there. An awkward chat ensues, and finally Dad
                reveals exactly what he got up to with her.
