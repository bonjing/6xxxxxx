Press Release: Mechanization Announces â€œKenosisâ€

Returning from three years in the dungeon, Mechanization releases their second full-length album â€œKenosisâ€ which blasts to the core of all that is Mechanization. Whereas their first album â€œHolonâ€ was an experimental voyage, â€œKenosisâ€ is a sledgehammer to the collective spine of mankind. Quite simply put: Itâ€™s a heavy metal champagne jam, and the world is invited to partake in the destruction. Every song was intentionally designed to split heads and crush souls. With tracks such as â€œEntering the Shed of Fire, and Taming the Serpent,â€ â€œMedieval War Song,â€ and â€œRipping the Tusk from the Head of the Mammoth,â€ you can easily see that Mechanization holds nothing back and delivers the uranium (thatâ€™s the heaviest metal in the world for you Bieber and Gaga fans). Terrorenceâ€™s vicious growls, HMTâ€™s shredding riffs, and technologyâ€™s relentless groove deliver one sonic punch to the sternum after another. The forces beckoned to create this masterpiece are so brutal that legions of robotic dragons couldnâ€™t stop the impending impact that all shall witness. Alas, words about â€œKenosisâ€ are the same as words about love, sex, and war--meaningless compared to the actual experience. So grab yourself an axe and a taco because the world as you know it will never be the same.
