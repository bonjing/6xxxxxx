,blusniffer,2011-04-07T00:26Z,"@money-1 it's not a scam but u just happen to come across this site for 'making' money and suprisingly ur id's money? lmao

2 things here, 1) when someone with poor english says trust 300 times theres scamming afoot,
2) These sites know users will end up putting their own money in for ÂŁÂŁ that never arrives!

Ignore this ethnic minority tea-leaf!!!"
