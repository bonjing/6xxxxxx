MJ Fans, you have hit the JACKPOT! I have spent over 100 hours and remastered
a full DTS 5.1 Surround Version of "Thriller". This process involves using the
original vinyl record and separating frequencies and isolating them to form
a surround experience!  All you need is Roxio, Nero or anything that will burn
an ISO file to dvd.  Burn dvd put in your home theatre dvd player and hear
more of MJ than ever before.  It will feel like he is in the room with you!
Please seed and share with the world and leave comments on your listening 
experience.  It is a labour of love doing projects like this and I love to 
have encouraging feedback.  CHEERS
