,rjc1138,2011-04-02T19:15Z,"Hi. I've never had an issue with iSerial until last month when it wouldn't allow me to run the reader. I just tried this one for April and I get the same ""Runtime error."" The failure message reads: ""Can't find plugin method ExtStr(x As Extinteger) As String""

Any ideas? Thanks in advance and thanks for all the great torrents!"
[V],polisdavid,2011-04-02T21:51Z,"Sorrry rjc1138 that you had this problem,

But I've never heard of this run time error occurring.  Will the iReader runl without the database? Maybe it got corrupted.

I would re-download the whole thing again and retry..."

Any chance you could also seed Bookends. I'm trying to download and am still very stuck. Thanks for this serialbox too.
Cheers."
