Is this normal behavior for the game?"
[V],matimike,2011-03-31T14:59Z,"no problems here in fact i did NOT install. it extracted to a folder i just clicked the exe and game started

i did have to extract each rar but that could just be my pc its acting weird
for me the game works perfectly, thank you Stun for another quality upload"
,bmorgan303,2011-03-31T20:09Z,someone needs to repack this. Its not your comp. Its the stupid ass way this was compressed. 
,endemoniada,2011-03-31T21:37Z,"Hi mates, after you unrar, unzip, and unrar again you'll be left with f4cg-setup-fate-tck.exe; that file can actually be unrared into the game rip, there is no need to run it (I was afraid to).

This looks good."

,Jayzamine,2011-04-13T07:19Z,"ok im kind of new at this, after i downloaded this i ended up with one file named ""FATE.4.The.Cursed.King.v1.0.0.0.Cracked-F4CG"" and there are all these rar ""f4nbhl##"" files in there, what do i do with these? some1 plz tell me how this is supposed to work lol"
,TheJoker124,2011-05-04T15:31Z,"Hello everybody, i'm new and i don't konw how to open the file? I know how to download it but when i open the file there is lot of winzip/winrar files, please help me"
,criscool,2011-05-25T21:48Z,"I tried unrar but it said a volume is missing, any help would be appreciated, or a step by step way to make this work.  but in my opinion it was compressed really badly."
,criscool,2011-05-25T22:01Z,"o.k I think I figured it out. Unzip all the files on the same folder, then unrar, and then unzip again, it will finally give you a folder with the game in it and there's no need to istall just click on the fate.exe and play."
,Tann66,2011-05-28T02:45Z,Okay so I downloaded it. Unzipped and then I try to un rar and it says volume is missing. Obviously I'm doing something wrong. Any help? Thanks guys.
,IronicChange,2011-07-18T07:06Z,downloading now. i will have some results
,Helroy,2011-08-08T14:43Z,why the fuck do ppl still rar stuff. fucking useless. its asking for a cd in order to unzip.. not working at all here
,MaTiSrAw,2011-08-13T03:13Z,"Okay for those who dont understand how to install this. Here you go:

1. Download WinRAR (google it)

2. Create a folder on your desktop (name it FATE)

3. Open the torrent and highlight every single zip archive f4nbhl01 - f4nbhl68

4. Right click and select ""Extract Files...""

5. Extract to FATE folder (in your desktop)

6. Now you will have more .rar archives in the FATE folder. So highlight every-single f4cg file, right click, select ""Extract files..."" and extract it to your Desktop

7. Now you will have a 7zip self-extracter file. 
For Windows Vista/7 users - Run as admin
Windows XP - Run it

8. Now it will create a folder on your desktop called ""FATE The Cursed King""

9. Open the folder and run the fate application (with the purple swirly looking icon)

10. Enjoy the game and hope i helped."
