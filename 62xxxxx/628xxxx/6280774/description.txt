I tried to find a working version of Copernic Desktop but failed. So I searched my computer and found this version in a backup from an old computer. 

The keygen triggers a virus varning. But when I used it together with NOD32 way back when nothing came up. 

This is the \"virus\" details that AVG gives me:

Perhaps it\'s some sort of malware warning?

Anyhow, now you know about the virus warning.
