Plot Summary:
--------------------
 Next in the four-part Marvel Anime project and broadcasts after the Iron Man anime. Wolverine is a mutant,
possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical 
capabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually 
any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate

The first episode of the series brings us to a time where Logan is drawn back to Japan to rescue Mariko from her father.
At this point in his history, it's to set up his great Japan 
adventure that helped truly define the character in the 80's where he gained his concepts of honor and family.

Synopsis:
--------------

Episode 10 is Titled "Kurohagi"

As The rebels continue their Assault on the main Entrance to the Dragon Palace Koh and Yukio are
confronted by Mariko's Father who intends to finish the assassination of the family that he began 
many years before. Logan is able to hear this meeting with his mutant senses and the ceremony in 
another part of the palace  Where Kurohagi is trying to hurry through with the wedding and he has to 
decide which to go to first. He chooses to help Yuriko and Koh but arrives too late to stop Koh sacrificing
himself to save Yuriko.When the Bridge they are standing on is hit by a missile the fight is interupted and Logan 
runs off to the ceremony while Yuriko stays with the dieing Koh. In a scene very much like "The Graduate"
Logan finally arrives at the ceremony and swears to take Mariko away. Just as Logan has his hands on Kurohagi
Mariko's father arrives and with his "Wind of Blade" attack he injurs Logan long enough for Kurohagi to
drag Mariko away once more...

Note:
-----------
Once again, All credit for subtitle translation goes to Weapon+
without their work my avi conversion would be pretty useless :)

I would also like to apologise for my earlier synopsese where I wrongly named 
Kurohagi junior as Shingen, who is in fact Mariko's father, not her Fiance, big ooops.
