,redbaron46,2011-04-02T01:13Z,"OMG you idiot 720p movie are like 4-6 gigs, this is a 1080p @ 12000kbs/s, moron"
,biosquid2,2011-04-02T04:38Z,"wow redbaron46. so MMusic23's experience in this field is limited, but did you have to relentlessly attack the dude? "
,yopepoy,2011-04-02T05:46Z,don't feed the troll. please ignore that guy.
,SebaPee,2011-04-02T14:37Z,"not full screen, gona wait for one with 1920x1080"
,biosquid2,2011-04-02T18:52Z,"SebaPee, movies are widescreen these days usually with aspect ratios of 2.35:1 or 2.40:1. the black bars will still be there whether they're encoded or not. the 1920x800 resolution of this encode covers the whole picture that was originally shown in theaters."
,Jurvi,2011-04-02T22:44Z,People like MMusic123 & SebaPee are such lovely comedy :p
,RaW-D-Coy,2011-04-05T00:05Z,"The quality suck's, just wait a bit longer =D"
,Darksteel1335,2011-04-06T17:18Z,"This is not fullscreen for my iMac, going to wait for 1440p rip XD"
,FORD_PROBE,2011-04-07T05:11Z,"I GOT A QUESTION. IF ITS 1080 WHY ARE THE ASPECTS ONLY 1280X800 AND NOT BY 1080.
"
,biosquid2,2011-04-09T00:19Z,"Darksteel1335 let me know when you find a 1440p movie, i'll bring out my best wine when that happens. FORD_PROBE maybe you're watching the video on a 1280x800 monitor; that would defeat the purpose of downloading 1080p"
,kakanman,2011-04-14T19:15Z,"OMG this is not 1080p.   This is 800p
learn to up load the right stuff!"
,FORD_PROBE,2011-04-17T15:37Z,ITS GOT THE CINVIA  CRAP WHERE YOU CANT WATCH IT ON PS3 CUTS OUT THE SOUND
,iamneo33,2011-05-07T07:43Z,"are all of you noobs so dumb that you do not understand what 1080p is?  Or that the aspect ratio of the movie screen is different?  6 gigs for a 1080p movie, 800p, 1440p, none of this exists in the real world...

I know, I know... don't feed the trolls or the noobs!

,UltimaSlacker,2012-01-03T06:06Z,"To the so-called experts: Why don't you stop using childish words like ""noob"" and ""troll"" and get your shit together.  If you explained things better, maybe there wouldn't be any ""noobs"" or ""trolls"" to feed, eh?"
