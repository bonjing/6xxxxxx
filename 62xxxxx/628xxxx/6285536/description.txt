The Long Hot Satsuma is a radio comedy sketch show from 1989 

Sketches about footballing folk singers (including Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell), plus a send-up of Hamlet with help from some Groucho Marx style wise-cracks.

Note: The BBC only had 2 eps in their archives. The missing 6 were knocking about on torrents and OTR for years. Then the BBC seem to have found the missing eps.

I post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.
If it's down then it's skipped.
