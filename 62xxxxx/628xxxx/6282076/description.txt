Background Information:
-----------------------
Despite his being banned from physically entering the UK, Zakir Naik  addressed the Oxford Union via video link on 11 February 2011, Friday, giving a speech and answering questions on topics such as how the media represents Islam; terrorism ,and his own ban from the UK.

From â€˜The Oxford Studentâ€™ newspaper:

â€œIn his speech, Naik blamed the â€˜virulent propagandaâ€™ in the media for the â€˜misconception of Islamâ€™ and for his own ban on entry to the UK.

â€œHe claimed the media printed portions of his speeches â€˜out of contextâ€™ and so portrayed him as a â€˜preacher of hateâ€™.
â€œHome Secretary Theresa May excluded Naik from the UK last June after his â€˜unacceptable behaviourâ€™, referring to comments he made in speeches, which were then posted as YouTube videos.

â€œNaik defended himself during his address, declaring himself on a â€˜mission is to spread peaceâ€™.

â€œâ€˜Unfortunately today the media portrays Islam as a religion which promotes terrorismâ€™, Naik said. â€˜The media picks up on the black sheep of the Muslim community and portrays them as though they are exemplary Muslims.â€™â€

â€œOver the course of the question-and-answer session, Naik responded to queries about Islamophobia and hijabs, among other topics.

â€œOn the subject of Islamophobia, Naik said: â€˜It is the duty of us as Muslims that we should spread the true teachings of Islam.â€™

â€œNaik was blunt in his statement that â€˜Islam and I, too, condemn all forms of terrorismâ€™ and said: â€˜Islam condemns the killing of any human being irrespective of caste colour or race, irrespective of nationality.â€™â€
