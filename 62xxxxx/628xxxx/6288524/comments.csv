,deazn1,2011-04-17T04:57Z,"It allows me to backup my ipod to my computer, but it says it needs to be updated in order to backup directly to the itunes library. I can't save my ratings and play count without backing up directly to the itunes library."

Huge thanks :)"

,tpboss,2012-01-10T09:17Z,"This is v4.260; not compatible with ios5.x. Useful, but not for 5.0 users. IS activated though."
,jwinthrop,2012-03-14T00:07Z,In case anyone can't get this to work with the current iTunes...  I just uninstalled iTunes and downloaded iTunes version 8.1 from oldapps.com.  Should work now for ya.  Then when you're done transferring songs you can update itunes again.
