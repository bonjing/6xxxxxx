Not EVERY crack alerts as a virus. I'm going to use Sandboxie to see if this crack works ONLY in ArchiCAD. Otherwise this is a fucking malware."
,miknos,2011-07-06T21:01Z,"After checking, this is definitely a fucking virus and don't even work as a crack!

Just check other uploads by this idiot and you figure it out. He is sharing a Windows XP DVD ""super compressed"" @ 9MB.

What a scumbag."

Test an upload before you go round telling other people that i am a scumbag.It works only that its super compressed."
