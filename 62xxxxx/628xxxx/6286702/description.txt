Lady Gaga's first known performance of her song Captivated was at an NYU talent show in 2005 (that .mp3 can be found amongst http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6231414)

The song hadn't appeared since then until recently, when at her March 11th concert, she noticed a couple holding up a sign saying that their wedding song was Captivated. Gaga then proceeded to sing a part of the song a capella. An .mp3 of this segment of about a minute in length is what's included in this torrent.
