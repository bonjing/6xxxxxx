Shrod's first Minecraft Goldpack.


I made this bunch for beginning minecrafters. It is easy to follow the instructions that I made and I included images, you don't even have to install the game, just run it! With this goldpack you can do even more. Please NOTE not all the mods have tutorials so you may have to visit some forums. I will not support your comments here! This goldpack is made for people who want to start the other way around, and for those who want to twist some blocks ... (note: on 2nd of April there was only minecraft 1.4, but due to comming update, I already named it 1.5 because the update was shortly comming.)

anyway enjoy the very first and official SHROD'S GOLDPACK
