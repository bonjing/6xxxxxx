but I understand what you are saying ;)"
,eggface,2011-04-02T08:25Z,"about that 1.5, I understand if torrent names aren't changeable. still a bit misleading thou

anyway i downloaded your pack, and i must say this is actually a very good beginners set. the tutorials are well written.

+ good package with some very good extra stuff and tutorials. fast download (the file is only 10 mb, it took me about 3 secs to download. and it virus/spam free.

- misleading name"
