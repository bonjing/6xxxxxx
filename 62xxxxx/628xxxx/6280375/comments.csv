,PS3HD,2011-03-31T11:17Z,im new to this... so how do you get the game onto the ps3??
,gabriel84,2011-03-31T18:21Z,"It works on 3.55 Kmeaw

How I did it:
First thing you need to follow the instruction here and replace the eboot.bin file (if you can't find it do a windows seach inside the folder)

Before I Installed Multiman I used Gaia to copy the NFS2 to HDD (after I replace the eboot) On Gaia press ""O"" on the controller to activate the copy menu and then you should figure out what to do.  

1- go to http://www.ps3-hacks.com/file/160
2- download ""multiMAN 1.16.11 for 3.40 - 3.55""
3- Inside the zip file you will find 3 package files
4- Transfer file ""multiMAN ver 1.16.11 BASE (20110322_170000).pkg"" to USB drive root
5- Install the package
6- Now you should have Multiman installed on the menu
7- Run Multiman app and look for NFS2 game (Make sure you look for the one in the HDD) and hold ""select"" and hit ""X""  
8- It will ask you if you wanna lunch the game without going back to the PS3 Menu 
9- Hit ""NO"" and then PS3 will reset and you will see the game loaded in the menu

FAQ 
* Yes you can have multiple Game Managers Installed like Gaia, Multiman Etc 
* If you have Older version of Multiman you Delete it and install the new one
* Cant think of anything else, have fun"
