Problem is in your side , try to re-download the torrent. Tryed it and it worked , unrar'd , mounted , installed.."
,newsride,2011-04-02T01:45Z,"U redownloaded it again but it was same error (Rar 6,11,19,23,34,48) damaged and Incomplete unrared. Therefore Packed data CRC failed in acamap15.iso. The volume is corrupt. It can not created iso. Why you put SFV only? If you added Par for recovery and anyone can recovery for error. Plz check it youself with your SFV. I can not used this and wait someone post right one later. Thank you."
