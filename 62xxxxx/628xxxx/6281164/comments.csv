,jessez,2011-04-01T15:43Z,"This is the worst seed to download ratio torrent for shogun 2 so can we get more feed back from people who have downloaded it , i wana know if this version is good ."
,zenatharPL,2011-04-03T11:51Z,"I can confirm that the downloaded files are intact and working. However the installation requires you to register the product through Steam. As this uploads does not provide any kind of information about how this can be bypassed you will actually need the original game and serial number to play. 

TLDR - Unless you have original serial this will not work for you"
,reiofcats,2011-04-06T18:57Z,"I'm sorry guys, I'm not going to hold your hand in able for you to play this game, but I will say the way I got it to work was by extracting all the files with phoenix, and then I cracked it with a Dibya crack by copying all the files in the dibya crack to the folder i extracted shogun 2 total war to
instructions here, just don't use the files they suggest, use the ones I suggest http://www.patheticreviews.com/index.php/2011/03/19/install-shogun-2-total-war-with-download-links/

one last thing, YOU DON'T NEED A CD KEY YOU FUCKING RETARDS"
,kecjr,2011-04-19T21:37Z,"Please halp, does this version has to be ripped through Phoenix, too?
"
,Fredddooo,2011-04-20T22:15Z,"Working perfect, thanks!

Below how I proceeded and it worked 100% at first try (please note that I only restarted my computer once after last step below) :
0 - latests drivers !
1- Download this torrent (if direct download does not work, use magnet link)
2- Download phoenix 1.4 beta 7 program (next versions are buggy so do not install further version of the program nor update 1.4 beta 7 version to 1.5 beta x version) 
3- Copy phoenix in a new folder you create in c:\program files\... (in x86 program files folder if x64). look for torrent ""Shogun 2 Patches (All 3) + Pheonix Unpacker 1.4 and Instructions!""
(next below)"
,Fredddooo,2011-04-20T22:16Z,"4- Mount cd1 iso and cd2 iso on 2 separate virtual drives with your favourite program to do so
5- Launch phoenix (if error read twice step 2- !!). 
5-1)  Select the destination folder for the extraction 
5-2) Select ""SID Unpacker"" through 'Instruments' menu. Next to ""Sim-File"" path click on ... button and select the sim file to be found on the cd1.iso mounted on your first virtual drive 
5-3) Click on ""Select all"" button
5-4) Click on ""Scan a SIM-file"" button
5-5) Click on ""Unpack"" button. Wait for 15 minutes for the extraction
5-6) When prompted, select the 2nd sim file to be found on the cd2 iso mounted on your second virtual drive 
6 - download ali23 patch (ali213.net-11gpatch15.8.exe), place it in your game folder where you instracted cd1 and cd2 with phoenix and install it (it's in Chinese but you'll figure out - during the ali213 patch installation, select your game folder where the game will be installed)
7 - Copy ""shogun2.V1.Crack.exe"" and ""shogun2.V2.Crack.exe"" (from ""Shogun 2 Patches (All 3) + Pheonix Unpacker 1.4 and Instructions!"", same than in 3-) in game installation folder. Lauch V1 crack, then V2 crack. During installation of each crack, msg  box will appear with a bold 'yes'  and a greyish 'no'. Selecting NO ! (you'""ll have the feeling that nothing happened, but it does actually!!)
8 - go in your game install folder > 
8-1) delete all language packs files ('local_xx.pack"") other than the english ones  (""local_en.pack"" and ""local_en_patch.pack"" in principle)
8-2) edit ""language.txt"" file and replace 'ES' (for spanish language by default) by 'EN' (for english...you guessed right ...)
9 - Reboot
10 - game shortcut (desktop) > Play ! (loading screen takes 20-30 secs,  be patient, it's not freezing)
11 - not working ? read twice (or read game config capabilities)"
,Fredddooo,2011-04-20T22:17Z,"5- Launch phoenix.exe (if error read twice step 2- !!). 
5-1)  Select the destination folder for the extraction (for ex. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Shogun 2 Total War"")
5-2) Select ""SID Unpacker"" through 'Instruments' menu. Next to ""Sim-File"" path click on [...] and select the sim file to be found on the [cd1].iso mounted on your first virtual drive (for ex. ""E:\Total War- SHOGUN 2_disk1.sim.""). 
5-3) Click on ""Select all"" button
5-4) Click on ""Scan a SIM-file"" button
5-5) Click on ""Unpack"" button. Wait for 15 minutes (i5 760 processor) for the extraction
5-6) When prompted, select the sim file to be found on the [cd2].iso mounted on your second virtual drive (for ex. ""F:\Total War- SHOGUN 2_disk2.sim.""). "
