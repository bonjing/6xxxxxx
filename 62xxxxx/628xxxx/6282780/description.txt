                Drama series moving between the lives of two
                generations of the same family who live at 32
                Brinkburn Street in 1931 and 2011. In 1931, Billy
                keeps his stranglehold on Walter, with another job
                lined up as a look out. A nervous Walter agrees, but
                bottles it at the last minute, angering Billy even
                more. And in 2011, Ellie's single-minded focus on her
                own child is still making things tense with Nick, who
                has also just discovered that Poppy is on the pill,
                and he looks for stress release with his AA sponsor,
                Lynne.
