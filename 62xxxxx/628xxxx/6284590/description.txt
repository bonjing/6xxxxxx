\"The Dirty Lungs (from Birmingham, AL) are almost worthy of their own post. I knew absolutely nothing about them going into last nightÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s show, but their set might have been my favorite of the night. They do a retro psych-rock thing with a classic rock sheen, kind of like the last Comets on Fire record. It paired nicely with what Abby Go Go and The N.E.C. do. It looks like theyÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ll be back in Atlanta for a couple of shows in July. Check them out.\"  http://www.littleadvances.com

Psychedelic Hotel Vol. 1 was originally released in 2010 as a bonus disc on the first run of the Deregulate Your Heart EP (limited to 50). It was the first in the psychedelic hotel series and is now available as a standalone. Suites 1 through 5 are the introductions, while 6-8 are the true starts to the series.
