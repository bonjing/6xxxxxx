\"The Dirty Lungs (from Birmingham, AL) are almost worthy of their own post. I knew absolutely nothing about them going into last nightâ€™s show, but their set might have been my favorite of the night. They do a retro psych-rock thing with a classic rock sheen, kind of like the last Comets on Fire record. It paired nicely with what Abby Go Go and The N.E.C. do. It looks like theyâ€™ll be back in Atlanta for a couple of shows in July. Check them out.\"  http://www.littleadvances.com

\"Like many Yankees, I have a bit of a fascination with the part of our good ol\' US of A that lays below the Mason Dixon Line. Southern-made music is something I am always going to check out, and probably dig lots, as is the case with Birmingham, Alabama rockers The Dirty Lungs. The Dirty Lungs have released 2 EPs and a full album, and not one of the songs on any of those 3 releases disappoints in any way. Not one of the songs sounds like any of the others, and all are full of southern charm, flair, and some seriously amazing guitar reverb and interplay, which makes for a kick in the head upon first listen, and some very obsessive repeat plays. Want It?, the highlight of The Robins EP, has enough swagger and sexy attitude to put Elvis to bed, and I mean that, so seriously. DD Reg Reg, the highlight of the Deregulate Your Heart EP, is pure rock & roll FUN. Many of The Dirty Lungs\' songs, like Sit Tight (from the album), are big & rowdy, loud & raucous, down & dirty, but some of the songs on these 3 releases are actually slower of tempo, and even a bit experimental in nature. Somehow, through masterful song writing and skilled playing, the southern charm of this band is always there, no matter what the tempo, pulling at your shirttails (in MY case, crawling up my arm and biting my neck, mmmmmm!), demanding your attention & enjoyment, and certainly demanding play after play, louder and louder. The 9 tracks of the album Somebody Here\'s Going Crazy can be found HERE, with stand-out songs Live Legit and 1000 Suns right in the middle of the album. Oh, and Lost In Space/Talkhouse from The Robins EP, with its mysterious vibe, and almost tribal drums and hushed vocals, that one deserves a WOW. Well, there are a lot of WOW\'s here listening to The Dirty Lungs music, go see for yourselves!\" http://dirtysexykarma.blogspot.com

\"Y\'all know I have me a major weak spot for most things Alabama. So just imagine my surprise and delight when I opened my inbox to find an email from a killer little band...from Alabama. Friends, I\'d like you to meet The Dirty Lungs. I think I might just have a little crush on them.

You see, The Dirty Lungs can make quite an unholy racket, a gritty blend of good old grimey garage, nouveau psych, and even some Stone Roses-esque, splendidly overindulgent instrumentation. It\'s sleazy, it\'s nasty, and mercy me it\'s fantastic. This is a band that abides by the \"go big or go home\" mentality, cranking out the walls of blistering, beautiful noise and swirling, hazy masses of sound like there\'s no tomorrow. And maybe there\'s not. So while there\'s still a today, might I suggest you spend some time making yourself acquainted with these fellows? You\'ll be ever so glad you did.\" http://lesenfantsterriblesmusic.blogspot.com
