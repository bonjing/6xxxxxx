[V],manOtor,2011-04-02T19:14Z,"Sorry, was AFK - got it up and running again. Still some probs with upload speed, so please be patient ;)..."
[V],manOtor,2011-04-02T23:29Z,"FYI:

I couldn't find any XviD - version with the OAR (Original Aspect Ratio) anywhere.
So I decided to get all the 1280*720 BiA.mkv files from elsewhere and convert my own XviD version of the Season.
It is now as stated in the description in Xvid/MP3 at 720*304 size.
Enjoy ;)!
I'd say it's decent quality, but feel free to comment."
[V],manOtor,2011-04-04T22:39Z,"Episodes 17-20 have hardcoded subs (eng) - I am sorry!
Will upload them separately without the subs..."
[V],manOtor,2011-04-05T00:17Z,"Due to the standard set to ''subtitles switched on'' in the source mkv files, the previous release came out with episodes 17-20 having hardcoded subtitles.
I fixed it.

,xNephelimox,2011-06-05T14:01Z,"I can't get it to play wirh any of my Xvid players, whats goin on? O_o"
,Owen_L,2011-07-13T23:40Z,"I can play them with my VLC Media Player, but not with other software and not on stand alone players.
Some codec issue I'd guess. Thanks for the UL anyways."

,frumpypanda,2012-01-24T00:35Z,"doesnt work, it's like some mkv format or something.... would have been nice as mp3 or wmv or a real video file.
