This guide is designed to introduce men of all ages to the kitchen and to transform them with minimal pain into competent cooks. Recipe 21: The male cook. This is becoming more popular, but has been a rarity in the past. Ingredients: this book, a man, a kitchen. First of all, show the man where the kitchen is, and sit him in a quiet corner with a copy of this book. Leave for 15 minutes, then explain to him that it really is his turn to do the cooking. Argue briefly, then hand him a saucepan and some ingredients, read the recipe to him very slowly, and hope for the best.
