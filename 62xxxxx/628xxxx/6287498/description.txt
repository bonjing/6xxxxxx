Description:

When large numbers of heavily armed terrorists have taken over the Prypiat area, European 
governments shook in fear. Soon enough the fear grew even stronger after the terrorists have 
made contact. They want ten billion Euro in 24 hours or they will blow up the entire Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant, releasing clouds of deadly, radioactive materials high into the atmosphere 
all over the northern hemisphere.

To pay such amount of money to the extremists is unthinkable. Frontal attack, however, could not 
be thought about, either - the terrorists would have executed their plan if they saw attacking 
forces. There were too many of them and too well equipped for a quick military operation to succeed.

One possibility remained - to select the best Spec Ops single unit to sneak in and destroy enemy 
installation, preventing them from blowing up the Chernobyl and killing as many of them as 
possible. One man. 

You.

Key Features:

*PC DVD-ROM First Person Perspective dynamic adventure shooter powered by the advanced Argon 4 technology.

*Areas around the Prypiat, the city itself and the Chernobyl nuclear plant recreated.

*Vivid, living environments with plant life, animals, birds and atmospheric effects.

*Sophisticated enemy AI, allowing them to fight in groups, using different weapons and explosives, 
 alarming and supporting each other, using terrain and objects in their tactics.

*Explosive special effects.

*Convincing storyline and action objectives. The player is constantly in contact with his HQ, 
 which feeds him with data and changes mission objectives as he goes.

*As the technology is very well tested and the team consists of professionals with long 
 experience, the process of finishing, testing, localising and publishing the game should be most fluent.

During 11 levels, player has to cross from the outskirts of Prypiat, through the entire town up 
to the Chernobyl Power Plant. The enemies get tougher and tougher, using RPG, camouflage (snipers), 
helicopters and explosives. Gameplay gets intense, challenging - and fun.
