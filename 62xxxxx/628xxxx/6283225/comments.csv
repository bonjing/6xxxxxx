,cowidster,2011-06-24T11:09Z,"Use sandbox or AVAST 6 if you suspect the keygen contains virus. Thanks codyboys, this is the faster way to get the program and the key."
,darkgenacide,2011-09-12T00:44Z,"Well, my AVG said the keygen has backdoor virus. wtf CODY?!!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-09-28T13:51Z,"If you didn't know about false positive scannig results you know this from now! It's a false positive result!

If you don't trust using it directly open it sandboxed !!  

Use Sandboxie !!

@cowidster:

Thanks for your help and for your proof of trust !
