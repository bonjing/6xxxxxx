,looksthatkill,2011-04-02T01:17Z,Thanks!
,FX5,2011-04-02T02:47Z,"The band have leaked the whole album on the official site in high quality, why bother with this shite quality stream rip.
"
,iceache,2011-04-02T02:48Z,asd
,NeverFear33IsHere,2011-04-02T03:11Z,What is the quality like of this compared with the other one that is up on TPB?
,radioraupp,2011-04-02T03:40Z,"Valeu, rapรก!"
,iceache,2011-04-02T04:06Z,The quality should be the same... it's the 128kbps version... just re-encoded to 320kbps
,Freeagent13,2011-04-02T07:24Z,The copy of tje album i uploaded is better quality and is only half the size of this. It has also been up longer
,foosfan1,2011-04-02T09:13Z,"Guys, Sorry for trying to be helpful.  I don't know much about bit rates (in fact nothing at all).  I seen that the album was on their site/facebook so hit google looking for the first program to record streaming music. Then I recorded it in the highest bit rate as I know some people prefer the better quality.  I didn't know it as streamed over a lower bit rate.  freeagent - My copy is from the exact same source as yours so it will be the exact same. Just larger due to my lack of knowledge.

It fits on a CD ok and sounds fine in my car.  But its a stand in until the 11th April for when my copy comes in the post.

If anyone else has a proble, simply don't download and wait until the Album comes on out on the 11th (12th in the states) and buy your own perfect copy.  Or stream it online which will be fine for you if you don't want to listen to it out the house.

Thanks to everyone else who have shown there appreciation.  My first torrent and never thought I would end up with over 1k seeds overnight.  I'll keep seeding until the full album comes out. By that time someone else will probably have a better copy up anyway :-)  Thanks."
,Nideling,2011-04-02T10:07Z,tnks =) i know the songs are also on their facebook but.. you can't download those.. so..
,bil_gr7,2011-04-02T10:31Z,"Thanks dude, don't listen to the morons who are bitching, you did a great job and gave us the best quality possible! :)"
,Sebbepojken,2011-04-02T18:50Z,"Actually, it seems kind of stupid to manage a stream recording if you don't know what you're doing... I mean, Freeagent obviously has 128 kbps on his upload for a reason. 

It's far to common on sites such as this one that people just grab the release with the highest bit rate just because it looks better. But what you're getting here is about twice the size with absolutley no better quality. 

It's quite obvious that people are grabbing this one instead of Freeagent's just because it's newer and has a bigger size. The least you could do is to tell people that 50% of the data downloaded is just empty space. "
,foosfan1,2011-04-02T22:03Z,"Sebbepojken, read my comment its all there.  unfortunately I can't edit the description as the site won't allow it (not sure why) and I never said it was 320kbps, just that I recorded it with 320kbps, doesn't mean it is 320kbps.  And no its not stupid.  When I first went to put torrent on the site there was no other.  So at the time I was simply putting the torrent online for others to enjoy if they want to listen to it away from streaming.  because I had already done the work for my own personal use I seen no reason why not to upload for others to enjoy.  Ok the other user done it faster than me but thats the joys of the internet.  

People aren't sheep, if they don't want to download then thats fine.  And again, if you aren't happy with the download then fine, go download another copy or wait for the release and buy it, just like I will be doing in just over a week, but this will let me get by for now.  "
,k999fire,2011-04-03T08:18Z,Thank you and david grow
,countorlockiii,2011-04-03T13:02Z,"Cheers for the upload.
BTW who's Dave Grow?
lol.
Agreed that if ppl don't like the upload... THEN DON'T DOWNLOAD!"
,Sebbepojken,2011-04-03T13:57Z,"Well, without criticism (both positive and negative) on torrents, you won't get any improvements over time, since people settle with whatever gets uploaded. But I guess that's the 'beauty' of open sites like this one, that people just don't care about the quality and are happy to download twice as much as they need to. 

And oh, I haven't downloaded any of these torrents, I just recorded the whole thing by myself. So there's no need to give me all your ""If your're gonna have an opinion about the torrent, then don't touch it!"""
,foosfan1,2011-04-03T17:49Z,"Then don't comment on something you haven't tried yourself.

I think Dave Grow should be Dave Grohl."
,foosfan1,2011-04-03T17:54Z,"Can now buy from iTunes and stream over Spotify so I'm going to stop uploading.  Will keep torrent alive but I'll delete once it starts to die out.  If by any chance anyone gets stuck and really wants me to go back online with the torrent drop me a comment and I will start seeding again.  See no point now though as it can be bought.

Thanks to everyone and lets hope theres another album in another few years."
,bil_gr7,2011-04-03T22:01Z,"Sebbepojken I have 20GB on my mp3 player and 1 TB on my hard drive so I DON'T FUCKING CARE if the songs take up 100MB space when they should take 50MB. If you are so smart you can upload what you recorded yourself, until then I am grateful to anyone who has uploaded the album in a decent quality.

foofsfan1 thanks again man. :)"
,smilie1001,2011-04-04T16:40Z,"thanks for the upload, and crap on all the lousy whiners out there.

i just read a nice article about the new album and wanted a fast download. thats what i got here so thanks.

to all the whiners:
make a torrent with better quality and we will be thankful. until that moment: shut your traps and sit back in the corner"
,k999fire,2011-04-04T23:59Z,Fuck you foosfan1 and countorlockiii
,Clifdenboy,2011-04-05T02:03Z,Fucking Trolls! Cheers man for the upload!
,pelesfire,2011-04-05T20:42Z,thank you thank you thank you thank you foosfan1!! YIPPEEE! See you on April 11th :)))
,WhiteOprah,2011-04-07T05:08Z,I thought the quality was pretty good and this was the FIRST copy on PB.  Thanks foosfan1!  Well done.
,bmcrdr,2011-04-07T07:43Z,"foos rock, gonna buy the cd to support the boys but thanks for the up"
,andyabomb,2011-04-12T13:37Z,if you guys who are saying Dave Grow truly love foo fighters... you'd know that it's actually Dave Grohl. otherwise... this is an amazing day for me.
,Sebbepojken,2011-04-27T19:36Z,"To all of you people that whine on people that come with criticism:

You are just so funny! :D It's as simple as this: There is enough to have ONE (1) torrent with streamed contents like this. If the streamed content is in 128kbps, then that's the max quality you're getting. There is no use to upload any other torrent than this single one, if they all have the same source.

So you're all just talking BS when you tell me to upload my version myself. Because my original point was that there is enough to have a single torrent and also not to fool people that this one has a better quality with its wasteful extra bitrate. 

I'm trying to help people that put out good torrents as fast as possible. This is just a dupe that earns downloads by fooling people about the quality. "
,foosfan1,2011-05-19T20:19Z,"So everyone knows.

When I posted this it was the first copy online that had all the songs and all the songs in order.  I thought I was doing everyone a favor by uploading the highest quality I could.  I am a noob to stuff like this so I didn't know that when the program I used to record said it was recording in 320 that the original source was not 320.  And I have never said it is 320kbps.  Just that it was recorded with 320kps. sebb, you clearly cannot read so there is no point in moaning.  And it was the only copy available with all the songs and also in the correct order with no sound drops or issues with any of the songs for at least 3 weeks AFTER the album came out.  So almost 4 weeks in total as this was uploaded almost a week before the album came out.  I paid for the album when it came out though and I think anyone who does like them should also buy it therefore if you have a problem with this torrent.  Fine.  If you enjoy the music that is offered then it shouldn't matter as you should be supporting the artist so we can get another album."
,nobleguy,2011-05-31T23:42Z,"why sit here and whine about it, he said the bit rate is the best it is, let it go and just download and enjoy or dont download it no one really cares, GREAT job foosfan1 keep up the good work looking for them before they are released, sound good to me, im half deaf anyways so anything sounds great :D"
