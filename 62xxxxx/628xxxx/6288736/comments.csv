,User897,2011-04-02T07:39Z,Does this one have the same bullshit audio problems as the others?
,csabaxb,2011-04-02T07:48Z,Fast download and good quality. A/V-9. Thanx for the up.
,User897,2011-04-02T09:30Z,"This is definitely one of the better ones.  This one does NOT have the sync problem in the beginning, and the overall volume still has some clicking sounds and volume drops, but not near as bad as the others out there right now.

In a nutshell, this is the one to get until something better comes along.  Thank you TvTeam!"
,User897,2011-04-02T10:55Z,I take that back.  The second half of the film is the same as all the others.  Bad volume drops and climbs throughout.
,dragonfly2332,2011-04-02T14:55Z,Thanks TvTeam!
,chuckyno1,2011-04-02T22:33Z,When I was trying to play it on my ps3 it did not work. After 5 min an message was shown that said roughly that I didn't own the right to see this video. but it worked on my dvdplayer.
