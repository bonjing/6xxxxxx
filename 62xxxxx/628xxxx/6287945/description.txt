Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTE: Hour 3 I missed the initial intro music, but I caught it when Glenn was still doing the tease.  I didn't miss enough to justify waiting 3 hours for the rebroadcast so I'm uploading it like this.  Enjoy and have a great weekend!
