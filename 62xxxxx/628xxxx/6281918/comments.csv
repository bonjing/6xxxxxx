Thanks anyway"

Saved games are kept in a folder with this filepath:

C:\ProgramData\PopCap Games\#YOURGAME#\userdata.

Some of them are kept here:

C:\ProgramData\PopCap Games\#YOURGAME#\userdata.

Both of these folders are hidden, thus you will have to enable the ""view hidden folders"" option in the Control Panel to see them.

The point is, the save games do not travel from one pc to another. They will remain on one computer unless you move them, and if you take the portable installation to another pc all of your progress will be lost. That is just the way these games operate, I can't fix it.

You should have no problem at all saving your games or highscores as long as you only play on 1 computer. That is all."

I meant to say in above post, some of them are kept here:

C:\ProgramData\SpinTop Games\#YOURGAME#\userdata."
