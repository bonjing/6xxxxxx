,kausali,2011-04-04T07:28Z,Does this include the ability to save games?
,reznor_ms,2011-04-06T11:03Z,"Are those DLC updated? (Witch Hunt v1.1, etc...) Also I got the error ""unable to load area"" with""Return to Ostagar""."
,B3ff3ct,2011-04-06T16:54Z,"Need help here.  How do you play the witch hunt, return to ostagar?   One of my DA character has completed origins, how do I continue to play specifically these DLCs, the other DLC is updating via my quest but not the ones i have mentioned.  any help would be appreciated.

thanks!"
,reznor_ms,2011-04-07T15:06Z,"@B3ff3ct: For return to ostagar, you need to go in a new place that appears on the map (cant remembe the name now sorry!). For Witch Hunt, selcet ""other campaign"" (or like that) from the main menu, its a separate campaign not just an addon."
,illiria,2011-04-13T02:43Z,"Witch Hunt is version 1.1.

""Unable to load area"" bug occasionally happens, yes. It is a very common bug, but I don't know what it is related to. I've never had it. Some people have it, others don't, I've no idea why. Try using an earlier save. Other than that, I can't advise much."
,rickyl3,2011-05-19T07:20Z,Is the Blood Dragon Armor the updated version that works with female elves?
,rickyl3,2011-05-19T09:33Z,Nevermind. I downloaded it and found that it isn't.
,rickyl3,2011-05-19T20:35Z,"I don't suppose you'd be willing to make a version that has version 1.1 of the armor? For whatever reason, the normal decrypt process doesn't work on my system for the updated armor version."

,Crazer20,2011-10-26T17:20Z,"Okay, i downloaded it and installed. When i enter the game it doesn't have the DLC's in the DLC menu. I'm not stupid, i know why this is happening. It's because of the addins.xml. I open it up, and it's got nothing in it (i dont have any other dlc/mods nistalled). Can someone please send me it? PLEASE?"
