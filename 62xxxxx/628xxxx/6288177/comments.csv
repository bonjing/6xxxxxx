Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Comments:
Too much fixed on the personal story, not about the big picture and the global strategy. The movie had the potential of showing the strategic and military view of the story but did not do anything about it. Too much ""Heoric"" like in ""2012"" Sewers like in ""Alien VS Predator"" althow the aliens realli look like those in ""District 9"" with the technology of ""Predators"".  Army feedback like in ""Green Zone"" and in ""Transformers I"".

Very watchable, but a little ""clichÃ©"", considering all the movie releases in the last 10 years."

Talk that there is a patch for Cinavia coming out soon. APB ( http://www.apiratesbook.com ) is supposed to be working on it. Something to do with the trancodeing process on the computer side. So, I think you will only be able to stream movie with the cinavia check.

Great movie.

,Fallen_Gri,2011-04-04T16:28Z,LOL. well they finally did it. This film is protected by Cinavia which means that it will not play on some devices. In my case the PS3. Cinavia is a audio watermarking technique which in my opinion works great xP. I haven't tried it ona PC yet but it certainly has put a dent into my viewing platforms. Oh well good on them I suppose. Lest I have already seen the film in theatre. But still....beware b4 you download.

A Near PERFECT Release.

Thanks To Those Who Did The Work.

And..I will say this:

'A GOOD PIRATE..NEVER QUITS'.

The ""Movie""?

Gulp! A Basic ""Hollywood Math"" Project that can be summed up quite succinctly as LITERALLY..the Following:

(Effects) ""District 9"" +

(Plot) ""Independence Day"" +

(Plot and PROPAGANDA VALUE) ""Blackhawk Down""

= ""Battle: Los Angeles"".

No Shiznit Folks.the ""Effects"" are STRAIGHT-Up the ""New Era Realism"" of ""District 9"".

The Plot EVEN SOME DIALOGUE..is Literally..No Exaggeration..Word For Word..""Independence Day"" and ""Blackhawk Down"".

This is Above ALL ELSE..a PROPAGANDA FILM.

The ""Enemy From Without""..the ""BARELY DEFINABLE/DEFINED ENEMY"" Which ""We"" Must ""Battle"" at ALL COSTS.

It is a Military Propaganda and ""Hoo-Rah"" Film of the FIRST Order.

And as such..is truly..MAGGOT RIDDEN!

This ""Movie""..is a LIE in the form of a ""Story"" and ""Entertainment"". In the event of ANYthing like ""Invasion""..""Our"" Military will be a grim nightmare of rights violating abuse and murder..theft..torture and DEATH..NOT..Heroic ""Saving"" of ""Civilians"".but 'TSA' like Torture and Murder of ""Civilians"".

Enjoy!"

Now I don't own the sequel nor can i find it in the store . Every torrent that I have managed to find is copy's of the same 2 . one is in Italian and English playing at the same time , the other is missing the 1st 11 minutes. Could some1 find it in there heart to locate this fine sequel and upload it so that ever1 can see it ? and on another note if you haven't seen the lawnmower man, its a must see from 1992 ! plz some1 upload lawnmower man 2: Jobe's War or Lawnmower man 2 : Beyond Cyberspace .!!!!!!!

,cooljoey1356,2011-07-09T04:45Z,How does the R5 have more seeders than the DVD rip?

The movie has Cinavia protection. Its a sound that people can't hear but certain devices like the PS3 can detect. If a certain code isn't detected within the video, the PS3 will just stop playing it."

A:7(faint scratching 3 separate times, but good overall)
V:9(very good quality)
The movie itself is good, if you give it a chance. I enjoyed it."

,NecroFile,2011-07-26T06:47Z,If you're on comcast stay away from this and other Battle LA torrents; they're being monitored and even PeerBlock/PG doesn't seem to stop them from connecting to you and informing your ISP.
,a_h0b0,2011-07-29T23:15Z,audio is shit. volume keeps fluctuating. 
,snowbirds,2011-08-08T06:23Z,"Rarely is government propaganda so obvious.  This movie must have been funded entirely by the US military.  There really isn't much of a movie here.  It's mainly a message. 

Here is the message: we should trust the leader who has gotten a bunch of people killed and who may get us killed.  If we doubt this leader, it is because we lack faith.  The leader is an honorable person who is doing his best for us.

This message is for US military men who are dying for no good reason, to boost their morale.  This message is for the American voter who sees that all our political leaders are full of shit.  In both cases this movie tells us to ignore our feelings of concern, and to follow our leaders blindly..."
,eldiab13,2011-08-12T00:59Z,yup - i got a letter from my ISP from frikin Sony ... don't know how they got around all my anon measures but they did - besides this movie sucks

,SuperxTorrentxSeeder,2011-09-09T06:53Z,"Great movie, nice action scenes but I felt the graphics and some of the actors were a bit cheesy I rate it a 7/10"
,ashen77,2011-09-30T01:20Z,why dah fook is as an old R5 in the top 100 when theres a DVD rip out there?

,sourceofreality,2011-12-19T08:00Z,"yea, hey, thank you for the up and all.I appreciate the effort, but the folks giving this 9 & 10 audio rating, apparently, have lousy speakers. the audio is not good. Video is great; A+ on that. I'm waiting for another download, I just gotta have good audio or it ruins the movie. The audio has a high soundfloor, noise and scratching. The audio is a 5, in my book. I mean if it was like some old ass great hendrix undiscovered bootleg, i'd be down, but bad audio for a climactic picture, is no good. Thanks for the up. Sorry, but I'm a choosy beggar. :D LOL!"
