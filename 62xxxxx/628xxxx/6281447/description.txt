         The gang decides to go on a road trip to try and sell Ben's   
         car, but when Ben lets Kate drive his car he says "I love     
         you" for the first time, causing Kate to accidentally crash   
          the car and forcing everyone to share a room for the night.

         Proper notes: LOL's release has some sort of feed problem     
         from 12:18-14:09 resulting in random lines showing up on      
         the screen, lots of duplicate frames (bad IVTC), and the      
         picture appearing to bounce up and down. Sample included      
         for comparison. Go frame-by-frame in theirs to see the        
          problems.
