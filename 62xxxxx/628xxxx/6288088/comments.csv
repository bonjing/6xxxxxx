Last time I looked it had 12 seeders.  I downloaded Shaolin from him earlier today and it's quality seems to be quite good."

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-02T07:59Z,"@the_shroud: Well my friend, that's why advise NOT to even look my torrents so old - Feb. 23. is probably more than 100 torrents (and maybe 500 encodes) back. Low-quantity uploaders are better choice for older stuff."

Now I can replace my old avi-copy that have some lousy audio."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-02T10:01Z,@srikk1786: Not released yet. You can guess why.
,theaetetus,2011-04-02T22:51Z,"The best thing about this upload is the video quality: at many times when watching this, it seemed three dimensional. I don't recall ever seeing that before. It must have to do with the contrast between Jeff Bridges' body in the foreground and the beautiful azure sea in the background. I can't believe the encoding got 7 negative votes.

As for the movie itself, it's Out of the Past (1947) fused with Miami Vice. It would have been a totally unnecessary remake if it wasn't for the beautiful photography."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-03T08:07Z,"Thanks, especially to theaetetus."
