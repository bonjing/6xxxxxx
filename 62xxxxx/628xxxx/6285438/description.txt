Shift 2: Unleashed career mode is called\"entertaining and interactive\". Shift 2: Unleashed redefines the racing simulator genre by delivering authentic and true-to-life, dynamic crash physics, plus intricately detailed real-world cars, drivers and tracks.

As the car comes up to higher speeds, the edges of the screen will become blurred to simulate the tunnel-vision effect that drivers suffer when racing
