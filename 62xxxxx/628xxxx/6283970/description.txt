Follow the yellow brick road! Released in 1978 with much fanfare, this spectacular, big-budget 'Motown' remake of The Wizard of Oz with America's best black actors, singers and comics, takes place in the neon-soaked streets of downtown New York. With spirited performances from superstars Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Richard Pryor and its fair share of lively Motown-styled musical numbers, Jackson's producer Quincy Jones augments the songs from the hit Broadway musical with a few tunes of his own. Highlights include "The Emerald City Ballet" routine and a rousing "Everybody Rejoice".
