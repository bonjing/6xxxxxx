,doragon69,2011-12-26T01:50Z,"i've noticed that the file ""59 XFM - 02.04.06.mp3"" is mislabeled and should be in the 51 slot as date 04.02.06
of course, if you intend to continue seeding, don't rename #59 as that will force the torrent to check itself for errors and re-download anything you've changed. a simple copy of 59 and renaming the copy appropriately is how i'm keeping things in order

just a note for anyone listening to them in order, like i was, when i got to #59"
