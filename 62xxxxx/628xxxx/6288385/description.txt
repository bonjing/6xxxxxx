DAVE HOLE SHORT FUSE BLUES
Label: Alligator
Released:1992
Format:Mp3@320



Dave Hole's American debut album is a stunning display of slide guitar pyrotechnics. Hole runs through a dizzying array of licks and solos, pulling out a variety of different tones and textures from his guitar. He can play it straight and greasy, or spooky, tough and gritty, or subtle and melodic -- his technique is quite impressive. Although the songs themselves are occasionally weak, Short Fuse Blues is essentially a guitar record, so the songs don't matter as much as the playing. And the playing is superb throughout. ~ Thom Owens
