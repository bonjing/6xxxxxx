April 23rd in America, the date for the British premiĂ¨re hasn't been released, but it's likely to be earlier."
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-02T22:04Z,"yeah i heard they were doing the dual thing this year with uk and usa, now i thought it was march they were doing the uk release. Trust me I'm an addict to, have been since i started watching in the 80's and i know that just the tip of the ice berg. I wanna know what the hell Riversong is all about and what she said to Tennant as well. LOL"

Same start date in Britain and USA, 23 April although probably a few hours earlier in Britain because of time zones."
,PrimalFear,2011-04-20T20:07Z,"Yeah I D/L as soon as UK shows it cuz its usually first there, guess they copped on, they have been advertising it like hell over here in the US, getting allot of US fans which is good for the show so we should see more seasons"
