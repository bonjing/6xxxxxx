DAVID HONEYBOY EDWARDS BLUES BLUES
Released:1975
Label: Document
Format:Mp3@320


Although Honey Boy remained in the background, as the blues of the rural southern states experienced its mixed fortunes of popularity, from the heydays of the nineteen twenties and thirties, to its obscurity of the fifties, through to the revivals of the sixties and eighties when it found its permanent place in global music, he has remained throughout an active performer and true to his cause.

This CD, originally issued on the Austrian label Roots and never very easy to find, was recorded in Vienna in 1975 and it certainly proves that he is a fine artist in his own right â€“.

Honeyboy is captured solo in the studio for these recordings at the end of his winter tour, at the age of sixty. He plays a little rack harmonica on several numbers, but mostly this is Edwards the Delta bluesman, confident vocalist and down home guitarist on a programme of varied Mississippi blues, and with â€˜Sweet Home Chicagoâ€™ the only Robert Johnson number in his repertoire for this session. Yes, his style is derivative, but surely that is an integral part of the Blues tradition he represents, one he did indeed learn first-hand. Agreed, this may not be the most dynamic performance there is, but this is a genuine Mississippi born and raised bluesman playing the music he grew up with. As such, it is an important document (pun intended).
