The latest drivers for Acer TravelMate 220 series laptops, up-to-date by April 2011, and most probably forever :)

The official Acer support page is missing some of the drivers, or there are older versions than these. There are newer versions of drivers available for some of the devices, but they don't work on TM laptops anymore.

Tested on TravelMate 223X, and it works great !
