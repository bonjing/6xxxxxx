PLOT:
Experience a Wolverine Origins movie closer to continuity, involving
Logan's attempts with Professor X to restore his fragmented mind.
Completely removes all mentions, references and conversations
indicating Wolverine and Sabertooth being related. Completely
removes all plot threads regarding Logan volunteering for the
Weapon X program.
Many action scenes tightened, removing over the top elements.
Removes Silver Fox having mutant powers and being Emma Frost's
sister. Weapon XI: Stryker's pet project, a merge of many mutants'
powers to create their antithesis; this character is now stand alone
and not a bad adaptation.
Japan epilogue included following the current Marvel movie trend.
