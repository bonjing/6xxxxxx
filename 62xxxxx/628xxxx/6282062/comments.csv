,DMVIN,2011-03-30T10:28Z,"hi 20-40
if its not asking too much, cud u pls seed the middle s02 a bit more?

thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-30T11:07Z,"@DMVIN: Sorry, I cannot. It was 12 torrents ago, I've seeded The Middle for four days non-stop, in total ""just"" 134.8 GB (approx. 100 packs) for one damn torrent. Say warm ""Thanks"" to hundred Hit&Runers - and understand why I am not crazy about season-torrents (contrary what fans of some show say, it's just another Grab&Run game). I deleted it last night, BTW."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-30T11:25Z,"@peeyoosh: Thank you. As all people know (or should learn) IF ONE [CHOOSE] TO DOWNLOAD JUST 352P - HE WOULD SEED - JUST THAT. But, based on my long, long years of experience, target-audience of extremely small-sized encodes, by nature, cannot seed, or don't want to.

ALL MY ""REGULARS"" KNOW THAT, THIS [CHOOSE] TAG SPEAKS NOT JUST ABOUT NECESSITY TO CHOOSE WHAT WOULD BE DOWNLOADED, BUT KNOW THAT THEY WOULD ONLY SEED THINGS THEY HAVE DOWNLOADED FROM SPECIFIC TORRENT.

[CHOOSE] IMPLIES PIECE OF BRAIN.

GENEROUS PEOPLE ALWAYS DOWNLOAD WHOLE TORRENT, AND SEED AFTERWARD, HELPING THE LESS FORTUNATE ONES.

ABOUT ""HIT&RUN"" MENTALITY I SPEAK FREQUENTLY."
,DMVIN,2011-03-30T11:40Z,"I can understand your frustration. I got 60% and now am stuck :(

Anyways thanks for keeping it up for 2 extra days for me. If anyone else has downloaded it please seed for a few days."
,cazo_lo,2011-03-30T12:38Z,"Dear twentyforty,
thanks alot for bring this fine piece back to alive, and you did it very well, and so quikly! faster that I thought. A outstanding Job on doing request - you do good! Yo mate I can tell you, you a very special, a legend, and you work hard for it. maybe we talk again next time, thanks for doing this."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-30T13:05Z,"@DMVIN: About 112 pairs of ears should hear that - but, I know, just a few would.

@cazo_lo: You're welcome."
,hardik_860,2011-03-30T14:12Z,"will u pls upload against all odds ?
 ....bluray is out.."
,srikk1786,2011-03-30T15:16Z,"dude cn u do ""the way back"" plssss...................."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-30T15:41Z,"@hardik_860: Which one? Guessing game is not the way how request should be placed. Not here.

@srikk1786: The same. Google name+imdb."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-30T16:30Z,"@DMVIN
Have been seeding it nearly constantly since I downloaded it.  Generally do until 1.66, or when HDD demands consolidation, whichever comes first."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-30T16:49Z,"@Shailesh417
http://thepiratebay.org/search/deep%20impact/0/99/200
30 encodes are available, including 4 hi-res H264s with many seeders.  Doing another one would seem to me somewhat redundant."
,htctouch,2011-03-30T19:47Z,i have this movie but jst cmnting coz this is an amazing movie must watch
,froglog,2011-03-30T20:18Z,Thank you
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-31T11:03Z,"@peeyoosh:  I wish (silly me) that 98% of the people go someplace else. I don't like encoding movies, especially requested ones, but those I don't like or must go to unimaginable lengths to obtain (most unappreciated thing - making and upping torrent is three seconds).

When I started, many years ago - three other guys and me were alone in encoding extra small sized stuff. I am only one that is still active today.
Then, others appeared. Better than me. And I wish all go there. 

Every now and then, but every few days, some new people came out of the woodwork, and have Columbus syndrome: America WAS discovered by Columbus - NOT CREATED. 

I do NOT encode from moment some moron pops-out and say ""Let see what we have here"".

AND - I do NOT comment work of other encoders. I deep  in my heart bear the thought that all do remarkable job.

PLEASE - do NOT post link to other encoders  ""home"" page - that is RUDE, called ADVERTISING on other people's threads, and very often people get banned for this.

P.S.: Forgive me that I have not made all letters big this time. I had a friend who was very sick, have troubles with reading tiny letters and I know how hard is for you too."
,abciscrazy,2011-03-31T14:54Z,"that was kinda rude mate.

,prank0007,2011-03-31T15:31Z,thnks 4 this past glimse
,jon4fun,2011-04-01T04:23Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon

I have seen this before but a 20-40 encode is worth the DL and seeding."
,bragazar1710,2011-07-16T15:24Z,thanks.
