,redactedwv,2011-04-02T05:11Z,"Thx again, FxG/seeders - Sincerely appreciated.

If anyone's into it, there's a pretty cool little doc called 'The Real Kings Speech' that would fit with this on a disc. I got it from EZ under the name 'Ch4 The Real Kings Speech', but it's probably everywhere. Worth checking out, if you liked this movie."

,clint513,2011-04-17T13:12Z,can someone tell me how do you include subtitles to a movie that you want to put on dvd  please explain thanks so much
,p.joker,2011-04-19T15:47Z,thank you
,redactedwv,2011-04-19T23:35Z,"can't seem to post this....been trying, but it's been giving me trouble. If this ends up being quadruple-posted, i hope a mod will be kind enough to clean up my bullshit. Thx/srry

--------

@ clint513:

Many do this differently (in terms of the programs used), but this works for me...

- Get a BitTorrent client (i use Vuze)

- Get an encoder (i use ConvertXtoDVD... There's always a good clean ver somewhere on tpb)

- Download the seed/torrent that you're interested in using your BitTorrent program. Remember to seed the file after it finishes to keep it going.

A few intrepid heroes always include subs (like the always dependable FxG), but often you have to go find them (Subscene for movies, Addic7ed for TV. There are other trustworthy sub sites, but those 2 will take care of you most of the time). Find the sub you want and download it - make sure you have the right version for the specific movie/tv file you've downloaded.

.srt is one of the most common sub formats. 

Take the .srt file you got and place in the same folder as the movie/tv show you downloaded with your client. Give the files the same name.

 Meaning, if the movie is 'Clint513's Big Movie', you'll need to see 2 files in your working folder: Clint513's Big Movie.avi & Clint513's Big Movie.srt

ConvertX allows you to name the disc and tweak some other preferences, but you don't have to mess with all that right away. Learn the more nuanced stuff later.

Make sure your drive has free space, as the encoded ver will be several times larger than the source file.

Start the encoder.

Once it's encoded, use your burning software to burn it (ConvertX does both).

This is the easy-peasy version...You don't actually have to rename the files themselves or put them in the same folder, and there are obviously other file formats apart from avi/srt, but i tried to keep it as simple as possible.

I'll check back later to see if this was clear enough. Good luck!"

,Hipirates,2011-04-21T09:45Z,you are the best FXG....................
,michaelrwatson,2011-04-21T21:47Z,"WHY does this include subtitles? Isn't this movie in English?? If there are foreign parts, they should be hardcoded so you don't have to go prowling the whole friggin web for English-only subs that work with a particular release."
,redactedwv,2011-04-22T03:39Z,"I was checking back to see if this clint dude ever came back (hey clint...might want to switch up your user names...you're leaving a huge trail, if it matters), but i can't leave this sub thing from michaelrwatson alone.

""WHY does this include subtitles? Isn't this movie in English??""

Why the hell are you asking? Who cares? If you don't need them, don't use them - they take up no memory whatsoever, and you don't have to download the sub with the avi anyway.

But to address your question.... Maybe you haven't gotten the word, but some people aren't blessed with the ability to hear.

 Y'know...Deaf people? Heard of them? 

There are lots of reasons to include subs, other than for the benefit of the deaf - hard to understand accents (even if eng is ur 1st language, & especially if it isn't), lots of background noise, all kinds of stuff.

 I don't know why FxG is always so good about it, but as someone who watches about half of what i download with a deaf person, i for one sincerely appreciate their inclusion. It's a very cool/admirable thing for FxG to take the time to do. For their size, FxG's ups set the standard as far as i'm concerned - and the subs are 1 of the many reasons why.

 Anybody that bitches about something that... a) helps people b) they don't have to download if they don't want to (even as a seeder of the movie itself), and c) is provided free to begin with ...is truly friggin clueless. In my opinion."
,Rictor2k,2011-04-22T08:13Z,"redactedwv is 100% correct. The subtitles help me understand the movie much better than I normally would. I'm not deaf, but have some hearing loss, and having the subtitles included saves me from having to search for them at subscene. 

With subs, I understand the movie completely. Heck I have friends with perfect hearing who even use subtitles, mainly so they don't miss the slightest thing in a movie. Since my friends and I like to read books also, it is pretty normal.  

Like redactedwv also said, you can simply remove or unselect the .srt file from your download if you don't want the subs."
,Houlala,2011-04-23T18:09Z,"Guys, thank you so much for the movie... and the subtitles!"

Never had a problem with FXG_Team's downloads before."
