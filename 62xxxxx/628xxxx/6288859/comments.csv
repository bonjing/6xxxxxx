,kamara,2011-04-02T19:38Z,Just finished download - its real. Click on magnet link to download and it works fine in vlc

,lush1961,2011-04-05T10:54Z,"Hi tried to download but got the same message as Gabata so followed Sean1974 advice but got this message (Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (magnet) isn't associated with any program.) so how do I download it now please anyone know. Thanks"
