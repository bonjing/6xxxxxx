
EARLYTOBED was founded on HammarÃ¶, Sweden in the summer of 2005. Ole, Fredrik, Jonas, Dan (first bass-player) and Marcus started the band via shattered previous music-constellations. ETB was born. 
With the first ever self-entitled, self-released EP (2005), including first versions of songs such as â€œWithout Youâ€ and â€œObsoleteâ€, things took a good start. ETB got out to play a bunch of local shows and after a while some of the major summer-festivals in Sweden got in touch and got the band over to play. In 2006 the band decided to create another EP. Time turns fast when you put all youâ€™ve got in to it and the 2nd EP was written. 2nd bassist BjÃ¶rn a.k.a. â€œBJâ€ replaced Dan just before the scheduled studio-time. â€œIâ€™ll chase the ache awayâ€ (2007) included the hit-song â€œFalling Downâ€ and got the band a managament-deal. Bad Taste Records signed the band up and the band somehow got real. The musical climate in Sweden at the time was a bit restricted. ETB got their fair share of good gigs, but they felt that a change of surroundings was desperately needed. Moving collectively to GÃ¶teborg, Sweden took things a step further. 
Months flew by and the band got in the studio to record their first full-length. BJ got out, current bass-man Nils Holm joined in. The album, which was totally self-financed, was an album built on chance and hope. ETB took a leap, without a record-deal. Fortunately, Howling Bull Records (Japan) had their eyes open for ETB and signed the band to release their debut-album â€œThe Phantomimeâ€. 
The two yet un-official EPs was melted down to one, the official release; â€œThe Mime EPâ€. It was released worldwide in 2009, digitally, via Itunes. â€œThe Mime Epâ€ contains the song â€œMicrophobiaâ€, opening track of â€œThe Phantomimeâ€. The band has never been more exited, energetic and hungry. ETBs debut-album is released on January 13th 2010 in Japan. Rest of the world? Just you wait.
