SMASH is the reference Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS), Logic
and Mixed-Signal (LMS) and All-in-One Simulator enabling
truthfully the combination of digital, logic and analog
multi-domain modeling with no need for a cosimulation
backplane, as well as Instruction Set Simulation (ISS).
Moreover, the extensive support of design kits and foundry
model parameter sets is regularly enhanced with new and
emerging SPICE device model implementations (Level 49, from
BSIM 3 to BSIM 4v6, EKV, ACM, MM9, VBIC, MEXTRAM, JUNCAP2,
PSP).
