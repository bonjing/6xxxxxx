Unarmed combat is as old as mankind itself,making boxing one of the oldest sports thats still exists today...............................................

Boxing faced crucial changes in 1867.Gloves were introduced,scoring would be by 3 minute rounds  and the referee had ultimate authority.It was the 8th Marquis of Queensbury thatwas instrumental in creating these changes to the sport so itwas,that in 1884 that the first world championship was held under "Queensbury Rules"


Dont just watch the first black champion, Jack Johnson, in action and the great contest between Sugar Ray Robinson and Carl "bobo" Olson, but read about weather Max Schmeling really was a nazi and why many considered Joe Louis to be "the greatest of them all..................................................................
