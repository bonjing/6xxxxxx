I have a request for you , Can you please upload LOST tv series all Season in 720p in smaller size ? I asked you because I can't find any other uploader on net who is willing to accept my request .
I want this Tv show very Badly . Also there is no torrent for LOST on the net whose size is less than 20 GB per season .

Awaiting your Reply
