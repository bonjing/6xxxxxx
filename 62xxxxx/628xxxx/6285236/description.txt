A woman who says she was raped by forces loyal to Libyan Col. Muammar Gaddafi remains missing five days after she was arrested for bursting into a hotel full of international reporters in Tripoli and recounting her ordeal. The woman, Eman al-Obeidi, said she had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 of Gadaffi's men. Obeidi's face and legs were bruised and she had blood on her right thigh. We speak with journalist Mona Eltahawy about sexual assaults against Libyan women under the Gaddafi regime.


- Supreme Court Weighs Massive Suit Accusing Retail Giant Wal-Mart of Sexual Discrimination Against Female Workers

The U.S. Supreme Court has heard arguments on whether a massive class action sexual discrimination lawsuit can move forward against retail giant Wal-Mart. Current and former female employees say they were given lower pay and promoted less often than their male counterparts. We speak with former Wal-Mart manager and plaintiff Stephanie Odle, who says she is pursuing the case to change the company's corporate culture, and the workers' attorney Joseph Sellers. "We found in this case evidence of gender stereotypes about women I have rarely seen," says Sellers. "They really are a throwback to the world of the 1950s."
