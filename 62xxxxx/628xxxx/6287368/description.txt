In Histories of Infamy,  Cristian Roa-de-la-Carrera explores Francisco Lopez de Gomaraâ€™s (1511-ca.1559) attempt to ethically reconcile Spainâ€™s civilizing mission with the conquistadorsâ€™ abuse and exploitation of Native peoples.

The most widely read account of the conquest in its time, Gomara's Historia general de las Indias y Conquista de Mexico rationalized the conquistadors' crimes as unavoidable evils in the task of bringing "civilization" to the New World. Through an elaborate defense of Spanish imperialism, Gomara aimed to convince his readers of the merits of the conquest, regardless of the devastation it had wrought upon Spain's new subjects.

Despite his efforts, Gomara's apologist text quickly fell into disrepute and became ammunition for Spain's critics. Evaluating the effectiveness of ideologies of colonization, Roa-de-la-Carrera's readable analysis will fascinate readers and scholars interested in the history of the Americas.
