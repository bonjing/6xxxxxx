My thanks to the original seeder for the DVD files from which these tracks were taken.   Keeping the original VOB (DVD) image and audio quality, I have split them into music tracks and tagged them correctly so they are good for import into the Video Discotheque playback software of your choice.   Enjoy.

You should get a great download speed as this is hosted by a T1 50mbps seed box in Toronto.
