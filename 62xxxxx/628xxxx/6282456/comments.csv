,RSObelix,2011-05-08T09:26Z,"@biffbaffler
I had my share of them so called ""false"" positives... Half of them actually made my PC crash."
,RSObelix,2011-05-08T09:29Z,"Oh, by the way, I should add to that:
- This is probably not a virus, some of the scanners report it as a keygen.
- Half is maybe a bit strong... more like 25%.
- I always love the music that comes with keygens =P"
