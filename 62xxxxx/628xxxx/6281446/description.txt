BBC 23 Week Babies The Price of Life PDTV x264 AAC MVGroup

Documentary presented by Adam Wishart about babies born four months early - in the 23rd week of pregnancy - exist on the very edge of life. A few go on to become the 'miracle babies' of glossy magazines, but most die. Award-winning director Adam Wishart has unprecedented access to the babies born in such extreme prematurity on a Birmingham neonatal unit, and asks the difficult question: is it always right to keep them alive?
