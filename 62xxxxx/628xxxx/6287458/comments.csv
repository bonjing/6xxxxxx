This assembly is protected by an unregistered version of Eziriz's "".NET Reactor""!"

Someone has manipulated the SkidRow-crack. To solve this ""fake"":
1. Delete ""HOMEFRONT.exe"".
2. Rename ""HOMEFRONT.dll"" to ""HOMEFRONT.exe"".
3. Start game with ""Launcher.exe"".

Or get the ORIGINAL SkidRow-crack."
