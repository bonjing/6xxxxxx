The School for Scandal is a play written by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. It was first performed in London at Drury Lane Theatre on May 8, 1777.
The prologue, written by David Garrick, commends the play, its subject, and its author to the audience. (Garrick was Sheridan's predecessor as manager of Drury Lane.)

London society matron Lady Sneerwell (Patricia Connolly) loves to gossip and spends her free time engaged in manipulation. When she selfishly derails the romance of Charles Surface (Kenneth Welsh), her scheming unexpectedly creates a ripple effect among her well-to-do acquaintances. Blair Brown, Bernard Behrens and Larry Gates co-star in this 1975 Broadway production of one of the theater world's great drawing room comedies.
