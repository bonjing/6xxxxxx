Hello there! This is my first torrent upload, but I think it's worth it!

This is a package containing all, if not most, of the music from the first three Crash Bandicoot games [Playstation 1]

I converted them all from PSF format into high quality MP3s.
I then had to take on the tedious job of going through each file and naming them correctly.
I don't know the specifics of the files, I just know that they sound good!

All music composed by Mutato Muzika.

If you loved the music from these games, you will love this download!

Happy downloading!
