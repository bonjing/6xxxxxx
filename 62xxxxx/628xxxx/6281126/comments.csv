,hatedrain,2011-06-16T12:26Z,I found that I could get most of my satisfaction from just skipping ahead to 34 min and until satisfied and then again around 115min if you want to completely bypass the creepy people who do most of the dialog in the documentary. Ironically this documentary makes me more horny then anything else and I am a chick.  Maybe if they made the sex scenes less sexy this movie would make sense.
