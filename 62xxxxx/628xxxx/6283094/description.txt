Tales of the Unexpected is a British television series originally aired between 1979 and 1988, made by Anglia Television for ITV.

The series was an anthology of different tales. Initially episodes were based on the short stories collected in the books Tales of the Unexpected, Kiss Kiss and Someone Like You by Roald Dahl.

The stories were sometimes sinister, sometimes wryly comedic, and usually had a twist ending.

The theme music for the series was written by Ron Grainer.

The series originally adapted various stories from Dahl's anthology books. Despite the low budget the series attracted guest stars of the highest calibre, such as Brian Blessed, Anna Neagle, Timothy West, Rod Taylor, John Gielgud, Elaine Stritch, John Mills, Julie Harris, Wendy Hiller, Ian Holm, Joan Collins, Joseph Cotten, Derek Jacobi, Janet Leigh, Andrew Ray, SiobhÃ¡n McKenna and Cyril Cusack.

Dahl introduced all of his own stories himself, giving short monologues explaining what inspired him to write the story.

Although many of Dahl's stories are left open to reader's interperetation, the television series usually provided a conclusion to the story. For example, in the Dahl story "The Landlady", the character of Billy's ultimate fate is only hinted at, whereas in the TV version we are shown that the Landlady in question really has poisoned and preserved the guests of her bed and breakfast, and Billy is to suffer the same fate.

Midway through the second series, episodes ceased to be written by Dahl and other authors' stories were adapted for all episodes following. The title reflected this when it became Tales of the Unexpected - Introduced by Roald Dahl. From series three, Dahl no longer introduced the stories and the series continued this way until the end.

By 1988, critics felt that the quality of the series was starting to dip, and after the ninth series in 1988, the series was axed.

In the US, John Houseman succeeded Dahl as the opening narrator.

In 2006, ITV3 began repeating the series. Series 1 to 8 have been released on DVD.

In 1980, Peter Cook starred alongside a host of celebrities in the LWT special "Peter Cook & Co.". The show included many sketches including a Tales of the Unexpected spoof titled "Tales Of The Much As We Expected", which involved Cook as Roald Dahl explaining why he dropped the "n" in Ronald, the sketch ends with the fireplace spreading over the room.

Dahl had hosted a practically identical series for the American CBS network called Way Out in 1961, which was similar in concept and themes to Twilight Zone for 14 episodes on Saturday nights and actually used some stories which would later be adapted for Tales of the Unexpected. Dahl later published series for many other TV shows that became his.
