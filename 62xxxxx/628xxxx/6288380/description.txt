Publishing Video with the Flash Platform
Author: Lisa Larson-Kelley

In Publishing Video with the Flash Platform, Lisa Larson-Kelley
demonstrates how to build a Flash video player and publish video
online, without the use of custom ActionScript code. The course
guides web site developers through the video publishing process
in distinct projects of increasing complexity. Each project
results in a fully-functional video player, embedded into an
HTML page and ready to publish online. Exercise files are
included with the course

Topics include:

* Converting a video for Flash playback
* Using the Adobe Media Encoder
* Adding custom metadata to a video
* Building a custom player with the FLVPlayback component
* Embedding video in a web page
* Adding navigation cue points
* Publishing with Flash Media and Strobe Media Playback
* Uploading files to a web server
