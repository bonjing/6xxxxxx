This is what I like to call a complete collection of Twisted Metal, for PSone, PS2, and PSP.  The language for all games as far as I know is just NTSC-U.

This torrent contains the following games:
Twisted Metal (PSone)
Twisted Metal 2 (PSone)
Twisted Metal III (PSone)
Twisted Metal 4 (PSone)
Twisted Metal Small Brawl (PSone)
Twisted Metal Black (PS2)
Twisted Metal Black Online (PS2)
Twisted Metal Head On (PSP)
Twisted Metal Head On Extra Twisted Edition (PS2).

I also included PSX2PSP conversions for each PSone game.  I made them all from scratch and they are all fully playable on a modified PSP (Tested on 5.50 GEN-D).


I also included the Lost Endings in .mp4 format from the first game that were removed.


Also included are soundtracks to ALL of the games (except PS2 Head On).


PSP Version of Head On is in .cso format and I included the .iso format.


I also included pictures of all the front covers, and also included commercials for all the games I could find.


All PSone games were fully tested on a few PSone emulators, and they all work.  They also all work on a PSP, as mentioned before.  (Recommended to run on 3.71 M33 for Popsloader).


Unfortunately I was not able to test the PS2 games but I can guarantee that they will work.


Enjoy, I put a lot of work into this and I hope you enjoy it.
