ARTIST

CYNE (Cultivating Your New Experience) formed in the summer of 2001, in the swamps of Gainesville, Florida. CYNE is: emcees Akin and Cise Star, and producers Speck and Enoch â€” four distinct people, with the common goal of creating sincere and honest music.

Their often politically-charged, culturally-introspective, and motivational lyrics find influence rooted in the early works of Nas, Public Enemy, Outkast and Common Sense. The production could be described as warm, soulful and organic â€” born out of the school of producers that cite the likes of RZA, Pete Rock, Jay Dee, and DJ Premier.
