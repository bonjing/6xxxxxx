,missJiaLi,2011-07-27T18:08Z,"Those pictures were a serious waste of space........i mean 22MB for three cd-photos, is just insane, and unnecessary added-download time =\
But the tracks are fine!
No idea wtf Andrew40 issue is, and then DJFriar is obviously talking out of their ass.......all tracks are 320kps, Thank You.



LOL @ ""Big Fat Bagg"" though........spelling error there! lol =P"
,columbuzz,2011-12-11T17:15Z,Who was Britney Speers anyways...??? Never heard of him.
,nomad169,2011-12-23T06:37Z,"Thanks mate. 320 kbps. high quality.

whoever said zip is password protected, either they dont know shit or they are full of shit. Comment after downloading assholes.

@columbzz Its Brintey Spears and its a ""her"" dude, not ""him"". Google it.

@missJiaLi yes i agree with you. The images are in *.bmp format. If he had used a JPEG compression engine the 22MB images would have been reduced to 1.3MB with very negligible loss of quality"
,columbuzz,2011-12-28T18:08Z,"@nomad....are you sure it is ""Brintey"" Spears ? LOL !"
,nomad169,2011-12-29T19:06Z,"@columbuzz:  Sorry.. My bad.. typos.. It is ""Britney Spears""..

F**king disgraceful."
