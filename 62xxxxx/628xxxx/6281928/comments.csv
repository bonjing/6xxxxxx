,restless3,2011-04-04T01:08Z,"Until one comes along with less black banding this one is the best found so far.
A 10, V 10
Not dark like others and the sound does not jump around from very loud to very soft.
Thanks extremezone."

so downloading torrents will be pointless for most in the evening , do it in the daytime if you can."
,Third3y3,2011-04-17T01:34Z,"thanks for the upload.

shame about the disappointing movie!"
,ballzopie,2011-04-21T01:29Z,"My humble attempt to find the best deathly hallows rip 

Opening thoughts...
First off the movie is long enough to justify a 2 cdrip 1.39GB+, therefore i did not even consider 700meg releases
Second.. stop saying the movie is dark.  Have you never seen a harry potter movie? they're all dark, wake up!
I evaluated the following rips

Taken into consideration....
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6107024/Harry_Potter_And_The_Deathly_Hallows_Part_1.2010.PPVRIP.XviD-WBZ
Grainy, pixelated, colors seemed off
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6279002/Harry.Potter.and.the.Deathly.Hallows.Part.1.DVDRip.XviD-DEFACED
poor video most obvious in forest scene 1:03:55 CD1 (too bad too, usually scene rips never let you down)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6319993/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows__pt_1_Divx_DVDRip_(eng)
very solid rip, excellent quality [1 avi file 720x404 1.6GB] unfortunatly aspect ratio is off, should be 2.35/1 aka 720x304
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6281928/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_Part_1_HDRip_XviD-MAX
at first glance looks good, however it looks like ripper played with coloring in an attempt to brighten the picture
clearly the brightest rip but not authentic,


And the winner is...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6306554/Harry.Potter.and.the.Deathly.Hallows.Part.1.DvDRip.XviD-AZER000
excellent quality, proper 2 cd rip [2 avi files 720x304 1.39GB]
obviously you may see a bit more crispness in the video from a 2+gb release but this one is best bang for your buck,
good addition to any collection.

Thanks for the upload azer000"
,ballzopie,2011-04-21T01:48Z,While i appreciate the rippers attempt to brighten the picture Wouldn't it be better to just keep things as the original dvd/bluray was intended and let individuals crank up the gamma if they so choose?  Zoom player is great for adjusting brightness.
,al6260,2011-04-24T17:07Z,@extremezone can u include SUBS nxt time u upload. nyc work though. if u can add SUBS ;)
,Wolfareon,2011-07-23T21:33Z,"Thanks. 
Unfortunately, the quality isn't that good. But it's fine."
