,k3nd00d,2011-03-31T19:30Z,"btw, your video and audio credits are backward. :P"

,sseanbroken,2011-03-31T19:40Z,"hahaha.. they are backwards.. hahaha.. i synced the audio a little better.. just wanted to give the right credits and add a sample and some screens,,  

thanks to imagine for the audio and lkrg for the video :))).. im new to this.. just trying to be another good source :)"
,k3nd00d,2011-03-31T20:02Z,"Oh, and I think this qualifies as a TS with the good quality audio line being sync'd with cam video. :]"
,XboxMySocks,2011-04-01T04:24Z,"Yep, this is a TS, but good job, will seed :)"
,SoaperMan,2011-04-01T05:54Z,seed
,SoaperMan,2011-04-01T09:04Z,73.8% come on dude i really appreciate your upload man. but been stuck for ages>?
,kingtay03,2011-04-01T20:09Z,so what is the a/v rating for cam i dont complain every and i have watched some dark movies but this movie i want to really see and i dont want to ruin it so should i wait?
,sseanbroken,2011-04-01T21:27Z,anyone still stuck?
,ianpark01,2011-04-02T03:12Z,"Video - Quite clear a lot of cam movement though
Audio - Only let down with the bad syncing as the uploader already pointed out

I turned it off 1/3 of the way through gonna wait for a better version... sorry sseanbroken... thanks for all the effort anyway :("
