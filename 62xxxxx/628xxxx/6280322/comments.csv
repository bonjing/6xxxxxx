...... but Thor/Loki ..... 
I'm just super geeking out at that now. Just so happen today the first time I walked into a comic store after millennium of comic book rehab and saw the cover of this particular title and thought ""that's awesome art"" but finances and comic book prices aren't what they used to be. 
Thanks a million man"

Thanks for the encodes/upload.

Thanks for Castle, The CF Show, The Daily Show, The Event and Thor Loki - Blood Brothers.
Also BIG Thanks for The Colbert Report - (I HOPE THIS BECOMES A REGULARLY SCHEDULED SHOW), "
,jon4fun,2011-03-29T18:01Z,"@20-40 - My comment on [The Colbert Repor] becoming a regular show is a WISH/HOPE. 
It is not a request.

I have a feelng you may have done this one as Michael Moore is on this episode.

Cheers
Jon"
