SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===============================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

============== Â«Â« ENGLISH Â»Â» ==================

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big difference ..

Best regards!

,shiningwiz,2011-04-04T07:06Z,"The torrent quality is not very good. There are severe compression artifacts, and some very noticeable banding in pretty much every scene. I was very impressed with HDLITE's ""Inception"" blu-ray rip hence I downloaded this one but oh well. Atm looking for another torrent."
