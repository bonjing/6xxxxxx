,evaderocks,2011-03-29T17:41Z,"I also have the torrent upload on kickasstorrents, extratorrent, and demonoid. Check those sites for comments, as it was upload to those prior to thepiratebay. "
,auturgist,2011-03-31T11:56Z,"There are two moments in the second half of the film when we see your Windows start menu and you have an Explorer crash.  Also, a couple errors in the video.  Would love to see a better encode of this otherwise fantastic film!"
,evaderocks,2011-04-01T23:57Z,"do the work yourself? already rented it once and encoded it, im content with my copy until another one is uploaded, but so far, there is no others."
,mufuti9,2011-04-03T01:38Z,"You are content with screwing up so majorly?
Maybe try not applying your standards onto others.

Sadly, the vision rip now available is not very satisfying either, guess we ll have to wait a little more :)"
,shweetboet,2011-04-03T09:48Z,"Great movie!!!
A-9
V-8
the windows that pop up dont cover the whole screen and are just for a couple seconds. perfectly fine to watch. thanks uploader great to watch a quality samurai flick, eng subs are good too"
,Rev_Ses,2011-04-05T14:30Z,Thanks for this upload. I will however wait for better rips - this looks a little shoddy. It's quality is more lower-tier 700Mb DVD rip. It's definitely watchable though. But this promises some visual flair so I'll wait for a near-perfect Blu-ray rip. Nonetheless thanks for the effort!
,negativeions,2011-04-06T12:11Z,"How is it even possible for a rip to show any parts of the desktop? What, did you watch it and record it somehow in real time? Wow... that's a new low in the history of the internet."
,evaderocks,2011-04-11T16:29Z,"drm protected digital rentals are converted by real time recording, shows how much you know..appreciate the rip considering no one else has yet to do it themselves (visions rerip is just an xvid/avi converted copy of mine), because I'm not gonna pay/rerent the movie again just to recopy it for YOUR free viewing pleasure, lol..thanks to everyone else"
,arnesaknussem,2011-04-16T23:15Z,"So real time thats why its hardcoded. 
Then theres no real way to by-pass protected digital rentals?"
,Thanatos_269,2011-04-27T01:20Z,"Want perfection? Go rent it yourself you cheap whiny pricks ; )

Thanks for the efforts... and for the FREE upload evaderocks... piss on anyone who thinks otherwise

 ...and to all of you that love to complain and whine like spoiled little bitches, maybe get off your fat asses and do better, or here's an idea --> shut up ...you aren't paying for it, so piss off and enjoy what you get for free or wait for a better copy... no need or reason tot be dicks and bash an uploader when they are working for nothing.... other than to share it with you...for free.

rate it, but don't bitch if it isn't up to your all high and mighty *unpaid standards*

you sound like a bunch of whiny cheap welfare mentality.... idiots.... that think the world should hand everything to you on a silver platter for nothing.... your attitude make's me sick"
,setad1,2011-04-29T00:20Z,"DAMN! HE JUST RAW AS HELL! THAT'S THE COLD, HARD MOTHA FUCKIN' TRUTH!"
,derpnhurp,2011-05-03T04:58Z,I am downloading it just to see the Windows Explorer crash.  That is my fetish.
,Deelio,2011-05-03T06:14Z,your rip software must be garbage then...
,derpnhurp,2011-05-05T05:56Z,"Great Movie.

A=9
V=9
The windows start menu and the Explorer crash were fap worthy,  so thanks.
Great quality and sound was superb.
Thanks for sharing this."
,JamesNfriends,2011-05-08T14:03Z,"You should go out and fish while we leave the idiots behind, enjoy what they can never understand."

,Erich505,2011-07-23T02:19Z,Thanks for the subs. Fuck English Audio. 
,Froglet,2012-05-02T18:11Z,"Original Japanese with English subs. It's the way God would have done it. Thanks for the upload. And an Explorer crash? I see that pretty regularly, so I can live through it."
