,Dexter101,2011-04-01T02:06Z,"oh.. shit... 
really? u really r scorp?

I dont think so.
scorp is doing Indian, Malaysian movies and other shitty movies. 
if you are one of scorp release group or whatever it is, it's fine for me.
but if you are really scorp, ugh man... that's NOT cool.

,damnken,2011-04-02T04:30Z,"High quality makes it so scary!
Hey what program do you use to convert to mkv if you don't mind me asking? Thanks for the upload!"
,Xx_danking_xX,2011-04-28T12:09Z,Thanks for an awesome torrent. 750 kb/s is the best ive got like EVER. keep up the good work mate :)
,PeiBot,2011-05-06T06:12Z,"why does it say 720p? not to criticise your torrents that you probaly work hard on uploading, but how hard is it to put ""warning, this movies quality is NOT 720p, its a much, much lower quality""? and all you brain-dead fucks that want to attack me, fuck off.. i know yify has alot of bitches that feel the need to defend him/her even when it isn't necessary."
,flipperspit,2011-05-25T18:48Z,"PeiBot: This IS 720p, and a nice looking rip at that for such a small file. Why post when you don't know something this simple?"

,TekneeQ,2011-07-26T11:43Z,"I got a letter in the mail from my ISP warning me after downloading this, just to let you guys know. Anyway I can avoid it in the future?"
,Sarmatae1,2011-08-03T12:47Z,"@ TekneeQ Nine times out of ten, that happens because the user has not taken the proper precautions to protect themselves from detection before engaging in piracy. Mask your IP, cloak your history, tweak your firewall, don't submit system information and error reports, etc. You wouldn't just walk into WalMart and steal something then walk out waving a flag that says you've stolen something. 

You want to ask yourself if you're doing what you can to protect yourself before you leave comments like this. It can affect an uploader's reputation and hurt the number of seeders on a torrent."
,Katrienbiesemanssss,2011-08-03T13:14Z,Thanks!
,JKRollin,2011-08-28T02:42Z,"please load ""Attack the Block"""
,electricblooded,2011-09-06T22:48Z,"Awesome Rip!
Thanks Uploader..."
,TheMeatshack69,2011-09-09T03:50Z,"Lol I love how people rush to a torrent when they see that it's a bluray. Classic. I'm sure it's a good torrent, I'm just sayin'."
,TheMeatshack69,2011-09-21T01:12Z,"Perfect torrent. Love this movie, great quality, great sound. I seeded for a good two weeks. "
,Mankepank,2011-10-12T13:03Z,Looks like a bad XviD rip since it pretty much is. I had a DVDRip that honestly looked better. 720p is a lie; it's actually 560p and the bitrate is down in hell. It's just a 720p *SOURCE*.
,xpoolboy123,2011-12-13T04:34Z,"I use peerblock, have no trouble with charter or ISP's"
,tuggerz,2012-02-10T10:39Z,I LOVE YOU YIFI! D: WITH A BURNING PASSION IN MY PANTS.
,makinho,2012-05-10T11:04Z,THANKS
,strypey,2012-05-24T06:59Z,"""You wouldn't just walk into WalMart and steal something then walk out waving a flag that says you've stolen something.""

I wouldn't steal something from WalMart. I would make an exact copy of something in WalMart using my own equipment and wave a flag, because that's not stealing. Please don't fall into the industry propaganda that sharing and copying = stealing (except in the sense of 'stealing a base' in baseball, where stealing is accepted as a legitimate part of the game)."
,mohee23,2012-06-05T23:26Z," My favorite comedy movie

,Cesmo,2012-06-20T19:31Z,Good shit.! Download nice torrent.
