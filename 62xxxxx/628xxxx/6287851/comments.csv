,daywalker44,2011-04-05T22:45Z,"does your firmware see 10th and 11th wave games, you also might want to install latest update to the console"
,juic4d,2011-04-08T02:07Z,is there a way to add DLC without having a connection to xbox live?
,jcage19,2011-04-12T01:14Z,"I'm having this open tray problem too.  I can play this on my xbox but not my friend's.  Before you ask about the wave, he can play Crysis 2 with Wave 11, but not this.  He's running a Liteon 74850 with LT + 1.1 and the newest dashboard."
,ryanoctober,2011-04-12T16:26Z,What you guys need to do is: run it through ABGX and check to see the SS version. If it says version 1 then you need to change is to version 2. To do so you need to manually patch it by searching for the game's patch files in the 'verified' section on ABGX website. Hope this helps
