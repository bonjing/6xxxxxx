Extract to PSP/Game and you're good to go.

CFW is NOT required, nor is any other mess. Just extract as stated.

Includes 778 SNES Roms and the emulator. I've collected all the USA/EU games I could find, if you have any I don't have let me know with a PM or something. Some unlicensed games may be included, but I'm considering collecting them and uploading them in a separate torrent.

NOTE: I have NOT tested all of the ROMS, but most of them have been tested and work perfectly. If one doesn't work please comment and I'll see if I can find one that does or find out if it's just incompatible with the emulator. I'm running the emulator on version 6.37 OFW, so anything below that I can't vouch for. But it should work! Enjoy!
