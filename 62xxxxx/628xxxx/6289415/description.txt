Writing for Iâ€™ll Never Get Out Of This World Alive began three years ago, the longest span of any song cycle in Steve Earleâ€™s career. The first two compositions were â€œGod Is Godâ€ and â€œI Am A Wanderer,â€ two songs written by Earle for Joan Baezâ€™ 2008 album, Day After Tomorrow (which Earle also produced). The album also includes the celebrated song â€œThis City,â€ written for the HBO Original Series, Treme, which Earle also appeared in as an actor. This year, Earle will be reprising his role of Harley during many episodes of Tremeâ€™s second season. â€œThis Cityâ€ features horn arrangements by Allen Toussaint and has garnered a Grammy Award Nomination in the Best Song Written for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Category. Additionally, the song also garnered Earleâ€™s first Emmy Award nomination in the Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics Category. Iâ€™ll Never Get Out Of This World Alive also features â€œHeaven or Hell,â€ a duet with Earleâ€™s wife, the critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Allison Moorer.
