,nadroJ_L,2011-04-02T17:33Z,Must be the 1969 one looking at the runtime in the much which is stated at the end of the info list.
[T],maxneb,2011-04-02T17:44Z,"This isn't new remake, look the IMDB link, 
it's the original film with John Wayne.
The 1969 movie."
,QborT,2011-04-02T18:50Z,"maxneb -  You say look at the IMDb link, well I sure don't see one on this page.  

Epic fail, you should try labeling uploads properly."
,Slimline9,2011-04-02T19:06Z,The remake isn't out on dvd or blu ray till June 7th. I highly doubt that a hi def rip will surface till mid May when Paramount start getting them pressed.
,weaping_reaper,2011-04-02T20:14Z,The IMDB link is right under the size.. Ya JACKWAGON!
,PaulieD,2011-04-03T15:06Z,"The Coen brothers True Grit is not a remake of this film, it's a newer adaptation of the book. Just like the Kevin Costner Robin Hood is not a remake of the Disney version. Simple."
,jacksteffel,2011-04-17T21:28Z,"Fuckin' A, PaulieD."
,Kroth,2011-04-23T23:34Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

,blusniffer,2011-04-24T11:48Z,Instead of writing all that shit above simply put that it's the 1969 version dumbass!!
