No one is trying to say it's DVD. You don't know what your talking about.. so STOP already. And it's funny that the link you put here proves you wrong. I quoted this directly from the link you provided. READ IT PLEASE!!
""The term Telesync doesn't indicate better video quality but better audio quality. The CAM source is then synchronized with a secondary audio recording."""
