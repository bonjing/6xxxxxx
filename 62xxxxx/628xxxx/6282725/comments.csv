Well, I think what he is trying to imply is this;

Harry Potter 7 = Popular Movie

Harry Potter 7 Standard Size 1.4GB

Uploader's Harry Potter 7 = 790MB

Pirate Bay Leechers = Cry about larger size movies.

Uploader is trying take an extra step to please the cry babies that are never happy. I hope I managed to break this down for you a bit. if you're still a little confused, you can go to

Then stare at the white screen until it starts to make sense..."

The movie itself was alright. Pretty good acting, and a lot of action in the first 20 minutes. Could have been a better ending, but it was good nonetheless. On a 1-5, I'd give it a solid 3. "
