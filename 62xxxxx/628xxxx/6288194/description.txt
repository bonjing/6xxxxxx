Kim Wilde-The Singles Collection 1981-1993(mp3 320kbs)ICM369

Thanks to the original uploader

This is certainly the best and most comprehensive Kim Wilde compilation album 
out there at the monent, and is certainly a better purchase then the new Very 
Best of Kim Wilde collection (better packaging too).

All the classic hit singles from 1981 through to the 1993 are present and correct,
highlights being the epic View From A Bridge and the infectious Water On Glass.

It contains the great 1984 single, The Second Time, which is not included on the 
new collection. 

It also enables us to enjoy Ms Wilde's generally excellent work free of tacky and
unwanted remixes (who actually listens to remixes on compilation albums anyway ?)

Overall, a great retrospective for one of our quietest and most unassuming national 
treasures, now to be seen on a variety of gardening and horticulture TV shows. 

Many Kim Wilde compilation albums have been released in the past, but The Singles 
Collection 1981-1993 is the best of them. 

It's the only album that contains *all* of Kims biggest hits,that's quite a feat, 
considering she's recorded for two record companies. 

They got together and made this album happen, remember "Kids in America"? The 
dramatic "Cambodia"? The firmly tongue-in-cheek "Love Blonde"? Her American no. 1 
hit single "You keep me hangin' on" ? The beautiful ballad "Four letter word"? 
They're all here, together with a selection of the other, lesser known singles. 

All of them are worth listening to again and again... and again...
