Kaixo, Hello, Sali ZÃ¤mÃ¤ !!!

Another release from my mother's CD collection. Today it's the three studio albums wich Betty Mabry Davis recorded back in the 70's. "Betty Davis", "They Say I'm Different" and of course "Nasty Gal" with the participation of her then husband Miles.
Covers and a text file with an article about her from allaboutjazz.com are included. Unfortunately it seems that someone spelt something over the "Nasty Gal" cover during one of those wild orgies my mother use to have. It was all sticky and I had to iron it before I could make a good scan....

And here is some REAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
This is the one and only way how to prepare the real Marianito preparao as it has to be on sunday morning after church:
Give about five or six ice cubes into a jar
now a litlle hint of Angostura over the ice (0,5 cl)
add some fine quality gin and Red CuraÃ§ao (1cl of each)
now add Martini Rosso (10cl)
stir it , NEVER AND IN NO WAY THINK ABOUT SHAKING HIM !!!!!!
pour it with filtering the ice into two cocktailglasses
add a piece of orange skin lightly pressed over each of the Marianitos preparaos.
Enjoy with some Olives or caracoliÃ±os. And thank the lord that you are so lucky to live in Bilbao, the center of the universe where they make the best of them. AMEN


Please don't be upsetted if the download may take a while: I can only upload with a speed of about 200 KBit/s. Blame Euskaltel and or the basque and especially the spanish government for it !!!!!

Have also a look on other torrents I've posted and feel free to place a comment or a feedback. I would be very glad about. Eskerrik asko ! Thank you!
