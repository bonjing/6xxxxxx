,element89,2011-08-12T13:39Z,"Is the album art the official album cover? The cover looks very amateurish..

That said, thanks 320hunter!"
,Midgar,2011-09-08T23:03Z,"These sound great, thanks!"
,Meatus,2011-09-15T19:28Z,Thanks man!  Sounds great!
,Meatus,2011-09-15T19:36Z,"I take back most of my previous comment.  I do still appreciate it, but I am not sure about the quality now.  There are other sounds in the background of most of the first few songs.  Clicking on the keyboard is what it sounds like to me.  Can you re-do the recording/remastering?"
,sconzz,2011-10-15T20:16Z,"Where's ""I'm on fire"" you stupid asshole? Bit of a fucking Springsteen classic don't you think you fucking cunt?"
,Cojage,2011-10-26T22:47Z,No tenth avenue freeze out :(
,fbaugh,2012-06-01T02:09Z,Terrible quality for 320. Doesn't even sound like stereo. Poor distorted mono.
