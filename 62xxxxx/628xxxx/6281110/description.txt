        Forced to leave town after betraying Lyle Tyrus, the  ruthless
        leader of a rural crime gang, Luke Cain has stayed away for 15
        years to protect his wife and daughter from Lyle's  vengeance.
        But his  daughter Emily  nurses a  burning desire  to see  her
        father and Luke finally  agrees to meet her  at a cafe on  the
        outskirts of town.

        But fate intervenes when Lyle's brother Norman and his killing
        crew chance by the cafe. They leave without incident but  Luke
        knows it is just a matter  of time before they report to  Lyle
        and return to exact their revenge.

        Luke  is  forced  to make  a  difficult  and potentially  life
        threatening  decision.  Should he  leave  his daughter  behind
        again,  or  wait  for his  worst  nightmare  to walk  straight
        through the door?

        Only time will tell if today really is a Good Day For It!
