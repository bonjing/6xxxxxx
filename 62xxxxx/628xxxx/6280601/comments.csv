,jlashmit,2011-04-23T19:01Z,"I've downloaded the Xvid and the AC3 codecs but still cannot get this to play, what gives? The sample plays fine but not the movie. I've never had this much trouble getting a movie to play and I've done a LOT of movies...."
,jlashmit,2011-04-23T20:37Z,I got it working. I've got audio and video. I used AVIcodec to detect which codecs I needed. it says to use Xvid MPEG 4 video codec and AC3 DVM audio codec. Be sure to use AC3 Filter 1.63b codec. Now that I got everything working I give it a A10/V10. It's a tad dark but I think that is just how the movie is suppose to be. The audio/video is in sync. My problems may be because this is a new computer and I have not set everything up yet.
