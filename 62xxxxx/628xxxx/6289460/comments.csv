1. Run the installer. Uncheck the option to be a part of avastâ€™s social community. Choose the option to install the trial version.

2. During the setup of the program choose to add the folder exclusion avast scan.

3. Start Windows in Safe Mode. To do this hold down the F8 key during startup (before Windows starts you should see a prompt on the screen to launch in safe mode.)

4. Copy the fix file from the â€œFIXâ€ folder to the directory where you installed the program. If it asks you to replace the already existing file, choose to do so.

5. Reboot Windows, you should now be able to enjoy a full version of Avast.
