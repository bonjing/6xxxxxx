,topanyel,2011-04-12T20:22Z,"Ok so I was logged in :D

So I just managed to install and play Tides of Darkness on Win7 32, as follows:

1. Mounted the MDS image file to Daemon Tools, copied all files from it to c:\warcraft. 

2. Created an empty directory c:\war2 

3. Got DOSBox from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/
After installing and running it, you need to type the following commands:
mount c: c:\war2
mount e: c:\warcraft -t cdrom switch 
e:\
setup

It will start the installation; install it to the previously created c:\war2 (it should be the dir originally offered by install)

4. Install should complete without any problem so exit and navigate to installed dir and run with war2.exe (still from DOSBox!)

Game should run fine, I am pretty sure Beyond the Dark Portal can be installed the same way.

Next time you want to run the game, run DOSBox and use these commands:


mount c: c:\war2
mount e: c:\warcraft -t cdrom switch 
c:\
cd war2
war2.exe

Have fun all, and many thanks for sharing BackToWeb."

,cerin616,2011-05-04T13:12Z,"Making it work with a .iso

If you have the ""Beyond the Dark Portal"" CD but don't want to bother with it each time, you can create a .iso file that DosBox will recognize as the original CD (provided you give it the right instructions).

MacOSX can help you with creating this file : after you have inserted your CD of ""Beyond the Dark Portal"" on your CD drive, type in the following code in the Terminal :

hdiutil makehybrid -o warcraft2x.iso -udf -iso -joliet /Volumes/warcraft2x

Then, put the .iso file into the right folder (see the pathway I chose below, for example) and you'll be able to start ""Tides of Darkness"" with the following commands :

1) mount C ~/Warcraft2

2) IMGMOUNT E /users/Yourname/Warcraft2/warcraft2x.iso -t iso -fs iso

3) C:

4) cd/WAR2

That stands for : ""choose directory WAR2""

5) war2

You're started, congratulations !

,Deathsky22,2011-06-26T14:35Z,"Probably should of guess that this would be difficult being on a mac. *sigh* didnt get what i expected the file to be. thats besides the point though ... anyone there to help me out here? ive actually never seen a mds file and what it does. i seen converting and things like that but âŚ i sincerely have no idea. vie dug around, downloaded 3 different failed versions of WC2 ToD and im actually kind of frustrated. any help is appreciated."
,stephon_,2011-07-02T13:32Z,"game works, however mouse cursor is too fast even at lowest speed setting, it's so hard to play"
,superawesomefuntimekai696,2011-09-11T00:16Z,"For those wondering ""Alt+Enter"" (or return, however you want to say it) brings DosBox to a FULLSCREEN state, press this combination again to make it minimized. Please do a bit of research (:

and for those wondering WHY it won't work on a mac, it's because your using a Mac. Get Bootcamp."
,sci_13,2011-11-13T19:42Z,"i have some problem at the 3rd step -

mount e: c:\warcraft -t cdrom switch 
e:\
setup

after entering these the program returns 
""illegal command : setup"""
,sci_13,2011-11-13T20:17Z,"yeap. for the expansion installation in the 3rd step, instead ""setup"" - ""install"" command is used, and the original has to be installed too already"
