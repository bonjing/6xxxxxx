,henrikhoe,2011-04-02T16:17Z,"you should stop using ac3 as your 5.1 audio tbh, messes up a ton"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-02T16:57Z,where does it mess up?  what does mess up mean?  explain in detail.
,rakz2cul,2011-04-02T23:25Z,@ henrikhoe ac3 is the most advanced and most updated codec that we have in our hand right now...i am amazed that you have said it messed up...if your using windows PC than you sure would face problem with AAC Dolby Pro Logic II because of the audio did not sync with video-if that's case use MKVToolnix http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-02T23:44Z,files play fine on windows 7 out of the box install with no additional codecs or software.  I however highly recommend you use VLC.  You could even use Quicktime or iTunes.  There isn't any fault with the file format or audio streams.  Any fault is due to your computers configuration.
,Berik01,2011-04-03T18:08Z,"HR What Tools do you use to make these rips I have done a lot of google searching and the best thing I can find is handbreak but I have to decrypt the blurays first and I can't find any good tools for that except slysoft's AnyDVD but I don't care to spend the 60+ if I can avoid it. I also couldn't find how to make the HD tags work for itunes any info would be appreciated.
