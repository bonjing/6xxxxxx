About movie: 

In the modern world, we are people so dealt with by the problems and 
daily vanity that seldom we notice,
That, and who surrounds us. Whether it be our relatives, wild or pets and especially, architecture monuments, and the nature of our cities. 
And and at all it is not necessary to speak about protection of all of it.
On all it at us always is the justification - 
I am occupied, I work, I do not have time.
Can then after death we will have time, can only after it,
We can stop or reduce speed?
And then, at last, we can see beauty surrounding us.
