,Keane620,2011-04-01T00:46Z,"@Extremezone Great upload, but I had a quick question. Since you apparently have the bluray of Deathly Hallows Part 1, could you upload the bonus features? I manily wanted the first scene of Deathly Hallows Part 2, which is included with the bluray edition of the movie. Thanks!"

,JzSizzle,2011-04-01T01:32Z,"hey...
Termie says its 7/7, yet another person says 10/10. Can I get some other opinions?
Id hate to waste my time downloading this if its all for nothing.

If I have to Ill just go with lower resolution dvdrip that seems to have nothing but good ratings."

,shadowtek,2011-04-01T09:12Z,"come on people seed, im downloading at 4k >:("
,zrimmeh,2011-04-01T09:54Z,"i cant quite figure out if this is a true BRrip, but it definitely isn't up to standards. the outlines of objects and characters are very pixelated. the lines aren't clear.
there are better torrents out there.
+ what is with the .avi format. that died out ages ago. only low res movies use .avi, perhaps that is the reason its not of the best quality. but in future for high res ""rips"", use mp4 or mkv.

V = 6
A = 7"
,braidone,2011-04-01T23:45Z,"its 3 gb so, ofc its not going to look as good as the 6 gb version. so i bet this is about 7/10. so if you want awesome shit, download the 40gb version which will be up in a jiff

and .avi, really?"
,zrimmeh,2011-04-02T07:07Z,"@braidone
the video is definitely not 3.2gb worthy. its only 2600kbps. download it for yourself, i could do a better rip myself, but its not released on bluray for another few weeks yet here."
,anoopkrsh,2011-04-02T16:52Z,im very low on download speed guys please i need your help in seeding....
,UNDER8ED,2011-04-02T22:23Z,"Shortly after downloading this I received an emial from my ISP advising me this content is illegal copyrighted material, and they were contacted by Warner Bros with instructions to warn me.

Anyone else receive this warning?

How serious/accurate is this? Advice on how to prevent this from happening in the future would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-02T23:43Z,"Can I have your attention for just a minute please! Please read this for all ours sake! 

SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte 

blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

MVH.

och ner, tack!

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!
