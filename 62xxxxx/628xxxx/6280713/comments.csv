,MitsEvX,2011-08-12T18:25Z,"Ok, when mounting, doesn't there pop up a installer menu? 

- Go to ""My Computer"" and double click on ""WOODY_US"". The menu now should pop up and you should be able to click ""next"" to install the game.
- Else, explore the drive by right clicking and start the ""Setup.exe""

It doesn't matter what system you have for a menu that needs to pop up when mounting, but then in most cases you must still be able to at least install the game ;-) And when it also doesn't give you an error...... ;-)"
,Looef,2012-04-09T21:13Z,How do i change the sound after i (by mistake) missed it after the install ? Please respond as quick as you can ! ;)
,MitsEvX,2012-05-03T00:14Z,"Sorry for my late response, but there's no such thing as a message system here on TPB ;) About the sound issue: so there totally isn't any sound? Can't you modify/reinstall, including the sound files?  You can always make a copy of your save file(s) ;)"
