Just thought I'd point it out.
Thanks for the upload mate."

,rajp,2011-09-26T16:19Z,"Although its mentioned that the resolution is 1920x1080, the resolution seems to be 1920x800. I am using VLC media player and the media information reports the resolution to be 1920x800. I even played this file with my media player on a full HD Plasma TV. The media player (Free Agent Theatre +) also reports this file to be of resolution 1920x800.
Is there anything wrong? Do I need to change any settings? I am newbie to all this, so any help would be appreciated."
