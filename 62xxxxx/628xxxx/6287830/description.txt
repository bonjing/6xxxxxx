Lyrics Faster from the CD 'The Unforgiving' march 2011 :

I can't sleep, cause it's burning deep inside
Like gasoline, a fire running wild
No more fear, cause I'm getting closer now
So unreal, but I like it anyhow

I go faster and faster and faster and 
Faster and faster and faster and faster

I can't live in a fairytale of lies
I can't hide from the fear cause it's right
I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies

I can feel that you mesmorise my heart
I feel so free, I'm alive, I'm breaking out 
I won't give in, cause I'm proud of all my scars
And I can see, I've been wasting too much time

I go faster and faster and faster and 
Faster and faster and faster and faster

I can't live in a fairytale of lies
I can't hide from the fear cause it's right
I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies

And I can't live in a fairytale of lies
And I can't hide from the fear cause it's right
I go faster and faster and faster and faster for life
I can't live in a fairytale of lies

A fairytale of lies
