Release Notes:

Zuku\'s seven-song EP, Here With You, is mainly a
balance of the hard and the musical Ã±we say mainly
because the Toronto rock band throws a few curve
balls, not the least of which comes from the
splashes of mandolin, piano, Korg bass synth and
mini Moog, which it doesn\'t have live. Although Zuku
would probably want to be known for its heavier
songs, the lighter-by-comparison \"The Wave Washes
Away\" is a smash hit with its altogether-now
possibility they won\'t stop calling for
you/foryou/for you/ for you, while \"Steelveins\" is a
country bluegrass clap-along that could be stepped
up onstage into wild hootenanny.

Lead singer/guitarist Brandon Kennedy devised Zuku
in 2003, working on the sound while he was still in
metal outfit Goat Horn. Flash forward to the fall of
2006, and he and Mike Conroy (guitar, vocals),
Jordan Beard (guitar, vocals) and Chris Chartrand
(drums) joined him at Toronto\'s Hallam Studios for
two months to record the EP. Kennedy co-produced
alongside Uncut\'s Jon Drew (Toyko Police Club,
Magneta Lane). There has been a change to the Zuku
line-up since, hence the incognito press photo, but
now Matt Felske has stepped in to replace Conroy.
