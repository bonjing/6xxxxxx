thanks for the upload, toothiemc.  The graphics run a bit glitchy, but I'm sure I can fix that with some simple tweaking.  I have windows 7 64bit.  I switched the compatability mode to windows 98.  the gameplay runs good.  The cut scenes are whats glitchy."

First time i downloaded it, it said the file was corrupted and navigating the folder that appeared after mounting the .bin was extremely slow, its still not responding. Clicking on INSTALL.exe, brings up a small window for a second and immediately closes. I'm on XP, no clue if thats the problem."
,joshr_chanfan,2011-04-10T08:21Z,"The cool thing about windows 7 is that it has a compatability mode that allows you run programs that were made for older operating systems.  this game, unfortunately, was made for 95/98.  that's probly your first problem.

However, it was difficult for even me to install this game.  I ended getting it to install by manualy going into the iso and clicking on the setup icon.  So far, this game has crashed on me three times to the point where I had to shut down my computer manualy.  I mean, it plays well, it just won't let me exit.  I'm going to keep looking for other versions for comparison."
