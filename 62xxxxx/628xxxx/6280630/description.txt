Okay, so this is a fixed version of System of a Down Live at Big Day Out 2002.
The last one I put up had a few messed up songs and I apologize for that but i have fixed it. Once again, I have never seen a torrent up for MP3 converted versions of this live show so this is my present to all of you.

Songs in order are:

Bounce

Aerials

Chop Suey! (or as real fans know it 'Suicide')

Deer Dance

Needles

Psycho (with Darons amazing solo)

Suggestions

Suite Pee

Toxicity (with Goodbye Blue Sky)

Once again I will state that there is only one song missing, 'Mind', because the person who uploaded it to youtube put the 'Star Wars' theme at the begining of it. I won't rip it because I find that disrespectful and if any one can find me a better version on youtube, congrats and lemme know. I hope you all enjoy these once again and I'm sorry for messing up the last one.

Thanks, and remember to seed! :)
