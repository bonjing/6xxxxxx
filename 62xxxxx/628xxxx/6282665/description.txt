Stephen Dorff stars in this gripping story of sex, betrayal, and murder. 

In 1938, British detective Alan Cross (Adrian Dunbar) travels to a small French coastal town to investigate the mysterious death of a close friend. Soon he becomes entangled in the strange lives of his prime suspects, the Graves, an aristocratic English family hiding many dark secrets. In his search for clues, Cross cleverly uncovers an incestuous relationship between siblings Jeremy (Dorff) and Celia Graves (Gabrielle Anwar), local Nazi-sympathizers, and ultimately, the true identity of his friend's killer.
