Follow the amazing journey of MMS, â€œMaster Mineral Solutionâ€, formerly known as â€œMiracle Mineral Supplementâ€. This new book of Jimâ€™s is the continuing story of how MMS is changing the World. The Master Mineral solution of the 3rd Millennium picks up where Jimâ€™s first book ended, until the present.
Recently, Jim has returned from Africa where he successfully treated more than 800 HIV/AIDS cases. Last year he conducted 9 lectures in Europe, a 5-day seminar in Germany and six 10-day seminars in the Dominican Republic, all teaching the MMS protocols for healing most of mankindâ€™s diseases. The Genesis II Church of Health and Healing now uses the MMS solution as its Cleansing Water in the Church Sacraments. This new MMS book can save your life or that of a loved one and will most likely do so sometime within the next 5 years.
This book has 268 pages and 30 chapters. Jim has updated all the MMS topics that were in the first book.
Here are some of the topics covered in this new book:
Â·         Safety precautions;
Â·         What MMS is;
