Want a game you can really sink your teeth into? Swim and swerve through underwater worlds, chow down on smaller fish, and chomp your way to ocean supremacy! But watch out: boatloads of pesky predators are looking to make lunch out of you. 

When you're hungry for a different challenge, take a bite out of Time Attack mode. Ride the tide through stunning coral reefs, enchanting sunken ships and other gorgeous marine environments, all while enjoying a steady diet of fabulously frantic fun!
