The original release came from NoFS's Eminem-Still Shady bootlegged album.

So whats different?

I have completly re-encoded the song and fixed some of the issues like the bass almost dissappearing and making the highs actual highs.

Audio Encoding Changes:
Constant Bit Rate: 320Kb/s
44100 Hz
Joint-Sterio
CRC
Bass Boost (Where it needed it.)
