Buffalo Springfield is the self-titled debut album by folk rock band Buffalo Springfield, released in late 1966. It was originally released in both mono and stereo versions as Atco (SD) 33-200, but when the single "For What It's Worth" became a hit, the album was re-released as Atco (SD) 33-200A and added "For What It's Worth", but dropped "Baby Don't Scold Me". "Baby Don't Scold Me" has never been reissued in stereo:. The band was generally unhappy with the sound of the album and felt that it didn't reflect the intensity of their live shows.
