Install Notes:

1. Unrar Manually - Released With No Installer
2. Run ~unpack~ From the Extracted Folder To Rebuild (Our Installer Guy Is Preoccupied)
3. Use shift2u.exe To Play.

Other Notes:

Install/Rebuild Is Time/Space Consuming.
If Install/Unpack Seem To Freeze Leave It Alone.
D3d/dx9 errors/missing dll? Update DirectX.
Windows/Error Report? Your Specs Are Maybe To Low.
Total Install Took Us about 20Mins On A DualCore.
Check Minimum Requirements Before Downloading.
Plz Allow Pleanty Of Hd Space For Installing And Extracting.
