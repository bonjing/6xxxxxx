,ericjwilson,2011-06-18T06:06Z,Great upload...just installed it and it works...Just install and play as it says
,four0deuce,2011-06-23T22:28Z,"This seems to work fine. The install includes openAL.
When you install you can choose to unlock everything which starts you with a save that has everything already.
to install and play just mount iso, install and run
no cracks or anything.
windows 7, amd64, nvidia geforce gpu."
