Release Notes

Video:ELEKTRI4KA

Audio:Own

Okay here we go with the first cam for source code we used the russian cam had our own but this one was good enough had a few issues colors were all over the place
so added a rgb filter and fixed those video was kinda dull and blurry sharpened it a tad other usual video filters,also the cam has the same effect as the
Batlle Los Angeles cam the dark scenes have a glare in them didn't want to increase blac levels then you can see shit so adjusted em accordingly.

On to audio very nice clean cam audio except for an occasional cough nothing major atabout 40 minutes in our audio was missing for a few seconds so i hardcoded the one line that that was missing audio other then that its all there
very watchable first cam till line comes along enjoy and as always d/l sample before d/l the actual movie remember its a cam if you are not a fan of em don't d/l them.
