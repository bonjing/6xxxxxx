,Hellstalker,2011-05-21T20:09Z,"You might as well put a complete description just like most people do. I just wasted 7Gb of bandwith only to find that this is DTS audio and not AC3 disk.

Geez.

To all other downloaders: DTS AUDIO TRACK ONLY...!!! (Unless you want to hear the alternate one witch is just PCM or 2 channel audio)"
,bongojiing,2011-05-22T09:50Z,Hellstalker. I am not an expert in matters audio but at least i do upload files which is more than some whinging and whining one go uploaders do.  If you are such a fucking expert where are all your uploads with the perfect descriptions.  Fuck you you pathetic LEECH
,Sukkanaama,2011-08-11T14:51Z,"hellstalker, are you stupid or what? LPCM is a LOSSLESS codec whereas AC3 is LOSSY. Therefore there's nothing wrong in this disc, very audiophile. LPCM is also part of dvd specs and will play on every dvd player."
