
Sleepytime Is A Brilliant App Designed For Those Who Hate Alarm Clocks! (Like Me).

It is a small program in which you can listen to your iTunes playlist songs before you go to sleep. It could also wake you up in the morning by fading into any song you choose!

I have a computer in my room and if I wanted, I could use Sleepytime to be my Alarm clock and play my favorite song in the morning to wake me up (and I have).

I am not sure if it will work on the older macs or not. 
With MacOSX Snow Leopard it works. No PC's please.

Enjoy, best part is it's only 2MB!!!
