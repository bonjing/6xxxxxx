With two radio hits in the UK and the  hit single "Dead Man" climbing up the Christian rock charts, We As Human has proven that an independent band from Northern, Idaho can still make noise without a big label fueling the fire.

The release of their EP Burning Satellites,produced by Grammy and Dove award-winning producer Travis Wyrick (P.O.D., Disciple, and Pillar ), shows that We As Human pulls no punches when it comes to speaking the truth and getting their point across to the listener. Hard-hitting topics saturate this collection of songs, ranging from false prophets to dying to oneself and even touching on abortion from the child's perspective.

"Rock and roll was born out of this experience that people were having. They loved the huge sound; they loved the big lights, the big stages, the big guitars..." Justin cordle states.

"I think the reason people come to shows is because they want to be entertained...it's still an entertainment business. We love rock and roll and the show and everything that the people love, so we try to do it as big and as bad as we can."
