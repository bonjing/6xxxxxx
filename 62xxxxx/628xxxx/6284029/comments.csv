,fsas,2011-03-31T06:49Z,wow - you've had a hard life - I don't know about your political theories - but the pain in the last paragraphs is real - I hope you find some peace
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-31T08:56Z,Thank you...for taking the time and you comment. My best friend killed himself at 14. I have peace in what I feel when I play piano and guitar. He is with me most of the time....It has never been the conspiracy crap that I am posting for...I walked in 14 years ago as my dad was molesting my 3 year old nephew. I have been able to protect him or so many others. Now I feel getting these on a server where they cannot be removed is necessary. The odd stuff happened...it is why nothing is being don. But not what I am focusing on. Thank you.
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-31T09:00Z,"Again I have several torrents o here. They are disjointed. My brother cracked my skull when I was just seven the first time when I begged my mom to make things stop.  This is not something until now, that I sit around and focus on. It is just that after 20 years I received an email address for the OK State Liaison for the Dept of Human Services. She promised an investigation. Instead I was visited a month ago by two police officers who told me to drop this and not discuss this with anyone. "
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-31T09:01Z,And I only returned to TPB when I realized my blogs and emails don't seem to get out...at least I have no stats ...and emails are being returned after days of delays.

,fsas,2011-04-01T07:47Z,Pain is its own reality - it can color everything we see - not too many folks have reached out and accepted what you've had to say - and that is too bad in so many ways - you didn't deserve the pain - you do deserve better - you've already taken the first steps by reaching out - don't stop - seek help and kindness where-ever you can - and give as much kindness as you can - the world doesn't need more insight or wisdom or Truth - kindness will do 
,wintersbutterfly,2011-04-02T07:35Z,"Thank you again fsas.
Please now. I play the pian, extremely well. I have no knowledge of how or why or what I am doing.
I play the guitar well. And I love to sing.
Eddie is and always will be very much a part of me.
As is everyone we have once known. I saw God in Eddie's eyes and the potential of all of us in him. And when he died it was like God himself giving into the vileness of this world.
It took me 35 years to recover in worl that I saw as without God.
But knw I have something than others.
Others are required to have Faith.
God has given me Eddie.
And I would have endured anything to know him.
And I would cast all my memories of him to eternity. If I could take away the pain he suffered alone at the end. No boy should face the emptiness and and how alone he was when he took his life."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-04-02T07:38Z,"And more than anything in your comments...like the angels wings that shield families from the Church Protestors at soldiers funerals...your words meant a great deal in contrast to the one just before your. Thank you. I have been told to kill myself too, by some recently. The word can be vile and it DOES need to be reminded of a 14 year old who was be hurt so very much..and yet he contained so much love in him, you are right the world needs that. I am doing this for Eddie and my nephews, who are still being hurt. thx."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-04-02T07:40Z,"And it takes everything out of me at times in the voice of my mother screaming at me when I tried to tell when I was seven, right before my ten year old brother a week later ripped open the left side of my mouth and cracked my open. I have been through an unbelievable Hell. And they ARE being protected to keep attention of them."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-04-02T07:43Z,"It is very much too me like returning to a grave time and time again in checking on these here. I put them on TPB to get them on a uncentralized server so no one could force them off. I have not contacted TPB, but I thank them for leaving them here. If TPB actions are intentional...it is very much like something I saw in Eddie still in this world."
