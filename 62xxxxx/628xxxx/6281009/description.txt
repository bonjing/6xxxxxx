Hi all this is an encode of the torrent by the name 
821 Greatest Hit Singles of the 2000s [FLAC] - Kitlope 
All I have done is downloaded the torrent and encoded it to LAME V0 MP3
All credits go out to Kitlope for this amazing torrent and great compilation
The torrent was in FLAC and 22GB+ I think that we don't actually notice any difference in FLAC and V0 LAME so i encoded it and uploaded it here for the general public...

Consider this a little project for me since I noticed not a decent 2000ï¿½â‚¬â„¢s FLAC download available on the torrent network. Believe me when I say this took quite some time to rip, download, tag, audiocheck and finally upload As a matter of fact, this is my 4th decade I have done (70ï¿½â‚¬â„¢s, 80ï¿½â‚¬â„¢s & 90ï¿½â‚¬â„¢s are currently seeding) and I must say this was the most difficult decade to do. It probably has something to do with me quiting listening to the radio (and pop music in general) circa 2001 and getting more into the ï¿½â‚¬Å“indieï¿½â‚¬Â scene. Unlike other decades, I had no idea what songs charted and what was popular (except for the obvious ï¿½â‚¬â€œ like Nickleback, Nelly Furtado etc). So each song / band was wikiï¿½â‚¬â„¢d to make sure that it was on Billboard. I also threw in a few tracks from not so popular bands just to spice things up. Some of these are my own rips and some are taken from torrent sites. I used a program called audiochecker to validate how authentic the FLACs that I downloaded are and the log is included in this torrent (check in the Audiochecker folder). Of course there is no log or cue file with such a torrent but rest assured the rips that I did originally had them and many of the ones I downloaded had them too but I didnï¿½â‚¬â„¢t bother including.

Audiochecker isnï¿½â‚¬â„¢t 100% accurate either. For instance, my own rips of Nelly Furtado came up as 95% MPEG. How is this? I ripped the CDs straight into FLAC. So use Audiochecker more as a guideline for quality rather than the absolute truth because I can guarantee its not 100% accurate with its results and can be misleading due to its algorithm.

Also, I left the tracks as is. No equalization, no Replay Gain, no nothing. I figured if anyone wanted to "fix" the tracks to their liking they could do it on their end. Some tracks are from"remastered" sources so the volume is much louder than other tracks that haven't been. I don't really consider a lot of remastered music remastered since all they do is up the levels (compression and not in a mp3 sort of way) and brickwall the sound. Most Joe Six Packs prefer this type of sound but the rest of us that actually know what a good recording sounds like (something called Dynamic range that is all but dissappearing in modern recordings) hates this effect.

Iï¿½â‚¬â„¢m sure thereï¿½â‚¬â„¢s a lot more songs that could have been put into this torrent but after 2 months of working on it I just wanted to start uploading. Iï¿½â‚¬â„¢m hoping this will meet the needs of a great 2000ï¿½â‚¬â„¢s FLAC torrent.



Enjoy :)

From Wiki:



The 2000s is the decade that started on January 1, 2000 and ends on December 31, 2009. It is the current decade, and the decade in which the 21st century and 3rd millennium began.

By the end of the 1990s, the world had come closer to adapting to the globalised and unipolar world that emerged following the end of the Cold War. The institutions, linkages and technologies that emerged or were redefined in the 1990s would subsequently benefit many countries in this decade, in particular China and India. However in other parts of the world such progress failed to address ongoing struggles with modernity, most notably characterised by the rise of al-Qaeda and other Islamist groups. The September 11 attacks by in 2001 ultimately led the United States under President George W. Bush to invade and occupy Afghanistan and Iraq, and implement various anti-terrorist measures at home and abroad in what was known as the War on Terror. The European Union saw further integration and expansion throughout much of Europe, and Vladimir Putin steered Russia towards a more assertive foreign policy while rolling back human rights. The economic growth of the 2000s, while responsible for lifting millions out of poverty, nevertheless had environmental consequences, raised demand for diminishing energy resources, and was still vulnerable to sudden conditions, as demonstrated during the Global Financial Crisis.



Music 

The decade was marked by the dominance of both hip hop music (especially crunk, electro-hop, and gangsta rap) and alternative rock (especially emo and post-grunge). Few revolutions were made during this decade in music, and styles of the 1990s and early 2000s were still popular up to 2009, including Britpop.[43]

The late 2000s were also the beginning of the Synthpop revival. Artists such as Lady GaGa and Florence and the Machine redefined electro-pop.

The best-selling artists of the decade were rapper Eminem and 1960's rock band The Beatles.[44] The most popular male artist of the 2000s was Eminem. BeyoncÃ© was the most popular female artist of the 2000s according to Billboard.[45][46]
The Rolling Stones had the highest grossing tour ever and Madonna had the highest grossing tour ever by a solo artist.

The 2000s decade featured a craze in dance music, and dance songs such as the "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" by Soulja Boy Tell 'Em are now influential music. Artists such as Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Lady Gaga, The Black Eyed Peas, Britney Spears, Fergie, Ne-Yo, Jennifer Lopez, Nelly Furtado, BeyoncÃ© Knowles, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, and Mary J. Blige have led the decade with chart-topping singles.

The late 2000s featured a series of fanatic, upbeat rhymatic songs such as "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" by BeyoncÃ©, which spawned one of the few dance crazes of the decade and "Poker Face" by Lady Gaga.

Hip hop music has spun sub-genres that feature vibrant dance songs including snap music, crunk, and the resurgence of rap-rock through Lil Wayne. [/quote]
