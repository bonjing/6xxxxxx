,asker1,2011-04-30T21:55Z,Cant find anything ells then the audio. Do i need to download anything ells to?
,spaceoff,2011-05-04T23:21Z,"I confirm it guys it is Season 3 ! Some of the episodes has weird names but it is the complete Season 3, back in New Jersey !"
,Paranoia187,2011-05-05T17:24Z,"Why does this messed up torrent that says ""The complete Season 3 or 2"" in the description have 550 seeders?"
[T],FaMoUz,2011-05-05T22:23Z,"itz not messed up.. i hate explaining this shit 2 dumbass people..

i said season 3 or season 2 bkuz im not sure if this is season 2 or season 3

mtv calls it season 2 but imdb calls it season 3

dont complain about something u didnt pay 4"
,PhoenixTorrents,2011-05-10T22:20Z,"The episode order is messed up but quality is good, ripped from MTV."
,Teddikilla,2011-05-29T19:36Z,"Really messy file names, Says it is season 2 in like, 90% of the episodes... It IS season 3, just the filenames are retarded. Thanks 
A/ 8
V/ 8"
,Teddikilla,2011-05-29T19:42Z,"Ok guys, let me explain it. In this folder, episodes 'S03E01 - E04' ARE Episodes 1 - 4 (duh) and the 'Season 2 ep 18 - 26' is episodes 5 - 13 
Good torrent other than filenames bro, Thanks Alot."
,Teddikilla,2011-05-29T19:42Z,^ And it IS ALL season 3 (Y)
,gruviv,2011-07-06T14:09Z,TY!!
,Jebus567,2011-07-16T03:30Z,Here's the deal. In order to not pay the cast more $ and have a new contract MTV calls this a continuation of season 2. Basicly everyone else considers this season 3 and this torrent contains all the episodes from the season.
,riico1,2011-07-28T17:34Z,"It is the complete Season three but its shit because the names are all fucked up so i dont know where to start etc. can someone upload a proper season 3
i get lost in this one "
,misterred,2011-08-04T01:09Z,"for the people who just downloaded this:

aftr ep05 you will see that like: SOE0305 like that I 'm not sure right now cause I'm stoned and to lazy to look at it but anyway aftr that you will see there is no ep 06 so u go to SOE0219 

(I'm not sure why I just posted this shit but I think it is funny atm but it is right what I'm saying oh wo eva 
pz )"
,misterred,2011-08-04T01:11Z,acualy I remembr now why I came here anyobody knows perhaps if season 4 will come out on piratebay soon?)
,SeriousSammi,2011-08-04T14:34Z,"Top notch upload! Except for the mixed up Episodes, but that's a very minor thing to worry about.

,toneezyp,2011-08-06T13:24Z,"Absolutely funny show. pure dumb hilarious comedy! for some reason when i downloaded this, most of the episodes from 7-13, it was labeled ""S02E15-21"". after doing some research(wikipedia) i found what show is which and relabeled... PERFECT! great UP FaMoUz!"
,toneezyp,2011-08-06T13:26Z,"if you DON'T READ COMMENTS LIKE ME, you will notice some people may have already posted about that topic i just commented about... anyways, thank you, and... i should probably read... anyways, THANX FAMOUZ!"
[T],FaMoUz,2011-08-09T00:29Z,"its so funny how everybody thinks that the episodes r fucked up but if u search 4 jersey shore season 3 episodes u will c that everybody including TvTeam labeled it that way

,aspiratr7,2011-08-26T18:02Z,is this censored? im guessing it is
,bycmxs,2011-09-03T02:54Z,hey mate i've downloaded this thanks can you tell me which order the episodes are in because they have names such as s02-e21 when it should be season 3
,DjStiv3,2011-09-24T08:37Z,how in the hell do you watch this season? everythings so mixed up do you watch 1-4 of s3 then the rest like 18-26 or s2? wtf lol
