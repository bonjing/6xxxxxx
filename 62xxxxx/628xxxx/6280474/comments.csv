,gpstorrentz,2011-03-30T18:06Z,it works :D internal hdd only
,PS3HD,2011-03-31T11:16Z,im new to this... so how do you load the game onto the ps3?
,gpstorrentz,2011-03-31T12:34Z,"@PS3HD

copy the game to you usb drive or external HDD and connect it to your ps3. then copy the game from the external HDD to your internal HDD on the pas with multiman 1.16 or gaiamanager.

it only works internal, if you try it external you will get a black screen freeze...

good luck"
,gabriel84,2011-03-31T18:18Z,"It works on 3.55 Kmeaw

How I did it:
First thing you need to follow the instruction here and replace the eboot.bin file (if you can't find it do a windows seach inside the folder)

Before I Installed Multiman I used Gaia to copy the NFS2 to HDD (after I replace the eboot) On Gaia press ""O"" on the controller to activate the copy menu and then you should figure out what to do.  

1- go to http://www.ps3-hacks.com/file/160
2- download ""multiMAN 1.16.11 for 3.40 - 3.55""
3- Inside the zip file you will find 3 package files
4- Transfer file ""multiMAN ver 1.16.11 BASE (20110322_170000).pkg"" to USB drive root
5- Install the package
6- Now you should have Multiman installed on the menu
7- Run Multiman app and look for NFS2 game (Make sure you look for the one in the HDD) and hold ""select"" and hit ""X""  
8- It will ask you if you wanna lunch the game without going back to the PS3 Menu 
9- Hit ""NO"" and then PS3 will reset and you will see the game loaded in the menu

FAQ 
* Yes you can have multiple Game Managers Installed like Gaia, Multiman Etc 
* If you have Older version of Multiman you Delete it and install the new one
* Cant think of anything else, have fun"

,akshu709,2011-04-16T04:14Z,"Hi

I just bought a PS3 yesterday. I don't know how to install pirated game on the system. Can u plz help me out. Plz give me the steps for what other software i need to download and how to install them also. Plz it would be a great help.

Akshayy"
,Adeel080,2011-04-17T00:16Z,"AKSHU:
First U have to Download Kmeaw 3.55 cfw. U can Search on GOOGLE..!
When U finish Download.. U will se PS3UPDATE file..! 

Time to install the custom firmware. This step is pretty much standard for all/any patched CFW file you may be using. Copy the newly created and renamed


PS3UPDAT.PUP to your flash drive (/PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP). And now update your PS3 firmware as normal via XMB.


Note: If you get a error saying that your already at the latest update and it kicks you out, then you need to update your PS3 CFW via RECOVERY mode. TO boot into recover mode read THIS.


I got that error first time going through so I went ahead via recovery menu to complete the process.



If you see this on your XMB then the CFW installed properly:

Step 3
Install a backup manager (must be signed), I recommend and am using Rogero manager v7.9a:

    multiMAN v1.13.15 (DOWNLOAD)


Some notes on backup managers â€“ you must have any original PS3 game inside and you must boot from XMB.


And there you go, you should have backups + PSN now running on your PS3

,Adeel080,2011-04-17T00:19Z,AKSHU: Just forget about errors..! all u need is to put KMEAW 3.55 CFW on USB than Install that Firmware .. Simply go to settings and There U will find SOFTWARE UPDATE just install KMEAW firmware.! You can also Watch on YOUTUBE..;) best of luck..! And Remember Do at your own risk If you have PS3 SLIM 320 Gb than it's fine to install.;)
,R.Jonnys,2011-04-24T06:49Z,It did not work for me ... Even changing the eboot it asks for the version upgrade 3.56 ...

,irfan_ace23,2011-05-11T21:16Z,"downloaded this, extracted the files to usb drive using 7zip, as G:\GAMEZ\BLES-01066 .. etc.., replaced the original eboot.bin in BLES-01066\PS3_GAME\USRDIR with the modified file from Shift.2.Unleashed.PS3-DUPLEX\dpx-nfs2.r00\NFS2.DUPLEX\Eboot\ (since i am using cfw 3.41), then installed multiMAN ver 1.16.15 BASE (20110409_190000).pkg.
went into gaia manager to find that the game was showing as a game title, namely BLES-01066, and not by the game's real name, nehow, i copied the game to internal hdd and later started multiman to find out that this game wasnt showin in its list, i refreshed it , but still didnt show.
then went back to gaia to mout the same game, when exited to xmb, the blu-ray disc was showing as 'corrupted data'. please help!!!!"
