Ch4 Dispatches 2011 BP In Deep Water PDTV Xvid MP3 MVGroup

BP is one of the largest companies in the world and plays an important role in the British economy through UK pension funds, the billions of pounds of tax it pays and as a major employer in the UK.
A year on from the start of the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, journalist Greg Palast examines the role of BP in this spill as well as similar incidents in the past and examines its contracts with oil-producing nations and relationship with the British government. For two decades, investigator Greg Palast has been on BP's trail. In BP: In Deep Water, Palast takes Dispatches viewers along on his world-wide investigation of the oil giant.
One year after BP's Deepwater Horizon rig blew apart and spewed 170 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, BP claims victory â€“ that most of the oil is gone. But one clean-up worker tells Dispatches he's not allowed to actually dig effectively for the spilled oil. He's ordered to only skim the top quarter inch with a pet-litter scooper. Palast walks across one still-slimed beach with a marine biologist who describes 'BP's clean up theatre' as 'superficial' and 'cosmetic'. He shows us the oil still coming ashore, and the oil still deep beneath the beach surface.
