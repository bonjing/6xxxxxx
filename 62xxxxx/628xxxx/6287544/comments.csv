Read This Or Die
----------------------------------
Load this torrent, don't start the download.
Click on ""Files"" tab (lower part of uTorrent program-window) - right-click 
on file you don't need - choose ""Don't download"". 
(uTorrent would show ""Skipped"").
Now, start with download.
Other torrent-programs offer very similar step.

Seed after your download is over, you'll seed only the files 
you choose to download. Please. 
Share with other people, best way you can.
But seed. Share. Do not Hit & Run.

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-01T17:40Z,"@ houruoha: Past week, Pack-haters almost burst into flames. One asked for one episode of Lie To Me I think four times and even when I upped it twice - he kept asking. It caused almost ""international incident"", lol...

As other 98% of morons, Pack.haters are ""special-breed"": people who cover obvious lack of intelligence (or serious mental illness which pours down from every word they write) with bitching about things which never ever would be changed.

Thank you. I just upped extra-small 480p HP7 (411 MB) and that should make them happy."
