 Description:                                                                  
 The lion's social nature makes it both complicated and fascinating. Lion      
 expert and BBC Big Cat presenter, Jonathan Scott, has lived in Kenya, in East 
 Africa, and watched the most famous lion pride in the world, the Marsh Pride, 
 for more than 30 years. With the help of the latest lion research from        
 Professor Craig Packer and his team at the Serengeti Lion Project, Jonathan   
 takes a fresh look at the lions he knows so well.                             
                                                                               
 He reveals why male lions have a mane, why murderous step-fathers are an      
 important part of lion family life and discovers why being social brings      
 unique challenges for the survival of the species as a whole. Living in prides
 once helped the lion to be the most widespread land mammal on Earth after     
 humans, but now it could be their downfall as they are increasingly restricted
 to small parts of Africa.                                                     
                                                                               
                                 Enjoy!
