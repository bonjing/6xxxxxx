Mad Blocker Alpha: Revenge of the Fluzzles has the common gameplay mechanics of a falling blocks game like Tetris. It is also a match-4 game. The blocks are laid horizontally, which may be jarring for some players. The controls are initially awkward. I am used to accelerating blocks by pressing down. Here it is X; the down button does nothing during game time. The shoulder buttons are used to rotate the individual blocks.
There are a few power-ups, which are randomly given rather than randomly appearing. The only way to gain these power-ups is by â€œchainingâ€: causing eight blocks to match (as opposed to the random nature of the original Mad Blocker). The power-up is randomly generated, but it also includes a chance of not scoring a power-up at all. The power-up can be used immediately, as it is assigned automatically to Circle, Square or Triangle. And thereâ€™s a reserve slot, too, if you are full with power-ups on the three buttons
The hit web game puzzle franchise comes home in Mad Blocker Alpha. Mad Blocker is a traditional puzzler based around the lining up of 4 or more blocks of the same color. The game is fairly straight forward but itâ€™s the hand drawn visuals and ease of play that are the games main attraction. See how many Fluzzles you can save!!
Mad Blocker Alpha promises to be "The best Mad Blocker experience yet" with way more backgrounds, block types, new power ups, new game modes, an expansive story mode, with comic book style story sequences and a riveting soundtrack.
