,namorax2,2011-03-30T17:41Z,I thought this started april 1st? I have starz and all their ads say that.
,saielkhan,2011-03-30T18:54Z,is the same 1 that was on a month ago
,ConeBone,2011-03-31T10:09Z,so is this the pilot episode that came out a month ago? not complaining.. I actually want that one. I didn't catch it before and want to get into this show. From what I understand they aired the pilot a month ago and the the next new episode is April 1st?
,xxx---Mem---xxx,2011-04-01T02:06Z,Thanks :o) Can't wait for the next one. Love your stuff as it means I don't have to wait months & months before we get it on tv
,TMarie88,2011-04-02T08:46Z,"@conebone April 1st was the official release date of it on starz they had a special 2hr premier where they played the first episode that they did a  month ago and then the second one was a brand new one. 

Show is awesome, i watched the first episode a month ago when it aired as the special sneak peek of the show and Joseph Fiennes is also a great actor, I loved him in flash forward and he looks amazing at playing merlin, which is the perfect part for him"
,c3bhm,2011-04-08T10:35Z,"STOP CHOPPING OFF END CREDITS.  Christ, there needs to be a universal rule to knock that $%!& off, forever, for all shows.  Jump-cutting from the dramatic moment of an end-scene right into the desktop is crap.  The end credits and music are there as a part of the experience - to transition the story's ending.  Saving those extra few megs of filesize is NOT worth it.  For F's sake..."
,FadeToDarkness01,2011-04-11T05:08Z,"got a copyright infringement email on both of eztv's camelot downloads, TPB is suddenly turning into a whore of ""movie leaks"" just to get your ip address"
,ashen77,2011-04-19T22:42Z,"good show and great DL.

And fuck the infringment notices... does any one know of any Dl'er who's ever been arrested over it? coz i sure as hell aint.

Besides.. fuck em, greedy fuckers! On tv shows now'a'days they never even give us an ending, let lone a good one.

They can kiss my overly white ass!"
,ashen77,2011-04-19T22:44Z,"Oh yeah.. thnx for all your hard work EZ.

You ARE the nuts!"
,lovell,2011-05-01T22:33Z,"I got a copy infringement email as well, be careful, they won't arrest you just cut your internet off.
