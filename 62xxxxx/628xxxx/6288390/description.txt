Growing up in Houston, Vinson studied saxophone in school and had his first professional experience with local bandleader Chester Boone, going on to work on the road with Lil' Green and Big Bill Broonzy before landing a job with Cootie Williams's orchestra, where he first recorded his abrasive singing. Forming his own group in 1945, he was popular for a decade thanks to record like 'Kidney Stew' and 'Cherry Red'. He spent much of the '50s and '60s out of music, but thereafter regained a following in both the US and Europe. Singing or blowing alto sax, Vinson had a hard , penetrating tone that cut through the most boisterous ensemble, and his recordings of the '40s and early '50s, whether with a big band or with smaller groups, are consistently good examples of the tough, unsentimental idiom conventionally, though not really adequately, described as 'blues shouting'.
