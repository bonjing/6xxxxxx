,sanved77,2011-04-02T16:43Z,@rooomeo start from the online section
,sagd,2011-11-02T14:32Z,"I would like to know how to put this together...

I have 2 folders...
EA SPORTS(TM) Cricket 07 and EA SPORTS Online.

There must have some thing to do to the folders to get it to work online right?

If this is something already installed in the EA SPORTS(TM) Cricket 07 folder, then why is there a EA SPORTS Online folder?

Thanks!"
