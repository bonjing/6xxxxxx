Tom Lewis is a singer-songwriter originally from Belfast. After serving 24 years in the Royal Navy, mostly in diesel submaries, he emigrated to Salmo, British Columbia, to live somewhere different form a large port. Salmo definitely qualifies. "An Ex-Sailor's Life" may explain his decision to settle in the interior of British Columbia. "Showers" definitely seems autobiographical.


This was fifth album, released in 1999 by Borealis Recording Company Ltd. of Toronto. I bought this album at a library's ongoing book sale, one of thirty-odd CDs for $1 each; this album alone was worth the total price of the lot.


Tom's website is www.tomlewis.net, and seems to be more up-to-date than the home page indicates; the tour dates are current.


If you like this album, please buy more of Tom's stuff. His last album was released in 2003; maybe a few extra sales will convince him to release a new one.
