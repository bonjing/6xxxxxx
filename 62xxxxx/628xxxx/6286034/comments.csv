V8 A9
Old zombies... too slow... 
Didn't like the movie...
Anyways, thanks for uploading... great rip..."
,Dr_Science,2011-10-30T18:03Z,This movie is not a shot for shot remake of the original.  I mean there are added characters and people die in different ways than the original...this movie is completely different from the original and IMO is much MUCH better than the original
,skav,2012-01-21T04:28Z,"Love the zombie genre and a big fan of Savini. Got the tip on the remake thru the Nerd (James Rolfe, cinemassacre.com) lookin forward to watching it! "
,CaptainJackRackham,2012-05-05T22:02Z,Thanks so much for this! I've been looking for it for a long time ever since I met Tom Savini back in 2001 at a comic convention.
