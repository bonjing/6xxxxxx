,dfsdfsd,2011-03-30T12:52Z,My first torrent.  Please comment if it works as it's supposed to!
,webspyder,2011-03-31T09:09Z,"Hi! 
First of all BIG THANKS!! :)

I noticed that the file is a 'rar' file. Do I have to unpack this with 'unrar' or just change the file type (ending) to img or iso to burn it? (I'm not so familiar with Daemon tools)

(I downloaded another big rar file (a music DVD) and it didn't unpack when I used 'rar' to unpack... Perhaps it then with that file was only to rename it...)

Hopefully you or someone else can find time to help me with this. "
,dfsdfsd,2011-03-31T18:22Z,"You need to unpack it.  You can use Winrar: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm
After you have unpacked the files, you can use ""Daemon tools lite"" to mount the files directly from you computer: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads
Daemon tools lite is free:-)
If you don't want to use Daemon tools, you can burn the disc images to two separate DVD's and play it on your DVD-player.
Ask if you have questions."
