This is an R5 copy the picture is nice and the sound is clear and in-sync.  That's all I look for in a R5.  My source is http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6288418/Battle_Los_Angeles_2011_R5_-_PRESTiGE

Thanks sceneline."

To seed, just don't touch the torrent, even after it hits 100%. After it downloads, it's status willgo from Downloading to Seeding. Just leave the torrent running for a while. At least reach a ratio of 1.000, to show some respect for the uploader. (No worries, im a noob at this too. Lol.)"
