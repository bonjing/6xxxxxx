,dlarrym1111,2011-04-06T02:40Z,"@amermalik: 1st, NO ONE will honor that request. MOST actually rather see the files larger. the More it is shrunk, the bigger the sacrifice in Quality. You do realize a retail DVD is put onto Dual layer DVD's and are anywhere from 4Gb to 8.5Gb in size. SO think of the drop in quality when a movie that is in its original form 6.2Gb in size, then it is squashed into a 700Mb file??? WHO wants that!!! I'd rather have the quality and bigger files then the other way around. I'd bet most TPB members would agree "

,wayneking,2011-04-10T02:03Z,"I considered this a fair quality rip, except for the error screens that popped up for a few seconds during the film.  This was distracting and annoying, but only lasted a few seconds.  Watching on a small screen, the quality was decent, but for those wanting to watch their DLs on 40/50 inch TVs, I would suggest sticking to the HD or larger files as clearly, they will take better advantage of your big screen TV.

The film itself is a beautiful Samurai flick, in the same vein as the old classics.  If you arent's generally into Samurai movies or Japanese cinema, you may well be disappointed, but for those with a broader taste who do enjoy a bit of Ichi San or Seven Samurai and the like from time to time, this is a teriffic piece of modern cinematography with all the hallmarks you might expect from a top traditional Samurai flick.  The best of both worlds imo.

THANKS A LOT FOR THE DL FROGGIE100.  Much appreciated."

This movie is A W E S O M E. The acting is good, the visual effects are good and the fight scenes are absolutely perfect.
It has some similarities with 300 in that they're only 13 samurai and they fight a whole army. But without the gay stuff and the silly slow-mo. Also the acting is a lot better in this movie.

Couple of points though, the encoding is garbage, I've seen 500mb movies with better picture quality, why this was even 1.46gb is beyond me, a standard 700mb would have been fine, especially considering most rips at that size are considerably better than this rip.

That said, if Americans are idiots for preferring to watch a movie in English rather than read subtitles, can't the same be said of any country (Germany springs to mind) that typically uses voice-overs instead of subtitles for american films?

I'm pretty sure that although it is pointless to use this forum to whine about a movie's lack of spoken English, people should be encouraged to like or dislike any movie they want, for whatever reasons they want.  It's no reason to condemn them, their culture, or their nationality...
