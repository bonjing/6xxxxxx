,arvindcj,2011-04-19T17:26Z,"This Works 100%..!!!
But the instructions are not complete.. After couple of hours of research and trial n error methods, i figured it out made it work... Here are the steps u gotta follow...!!
Change all files extension to r000, r001, r002.......till r074 (DO NOT CHANGE THE EXTENSION OF OTHER FILES!!!)
Then unpack, mount or burn, u r good to go..!!!
This game uses Dirext 10 strictly!! So any card which is not designed for Direct X10 , u will get error ""Unsupported card detected"" or the game will crash very often... 
Im using NVIDA 9500 GT, 2GB RAM, AMD Dual Core 5000+ and Windows 7 64-Bit.

Game is awesome!!! Graphics is too good..!! "
,711thorwor,2011-05-04T13:35Z,@arvindj: I renamed the files (ppt-crs2.001 - ppt-crs2.074) to ppt-crs2.r000...ppt-crs2.r073 but windows says the files might become unstable if changed so i didnt all. Is this how you did it? Even so will an .iso file appear if you do it this way? There is an .iso file wihthin the archive that again can be unpacked so you can install the game?

,arvindcj,2011-06-22T03:20Z,"@711thorwor, yes u can ignore that msg and instal the game... Once the ISO file is created, use power ISO to unmount the disc!!"
