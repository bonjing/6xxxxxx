Patty Smyth
Greatest Hits 
Featuring Scandal (1998)



After leaving Scandal in 1984, vocalist Patty Smyth waited three years before launching her solo career with the Never Enough album. Although it sold respectably, it didn't have any major hit singles. Smyth returned to the top of the charts in 1992 with "Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough," a duet with Don Henley; the single hit number two and went gold. Its parent album, Patty Smyth, also went gold and featured two other minor hits, "No Mistakes" and "I Should Be Laughing."
