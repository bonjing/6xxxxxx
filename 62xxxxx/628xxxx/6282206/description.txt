A bored wife, who is planning to run away from her minister husband, is taken hostage in a bank robbery. However, she sees the thrill in being involved in the chase and becomes an accomplice to helping the younger robber escape his pursuers. As things progress, she learns he pulled the robbery to get enough money to help his pregnant girlfriend leave a home for unwed mothers. The two have a brief flirtation, but it is clear the housewife just needs something to enliven her life.

I searched EVERYWHERE for this and could not find it, finally some luck.  Figured I would share with those that wanted to give it a watch, actually not that bad of a movie.

ENJOY!
