Y'all know I have me a major weak spot for most things Alabama. So just imagine my surprise and delight when I opened my inbox to find an email from a killer little band...from Alabama. Friends, I'd like you to meet The Dirty Lungs. I think I might just have a little crush on them.

You see, The Dirty Lungs can make quite an unholy racket, a gritty blend of good old grimey garage, nouveau psych, and even some Stone Roses-esque, splendidly overindulgent instrumentation. It's sleazy, it's nasty, and mercy me it's fantastic. This is a band that abides by the "go big or go home" mentality, cranking out the walls of blistering, beautiful noise and swirling, hazy masses of sound like there's no tomorrow. And maybe there's not. So while there's still a today, might I suggest you spend some time making yourself acquainted with these fellows? You'll be ever so glad you did. http://lesenfantsterriblesmusic.blogspot.com/

The Dirty Lungs (from Birmingham, AL) are almost worthy of their own post. I knew absolutely nothing about them going into last nightâ€™s show, but their set might have been my favorite of the night. They do a retro psych-rock thing with a classic rock sheen, kind of like the last Comets on Fire record. It paired nicely with what Abby Go Go and The N.E.C. do. It looks like theyâ€™ll be back in Atlanta for a couple of shows in July. Check them out. http://littleadvances.com/
