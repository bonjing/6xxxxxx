Release Notes:

Continuing the superlative run of Harmless 15th Anniversary
releases to add to "Pulp Fusion" and "Jumpin'" we move to
another one of the most popular Harmless series over the
last 15 years, so welcome to "The Breaks" - 15th Anniversary
Edition. Once again we enrol the services of crate digging
expert Dean Rudland for compiling duties and following the
success of his Backbeats compilations "Gimme A Break" and
"Crate Digging Fever" we're delighted to say he's topped
himself with this selection

"The Breaks" - 15th Anniversary Crystal Edition is quite
simply one of the most comprehensive collections of original
break beats on the market and is an essential purchase for
all lovers of the original Funk and Soul samples which have
since been utilised by thousands of acts ever since. Many of
the tracks on this album are currently unavailable elsewhere
else and, as a result, demand for them has built up via the
new generations of producers and creative samplers who want
to get their hands on the original source material,
including such highly in-demand and sought-after tracks like
"The Champ" - The Mohawks, "It's A New Day" - Skull Snaps,
"Don't Change Your Love" - Five Stairsteps & Cubie, "Bra" &
"The Message"- Cymande, "Tramp" - Lowell Fulsom, "Good Ole
Music" - Funkadelic, "Run Nigger" - Last Poets and many
more.

In addition to the above, we've also included a number of
later tracks which have since become highly collectable in
break beat circles and yet collectors still struggle to find
them on CD in 2011. Gems like Liquid Liquid's "Cavern"
(where Grandmaster Melle Mel's "White Lines" bass-line came
from), Manzel's "Space Funk", Taana Gardner's "Heartbeat"
and Vaughan Mason's "Jammin' Big Guitar" being just four
examples of incredibly hard-to-find gems which are almost
impossible to find on CD...until now

Enjoy
