,X-Cuter4,2011-03-30T22:22Z,"works for me, but I can only get textures and animations from the beta files :( but its still good to work with."
,Goman_NL,2011-03-31T09:40Z,Works fine but after installing the game doesn't start any more. thanks anyway :)
,atenator,2011-04-05T18:25Z,"no virus here!
I have Kaspersky and he doesnt detect any virus at all."
,atenator,2011-04-05T18:28Z,"And...
I have limited pre-order edition from ea store with no sandbox 3. 
I have no textures (only 2) and no models (I cant add vegetation vechicles etc. I just dont have them) do I have to download pirate Crysis 2 and use this editor with it?"
,Phazed,2011-04-06T20:10Z,"Note that this torrent doesn't work, and it actually fried my video card.

Upon opening the editor and starting a new map or loading one, all textures from the game are missing and it caused my GTX460 to ""crash"" (NO SIGNAL).

Thinking a driver issue, I reboot and reinstall new drivers. Open a map again using this editor caused my video card to crash again, except this time permanently. Upon PC start up, my computer no longer recognizes a video signal from my video card. Research into the issue has concluded with a fried card.

If you want the editor, you'll have to download the full leak, open up the retail version's encrypted PAK files with OpenBMS and then copy those files over to the leaked version. The leaked editor is NOT compatable by itself with the retail version.

Since using this makes it so your retail version of the game doesn't work anymore anyways, it's a terrible idea to use this torrent."

,alshid99,2011-05-23T03:25Z,"This torrent works, although no objects and no textures. The ctrl+g also doesn't work. To sum it, it's still not fully worked. But at least it won't fry your card like Phaze stated. Maybe he overused his card by playing Crysis 2 in hardcore setting 48 hours non stop?"
,peterwan,2011-06-03T11:43Z,"As stated in the readme file accompanying Sandbox, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition or Windows Vista x64 are the only officially supported operating systems for running the editor. According to Crytek, using a 32-bit OS can lead to instabilities with production size levels due to the low amount of virtual memory available and is therefore not supported.

check this out guys...
