This is the Sandbox Editor 3 for Crysis 2, this has taken me a long time to complete. What I have done is taken each file, bit by bit, and checked what (FINAL) files the editor will work with, along side which (BETA) files it will work with. Currently the only know files that are needed to be replaced for this to work are the "GameData.pak", the system.cfg, the bin32 folder, and the Engine folder, all of which I recommend you backup before using the Editor!
