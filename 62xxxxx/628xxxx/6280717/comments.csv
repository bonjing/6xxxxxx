Of course you can get the Arrival alone, just not from this torrent. :) I'm sure there are other torrents with just Arrival."
,baskinsy,2011-03-29T20:35Z,"Great job, but please give us Arrival as a standalone option!!!!"
,Theycallmewonka,2011-03-29T20:41Z,"The arrival is already on tpb separately. Im thinking about downloading this myself, i already have it all but as you say having it at the touch of a button is pretty nifty, thanks ;)."
,Theycallmewonka,2011-03-29T22:29Z,"@ holloow ,it's been uploaded a few times, i downloaded this version http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6278909/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_Arrival, and completed it with no problems."

,RG90000,2011-03-30T07:52Z,"Just to clarify (i am always cautious), this can work with a steam version right? And will steam detect the DLCs/Crack?"
,illiria,2011-03-30T09:28Z,"@ RG90000

Haven't tested on STEAM version, but if the usual DLCs and cracks work, this will too. There's nothing new here. Should work, but I can't guarantee."
,greysaber,2011-03-30T15:25Z,"Not working.  Clean install (yes legal purchased version). 

If not logged into Cerberus Network gives error that none of the DLC are registered.  Will let me log into my normal Cerberus account but is not giving credit for having the:

 Alternate Appearance Pack 2
Kasumi - Stolen Memory
(not sure if there are any others)"
,illiria,2011-03-30T16:59Z,"@ greysaber

I heard that DLC crack (all of them are based on ""giveme2entitlements"", including mine) may not work on specific connection types. The issue is very rare, but I heard some people have it.

I myself have never had this issue, and can't say much about it, unfortunately. I'll check DLC pack again, in case I forgot something. Unlikely, but it's best to double check."
,illiria,2011-03-30T17:01Z,"And I repeat, do not launch the game directly using its EXE files. Or use shortcuts, or use ""Game Folder"" -> ""Binaries"" -> ""RunMassEffect52.exe""."
,poity1,2011-03-30T17:46Z,"How can I verify in-game that all the DLC content is installed properly? Everything seems to work when I launch the game, but I don´t see any record of DLC content being available except for Arrival."
,illiria,2011-03-30T19:17Z,"@ poity1

No, you cant really verify it, simply come to your terminal on the Normandy, and you should get a lot of messages saying you got this armor, that mission. And new locations on the map. But if arrival is there, everything else most definitely is.

Oh, and if you access the terminal once and get a message from Hackett, try to access it one more time to read your personal messages. That's where you should see the info on all the DLC things you get."
,greysaber,2011-03-30T20:24Z,"To append/edit my earlier posting.  I now have it working and stable.   

Was running off the wrong shortcut;  Using MassEffect2.exe instead of RunMassEffect2.exe under Binaries.   
Created and tweaked shortcut and set to run as Admin (love Windows 7 but it can be touchy about permissions) and set the game to NOT connect to EA.   Connecting to Cerberus Network after this is not a good idea btw unless you already have all the DLCs (at which time you would not need this download)

All my achievements (Shadow Broker, Kasumi etc) are back, though oddly I have not found any new blank/grey achievement slots for Arrival.  

Guess I will need to do a another complete run through and see if it picks that up along the line"
,illiria,2011-03-31T07:51Z,"@ greysaber

Repack supposedly replaces all shortcuts for all users (Desktop/Quick Launch/Start Menu) to point to ""RunMassEffect2.exe"". Should do that on Windows Vista/7 too. So if you launch using any of the game's shortcuts, it should already launch with DLC crack. You shouldn't need to make any new shortcuts.
Unless there is some protection in Vista/7 preventing my pack from editing the game shortcuts, but I doubt it."
,illiria,2011-03-31T07:54Z,"@ greysaber

As for Arrival, I haven't had any achievements either... Maybe I've included a pre-release version of it? Though i doubt it... Everything plays fine till end, no glitches or whatever. I myself don't care for achievements much."
,illiria,2011-03-31T07:56Z,"Sorry - yeah, checked. My version shouldn't be pre-release. I've checked, and it is byte-in-byte the same as final."
,illiria,2011-03-31T08:01Z,"SORRY, for 4-th post in a row. I've checked my game, I HAVE ACHIEVEMENTS for ""Arrival"". So... yeah... Maybe something went wrong with your game installation? Everything works fine here."
,whys0seri0us,2011-03-31T08:46Z,"On the game's menu screen I see the ""new content available"" tab, but after I click on it, it just sends me to the ea bioware website. I clicked no to both the online options under ""extras"", but that hasn't helped."
,illiria,2011-03-31T09:32Z,"@ whys0seri0us

It ALWAYS says ""New Content Available"", even if you have everything installed. It is completely normal. It sends you to BioWare Shop webpage.
You don't need to press any ""content"" buttons or go to any websites. You already have everything installed."

,illiria,2011-04-01T19:23Z,"@ BenvZijl

,GunForce,2011-04-02T03:07Z,"im having trouble with this DLC pack. it says that the DLCs are not authorized. i have microsoft .NET 3.5

,illiria,2011-04-02T07:56Z,"@ BenvZijl

No way to do it manually. All the cracks are based on ""giveme2entitlements.exe"". If mine crashes, all the other cracks will crash too. I think problem must be in your Windows and should go away after re-installation, but I can't guarantee that.

@ GunForce

Crack (giveme2entitlements) is not perfect. It does not work while certain connection types are active. This is a rare occurrence, but no real way to fix it. The only thing you can try is disconnect and play offline. That usually helps.

It works fine with PPPoE and PPTP type of connections, what type of internet connection do you have? I haven't had any problem with crack even after I've changed my internet connection from PPPoE to PPTP."
,GunForce,2011-04-02T08:35Z,i honestly dont know which internet connection i have. i never had trouble withn your torrents before. dont know why im having trouble this time
,illiria,2011-04-02T12:32Z,"@ GunForce

Because problem isn't in my torrent, it's in the crack. I made a wrapper for ""giveme2entitlements.exe"", but I didn't make the original crack. I always knew it's not perfect, but it is the one and only crack for DLCs. If it won't work, nothing will. All the other cracks are simply wrappers for the same old ""giveme2entitlements.exe"" file."
,FritoLovesYou,2011-04-02T19:45Z,@GunForce - same problem.

,RougeMer,2011-04-03T06:27Z,"Think I'm having the same problem as GunForce, game does not crash and I can play it normally, but it says my DLC isn't authorized. Any advice as to how to get through this?"
,RougeMer,2011-04-03T06:33Z,"Regarding my previous post.

Yea, never mind me. I'm an idiot, just had to run Mass Effect 2 directly from Binaries instead of the general Launcher. Also ran as Admin and that worked too. Hope this helps anyone else there who makes the same mistake as me."
,Krelianz,2011-04-03T11:13Z,thanks great torrent
,illiria,2011-04-03T11:50Z,"@ GunForce

""giveme2entitlements.exe"" file is packed inside ""RunMassEffect2.exe file (which is in Binaries).

I have tied the shortcuts to launch RunMassEffect2.exe file, which launches the crack, and then it launches the game launcher, so you start the game with the crack, automatically."

Didnt even do clean install, just installed this over whatever DLCs I had before.
Just make sure you do everything what Illiria said,
e.g.: make sure you have Net Framework 3.5 (exactly this one), in Win 7 you might have to check if its enabled.
Game or the crack behaves differently if you are offline/online, so try both.
Thanks for all the great work :)"
,Lycon82,2011-04-12T14:18Z,"I am ABSOLUTELY in love with you!!! Great pack, will download and will seed for as long as i possibly can! Thank you!!!"
,s_t_o_r_m,2011-04-12T16:54Z,"To be clear - this DLC pack is only for english/american version of ME2, right?
And all the DLC are in english/american language, right?"
,illiria,2011-04-13T01:39Z,"@ D-Rey86

Problem is in the game, not in torrent. I've passed Overload plenty of times.

@ s_t_o_r_m

DLC Pack should work for all the languages the game was released in, not only english.


-----------------------

For those who still have a problem authorizing DLCs, I don't know what to tell you. I simply can't reproduce the problem on both of my computers - works fine here.
Other people report it works fine for them too. The issue must be specific for your software/hardware, I cannot guess where the problem lies."
,D-Rey86,2011-04-13T07:07Z,I think making sure givemeentitlements.exe was in there fixed the  authorizing DLC for me. 
,gregxxx,2011-04-14T01:14Z,"Is anyone able to get this running with legit digital copies from EA?

Might be some anti-piracy thing.

The problem seems with not being able to log into the cerebus network so the game doesn't allow authorization of the DLC.

Anyone able to confirm this?  Anyone able to get into the legit cerebus network then try loading the game up and seeing if this lets it pass authorization?"
,gregxxx,2011-04-14T01:24Z,"Alright i think i found a fix for authorization.  Start Game, go into Extras, Go to Online, Turn send Feedback to Bioware off, and Auto Login to EA to Off.  Restart game and no more authorization error.

Haven't played the game to know if it actually works but it doesn't give me anything about authorization anymore (probably because theres no EA Server to scan your PC for hacked DLC)

found from a different ME2 DLC torrent.

How install and play DLC Content

1) Before you can install YOU NEED TO TURN OFF gameplay feedback and autoconnect.
   Do so by starting Mass Effect 2 and going to extras > Options.
   Then exit game."

One question I do have though, Arrival and Lair of the Shadow Broker aren't appearing in my game. I'm assuming this is because I haven't met Liara yet or done the suicide mission yet ( Arrival is meant to tie Mass Effect 2 to the start of Mass Effect 3 so I assume it would be AFTER the suicide mission?)

Would appreciate if someone could help me out with the latter part. I will seed as long as needed!

,Simmer5,2011-04-29T04:47Z,"@TAIM2DAI,

Most of the DLCs don't show up until you need to recruit the second half of your crew, and new systems open up (Illium, Tuchanka, so on and so forth).

From playing the Xbox version, actually the Arrival DLC is available pretty early - I actually played and beat it before I reached Illium - weird....  

Hope that helps!"

,killerb43,2011-05-05T18:00Z,"Those who downloaded ME2 through the DA2 promotion. Here's what I did to get it to work.

illiria's file installs in a different directory from where the EADM installs the game. You need to copy the game to C:\Program Files\Mass Effect 2. EADM puts that trademark symbol in there so just make a new directory and copy the files out of the downloaded ME2 to that directory. 64-bit Windows users do the same except the path would be C:\Program Files (x86)\Mass Effect 2.

Then run as Admin that file included with this download. I didn't try the normal launcher yet but know this will work on the run exe included.

As others pointed out, have your contact EA stuff all off. Then no unable to authorize message. I went into the game to Normandy and got a lot of the DLC. Not Arrival because no Hackett nor Shadow Broker but this was on a new game save so maybe they will come later."

open up regedit(google it if u dont know how) and find this key:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BioWare\Mass Effect 2

there shud be a value inside it called path, change it to wherever your main ""mass effect 2"" directory is.

For the first time in my life downloading stuff in TPB i got to thank for this torrent... i was able to finally play all DLC's in an ORIGINAL COPY of Mass Effect 2. 
Like you said, one click, installed!

For people that have an ORIGINAL COPY, this is what I've done:

1- Download torrent
2- Install Mass Effect 2
3- Start Mass Effect 2 and go to ""Extras"" and untip everything about Ceberus network.
Note: No worries if you have already a previous DLC installed.
4- Install torrent & netframe
5- Start a NEW GAME, or CONTINUE your previous save.

BTW, only ""Lair of the shadow Broker"" and ""Overlord"" are worth playing, the rest is meh..

Separate the DLCs and build an installer that lets you choose which ones to install, without forcing people to download it all."
,mavrix,2011-07-01T17:36Z,"On steam, if you had a shortcut on your desktop (via right click-create shorcut on the steam library) it does not properly link.  

I struggled with this for awhile, first using my desktop link (from above).  Then used the direct link from the steam library. 

All the above gave me authorization errors.  

I had been drinking so didn't fully read the instructions and thread.  Once I went into the binary folder though and used that link (runmasseffect2.exe or whatever) it worked just fine.

On a 2nd computer, I had to install their 3.5 framework (rather 3.5.1).  It had 4 and above, but I actually had to disable that via ""turn windows features on or off"" before 3.5.1 would actually install.

So 2 very different computers, one with a legal (steam) version of ME2, one with a TPB rip, one on windows 7x64, one on Vistax32.  One I can very for sure is working fully, on the other (my cousins) he hasn't progressed quite far enough yet to verify everything, but what should be open is available so far."

,illiria,2011-07-27T10:29Z,"@ D_A7

It works with any version of the game.

@ desertlizard

If you want standalone DLCs, not a complete pack, try other torrents, simple as that. Nobody ""firces"" you to download it.
The reason why I made a complete repack is because BioWare official installers are a big pain in the ass. First - you have to install dozens of DLCs separately. Second - they all unpack themselves to ""Temp"" filder, and install from there, which takes *twice* as much time to install.

@ tom1193

If it says ""Mass Effect 2 directory not found"", then you either have a shitty game repack without proper registry keys, or your installation of the game is corrupted. Choose whichever you screwed up - I don't know.

@ Python95

Same as above. Get a proper version of the game and install it. Or reinstall, if something happened with your game installation.

@ raiden10k

Not sure why can't you edit coalesced.ini file, I can. Try to copy it to copy it to a different folder, edit there, then replace. Also make sure the file isn't set to ""Read Only"".

@ somon1995

On some types of internet connections game may still ask for authorization, yes. This is because the DLC crack haven't been configured to work with all types of internet connections, apparently. I don;'t know for sure which ones it doesn't work with. But there is no other crack, so the only thing you can do is disconnect from the internet and play offline. It works.

@ karsmagen

F-Secure detects every and all my installers as viruses. I suggest you either sort it out with them, or get a normal anti-virus. Can't be of more help. You may e-mail them telling the installations made with ""Smart Install Maker"" program are being falsely detected as viruses - let them test it out and remove false positives.

@ filuto

Your bug in ""Shadowbroker"" is exactly what it appears - a bug. Game bug, must be a broken script. No one's to blame, just the game didn't fire some script properly. The only thing you can do is replay from the save. If the bug already persists in the save, however, you may have to replay the game. And better reinstall it.
But no, this isn't DLC pack/crack bug, if that's what you're wondering.

@ theplaya7

Repack was made long ago, before ""Genesis"" came out. ""Genesis"" is just a comic prologue, to let you choose what your Shepard is like, if you haven't played the first Mass Effect game. Most of us have played it, and ""Genesis"" is not needed. It is not an actual content. Just a set of variables to determine your character.

@ Ambro2000

Do you think I would upload a six gigabyte trojan? That... makes sense to you?

@ Ltodemax

I thought I made it very clear in the name and description that it is a DLC/patch repack, not a game repack.

@ 222Fusion

The pack does work with legit copy of the game, but keep in mind that it installs the crack. So your game will be not-so-legit after the installation. If the moral point of it doesn't bother you much, then no problem.

@ xdynamix

Yes, the pack updates the game to version 1.02. Looks like I haven't written that in the description... Pardon me.

@ killerb43

Thank you very much for clearing out compatibility with DA2 promotion. I've had no idea it installs DLCs into different folders.

double-click the entitlements file.

Things that may affect success: install game from scratch, crack game using a diff. torrent (NOT THIS ONE) go in and pre-emptively turn off the autoconnect shit and feedback in options > online; exit game, make sure any external hard-drives / mobile memory devices are unplugged as it can fuck with the pathing, and then do illiria's not so magical 1 click shit.

Ive read it is essential that you do not have the game autoconnected before you give yourself entitelements < important.

Go into the torrent from the link i posted, click the entitlements shit and it will authorize ALL the dlc's you just downloaded. DO NOT rely on this torrent to do it for you, it probably wont work.

,soriah,2011-12-12T03:03Z,"I downloaded this today and am very grateful you took the time to do this. there is so much new stuff that wud of cost me about 4 times more than what i payed for the game itself, plus theres stuff not available anymore. No problems whatsoever and i got everything, i saw ppl were having problems and was a bit worried so i checked. 
For those of you who have been asking if this works with the steam version which u dont get disks for its all downloaded through them, it works fine and you can even carry on launching the game from the steam library rather than the shortcut that gets put on desktop. i checked this and got rid of shortcut only after it was confirmed to have worked. also as orgin is something very much like steam i dont think there will be problems with that either but i cant say for sure.
so thanks a bunch illiria you do good work, make it so much easier for people to get it up and running, and gonna watch your profile for more stuff, already looking into your dragon age dlc. I seeded as much as i can but i cant leave my pc on overnight and when i close bitorrent it removes any finished downloads and i have no idea why (might be my pc as i put a lot of security on it to be on safe side)"

,ssj11_Vejito,2012-01-13T00:27Z,"Okay, to those of you who have the Steam Version of Mass Effect 2 and still want Steam to keep track of your stats and have the DLCs authorized, here is what worked for me:

1.) After downloading, run the DP_Setup.exe. (Might as well run it as an Admin.)

2.) After it installs, go here C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mass Effect 2\Binaries and run RunMassEffect2.exe

3.) *THIS IS IMPORTANT* After it ""authorizes"" (It will seem like the main menu can't be accessed, but don't worry, just wait for awhile and the ""Connect to Cerberus"" will finally show itself.), go and load your game using whatever saves you have. (Oh and if you did not turn off the automatic connections in the Online options, do so and repeat step 2. You should do this using the original Mass Effect 2 launcher. Either through the library or the MassEffect2.exe in the Binaries folder.)

4.) Once you are in the game, save it. (You can go to your terminal to confirm if all the DLCs are installed correctly, but it is not necessary.)

5.) Exit the game. (You will notice that Steam does not indicate you were in Mass Effect 2 even though you were. This is because you were running the game through illiria's cracked version.)

6.) Now you can run Mass Effect 2 normally. (Either from your Steam library or go back to the Binaries folder and run the original MassEffect2.exe.)

7.) You should now have the DLCs installed/work properly while at the same time have Steam still keep track of how much hours you put into the game.

Disclaimer: Seems like people take advice from these comments and if it does not work in their system, they think everyone else is wrong. That is not the case. What may work for some, it may not work for others. So there. If this does not work, don't get mad, just accept that sometimes things just aren't going to work out.

Hope this helps out other people and many kudos to illiria for this!"

,SadeMoro,2012-01-27T08:32Z,"So, I got the Deluxe edition of ME 2 on Steam, and I was wondering, If i installed all this DLC onto my legit version of ME2 via Steam, what are my odds of being found out? I'd rather not get banned and all.

I'd normally just use the pirated version and transfer my save over, however the pirated version of this game is having some bad graphical problems which don't exist on my Steam version.

So, can I install this on Steam without fear of getting banned? What about with Peerblock + Steam in offline mode, would that work?"
,ssj11_Vejito,2012-01-27T09:25Z,"-SadeMoro

Don't worry, nothing will happen. I've done it. Steam doesn't and can't trace that. EA/Bioware do that and even that doesn't matter. So it is okay to install this without the fear of you getting banned or whatever fear you have.

By the way, if need help getting this pack to work, read my comments on the bottom of page 9. (The previous page before this.)

Hope this clears some things up."

I have a legit copy on Steam, and no, this removes it - if this pack works for you I guess you could just reinstall Texmod (seems logical enough) though I don't know for sure.

First off, thanks heaps to you, illiria, this is an amazing pack. I'm having problems getting it to work, though, and I have some questions:

- There's a so-called ""trojan"" called Artemis something that my McAfee is picking up and automatically deleting. Searching around shows it's important to getting the DLC to work, and that there's no way to stop McAfee deleting it. Do you have any alternatives/workarounds/any advice to help?

- I'm still planning on getting this pack up and running, but if I wanted to uninstall how would I go about it? I'm guessing it's more complex than just deleting certain files.

If it helps, I have Windows 7, a bought copy on Steam with free Cerberus DLC installed, and I've always had the feedback/automatic connections turned off."

Anyway, it ended up working after I installed a separate DLC torrent from here (one of the AAPs); that one activated all of the DLC. I guess the crack in this doesn't work for some people. I reinstalled Texmod with no problems, too. Anyway, thanks again illiria!

One last thing - there is a bug of sorts in LOTSB, when I play as FemShep the wardrobe changer on the ship is always a male torso, and the dossiers refer to Shep as a he. Why is that? Last I remember the dialogue acknowledged Femshep's gender. I lol'd at first but now it's just weird. Does this happen in legit copies or is it something in the crack?"
