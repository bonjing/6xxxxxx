Dreamtime is an album released by The Stranglers in 1986. The title track was inspired by a belief of the aboriginal peoples of Australia - called Dreamtime. This album appears to be a natural evolution from Aural Sculpture; it contains a mixture of upbeat and thoughtful tracks and includes the addition of pedal steel guitar to complement the horns. Highlights include "Always the Sun", which became a frequently-played live track and "Shaking like a Leaf", with its "Swing"-like feel.

Epic Records were certain this album would be a big success on the back of the much hyped single "Always the Sun" which Epic were sure would go 'top three', and early signs were good with the single receiving substantial radio airplay. However a lacklustre PR campaign led to its disappointing chart placing in the UK singles chart (#30). The band blame a lacklustre marketing campaign for this turn of fortune. This meant that Dreamtime only reached #16 in the album chart, the lowest charting studio album during Hugh Cornwell's recording tenure with the band (1977â€“90). However it should be known that the UK album chart at this time still included compilation albums as well as studio albums, unlike today. In terms of today's charts Dreamtime would have appeared in or around the top 5. Still, the band felt that the album's commercial potential was never fulfilled, especially with regard to the lead single.
