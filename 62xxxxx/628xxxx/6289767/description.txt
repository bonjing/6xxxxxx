Load this torrent, don't start the download.
Click on "Files" tab (lower part of uTorrent program-window) - right-click 
on file you don't need - choose "Don't download". 
(uTorrent would show "Skipped").
Now, start with download.
Other torrent-programs offer very similar step.

Seed after your download is over, you'll seed only the files 
you choose to download. Please. 
Share with other people, best way you can.
But seed. Share. Do not Hit & Run.

----------------------------------
      
NOTE : [20-40] tagged encodes use new tool-chain and new encoding type.
        I would like to keep PS3/Xbox/standalones compatibility - therefore, 
        I need feedback from users of PS3/Xbox and different standalone 
        MP4 capable players and QuickTime users.
        Without feedback I cannot achieve wider compatibility.
        And most certainly, not from the thin air.
