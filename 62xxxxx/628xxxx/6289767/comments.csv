,jawick,2011-04-02T16:21Z,Is there a Camelot episode 1?
,jon4fun,2011-04-02T16:28Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encodes/upload.

Cheers
Jon

Another epic Pack! Thanks for ALL of it."
,Dr-nidO,2011-04-02T17:18Z,"thanks once again...
+1 as always"
,jmac85,2011-04-02T17:27Z,"[+1] Thanks for this pack.
I have a question:
I've read that it is more desirable to encode in resolutions that are either one- half, third, or quarter of the resolution of your display device. Reasoning is, pixels that have to be multiplied by non-whole numbers sometimes are skewed/distorted. I haven't noticed it personally, but are you aware of this anomaly? For instance, I have a 1920x1080p plasma, so if I wanted to maintain small size while only doubling pixels on display I'd do 960x540... Thoughts?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-02T18:52Z,"@jmac85: There is no simple answer to that. End-user and his playback system always has some restrictions. Other side (encoding mechanism) has restrictions too, like preferred frame size should be dividable with 16. H264/x264/AVC even asks for that and is defined as part of h264 standard. 

H264 compressors are able to use and determine (hard-code within) a pixel aspect ratio and manipulate display size, unlike decade old XviD/DivX which possessed some rudimentary ways of those, but never was fully developed.

So, when you encode, you automatically obey the rules of specific codec and specific target - in case of H264,  one must stay ""in"" corresponding H264 built-in profile/level.

For SAR and PAR 1:1 (when you encode) any frame-size (W and H) should be dividable with 16 - just care about division with 16 or 32 and you would be fine.

Number of pixels (W multiplied with H) must be in accordance with target-profile.

Aspect-ratio would be derived from PAR and SAR, keeping in mind that if one pixel is 1x1 (PAR and SAR) and  frame size is 400x300, one can hard-code DAR (display aspect ratio) as 1.2 and NOT 1.33 as he mathematically is, also when pixel has hard-coded aspect ratio of 0.97 - display aspect ratio is different.

Majority of people have no idea about that, and that's why I find all morons who have something to say about - incredibly silly.

I suggest you to hard-code PAR (SAR) as 1:1 and follow modern standards for resolutions. IF (very often) aspect ratio should be corrected (I do that as a rule), simple corrections of output frame sizes in 16 or 32 steps are best and safest way to go.

Beside, all, especially HD resolutions, are well known and you have good wikipedia page for that, with links to other pages about the same subject. "

can i ask are you thinking of doing the green hornet on maybe a 480p cheers"
,Kencoldman,2011-04-02T20:59Z,Thank's for Los Angeles
,froglog,2011-04-02T23:01Z,Thanks for Chaos & The Borgias
,ladderman22,2011-04-03T00:44Z,"thanks for chaos!
(and borgias even though i already got that from an earlier pack)"
,jotalopes,2011-04-03T03:48Z,"Thanks for Battle Los Angeles, The Borgias and all your work."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-03T08:08Z,Thanks guys.
,abobill,2011-04-03T14:27Z,"Thanks for Ricky Gervais, Borgias and Camelot.. btw is this the full 2hr episode of Camelot or just part 2?

Appreciate all the hard work!"
,jawick,2011-04-03T17:11Z,"abobil, it is pt. 2 of Camelot.

twentyforty,  can you please upload pt. 1 in your weekly pack?

Thanks, and thanks for all of your hard work in providing these shows for all of us on a daily basis.  You rock!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-03T21:06Z,"@jawick: Sorry, I can put in Weekly pack only the stuff from that week. Then server is cleaned on Monday morning and new week starts. Sorry, I do  not have money to pay for additional space, even if I know how much that be good."
,abobill,2011-04-04T15:18Z,"@Jawick

The first episode of Camelot is in the 4th week of February Pack"
