                Drama series moving between the lives of two
                generations of the same family who live at 32
                Brinkburn Street in 1931 and 2011. In 1931, Walter's
                problems deepen as he is told he has lost his job at
                the warehouse on account of his gambling. His worries
                go from bad to worse as Billy offers him a way to pay
                back what he owes, by helping with a church robbery.
                And in 2011, Ellie seizes on a doctor's appointment
                to discuss IVF. Nick promises to join her, but when a
                job opportunity comes along, he breaks his promise
                and Ellie has to face the depressing facts alone.
