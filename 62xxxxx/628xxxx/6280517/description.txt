The sequel to 2009's Need for Speed: Shift introduces a helmet camera view designed to re-create the experience of driving 200 miles per hour from the driver's vantage point. Also included are nighttime races, wear-and-tear on both cars and tracks, and a renewed emphasis on simulation-style handling and performance. The "autolog" system lets you share your racing milestones, such as pictures and videos, with friends online. You'll also receive in-game challenges based on your friends' top performances. Customize your vehicle's engine, body, suspension, and other parts to impress rivals and outgain the competition. The limited edition version of Shift 2, available exclusively via pre-order, includes three in-game cars that are instantly accessible from the start: the Lamborghini MurciÃ©lago LP640, Nissan Silvia spec.R Aero (S15), and Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV. An additional 40 career race events are included as well, from manufacturer showdowns to "old versus new" battles.
