Pilot :
Once Amber decided to get her friends and go out of town. But as usual something goes wrong, they decide to stop. That's where the nightmare starts, bloodshed and hunger. Everything would be fine if they would drive the new car from the saloon but they decided that the old falling-apart shitty car would be better. As you probably think it did broke down on the way, in the middle of nowhere in a really creppy and scary place.
