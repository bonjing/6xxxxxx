Synopsis: my last version "lite" was designed for casual PDF users with speed,
size, and portability in mind. But there have been a few people who require 
more advanced features. Of course, the "lite" label would no longer apply.
I have added a few more features without impacting the size and portability 
too much. If you require more features, you might as well install Acrobat.
