Hollywood Undead meld the rap-rock aggression of Limp Bizkit, the brutally honest self-examination of Eminem and the objectionable content of gangster rap. Hailing from Hollywood, California, this six-piece unit perform under pseudonyms and wear masks on stage to protect their identity. Embodying the dark underside that lies beneath the phony glitz of Hollywood, the bandâ€™s songs often revel in the desperate ugliness of the cityâ€™s less-glamorous elements. Gleefully amoral, Hollywood Undead demonstrate a penchant for casual sex and an obsession with angst-fueled diatribes leveled at their enemies

Hollywood Undeadâ€™s start was hardly momentous. In 2005, two Los Angeles friends, Deuce and J-Dog, collaborated on a few tracks and decided to post them online. But soon, interest started circulating, prompting the guys to form Hollywood Undead with Charlie Scene, Da Kurlzz, Funny Man and Johnny 3 Tears. Originally, the band also included Shady Jeff, but he left the group before their debut dropped in 2008.
