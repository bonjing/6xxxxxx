A story about a cowboy who heads west to find his freedom and the many eccentric people he meets on the way.

A 30-year-old immigrant butcher, an East German flower child in search of love and marriage, a dubious travelling salesman with a bad golf swing, a confused Native man on a vision quest, a gnarled old rancher and an ageing yellow Honda Civic. Together, they drive and putt their way into a world of comic coincidence and soulshaking experiences, until they eventually find their own homes on the range, where what\'s important "aint what is, it's what could be." This rumbling, rollicking, comic adventure takes the Western myth and rides it for all it's worth!
