,keith28,2011-04-02T19:35Z,i have a legit copy man ive been tryingto figure this out for a few days i cant get it to run. I can't open up console in single player mode it doesnt even sh ow i have the the zombie map and i put the maps in the right folders if anyone could help i would greatly app ive been all over the net trying to figure this out
,keith28,2011-04-02T19:36Z,i did use the unlocker and followed the directions at unlocker url i did not understand where to put in zombie key in config cfg
,alle53,2011-04-02T20:24Z,i have a legit copy it doesnt work
,keith28,2011-04-02T21:03Z,i got it all right its just that my black ops wont open single player console mode multiplayer console works. But that doesnt help ive changed the seta monkey toy to 0 in config cfg did all that binding console mode isnt available on my black ops copy i just recently bought it so i guess its patched
,connorlawd,2011-04-02T23:57Z,"the latest patch diabled the console and made the config uneditable
to undo that start up the game then edit it with the binds that look like this:
BIND 9 ""zombie_cosmodrome""
above is for ascension then close the game and start it up again and push the button you binded"
,connorlawd,2011-04-02T23:59Z,they disabled the console in the latest patch so you should be good to go but remember to to start with the unlocker everytime ;]
,keith28,2011-04-03T06:09Z,i just keep getting unknown command message
,keith28,2011-04-03T07:52Z,i got it i wasnt typing map b4 zombie_cosmodrome duhhh......lol thnx fer tha help guy
,nelwyn,2011-04-04T22:58Z,How do you select Ascension in a private match? It doesn't show up at all. Is there a command to make it switch or something? I got it working in single player with the bind command only.
,TheApplication,2011-04-08T21:18Z,Thank you mate. Steam failed at downloading this content so I have to manually download these files and place them where they belong.
,Boss2212,2011-04-14T04:36Z,I figure out how to use zombie map in single player mode...but don't know how to enable zombie map for private match or online...anyhelp???
,luckyl94,2011-04-25T23:32Z,"someone please please help me. im probably making a very basic mistake, but please bear with me. I'm trying to get ascension to work in single player. I went to the config and changed the monkeytoy, and the console seems to be working. However, whenever I bind a key to open the map (bind 0 ""map zombie_cosmodrome"") or type ""map zombie_cosmodrome"" into the console, it doesn't work. I open kino der toten on single player, then press 0 or type the command, and i end up getting a strange black screen with a large time counter on the bottom right hand corner. "
,reeferwarrior420,2011-04-26T06:21Z,where do i put this file now -(Firststrike_english.7z)?
,connorlawd,2011-05-01T15:48Z,@luckyl94 you need to have the legit game from steam then have it fully updated then look at my comments above
,ZiperiS,2011-05-06T17:23Z,"I dont know, Im a little scared of this trying, you sure I wont get a ban from steam for this?"
,OneTwoWilliams,2011-05-10T08:56Z,"DONT GET THIS, IT'S FAKE"
