V/8.5-9 

Cam scale.
The on the plus side audio is fairly good for cam audio, it sounds like a human is speaking to you in real life, not over a phone or through a tin can. It is fairly full of life and quite listenable. On the minus side it gives you the accurate theatre experience (people eating popcorn loud as fuck, kids shouting) which detracts from the audio a bit but is expected but would probably not be different if you were in a theatre.

Video is very solid and clear for a Cam (HD cam?) and the colours are not washed, messes up, too blue/green/etc. It is very sharp- you can tell where actors are looking and very little details which would usually be overlooked on a cam can be noticed. It however, suffers from very occasional movement, most notably about 12 minutes in where someone gets up and walks past the camera, knocking it or something, and then again a few minutes later where I imagine the operator hides the camera for about 12 seconds, however audio continues for the entirety. Overall, could be passed for DVD video if the whites were a bit lower and there was no movement."

I don't like movement of a cam. 
But if it's true what you've said than is it a really good camera movie. 

Thanks for the information ;)"

,jawznmyt,2011-03-31T03:55Z,i agree very good for a cam bar the bit were the cam gets hidden for under 6 secs so its not very much u miss out on and the audio is still there so u dnt lose the plot and easily follow wot u dnt see well worth watching if u want tae see this movie and thanx uploader !!!!
