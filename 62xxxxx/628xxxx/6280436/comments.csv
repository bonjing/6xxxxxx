You maybe really uploaded the release without any virus but who do you think will trust the uploader if he only uploaded 1 torrent and he doesnt have a skull? :D
I Think NO ONE!!!
People download the release from a trusted uploader dont download this one it may be dangerous for your pc i just give you warning i dont care if you download this :D"
,DeantheSnake,2011-04-05T20:27Z,You can find the trusted upload if you search right for some reason you cant find it if you type *Crysis 2* in Search :D
