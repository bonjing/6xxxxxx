,YouCanTrustMe,2011-04-01T02:52Z,"CommView for Wifi is so simple to use! Works with Windows! YEAH!  * * I have been using it for years. 
And combined with AirCrack (also runs in Windows) YEAH! I have had a lot of success with just these 2 programs. And I didnâ€™t have to install any other OSâ€˜s! 
Very Simple for me to run, which I like! A 5 year old can crack Wifi with my setup! I have had about an 85% success rate. 

Sorry if you are offended that your stuff is included with this upload.  The first line in the description says THESE ARE NOT MINE, GOT ALL OFF INTERNET! 

I DID NOT FORMAT OR CHANGE A THING ABOUT THEM OUT OF RESPECT TO THE OWNERS OF THE FILES - SINCE THESE ARE NOT MY FILES I WILL NOT BE CHANGING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM!

I mainly did this upload to see if I can get someone to CRACK A NEWER VERSION OF TAMOSOFTS COMMVIEW FOR WiFi. My new laptop has a different/new Wireless N Adapter that doesnâ€™t work with the older cracked version of CommView I use on my older machine. 

Just trying to share a few files with a few friend! RELAX DUDE!"
,Wi-Foo-er,2011-04-01T17:55Z,"i was NOT offended that you used my stuff, i was more offended that you offered a ""WPA"" wordlist thst is'nt realy suitable for WPA, and reqires a lot of work to get it just right.

As for CommView, i dont like Windows for hacking anything as hacking with Windows is like dancing with no leggs 

You much better off with Backtrack 4 (Linux)  As linux is always fater than windows and your not restricted to just wi-fi networks

I only use windows for games

Sorry for any missunderstandings i was just making a point"

Here is one I put up: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6312214/Gsplit__FILE_SPLITTER___Great_for_splitting_WPA_wordlist_diction"
,donkeydick121,2011-04-16T03:16Z,"Why on earth didn't you compress these with WinRAR ???

They would have been reduced to 10 to 15% of the original size !!!"
,an0nym_,2011-11-04T15:04Z,"Hello! I use backtrack 5 with usb, and boot from it, where do i put this wordlist?  thanks!"
,losfreddy,2012-01-01T17:58Z,cool dictionary.  i posted to the desktop on backtrack 5 and it works.  Havent actually cracked a code yet.  Does this include a number dictionary?
,Zephaniah,2012-04-21T04:14Z,"Sorry YouCanTrustMe, Wi-Foo-er is correct here. If you are uploading a torrent caled ""Wordlist for Cracking WPA/WPA"", then you should take the time to remove all words that are less than 8 characters, or greater than 64 characters. Words outside those limits can't be set as WPA passwords anyway, so it is wasting people's time and bandwidth 1) downloading the useless words, and 2) having their computer try with the useless words.

Otherwise just call it a big wordlist for cracking in general, and don't say that it's specifically for WPA cracking. Cheers."

But whoever is responsible for this, 



THANX"
,stepking2,2012-06-07T23:35Z,"This torrent isn't actually 8,5GB.
After I ran it through a trim script, which removed non ascii characters, words less than 8 and bigger than 63 comments and dupes, its only 3,6GB ;-)"
