Anyone remember how MoveOn.org got started?
Am I mistaken it originated to get attention to the woman in prison in Arkansas who refused to EVEN testify in the Witch Hunt against Pres. Clinton?
Got a joke next."
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-31T07:10Z,"Star says to Bill one day.
""How DO you get so many Woman? Why are so good in bed?""
Clinton says.
""Well I just turn off the lights and walk up to the bed and (step on a duck and the duck quakes) and that seems to get us in the mood""
So that night Star goes home to his house (with his duck)...he goes in his wife's room as she is in bed. He turns off the lights. Goes to the side of the bed (and steps on the duck and the duck quakes)
and Stars wife says...""Bill is that you?""

Anyway...(the duck is a metaphor its an old Lyndon Johnson joke)"

,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-31T09:51Z,Sorry for the off topic comments... I get wore out in wrting these and need to take a break sometime. I am not trying to blog here...I am trying desperately to get attention to what has happened to myself and so many others now. And sometimes I go off topic. Sorry. And just as I was seeding this.my entire router was knocked of this just now..not just a DOS attack but no access to a DNS server for 20 minutes or so.
