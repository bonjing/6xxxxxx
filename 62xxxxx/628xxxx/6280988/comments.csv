,RickyTheFish,2011-04-17T14:34Z,"I can't tell by the screens included in the description... is this better than the TNT TS? The TNT TS was actually one of the best TS I've ever seen; that doesn't mean it was great, but it was definitely quite good for a TS. It was rather dark throughout, though. How does this rip compare to the TNT TS?"
,RickyTheFish,2011-04-17T14:41Z,"Also, @soccerbuff, if you use Windows, definitely get PeerBlock - I've never gotten any notifications from my ISP and I've downloaded over 1TB of data over 1508 torrents. Always keep your lists updated and you shouldn't have any problems; for example, my PeerBlock is currently blocking over one billion IP addresses, and a large amount of those are P2P addresses.

I currently have a torrent uploading with a ratio of 665.798, and I haven't heard anything about that, either."
,htndabong,2011-04-17T16:04Z,It does not matter if you use peerblock! I was getting a letter and email like once a week. Then i started using a different isp and they never send letters or emails. It seems to be that only some isp's really care. Oh and ive gotten 7 letters in the past two months so i guess they dont plan on doing anything.
,edwar69,2011-04-17T18:47Z,Let you know that texted is not working with subtitle so plase correctly it .

,badluck13_7,2011-04-19T16:10Z,"@htndabong & soccerbuff- you guys are gonna feel real dumb when agents from the fcc and fbi put a post hole driver filled with concrete through your moms front doors. If youre getting multiple letters that means the MPAA knows what your doing and they will actually pay the overtime to the federal agents to come and arrest your asses, trust me, ive seen it done. You need to be running redundant blocking programs with ipredator or a program like it with your pp turned off. Im a +terabyte downloader as well(not all from this one site, thats just retarded and TPB is trash now compared to what it used to be) and Ive had people using the same wireless signal as me get letters, but never one with my name on it. I've slowed down a bunch on my dl'ing so its not a big concern anymore. 

Good luck, stay safe, and fuck uncle sam!"

,Drake9669,2011-05-06T20:17Z,"@buddahass:  if you are a reader, and if you have a vivid imagination. I would suggest you sit down and read the first Harry Potter book. Do not judge the tale based on the 1st half of the last part of the story because you will be allowing yourself to miss out on a wonderful tale. If you have kids, then you definitely should give the book(s) a try. They are wonderful and easy stories to read to your kids, or have them read to you."
