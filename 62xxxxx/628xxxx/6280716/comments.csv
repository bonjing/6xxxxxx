,ne55eebee,2011-05-14T13:57Z,"This file is a virus. It is inbuilt - Trojan packed with PE_patch.PECompact. It was picked up by kaspersky as soon as the torrent finished downloading. I do not recommend this download at all.
NO NO NO."
,Mornai,2011-05-15T22:09Z,"ne55eebee, that is a blatant lie. Kaspersky is not a very good antivirus program, so I'm not surprised it sent off a false alarm. I have played and finished this episode with no problems at all.

Good work, rlf-rls, can't wait for more to come!"
