,Wiccapyre,2011-12-20T03:49Z,@crazyhawaiian Really?? First of a system restore for a virus is stupid it will not get rid of the virus usually it will only compound it. Second it is a crack it is a program it alters the way another program functions and virus scanner see that and assumes virus. What makes it a true virus is when it does something you don't intend it to do. Which what you intend it to do is break the copy right protection put in place so you can play the game with out buying it. Do some research find out how cracks work what they do and you will have a better time.
