It depends on which software you want to crack. Keep in mind that there isn't any UNIVERSAL method of how to crack any software. Usually the less size is software, the easier is to crack it. So, if we talk about lighter programs then you have to modify script that is inside the ""exe"" file. First, you have to search for such words like ""license"", ""registration"", ""activated"", ""registered"", ""activated"", ""purchased"" etc. When you find that, then you have to modify that info to make from trial, fully-activated version.        
I know it doesn't seem like tutorial, because there is too few information, it's more like sshort overview of what should you do. :)"
