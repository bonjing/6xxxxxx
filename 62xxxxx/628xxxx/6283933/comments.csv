Did`nt like the show at first, but it grows on you. -I though ForestĂÂ´s part was very annoying, but now that I`m used to his weird body language, and the strange way he talks, I think the show is actually quite good. -The original series is, of course, a master piece, and can`t be matched at all by this one."
