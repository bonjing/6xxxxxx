CD1: Raga Malkouns starts out (Alap) in a very slow and reflective way, and the whole piece is performed as when Ravi is at his best.
CD2: Contains the far-out Sindhu Bhairavi-duet with Ali Akbar Khan (playing the Sarod). And another personal favourite Rajyan-Kalyan from the Teacher album is added as a bonus.
CD3: Is a classic album with a remastered LP-sound. The Raga Bilashkani Todi with its very hypnotic sound of the tamboura ringing in the background will make you... fly. Well... if your mood is right, that is ;)


Note: and if you are new to this music, I think the best approach is to try and listen to it â€in the momentâ€ as every note (and cycle) stands by itself as well as it connects to the next. Making a traditional Raga (often full of improvisation) to begin in one place and end up somewhere else... A raga is played like life itself, give it a try. Well, nuff said: Just listen!
