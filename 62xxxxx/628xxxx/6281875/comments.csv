,some-young-guy,2011-03-30T08:53Z,"@Uitzraor....""Seed Please""

Because this title is so difficult to locate elsewhere on this site, correct?  Isn't the entire purpose of this P2P site to seed files for peers to download?  So asking for people to seed, kind of goes without saying, don't ya think?"
,Uitzraor,2011-03-30T09:08Z,I ask to forgive me for my English. I translate through the translator. I from Russia. The matter is that on on it tracker it is always very bad with a speed. The people very greedy. Feasts give for the speed 3 rb\s and it is very sad
,quank861,2011-03-30T11:22Z,"@Uitzraor ...this is rather new upload so there are not many ppl finished the download yet so there is much more leechers than seeders,that's why it could be little slow.."
