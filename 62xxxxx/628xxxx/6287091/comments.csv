,080026,2011-04-02T06:27Z,"I can't find the installer, how do I install this?"
,FieroGT,2011-04-02T09:11Z,"welp it works, but as far as i can see its unplayable, graphics slow as dirt. tried various graphics settings. but its no good. any other games  play smooth. so its not me. so i dunno?...."
,Pirate81,2011-04-02T10:16Z,For me the same-unplayable.i think the instaler is F**K up.any graphic setting-no change+missing some setting.
,JerombaCZ,2011-04-02T13:54Z,"this game is another example of how to fuck game with good history. Bugged, unoptimalized with stupid linear ( and bugged too ) campaign. Graphics is lagging no matter what level you set. First patch included in this release, tens new waiting to come out."
,MACtic,2011-04-02T16:48Z,It's just a matter of time. They will deal with all issues in the upcoming patches.
,bolle321,2011-04-02T18:39Z,"so you can update the game with this ?

,Juliebiro,2011-04-03T00:29Z,"I just finished the whole installation, and I have a small concern. My AVG antivirus thinks there is some virus in rendobj.dll. I've always praised FLT work so much that I don't take it too seriously, but has anybody noticed same alert?

,toyking,2011-04-03T03:13Z,"installer didnt work for me, was hoping to play the game but  i get a instant applacation has got a error crap, im running windows 7 64bit ult, I7-2600k 16gigs of ram gtx 260's in sli"
,TheUbernator,2011-04-03T12:00Z,"Well, if you like combat flight sims then yes, it is good. Have you played any of the IL-2 games before? This one is very similiar.

Thanks for this anyway. :)"
,BeAware2011,2011-04-03T12:04Z,"That fucking game, gets stuck while loading the mission or training! How to fix that shit?!"
,Juliebiro,2011-04-03T13:04Z,"Well, I was stuck too when loading mission, but I solved it by dl very last graphics drivers. Be aware to have your OS up-to-date also, and to let the game update itself.
Now, the game works fine, but I can't properly pilot the plane, and to say it straight, with my average computer, this is a slideshow of english countryside pictures, even at lowest detail level. I was afraid of that, as Oleg Maddox stated that the game was too powerful for any machine, apart from the brand new ones.
I'm going to uninstall it, it's unplayable. I will buy it when it goes budget line, and I have a better computer. "
,JerombaCZ,2011-04-03T13:49Z,Ubernator if this is similiar to older IL2s then you are king of Mars
,DakotaDC3,2011-04-03T15:10Z,"It tries to install STeam when i run the installer, but i already have it installed. If i cancel Steam installation, the game doesn't install. What crap is this? How to install the fuckin game?"
,DakotaDC3,2011-04-03T15:24Z,"Ok, i figured out the installation thing, but now when i press launcher.exe i get an error and it closes. What's up?"
,Doliko,2011-04-03T15:27Z,Nice one extremezone. As always. Does anyone know if you can play this game with the saitek x52 joystick?
,DakotaDC3,2011-04-03T15:53Z,Do i need to have Steam opened to play the game?
,Jimstalk,2011-04-03T17:36Z,"@Doliko

Yes,you can.Actually im using a HOTAS Cougar but i also have the x52.Cougar offers more realism but its pretty old.Its made from steel thatswhy i think that the cougar is  more suitable for this game.


Notice:

If guys experence problems with the graphics , make sure to install the NEWEST drivers for ur graphics card.I had the same issues with you but after updating my MSI HD 5850 everything worked fine.The game has many bugs so im waiting for the first patch or update"

,hoggy87,2011-04-04T21:55Z,"Is there any way of installing this on a 64bit system? The installer provided just comes up with a x86-x64 OS error. I've tried using Phoenix, but it says the disk1.sis file has no 'Apps' section and it can't unpack. Any thoughts??"
,cripplefinger,2011-04-05T00:58Z,author of torrent is a fucked moron with a pass for rar

,ToadFoster,2011-04-05T10:21Z,"If you're wondering how to install, first mount the .iso, then open it and go to the folder called Fairlight, from there click on the file called installer and follow the onscreen instructions from there."
,voste,2011-04-05T14:13Z,"i instaled the game
the game starts but when i wnt to play a mission 
it dont want to load it
can somebody help me....????"
,Jimstalk,2011-04-05T14:36Z,"this is what ive done in order to install:

1)Mount the file you've downloaded (flt-ilcd.iso) using daemon tools 

2)Run the installer

3)Youll be asked to provide some kind of a serial code // dont do anything just close the installer

4)go back to flt-ilcd.iso>open it>go to the fairlight folder

5)Run their installer (using admin rights{right click & run as an administrator})

6)Install the game 

7)restart

8)go to C:>Program Files>Il-2 cliffs of dover 

9)Run  launcher.exe (make a shortcut in ur desktop if u want)

10) ""Enjoy the game"" (Run a dogfight over the sea cuz if u try to fly over terain ur FPS will be reduced bellow 15.....)

Thats what ive done to install it.Everything works fine for me (except the game's bugs which are really annoying)

system:

ATI HD 5850 (MSI)
 Gigabyte H55M motherboard
4gb RAM
2TB hard disc
Win 7 32 bit SP1 
Intel Core i7 (3.04 gHz i think....)

,kingwael,2011-04-11T16:03Z,"@eheehe i have the samne problem with my game but i think its because my graphics card isnt supported in the game i read the minumium qualifications of the game and a few graphics cards are supported like those :

,alvarthus,2011-04-12T10:31Z,"Eheehe: here i found this one. hope it works. i have same problems as u.

3. Q: I see a black screen when launching the game.
A: You are most likely running an Nvidia card with 266.xx drivers. There's a problem with that particular driver version.
It can be resolved by either rolling back to a previous driver version, such as 257.21, or upgrading to the just-released 270.51.
The issue can also be resolved by manually adjusting one of the driver parameters in the registry. This is for more advanced users. Please modify the registry at your own risk.

Start - Run
regedit
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Contro l\GraphicsDrivers
Edit - New - DWord
Name = TdrDelay 
Value Data = 12"
