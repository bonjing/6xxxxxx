"Pilot"

A female jogger is found floating in the Schuylkill 
River. Dr. Megan Hunt teams up with her partner, 
medical investigator and former cop Peter Dunlop, 
under the watchful eye of their boss, Chief Medical 
Examiner Dr. Kate Murphey, who is very aware of 
Megan's gifted but polarizing work style. Megan's 
colleagues, Dr. Ethan Gross and Deputy Chief 
Medical Examiner Dr. Curtis Brumfield, must find 
their own way to work alongside the new medical 
examiner. Megan's investigation takes her out in 
the field where she meets old-school cop Detective 
Bud Morris, who is exasperated by Megan's tenacity 
and bull-headedness. But his partner, Detective 
Samantha Baker, possesses a quiet respect for 
Megan's input, even if Morris doesn't. Meanwhile, 
as she's is trying to solve the female jogger's 
death, Megan has to solve a personal puzzle of her 
own -- what is the perfect present for her 
daughter's 12th birthday?

Enjoy :)
