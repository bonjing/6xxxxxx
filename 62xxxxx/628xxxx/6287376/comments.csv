,FrothyAss,2012-02-10T08:49Z,"Yes, its true it is NOT in .iso form. It also doesnt work anymore because it says its missing a q2btns.dll.  I mounted and tried both the .mdf and .mds files. Neither worked and both had the same error. No virus or malware or other nonsense found with Avast! Internet Security or Malwarebytes Pro (EVEN MALWAREBYTES PRO, CALLS EVERYTHING A VIRUS/TROJAN). Just a bad file is all."
,FrothyAss,2012-02-10T08:52Z,Im not saying Malwarebytes found viruses or trojans i was saying it usually calls everything a virus/trojan/other false alarms.
