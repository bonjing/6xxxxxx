this is 720p you moron. hardly any films are full 16:9, 1280 x 720, most are letterboxed like this one."

You are a moron, sir, moron extraordinaire. Letterboxed 720p material is usually cut to around 1280x528.
Now, the description for this torrent says it's 1920x800 (1080p cut) while the title is 720p."
