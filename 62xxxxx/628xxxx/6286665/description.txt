Now Just Passing this along PSP Tools to sign/convert iso files to be playable on OFW
I'll try to make this as easy-to-understand as possible for everybody, so here's the simple facts.
If you're having problems with the images, right-click and select "View Image"
1 - Many PSP games can be resigned to play on official firmware (OFW)
2 - This tool only supports .iso files (remember this, it's important)
3 - This tool has a hard size limit of 728MB right now (that's the biggest PSN demo to date)
4 - The games signed this way only play in firmwares 6.31 or HIGHER (at least until Sony decides to block this somehow)
