After installing the file had a red dot and said I couldn't open it because I don't have access priviledges. How to override that?"

Same happens with me. I run the installer and it says successfully installed but when i tried to open the program there's no icon, just the folder with the red dot and says i don't have the permission to open it. I have a Mac Os X 10.6.7 ... what could it be the problem?"
,eld5555,2011-08-07T22:53Z,"I have a fix for the red dot on the folder(cant be opened ) simply install app , go into app folder , find toast folder with red dot on it , right click and copy folder , you will be able to access app from new folder , then delete original(locked folder) and rename copied folder (delete the copy title) and u should be good to go "
,mrbean1905,2011-10-09T02:11Z,"Works well, thank you. Serial is in the Read Me file."
