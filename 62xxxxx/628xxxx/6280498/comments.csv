,Poeticile,2011-04-03T10:30Z,"To all downloaders - this torrent does NOT work. Your download stalls at 99.9%, and unzip attempts will set off a chain of endless unzipping. I unzipped the results over 5 times, same results. "

Is anyone can upload it or give me a link to download it ? (I already have Europa universalis, so if you just have the two add or a link for them, that's perfect too)
