No, no, there's no problem."
,jacer2323,2011-04-07T09:54Z,"appreciate your work so no complaints but i'm having the same problem.  I end up with a bunch of zips, all different sizes, and it doesn't extract.

did it twice, rechecked the hash and after it ""passes"" , it completes then goes to seed."
,raidenms,2011-04-08T04:26Z,32 OR 64 Bit?
,vekin,2011-04-19T08:25Z,"2.2M e-vl7405.zip

,iabhijit,2011-05-01T13:57Z,"Hi Stun, could you please upload a tested, non-multipart copy? Many of the zip files here are corrupt and wont open... neither on ubuntu nor on winzip.

Thanks.

,baloo2.1,2011-05-02T07:07Z,"Jeezzz man, how stupid can you get? Not only RAR-split, but every RAR file ZIP-ed? 

And on top of that, twelve of the ZIP files are corrupt. GAHHHH... What a waste of time... :("
,andremo,2011-06-21T12:23Z,"Some of the zip files have an ""unsupported method""
The files that do decompress have half a split rar archive. Therefor this data is useless"

DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,tasos9,2011-07-23T12:48Z,Ah! And MAFIAA thanx for the try anyway. Shit happens.
,th3_v0ice,2011-08-06T08:56Z,"Torrent is not worth downloading. I managed to get around ""Unsupported method"" and ""Data error"" but you just can't fight with CRC error. Thanks for uploading it, but next time make sure you pack it in one archive, that will be compress it more then enough."
