,exaulted,2011-03-30T16:34Z,The quality in those screenshots sure don't match an 11GB video. The screenshots look very grainy. I'll pass on this one until I see some comments regarding the quality.
,Movier85,2011-03-30T17:20Z,please seed. seeding too when finished downloading.
,stravadi,2011-03-30T20:41Z,thanks
,thodoris5321,2011-03-31T00:23Z,when you upload movies especially in this size it's better to put a sample video too :)
,burl123,2011-03-31T01:55Z,"@exhaulted
Film is MEANT to have grain you ignorant twat. Film shouldn't look like your favourite plastic surgery'd actors and over saturated hues or your fucking CG Transformers nonsense. 

Thanks BOZX and all the seeders, the rip is great."
,Quattrox,2011-03-31T15:44Z,Nice up man. Thanks a lot. Need more seeders tho ;)
,TobiasHUN,2011-03-31T22:07Z,thnx
,amin_parazit,2011-04-01T05:09Z,"ey is this thing any good?
cause its 1920x800 !
but other great 1080p movies are 1920x1080 ?!!!
also its to big with way less seeders than downloaders
so is it worth it?"
,amin_parazit,2011-04-01T05:14Z,"download speed .6 kbps :)
i think it will finish downloading by next month :)"
,elucider,2011-04-01T14:28Z,can anyone comment on the quality?
,carl000,2011-04-03T08:06Z,"please put up a sample video man, 10gb download means half month of download for me, i can't decide with so many contradictory comments, and thanks for this great upload :) "
,Thomsken,2011-04-04T00:13Z,Thanks mate!
,asdfg8732,2011-04-04T09:46Z,"Thank you very much (BOZEX)

Guys ! 

Q: Is (ESiR) the best uploader for BluRay ? 

and what do you say about (BOZX)"
,Darkiss888,2011-04-04T18:34Z,"BOZX has always been great!

I will seed as much as I can :-) Thank you!"
,MitsEvX,2011-04-05T00:18Z,"The quality is outstanding as expected! :D Thanks, you're a great uploader! ;-) I'll seed for a while ;-)"
,papitow,2011-04-05T06:39Z,"Some1 enlighten me pls, cuz I'm trying to figure out how some uploaders got this blu ray if the blu ray disc of this movie is only gonna be out on April 15th."
,asdfg8732,2011-04-05T13:54Z,"@papitow 

Because the time is different from country to another 

or mybe it had been stolen "
,papitow,2011-04-05T20:12Z,"Yeah I know release dates are different from place to place, but I think USA is the first place where it's gonna be released. And their release date is April 15th."
,CSS.Hana,2011-04-07T08:38Z,"Haven't seen the movie if it's grainy of not, but will review once it's done downloading.

Already at 10.64 GB. Will let it seed for about a month for all you people to enjoy."
,CSS.Hana,2011-04-07T12:14Z,"Movie is pretty grainy.

Probably can fix it off a bit with PowerDVD in video editing."
,trashyboy,2011-04-09T07:50Z,"Hey papitow, you think WRONG.
 Actually the release date of the 11th April at Amazon in the UK is actually four days ahead of the US on the 15th April."
,htndabong,2011-04-11T01:44Z,Forget the release date!! You think they ship all of these movies the day they come out? Hell no I worked at a movie stop and all the people who worked there were aloud to take home 1 movie a night. They got most movies atleast 2 weeks before they came out.    So thats one way the new movies get on here.

,Exodus1992,2011-05-05T15:26Z,"Great torrent, great download speeds. will seed. 
Only one complaint, idk what it is but seeing if anyone can help. 

Anytime lights are flashing, or if somthing fast is happening, I get a weird pixelation across the entire screen. Say, in the begining when the minister of magic is talking and the cameras flash it does it :( "
,jeromedevine,2011-05-12T03:45Z,cblovernrosa @ h0tmail dot c0m - if your nice i'll get on cam
,dzenanz,2011-05-22T12:27Z,"The aspect ratio seems to be wrong (faces are taller). The video is displayed as 16:9, when it should have been 23:10 or something?"

A - 9.5
M - 8 
Fantastic quality, but would've not downloaded the 1080p version since the movie isn't that great if it weren't for the fast DL Speed. Many thanks to the uploader ! Awesome torrent !"
,coderX,2011-07-17T17:35Z,mkv? Go fuck yourself. I'm wasting my time converting 10.93 gbs worth of data so I can watch this on my 360.  
,grotler,2011-07-19T13:58Z,"Holy crap, 11Giga?

But thanks anyway, i'm downloading"
,prest1,2011-07-20T19:48Z,plz seed!! :)
,OttifantSir2,2011-08-14T14:09Z,"coderX: Then don't whine on Pirate Bay about it. Whine to Microsoft for not supporting one of the greatest A/V-containers that's available. It may be that others support most of the features and audio-/videocodecs in an MKV-file, but AFAIK, no other container (MP4, MPG, AVI, OGG, etc) has ALL the features and compatibility of MKV.

Or.... There's supposed to be a program called XBMC that apparently ANYONE can load onto their XBox and play pretty much EVERYTHING digital media-related under the sun. Then, no need to convert your movies from MKV."
,bengi010,2011-09-06T15:45Z,"Could someone please explain to me why the size of this movie varies so much?  If you search for HiRes-Movies: Deathly Hallows the top 10 downloads vary anywhere from less the 1 GB to over 10 GB, all claiming to be 720p (one 1080p and just under 12 GB).  I can't figure out why there is so much variation, a few hundred MBs depending on editing and encoding makes sense, but not a difference of 10 GB.  Can anyone explain this to me?"
