,jvezirian,2011-04-06T06:20Z,"Can anyone verify if this is pre cracked, do you just install off the image file, is there any serials to ad, or host files to copy? Just want a little more info about installation?"
,nithin862001,2011-04-11T09:16Z,anyone knows my ip?
,supeazn,2011-04-16T20:29Z,"After waiting 2 weeks for the darn to finish downloading, it won't install ! First time i tried installing (unrar instead buring the iso) it said the path was too long o.0, so everything in that folder to another. Tried installing it from another location and it says encounter a problem. There were some errors when i unrar the iso, maybe that's why. Downloading a free trial and gonna try the serial and the activator. I'll report back. "
,skrublove,2011-04-17T08:47Z,Not working on window 7.  64.. waste of time.
,Wkdst1,2011-04-19T17:12Z,"Hi supeazn. when u unrared the file u put it in a folder. fact. it will only install from hd from the root ie. c:\ NOT c:\Adobe etc.
Hi skrublove im using win7x64 with it no prob. apparently in x64 it installs both x86 and x64 maybe u tried the wrong one?
Serials r in the iso file"
,Wkdst1,2011-04-19T17:24Z,PS This iso was done with PowerIso 4.7 maybe your unpack probs with decompressor r something to to do with version. What did u use?
,khafeez,2011-04-22T10:46Z,"100% Wastage of time. Took three days to download corrupt file. Could not extract, Could burn."
,jusjimi1,2011-04-24T21:26Z,"Opened fine with virtual cd5,then the exe file failed to open any help?"
,caveronrope,2011-04-26T22:01Z,"Thanks smiley I got the power iso 4.7 from pirate bay and used it to extract the file. Copy and paste the iso file into power iso. Dont hit the extract button at the top, just dbl click on the file, it will recommend moving to a temp file, say yes. This will open the pages with instructions, serials, and exe's. Follow smileys directions from here. I did not have to select x64, it did all that automatically. Seems to work well on my win7 x64 machine...  awesome!"
,9824gbi,2011-04-27T19:21Z,"Ok so I am going to help you guys out with installing this as some people seem to be iffy about it. I just installed it and its fully activated and working great!

1. download the torrent and then save it to safe location on your computer

2. Burn to an DVD or download a program called slysoft clone drive(This is freeware and creates a virtual drive for the iso)

3.Your computer should pop up with seteup.exe Click it to run the set up.

4. Go back to the iso on your computer while leaving the serials screen up and right click and open archive with 7 zip to view the serials file in the iso. Its labled serials and has all the install instructions in the iso as well.

5. Copy the serial into the serials screen and continue with the install. 

6. You don't have to have an adobe id on the left bottom corner it says skip this step.

7. Once it is finished do not run any adobe programs yet. The host file must be changed but there is a program in iso already that will do it for you.

8. Open the iso back up and right above the serials file should be an activation application. Open it and run it.

9. Follow the on screen instructions. . . .Just hit any button until the screen goes away.

10. Enjoy Adobe cs5 Master Collection! It is now fully installed to your computer and fully registered as well! I will vouche that this does indeed work as I am using it now. 

DON'T FORGET TO SEED WHEN YOU ARE DONE DOWNLOADING THE FILE! :)"
,9824gbi,2011-04-27T19:22Z,"Forgot to mention to get slysoft's clone drive to open the iso as a virtual cd, just go to the iso and right click it. You will see mount virtual drive as an option. Click that and then you will receive the pop up showing the setup.exe"
,CharcoalKiss,2011-05-02T14:13Z,The Activator file in my download has a Trojan horse FakeAV.NGI.dropper attached to it so I can't open it... I very much hope I don't have to spend another 18 hours downloading the whole thing again... help please.
,drumstyx,2011-05-06T23:52Z,"CharcoalKiss: I can't comment for this torrent in particular, as I haven't downloaded it yet, but many activators and crack patches will show as false positives on antivirus scanners.

What an activator does is similar to what a virus can do, so the code shows a positive to the AV, but it's really harmless."
,matttos,2011-05-13T17:01Z,did some1 manage to install this?
,MelodyTS,2011-05-17T00:35Z,"THANK YOU, Thank You, Thank you!! This one worked for me on a  windows 7 64 machine as slick as could be! 
 I had tried another of this type download and it never fully worked, only some of the programs would open. Made me crazy, even re-installed Windows 7 OS.
 This torrent and crack will work if you follow directions! I fully uninstalled the full CS5 ME  and ran the adobe cleaner tool first, then rebooted and turned off both the internet connection and my AV software first though.  
FYI, Adobe offers a CS5 uninstall clean up tool that is free and cleans all the registry entries from previous installs!

,dbrot,2011-05-17T16:48Z,"AVG or something else refuses to let me run the activator.

Can anyone drop in the host file addresses so that I can add is manually.

,dbrot,2011-05-17T17:09Z,"for those that don't want to run the activator, put this in manually in your host file.

,Jaques123,2011-05-21T01:23Z,"Hi:  Thanks so much for this torrent!  I'm having a problem with the install that I hope someone can help with.  I get to the actual install part and it says ""Please insert Disk AdobeMasterCollection5-trial-English to continue"" and doesn't let me choose a path or anything.  

I'm using Win 7 64 and MagicISO to mount the image.  

Any one else have this problem?  Ideas?  I'm going to try burning the image disk and installing that way to see if this solves it.  "
,Jaques123,2011-05-22T00:54Z,Nope Burning the ISO did not help.  Any ideas?  Any help would be great. 
,jipjapstam,2011-06-02T11:54Z,Every time i open up i am asked for a new serial number. I have fixed the hosts file and stopped the updates but nothing works. The only thing that works is if i dont connect to the internet but i cant leave my computer permanently unplugged from the net. I had the same problem with cs4 so i uninstalled it and installed cs5. It worked fine for a day or 2. I have cs4 working fine on another computer so i cant figure it out. Please help!! 
,caveronrope,2011-07-01T16:08Z,"I just updated all the programs in the collection today, no problems what so ever, all seems to work fine, no issues with updating, communicating with the adobe update service...  I love this software!  Thanks again"

Any solution SmileyB?

,jca3d,2012-01-09T06:22Z,"Edited the hosts file & everything worked fine (my antivirus wouldn't let me run the Activator).  After restarting, however, I needed a new serial. Any ideas how to avoid this? This only came with a certain amount of serials and I'd really rather not have to run through them & then be SOL for this whole Suite I finally got working for piddly tinkering & such.

Any help / ideas would be appreciated.  Thanks."
