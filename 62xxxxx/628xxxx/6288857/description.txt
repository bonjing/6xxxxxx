
In late 2008 five guys in the age 16 - 18 found eachother through a combined interest of music.
Sharing the ideal of a much deeper cause behind their music, it was soon obvious that they would give this
band top priority.
A few months after rehearsing, a demo was recorded in a amature studio. The demo â€œThe Secret About Life & Hopeâ€ was the launch that made them self a name in the scene. And received great reviews in the Close Up magazine, calling them â€œour swedish delicacyâ€.

Since the start in late 2008 afts have played stages all over the country and working hard to spread their music and approach as good as possible.
And during that time writing new material for a new record, and adding a new face to the group. Making it a 6 piece band.
In late 2009 they headed to the studio to record a new record,
the result was a 5 track record called â€œThe Bigger Picture; Hopeâ€
With the new recordings the band established that are aiming to be on top of the scene.
We are here to stay and nothing can stop us
