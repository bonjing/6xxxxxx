,SC187,2011-06-25T01:41Z,@conani  you dont group the files just use winrar to extract the .001 file and it will automatically take the data from the other folders in to one folder.
,trialqw,2012-05-26T12:11Z,"Help I even downloaded latest winrar but I still cannot extract it... the files downloaded are not even in .rar extension.. but in ""Windows Shell Common""...
Please help, .rar, and .iso are a piece of cake but this Windows Shell Common is so new to me :(
I'm wondering if this is fake.. sigh.."
,trialqw,2012-05-26T12:15Z,"@SC187
I have winrar 4.11 there is no option to extract, just archieve or put it in another folder... I have the same problem with conani "".001"""
,trialqw,2012-05-27T17:29Z,"I used hjsplit to join files like "".001"" then used 7zip it looks like only 7zip will work... WinRAR does not seem to work.. but it said CRC failed wtheck...
I clicked on setup, an MS-DOS came up saying Program too big to fit in memory... So in short I cannot install... Is there an error in any of the "".00X"" files? I Downloaded at a speed of 100kbps/sec I wasted 2 days to finish this wtheck... -_-"
