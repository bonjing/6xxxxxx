Chechen Republic, present day. Russian troop positions. Aleksandra Nikolaevna is a grand-mother who has come to see her grandson, one of the best officers in his unit. She will spend a few days here, and will discover a new world. In this male world there are no women, no warmth or comfort. Daily life is meagre, people are shy of their feelings here. Or maybe there simply isnâ€™t time or energy for feelings. Every day and every hour questions of life and death are decided here. And yet it is still a world populated by people.
