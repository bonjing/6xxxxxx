,soupcip,2011-04-04T00:38Z,"Thanks.
Just one matter, tho the quality is good, it surely isn't as good as regular 720p rips this size. It has an upscaled dvd feel to it. Don't know if that is due to the source or or not.  So rating it according to blurayRip 'standards', i'd say its only
V-7
A-8"

,TheyCallMeSkeelZ,2011-04-09T10:40Z,"@ aolo 

The movie was amazing, I got subtitles for it which were decent. 

I didn't know that Jackie was the chef until some time, he's getting old man damn.

Thank you for taking the time, if It's possible do you think that you can upload more movies like this?(When there are some available.) 

Thanks again.
