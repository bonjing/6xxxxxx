Please check the screens and sample before downloading..
If you like the download/encode/upload and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Please seed atleast 1:1 so other people could download as well..

Thank you"

,muLineZu,2011-04-11T00:09Z,"Video is very good 9/10, but unfortunately sound is similar to a cam mike - I can hardly understand how this could be ripped from a blu-ray: 5/10
Very unlike what HDScene Release used us with... too bad.
And just one more thing (nothing to do with the ripper or the uploader): I like Martin Lawrence, but sometimes it's good to know when to stop a project.
First part was hilarious, second was watchable, but this one sucks big time. So, if you miss Martin, better re-watch some of his older movies, because I don't think you wanna remember him from this one..."
