,daba_1,2011-03-31T15:53Z,"Born in Chester, Texas, Malik was the only musically-inclined member of his family. He was exposed to the blues at an early age, having spent much of his youth listening to Muddy Waters, Lightnin' Hopkins, Slim Harpo, and Rufus Thomas on the radio. Their songs inspired him to start singing and eventually join the Baptist church choir in his hometown. An all-around accomplished instrumentalist, Malik also played trumpet and drums for his high school jazz band.
Malik is also an excellent drummer and has been known to sing from behind the drum kit. Malik will be the first to tell you that his all-time favorite vocalist is the ""Boss of the Blues"", Big Joe Turner, whom he had the opportunity to assemble and lead a backup band for."
