Just as owning a lot of telephone books won't make anyone you call talk any faster on the phone, listing many trackers in your torrent files won't speed up anyone's data transfers.

For torrents that you plan to upload to The Pirate Bay, you do not need to include any trackers at all, since the system automatically edits the tracker list in each uploaded torrent file to use the trackers of our choice."

From what's been gathered so far, many of these (obviously all public now) seem to be private trackers which had ultimately blown all of my PC related downloads out of the water; Replacing these with the default tracker list allowed me to download Crysis 2 (FLT) from 20-300kbs to a constant 2.7mb (@ cap) - I probably would have seen well over 3mbs given the bandwidth to do so.
