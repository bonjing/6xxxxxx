Here's Taylor Brown's description of this 
2 CD set from his web site at www.usefulmaps.net

"On these CDs I tell the story of the single most significant 
turning point in my life, the one that gave me durable inner peace 
for the first time after 30 years of searching. 

Great care went into crafting a version of this story that includes 
all the parts that seem relevant to the changes I experienced. I tell 
about each step in my journey from stress and suffering into sustained 
peace. I share the origins of the maps I created, as well as my first 
encounters with other peopleâ€™s maps that helped along the way. 

My intent is to clearly communicate as much of my experience as I believe 
will be useful and applicable to your unique journeys. After the story, I 
revisit each of the maps, summarize them, and suggest some ways to apply 
them in your own life. I also tell where to find more information about 
the maps I learned from other people. 

The story is one that many people tell me is truly inspirational. The maps 
I share are ones that brought peace and empowerment to my life and have 
shown significant potential to do the same for others. 

This 2 CD set contains almost two hours (115 min) of audio, recorded at 
Drum Music Studios with sound engineering by Steve Briskman . The first 
80 min or so is narrative and the other 30 min is the recap of the maps. 

This studio quality audio recording has replaced the original 
â€˜Bootstrap Editionâ€™ lo-fi video and was recorded using a minor edit 
of the same script. Itâ€™s a much higher quality product than the DVDs were, 
and I believe the audio format is more suitable for this story as well. It 
also follows the script I wrote more closely than the video did, and has 
better pacing, delivering the same information as the video in 25 minutes 
less time."
