This is the windows xp edition of disney and asus. this is an iso copy of the restore disk. you will still be able to install this on any pc. the copy should not give any activation problems but if it does just crack like regular xp. I uploaded this because i tried to download it but couldnt find it so i went and bought the laptop for my daughter. Really good for little kids. very good built in parental controls.


This is the link for the full description of the netbook and the OS edition.
