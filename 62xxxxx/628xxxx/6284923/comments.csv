,podkayne,2011-04-01T07:37Z,no info or imdb link but its tvteam so its always exactly what it says it is. you usually just have to be psychic. most of the other big uploaders are the same though. they just get the stuff of warez type sites and copy the info from there. or lack of info

After returning to civilian life as a Texas rancher, Captain Lance Deakin fends off attacks from former members of his unit as he struggles to uncover the truth of what he did as a soldier in Iraq. The military performed experiments on Lance and his men to turn them into super-soldiers and brainwashed them to remember their top secret missions as the hyper-violent content of a video game called MINUTEMAN. Lance must uncover the truth in time to save the woman he loves.
