This is a sync of sorts that plays the final five tracks of Tool's 2001 album Lateralus over the final segment of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The real magic begins when "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite Begins." Tool fans should enjoy this.

A low quality example can be found at the link below. The Google video link does not include the track Lateralus however.
