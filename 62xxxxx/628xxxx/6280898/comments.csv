,tcabbab,2011-03-30T06:47Z,"Are you gonna finish seeding this or not? I've been stuck at 97% for hours now.

This is what you do after spamming other torrents with your link? Fuck you."
,tcabbab,2011-03-30T08:31Z,"Also, a bunch of better torrents below--ALL 100% seeded, cause tpb doesn't forbid promoting torrents ;)

,tcabbab,2011-03-30T21:29Z,"For the record, this kind of behavior is why you don't have a green skull.

Try learning something from MJN, bubanee and other great uploaders.

Don't bother replying cause I'm not going back to this page. Hopefully you'll have learned your lesson the next time I see you."
,SoftWarez,2011-03-31T05:49Z,"Fucking troll, people like you should gtfo this site."

,fleischi93,2011-05-16T11:41Z,"@tcabbab At least he uploaded some of the best music, so shut the fuck up and download it, or get the fuck out! We don't need you here."
,scr13,2011-05-22T17:09Z,"Don't know if its just a bad download I got, but theres bits missing out the tracks. At 39 secs in Wet Ft David Guetta it jumps then it does it later on and the song finishes at 3.02 when its 3.15 long. This happens in some of the other songs too"
,scr13,2011-05-22T17:30Z,"aaaa ignore my last comment, just opened uTorrent to find it had only downloaded 93.8% I thought it had finished last night and closed the program"

,Climsq,2012-02-24T12:27Z,"Thanks for upping this
Lol'd at tcabbab comments. Especially ""Hopefully you'll have learned your lesson the next time I see you.""
Kids like this are the scum of piratebay (and the internet), you can tell nobody wants him here. 
5 different comments from the same person complaining about something that's free? You sure act like you're entitled.. Did your mom refuse to pay for your music? 
I can't wait until you have to deal with the real world and you get your teeth knocked out."
,Climsq,2012-02-24T12:28Z,"Not to mention the complaining useles sack of shit hasn't uploaded a single file. Just downloads the music, makes himself look like an ignorant little shit, then stops seeding."
