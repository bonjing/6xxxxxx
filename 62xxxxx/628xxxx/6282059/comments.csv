,Gamerdad,2011-06-04T04:31Z,Sweet! THX!
,elextoo,2011-06-10T05:46Z,"OK FIGURED IT OUT!  If it gives you the Access Denied error to the savedata.dll file (if you change settings, try to convert, stuff like that) then you must change it so that the program ""Runs as Administrator"".  This worked for me in Windows 7.  Right click on the EXE and goto Compatibility tab, then checkmark ""Run as Admin"" and click OK.  Should work for you now! :D"

,Rob191,2011-06-25T16:29Z,"Right click on the EXE and goto Compatibility tab, then checkmark ""Run as Admin"" Do this initially and it works perfectly. reinstall if you forget :) Ty m0rris1992"

,gbrent,2011-08-02T02:05Z,"This installed no problem running Vista. When you open it, (every time)right-click and run as Administrator and works awesome. I like the fact that I can add numerous files at the same time while converting and it's fast. Thanks for the upload!"
