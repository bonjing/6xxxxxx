Storyline:Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is an ordinary teenager who becomes a real-life superhero in New York City, despite having no superpowers. After his first crime-fighting encounter leaves him with permanent nerve damage, he gains an enhanced capacity to endure pain, and surgical implants required to repair multiple skeletal fractures give him resistance to further bone-crushing injuries. His effort to conceal the truth, claiming he had had his clothes thrown off after being mugged, leads to rumors that he is gay. His longtime crush, Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) immediately attempts to become his friend, having always wanted a "gay BFF." Dave hesitantly goes along with it. After intervening in a gang attack, Dave's actions are recorded by a bystander and put on the internet. Calling himself "Kick-Ass," he sets up a MySpace account so he can be contacted for help. After responding to a request from Katie, he goes to deal with a drug dealer, Rasul, who has been harassing her. Rasul and his thugs quickly overpower him, but he is rescued by eleven-year-old vigilante Hit-Girl (ChloÃ« Moretz), who kills his attackers and then leaves with her father, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). They believe he has potential, but warn him to be more careful, and give him a way to contact them if needed.
