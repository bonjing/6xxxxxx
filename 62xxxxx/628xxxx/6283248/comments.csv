Local punk bands no longer here
Dirty dives and piss water beer
Hours of screams
Torrents of sweat
We were here 
So don't you forget
Don't you ever forget
The music is all that ever lives
Forever
And ever
and ever
A void forever filled with all our mettle 
Rimmed with girls
Laced with drugs
Practice Spaces floored with dirty rugs
Life long friends
A bumpy past
So much love that never lasts
Tune it in
Turn it on
We'll live forever within our songs
Triangle play
Volume up
Recorded time forever stuck
So let it out
Let us in
We'll always be here to play again
and again
and again
and again"
