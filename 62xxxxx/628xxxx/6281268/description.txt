Plot summary from IMDB
The history of the first victim of modern artillery and its moving agony, amidst conspiracies and betrayals of the powerful. Life and death of Giovanni De' Medici, a young brave captain in the war of Charles V against the Pope, in the first half of 1500.

** This comment may contain spoilers ***

This film is for audiences with some awareness of renaissance military and art history, being a cross between a documentary (the words, armoury and events are rigorously based on documented history) and a series of achingly beautiful, live renaissance frescoes (photography: Fabio Olmi).

It also hazards that that were it not for the betrayal of the Duke of Ferrara and his giving of four small cannon to the invading German forces of Emperor Charles V, not only might the young Joanni not have died as he did but the successful invasion and the sacking of the Papal state might not have occurred.

Jivkov as Joanni De Medici and the whole cast are excellent. In short, an uncompromising film from an uncompromising director.
