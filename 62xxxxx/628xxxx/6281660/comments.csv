--> The audio is not complete synced (a little bit of lag). Can I change this somehow (in VLC) ??"
,seedmeup,2011-04-13T10:16Z,"@ Tommyboy007
I am not sure which version of VLC you are using, but look for: -
Tools -> Effects and Filters -> Synchronization
If you click on the Synchronization tab it is in there, you can advance or retard the audio from there.

,Cameigons,2011-04-17T15:14Z,"I loved this movie by the way. It didn't meet the extremely high expectations from critics since it was the 50th disney movie, it was supposed to be a special one. But it's very decent. "
,petterz13,2011-05-18T22:01Z,yeah the audio has a bit of a delay... it can be corrected in vlc by pressing j or k while playing... great quality nevertheless
,petterz13,2011-05-19T21:08Z,"actually the audio is OK, my bad... great upload"
