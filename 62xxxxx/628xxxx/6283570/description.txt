-----------------------
Debut album from Swedish band Killer Clan of F.U.N.
Hard rock with a blues heart. Like if Gunsâ€™n'Roses, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Motley 

CrÃ¼e, Accept, The Rolling Stones and the Beastie Boys all got together smoking 

weed for a week, and then just ran their heads together in one giant crash.
New album to be released in summer 2011. More info at http://killerclanoffun.com
