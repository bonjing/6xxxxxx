From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with the son of Oliver Stone, Sean Stone, and actor Alexander Wraith about their new movie project. The storyline revolves around a group of filmmakers who are shooting inside a haunted psychiatric hospital famous for its radical treatment of patients. Additional guests include the senior editor of the Executive Intelligence Review, Jeffrey Steinberg, and regular Friday guest, Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster. 


Today's broadcast extends about 30 minutes into a 4th hour, ending with a "live commercial" by Ted Anderson on behalf of Midas Resources.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
