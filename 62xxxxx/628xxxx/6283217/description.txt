Past Masters 1 is a very helpful compilation that fills in the gaps for those Beatles fans that want all the official studio recordings. Because the Beatles from 1963-1965 (which is the span of this compilation) were putting stuff out in a singles era, some of these "stray" tracks are of exceptional quality and of the utmost importance to the band's history.
Love Me Do (a different version than the one on Please Please Me), From Me To You, She Loves You, I Want To Hold Your Hand, Long Tall Sally, I Feel Fine, Yes It Is, and I'm Down are key Beatles tracks. If you have an essentials-only policy, then the Red Album is sufficient for you. For those that own all the Beatles' regular albums, there's no reason not to have this too, it fills in a lot of gaps. 

This CD was made to help the fans by cleaning up the band's catalogue, and it succeeded in doing so. So be aware that it is not a Greatest Hits of the early years, that there are tracks (for example the unneccessary inclusion of the German numbers) that keep this from getting a 5th star and making this album for Beatles fans (and not casual fans who'd be better served with the Red Album).
