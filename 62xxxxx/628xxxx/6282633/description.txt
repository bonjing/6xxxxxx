Note:
-----------
Once again, All credit for subtitle translation goes to Weapon+
without their work my avi conversion would be pretty useless :)

I would also like to apologise for my earlier synopsese where I wrongly named 
Kurohagi junior as Shingen, who is in fact Mariko's father, not her Fiance, big ooops.
