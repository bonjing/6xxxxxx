,Fuxsylady,2011-06-21T20:20Z,"This is such a great show, the animation is very good, not that over the top, and some of the new charcater designs are great updates (love the AIM uniform) Some people have commented on Logan beign too young and skinny but I find him to be just about right for a younger audience. I fhte Wolverine movie is half as good as this Anime is might a miracle"
