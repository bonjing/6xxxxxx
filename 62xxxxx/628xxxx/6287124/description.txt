    In this final episode of the series, culinary legend       
    Gary Rhodes wants us all to appreciate the virtues of     
    the British tomato. Unlike our Italian or Spanish        
    cousins we view the tomato as a year round product so     
    ignore the British growing season when our own fruit is    
    at its best. To show us why we should change our ways     
    Gary discovers the wealth of varieties out there,        
    learns how easy it is for us to grow our own and          
    demonstrates a three course menu that has great tasting    
    British tomatoes at its core, including an innovative     
    white tomato sorbet.                                     
                                                              
    Then Michelin starred chef Angela Hartnett attempts to     
    find her sea legs when she delves into why crab is so     
    unloved in Britain. Although our coastal waters are      
    teeming with sweet tasting brown and spider crab, the     
    majority of those caught by our fishermen are destined     
    to be shipped abroad where they are highly prized.        
    Angela cooks three fabulous recipes that show why this   
    crustacean deserves its place on British plates.
