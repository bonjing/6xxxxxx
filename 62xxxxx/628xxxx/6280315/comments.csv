,kimiani,2011-03-29T19:38Z,What is Nuked?....What is bad if it is nuked?
,TorrentCRO,2011-03-29T20:35Z,"Can you please explain what ""nuked"" means?
Thnx!"
,Sunseeker908,2011-03-29T20:57Z,"Nuked: At its most basic, nuking refers to rejecting, deleting or simply recommending people don't download that particular file. There are plenty of reasons for this, but in the video side of things, files are often nuked because they're out of sync (that is, the audio isn't sychronized with the video), are badly cropped (sometimes people zoom in on the video source and end up losing a fair bit of visual material), are incorrectly encoded or use bad codecs (these are more technical issues to do with how large video data files are shrunk down for distribution) or even are just poor quality."

[T],VixenofVenus,2011-03-29T22:07Z,"Which in this case ... they used a setting that the ""scene"" doesn't approve of which slightly affected file size BUT not drastically and the audio and video quality are still superb.

There will be a proper, but it will look almost exactly the same, sound almost exactly the same, and the file size will be very very similar, just slightly different.

Half of the nukes the ""scene"" does are like this.  A few years ago, DVDRips were constantly ""nuked"" for out of sync issues, but even now, that rarely happens.  Mostly, the ""scene"" rule-mongers are a lot like grammar-mongers, they can't stand when the slightest thing isn't perfect (according to THEIR rules)."

,gregersamsa,2011-03-30T18:49Z,"It means that due to the leakage in the Japanese nuclear reactors in Fukushima, there's a chance that you might get radiation poisoning if you download this. Usually, it's fine if you have a proper Firewall (not Windows standard, they're not nuke proof).
If you choose to download anyway, you've been warned. Do not sit too close to the screen while watching and you should be fine. If you experience nausea or skin problems, you're probably going to die so, that's too bad."

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

The resolution of a film depends on its Aspect Ratio. Deathly Hallows was shot with the aspect ratio  2:39:1. Movies shot with this aspect ration cannot have a resolution of 1280x720 or 1920x1080. It has to be 1280x536 or 1920x800. Check every torrent u want, but u wont find a single Deathly Hallows print which is exactly 1280x720"
