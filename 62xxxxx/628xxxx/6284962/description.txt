The best way to triangulate the film is to call it Hello Kitty meets David Lynch in outer space. The plot, inasmuch as such a word applies, concerns a potty-mouthed feline innocent named Tamala, who journeys from Cat Earth toward the planet of Orion, where she was born. Knocked off course by an evil mailman, Tamala lands on Planet Q, where dogs are busy repressing cats in a seedy urban district called Hate and where she meets a sympathetic boy cat named Michelangelo. She insists on calling him Moi-Moi, which makes as much sense as anything else here.

Created by t.o.L., a shadowy Tokyo collective of animators, graphic designers, and musicians, most of "Tamala 2010" is drawn in the faux-naive style of early black-and-white anime. The film could be a surreal hiccup from 1962 except that whenever Tamala falls asleep, she dreams in full-color, high-resolution computer animation. The figure that stalks those dreams is a burnished robot dominatrix named Tatla -- a female Terminator who is brainwashing children throughout the universe.
