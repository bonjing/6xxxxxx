,qhdsagjuj,2011-04-01T15:25Z,"I found out this game forces you into updates so delete all of the contents of C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts/Crytek/Crysis 2/bin32/EAcore. After you do this there no longer will be any more forced update. When you start the game it takes a bit longer, but it still loads! Just leave the EAcore folder there empty! "

,nofear24,2011-04-03T20:18Z,crysis 2 is lagging for me. the audio lags and in multiplayer i am having lags when i fire. I am close to server so that shouldnt be an issue. I have a geforce 260m GTX which is OC'd to a 460m GTX and it is not overheating so that aint the problem. seems like it a bug in the game. fps drops to 0 then back up again. audio stutters in menu from the beginning intro it stutters. any advice any updates?
