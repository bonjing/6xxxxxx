,harvengure,2011-04-27T01:55Z,mik3s doesn't know what he's talking about.  I downloaded some of them and the few I could get to work on cupcake work just fine.

Don't let mik3s fool you. This is the kind of guy that doesn't know what shit he's talking about. Obviouslty he've never used cracked(or pirated) apps before. 

Here are the rules:
1. You cannot update the apps. I'm sorry, but the apps are pirated and that's the rule.
2. If it doesn't work, don't write ""It's fake"" and rage. Look for how to get it working
3. If you know how to get it working, then help. Don't just sit there laughing at them.

(I created this account just to disapprove that retard, mik3s. Thanks, bye)"
,f.tremblay94,2011-05-20T22:34Z,"Does it work for Androids without sd card slot, like the Nexus S? If i copy the .apk file in the internal memory, will i be able to install the game or app?
Thanks"
,vick977,2011-05-27T23:18Z,"More than half the games don't work on Moto Atrix, was really hoping that tetris would work at the very least.

Its mostly hit or miss, some app/games do work fine."
,NordEast,2011-05-31T02:18Z,"I'm sure it has already been said earlier, but...

FYI, if you have AT&T service, you MUST root your phone to use these apps. There is no work around. I'm not sure about any other service provider.

If you don't know what rooting is or if you don't know how to use command line, this torrent is not for you."
,codyxwx,2011-06-04T17:48Z,"files not compressed, check kist apps in torrent engine. thanks dsmero"
,jake9091,2011-06-05T13:35Z,If you have an Atrix and cant run apps on it you dont have to root your phone just download SIDELOAD WONDER MACHINE its a free program you will find it on the net I use it. it works and it will not mess your phone up. this applies to all andriod phones with app restrictions on them
,jake9091,2011-06-05T13:42Z,"At&t phones

,KENN8859,2011-06-30T00:50Z,"I must beg to differ:

,tymac9889,2011-07-09T20:03Z,Thanks for the great UPLOAD!!! Good warning but LOL people talking about BRICKing their devices.... if you do not know how to wright software then you have no business hacking or changing it...  I am sure that you or someone you know bricked a device because they used an Unofficial upgrade of some type or software changer(jailbreaks) made by another person/company....A lot of them also state that before using it that is not ment for daily use but for development and should be used at your own risk.... Last time I checked the internet is not full of fact and truth.... and fact and truth only... Also some people like to ignore warnings because they read an artical so they know how to wright sofware and execution code and matrix code now.... Take the red pill and come back to reality or take them all and go away
,danny602,2011-07-11T09:42Z,"works perfectly just copy the file onto the memory card root, meaning do not copy it into a folder but directly onto the memory card, then use any file explorer app from the app store to locate and install. thanks for this torrent"

,isracanman,2011-07-20T22:27Z,"I've downloaded a few of the apps in the torrent, and one of them (I have no idea which one) contained a virus.
My computer's anti-virus was immediately disabled, and I could not open any programs. Took me a day to clean it.
I suggest not downloading this torrent just to be safe.
There are plenty of other, more current, Android app sources
Cheers"

I had to root my phone to sideload apps. You might not have to. That is what Google is for. Research thoroughly.

Anyways, thanks for the torrent."
