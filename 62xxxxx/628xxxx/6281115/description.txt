Plot Summary - B.J. Quinn, a reigning world-champion kickboxer, is jailed after he unintentionally kills a man who was trying to stop him from getting into a drunken brawl with Jacques Denard - an arrogant, manic kickboxer eyeing the world championship. In Quinn's absence, Denard wins the world championship by defeating Chad Hunter - Quinn's ex-rival and top contender for the title. Barred from all professional fights, Quinn agrees to face Denard in the ring in an unofficial but highly publicized challenge fight. Hunter helps Quinn train for his fight against Denard. Quinn and Denard then clash in the ring in a tough, bloody fight - to determine who the real champion is.
