[center][b]Plot

After making the perfect plans to spend spring break with Bailey (Debby Ryan), Cody (Cole Sprouse) decides to go off to work as an intern at a prestigious research firm instead in hopes that he will get a scholarship to Yale. When he began to tell Bailey, she became infuriated that he canceled his plans with her and refused to speak to him. Meanwhile, Zack keeps asking Cody for Cody\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s car, which his mom and dad will give Cody when he goes to college. But after Zack (Dylan Sprouse) runs a billion-dollar submarine into Vancouver\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s seawall in an attempt to impress a cute science assistant named Nellie, and Cody does the same trying to stop him, the equipment is lost and Cody is kicked out from the program and fired from his internship, vowing to never again forgive Zack. At the time, London ate some of the fruit given to the dolphins, which consequently allowed her to comprehend whatever animals say and think.

Dr. Olsen (Matthew Glave) approaches the boys and tells them that they would be ideal for the Gemini Project, a massive project studying the effects of twins. Though it takes them much thought, they eventually decide to participate, and land themselves among dozens of other twins. They start out with physical and mental tests, which end in disasters. After eating a special fruit given to them by the researcher, they start to feel each other\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s physical feelings. Later, they become emotionally similar. After overhearing the doctor speak to another twin about a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"merge,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" they decide to break into the research office and find out that the Gemini Project is meant to control minds. They decide to run away, but they are seen by the doctor.

Meanwhile, Bailey finds out that Cody only took the intern job because of the chance of a scholarship, and she and the gang go to the research firm to apologize. Because of London\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s communication with the dolphin in Dr. Spaulding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s tank, she knows that Zack and Cody are at the Gemini Project 50 miles away. She tells the gang and Bailey calls Mr. Moseby to the site of the Gemini Project, while they all go to save Zack and Cody. During this time, Zack and Cody attempt to run away from the mind controlled twins when they realize they can now communicate telepathically and try to battle each other, but end up just hurting themselves. They are captured, taken to the lab, where Woody, London, Bailey, and Dr. Spaulding end up finding them. The doctor makes a shield, so that while Zack and Cody go through the third stage, the rest of the gang cannot help them. The doctor eventually reveals that he is Dr. Spaulding\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s evil twin and that he has been spying on Zack and Cody since earlier in the movie.

After telling each other off, Zack and Cody begin to become one, but ultimately do not because of what they do best - fight. Their fighting ends up destroying Dr. Olsen\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s project, and he then says he will kill all of them, but is stopped by the police. With Cody\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s quick thinking, he tells Zack to get the special fruit. After Zack gives the fruit to Dr. Spauldng and Dr. Olsen , the two finally understand each other by telepathically finding out that they wanted to be like each other. Zack and Cody now understand that they make a pretty good team.

In the epilogue, Cody and Bailey cheerfully discuss which part of their spring break was their favorite, London brags about saving the day and Zack is driving his car, which Cody let him have. On the dock, Zack he reads a sign that says \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Do not park, shipping equipment exempted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but interprets it as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Do not park, Zack Martin excepted\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Zack parks there and sees his friends and brother on the ship when there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a bang as a shipping crate containing London\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s summer clothes lands on the car, crushing it. While Zack lets out a cry, the movie ends with Mr. Moseby saying \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Spring break is over, now if I could just make it to summer vacation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[b/][center/]
