,ironymon,2012-06-05T19:34Z,"Chances are, non at best. Nobody cares about catching one fly flying around shit pile, they have to  get rid of the shit and the flyes wil scatter. It's just a metaphor, i don't mean any uploads being shit.. it could've been candy pile and ""pirates"" kids with sticky hands, and anti piracy being good parents."
