V - 7
A - 6"
,WMC69,2011-04-02T21:46Z,"Watchable. Decent for cam. Sample looks good, will advise upon  full download.
Decent video 6, Audio 4"
,WMC69,2011-04-02T21:50Z,"grow up braidone, its better just to tell someone to unpack it with winrar, then be a douche like you.
Also sometimes I shy away from rar b/c sometimes they tend to be fake. Its fairly decent for a cam and the movie was just released yesterday.  Thanks for the effort Heist."
[V],froggie100,2011-04-02T22:21Z,"listen noobs this is real!!

it is rarred ~(use winrar to unrar )~

thnxs hiest bro for upload i hear ts version is out !"
,richardpa,2011-04-02T23:52Z,"Decent CAM copy and a steady download...
A/6
V/7
Fairly Good CAM job, the picture has a few focus issues and is pretty dark, the audio is pretty low and echoic and tinny. Still a decent effort for a first CAM copy...  and certainly watchable...
Many Thanx to LKRG for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,raa714,2011-04-03T00:01Z," Some of the largest torrent providers require their torrents to be in this format for quicker dls. ILT for example. It only takes 30 secs to change to reg avi so what is the big deal, if you don't know how to do this you can't dl from most torrent providers anyway and if you don't have the 30 sec to change it or dl changer which is free anywhere you shouldn't be able to watch the film anyway."
,fuckintorrents,2011-04-03T00:28Z,********hello****** if a file has many peices it's just an .rar file. go to piratebay search and type in winrar and download winrar pro v3.91 (cracked) install winrar. after install go to movie files and right click on  part01 click on extract here and it will auto extract all the rar files to a single movie file which you can play. also after you have the single movie file its ok to delete the rar files to save disk space. your welcome if this is helpful
,XboxMySocks,2011-04-03T00:28Z,"@raa174 that is not really correct, it is required because RAR files cannot be incorrectly transmitted over the internet - that is to say it cannot drop bytes or kilobytes. AVI files and the like, however can, which can sometimes render the file completely useless."

,mixenitup,2011-04-03T00:33Z,And here I thought knowledge of compression utilites was a basic 2nd nature skill.
,chair_tard,2011-04-03T01:06Z,"Hey... thx for the upload... but, I thought I should let you know, in a torrent, splitting rars SERVES NO PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. It is a waste of time for the poster and the downloaders. On USENET, rars and pars are essential. But in a torrent... its a meaningless waste of time. Please tell all your torrent uploaders, rar-ing is for fags and morons."
,chair_tard,2011-04-03T01:16Z,"Here's a nice essay on why you should always unrar files before torrenting:

http://torrentfreak.com/unpack-rar-archives-before-you-release-a-torrent/

To sum it up, you don't need to worry about checksums when you torrent. raring is a waste of time. Please... let everyone know raring is unnecessary and a nuisance. Please stop the rar on torrents!! unrar, then torrent!"
,Johnqpublic912,2011-04-03T01:31Z,wait are the guys bitching about too many files really serious? I mean i've been downloading torrents for what feels like a decade and i find it hard to believe that there are still people who have never heard of compressed files. In any case the movie looks good and if you want better quality and wait a while for dvd quality. Patience is a virtue.
,mojoe41,2011-04-03T01:38Z,PLEASE SEED. TY
,JDFan,2011-04-03T02:36Z,@fuckintorrents ---- while what you say is true that also means you are not seeding after downloading which is oneof the main reasons I do not like the .rar format torrents -- I understand that for some sites it is required due to size\upload restrictions but when someone downloads -unrars and deletes that means they do not stick around to seed for others and if you want to seed you have to keep the extra 800MB of rar files sitting on your HDD which can add up fairly quickly if seeding a lot of files. 
,vivaldi0,2011-04-03T03:13Z,"This torrent makes you have a share ratio of 1:1...it throttles the speed so that you can only download at your upload speed, which is totally fucked.  Would be nice to watch some day but with this BS fuck it!"
,vivaldi0,2011-04-03T03:15Z,Speed is throttled based on ratio on this one!  Sucks!
,kampy0jay,2011-04-03T03:41Z,"Very Very watchable, great cam. Amazing movie. V-7/A-8/M-9 Thank you!"

You cannot play a .rar file unless you extract it.
download izarc freware utility  http://www.izarc.org/  install. after installing  right click on the .rar file  and extract it selecting izarc as your utility. the extracted file which is a wmv can be played using any media player. vlc is a good one to use "
,skarlottt1,2011-04-03T16:07Z,I love the guy who complained there were too many plot holes! er...Its a M O V I E where the guy goes back in time or something. lol plot holes....

,Neo_aeoN,2011-04-04T15:17Z,"str8pirate said ""FUCKIN RAR'S SUCK ASS AND I JUST DON'T TRUST THEM..."" Hate to be negative on anything that other people go through a lot of effort for but I have to agree in that I can't really see ANY benefit in RARing. Far as transferring data, it doesn't make it any faster right? I'll hazard a guess and say Mr Avgpirateer will avoid rar's. HIEST comes with good refs (Master) and will check on that alone, but some people can't afford fakes and virii, so will pass along tp next. Zipping it & thanks for up."

,dirtymoe,2011-04-05T06:51Z,"First of all to JesiJames ... you don't ""play"" a RAR file you fucking moron. It baffles me why people use torrent sites when they don't know the first thing about how torrents even work. Google it assholes !! Read a little ... you DO know how to read don't ya ?  And to SilverSurfer ... OPEN your fucking ports dickhole .. if you would 'forward"" your ports correctly you wouldn't be waiting days to download... GOD DAMN people are fucking stupid"
