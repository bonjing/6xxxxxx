Title: Slacker
Year : 1991
IMDB : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102943/
Subs : None included on the original DVD, sadly.

Story:
Presents a day in the life in Austin, Texas among its social outcasts
and misfits, predominantly the twenty-something set, using a series
of linear vignettes. These characters, who in some manner just don't
fit into the establishment norms, move seamlessly from one scene to
the next, randomly coming and going into one another's lives.
Highlights include a UFO buff who adamantly insists that the U.S.
has been on the moon since the 1950s, a woman who produces a glass
slide purportedly of Madonna's pap smear, and an old anarchist who
sympathetically shares his philosophy of life with a robber.

Notes:
I decrypted this from a retail DVD with DVD Decrypter, and I encoded
it with Handbrake with an approximate final size of 1,4 GB (two cds)
and a 2 pass encoding. The resolution is the same as on the original
DVD so apart from the compression (which is barely noticeable) it
couldn't have been done much better.

Hopefully you appreciate this rip, I literally went and borrowed this
movie just to rip it since it wasn't available in any decent quality
online. If you like this movie, PLEASE help distribute it when
you're done, either by seeding or sharing it in some other way.

Peace!
