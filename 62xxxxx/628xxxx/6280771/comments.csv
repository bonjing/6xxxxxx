I stand fully and totally behind 20-40 on this and all nut jobs simply GO AWAY. Do not DL simple!
Please remember that 20-40 does NOT create these shows he simply encodes and UPs them. 

On a personal note, 20-40 UP'ed [Creation] at my request because I WANTED to see it. I had no idea that he was 'attacked' for this act of kindness. 
How dare you! Leave 20-40 alone.

@ ALL: To all 'nutters' save your hateful comments for your own little parts of the 'net' where you can re-inforce your world views by shouting at like minded persons.

Finally, I invite ALL those with any kind of religious/faith or similar beliefs to watch the most excellent series [Bibles Buried Secrets] a BBC production.

And if you really feed the need to foam at the mouth and speak in tongues then I invite you to watch Religulous by Bill Maher.

Here is a link to an aXXo encode http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6261617/Religulous.Bill.Maher.2008.DVDRip.XviD.avi

Have fun :-)

,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-29T22:13Z,I'd like to see Warriors.  The stats dovetail nicely with my own recent research on the subject.  20-40 can probably guess as to the reason why I decided to research it.
,triggaman14,2011-03-29T22:42Z,hey man do you think you could do Public Enemies?
,jmac85,2011-03-30T04:32Z,"Thank you, 20-40. This is very well written. I am sorry to have badgered you about upping the last part of this, but I knew it was a good series. The lunatics/idiots/morons/halfwits/etc. do not deserve to win.

If you feel like reviewing a show's content, go to IMDB or some other site. Your only option is to hit the + because the quality is always top-notch.

On a side note, I never heard of Warriors, but I also wasn't following you then. I'll have to grab a copy."
,vorlon44,2011-03-30T05:16Z,"Thanks.  This is a really excellent series, and I really appreciate you making it available."

,aunlead,2011-03-31T08:30Z,"@2040 - i was trying to look-up ""warriors"" without much success!
are you referring to this? -

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-31T09:26Z,"@aunlead: Yep. Read from the link posted here by muk0690 too, in the text is valuable information, and dozen links regarding Warriors."
,killword,2011-03-31T09:31Z,"Aw, I hadn't realized that the 4th episode was the final one.  Thanks for the high-quality encode of this, I can think of a few people I'd like to show this to.

I'd also be interested in Warriors if you still have it.

Thanks!"

,WoundedWolfgirl,2012-03-27T03:47Z,"Well said, twentyforty, and thanks for the upload!"
,Bendico,2012-04-08T22:43Z,"You guys do realise this is a work of fiction, right? Keep that in mind before your childlike fantasies convince you otherwise.

This is the real problem with the Western world today. People believe everything they hear and see on the telly. It is even worse when people start believing that what they see in a feature film or a biased English drama miniseries is true.

I have actually been a soldier in the IDF, and I have been on duty in Hebron and Ramallah as an active combat soldier, and I can tell you that 90-95% of this production is pure fiction. It borrows elements from real occurrences, but twists them and makes them more interesting. This is to be expected from a ""drama"" miniseries, but to someone who is very knowledgeable about what events they are referring to this is a bit of a joke.

For example when the Israeli soldiers remove Claire from the settlers' home in Hebron. This would never happen, and even if it did they would ask her what is going on. They would not just take her with them. TIPH are the only organization that is freely allowed in Hebron without military authorization (more or less). Claire would never have gotten into Hebron without being detected (there are UAVs flying everywhere and checkpoints to prevent this). I could go on, but the list is too vast. 

I find it interesting that their props are wrong, too. You see the soldiers wearing the wrong flak vests, helmets and weapons (Galil instead of M16/M4).

It is to be expected from a fictional miniseries, but some people actually believe it to be real or true. That frightens me. What has the world come to? 



Lastly, I would like to thank twentyforty for uploading this.
