Koihime musou English version

Japanese adult visual novel and strategy game based on the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

The game is set in ancient China during and after the fall of the Han dynasty with some major difference, most notably; Most of the male characters in the novel have become female and The Three kingdoms that were formed after the Han Dynasty, have already been established earlier. Despite each kingdom ruled by an independent monarchy, the three kingdoms are still loyal to the Han empire. However, the empire is on the verge of collapse as civil unrest, banditry and infighting bring turmoil to the nation.

As the empire finally collapse and warlords wage war with each other, amidst the turmoil several major factions are formed, ready to rule and unite the fractured nation. These major factions (5 in Koihime MusÅ, 7 in the sequel) are the Shoku faction (Chinese: èœ€, ShÇ”) led by Kazuto HongÅ in Koihime MusÅ and in the sequel, Queen RyÅ«bi of the Kingdom of Shu, the Gi faction (Chinese: é­, WÃ¨i) led by Queen SÅsÅ of the Kingdom of Wei, the Go faction (Chinese: å³, WÃº) led by Princess Sonken of the Kingdom of Wu and in the sequel, her older sister Queen Sonsaku, the TÅtaku faction (Chinese: è‘£å“, Dong Zhuo) led by Governess TÅtaku, Governor of Dong province, the En/Yuan faction led by Lady EnshÅ, Lord of Yuan province, and in the sequel the KÅkintÅ/Yellow Turban Rebels led by the Zhang sisters, ChÅkaku, ChÅhÅ and ChÅryÅ and the Nanban/Southern Barbarians led by MÅkaku. (The anime is set before the Han empire fell and before the power struggle between the warlords began.)
