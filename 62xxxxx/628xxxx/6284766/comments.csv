,Kaorimoch,2011-04-01T16:08Z,"If you get the 'necemem.sni' can't be found error, its because the lcsebody.exe hasn't been cracked.

I downloaded the crack from a hongfire.com thread, it was a file called koihime.exe that I renamed and then it worked."
,zalakai,2011-04-02T12:00Z,Searched through hongfire and couldn't find a crack. Anyone care to share a link?
