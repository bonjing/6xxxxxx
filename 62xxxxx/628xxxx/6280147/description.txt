Synopsis:

The title character is a boy born to an impoverished family in the Andean foothills of Argentina. His mother dies while giving birth and his father goes off to work in distant cane fields leaving Veronico in the care of a wizened grandmother. This is an austere film that is nearly as bleak in its outlook as is the terrain in which it is filmed. What makes the film appealing is the arrival of a schoolteacher who takes the eager but unschooled Veronico under his wing. While life goes on in the remote village, coups occur in Buenos Aires with repercussions that occasionally impact the town culminating with the ill-advised war against Great Britain over the Falkland Islands. A powerful sense of place created through magnificent photography and a haunting score produce an indelible impression. This is a rather obscure film well worth seeking out.
