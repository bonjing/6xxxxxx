This album stands as one of the greatest synth-pop albums ever recorded. Many of Alphaville's biggest and best songs are here - "A Victory of Love", "Big In Japan", "Sounds Like A Melody", "The Jet Set" and (of course) the title track. The rest of the album is excellent as well, especially "Summer In Berlin" and "Fallen Angel". Synth-pop at it's absolute best.
