Four young children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are evacuated to the country house of an old Professor. Whilst playing 'hide and seek' Lucy enters a wardrobe and discovers the magical world of Narnia, where an evil witch has pronounced herself Queen and rules over the fawns, beavers and mystical creatures of the kingdom. She has cast a spell over the land so that it is always winter but never Christmas. Only Aslan the Lion can help them restore the seasons to Nania.

Ok, this is the BRITISH VOICE CAST so includes the talents of Arthur Lowe, Sheila Hancock, June Whitfield and Leslie Phillips (though, strangely the end credits still reference the American version).

Enjoy this piece of nostalgia! By today's standards the animation is definitely below-par but it delighted me as a child and I was glad to see it again, all these years later.


PLEASE - IF YOU TAKE TRY TO SEED TO 1.5:1 AT LEAST!
