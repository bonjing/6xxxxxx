beautiful, lyrical documentary which deals with the graphic subject matter of suicide in japanese culture at a time of economic gloom in a very unsensational - some might say - poetic manner.

though it is documentary, this film has the feel of ozu about it - perfectly fitting the melancholy nature of the material.

is it possible that a local suicide spot - a forest littered with bodies as though they had rained down - be beautiful? perhaps not, but this film alludes to something like the possibility.

using individual stories to shed light on a greater social problem, this film quietly and without yelling its agendas - tells the story of suicide in modern japan.

and next to the sensationalist ego driven style of documentary currently popular, it feels like a breath of fresh air.
