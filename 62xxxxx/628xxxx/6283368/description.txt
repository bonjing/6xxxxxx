Here it is! The worst song in the planet we call Earth! This song has become a YouTube sensation for its corny lyrics, bad voice and in general a bad singer. This is part of Rebecca Black's (hopefully soon to be canned) music career. She will later release a song called "LOL!". Don't say I didn't warn you!
