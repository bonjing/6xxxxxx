,tryme4good,2011-09-24T21:35Z,"Hello, Black300m hope you are going? Like you said about giving help on how use the programs, I would be very glad to receive some directions on how to get them working. There is no added instruction even on how to install anyone of them. I tried installing one but could not understand how to use it. Would they be needing any other program to get them fully installed to be functional? Please help! Thank You."
