Here is the complete cover of Brian Wilsons SMiLE covered by Polly Tones.

Format: Stereo, mp3, 192 kbps.

Brother Inc. claimed copyright and Polly Tones version of SMiLE was taken away from Youtube in March 2011.
This sudden claim probably has something to do with a planned release of the original SMiLE later on this year:

Anyway, here it is for those of you who miss it on Youtube!
