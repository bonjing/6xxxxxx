,stingy.scrooge,2011-04-02T08:17Z,"Yeh! Ticten is gone and Stylishsalh has taken its place. I was searching for ""ticten"" and it said ""no search results""..so for a while I thought you were gone.

But ticten or stylish,your popularity is growing by the minute....When you started you had a few fans(like myself) but now...you got 100s.

You are carrying on the legacy of the Late Sir Axxo. Keep up the good work!!"
