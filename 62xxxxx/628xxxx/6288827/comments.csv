Thanks for the upload though :)"
,dropithard,2011-04-07T03:10Z,@phoenix What are you talking about? This torrent has only 3 songs each a little over 3 minutes. The file size obviously isn't going to be large.

You misunderstood his comment, he meant that the 20GB of Dubstep you mentioned in the description isn't alot. 

I'd have to agree ;)"
