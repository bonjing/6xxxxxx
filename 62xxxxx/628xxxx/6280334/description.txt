360 Degrees of Power is the only album by female emcee Sister Souljah, released in 1992 on Epic/SME Records. The album was met with heavy criticism, not only for its performancesâ€”most of which were angry spoken-word tirades that Souljah screamed rather than traditional hip-hop rhymesâ€”but also because of its controversial lyrics. The two singles and music videos, "The Hate that Hate Produced" and "The Final Solution: Slavery's Back in Effect," were banned by MTV because of their inflammatory language and imagery.[citation needed] The album made it to #72 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop album chart, selling a mere 27,000 copies. Guest appearances were made by Chuck D ("State of Accommodation: Why Aren't You Angry") and Ice Cube ("Killing Me Softly: Deadly Code of Silence"). One track, "Wild Buck Beer," a fictional commercial for a malt liquor, features an appearance by an anonymous artist under the moniker MC Just Want to Get Paid.

Me? I enjoyed the screaming and \"The Final Solution\" is a must for any Public Enemy fan. But you can download it and decide for yourself. If you don\'t like it, what did it cost you?

Enjoy and please seed!!!
