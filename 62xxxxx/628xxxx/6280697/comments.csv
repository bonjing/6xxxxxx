Berlin 1944th The truth of the conspiracy against the Fuhrer

Claus Schenk Count of Stauffenberg of Hitler
next men no longer believe in a German victory in World War II. When he meets a survivor of the extermination camps opened his eyes also on the human disaster caused by the war. As the war takes him from the bloody invasion of Poland to the Tunisian deserts are growing doubts as to his conviction. And he sees only one way out: Hitler, the world's most feared and hated man must die.

""Assassination of Hitler"" is a realistic and breathtaking depiction of the secret plot against the FÃ¼hrer, the team behind ""The Time Hitler and the Third Reich cases"" Sebastian Koch (""The Lives of Others"") plays Count von Stauffenberg, the man who took on the dangerous mission to bring a bomb in the Wolf Lyan, the FÃ¼hrer's private bunker.

For a few critical hours after the explosion, the conspirators staged a coup to take power in Berlin and finally to end the devastating war. A single misstep could cost them all their lives.
