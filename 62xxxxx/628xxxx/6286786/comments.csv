,hardik_860,2011-04-01T13:31Z,thanks...great quality.............
,Mr_Xpert,2011-04-01T14:01Z,"buddy really nice job! i was shocking to watch your result it was too good, requesting you to rip some good reality shows in a small size like you are doing this.. The apprentice or Americas Got talent. AGT gonna bring another season so i've been waiting for this.. hope some body will rip for it.. thanks again!"
,dkhere,2011-04-01T14:12Z,"Please dude, upload your movies in mkv format if possible...
mp4 format gets stuck when i open the folder..."
,banukaknight,2011-04-01T14:49Z,"folder get stuck? thats quite... unimaginable..
sure your pc is virus free mate?
for playing mp4 i always use ""VLC media player"" where i find no mistake...
if not... try ""The KMPlayer"".. 
for the ones who prefer WMP ..  get a ""Windows Codec Pack"" ... it will do...

if nothing of those helped... quite sure it's of some virus problemoo... "
,micmac33,2011-04-01T15:45Z,"Thanks a lot. My first experience of your work, and I have to say,
considering the small size, it's much better than I've expected. Very nice quality.
I'm gonna check out some of your earlier movies."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-01T16:35Z,"Check them soon, they'll be dead soon. 3hr 30mn remaining to complete 'Gone With The Wind' encoding, pls seed my torrents friends. keep 'em alive, thank you all :)"
,micmac33,2011-04-01T18:05Z,"Hi again, @StyLishSaLH.
I was veryfying the synch of the subs, with Subtitles Workshop,
when I couldn't help notice, that the sound goes out of synch towards the end of the film.
Not much, but enough to be annoying.
Now, that said, I still think it's a very nice quality."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-01T18:44Z,"Oh.....
I didn't noticed it :(
I hav the source encoded twice, sorry everyone, It's a shame, 
I should've noticed it. it wont happen again, I swear, sorry friends. "
,micmac33,2011-04-01T20:51Z,"@StyLishSaLH
It's not a big deal, it's said (if my english is right), to error is human.
Or like I prefer:
""The only one who's not making a mistake, is the one who's doing nothing."""
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-01T23:47Z,That's well said bro :)
,dkhere,2011-04-02T03:05Z,"@banukaknight: I am using VLC and KM Player... But before opening, the explorer gets error... Yeah my system is virus free, i am using NOD...
Also while playing in my tv also it gets error sometimes..."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-02T06:50Z,"I dont have any idea about this error bro, Use ConvertX2DVD to burn DvD and then play it via ur DvD player."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-03T22:55Z,"If you use VLC Media Player, down at the bottom there are a bunch of clickable icons.  Click on the 7th one over from the left (""Show extended settings""), click on the Synchronization tab, advance of audio over video.  Its either -.280 or (+).280 seconds, I don't remember which.  That is pretty close fix for this movie (trial and error!)."
,dkhere,2011-04-04T03:51Z,"I think it's because of some codec error...
Thanks for helping me guys...
And keep up the good work StyLishSaLH... :)"
