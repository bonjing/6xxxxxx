,luvold,2011-03-31T19:07Z,Why is the size so big? 15.2 G.B. is very large for AVI's.
,konoyarro,2011-04-03T02:31Z,@luvold: These are mkvs you dolt. 
,scothuman,2011-04-12T17:40Z,"MKV vs. AVI?  They're containers.  They have Nothing to do with file size anyway.  They might as well be AVIs.

Methinks, and this is just a shot in the hard darkness that is TPB comment threads, that the large aggregate size is due to a whole bunch of episodes encoded at 1280x720 (that's my hope, anyways), with an emphasis on image quality vs. compression ratio.

Actually, it's a pretty standard size for the ""Highres"" category.  I do believe there's a copy of Avatar @ 1080 out there that's near 15 GiB by itself.  You may want to check out the ""standard"" res. version, or upgrade from DSL and last season's Crappentosh first.

I just hit the DL button, so hopefully I'll come back and comment on quality shortly.  I'll seed for a while, too.  ::gasp::"
,btfan13,2011-04-16T03:26Z,You commenters make yourselves sound like you don't know anything about high quality.  A lot of fans of shows WANT large size for quality and not the normal smaller sizes.

The 720p files for 1 hour shows usually have over 1 GB. They're much better to watch."
