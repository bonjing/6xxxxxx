2011 album from the Dutch Metal outfit. The Unforgiving is the band's most diverse album to date, 
a dazzling tour-de-force of state-of-the-art Hard Rock, gleaming Pop melodies, razor-sharp arrangements, 
and powerful, shadow-shrouded atmospheres. The Unforgiving is quite unlike any previous 
Within Temptation album. Every one of its 12 tracks boasts a huge, instantly memorable melody, 
and yet there is enormous diversity and versatility on display here, as the band move skillfully
from the instant thrills of the anthemic "Shot In The Dark", the blissfully metallic "In The Middle Of The Night", 
and the soaring menace of first single "Faster," through to the epic bombast of Iron," the exhilarating 
drama of "Where Is The Edge" and the irresistible disco thump of "Sin?ad."
