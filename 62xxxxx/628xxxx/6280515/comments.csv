,dantheman221,2011-03-30T08:07Z,"endritpc, form my understanding, a reloaded release, is ripped and either packed for smaller size, or its made smaller. for example, the video's are too big, the person who made the reloaded image makes compresses the vids to take up less space and therefore, u have to download less. a dvd clone is just a iso image taken straight from a nfs shift 2 dvd in this case. It is not compressed, and it won't guaranty u that the key will work."

a. run as administrator

if you can get past the login/startup screen, then it's a prolly a graphics settings problem that's causing the crashes. for me it was the AF setting being trilinear. 

if you don't want to be bothered, it's ok. the game is shitty anyways, with the physics and fake sense of speed. totally not a loss on your side man. :)

Well, you do have the Graphics power to make up for it.

I've played games that have much more advances Physics and look far better (on higher settings) and get 4x the FPS that this does. Plus there is always some wait from when you put in a command to when the car responds. 

I have a Core2 Duo 2Ghz, 300MHz/1+1GB ATI Raedon 4600 and 4GB RAM and only get >20FPS on med/low settings. It looks terrible, people in the crowds look like blurry lumps, there's almost no AF effect, its unplayable on my rig.

Click ""cancel"".

@mclovin9091
Sounds like you just copied the file from the .iso file. If you download Virtual Clone drive (or any other disk image loader) you load the .iso file into it as if you had put the actual DVD into a disk drive. Then you can install the game from there. (another alternative would be to download something like ImgBurn and create an install disk from the .iso file) It should be able to tell if you have a 32bit or 64 bit system all on it's own if you do this correctly.

I suggest deleting anything you copied over. 

When you do the install, make sure you click ""cancel"" when it asks you for the CD key. After it is done installing, browse the CD (virtual or physical, whichever route you decide to go) and copy the files from the ""CRACK"" folder into where your game installed. I usually just rename the original files so that if I ever need them they are still there, but you can just copy over them if you want.

@rajarotert
Look at what I said to @mclovin9091

@lomjanski
LOL that's because in NFS Hot Pursuit 2010 you don't need any skill to play.

I then mounted and ran the installer again once complete i then copied the files from the image into the install folder, THEN copied the crack files over and then the game started, got the intro video then it crashes when it starts to load the menu.

Im currently burning the disc and will try that.

I never signed in to an account, it just told me that my old account was not valid and then went to the game.

Not sure why anyone is having problems.

And if you're using a laptop or a mac book, you're out of luck, because you absolutely need a video card to run this game.

This is A KNOWN bug that is fixed in the UPDATE which IS NOT CRACKED YET!

SO ESSENTIALLY THIS GAME IS BROKEN!
Play a real racing game, get dirt 3. I can't understand how EA could release a game in this broken state, such an embarrassment. But hey, I bought battlefield 2142 and I have yet to be able to play it!"

,Dommy99,2011-07-20T10:01Z,"@jim_conte You probably dont meet the system requirements for the game. You listed your CPU, but you said nothing about your GPU (graphics card). This game has pretty high requirements, and since you have an Athlon II im going to assume your GPU is just as old, or built into the motherboard.  The game WILL launch, and can run, even if you do NOT meet the requirements. Often when someone doesnt have the graphics or processing (computer) power, they'll get a game that runs bad. Examples are laggy gameplay, laggy or non-responsive controls, choppy graphics/ missing frames, no sound or sound that goes in and out, etc. 
 As far as how you are playing the game, NO YOU DO NOT HAVE IT PROPERLY INSTALLED. On most games you will not be able to do what you did and get the game to work. What they mean is ater you install the game, you browse the game installer folder (the ISO or disk that you just installed the game from) Then find the folder that says ""crack"" or ""reloaded"" and instead of clicking the exe and launching the game like you did, Copy all of the files from the crack folder and place them in the directory where you installed the game. example c:program files/EA Games/Shift2Unleashed/ Or whereever the game was installed to. It will ask you to replace one or more files. click YES and the cracked files will now be placed in the game folder. Now launch the game from the EXE in the shift2unleashed folder, or on the desktop shortcut. Good luck.. I hope I helped. "
