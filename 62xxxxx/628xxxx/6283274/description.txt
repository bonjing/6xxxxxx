NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........

Right here we go with our version of sucker punch.....
This is a new video source which we were able to get the 720p files for.The source itself
wasn't the best but not crap either  ,have some issues like dull,alot of video noise,cammed
at a angle,colours off etc...
So we fixed what we could by rotating the video and then cropping so we lost no video and then resizing.
On top of that we changed the brightness,contrast,rgb colours and also used a denoiser.
We lost some detail because of the denoiser used,but like we said it had alot of noise and had to be cleaned.
Audio was some sweet sounding line which we filtered and synced to our encode.

Oh also this video contains the full video inc the end credits with all the dance scene,so no a single second
missing at all 

Enjoy folks
