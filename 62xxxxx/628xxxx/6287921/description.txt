Wasn't going to do this but, ended up at a loose end last night...
The video's the same I did for cam, filtered bit, resized not cropped to even out AR changes,
cut a loop out. Wierd colour changes, almost black & white to oversaturated, did what I
thought looked good. Might be too dark for some, check sample.
Noticed couple of bits missing while syncing, few secs in trench scene, maybe couple mins
when girls getting a bollockin in dressing room. Don't affect the story much though.
Sync'd IMAGiNES nice line to video & muxed it.
