Stossel - [I Didn't Know] I'm A Libertarian 03-31-2011

This week I'm uploading this file in FLV format instead of AVI. FLV is how I get it after downloading from YouTube. This way I can start uploading here as soon as I complete downloading, saving the time for conversion, about half an hour. Also, the converted AVI file is over twice as large, taking longer to transfer.

FLV files will play directly on your PC using the VLC Media Player, a free download from www.videolan.org. If you need an AVI file, as I do to play in a DVD/media player through a regular TV, you can probably download the FLV file and convert it to an AVI file faster than you could download the double-size AVI file, especially while I'm the only seed.

I use the iWisoft Free Video Converter. Cyberlink PowerDirector will also work. But I haven't found a way to maintain video quality without making the AVI file twice as big as the FLV. I'm very willing to listen to any suggestions.
