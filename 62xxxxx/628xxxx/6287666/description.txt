Giant-Size Spider-Man Complete Repacked No Ads

Giant-Sized books were paper-covered, square-bound. Common manutacturing defects make these hard to find in Mint/Near Mint grades. Most Giant-Sized books contained an original story, plus a reprinted follow-up story.

Repacked: Changed all names of images contained in CBR archives to be consistent, to make sure all readers will get them all in the correct order. Removed duplicate double pages. Combined split 2-page spreads. All files packed in CBR format. Ads removed.
