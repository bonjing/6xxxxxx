1. Mount the image with Daemon Tools.

2. Install the game.

3. Make a shortcut on your desktop via C:programme

4. Play: * without Daemon Tools running: ignore the cd and eventually compatibility warning sign (tested on XP with SP3)

* with Daemon Tools running: the game strange enough doesn't work on XP with SP3, but only on XP with SP1 (as the standard system requirements are) and furthermore Windows 98 & Me



So, this was some weird case I got here! I hope you can get it work! ;-)
