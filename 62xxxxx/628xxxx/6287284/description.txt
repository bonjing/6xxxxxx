Pitbull ft. Ne-Yo, Afrojack & Nayer - Give Me Everything (Tonight) Lyrics


[Pitbull - Intro]

Me not working hard?
Yea right picture that with a kodak
And better yet, go to times square
Take a picture of me with a kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
And I just want yâ€™all know that
And tonight, letâ€™s enjoy life

Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo

[Ne-Yo / Nayer - Chorus]

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Letâ€™s do it tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight

Letâ€™s do it tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell â€˜em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

[Pitbull - Pre Chorus]

Excuse me
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And I think you should let me cause I look good tonight
And we might not get tomorrow

[Ne-Yo / Nayer - Chorus]

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight
Lets do it tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell â€˜em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Excuse me
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And I think you should let me cause I look good tonight
And we might not get tomorrow
