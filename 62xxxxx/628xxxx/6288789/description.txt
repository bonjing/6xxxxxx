Exploding into the scene with their debut E.P. â€œDarling, This Is Just The Beginningâ€, A Night In Hollywood is a band that is going somewhere fast. With their catchy melodies, technical guitar riffs, and explosive stage performance, this five-piece pop-rock outfit from the Bay Area California is hard to ignore. They are making leaps and bounds towards there ultimate goal: making music they love, and impacting people positively with it. Originating with Zach Oliver (Lead Guitar), and Nick Lohman (Drums), they had trouble finding the perfect line up and went through many members before finally stumbling upon ex-fightmejuliet brothers, Marty (Vocals) and Emilio Guerra (Bass). Ben Laing formerly of (Hope Kills) joined shortly after that when Marty found him and asked him to be a part of the band. Despite the amount of member changes that should have torn them apart, A Night In Hollywood stuck it through and are now ready to take over the world. A Night In Hollywood is THE up and coming rock band that you donâ€™t want to miss, so keep an eye out!
