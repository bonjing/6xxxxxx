Jiro is a loner. Every year he buys his own present and celebrates his birthday alone in the same restaurant. This year a beautiful, but kooky, girl joins in his celebrations and they spend the rest of the evening doing crazy things and having fun. Then, following a cryptic speech, she disappears. A year later the girl turns up again, except this time she is a cyborg from the future... Her function is to protect him and the world around him.
