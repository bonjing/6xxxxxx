RELEASE NOTES

Live and breathe as Ezio, a legendary Master Assassin, in his enduring
struggle against the powerful Templar Order.  He must journey into
Italy's greatest city, Rome, center of power, greed and corruption to
strike at the heart of the enemy.

Defeating the corrupt tyrants entrenched there will require not only
strength, but leadership, as Ezio commands an entire Brotherhood who
will rally to his side.  Only by working together can the Assassins
defeat their mortal enemies.

And for the first time, introducing a never-before-seen multiplayer
