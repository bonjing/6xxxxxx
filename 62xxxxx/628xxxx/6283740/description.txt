This must be taken, rather than being opposing GooseGogs, large gears, against Gog-firing cannons and other innovative opponents to the target varied and challenging levels. Since GooseGogs are round, the player can not defeat his opponent by simply jumping on them, but he has to make angry, until they explode. For this, the player's anger GooseGog transfers by pressing a button on a tail on his opponents. But also watch the players themselves must show that it is not too angry, because it can explode. Also, the player should remember that enemy GooseGogs appear most often in formations and require an individual strategy and good timing. For each defeated opponent, and for rapid progress, there are points that are more relevant for the game.
