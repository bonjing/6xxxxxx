As usual a great torrent containing the actual movie, not a crapload of files with !See me and my awesome local server for torrents"" ""Must read me before..."" and so on..

Why do you spend so much money on useless movie players when you can get VLC for free.

Trust me, VLC player is a gift to each and every movie lover.

If you know how to use it, you will love it, More over you wont be spending on any other players if you knew how to use it.

If you have a lot of money to spend, then consider buying some TPB products and help them,

TPB has some cool stuffs for us, Look at the below link:

,k3rc4,2011-04-03T20:06Z,"if u guys have so much problems with playing this movie on ur dvd players, u could always just convert it to some other file type... google it, i am sure u will find a free converter in 5 mins"
,maddhadder,2011-04-13T18:32Z,you know now a days they sell DVD players the play data so if you have money to spend buy one of these they dont require any special format as long as you can watch the movie on your computer
