This is a rare compilation of bootleg stuff released to the MF fan club. For many years I could never find a decent copy of this online. The only one I ever found sounded like it was recorded with a microphone up to a speaker. So a couple of years ago I decided to digitize my LP that I bought at an import shop as a teenager. Once I did so I realized that it could really use some work. The songs were from 3 shows, but jumbled up randomly. Parts were transferred out of phase. Parts sounded like crap. So I phase corrected the bad parts, took the bits of the separate shows and grouped them together and EQd them as well as possible. I then shared this on DC++.

Since then I sold the album for a fair bit of cash. Then tragedy struck. An unfortunate harddrive crash left me without the lossless files, although I still had a CD burned of it. But again fate was out to destroy Fate. A girlfriend made off with about 700 CDS of mine, including this one. If not for my son having a backup mp3 in his collection the entire thing would have been lost for good.

So that is what I offer you here. Sorry I couldn't post a lossless version. I am working on getting a new copy now and will redo the work if it happens, but for now this is the best I can offer.
