Anyway, error in file name : This is 960x540 like previous torrents too."
[T],Distrance,2011-03-31T07:06Z,"Something broke with the torrent. I am seeding continuously but it claims that I am missing files and I am 99%. With that said, it shows no seeders but don't worry ; You'll get all the files if you wait patiently as I've been seeding and I still do."
