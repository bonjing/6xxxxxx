Storyline:

Joe Clay is a top-notch public relations man. Anything a client wants Joe can arrange for them, whether it be dancing girls or an article in a prominent magazine. 
Part of the job however is drinking and Joe\'s ability to consume alcohol seems boundless. When he meets the very pretty Kirsten Arnasen, she prefers chocolate to 
alcohol but Joe has a solution to that in the form of a Brandy Alexander (made up of brandy and creme de cocoa). They eventually marry but their love is insufficient 
to prevent them from the downward spiral that alcohol brings to them. They try desperately to break the habit but continually relapse until only one of them manages to break free.

*I don\'t take requests because I don\'t have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don\'t play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I\'ll ask everybody to stop with the \"it doesn\'t work\",\"it\'s out of sync\" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
