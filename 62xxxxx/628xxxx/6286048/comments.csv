,gary.mumford,2011-04-01T01:39Z,Anyone got the Server version  PLEASE!!!

,[No]Zen,2011-04-01T02:50Z,Can anyone verify that this works please?
,ahheck01,2011-04-01T03:31Z,I'm downloading now but I'm sure this works.  iMZDL is a very reliable source.  He's on twitter and has a website (just add dot com to the username).  I got the DP1 from him and I'm typing from that right now.
,iiiGerardoiii,2011-04-01T03:33Z,"Thank you iMZDL, perfect as always  :)"
,Tmelon,2011-04-01T03:55Z,Is everyone else getting slow speeds too? We could use some more seeds.
,[No]Zen,2011-04-01T06:12Z,"Is it possible to install this to Parallels or V.Box ?
If so how?

Thanks"
,paulieee,2011-04-01T07:46Z,"Issue:

An error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again. If the problem persists, use Startup Disk to restart your computer from the Mac OS X Install DVD.

And for the record, that downloaded in 6 hours."

Thanks !!"
,Tmelon,2011-04-01T14:00Z,Finished downloading overnight and it's working perfectly.   I'm sure we can rely on you for Developer preview 3 when the time comes. :)
,manang,2011-04-01T15:36Z,"@pauleee
i have the same problem...do you have a solution?"
,melinator95,2011-04-01T16:39Z,"Mind, this is still a developer preview. There will probably be some bugs (like no terminal in the first one).
But I'm sure that this one will be an improvement. The official release is coming up anyway."

Before you upgrade from 11a390 you have to instal a small patch (should get from Software Update) First or the install will fail. Or you have to install onto 10.6.7  (10j869)"
,henhouse0,2011-04-02T09:58Z,"Does anyone know if we install this and buy Lion when it releases officially if we can upgrade? I'd assume we can, but does this break a lot of games like WoW for example, etc?"
,vk3ts480,2011-04-03T02:02Z,"Installed like a charm on my 2009 iMac.
Only issue is Parallels 6 wont run. (cant load Parallels Driver.)
Have to use vmware :( because I own Parallels. Had to ""borrow"" vmware.
It seems virtulization is not working vmware is doing in in software. 

Unfortunatly still need XP for one peice of hardware that there is no mac software for.

I will continue to use as a desktop as vmware is working ok it is slow not using native virtulization but i only run one app so I can live with it.

Will deffinatly by Lion the first week it is out.

Any ideas on turning hardware virtulization on ?"

,csmael,2011-04-08T03:54Z,cant wait to try this over my SL 10.6.7 by the way Netkas has already made a binary source code if you want to use it as a bootloader (Lion version 10.7 ) just visit his site for more info www.netka.org
,csmael,2011-04-08T03:59Z,Sory for the wrong typo it should be www.netkas.org  by the way how come my dl speed is only 50kb when there is 200+ seeders out there my speed connection is 1mbps any suggestion would be highly appreciated..thnx

,packy17,2011-04-11T07:41Z,"I'm having a problem installing this. See, my late 08 MBP decided it no longer wants to burn or read DVDs. So burning this image in DU is not an option. So for DP1 I restored the image to a USB drive and installed from there... worked like a charm. However, now that I'm running DP1, I'm getting an error about ""not enough memory on /dev/de1vs or something like that when I try to re-image my USB with this one. Anyone have a solution? Are there other programs out there that will image USB sticks?"
,iwannapee,2011-04-12T21:21Z,packy17: Just mount the DMG and run the installer from there. You don't need to burn it to a dvd or write ut to a flashdrive. Just start the installer from the mounted dmg and the installer will copy the required files to the harddrive and continue the installation

,zara999,2011-04-16T04:51Z,"I installed this on my Macbook Air. 
1. Spotlight doesn't work when searching for applications UNLESS the app has been opened once. Unopened apps can't be found. 

2. I installed this on an external hard drive with FileVault turned on, and had the system booted from the external drive. It first worked fine, but then 3 days later my external hard drive got LOCKED, every time I plug the USB external ATA drive in, it asks for my password, I clicked on HINT, it shows the hint I set for my FileVault Password, I entered the password, keeps saying wrong password, I'm sure there's been no change on my password and it's the same one I've been using on a lot of other things, it worked for 2 days then stopped taking the password. 

3. This locked hard-drive problem only happens when I plugged this locked hard-drive into the Macbook Air which I had the Lion O.S installed as well;  when I plugged the locked hard drive into a Macbook running 10.6, no password is asked however, NO hard drive is detected either. 

4. I plugged the locked hard drive into a windows machine, does not detect it at first; then I downloaded a partition software, it sees the drive but can't partition/format it.

My guess is that this Lion O.S might lock the hard drive when FileVault is turned on , and change the password automatically to something else. To this date I still can't get my hard drive unlocked. Very frustrating. Wondering if this has happened to anyone else when FileVault is turned on while installing on an external drive? Any help or advice is appreciated. "
,eccehommo1970,2011-04-17T16:05Z,preview 3 is now available as a 1gig update through software update. spotlight was sucking around 60% of my cpu so had to disable it completely. otherwise its much faster.
,CalsCoding,2011-04-19T07:10Z,"cliftonnn, no - it's not legit. it could very well brick your Mac's hard drive. DO NOT install - I would only recommend this for absolute apple gurus ONLY!!

Other than that, it's great! Have an awesome day."
,Dannieloco,2011-04-21T01:17Z,"Made a 2nd partition on my main HD for 12gb's then double clicked this ""Mac OS X 10.7 Lion DP 2.dmg"". After the 3rd screen, the option to ""install to a different HD"" popped up and I chose my new 12gb partition. Took 20 mins to complete. 

Just hold down alt/option and select the OSX Lion.. works like a charm

,bigboss23,2011-05-04T07:07Z,can someone tell me how the fuck to install this im new to this whole torrent thing!! :D help would be greatly appriciated
,Dannieloco,2011-05-04T16:41Z,"bigboss23: first off stfu with the cursing.
take the image and burn it to a DVD-R. Then, once the DVD-R is made, leave the CD in your cd-rom and reboot your mac. hold down the OPTION button as your computer is turning back on and select the CD icon.. then install OSX 10.7

This torrent is fully functional and installed with no problems. The apps worked fine and the system is stable. Only reason I downgraded is because VMWARE isnt compatible yet with this OSX and I really need windows on my mac for certain software. 

Highly recommended! if you're a p*ssy, just wait for the RTM.. =]"

have you tried using a linux distro to reformat the hard drive?
with gparted, the linux partitioner, it allows you to unlock hardrives and format them. every single fault with partitions i know has been fixed with this. "
