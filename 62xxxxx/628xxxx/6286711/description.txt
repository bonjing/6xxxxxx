Mystics, aliens and ghosts come together in a piping hot adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat! Guide a young woman who's arrived at a tropical island to visit a friend. Her acquaintance is nowhere to be seen, but there are plenty of ghosts on hand. As you explore lost temples, devastated coastlines and abandoned villages, you'll uncover a 60-year-old mystery surrounding a shaman and his efforts to save his island. With your wits as your only weapon, you must collect cleverly hidden objects, solve cunning puzzles and help the shaman stop fate in its tracks before a deadly tidal wave rises up from the sea and wipes out his people!
