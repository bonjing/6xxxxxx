Description: The best film made about Kama Sutra, the ancient Indian Art of Love. It presents the actual positions from the Vatsayana\\\'s book, done in a classy way, with good looking actors, in pleasant surroundings, attractively lit and irresistibly erotic. It begins with a 5 minute introduction to the philosophy of Kama Sutra. Later the voice over explains each position in the repertoire and why it is a good one to explore.
This film is not a porn. It is a profound journey through the beauty of lovemaking and the sexual-spiritual union of a man and woman.
