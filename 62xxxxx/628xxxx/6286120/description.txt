I made this bunch for beginning minecrafters. It is easy to follow the instructions that I made and I included images, you don't even have to install the game, just run it!

Minecraft is a game about placing blocks to build anything you can imagine. At night monsters come out, make sure to build a shelter before that happens. It also has music by C418! So far 5996412 people have registered and 1749708 people bought the game.

If you like the game, buy it!


(ps, I do not support any problems that come with this rar.)
