The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues is the first EP by American heavy metal band Between the Buried and Me. It is expected to be released on April 12, 2011 through Metal Blade Records. The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues is the first release in a two-part conceptual album suite and is the first release by the band since their signing to Metal Blade.
Between the Buried and Me made the conscious decision to preclude a studio album with an extended play for several reasons. In addition to being part of a concept album series, frontman Tommy Giles Rogers also listed wanting to keep the group's name "out there" and seeking new material to perform at concerts.
