I am forced to be a knowledge thief! Hence my user name. 
Good thing I am not a Muslim (I am a spiritual atheist, if that oxymoron makes sense to you). Otherwise, I would have lost my hands and would*ve been forced to steal, in order to survive.
I wouldn*t have to steal, if I could feed my wondering mind, with educational programs like these, instead of the junk T.V. thatâ€™s trying so hard to sell me tampons, cars, and the rest of the worthless junk I don*t need, like, or want.
Please seed if you want to propagate knowledge and understanding, instead of ignorance and war. Hopefully, the guillotine will have a comeback and current politicians will feel it*s sharp blade.

Therefore, if you want to make a difference, seed as much as you are able.
I only seed to 150% due to limitations of my ISP (100 GB/Month). If you can do better, please do it.
