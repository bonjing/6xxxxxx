 Witch country are you from?"
[T],burning.love,2011-03-29T21:15Z,"1969-1972, and of course everything else...I'm from Croatia, where are you from ?"
[V],jeroep,2011-03-29T21:22Z,"i'm from holland, my favorite period is the concert years and a lot of the movies i like also. it's the whole package. in holland they have a lot of concerts of the tcb band, it's great to listen to james etc. they still rock!"
[T],burning.love,2011-03-29T21:46Z,"I must admit that I prefer early concert years, up to 1972., his voice was not exactly in his prime later.
But again, I love each and every Elvis performance...Would you know if there is ""Always on my mind"", concert version, and where ?"
