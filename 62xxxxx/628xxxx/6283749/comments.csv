,noneofyourbusiness1981,2011-03-31T02:56Z,You Should never Upload something which is already up here!!! GET RID OF THIS TORRENT
,pilot312,2011-03-31T02:59Z,Well two is better than one!
,aarque,2011-03-31T03:37Z,"Two is worse than one. New leechers do not know which to choose, instead of re-enforcing the cloud of the original, they split up, complete their downloads and disconnect. Since so many leechers do not fulfill their responsibility to seed, the chances of finding active torrents is made much lower when there are duplicates. At least when there is one torrent it can remain healthy through the overlapping comings and goings of the leech/seeders.

Duplicate software kills torrents, demonstrates disrespect for the original seeder and unnecessarily burdens the already staggering tracker system."
,noneofyourbusiness1981,2011-03-31T08:32Z,"Always worse as now it means there will be two weak torrents as Opposed to 1 strong one!

DELETE!!!"
,Jimstalk,2011-03-31T15:09Z,"Yeah i agree.

delete it asap"
,chuckmamuck,2011-03-31T19:16Z,"the original upload is active and healthy so this needs deleting.
duplicate uploads aint good at all and are totally unnecessary.
before creating a torrent you should always use the search bar to check if the material has already been uploaded."

,VaticanCity,2011-04-01T16:10Z,"I have no problem with you reuping the same torrent personally IDK, but now since your killing my torrent make sure to upload the SP1 update.which is now out."
,VaticanCity,2011-04-01T16:15Z,Scratch that my bad wrong torrent.
,aarque,2011-04-01T16:59Z,"There are statistically achieved understandings of how torrents survive and die. Opinions, favorites and personal preferences have no effect on those statistics; however, comments by TPB members demonstrate that users have a direct and uncaring  effect on the survival of the torrents. (presumably IDK= I dont kare)

You will learn, young warrior, that by the time your precious chosen torrent has ""gone silly"" the other died and blew away some time previous.

The answer is simple: search before uploading and if you really care, share the trackers of the software you were GOING to upload."

  good advice.
listen to the wise man above(aarque not god)
the rules are unofficial but are worth sticking to.

flight sim products dont receive the activity to support duplicate uploads, alot of the time its difficult keeping a torrent healthy after the initial surge of activity dies off after a week or so."
