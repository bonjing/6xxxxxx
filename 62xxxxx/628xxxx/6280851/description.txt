The Golden Compass is an action-adventure game developed by Shiny Entertainment and published by Sega.[1] The game is based on the novel-adapted movie of the same name. It was released in December, before the movie, for all major consoles. It was declared the last game by Shiny Entertainment before they merged with The Collective.

Story

Based on the book (under both the names The Northern Lights and in some countries, The Golden Compass) and movie, players assume the role of Lyra Belacqua and Iorek Byrnison in Lyra's attempt to get the golden compass (alethiometer) to her uncle, Lord Asriel which she presumes is what the master of Jordan college wanted her to do, and to save her friend, Roger from the General Oblation Board.

In some sections, the game actually follows the book more closely than the film. The sequences in Bolvangar and Svalbard are switched in the film but remain unchanged in the game. Also, some of the ending (unseen in the film) is shown in the game. That makes the game the only place, thus far, to view these deleted scenes.
