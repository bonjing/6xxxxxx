[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-04T15:45Z,you must have selected both audio tracks?
,Prospector99,2011-04-05T00:35Z,"I am not sure,
For some reason when I select the english there is no audio, then when I select the Russian there are both... I tried removing the russian track with MKVmerge, but that left an empty english audio track, I am sure its something I am doing wrong, as everyone of your downloads has been 101% for me...
Thanks for all your great work...."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-05T13:39Z,I'll get back to you tomoro.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-06T10:21Z,Tested. Nothing wrong with the file. Try installing CCCP and select audio#2. It is only English.
