              The story of King George III of England's       
               slide into insanity, and the political and      
               royal back stabbing which results from his      
               incapacitation. Despite being very amusing     
                 at times, this is a sad tale of medical         
                 practices in the later 1700s as well as an      
                insight into life inside and around the         
                royaly of the time. -
