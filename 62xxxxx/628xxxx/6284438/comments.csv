You use your computer to download this. Then burn it or add it to a external HDD and play it on your hacked wii.

All your questions can be answerd here http://www.apiratesbook.com

There is a forum and a fat list of guides on downloading torrents and hacking your wii.

Gook Luck!

Cheers"

,twinghost,2011-04-09T02:41Z,"thanks alot dude, works fine on my pal wii, downside is this game is really sucky, its like they took smachdown vs raw and added new wrestlers and edited all the superstars of today and gave them all stupidly big bodies with small heads, moves are over the top and even the rocks main move is the chokeslam, sometimes you bounce from the chokeslam to like 20feet in the air xD but thanks none the less dude"
