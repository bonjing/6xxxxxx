Nervous | Madeleine Mei | Sister Dee  + Pics
March 28, 2011 



The things that Madeleine Mei has been through today have left her terrified of whatever Sister Dee comes up with next. Her eyes give it all away. Whenever SD walks around the room they follow her, wide, looking for any sign of things to come. Whenever SD leaves they fix on the entrance and wait for her to return. When she comes back with whatever implement of torment she has picked, Madeleine hardly glances at the tools. She stares as Sister Dee and searches for any hint of mercy in her heart.
