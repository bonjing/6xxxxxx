I have installed 
what is it good for?
can I use it with the new tmpg video mastering 5
if so does anyone know how?"
,kukki2,2011-04-14T17:03Z,"You can use it with video encoding software that uses external filters like ffdshow, coreavc, haali media splitter. Im not sure about tmpgenc if it uses internal or external ones, cause I have always found better solution for my needs (that usually are even free) when it comes to videoencoding.

Altho, by testing, coreavc is lighter than ffdshow but it's only worthy on some older machines. example i5/i7 are that fast, you wouldnt see a difference between ffdshow and coreavc."
