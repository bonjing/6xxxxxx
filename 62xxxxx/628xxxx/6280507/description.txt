- "We Have Intervened to Stop A Massacre": Obama Defends the U.S.-Led Military Action in Libya

In his first major television address since ordering the bombing of Libya earlier this month, President Obama defended his decision citing Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi's repeated human rights violations; an international consensus for interventions; the revolutions sweeping the Middle East and North Africa; and the threat of a massacre in the Libyan-rebel stronghold in Benghazi.


- A Debate on U.S. Military Intervention in Libya: Juan Cole v. Vijay Prashad

As President Obama defends the U.S.-led military attacks on Libya we host a debate. University of Michigan Professor Juan Cole has just published an article titled, "An Open Letter to the Left on Libya." Cole defends the use of military foruce to prevent a massacre in Benghazi and to aid the Libyan rebel movement in their liberation struggle. In opposition to U.S. intervention in Libya, University of Trinity Professor Vijay Prashad warns the United States has involved itself in a decades-long internal Libyan struggle while it ignores violent crackdowns by U.S.-backed governments in Bahrain, Yemen and other countries in the region.


- Syria Detains Egyptian-American Accused of Spying, Refuses to Release Details of Charges Against Mohamed Radwan

The death toll in Syria since protests erupted 10 days ago has passed 60, and according to some estimates, more than 280 people have been arrested, including an Egyptian-American engineer named Mohamed Radwan. On Friday, Syrian state television aired what it called a "confession" by Radwan, in which he says he visited Israel in secret and took money in exchange for providing photographs and video about Syria. Radwan's family says the statement is false and must have resulted from coercion. We play an excerpt from an interview in February with Radwan while he participated in protests in Egypt, and we speak to his brother Tarek Radwan in Washington, D.C.


- "Shocked and Appalled": Sister of Death Row Prisoner Troy Davis Responds to Supreme Court Ruling

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear the appeal of well-known Georgia death row prisoner Troy Anthony Davis, likely setting the stage for Georgia to schedule his execution. Davis was convicted in 1989 of killing of off-duty white police officer, Mark MacPhail. Since then, seven of the nine non-police witnesses who fingered Davis have recanted their testimony. No physical evidence ties Davis to the crime scene. With his legal appeals exhausted, Davis' fate rests largely in the hands of Georgia's Board of Pardons and Parole, which could commute his death sentence and spare his life. We speak with Troy Davis's sister, Martina Correia. "No one wants to look at the actual innocence or the witness recantation as a strong and viable part of this case," Correia says. "I think there needs to be a global mobilization around Troy's case."
