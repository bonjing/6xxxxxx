Paul Temple is a fictional character created by British author Francis Durbridge (1912-1998). Some of the novels in which he appears were written in collaboration with John Thewes, Douglas Rutherford, or Charles Hatten â€“ and those with Rutherford were even published under the name "Paul Temple", thus making the fictional writer a "real" one.

Temple is an amateur private detective and author of crime fiction. Together with his wife Steve, he solves the featured "whodunnit" crimes with subtle, humorous dialogue and rare "action". Always the gentleman, his use of the phrase "by Timothy" was the nearest he ever got to swearing. The introductory and closing music for the majority of the long-running BBC radio series was Coronation Scot (a musical depiction of a train journey) written by Vivian Ellis.

Paul Temple was "born" as a radio detective. In Britain, several Paul Temple radio series were broadcast from the 1930s to the 1960s. While several actors and actresses portrayed the Temples over the years, including the Send for Paul Temple Again series which starred Barry Morse and aired in 1945, probably the best known portrayal of the couple was by Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury. Many of the serials starring Coke and Westbury have been repeated since 2003 by digital radio station BBC 7
