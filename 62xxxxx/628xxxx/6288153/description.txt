After accurately documenting Buddy Guy's talent on the great A Man & the Blues, producer Samuel Charters set out to prove that the Chicago legend was also one of the music's best live entertainers. This album's not only packed with fanciful guitar solos and fervent singing, it shows Guy's full range as an artist. His powerful testifying on "Fever" and "Knock On Wood" nail his credentials as a soul singer. "I Had a Dream Last Night" captures the sensitivity and emotional depth of his blues. And the charging "I Got My Eyes On You" nips at Jimi Hendrix's boots as it reveals Guy as a source of sonic inspiration to that Voodoo Chile. --Ted Drozdowski
