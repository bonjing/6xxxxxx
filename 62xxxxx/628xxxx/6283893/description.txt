After releasing nine albums in nine years, it was high time for a â€œBest Ofâ€ CD. Featuring Harry on the 20-stringed Mohan Veena, acoustic slide guitar, lap steel, and banjo, this essential â€œdesert islandâ€ collection contains fifteen tunes (thirteen original songs and two cover tunes) that represent the evolution of a highly unique musical style that fuses Eastern sounds, Western blues and acoustic folk.
