Our hero is stuck in a dream, a world of his own. He sees the world in black and shades of grey, and not another soul is to be found in his dream-world. To escape this prison of his mind, the hero must go through all the levels, facing obstacles and avoiding traps. Interesting arcade platformer with a cold and gloomy atmosphere. Use
double jumps to assess the trajectory of flight and hooks in the walls. Some levels require our hero to solve puzzles to advance.
