,jocamero,2011-08-08T23:07Z,"A .flac file is a lossless file format.  On the Mac you can use XLD (X Lossless Decoder) to convert the file  from .flac to .mp3, .m4a, or your other preferred format."
,jdoeson69,2011-08-09T22:52Z,"You can use Foobar2000 or VLC to play FLAC files. There are also other players you can use. Just google ""FLAC media player"" or something similar.

Remember, Google is your friend."
