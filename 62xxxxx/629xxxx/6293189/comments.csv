Does anyone want to just go nuts and post the PB Cover to Cover HDD directly and be done with it?"
,LesbianCloud69,2011-04-04T23:30Z,"I have the Playboy HD and I'll still DL these. They are great.
In fact, I have the whole collection from '53 to date as magazines. But this is awesome.

1. My magazines can stay in the wallets.
2. I can put these on the ipad as I please (the PBHDD is VERY Restrictive!!)"
,tavery80,2011-04-05T09:17Z,Total size as pdfs is about 80 gigs.  The problem with the HDD itself is that there's no way to really tell which files are needed to ensure proper operation of the Reader software.
