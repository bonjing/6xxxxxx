,Torrential.Reign,2011-05-18T15:56Z,"hey, sample looks ok!;  just turned up the brightness & contrast a touch;  am using the GOM media player & the A / V seems quite decent for a TS bootleg (A=6.5 / V=7.5);  am d/loading in full now..."

This is not a good example of a TS at all. It sounds like the soundtrack was given only a slight tweaking to make it sound better but given the quality, I would say it's just a mildly edited cam. The video was too dark and not blurry but not sharp either. Does no one making cams have access to an HD camera?"
,NaomiJ,2011-06-16T19:58Z,"Not a great example of a TS at all!! 
V = 4
A = 4

Will wait for DVDrip i think - but thanks for the effort!"
