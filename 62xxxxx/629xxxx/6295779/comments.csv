,jimmystol,2011-04-06T17:32Z,@ andykent1 there are 20 episodes in this season.
,apbsommer,2011-04-07T11:46Z,"this show is outstanding. best scifi series since the x-files back in the 90's. it's frustrating that the syfy channel has sold out to preposterous reality shows like ""ghost hunters"" and ""wwe smackdown."" what is left for an intelligent viewer? more bbc ""planet earth"" reruns i guess."
,Saerain,2011-04-12T00:08Z,@andykent1: It's going until S02E20.
