Allied leaders and military planners realized early in preparations for the invasion of NW Europe that the massive forces required to defeat Hitler's armies needed constant re-supply of men, equipment, ammunition, fuel and other materials. These would have to come in by sea but it was known that the Germans would not only defend the few major ports but destroy them before withdrawing.

The drastic answer was to build two artificial harbors. This extraordinary venture involved the most ingenious engineering and staggering amounts of construction. All this was achieved in a short space of time. Under conditions of great secrecy, codenamed MULBERRY, two sites in Scotland were established.

The book describes not just the methods used but the men who made this miracle possible. How these massive structures fared and the contribution they made is told in this fascinating book.
