Plot
Pray For Death.
Two survivors, who appear unwilling to answer questions, are the only links authorities have to a spate of attacks that have hit rural South Africa.
Rex Dobson and Alice Edmonds find themselves stranded alongside the R106, a freeway just outside Johannesburg. Waiting for help, they are abducted by a masked madman who does unthinkable things to them. Both survive, but wish they hadn\'t. As their stories unfold, it is clear that the truth of what happened that fateful day is far worse than anyone could imagine.
