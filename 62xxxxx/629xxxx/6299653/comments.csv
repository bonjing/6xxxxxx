The image doesn`t extract! it doesn`t mount!  the only thing it will allow you to do to it, is burn it . And i`d rather be able to check the content first via mounting it in a VD, or at least be able to extract it to a video ts folder.

,DarkerSkies,2011-04-07T02:58Z,"Extraction Puzzle solved ""Ultra ISO"" will allow the image to be extracted to a ""video ts"" folder. I fucking hate having to track down third party apps to deal with this kind of shit, whats up with just  uploading a standard iso ?

The image for me wouldn`t mount via ""clone virtual drive"" or via ""power iso`s VD"" either. And it wouldn`t  extract to a ""video ts""  via power iso either. 

The Video / Audio are excellent, retail menu edited i.e no special features.  "
