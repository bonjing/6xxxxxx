,syb936,2011-05-04T14:29Z,"Hi

The game works!

Just mount the iso file,go to the ""Fairlight"" folder,click the ""Installer.exe"",wait for complete the installation,and play the game.

Dont start the steam install when mount the iso file!

I hope,my help was useful"

,ofb,2011-05-20T19:49Z,"I had problems too, I installed through fairlight as per your instructions, but very strange..when starting the game, I got an NVIDIA kernal mode driver stopped responding but recovered message, but then the game loaded, I got the intro and menu page, but when I clicked ""Fly"" the game crashed ?? to desktop but I could hear the game audio running (no video) I hit esc key, and game returned to main menu. I have windows 7 64bit, so I tried it on my brother's machine, he has vista 64 bit, but we got the same shit..."

,eurolite,2011-05-31T08:27Z,"How is this here? It isn't out until July...
Was it leaked? Does the crack fully work?"
,q8almutairi,2011-05-31T14:05Z,"The game works!

1- mount the iso file.
2- go to the ""Fairlight"" folder,click the Installer.exe""
3- wait for complete the installation,and play the game.

Dont start the steam install when mount the iso file!"

,6890346,2011-07-24T00:48Z,"I installed the game using Fairlight installer and autocracked, but when i start the Launcher it just crashes right there. I tried twice already. I also installed the newest update cracked. Does anyone know what the problem could be? Thanks"

,fuzdemon,2011-12-05T19:23Z,"I get ""Cliff of Dover Launcher has encountered a problem and needs to close"" when I start the launcher, I see on google many have same problem and the fixes dont work for me or everyone."
,fuzdemon,2011-12-05T23:01Z,"Guys I found the answer to the """"Cliff of Dover Launcher has encountered a problem and needs to close"" problem. I tried it on Win XP SP3 using Omega graphics drivers and got the error, but then tried on Win7 using ATI graphics drivers and it works BUT when I started the launcher I got ""Launcher not responding, do you want to close"" and I clicked ""no"" and waited about 1 seconds (i could see the drive was busy) and the game started and works fine.

Its could be the graphics drivers but my guess is you need Win7."
,soturi_,2011-12-07T20:29Z,I managed to get to training flight once...but it was slow as hell so I decided to lower video settings...after that my videocard crashed (hear voices but no picture) and weirdest thing is that I just bought new PC less than month ago -.-'

,Porre_,2012-05-17T08:41Z,"Install finished, but how do I start the game???"
,sexycow0,2012-05-20T21:51Z,Works fine for me. The original IL-2 games are my favorite flight sims and probably the best ever made. This game is a piece of shit. Go look for IL-2 1946 instead of this. It has 256 flyable aircraft. I was very disappointed with this.
,conewizard,2012-06-06T13:25Z,"is it just me or is this torrent really fucking weird.. i actually got the game to work but it seems the whole game has been downgraded, menu is static, no controls work (using keyboard) and a few other things just seem really broken"
,lucifer1234567890,2012-06-17T08:41Z,also followed syb936's instructions but Launcher doesn't work
