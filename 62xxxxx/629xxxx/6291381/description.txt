Avengers v1 [drknark]

The Avengers are a team of superheroes, appearing in magazines published by Marvel Comics. The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (September 1963), and was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist / co-plotter Jack Kirby.

Labeled "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", the Avengers originally consisted of Ant-Man (Dr. Hank Pym), Wasp (Janet Van Dyne), Thor, Iron Man (Tony Stark), and the Hulk (at a time when the Hulk was more intelligent). The original Captain America was discovered by the team in issue #4, trapped in ice, and he joined the group when they revived him. The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the team, although one theme remains consistent: the Avengers fight "the foes no single superhero can withstand." The team is famous for its battle cry "Avengers Assemble!" The team has featured humans, mutants, robots, gods, aliens, supernatural beings, and even former villains.
