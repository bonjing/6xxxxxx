[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-04-11T05:48Z,"No, unfortunately. I was expecting the dubs to be available over the weekend (AFAIK, the episodes air on Saturdays or Maybe Wednesdays at midnight on [Adult Swim]), but nothing's come up. I check every 3 hours, so you won't miss out ^-^ 

Hopefully within 48 hours! :]"
