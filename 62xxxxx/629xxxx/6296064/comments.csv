,Dubflakes,2011-04-19T16:25Z,"Vaginastep? This pack is filled with what can only be considered dubstep remixes of trance and fluffy pop shit, so if you are into dubstep then I would say look elsewhere. I'm half way through and I've kept 2 songs."
,dub-music,2011-04-20T22:26Z,"@ Dubflakes

Guess you have a really shitty taste in dubstep then.  This pack is fucking awesome."
,Stallion769,2011-04-21T20:47Z,"^ I agree with dub-music

Thanks for upload!"
,lingnanxiong,2011-04-26T09:24Z,"This is awesome, been looking for dubstep music like this! =D"
,Dubflakes,2011-04-27T16:24Z,"It's not a matter of having ""shitty"" taste in dubstep. I have a purist taste in dubstep. I'm more into artists like Skream, Benga, Kode 9, Burial, Scuba, Pinch, Mala, Bar 9, 16 Bit, Kromestar, Kryptic Minds, etc.... I listen to this pack and I hear a bunch of remixes of pop and trancy sounding over-produced mainstream nonsense. It's what I would expect to hear in a Wall Street elevator 10 years from now or at a party of 15 year old boys who can't figure out how to roll their first joint. I'm not saying every track in the pack is shitty, but there is a shift of balance towards the mainstream which is a place I don't really like to travel. I felt it was important to let other people know in case they aren't sure what they are downloading. "
