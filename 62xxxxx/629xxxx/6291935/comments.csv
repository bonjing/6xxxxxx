,mobileuploader,2011-04-03T18:08Z,"i dont know why its displaying an error while clicking the ""download this torrent"" button..(NO INPUT FILE SPECIFIED)

better click the ""MAGNET LINK"" . IT WORKS"
,mobileuploader,2011-04-03T18:16Z,"CLICK ON ""MAGNETIC LINK""

YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE TORRENT BY THAT WAY IF IT IS NOT DOWNLOADING WHEN YOU CLICK""Download This Torrent"" and says(NO INPUT FILE SPECIFIED)"
