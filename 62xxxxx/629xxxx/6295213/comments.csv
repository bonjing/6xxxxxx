,Pyrokinesis9001,2011-04-06T03:24Z,"It's perfect. COuldn't ask for better quality. I just watched it on my xbox. No skipping, no blurs. Just perfect DVD quality. Really good movie too. 10/10 Quality from me(:"
,imkira3,2011-04-07T16:20Z,"Wow thank you! :). you have no clue how much that means, what with it being my first stream and all!"

there you go"
,zaroba,2011-04-08T13:25Z,"thanks for the upload.

with a resolution of only only 320x240, moves 2 and 3 wont be of any use to anything besides a cell phone or psp.  plus, the movies have a black border around them so the actual movie itself is an even lower resolution."
,imkira3,2011-04-10T07:57Z,"well excuse me zaruba, but i just watched this on my tv the other day and its perfect. did u actually look at the movie lol. oh yah and for all you ps3 users out there, all three movies are ps3 cmpatible :P"
,imkira3,2011-04-19T21:30Z,u know all u guys could really help by commenting?????????
,Finn-The-Human,2011-04-21T03:20Z,"Thanks a lot, brollercoaster. I've been looking for an English dub of these so my lady will actually watch them. She hates most things with subtitles."
,imkira3,2011-04-21T21:27Z,thnks man i know the feeling i hate subs so much
,blasting.agent,2011-05-02T22:45Z,"Thanks for your hard work, I just started downloading, and I will seed this like crazy when it's done!"
,blasting.agent,2011-05-10T22:05Z,"So.. If I move the files on my computer, stopping them from seeding, how do I start seeding them again, using Miro?"
,imkira3,2011-05-31T04:54Z,"not sure about using miro, but i think you should try re-opening the torrent and set the location as the same place it is right now, then if possible click check file or something like that."
,TheEmoLab,2011-06-12T19:13Z,If this turrent work i will seed indeed http://www.theemolab.com/
,DBZ_Nappa,2011-08-06T11:17Z,"Man, thanks so much for this. I usually prefer to watch things in the original language with sups, but alot of my friends hate subtitles, and this series must be seen by them.
Beautiful torrent btw. The best torrents are the ultra rare ones. The support from the seeders is awesome, i was pulling max speed on this one. 10/10 for the torrent, thank u so much!"
,e2mac,2011-08-14T08:47Z,thanx man its good seeding always
,nwoper,2011-08-17T20:56Z,good work but poor quality
,sidbisyo,2011-09-04T12:55Z,"I also disagree with zaroba. if you convert  movie 3 : L change the world to a format say, for a celphone, it would look much worst. its original version already has low audio and video quality. "
,metallica101.2,2011-10-11T00:36Z,I thank you very much imkira3!
,Siovhan,2011-10-12T22:49Z,320x240?? why would u do such low quality :(
,Pandora_Precious,2011-10-23T19:19Z,Thank You So Much For Uploading This! :] Well Worth It :]
