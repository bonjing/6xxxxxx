Hey all you death note fans out there, its 2011, where Death Note movie 3 came out in 2008, and you still haven't been able to find the third movie on anything other than a stream. Well i was the same, until I got majorly pissed that the only way i could watch it at will was to either buy the DVD, watch it subbed, or watch it online at a rate of 3 fps >:(. So what i did was find what seemed to be the only good copy on the internet, streamed it, and then went through the painstaking task of finding a program that could extract it from the temps (I used VideoCacheView by the way). So seriously guys, PLEASE SEED BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT MORE TROUBLE THAN IT SOUNDS!
