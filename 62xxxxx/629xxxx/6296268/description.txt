Plot

Detective Gen Katayama (Tetsuya Takeda, who also co-scripted) raids a Turkish bathhouse and saves Hisako Misawa (Hisayo Ariga) a deaf woman, from her fate -- she was sold into prostitution by her father. When the detective has a case in another city, he takes Hisako along and the two soon join forces to hunt down their respective bad guys, with Katayama slowly helping Hisako adjust to a normal life. Their sensitive treatment of each other is diametrically opposed to the karate scenes between the detective and the villains, not to mention some odd slapstick moments -- a real mix of intentions that might have benefitted from some time in the blender. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi
