It might seem like shait at first glance, but just give it a try.

Take HDLiTE's MKV releases for example, 720p as well and looking great at a mere ~2GB, as opposed to the usual 4-6GB. "
,roperc3,2011-05-24T08:36Z,Any way you could upload seasons 3 and 4 in HD?  These rips are awesome and there aren't any others I can find anywhere!  Thank you
,diggler93,2011-05-31T12:07Z,I've been looking everywhere for Season 3 & 4?  Anybody find anything like this in 720p?
,tomcat1234,2011-07-10T23:19Z,"uploader has all seasons except 3 up- need season 3 please :(

thanks for what's here, but up season 3 please"
,Shortstory89,2011-08-24T22:16Z,"Thanks for the upload! (would be great to see a season 3, though ;)
Thing is, the expected grains you'd find on a bluray of a non-digital show such as this seem to be amplified (perhaps by the type of compression) in a digital-looking-so-I-don't-think-it's-on-the-blu-ray kind of way. Not complaining(!) it's a quality upload, just wondering if anyone knows why. "
