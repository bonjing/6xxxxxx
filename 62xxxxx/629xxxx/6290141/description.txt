In this episode Charlie Sheen appears only for a minut or two. I've read about this and I've been loking for this one for a while (I did not have a show date;)


I'm uploading this for others like me, whom haven't seen this one yet :)









It's a pity to see Gr8 Guy wasted like that by Drugs :/
