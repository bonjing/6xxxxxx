These were ripped directly from English DVDs.  I removed the beginnings and endings, and next episode previews (unless there was a prologue and/or epilogue before/after the beginning/ending) to save space, and b/c I personally like to just get down to the show & skip the credits.  I hope you guys enjoy it!
