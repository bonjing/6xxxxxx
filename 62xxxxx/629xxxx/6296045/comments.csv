Good and fast DL though, Not gonna watch until have all or at least most of them."

There really doesn't seem to be one, so I just name them 1xx where xx is the number of the episode.  Keeps them organized in my folders.  I really should adopt the standard internet season/episode list format.  Sorry if it causes any inconvenience!"
