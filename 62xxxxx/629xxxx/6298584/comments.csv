,devtels,2011-07-28T22:34Z,So far it's a GREAT torrent! There's just one thing I don't understand yet - it's the admin panel part of it. Can anyone explain me how it works. It would be great if that's an easy alternative to edit the pages.
,devtels,2011-08-05T00:25Z,Does anyone know how to show the admin panel?

please help how do i extract this, and with what programme.. thanks in advance"
,chatner,2012-05-07T08:26Z,"@devtels: And, genius? Find the answer yourself? :)
You have to upload the ""bin""- tree to your server and to type: www.yourserver/admin, thats all, tell me, if you see something now? :)"
,chatner,2012-05-07T08:27Z,By that way: Great THX to ToXinax!
,chatner,2012-05-08T14:50Z,"And: If you extract with winzip you poss. will get ""error"" on the end with question for replacing some 0-kb-files. Don't worry, you have to answer ""Yes to all"" or ""Replace them all"" or something, no problem it will be working fine."
