Tattoo was the fourth studio album released by Rory Gallagher. The original version contained 9 tracks, all of which were written by Rory Gallagher (two extra tracks were added to the remastered version which were not originals). The album showcased the skill of Gallagher and his band across a number of genres from Delta and Chicago blues ("Who's That Coming"), the jazz influenced "They Don't Make Them Like You Anymore", blues-rock tracks such as "Tattoo'd Lady" and the riff rock shown in "Sleep On A Clothes-Line". The album also showcased Rory's writing ability and tracks have gone on to be covered by modern artists, most famously, "Cradle Rock" which was covered by Joe Bonamassa on the album A New Day Yesterday, Live. This album gave Rory Gallagher many live favourites and many tracks were played as staples in his live sets.
