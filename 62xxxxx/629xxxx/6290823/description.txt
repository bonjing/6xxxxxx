Scientist & Prince Jammy
Dub Landing Vol. 2 (2007)



Scientist--

Overton Brown was only 16 years old when producer/performer Errol "Don" Mais discovered and used the considerable talents of this adolescent dub whiz. Born in Kingston in 1960, the Scientist learned basic electronics from his TV repairman father, skills that made him very popular with the mobile DJs and their not-always-functioning sound systems. A friend suggested he visit the legendary dub producer/mixer King Tubby, not to remix records, but to get some transformers by which Scientist could build his own amplifiers. Soon the Scientist was an employee of Tubby's, fixing transformers and televisions, when one day, after an animated conversation about mixing records, Tubby challenged the Scientist to take a shot at remixing a record. Brimming with adolescent bravado, Scientist took Tubby's challenge, and that led to an extended apprenticeship in dub experimentation under Tubby's guidance. It was while at Tubby's that the Scientist developed his idiosyncratic dub style, playful and very psychedelic, loaded with echo explosions and blasts of feedback, a sound that caught the attention of Don Mais, who overheard the Scientist at the mixing board during a visit to Tubby's studio. With Mais supervising the production, Scientist, now all of 18, cut some wicked dub sides for the Roots Tradition label. At the end of the '70s, Scientist (now also referred to as "The Dub Chemist") left Tubby's to become the main engineer at Channel One Studios, and working with Henry "Junjo" Lawes, cut some best-selling dub LPs, only to leave for the greener pastures of Tuff Gong in 1982. In 1985, Scientist moved to Silver Springs, Maryland, where he lives and works as a recording engineer. 


Prince Jammy--

A member of dub's royal family, Lloyd James (aka Prince Jammy, aka King Jammy) began his career as an apprentice mixer under the late great King Tubby. The work he did engineering classic dubs for the likes of Bunny Lee, Yabby You, and others was enough to ensure his place in the history of reggae music, but Prince Jammy's story hardly stops there. He continued working as a mixer into the '80s (the dancehall era), eventually choosing to focus almost exclusively on production work. In this role, Jammy oversaw a series of releases, beginning with Black Uhuru's 1977 debut. Wayne Smith's 1985 Jammy-produced hit, "Under Me Sleng Teng," sparked a digital revolution in the reggae world, as practically every producer of note attempted to imitate the new sound. Thus, Jammy played a seminal role in three of reggae's major stylistic eras.
