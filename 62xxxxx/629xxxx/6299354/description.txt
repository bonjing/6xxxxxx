As the UK Duke tour drew to a close in May, Genesis played three incredible concerts at London venues: 5th at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; 6th and 7th at the Lyceum. 
All three shows were recorded to 24 track audio tapes by Genesis, the masters now being archived at their Farm studios. Edited sets were supplied to the BBC and to Capital Radio for broadcast. In addition, the two Lyceum dates were filmed by the BBC. These master recordings together produced a slow trickle of official bonus material and more significantly a rich and interesting broadcast history, which naturally in turn spawned a flood of highly popular bootleg releases.

In celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Duke tour, this product draws together the best available audiovisual sources of the London concerts to convey the magic of those live shows. The primary audio source is a fresh BBC transfer of their archive recording created for the December 1980 rebroadcast and provided to the Genesis Radio Show Project by a generous anonymous donor. 
Provision for the song One For The Vine which suffers speed problems on the BBC master is via a TM productions 24 bit digital transfer of an original NBC "Source" LP. Song introductions are taken from the mono video soundtracks, treated with simulated stereo. All is carefully restored with trademark TM techniques and blended seamlessly using 32 bit editing throughout.

With focus firmly on audio restoration, this nevertheless seemed an unmissable opportunity to merge the body of video footage by way of additional bonus material. The DVD uses scenes from the multicam filming of 6th wherever an acceptable sync could be maintained and then utilizes the single cam from the 7th elsewhere. Exceptions are of course made for those passages which could be better covered by the superior pre-broadcast OGWT edit and for Ripples where video montage compilation techniques were used in lieu of missing footage. The DVD features audio which benefits from the full complement of detailed restoration work but comes with the caveat that the quality of the footage is limited to the best available copies, masters being inaccessible.

Taken as a whole the idea of this synthesis is to recreate the intensity, drama and jubilation of those peak performances on the Duke tour. With a little concentration and perhaps some imagination,
you will be transported back in time to experience the majesty of these awe inspiring concerts. (excerpts from liner notes by David Dunnington)
