Das PopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Human Thing is better than it would initially seem. That isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much of an observation, and certainly not one that you would like to hear from your favourite webzine (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we hope anyway...) There are, however, enough biases that one could have when initially reading the information about this record: Das Pop draw their inspiration from the exhausted puddle of eighties and seventies music, they are from Belgium (that could be a prejudice, arguably), and on their last tour they all wore white t-shirts containing Ã¢â‚¬ËœI LOVEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (the name of their debut record), like those bumper stickers that usually invoke aggressive behaviour towards other motorists. One could argue therefore that Das Pop is just another retro-style band, trying to cash in on a current hype.

This is, however, not the case.

The Human Thing is the follow-up to 2000Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s I Love, which consisted of not-taking-itself-all-too-serious retro eighties pop with rocky elements. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bad, but it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overcome the barrier that Das Pop set for themselves by making a record with such a gimmick-like approach. That didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop I Love from becoming successful in Western Europe. For the band, however, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t satisfying. So, they forced themselves to record something that would prove that they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t destined to wear those Ã¢â‚¬ËœI LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shirts for the next decade.

And see: The Human Thing is more varied, thoughtful and longer enjoyable than I Love. The most admirable fact is how Das Pop succeeded in making all the elements of a song fit together, with an incredible feeling for timing. On exactly the right moment the musical elements enter the song in such a way that it makes you grin for a few seconds, just because it is played in exactly the right position.

Das Pop has succeeded in creating a record that brings other musical styles to mind, but has enough of their own to be distinctive, and indeed, very enjoyable.
