,ULBs,2011-04-06T03:18Z,just works if you have the latest version of os x
,ULBs,2011-04-06T04:49Z,"make sure when you open the game, open it in a window to start and then go full screen once it is fully loaded"

,Petermm55,2011-04-10T18:15Z,"I just get a grey screen. I tried messing with the fullscreen settings, but it doesn't work. This is ported. Also, the mouse is a bit off. Things say their highlighted even when their not."
,monofool,2011-04-12T09:37Z,"I found it worked on my external screen. But when I tried it without all I got was the greyed out map.
Strategic view worked, and all menu functions worked. I've tried all screen res options with no dice as yet.
It worked perfect on the external screen though..
thoughts.....?

,ryceg,2011-04-12T14:59Z,"the menus have no text...This makes it somewhat hard to know what to do. I managed to stumble into a campaign, but all of the text in that was also borked. Ideas? I'm running a 2011 2.7Ghz i7 Macbook pro, 4gb ram, 13"" display. Running 10.6.7. Is that the problem?"

,Suuuuushi,2011-04-18T00:11Z,"I'm having a problem launching the application file. I tried to research it but I couldn't find a solution to it, and I'm new to OS X so if anyone knows the solution it would be really appreciated. So I downloaded the .dmg file and my computer verified it with diskutility or imagemounter of sort. And when I oped the drive, the .app file called Civilization V popped up. I clicked it, but nothing happens. I reinstalled the file and tried many standard tricks but with no prevail. Does anyone have similar problem where they click the launch/app button but nothing happens? Thanks in advance!"

And something about deficiency in Wine... is this because i have os 10.5.8? does it only work on 10.6?"
,ldsfullmetal,2011-04-21T13:40Z,also is this a portal version from windows? since it says CivilizationV.exe?
