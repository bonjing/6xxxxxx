A storyline of Anachronox (2001) game in the form of movie.

wiki:

Cinematic director Jake Hughes independently combined the game's cut-scenes into a feature-length film.
The film ran two-and-a-half-hours long, and was released as 13 MPEG files on Machinima.com.

The work was considered the genre's first feature-length production and one of the most ambitious machinima projects of its time.

Judges at the 2002 Machinima Film Festival awarded it Best Picture, Best Writing, and Best Technical Achievement.
Machinima.com's editors said of the film, "Anachronox: The Movie is a tour-de-force, one of the finest Machinima films produced to date, and probably the most accomplished Machinima feature to date. Hell, it managed to hold two over-worked jury members in a room for two and a half hours before the MFF 2002 - what more can we say?". As of 2003, Machinima.com planned to release the film on DVD with extra footage and artwork.
