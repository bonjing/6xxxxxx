I live in uk we lost TBB just after katie & nick were together & it ended with a cliff hanger with Ridge & brook when they were to marry but I think it fell apart due to brooks son (forgot his name at the moment) do you know the time I am talking about? you would not have these would you?
[V],ClaudiaZ,2011-04-06T23:33Z,"Hi there, let me check that for you, I don't remember exactly when that happened, but I'll try to figure it out (could someone help me?)... I'm not sure I have these episodes, though, but let me see."
,billie4491,2011-04-07T21:41Z,"Katie & Nick were together, Rick had the accident which killed Phoebe, rick was then with Steffi and had stole the designs and gave them to nick which caused trouble with him & Steffi also Katie & Nick  it ended with a cliff hanger with Ridge & brook when they were to marry but I think it fell apart  but I donât know what happens when I started down loading yours Hope was grown-up and bill spencer was with Katie, do you know the time I am talking about?

[V],ClaudiaZ,2011-04-08T11:37Z,"Yeah, of course, now I remember it!! Phoebe died in December 2008, so those eps must be from January-February 2009. I'm afraid but I began uploading B&B in June 2009, so I don't have those episodes. Sorry! Maybe someone still has them from dolphingirl and can share them for you. Sorry again!!"
