BBC Hadrian 720p HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2008

In 2008 the British Museum launched its spectacular exhibition on the emperor Hadrian, Dan Snow takes us on a journey around Hadrian's vast empire. As he does so, he uncovers the genius and the darker side of the man: peace-maker, frontier-builder, star-crossed lover, architect - and ruthless oppressor of the jews. But still, Dan concludes, Hadrian was one of the greatest Roman emperors.
