From Booklist
Stuffed with puzzles, jokes, word problems, puns, and history and lore about math, this sequel to Professor Stewartâ€™s Cabinet of Mathematical Curiosities (2009) reads like a numbers guy performing stand-up comedy (â€œA piece of a string walked into a bar . . .â€). An old hand at the routine, Stewartâ€™s contention that his compendium can entertain anyone with math-class memories is amply borne out, and his ability to surprise is one reason. One never knows whatâ€™s next: a proof that two plus two indeed equals four jostles with a spoof of proof itself. To keep readers on their toes, or at least flipping back to his â€œsuperlative storehouse of sneaky solutions,â€ Stewart flummoxes them with bizarre propositions, such as two plus two actually equals zeroâ€”when youâ€™re doing modular arithmetic. Speaking of equality, the equal sign makes for a go-to topic for amusing vignettes, while stories about math underlying modern technology underscore the serious side of a subject with which Stewart makes such good sport. A great distraction for math mavens at any knowledge level. --Gilbert Taylor
Product Description
Opening another drawer in his Cabinet of Curiosities, renowned mathematics professor Ian Stewart presents a new medley of games, paradoxes, and riddles in Professor Stewartâ€™s Hoard of Mathematical Treasures. With wit and aplomb, Stewart mingles casual puzzles with grander forays into ancient and modern mathematical thought.

Amongst a host of arcane and astonishing facts about every kind of number from irrational and imaginary to complex and cuneiform, we learn:

â€¢ How to organize chaos
â€¢ How matter balances anti-matter
â€¢ How to turn a sphere inside out (without creasing it)
â€¢ How to calculate pi by observing the stars
â€¢ â€¦and why you canâ€™t comb a hairy ball.

Along the way Stewart offers the reader tantalizing glimpses of the mathematics underlying life and the universe. Mind-stretching, enlightening, and endlessly amusing, Professor Stewartâ€™s Hoard of Mathematical Treasures will stimulate, delight, and enthrall.
