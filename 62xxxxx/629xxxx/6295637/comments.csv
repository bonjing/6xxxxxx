,manweezy,2011-04-11T18:04Z,"Hey HolyRoses, having trouble playing your rips on my 2nd gen appletv.  It recognizes the files and tries to play them, but they won't actually play.  Any thoughts?  Thanks"

God BLess!"
,thesaxon,2011-08-20T19:51Z,"Thank the fucking Pirate gods! A Pirate that encodes in m4v/mp4 format. What the fuck is with all these douche bags encoding to AVi, MKV, Divx, Xvid and all those other ""desktop/laptop"" viewing codecs? Who the fuck watches these movies on their god damned computers? I have to download and then export every single freakin movie just so everyone can view it on their iPods, AppleTV, iPhones and iPads. I love to use Plex in a perfect world. But I can't help but wonder what sort of a basement dwelling icky freak doesn't have iTunes or idevices? When Apple un-puckers their assholes and starts to play nice with other codecs, it will solve all our worlds problems. But that's likely never going to happen. Until then, where are the trillions of iDevice users on PB? I am going to have to start uploading in m4v for the rest of the Pirates that role in Nuclear subs rather than on wood and sails. Thanks so much. "
