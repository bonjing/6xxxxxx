Himesh Reshammiya is an Indian Composer, Singer, actor and TV Serial Producer. He started his career at the age of 16, as a TV Serial Producer. Later he went to become a composer for Indian films. In 2005, he stepped into singing, and his songs became chartbusters. In 2007, his first movie as an actor got released, and it was a hit at the box office. However, his remaining movies failed to impress the common audience and went to be non-profitable ventures, despite the good music in them. He is currently doing his first Hollywood film titled 'A Star Is Killed', which is rumoured to be based on the mysterious death of yesteryear rockstar Michael Jackson.

Here is the complete collection of his hindi movies, as an actor.
