                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Following up on his 2007 documentary, The Most Hated Family in America, Louis 
 Theroux returns to Topeka, Kansas, for a week-long visit with the Westboro    
 Baptist Church.                                                               
                                                                               
 He again joins the Phelps family on their controversial pickets where they try
 to antagonise communities with offensive slogans and anti-gay placards. But   
 four years on from Louis's last visit, there are signs of disarray in the     
 Phelps clan. A series of defections of family members has shaken up the       
 church.                                                                       
                                 Enjoy!
