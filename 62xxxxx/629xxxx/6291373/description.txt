My thanks to the original seeder for the Best of the Beat Club series from which these 3 tracks have been carefully lifted and edited using TMPGxpress software so just the music is there and none of the original German introductions.

A classic look at Mid 60 styles and dance moves too :-)  Look out for the bit where the lead singer has to take a step back as the dancers get a little too close for comfort.

Tracks: Dizzy Miss Lizzy
        Ferry 'Cross The Mersey
        My Babe
