v8 a9 (judging among cam recordings, not dvd and stuff).

Contrast is a bit sharp at the darker scenes, but it's still clear enough. 
The subtitles are on the vid, and cannot be removed, atleast I couldn't. But they're not bothering me, but this is also because the subtitles are on the same place and look the same as in my country.

Thank you a lot!"
