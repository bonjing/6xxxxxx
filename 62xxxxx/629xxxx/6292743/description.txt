This is a Steve Reich album released by Nonesuch Records in 2005. It has two new pieces on it: "You Are (Variations)" and "Cello Counterpoint." They are played here by the Los Angeles Master Chorale.

The first is a series of four meditations on traditional Hebrew proverbs or wisdom sayings. There is a vocal line repeating the words of the proverb along with a small instrumental ensemble. The arrangement is unusual: it includes three sopranos, an alto and two tenors, flutes, oboe, English horn, two marimbas, clarinets, four pianos, vibraphone and strings. 

The second is an incredibly intricate piece for eight cellos, a work which Reich calls "my most difficult counterpoint". It is played here by a single cellist, Mara Beiser. Rather than commissioning an octet, Reich had her record all the parts herself by overdubbing.

I think these pieces are some of Reich's best work to date. I ripped them from the original CD using lossless (FLAC) encoding.
