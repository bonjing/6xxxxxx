                   *Will be released on April 12, 2011.*


2011 release by this Electronic project led by Bernard Fevre. The album opens with the apocalyptic visions of Jon Spencer of the legendary Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, before Nancy Fortune transports the listener to a piano bar in a distant galaxy. 'X Paradise' is where Aja Emma of Canadian electro-pop outfit Cosmetics chooses to hang, while Faris Badwan of The Horrors is trapped in a dream on 'Distrust.' Claire Evans of Yacht claims that she would prefer to 'Stay Insane' and that if Jesus was to return to Earth we would surely kill him.
