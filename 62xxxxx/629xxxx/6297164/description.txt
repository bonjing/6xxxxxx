The first spaceship to Mars rounds the Red Planet and 
heads back toward Earth but runs into an unexplained 
phenomenon in space that accelerates the craft to such 
a high speed that all four men aboard black out. When 
they awake, they've crash-landed on a planet similar to 
Earth soon they are pursued by ugly "Mutates," they are 
taken in by the declining remnants of human civilization 
who live underground. It's now 2508 A.D, almost 400 years 
after an atomic war almost wiped out the human race. 

John Borden (Hugh Marlowe) falls in love with Garnet 
(Nancy Gates), daughter of Timmek (Everett Glass), leader 
of the underground people -- a fact that enrages Mories 
(Booth Colman), who's always assumed she would someday be 
his. 

The scheming Mories tries to turn his people against 
the space/time travelers, but falls victim to his own 
nefarious plans. Learning from Deena (Lisa Montell), a 
servant girl from the surface of Earth, that most people 
up there are normal though cruelly ruled by the deformed 
ones, Borden and his friends take on the mutates with 
modern weaponry and reclaim the Earth for normal humanity. 

Although this is (surprisingly) the first American feature 
film to deal with scientific time travel,  The plotline owes 
more than a little to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine 
(a lawsuit was filed), which makes the presence of Rod 
Taylor in the cast (as the hunk from our time) a little 
ironic, as just a few years later, he starred in George Pal's 
much-loved movie version of the Wells novel.
