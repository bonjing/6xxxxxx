For all of you downloaders, I would like to give you some advice, 
you should at least be using an IP blocker such as PeerGuardian 2
and Ultrasurf (hides your ip) they are both free and fairly easy 
to set up. 
The next level of security is an Anonymous Proxy or a VPN, both 
hide your IP address, but VPN hides everything you do online, I 
am afraid you have to pay for both of those, but will prevent 
ISP letters.
