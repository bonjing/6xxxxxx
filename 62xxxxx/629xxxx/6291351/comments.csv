We are all made of the same dirt of the heavens, making humans divine. End times in most Abrahamic religions (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, main 3) emphasize mass loss, and devastation. If you think we are not in the end times I think we can agree they are looming. Keep up with your hate and you will bring more hate upon you, keep love in your heart and to your neighbor and love will fill your life. Love is all you need. QUIT FUCKING KILLING EACH OTHER "
