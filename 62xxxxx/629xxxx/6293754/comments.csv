If people dont want subtitles, they can turn it off, but us that want em can leave em on.

Shame"
,ShadowXcz,2011-04-04T18:43Z,"Shame? Seriously fuck you.
It takes approx. 1 minute for me to get a working subtitle, starting the goddamn movie and enjoying it. Doesn't Mr. HR's awesome quality rips satisfy you enough? Shame.

Thx for this HR, keep it up."
,BetterThanLife,2011-04-04T19:17Z,"I hear what you're saying Shadow, and I like it. It's not very difficult to get subs are on your own, when it is in fact you who wants them. These gorgeous quality releases are surely enough to satisfy the majority."
,henrikhoe,2011-04-05T00:06Z,"you guys need to learn the difference between srts downloaded from the net, and a muxed file with a subtitle track.

Its a hassle for me to remux a file with included subtitles for apple tv.

You guys know nothing im afraid."
,BetterThanLife,2011-04-05T11:37Z,Is it also a huge hassle for you to download elsewhere?
,fedeval,2011-04-06T10:49Z,"Its amazing how ungreatful people may be...

thanks HR for your good work, most of us really, really, really appreciate it.

,rakz2cul,2011-04-07T01:25Z,@ HolyRoses can you specify the size of the two audio individually in mbs...
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-07T03:01Z,"No, the bitrate is exactly as stated.  Size will always vary based on length."
,kabubuki,2011-04-11T17:15Z,"Henrikhoe,

You can use Subler to quickly add the SRT file to the video file.  It's fast and no hassle at all.  No remux required and works with AppleTV.

Holyroses...  thanks for all of your rips...  great quality..."
