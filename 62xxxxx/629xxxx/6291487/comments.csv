,zappaz123,2011-04-03T13:52Z,I get the extraction error too on the other Mechanical simulation torrent. pls - make a fresh new torrent (look at comments there).
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-04-03T14:24Z,Unrar only 1 .rar file with winrar . There should be no problems as i exstracted it my self. no errors. i will seed thouse again so mby someone who finished got it corrupt and now seeding to others the same corrupt files.
,zappaz123,2011-04-03T18:44Z,"I have to be honest ;)

I got the mec.simul. 100%, removed it from uTorrent and right-click extract on the single .rar file. 

It gave error-msg on the iso just before end of extract. This it did twice.

Later i tried again - still on the single .rar, knowing that rar continues by itself to next.. and by surprise it finished without any errors

totally weird

maybe uTorrent still had it's claws on something though the DL was removed from uTorrent..."
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-04-03T18:52Z,"I guess that guy who got it he's download was corrupt and he seeded to others also corrupt files.
Im clad you finally got it to work , i seed it my self now also."

I mounted the 64 bit version with PowerIso and proceeded as the installation notes suggested and got this problem for both the Mechanical and Multi 64 bit version."

,maxiddd,2011-05-31T03:23Z,"Works Great!! Thanks!
I also got ""Please insert the disc: AutoCAD Mechanical 2012 DVD"" message, when I tried with mounted disc image drive. I extracted all the files to local hard drive. Then it worked."
,Hashhamster,2011-09-13T00:12Z,I'm I the only one that gets a generated activation key that is 8 chars to short? (i.e. the last two text fields are left blank) and naturally the activation key is not accepted...)
