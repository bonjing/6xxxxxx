,ashlewis,2011-04-05T05:27Z,"is the spoken language able to be changed to english 
thx heaps"
[V],globeplus,2011-04-05T14:30Z,"To ashlewis : that it is possible in 2 ways :
1 - get the english audio and making the synchronisation correctly with a movies program changing the actual audio for the new one making sense with the picture even if a little bit from the start and the end of movie cutted to be appropriate on the picture but of course the ideal it is a new cam with the audio already on the movie without the need of this work
2 - the best solution in case of no other files is using a subtitle program making the correct synchronisation with the subtitle and for this option this type of file it is ok

Cheers ."
