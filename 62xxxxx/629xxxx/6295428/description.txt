Deep Purple's 1973 "Who Do We Think We Are" is a fantastic album. It's been shuffled into the background behind some of those other Purple classics "Machine Head," "Fireball" and "In Rock". The great production, the hard driving polished playing and the killer songs make for one really enjoyable album. The Audio Fidelity remastering is easy on the ears, and it also includes the lyrics. The EMI re-mastering was good, but this is great!!! So now, we Deep Purple fans will have to have two copies of "Who Do We Think We Are" in our CD collection. 

I've read all the reviews on this album and it seems that the big favorites are "Woman From Tokyo", "Smooth Dancer" and "Rat Bat Blue". While "Mary Long", "Our Lady" "Super Trooper" and "Place In Line" get there share of votes too. All this positive feedback proves something I've known all along, this is one great album. Now sounding better than ever. 

Thanks Mr. Hoffman. Bring on the U.S. version of "Fireball" next. 
Long Live DP!
