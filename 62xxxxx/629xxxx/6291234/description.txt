When Gentle Giant put out their new Alucard remasters from the original master tapes in 2009, there was one glaring problem on the [i]Free Hand[/i] album: the track \\\\\\\"Time to Kill\\\\\\\" had some horrible print-through in the first couple seconds. It started quiet, with an early ghost image during the Pong game. But it got louder and gradually shifted on the timeline. When the band\\\\\\\'s track came in, the print-through was practically an echo track. Then by the third measure, it was suddenly gone. A strange bit of damage, indeed, and one that was terribly annoying to listen to. No other version of the album had ever had that damage! So I just had to fix it.

It\\\\\\\'s a simple process. We use Repli-Q with the 35th Anniversary version of the song to make the equalization curve match the Alucard version. Then we carefully cut out the parts of the Alucard version that have the damage, including the damaged portion of the Pong game, and replace those portions with the newly-EQed Anniversary version. Check it against your own copy of the Alucard remaster. Nothing is missing. The only parts that have been changed are the damaged ones. Everything else is the Anniversary version, unchanged.
