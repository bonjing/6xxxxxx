   The Smell of Success (2009)
  
  When a tragic accident ends the life of Mr. Rose, the genius 
  behind Rose's Manure Company, the livelihood of its loyal 
  fleet of salesmen threatens to go, as they say, into the toilet. 
  Enter estranged daughter Rosemary, a high-class- cosmetics 
  salesgirl, who steps in to take control. She is not sure she has 
  a nose for the family business, but she is determined to make 
  foul into profit. Little does she know that a ruthless, 
  slick-talking fertilizer rep is plotting a takeover. Whether she 
  likes it or not, she must trust her top salesman, Patrick Fitzpatrick, 
  to devise a plan to regain Rose's rightful position on top of the heap.
