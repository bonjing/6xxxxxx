SUMMARY:

Fedora is a Linux-based operating system, a suite of software that makes your computer run. You can use the Fedora operating system to replace or to run alongside of other operating systems such as Microsoft Windowsâ„¢ or Mac OS Xâ„¢. The Fedora operating system is 100% free of cost for you to enjoy and share.

Hope you guys enjoy this and don't forget to seed. I will upload another torrent once this has enough seeds.

REMINDER - This is the 64-Bit version of Fedora 14. If you are running on a 32-Bit system then you will need the 32-Bit version which I will be uploading soon.


Peace,
Angelus
