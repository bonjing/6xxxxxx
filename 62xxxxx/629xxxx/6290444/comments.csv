At what stage was virtual dub used for this rip, as my media info tells me it wasnt used in the final stage of the rip.... the reason I looked into it is because, if in fact it had been muxed or even direct stream copy'd through virtual dub it would have worked on my DVD player...."

Very good movie. All events are historical from WW2. Actual life in Europe under German and Soviet occupation was much more dramatic and tragic than all Hollywood film scenarios together. No propaganda of any sort in this particular film. ""No Way Back"" is the best war movie made so far. Read memoirs of former prisoners of German and Soviet death camps from WW2 and you will know what is a propaganda and what is the truth.

M - It's an American movie so obviously it's going to be some sort of distortion of history. Apart from that, as a movie, it was surprisingly entertaining and well made.
However, I cant but feel I bit annoyed by the lack of dedication from the actors.
I mean, Christian Bale starved himself half to death for the role In ""the machinist"" without even get asked to do it.
In this movie you have starved to death prisoners that haven't even gone on a mild diet for the role. Lame."

The quality is very good, as always with ExtremeZone.  The movie itself was okay.  The entire time, I was thinking it was ""inspired by real events"", and it made the movie more interesting.  Later, I read up on the fact that it was all likely a load of crap.  It kinda ruined it for me because the only reason I really found the movie interesting at all was because it was supposed to be kind of real.  If it was just another movie, they should have went all out and put a lot more substance into the film.  

Either way, it's a decent movie and of great quality.  "
