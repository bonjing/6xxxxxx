Wishbone Ash - Argus (Remastered & Revisited) & BBC in concert
--------------------

Argus is the third album by the rock band Wishbone Ash.
It is the most popular Wishbone Ash album and widely 
considered their greatest by fans and reviewers.


Cd 1 is from Argus (2002 Remastered & Revisited Expanded Edition)

Cd 2 is from Argus (2007 Deluxe edition) BBC in concert session 1972

I had to do this,because all the "Cds 1" from Argus 2007 Deluxe Edition
were full of errors (4 of 4 I have tried).So I only have the "artwork"
from Argus Remastered & Revisited.
If I find a fault-free "Cd 1", I will upload it with the "artwork".
