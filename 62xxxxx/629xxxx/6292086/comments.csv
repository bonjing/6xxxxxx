,silveroakleaf,2011-04-04T01:39Z,"I download shows throughout the week and always put the completed files in a single folder.

Then at the end of the week, I always seed the weekly packs, but for some reason, this one rechecked and only got to 99.8% ... now I'm sitting here with 3 partially incomplete files and zero download speed and zero connected seeds.

Oh well, no good deed goes unpunished!"
,funpigj,2011-04-04T03:10Z,"So, is it better to keep seeding the packs for the week (I keep seeding the dailies until there are zero peers and zero seeds) or to move their completed files into this folder and seed from here?

Thx for Marshland and The Runaways, gonna give them a shot."
,silveroakleaf,2011-04-04T03:55Z,"I think I might just seed the daily's.  Not knowing much about torrenting, I'm worried the weekly torrent might be messing up some of my originally downloaded files...and the worse part is, I can't seem to get the files to 100% again due to lack of (connecting) seeds.

Any experts in the field out there?  After recheck, I was at 99.8% and after 8 hours I've only been able to download 2mb (getting me to 99.9%)."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-04T06:57Z,"One of the files downloaded during the week obviously is either incomplete and falsely identified (back then) as ""completed"".
When moved ""under"" this torrent, hash check fails.

2nd possibility is that your disk is fragmented and files fail ""cutting"" into chunks  confusing hash-recheck routine in torrent-program you run.
It's strange, however, that no one is connected to you - because even if you have just ONE file - you would seed that one. In your case, you would seed 99.9% of the torrent, right?

If you wanna see if some of existing files went bad - there is no alternative but trying to play each one of 100+ files, for second only, maybe...

Sorry."

,silveroakleaf,2011-04-05T01:44Z,"It must have been a fragmentation/hash check snafu.  I downloaded the daily torrent for the same file and it rechecked fine.  

Next time I will try seeding from a duplicate folder on a faster local drive.   I think my older server & drive system has trouble keeping up with these bigger torrents with multiple files...

hmmm, maybe I should give myself permission to upgrade?"
,horizon91,2011-04-05T06:36Z,Hey man thankx 4 ur efforts....
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-05T10:48Z,"Repeating my comment from believenu's Lost Girl torrent, as it is pertinent here:

Wow--20-40's suggested method of seeding actually works! ;)
Just open the torrent and select the files you need, and de-select everything else--then select for the download location the folder where the Lost Girl (or whatever) episodes you already have are filed, and your bittorrent client will read from (and therefore seed) the files already there, even though you de-selected (skipped) them."
