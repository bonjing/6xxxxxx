Traktor has encountered a major problem and needs to close
AppName: traktor.exe	 AppVer: 2.0.1.10169	 ModName: unknown
ModVer: 0.0.0.0	 Offset: 6e726574"
,leim,2011-06-14T20:20Z,"yea this software is a piece of shit, the bmp is f'ed up and the sound is way shitty, dont even know why they have it up here, TOTAL SHIT!!!"
,tuff3rz,2011-06-27T02:21Z,"Are you all stupid?

This was an issue with even THE RETAIL version.
1. Grab ASIO4All 
2. Install with standard settings (nothing fancy, k? just keep hitting next)
3. Run Traktor Pro 2 after installation.
4. Hit the little cog/gear in the top right hand corner
5. Go to audio set up tab.
6. Select Audio Device as ""ASIO4ALL v2""
7. Sample rate 48000hz

This should give you true bpm and key. there's a bug where 41000hz causes a shift in speed and key.

It's bpm by the way, fucktards."
,tuff3rz,2011-06-27T02:33Z,"Also while you are in the Settings menu go to the ""Transport"" Tab, Under Keylock, make sure it is set to HiQ.

ASIO4All can be found here.

And thanks again, keep seeding!"
,djderek23,2011-07-13T22:58Z,Is there any way to have it so that Traktor recognizes you on startup so your cues youv been workin on can be saved? along with not having to go through installwizard every time you open the program

,mpsnedag,2011-08-27T19:42Z,"Hey, this says windows 7 tested, but for some reason the sound is staticey and muffled. Any reason why? I have an HP DV6-3225dx windows 7 64 bit computer. My drivers are up to date. I changed the audio settings in Traktor to MASTER OUTPUT: ""Speakers and headphones L"" and ""Speakers and headphones R"" (under output routing). Under audio setup, i put in my default sound card. Anyone know how to fix this? Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!"
,DJ_SEVEN,2011-09-25T21:03Z,"Allright i can see clear as day that most of the people here, dosn't have a FUCKINNNNNG clue about the software or hardware for that matter, why even bother if you have a brain lika a chicken?

Theres nothing wrong with the software, im using it quite frequently, i have several HI END controllers, not piece of shit like Herkules, Maudio, Numark or American DJ.

Buy qualitygear from start, if you dont have the cash, save some, get the music and for fuck sake educate yourself, the time of riding knowlages of others is up!"

,jayboz1,2011-10-31T23:06Z,does anyone if this will work with audio 6 before i download it ?
,Dutchadam,2012-01-16T03:37Z,"After using all of your tips. I still have a broken sound! I don't use any controller, just using my computer! So ASIO4ALL has no effect on this. What can i do?"
,segregx,2012-02-07T21:38Z,maybe you should use older asio4all version on http://www.asio4all.com/. 2.9. works for me.
,Abelabe,2012-03-08T14:30Z,"First I'd like to say thanks to OP for the torrent, works fine for now

@DJ_SEVEN You're a real asshole for saying shit like that.

First of all, some people are pretty new to this software and similar stuff like FL and Ableton Live.

Second of all, not all people share your hostility against newbies, I for one am glad I could ask people in forums (DjTT for instance) when I started mixing

And third of all ""knowlage"" is spelled knowledge. If you're having a hard time sharing info to your fellow man, you should expect the same treatment in the future. If you happen to need education on spelling, which seems to be the case here, you wouldn't like being told you have the brain of a chicken. So cut it, and educate yourself, or deal with the fact that some people need a good head start with the help of professionals."
,Abelabe,2012-03-08T14:35Z,"If everyone thought like you, DJ_SEVEN, thepiratebay.org would not exist because the main idea of this site is TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE! And then (Assuming that you downloaded the software here, since you comment on this particular torrent and one doesn't just come across this by coincidence) you wouldn't have TSP. Good day sir!"
,Abelabe,2012-03-08T15:05Z,"Last comment to sum/stir up shit:

As long as there are people in the world protesting against ACTA and SOPA, as long as there are still libraries in the world, AND AS long as Wikipedia exists, the time of ""riding on the knowledge of others"" is never up!

Join the fight, and stop being ridiculous. We can't all be Einstein, and there's a reason you can go to school. To ride on the knowledge of the people who are willing to share it!"
,strafe,2012-03-10T11:16Z,"Also, after you install asio4all, and you're running speakers in the front channel (green) and headphones in the side channel (black), you will need to set up the speaker outputs.

Make sure you have set the output monitor to HD Audio Output 7 and 8.  

Also the output Master Channels should be HD Audio Output 1 and 2.  

Hope this helps."
