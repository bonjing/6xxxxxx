[T],NoggintheNomad,2011-05-13T15:54Z,"Thanks for this. I was at the O2 gig last night when David Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Roger Waters on stage. I have the original vinyl, but this is good for the iPod."

,91lexis,2011-09-26T21:37Z,"I've a question!
In the song: Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1) there's a beep between 2:32 and 2:34.
I really like the remastered quality, but this beep sort of ruins the experience..."
,Vermont1971,2011-11-17T13:39Z,Hey! Whats wrong with The Thin Ice??? What is that??
,randy94666,2011-11-20T16:36Z,Pink Floyd is horribly overrated. 
,DJBIRCH,2011-12-17T12:14Z,what's wrong with this? some songs louder than others? it's a piece of shit d/load don't bother.
,twinandearth,2012-02-11T17:56Z,Quickest download I've ever had. Perfect quality. Thank you very nicely.
,bitchwheremypbj,2012-02-18T01:55Z,What DJBIRCH said. Some tracks are louder than others. Other than that it's good.
,azizen,2012-05-19T17:10Z,"If you're annoyed by the difference in sound volume, download the freeware MP3gain ( http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/ ). It's really handy and fast to work with!
