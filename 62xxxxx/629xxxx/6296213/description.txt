         With its armored shell, ancient anatomy, and                  
         350-million-year lineage, the horseshoe crab almost seems     
         too inconspicuous to stir up controversy. Yet this humble     
         creature is at the very center of a collision between three   
         completely different species. For many decades, humans have   
         harvested the horseshoe crab for use as fishing bait. Since   
         the 1970s, we have also used horseshoe crab blood for         
         medical purposes. But we may have gone too far. Horseshoe     
         crab numbers have declined significantly since the early      
         1990s. And, naturally, so did their egg numbers. This         
         is especially important to a small shorebird that is          
         a global traveler of the most impressive kind. The red        
         knot makes one of the longest migrations of any animal -      
         a journey that takes it from one end of the earth to the      
         other. To accomplish this feat, it relies on the eggs of      
         the horseshoe crab. Without these eggs, the red knot is in    
         danger. In the film Crash: A Tale of Two Species, filmmaker   
         Allison Argo tells the story of nature's amazing ability      
         to create fragile connections among the most unexpected       
         creatures, and of our potential as humans to destroy those    
          connections - or restore them.
