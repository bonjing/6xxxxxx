Where's the .iso file and Extras folder you mention?

I'm not going to download and run a .exe file from someone with 2 torrents."
,the-linux-group,2011-04-09T23:40Z,Because it was used to save space. It is a archive that extracts the ISO file! DUH!
,ned316,2011-04-22T00:12Z,Ok seriously ive formatted my USB. Cant mount the ISO on to the USB and boot it. Please help me
,the-linux-group,2011-04-23T09:21Z,Did you format with the HP USB format tool?
,ned316,2011-04-23T19:46Z,Yes i did. How do i mount it properly onto the USB. And do i need to change anything in my BIOS...coz it says BOOT from CD. I have a Dell also :D
,the-linux-group,2011-04-26T01:46Z,You need to bun the image (.iso) to a DVD or CD with a program I included (well I think I did) Imgburn. Then you should be good to go.
,argelst0rm,2011-04-28T15:07Z,detect as bootable minor virus by XSE power anti virus
,the-linux-group,2011-04-30T20:21Z,Thats bullshit. What file does the program think is a virus?

,Bad_Case,2011-05-23T04:08Z,"son of a bitch i had wrote out a long ass message praising you for your work and then  my login timed out and i thought i had copied it first but obviously it was the link to the page i had copied lol.

But anyway it works perfectly just follow the instruction that the poster took the time to write out and your good to go.

Great work saved me the headache of making myself a new one."
,the-linux-group,2011-05-28T22:26Z,"to Bad_Case,

Thank you for liking my torrent. When I typed the description up, I had to read through it and put myself in those positions to get the best USB version of Windows. I had to read over it a few times, but, I got it perfect!"
,sasliks,2011-06-03T12:51Z,Tnx! Works 100% on Fujicsu Siemens Amilio Pro V2058
,KillFrenZ,2011-06-03T14:50Z,"Cant get it to boot normally on my LE50-3c2z. Safe mode works fine, but cant run the network-controller and bus-controller setup to run in Safe mode. All other drivers installed. Help annyone? stop error 0x000007B if i try normal mode."
,sasliks,2011-06-03T15:17Z,KillFrenZ Did you format jour Usb drive with HP USB format tool ?
,KillFrenZ,2011-06-03T16:11Z,Yes i did. It reads the boot dir and boots from the flash. But only in safemode :/
,KillFrenZ,2011-06-03T16:15Z,"""""3.) If you get stop error 0x000007B this normally indicates a boot failure. Restart the PC and press F8 to select safe mode and normally it will boot up. I had to install video drivers and network drivers n the Gateway NV53 to get rid of this."""" 

My problem is I cant install the Network drivers in Safemode. Is there anny way i can bypass that?"
,KillFrenZ,2011-06-03T16:19Z,Yes i did. Think the only problem is the Network drivers i cant install in Safemode. Any way to do that?
,sasliks,2011-06-03T18:43Z,"KillFrenZ: Then how old are your PC?
if you dont have HI SPEED USB PORT mybee thets the problem! Ijust finish install it and it works but wery slow!"
,KillFrenZ,2011-06-03T19:30Z,Its about 4 years old i think. But it has USB2 for sure. Using a kingston DataTraveler 4gig. 
,sasliks,2011-06-03T22:08Z,Hmm my Laptop is much older but it works for me! i use Platinium 8gb! sorry but then i can not help you! try to contact with this torrent uploder!
,KillFrenZ,2011-06-03T22:20Z,"I want to, because he writes in his 'readme' about this error. Problem is i cant install the Network drivers in safe mode... or i dont know how."
,sasliks,2011-06-04T09:27Z,With network drivers i have problems too! when i install them my windows dont start up! it show it iz lodig vindows xp and nothung more!
,the-linux-group,2011-09-23T18:05Z,"Alright, the network problem error is caused by a driver that screws up the USB driver, how to fix it, I have no idea at this point."
,the-linux-group,2011-09-23T18:29Z,"1 more thing, if the HP format tool doesn't work, go Google it and download it again."
