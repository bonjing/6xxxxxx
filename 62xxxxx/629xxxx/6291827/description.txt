Iâ€™ve brought here another new old krauty which â€“ as well as Agitation Free, Brainstorm and Embryo to name a few â€“ played progressive rock mixed with jazz, thus â€œjazz-rockâ€ or even jazz-fusion, inspired by the music that was being developed in Canterbury cultural scenary, in England. Eiliff was formed in the late 60s and although they hadnâ€™t made a name for themselves even in the German underground scenary, they could be easily considered as one of the best German jazz-fusion bands from that time. Sadly they only put out two studio albums which were even made available in CD format, in despite of probably being out-of-catalog nowadays.

For our happiness, Garden of Delights released for the first time ever two live recordings from the band, as being one recorded in Cologne in 1972 â€“ the album â€˜Close Encounters With Their Third Oneâ€™ â€“ and this one recorded in Bremen by Radio Bremen in the very same year. At that time Radio Bremen were recording many of those bands concerts to be broadcast as part of â€˜Jazz Concertâ€™ programme. All of these highly-precious recordings are lying on Radio Bremenâ€™s own vaults and Garden of Delights has been gradually making these recordings available for sale for the first time ever.

Eiliff set for this show is packed with uncountable solos and jammings in just two tracks, in which the last of them lasts over half an hour! But otherwise you wonâ€™t even realize the transition in between the tracks, so itâ€™s a freaking straight-forward sequence at once. And a great curiosity is that the guitarrist of this band, HouschÃ¤ng NejadÃ©pour, had been member of Kraftwerk and after Eiliff end, he would become member of Guru Guru for a while.
