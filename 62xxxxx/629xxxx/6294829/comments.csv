,ZildjianX17,2011-04-08T00:48Z,"Hey thanks for uploading this! I have a problem though. I downloaded, unrared and started to install Autodesk, but when I had to choose the installation file path, it wouldn't accept any path I chose. It gives me an error that says the file path is longer than 87 characters, which it isn't. For example: (C:\Program Files\) Any help would be appreciated =)"

,akumara,2011-05-10T20:06Z,"Worked perfectly well. If it is giving error after pasting the activation code. Generate the code again from the crack it will provide the new. Try with that you will get success in the end.
Thanks to Cris."

All help appreciated. :)"
,joboq,2011-06-07T19:47Z," if you get the ""Disk 2"" erro.. 
then copy the mounted folder to the disk and rename the folder name to Inventor and think there should be a file inside with the same name.. rename it to Inventor.. it worked at inventor 11 .. else the full detailse should be in a INVENTOR 11 Download in here .. ;) "

,man-united,2011-10-12T00:58Z,keygen is not good
,man-united,2011-10-12T01:16Z,Chris - keygen does not work !
,jla987,2011-10-17T11:15Z,"Ive got a bit of a problem with activation.
Before this version, i had the STUDENT version. After getting sick of the restriction, i decided to get the full version.
Everything installs fine. Its not until i start it up, expecting to see a prompt for me to activate it that I find that its still calling itself the student version.

Ive reinstalled it several times and it wont help.
Ive even gone as far as getting rid of every trace of all Autodesk software on my computer (including all registry files i could find) and it still finds a way to make itself the student copy.

The usual (legit) method of license transfer doesnt work for this case as far as I know.

Any ideas????"
,man-united,2011-10-21T18:36Z,"no joke-this does not work-it is not possible to activate the software.
 remove your torrent - manunited"
,man-united,2011-10-21T18:48Z,"Do not load the torrent waste of time it can not be activated, it's jokes
 Greetings manunited or chris ?????"
,man-united,2011-10-21T18:52Z,chris-check yourself before if it works before you put your torrent - manunited
,man-united,2011-10-21T18:57Z,"charge is not the torrent. activation does not work!
 Chris - it's not fair play
 manunited"
,pacoron43,2011-11-04T23:32Z,"Ok, it is working perfectly.
Took me a while to figure out everything, so here it goes:
When you download it, you need winrar of course to descompress the invpro_x32.rar in another folder inside your computer, here youll get a folder with a invpro_x32.iso file in it, youll need to download Daemon Tools to mount this iso into the drive, NOTE: it does not work with another mounter like PowerIso. After doing this youll be installing the program, install it and when its done, just run the program, youll get a msg to activate the product, just click on activate click on license agreement, and click on activate online, after this it will tell you that your serial is wrong, just click on close and this window will promt again, click on activate again, uncompress the keygen on your desktop, NOTE: VERY IMPORTANT!! right click the Keygen and go to properties/compability/And run as an administrator, (if you dont do this it wont work), ok now select I have an activation code from Autodesk open the keygen, click on Mem Patch (you should see successfully patched).
Copy the request code into the keygen and press generate. 
Now copy the activation code back to the activation screen and click Next.

Another choice:
You can download the trial version from autodesk main website, Install using as Serial 666-69696969, 667-98989898, 400-45454545 .. or anything matching those templates.
Use as Product Key 208D1 
If you want to install Inventor Professional 2012 use the product key 797D1, and follow the same steps.

Working Perfectly, Ty Chris-Aksel, Next time better instructions plz."

,ClappingWalrus,2012-05-20T16:37Z,"The installer completes, but tells me it couldn't install anything.
I have downloaded and installed the hotfix patch.
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the hotifx patch.
I have downloaded the torrent 2 times already.
I have run setup as Administrator.
I have used the other serial numbers.
I just can't get past the initial installation.
Everything CAN install (The check marks were white), but it just CAN'T.
I'm running a genuine version of Windows Vista Home Premium (32-Bit).
Can anyone help? I simple suggestion on how to fix this would help.
I need this for a 200 point project in class."
