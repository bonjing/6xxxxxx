These are the early documentaries and experimental works by the japanese avant-garde director Toshio Matsumoto most known for one of his three feature films: Funeral Parade of Roses, which was a great source of inspiration to Stanley Kubrick for A Clockwork Orange.
The three documentaries here are lacking subtitles so IF YOU UNDERSTAND JAPANESE OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES, PLEASE TRANSLATE THESE AND PUT THE TRANSLATIONS ON THE INTERNET (or even make subtitle files, if you have time). If you do this, please post a comment. I would be very grateful.
