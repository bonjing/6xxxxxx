"You Bury Other Things Too"

Sophia (Laura Innes) and the other Sleepers 
mourn their losses after negotiations are 
derailed. While observing Simon's (Ian 
Anthony Dale) reaction to the events, 
Sterling (eljko Ivanek) begins to doubt 
his loyalties and devises a test. President 
Martinez (Blair Underwood) tasks Senator 
Catherine Lewis (guest star Virginia 
Madsen, "Sideways") with rooting out any 
other moles within the White House. 
Elsewhere, Sean (Jason Ritter) and Vicky 
(Taylor Cole) are on the verge of tracking 
down Dempsey (guest star Hal Holbrook, 
"Water for Elephants"), but it may be 
exactly what he was anticipating.

Enjoy :)
