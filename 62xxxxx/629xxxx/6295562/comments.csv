That's right, im ungrateful that your uploading because if you weren't uploading I'm sure someone with a bit of sense will upload proper 720p in actual mkv or avi files.

If your not going to do it properly then don't do it at all."
,daleangus,2011-04-05T15:27Z,This is sick!!! why waste your and our time RARing an MKV file????  Just upload it plain and simple!!!
,ozonaise,2011-04-05T18:17Z,"only one 720p release in 28 bloody rars! man, whats wrong with you?"
,aka_NL,2011-04-05T18:31Z,"Are you guys just dumb or just noobs?

These are the scene rar files.
That = how the rippers give them 2 the uploaders.
 So he's not stealing the files. 
He gets them from a/the source.
Uploads them to 2 different sites, this being one of them , the other a server link site.(i'll won't bother giving you the name,, figure it out!)
+ ez = not doing that great in the 720 section if you have not noticed, so STFU and say thank you 2 him or you won't be getting any 720 eps at all.

THANKS sceneline for your effort I'll do my best helping it seed."
,tiss2,2011-04-05T21:02Z,thanks again for another fast download!

Hey have you been living under a rock for the pass, umm 20 years? 
No source would give there uploaders rar anymore. RAR was used during the usenet period where the majority of people had dial up. 
Maybe you can try get your facts straight before arguing? "
,aka_NL,2011-04-19T02:40Z,"YuMaNuMa
you just might want 2 do the same with facts before you start making claims about what a source would pass on.

So you just confirmed 2 everybody here that you are a Noob and a dumb one 2.

I do have a great idea for you. If you don't like the upload, then don't download it.
try Google but please stop commenting for attention or trying 2 be smart."

Feel free to GTFO.

Thanks to sceneline."
