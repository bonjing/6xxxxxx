I have tried to include here all the retail Doom WAD files to date (including the famous Master Levels and No Rest For The Living) and I have thrown in Heretic and Hexen as an added bonus.

IMPORTANT!

The files PSXMUSIC.WAD, d2_nrftl.wad, psxDoom.wad and MASTERS.WAD are all designed to be used with the sourceports ZDoom (http://zdoom.org/Download) or GZDoom (http://www.osnanet.de/c.oelckers/gzdoom/download.html) and likely will not work properly with anything else.

Likewise, the files d2_nrftl.wad, psxDoom.wad and MASTERS.WAD are all designed to be used with the file PSXMUSIC.WAD and without it the music and sky textures in those maps will be missing.

Loading and running all these things together can be made very simple with a front-end launcher like Unleashed (http://vb6.martin2k.co.uk/exes/unleashed.php) or ZDL3.1a (http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~chiry/doom/zdl/).

ENJOY!
