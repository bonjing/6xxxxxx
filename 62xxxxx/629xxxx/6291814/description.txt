Blood of The Sun is an American band playing mix of 70' classic hard rock/heavy prog a la Deep Purple mark II, Uriah Heep, Lucifer's Friend, Bloodrock and Atomic Rooster (tasty guitar riffs, fantastic real Hammond B3 organ soloing, good melodies) and Stoner rock (especially vocals). They usually play quite long 5-8 minutes songs with long organ/guitar soloing. The most important bandmate in Blood of the Sun is their organist/pianist Dave Gryder who previously played in symphonic prog group Covenent (already on PA) and heavy prog Storm At Sunrise.
