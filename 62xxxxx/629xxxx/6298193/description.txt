         It rivaled ancient Egypt but was lost to history. Now a       
         team of archeologists have made a major discovery in the      
         Syrian desert: artifacts from a burial chamber deep within    
         an ancient palace that paint a never-before-seen picture      
         of a powerful metropolis known as Qatna. What became of       
         its vast riches? And what brought about the final fate of     
          this ancient superpower?
