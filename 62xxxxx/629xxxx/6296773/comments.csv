,MtnWalker,2011-05-03T03:31Z,Thank you for this devrimCHE and all your other fantastic uploads. I like the full DVDs that you are releasing. People should be patient about the upload speed - what is the hurry?
,devrimCHE,2011-05-08T21:20Z,"MtnWalker, thanx, friend. If only I had a bit more upload speed! Different (yet similar) things are still waiting. Another one is coming tonight, for which I'm already late. Cherish it bro/sis."

But eventually I ended up stockpiling this torrent  'cause I couldn't find any other active way to download it. "
