,Asher_jk,2011-09-07T09:07Z,Something's fishy here.. All good comments and he's got a green skull too but -38 in the quality.. Looks like a murky plot :) Downloading it as I trust the others.
,Asher_jk,2011-09-07T18:30Z,Damn good print.. A/V -10/10. Couldn't ask for a better version in such a small size.. rest all are in 1 G man.. Many thansk 20-40.. Cool name by the way.. The only reason I can think it has received so many -ve is people 'somehow' mistook it for the +ve :D
