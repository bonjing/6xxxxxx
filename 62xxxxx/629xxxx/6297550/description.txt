First of all, to make sharing possible even over shitty bit torrent trackers like TPB, you have to SEED.
 
This is a corporate installation with a modified kernel so that installation to a USB drive is possible. It is the latest SP3 version of Microsoft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s ultra fine XP OS. 


Directions for retards:

     1. Obtain Active@ ISO Burner freeware or any other image burning software. 

     2. Burn the extracted image file from the .RAR parts.

     3. Format your favorite flash drive as a NTFS partition. (At least 4.0 GB 

     required)


     3. Change boot order in BIOS (Old) to boot from CD drive first.

     4. Set up BIOS to work with flash drive as a HDD or bootable device.

     5. If not formatted you can format the flash drive in Windows Setup. 



VOILA. Reboot & Enjoy. Clean & upped by sel1x1r. REMEMBER TO SEED BITCHES!
