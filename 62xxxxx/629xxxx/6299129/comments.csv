could you please reupload your Eufrat sets as listed in text file included with the torrent 

thepiratebay.org/torrent/6292475/Eufrat_-_seductress.rar

F-------- seems to have deleted the files wholesale. And I was in the middle of DLing them.

Thank you.

It seems they did that yesterday afternoon. I was DLing from them until about 4 pm, then the files would start and then stop for no reason. After a while I gave up. Then today... gone.

I'll get them from monday onwards because I'm off for the weekend, fri-sun.

Thanks a whole bunch.
