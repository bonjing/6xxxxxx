After installing 1.2.7 patch I went into the ""update from 1.00 to 1.19 worldwide"" (Which is miss-leading as well since the earliest patch in there is the 1.4.3 patch) Well I can't find the patch thats supposed to come after 1.2.7 but before 1.4.3  I can't continue after the first patch without it. Its patch 1.3.24 i guess, may be more"
,uberknight72,2011-04-05T23:05Z,"Nevermind, i found the patch needed from another torrent.  But get that fixed so you don't get bitched at later.
Here is the URL just in case if you want to borrow the file from him to make yours complete.

Yes its the 1.3.24.

Also the 1.2.7 patch is in the main archive, not in a folder. I just skipped the 1.3.24 by accident."
