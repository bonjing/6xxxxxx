Product Description
Exam Day! Paper Due! HELP!!!!!!!

I didn't study,
I don't test well,
My coach says it's OK,
AND...
I'm a total loser.
BESIDES...
Everybody cheats,
I have A.D.D.,
The teacher sucks,
My parents are getting divorced,
AND...
I don't need to know this stuff for real life.

AVOID:
Poor grades
Flunking out
Unemployment
Moving back in with Mom
CHEAT!
