,darkfreedom,2011-05-01T06:45Z,"Good audio, 6
Video is good at the beginning (6) but then about 1/3 into the movie it seems like the camera zoomed in a bit and no one fixed it so a lot is missed visually..."

,noobsybot,2011-05-31T17:49Z,"Well guys I must tell you if you cleaned it up...wow it must have been unwatchable! I have watched worse but holy shit this is up there with them. Dark, Pixelated, and then there is the Flicker yep you were right sure is there! 
Will give ya credit for cleaning it up...guess you can only do so much. It is bad...but still better than paying $70 bloody dollars for your family! Thanks mate Free is free and it is what it is! "
