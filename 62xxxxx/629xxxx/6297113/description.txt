NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Hop 2011

Right we were kindly sent this by our good friend and said we'd give it a bash....
Sources was cammed at a angle and also had a low res and was dull....and the worse thing
was a mad flicker.
For this we had to rotate the video and then pull the left side in a bit to level it out,also we
had to use our special filters which no one else uses and we even wrote to sony and got the ok from them 
that this will work on everyones Ps3 

Ok we lied a little ....we used the standard filters and plugins that come from vdub and avisynth and no 
we don't know if it works on a ps3 as we don't own one so 
The flicker is still there so please don't go by the screenies,but we did manage to tone it down alot without 
wrecking the video.
