,NIELSTANK,2011-04-06T22:27Z,"It took alot of restarts but eventually it worked for me i just had to use this:

http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/validatenow.aspx

and after that it sais Windows Activated :D so ty daz, hopefully it wont say it isnt legit after a couple of days ;D"
,SirAnthrax,2011-04-22T07:30Z,"I've reinstalled Windows 7 Ultimate x64 three days ago, also did all the updates to this date (except the KB..033 one). I got a message saying I have to activate in 27 days. So my question is:

Will this work on Windows 7 SP1 with all updates (2011/04/22)?"
,SirAnthrax,2011-04-22T18:58Z,"Never mind, it worked. Haven't tested it via the ""validate online"" but it says genuine so I don't mind."
