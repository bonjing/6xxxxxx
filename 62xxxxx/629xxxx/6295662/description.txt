StoryLine: 
*********

This is the story of a little penguin named Mumble who has a terrible singing 
voice and later discovers he has no Heartsong. However, Mumble has an astute 
talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap 
dancing. Though Mumble's mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, 
his dad, Memphis, says it "just ain't penguin." Besides, they both know that, 
without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, 
his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria 
have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange 
"hippity- hoppity" ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the 
Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the 
community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly 
un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos.
