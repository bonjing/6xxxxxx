A guide to getting the most out of your first job from America's #1 twentysomething career columnist There are plenty of good books offering recent college grads advice on how to write the perfect resume and how to ace the interview. Yet, amazingly, until now, there were none that focused on what they should do once they landed the job, or how to use that first, menial position as the springboard to bigger and better things. Written by a successful 20-something, for 20-somethings, I Went to College for This? is a breezy, informative guide to navigating the sometimes tricky, often confusing career paths open to those just breaking into the real world of work. In I Went to College for This? 

author Amy Joyce uses the real-life anecdotes of dozens of postgrads from across North America to inspire and inform readers on how to make the most of those early dues-paying jobs. From how to talk to your boss, to managing office romances, to knowing when to quit, she offers young readers expert advice and guidance on how to transform the jobs they have into the careers they want.
