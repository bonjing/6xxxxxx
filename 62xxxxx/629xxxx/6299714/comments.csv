One question, anyone know where I can find more keys for this program? I tried installing on a second computer and the keys where no longer valid...

Thanks"

(Torrent DOES have a worm, detected by Eset Nod32 Antivirus with current virus database, removed by quarantine, program installs fine after quarantine).

If your anti-virus does NOT pick up the infection.... you're in trouble. otherwise, you're fine.
