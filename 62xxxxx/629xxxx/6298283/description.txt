Deep Purple's mark 2 final effort!Battles rages on deserves the 5 stars for two reasons:some of the songs-Lick it up,Talk about love, Time to kill might be just good and always pleasant to listen to but some other songs like the groovy RAMSHACKLE MAN, SOLITAIRE, ANYA, THE BATTLE RAGES ON, ONE MAN'S MEAT are some the best songs of mark 2 reunion.I really believe this album is as good as PERFECT STRANGERS, it just didn't come out as such a surprise!
The second reason why this album deserves 5 stars is probably because being aware of the fact that Blackmore wasn't going to surprise us anymore with DP, he left the band not long after which gave a enormous rebound to DP's carreer and this might not sound like a good reason to buy this album but it is in fact!BATTLE RAGES ON is Blackmore's ultimate legacy to all purple fans and the last notes on this album might be the very last he created for DP and we should really enjoy them!
