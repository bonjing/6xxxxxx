"Last Dance"

When Josh Peyton (Paul McCrane) has a mental 
breakdown and is charged with breaking and 
entering, and assault, Harry (Kathy Bates) 
comes to his defense. Meanwhile Adam (Nate 
Corddry) and Rachel (Jordana Spiro) 
reluctantly team up to represent death row 
inmate Brian Jones (Quintin Aaron) only to 
realize that his appeal may be jeopardized 
by a clerical error. Back at the shoe 
store, Jenna (Brittany Snow) and Malcolm's 
(Aml Ameen) relationship is tested when 
they have their first argument.

Enjoy :)
