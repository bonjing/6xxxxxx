*SPOILER ALERT LOL*

-it's basically a video version of Encylopaedia Dramatica's Offended page (google it if you haven't seen it). I just stopped watching after 10 mins or so, much of it is just still photos, and as I say if you've seen Offended most of this will not be news to you.

However there may actually be some rare clips (probably censored or not shown in civilized society) that are of political and historical interest, like the hanging of Saddam Hussein, and the actual video of the death of Nguyá»…n VÄƒn LÃ©m. I couldn't actually be bothered watching the whole vid (seriously a lot of it is recycled ED stuff) but those two came up, if you're interested. 

Not particularly disturbing for any veteran anon but this WILL LEAVE NORMAL PEOPLE WITH MENTAL SCARS."
,Arbitex,2011-04-08T15:25Z,"Ah sorry by ""Nguyá»…n VÄƒn LÃ©m"" I meant that Korean(?) dude who was famously photographed getting shot in the head by a police chief during the war there. Damn asian letters."
,KILL4SATAN,2011-04-08T21:05Z,The quality the content is presented in is what makes this video so terrible. I don't recommend wasting your time downloading this piece of shit. The worst are the shitty watermarked .gif images that are added into the video.
,cordpop,2011-04-08T23:32Z,"Despite the negative review, I thought it was fairly good. 

And from what I've heard this is the leaked WORK IN PROGRESS  video. So yeah it repeats. Is this like a home made video or an actual production?

Anyways, some images are watermarked but I didn't mind at all. It's like watching TV with a CBS/NBC logo on the corner.

Anyways, there is Slides and Video/Gifs in this which make a good variety. I say watch some of it, but the fact that this is not the real full version is kinda disappointing. All in all, most of the entire video is here."
,sissor,2011-04-27T09:53Z,@Arbitex - Offended page doesn't seem to exist anymore unfortunately. ED = some new shit website. Unless someone archived the offended page?
