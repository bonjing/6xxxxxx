,justregged,2011-04-05T20:31Z,"My favorite horror bar none is the ring.
Other ones i really like are frontiers, the exorcism of emily rose, the strangers, drag me to hell, the evil dead.

Funny games U.S is a fucked up movie as is blue velvet although neither of these are horror movies.

And martyrs is the most disturbing movie i have ever seen! Im not recommending it though, you have been warned."
