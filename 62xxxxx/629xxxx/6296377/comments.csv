It was released on April 1, 2011 in North America and Europe by Summit Entertainment.

Plot

Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a decorated army helicopter pilot whose last memory is of his recent mission in Afghanistan, flying with his team while taking on enemy gunfire. He awakens on a train headed for Chicago with no memory of how he arrived there. His reflection is of a different man and his wallet says his name is Sean Fentress. Sitting across from him is a pretty woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him as Fentress. But before he can understand what is happening, a bomb goes off and destroys the train."

,jiveclive,2011-04-05T15:25Z,"I can't find the torrent for this movie where one user complained about the plot holes. There are no plot holes. Source Code is a plot whole, but one so massive that we can't see the whole, only sections and that's why there appear to be holes. "
,hirans1,2011-04-05T15:43Z,Seems like a TS (Not Cam).  Not bad quality (for TS).  V 6 A 7
,Chadly,2011-04-05T15:50Z,sample barely works but if the movie looks like that then its terrible. Not worth wastiing your time and if you pay for bandwith def not worth wasting your money.
