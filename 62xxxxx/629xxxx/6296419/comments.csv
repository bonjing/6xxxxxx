,Jasko66,2011-04-13T14:22Z,"Yiffy - firsz thanx for your great effort!
Now - my question . Some of your movies plays well in my LG BD570, some won't? Are all your mkv movies encoded equally and are the tags in header files always the same in all your movies?
Sorry, but english is not my native language, i hope you have understand my question...
It's quite not understandable to me, why some mkv movies from you plays well, some won't in my player, even if i make constantly firmware update on my Blu-ray player...
Anyway, thank you very much for your great work and all your effort...
Greetings!"
