I Have To Come To The Defense Of This Album, The Music Is So Atmospheric And Moody And Full Of Heavy Synthesizers, It Is A Journey Of Sounds And Rhythms That Has To Be Heard, Most Of The Album Has Sparse Lyrics, Only Four Tracks Have Any Lyrics:

Sexcrime (1984).
For The Love Of Big Brother.
Doubleplusgood.
Julia.

The Rest Are Instrumentals With Annie Chanting And Vocalizing With Her Voice Becoming Truly Another Instrument, With An Occasional Muttering Of A Word Or Two.
'Doubleplusgood' Is Fun But Silly And Although I've Always Loved 'Sex Crime (1984)' It's Not Among The
Gems Of The Album. 'For The Love Of Big Brother' Is Really A Cool And Icy Track And 'Room 101' Is A Thundering Soundscape, But The Balled 'Julia' Is The Star, One Of The Most Beautiful And Loneliest Songs Ever Heard. 

This album would, if it had been produced in the mid to late 90's, have rivaled Nine Inch Nails' "Downward Spiral" for it's sheer intensity. It is original and came before it's time. It is dark, it is moody, but it has a passion that only Eurythmics could have given it. You probably need to be a major fan or a lover of experimental music to get into this album. But after searching for several years now for this album on CD...(and having been told that is was out of print and would not be reissued)...I am now a happy man.
