Dr_Maxwell presents...\\\"The Oak\\\" in HD!

Conan the Barbarian has not yet been released commercially in HD format because Universal owns the picture rights to the original franchise and you all know what happened to HD-DVD...

So I bring you one of the only existing copies of Conan the Barbarian in HD format; here\\\'s what it looks like for all of you wondering:
