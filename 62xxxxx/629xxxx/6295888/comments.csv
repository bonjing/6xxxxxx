Is there a version in 1080p?
Cheers"
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-05T09:47Z,The highest quality I have is the copy uploaded here; there is supposedly a Blu Ray version coming out around the same time as the new 3D remake of the film this year. 
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-05T09:55Z,I just hope everyone enjoys this copy and seed at least to equal ratio if you like it!
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-05T10:47Z,"I've also added the HD version of Conan The Destroyer, which wasn't up over here:

Let me know what you think please!"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-05T12:36Z,"the blu-ray comes in july, so in 3 months this torrent will be redundant."
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-05T12:54Z,"Good Films - Yeah, I knew that before I uploaded this but I figured some people would want to watch an HD version before the new version is released. Furthermore, there wasn't an HD copy of either Conan The Barbarian or Conan The Destroyer on the bay so I took the initiative and uploaded my copies.

No doubt people will get the higher quality HD version once a better quality source presents itself, but until then many people have started downloading my copies.

On a side note, love your ups mate they are always top quality and thanks for the comment."
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-05T13:08Z,"Oh one thing that might have been overlooked, this version is uncut; it includes the sex scene with the witch and the scene with horses, which unfortunately the blu-ray in July looks like it won't include."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-05T13:17Z,the bluray release will most likely be uncut.
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-05T14:00Z,Well hopefully they will be but we'll just have to wait and see ^_^
,AusMakka,2011-04-07T07:44Z,Cheers for the upload and the effort putting up a HD version. 
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-07T11:19Z,"Thanks mate, there will be a couple of Blu-ray copies coming out in July, which will be of much higher quality so keep an eye out!"
,pilot12,2011-04-10T15:18Z,"Thanks dude.

Just a reminder: when a new higher resolution and better quality comes out, you can delete your own torrent(s).

So that it is no longer redundant.

This movie is great but what is greater is the score music. Awesome. It brings inside me so much feelings, so many memories.

Basil Poledouris has performed a great job.

,polish_psycho,2011-04-10T21:24Z,THX
,Dr_Maxwell,2011-04-14T14:18Z,"@pilot12 I wholeheartedly agree, the OST to this classic is one of the best ever created! I have a copy of the OST with the unreleased tracks as well."
,sxolio,2011-05-05T13:56Z,"Very good stuff,thank you very much!!!"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-06-30T12:56Z,"thx Dr_Maxwell

By the way I doubt that the bluray will have much better picture quality. Just ignore the twats. Cool upload.
