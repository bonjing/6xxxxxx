And WTF is with the guy saying this game is for console, its PC."
,RapierApe,2011-04-28T03:54Z,"Wow awesome, thanks. 

I didn't play Blood back in the day, heck I didn't even know about it. Sometime last year I got to play it on dosbox and thought it was awesome. I couldn't find Blood 2 anywhere at the time. Just happened to see this now.

Again, thanks."
