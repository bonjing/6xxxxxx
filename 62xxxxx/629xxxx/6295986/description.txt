"Everything's Different, Nothing's Changed"

Paul Young stands in the way of Susan getting her 
much-needed kidney transplant; Lynette is furious 
with Tom when he passes up a lucrative job 
opportunity in order to continue working with Carlos 
out of friendship; Bree becomes concerned over 
Andrew's escalating alcohol consumption; and Gaby is 
shocked when Renee continues as planned with her 
neighborhood party after the tragic suicide attempt 
of one of Wisteria Lane's residents.

Enjoy :)
