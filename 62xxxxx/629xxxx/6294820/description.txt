Windows Loader v1.9.9
***********************

About:
*****

This is the loader application that's used by millions of people worldwide, well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.

    -Add your own certificates and serials externally
    -Offers certificate and serial installation only for users with an existing SLIC 2.1
    -Automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)
