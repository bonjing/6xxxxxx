,zorky,2011-09-23T02:34Z,I hope FoW players helps to seed this!
,onett_home,2012-01-31T06:01Z,Thank you so much for seeding this. I have no idea why they charge so much for the books.
,onett_home,2012-02-08T09:36Z,Any chance we'll see 3rd edition?
,OmniJackal,2012-03-16T12:38Z,I managed to find the Red Bear book but not the Gray Wolf one. How can I get Red Bear to you so you can add it to the release?
