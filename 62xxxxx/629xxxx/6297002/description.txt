IMDb Info


In October 2005, five young people were kidnapped in the Highlands of Scotland. Stripped and abandoned in the 
the wilderness, they were forced into a deadly game where the hunters became the hunted. Their ordeal was 
filmed by an extreme animal rights group as a warning to others: if you hunt... you're fair game. Combining 

dramatic reconstruction and compelling interviews with the survivors, BLOODED finally tells the full story 
behind one of the most extreme internet virals of modern times.
