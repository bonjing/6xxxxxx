Upgrade over existing 64-bit version failed. The menu did offer choice between 32 and 64-bit versions yet installation failed minutes later with a message that you can't upgrade a 64-bit version to a 32-bit one. 

What's the point of sharing the same old version without updates and even lie about the contents? "

YOU SHOULD REALLY REMOVE THE $OEM$ SUBFOLDER FROM THE SOURCES FOLDER!!!!!!!!!!

Otherwise the $OEM/$$/Setup/Script/setupcomplete.cmd starts on the end of the setup and installs what seems like mallware to me...
