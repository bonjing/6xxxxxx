Delta Force 2 (c) by Novalogic.
..::UNRAR & PLAY!::..
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the original Delta Force, you played as a soldier in the US Army's elite commando and counterterrorist military force. The game overcame its graphical shortcomings by delivering top-notch action in both single- and multiplayer modes. Apparently NovaLogic was willing to bet on the same horse again, as Delta Force 2 uses yet another voxel-based graphics engine, but like its predecessor, its gameplay is good enough to buoy its less-than-stellar visuals.

Delta Force 2 offers around 45 single-player missions, including 25 sorties split between two campaigns and 20 stand-alone scenarios, in which you must prove yourself against large and heavily armed terrorist armies. In most cases, you'll work alone or with a handful of computer-controlled support teams. Most scenarios involve a clandestine attack-and-destroy mission against enemy bases, though many also include hostage rescue, recovery of stolen assets, and other commando-style objectives. The game also contains a powerful mission editor that lets you craft complex scenarios with relative ease and even provides thorough documentation for 
it.
