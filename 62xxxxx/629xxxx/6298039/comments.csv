,muk0690,2011-04-08T18:56Z,@maraizen: I am not telling that his works are not good. I am just saying that this piece is worser than a dvdrip.
,shinobiXRT,2011-05-09T13:46Z,its impossible that this can be a 1280 x 576 res for 206 mins or even 100mins

,OTKnights,2012-01-28T02:25Z,"Don't download this unless you're deaf, the idiot who uploaded this torrent hard coded the subtitles. Only download if you don't mind subs or if you're blind or something. "
,ali64iust,2012-02-04T08:52Z,"YIFY is one of best up-loader but this time Audio is too bad. 
sounds is not clear."
,fragomatic,2012-02-19T08:39Z,"A 10/10 
V 10/10 (3.5 hours and only 694mb! EPIC!)
M 15/10 (The best movie I've ever seen!)

Very good English subtitles. It makes it easy to fallow the old British English!

Thanks a million!"
,Spudgun17,2012-04-24T09:28Z,"A/V 10. Thanks YIFY, and thank-you Pirate Bay for free stuff!"
