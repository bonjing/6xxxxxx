,GMDFUCKU,2011-04-05T21:34Z,gave some error while installing -.-
,karel2032,2011-04-06T11:24Z,"Aight, didnt actually check the DVD, noobish of me. Anyway, I like bridge building games, and would love a more graphic version, but not at the cost of the underlying physics. Maybe it's me but the physics seem extremely weird, things that would work in other bridgebuilders instantly collapse here...

Also, there appear to be some bugs that often won't allow you to make links between two sections, even while the sections are available and not crossing other sections etc."
[T],FatFreddy756,2011-04-07T01:04Z,"this game is pretty cool :)
although im stuck on the medium 1 level, i have no idea how the hydraulic pulls are supposed to work and ive tried everything. very irritating. hahah

,kabduk,2011-04-07T18:09Z,"This game runned successfully for me
my set ups and installation procedures
windows 7 Home basic
1. open the first file in the download folder using winrar, it will make folder pm-btcg.
2. Download Daemontool from Filehippo.com or from anyother website, install deamon tool, and mount the image from the foldr ""pm-btcg""
3. it will prompt u to install the game. and install the game using the activation code BRR-394-23242-N6475-69437.
4. Once installation is over , aerosoft launcher gonna pop. do nothing with that, just close it
5. open the new virtual drive on the computer, right click and open it, and u can see a folder postmortem, copy all the files in it and replace it with files in installed directory (eg:C:\ToxSickLabs\Bridge) .
6. From the desktop u can open the Bridge game, which is in yellow colour symbol. and game will succefully play
7. another problem which occured to me is blinkering of the game. i solved it by switching off the ful screen option, from menu-options-graphics-full screen. 
8. For me   resolution of 800* 600  worked well and gud.
9. Game is a simulation, gud for civil engineers, i am mechanical engineer, i liked it, it can be enjoyed by anybody, i suggest a 20 plus age guys can enjoy this well.
10. Enjoy"

The game sometimes works... but most of the time I cannot join sections. A good waste of time, but the game doesn't work. It's broken."
,rubberturtle,2012-06-20T06:15Z,"@tuttu81
I get the same problem! Your not alone with that one. "
,Ignored,2012-06-20T19:59Z,"@LymphN0de @Rubberturtle @tuttu81

For all of you with GRAPHIC CARD ERROR in the Startup process of the game. 

I may have a solution worth testing:

If you use Nvidia:
1. Open up your Nvidia-settings
2. Go to: Adjust 3D-settings
3. Open up the tab ""Software Settings""
4. Add ""Bridge"" from your installation directory (eg: C:ProgramBridge)
5. **Save** and close Nvidia-settings

Please leave a comment if it solved the problem!
Good Luck!"
