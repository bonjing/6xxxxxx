Amazing Fantasy 15

With issue #15 (Aug. 1962) Amazing Adult Fantasy was renamed Amazing Fantasy[4] and slated for cancellation. With nothing to lose, publisher Martin Goodman agreed to allow Lee to introduce Spider-Man, a new kind of superhero â€” one who would be a teenager, but not a sidekick, and one who would have everyman doubts, neuroses and money problems.[5] Sales for Amazing Fantasy #15 proved to be one of Marvel's highest at the time and The Amazing Spider-Man was quickly launched to capitalize on the new character's apparent popularity.[6] Although the interior artwork was by Steve Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Jack Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.
