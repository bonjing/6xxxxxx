,Uncle_Fuzzy,2011-07-06T00:42Z,"@Chemtrack 
*looking to see what you have posted*
Well, surprise, surprise!  You've posted NOTHING. This no doubt is what gives you license to criticize so uncivilly.  Beware the Just."
,Redt0rrent,2011-07-31T11:19Z,Any screens on the quality? Will download just to see.
,LinuxxxUser,2011-08-10T23:26Z,Come on ... Seed please. I'm downloading with 8kb/s and uploading with almost 10x the download speed.
,h4ckerman,2011-10-28T16:04Z,The quality isnt good....Better BDrip
,bonkai,2011-12-20T15:32Z,Quality us good. Well worth the download. 
,MacrosBlack,2012-01-04T05:33Z,Great quality.   Awesome series too.
,polarbearable,2012-02-01T04:43Z,"Thank you rosie1966.
The quality is only going to be as good as one can expect from a 350MB (per episode) .avi file. To all the nuff-nuffs above who have complained about the quality, download the 1080p HD version (which is still compressed). It's only a 276GB download. Or just go out and buy the DVDs. Do you nuff-nuffs have any idea how much time and effort it takes to organize a torrent of this size?"
,virulient,2012-02-07T08:52Z,"Do you have any idea how big of a faggot you have to be to call people ""nuff-nuff's""? It's rhetorical....everyone knows. By the way the quality , ironically enough, sucks dick."
