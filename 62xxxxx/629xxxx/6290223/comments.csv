Revision 4.1 is now complete. This is TRUELY the FINAL release of the compilation! I consider this a ""masterpiece"". Hope you all enjoy it!

Revision 4.01 will no longer be available.

What has changed:
â€¢WAVEBLST.ZIP renamed to WB_R2.ZIP
â€¢WB_R3.ZIP added... revision 3 Wave Blaster (CT1900) disk
â€¢WAVEBLST directory updated to have revision 3 drivers
â€¢True SB16 MCD disks added. The MCD*.IMZ files in all earlier releases have now been renamed to SCSI94*.IMZ.
â€¢Vibra 16 version 1.01 disks added.
â€¢Vibra 16S disks added.
â€¢Blaster CD-RW 4224 version 1.36 firmware removed to make 500KB space in order to make the ISO overburnable onto a 700MB CD-R. IMO nobody will miss this because version 1.44 firmware is still in the ISO. No point using an outdated/buggy firmware.
â€¢Several SF2s zipped to make 2MB more space

ISO is 722MB, the maximum possible for a 700MB Taiyo Yuden CD-R. It may work with other CD-R media, but it is up to you to determine compatibility. Always use simulation mode first before trying on other media. If it errors, then you know it won't work!

Actual data contained is 777MB.
