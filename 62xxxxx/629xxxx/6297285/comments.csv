,aarque,2011-04-06T06:48Z,"Always nice to search before uploading redundant software:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4141230/FSX_-_Lord_Howe_X_%28Scenery%29_As_requestet
Good ol Papazoff

On the other hand, his has 1 seeder and yours has 23 and by comments like joseph, no one even bothers running a search these days:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3825840/ALPHA_FSX_SR-71.rar
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5623564/FSX_-_Just_Flight_F-117_Nighthawk
(There's two of 'em for ya son. Didn't want to spoon feed you, just prove it is scientifically possible to find your own warez.)"
,Jimstalk,2011-04-06T15:32Z,"@aarque

The previous torrent has no seeders for almost a year.Personally i think that Lord Hove island is  one of the the BEST addons aerosoft ever made.This torrent may exist at TPB but its ""dead"".Thanks rawpower!

@IamRAwPoWEr2
**The way you write the description (no offence) is similar to mahekun's64.Hope youre not this little bastard....."
,aarque,2011-04-06T16:15Z,"yes Jim, it is deplorable how little initiative is demonstrated here. I find it nearly impossible to understand how people can run a search for FSX software then only populate the results found on the first page - it is almost staggering. Whittman Tailwind, Hughes Racer and Junkers W-33 are three titles I can think of off the top of my head that have disappeared from TPB.

Still, it is the responsibility of those of us who understand the system to coax newcomers to  preserve it and use it efficiently.

Also Jim, If you like Aerosoft Lord Howe and ORBX, you should explore and apply the compatibility fix described at the FTX site and if you likeAero's Lord Howe you will probably also like Helgoland."
,IamRAwPoWEr2,2011-04-07T05:01Z,"@aarque yes i know, i should have searched BUT. does it have seeds? :) but yes. THANKS FOR THE NIGHTHAWK"
,IamRAwPoWEr2,2011-04-07T05:03Z,"@Jimstalk wellp, thanks anyway jimstalk XD"
,IamRAwPoWEr2,2011-04-07T05:05Z,@joshep5o5 those are a lot of requests :P but i'll keep them in mind :)
,IamRAwPoWEr2,2011-04-07T05:06Z,"@aarque last time i checked the seeders there was hardly any, but thanks for the heads up :)"
,vladwolf,2011-04-07T12:58Z,Thanks for the up!
