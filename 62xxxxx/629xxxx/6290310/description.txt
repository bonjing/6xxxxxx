Storyline:


Jack is caught with the wife of his employer, a Vegas thug. The thug sends goons after Jack, who convinces his best friend, Pilot, to flee with him. Pilot insists that they head for Seattle, but doesn't tell Jack why. The goons learn from Pilot's drug source where the youths are headed, and they follow, hell bent on breaking Jack's feet. On the road, Jack and Pilot give a ride to Cassie, a distressed young woman. She and Jack hit it off. They pick up an aging stoner headed to Seattle for Kurt Cobain's memorial, and they help a circus sideshow family. Why is Pilot so set on Seattle, will the goons catch Jack, and is there any way the friends' competing needs can be resolved? 

Jack (Jared Leto) is a Gen-Xer with nowhere to go until he gets caught in bed with a mobster's woman. Now, with three thugs after him, he and best pal Pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) hit the road to Seattle. Along the way, they encounter sexy Cassie (Selma Blair), who decides to hitch a ride. Together, they end up on the wildest trip of their lives!
