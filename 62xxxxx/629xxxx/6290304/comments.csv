Warning! Program detected by antivirus as ""HackTool.Win32.Kiser.agl"" 
Main version: 1.1.7.30. Version of launcher: 1.3.1.15. - That is written in the Notepad (''About'') already. Important: This isn't Harmful. You should disable your Kaspersky Product before trying this, because it detects KKL as Hacktool. If you don't trust me then try it in Sandboxie before or don't use it."
