Few things in life are as reliable as a Marcia Ball performance. For more than four decades, the Louisiana-by-way-of-Texas musician has magnificently played piano and sang her way through the blues with incredible amounts of heart and soul. Ball is the real deal: equal parts New Orleans, boogie woogie, swamp music, and Texas soul all wrapped up into one package. Her new album shows that sheâ€™s also an incredible songwriter. 
Roadside Attractions marks the first time Ball has either written or co-written every cut on an album. The high quality and variety of songs presented here reveal Ballâ€™s gifted ability to create catchy licks and her talents as a firstâ€“rate observer of life. There are party songs mixed with ones that make you think, danceable beats and reflective rhythms. The tracks flow into each other to create a mighty musical force. While every song is good, the album as a whole is greater than a sum of its parts.
