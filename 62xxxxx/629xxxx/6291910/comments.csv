,bonzodog1,2011-04-04T06:02Z,Thanks!  Is this the one made in a Scandinavian country that demonstrates how that country (?Norway?) is no threat to the Japanese re:monster movies?
,bonzodog1,2011-04-05T12:51Z,Yes- Denmark! All i had to do was to look at the imdb site. I believe Cycleof7 ul'd this before suddenly disappearing last year.  This may be the only Danish monster movie ever made.  (I would hope so!)  Be well.

Thanks Bonzo!"
