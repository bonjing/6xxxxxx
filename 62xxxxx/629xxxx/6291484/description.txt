CoppÃ©lia is a classical ballet in the true sense, and with its touch of East European folklore, 
continues to enjoy worldwide popularity. 
It combines the romance between Swanilda and Franz with the story of the doll-maker Coppelius, 
whose greatest desire is to create a doll with a soul. Franz immediately falls in love with CoppÃ©lia, 
who he thinks is real, but eventually recognizes is just a doll. 
He returns to Swanilda, after which the final grand divertissement sees everyone reconciled.
