In 2008 Dr. Earnest Sternglass gave a speech on the threats caused by low-level nuclear fallout given off by nuclear power plants. And this speech had been given in Japan! But they wouldn't listen and now these fools are paying the price for their stupidity, ignorance and arrogance. But aren't we fools too?
