Francis Monkman was composer, keyboard player and guitarist with the legendary 'Curved Air' in the 1970s before joining the classically-influenced 'Sky'. He has contributed sessions to a large number of well-known artists including Kate Bush and The Alan Parsons Project.
'21st Century Blues' is a thoroughly modern and original take on progressive rock and blues.
