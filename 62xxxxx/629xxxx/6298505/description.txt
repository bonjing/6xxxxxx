Hop in your gondola, aim high and rescue the sinking buildings of Venice by restoring their lost treasures. Launch coins, lyres and rings into the matching shapes moving overhead. But beware: blocks and traps could give you a sea of troubles. Stay afloat with smart timing and nifty trick shots. Do you have what it takes to save Venice?
