Best quality I have seen of the song, performed by the original Artist, It is a Classic Icon of the mid 1960's and this rare clip was thanks to the original seeder of the Beatclub series of DVD's where this was carefully extracted, missing out the German Hosts voice.

Chris chose to mime the song, which is good as the audio is of course right off the original hit single.  Loads of crowd shots give you a real close up view of the fashion and dance styles of 1965...  Great Stuff.  It's a Classic.  Enjoy
