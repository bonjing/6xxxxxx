
Leaked chapters from the upcoming novel, Max After Earth.

"Our story begins on the 37th of August, 2032, and the asteroid Apophis is due to hit Earth at any moment. Developed and developing nations having failed to meet key targets for reducing anthropogenic emissions of pollutants, the planet is in such a state of disarray that scientists are not compelled to make an attempt at preventing the asteroid's impact. The Earth is simply not worth saving. Instead, they pool their resources and formulate a plan to evacuate themselves to the International Space Station and two other space stations--one developed by the European Union, and one developed jointly by China and Russia. They leave the rest of humanity to perish. Our protagonist, an advanced experiment in robotics named Max, struggles with the humanity his creators have infused him with. He can't sit idly by while his human companions die slowly in the aftermath of the asteroid's impact. All the while, a dead businessman foils his attempts to save the planet."
