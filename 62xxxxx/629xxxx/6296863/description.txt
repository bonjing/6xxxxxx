Custom sounds like if Beck grew up actually liking Judas Priest, and not in some hipster contrarian way, or the Beastie Boys had the musicianship of their latter material with the reckless abandon and willingness to fight for one's party of the Licensed to Ill logic. "Hey Mister," an open letter to an unfortunate father whose daughter is being schtupped by the sinning singer, sneers, "God gave her the perfect body/Now I'm all up in it." The punch line of "I hope I never have a daughter" matches the punch of the industrial-strength funk guitar riffing during the R-rated chorus (rated X as far as MTV was concerned, who banned the video clip). Some will observe that Custom (Duane Lavold is his given name) simply proffers a more diverse form of the mook rock with distinct hip-hop flavors, but Fast is more the Butthole Surfers doing "Pepper" than Limp Bizkit doing just about anything, and unintelligent rubes don't put together and play nearly everything on entire albums (with minimal contributions from some others, notably Duncan Sheik and A Perfect Circle's Billy Howerdel) in their own home studios, nor can they rhyme "excuses" with "how loose she is" and "juiciness" as he does on "Morning Spank." ~ Brian O'Neill, All Music Guide
