,udidwht,2011-04-05T06:20Z,"Thanks Epyrate

By the way the Read me for the F-14 states it's version 1.06. Did you include the newer files/update in it?"
,ePyrate,2011-04-05T06:52Z,"Your welcome!

Yes, I molded the 1.07 MDL files to this package, so it is indeed 1.07. Thanks for pointing that out!"
,ePyrate,2011-04-05T07:00Z,"Your Welcome! 

Yes, I molded the MDL files into this package, so it is actually 1.07. Thanks for pointing that out. For those who are courious: ""one of the wires in the windshield frame was misplaced in the VC and the inner geometry of the afterburner was slightly undersized (I've made no changes to the effects so far). Unless you have very bright monitor settings you are not likely to see any difference at all. Still, here they are"" Thats the difference between 1.06 and 1.07. Would have been nice to see an update to the F-35, its wrong in several espects of the real bird but I give it an 8 out of 10 for Flight Sim. "
,ePyrate,2011-04-05T07:02Z,Darn 64bit and Java....Sorry for the duplicate post!
,aarque,2011-04-05T14:13Z,"Just a thought and I don't know you're relation to the dude, but if you're going to leech his stuff and blow his horn you might want to paste a link since a Google search of his name turns up a mish mash of flight sim freeware sites and torrent trackers."
,Jimstalk,2011-04-05T14:24Z,"@ePyrate

Could u please provide a link with the product's description??"
,udidwht,2011-04-05T17:39Z,"@ Jimstalk

,udidwht,2011-04-05T17:40Z,Anyone having issue/s with the afterburner effects?
,aarque,2011-04-05T21:09Z,"...ya, found the page, udidwht. Just so we are clear, the name of the site is The Pirate Bay, not the ""Re-Post Freely Available But Otherwise Obscure Software Site,"" or is it that the search and tracker system is not already broken enough for some of us? 

Avsim, now there is a GREAT place to make an upload like this, if it hasn't already been done.

,aarque,2011-04-05T21:17Z,"It appears the F-35 is actually payware. Since udidwht's link is to his blog and it is half Italian, I have trouble understanding it, so the possibility remains that the lightning is shareware which means it would be available ""freely"" elsewhere. If it is indeed payware, as in you can't get it without paying for it, then congratulations for weeding through all that crap and bringing TPB something new."
,ePyrate,2011-04-05T22:05Z,"Fucking douchebag -  Shut the fuck up and enjoy it. Maybe people aren't aware of the addon even if it was freeware, which the F-14D is, and the F-35 is payware. I'll post what ever the fuck I want, but if your going to be ungreatfull about it maybe I wont share shit. No skin off my back you fucking un greatful tard. No respect these days. Fuck you."
,mOuse_X,2011-04-06T00:57Z,"ePyrate, many thx for your UL.
I had the v1.10 of the F35A and 'am very happy to get the v1.15! Thank you for the precise description, too."

,istrahd,2011-04-23T05:25Z,"WTF is wrong with people being a whiny little douche like aarque?  Who cares if it is available somewhere else?  I appreciate your work in finding it, packing it, seeding it.  I may never have found this, as I don't speak or read Italian.

If you have a problem with it, don't download it!  If you like/want it, download it and give the Uploader a +1.  I'm giving you the first +1 and I haven't even downloaded it yet, just because of aarque being a d!ckhead

The F-14 has always been one of my favorite planes. The sleek sihlouette with wings swept back, the most advanced combat radar of its day able to track around 30 targets and fire on about 14 almost simultaneously... It is a bad ass piece of Naval Aviation History.  It is a shame that such a marvelous aircraft has not been updated."
