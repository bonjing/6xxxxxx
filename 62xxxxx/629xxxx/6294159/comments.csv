Please use any burner software like (ashampoo burner) take direct write. do not write data format, can u use direct (create/burn disk images), its show ""disk image path"" and select image file, like *.iso, *.daa, *.img, *.cue etc. then write.

,Astatos4,2011-04-26T12:14Z,It works fine.Burn the image(.iso) to a new dvd or a flash usb and do a fresh install.All seems to work fine and fast if you consider that netbooks are pretty slow.Use also the activation tool (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6298041) that mohanz uploaded.

,GoDogGo,2011-06-12T17:39Z,works great on my netbook but I have a couple of questions. I used the activation removal tool and after restart I got a blue screen error code so I restarted again and everything seems fine. Was that supposed to happen? Also what do I need to do to get printer stuff working? Did the windows loader make it pointless to use wat remover?
