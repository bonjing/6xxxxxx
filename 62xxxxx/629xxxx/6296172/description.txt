  Lt. Paul Cutler, a Los Angeles S.W.A.T. officer, is sent to train the Detroit 
  S.W.A.T. team in new techniques. Cutler has a hard time settling into his 
  assignment as he locks horns with his new captain and encounters resistance 
  from the team he must lead. Unexpectedly, a routine hostage call turns 
  deadly, and a relentless ex-government agent named Walter Hatch vows revenge 
  on Cutler and the entire S.W.A.T. team for killing the woman he loves.
