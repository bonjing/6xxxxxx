One episode airing in February and the next in October does not sound like it's running in the same season.  TVrage or TV dot com and other sites will say it's one long season, but to me (as well as amazon dot com) an eight month time frame between episodes is the start of a new season.  Ten episodes per season, twenty episodes total, plus the newest ones currently being release which will be labeled S03.

Thank you."

If you do come across A Haunting seasons 1 -4, a upload would be great. Thanks again for all your hard work."
