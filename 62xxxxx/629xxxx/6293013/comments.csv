I want to request (with your low size high quality torrents) these tv shows if it's ok with you: Lie to me Season 3, Sherlock, Monk, Psych, Spartacus and Burn Notice..? and since it seems you can upload classics, maybe you can upload Twilight zone too? I know some were already uploaded but they are too big. Thank you very much! "
