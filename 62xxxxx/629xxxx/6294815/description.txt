Left Lane Cruiser
Junkyard Speed Ball (2011)



Specializing in a raw hillbilly punk-blues style that roars like a modal, tweaking chainsaw, Left Lane Cruiser is a two-piece band comprised of Frederick â€œJoeâ€ Evans IV on slide guitar and Brenn Beck on drums. The pair came out of Fort Wayne, IN but their sound has the swampy feel of North Mississippi hill country blues Ã  la Junior Kimbrough and R.L. Burnside, with a good dose of snarling garage punk tossed into the mix. A self-released album, Gettinâ€™ Down on It, was released on the groupâ€™s own Hillgrass Bluebilly Records in 2006, and the following year, they signed to Alive Records. Bring Yoâ€™ Ass to the Table appeared from the imprint in 2008, followed by All You Can Eat in 2009 and Junkyard Speed Ball in 2011.

Left Lane Cruiser -- a two-piece band comprised of Frederick â€œJoeâ€ Evans IV on slide guitar and vocals and Bren Beck on drums -- may be from Fort Wayne, IN but they sound like a couple of unhinged punk hillbillies raised on the North Mississippi hill country blues of R.L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough. They mine the same sort of modal blues territory but, with half-distorted vocals pushed through what sounds like a shorted-out karaoke mike, they also sound like a lo-fi swampy version of the Stooges, all full of rampaging impatience. Junkyard Speed Ball is the duoâ€™s fourth album (and third for Alive Records), and it doesnâ€™t deviate at all from the sound of their earlier releases -- this isnâ€™t a band much concerned with evolving its sound. Thatâ€™s a good thing, because they make a hell of a lot of noise and pretty much mow through every song with real rock fervor. The opener, â€œLost My Mind,â€ is absolutely visceral, and it sets the tone for the whole album -- track after track races forward with the accelerator down, and if itâ€™s sometimes hard to tell what Evans is scorching his vocal cords to say, well, itâ€™s still the blues and we all know what that means. But this isnâ€™t woe-is-me blues. Itâ€™s pissed-off blues. Song after song here clangs away at the end of the junkyard chain, riding Evans' searing, chiming modal guitar riffs and Beck's loose-limbed pounding on the drums. â€œShineâ€ gallops like a magnificent drunken plow horse, while â€œWeed Vodkaâ€ finds Evans' chiming electric guitar sounding like a clawhammer banjo run through an amp stack set on 11. Nothing is reined in here, and the accumulation of these blasts of hill country tweaks makes this a powerful album, one that replaces clarity with the sheer joy of impassioned noise -- stomp it to death seems to be the motto. Recorded by Jim Diamond (who also plays bass here on â€œRepresent,â€ while John Wesley Myers of the Black Diamond Heavies adds organ and keyboard to four songs) at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit, MI, Junkyard Speed Ball is another fine outing from a refreshingly direct and uncomplicated band that rocks like a jackhammer.
