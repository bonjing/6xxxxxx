Sorry for deleting it guys. When it said if you wanted to delete it I said no to it and it deleted it anyways! Well Here are the insturctions.


Instructions

-Download this torrent
-Have Lego Star Wars 3 and install it if you haven't already
-Open the Lucasarts folder
-Open the Lego Star Wars 3 folder
-Open the folder this torent came in
-You should see 6 files(don't include the DONT COPY THIS THOUGH word file I had to put that there)
-Copy the 6 files into the Lego Star Wars 3 folder and select copy and replace for all of them
-Start the game and enjoy!

If it says you need a key then you dragged the files to the wrong folder. You HAVE to drag the files to the Lego Star Wars folder INSIDE the Lucasarts folder.

IMPORTANT: Most anti-virus protections will think that the paul.dll is a virus. Well it's NOT. I just had to turn off real time scanning and it was fine.

Enjoy!
