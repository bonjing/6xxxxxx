,Dogger55,2011-04-08T01:47Z,Stuck at 99.8% on a torrent that was uploaded yesterday. Why even bother to upload this if you're not going to seed it properly?
,souras,2011-04-08T15:42Z,"fuckin' seed it, dammit"
,Dogger55,2011-04-10T03:11Z,"99.9% of the MOV file downloaded, and stuck. I got tired of waiting for a seed, so I tried the incomplete file. It played all but the final 10 seconds in Media Player and VLC, but crashed various AVS programs. I used Handbrake to create a M4V file, and then used AVS Converter to make another MOV file (also 10 seconds short). Obviously, this was a headache, but the result was very good, the clip did not appear truncated, and it beat waiting for some douchebag to seed it."
