You simply could have used StuffitExpander yourself, created a new torrent, and uploaded that instead.

Thereby saving the potentially thousands of people that download this one completely unnecessary fucking step.

GO FUCK YOURSELF AND YOUR STUFFITINYOURASS EXPANDER!!!!"
[V],DeGun,2011-04-06T00:19Z,"First you could say the same thing nicely but being in front your screen makes you feel so strong when obviously you re as weak as a gay batiboy.

Otherwise two things : Since i moved in a new house my bandwith is limited badly , only uploading at 30ko/s max ... As well as i moved in a new house recently i havent yet got all my stuff sorted and my computer with Mac on it is still ina box ... so i couldn't do that . 

And once extracted the size of folder is quite bigger than with the sitx file on its own ... i did not think it will be a problem as people in the end are happy to have what they want for free ... as well i do not expect thousands of peopel to download this or else you give a lot of credit to my torrents .

To finish i will just tell you something that any one out there would tell you : 

go and f@ck yourself twat . 

Thx for comments :)  "
