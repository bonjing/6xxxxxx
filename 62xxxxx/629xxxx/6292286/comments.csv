,pptdgc,2011-06-03T15:35Z,Does this include Traktor Scratch? Is it cracked? Thanks
,stefanrox,2011-06-14T02:50Z,"When I click on ""Start Setup Wizard"" under the Help tab, a pop up comes up saying ""Missing controller TSIs"". Any ideas on how I can get through this?"
,Mike_08,2011-07-02T13:54Z,"Downloaded this to trial it before I upgrade my old stuff. Works perfect and the improvements NI have made are awesome!   

There is a warning message about ""missing TSI files"" that comes up on start up but it doesn't seem to have any effect on the way it works. 

Thanks!"
,Mike_08,2011-07-03T21:31Z,... Solved the missing TSI problem by just copying the folder from my original Traktor Pro into the TSP2 folder.
,Didvid.S,2011-08-22T07:58Z,Not the full version. Doesn't have a cross-fader.
