""      
NOTE : [20-40] tagged encodes use new tool-chain and new encoding type.
        I would like to keep PS3/Xbox/standalones compatibility - therefore, 
        I need feedback from users of PS3/Xbox and different standalone 
        MP4 capable players and QuickTime users.
        Without feedback I cannot achieve wider compatibility.
        And most certainly, not from the thin air. """
[T],qwersd,2011-04-02T21:52Z,your new encodes work on my PS3..
,justregged,2011-04-02T22:07Z,"I will download chaos from tvpack and let you know if it plays on 360 and wd media player, take maybe 30mins to download"
,justregged,2011-04-02T22:08Z,make that 15mins
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-02T22:22Z,@qwersd: Thank you.
,justregged,2011-04-02T22:57Z,"Yeah it plays fine on both 360 and wd although subs dont show on 360 but they never do for me anyway

So thanks for chaos"
,phoon23,2011-04-03T01:13Z,hey your encodes work on my ps3 no worries. Big thanx for all your hard work.
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-03T02:52Z,"I will see if they will play on my ZEN, but I'm not having much hope--the only videos that have ever worked were certain wma files in 320 x 240--and not all wma's in that size play either, although I've never tried to get an mp4 to play on it."
,sneakpeek23,2011-04-03T04:15Z,"I used to play it on my ps3 but since i got my hdtv, i just hooked my ehd directly to my tv and everything works perfect!
THANK YOU again! Outstanding!

,phoon23,2011-04-03T04:51Z,"works for a while then cuts out sound and shows a message "" this is protected by cinavia and is not authorized for playback on this device"
,the_shroud,2011-04-03T04:56Z,"Thank u so much. Really wanted to see this.
Special thanks too to whoever heard my req to seed again next 3 days. Its nice to see proof that despite the tsunami of hardfisted, hit&run haters out there, compassionate souls can still shine through :)

BTW, the Phantom box had no problem with your new encodes."
,muk0690,2011-04-03T06:45Z,Wow. 480p at 336mb. Is there a 720p coming?
,prank0007,2011-04-03T07:56Z,"Thnks man.Wanted this
Chinese man Jay chou rocks with his action"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-03T08:03Z,"Thanks folks.

@phoon23: Sorry, but nobody for last six months has been able to kill new Sony protection. Meanwhile, guys hacked PS3 firmware, but I cannot test it. Google PS3+Jailbreak. 

@muk0690 : Nope. That's it. Asked was for 480p."
,hkoraddi,2011-04-03T08:47Z,"thanks mate.


well yesterday was the cricket world cup so didnt move from the front of tv."
,muk0690,2011-04-03T08:59Z,"no problem. I'll download this. 
Thanks. I don't have PS3 or any MP4 capable devices except Nokia 5800XM. It won't accept x264."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-03T09:29Z,"@muk0690 :  Nokia 5800XM ACCEPTS x264/H264 video in MP4 container - but max. resolution is rather small, common cell-phone res. of just 320x240.

XviD could be 640x360 (as H264 for U97) but hardware limitations prevent H264  playback of higher resolutions. Sorry, but 320x240  is too small for anything decent."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-03T09:46Z,thanks for this--now I can replace the LiNE version!  Subtitles too!  Awesome!
,muk0690,2011-04-03T10:29Z,"I never tried a low resolution (320 X 240) x264/h264 in Nokia 5800XM. I'll try it out. 
Btw, I don't watch much of movies in the mobile."
,noel_lee,2011-04-03T10:34Z,"who gives these 4 thumbs down..???pathetic ,those who cant afford to show gratitudes towards others who really give them some piece of shit of happiness..still downloading and must be watching.lol..
