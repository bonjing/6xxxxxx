Various Artists - On Joyful Wings - Seven Swans Reimagined (Sufjan Stevens Full Album Covered)



Seven Swans, the legendary album from Sufjan Stevens is being â€œreimaginedâ€ by a collection of indie artists for charity. All profits from the album will go to benefit the Susan G. Komen For The Cure breast cancer foundation. So, buy a copy if you want to support this cause!! The project was organized and put together by an independent compilation company, On Joyful Wings. They got 15 different and unique artists, ranging from Bonnie â€˜Princeâ€™ Billy to Joshua James to The David Crowder Band, to deliver their own re-working of one of the Swans songs. I think the song I am most looking forward to hearing is Derek Webbâ€™s interpretation of â€œIn the Devilâ€™s Territory.â€
