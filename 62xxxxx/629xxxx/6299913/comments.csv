,Virus_2k,2011-04-06T21:27Z,"This doesn't work.

It's missing a file so you can't unpack it completly."
,Virus_2k,2011-04-06T21:32Z,Never mind! You had to select all zip files and unpack them. They're not linked for some reason..

,Virus_2k,2011-04-07T01:13Z,@Tornadoxxx I get the same problem :/
,agarath,2011-04-07T07:32Z,Me too. This release is broken
,specter7237,2011-04-07T07:38Z,Same issue here.  Would love to play past the tutorial.
,bloodb1,2011-04-07T08:24Z,"SATAN666606 just because ur retarded it doesnt mean the poster is a moron. ziped then rared means less MB to download a little more to extract whych is better for me, if u werent so fucking retarded and look at what ur doing and download u wouldnt have to redownload it fuck face -.-"

You can skip the tutorials, in fact, it tells you that you can leave and continue on once you've learnt the basics.


But yes, this release is screwed, but it's still playable, you just have to quit before the timer runs out so it doesn't crash."
,sovarn,2011-04-07T13:04Z,Can multiplayer be played with this release?
,Craven_Darkshadow,2011-04-07T13:36Z,"game breaks after completing a mission, you can play other levels but you wont see the end-score of it

as for compression its far better to go 7zip which is a lot better then raring then ziping, 

common sense dictates 2 different compression method reduces the size of the files but reality it doesn't help but increases the size most of the time

the possible 1 meg savings from this method is more pain then benefit "

,m_d_c_8989,2011-04-10T20:43Z,"fun game, though annoying cuz of the hangups & no scores. thanks to the uploader.

,atwasoad,2011-04-11T05:54Z,"i have everything right up until i have to double click on reuben.exe and choose my language. i choose english, then my screen goes black, and the windows error solution screen come up. it has done this multiple times but it has not been fixed. any suggestions?"
,Jazah,2011-04-11T09:55Z,"@atwasoad
This appears to be a graphics card issue with the game. If you make a shortcut to the Reuben.exe file, right click on the shortcut and click properties.
Under the ""Target"" field add "" -wimpy"" to the end.

So the end of the target field should look similar to this ""win32\Reuben.exe -wimpy"".

Then run the game from the shortcut file, and when you get inside the game you can change the graphics back to high. Hope it helps."
,JamieA242,2011-04-11T19:37Z,please upload a copy that doesnt crash after finishing a level please :(
,JamieA242,2011-04-11T20:01Z,"im getting the crash aswell, everytime i complete level."
,atwasoad,2011-04-12T05:33Z,"sorry jazah, still dident work. my comp is never good when it comes to torrents XD any other ideas?"
,m_d_c_8989,2011-04-12T11:13Z,hahaha! lol!
,m_d_c_8989,2011-04-12T11:40Z,"@atwasoad
lol!, i did had that problem too, just delete the Hoard shortcut on your desktop (that the installer made) and create a new shortcut from Reuben.exe found inside the /Hoard/Win32/ dir, no -wimpy lol"
,m_d_c_8989,2011-04-12T11:57Z,"@atwasoad 
I think its because the shortcut's property (made by the installer) got the Target: correct -""C:\ProgramFiles\Hoard\win32\Reuben.exe""
but for the Start in: its only ""C:\ProgramFiles\Hoard\""
So either create a new shortcut from the Reuben file or edit the original shortcut's Start in: to ""C:\ProgramFiles\Hoard\win32\"""
,stiflex,2011-04-13T22:29Z,"There's also another good way to play this, just go to smartsteam and play there. im not sure about multiplayer, but single player works fine. This is good too, good game love playin this"
,schlixx,2011-04-14T20:38Z,@stiflex  please enlighten us as to what smartstream is and how to use it?
,OOLAdmin,2011-04-19T06:56Z,"I found out the answer, the cracked exe they used is bad, I have used another exe and it works perfect."
,BakaBaka11,2011-04-24T18:11Z,".zips take more space than the .rars they contain. .exe is packed file which takes less space than .zips.

oh, well.... lol"
,seldon131,2011-04-30T01:43Z,"So here's an interesting question. If you knew it was a bad crack (which is possible I suppose) and you had a good version, why would you say so and give zero indication as to where the rest of us might find such a thing? There is no other hit on this site, so obviously from somewhere else. Why do you mock us?"
,gambitjam,2011-05-10T20:31Z,It Works but takes alot of graphic memory. Some pc's can't play it.
,adlz,2011-05-11T19:16Z,"When I'm trying to install the game, it asks me for a r00 file, but the files starts at r01...

I can't get past this point, what do I do?"
,adlz,2011-05-11T19:21Z,"Oh.. I had to extract every single one of the .zip files, just to turn them into .rar files. LOOOL,gg."
[T],dramacore,2011-05-15T06:13Z,thanks
,dannaz423,2011-05-21T10:11Z,the game works but it crases after every level. And it's not a very good game in general.
,Torbax,2011-06-05T00:05Z,"Is there a fix for the levels-ending-crash-thing !? I hate to see the timer go off and then being forced to end the game and basicly ""not winning"" "
