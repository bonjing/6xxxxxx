5.1 DIGITAL DOLBY SOUNDTRACK UNTOUCHED

After scoring popular hits with When Worlds Collide and The War of the Worlds, 
special-effects pioneer George Pal returned to the visionary fiction of H.G. 
Wells to produce and direct this science-fiction classic from 1960. Wells's 
imaginative tale of time travel was published in 1895 and the movie is set in 
approximately the same period with Rod Taylor as a scientist whose magnificent 
time machine allows him to leap backward and forward in the annals of history. 
His adventures take him far into the future, where a meek and ineffectual race 
known as the Eloi have been forced to hide from the brutally monstrous Morlocks. 
As Taylor tests his daring invention, Oscar-winning special effects show us what 
the scientist sees: a cavalcade of sights and sounds as he races through time at 
varying speeds, from lava flows of ancient earth to the rise and fall of a towering 
future metropolis.

The movie's charm lies in its Victorian setting and the awe and wonder that carries over from Wells's classic story. The pioneering spirit of the movie is still enthralling, but it gets a bit silly when Taylor turns into a stock hero, rescuing a beautiful blonde Eloi (Yvette Mimieux) and battling with the chubby green Morlocks whose light-bulb eyes blink out when they die. Although it's quaint when compared to the special-effects marvels of the digital age, the movie's still highly entertaining and filled with a timeless sense of wonder.
