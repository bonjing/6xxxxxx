,satman80,2011-04-07T09:51Z,"This torrent seems to be a fake one, extraction of winrar file is very complicated and cannot extract the setup file, uploader might trying to fool the downloaders."
[V],MAFIAA.,2011-04-07T22:34Z,@satman80 troll harder!
,doobtribe,2011-04-08T13:24Z,"He's not trolling, you forgot to add the initial rar file, they won't unpack."
,doobtribe,2011-04-08T13:26Z,"He's not trolling, you forgot to add the initial rar file, they won't unpack. *fo-p8s.rar and fo-p8s.r00 are missing"
,donkeydick121,2011-04-23T21:06Z,This is a great piece of software. Just a shame you cocked up the compression !!
,binyo66,2011-05-01T07:31Z,thx
,Mr Blue,2011-05-05T14:58Z,Thanks and it works great
,artichok,2011-05-08T15:27Z,"I don't generally criticize an uploader, but to pack rars into individual zips is just a bit on the thick side... 

Why would you do that????"
,denied,2011-05-13T11:12Z,"Man it must be hard being a noob so that you cant packup a few .zip and .rar files. All is in its order, no files are missing, none are corrupt. Im now starting the installer and no problems, program is installed.

Rars are packed in zips for scene related issues, no need for you to understand why they do it, just live with it. Its how its been done for years."
,jordanidk,2011-05-17T07:31Z,"Never seen compression done quite so stupidly. Easiest way I found was to highlight all winrars and and click extract here to extract them all. Ignore all warnings and just wait till you get the .exe. 

Run it and enjoy.

Thanks to uploader even if your method of compression was a bit on the crazy side.."
,YudiBlues,2011-05-29T11:48Z,thx dude...
,tampopo,2011-06-02T21:01Z,"All of you are really dumb people. All is ok, no missing files. Are all wearing your glasses?"
,Logikos,2011-06-10T04:16Z,"Guys -- It isn't very difficult.

Highlight all the RAR files, and right click.  Extract it all HERE.  

It ends up being one file, which is the installer.

Really that simple."
,danilo86,2011-06-19T17:07Z,"Thanks uploader.
Works fine.
+1"
,jez1961,2011-07-04T14:39Z,Thanks alot. Works perfectly. Much appreciated :)
,kenstrife,2011-07-12T18:43Z,thanks! working on my windows 7 64-bit
,Duzzy01,2011-07-18T14:47Z,"Finally, one that includes the WinPE boot disk. But what a waste of time, can't even delete a system or boot partition without deleting all partitions."
,bluesborn,2011-07-21T01:51Z,Rather than complain about this torrent why not just grab it from the source:FOSI.
,Duzzy01,2011-07-21T15:57Z,"bluesborn, I wasn't complaining about the torrent, I was complaining about the program, even if the torrent was packed stupid, a single rar would be sufficient and no bigger.
Also grab what from what source?

Acronis Disk Director 11 is better, just not sure about secure wipe features."
,MakTalOz,2011-08-01T12:00Z,"Bothersome to acquire the actual .exe file, but worth it.

Clear directions to ""create"" the .exe:

Once all of the .zip files have been extracted, the following files need to be place in the same directory:

1. All files with the naming scheme ""fo-p8s.r##"" (where ## is 00 - 29).

2. The ""fo-p8s.rar"" file.

3. The ""file_id.diz"" file.

Once these (32) files are in the same directory, ""creating"" the .exe is a simple matter of opening ""fo-p8s.rar"" in IZArc/WinZip/7-Zip/etc. and extracting to a single directory.

This will create the file ""fo-p8s.exe"" which should be ~143MB.

Enjoy!"
