[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-05T16:04Z,The forced English subs are burned into the video stream.  The soft subs are full SDH subs and were extremely difficult to make.  CBGB included en and es subs but they were idx/sub (vobsub) format and were complete hell to ocr to txt.  I didn't transcode the es subs because of the difficulty in translation and amount of correction required.
