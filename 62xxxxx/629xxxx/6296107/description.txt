Dr_Maxwell presents...\\\"The Oak\\\" in HD!

Conan The Destroyer has not yet been released commercially in HD format because Universal owns the picture rights to the original franchise and you all know what happened to HD-DVD...

So I bring you one of the only existing copies of Conan The Destroyer in HD format; here's what it looks like for all of you wondering:

Please leave a comment if you are looking for something in particular and or any suggestions!

Thanks and enjoy! Remember kiddies Crom will be displeased if you don't share the love, so try to let it seed for a little while after you complete your download!

I have fibre optic net and will be seeding constantly at 1.5MB/s until I have to travel to Australia and rebuild my comp, so get it while it's hot!

Have a nice day!
