,victorycurt,2011-04-19T20:38Z,"I am having trouble with the KEYGEN. I have turned off the UAC off and am logged in as the admin. I'm still getting the ""Could not get debug priv. Are you the admin?"" error when I open it and hit the MEM PATCH button. Help"
,1REEPER1,2011-04-20T00:59Z,vic. sounds like you are use ing a 64 bit kg for a 32 bit OS. Double check the systems

,roystona,2011-05-18T21:44Z,"brilliant. I just used winrar and didn't need to mount anything!
you must set your user account control setting to 'never notify' for the mem patch to work (requires reboot unfortunately).
thanks a greeeaat deal."
,Ripper-B,2011-05-22T00:36Z,"I down'd it and winrar showed a CRC error so i re-downloaded the broken file but.. nothing :(

Anyway I'm downloading the x32 version now.."
,webster899,2011-05-29T13:43Z,Is there anyway for anyone to find out that it's an illegal version if the license is cracked?
,matpoubelle,2011-06-01T03:53Z,"Thank a lot for the tip, Work perfect with Daemon tools

Don't work with Power Iso, ask for second CD"
,cvriv,2011-06-09T11:58Z,Awesome. LOL. Downloading this at 2150KB/s! Keep up the good work!
,londean11,2011-06-15T11:53Z,"Forgive me, I may just be stupid, but what is ""unpacking""? or ""mounting""? I don't understand the instructions, the words are english but the language is foreign. Might someone dumb them down for me? From what I can... well guess, is that I have to burn this file and the crack onto a DVD, then pop that same DVD back into my drive to install it onto my computer.. Which does not make sense to me. Please help!"
,mouthpear,2011-07-23T00:58Z,"Download great but how do you get it to install Pro version, it only says inventor, no pro"
,albokid89,2011-08-23T06:40Z,"OK GUYS, LISTEN UP!!!
First of all props to my man Chris-Aksel for an amazing job he's done with this. I know programs like this can be frustrating and a pain in the ass to install but this one worked like a charm for me! If you do it carefully i dont see why it shouldnt for yall, too.

After you download this, seed it! haha So you extract it with WinRAR and you get an iso image out of that! Make sure you mount the image with DAEMON TOOLS. Nothing else will work, and you'll probably get the error ""Enter DVD 2 of 2"", and you will blame this torrent for being shitty and not functional. No follow the instructions carefully. After you mount it, disconnect from the Internet, and run the setup.exe! Use the instructions from the folder crack! Enter the license number and code or whatever and install whatever components you need to install! After installation is complete. Use the keygen for the x64 bit system since thats the one youve installed. Make sure you run it as administrator! Put everything in order and you should be allset. You'll have at you hands a perfectly genuine thousand of dollars software! 

Again thanks to the uploader and if it works for you, which i dont see why it shouldnt, dont forget  to SEED it !!!!!

**NOTE: If youre going to make money of this, buy the actual software and support the company!

Thank you! "
,albokid89,2011-08-23T06:45Z,"btw i installed this on a Gateway NV53 
AMD Athlon(TM) II Dual-Core M300 2.00GHz 
4GB RAM. Windows 7 Home Premium Edition! x64

Make sure your computer meets the system requirements and its up to date for proper installation! 

I hope this has helped all of y'all!!!"
,tufguy,2011-09-10T13:08Z,hmmm... I might be too stupid to get this... but i´ve done everything as the install.txt file says I should... but my activationcode comes out 7 digits too short... WHYYYYYYYY!!!! :-(
,sceneg33k,2011-09-11T01:15Z,"Call me stupid and Trolololol, but can one of you people who dont just hate on people tell me why i dont have enough letters/numbers its 7 short on the activation, what am i doing wrong?"
,tufguy,2011-09-12T16:17Z,thank god i´m not the only one with this problem... makes me look less stupid... LOL

,tomazetti,2011-10-06T18:32Z,"I can´t install it. When I try to install, it asks to insert de cd 2. But there is only one. Could you help me? Thanks"
,KeithKriza,2011-10-06T21:51Z,"You guys having a hard time with the activation code: I accidentally forgot to erase the ""Paste code here"" or whatever it says and got the same error you guys did. Simply delete everything before you paste your code in. Don't worry if it doesn't fill out all the spaces, it will work."
,kleftokotas,2011-10-20T04:43Z,"Thank you sir,works perfectly."
,Christie007,2011-10-28T22:50Z,"Can't get this to activate.  Mem Patch ""You can only apply patch when licence screen appears"" and also activation key 6 digits short??? Please help.  I did everything step-by-step as per ""Read Me"".
Thanks in advance!!!  I use 64-bit"
,subinpv85,2011-12-03T12:58Z,"hi i am a beginner at softwares 
i am using windows 7

anyone pls help"
,Avenger55,2011-12-21T16:16Z,"I've never seen such a pathetic installer in my LIFE for a product.  It SERIOUSLY fails to install because the C++ 2010 Redist fails to install because the version I already have installed is NEWER.  Yes, it is already installed and is newer, so the C++ Redist installer ""fails"" which causes the ENTIRE installation to fail.  What a joke."
,dschaffer2011,2011-12-22T07:50Z,"WHAT A EPIC FAIL, ^ AGREED"
,dschaffer2011,2011-12-22T09:18Z,it fails to install every time any ideas?
,almost_nothing,2011-12-26T02:28Z,"Hi everyone! First of all thats for the great torrent, i could install it and make it run without activate it, cause there's the problem. When i run the crack for 64bits, the AVG complains about a trojan at this file, that way i cant run it! Is it safe, anyone could get this crack to work? Tks guys"
,fkplus,2011-12-31T13:44Z,"Avenger55, dschaffer2011: Any workarounds for this C++ Redist issue?"
,NicThePic,2012-01-19T21:41Z,"it fails to install every time, why?"
,laxfool10,2012-01-25T16:52Z,It fails to install due to a newer version of C++ 2010 Redist already being on your computer. You can easily remove the updated version up to the one its trying to install (10.0.30319) through the control panel and the installation should work after. You can then update it to the version you used to have.
,kenevert,2012-02-05T03:00Z,"PEOPLE, unless you got a good virus program i suggest you stay away from this torrent. i contains a Win32/Heur virus which is a dangerous trojan.
here is some info about the virus: http://www.scanforfree.com/07/remove-win32.heur.html"
,Gizmotist,2012-02-09T02:58Z,TO INSTALL IT PROPERLY USE D-TOOLS.
,babuubabuu,2012-02-13T05:30Z,Mem patch not working (64-bit) I am already run as administrator and run on activation windows but why??? Need help!!!!
,svantegor,2012-02-15T14:25Z,"thanks for the upload, but i have a problem:

I installed it, followed the instructions (64 version), installation finishes and then nothing happens. should the activation start automatically, must i start it manually? i'm confused. also, i cannot start the file in crack folder (admin, UAC off), it just tells me it cannot run.

PLEASE, i'm in a hury and need this program asap"
,Kirresson,2012-02-21T14:20Z,"Don't know what you are all complaining about. Easy to install with the help of ""laxfool10""s comment. Thx for great upload"
,svantegor,2012-02-23T15:43Z,"Kirreson, can you please write a bit more detailed description what i have to do to install it? i'm a bit of a newb"
,alpollo2009,2012-02-27T10:12Z,i can't download it. Torrent error: Access is denied.
,borraxkid,2012-03-17T20:57Z,getting insert disc 2 error when it goes to copy files.....all the other autodesk software from chris installs beautifully
,astorakos,2012-03-24T16:42Z,"I am having a trouble. I did everything fine, followed every step activated and all. Every program runs perfectly but I cant run Autodesk Inventor 2012. I run it , the loading screen comes up and then nothing! Anyone can help me? "
,taxmav,2012-04-06T05:55Z,"I'm still stuck on ""please insert dvd 2 of 2"" I mounted with power ISO, then I tried d-tools, same problem. Anybody have a fix for this yet? "
,mgutierrez237,2012-05-05T22:57Z,can you please get inventor cam too this would be a great asset to inventor thank you
,bugbrain,2012-06-05T01:46Z,"@taxmav: You probably have to extract the files from the iso, and run the installer from there."
