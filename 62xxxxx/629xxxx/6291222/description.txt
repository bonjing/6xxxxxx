A new batch of Saracuse / early Kasabian demos!

This torrent includes the last Saracuse demo with an early version of Processed Beats that helped clinch their record deal. Later renamed the Jacknife Lee Mix, the other songs on this demo include the final versions of Rain On My Soul (which later became Test Transmission) and Gone So Far (aka Come Back Down).

1. Processed Beats (demo version)
2. Rain On My Soul
3. Gone So Far

Also included in this torrent is the rare An Excuse To Get Wasted (a recreational terrorist tale), an awesome track about a bully/extortionist from the local play area in Blaby (Leicester).

Plus an acoustic track Sniffing Glue featuring Sergio on guitar and vocals recorded live - you can hear Scott Gilbert screaming "WE'RE FREE" down the talk back in the studio :-)

Please keep seeding this and the other Saracuse torrents long after you've downloaded them - the more people who can hear these, the better (and the sooner more demos will be shared)
