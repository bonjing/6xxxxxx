Think of Ben Folds as Billy Joel minus the Tin Pan Alley heritage and armed with a sweet, wry, slacker ethos. In a guitar-free trio setting, the Chapel Hill smart guy pounds the ivories with gusto while singing a tremendous batch of funny (Kate), poignant (Brick, Evaporated), pissed-off (Song for the Dumped), and hugely refreshing (all 12 tunes here) songs.
