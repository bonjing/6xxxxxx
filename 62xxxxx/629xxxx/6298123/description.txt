This is different cameras edited to make the most complete Detroit showing of the Violent Torpedo.  There are a few obvious skips, no source material, but other that and source changes, which are mostly file to file since most wouldnt combine in avidemux.  I renamed and  numbered them appropriately.  

There is a crappy rapper right before the snoop video but yeah cant refind the 1 clip i found

call of duty clip was apparently from ign, so the short clip of that I saw is replaced by the download of the video

I plan to try to do most the shows that I can.... provided it continues, and its seems from day 3 reviews, it'll be show that continues on a far lower note than advertised.  Interesting though..
