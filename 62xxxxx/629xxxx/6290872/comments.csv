I got a letter in the mail from my internet serv. prov. They told me to quit downloading torrents and that it was illegal. My  ISP  had  got  a letter from WARNER BROTHERS MOVIE CORP.  telling them to contact me and handle it in a appropriate manner. To make a long story short, they're gonna turn off my service if they get contacted again by someone saying i downloaded their movie torrents. My question is : How does everyone else get away with this? Thanks for your comment. ps this was the only way i knew how to reach you. Hope i didn't mess up your thread or whatever. Thanks again."
