,murrambingi,2011-04-03T15:22Z,"CC more seeding is needed, stuck at 94.2% with only 0.4kB/s down and 75kB/s up, only 1 peer at 100%, so far 1 hour download for 226MiB this is very poor atm :("
[T],Captain_Cook,2011-04-03T18:51Z,"
Hoping too someone will find the crack to play all the 85 models"
,murrambingi,2011-04-03T20:20Z,"CC, i need instructions on how to install your application, i am not sure how you have set this up as the main .exe application does not install? is this a portable version? and if it is how do you get the updates to be directed to the correct install folder?
Please give me details on how to install the program and updates as i am not familiar with the way you have created this."
[T],Captain_Cook,2011-04-04T04:53Z,"Just copy all in c:\

edit this line in the regs if you install (copy) in a different path... C... D E F

""Install Path""=""C:\\Program Files\\Video Strip Poker""

save
double click on the regs and start: Main.exe

enjoy..."
[T],Captain_Cook,2011-04-04T05:48Z,"The different other folders (Video Strip poker) are not needed... they are there just for you to analyse how the crack are builted, if you are a PRO, maybe you will create the new crack to play the 85 models and don't forget to infor us, here....

Then the program with regs is ready to play the 51th models & all 50 before...

If you know a crack (safe) that play other Models over 51.... Inform us here with a link to try it."
,pokechapp,2011-04-06T10:41Z,"So let me get this straight, I need emule to download the actual models? Why not just put them up?"
[T],Captain_Cook,2011-04-06T17:37Z,"
If someone want share the 85 models in torrents,
no problems...

Just create the torrents, upload them, and give here the links:

,outlaw_star1982,2011-04-17T19:15Z,nod32 shows a trojan not sure if its a false positive how do i tell before i install?
,NanoMan_777,2011-04-30T05:24Z,Outlaw - Consider the source....don't fret..I don't!! Have seen too many successes to even consider it.It is a misread by your virus scanner.
,fretingabout,2011-06-09T16:51Z,"Do girls really take long to load? I've copied the Video Strip Poker folder to C/Program Files(x86)/Video Strip Poker and changed the registry like you said but when I try to play the included girls, it just shows the loading screen for so long."
,justanormalphreak,2011-08-08T22:48Z,I know you explained before how to install... but could you explain more in depth so that a noob such as i am can understand thank you
,jopai,2012-01-03T07:48Z,it still requires a cd ... how can i fix this?
,jopai,2012-01-03T11:35Z,"capt. cook thnx.. its working..it only needs the main inside the vsp 1.45 to be copied to the vsp folder

,Louisiana247,2012-02-09T06:44Z,"I've spent several hours trying to figure out how this works, and I'm stumped.  I've got plenty of experience with cracks the like for games, but this one has got me.  I'm not sure what directory to put everything in, how to get the game itself patched (Keep getting wrong directory errors) and I can't figure out what to do with ed2k links.

Is there a very detailed walkthrough anywhere, or anyone that can write one up?  I've tried reading through the info & comments page, or at least a good readme file, and found nothing."
,cpassimple,2012-05-12T23:56Z,"Do not waste your time with this torrent.
This version of the game is crap at best you would find at a black screen where it says ""loading"""
