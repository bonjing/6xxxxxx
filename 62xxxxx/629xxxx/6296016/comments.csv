How'd you rip the music from their flash player anyways? Sound recorder? Or did you happen to find it in your temp file?"

As for ripping the flash player, there are many methods, some work on some players, not on others, but the one they use is the easiest I've ever seen.

The really funny part was that the third song stops playing and tells you to join their ""fan club"" if you want to hear the rest, but I ripped it just as easy.

As for teaching you, can't do that in a comment, but do a search for firefox extensions, the popular ones will rip this site, and about 80% of others I've seen."
