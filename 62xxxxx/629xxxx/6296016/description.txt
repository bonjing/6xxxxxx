Note from uploader: I got a hold of this after seeing the article mentioned and thought Id share with the community. Good for a laugh, and to be fair, I agree the music aint half bad, but definitely not 100,000 illegal downloads. None at all, until now, so please feel free to share and post this anywhere you please  :)




Ok, this story is to funny to believe. This (nobody) band (who admittedly isnt bad), did a search on a malicious torrentsite and got (advertisements) claiming to have their new album.

Note: You can type any real or fake name in their search and get the same results. Try it!

Now go throughly read the article on TorrentFreak

Now if you can manage to stop laughing, have a listen to their music. There album was Pre,d by the Scene, but only ONE torrentsite even offered it (that we could find), and it got ZERO downloads.

The bottom line is...

NONE OF THEIR MUSIC WAS EVER PIRATED!!!

My goal is to change that, so Enjoy!!!

Btw, the three songs were ripped directly from the Bands Flash Player on their own website. I guess theyre too dumb to know that by the time it plays in my speakers, the files are already on my computer  lol

Oh yeah, you can only listen to two of the three songs with out joining their (Fan Club)???   well...  thats true, but I had no problem ripping the mp3 even if thier lame flash player stopped the song after 30 seconds  lol (Id love to see their faces if I showed them how easy that was).
