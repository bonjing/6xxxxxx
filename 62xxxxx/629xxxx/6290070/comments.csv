,klasier,2011-04-05T18:49Z,Anyone know if it is secure? Alot of .exe files that could be anything.
,caki.deki,2011-04-07T11:24Z,Scaned with BitDefender. No viruses found. Only problem is japanese installer so you need to know where is next button :P

Little correction in instalation notes

,mark9717,2011-06-17T00:13Z,need better install details
,NSEngine,2011-06-20T08:57Z,"Works flawlessly on Vista too
thanks"
,pokky2004,2011-06-22T14:10Z,"The game installs perfectly on windows 7 64 bit. However, i'm having this slight graphics issue when I play where the ? and ! icons that appear their heads seem to be distorted? Also the weapon and item icons in the menu are displayed as white square boxes. Anyone has a solution to this problem?"
,caki.deki,2011-06-26T18:51Z,"@pokky2004

You haven't patched correctly. Sorry for bad install notes. Follow this more detailed instructions:

- Mount mds file with any virtual driver software and install game.
- After installation start the patch file ys6_1109.exe and just click far left button until it finishes patching process.
- Now start Ys6_tujyou.exe. We convert this game to standard edition this way.
- After that, start ys6_1202.exe and patch it again.
- Finally, start YsVI_ENG_v1202only.exe so you convert game to english.

Only this way all icons will show correctly and game will run perfectly. "
,mortisde,2011-09-17T17:57Z,"Ok so I get up to the conversion step but for some reason no matter what I push it doesn't do anything. It just sits at 0.0 and 0.0 complete
Can someone please explain more in detail each step to make this work?"
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-19T21:14Z,"I have tried a number of times to install this game (after an extremely lengthy download... 0.5kb/s download speed sucks. SEED PEOPLE!) and I cannot get it to work. Here are the steps I do:

1) Open Installer. Click Install, click OK, click "",Í,¢"", click Yes, click ""Œ^'è"", click Yes, click ""I—¹"" after installation is complete to close installer, then click Exit.
2) Open ys6_1109.exe, click ""アップデート"", click OK, close updater.
3) Open YS6_tujyou.exe, click Yes, click OK, click ""?????(C)"", click ""???(C)"".
4) Open ys6_1202.exe, click ""アップデート"", click OK twice, close updater.
5) Open YsVI_ENG_v1202only.exe, go through updater.

Things should be working at this point according to the instructions given by caki.deki. However, when I run the game, all I get is a black screen and the sound of an ocean. The game then stops responding and I'm forced to manually close it.

Did I do something wrong during my install process, or is there something I'm missing? I'd like to play this game, damnit."
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-20T17:18Z,"Okay so it turns out that the ""?????(C)"" button I was clicking in step 3 was a cancel button, and I wasn't actually updating the program because I wasn't being patient enough. I waited long enough for the update to complete, went through the rest of the steps, and it still does the exact same thing; black screen with an ocean sound, then it stops responding and I'm forced to manually end the process.

Clearly I was doing something wrong initially... am I still doing something wrong?"
,darkuz025,2012-03-31T22:16Z,how do you install this. i keep mounting it but nothing happens
,diviatix1985,2012-04-13T07:39Z,"hmmm
I keep getting a error when it starts to install the game,
error is something in japanese and C:/users/myusername/application data/falcom/ys6_win"
,stratax,2012-06-08T02:29Z,"little confusing to set up but it works great, thanks."
,saiyaku,2012-06-11T03:20Z,@RickyTheFish I'm having the same problem. Black screen and all. I installed the game without any problems (patches and all) but i keep getting a black screen at the intro movie and then it freezes.... dull -_-
