,theseedanator,2011-04-04T16:49Z,Too all the little boys and girls out their who download torrents please continue uploading after you have finished downloading to at least 100% this keeps the torrent alive for others at a decent speed. It makes no difference what speed your internet connection is with torrents thats why you need to keep uploading. Don't be a selfish leecher be a seeder
,ajfaj,2011-04-04T17:21Z,"6 hours on the clock an still under halfway,come on people you need to seed files that are so big,only got 10 connected peers at an average of 2-3k/s which means my fastest speed is around 20-30k/s,was hopeing to watch this before RAW tonight but looks like i will have to play catchup

[V],SAFCukO09,2011-04-04T18:36Z,I think some people need to learn how to set the torrent client right as well .........Dont use your torrent clients default settings they are useless up the numbers people and watch it speed it
,goggy023,2011-04-04T18:39Z,"Come on guys seed,please! The speed is too low!"

Guess i'll just have to wait, i dont think i was gonna watch Raw tonight anyway because of watching wrestlemania lol, SAFCuk is a great uploaded, i just think it's the 16000+ leechers that make the torrent scene so frustrating these days. what happened to my 1gig in 10 mins Dl speed 8("
,Synyster666,2011-04-04T20:51Z,*Uploader not uploaded lol

,Josha5000,2011-04-04T21:44Z,"The speed on the torrents on tpb is usually fine, you just have to have a fair upload/download rate.

So many complains, but... how can it be that i do NOT have this problems?

I seed until 200-300% and get good download-speeds in 95% of anything i download (mostly wwe).

Took around 30min to get this one.


But anyways, the wrestlemania itself wasn't too great in my optionion. I liked the match of triple h VS undertaker, but the others.... were kinda disappointing to me."

The card just sucked ass and anybody who spent #55.00 of there hard earn money on this boring piece of garbage I am so sorry you got screwed .
Even the crowd was chanting boring so download it and you will see what I am taking about .Even the Stage and the wrestlers entrance was beyond toned down and just lame ."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2011-04-06T17:23Z,"Agreed, springw.

It was a totally boring event. I haven't watched a Wrestlemania for years, but this was the worst time to start watching again. I feel sorry for any poor bastard who paid the $69.95 for the pay-per-view."
