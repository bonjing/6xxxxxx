Keller Williams - Live at Schwagstock 31 - Camp Zoe/Salem, MO

Keller delivers a magical performance, live from Camp Zoe, Salem, MO. Unfortunately, I wasn\'t there... But, fortunately, I have a friend that was and just happened to buy the 2-disc set that was released after the show. Which is also, to my knowledge, the only copies that were ever sold. I haven\'t seen them anywhere for purchase at his concerts, on the net, or even for download via torrent. So, I decided to share this one since it\'s so rare and deserves to be heard by music lovers much like myself. Some of the most amazing performances happened at Camp Zoe. Hopefully they can resolve their legal troubles and continue to share such amazing performances and utterly groovy times at their campsite. That being said... Enjoy! XD
