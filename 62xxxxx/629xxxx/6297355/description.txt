GAME NOTES

Bridge! lets you be a structural engineer and a
construction manager in one. Master the mystery to
bridge with a limited budget and limited numbers of
parts to divide and to ensure a smooth operation

30 varied missions of increasing difficulty are waiting
to be solved with your own personal architectural
masterpieces

Conquer the challenge posed by the clever use of 15
different component types. In addition to simple iron
and steel struts, suspension cables and hydraulics are
waiting to be used for folding and hanging bridges or
build combinations

But just to construct is not enough. Different demands
from simple road to heavy rail freight traffic over to
the passage of ships are just the beginning. The biggest
enemies will be forces of nature such as floods, storms
and earthquakes. Will your bridge stand up to it, or
will it end in disaster?
Your efforts should not remain unrewarded. Through the
successful completion of missions you will unlock new
parts and scenarios for the integrated mission editor
Create new challenges and share them with your
friends
