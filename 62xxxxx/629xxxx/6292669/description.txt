Description......: This special looks at an experimental program that offers juvenile offenders the chance of a reduced sentence 
		   if they spend a weekend behind the walls of an adult jail. In the tiny town of Dumas, Texas, sixteen year-old 
		   Billy Wells is handcuffed, thrown into the back of a police car, and taken for sentencing after robbing a 
		   coin-operated machine. Facing months at a juvenile facility he accepts the Judge's offer and leaves his 
		   tearful family for the ugly reality of life behind bars. In order to clear his record, he must face solemn 
		   guards and adult inmates before returning to court to convince the Judge that he has learned the error of his 
		   ways. One troubled kid, one night in hell, one last chance.
