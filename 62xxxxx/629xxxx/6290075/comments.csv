Seems we take you for granted.
I just want you to know that all those wonderful (or should that be awful :-) ) movies you share are appreciated very much indeed!
Thank you very much!"
[T],bitstreeem,2011-04-02T23:59Z,"It's all good Fruster, I know that these 'gems' are appreciated by the fact that nearly all are still seeded.  I'm just happy that I can get these out as that age of cinema was so very important to me as I'm sure it was for you.  You have always been here and I hope you enjoy the others that are yet to come.

Thanks mate! "
