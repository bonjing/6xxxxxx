,bryentheartist,2012-05-27T22:51Z,wikipedia says there only 23 ep on  s13 and no final season 14 ever aired the season 13 was the last season
[T],iamgreat,2012-06-14T20:45Z,"bryentheartist, Wikipedia lists it as Mini-series and seasons 1-13, effectively calling the eps from April 1978 ""season zero"".  But when it comes to the DVDs those eps from April 1978 are season 1 and season 2 is Sept 78 - May 79 (what Wikipedia calls season 1). 

So it is seasons 0-13 by Wikipedia and some other places while on DVD it is seasons 1-14. The file naming of the DVDrips logically follows that of the actual DVDs the files are ripped from. Season 14 was released by FFNDVD in February 2011.

Yes it is somewhat confusing. Blame CBS's actions from nearly 35 years ago. But its not like they give a crap about anyone being confused by it since they don't own the show and have nothing to do with it anymore. "
