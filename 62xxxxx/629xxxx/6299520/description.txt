Keeping up with current EPA regulations for drinking water may be a requirement for engineers, water supply and treatment personnel, and public health officials, but few have the time or the wherewithal to wade through the more than 10,000 pages of technical and legal jargon these regulations include. In this Second Edition of this popular guide, John De Zuane provides clear, concise explanations of the latest regulations and current issues in water quality, from the original source to delivery to the consumer. Well-organized and lucidly written, Handbook of Drinking Water Quality 2/e provides comprehensive, up-to-date coverage of the many challenges water management professionals face today, including:  
* Current EPA regulations, with comparisons to World Health Organization and European Economic Community standards.
* Updated and expanded information on contaminants including lead, copper, radon, coliform, crytosporidium, and trihalomethanes.
* Guidelines for writing new standards or evaluating existing standards for drinking water quality.
