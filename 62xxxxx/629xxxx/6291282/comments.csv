,dumbson,2011-04-03T10:05Z,why is there a skull on the main page for this person but no skull here?
,mrorbear,2011-10-02T07:55Z,Episode 5 is not here. The episode entitled 5 is a repeat of ep 4.  Otherwise great.
,mrorbear,2011-10-03T09:13Z,"I retract my earlier comment...all the episodes are here, including episode 5, and this is a great upload. Thank you."
,c768580,2011-10-03T16:05Z,"This seems to be a rip from UK-TV.
It is quite blurry and encoding it to such a small size didn't help.
The audio isn't very clear ether.

Only watch this release on small screens."
,useitright,2011-10-10T20:21Z,"Well no wonder.  If you fools would look at the file size of the torrent you might notice that is only a little larger than ONE episode of what eztv puts out.  If that does not let you know that the quality of this is going to be pretty much shit, then I bet you download a lot of shit not knowing what your getting  or the quality of it.  So onward noobs......the waters ahead arent so treacherous once you learn a few things."
