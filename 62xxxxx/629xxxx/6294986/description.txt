OK Gang this is the Promo Only US version where they have somehow shoehorned in some English Lyrics to the song and messed about with the tempo a little.   Anyway you now have a choice as the original remake is also up here both in MPEG2 and AVI/MP4.

The thing is this is getting heavy air play in Europe and is going to be a massive fun time pre summer hit, that is all you need to know for now.   It is nice to see pure pop beating off the dreadful RAP rubbish that Promo Only USA churns out again and again.   Some of the RAP stuff is so bad I actually do not rip it to the master collection sigh.

16:9 mostly black and white with colour lyrics
