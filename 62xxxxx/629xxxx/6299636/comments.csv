,PaulAl,2011-04-10T10:27Z,"if your installation crashes regularly, espec. at end of the chapter, then you need to run a fix batch.
Google on ""Shadow Harvest Phantom Ops Fix_0.7z_links"", download fix, extract it in your main game folder, and run it.
Folder size Kaos: 3.80 Gb
Folder size fix: 3.87 Gb ~ 3.90 GB

ps: do not run batch file(s) with admin rights; it usually goes run...
or copy following at start of the batchfile first:
%~d0
cd %~dp0"

,darkpat,2011-04-13T16:38Z,"I got a prob in the mission at the palast, when mya (or whatever her name is ) hacks the konsole and you got to play as aaron, you get out of the cell and she ask you to help her out with some soldiers on her floor.
I can pick up weapons but i cant use em, i just see a point in front of me. Also my health status or weapon stsatus is not displayed at the side as normal.
Is this normal and you got to do some, i dont know special thing to fight the incoming soldiers or is that a game error, also i cant run, i just walk wqith that guy up the stairs untill soldiers are coming and shooting my ass of.
Is there a trick or some you need to do or is that just an error? please any solutions cause i wanna play on, i mean that game dont sucks that much , ive seen better games but for now i am interested in that one.
Sorry 4 my bad english.
THX
