I see this is a 2 disc edition, but can you tell me if the movie (usually disc 1) is Dutch subtitled aswell ?

If that is a positive, are the subtitles from RETAIL quality please ?

thx"

ajsemenietjes, Sorry Disc 2 is only Bonus material
Disc 1 is the Movie.
As it says itÂ´s a (DVDR) witch means nothing is removed or changed. Everything looks untouched to me and the subtitle looked all fine.

Regards!"

I understand iam in the DVDR section when iam there !... 
DVDR doesnt necessarily mean untouched or unchanged in any way!!

For example , why does ONLY the disc containing the Feauturette / extra's have different subtitels ?!?

Usually it's the other way arround, the movie should have all if not more subtitles then the extra's features !??

Unless ofcourse the uploader does upload the movie disk from 1 region and the feauturette disc from another regions...

Thats the most logical reason as to why the subtitles arent the same !!


Weird ....
