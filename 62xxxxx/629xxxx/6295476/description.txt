StoryLine: 
*********

Fate deals young orphan Matt Murdock a strange hand when he is doused with 
hazardous waste. The accident leaves Matt blind but also gives him a heightened 
"radar sense" that allows him to "see" far better than any man. Years later 
Murdock has grown into a man and becomes a respected criminal attorney. But 
after he's done his "day job" Matt takes on a secret identity as "The Man 
Without Fear," Daredevil, the masked avenger that patrols the neighborhood 
of Hell's Kitchen and New York City to combat the injustice that he cannot 
tackle in the courtroom.
