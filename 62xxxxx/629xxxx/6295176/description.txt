                          +++ HDTV (XviD/MP3) +++
                           Episodes 17-20(NoSubs)
                          (Original Aspect  Ratio)


The Grand Army of the Republic, led by Yoda, Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and other Jedi Knights, fights the New Droid Army of the Separatists.


This is a proper release of the Episodes 17-20, without the hardcoded subs.


Due to the standard set to â€œsubtitles switched onâ€ in the source mkv files, the previous release came out with said episodes having hardcoded subtitles.
I fixed it.

If you on the other hand want/need subs youâ€™ll most probably will find them here:
  http://subscene.com/
 â€“ just copy and paste the filename (without extension) and do a search ;).

I am sorry for any inconvenience I caused ;).
