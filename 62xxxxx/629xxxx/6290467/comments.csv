,xmaner,2011-04-04T05:25Z,You guys are all idiots no one is seeding it becuase when you lick Download NOw it says No Input File Specfied 
,Charbis,2011-04-04T12:30Z,"Forgive the harshness but you gotta be an idiot to download this. 85 Meg?, Beta release, no previous uploads and not a trusted source......Idiot."
,lynchy46645,2011-04-04T15:49Z,omg people are idiots this is not fake the 85mb is only the coming soon screen the beta will be over 2gb and will be only distributed on april 19th...dont use it fools like you would find away to end up messing up your hardrive/usb anyway morons
,lynchy46645,2011-04-04T15:50Z,ffs this is not fake its a coming soon screen the beta will be over 2gb when distributed. you can not play until mid april
,Charbis,2011-04-04T21:41Z,"Even if that is the case, Moron, you may aswell just wait. Also, having logs on your drive from an illigitimate game that is not released, especially pre-beta is a sure fire way of being banned. Enjoy. Moron. 

Hope all that high and mighty thinking of yours gets you a damn ban hammer."
,Charbis,2011-04-04T21:45Z,"lynchy, there isn't any way to mess up your USB, its 100% safe so long as everythings in the right place. Forgive me if you already know that but if thats the case then don't play the idiot."
,lynchy46645,2011-04-06T02:42Z,"@Charbis you are a retard of the highest order believe me son i know a shit lot more about this stuff than you ya little novy cunt...also theres a confirmed rumor now that the beta will be console locked so this will not work....Do you not understand the difference between me saying ""fools like you would surely find away of messing up your hdd/usb anyway"" and me actually stating you can mess up your hdd/usb you are stupid nothing more.

and let me also say, having this 85 mb file on your hdd is the exact same as entering a beta code and downloading this launcher."
,lynchy46645,2011-04-06T02:47Z,nevermind the beta i have full retail games and arcade games all downloaded and put into my hdd and i will never be banned
,nycearthquake,2011-04-09T10:53Z,not working invalid file reupload
,Charbis,2011-04-13T02:40Z,"With language like ""Confirmed Rumour"" and well, the whole whingy paragraph its clear your a moron. Its impossible to ruin your USB with any of this crap, though your idiocy may find you a way with any luck. Foul mouthed little boy xD. 

Also, its now been said this file does not work. now tell me i was wrong to trust this early release from someone who clearly had no idea if it was going to work.

Idiot. 

Btw your mom says she wants you to watch your language xD."
,moshdude69,2011-04-19T21:05Z,"1. If you grabbed the Bulletstorm ""Epic Edition,"" you'll be able to get your hands dirty one week earlier, starting April 18. (Source: http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/04/gears-of-war-3-beta-bulletstorm-players-in-april-18-gamestop-p/)
So nobody has to worry about getting banned at this point.. There IS legit ones out there, I downloaded one yesterday and played the beta this morning, and it WAS only a 90 Mb or so file. When you put it on your xbox and run the beta it downloads the actual game. Stop whining and try it bitches."
,mezanation,2011-04-29T04:41Z,"whats the purpose of this? please let me know, obviously it works for most but what the hell is this for?"
