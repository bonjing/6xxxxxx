Wasting Light is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band Foo Fighters. It is set to be released on April 12, 2011, and is the band's first album in over three years. Although guitarist Pat Smear has performed live with the band since 2006, Wasting Light is the first album to feature him as an official member since 1997's The Colour and the Shape. The title is taken from the lyrics of the song "Miss the Misery". Guest musicians include Bob Mould and Krist Novoselic.
