,eyeb1,2011-04-03T09:53Z,"Let's see who should we believe ..
i'm sure we can trust the AMA and FDA to tell the truth .. right ..

the dollar value of pharmaceuticals covers by health care alone in the US .. $230 Billion dollars in 2008 ..

Fortune magazine ranked pharmaceuticals as the most profitable of all industries when measured by returns on equity, sales, and assets.

let's see something that can effectively treat some of the worst medical scourges for $20 a year who would that possibly threaten ..

the #5 cause of death in the US for 2007 .. Medical Malpractice .. usually by wrong or inappropriately proscribed drugs ..

,cta102,2011-04-05T20:30Z,"@eyeb, at best you are ignorant (the proper definition of the word) or more likely delusional.

Just because some guy makes a claim you believe him. BTW he has NO evidence (as anecdotes don't count as evidence).

Perhaps he is just mad and actually believes his claims (dangerous) but perhaps he is just simply lying"
,Ross_at_home2002,2011-05-04T18:56Z,"I am sad to hear that so many people write such fowl mouths stuff and spewing hatred out .Even one person  suggesting that the person who posted this download gets cancer of all thing ,just because he/she is making an effort to inform everyone of a potential idea that might or might not work. Free speech it what true democracy is all about . Not only that , what if it does work . I personally do not have Aids or/HIV or cancer but have taken it for 18 months with no bad side effects I can feel or measure  so far in all that time. Also I have not had to take any  time off work for colds or flu for the 1st time in my life for 18 months. I also got loads of good benefits that I cant list.
And no, I do not sell MMS. I am a IT engineer.
All I can confirm that it is worth keeping an open mind  in case you do get cancer Since  1 in 8 people get the big C in their lifetime . You might want to look into it.  who knows huh. .Remember the saying that the best inventions /ideas are the simple ones. Well this qualifies for simple and cheap. I have also taken the MMS2 for 6 months with no problems .Still ok and feeling better than ever. Please please try to keep the replies to something constructive in future."

,ramikaz,2011-10-28T01:34Z,"I can't download this for some reason.

And only a-holes are ignorant to disbelieve something new because they don't understand it. Remember what the Pope said about Copernicus, and the jews about Jesus? The ignorant hate new information."
,mindset7,2012-04-12T20:42Z,ragnarok and cta102 are disinfo trolls. They're making the same posts on a bunch of other posts that discuss health stuff.
