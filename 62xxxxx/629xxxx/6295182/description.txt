When his toy motorcycle is missing, 8 year old "Keith" discovers it in the waste basket of his bedroom in the hotel where he and his family are staying. As he reaches for the toy, a tiny figure nips at his hand. There's delight on "Keith's" face and in his voice as he spots a small mouse next to his toy motorcycle. "Keith" wonders out loud if the mouse is responsible for his toy having been moved. When the mouse, (named Ralph) responds, verbally chiding "Keith" to finish his thought, "Keith" is amazed that the mouse can talk! With no other children living at the hotel or even in the neighborhood, and being an only child, "Keith" quickly strikes up a friendship with "Ralph" and allows the mouse to ride his toy motorcycle around the bedroom as well as out in the hall of the hotel, which is just the first of a few adventures for "Ralph".
