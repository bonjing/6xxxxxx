cheers"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-05T10:37Z,"Wow--20-40's suggested method of seeding actually works! ;)
Just open the torrent and select the files you need, and de-select everything else--then select for the download location the folder where the Lost Girl (or whatever) episodes you already have are filed, and your bittorrent client will read from (and therefore seed) the files already there, even though you de-selected (skipped) them."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-05T10:58Z,"(I accidentally dumped episodes 01 & 02, which I had downloaded earlier from 20-40, so I thought I'd try his suggestion here.)"
,believenu,2011-04-05T15:13Z,"20-40 is a genus when it comes to this we all can learn something new everyday.. look at me! 
 As formerly_azrielle! says If you are just looking for some episodes and have the rest put them all in one folder( copy and paste title) and when you d/l it will ask which ones. deselect ones you don't want and it will reseed the others as well.. sharing for everyone."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-05T16:05Z,"Thank you. I helped  (just a little, hour maybe) first morning. I seeded from home, 'cause trackers in this torrent are not accepted by my fast server."

Hi, came here as suggested by good Mr. twentyforty (looking to take my lost girl from 82% to 100%). Though I can see on this page only 1 seed and 2 leech STILL will give a try.
BTW, 20-40 praise is not out of place, good work by you!!!"
,x5x5x7,2011-04-12T12:36Z,+1 too
,believenu,2011-04-16T07:43Z,"thank you who are sharing. I am going to bed now and will continue to seed.. How? you ask.. by just leaving computer on and letting torrent run.. I may not have fancy pancy lap top which you can leave plugged in and on at night.. but my ancient 75Gb has dsl line for internet ,, so even with no internet on I can sleep and share. for further suggestions and ways to share please see comments left on 20-40 south pacific and April..i think 14 or 13 daily tv pack.
Oh it doesn't cost much in electricity either a few cents a night.. maybe at most.. My bill never went up by even .50 cents when I got computer and went on line.. so no excuses there either"

My ""fancy-pansy laptop"" is an Intel Atom N-270 powered 10"" netbook with 250 GB HDD that I upgraded from 1 to 2 GB RAM.  Total outlay including HP wireless mouse and sales tax ~$325.  Which damn near broke me.  I leave on quite frequently, specifically to Force seed this torrent--mainly because I think Lost Girl deserves a wider audience, and hopefully I can make a small difference.  I also force seed an audio book of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, for much the same reason.  TwentyForty's incredibly compressed encoding helps immensely, of course.  I hope he finds a way to come back, btw.  My world is more depressing place without him."

I am not disparging anyones lap top..I find that some peeples find that it can be an excellent excuse not to seed.. ""I am not connected"" but I meant realy to say that those computers can be connected when plugged in at night...when they are in their ""home"" location.. 
gee... 2 gb ram ...I am cu#*#*ing my 256mb Ram and when I wins the lottery I am buying a lap top myself (I am joking, slightly sarcastic comment  but not to be taken seriously , realy). 
I am seeding all of twentyfortys that I have to try to help.Check his torrent, last day April 17.. I have put a request for his family (us) and maybe someone can help.. Thanks "
,believenu,2011-06-05T18:07Z,still seeding for all who share.
,bryentheartist,2011-08-29T06:40Z,is this show any good?
,formerly_azrielle,2011-09-06T08:49Z,"@bryentheartist
Well, it was good enough to be renewed for a second season, which began last night.  Yes it is THAT good--best supernatural series on television, in my opinion.  And VERY DIFFERENT story line."
,shedevil0223,2012-03-21T05:34Z,how can i dl this its not allowing me to connect
