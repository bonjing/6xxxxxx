Notes:

 - Already here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3545203/The_Killing_%28Stanley_Kubrick%29_-_Pal_Multilanguaje_Multisubs ) but unencoded at nearly 4GB, so here's a high-quality alternative at one-fifth the size
 
 - No Noir entry in the Pirate Bay Tag Cloud? ( http://thepiratebay.org/tags )

 - To use the subtitles, if necessary, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
