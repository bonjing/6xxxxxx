I have a question, why is it when there are, well on this download, 4 people who are seeding at 100%, only seed at either 1.2kb/s or not at all? My internet is capable of dling at 700kb/s and I know there isn't enough seeds for close to that, but shouldn't the seeders at 100% at least go faster than 1!? Sorry if it's a stupid question, I'm not too informed about this. Obviously lol"
