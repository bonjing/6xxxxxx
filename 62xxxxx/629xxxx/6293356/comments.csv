,SpottedMarley,2011-04-04T12:30Z,slicknick610 you are the man as always!! but I'd like to take a moment to bitch about CBS's lame ass supercross coverage. the who first half of this broadcast is all but completely useless bullshit. only brief highlights from the heat races? i hope they start giving the entire series to SPEED. CBS sucks donkey dick.
