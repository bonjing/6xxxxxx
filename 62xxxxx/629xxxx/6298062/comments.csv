It's a bit like Nazi Jews only more retarded. "
,MarsVoltaic,2011-04-08T16:51Z,"What makes it retarded? They're non-conformist, anti-authoritarian Muslims. Read up about Islam and you'll find it's a pretty hierarchy-less religion, for example. IMO this is exactly the kind of movement Islam needs, to help reform it from the inside out, getting away from all the militaristic, chauvinistic, etc. trends usually (and often wrongly) associated with it. Watch the documentary ""Taqwacore: The Birth of Punk Islam"" to see some people that were inspired to do in real life by the book this movie is based on, or get a compilation album of such musicians ""The Taqwacore Compilation"". Both are easily available here on TPB..."

You didn't just use the word ""non-conformist"" now did u...

Seriously, you have no idea what punk is/was  and comes from if you think religion has any place near it.

You can studies the Koran, Bible, Tanach, Brahman or whatever you fucking like.
Still it will not make u understand any more about punk. deRP..."

PLEASE, save the world any more of your misguided ideas about what it means to be ""punk."" Your attempt to speak with any kind of self given authority on the subject is as offensive as your ignorance or your inability to consistently spell out the word you.

""Punk"" has never been about exclusion based on an individual or groups ideals. At it's most basic level the whole point of it all is unity without borders. I'm sorry that is not a lesson they sell at Hot Topic."
