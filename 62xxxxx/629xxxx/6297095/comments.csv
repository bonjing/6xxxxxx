If you are afraid os an anti-virus interception just put a 1-digit number as a password to prevent A.V from scanning the inside and put a comment inside the zip file so that anyone knows the password when he opens the file.

But really your way of zipping such a small software is nasty and s-t-u-p-i-d. You make us think you are a noob and know little in computing."
