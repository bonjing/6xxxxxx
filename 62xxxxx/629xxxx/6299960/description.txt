                Campus is a brand new comedy set in the hotbed of
                academic mediocrity that is Kirke University. At its
                helm is the stubby, mercurial Vice Chancellor Jonty
                de Wolfe, who wants nothing more than to drench Kirke
                in the juices of his own greatness with the support
                of his academic team, starring Joseph Millson, Lisa
                Jackson, Jonathan Bailey, Sara Pascoe, Will
                Adamsdale, Dolly Wells and Katherine Ryan. In the
                first episode, According to Vice Chancellor Jonty De
                Wolfe, Kirke University's bank balance and academic
                reputation both need a bit of a boost. Reactions to
                this news from members of staff range from
                nonchalance to panic, but Jonty, titillated by his
                mousy Maths Lecturer Imogen Moffat's success insists
                all the staff take a leaf out of her best-selling
                book.
