,chmcke01,2011-04-19T21:36Z,"What do the (J), (U), (E), etc stand for? "
,MonkeyManCoco,2011-04-24T01:16Z,"Region.
J = Japan
U = USA
E = EU

It's fairly standard naming for roms."

,Jimb0b,2011-06-13T13:00Z,"@tlouey7 acekard or r4i? you say you have both.

for the acekard use akaio 1.8.7 firmware and those games should work fine.
for the r4i just use the latest firmware avaiable,don't know if those games will work with the r4i as i don't have one but they should"
,pw3uk54,2011-07-03T23:25Z,"I've tried a bunch of these with Acecard2 with the latest Akaio software (that can be downloaded from acecard.com).
Most seem to work great. A couple are problematic (Inazuma Eleven and the Black/White Pokemons), but on the whole there is plenty to be playing here (deBlob2 is fantastic!).
Thanks for compiling the zip and cheers to those who've been seeding!"

,mrozer,2011-12-02T20:47Z,"ATTENTION DSTT/DSTTi/TTDS OWNERS:

You cannot load these roms using the default firmware provided by the manufacturer of the cards... since they no longer support their own products, and therefore have not bothered to update the firmware since late 2009 - early 2010 (Yet ironically they still make and sell the cards). 

This means that if you are using the firmware from the original manufacturer, then games released after early 2010 will likely not work!

Fortunately there is now a solution!:
I though I was out of luck and that I had to go another route, but just a few weeks ago I stumbled on a website that still supports (i.e. makes new firmware) for the TT line of cards.

Get the latest firmwares here:
http://www.r4wood.com/pages/TTi-DSTT-Kernel.html

They also provide other tools, such as a program that will decrypt encrypted roms (I've noticed it will encrypt games that are already unlocked, so only try this for games that don't work for you). And they also provide a program that will fully format cards to alleviate some buried errors. 

On a final note... Please support this website so that they will continue to provide updates for the TT line... you can do so buy buying their cards and sending them your gratitude."
,loshpop,2011-12-03T14:54Z,"Thanks for the upload xx

All the games i put on my dstt card work perfectly. Really over the moon. Cant thank you enough xx Will seed for as long as i can."
,rezarf82,2011-12-29T11:10Z,"do i have to unzip these or change the file name from 7z to nds??

As i dont want to download all the games just some of them."
,supermario5029,2012-03-17T10:39Z,R.I.P .torrent files
,Hunksoffunk2,2012-04-11T11:29Z,Thanks.
,TECOMO,2012-04-29T18:16Z,Very nice torrent but most of the file names need to be change since they are too long and if load them it says file too long. Anyone having this problem just rename the file to less than 80 characters.
,TECOMO,2012-04-29T18:25Z,For all of you having trouble just rename the files to shorter names. As short as one you have working already
