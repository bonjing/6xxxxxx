,320hunter,2011-04-06T00:20Z,"@ iceache 
I do not know what you mean. But buying the album worth its weight in gold :)"
[T],PeteSapai,2011-04-06T04:35Z,"lol, looks like someone found out how to upvote his torrent every half hour or so :p
Anyway, this sounds good, doesnt look like a reencode. Also: thanks for those live vids!"
,oh5srt4,2011-04-07T01:14Z,"Quality is ok, notice quite a bit of distortion in the bass."
,jone1,2011-04-07T14:34Z,"Quality is not ok, distortion in the bass. "
,adimifus,2011-04-07T17:05Z,"This version looks (waveform) and sounds like someone cranked up the volume on it before encoding it. 

This version looks and sounds a LOT better:

Its still pretty loud, but you can instantly tell its not nearly as squashed and flat sounding."
,spiaggio,2011-04-08T21:18Z,"Sound straight clippy-shitty, download another release!"
,cheborneck,2011-04-10T07:49Z,fantastic quality thx

,toolarmy1,2011-04-11T13:11Z,"On one hand, I really want to buy this album, because I love this band...

On the other hand, I have no job and no money...

Fuck, forgive me Grohl... "
,Lhoup,2011-04-11T13:35Z,Quality is not OK at all. People upvoting this are deaf.
,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-04-11T15:50Z,"Terrible rip.  I know Foo records are brickwall mastered for maximum loudness/lack of dynamics so they sound good on headphones, but never so much that everything is distorted, which can clearly be seen by opening any track in a good wave editor.

Avoid!  Most seeders doesn't mean best torrent."
,HMD3,2011-04-12T17:18Z,"For those who don't know, maybe the audio quality is because of how it was recorded, in Grohl's garge on tape, Yes, f'n cassette tape. He didn't want to do it all digitally this time, he wanted a fresh ""raw"" sound."
,sanriver,2011-04-12T23:35Z,320hunter pathetic loser. get a life.
,timppi,2011-04-13T16:20Z,"yeah.. the needles on my audiointerface won't even move while playing this, they're at max throughout. THE POOREST RIP."
[T],PeteSapai,2011-04-13T18:41Z,"@HMD3 (and all others still calling this 'high quality' or 'real rip'): just download one of the actual real rips (like the one I uploaded, or the flac release floating around on TPB) and compare the quality. After that, I bet you'll never touch these files again."
,ngo33,2011-04-13T19:15Z,hey! Thank so much!

,mrbean1905,2011-04-21T22:28Z,I don't know if most of you have hearing problems. This is bad quality. If you want to test it just download the White Limo song and crank it up a little on your PC or iPod. You'll see...
,wheelyking,2011-04-23T15:32Z,"Not impressed with the quality of this rip at all, for a guitar metal head its great lots of guitar, however cant make out the vocals at all, after playing ""rope"" and comparing quality against a previous file i have, the difference in sound is like night and day."
,chris1959,2011-04-23T16:31Z,Dank je wel Gast .

,Paranoia187,2011-05-09T22:03Z,I downloaded this and it sounds like there is static noise in the background. Almost like the uploader ruined it on purpose by amplifying the sound volume.
,jamieclarko,2011-05-12T19:58Z,The quality is 320kbps BUT the volume GAIN is way to high

,theAe3boomer,2011-06-10T03:38Z,"DUMB ASS DOWNLOADERS!! ATTENTION

The foo fighters decided to keep this album pure retro, and before mass producing on cd the recorded EVERY SONG ON CASSETTE TAPE (you might have known this if you actually decided to by the album, alot of people got peices of the magnetic ribbon in their cd cases) so THIS IS CASSETTE QUALITY, taking up 320 kb of data per each second of a track, so all that 'bad quality' is ACTUAL quality. fuckin dumbasses. (this might actually be why there are 3000+ downloaders and only 40 whiney ass complaing audiophiles"

,zapho,2011-06-13T12:07Z,I agree with the majority here - very fuzzy quality. Just check out the foos website and listen to the clips to hear the difference. 
,Flipsydez,2011-06-18T18:01Z,"Why does this sound like it was youtube ripped, Altho im sure youtube version sounds slightly better..."
,hacky02,2011-07-31T18:15Z,good torrent thanks 320hunter
,Guncho,2011-08-08T01:07Z,Sounds distorted.
,metalracket,2011-08-25T10:40Z,Dont download! sound is distorted and shit!
,LOLerDude,2011-09-09T00:59Z,"All you idiots complaining about bad quality rip should read up on the 'loudness war'. This album is shit (even if it's a good rip) because the dynamic range of the songs was destroyed by the dick that mastered them (probably because a dick CEO or marketer told the guy to)(just load the song in Audacity and you will see a some solid walls of blue). Luckily, there is a vinyl version of the album to download (yes, torrent) with the dynamic range of the songs mostly intact.

Info on the 'loudness war': http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordOfLoudnessWar

I have a sub + amps + good speakers in my car and my sister was playing the other upload of this album (320 kbps, that I downloaded) and my ears were screaming ""THIS  IS FUCKING SHIT QUALITY"", and I thought I had downloaded a 128 kbps version. Boy was I surprised when I checked and saw 320. As a comparison, RATMs 'Bulls on Parade' was crystal clear in my car. My sister felt jyped (and she hadn't even payed for the album). Hence why I've D/Led the vinyl version."
,mommaivy,2011-09-24T05:58Z,"Seriously.. download this too. Great ep from a new hard rock band. I hope to see them live one day..
also, this new Foo is pretty fk'badass.

,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:11Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramp is FANTASTIC ripping software!"

,Kilotone,2011-11-10T08:29Z,"HiroPro2 dude go knock yourself out with your VBR, joint stereo rubbish.

What are you listening to your media player with $15 earphones?

Don't suppose you've listened to any classical/flac/direct vinyl rips have you? Try doing ANY of those with your silly joint stereo on VBR & see how far you fail LMAO.

*deathly warble warps*

VBR is dead & gone brother get over it, get a media player that supports flac/lossless & an external HDDif your worried about file size!

May i suggest you keep your junk/opinions to yourself. Honestly where's your info coming from half a decade ago? Keep learning man! (may i suggest outside of google LMAO)"
