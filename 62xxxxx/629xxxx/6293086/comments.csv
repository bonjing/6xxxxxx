,kchase77,2011-04-04T13:57Z,"Original Danish series is fantastic! See it first or watch them simultaneously and judge. Have not seen any of the American one so cannot say. I have the Danish copy of Season 2 posted here with English subs, so check that out too. "

I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but the beginning was bad quality video."
,thorofdenmark,2011-04-04T17:54Z,NOT 720!!!
,sharkcutter,2011-04-05T05:30Z,Interesting show but horrible quality. Looks like AMC's error. Terrible compression on picture and sound. Background atmos surges over dialogue.

,dfuse,2011-04-06T03:31Z,Excellent show!! I was very impressed. Hooked already.
,dfuse,2011-04-06T03:32Z,Quality was ok. I am not going to complain over something I didn't pay for nor made any effort ripping off TV. CTU does a great job and I appreciate all the effort they put into it.
