I had seen this movie around and wrongly assumed because of its name that it was a bollywood movie and ""not for me"" but low and behold its a wes anderson movie, fantastic cheers nearly let it pass me by again!

,DLSteve,2011-04-05T13:07Z,"20-40, I would like to say thank you for your diligent work, I'm sure the community appreciates it very much.

I would like to ask you a question tho, with your movies I seem to get a recurring problem, about 80% through I get a stuttering with the audio, and it then goes out of sinc, this usually makes watching the movie unpleasant.

""The Abyss"" stopped just after 2 hours and stalls there. ""

""The Town"" stutters almost at the end, then the audios gone.

I use the same setup as you, LED Tv with external HDD connected via USB.

Some advice would be appreciated. I would like to believe it is just me. Thank you twenty-fourty"
,r-0987,2011-04-05T15:06Z,"just wanted to know if you took my request of empire of the sun? Anyway, this is great! could you upload the short prequel - Hotel Chevalier (2007) "
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-05T16:00Z,"@brat534: Sorry, ep.1 was re-upped once because most people missed download. It is too old now.
Camelot is in the schedule, from episode one.

@r-0987: How do you expect from me to accept your request by showing negligence 'par exellance'?

@DLSteve: Your playback system is bad. Use ""Recommended"" one from the link in Long Header of my torrents frequently. My MP4 are faultless and error-free."
