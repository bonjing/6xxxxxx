I just can't put less than 5 stars to a DEEP PURPLE album.Of course Slaves and Masters is far behind Machine head or In rock or Stormbringer but is still a great album.
Joe Lynn Turner-on vocals on this album-sings like he has never sing before, the music is much stronger than on Rainbow's turner era and he pushes his voice to the limits, coming sometimes close to Coverdale.Slaves and masters suffers from a typically 90's production-Ian Paice's drumming lacks the famous ghosts notes, which makes it more rigid.
STill SLAVES grooves hard with FIRE IN THE BASEMENT ,BREAKFAST IN BED, rocks hard with THE CUT RUNS DEEP or WICKED WAYS and puts you in magical moods with KING OF DREAMS, LOVE CONQUERS ALL,...
Some might say it's more of a RAINBOW album than a DP, well then it's the best Rainbow album since Rising!
This break in MARK 2 was not in vain, it prepared the come back of GILLAN for the final Mark 2 BATTLE RAGES ON album and gave us the chance to hear songs like BURN performed by DP in the 90's on stage.
The more I write about this album, the more I remember it and the more I want to listen to it and if you still want to hear an album 11 years after its release, it sure means it is a good one.
