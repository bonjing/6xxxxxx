,docmatrix,2011-04-12T06:58Z,"@r4fay94: This one isn't compressed. Many PS2 games require the entire disc be filled, the blank spaces compress (RAR/ZIP) well.

@JkPuxa: Why the ASCII gibberish and all the backslashes in the description?"
,JkPuxa,2011-04-13T09:57Z,"Sorry about that i tried to use  ""Quotes"" and it apered like that.

Sorry"
