- African American Historian Manning Marable Dies Days Before Publication of His Biography of Malcolm X

Renowned African American historian Manning Marable passed away on Friday at the age of 60, just days before the publication of his life's work, a monumental biography about Malcolm X. Two decades in the making, Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention is described as a reevaluation of Malcolm X's life. We play excerpts from when Amy Goodman interviewed Marable in 2005 and 2007 about the chapters missing from Malcolm X's autobiography and the groups implicated in his assassination.


- "Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention": Manning Marable's New Biography Investigates Conflicted Reality of the Civil Rights Leader

Two decades in the making, Manning Marable's nearly 600-page biography, Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention, is described as a reevaluation of Malcolm X's life, providing new insights into the circumstances of his assassination, as well as raising questions about Malcolm X's autobiography. Manning passed away on Friday, just days before his life's work was published. To discuss his legacy we're joined by Michael Eric Dyson, sociology professor at Georgetown University and author of Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X, and also by Bill Fletcher, Jr., a friend of Marable and a longtime labor and racial justice activist. "There were three different sources that had an interest in Malcolm's death, and that's where [the book] becomes very important," Fletcher says. "It was the police and FBI, the Nation of Islam, and also people in his own organization that resented the trajectory that he was moving in. So there was a confluence of sources that led to a situation where he was permitted to be killed. I think when people read this, it will be an incredible eye opener."


- Judge Goldstone Retracts Part of His Report on Israeli Assault on Gaza, Leaves Rest Intact

The lead author of The Goldstone Report on the 2008-2009 Israeli assault on Gaza has backtracked on one of his key findings. In an editorial run Friday by the Washington Post, Judge Richard Goldstone said, "Civilians were not intentionally targeted [by Israel] as a matter of policy." Now Israel has called on the United Nations to retract the report on the devastating war that led to the death of about 1,400 Palestinians, including hundreds of civilians, and 13 Israelis. To discuss the implications of Judge Goldstone's position, we are joined by Adam Horowitz and Lizzy Ratner. They are co-editors of an abridged version of U.N. investigation, titled, The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict. "The judge only comments on one small part of the report," Horowitz says, "which I take as an implication that the rest of the report stays intact and he is still in support of that."
