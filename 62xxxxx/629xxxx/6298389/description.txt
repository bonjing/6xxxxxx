When I originally downloaded this in CBR format, the file was 220 megabytes. Way too big for a 2 color (black & white) book even if it is 220 pages. 

I extracted all the pages, compressed and repacked them into CBR format and also converted it to PDF. The ComixBook format is 87 megs and the PDF is 130 megs. One of the reasons I converted to PDF is it is much easier to scan to a different section than stepping through the pages one at a time, as my CBR reader requires, and some people may just prefer PDF. 

I love Robert Crumb's work and this one is as good as any, if not as risque. I just ordered this book in hardback from a major online seller for $17. (I won't say who so this won't sound like and advertisement.) If you enjoy Mr. Crumbs work, I urge you to purchase this or something else of his (if anything else is even available.) He was never really compensated for what he has produced over all these years.
