,Tazadar3,2011-04-06T09:01Z,"frenchmichaels, i do belive it must have something to do with your comp/media player or something. 33 other peeps are seeding and no complains, ive just dl`d it myself and it works nicly. "
[T],trialNerror,2011-04-06T11:13Z,"Hey frenchmichaels, which player are you using?  I check to make sure my videos play before uploading them by using Media Player Classic, VLC, Windows Media Player, and the PS3.  Playback is fine with all of them."
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-04-06T13:59Z,Thank you kindly trialNerror. You rock and I can always count on you for GHost Hunters and Destination Truth. Thanks!
,Nickyboy7,2011-04-06T21:36Z,"It does work, I have noticed the sound is a bit low on my PS3, but I just turn it up a bit. Picture is great though"
[T],trialNerror,2011-04-07T07:31Z,"You're right, Nick.  NO idea why it would do that since the volume on the PC playback is fine.  The volume is normal when streaming through TVersity as well.  But when put on a thumb drive or CD and played on the PS3, the volume is reduced.  *scratches head*  Hellifiknow.   But opening the video control panel (press Triangle) and set the Volume Control up to +3 or 4, it's just fine."
