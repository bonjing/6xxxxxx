Hiya everyone.

A few of you might have seen my scan of The Scorpion 1, or maybe even know that it has also been scanlated.
For those of you that do not know The Scorpion, this is what its all about:

The story takes place in Rome during the second half of the eighteenth century. Cardinal Trebaldi decides to reinstate the power of the nine families, based on papacy. Armando Catalano, also known as The Scorpion, is a holy relics dealer. He is the son of a heretic who was burnt alive for misdirecting a priest from the church and Christian beliefs. Armando, the bearer the Mark of the Devil, a birthmark in the shape of a scorpion, will challenge the cardinals authority. The cardinal, who seems to be filled with hatred for The Scorpion, sends a young gypsy specialized in poisons to kill him.

The adventures of the Scorpion lead him to the treasure of the Templars and to discover an interpretation of what might have happened to it. Between fiction and history, this comic distills Machiavellian theory on religious authority.


Since i finally got my The Scorpion 2 back from decencoring today, i figured i would make a pack of all the Scorpion goodness, so you can all enjoy it.

So here you go, this pack includes the following:
The Scorpion 1-4, Cinebook version. The two first are double books, so this cover 1-6 of the french version.
The Scorpion 1-9, scanlation version.
