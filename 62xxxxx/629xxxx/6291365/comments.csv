The color is a bit off but very watchable. Audio not that bad. Great job. Thanks again, in addition I enjoyed the ending.  V/A/M=7's.  I was surprised this did not have heads popping up or much background noises as many cams. "

""axxo has his own site @ axxomovies.org""

I checked that site and I'm guessing it's not the real aXXo someone just using his good name.  I checked some torrents on there and came across some movies from NOIR that were R5 releases.  So that right there tells me it isn't the real aXXo's site. Doubt he would be uploading someone else's torrents.  Plus he never uploaded any R5's only Dvd rips.  Don't believe check for yourself.   http://axxomovies.org/?p=3016#more-3016"

Definitley not an aXXo release.  Someone isn't being truthful about something.

Quick google search and I found.""That is not the real aXXo btw. Like most legends, there are always imitators due to flattery.""

Just what I suspected.  If you download from that site regularly how do you not figure it out on your own?

Search google about TS! 

If you a download a TS in Top 100 from a Trusted or VIP, of course you'll get a TS Quality! Morons!

A telesync (TS)[1] is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often with a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth (but the video is often just cam video), with a direct connection to the sound source (often an FM microbroadcast provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater).
