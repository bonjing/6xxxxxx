Episode Two

With a second girl reported missing, police take in another suspect. Given a troubling track record, it is essential that Laure Berthaud keeps her team under control, but how easy will that be when her own grip is starting to slip? Public prosecutor Pierre Clement pays the price for refusing to cave in to pressure from above, Judge Roban's investigation into possible curruption also causes discomfort in high places and ambitious barrister Josephine Karlsson also finds herself the target of an act of vengeance.
