Bio: MONTâ€“DIG Born Monty Travelle Thompson in 
Akron, OH has been writing and rhyming since 
the 4th grade. He went from Schumacher 
Elementary bathroom freestyles to being a mix 
tape Phenomenon. The name Dig was 
adopted from his Uncle Byron. Byron heard 
about Montâ€™s lyrical talent, and the first words 
out of his mouth after three bars was â€œDamn 
you goodâ€. The word â€œyouâ€ was replaced with 
â€œIâ€ creating the â€œDIGâ€ in Mont-DIG.
