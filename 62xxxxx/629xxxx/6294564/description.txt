Digitally remastered two-fer
containing a pair of albums from
the R&B great: Clyde and Rock &
Roll. Clyde McPhatter was one of
the greatest R&B and Pop singers
during the 50s and 60s, and a
huge influence on the evolution of
American music. During his heyday,
his name and voice loomed so much
larger than that of the group The
Drifters, which he founded, that it
took five years for them to recover
from his departure. He is regarded
as one of the top lead singers of
all time and the second most
popular black male vocalist of the
50s, behind Fats Domino. Clyde was
a very strong influence on the Soul
era that followed his prominence in
the music business. His remarkable
high tenor influenced everyone from
Jackie Wilson and Smokey Robinson
to Aaron Neville. Also, Clyde was
there during the very early days of
Rock n' Roll and made significant
contributions to building it into
the commercial success that it
became.
