This is a fix pack for those of you who've been downloading the torrents of 100 roms from here. It includes 115 roms that have been propered since they were originally released in packs on thepiratebay by Joda, Farnorth, ND6 and emuparadise.

In most cases these roms were propered for minor issues such as the original was trimmed or had an intro. The files in the other packs are just fine if you have them already this is for collectors only who want to have a perfect collection.

With this pack you should be able to match the first 5500 roms to advanscene release list as of April 3, 2011.

All roms are packaged the way Joda used to do it, so they are 7zipped and include the cover art for the games as well as the release nfos.
