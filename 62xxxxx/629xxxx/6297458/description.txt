Shadow Harvest Phantom Ops-SKIDROW
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops (c) Viva Media

05-04-2011........Release Date <-> Protection...............Steam
FPS..................Game Type <-> Disk(s)..................1 DVD

Features:

When a covert operation to stop illegal arms sales reveals a full-scale
global conspiracy, a special unit under the codename SHADOW HARVEST is
formed to reveal the truth.

With two completely different characters serving as the unit's
operation core, you must choose from a vast array of weapons and
technologies that enhance both characters strengths.

Features a gripping storyline that unfolds organically through the
gameplay (doesn't rely on cutscenes to move the story along). The ratio
of gameplay to cutscenes is better than 13:1.

Players can switch between the two main characters at any time during
the game to take advantage of each characterâ€™s strength as well as
combat a sophisticated AI that adapts to the strategies you develop.

Open level design and option secondary objectives leave the outcome
completely up to the player to choose.
