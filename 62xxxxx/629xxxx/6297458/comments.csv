,Baytime11,2011-04-06T11:28Z,"Nice upload as always. 
However it's a terrible game. Infact, I did not even finish it.  
Bad movement, story, gameplay, optimization, voice acting ( there's even spelling/grammar errors ), etc..

10/10 Torrent quality
3/10 Overall game"

,SorrowExe,2011-04-06T22:42Z,"Just play Crysis 2 guys, best graphics and gameplay in a long time."
,RiCo1829,2011-04-06T23:14Z,all i get is black screen no videos no graffics just sound and the graffics everywhere else except the game and videos
,Nemesis1141,2011-04-06T23:28Z,"I get a Windows error when i try to start the game, can enyone help???"
,berain666,2011-04-07T01:51Z,"Just like Nemesis, I am getting the 'Shadow harvest has stopped working' windows crash error.  Even when I run as admin.  I have tried several times, and most other games have worked for me.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?  Let me know if there is a fix!  

My PC fits the specs... Q6600 quadcore 2.4 geforce gtx 275, 4 G ram, windows vista home prem."
,dirte1,2011-04-07T07:56Z,"hey guys i keep gettin a error that says ""create render failed"" never seen this before any help"
,darkpat,2011-04-07T14:23Z,"After the intro, when you drive to the market i allways get the same error, 
runtime error: the aplication requested the runtime to terminate in an unusual way.
The the game crashes. I updated all drivers and physx and vcredist, i also uninstalled the game and installed it again, tried both versions, this one and the KAOS Version but all the same.
Any solutions 4 that Prob? would be nice
THX"
,spox2000,2011-04-07T16:27Z,"found a fix for the has stopped working guys:P unistall the game,reinstall it and copy only the sh.exe file to youre game dir:D   ONLY sh.exe not the skidrow.ini steam_api.dll and steamclient.dll the las 3 dont copy!!!:D works like a charm:D"
,maidensebbe,2011-04-07T19:34Z,I also get a Windows error when i try to start the game. i tried spox2000 solution but it doesn't work. my steam start instead. 
,maidensebbe,2011-04-07T19:37Z,i tried spox2000 solution it doesn't work. steam starts instead. 
,ArkAngel666,2011-04-08T08:03Z,holy shit this game is crap... the controls (i.e movement and such) and the game in general is just utterly appalling.
,ArkAngel666,2011-04-08T08:04Z,@demon24 i think you'll find thats just the game itself... it is poorly made.
,ArkAngel666,2011-04-08T08:05Z,ha @Baytime11 i think i got about 5 minutes in to it and stopped... the game just isnt worth it.
,Yenrock7,2011-04-08T16:18Z,"I wasted almost 4GB time of download for this crappy game. Crysis runs smooth but this? It lags even at 640x800! @spox2000 I got the error so i did what you said, but the game is very lag."
,BlackMoth,2011-04-08T18:47Z,this game it alright if you have 3 x 590GTX gpus :/
,Nocturnalis,2011-04-08T23:25Z,Don't waste your time downloading this game. You would get more enjoyment watching fuzzy mold grow on a fucking TURD than you would playing this SHIT PILE of a game. 
,DangerDan43257,2011-04-09T11:57Z,"this game is rubbish, but if your just wanting to see for yourself i would download this version as its alot smaller http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6299636/Shadow.Harvest.Phantom.Ops.FullRip-KaOs"

Working 100 % !
Thank you ! 

How the hell did you get it to work?

I put the crack in but it keeps on showing the message.

The application has failed to start because the application confiruration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

This is the same on the other download of this from SKIDROW."

THAT'S EXTREMEZONE AND SKIDROW!"
,berain666,2011-04-10T05:18Z,"So I am just curious.. for the people that actually got this game to work, and didn't automatically get the 'has stopped working' message, do you use steam?  I'm wondering if this could be part of the problem..."
,berain666,2011-04-11T18:20Z,"Eor in regards to: no i dont use steam. i simply installed it and copied the crack files over and it works perfectly.

i also have no lag whatsoever at max settings. i can only assume the people complaining have low quality computers for gaming.

I think you're missing the point of what I am saying.. first off, my computer specs are far from top notch, but they more than match what is needed for this game, as per my previous post if you look back a bit.  Secondly, what I was trying to say, is that the crack seems to be causing a problem for those of us that DO have Steam already installed on our PC's.  So I guess I was wondering if anyone that has steam installed is able to play this game, and if so, what are your PC specs and what did you have to do to make it work if anything?  Thanks!
