,onli.temporary,2011-04-18T03:06Z,Great quality! Sound volume is a bit low and it echoes slightly though (or is that just me?).

,Caspi,2011-04-19T08:31Z,"If you are using PowerDVD to view this in 3d, it has a tendency to shift the images incorrectly when in side by side. Its possible that is the line you are refering too. Recommend using Nvidia's Free 3d Nvision Player. "

,sahadipa,2011-05-30T13:36Z,"I got LG cinema 3d TV.When i play your file, it throws an error ""File is invalid"".please advise is there any conversion require to play?

Thanks for upload anyways dude!"
,Caspi,2011-06-24T13:27Z,"I am unfamiliar with how LG Cinema 3d creates the 3d image. Or how you are playing the file on the TV. This file is actually a very wide video with two frames in a single wideshot. Example being 3840x1080p. The left image portrays the left eye and the right image portrays the right eye. With Nividia 3d vision it splits this image and interlaces it together and uses the shutter glasses to seperate the images. Nvidia uses SIDE by SIDE images. SONY and the PS3 use a TOP and BOTTOM image, so it wouldn't work with those. I am sorry that I am unfamiliar with your particular TV. The file is good though. You don't even need a 3d TV to see the DOUBLE image I am talking about either. Anyone could download it and see the SIDE by SIDE frames. I really did attempt to make this comment as simple and not confusing as possible."
