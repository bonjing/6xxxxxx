GTA is made up of a series of levels, each set in one of the three main
cities. In each level, the player's ultimate objective is to reach a
target number of points, which is typically achieved by performing tasks
for the city's local crime syndicate. Each level has its own unique set of
tasks. Successful completion of a mission rewards the player with points
and opens the opportunity to attempt harder missions for higher rewards,
while failure awards few points and may permanently seal off opportunities
for more tasks.
