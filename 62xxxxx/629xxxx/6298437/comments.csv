A lot of people downloaded this torrent and they do not respond about any viruses.
May be antivirus that you have is crap and detects false virus.

I was scan it by two antiviruses.  nod32 and Kaspersky Anti-Virus reported no virus.

THERE IS NO VIRUS!"

,Zukozx,2011-06-06T10:53Z,"I did it for protect from admin slowhacking! 

- Slowhacking is the process whereby Server Admins attempt to either punish misbehaving or cheating players or abusively mis-configure any player's keyboard and game control settings. This is only on servers that run AdminMod and AMXMod, and they usually give you a warning when you join the server that they can execute commands on your client.

You can unmark ReadOnly flag on file cstrike\config.cfg and save will be work again.

Or first can try on console:
developer 1
save your options and settings.
After set back developer 0 to protect yourself."
