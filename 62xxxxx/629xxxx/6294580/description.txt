Kaixo, Hello, Sali ZÃ¤mÃ¤ !!!

Another release from my mother\'s CD collection. Today it\'s Coolio\'s \"It Takes A Thief\" album in .flac, cover scans,cue,log and m3u are included.

And here is some REAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
This is the one and only way how to prepare the real Marianito preparao as it has to be on sunday morning after church:
Give about five or six ice cubes into a jar
now a litlle hint of Angostura over the ice (0,5 cl)
add some fine quality gin and Red CuraÃ§ao (1cl of each)
now add Martini Rosso (10cl)
stir it , NEVER AND IN NO WAY THINK ABOUT SHAKING HIM !!!!!!
pour it with filtering the ice into two cocktailglasses
add a piece of orange skin lightly pressed over each of the Marianitos preparaos.
Enjoy with some Olives or caracoliÃ±os. And thank the lord that you are so lucky to live in Bilbao, the center of the universe where they make the best of them. AMEN


Please don\'t be upsetted if the download may take a while: I can only upload with a speed of about 200 KBit/s. Blame Euskaltel and or the basque and especially the spanish government for it !!!!!

Have also a look on other torrents I\'ve posted and feel free to place a comment or a feedback. I would be very glad about. Eskerrik asko ! Thank you!
