Dr. John burst into the popular consciousness in the late `60s with the release of Gris Gris: The Night Tripper, an album that saw the gifted multi-instrumentalist filtering his years of experience as a New Orleans session player through the cracked lens of the psychedelic era. Though that album's dark blend of New Orleans rhythms and outrÃ© production techniques made it a `60s counter-culture favorite, it drew from a much more venerable set of musical traditions. On 1992's Goin' Back To New Orleans, Dr. John takes his audience on a guided tour of New Orleans jazz and r&b, assaying memorable covers of beloved standards like W.C. Handy's "Careless Love" and more obscure numbers like Jelly Roll Morton's "I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say." Dr. John and his accompanists, including a plethora of New Orleans music luminaries, give these numbers compelling and authoritative readings. This album is a fascinating slice of New Orleans history that also sheds light on the origins of Dr. John's inimitable aesthetic.

Recorded at Ultrasonic Studios, New Orleans, Louisiana.
