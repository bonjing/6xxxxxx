,BloodnBonez,2011-04-05T11:21Z,How is it people? At least say thanks.
,n00bOfTheTorrents,2011-04-05T14:04Z,Comin' In Hot has different lyrics than in the one I leaked O_o I guess that's why they call it a leak.
,BloodnBonez,2011-04-05T14:15Z,really? o.O i didn't notice..
,Preverse,2011-04-05T17:31Z,"Yeah, there were two different versions of the song, the album and the harder to find one with Funny Man's verse. I just downloaded my pre-order and am listening now. I also downloaded this torrent because my pre-order didn't have the 2 bonus instrumentals or Street Dreams for some reason, when it should've. Oh well. Nice upload, fast. Thanks!"
,n00bOfTheTorrents,2011-04-05T18:00Z,"The only store in this piece of shit town that sells music isn't going to carry the deluxe edition! Assholes. Anyone that was looking forward to my MP3@320, I'm sorry, but it doesn't look like it's possible.

Either way, I deleted my torrent as this is higher quality."
,BloodnBonez,2011-04-05T18:29Z,Grrrrr wtf! >.< i'm ordering the deluxe edition from best buy today and getting it shipped priority mail. Hopefully someone will have it up today. Pleeeaaassseeeeee!
