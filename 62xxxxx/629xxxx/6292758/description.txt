I want to start a band with Mike Portnoy. I live on Long Island. I just registered on his forum and will be making a thread there with all this when approved. Please stop by to support the movement if and when you see my thread! 

I will push Portnoy to play the best he has ever done in his life! I firmly believe this to be true! 

Enjoy and thank you so much for your time!
