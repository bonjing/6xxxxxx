From Amazon.com:

Welder - Vines & Stream Welder\\\'s debut downtempo album combines organic broken beats with urban and world flavors. Welder has been compared to the likes of Moby and The Orb and in our view brings whole new elements of flavor to the table. This is the kind of album that you\\\'ll grow to love the more you hear it.
