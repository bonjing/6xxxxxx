,Redt0rrent,2011-04-04T22:24Z,"Not recommended for Split Tracks this torrent. If you are looking for the full CD With Front, Back, CD Covers, and Split Tracks, wait for my Release, as it will be full from the CD legit bought from Ministry of Sound official website"
,phoenix61,2011-04-05T00:19Z,Rather wait for split tracks :) Don't support the people that upload one file for the entire disc :) They must learn to stop :) 
,RiPPER-D,2011-04-05T01:03Z,why have the cue files been removed from this? original release had cue files!
