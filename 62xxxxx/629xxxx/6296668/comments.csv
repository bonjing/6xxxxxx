,foxhunter310,2011-04-05T16:33Z,if anyone thinks this is too small to be both. i got news for ya. it is the setups for both games. i have both installed on my netbook running windows 7 home premium. it doesnt need the disks. so if you say it asks for disks shove it up ur ass. not trying to be mean. ive downloaded for 3 years now. ive seen comments like... it says needs disks. while i got it to run. so plz enjoy these classic games
