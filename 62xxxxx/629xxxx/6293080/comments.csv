,Flux83,2011-04-04T07:17Z,So what kind of quality is this? You say it's from a live stream. If it's not HD I won't bother. Would rather wait for a better release.
,mckay331,2011-04-04T07:23Z,what quality is the n2k?

,tamnja,2011-04-04T07:41Z,"n2kmaster, I was wondering if the entire contents of the torrent has been downloaded off you, no seeds, but percentage keeps going up. So should I just keep going because the whole thing is out there, despite no seeds?"
,str8jktmn,2011-04-04T07:45Z,Thanks n2k. Nice to have someone on the ball.

,troycook8,2011-04-04T08:23Z,does it show it between each match as well or just the matches and thats it. In between matches is a must see as we all know thats where the exciitement and tongue in cheek occurs
,ferd64,2011-04-04T08:32Z,1.4kb dl / 500kb ul.....wtf???
,ghost_24,2011-04-04T08:33Z,Uploading at 200k+....SEED PEOPLE!!!
,ghost_24,2011-04-04T08:34Z,@bonesun    you dont need to finish downloading the whole file to seed...

,str8jktmn,2011-04-04T08:48Z,"As many peers as there are on this file the download should go a bit faster. C'mon guys, loosen up your upload rates!
I have mine set to unlimited. This is really pissing me off. I'm uploading at 250-300kbps and the best I can get out of you is 10kbps or less?"
,shauny0118,2011-04-04T08:48Z,seed please im seeding at unlimited an will do till its 100% at least.been dl for 2hours an only got 20.03% and i can dl a film in 10 min usually

,channah2478,2011-04-04T08:53Z,"what is seeding and leaching??
why is it downloading so slowly?"
,bonesun,2011-04-04T08:53Z,@Ghost_24 i just thought that bc it never says seeding on BitTorrent until i finish downloading completely  but im uploading at 150-180k downloadin at 15 k

Btw, I tried running what i did have and it only played like the first 2mins, but it looks good I think.  Its been recorded off of DirectTV so there are gonna be some menu pop ups, but I think its gonna be ok."

Thanks - will seed for the next week."

The jfx designed poster is a little off but oh well.  Great torrent, much thanks and I will download for a week."
,tyu_juve,2011-04-04T10:52Z,please you guys SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanx !!!!!!!!!!
,ghost_24,2011-04-04T12:27Z,all you guys who finished downloading so early what type of connection do you have?? in on a 6mb adsl and ive been going for 6hours
,ghost_24,2011-04-04T12:29Z,@bonesun  you seed as you download but i'm having the same issue as you...what client are most people using? im using vuze atm as bitlord pisses me off!
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-04T12:45Z,"fragmented files cuz it was found that way, no point going to desirulz, i swiped their copy and upped it before they did. Thos who are having issues downloading dunno what to tell ya, im seeding thru utorrent, i see 59 seeders but theres like 5600 people in the queue, it aint all up to me to see this to everyone. Bitlord is not a suitable replacement for utorrent, neither is ares. yes it has the bits in between, no issues with the sound dunno why you are having sync issues, i watched the entire thing again its perfectly fine and legit, chances are the other person with a copy has the same exact thing. No one had this on torrent in under an hour.... I beat them all out, even the people who were trying to up this torrent in the first place."
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-04T14:58Z,by the way the Bryant match never happened either.
,herjabram,2011-04-04T17:00Z,"I got a fast internet connection, and at 7.30am local time this was the first download of wm27 available.
However it's now at 25% 8 hours later! Not worth the wait; downloaded to other torrents in the mean time, great quality and not 16 files!
Look somewhere else, this is not worth the wait; 16 files, too slow, no seeders"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-04T17:22Z,"no seeders? wtf are you smoking, im seeing 753 seeders noob"
,playbydisk,2011-04-04T18:18Z,"To be fair, I have a lousy 1mb connection and started this at 7am (uk time) this morning and it's now 5pm and I'm on 90%. Not too bad considering the demand for this torrent. "
,EvilRetard1983,2011-04-04T20:19Z,"LMFAO...out of all the seeders, I only have 40 freakin people seeding. The thing I find funny is that half of these people on here crying for somebody to seed or whatever most likely finished with their precious download and just ended everything and not even seeded themselves. I will say when I am finished I will seed and I thank the people who are seeding at the moment, the rest of you sperm rag cum dumpsters can suck on a rotten dildo and stick it side ways up your monkey asses. "
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-04T21:23Z,"i have 1mbs upload and been seeding since 45 mins after the event, even the original source came to my comments to spam. First LEGIT torrent online for both the streaming source and downloadble. Sorry its in 16 parts, it was a race to the finish and i wasnt losing. Right now my utorrent says 1500 seeders and i just updated the tracker. I've been seeding myself at 250kbs for the last almost 12 hours, most of the ones who do complain DONT SEED, I appreciate standing up for me EvilRetard. Most of them didnt give 2 craps about helping others get it as much as i did, why did i care, i work for indy feds, want PG F U WWE we aint paying for that crap anymore......"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-04T21:25Z,"and about the ""cover"" this was the legit cover, they pulled 2 matchs before the dark matches to push cole and king and snooki more."
,1966mp,2011-04-05T02:05Z,"The only thing that bugged me a bit about having 16 files is that file 12.avi is 632x360 and all the rest are 640x368. I was going to just use AVI Joiner to put them all together but with the one file being different it won't join them.

But thanks for putting this up, my kids were bugging me to death about watching it. :)"
,DragonChaserKev,2011-04-05T02:56Z,"On the Taker Triple H match now.  Great entrance by HHH.  Overall alot of phony acting and not much good wrestling, Rock's been a good host, J.R. did a match and I hope he finishes the night.  JR is sooooo much better than Cole at the announce table.
So far a dissapointing Wrestlemania in my opinion, lets hope this match makes up for it.  

Took 9 hours for me to dl, average 77.4 kbs
As I said will seed for a week."
,channah2478,2011-04-05T08:29Z,"thank you so much actually downloads really quick
can someone please tell me how to seed and what it is so i can do it?"
,DragonChaserKev,2011-04-05T09:06Z,"The people sharing & connected to each other using the bit-torrent protocol are split into 2 categories. SEEDS(uppers) & LEECHERS(downloaders) In the begining while downloading a torrent for the first time you are a leecher because the download hasn't completed. When it completes you switch to a seeder and dedicate that stream to simply uploading. The more seeds available the faster the download. 

So it is important to seed back at least what you take. So if you download a file that is 1GB then seed back 1GB. That is why it is called FILE SHARING. People are considerate enough to share their stuff you can repay them back by seeding back what you take so others can enjoy it as well.

I don't always follow the polite 1:1 ratio, depends on what it is and the number of seeds.  Other things I seed though well beyond a that.  Seeding is another word for sharing.  :)  I was thinking it isn't really piracy, pirates would never share.  More like Robin Hood. "
,bigd-bs,2011-04-05T17:53Z,its not even complete? wats that all about fs.. stops half way through the king vs micheal cole... :| 
,bigd-bs,2011-04-05T17:54Z,wats the point in puttin on a torrent thats not even complete? waste of time now i hav 2 dowenload another for the rest... POINTLESS
