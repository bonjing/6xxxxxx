A fortune in gold has been stolen and you've been hired to find and return it before the trail goes cold and it's lost forever. Seek & find more than 2,100 hidden objects in 25 amazing San Francisco locations - from Alcatraz to the Golden Gate Bridge, Haight-Ashbury and Fisherman's Wharf - and track down the stolen gold! You are the world-famous Mystery P.I. and you have just 17 hours to piece together the clues hidden in the Golden Gate city. If you find the gold in time, you'll collect a handsome $20 million reward for your efforts. Are you up to the job?
