,michaelrwatson,2011-04-21T21:43Z,"Does this have subtitles, preferably hardcoded and ONLY for the non-English parts?? The first half of this movie is all in Russian (or something). "
,YaYami,2011-05-03T13:37Z,awesome.
,bwv812,2012-04-26T04:44Z,"Who cares if it's ripped from BR if the resolution is only 624x272? A half-decent DVD rip will look just as good. When you can get a pretty good 720p at a smaller size, there's really no excuse for this..."
