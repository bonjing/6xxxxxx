,DarkLair213,2011-04-09T02:12Z,thx man. would be great if the non-developer version of the build was on here too...
,vampyricalcurse,2011-04-09T19:36Z,Why would you need the standard version for? It sucks compared to developer.
,DarkLair213,2011-04-09T22:14Z,"I know it does.  In fact, I had developer at one point but I can't find it anymore... though I don't believe there are any developer versions on here anyway...ah well"
,OlveraAtom,2011-04-18T10:09Z,"Very nice. Thank you so much bro, you are awesome. Long live bro... long live"
,OlveraAtom,2011-04-18T10:10Z,"Also, I'm two of the seeders."
,OlveraAtom,2011-04-18T10:55Z,Oh... now I'm four of them... you're welcome :D
,LavaWave,2011-04-21T14:32Z,"Hey, is this the version that support HWA shaders and capable to release the games in flash format?"
,Kalekki,2011-05-21T11:36Z,"LavaWave: No, to convert the games made with MMF2dev to swf, you need to have the extension which we have'nt crack yet. This doesnt support HWA either."
,LavaWave,2011-06-04T22:01Z,"Not even HWA, what a waste, someone atleast cracks the HWA please, it would make it possible to make HD games with that."
,Kalekki,2011-06-27T16:40Z,"If you're so eager to make HD games, either go buy this goddamn software, or learn a proper programming language, before whining how bad this thing is."
,thcfreak666,2011-08-23T01:39Z,Its not Full ! Extensions Missing
,cesar_e_p,2011-12-03T19:51Z,I can't install any extensions packs :(
,edsabbath,2011-12-05T06:26Z,"I've been using it for about 30 days and then all of the objects in the editor disappeared! I can't even mess with my games anymore.

I've reinstalled everything again, uninstalled and reinstalled, tried various updates... I can't get it to work at all. Still no objects/extensions. What's going on?"
,blfunser,2012-01-05T06:18Z,STOP TALKING ABOUT BUYING SOFTWARE why the fuck are you here then??!

,blha303,2012-01-23T10:24Z,"@piratejyant, that's Flash. Get Adobe Flash Professional. Or Master Collection CS5."
,Korosqui,2012-04-06T16:56Z,"OK, can someone upload the newest build with the HWA? That would make all of us happy. "
