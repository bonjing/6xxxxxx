# What is this torrent?

Focus of this torrent is Jacque Fresco and by extension The Venus Project of his.
It is mainly a tribute of sorts to Jacque Fresco and his work. The purpose of this
compilation is to give one an opportunity to easily and comfortably discover even
more ideas and views held by Jacque Fresco.


#
# Composition of the torrent

o 95% of data is speeches, lectures and interviews with Jacque Fresco.
o 3% The Venus Project related stuff
o 2% miscellaneous and trivia, varying from short video clips taken with mobile
  phones, to Future By Design and Zeitgeist: Addendum outtakes, film commentaries
  to fan made stuff (make sure you check this out!) and a couple of The Venus
  Project related and Zeitgeist films that feature Jacque Fresco, to electronic
  copies of magazines where Jacque Fresco was published, his e-books and audio
  interviews with him.

99% of all available videos that existed and were freely accessible have been
downloaded from:

o YouTube and Vimeo as of Dec 6, 2010
o Google Video, Dailymotion, dotsub, various blogs, etc. as of Dec 7, 2010

I\'m pretty much sure I got them all but, of course, I\'m just a human being and I
could\'ve missed something.

# Why did I do this?

YouTube and similar video hosting web-sites are great and all but there are few
points about them to keep in mind:

o YouTube has been progressively becoming more and more controlling of what content
  can be hosted and who can view it (for now this is applicable to mainly
  copyrighted material)
o Users come and go or get banned, or something else happens and their accounts are
  deleted and all the videos they uploaded, favorited and the playlists they
  created are gone for good with those accounts too. Thus this torrent attempts
  to prevent loss of these materials.
o Lots of these videos on YouTube specifically are on servers with very low
  connection speeds. That is just frustrating when you want to see a 2 minutes long
  video clip that takes you 5 minutes to cache it on >10Mbit/s link.
o Perhaps most interesting videos are buried beneath of pile of hundreds of
  duplicates of other, more popular, videos and were found by essentially persistent
  sorting out. Here in this torrent you can easily find anything there is for you to
  see (as of date of plowing the Internet). It took a lot of time and some pain to
  put it all together but I thought you\'d be just thrilled to have all this material
  at your fingertips.
o I also wanted to make sure that all this material can be easily accessible to
  anyone and nothing never gets deleted or disappears. BitTorrent is an awesome
  protocol for this kind of thing so, please, download and share indefinitely.

# Other notes

o Most of these videos are not explicitly copyrighted I guess. In fact, I think 99%
  of this array of data either isn\'t copyrighted or copyright holders will be happy
  to know that this torrent exists and people are downloading it.
o Videos were left split in parts intentionally with original YouTube (Vimeo,
  Google Video, etc.) names so you could easily find them on YouTube should you
  want to read a video description and/or see other videos of the user who
  uploaded them. Or maybe like, favorite, leave a comment, etc.
o Highest possible video resolution was a priority. There are 1080p, 720p and
  lower resolutions. Where 1080p and 720p were available both versions of a file
  were saved and were either marked with -1080p and -720p filename affix
  correspondingly. You can find single-file and also full versions of some of these
  videos on dotsub but in lower resolutoins, no HD.
o In fact, I did some file renaming for some files but only to ensure they were
  sorted in a meaningful fashion so that you could easily drag and drop them into
  your video player or create playlists from UNIX console easily. So, when searching
  for any video on the Internet omit 1of9 or 19 and add spaces between words to find
  the video.

# Keywords

Just in case you\'re wondering how I searched for the videos I used the following
keywords:

o Jacque Fresco
o The Venus Project
o Venus Project

A combinations of those by grouping with \" \" and negating some results wih -youtube
keywords and similar to tune the results. Which returned almost 6 thousand of videos
on YouTube only for Jacque Fresco. I plowed through all these thousands of results
for each of the keywords including each user channel and their uploads and playlists.
No, I\'m sorry but I didn\'t go through the Favorites. I don\'t have that much time nor
do I believe it would\'ve yielded discovery of the videos that were not indexed by
YouTube\'s search engine. 

As a matter of fact, going through a user\'s uploads and playlists actually resulted
in discovery of interesting but otherwise obfuscated videos with Jacque Fresco or
related to The Venus Project. Something you might want to keep in mind when searching
for videos on YouTube and similar web-sites.

# The Venus Project World Lecture Tour

This torrent also includes video and audio recordings of lectures given by Jacque
Fresco and Roxanne Meadows on TVP World Lecture Tour. There are at least some videos
for 12 out of 18 countries that Jacque and Roxanne visited in 2010 (full list of
countries and dates is here: http://www.thevenusproject.com/world-tour-lecture-dates/ ).


#
# Zeitgeist Movement

I deliberately did not include speeches, lectures and interviews with Peter Joseph
and basically 99% of purely Zeitgeist Movement related material. You can easily find
lots of Zeitgeist videos on YouTube, Google Video, Vimeo, dotsub, DailyMotion and
other web-sites all around the Internet. As I said this is a tribute of sorts to
Jacque Fresco.

However I did include Awakening and Our Technical Reality by Douglas Mallette, NASA
TVP advocate. As well as Automation Is Here and a couple of Zeitgeist films since all
of these films either demonstrate the feasibility of technological aspects of The Venus
Project or feature prominently Jacque Fresco and his ideas.
