,Perf123,2011-06-12T21:24Z,"Oh, that worked! After pressing the magnet link you get a kinda empty window in your torrent program but just proceed with that and it'll be fine!

Good luck guys,
There's a great deal of knowledge in this torrent!"

,il-iv,2012-02-04T13:00Z,"hey guys, it's ivanl here.

I don't know what hell happened to my account but I just can't log in. Why the torrent link is dead is a complete mystery to me as well.

I suggest that you go to btjunkie dot org and download this torrent from there. It's exactly the same torrent. In fact, I uploaded this torrent to a number of trackers, btjunkie, kickasstorrents and others included.

If any tracker fails for you just google up ""jacque fresco compilation torrent"" and you will most likely find a working link to this torrent.

Hope this helps. Glad some people find it useful and, please, keep seeding indefinitely.

Thank you!"
