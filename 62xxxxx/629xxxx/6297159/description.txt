"Slice of Death"

Castle & Beckett work the case of a man 
found dead inside a pizza oven, but it 
turns out not to be someone associated with 
the restaurant - it was a reporter. Was his 
story, "The Pizza Wars," enough to get him 
killed, or was it something much deeper 
than that?

Enjoy :)
