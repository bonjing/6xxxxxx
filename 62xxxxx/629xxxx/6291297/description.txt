"Has a smoky, slinky groove to it, and might have you thinking of the Black Crowes and the familiarity of '70s rock, a mix of acid rock, southern rock, and Texas blues hits home."  
 Bill Ribas, NY Street Review.

â€œ The Holy Goats take you on a trip back in time when good old fashion rock-n-roll ruled the airways. When the singers had soul and the rhythm section was tight but still walked with a groove. When the guitar players played more than just chords, they were LEAD instruments. All hail The Holy Goats!
