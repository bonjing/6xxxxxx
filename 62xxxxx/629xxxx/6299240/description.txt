Product Description
In todayâ€™s fast-paced society, who has time to keep up with both the current trends and the classics of what is â€œgoodâ€ and â€œpopularâ€? The Art of Faking It guides youâ€”with tongue planted firmly in cheekâ€”through any awkward, intellectual, and/or Ã¼ber-sophisticated social situation, using both panache and pithy nuggets of wisdom to ensure youâ€™ll never be at a loss for the right words and attitudes again.

Inside you will find everything you need to know about what everyone is talking aboutâ€” from ordering the â€œrightâ€ food and drink to holding an intelligent conversation about anything, from classical music and architecture to legitimate theater and the opposite sex. With the timely information and savvy advice in this book, playfully illustrated with New Yorker-esque line drawings, you will be the most scintillating conversationalist in the bunchâ€”whether you are faking it or not!
