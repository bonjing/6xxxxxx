,Phavonic,2011-04-06T00:01Z,"Ah nice surprise. I was starting to miss 80s new wave and go onto 80s funk !!

Thanks for the reality check. But now you couldn't do something about this fat slob-cum-muscular-slob that keeps popping up on the side of my screen to put me off sex and eating, could you. "

Anyways, thanks a ton for all these uploads.

I spent a few days downloading all of them, about 389 torrents and 65GB.

Thanks again and I'll seed them as long as I can."
