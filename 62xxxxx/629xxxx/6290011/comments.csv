,dickeylw,2011-04-03T22:51Z,"Didn't work on my 2008 Accord. Can't read disk, Please contact dealership. Had to revert back to version 4.63. Burned ISO image with PowerISO to DL DVD at lowest speed. Assume ISO was already decrypted."
,sm55,2011-04-04T00:50Z,didn't work for me either. does it need to be burnt to a dvd-rom disc for it to work? 
,namac,2011-04-06T00:01Z,Any idea where to pick up the Orange version of the 2011 disk?  I've bought several upgrades in the past but 150 is so much for what little you get.

Honda has a check in place to see if it's a burned DVD.  If it is, it won't accept it.  There are hacks out there if you google it, but they don't work on my 2010 Crosstour.  "

Thank you very much!"
,deantl,2011-12-24T04:04Z,Does this one start up with Acura satellite image? Hope so.. The other one on this site has a terrible Honda Oddysey picture.
