,rsl87,2011-04-03T22:06Z,Could anyone let me know if they've downloaded this and it works on the PS3. I've downloaded 2 other bluray version of the movie only to find out 20 minutes in that it's Cinavia protected and the audio shuts off.. tricky bastards
,rsl87,2011-04-04T04:31Z,More wasted bandwidth.. cinavia protected and the audio mutes after about 30 minutes on the PS3. I appreciate the upload but you really shouldn't put that it's ps3 compatible if you haven't even made sure that it is.

@ rsl87- you have to jailbreak your ps3 for it work!"
,henrikhoe,2011-04-05T00:31Z,will this work on the apple tv 2?
,hotdad34,2011-04-09T13:54Z,"Who cares aout Cinavia! The non-BD software players such as VLC will never implement it. Media Center may never implement it if it never supports BD. So once the content is ""jailbroken"" from the BD using something like MakeMKV it doesn't matter if that watermark is still there or not, it will play fine on software media players (maybe not software BD players). So who cares? Who is going to write it back to an expensive physical BD disc anyway? I hate to tell you this, but BD is a dying format even while it is still growing because the true final format is no physical disc at all and it is only a couple of years away. So have at it Cinavia. No one is buying your crumby Blu-Ray discs anymore."
