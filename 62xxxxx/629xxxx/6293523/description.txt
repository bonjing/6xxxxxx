Youth Without Youth (2007)

Director: Francis Ford Coppola

Youth Without Youth is a 2007 film by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novella of the same name by Romanian author Mircea Eliade. It was the first film that Coppola had directed in ten years since 1997's The Rainmaker. It was distributed through Sony Pictures Classics in the United States and PathÃ© in the UK and France. The music was composed by Grammy award-winning Argentinan classical composer Osvaldo Golijov. Originally the film was to be distributed by United Artists. Sony Pictures Classics distributed the film when it opened in limited release in the United States on December 14, 2007. In an interview, Coppola said that he made the film as a meditation on time and on consciousness, which he considers a "changing tapestry of illusion," but he admitted that the film may also be appreciated as a beautiful love story, or as a mystery.

Following a wider release in Europe, however, many critics warmed up to it. Comparisons have been made with Federico Fellini and David Lynch, specifically the latter's Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.

The film was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 2008 Independent Spirit Awards.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
