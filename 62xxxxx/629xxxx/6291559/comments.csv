,EiNST3iN,2011-09-02T17:28Z,"Anyone who things Nascar isnt a sport needs to jump off their roof and land straddling their fence. After that, then go to the track and lets see if you can pull off that many laps in the intense heat and constant change in G forces on your body. Not to mention the constant movement in the car and vibrations that make your body go numb. You have to be extremely fit to be a successful driver. So get off your fat A$$ and give it a shot before you put it down you stupid ignorant fool!"
