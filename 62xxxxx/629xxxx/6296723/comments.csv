,YukiHush,2011-04-07T21:17Z,"Hi! Well, it's full! Thanks. But when I tried it, it can't override/overwrite my current windows media player. How can I do that? I fear it might ruin my entire OS (I'm running Windows7. And due to some conference video sessions I have to view, I need have wm 11) Won't it? (Coz if it won't, I wanna go ahead and replace it with this wm). Thanks!"
