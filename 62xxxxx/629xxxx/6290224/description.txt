In the pilot episode of CHAOS, we meet Rick Martinez as he is wrongly arrested at the prestigious and pearly gates of the CIA headquarters. The system had a glitch and merged the new hire list with the terrorist watch list. After a cursory apology for this mistake Rick is led into Director Higgins office to learn that his job has been cut due to budget slashing. This is really a sneaky ploy by Higgins to convince Rick to join the red headed step child of the company -- the ODS. Rick will be asked to spy on the ODS and report back to Higgins, as Higgins is trying to build a case against them - and rid the agency of them forever. What Rick finds out once he starts working with the guys is that they are hard working, dedicated, patriotic, and virtually the only ones at the Agency who can get around the red tape. They do things off the grid, and not at all in the kosher manner in which Higgins would like. However, Higgins doesnâ€™t mind taking credit for the good results of the ODS' brave work. By the end of this episode, Rick will be firmly dedicated to the team, and excited by the new adventures on which he is about to embark. The mission statement of the ODS is that they are willing to get their hands dirty sometimes. Our four musketeers do just that week after week to save the world from evil.
