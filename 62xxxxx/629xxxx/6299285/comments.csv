,hell81007,2011-09-05T15:48Z,"Hunky dory as usual...

Can't figure out one thing though...

Some seasons (for eg Season 5) come in 18 GB size and some like this one in 30 GB, although quality is the same..

Then y this huge size difference??"

,Gh057man,2011-10-11T07:02Z,@hell81007 Tony Soprano cut down on his food intake during season 5 and so some episodes weren't as fat. :P
,ratslaya,2011-11-09T01:55Z,please seed ive been at 8% for the past couple days
,baybeh,2012-02-17T05:57Z,"video's ok, but audio sucks. sounds 'compressed', like it's coming out of a box."
,truthy,2012-02-28T01:14Z,"thx for sharing. too bad these files can't be be played on any br-player because whoever encoded the video was using 11 ReFrames - most players can only handle 3-8 reference frames (everything above 5 is just a waste of encoding time with no quality gain anyway) so changing the Profile from 5.1 (which is also not BR-compliant) to 4.1 doesn't help here sadly. only solution reencode = quality loss.

they play perfectly on the pc though so thx - nice quality."
,Archon12,2012-04-16T10:30Z,"@hell81007 I had wondered that myself about the size of the torrent at first, but it makes sense when you consider that there are 21 episodes in Season 6, while all of the previous seasons consist of 13 episodes. This final season actually came out in two parts with almost a year in between--episodes 1 thru 12 in 2006 and episodes 13 thru 21 in 2007. So the individual episodes themselves aren't necessarily bigger, just that there are more of them."
,Archon12,2012-04-16T10:35Z,"Also, thank you Konashine for the superb quality torrent!  It's a small hassle to convert the .mkv files so that I can play them on my PS3, but absolutely worth it to watch the final season of one of the best shows ever in HD.
+1 Quality and my sincere appreciation"
