,BrundleFly1986,2011-04-06T17:29Z,"No Mikel_17, fuck you. It makes no difference once you un-rar it. You should be thanking the uploader!"
,noacidpoison,2011-04-09T04:24Z,"Staying swearing has nothing to help. But download this format is annoying because you only discover it is fake after downloading everything, and if any part is incomplete, you can not see the video.
This, for example, parts 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22 are in trouble and I can not unpack it. I checked and downloaded them several times, but does not work.
Please, someone who has downloaded, place it in the video file directly."

@noacidpoison
This copy is fine for me. If you're downloading it and it's broken the issue is with you."

If a file doesn't match it's CRC check then the download is corrupt."
