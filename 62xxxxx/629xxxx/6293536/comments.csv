[T],FatFreddy69,2011-04-21T21:35Z,"ok, I take my word back, it seems to move now. 
thx mate, I hope you keep seeding till a few have downloaded it. cheers"
,anb83,2011-04-23T08:57Z,Don't worry I'll skip sometimes (due to the internet crisis where I live) but I'll keep on seeding as long as possible :)
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-05-07T03:38Z,"very nice ;-)
V1 D1 is available 100%.
It has Audios AC3 192: Eng, Fra, Spa (Lat Am)
Subtitles: Eng, Fra, Spa (Lat Am)
I wish more peers would give higher priority to 
V1 D2 & V1 D3.
Thx again anb83 and I apologize for being an arse. (I just worried that after such a long time I couldn't download the first DVD, peers fault for not giving higher download priority)."

Thanks again anb83. Great job you did ;-)"
,anb83,2011-05-20T12:22Z,Thanx alot mkvonly & no need to apologize. Just a request I am going to seed this as long as possible (by that I mean years) but I expect other dedicated hardcore fans like mkvonly to seed & share for as long as possible. This is a juggernaut of a share. Take Care you all.

,LucianCassidy,2011-10-28T14:53Z,"Please seed if you can.  Really loved this show as a youth!  Over a decade old, and certainly a classic.  It would be a treat to have :)  Thank you btw, to the uploader, for your time and effort in making this and sharing it with everyone.  Eta - 8 days... worth it."
