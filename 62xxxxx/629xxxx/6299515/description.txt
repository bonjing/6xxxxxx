Michael Varholaâ€™s The Korean War covers every aspect of this overlooked conflict in an original and fast-paced style. Jammed with facts, myths, statistics and analysis, Varholaâ€™s study includes chapters on leading personalities on both sides, all of the major actions including the Inchon Landing and retreat from Chosin, and the roles of the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Includes a Foreword by Col. John E. Jessup, a Korean War veteran and the author of a number of books, including An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945-1996.
Michael Varhola has written and edited several books, including Everyday Life During the Civil War. He has also founded or run several publications, including Living History and The Achiever magazines, and has been published in dozens of other publications.
