,stringent_norms,2011-04-06T20:23Z,"I installed ie9 on Windows7 Ultimate (not a licenced OS copy). In an hours time I uninstalled it and reverted back to ie8. Reason : After updates and install of ie9 it disabled my walpapers. Turned my desktop to Black. Later after reverting to ie8 still no luch. I had installed bingdynamic theme for win7. Desktop screen was black and whatever I did, could not change wallpaper. Finally I reinstalled windows 7. I even tried to use System Restore but failed. Other users please share your experience if any."
