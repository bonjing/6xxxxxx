I had saved the temporary installation folder in windows\temp during online install of IE9 so I could install IE to my other computers without downloading it again. The temp folder contains KB982861, the windows update standalone installer for IE9. To install IE just run IE9-neutral.Downloaded.msu. For windows 7 x86 and x64 version.
