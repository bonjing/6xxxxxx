I'm not sure if you ever completely seeded this, as we're all stuck at 99.85%. If you could seed the last bit again I will seed back for ages."
,Azumi-Chan,2011-05-13T20:42Z,"Im sending over than 100GB total, when i finish leave this torrent 10 people - 10seeds
ITS NOT MY fault IF THIS 10 persons not continue seeding and escape..damn all this leechers :
Im asking: WHERE is the TRUE fans..WHERE???!"
,Azumi-Chan,2011-05-13T20:44Z,BTW: I NEVER leave my precious uploads without complete seeding.

Okay chill out.

Will you seed the last bit of this for us stuck at 99.85% please? Like I said I will seed this torrent back to at least a 10 ratio.

Damn it it this is a great torrent. It needs to live on!"
,Azumi-Chan,2011-05-16T15:29Z,"Ok i reseed this missing parts, but im doing this not for us but for my love Aya sweetheart. Thats All. "
,slackgit,2011-05-16T20:12Z,Thank you Azumi!
,slackgit,2011-08-16T21:25Z,"I will be hitting 10 ratio (300gb up) for this torrent and will have to move on to seeding something else at that point.

If anyone of the many that have a leeched this off me and not seeded want to carry the torch then I'd be glad.

Otherwise sorry folks, too many leechers out there."
