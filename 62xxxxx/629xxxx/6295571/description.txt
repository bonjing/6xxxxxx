         Across the Himalayas are stories of the yeti, or abominable   
         snowman. Half man, half ape, the yeti is said to roam only    
         the most remote peaks, where people rarely venture. Now,      
         veteran explorer and climber Gerry Moffatt sets out to find   
         proof in a hunt that will test his stamina. As conventional   
         scientific theories challenge ancient beliefs and credible    
         witnesses, he works to separate fact from fiction and find    
          hard evidence that the legend is real.
