,skillet92,2011-04-05T16:33Z,"Jus wanted to know whether u will continue to do Avengers?
The 20th and 21st episode are out!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-05T16:50Z,"@snair1591: Pacific was regular show last year and I encoded 10 episodes + ""Making of..."" to fit on one DVDR, none of which have survived PC crash I have past summer. Sorry."
,longdistance,2011-04-05T16:56Z,Thanks for Stargate Universe!
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-05T16:58Z,"@skillet92: Out there are XviD encodes what means nothing to me. HD sources might appear one day, and I would consider encoding. However, I completed my encoding of Avengers with releasing new encodes in one Pack, few months back. 

Probably - that's it. I do not want to play ""Hide&Seek"" with that cartoon and constant adding of new episodes in season announced by producers - as finished - TWICE."
,skillet92,2011-04-05T17:45Z,"Pls do it and put it in the TV pack once the HD sources are out!
Will be waiting for it! 
and i am still seeding the avengers season 1 torrent which u uploaded!"
