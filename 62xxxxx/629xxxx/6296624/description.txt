Vivian Girls
Share The Joy (2011)



Deriving their name from the ill-fated characters featured in the work of writer/illustrator Henry Darger, the Vivian Girls (not to be confused with the "craft pop" duo of the same name) are a Brooklyn-based trio whose gritty lo-fi tunes nod to seminal indie pop acts like Black Tambourine, Talulah Gosh, and Tiger Trap. Comprised of Cassie Ramone, Kickball Katy, and Ali, the Vivian Girls sprang into the indie circuit in 2008 with a handful of 7" singles released on a passel of small labels, including "Wild Eyes" (Plays with Dolls Records), "Orphanage" (Woodsist Records), and "I Can't Stay" (In the Red Records). Their self-titled debut full-length was released on Mauled by Tigers Records and In the Red in September that same year. The record became something of a sensation and the trio spent the year touring and gaining fans the world over. Their quickly recorded follow-up album, Everything Goes Wrong, was released in late summer of 2009.
