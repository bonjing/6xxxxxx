There are detailed step-by-step installation instructions in readme.txt. Please read it before reporting problems.

The Play-CD is not included in this torrent. It is not required and it does
not work even if you get it from somewhere else. The No-CD crack is smaller
and it works.

The Linux + Wine method was tested with Wine 1.3.15 and Gentoo Linux. It
should work with newer Wine versions and any Linux distribution.

The CD image comes from this torrent: 
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3676570/[PC_-_GAMES]_Master_of_Orion_3_by_Skyl3lazer
It was converted to ISO format with `iat --iso` but otherwise unchanged.

The moo3_patch_v125.exe comes from the official MOO3 webpage: 
http://moo3.quicksilver.com/official/patch071803.html

The nocd-crack/Moo3.exe comes from here: 
http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?c=95931&f=grumoo3125!rar

The nocd-crack/binkw32.dll comes from here: 
http://www.letoltokozpont.hu/letoltes_file.php?k=45&a=5483

If you don't trust me get the files from the above URLs. The only reason for
creating this torrent is that the installation process was pretty hard to
figure out. You can almost use the instructions here for the original files.

Good luck & have fun.
