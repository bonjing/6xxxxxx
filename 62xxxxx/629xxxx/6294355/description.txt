Ch4 The Battle of Hood and Bismark 2of2 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2002

In May 1941, the most dramatic sea battle of World War II took place. Its protagonists were the two mightiest capital ships of the era - the German battleship Bismarck and the British battle cruiser Hood. Their confrontation resulted in the destruction of both warships and the loss of over 3,500 lives. In 2001 - the 60th anniversary of this apocalyptic battle - David Mearns led an expedition that discovered the wreck of Hood for the very first time and revisited the wreck of Bismarck. As well as tracing the history of these awe-inspiring vessels and the events that led to their fatal clash, this two-part documentary chronicles the progress of this mission.
