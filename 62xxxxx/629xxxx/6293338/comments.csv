,saltirex,2011-04-06T04:24Z,Louis is great.  This family is fucked. 
,sarsapil,2011-04-10T20:01Z,"I just watched Louis Theorux's film on them in crisis and i'd like to say that although I'm also an atheist, I think I understand these people, which Theroux doesn't. They firmly believe what they say and it is clear that the bible says that homosexuality is a damnation, so they follow that, although many might disagree. I'd like to suggest to them in order to convey their message more effectively to make a short film showing god (jesus) coming down to earth in the midst of great destruction and fire of the unbelievers and them and their families being slowly raised to an eternity of bliss for being true believers, but at the same time while being so elevated, looking down with some degree of pity and concern for all those suffering souls below, showing thus that they are not indifferent to human feelings. If they showed that video in their demonstrations on a big screen, then people would at least understand why they do what they do. Finally, having seen what pretty young girls they have as members without marriageable young male prospects around, I hope some young guys join their group so they can have husbands they can marry."

,CryptoDalek,2011-04-18T23:29Z,"I agree with the_hound. Get some perspective, sarsapil."
,kimsen,2011-08-19T11:19Z,"WHAT sarsapil?
To make an argument about something beeing in the bible is so wrong. The bible is so full of insanities and hate, religion at all is disqusting and supressing. Fuck it!"
,rez90r,2011-12-18T11:12Z,"@ sarsapil, a lot of text for someone that is clearly a supporter of a delusional backyard bunch of fucked up hicks."
,r0s3a,2012-02-20T09:37Z,"Sarsapil, where in the bible does it say homosexuality is wrong? can you please provide me the scripture for it.  These people are nothing but bigots. They say they believe in god and the bible but the bible states that we were all created in gods own image and it also says that we should love everyone. These people don't love anyone but themselves (pride - a sin). Westboro Baptist think the Jews are evil too but Judaism is the basis for their whole religion. 

STUPID PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BREED!"
,Scientography,2012-02-29T03:39Z,"sarsapil makes a point, it says in the book of Genesis:

""Divine judgment by Yahweh was then passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah along with two other neighboring cities that were completely consumed by fire and brimstone... ""  It is believed by right wing baptists and others that God destroyed the cities because of homosexuality.  Though the validity of this is disputed.  It's best for society that we take what the ever ambiguous bible says as a grain of salt.  Or you might find yourself giving all your money to some charlatan on TV or even one wearing a pointy hat. :)"
