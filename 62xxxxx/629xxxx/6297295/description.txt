By the time this album was recorded The Daredevils had undergone some personnel changes through a couple of the founding members moving on to pursue their solo careers. With their replacements, and the addition of extra players, the group had grown to 8 members, producing a varied sound and feel in the music. Thus following the path that always created interest in them. On this disc are three bonus tracks that have never before been released on any of the group s earlier albums. Fans of the group will delight in the fact that they have never heard these songs before. The music on this disc, like all of The Daredevils self-styled, rootsy material has withstood the test of time and offers the same listener appeal as it always did.
