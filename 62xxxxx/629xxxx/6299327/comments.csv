,mat459,2011-04-07T08:57Z,"Excellent work as always YIFY, but can i ask why u kept the letterbox this time? Just curious. I really like your movies, not only cause they are great quality in a small size, but i hate losing half my screen to black bars."

,AN0N_YM0US,2012-03-06T09:35Z,Appreciate the upload. This movie looks very interesting I saw the previews just today. Nice. (:
,jbentley,2012-03-29T04:18Z,does it show letos shine in this?
,wistfool,2012-06-04T23:01Z,"Words cannot express how much I love this movie. Thanks so much for uploading it. Kinda wish you'd done a smaller sized upload, but I guess I'll just keep this copy around for years, to be viewed on a huge TV screen instead of my tiny laptop."
,ziopap,2012-06-15T15:20Z,"The quality is not so good at all. What's the point in making a ""cheap"" 1080p with poor bitrate and a lot of artifacts? A standard brrip looks better than this. I suggest downloading the 10 GBs 1080p for real quality lovers."
