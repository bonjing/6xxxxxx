,A_Quach,2011-04-09T17:43Z,ALSO REMEMBER to change your name in the rev.ini file. I'm tired of seeing all these Quach clones in the servers.
,worldking789,2011-04-10T21:05Z,why cant i make a lobby for the game?
,A_Quach,2011-04-11T22:24Z,"This is a cracked version. You can only play on cracked servers, and you aren't able to create your own lobbies."
,karlazzzz,2011-04-30T12:44Z,"This is gooooooood :P

,karlazzzz,2011-04-30T12:45Z,"THIS IS GOOOOOOOD ^_______^

,8max,2011-05-18T13:48Z,Thanks for sharing A_Quach.
,valerz,2011-05-19T05:11Z,"Thanks A_Quach! Working 100%, Just Perfect ^^
The only thing I couldn't accomplish was playing at the same time with 2 pcs (mine and my bro's) in the same game. Is there anyway to do that?
Anyway, Thanks a lot ^^"
,xXxmdjxXx,2011-05-28T22:36Z,"Hi, this works really fine on all computers in my house, and in my GF's house (trough router and trough wireless router) works even on lan PC's. Only problem in the map ""apartments"" when im outside on the roof or in the street i hear a realy loud and annoying hissing noise(on all the installs) tryed to edit the audio settings but nothing helps, the pcs use different soundcards with newest drivers... Does anyone know what could be wrong?"
,Deog,2011-05-29T00:08Z,"I think the sound is jacked,you get loud hissing and cracking noises,rebuilding audio cash doesnt help,It is very playable though.other than the sound trouble this is the Best L4D torrent ive seen,you can use addons An mods.Wish Quach could redo it with a sound fix or something,Im not smart enough to figure it out."
,amjovi,2011-06-10T14:41Z,This looks fine. I can't wait to finish the download. Been playing L4D since fall 2009.. and been out for a year now.. Can't wait to play co-op:D
,A_Quach,2011-06-20T00:21Z,"For those of you with sound errors, open up the console by pressing ~, and type in snd_rebuildaudiocache. This should fix it, as it fixed it for me."
,basb20,2011-06-25T13:22Z,"Hey A_Quach, First I'd like to thank you for uploading this file; it saves me alot of time, so thnx :)

I'll be hosting a lan party next week for 5-6 people, is there anything I should know about? I'm a total noob when it comes to programming and such so I'd greatly appreciate it if you could give me some tips and hints.

cheers!"
,seres69,2011-06-26T19:09Z,"i got a little problem. my game dont want to start. i installed the standalone patch and i tried to start it. then a eror popped-up and said that theres something missing in tier0.dll. then i tried it without the standalone. after the intro it said ""Steam must be running"". i ran steam and the same happened again. is there a way to fix this?"
,basb20,2011-06-28T14:21Z,"I uninstalled Steam completely before launching this game, give it a try"
,iamarcanthony07,2011-06-29T08:13Z,i can't play it... there are no pictures on the start up and on the menus... there's only sound.  please help.
,Noyovitz,2011-07-05T16:35Z,"The only problem I have (aside from the hissing but I fixed that with the cache) is that sometimes when there is fire, there is a black circle around it.
(Go to the beginning of the first Crash Course map to see what I'm talking about)

Otherwise it is a great game and would download L4D2 if you posted it! :P"
,Deeh1901,2011-07-17T17:52Z,"It is in russian I think...
I tried to change the language in the rev.ini but nothing happens, still in russian...
Anyone have a solution?"
,Sylthsaber,2011-07-17T21:38Z,so i downloaded it and did the thing for the sound but it wont let me do single player when i try the grafics flip out and i have to close it. anyone have any ideas?
,Sylthsaber,2011-07-17T21:41Z,im having a problem when ever i try to do single player the grafics freak out and i have to close the game. anyone have any ideas

No viruses, good amount of seeders and online works (40+ servers on list)!
I'm seeding it (60th seeder :D) and playing it! My in-game names are: [K]arma [C]harg3r and Hardstylehunt3r (or Hardhunt3r).
Cheers and great upload!"
,IcyDragonPolaris,2011-09-30T02:38Z,"Game works fine for me, but almost ALL the text is in Japanese. Is there any way I can get around this?"
,emoRAWR,2011-11-03T03:29Z,"You do have to do the ""snd_rebuildsoundaudiocache"" And Losing The Ability To Play Survival Hurts. Haha. Great Upload Man. I Love It!"
,GargoyleGhoulGoblin,2011-11-26T07:52Z,is there a way to access other servers other than the 5 that pop up.
