notes: question is why two version\'s ?
       simple i want you to have un-edited
       and clean restore, am leaving these as wav
       and 0 flac\'in them. also on want more track
       i fixed speed drop , in the un-edited version
       that speed drop is left alone , as written i 
       want you too have unedited & edited.

high quality session from 78 with an amazeing set list.
i all ways kept this session in a split so that you can
just jump too certain track\'s...ALOT work went in too this.

md5 included in all file archives along  with cdda text logs

keep this big archive untouched & dont brake the archive structor
for that will not help others able to get from you due to file missmatch
keep it outta the mp3 lame zone, do not pirated nor try bootleg this
this music is free & never to be sold.
