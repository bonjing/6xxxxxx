Torrent's aren't WinZip Files or extractable like that you need a program called uTorrent or any other Bit torrent downloader and they download the movie or file inside the torrent.

Go to http://www.utorrent.com/ and like on the download button and when it's finished go to you torrent and just try open it and it should start downloading in a few seconds.

If you need anymore help just ask"
