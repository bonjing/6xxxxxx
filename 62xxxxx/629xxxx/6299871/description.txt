The TuffTones
The TuffTones (2010)



The TuffTones play music that is eclectic and superbly chosen representing the genres they love-everything from dirty blues to dark voodoo beats. As a live act they deliver a ridiculously raucous good time and visually splendiferous to boot with a fashion sense that is part voodoo priest meets Route 66'.
