That is why rippers provide sample.

No one is forcing to download any release, You are making your own decision.

If i were you, i would never download any of these crap TS or CAM, i will honestly wait for an R5 release.

There are people who still cannot afford to download a 700-MB version of movies, They depend upon small size rippers like MKV-Guy, VICE, Deffjam555, and StyLishSaLH etc.

If you need a nice and clear copy, then always wait for R5, its just a friendly suggestion :)"

i do agree with you mate about waiting for a proper rip or r5,just so many fakers on here posting trusted users stuff as their own.at the end of the day i have a 50meg connection with no download limit so it really makes no odds to me but there is a difference between a cam and a TS which most of the time is quite noticeable. i would trust a TS over a cam and so would most people on here i think.hey i am not knocking your work,just not nice to be misslead,hope my little rant did not offend.

,Sumalia,2011-04-03T21:19Z,This release is a complete joke.Don't download this shit.It is OK till half the movie then it goes incredibly out of sync.The speech and the picture are more than 10sec. separate and this last till the end.
,Saki33,2011-04-04T15:19Z,"I'm with the uploader on this one. TS or cam, both crap. I can't wait to see this one myself, but that is contradictory, because I can wait--for a good rip. I enjoy movies, but I enjoy them a lot more with good quality. I no longer download anything less than a bluray rip. You know what you are getting with one of these so don't complain, and after all it is free, and you are free to pass on it. "
,pvokes123,2011-04-07T18:16Z,"i guess ill wait for a screener or an r5 to pop up, thanks for the effort and time that you took to release this dude :)"
