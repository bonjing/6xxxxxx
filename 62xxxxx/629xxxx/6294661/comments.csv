,AkshayDK,2011-04-30T09:38Z,"I really liked your this upload.. but.. I found one disappointment.. that.. the last 11 min of video is just a waste.. when the time of video comes to 2:26:xx something.. it quickly stops.. I know there is nothing special during 2:26 - last min.. 2:37
but its a waste of size also.. Haven't you noticed it ?"
,Nomadic26,2011-05-03T21:48Z,"WARNING : This torrent is being tracked. Got the infamous letter to my ISP regarding the download.

As for quality, it was jittery in Quicktime (codec?) but ran great in vlc."
