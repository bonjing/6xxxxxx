,Opunium,2011-04-04T15:38Z,"Just buy the game, it is only 7.50 Euros, this is just another stupid virus. Who cant miss 7.50 Euros? It is not like Victoria 2, wich was 40 Euros."
,daomo0,2011-04-04T16:21Z,Nice torrent it works with the fix(make sure to rename it from t_dhour.r20 to t-dhour.r20).

,GoodTunes,2011-04-05T00:04Z,"This is not the real version, which is why it is bug-ridden. The actual copy is over 600mb, and, according to the Devs at the forum on Paradox Plaza, this is a leaked version of early beta testing that they are trying to track down.
Wait for the correct release probably tomorrow, as it has not even been released yet. "
,tscardino,2011-04-05T05:21Z,so is this the real deal?
,JerombaCZ,2011-04-05T07:05Z,"GoodTunes is right, this version is crap. But still good enough for basic testing of overlay and performance. Well it looks great, it runs great, it's full of great ideas but it's also full of bugs, mainly events and economy. But its enough for me, I'll buy it. 10âŹ is nothing compared to weeks of fun"
,claudefrog,2011-04-05T14:39Z,the link makes it work but make sure when you run the link save it and change the file name accordingly otherwise if you save it and then change the name it wont work.
,Ispanecabg,2011-04-05T21:38Z,"Game works perfect, is FULL, the one released on shop. To make it work, just download the repaired archive fro mthe post above.

Long live Demonoid :)"
,wowwars,2011-04-05T21:50Z,"Good JOB 


THIS is the REAL deal just that this is a older type of DH and the real DH file size is 563MB checked on GG so just a small difference.

Dont worry i have copied some Files of a REAL DH a friend gave me and i'll check em."
,wowwars,2011-04-05T22:15Z,"http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-DHHOIG/darkest-hour-a-hearts-of-iron-game


File size: 465.53 MB 

anyone eles notice that the file size kept changing till the final release?"
,JerombaCZ,2011-04-06T06:58Z,"""just an older type"" is not just!!...game mechanics are messed, events don't work etc...simply most important parts of game are screwed in this release. Maybe its all in final coz Paradox ( and studios workin for them ) is known for releasing unfinished games using players who pay for finished game as betatesters"
,Ispanecabg,2011-04-06T15:50Z,"Game works, period...There are like 10 releases already, and file size is maybe different, but who cares, we wil lget liek 20 more patches before game starts to work."
,mayan888,2011-04-07T02:06Z,"I changed the name of the file, but now it asks for archive # 21, any thoughts on this one?"
,mayan888,2011-04-07T02:06Z,"I changed the name of the file, but now it says I need archive # 21, any thoughts on this one?"
,mayan888,2011-04-07T02:09Z,"I renamed that file, but now it says cant find archive #21, any thoughts on this one chaps?"
,Ispanecabg,2011-04-07T14:06Z,"Yes, mayan, just make a hash check of your terrent file ;)"
,gurthaur,2011-04-10T18:11Z,Works with the fix. Thanks.

,SirQuijote,2011-04-18T22:03Z,"ffs, just BUY the game!"
,serpent99,2011-05-28T00:56Z,"After extracting and mounting the .bin I get an error when I try to install the game. (with or without the new r20)

Unable to create temporary file. Setup aborted.
Error 1: Incorrect function.

What can I do to get around the problem?"
,Valmont1982,2011-10-20T00:37Z,"Archive issue, part 20 seems damaged.

Use the other torrent."
