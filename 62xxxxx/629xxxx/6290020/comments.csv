I have used a few different ones but they all are hit and miss...."
[T],Zverik,2011-04-17T11:11Z,"Thanks! I use ffmpeg with -vcodec copy -acodec copy, it is enough for most cases. When a file displays as corrupted on my PS3, I redo it with Yamb, a gui for MP4Box: it always produces a 100% playable file."

BTW can you add movies which are ps3 ready :) THANKS once again"
[T],Zverik,2011-04-23T22:35Z,"Hi, husdude! The purpose of those torrents is to provide trailers that play on PS3 right away. I check every one of them on my console. As for the whole movies, I do not pirate them, sorry. You could look for *.mp4 files: they are supported by you console."
