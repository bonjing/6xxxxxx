,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-06T19:46Z,"I have a request.   Been wanting to see this ever since it was announced in late 2009, but the producers have been hell-bent on showing it to all the film festivals and private audiences.  The point of the subject of the documentary is completely lost if nobody can see it!  Was recently shown at the Tribeca, for example, but they won't put it in theaters.  GRRR!

Well, cars and other gifts she gives does cost fortune, but financial troubles are hard to imagine. It looks like some Mor(o)nic mole inside Oprah's Network acquired rights just to hide the movie from the people."

,jeebz,2011-04-07T10:54Z,"thanks 20-40 for all your uploads!  always best size with best video quality!  

i know that you encoded The Clone Wars episodes, but some of the torrents dont have seeds, so i cant get them.  can you upload all of clone wars season 3 in one torrent?  i would really appreciate it!  thanks again, and keep up the good work"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-07T12:03Z,"@jeebz: As I, unfortunately, explained many times in past two weeks, I have hard-drive crash what resulted that I lost many of my ""older"" encodes (""old"" because two  week old encode is like two hundred encodes back). SWCW are one of those. Of Chuck, for example, only the last episode survived... well, lucky me...
I encourage people to make torrents, especially for whole seasons of my encodes (anyone who can log-in can become uploader too) because I obviously cannot do all by myself, for various reasons."
,jeebz,2011-04-08T01:38Z,"@ 20-40 - sorry bout the hard drive crash.  i just saw some of your comments about putting things back up after 48 hours.  will try and stay more up-to-date on your weekly's and daily's.  thanks for all your work!

@ everyone else - if you have all of 20-40's Clone Wars season 3 episodes, could you please post them as a new torrent?  thanks"
