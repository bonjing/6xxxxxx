Info:
Nick Carter, member of the famous and talented vocal group Backstreet Boys is back again with his second solo studio effort "I'm Taking Off". The first offering of the album is a love song called "Just One Kiss" which just got an accompanying music video directed by Danny Roew, the clip follows the Backstreet Boys member strolling down the beach.

Carter's first album since 2002 "Now or Never", "I'm Taking Off" reportedly has already been released in Japan and has received great reviews and success.

Beside focusing on his solo career, Nick Carter is also gearing up to tour with Backstreet Boys. They will hit the road with New Kids On The Block this summer and we already got a teaser at last year's VMA's and in a live performance of "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest". From what we have seen so far this already looks like it's going to be the best tour of 2011.

Wishing all the very best to Nick and the BOYS for 2011.
