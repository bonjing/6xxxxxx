,DakotaDC3,2011-04-06T12:41Z,"I have no AI traffic in the airport. I guess there is a problem with the AFCAD. The ADE fault finder shows lots of errors. Anyone else has this problem? 
Thanks."
,VaticanCity,2011-04-06T21:27Z,"You could be right ,and will probally be fixed with a update.They really rush these out.But you can fix the issue your self with ADE freeware or AFX payware.while your at it check to see if thiers a reueling depot.Usually anyone wanting aes from aerosft leaves it out, for tanker truck.Just add one to a parking space.I do this now for all aerosoft products."

,ABSA11,2011-04-09T10:22Z,"Question.... I recently bought the FSD Navajo for FSX, and would like to share as i have downloaded a fare share of software from here. i have NO idea how to crack this and share.... any ideas ?? "
,gerrarditto,2011-04-12T20:00Z,"OFF: @joseph5o5.    You know, you can try to upload some stuff for FS comunity and then you can try to make a request. Shame
ON: Thx uploader!!! My favorite airport from UK :X"
,istrahd,2011-04-23T05:57Z,"I agree with gerrarditto, joseph5o5 How about creating just ONE freaking torrent before you spam every FSX thread out there? 

You are probably one of those scumbag leechers who remove the files from your torrent program as soon as they finish downloading or cap its upload speed at 1KB/s.  Its people like you that are ruining Open Trackers.  I seed EVERYTHING I leech for a MINIMUM 0f 500% on my seedbox at 100Mbps then move it to my home seedbox and seed it forever at 50KBps, Ive got 4 Drives full of about 7.6 TB of seeds from music, games, apps, movies.  

When I finish leeching every FSX Pack I can find from here and some Private Trackers, I am going to make a Mega Pack with everything in it... and it wont be a RAR, it will be individual folders so people can pick & choose what they want from one Torrent.  Over time as new things get released I will add extra packs.

WTF do you do for the community besides spam other peoples torrents with crap you want, yet provide nothing in return?  I wish I knew your IP so I could ban it from my seedboxes! Scumbag!"
,istrahd,2011-04-23T06:01Z,"VaticanCity, Thank You for all of your contributions to the FSX community!  I wish I knew how to hack/crack or otherwise create these myself!

I agree with gerrarditto, joseph5o5 How about creating just ONE freaking torrent before you spam every FSX thread out there? I checked your profile as of right now, you have NEVER ULed a Torrent to TPB.
