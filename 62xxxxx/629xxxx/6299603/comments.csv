,Furious1964,2011-04-07T07:31Z,"Sorry, I meant Medici and Venice."
,shdspyker,2011-04-07T13:06Z,"@Fluffyandre, Yes it does."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-04-07T20:31Z,I have an original game. If I apply it will I have my online account blocked?

,shdspyker,2011-04-08T11:25Z,"@DetectiveAltair, It has in-game conditions, Desmond Skin Complete Sequence 8 with 100% Sync.

,chazmrokar,2011-04-08T15:03Z,@shdspyker Hi Shade! I have a question on you - do you somehow edited this OPTIONS file or you just shared your own version upgraded with uPlay? I want to know if there is any way to prevent rewriting of achievments and also i have some audio issues with this update. Some sound effects do not play. Thanx.
,shdspyker,2011-04-08T17:44Z,"Share upgraded man, and sound effects with OPTIONS file o_0 ? weird...yeah, I check ur audio settings in-game, they can change with OPTIONS file.

And no, achievements cannot be 'saved' the options file contains all,changing that changes achievements.
"
,slothbite,2011-04-08T20:28Z,"even after ive completed all of virtual training challenges, raiden's still locked. it was unlocked before applying this. any help?"
,imjinah,2011-04-11T22:00Z,"raiden is locked.
no venetian or florentine cape."
,dothackjhe,2011-04-29T17:55Z,Anyone here have had trouble with AC:Brotherhood when installed along with AC2? AC: Brotherhood began stuttering on me in-game after installing AC2 and applied its crack. I installed both game to differentiate and compare the game only to find out that AC:Brotherhood stutters in-game while AC2 isn't affected at all. I'm thinking it's the crack for AC2 that causes this. Anyone experienced the same thing?
,moha80,2011-05-31T04:32Z,"I know I sound stupid but how does this unlock Da Vinci disappearance?, I finished the sequence 3 100% before I apply your update and the da Vinci disappearance mission did not appear on map nor in dna? Sorry for bothering you and I appreciate the download so much, thanks :)"
,shdspyker,2011-06-01T18:18Z,@moha80 It shows up on map after you beat main story brother.
,IceColder,2011-06-07T00:59Z,"uh ok this mite b a dumb question, i was looking at gettint the 1.03 update for acb and applying it, would this DLC still work if i upgrade the acb to 1.03?"
,shdspyker,2011-06-08T13:26Z,"@IceColder, it works with 1.03."
,IceColder,2011-06-11T21:18Z,"ok two more questions,
1) i dont hav the florentine and medici capes (i beat the game, if that helps) and also when i go to the ""restored memory"" to do with leonardo, the white screen with lines everywhere comes up while two guys talk briefly about ezio remembering something. then they stop talking and im still on the white loading screen. no character is there, but if i can hear myself walking if i try to, what the hell is going on lol?
thanks for upload tho."
,Vital_Jr,2011-06-11T22:38Z,"@IceColder at 2011-06-11 21:18 CET

install update 1.03. had the same problem, updating has fixed the issue."
,mikados,2011-06-11T23:23Z,i think it's only 1.01? according to the patch notes anyway http://www.gamershell.com/download_71352.shtml
,hemingway60,2011-07-11T18:35Z,"Hi, I copied your OPTIONS file and the outfits and and gun capacity did unlock. However, I can't find The Da Vinci Disappearance anywhere?? 
Yes, I finished the story already. I heard that there will be sequence 10 in DNA but nothing of that kind. Nor is there a memory marker on the map?"
,micahmo1,2012-03-10T17:38Z,Does it work for Mac?
