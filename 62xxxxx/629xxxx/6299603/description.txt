Hey there, this is Shadespyker again with an updated file, this one includes:

->All 5 Inventory outfits unlocked(Includes Desmond, Raiden, Florentine attire, AltaÃ¯r's Armour, AltaÃ¯r's Robes.)

->Uplay gun capacity upgrade (10bullets)

->The two extra single-player maps with the missions(Trajan Market and Aqueducts)

NOTE:YOU MAY LOSE ACHIEVEMENTS AND THIS MAY CHANGE YOUR LANGUAGE(stress on the word MAY) 
and like one or two sliders up or down in graphics, you can change that, and language from menu too, no harm.

Replace the options file here:


In XP :
C:\Documents and Settings\(User Name)\Application Data\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves


Win 7:
C:\Users\(User Name)\Saved Games\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves

BE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP OF THE ORIGINAL "OPTIONS" FILE, JUST IN CASE.

Enjoy!
-Shadespyker.
