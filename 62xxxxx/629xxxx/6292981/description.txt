StoryLine: 
*********

Peter is a composer and a likable sad sack who's devastated when his 
girlfriend of five years, Sarah Marshall, the star of a cheesy CSI-style 
crime show, dumps him. He weeps, he rails, he mopes. Finally, his step-brother 
Brian suggests Hawaii, so Peter heads for a resort on Oahu where, as he's 
checking in, he sees Sarah and her new beau, Aldous, a polymorphously perverse 
English rocker. The weeping and moping start again, until Peter is rescued by 
Rachel, a thoughtful hotel clerk who invites him to a luau and to hang out. 
Although he constantly runs into Sarah and Aldous, Peter starts to come alive 
again. Will Sarah realize what she's lost, and what about Rachel?
