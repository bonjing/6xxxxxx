                Like Father Like Son.
                Drama series about a newly-opened public justice
                centre and its charismatic frontman. While Coburn
                takes delivery of a new bike and starts roaming
                around Dovefield, court reporter Louise continues to
                dig into his background. Old neighbours are happy to
                gossip, and Chinese whispers starts to spread in the
                justice centre about Coburn. Meanwhile, Kaz is
                getting drawn further and further into Jake's world
                and alarm bells start ringing for Sharna.

                The rules for naming releases don't state what to do
                when there are two series that are from the same
                country and also the same year. We decided to include
                the broadcast channel in the release name to make it
                clear that this is the new BBC1 daytime drama and not
                the series of lectures that aired under the same
                title on BBC4 earlier this year.
