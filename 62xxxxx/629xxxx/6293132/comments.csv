,banukaknight,2011-04-04T17:13Z,"@ everyone...
there's a + PLUS mark... infront of the word saying ""Quality"" .. up in the page....
if you are satisfied with the quality of the picture considering the minimum size it has 
 give a ""+"" and support the encoder..
(register with the site TPB inorder to get this ability)
it's quite clear that there's no better rip when it comes to movies around 300mb on TPB....
so now.. go on then!

----------

me.. Using  Handbrake TO turn movies in to SMALL RIPS in order to save the hard drive space....
but when i set output settings: Container: mp4...
it gives out a m4v file...
how can i make videos in mp4 extection..
someone please help....

---------

what's ""R5""
seems way more better than a screen coppy... but audio.. is not good as a dvd rip...
someone please define..

,justregged,2011-04-04T18:20Z,"@banukaknight

You know you can rename M4v to MP4 in windows, just right click and rename provided you have the ext showing in windows. It makes no major difference, i had to do it with quite a few files in the past as although my media player would play M4v to would not fastforward or rewind so i renamed them to Mp4 and voila it solved the problem. 

As far as R5 is concerned R stands for Region5 which is russia and surrounding areas. So its a russian dvd(so the picture should be dvd quality) but they have to get rid of the audio and sub with english audio which is either from a cam or the headphone jack in a cinema(line audio) or a screener or whatever but sometimes the russian version of a movie is not exactly the same as the american version which is why with an R5 you might get the audio going in and out of sync at a couple of points in the movie. Hope this helps."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-04-04T18:24Z,"R5 is region 5, encoded with professional tools, better video quality.

@mogg666
I dont have PS3 bro, can you pls check this on it, then I can add that info in my torrent description :)

@knight
m4v and mp4, both are almost equal, just use mkvmerge and make it mkv, it's nice. Reduces 2-3MB too, lol

@vivek
Is there good sources available, I dont see any, bloody sunday looks fine.
I love Crime, Violence more . ."

,PaSkaLiS,2011-04-06T01:21Z,"@StyLishSaLH 
I know you didn't, Sony did.
Cinavia is in movies distributed by Sony and only devices with the cinavia hardware can read the cinavia watermark and prevent playback of unauthorized movies (like PS3 firmware 3.10 or higher and some new Blu-ray players)
I think DVDFab can bypass the Cinavia."
,devpat,2011-04-06T01:45Z,"thanks for the upload StyLishSaLH.
