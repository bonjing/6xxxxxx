Jedi Mind Tricks (JMT) is an undergorund hiphop group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Over the past 12+ years, the name Jedi Mind Tricks has become synonmous with raw, gritty underground hip hop. JediÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signiture style has continued to evolve as the group has self-assuredly entered their seconf decade as undisputed leaders within the independent hip-hop landscape; their unique sound, and the movement that it has spawned, is responsible for the sale of over 300,000 units and no less than the genesis of an entire sub-genre of music. JediÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tatooed, gritty and enigmatic frontman Vinnie Paz has worked with a slew of the undergroundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best throughout his career.
