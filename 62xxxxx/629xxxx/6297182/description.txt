Virtualize your CDs, DVD, HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs and get the fastest possible access to your data, both locally and over the network. 
Virtual CD creates images of your optical media, so you can use them at any time without having the physical medium on hand. 
Your data is available exactly as if the medium was in the drive, without the disadvantages attendant, for example, on network shares. 
The images created can be stored on a server to enable simultaneous access by multiple users. 
When creating an image, you have the option of selecting the level of compression and, if desired, even encryption. You get maximum availability of your data, while lost, damaged and stolen media become a thing of the past. 
With a simple left click on the Virtual CD symbol you arrive at the program menu where you can utilize all important Virtual CD functions. 
If you click on the symbol with the right mouse key, the drive menu opens. 
Here you can e.g. insert and eject images or insert blank CDs in the virtual burner.
Not only does Virtual CD serve you with its well-engineered ergonomy, but it also keeps the security of your data in mind. 
To protect sensitive data and to keep files confidential, you can use a virtual DVD RAM blank CD as an encrypted fixed disk with up to 17.5 GB. 
After entering your password, you can read and write your data on it as if you were using a regular fixed disk. 
In the background, Virtual CD codes the data on-thy-fly with the safe AES 256bit-encryption without your noticing anything.
