    The Team descend on the historic Llancaich manor house     
    to investigate an archaeologist's dream. An ancient       
    moat has been discovered in the next field and no one    
    knows what it once protected.                             
                                                               
    It may have surrounded an early Welsh chapel, a Roman     
    Fort, a fortified cattle enclosure, or even the          
    ancestral home of one of Wales's most important           
    families: the Pritchards.                                  
                                                              
    A big empty field with a manor house in it is what       
    geophysics was invented for, but what should be a         
    straightforward search quickly becomes one of the most     
    baffling and frustrating investigations Time Team have    
    undertaken for a long time.                              
                                                              
    As the three-day limit approaches the digging becomes      
    more and more frantic, as fields and gardens are          
    overturned by the diggers trying to get to grips with    
    the missing manor.                                        
                                                               
    Even if very little is as it seems, they do discover      
    that the history of the site goes back thousands of      
    years earlier than they expected.
