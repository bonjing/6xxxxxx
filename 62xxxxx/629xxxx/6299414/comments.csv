,ToekneeNo,2011-04-12T18:15Z,"Hey, I have a problem burning these newer games. Quick background info: Got my xbox 360 modded about 1.5 years ago and every game has loaded right away without a boot disk.

Games like NBA 2k11, Madden 11, and Halo Reach all worked, but recently games like Tiger Woods 12, WWE Allstars, and MLB 2k11 do not load, but they load properly on my cousin's recently modded xbox.

What can I do to fix this problem? Games as recent as Halo Reach have worked, but this last batch of new games isn't working. Do I have to patch the new games? If so, to what wave? Thakns for your help guys "

you can download a boot disk for the new kinect games, i have the same firmware as you but instead of getting it flashed again i got the boot disc for it. You can find it on here just search ""boot"" in games xbox360
Hope that helps."

i have the same firmware if you search for ""boot"" under games xbox360 you can use a boot disc for it, all the kinect games just say play dvd otherwise"
