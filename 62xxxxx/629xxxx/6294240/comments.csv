,jtblue,2011-04-08T04:41Z,"Not having any luck with this. After I extract all the files I try to run the ""Duke.Nukem.HD.2011.v4.2.231-RGC"" application file. From there a small window pops up in russian with yes and no as the only options; I've tried both and nothing seems to happen.

I'm using Windows Vista Home Basic 32bit, if anyone can help me out that would be great."

,BMPRIZ,2011-05-16T11:27Z,"just cuz you have a new computer or are running windows 7 doesnt mean you have a good video card. some older games simply wont run on new equipment. i have a brand new sony vaio. windows 7. 64bit blah blah blah. i bought Crysis 2 also. well it has a hard time playing the actual video in the game. when there are cinematics it almost freezes its running so slow. all i could do is turn down all resolutions in the game. game play is fine now. till it hits a cinematic. so now i guess Ill buy a newer better video card. may have to upgrade a bunch of stuff for the computer. who knows. my computer also runs and burns blu ray, and is high definition. i was dumbfounded when the game glitched lol. i should have just bought a PS3. would have saved me $1200."
,mnexusk,2011-05-24T19:49Z,BMPRIZ you obviosly dont kno how to spend $1200 ona laptop then. crysis 2 isnt the most intensive game great graphics but they built it better. + thinking the laptop will run it just becouse its hd blueray ur pretty dumb. do your reserch mate
,Robertman20,2011-05-26T09:20Z,"@BMPRIZ I got an €800 Acer laptop which runs crysis 2 no lagg. doesn't have blueray but doesn't matter since i Download all my films ;)

@RealSB thanks for the torrent ^^ gives me something to play while I wait for Duke nukem forever! "
,treetops422,2011-05-31T20:59Z,"I played for 5 minutes, it looks great but you missed all the little things that made duke nukem 3d great. In those 5 minutes I noticed you cannot drink out of fire hydrants, which raises your health. You cannot blow up fire extinguishers. Fire doesn't take away health. Yeah go back to the drawing board, beat the original without cheats then come back and add in all the little things."
,ainars1239,2011-06-08T05:55Z,just played works on win 7 64bit sp1
