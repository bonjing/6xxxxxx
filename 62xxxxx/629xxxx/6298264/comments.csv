note to fans: it will be decided in May if they are going to make a series 2"
,Permilupp,2011-04-06T11:04Z,Greatly appreciated EZ.
,Teempla,2011-04-06T11:06Z,"@newme: season 2, not series 2.
And I would say there will be another season. Ratings have gone up in the last couple of episodes."
,Christ_Rock,2011-04-06T11:58Z,"I love this film..
Hope they make the next season..:)"
,The_DooD,2011-04-06T17:43Z,"@Teempla
What's the difference between season and series?"
,mayhemrules,2011-04-06T19:06Z,"@The_Dood:

series: a serialized set of programs; ""a comedy series""

season: a segment of content broadcast on television. It may be a one-off broadcast or part of a periodically recurring television series."
,thordavid,2011-04-06T19:07Z,"thx again for you good work , always reliable , never disappointed "
,nicky12,2011-04-06T19:21Z,"Dude that some good news if there is a season 2,I like this show,thanks!!"
,midnightculture,2011-04-06T20:23Z,"from the end of the season finale it seems like they're gonna make more of it, so keep your fingers crossed for more "
,ears90,2011-04-06T22:39Z,"Note some shows use series instead of season, possibly to show that each season is its own story arc. Therefore each season is a ""serialized set of programmes"". Thus fitting the definition of either a season or series."
,JzSizzle,2011-04-08T02:57Z,"Obviously, the show doesnt have the same ratings as the last syfi show, Lost, did, but I think it may have enough to survive.

I need this show, since Heroes was CANCELLED (which, btw, it had the same # of ratings as this show, perhaps a bit more).

Otherwise, Im stuck watching reruns of old shows.

PS: mabye the show would have more ratings if watched it live, instead of waiting and downloadding it!"
,lucky843,2011-04-13T01:22Z,It will be canceled ratings were to low 
,XanaTsC,2011-04-16T02:50Z,"If you like the show and didn't want it canceled you should have watched it during the original airings. I understand wanting to watch things on your own time, but some shows need the ratings boost. Unfortunately not many people think this way. If I see a show's ratings drop I start watching it the day it airs, just to hopefully help out a little. Of course if the ratings are fine I watch it on my own time. ;)"
,martian_neighbour,2011-05-12T12:27Z,Sigh the show's been canceled already. It's supposed to be 22 episodes for season 1. Can't they just finished filming the last 2 episodes? wtf. I enjoy watching this tv show too bad it's not going to be renewed. !-(
,the12gl,2011-06-29T16:45Z,"look guys i have good news and bad news
