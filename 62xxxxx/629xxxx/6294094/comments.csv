,the_shroud,2011-04-04T17:51Z,"Thx for BK.
Sorry, I'm clueless on AMC's misbehaviours, enjoyed all ur Walking Dead encodes tho"
,Village_Kid,2011-04-04T17:52Z,"Thanks for BK, BOP. I was waiting to see if you did include the Killing.. Great share ."
,petrpan004,2011-04-04T18:02Z,heyy 20-40..can u plz tell me wil b uploadin wrestlemania 27??in small size..
,jmac85,2011-04-04T18:19Z,"So, the aired source of 'The Killing' was bad quality? I have AMC HD and it looks nice and crisp on my 50"" plasma, even though it's only 1080i or 720p (no 1080p from Comca$t yet). I watch movies on AMC all the time. Is this why it's only 352p?
Anyway, -thanks- for this pack. I will grab the small episodes here and see if 'BoB' has them if you won't do them again. We respect your choice.

,justregged,2011-04-04T18:29Z,Hi 20-40 just wondering are you 100% that you won't be continuing the killing as i want to download but dont want to if your definitlly not going to continue with it. Is the quality that bad?
,justregged,2011-04-04T18:31Z,"Nevermind im going to download anyway, i might not even like the show in the first place lol"
,justregged,2011-04-04T18:33Z,"Oh and sorry forgot to say thanks, so thanks a million cheers"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-04T18:55Z,"@jmac85: It's not about company. It's about morons who are responsible for technical quality - and it's proven ugly.

Your ""I have AMC HD and it looks nice and crisp"" is overstatement. Quality of AMC airings is well below modern standards - they act like bunch of childish morons who said ""what this button is for?"", ""hey guys, this slider is marked as ""Grain""... let move them to max and see what would happen""... and other moronic things.

Point being, I am in all this for years, and don't you think that I spoke from immense experience I gathered and not from my ass (as other people tend).

For illustration, just read few lines from Chat this morning:

""D4rkFactor>Another AMC show with eyecancerous video quality... 
D4rkFactor>CTU's HDTV rip is barely watchable.
espenn>I agree, the quality is pretty poor!
quadrick>There is a proper version released by ORENJI.
D4rkFactor>ORENJI is indeed better, but it's still pretty poor cuz of AMC's bad HD feed. 
Hey, it's definitely better than CTU's. :D""

@the_shroud: That's why I have spent 20 hours in encoding ONE episode of Walking Dead - even BluRay one (and you've probably that version on mind, not encodings of airings)."
,jmac85,2011-04-04T19:10Z,"@twentyforty: It wasn't an overstatement at all. Just an observation. I'm finicky about quality and can recognize bad from good. When I say it's crisp, I mean on my TV at the proper distance ~12 ft.) it seems fine. I don't stand 4 feet from TV and examine every pixel. Also, some shows were intended to have extra grain (Battlestar Galactica is an extreme example)...perhaps this is the case?
Also, forgive me. It wasn't my intent to challenge your knowledge or experience."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-04T20:21Z,"@jmac85: It is NOT HDTV. It's - a garbage.
Unfortunately, I still keep original (second airing, a ""better"" one, LOL... first airing was real tragedy)

Just look how 
frame 230
http://bayimg.com/MagPGaadI
and frame 732 look like.

It is not a HDTV, it is below ancient TV, what probably people have in some godforsaken country some twelve years ago."
,froglog,2011-04-04T22:29Z,Thanks
,funpigj,2011-04-05T03:14Z,"Thanks for this pack.  

Sorry to hear you won't be watching/encoding ""The Killing"".  "
,jmac85,2011-04-05T06:26Z,I see what you mean. Those are pretty rotten looking caps. What I don't get is how the logo is so bad looking...
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-05T07:13Z,"@jmac85: Me neither. I bet if they leave equipment on Defaults, airings be quite normal.

From these screen-shots people can see how good outcome is, watching the actual encoding."
,djwasif,2011-04-05T10:15Z,"Hey, twenty-forty....is it possible for u to upload a 480p size of wrestlemania 27??? The existing ones are huge....hard for me to download with a net speed of only 50kbps..:) :)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-05T10:59Z,"@djwasif: Sorry, Wrestlemania and similar events are out of my scope.

But, at least two encoders regularly do small-sized encodes. One is KURYU (rvmb, ~700MB) and CRAZY (mkv, 800MB) but you should get used to Direct downloads and doing plain Google search, for example:

WWE.WM27.crazy.mkv"
,ahmedv,2011-04-05T11:44Z,Thanks for DH
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-05T11:54Z,"@funpigj: I would probably watch The Killing, but I cannot waste 20 hours on cleaning and repairing one show, one episode. In that time, ALL other shows would be on waiting, and, I guess, nobody wants that. That show isn't THAT good.

I can do with easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy approach, offer encodes ""as-is"" but it would be inviting lunatics and morons to paint the walls of my home with their feces, and I am not  crazy about.

One of the best shows ever on American television, my favored, Shameless - was completely out of my schedule, because quality fluctuated so much that I gathered my strenght only to encode last two episodes of first season.

Not to mention AMC idiots, who literary ruined every show they laid hands on, starting with Breaking Bad and perpetual disaster of The Walking Dead airings. They are crazy, and I opted to turn blind eye on their ""eye-cancerous"" production."
,psipsina111,2011-04-05T18:54Z,Thank You! Mildrd and Desperate Housewives.
,funpigj,2011-04-06T06:17Z,"@20 I loved the US Shameless.  I hope Mr Macy is up for an Emmy, he was amazing...

Did you ever watch any of the UK version?  Would it be worth me going back and grabbing (assuming it's still being seeded)"
