NOTE: I am sick and tired of AMC shit. They are bunch of idiots who have ruined
      EVERY single show they aired. I get better quality from YOUTUBE nowadays.
      After stunts they've pulled regarding Walking Dead unimaginable shitty
      airings - I proudly announce: This is the first and last encodes of 
      The Killing (otherwise a good series, probably).
