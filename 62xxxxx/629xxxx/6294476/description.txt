Product Description
Far too often, we humans expect our dogs to understand what we say to them. Though we may spend a lot of time talking to them, weâ€™re really not communicating. And without proper communication, itâ€™s impossible to train a dog properlyâ€“â€“ let alone make your human/canine relationship a rewarding one.

Packed with unique insights and gentle training advice, The Rosetta Bone provides average dog owners with the know-how they need to decipher canine meanings, communicate effectively, increase training success, and share a deeper bond. Focusing on the behavioral basisâ€“â€“ the "silent" symbolsâ€“â€“ for learning, understanding, and communicating, expert dog trainer and competitor Cheryl S. Smith reveals how you can use your own body language to send a message and even teach a dog what specific words mean. She reveals how a dogâ€™s breed can affect his personality and explains how to decodeâ€“â€“ and correctâ€“â€“ common behavior problems. With the knowledge and solutions this book provides, you will train more effectively, enjoy your dog more, and ease your own stress. Whatâ€™s more, youâ€™ll apply what youâ€™ve learned immediately, with solid, practical advice on:

    * Learning the As, Bs, Cs, and Ds of human-canine communication
    * Teaching English to your dogâ€“â€“ and, in turn, understanding "Doglish"
    * Using body language to assist in communication and help your dog learn
    * Incorporating various kinds of touch to tighten your bond
    * Making rewards and reprimands real, relevant, and reliable
    * Understanding the relationship between kids and dogs
