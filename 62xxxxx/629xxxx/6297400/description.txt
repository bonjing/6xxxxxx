Most of these are not my rips and I couldn't track down the original uploader from    Demonoid so Thank You whoever you are! The ones that are my rips (*) are remastered so for the most part unfortenetly brickwalled. I normally wouldn't include both original & remastered versions for 2 of these albums but I figured why not since its just 2 albums and won't increase the file size too much and most importantly some fans probably want nothing to do with the butchered/brickwalled versions. This is all the Triumph I have - if anyone has their debut album (1976) also known as "In The Beginning" for later versions and their last studio album Edge of Excess (1993) please do make available! 

I have some more great Canadian music in the near future so keep your eyes peeled.

From Wiki:

Triumph is a Canadian hard rock power trio that was popular in the late 1970s through the 1980s. Eight of the band's albums were certified gold or higher, and Triumph was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, including Group of the Year Award in 1979, 1985, 1986 and 1987.

Like their fellow Canadians Rush and Saga, Triumph began building their reputation across North America as a live band, peaking in the early to mid 1980s. The band was formed by Toronto music veterans Gil Moore (drums, vocals), Mike Levine (bass, keyboards, producer), and Rik Emmett (singer, songwriter) in 1975. 








Rock and Roll Machine 1977


Rock and Roll Machine was the second album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1977. The album was released on RCA Records in the US in 1978 and again on MCA Records(MCA-1455) in 1980. The album resulted in the band's first hit single, a cover version of Joe Walsh's "Rocky Mountain Way". Depending on the country of issue, the album may also be named Rock & Roll Machine or Rock 'N' Roll Machine. The MCA issue is noteworthy in that the album was re-mastered by Bob Ludwig at his Masterdisk location as opposed to the original RCA which was mastered by Jack Adelman at RCA.

Just a Game 1979


Just a Game is the third studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1979. The album contains their first big hit, "Lay it on the Line" and the near Top 40 hit "Hold On".

The vinyl LP version of the album featured a sleeve that folded open to reveal a board game (though later pressings just contained a regular vinyl sleeve without this.) According to a Rockline interview, the board game was Rik's idea, but Mike was the one who actually designed it and decided to make it impossible to win.

The front cover of the album revealed a futuristic world where every symbol depicts a song featured on the album.

Thunder Seven  1984


Thunder Seven is a concept album by the Canadian Heavy Metal band Triumph, released in November 1984. It was the band's seventh studio album. The album examines the actions and abnormalities of man at the turn of the 21st century.

The album was certified gold in the US by the RIAA, with sales of over 500,000 copies, on April 21, 2003, almost nineteen years after its initial release.
"Follow Your Heart" was the band's highest charting single of the time, reaching #88 in both the UK and the US. Though another single was released under the form of "Spellbound", the single didn't prove as successful, only charting in Canada, and barely scraping the top 100.[1]

Thunder Seven was the last Triumph album to not feature any outside writers; prior to this, no album featured non-band songwriters since Rock and Roll Machine (1977).

The album cover was illustrated by artist Dean Motter and was a mechanized version of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo Da Vinci. The cover is a visible element of the album's concept, in which the band examines the actions and abnormalities of man at the turn of the 21st century.

The Sport of Kings 1986


The Sport of Kings is the eighth album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1986. It was recorded at the band's home studio of Metalworks Studios from May to August 1986.

This is the second-to-last studio album to feature the band's guitarist and primary songwriter Rik Emmett, and it clearly represents the difficulties the band was experiencing at the time. Mike Levine played no keyboards on the album; three outside keyboardists were hired to create the keyboard sounds of the album. Rik Emmett sings lead vocals on six of the album's ten songs with vocals; four songs were sung by Gil Moore, and one track was sung as a duet by the two vocalists. The recording of The Sport Of Kings was marred by tension between Triumph and their label MCA. Perhaps not surprisingly, Emmett has since expressed his dislike for much of the album. Adding to the tension was Emmett's request that the recording be done at Estudio L2K in Majorca. Only three of album's songs has ever been performed live by Triumph, and one track was performed live by Emmett during his first three solo tours.
