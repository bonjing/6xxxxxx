,rigmar_radio,2011-04-06T20:49Z,I am a little confused as I only see the Music MP3 tracks?  Where is the matching CD+G graphics track for each audio?
,bitwi,2011-04-08T12:25Z,These tracks are bought from eurovision.tv's download shop so I don't have any cover to upload.
,rigmar_radio,2011-04-24T14:46Z,"I think you have missed the point here.   Your torrent has the music files but each music file has a CD+G (graphics) file so taking the Beatles for an example you should of uploaded these two files for each track:

Beatles - Help.mp3
Beatles - Help.cd+g

So if this release is a normal Karaoke disc you have to find software on the net (and there is a lot of it about) which will strip the CD+G graphics track as well as the MP3 music track which is what you have only got listed here.

I downloaded the torrent just to check and sure enough, only audio files and no Karaoke graphics files.   Hope this helps."
,rigmar_radio,2011-05-01T10:24Z,Well I see this torrent is still being seeded but again a warning to all in the SWARM...  THIS IS THE AUDIO ONLY and unless you know the lyrics and can make a CD+G file out of them and some how sync it with these audio only files this torrent is a waste of your bandwidth...  did warn you all

,RikS11,2011-05-16T21:56Z,"On this CD isn't a CD+G file, because this are the instrumental versions of the songs."
