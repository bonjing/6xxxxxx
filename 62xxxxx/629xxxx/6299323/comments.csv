Just follow the directions unzip and use Z-Zip, install OpenAL and Microsoft Visual C 2008 & 2010 Redistributable.

Thanks for the upload Stun!"

,baba02,2011-04-19T14:47Z,"Thxs for the download, went pretty quick :D, but ive got a problem with installing, I've got all these Vace files which i have exracted with rar, then they jsut apear as Vace files again, and i dont no what to do with them :("
,evildog112,2011-05-03T01:56Z,when i run setup.bat it tells me that v-textures has stopped working. what should i do?
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-05-20T14:58Z,"After installing 1 - 3 vace releases I've found that running the setup.bat through a elevated cmd windows makes it work perfectly.

If you are not running UAC and you are not currently using any AV disregard these steps and simply run the bat as normal

-- Simple Steps --
Open the start menu, type cmd

press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER

Accept the UAC popup, cd to your folder with the 4 files. (It's a good idea to just extract the files to like ""C:\"" and ""cd C:\""

Then type ""setup.bat""

and everything should install smoothly"
,Judas101,2011-06-12T03:25Z,Get error missing .dll file when trying to run game... any suggestions?
,nokanomi,2011-06-25T22:38Z,"uh I'm a bit stumped here, you see, i have been unable to find a ""setup.bat"" or any REAL file of any kind, i have an idea, but i might be wrong, well, you see how it says on the files .001 .002 etc.? well when i look at the file type vace.001 is a 001 file....meaning that everything after the . changes the file type. so really i have no idea what type of files these are supposed to be (as in iso images etc.) so could somebody help me in that regard? i followed the instructions as far as i could and all i have is a folder with the files
file_id.diz
vace.001 through vace.026 (note that these are considered file types 001- 026 as in under file type it says 001 file- 026 file)
vace (system information file)
I'm running on windows vista if it means anything, could anyone help?"
,nokanomi,2011-06-26T00:38Z,"cancel that, apparently the files are actually archives, just to let you know ( as in, download 7-zip, and open archive ) but now I'm having a different problem, can't figure out how to get the setup.bat to work, it always says no matter how i open the bat file (through command prompt or the cmd prompt method above or the double click the .bat file method)  it says either ""cannot find v-logo"" or "" *file path* v-logo is not a recognized command"" if it means anything, when i try to open all the 26 parts as an archive in 7 zip and extract to the directory where I'm using now, it says ""vace.v is broken"" even though it doesn't stop the extract,  so i just open the first file only and extract vace.v from there, any helpers?"
,soldierofthelam,2011-08-14T23:17Z,"Failed,

setup.batch doesn't patch in the right order causing the game to crash and have multiple problems for 64bit windows 7 users!!"
,bluMyst,2011-10-25T05:11Z,"I can't get vace.exe to extract vace.v on 64-bit Vista. It just says ""could not open as archive"" or something like that."
,qqlanu,2011-10-27T16:57Z,"1.unzip
2.unrar(select all rars, rightclick extract)
3.run setupbat
4. download and install official patches(from 1.7.0 -->) including latest 1.1
5. play
The version displays correct (1.1) but i haven't played more than 3 hours to check if its really ok. It was a fantastic surprise to see this version of game patched up to date. Please notify us if u guys encounter problems, and thank you for the torrent."
,uberknight72,2011-10-31T12:58Z,"WHERE IS THE SETUP BAT?!?!?!  I have read EVERY comment and did every single direction but there is one factor that keeps eluding me, THE DAMN SETUP.BAT!  I hear you all say, ""just run the setup bat""  but it is nowhere to be found.  What am I doing wrong?"
,bibibibibibibbi,2011-11-06T11:29Z,Doubleclick vace.001 and select winrar. After u unrar the archives there should be setupbat under vace.exe
