Roddy Frame, a native of East Kilbride near Glasgow, Scotland, formed AZTEC CAMERA in 1980. During 1992 Roddy worked on the fifth AZTEC CAMERA album in New York with producer/musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. The album DREAMLAND was released May 17th 1993. 
The music is gentle and for the most part romantic, but not annoying. At times melancholy, at times provocative; you'll hear romantic ballads and soulful Jazz, or upbeat fun tunes. Lyrics are never boring or superficial but deep and purposeful.
