I am forced to be a knowledge thief! Hence my user name. 
Good thing I am not a Muslim (I am a spiritual atheist, if that oxymoron makes sense to you). Otherwise, I would have lost my hands and would*ve been forced to steal, in order to survive. 
I wouldn*t have to steal knowledge, if I could feed my wondering mind, with educational programs like these, instead of the junk T.V. thatâ€™s trying so hard to sell me tampons, cars, and the rest of the worthless junk I don*t need, like, or want, in the name of jobs an economy. Thank you BBC for so many years of propagating knowledge and education when others call it propaganda.

If you are of the same mind, please seed if you want to propagate knowledge and understanding. The alternative is ignorance, hate and war. 
Hopefully, the guillotine will have a comeback and our esteemed politicians will feel that sharp blade around their necks.

In short, if you want to make a difference, seed as much as you are able. There is no substitute for knowledge.
I seed to 150% due to limitations of my ISP (100 GB/Month). If you can do better, please do it and educate our worldâ€¦
