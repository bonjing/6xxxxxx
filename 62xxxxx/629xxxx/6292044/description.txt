Ch4 The Battle of Hood and Bismark 1of2 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2002

In May 1941, the most dramatic sea battle of World War II took place. Its protagonists were the two mightiest capital ships of the era - the German battleship Bismarck and the British battle cruiser Hood. Their confrontation resulted in the destruction of both warships and the loss of over 3,500 lives. In 2001 - the 60th anniversary of this apocalyptic battle - David Mearns led an expedition that discovered the wreck of Hood for the very first time and revisited the wreck of Bismarck. As well as tracing the history of these awe-inspiring vessels and the events that led to their fatal clash, this two-part documentary chronicles the progress of this mission.

Part 1. Mighty Hood
Sixty years after the loss of two of the greatest battleships ever launched, Channel 4 mounted an ambitious expedition to locate and film HMS Hood and Bismarck. Both were sunk several miles under the sea - too deep even for nuclear submarines to reach. In the first of two feature-length documentaries, extraordinary evidence is provided by the expedition into the mystery of Hood's sinking.
