,newsride,2011-04-04T13:46Z,Thank you for your posting. But your have two r00 r04 has incomplete error and unrared and make iso has volume crashed. Without Par I can not recovery (fixed). I download twice and has same it. Twice checked with SFV. Why don't you post ISO file instead of  breaked Rars. Plz iso post.
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-04-04T17:20Z,"try this way as some user posted on other torrent :

I have to be honest ;)

I got the mec.simul. 100%, removed it from uTorrent and right-click extract on the single .rar file.

It gave error-msg on the iso just before end of extract. This it did twice.

Later i tried again - still on the single .rar, knowing that rar continues by itself to next.. and by surprise it finished without any errors

totally weird

maybe uTorrent still had it's claws on something though the DL was removed from uTorrent... "
,zappaz123,2011-04-04T20:50Z,"I had errors too before - It was me with that comment !

Maybe uTorrent and some other proggy like winRAR collide or something with the way uTorrent OR Windows caches files make the extraction fail.

Nevertheless close uTorrent / reboot Bill Gates and try again ! 

good luck and may the devil close Gadaffi's mouth with Gadaffi-tape."

[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-04-04T21:40Z,"Enjoy the uploads :)
@newsride

zappaz123 figured out and explained , so i hope you will get it to work also. As i really dont know the answer why it is like this. Download - close the utorrent as it uses the files because of seeding and then try to unrar. After installing please open the utorrent again and seed for others what you enjoy :)

Thanks."

,BUGGIE_X,2011-07-04T16:12Z,"My problem solved....     needed to read the install.txt to the end and found the answer to my question:

Make sure you are running the Keygen as administrator and with UAC off on Vista or Windows7   but you have to anyway to install Adesk products."
,ada357345,2011-09-20T15:05Z,"Problem:
after approx 50% instalation it is asking me to insert DVD 1 of 2

Solution:
Extract the ISO file content (with WinRAR) to a new folder and start setup.exe from there.

Note: Make sure you extract to a location where the file path is not too long otherwise the extraction process will fail extracting some files because of the 255 character limit in the file path. In other words, extract to the root directory of drive C:\AutoCAD, D:\AutoCAD, or any other drive."
