The film tells the grotesque story of a large family living in an extremely poor
 shantytown of the periphery of Rome. The main protagonist is one-eyed patriarch
 Giacinto (Manfredi). Four generations of his sons and relatives are cramped together
 in his shack, managing to get by mainly on thieving and whoring, among other things
 more or less respectable.
For the loss of his eye, an insurance company has paid Giacinto a large sum.
 Moved by greed, the whole family (including his wife, who is enraged by Giacinto's
 bringing home a fat prostitute he has fallen in love with, and who has become his mistress)
 try to poison him in order to inherit the money. However, Giacinto survives.
 In a frenzy of anger, he sets fire to his home and shoots one of his sons with
 a hunting rifle (the son survives).
In the meantime Giacinto has sold the house to a Neapolitan immigrant family.
 The film ends with Giacinto living in a newly built exceedingly crowded shack
 with both his mistress and his wife, together with an apparently reconciliated
 family and the newcomers as well.
