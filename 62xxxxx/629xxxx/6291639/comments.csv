,taitiez,2011-04-24T01:50Z,"How about someone seed this great show.....
330+ peers and only 2 seeders.

It has taken 2-3 days to get this far and we are all stuck on 65%.....please seeeeeeed!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,boris72,2011-05-16T05:30Z,"Thank you very much for the up, but why would you keep it in .iso format? Why not rip it to .avi or .mkv so it only has to be done once instead of hundreds of times by everybody that downloads? My only complaint, otherwise I'm very thankful."
,oldmanmacka,2011-12-05T10:30Z,"Hi, am looking forward to finishing this 4.2Gb download but its extremely slow - please seed. Must agree for 6 episodes this 4.2Gb is rather large download & very time consuming. Have heard much about this series & been told its a crackup and most likely be more series further down the track, so please seed :-)"
