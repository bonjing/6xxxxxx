Garfield is back and this time Garfield and his canine sidekick Odie follows 
their owner, Jon Arbuckle, to England, the U.K. may never recover, as Garfield 
is mistaken for a look-alike, regal cat who has inherited a castle. Garfield 
savors the royal treatment afforded by his loyal four-legged subjects, but his 
reign is in jeopardy! The evil nefarious stubborn Lord Dargis is determined to 
do away with Garfield, so he can turn the castle into a resort. Garfield's 
bigger, better, more perfect world is soon turned upside down in this tale of 
two kitties.
