A tribute to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys starring an unbelievable lineup of music stars from past and present. There are stellar performances from Vince Gill, David Crosby, and the Go-Gos. Finished up by a performance from the man himself, Brian Wilson. He ends with a song with the beautiful message that we all need to hear, Love & Mercy. Hope you enjoy.
