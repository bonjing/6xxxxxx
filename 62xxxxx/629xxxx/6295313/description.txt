Ubuntu comes with all the support you need and powers the most popular computers - on servers, desktops, notebooks and netbooks.

INSTALLATION:

1) You can burn the iso to a dvd-r or a cd-r and boot it as you would when installing your OS. You can either wipe your hard drive and use this as your primary and only OS or you can partition your hard drive to dual-boot with Windows.
2) You can use VMware to create a virtual hard drive and run windows along with Ubuntu simultaneously. You can either create the virtual machine using the iso or you can burn it to a dvd-r or cd-r and boot it from there.

Hope you guys enjoys this and be sure to seed. I will be uploading more torrents once there are plenty of seeds.

REMINDER:

This is the 64-Bit version of Ubuntu 10.10. If you are running on a 32-Bit system then this version will not work. I will be uploading the 32-Bit version soon.

PEACE,
Angelus
