Be a good seeder and leecher. Do not just take. 

Give back to the torrent community what they give to you.

Remember after a torrent has finished please seed till at least a 1.5 ratio.

Remember to seed after the torrent file has finished. Seeding is how Bit-Torrents are kept alive. You were able to download the torrent because someone else was seeding it for you."
