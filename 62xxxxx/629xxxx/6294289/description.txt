Losing his roles to Steven Seagal and a custody battle over his young daughter, the international action hero is struggling to maintain relevancy on levels both professional and personal. JCVD is a sad, seriocomic meta-movie that may recall BEING JOHN MALKOVICH or one of Charlie Kaufman's many other ontological curios in the minds of some viewers.

Personal comments: The last thing you'd expect from a Van Damme movie, JCVD (his initials) gets a little too caught up in the uninteresting subplot to be a true classic but it's a must-see none-the-less.
