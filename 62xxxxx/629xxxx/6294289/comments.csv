So when zingooo says that the movie's spoken language is in English and French, he's not talking about audio options, he's talking about the actual dialogue.

Granted, most of the movie is in French, while some scenes are spoken in English, like when Van Damme is talking to his American talent agent.  Just thought I'd clear that up.  Carry on."
