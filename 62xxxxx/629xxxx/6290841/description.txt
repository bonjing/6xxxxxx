The Listener S02E07: Ace in the Hole

A CSIS agent's suspicious death kicks off a probe that exposes a high-stakes poker game, and the case pairs Tony with Michelle's estranged husband.

Kris Holden Ried (who plays on Dyson on Lost Girl) guest stars in this episode.

This episode aired on CTV on April 1, 2011.

The video quality is quite watchable, but not as nice as a scene release (video is somewhat blurry/grainy). The scene release from 2HD was an episode from Blue Bloods, so until/unless there is a REPACK/PROPER this is probably all there is. The source was HD, but this is not a digital capture. 

I know the filesize is below the standard 350MB. I'm not a pro like the scene folks, so sometimes that happens with the software I use.
