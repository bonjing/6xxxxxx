,Liro_Raeriyo,2011-04-25T04:03Z,No sound
,Carsonx,2011-04-25T14:25Z,@Liro_Raeriyo - Suggestions would be to turn your volume up or get a media player with some updated codecs (try VLC)... cuz it ain't the files.
,pamellka,2011-05-12T09:26Z,"Um, is it dubbed or subbed?"
,Carsonx,2011-05-12T23:04Z,@pamellka - they are all english with the exceptions of the few episode that were unaired in America. Those are Japanese with subs.
,Carsonx,2011-05-13T00:35Z,Let me update my own comment and say these all of these are English. No japanese episodes.

,yodasdad64,2011-09-30T05:46Z,"Great torrent, thanks! BUT: Why do so many episodes not have the theme song? It kind of detracts from the experience."

,1absplinter,2012-05-21T19:57Z,"Sound does work! just use a different program as it didn't work in Windows Media Player.
Will be seeding every night."
,Dark.Cold,2012-05-28T15:56Z,"Thanks.
There's only one problem...Everytime I start qBittorrent I have to download the torrent again and  wait 'till it checks.. But that's only me probably.
Also, about the sound I use media player classic because my computer is old as shit and it works perfectly (I have a good codec pack anyways).
Video is great.
Audio is great."
,mangg24,2012-05-30T16:03Z,plz seed thanks
