Couldn't find a trusted source for Insidious in ENGLISH."
,Manderz,2011-04-17T03:00Z,I downloaded it but have no vision. Sound is fine however. Is there a missing codec or something? I tried downloading the VLC Player but my antiviral software is telling me it's harmful to my computer so I'm a little nervous. Please RSVP. Thanks.

Good Luck:)"
