did you burned it well?"
,GreatFoxMK3,2011-04-27T08:51Z,"@Ruthenford: if this is PS2, that means if I burn a copy, I can play on my PS2?"
,ruthenford,2011-04-27T19:09Z,"only if you have a modded PS2 able to play downloaded and burned games...
if you have a modded PS2 just burn the .ISO file in a DVD with alcohol 120% and thats all you are ready to play"
