[T],MelloYello,2011-04-06T01:53Z,I bought this from Wal-Mart today for $5.  I ripped the dvd and encoded it so check it out.  I forgot to add that this is a Full Screen movie as are most of the old classic movies. (I just downloaded Casablanca and Gone With The Wind and they were also full screen)  Enjoy!
,gwapsako,2011-04-06T06:56Z,"what software do you use to rip dvds (& to what format) before encoding them with handbrake? 
just curious man"
[T],MelloYello,2011-04-06T07:22Z,For this I used Magic Dvd Copier. I select main movie and that gets rid of the menu and extras and then rip it to my hard drive.  I had Magic Dvd Ripper but it only worked a few times and then it kept saying I needed to register it even though I already did.  So I figured just rip it using Magic Dvd Copier and just change target to my hard drive.
