The torrent's taking a while to initially propagate because I have low upload bandwith."

Ignorance is bliss until you know about these things. :D
How to Edit & save as FLAC using Audacity? Save as WAV or AIFF first. Then convert to FLAC using a decent FLAC converter. FLAC can contain audio tags, descriptions & artwork btw, similar to mp3 id3 tags.
Thanks for the upload & the references."
