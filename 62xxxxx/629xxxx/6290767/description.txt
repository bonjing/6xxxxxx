Thanks for the original upload

I fixed the filenames and tags to so as to align those names with what was actually played.

I used Audacity to do the following; I otherwise left the tracks alone:
I split John Paul Jones' Mellotron solo and the immediately following Thank You into separate tracks.
I moved the How Many More Times intro from the end of the Thank You track to the beginning of the How Many More Times track. (Putting the intro to a song on the previous track is something that often frustrates me about live recordings in general.)
