,puunjab,2011-04-07T21:15Z,"The reason people don't put the IMDB links in is so many movies suck so bad, no one would ever download them."

,sillykumquat,2011-04-10T21:43Z,"Interesting, the audio was funky. this would be cool on HD tvs, i wouldnt watch it unless it was on a decent TV. V=10 A=5 M=4"
,Philonetic,2011-04-12T14:06Z,"@divxclub
There is software out there to make anything 3D including movies and games.  One you might want to check out is iZ3D and TriDef, but there are also total converters that will split any video format into side-by-side 3D(if you take your 3D films and watch them on a non-3D screen it shows 2 cells side by side, which is what you're using)."

DVDs are 720x400 (or 720x480), *not* 848x480. 

Did you upsample this, or is it from a higher-res superbit DVD, or what..? "
