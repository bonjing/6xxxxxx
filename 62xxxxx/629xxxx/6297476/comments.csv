,hgreezy,2011-04-09T03:36Z,a/v? video I assume is passable..howzabout the audio?
,marsroverX,2011-04-14T03:31Z,"A/V is ok, has two chairs in the way of some parts. Audio is horible, sounds like your underwater or something. I would rather pay the 10 bucks for a ticket."
,Radio_Static,2011-04-25T16:45Z,caution all potention downloaders not only is this torrent the worst possible quality but it is also a plant... this morning i got an e-mail from my service provider warning me that warner brothers may be on to me because of this torrent
