These stories may sound like fictional plotlines in a dramatic TV show, but Dr. Philâ€™s guests are not actors on a scripted drama â€” they are living a nightmare filled with deadly consequences.

An Act of Self-Defense?
Shannon says she was trapped in a violent marriage until one ugly fight led her to shoot and kill her husband. She is being charged with first-degree premeditated murder, but some experts say all evidence points to self-defense. Facing life in prison without parole, Shannon shares why she couldnâ€™t leave her allegedly abusive husband. 

Attempted Murder
Donna and Marc were attacked in their sleep by their 18-year-old daughterâ€™s boyfriend. You may be shocked to learn who was behind the murder plot, and why this couple feels more victimized by the court system than the person who planned their death. 

Sisters on a Mission
Carla and Jeane are fighting for justice after their sister, Monica, was murdered while on a family vacation in Mexico. Monicaâ€™s husband, Bruce Beresford-Redman, a former producer for the hit reality show, Survivor, became the prime suspect in her death. Find out why Carla and Jeanne are convinced he killed their sister and what they say theyâ€™re doing to make sure he doesnâ€™t get away with it.
