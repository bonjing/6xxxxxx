Unfortunately the author should stick to teaching in the classroom. The book is full of errors and the structure of each chapter jumps all over the show and seems to be incomplete in a lot of cases. The downloadable code from the publishers site differs from what is shown in the book and classes and packages are constantly changing names without warning. The author seems very knowledgeable but do not expect to be guided through the process of making the Twitter/Yamba app step by step."
