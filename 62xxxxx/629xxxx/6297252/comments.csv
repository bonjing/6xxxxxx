,s.lanso,2011-04-12T00:06Z,"As not letting me edit torrent. For what I have seen, it won't ask you to buy it if only you have wifi and data off. If you have it turned off you it will not ask you and won't check the internet. Just giving you guys an update. So each time you restart your phone have wifi and data off or you'll have tor reinstall SPB Shell. "

,jayalaba,2011-04-12T22:28Z,"Here is crack guys, 
1) Install apk, but don't run it yet. (Please uninstall first and delete the old file if you have.) 
2) Open terminal (get from market if you don't have it, I use Terminal Emulator) 
3) type the following replacing [enter] with the enter key: 
su[enter] 
pm disable com.spb.shell3d/com.softspb.shell.service.LicenseService    (then just hit enter)
4) if it asks for license later on you can renable the shell by opening terminal and typing: 
su[enter] 
pm enable com.spb.shell3d/com.softspb.shell.Home     
let me know if you have any issues Please.."

I tried the command in android terminal emulator 
su doesnt work. Acces denied and when I try the commands afterwards, it says ""killed"" but doesnt do anything. Still asked me for the purchase and after the second command home came out of the application. any help or should I just use an other emulator ?   
And does your phone need to be cracked or rooted for this to work ? "
