This is kind of a trial of SPB Shell 3D. 

As I'm new to this.

This will be good if you want to try it out without having to buy the app. 

Condition of the app. 

Install the app

click home --> select SPB Shell 3D

it would take a little longer to load for the first time.

A pop up will appear saying to buy app or exit click exit and you should be able to stay in the app. 

Here's the condition, if you restart or get out of app you won't be able to go back without uninstalling it and reinstalling it. 
So that's the bad think, you can't just try it out for a week, until you don't turn off your phone or get out of the app. 

But hope this helps you guys out in knowing if it is a app worth paying for or trying to find a hacked one that I could not find. 

I know most of you looking here are looking for free ones but this is my first upload. Let me know if there's something wrong.
