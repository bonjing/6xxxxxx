But, the slim possibility of you /actually/ being on the team that made this movie - although more likely you were the coffee guy, or some asshole in the basement of his house trying to gain some credit - this only aired in like 3 theaters in Canada, you are sure going to make a lot of money that way.

Just to let you know. I DID purchase the on-demand version, but your film is so good that I can't stand to wait to see it again until it comes on on bluray. I'd be willing to bet about 80% of the people who are downloading this torrent will see how amazing your film is and will end up buying it when it's available."
,Chaps24,2011-04-05T07:10Z,"@eisner
Hahahaha just watched.  Fucking brilliant.

Don't be so worried about piracy.  I like to support good film making, and I loved this so I will buy it.  You wouldn't go to a clothing store and buy a shirt if you didn't know if it would fit; I wouldn't buy a car without test driving it, and I feel exactly the same way about movies.  If you produce a piece of garbage and you waste my time, then that is all the payment you will get.  If however, it 'fits me' and I like it, then I'll buy it to support and have it to watch when I want to again.

I know you're a small time filmmaker, but the movie industry as a whole needs to understand that we're in an era where the consumer has this option.  If you create something great and people love it then it will do well, even though obviously everyone who downloads something won't buy it.

The same goes for TV as well.  Ever notice how more and more shows are being created that are able to do long, multi-season story arcs.  These couldn't exist in the past, because not everyone has the time to sit down and watch a show at 9:00 every Wednesday.  Torrents made it possible for quality shows to survive, just as they're making it easier for quality filmmaking to thrive."

I also made an account just to comment!

I just wanted to let you know, i will not buy your movie... even if i like it. I wont pay for ANY movie unless its in the theaters, and i am dying to see it, and even then i cheap out and sneak candy in. The simple fact that i didn't know your movie existed until i saw it HERE eliminated any chance of me paying for it. 

Now ask yourself would you rather me not see your movie or for me to see your movie? Do you want me to tell all my friends about your movie or tell no one at all(only 1 of my friends actually Downloads movies)? Do you want ""your"" unknown movie to even have a chance at being remembered?    

I'm a musician and if i woke up and saw my album was downloaded by 10,000 people i would probably die of euphoria, because i know it means my album is great and each of those ten thousand people will tell all there friends and my album goes from a something that i had to pay for to an album that is profiting, even if a small amount of people buy it(which is more likely in the music business) i will have a bunch of new fans coming to concerts, buying merch and buying the next album, just like you would have a bunch of new fans coming to see your next movie and buying all that merch that you'll have for it do to your new big deal with some big ass movie studio. 


The simple fact is you gave your paycheck back before the movie was on pirate bay and your now your taking out your frustrations on pirate bay and pirating, my advice to you is don't come up here and tell fucking ten thousand walking advertisements to stop stealing your movie and that they are bad if they do!(Because they will feel bad and get on here comment that they will actually buy it, when in all reality they wont and will never mention your movie to anyone. Some wont even download it.) If anything say ""thanks for watching & DLing, if you like it please tell all your friends. I gave up my paycheck for you guys ;D, and i want my movie to do good so i can make another one. Then you can have another great movie to watch and enjoy!    

Anyways, its better for the industry, only good movies will get free advertisements and make any money at all! PIRATEBAY FTW

But I download movies.. my country sucks balls for getting movies, some of them are already in the $2 bin in the US before we even get them in the cinema.. or they edit out 50% of the movie because our fragile aussie minds might implode. It's shit. It's a shitty industry... from that perspective..
with that in mind I've bought, legit, over 1000 dvd's, I've also had stolen, about 700 of them. People steal that shit off me all the fucking time... but I get on with it.. I just download the movie so I have it again...
where do you draw the line?
I want film makers to keep making awesome films, but if we can't watch the movie, and when we finally buy it some asshole steals our copy... we can get a bit frustated. It's certainly not the film makers fault, it's just a shitty world we live in.
It's cool though..... I'm in a band now, we're so shit no one will EVER download our music.. it'd be like getting some fucked up virus, or worse.

Wow, it's nice to see that real people actually do exist in the movie making industry these days. 

I always read the comments before I download something, and I'm glad I read yours before I did. I know this is probably of no consolation, but I will not download your movie, but instead will purchase it when it comes out, and tell my friends to do the same, it's nice to see someone actually standing behind their work, and putting some passion into it.

If only the movie industry and recording industry had the same outlook and passion. Instead it's easier for them to spend millions, release sub-par films, and spend even more money to catch the people trying to download them. 

I hope you can see past the juvenile comments made by some of the posters, and realize that we aren't here to rob you of your money. I hope that the other people reading these comments will think twice, and go out and buy your film.

Donwloading now, and looking forward to it after reading all the comments.

I will watch your movie and if i like it i will buy it. Id rather buy a good indi movie than a good Hollywood movie just like the idea of supporting the little man :)

@jasoneisener. I'll come out and say it. 

There are SOOOO many bullshiters puting comments in these areas that I am very reluctant to believe your the director just because your USERNAME is the same as the directors. 

If I change my USERNAME to sethgreen, does that mean I AM Seth Green and am the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Robot Chicken on Adult Swim. . . OF COARSE it doesn't mean that. There are so many people on this site that are a so easily manipulated. 
WHAT REAL PROOF has this guy with the username of the actual director given us to prove that he IS in fact the true director. ASK him to mention the release date because I just looked it up and know exactly when it is. SO if no one else will ask, I will, WHEN IS this going to be released in the theaters and where?

Just because someone is the ""DIRECTOR"", doesn't mean they are also the person that put out the cash to make the film. Has everyones mind just suddenly turned to mush????? 
Another reason I don't believe this is the real Jason Eisener is the frequency that this impostors statements contradict the info at the IMDB which lists all the Individuals and or companies that are involved with putting up the funds to make this film. 
As another TPB member pointed out, if Charlie Sheen was getting over a milion dollars per episode, what in the hell do you think RUTGER HAUER is going to demand for a full length motion picture.

Are we to believe that the Director pulled 5 or 6 million off his VISA to retain RUTGER HAUER for a script he wrote. I THINK NOT!!!!
This is right from the IMDB: Company Credits-
Production Co: Rhombus Media, Whizbang Films Inc., Yer Dead Productions. 

From what I read at the IMDB, Jason Eisener and all the actors, staff and everyone involved have been PAID!!!! "

Here is another of this impostors mounting LIES:  He claims that, and I quote, ""I gave my pay check BACK to production so the film could be made. It's hard for indy movies to make back their budget. - Again, the info at the IMDB is in direct contradiction to this statement.

HELLO people!!!! A true indy film which this isn't,  Are literally made on a shoe string budget and cannot get actors like RUTGER HAUER. 

A film like ""CLERKS"" IS a true indy film and literally was paid for on Kevin Smith's own CREDIT CARDS. If you have seen this film, note it was shot in Black and White to save money. 

GOTO the IMDB and you will see the list of investors and the names of the SEVERAL production companies. This was HARDLY an ""independent"" movie project. It stars  Rutger Hauer, Gregory Smith and Robb Wells. come on people, wise up!!! Rutger Hauer. He is a BIG Name actor. he was in BLADE RUNNER, (a RIDLEY SCOTT film) he was in the original HITCHER, he was the crazy priest in SIN CITY!!!! I swear this person using the USERNAME of:  IS NOT and DID NOT direct this film. The real Jason Eisener has NO REASON to post any comment here. He's talking like he paid for the movie himself. 
If you goto the IMDB, you will see that there is a SLEW of producers that advanced money for this film to be made. Like Rutger Hauer is going to FRONT his time on the promise of some independent movie maker to pay him later, or as this BS artist claims, he gave his paycheck back to cover expenses. . . . LIE LIE LIE LIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If he is the writer and the Director, would he really get a paycheck like an employee of a WAL-MART GETS???? DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE????

Don't forget Rutger's awesome Dutch roots with Paul Verhoeven: Soldier of Orange, Spetters, Turkish Delight, Flesh+Blood. In all honesty though his career has seemed on the downward path for a long time now and I wouldn't be surprised if he picked up a role in a movie he thought the script was great on for pittance or promisary notes from film sales on the offchance that it'd be good for his career which hopefully it is."

1) Excellent movie, hope enough comes in out of it to convince you to make something else.  Exploitation flix walk a fine line between entertainment and pure tastelessness, and this really hits the right note.

We """"Pirates"""" , or """"people who share""""..

Will make this movie bigger than you ever thought it could be , considering the lack of funds available for big budget advertising.

You will be surprised at how big and useful we are.
Many an independent artist has profited from the free distribution and promotion from, file sharers ( usually FANS ).

Please , don't be alarmed by the Mafia propaganda , and what it has led you to believe.
( research the facts , it is propaganda ), 
be grateful.

eg.
*** ever heard of a TV show called Heroes ?

It was first shown on U.S tv. 
Pirated (shared) for the whole world, before ANY foreign TV was even interested in it.

By the end of the first season.. Millions of people from outside the US had  (pirated) seen the show.

The buzz created by file shares , got the show picked up on , one of practically , every countries tv networks.
The worldwide success of Heroes was partly created by file sharers.
We seen it , loved it , told EVERYONE we knew about how good it was.

.== 
you have nothing to fear from """"pirates"""".

ps. We don't """"steal"""" ,  We SHARE !

Also.. we Share , something that can be copied infinity at near ZERO cost.

There's a lot of people who fail miserably at doing so, hence dead torrents, & fuck you people, you know who you are.  but piracy is not about theft; at least not directly.  Granted, had an asshat like michael bay made this movie, by all means, fuck him, steal the movie.  A true independent feature, however, does need to be supported.  Buy the tshirt, buy the poster, show some love; if you really want creative, outside-the-box films (or music, or whatever) done by creative, outside-the-box people, you're gonna have to feed the capitalist system, that's life.  But i, for one, am willing to shell out cash once the DVD is released, 'cause i don't want to see hollywood & the riaa shit out some lady gaga feature length without knowing that gems like this are also being made- for every jerry bruckheimer out there we need a Lloyd Kaufman.

,Blkthrn,2011-04-07T07:16Z,"Jason,

I can tell that you have intelligence, simply by your change in tone as far as the piracy goes. Yes, with big ticket items, piracy can put a ding in sales, a very small ding, but a ding whatsoever. However, it's looked at with this view: With the big ticket items, the profit gained completely and utterly trumps the profit lost by pirates, and to a point that it is nearly negligible. Propaganda spewing unions such as the MPAA, the RIAA, and their international equivalents don't take this into account when they spread their filth. They group the numbers, and put the numbers generated by the profits gained into their pockets... a place their eyes will not see. They then flaunt the ESTIMATED profits lost in front of their faces, and in front of the faces of anyone interested in looking. Together, yes, this number is massive; however, as with any percentage, this number is still completely and utterly trumped by the profits gained.

With independent films such as this, however, it is a different story. As to whether this is a sad story, or a happy one... well, it's a hot debate. Before networked piracy such as this was adopted, independent artists had to rely on local word of mouth for their products to gain locomotion. This meant that a lot of them were squashed by the advertising efforts of big ticket media products.

Then came piracy. Piracy opens the eyes of everyone.  As far as the consumer goes, it's the ultimate try before you buy. For others, it's a free movie. Piracy is like the plague which hit Europe in the middle ages... though it's positive, and not negative. For the unions such as the MPAA and RIAA, it's lost revenue; not only do they miss out on fees the artist will never see, they spend massive amounts on the war on drugs... I mean piracy, in order to squash it. Much like the war on drugs reference, it's not going anywhere, and it's here to stay."
,Blkthrn,2011-04-07T07:21Z,"But for the aspiring actor, director, or even stage hand, it's free publicity. You can use the success from the piracy to build up a resume that not only shows off a portfolio of your work, but also displays how it was received by the masses, or by your intended audience. With this, that aspiring actor, director, or any other part of the production can hope to eventually land a job working with bigger ticket productions.

For the production itself, piracy allows it to spread throughout a world-wide setting like a plague, and it will reach an audience which you could never have dreamed it would ever possibly reach without the help. This increases the possibility of people buying the product simply by them actually knowing the product exists. Piracy is essentially free advertising, and though it may hurt your revenue, if you produce a good film, or album, people will be inclined to buy it. Would you rather 2% of the population of North America possibly buy the film, or would you like to see 10% of North America as potential customers? (These aren't accurate percentages, however, you should see what I'm getting at.)

Think about how piracy can affect your production. Will it hurt more than it will help? For your money gripes; the world runs on some form of currency. You have to spend money to make it. Think about the long term. Don't just think about what this film can bring, but consider what the future films can bring... think about how it can benefit your cast and production crew. Think about ALL of the possibilities.

This guy made an independent movie in Canada, he hardly represents ""the industry"" which  is soooo evil for providing entertainment for people. Just imagine what your pathetic lives would be like without it! Why don't you start your own fucking entertainment industry if you hate how much dvds cost... I bet it will be awesome considering the fact that no one will be making any money but just doing it out of the kindness of their hearts. Here's some food for thought: if you think dvd prices are too high, you're obviously a huge fucking failure because it costs about the same as a quarter tank of gas... I bet you wouldn't do anything about that. But you will attack the director of an indie movie that you just jacked off the internet instead of paying $7 to see it? Ha! You fuckers are pathetic.

This is free advertising, allow donations, sell collector DVDs and other related stuff on your site. Engage with the folks you see as thieves and we may well turn into fans. VODO just does that and it seems to work.

I have never, nor would ever, have heard about this movie if I had not stumbled upon it here. It definitely will not be shown anywhere nearby either. Why? Because I live in a hick town that has no interest in anything outside of mainstream media. 

I understand the concern about a potential loss of revenue, but I assure you that you would have never gotten any money from me regardless of whether or not these torrents existed. Why? I have no money. 

Why should you want me to see your movie? Because I do have a lot of friends with money in places that will likely show your movie. I also have friends that will buy your movie when it comes out because I let them know about it. 

Contrary to what it seems you think, the VAST MAJORITY of people do not even know what a torrent is; much less know how to get and use them. I know of only 2 friends that have download them, ever. It is not a common thing (or maybe I am just oblivious).

As an artist, this is a way to share your creation with those that would not otherwise see it. As a businessman, this is free promotion. As an indie film maker you need attention more than you need my couple bucks (which you would never have gotten). You need this film to land you your next project with big pocketed producers so that you do not need to come put your money in your future works. 

You should be championing this site and what it can do to help you become a well known director in the film world. The money will come if you can make movies that people enjoy. The more people that see it, the better the chances are that you will create a fan base. If you can create a fan base, the world is your oyster my man.

6. Shamelessly solicit funding for your next film
7. Be stunned at the generous response of TeAM PiRATE
8. Let the creative juices flow ...

------------------------------------------------------------

Having mellowed somewhat from his Halcyon Days molesting hitchers, Rudi Hobo [for it is He!] now seeks nothing more in life than a tranquil retirement and the dream of blowing some venture capital, as he ambles into a typical township in the heart of decaying imperialist 'Murika. But that was before a series of graphic interludes conspired to entwine his destiny with that of Abbey [anagram of Buffy], a barely legal pre-school teacher recently fired in the government cuts. Their joint struggle becomes more than the sum of its parts as a rough-and-ready reckoning begins.

TL;DR Executive Summary

plot ........ - 10/10 - powerful, highly original
writing ..... - 10/10 - brilliant, cult classic material every second line
acting ...... -  9/10 - consistent quality, extras need an energy snack before shoots 
sound ....... -  5/10 - shotgun mikes are damp, begs to be remastered, pls hire a boom-pole next time
lighting .... -  8/10 - great, fake colour so heavy it suspends disbelief solo
effects ..... - 10/10 - top-notch and CGI-free
score ....... -  9/10 - fine-tuned and on-the-money
--------------------------------------------------------------------
overall ..... -  87%
recommend ... A movie with 'Instant Classic' stamped on each frame; 
............. so snag it, kick back and inhale one hell of a ride; 
............. then, if you can, shuffle some equitable JewGold to

There's truly something for everyone in this delicious romping flick - film buffs will thrill to finally learn what 'The Abbyss' director James Cameron *wanted* Bud to say to that drowned actress who represents his frigid wife - there's lashings of retro style and gameshows to placate the Pig Brother generation - and abundant imagery to clast the iconos of Christianic upnailment fetishists [Jesus wept at one juncture] - with many's a bone tossed to S+M aficionados, who will scream along the hormonal roller-coaster as they cream their jocks over and again - for techno-nerds, heart-stomping confrontations with the coolest Bad-Droids since Vader died - one-liners Clint would kill for - even PaedoBear and Vegans get their kicks - all in, it's a welcome blast of searing fresh air which blows the stench of Hollywood's propaganda-padded 'BlockBustards' to sub-atomic particles.

You are talentless hacks who sit around posting on piratebay rather than doing something real with your life. The director worked hard to put this movie out and you can at least show some respect, whether you liked it or not. It's easy to think that if you made a movie you'd want to give it out for free, but the reality is that not all of us live in our parents basement and work at the fast food joint around the corner. Most of you clearly don't live in the real world, where we have to work to sustain ourselves. You can't go to an investor for a future movie and say hey ""Well it got pirated a whole bunch so you should fund my next movie."" 
I pirate some movies and TV too, but I don't get all high and mighty about it. I know I'm stealing and I don't pretend I'm F*ing Robin Hood or something. So do all of us a favour, shut the hell up, pirate the movie and maybe consider doing something more useful then berating the director."

Firstly, I just want to say thank you for coming to this thread and having this discussion.

Secondly, I want to tell you my experience with this movie. I first heard of your film through this website and thought it sounded like a good movie. I was going to download it because it is not playing anywhere near me and I did not want to wait for it to come out on DVD. When I went through the comments and saw your remarks, I went and looked for an alternative, legal way of viewing your film. I'll always try to support indie filmmakers. iTunes had it available as a rental for ten dollars, so I thought I'd show my support by getting it there. 

However, after waiting patiently for the movie to download I went to plug my laptop into our living room projector. I rarely watch movies alone and was looking forward to watching this film with my roommates. After pressing play in iTunes, a message came up claiming we could not watch the film as long as it was hooked up to our projector due to ""digital property licensing"". I was not about to make my roommates watch a movie off of my laptop, so I headed back here and downloaded the torrent. We had no problem watching the movie on our big screen after that.

This is a perfect example of why people pirate. I know you have no control over iTunes licensing rules, but if the industry does not ease up with these restrictions, they won't be able to keep up with the digital age. 

Regardless, I didn't mind giving up ten dollars for an Indie filmmaker and felt this movie was well worth the money, but I wish there was a better way to go about it, so the people trying to do the ""right"" thing are not being punished."

There simply isn't anything you can show the public nowadays that will shock them. People can look at the most gruesome real footage as if they're watching Ren and Stimpy."
,bushwacker01,2011-04-12T05:21Z,this movie fuckin sucked!!!! 
,WeedPirate,2011-04-12T06:53Z,"i don't care what anybody says.. i love this movie, rutger hauer is the shit.. 
and i agree with most of the comments that i would never have seen this if it wasn't online, but since i've seen it, and know that it kicks ass, i might be more inclined to buy it on dvd.. the film industry makes too much money from shitty movies, suckering ppl into seeing them"
,buttslaya117,2011-04-12T08:11Z,"This movie is fucking garbage. Seriously. Terrible story, terrible characters, terrible dialogue. Don't let the premise fool you. A hobo with a shotgun killing bad guys sounds awesome, but it's like those shitty straight-to-dvd ""horror"" movies (aka violence porn).

It feels more like a movie about Raiders from Fallout 3 made by a 13 year-old."
,fox013,2011-04-12T21:16Z,fuck you rutger                                                 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a imao si tako dobre filmove.treba imati muda da se snimi ovakvo njesra
,rozzdog,2011-04-14T19:59Z,"Mr Eisner, if you really are a penniless indy artist- surely it must fill you with some sense of solace that your 'much unknown' movie has been in the top 100 downloaded list for the past couple of weeks.. or is it all about the money... c'mon- people love your shit man!"
,penisfuck,2011-04-18T05:15Z,Perfect movie for masturbation. I just came.
,bohunk9000,2011-04-19T10:42Z,"I watched this movie in theaters... It was awesome! Went with around ten people and drank, smoked, and were rowdy the whole time. Definitely an experience for the senses."
,stanDePain,2011-04-19T13:22Z,"@jason
If you can afford to give up your pay cheque to make a movie about an angry tramp armed with a 12 bore shotgun who goes around using it on people who piss him off, then you certainly can't be short of a few quid or dollars. Bet you never go without food or fuel etc etc. So stop complaining and/or pulling publicity stunts in a sick effort to extract every single penny you can out of your endeavour. Fair play to anyone who does something creative in order to try to entertain the masses, but let's face it, Hollywood is as greedy as the bankster wanksters and sees every download on sites like this as dollars lost cos they can't think beyond a dollar bill and want to live it up in luxurious filth while the rest of us work our bollock's off for basic subsistence. You ain't skint, you're getting more viewers and publicity for your film than you would have otherwise if it wasn't on here, so be grateful for it, and be grateful for the life you have."
,WasclyWabbit,2011-04-24T05:59Z,"I cant believe I'm actually downloading this.  I have no interest to see it what so ever, I just have to see what all the fuss is about..  Sadly, I will most likely be even more dissapointed than I think I will.  Who knows, since my expectations are so low, maybe it will actually be good!"
,WasclyWabbit,2011-04-25T07:31Z,"Wow, fucking garbage.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  To call yourself a 'filmmaker'?"

,R2d6.51,2011-06-23T20:29Z,"Why do Hominids have to be so judgmental about what others choose to watch for entertainment. As if it really matters in the larger scheme of things that affect our lives.
Gee whiz man grow up a bit. If people spent more time on showing love towards one another, do you think it's possible we can move beyond the evolutionay scale to become more civilized than killing each other off & destroying the house we loive in.
If an asteroid hit tomorrow to destroy our species, it couldn't be too soon because God forbid based on some of the  comments here we move on to colonize other solar systems where there might be other life.

 Thats a fate worse than death for any other worlds to have to be subjected to such trailer trash as exists on this planet."

,holytaco556,2011-07-14T00:38Z,Great Upload :)
,thechameleon86,2011-07-15T00:18Z,I actually would have bought this movie if I was able to buy it online and immediately download it. It looks like the only way to get the movie is to buy or rent the physical DVD. Get with the 21 century and maybe less people would be pirating. 
,BloodFiend,2011-08-07T06:58Z,"Haha, the comments on here are sure to be more entertainment than the movie itself. I'm in the 'would never see this otherwise' camp, so if I do actually like it, I'll be sure to recommend it , and who knows, maybe even buy the dvd. There there, Jason, it's going to be okay ;)"
,BloodFiend,2011-08-07T19:27Z,"Ok, so I was wrong. This movie is entertaining, wildly so, in fact. I think it's actually my new favorite movie of all time. Not only will I add this to my collection, I'll be getting my brother a copy for christmas, if he doesn't already have it."

I got the dvd after watching this. There is nothing wrong with it at all. When I compared it to the DVD :) Awesome weird movie hehe."
,winston000smith,2011-08-13T18:55Z,"This is an incredible film and my fave film of the year so far.

To, the director, Jason Eisner, if that is really you - THANKYOU. I think you are one of the few people who actually understands what I want from a movie. Needless to say, I immediately bought the DVD because I loved the film that much and really hope for more of the same in the future.

This movie is like a love letter to a generation of horror fanatics who are no longer catered for by the mainstream. You either don't get this or f**king LOVE it - there's no middle ground.

To anyone who liked this and wants to see similar awesomeness I heartily recommend:

Street Trash,
Tokyo Gore Police,
Ichi the Killer,
Brain Damage,
Basket Case,
Braindead.

...These films don't feature hobos but they have a similar vibe.

A & V are great but not as good as the retail dvd/blu ray."
,SoFaKiNg42,2011-08-23T08:44Z,"Just finished ""watching"" this movie. The plot was so bone dry I nearly fell asleep. The only thing this movie has going for it is all the blood and guts and even that is meh because you only see it for like .2 seconds. I could go on about other things (acting, characters, plot et cetera) but it's really not worth it.

I thought, well it's Rutger Hauer and the trailer seems funny... the 40 mins I watched... what a waste of time, I couldn't stand it anymore, it is NOTHING, so miserable, so poor, so... stupid. I WANT MY TIME BACK!!! Mister director, don't worry:  your piece of shit film isn't going to loose money here, on the contrary, you should be happy that people actually saw the ""movie"". . . (well, if you like gore without-minimum-argument-or-anything cinematographic-movies, may be it s OK)"
,ChaseFace,2012-02-05T03:04Z,"f that, cancel the oscars cause hobo with a shotgun is going to win every award including best foreign film, best score and best supporting actor (the hobo's shotgun.) do you really think a movie with a title like this is going to be ""good"" as in hollywood assembly line pandering b.s? no, it's a terrible film. terribly awesome."
,Dr_Maxwell,2012-04-06T02:32Z,"If people wanted to actively spread the word about this great movie then please link the Apple trailers to their Twitter and Facebook accounts. It will really help virally spread the word more so than on here.

I love Rutger Hauer and can't wait to watch this movie. Will it be coming to cinema in Australia? I really hope so because Aussies would love this type of flick.

Cheers"
,Dr_Maxwell,2012-04-06T03:29Z,"So 35 minutes in and being a big Rutger Hauer fan I turned the movie off. I've seen Machete and loved it, that movie was truly entertaining grind house. However, this piece of shit deserves to be pirated to the point where the director makes no money off it at all. Spread the word so that people avoid this at all costs.

If you wanted to make the worst B grade movie ever along the likes of a steven seagal movie of late then you have succeeded.

The only decent piece of cinematography in this film is the opening scene on the train throwing back to a 70's style movie. The rest looks like it's been shot on a fucking handy cam and sure that might be a popular point of view perspective you were going for but the acting, especially in the first few minutes is so fucking horrible, so utterly over done that your financiers should have pulled the fucking plug on this shit fest before it even had a work print.

I feel sorry for Rutger Hauer having to take on roles like this, he is a much higher caliber actor and this could have been such a better movie with the right supporting actors, decent script and a more experienced director.

I'm going to go and watch Machete again and try to forget I even saw this excrement.
