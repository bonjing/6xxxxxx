,VaticanCity,2011-04-04T00:10Z,If anyone would prefer the evolution installer which no doubt will be the same as the rip I'll upload at a later time.But mickfinny's rip works so your all good to go.Regards.Power to the people.
,suitretas,2011-04-04T00:25Z,"thanks for another great upload VaticanCity

if you could upload the instaler of wilco later, i would really appreciate it... but only if you can, whenever you can mate

cheers"
,VaticanCity,2011-04-04T01:09Z,will do suitretas but lets let mickfinny's take hold for a while.PS I really think the airbus sucks though.Who wants to fly or land for that matter with a 2D Panel.But that's just me.I'll never spend a buck on that company.I believe thier was just 1 individual working on this project.Thiers your first problem.@nd they kept the overland looking VC.But granted the Frame does look good and it is now more Frame friendly.
,suitretas,2011-04-04T01:48Z,"i understand and agree with you in some aspects
but i have these a330 from posky, and can only fly with 2d, cause i couldn't merge any good vc so far... so this update, brings something new and a help with the hud lol"
,A380-800,2011-04-04T02:35Z,"Airbus evolution  is crap..

Thanks for this upload.."
,olufsen01,2011-04-04T14:30Z,"The airbus evolution is a ok, addon to have, it works fine, but its not ok to spend money on it, cause it is realesed here. But i request evolution Vol2."
,suitretas,2011-04-04T15:01Z,"that's it olufsen01

until someone makes a better one than wilco (except the exterior models in some aspects) it's a must have for all airbus lovers... but trust me, READ THE MANUAL THOROUGHLY, and it's a lot of fun when you get the hand of it

But i love the vol2 a lot, it's less buggier than vol1.

i happen to have the aerosoft fsx lisbonx 1.10, and i would like to upload it here if there is none yet. But i have to learn how to do it first lol"

They'll get the Job Done for us.

Following the March 2010 release of the highly acclaimed Concorde-X, we are very pleased to announce our next project will be the A320 commercial jet airliner.  The A320, currently under development, will be the first release of FSLabsâ€™ â€œA3xx Master Seriesâ€ line of products for Microsoft Flight Simulator X.

The FSLabs A320 will include an entirely custom animated external model, a complete 2D panel set and a fully immersive 3D virtual cockpit, allowing the flight simulator pilot an in-depth experience of this very popular aircraft.

Additional planned features for the FSLabs A320 include a robust Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS) with proper SID/STAR tracking; lateral and vertical flight management which follows the ARINC 424-19 specification in full detail; the entire range of aircraft systems; and the complete custom Fly-By-Wire implementation featured in the actual aircraft.  The FSLabs A320 will be the pinnacle of simulation fidelity in add-on aircraft for Microsoft FSX and will reach a broad market ranging from the beginner in glass cockpit airliners to the simulation expert who wishes to enjoy a virtual environment that is unparalleled in the desktop simulation world.

We will be posting more information as development progresses, in our FSLabs forums, so watch that space!"

,istrahd,2011-04-23T06:14Z,"VaticanCity, Thank You for all of your contributions to the FSX community!  I wish I knew how to hack/crack or otherwise create these myself!

Off Subject, I have a Personal Rant to go off on for a moment.

joseph5o5 How about creating just ONE freaking torrent before you spam every FSX thread out there? I checked your profile as of right now, you have NEVER ULed a Torrent to TPB.

You are probably one of those scumbag leechers who remove the files from your torrent program as soon as they finish downloading or cap its upload speed at 1KB/s.  Its people like you that are ruining Open Trackers.  I seed EVERYTHING I leech for a MINIMUM 0f 500% on my seedbox at 100Mbps then move it to my home seedbox and seed it forever at 50KBps, I've got 4 Drives full of about 7.6 TB of seeds from music, games, apps, movies and more.  

When I finish leeching every FSX Pack I can find from here and some Private Trackers, I am going to make a Mega Pack with everything in it... and it wont be a RAR, it will be individual folders so people can pick & choose what they want from one Torrent.  Over time as new things get released I will add extra packs.

WTF do you do for the community besides spam other peoples torrents with crap you want and slow down the swarms, yet provide nothing in return?  I wish I knew your IP so I could ban it from my seedboxes! Scumbag!"

,istrahd,2011-04-23T06:19Z,"Sorry for double post of my rant, my bandwidth is at about 99.5% going to seeding/leaching and I clicked it an extra time.  Worth saying twice to the sorry weasel, though."
,Gelith,2011-09-10T18:44Z,"While others request and request, I'm going to use my time to thank you for using yours to upload this Vatican! This is not my first download from you, so i want to thank you with this post!"
