,wakabala,2011-04-11T08:59Z,"Don't bother with this shitty torrent. all the songs are a couple hours long, no album art in the torrent, etc.

the dude needs to learn to torrent."
,wakabala,2011-04-11T09:04Z,"Here's a torrent for this album that ACTUALLY works and doesn't have 3 hour long songs. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6306666/Hollywood_Undead_-_American_Tragedy_%282011%29_%5Bmp3_320%5D

Just makin sure people don't waste their time with this one."
,n00bOfTheTorrents,2011-04-11T14:20Z,There's nothing wrong with this. I don't have a skull so fanboys of people with skulls have to troll me or something?
,mrk252,2011-04-11T14:58Z,"The songs are 20 minute long, but that doesnt matter, once it finishes it goes to the next song anyways (atleast on WMP 10). If you're really bothered use a program like mpTrim to make it back to normal. It's not like you're going to listen to 20 minutes of pause xD.

good torrent tho, thanks a lot"
