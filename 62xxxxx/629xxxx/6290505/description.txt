Just uploaded for a friend but if you want to download feel free... Instructions below.

Call of Duty 4 online. Download the RAR file, extract it, open up iW3mp and go to options>multiplayer options and then open up the keygen and just get any random key, copy it, it will say it is invalid but that doesn't matter. Browse through the options and find where it says BunkBuster Yes or No. Make sure it is on yes. Then find in the options the place where it says console enable or disabled make sure its enabled. 

Then go to www.gametracker.com for cracked servers, click servers, then on the playing drop down menu click call of duty 4 also on matching type "cracked" search for servers then copy and paste the server ip. Go to Call of Duty and click the key on the left of 1 and type "/connect (iphere)" (without brackets and quotation marks)
