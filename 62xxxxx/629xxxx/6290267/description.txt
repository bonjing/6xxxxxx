First, there are energy centers within your body. Our strongest is the sexual, the mental and the heart energy. We usually tend to neglect the heart energy because the mental and sexual energies are so strong. From these energies we get jealous, think too much, get angry and so on. So the idea is letting go of your thoughts instead of dwelling on them. that makes you lose more of your stronger emotions because thoughts always almost precede emotions. 
The less you think and the less you think of past and future the more you live in the present. You can even disassociate yourself from present feelings and thoughts.
Then focus on your heart when you are relaxed a bit and free from thoughts. Your heart will guide you. Whenever you want to be truly happy you must be happy from the heart. The heart tells you all you need to do. Some people confuse emotions with the heart. You cannot want someone or something from the heart. This is an illusion. You want it from your sexual energy and your mental energy. Your heart energy does not need anything or anyone to be at peace.
So when listening to your heart you will listen to it without thought without emotion and it will tell you your direction. It takes some time to get used to it and to sensitize yourself to your heart energy if you have been neglecting it. And again, every time you feel that something or someone is bothering you just practice â€œlet it goâ€ or â€œlet that thought goâ€. you will see that you will become more happy the less you focus on your thoughts and emotions. Let them be. That doesn't mean suppress them this just means don't identify with them and don't focus on them.
