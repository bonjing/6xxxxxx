NME - 5 February 2011-P2P.pdf

The New Musical Express (better known as the NME) is a popular music
magazine in the United Kingdom, published weekly since March 1952. It
was the first British paper to include a singles chart, in the 14
November 1952 edition. In the 1970s it became the best-selling British
music magazine. During the period 1972 to 1976 it was particularly
associated with gonzo journalism, then became closely associated with
punk rock through the writing of Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill..
