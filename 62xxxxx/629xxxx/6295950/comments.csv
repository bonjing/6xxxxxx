,freespirit1love,2011-04-18T08:09Z,"Thank you so much thethingy :)  I am kind of a novice and I recently used one of your links to access Office 2010.  It took me FOREVER to figure out how to Install it (and I meant it when I said I'm a novice...maybe more of a tadpole...)  But, I cannot seem to activate it.  It is stuck in Read-only.  So, I'm kinda screwed since I need Excel for my job tomorrow evening.  Any suggestions for me besides find a new job?  Lol!"
