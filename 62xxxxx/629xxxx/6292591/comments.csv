,ZenRhino,2011-04-04T05:25Z,"Two things about this:

Those songs are what's called the ""score"" of the movie... and this what Wikipedia lists as those songs:

Tyler Bates (who composed all of Snyder's previous live-action films) and Marius de Vries (who composed the score for the film Moulin Rouge!) wrote the score for Sucker Punch. The official trailers contain samples from the songs ""Prologue"" by Immediate Music, ""Crablouse"" by Lords of Acid, ""When the Levee Breaks"" by Led Zeppelin, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" by The Beatles, ""And Your World Will Burn"" by Cliff Lin, and ""Panic Switch"" by the Silversun Pickups.
The list has 6 songs, this is missing the ""Tommorrow Never Knows"" by The Beatles.

2. This torrent doesn't download... can you re-up the torrent... and possibly include the missing song so we can have a complete score of this awesome movie?"
,Hellboy86,2011-04-04T11:17Z,"The torrent wasn't downloading because i wasn't online.
I'm online now, and i've already shared to two other people to 100%. There should be plenty of seeds soon.

@ ZenRhino:
No, i didn't hear the Beatles song in none of the trailers.
Furthermore, i don't care about that song, since the soundtrack already includes an awesome version by Carla Azar and Alison Mosshart."
