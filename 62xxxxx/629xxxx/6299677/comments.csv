Yeah, there was alot of noise in the rip, hardly any of the first episode was clear. You think you can make a rip that is better than bluray? Keep dreaming my friend! Thanks anyway."
,fillinthisspace,2012-06-03T16:18Z,"I'll confess based solely on the screenshot comparison in the description I'm giving this torrent a miss. I don't know what MAFIAA's definition of ""better than bluray"" might be but the encoded version looks worse to me. I don't think the picture looks any crisper but the noise has certainly been increased.

Whatever ""FASM"" does, or whatever it's supposed to do, judging from the screenshot comparison I'd say you're better of encoding without it."
