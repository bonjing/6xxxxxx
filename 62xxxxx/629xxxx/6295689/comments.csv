As for hoping another network will pick it up, unfortunately a 3rd series is off the cards, but theres talk about direct to dvd movie(s) to finish the story off."

,wafflerevolution,2011-04-06T00:29Z,"this is what pcsinfo really meant to say -

""I don't like character development and I don't have emotions other than hate and anger, I want pointless splosions and guns. when I'm not watching sci fi shows, I watch reality shows and Michal Bay movies."""

,isis5,2011-04-13T06:37Z,"@wafflerevolution

THANK YOU! You said what I've been thinking the whole time. After watching the third episode I wondered how anything with this much character development could possibly survive with the ""bang-whoosh-splorch"" quality of previous Stargate franchise incarnations."
,jbjc72,2011-04-14T06:53Z,"Um... by character development you mean ""Soap Opera"", right?  Of the first season, perhaps 1/3 of the content was worthwhile, the rest was Beverly Hills 90210 meets House.  

The second season, by contrast, was pretty good.  It's too bad they completely blew it with all the soap-stuff in Season 1, combined with ""formerly SciFi"" putting ""Wrestling"" on in its rightful Friday slot."
,pimpmobile,2011-04-19T10:27Z,"This show is nothing, but a soap opera for chicks and guy's who cry and talk about something called feelings!  Bring back sG1 or atlantis this is crap!"
