I was wondering if you had the software to encode this hd source to h.264 to improve the video quality over that of reg avi and also to keep the audio in it's 5.1 channel ac3 format instead of 2 channel mp3? I realize that the file would be larger but the results would be closer to HD quality. Thx "
