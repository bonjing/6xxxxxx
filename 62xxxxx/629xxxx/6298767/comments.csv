Each year's torrent is getting bigger.  My estimate puts the whole collection as being about 100gb.  Are you sure about that 80gb number tavery80?"
,tavery80,2011-04-06T22:46Z,"Playboy, in terms of actual number of pages, maxed out in the early 70's, with some Dec. and Jan. issues topping 400 pages.  By the early 80's, with ever increasing competition offering far harder content and the advent of VCRs and adult tapes, the average page count was back down to the late-60's era non-holiday/anniversary issue.

50s - 3.97GB (including the Bettie Page pdf)
60s - 16.3GB
70s - 21.5GB
80s - 18.3GB
90s - 14.5GB
00s - 13.3GB"

PS: 70's PBs are massive. These burst at the staples. The 25th Anniversary Edition is HUGE."
,chuckufarley,2011-04-06T23:50Z,"Thanks for the info tavery80.  I did not know that about the page counts.

Btw, am I correct that the Bettie Page pdf contains content that is duplicated from other years/issues, or is it unique?

@LesbianCloud69: tavery80 is the only seeder and he just started uploading this torrent today.  By day's end this will be nice and healthy.  Be patient.  You won't be left in the lurch."
,tavery80,2011-04-07T01:43Z,"The Bettie Page specific pdf is merely a collection of previously published Playboy articles in one convenient pdf file.

And indeed, the largest issue of Playboy published in the US was the 25th Anniversary issue, Jan. of '79, with 444 pages, followed by the Dec. '79 issue (with Raquel Welch on the cover) with 420."
