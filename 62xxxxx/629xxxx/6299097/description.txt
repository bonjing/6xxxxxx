The first expansion pack to Command & Conquer 3, Kane's Wrath introduces two 
sub-factions for each of the three rival forces, a new story-driven campaign, 
and an additional game mode. A 20-year storyline fleshes out the events leading 
up to Command & Conquer 3 and then continues the narrative far into the future. 
As in the original game, full-motion video cut-scenes help bring the story to 
life. Players will be able to lead their favorite faction in the all-new Global 
Domination mode, which involves conquering an entire planet in a system similar 
to the board game Risk. Contested territory between factions is resolved through 
tactical, real-time battles. New units include cyborgs for the Brotherhood of 
Nod and hover technology for the Global Defense Initiative, with over 24 new 
maps available for multiplayer and skirmish battles.
