PLOT

Superman finds a foe who may be too powerful even for him to defeat in the murderous Black Adam. However, Black Adam's real target is the World's Mightiest Mortalâ€“Captain Marvel. He returns to Earth following his 5,000 years of exile to wreak havoc on Earth only to end up fighting Superman and Captain Marvel. After a long battle, he is defeated by Captain Marvel but spared his life. When Tawky Tawny arrives, Black Adam identifies him as Shazam's lackey. To evade being banished farther from Earth, Black Adam quotes "Shazam" and turns into a withered old man who turns to dust.
