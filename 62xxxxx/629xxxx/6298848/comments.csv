,OG_1337,2011-05-13T02:57Z,If this is what passes off as music these days then i might actually consider suicide.
,Sn0okk,2011-05-29T18:35Z,"@bjs001 I clicked on it because it said ''this is what i call music'' so ofourse i was expecting led zeppelin, guns n roses, iron maiden ect... but i get this jessie j and justin bieber stuff... so i warn people and say that this is crap, you shouldnt download this, listen to this kinda music is worse than a virus"
,VillePe,2011-05-30T16:02Z,"Hi, good torrent except for some songs that is censored"

[V],Horrorspoke,2011-06-06T16:52Z,"@prosephine

I think 38 is the American version, but this is the UK release, In the UK we are on Now 78 lol."
,spectre80,2011-06-10T00:08Z,how have we come to this. i must have gotten old or something but this is shit compared to good old days of 90's.  now thanks for the uploader this is not insult towards him in any way.

,AidyD,2011-06-29T01:15Z,"Downloading on the off-chance there might be one gem in the pile of modern pop toss fused with soul-less and tame rap n rnb, alongside a sprinkling of cheesy homosexually fuelled euro-dance tunes.

Gotta be one good song in there somewhere... "
,paulderby,2011-07-05T23:19Z,"sorry this is fake, it is not taken off an actual copy, the version of Taio Cruz feat. Travie McCoy - Higher.  its the wrong one, its Kylie not Travie McCoy"
,Rodan.H,2011-07-07T15:06Z,"""Now Thats What I Call Music 78"" When I saw the title I was going to think that there was going to be some Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Guns N' Roses, Nirvana etc. But I saw ""Rihanna"" and  my heart was broken. 

I'm a ""kid"" myself (16) but what I don't understand is why my classmates adore such shitty artists calling them talented while they don't write their own music, don't use their own voice, photoshop every picture of themselves. They don't even shop their clothes ffs, and they're still talented? Oh my oh my. 

I know people don't have the same taste, but why would you listen to music if there is nothing to it? This isn't music IMO. Most of the people don't even get the lyrics. When Trey Songz say ""Puor some champagne in yo' mouth"" do you really think he means champagne or sperm? And he's a gentleman? Or that people still worshiping Chris Brown after he beat up Rihanna, WTF?! When was it okay to beat up a girl, she literally had bruises all over her face. I guess if you're a celeberity and kill people it's still okay. 

Have a nice day."
,Zezo45,2011-07-09T18:13Z,"@ Rodan.H
Because liking a song is not a good enough reason to listen to it."
,ShizzleMuffin,2011-07-21T19:04Z,"@ Rodan.H
i agree with everything u typed"
,sonicbum,2011-07-29T17:29Z,"At Rodan

That bitch was trippin, but she back on track now!!!  she was asking for it...."
,a1c2x3,2011-07-30T12:15Z,"Rodan H.
I love you!"
,deaconmeth,2011-08-02T16:05Z,"The title's wrong. It should read

THATS
not what I call music"
,Krete478,2011-08-04T05:25Z,"good torrent...
not my type of music though"
,nziced,2011-08-06T17:09Z,"And yet your all writing comments about this Album you don't like or want to download. So why the fuck are you even on this torrent in the first place? Hypocritical bastards.

Go drown in your own sorrow and stop posting shit.

Good bitrate, thanks for the upload."
,hertzog320,2011-08-07T01:06Z,i agree with rodan shitty music was expecting some reggae or classics
,casinoguy666,2011-08-08T20:39Z,when are you getting NTWICM 79 ?
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-08-12T10:31Z,"Now 79 I have uploaded here in 320kbps quality,

,pssyluvr,2011-08-20T21:14Z,what a bunch of crap!
,bobyllib,2011-08-27T07:40Z,"No, that's what I Call Crap"
,Raapzaad,2011-09-11T17:47Z,"@ Rodan.H I was searching for a comment like yours! Thanks.

Guys: This is no music. Really it's not.

It has no message, no creativity and a big lack of talent. All the voices have been edited. All the songs are alike. It's lame."
,owenpatrizio,2011-09-15T18:04Z,"Why are all you guys wetting yourselves over this album and the downloader? I'm downloading this for a 9 year old girl who likes pop music, I'm not a fan and never have been a fan of pop but why piss and moan instead of just avoiding this dowload? Get a life guys."
,Xx7Wilson8xX,2011-09-22T00:03Z,"@Rodan.H Well, I see your point, But ever heard of dubstep? Completely/mostly computer generated genre. You think everyone listening to it should just stop, all because there's no ""talent"" involved? It doesn't take talent to make music these days, all it takes is a hot girl with a geeky computer guy to spice things up. But, that's what most of us like! If there's no geeky computer guide, there'd be little or no talent still around these days haha, Just saying."
,topsturner,2011-09-22T11:13Z,"ARSE!  Why are so many seeding this - there's radio tracks on here?!? Fine as a pre-release but uploader should SAY THIS.  The CD rip has hardly any seeders, weird."
,MistryWho,2011-09-23T03:09Z,"Who fucking cares if its not 'music'? I dont give two shits if somethings autotuned, as long as i like what im hearing, theres nothing wrong with being fake!"
,SamDot,2011-09-30T19:55Z,"To sing of what is that is not, or of what is not that is, is a lie, while to say of what is that is, and of what is not that is not, is true music."
,kingofmiami6,2011-11-13T23:07Z,Perfect
,Belgian-Ginger,2011-12-09T15:54Z,"I don't totally agree with Rodan H., there are some of the news release which aren't so bad.

But still, there are more good songs in the past than in the present (obvious no?)."
,Unlimited305,2011-12-21T23:48Z,"@Rodan.H 

Music is subjective. 
To each his own."
