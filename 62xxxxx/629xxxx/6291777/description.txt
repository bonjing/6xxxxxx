Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry, two of the most wanted outlaws in the history of the West, are popular \"with everyone except the railroads and the banks\", since \"in all the trains and banks they robbed, they never shot anyone\". They are offered an amnesty on condition that they stay out of trouble for a year and that they don\'t tell anyone about it. With a view to keeping their noses clean they adopt the identities of Smith and Jones and use all of their ingenuity keeping out of the way of the law.
