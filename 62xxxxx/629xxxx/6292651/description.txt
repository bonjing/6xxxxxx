   You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010)
  
  Follows a pair of married couples, Alfie (Hopkins) and Helena (Jones), and 
  their daughter Sally (Watts) and husband Roy (Brolin), as their passions, 
  ambitions, and anxieties lead them into trouble and out of their minds. After 
  Alfie leaves Helena to pursue his lost youth and a free-spirited call girl 
  named Charmaine (Punch), Helena abandons rationality and surrenders her life 
  to the loopy advice of a charlatan fortune teller. Unhappy in her marriage, 
  Sally develops a crush on her handsome art gallery owner boss, Greg 
  (Banderas), while Roy, a novelist nervously awaiting the response to his 
  latest manuscript, becomes moonstruck over Dia (Pinto), a mystery woman who 
  catches his gaze through a nearby window.
