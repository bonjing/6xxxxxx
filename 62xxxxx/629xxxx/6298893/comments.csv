thepiratebay.org
to 
thepiratebay.nl
It has become fuckin impossible to find new movies with ENGLISH subs lately!
Fuck English Audio too, let only dutch language exist, or other Scandinavian ones, which are read by like 1% of the planet's population!
AND when you write BR2DVD, fuck this shit too, or consider us morons who think that there are any BR movies with no ENG subs!

Oh and if I offended anyone who uploads just NL subs, I don't give a rat's ass, because I don't download movies with just NL subs anyway!"
