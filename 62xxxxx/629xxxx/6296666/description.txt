And here is some REAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
This is the one and only way how to prepare the real Marianito preparao as it has to be on sunday morning after church:
Give about five or six ice cubes into a jar
now a litlle hint of Angostura over the ice (0,5 cl)
add some fine quality gin and Red CuraÃ§ao (1cl of each)
now add Martini Rosso (10cl)
stir it , NEVER AND IN NO WAY THINK ABOUT SHAKING HIM !!!!!!
pour it with filtering the ice into two cocktailglasses
add a piece of orange skin lightly pressed over each of the Marianitos preparaos.
Enjoy with some Olives or caracoliÃ±os. And thank the lord that you are so lucky to live in Bilbao, the center of the universe where they make the best of them. AMEN
