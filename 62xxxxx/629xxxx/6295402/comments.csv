As for audio & video quality, its spot on, very watchable.

The only thing that may annoy some people is the camera work in the film, its that wobbly poorly done live action shit, like they think its making you the veiwer feel as if you're really there, which all it does do, is make you feel sea sick and pissed off.

If they re-made this film they should not allow the people that had the idea for this type of camera work to be in on the re-make.

But i guess camera work doesnt matter when all thats intended here with this film is spreading fear to set peoples emotions and thinking in a way to get them to believe we're being attacked by UFO's, oooh im fucking scared already!, 

Just as Bill Cooper said, its all a lie, hell, even Alex Jones says its all a lie.

I sincerley hope its real though and that we do get attacked by real aliens and UFO's, cos life is fuckin boring, work 9to5, paying taxs and bills for the rest of my life??, fuck that shit, we need some fucking action! NOW!

6. Go to Audio Multi Output
7. Turn on and say OK

Confirmed working from 3.10 to 3.55
Make sure your Sound System works with the options.

All you may need is the top 3 boxes checked. If you select the two Linear PCM options that aren't grayed out, it will say; ""if your device doesn't support the frequency selected the speakers may become damaged"" - Make sure your volume is low, but audible, so you can verify that you have sound.(THIS INFORMATION CAME FROM POWERSLAVE0(I think that was his name, I take no credit for this information but can confirm that it works on JB WUTANGRZA 3.55 CFW)."
