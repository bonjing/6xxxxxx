This concept album contains some of Cooper's most outlandish work 
to date and the album storyline for was first revealed on Cooper's 
radio show Nights with Alice Cooper.

The theme of the album revolves around a cool, calm and collected 
serial killer known as Spider. 

The police are baffled by the bodies of Spider's victims, which are 
cocooned in a silk web, and are each missing a leg.
 
Spider's task is to collect eight legs in order to complete the 
construction of his own spider however, things get complicated when 
he falls in love with his eighth victim.

After two garage albums it seemed inevitable that Alice would have 
another crack at the concept album..the problem for Cooper is that 
his output has been so vastly varied over his career that one
persons poison is another's delight.

The first single 'Vengeance Is Mine' sets the tone with huge guitar 
riffs providing the ground on which Cooper can set the scene with 
his trademark scowling tone. 

This album demands many listen to fully appreciate all its wonders,
to me this is the most satisfying Alice album in years, and like any 
truly great album it makes you work to fully explore its brilliance.
 
There is a real retro feel to this album that is offset by clean and 
modern production and if you listen through head phones it brings
another dimension to the sound! 
 
He's stuck to his road band for this trip to the studio, so Kiss 
drummer Eric Singer, bassist Chuck Garric and guitarists Keri Kelli 
and Jason Hook handle the majority of the work on the album. 

And all that time spent touring has paid off they sound like a proper 
band, not just a bunch of session guys who've popped in to pay the 
bills. 

There is room for some guests, though, and Guns n' Roses / Velvet 
Revolver fella Slash lays down an excellent solo on "Vengeance Is Mine", 
one of the highlights on the album. 

In a novel twist Ozzy Osborne whips out his mouth organ for some, well, 
pedestrian harmonica work on "Wake The Dead", where he also gets a 
co-writing credit. 

It's a surprisingly heavy album, especially considering that for studio 
album number 25, Alice has brought in a new production team in the shape
of Danny Saber, formerly of Black Grape, and Greg Hampton who's been 
working on an album project teaming up ex Guns n' Roses guitarist 
Buckethead and Bootsy 
Collins. 

But any fears that this would end up a dance crossover are firmly dashed, 
despite some heavy synth work on "Catch Me If You Can".

Despite the return to the concept album, the sound is more similar to his 
Brutal Planet and Dragontown albums than it is to the seventies sounds of 
Welcome To My Nightmare or From The Inside, especially the large amounts
of riffing laid down by Keri Kelli and Jason Hook. 

The one track that totally fails is the big ballad, "Salvation", which 
just pales besides older material like "How You Gonna See Me Now". Luckily, 
there is an array of material that rocks out and will, doubtless, slot 
happily into his never-ending tour. 

"Wrapped In Silk" and "I'm Hungry", for example, are custom built for 
audience sing-a-longs. 

And last but not least things come full circle in the closing track 
"I Am The Spider/Epilogue", when an old, old friend pops in for a cameo. 

He may have turned 60 this year but there's no sign of him fading away,
as this really is a good Alice Cooper album, one that tries to tie in the 
various musical strands he's pursued over his career, and will be a delight
for anyone whose followed him on the way. 

2010 re-release / iTunes bonus tracks

re-released through various distribution channels, Along Came A Spider has 
also received the same treatment including the three iTunes-only bonus

1."Shadow Of Yourself"
2."I'll Still Be There"
3."Salvation" (Unplugged With String Section)
__________
 
1. Prologue/I Know Where You Live

Great guitar riff and seventies style lead.I believe there is even some tambourine 
in there!!! 

2. Vengeance Is Mine: This could belong on Dragontown, great melody 

3. Wake The Dead

Sixties psychedelic feel with vocals that match, good guitar riff and nice bass work. 

4. Catch Me If You Can

Pretty straight rock song, good chorus with intelligent guitar breaks. 

5. (In Touch With) Your Feminine Side

Good chorus and another seventies groove! 

6. Wrapped In Silk

Excellent bass work and great guitar interplay. 

7. Killed By Love

The ballad!!! Actually works well and is helped by nice backing vocals and a great 
Alice vocal. 

8. I am Hungry

To my ears, a definite nod to the original ACG,nice Bruce type riff. A good measured 
lead solo. 

9. The One That Got Away:Good melodies and a fine arrangement, a seventies feel again! 

10. Salvation

This sounds as though it could of sat quite happily on the Go to Hell album, nice drum 
work, mixed with inventive bass playing and a big chorus! 

11. I Am The Spider/Epilogue

A zombie feel and a deliberate plodding and down beat(what do you expect, its about a 
serial killer),with another great guitar riff!
