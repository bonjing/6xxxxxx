WE (the non-lunatics) shall never AGAIN be overwhelmed by the religious nuts of any creed.

@ ALL: To all 'nutters' save your hateful comments for your own little parts of the 'net' where you can re-inforce your world views by shouting at like minded persons.

Finally, I invite ALL those with any kind of religious/faith or similar beliefs to watch the most excellent series [Bibles Buried Secrets] a BBC production."
