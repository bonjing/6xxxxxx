,Caerius,2011-04-04T18:03Z,"Kinda confused here:

What is this exactly? Is this a remake from the the scandinavian series? With Sarah Lund and all?"

,Triplehammer,2011-04-04T22:51Z,"It is a remake of the scandanavian series.   I haven't seen the original, though I've heard a lot about it, all good.  There are bad remakes, there are good remakes, and there are great remakes, and this is a great remake.

AMC already has three of the best shows on TV: Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead.  These might even be the three best shows on TV.  They're certainly in the top 5.  The Killing joins them.  This is absolutely worth your time to watch.

I wish the people running AMC could be cloned so they could run the SyFy channel too."

,thedixie60,2011-05-25T09:17Z,"Triplehammer.. If you've never seen the original, how do you know it's a 'great remake'? 

I've seen both and the original was 10 times better, which makes it a poor remake.. 

The original is in Danish, but if any of you can read then I recommend it."
,sunny_rio,2011-05-29T12:41Z,"I'm a bit confused here... Is this episodes 1 AND 2?
The 'pilot' and The Cage, is that it?
Cheers."
