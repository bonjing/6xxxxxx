game! "
,Blackstar117,2011-05-23T23:55Z,"For some reason it doesnt save your progress, is there anyway to fix this? I think that it might be that this game saves onto the steam cloud client... anyone know how to get around this?"

,mcon1964,2011-08-10T17:25Z,"Thanks, rolexy1234567890! I could not figure
out why the game would never save. Your 
solution works perfectly!"
