I was on the Yubari jury that awarded Kota Yoshida\'s 40-minute Coming With My Brother (Onechan Ototo to Iku) the Special Jury Prize in 2008. The director was absent from the festival because he was in the hospital after being felled by a stroke - a tragedy for anyone, even more so for someone so young. This made the joy of watching his return to form and filmmaking, Yuriko\'s Aroma - his first feature film and an even better one than its predecessor - all the greater. And there is plenty of joy to be had even for the neutral viewer. When asked for to supply a blurb to help promote the Japanese release of this film, I wrote: \"The films of Kota Yoshida show us the dark beauty of human sexuality. With the erotic power of Noriko Eguchi in front of his camera, director Yoshida is emerging as the heir to Yasuzo Masumura.\" Which should contain more than enough incentives for anyone to go and check it out.
