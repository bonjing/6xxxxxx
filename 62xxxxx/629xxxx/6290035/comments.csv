and it works!

Press red button Ð¡ÐšÐÐ§ÐÐ¢Ð¬, media get downloads   its torrent-client on your comp with noCD-patch (~800 kb).

Then find where media get was placed on your comp and delete both folders. (Media Get not visible through Tweakers).

but finally It have worked with the patch for XP! And rus P loc (txt)"
,Wyattch,2011-08-29T21:51Z,Patch names max.exe (with media get icon). Replace the original .exe and play!
