,J-O-N-B-O-I,2011-04-07T08:50Z,Can anyone confirm if this is the new Thor movie coming out ? .. movie says 2009 but release date 3rd or april 2011 ....
,sammaful,2011-04-09T00:28Z,hahahhaha one of the kids from home improvement is thor rofl epic fail think ill give this one a miss 
,ninline,2011-04-10T01:23Z,It is not the new thor movie.  Check out the 3.2 rating on imdb.  Some of the reviews are worth a read for the humor.  Generally no one had anything nice to say about it.  
[V],HolyRoses,2011-04-21T15:39Z,Where?
,Nunogod,2011-04-23T00:11Z,"@ninline 3.1 actually, I'm gonna skip this one, doesn't have any good reviews at all."
,RafaSimpsons,2011-04-25T10:33Z,i have already seen this movie. It's a crap. The movie has nothing to do with the 2011 thor. The creatures are so ugly.
,oldbreadbutt,2011-04-27T07:31Z,"anyone asking if this is the new Thor movie, should first click the IMDB link, conveniently included by BOZX when they posted the torrent."
,markenzie_15,2011-04-28T12:08Z,"its Thor 2009 People! stop complaining, this is not the new Thor!!!!!!!"

Good call on reading the IMDB user reviews.. I laughed pretty hard."
,kokoda,2011-05-06T23:23Z,"User Review from IMDB for 2009 Hammer of the Gods.
They paid someone to make this movie? That is outrageous. There is nothing worth watching in this movie. The acting is horrible, the script is juvenile, the direction is spotty and the werewolves look like extras wearing big plastic masks. This is advertised as a Thor movie, but nothing in it even refers to the Thor of mythology or the Thor of comic book fame. It has all the elements of a POOR TV movie: a female lead who is not needed and just yells out the heroes name over and over, a fellow warrior who gets irate at the hero and turns to the bad side, dialog that is delivered like it was written for a daytime soap opera, costumes that look like they were stolen from an ancient opera and special effects that are gaudy. This movie is awful."
,herniator,2011-05-11T10:46Z,"Wrong title, should be ""Turd of the Gods"""

,stjernaaa,2011-05-24T01:24Z,"For those who wanna know, this is NOT the new movie about Thor.

I just watched half of this movie, and it's the worst minutes I've spent in my entire life. This movie is TERRIBLE, and the actors are maybe even worse.

This is a donkeyass movie about some ""Vikings"" getting ""stranded"" on an Island or something. The guy named ""Thor"" in the movie sees himself as low-graphic Thor in a previous life a few times.

They also fight Werewolves that looks like they've been made in the 1950s.

One of the _WORST_ movies EVER!"
,captainswingding,2011-06-16T08:28Z,where tha hell is tha like button some of these comments r off tha fuckin wall thats greater than ever shit
,FriendlyChap,2011-06-16T13:07Z,"This is not the Marvel Comics' Thor. Just a cheap made-for-TV movie, and not a very good one at that."
,LordNitro2008,2011-07-13T01:07Z,CHEAP CRAP FROM THE SCI FI CHANNEL!!! Sooo cheap lol. It took me a month to download this with a fast connection and i was so pissed off when i found out what it was. Its not a cartoon comic book movie. I thought it was. But i can tell you now that it SUCKS!!! I watched this on tv. This was the biggest wast of time iv spent downloading a movie sense 1999!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
