Go to home site and download the damn thing http://calibre-ebook.com/"

If anybody wants to convert an .epub to kindle formatted file they are much better downloading kindlegen from Amazon & forget about getting anything useful with a .pdf to anything.

However if you have a Sony eReader or a B&N Nook then Calibre serves a purpose."

Yes, it is available for free elsewhere but adding items like this (which I use to publish my own books for reading on iPads) opens up the possibility that other Mac users will find Calibre and use it.  Works nicely.  You can download eBooks in PDF and a host of other formats and easily convert them over to iPad, iPhone format and add them to your library.  If you can, please donate to the creator.  The guy has done a fantastic job for the Mac community."
