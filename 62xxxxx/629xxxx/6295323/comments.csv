,Saki33,2011-04-05T15:04Z,WARNING: You never need to download a codec to view any video. It's a scam and I strongly recommend against installing that exe. file from pilfer. I haven't downloaded the video myself to be able to comment on that. I am waiting for the bluray.
,Saki33,2011-04-06T02:02Z,My comment doesn't make sense because it was to comment on a comment that has since been removed. It was from pilfer who said that the video didn't play and you'd need to download the codec at his link. I reported it and mentioned that the moderator should remove my comment also since it wouldn't make sense once the spam had been removed. Apparently that didn't make sense to the moderator and so my comment with no context remains. Sigh. (No comment on the ability of the moderator to understand English. I'm already a minus one.)
