Superworms: Common Ground, Part 1 (2011)
As told by Sir Gregory Linham

genre: children/young adult


My name is Sir Gregory Linham and I am a Superworm.  Best of four Superworms, I\'ll have you know.  And I will be dead in a matter of days - if not hours.  If I had the chance for one last mission, I would use it to stop my brother from coming after me.  But I won\'t get that chance.  So he will come.  And it\'s the only glimmer of hope I have left.
