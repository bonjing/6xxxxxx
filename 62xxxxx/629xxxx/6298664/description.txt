This is the orchestral adaptation of the music composed for the movie Blade Runner by Vangelis. The official Vangelis version was not available until long after the release of the movie, and I suppose I've become rather accustomed to the this release, since when I finally got to hear the Vangelis album, I found I preferred the adaptation. If you are a Blade Runner fan and not hate classical music, then this will surely please you.
