=========================================================================================
firstly first - \\\'bout this torrent\\\', after long time search on the major torrent sites,
i\\\'ve no idea why on earth this collection can\\\'t be found.
I\\\'m sure that no body doesnt know who LOBO is..? are you..? :)
So, found this site (\\\'thai site) called -Tuoitrevnnet.com- and one guy did have this collection.
And thank to that guy, i downloaded it and here we are.

And i know, maybe some of you said why are @.ape\\\'s sound..?
well for me, neither FLAC or APE, they are all best Lossless Audio file, don\\\'t they..? :)
and beside these are the original uploaded files, me just try to spread it all over world.
