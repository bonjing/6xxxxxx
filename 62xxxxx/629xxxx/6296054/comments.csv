,foxelein,2011-07-24T12:34Z,"@raindr0ps : nice name btw.. :)
just search on google/torrents sites, how to get the right and suitable program for your pc..

in fact, the quality of the song will be reduce, if you convert it into mp3, and whats the point..?
play it either with media player classic, winamp or other media player and compare how beautiful it is in lossless audio format.. :)
cheer up.. thx.."
