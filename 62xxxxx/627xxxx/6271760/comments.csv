,DrDDuke,2011-04-02T18:00Z,"I don't ""put all Jews in the same rotten bag,"" and anyone who has the slightest ability to think for themselves and watched my videos knows that I'm no hatemonger. Any child can throw and epithet at someone. Racist, hatemonger, etc. is similar to calling someone a witch or a heretic in the middle ages. Words like that are meant to prejudice and elicit hate, and that's what your comments are meant to do.
So, who's the hatemonger?
The fact is that my videos have gotten over 3,000,000 views on YT on my channel, and other videos showing my speeches, appearances, debates, etc. have over 4,500 videos on the Net and over 75 million views.
All my videos on my channel get a 90 percent or higher viewer rating.

Find out why!"
