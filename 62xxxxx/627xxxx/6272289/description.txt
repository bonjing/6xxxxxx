Australian Grand Prix Qualifying.

Jake Humphrey presents qualifying action from Melbourne as the 2011 Formula One season finally gets under way. The new campaign is starting two weeks later than initially scheduled, following the FIA's decision to postpone the Bahrain Grand Prix due to civil unrest. Twelve months ago, eventual world champion Sebastian Vettel took pole position at Albert Park ahead of his Red Bull team-mate Mark Webber. Commentary comes from Martin Brundle and David Coulthard.
