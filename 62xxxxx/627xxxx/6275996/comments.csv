[V],twentyforty,2011-03-28T08:43Z,"@razorraj: Senna 2010 was requested few months ago, and I've obtained BluRay few days back - and mentioned that yesterday in my comment about related matter- subtitles.

It is documentary, and NOT knowing what in hell they speak about is - stupid. Only Italian and Portuguese subs have been made and that leads to another point:

- Senna was hero in few areas of the world, not elsewhere. When he died, I was thinking ""He got what he deserved"" remembering how many times his recklessness have almost killed other drivers.. Point being, I am not crazy about that movie, it's like movies which glorifies some other mass-delusions.
- XviD is 796 MB for 2h40 movie (I cannot do smaller than 500 MB let say) and has dual-audio and - two subs mentioned before.
- it's mixed content - original, mostly crappy footage from TV while back mixed with interviews, full of double-frames, ghosting and other crap usually (mis)done when producers do not use decent material nor pay enough some nice company for repairing the video and BluRay production. Point here is: quality is already bad. Why in hell BluRay at all?

Regarding everything above - present XviD is a good bargain indeed.
If one day English sub pops out - maybe I would reconsider it."

,hakuna_matata,2011-03-28T11:32Z,"@twentyforty 
thanks..anyways.. dude! "
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-28T11:55Z,"@hakuna_matata: ...""anyways""... ""dude"" means ""tits"", on my language, of course.
As ""mate"" comes from ""mating"" and ""Buddy"" is very frequent dog name."
,dark_defender,2011-03-28T14:57Z,"^ LOL. 
@All: On a serious note, use respectful words for 20-40."
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-28T17:34Z,"@20-40
LOL .. I havent seen the Senna movie yet but want to see so may be later and I will wait, 
and 
more importantly, I really help with the settings man.. I cant figure it out. I was trying something earlier and it worked but today they aren't working. can you email me the preset plz."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-28T18:20Z,"@hakuna_matata: Find my e-mail in one Long Header (description) and ring me there. However, BEFORE that, try, on most concise way, locate, describe and write down EXACT problem you have regarding encoding.
In general - I do not provide any help, especially if problems are of generic type or, as people say, of general type. For encoding topics exists video/encoding forums, and certainly thepiratebay is not one of them (in fact, if one even mention ""torrent"" he would be bullied on many forums, such on doom9.org)."
,monkey_brain,2011-03-28T19:29Z,"Thanks a lot for uploading Jackie Brown!! A requested for it a long ago. I thought you did not go through my request but i was wrong i guess. Thanks a bunch, dude!!"
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-29T00:28Z,"@20-40

,froglog,2011-03-29T22:06Z,Thank you
,Di11ster,2011-05-02T07:47Z,Thanks for uploading this. I think it's the best film that Tarantino has directed so far but I only have it on VHS tape so it was about time I got another copy. Thanks again.
