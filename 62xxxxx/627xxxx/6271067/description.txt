- 100th Anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire

Today marks the centennial anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, the deadliest workplace accident in New York City's history and a seminal moment for American labor. On March 25, 1911, 146 garment workers, mostly young immigrant women, died after a fire broke out at the factory. Many of them leaped to their deaths when they tried to escape and found the emergency exits locked. "I saw people throwing themselves from the window. As soon as we went down, we could not get out because the bodies were coming down" says the last survivor of the fire in a 1986 interview with Amy Goodman. Denied any collective bargaining rights, the Triangle workers were powerless to change the abysmal conditions in their factory: inadequate ventilation, lack of safety precautions and fire drills--and locked doors.

"There's a straight line that runs from the fire right through the New Deal of labor legislation reform, the welfare state, and the creation of industrial unionism-and the right to collectively bargain in that time," says labor historian Steve Fraser.

Workers across the United States, meanwhile, are facing a resurgent assault on salaries, benefits, and their right to organize-as epitomized in Wisconsin's anti-union bill.
