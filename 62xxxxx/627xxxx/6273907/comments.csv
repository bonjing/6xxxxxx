,LRanger,2011-03-31T21:53Z,Can someone confirm that this torrent works? I burned it and it didn't work. Using Firmware LT+
,hisperiandeathhorse,2011-04-01T03:52Z,"I can confirm that it did not work after burning this game, I also have LT+, Ran disc through abgx for a check-up and the error it encountered was a Layer-Break error. I checked my imgburn settings and my layer break is set correctly. ( first disc ever to fail on me) If someone can confirm that this error is what they are experiencing that would be great.

Layerbreak for this DVD was reported as 2086912 (expected 1913760)
If this is a burnt Xbox 360 backup, it probably won't boot on your console!
Always burn your backups with the correct layerbreak!
