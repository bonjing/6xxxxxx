Konami's celebrated soccer series returns to PlayStation 2 with an emphasis on 
improved control and strategy on the pitch. Revamped animations and physics are 
designed to offer more lifelike results, from acceleration and tackling to 
jostling and blocking. The presentation features over 1000 new animations in 
total, taken from more than 100 hours of motion-captured recordings of athletes. 
Other changes include improvements to defender artificial intelligence, so that 
they better hold their positions, and an enhanced passing system. A new shot and 
stamina meter lets you see each athlete's current level of fitness at a glance, 
which is important since sprinting now has a detrimental effect on player 
performance and abilities over time.
