,VaticanCity,2011-03-28T23:41Z,Install with the serial name and serial supplied.Than before exiting or starting your FSX goto you c:program files\aerosoft\launcher and delete it than set up your joystick as per the aerosoft forums.I don't have that joystick so I'm screwd till I buy a proper Heli Joystick .I use Yoke and 360 controller right now.This Heli is not meant for either.Should be similar to airbus controller that aerosoft put out I believe.
,davincighost,2011-03-29T18:32Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but should I click OK for ACS.dll in FSX? My ruder pedal are switched..."
