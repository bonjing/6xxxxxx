                        AEROSOFT ONLINE - HUEY X Version.1.10




The Bell UH-1 is without a doubt one of the best known helicopters to most people. It was imprinted in our culture by the moving images from the Vietnam War were it changed the face of warfare. And it never left as thousands are still flying in every corner of the world.
Fifty years after it first flew it is still in production and thatâ€™s something no other helicopter can claim. The characteristic sound of the two-bladed rotor can be heard over jungles and city centers. Even though it has only one engine it is very reliable and rugged. A workhorse thatâ€™s not afraid to get dirty and will fly just as happy with a few pounds more than the manual states it can carry.  Itâ€™s loved by the pilots and the crew that maintain the old airframes. Itâ€™s the Huey.
