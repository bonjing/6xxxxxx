Hello All! 

This is Rise Against's Full Discography

- The Unraveling (2001)
- Revolutions per Minute (2003)
- Siren Song of the Counter Culture (2004)
- The Sufferer & the Witness (2006)

These are all good quality songs, I play them through my Bose car stereo and they sound great! 

All songs are titled and named so there is no need to rename :)
