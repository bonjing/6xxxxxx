,mike18xx2,2011-05-18T04:08Z,...and your failures prompted you to conclude something was wrong with my torrent when thousands have downloaded it successfully without complaint...exactly why?

,hamai,2011-07-16T17:55Z,amazing torrent
,User897,2012-01-30T02:37Z,"Thanks so much for this.  I hope it has good speed and quality, and NO missing scenes.  This film needs the PROPER Blu-ray treatment with all the bells and whistles.  Until then, it looks like this will be the definitive version.

I'll report back once I have it."
,User897,2012-02-01T10:23Z,"I made a Blu-ray from this.  It reveals the limitations of the source material, but it's easily the best damn copy I've seen to date.

Thank you!"
,sadec,2012-06-01T00:48Z,"I have never seen this movie, and I'm not really picky with the quality, but I guess x264 will worth it. Thank you for this. :)"
,CJClags,2012-06-06T00:57Z,"Great upload, thanks"
,CJClags,2012-06-08T04:28Z,"This appeared to be the best quality rip on TPB, and maybe it is. Unfortunately it didn't work for me, not in mkv or mp4 on my ps3 or blueray player. Thanks anyways though ;)"
