I'm very interested to learn how to Rip Movies from .mkv files to .m4v is there any software for Windows than can do the same job as you do via Linux....Thanks always"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-26T21:44Z,"Not that I am aware of, at least not like these.  There are of course lots of different windows encoder programs.  try them?"

video w/handbrake, audio w/foobar, mux w/yamb, tag w/metax"
,henrikhoe,2011-04-02T12:27Z,"muxing is so bad with yamb though.

subtitles look like shit, anyways, its a shame windows dont got a proper encoding tool. Cause i know got about 50 movies from you hr and i3, and no subtitles. Cause i cant mux em, shame. Anyways keep up the good work"
,dp2011,2011-04-02T18:16Z,"true, i sometimes use my Xbox to playback MP4s, so i need to remux w/o the subs file. maybe -HR needs to add a note to the description field..."
