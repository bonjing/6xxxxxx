,alvis51,2011-04-19T07:58Z,"Thanks Johnny for putting this up, cant get it to work with EZ Drummer though, patch is for superior. Any chance of an EZ Drummer patch or keygen? "
,J0hnny55,2011-04-26T23:21Z,"sorry alvis, i couldnt find one for EZdrummer but if you want my opinion, i started with EZdrummer first as well and superior drummer is exactly what it claims...superior, and there are plently of superior drummer torrents on TPB. Plus, you automatically get the NY Avatar kit which is a way better basic kit then EZdrummer offers. again sorry, but thanks for downloading."
,alvis51,2011-04-29T09:44Z,Cheers mate will try superior
,12z21,2011-06-20T04:30Z,Do you guys know where I can find the EZX Jazz one?

I have the same problem, patch doesnt work."
,RocKhan,2011-07-09T04:08Z,"I found the solution, I downloaded the Ez Drummer Metal Foundry EZX before, there was included a keygen with EZ Drummer, I used it and it works."
,Chris_Hun7er,2011-07-18T22:52Z,"I have a problem with this torrent. When I use the installer, it says ""EZDrummer needs to be installed first."" and immediately skips to the Finish screen where it says the install was interrupted, so I can't install this. Can anyone help? I really want to use this."
,bubs96,2011-11-02T09:34Z,"when i run the installer it says ez drummer needs to be installed first?, and then goes to the finish setup screen, plezz help dude"
,vishnu219,2012-01-16T04:55Z,Bummer.  No Mac installer in this torrent.  Anyone know how to manually install kit files into a Mac to get it to work?
