Jean[1] "Django" Reinhardt; 23 January 1910 â€“ 16 May 1953) was a pioneering virtuoso jazz guitarist and composer.

Born into a family of Romani gypsies Reinhardt invented an entirely new style of jazz guitar technique (sometimes called 'hot' jazz guitar) that has since become a living musical tradition within French gypsy culture. With violinist StÃ©phane Grappelli, he co-founded the Quintette du Hot Club de France, described by critic Thom Jurek[2] as "one of the most original bands in the history of recorded jazz." Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become jazz standards, including "Minor Swing", "Daphne", "Belleville", "Djangology", "Swing '42" and "Nuages" (French for "Clouds").
