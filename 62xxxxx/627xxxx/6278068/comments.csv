,steve30x,2011-03-28T22:09Z,So what was your point then Shiftnoob? Just because I said Shift 2 wont be as good as GT5 I didnt mean because GT5 has more cars. I just think GT5 is a better game.
,steve30x,2011-03-28T22:18Z,Thanks again AITB for this. This is indeed the real thing (No crack included) I have the game installing now (I will buy it in a few weeks). Cancel the activation popup when installing and the game will install.

,Krakentarg,2011-03-28T22:47Z,80+ seeders good job! :D
,steve30x,2011-03-28T22:59Z,Its totally obvious that you havent played GT5 Elturbo if you think that about GT5 because without any assists turned on in GT5 and accelerate in a corner the car will either drift or spin.

,skip741,2011-03-29T09:32Z,"1st of all Thankyou for sharing this game.I wanted to write acomment of how it plays.How can find the words to say how just plain bad the graphics And handling are? As i limp around the tracks rendered in glorious flintstones level quality in my ford focus,i am laughing at what the heck happened to the awesome quality vids i had seen previewing the game--how on earth did i end up with flinstones level graphics realism that looked like it was from a game 5 or more yrs old?grid absolutely slaughters this game as does dirt 2 and most shockingly  even the original shift game far surpases this one, they managed to make it Worse on all levels!NFS hot pursuit is Way more fun, better handling and superior in graphics both on cars and landscapes. im running it on a quadcore intel with 6 gigs ram and an 8800gt. all settings maxed,  at 1680x1050 with decent frame rates..maybe it will look better and be more fun with the hypercars unlocked and other tracks, but my 1st impressions were like :youve GOT to be Kidding me!:it just cant be This bad,im in driving hell...it didnt hold my interest for more than 20 mins.. feedback from others would be interesting"
,YogiSVK,2011-03-29T12:41Z,i have problem with this game ....game start correctly but when i play carrer all is gray ....i have all up to date.....someone elsa have the same problem???

""NFS hot pursuit is Way more fun, better handling""
Hot Pursuit is like arcade racing, speeding through tight corners at 200km/h or more.. BIG difference in handling obviously."

,doobtribe,2011-03-30T02:15Z,"Good visuals, soundtrack (or lack of) isn't the pile of shit that was the previous. So that's great but... the gameplay handling is still the most absolute piece of shit to drive/play with a keyboard. I really think they have some contract with wheel manufacturors to get some slice of the profit because the game even with the assists turned on is an unbelievable uncontrollable mess! Oversteering like hell, even when ur with the same class/car of the AI ahead of you at the same speed and same path line the car will just fking drift and skid on the slightest turn. Not worth the money sadly, better of with the older Race driver grid."
,ChiliBeef,2011-03-30T02:26Z,"@ doobtribe:
I've never had much luck using a keyboard to drive.  But, even with a Logitech gamepad controller, the handling of the cars does feel atrocious.  They handle like weighted bricks and I don't recall Shift 1 having this kind of trouble.  I also wondered if this was their way of getting people to purchase steering wheel/pedal sets. *LOL*"
,gary22uk,2011-03-30T02:50Z,"to all that have problems try this.. i had a problem where after click ing cancel installation would exit..

My solution : Mount image with Daemon tools, then open my computer explore the image and use the easetup file rather than the autorun after mounting.. i dont know why this happens but it worked for me and have installed 3 times just to check it.. "

,vincentdesrd,2011-03-30T08:27Z,"GT5 was a HUGE dissapointement for me, way way way too many useless poorly rendered cars to choose from, average graphics at best, boring Rallye mode,... etc.

How can you expect a game, that has been in developement and pushed back so many times because they wanted to add ABSOLUTELY useless features and cars, to turn out and reach all expectations that THEY(Sony and PD) created out of thin air."
