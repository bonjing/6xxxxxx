,v360961,2011-03-28T12:25Z,"It's not an AP 2.5 game .I can confirm that because games like fable 3 , black op's and halo reach won't work on my Xbox . This game on the other hand works . I think the whole AP 2.5 thing was just an experiment in which Microsoft failed .
Anyway , NO AP 2.5 . Lets just keep our fingers crossed and hope Gears of War 3 isn't AP 2.5 protected :)"
,v360961,2011-03-28T12:29Z,"@kiraburu -This game is definitely better than the first game . The graphics are stunning and car models have a lot of detail .At times the game does get a little ""toooo"" realistic , it tends to get in the way of the fun . Beside that, it's an amazing game ."
,v360961,2011-03-28T12:38Z,"Can someone link a good torrent of Battlefield Bad Company 1 for Xbox 360 , I've been searching all over the internet for a while now and have been unsuccessful :("
