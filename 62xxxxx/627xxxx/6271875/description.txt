Nearly four years after their last album, Places Like This, Architecture in Helsinki are finally back with a brand new record. The Melbourne-based electro indie outfit, which made their debut in 2003 with the  pop-infused Fingers Crossed, recently announced that they would release their long-awaited fourth studio album in April in Europe and May in the US.
Architecture in Helsinkiâ€™s new full length, entitled Moment Bends, was recorded over the past two years in the bandâ€™s own studio and according to band leader Cameron Bird it reflects AIHâ€™s obsession with pop music and their desire to get lost in an album that encapsulates all their feelings and emotions.
