  It's one of the first Polish movie that is fully devoted
to occult and parapsychology. It's pretty difficult in
reception and it's definitely one of these 
forgotten movies. Action takes place in Sopot,
where Wagner who is some kind of fortuneteller
and his sister who is a medium. They detect presence
of a few people which are guided by insanely
powerful medium. Those people meet in Sopot
(where there is famous Polish pier shown later) but
while controlled they are unaware what they did
or what are they doing in that location.
Later, an investigation carried out by detective
and his deputy that sworn his loyalty to Nazis results in
conclusion that this is repetition of a cycle in which...
The movie is accompanied by excellent music which enhances
the atmosphere of the mystery. Interestingly, casual dialogs
are without any background music. 	In addition to that we got
some historical background when Hitler started to rule in Germany
along with the party of the Nazis (NSDAP). To summarize, we receive
a very original Polish production, however it will be difficult
to examine for those who don't like movies concerning psychological
things rather that gore and action. A must see for Polish horror lovers.
