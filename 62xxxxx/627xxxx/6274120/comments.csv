,Affar2k,2011-04-17T21:28Z,"thanx goodfilmes for the upload :)

just for the records, the subtitle is hardcoded into the movie"
,austin4ever,2011-05-24T12:09Z,hmmm...I don't get what all the negative votes are for?
,valiumHD,2011-06-01T08:34Z,"WWWWHHHHYYYYYY Hardcoded subs ????
MKV container gives the opportunity to have embedded selectable subs... So why ?????"
,VelvetMirror,2011-07-01T18:54Z,"This movie has subs, audio and works fine. 

Thanks!"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-06T22:05Z,It's hardsubbed because the source is hardsubbed (as the review linked to in the description tells you)
