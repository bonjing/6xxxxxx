,zHasTEz,2011-04-12T16:19Z,"1. Run the start-windows-x86.bat(or the amd64 one)
2. Wait for the JPCSP to pop out
3. Go to File -> Load UMD and open KH BBS
4. Hit Run
5. And, well it should work...Unless your system specs is really far below. If it is, you will not even able to open the main menu..."
,zHasTEz,2011-04-13T17:07Z,"ah yes..
it was supposed to view the opening movie, but it didn't (somehow)
just skip the movie by pressing start(enter by my settings), directional down(down arrow by my settings), x button(z by my settings)"
,zHasTEz,2011-04-16T05:30Z,Have you checked the configuration? I've disabled the sound
,zHasTEz,2011-04-16T15:21Z,"Well, i think it's an unsolved bug. The guys at JPCSP Team said it can't play BBS fully, but they are still working on it. Try using the newest build, maybe they have the problem."
,BGear95,2011-04-28T18:33Z,Thanks for this torrent dude. It's awesome. Yes some problem appeared. But still an awesome torrent. =)

,zHasTEz,2011-05-05T17:08Z,"Har Har

Try searching for the latest release guys, cuz maybe the problems has solved."
,zHasTEz,2011-05-05T17:10Z,"Btw I also think that a decrypted ISO of this is hard to find and it's never hurt to share, right?"
,zHasTEz,2011-05-05T17:12Z,"@Pook_Pook
Yes, it's full english. It's the official release for North America."
,zHasTEz,2011-05-10T16:40Z,"Hey, where are the seeders????"

,zHasTEz,2011-06-30T07:59Z,"@BlOodDeviL
Have you checked your system requirements(Like can you play Black Ops or any Hi-Spec Games)?

It also can be caused a bug in the emulator. They say that some bugs existed (like characters walking out the pause menu or choppy sounds) and their trying to fix that out.

Try finding the latest build of JPCSP or tell them what are your problems and maybe they can fix it."
,neonecra,2011-07-06T06:47Z,"i would appreciate it if some people seeded, but i am getting 50kb/s so i guess it isnt all bad for 3 seeders... and if the game works i give many thanks to the uploader cus i honestly have been looking for this for ages XD... plus if i get time will try to upload it incase the seeders reduces further"
,neonecra,2011-07-06T14:59Z,"since this download is taking ages, i looked for an alternative and found this: (i recommend checking out this youtube vid as it helped me get a working version of the iso, decrypted with the emu)

i cant poast the link to the vid but just google the followin paragraph and there should be a vid with it in the description

""Play Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep on the PC!!! For those of you with the infamous ""black screen of death"" or the ""get to the menu but won't start new game"" problems, I have the solution for you! Just download the files in the following links, extract them with WinRar, and voila! You now have Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep!""

... i give thanks to the uploader"
,zHasTEz,2011-07-06T17:10Z,"@neonecra
Well, since I lost the original file AND my laptop, I can't upload the files until I find my backup disk....

Be patient until I find it :D"
