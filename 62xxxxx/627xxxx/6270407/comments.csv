""When there are zero seeds for a given torrent (and not enough peers to have a distributed copy), all the peers will get stuck with an incomplete file, since no one in the swarm has the missing pieces. When this happens, someone with a complete file (a seed) must connect to the swarm so that those missing pieces can be transferred. This is called reseeding.""

we need this to happen.. I'm stuck on 95%  and there are no seeds online..."
,saoman,2011-03-28T04:01Z,"You will be stuck at 99,9% but the ISO will be usable/mountable."
,zakdaniell,2011-03-28T06:55Z,oh really? so even if its @ 99.9% we can still mount the ISO and it will fully install? are you going to be seeding at any certain time so i can finish the download and i can seed the torrent? or should i just wait until %99.9 and then use that?
,zakdaniell,2011-03-28T06:57Z,"i am willing to seed for a long time, considering this is the only windows torrent for pro tools 9. :) but if you suggest just using the ISO at 99.9 then i will do that."
,zakdaniell,2011-03-28T07:17Z,"ok, so i just tried mounting the ISO at 99.9% but it reads it as corrupted. I'm thinking its because the iso is not fully downloaded.

saoman, is there anyway you could seed just for like 10 minutes so we can download that last 0.1% of the image?

,yesssirrr1,2011-03-28T08:00Z,"Saoman- You can't Mount an ISO that is Uncomplete.. We need that .1 Percent- Your the only one thats for windows- we neeed this, Can you Please seed This???
