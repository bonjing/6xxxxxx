,nerd1337,2011-09-22T07:50Z,Not sure why this was given a rating of 10 on video by the first commenter.  The video is 6 at best on my HD Samsung monitor.  Massive pixels and blurry at the same time.  The ripper should probably not have restricted the video to 702mb for CD.  Who uses CDs for data anymore anyway?  It could have been 1.5-2 gigs and been much better quality.
