Or you can just copy and paste the links into your address bar.  

Also, what does the ""RC"" mean in the torrent name?

Region Coded?  Release Candidate?  What is the importance of it?"
,m8cet,2011-03-26T19:35Z,The images cant be viewed. It says 'Domain Unregistered'. To view the images we need to register at some URL. Can you recheck BONE??

Read the comments above you duhhhhh!  Copy and paste the image links into your address bar, they work fine."
,JozeTolas,2011-03-29T01:11Z,This version is really amazing!!! It seams like a non edited version of the film!!! There are some parts where we can see the multi directional mic of the movie LOL.... i think the guy that carries the mic its the principal actor from the movie LOL

you fu*king idiot"
,douglas1989,2011-04-04T00:49Z,"@nittany. seems like RC means really crap. colour etc is atrocious. green washed out shades etc. and the letterboxing varies sometimes from a lot to only a little.
I'd say find a new torrent!"
,douglas1989,2011-04-04T00:58Z,oh yeah sound is awful too - constant hissing noise
