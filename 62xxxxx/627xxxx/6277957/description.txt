Here is another little gem, The Cry of the Vampire, by Trillo and Bernet, the same team that made my recent Torpedo uploads.

It is about the stunning young vampire, Ludmila, who searches for her long lost maker, by enlisting a photographer to help her take pictures of people matching his description. The photographer of course fall in love with her, without knowing her secret.
