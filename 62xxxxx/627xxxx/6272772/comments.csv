,DontPissMeOff,2011-03-27T22:46Z,Is there a crack for 64bit?
,GodboyJamal,2011-03-28T01:15Z,"Does this crack work for the 1.1 patched version of the game?  One bug in particular is seriously p*ssing me off, and I'd like to  finish the game with the console."
,thcfreak666,2011-03-28T15:44Z,Thanks this one Works and is clean
,dakotablues1,2011-03-28T17:05Z,"this torrent is identified by Avira AV as having "" TR/Crypt.XPACK gen4 "" trojan, even at low level detection! Get a nodvd crack from another source to avoid infection. Not scamming anyone, just shouldn't waste your time downloading an infected file. It's embedded in the executable, and ndoesn't show until opened to use the game."
,Banecomes,2011-03-28T17:30Z,",i can confirm dakotablues it does contain a trojan nod32 deletes it as soon as i unrar it allways use trusted uploaders never trust a piece of shit like this."
,ghbub5,2011-03-29T15:34Z,how do u install crack?
,TheJepo007,2011-03-29T22:01Z,"@ghbub5

Just extract to your install folder.

@dakotablues1 & Benecomes

It's funny how your crappy free antivirus programs find trojans in cracks. If you didn't know, almost every single crack there is is identified as a virus by those crap programs.

I, on the other hand, haven't had a single infection whatsoever."
,dakotablues1,2011-03-30T02:21Z,"I use Avira, which is a top5 rated AV program, and the game itself IS fine, I just got a nodvd fix from another link. I wasn't intending anything other than a warning to people about the trojan, and if you haven't picked up anything like that from this site, then you are suspect for having the ""crappy antivirus program"" and might want to swithc to one that detects system threats! "
,dakotablues1,2011-03-30T02:23Z,and FYI' this is the 1st trojan detection from a crack file in about 50 used with no issues
,TheJepo007,2011-03-30T22:50Z,"@dakotablues1

I'd like to know the source of your ""top 5 rated AV program"" since I haven't heard of any list stating that Avira is in the top 5 of AV programs.

I happen to use Norton, bought from a local store. I has not identified any file in this crack as a virus, even after a complete system scan."
,dakotablues1,2011-04-01T04:26Z,check out pcworld reviews
,Darkforge317,2011-04-03T04:19Z,"I found out this game forces you into updates so delete all of the contents of C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts/Crytek/Crysis 2/bin32/EAcore. After you do this there no longer will be any more forced update. When you start the game it takes a bit longer, but it still loads! Just leave the EAcore folder there empty! "
,Darkforge317,2011-04-03T04:21Z,"oops.. sorry :/ I copied something else and for some reason it pasted that.... here's what I wanted to say:  It asks me for a serial number... please help? I tried entering xxxxx, nope, I tried entering nothing, nope, tried entering a random code...nope! HELP ME PLEASE! The window named ""Product Activation"" opens up as soon as I start the game! It says ""Please enter the serial number that you received with Crysis 2.""  Help PLEASE!"

,Darkforge317,2011-04-03T04:23Z,sorry for all those comments... My internet is crap right now and I thought it didn't post the last ones! :/
,peterwan,2011-05-29T15:49Z,"i don`t understand why some guys are so
fucking paranoid about viruses, worms
and complaining about online multiplayer
games, why don`t you guys play OpenSource
or free online games and if this is not
your solution then please shutup and go
BUY the ORIGINAL game/games

This ain`t no virus and if it was
i can`t complain cos its FREE

Thanks nice upload"
