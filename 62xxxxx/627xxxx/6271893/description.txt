Hardcore Syndrome 4
TANOCD-0011 (2010)
FLAC
Happy Hardcore, Hardstyle, Makina, Gabber


This is one of the best albums I've ever heard, I encourage you to enjoy and share it with friends. Absolutely sublime, from start to finish (except track 14), a jewel-encrusted treasure of music delivered straight to your ears. Album consists of happy hardcore, hardstyle, makina, and gabber. Another awesome piece in the Hardcore Syndrome series.
