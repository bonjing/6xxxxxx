From BBC Radio 7. Written by Val McDermid; Full cast dramatisation starring Jimmy Chisholm, John Paul Hurley, Simon Donaldson, Steven Cartwright and Michael Nardone; Dramatised by Bert Coules; Directed by Lu Kemp.

Four students stumble upon the body of a dead girl, in the snow, late one night. Twenty-five years later the police mount a cold case review of the unsolved case, and the friends finally have an opportunity to clear their names once and for all. However, when one of them dies in a suspicious house fire, and another in a burglary gone bad, it seems someone is still pursuing their own brand of justice.

If the remaining two are to avoid becoming the next victims they need to find out what really happened all those years ago.
