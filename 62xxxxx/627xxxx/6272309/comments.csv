Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer who lives in New York City and has recently been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) in addition to failing to meet the deadline to turn in his new book, which he hasn't written yet. One day, Eddie comes across Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth), the brother of his ex-wife Melissa Gant (Anna Friel). Vernon is a drug dealer who offers Eddie a sample of a new drug, NZT-48. Eddie accepts and, much to his surprise, the drug increases his intelligence and improves his focus.
Eddie asks Vernon for more of the drug, which is illegal, and Vernon agrees. When Eddie goes to Vernon's apartment, he finds Vernon dead. He also finds a stash of NZT hidden in the oven alongside a book with several names and some money, which he steals. With Vernon's money and the NZT, Eddie creates a new image for himself and abandons writing to enter the stock market. Becoming rich at an incredibly fast pace and is soon being employed by powerful businessman Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). Eddie also gets back together with Lindy and starts feeling he is being stalked by a man in a tan coat (Tomas Arana). Soon, the side-effects of NZT appear: Eddie has to keep moving forward or he feels physically and mentally restless, and starts having memory lapses, in which his mind appears to be oblivious to the actions of his body."
