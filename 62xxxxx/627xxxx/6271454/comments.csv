,falvebarm,2011-04-29T08:07Z,Hopefully it can be viewed in 3D with the same glasses that I got when I saw Avatar in 3D at the theater.  I still have those glasses - never threw them away.  ;-)

,JVisc,2011-05-05T11:31Z,"This movie format is ANAGLYPH (Red-Cyan)
I found this after I downloaded 5GB :(

Shame on the uploader for misleading people, I was hoping for a PROPER 3D format.

(note that anaglyph is the only format you can watch without special hardware. Get some red-cyan glasses off Deal Extreme and you'll be fine. ~$4USD)"
