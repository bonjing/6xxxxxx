,DFigotin,2011-03-29T20:34Z,"I know this is probably asking for too much but do you think you can do some old school mafia movies? like the Godfather? Goodfellas? Casino? Some Martin Scorses pictures? Raging Bull? Taxi Driver? Maybe Robert DeNiro's Directorial Debut, A Bronx Tale? One more that I would really insanely appreciate is Paid In Full with Mekhi Phifer about some drug dealers from Harlem in the cocaine era. Would appreciate your work even more than I do now. Thank you!"
,DFigotin,2011-03-29T20:39Z,"sorry the last one that just came into mind is the movie O, a retro adaption of William Shakespeare's Othello. A Great film that involves racial as well as envious and jealous love amongst peers. Sabotage as well as murder. Julia Stiles as well as Josh Hartnett also portray main roles. Thank you again. "
