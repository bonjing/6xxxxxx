,Ataractic,2011-03-28T16:11Z,"Thanks for Breakout kings and Californication, Sir. BK is certainly looking good;couldnt thankyou enough for introducing it to us!"
,Fangular,2011-03-28T16:54Z,"Thanks *again* oh wondrous 2040! I was hoping you'd upload Mildred Pierce.. it's been getting great reviews but I just didn't want to expend 500-odd MB per episode on it.. and now I don't have to!  And I hadn't heard of South Riding - but I just looked it up to see that the divine David Morrissey is starring in it.. so I'm in! 

Thanks heaps - cheers!"
,Ataractic,2011-03-28T17:37Z,"2040: after the minor fiasco of missing the 1st episode of breakout kings- think I'll download mildred price and South riding too. Hope they're at lease half as good as the shows you've introduced to me before. 

Thanks a lot!"

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-28T19:02Z,"Thanks Jon, thanks guys.

@Ataractic: Of these series I religiously watched Shamless only, and I plan to watch Waking the dead later tonight.
I do not have time to watch 98% of my uploads, but I never forget to recommend something if I have watched and found excellent."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-28T19:05Z,LOL... shameless mistake = Shamless
,jmac85,2011-03-28T19:36Z,"[+1]  Thank you for this pack. Will give Mildred Pierce and South Riding a try. Though, admittedly I got MP from 'BoB', as I have a FileServe premium account and it downloads much faster than torrents. Plus, less risk of copyright infringement notices from Comcast."
,OsakaHugger,2011-03-28T19:39Z,Can someone tell me what happened to Craig Ferguson? 
,jotalopes,2011-03-28T19:51Z,"Thanks for The Simpsons!
