,memphist,2011-03-27T14:05Z,"I've had the same problem as rickschoo.  I've tried just about all of them that say they'll hide my IP and do not hide my IP.  It masks nothing from my experience. 

Is there something we are doing wrong?
Thank  "
,rickschoo,2011-03-27T18:48Z,hey memphist bro. u want to hide ip then use vpn. go download proXPN. SEARCH GOOGLE. proXPN is the best. u gone love it
,bert16,2011-04-01T04:03Z,"Will ProXPN slow down your speed? I mean, you're going through a VPN."
,bert16,2011-04-03T04:55Z,"I was looking through ProPXN's site where the word ""free"" is all over the place. They make you download and install the software before anything. THEN they tell you that ""free"" is only in the US and the Netherlands, and you're limited to 300 kpbs -- if you want more, pony up the cash. What servers today are in only in the US and the Netherlands? Thanks, I'll stick with a real free proggie I found here called uTorrent IP mask."
