why are they RAR?
why aren't you seeding this?"
,Lobyone,2011-03-28T06:16Z,looks legit... ill bite
,king_deeder,2011-03-28T06:18Z,"i agree with R3zb0y, im not sure if its even worth downloading...."
,XboxMySocks,2011-03-28T06:40Z,"R3zboy: why are you such a tool?
why cant you download a sample?
why dont you shut up?"
,XboxMySocks,2011-03-28T06:45Z,"R3z also shut up it's 80 RAR files, it's this way because it was taken from private websites where RAR files are a requirement (you can't drop KB on a rar but you can on an avi)"
,pourable,2011-03-28T06:46Z,I'll guinea pig this torrent and verify wether it's legit or not.
,pourable,2011-03-28T06:48Z,I'm guessing its fake based on comment removal
,pourable,2011-03-28T06:49Z,but the jury is out I'll post when I verify

A/6 
V/7      
Slightly grainy picture and a bit dark in places, the audio is pretty echoic and tinny but the copy is still pretty impressive for a first CAM copy and is certainly watchable...
Many Thanx to LKRG for the decent copy and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
,gutalini,2011-03-28T14:35Z,"Nice Quality!
Thanx for copy, LKRG)"

,nagydeak,2011-03-28T20:56Z,"AWESOME! i d/l this last night. gotta say, great capture for a cam.

audio: 6
video:8.5

i don't give the audio a great rating only because its mostly a music video and the cam audio is a bit ""tinny."" i'd give it a 7-8 if this was just an action film with out an AWESOME soundtrack.

THANKS for the upload!! seeding"

,idkeither,2011-03-28T22:47Z,Agreed with nagydeak for a cam quality. it was out of sync at time dont know if it was my xbox 
,spina27,2011-03-28T23:22Z,Thanks Heist!! Always great.... can you get Beastly? 
,Eirecoreman,2011-03-29T00:09Z,"this movie is protected by Cinavia and cant be viewed on any bluray player such as PS3 or ripping it to even a standard DVD.

not the biggest issue but its a nice to know in future 
but my question is this, why the hell put a anti piracy program on a CAM rip?"
,KnottyBoi,2011-03-29T01:41Z,"Damn.. i cant sell this one...lol
thanks but Yall WAIT for a r5 or dvd...
a5 v4--kills the special effects"

,mesays,2011-03-29T04:24Z,any heads poppin up or stuff like that?
,XboxMySocks,2011-03-29T04:43Z,"mesays: watch at a theatre, then download cam to watch when you want"
,skulltafa,2011-03-29T05:44Z,"why is this copy protected by Cinavia ?
could you at least warn us next time before we download, i dont even get it i can download an illegal copy of the movie but i cant watch it on my ps3 because that illegal copy is protected O_o"
,keith28,2011-03-29T07:32Z,A:6 V:6 really good cam but sound is out of sync and a few parts u have people walking by the cam and a few parts cam goes completely dark i stopped watching because i want to wait for a better copy. Thanx uploader and good job
,mesays,2011-03-29T09:45Z,thanks xboxmysocks theatre it is...I've been really looking forward to this don't want to wreck it
,HelpForHeroes,2011-03-29T13:05Z,rare files cheeers for that
,tahunter,2011-03-29T20:57Z,"  Couldn't seem to open!  Do you recommend unzipping all files at once, or in 80 separate steps?!!  P.S., The alternate download, mentioned in comments does not work well, at least with VLC.  It is A/6, V/0"
,larryman2008,2011-03-29T20:58Z,"thanks for the effort, allways appreciated. But in reality this is at best
 a-2 v-3 
and that's a fair cam report. This movie has excellent music & special effects that are lost here. See in cinema or wait for a good rip.
cheers again though, it's for free!!!!!!"
,Dsplayname,2011-03-30T02:38Z,"Thanks for the UL. Great quality for a cam, and movie was actually pretty awesome.
A:7-slighty out of sync in parts, and skips often.
V:6-Great picture quality, but fuckers walk thru theatre and cam gets moved a few times.
M:8-Coulda used some titties in it, but pretty interesting nonetheless. Ending was not pleasing to me."
,K9shibby,2011-03-30T04:22Z,"wtf none of the words after the 10min mark match the lips and gunfire is the major problem 
cool its free but this is unwatchable 
usually if i rewind a little its ok but this wont work "

,Kigre,2011-03-31T16:33Z,"I really wish i had read some more comments before downloading. The sound is way off sync.
This movie looks like is worth watching with good quality. This is not good quality at all.
All this work to upload an version thats not watchable AT ALL! 
Yes its free and i should be very thankful. 
But im not. Why bother uploading when its a nightmare to watch. I turned it off after 10 mins.

A:1 (There is sound)
V:6
M: didnt watch this upload."
[V],hiest,2011-04-01T04:40Z,"@ People

There are better releases,
When i shared this copy, there were no other copies of this movie in whole P2P community, look at the date of upload before complaining about the quality,
LKRG released the first copy of this movie.

This was uploaded on: 2011-03-28

You cant expect a BRRIP quality in a cam which was uploaded on  2011-03-28.

Look at the date of upload before downloading, dont look at the seeds and leaches.
"
[V],hiest,2011-04-01T05:10Z,"Reality Check:
If a torrent was good, no one cares to write a review on the torrent, but if it turns bad, thousands of you guys come yelling through the uploaders brains..."
,DethPirate,2011-04-01T21:00Z,thanks for your efforts hiest! I saw this movie @imax 3 days ago and had to see it again. But I'll just wait for the blu-ray
,woolva,2011-04-02T02:54Z,will people stop sayin y is this protected by Cinavia its not any fault they now use it in audio played at cinemas so if u record it by cam then ur fu**** for for ps3 an such devices wait for rip jeese
