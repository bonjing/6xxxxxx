I commented on the animated bible stories.  They are great and I hoping the speeds increase.

For this one, everytime, I try to click download this torrent, it says page not display.  I will keep trying, but if you know of any other way that I can quickly download this and the bible animation, please let me know.  Thank you so much for all your great work!
