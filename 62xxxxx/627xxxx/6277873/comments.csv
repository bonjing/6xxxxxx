[V],jainmehul,2011-03-29T04:37Z,"Welcome All...!!

& BTW, CDRips are better than iTunesRip..."
,SoftWarez,2011-03-29T05:43Z,Thats what they all say ....
,DrizzyDeniz,2011-03-29T11:37Z,iTunes rip is better as a CD -.- noob.. it's digital.
,blizwiz,2011-03-30T13:58Z,"Morons dont know shit about music quality. Analog is better than digital. Why do you think all audiophiles have a DAC (digital to analog converter)
Also Itunes comes in 128kb. Uncompressed CD rips can reach upwards of 1000kb
Physical Media > Digital Download"
[V],jainmehul,2011-03-30T14:10Z,"^^
Rightly Said.... Physical Is Better Than Digital.... :):)"
,Jabdy69,2011-03-31T04:52Z,"Everyone talks about CDrips & iTunes ripped. Can't you just say ""Thanx... Great upload"".
Well guess.... CDrips are WAY better than iTunes ripped. So Thanx Jainmehul for this great upload."
,onoshinji,2011-03-31T13:44Z,seeed its goood shit
,sillykumquat,2011-04-05T03:21Z,Fucking awesome! Wiz khalifa is the shit! Thanks for uploading!
,MODERNdayHIPPIE,2011-04-17T12:26Z,Yep..... CD Rips Are Better Than Itunes Rips. Fact. End Of Story. Fullstop.
,MODERNdayHIPPIE,2011-04-17T12:27Z,"Peace, Love And Pum Pum!!"
,MODERNdayHIPPIE,2011-04-17T12:29Z,Jainmehul........ I Would Prefer If You Done CD Rips Than Itunes Rip Mate. Itunes Rip Is Way To Quiet For My Technics Stack System.
[V],jainmehul,2011-04-17T16:58Z,"^^
i look if i can get the physical CD as soon as possible but if itunes version leaks i upload that as it is highly seeded.. but i always give CDRips more importance than iTunesRip"
,Ghayyurious,2011-05-12T03:38Z,mertpzjennei @ hotmail dot c0m - add me
,zetty2009,2011-05-15T11:07Z,"I agree with jainmehul that the CD Rip here is of much superior quality than what 'softwarez' is promoting in the comment section as a supposedly superior ITunesRip...the simple reason being that the ITunes Rip is basically a reencode of an already lossy format to 320 kbps mp3... whereas jainmehul's torrent is a direct rip from lossless CD to mp3.

Hence no comparison required...this is a better rip without a doubt ..Peace !!!"
