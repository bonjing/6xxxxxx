Track listing for Now You Are One of Us

its out there and its gonna get you
we know where you sleep
the kids will grow up to be assholes
wait until i get my hands on you
you will never take me alive
delivered in a firm unyielding way lingering for just a bit too long to communicate the message â€œi own youâ€
the most important part of your body
what's so amazing about grace
you're one of them aren't you?
the song will eat itself
...and all the candy you can eat
all manner of pox or canker
at the other end of the leash
we will make you one of us
the house is alive and the house is hungry
