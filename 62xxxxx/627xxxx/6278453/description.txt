The much-anticipated sequel to "Hangover Honeymoon", "Tequila Vampire Matinee" features more bloodsoaked tall tales about restless ghosts, stray dogs, lovesick vampires, singing bank robbers and other hellbound creatures of the night. Recorded at Quain's infamous Casa Bastard studio, "Tequila Vampire Matinee" is a 66-minute trip through the feverish imagination of Kevin Quain, a genre-smashing collision of raucous Tex-Mex, snappy rags and ambient country twang. Includes Thief of Dances, Picking Flowers, and Born A Dog.
