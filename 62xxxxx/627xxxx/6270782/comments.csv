,smirt,2011-03-27T11:58Z,"Well this just changes the skin in the native player skin, this is nice for those who want to change the skin in SP, but in multiplayer will make everyone with that skin and its only client side :S "
,_CVX_,2011-04-01T06:04Z,"well yeah, duh

anyone with an account would know that u login to change your skin, this is obviously for those without accounts and as you said, using SP"
,Ninjazek,2011-04-06T15:42Z,why did everyone in multiplayer has the same skin as me?
,Ninjazek,2011-04-07T08:38Z,"wtf? i got a mw2 skin but others didnt see my skin , they say my skin is default even thought it isnt. i swear i saw myself with the that mw2 skin even everyone has it for some odd reason"
,_CVX_,2011-05-16T06:24Z,"its because you are using minecraftSP (or the HACKED version)

only you will see it, if u want everyone else to see, get a minecraft account and upload the skin their

otherwise sorry, this is made for SP users but there is no way to show other ppl ur skin without a minecraft login sorry"
