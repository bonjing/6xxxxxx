,hexonyxx,2011-03-28T20:49Z,For people who still get scared by Stephen King novels. This book will scare you into paying more in regressive taxation and turning a blind eye to wars of aggression against people who - just by sheer coincidence - happen to be sitting on a shit-ton of oil.

I may not agree 100% with her ideas but she is an ARAB WOMAN who has a story to tell bout HER LIFE EXPERIENCE! She grew up in the Middle East! Try to discredit someone else!!! Sick racist and sexist people who think they are PC because they refuse to hear what MINORITIES are saying in the M E!!! Everything is perfect and terrorism doesn't exist, if it does it is the fault of the US for it's policies... WAKE UP ASS HOLES!!! This woman is brave to speak her mind and say the things she does! To come out of the Arab society as a woman and minority and to speak truth about your own experience and criticize those who are powerful should be appreciated no matter where you are on the political spectrum! This woman now lives with a FATWA on her head! You would NEVER do something so courageous! So keep your critisism to yourself at least UNTIL you hear the book, and then criticize in a RESPECTFUL WAY!
