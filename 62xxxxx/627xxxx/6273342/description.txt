Hey, This is a program that Records and Loops your Selected Mouse Movements.
I put instructions in too, so easy that someone with an IQ of 50 could use it.

It's GREAT For leveling up in games etc. OR my personal favorite. GETTING YOURSELF YOUTUBE VIEWS.

It's only meant to be used when you are Away From Your Computer. Otherwise you can't control your mouse.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

To get youtube views: Open up the page your video(s) are on.
Then Open ghost mouse, click record, (Just search in the search bar and click GhostMouse 2.0)..
Then Get back into your web browser (I use firefox cus it IS fastest I've used)
Click record in ghost mouse, then hit the refresh button on your video (Don't be signed in on your account, cus IDK if that gives you views still) -Shrugs-
Then in your taskbar, open back ghost mouse and click the Play button. 
Done, it will now get your youtube views up while you sleep.
PS. If your pc is fast enough like mine, open up more tabs to your video (I use 4)
And while recording, just go to the next tab, and click refresh each time. BUT, remember to go back to the first tab, so that it LOOPS.
I've gotten upto 7k views in the 8 hours I've slept before.
