,snair1591,2011-03-26T12:47Z,"thanx alot for 'breakfast at tiffany's','easy a'and 'the town' :)
cheers."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T13:27Z,"@gopesk: Sorry, but lot of people with slow Net asked for small-sizes, especially iPod guys, who download my torrents for years (and are my long-time ""regulars"") but lately, due to my shift toward ""bigger pee"" - feel like have been left out.

BTW - DVDrips (90% of movies in this pack) cannot be - 720p at all. Especially in ""Handheld""  category - BUT - almost ALL movies in this pack have been upped as 720p H264 too (if BluRay or HDTV source exist at all)."
,Fangular,2011-03-26T14:48Z,"Thanks 2040 - what a great collection! And for what it's worth, I love these small files - I think they're miraculous, in fact! I don't even have an iPod - I just watch them on my laptop screen and the quality is more than sufficient, in my opinion.

I hadn't even heard of 'A Perfect Getaway' by the way, but I love Timothy Olyphant so I'm looking forward to checking it out. So thank you not only for the uploads and for the small-sized files but also for introducing me to movies I would not have known about otherwise.. so that's triple-thanks from me!

Cheers!"
,Ataractic,2011-03-26T14:54Z,Which dumbarse gave a -1 for such an amazing collection?
,Fangular,2011-03-26T14:57Z,Could anyone tell me whether you think you need to be familiar with the TV series 'Firefly' in order to enjoy the movie 'Serenity'? Or is it ok to watch the movie without having seen 'Firefly'?
,Fangular,2011-03-26T15:27Z,"@ shailesh417  - just bugger off, you pathetic moron, and go upload your brilliant movies.. oh hang on - you don't upload anything at all! You're a liar (the quality of 2040's uploads is brilliant) and you're also an idiot. I have some advice for you - please, please at least try to recognise that you're very stupid and act accordingly by saying as little as possible - it will be best for your own image and everyone around you will be happier too."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T15:29Z,"@Fangular: On my list Serenity is the best SF movie ever, as Firefly is the best SF series ever. In my humble opinion. Both share almost everything (main story-line, cast), however, movie and series are stand-alone and in same time both must be consumed and owned.

@Ataractic : Look up. Two times... LOL. Another Bangaloo, probably mentally ill too."
,sharan007,2011-03-26T15:31Z,exactly..anyway thanx for ur effort...n wuts wid dis shailesh moron?
,Fangular,2011-03-26T15:49Z,"Thanks 2040! Am really looking forward to watching Serenity now! And you've effectively convinced me to give Firefly a try too.. I love all of Whedon's other shows, from Buffy and Angel to Dollhouse, so I imagine I'd like Firefly as well - and that's one hell of a recommendation, after all!"
,jmac85,2011-03-26T15:57Z,Thank you for this pack. I don't normally take 272p due to the small res...but I can surely watch these on my phone...though 352p and 480p are better (800x480 screen). [+1]
,nudge23,2011-03-26T16:03Z,"thanks for all the uploads 2040.but i have a few questions,you upload all these movies and takes alot of your time up why ? you comment to ppl like shit why? "
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T16:22Z,"@sharan007: Hard to give exact answer, but I do know how it was triggered: moron asked for Godzilla 720p few days back, I gave a link to riddlera's torrent and he came back saying that Riddler's Godzilla is ugly. 

""That's not possible"" - I answered, explaining how that is one ugly BluRay, how no  one can make gold from the dirt and said a few about manners - and _ stupid me - encoded and upped Godzilla 720p.

In between (three times) I repeated how Godzilla BluRay is really ugly looking - therefore I included a sample (unusual for my BluRay rips), pointed that too - and instructed down-loaders to decide - and not to bitch later about their own decision.

Well, that moron turned blind eye on all my comments and instead saying plain Thanks or even ""You was right"" - he commented quality as ""Bad rip""... LOL What to fuck I have been thinking?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T16:25Z,@nudge23: For money. Loads of money.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T16:33Z,"@jmac85: Yep, therefore I wrote a NOTE - right below the list of movies. It clarifies a lot. "
,abj642,2011-03-26T16:46Z,thanks 20-40 for all your efforts
,dark_defender,2011-03-26T18:15Z,"Just one word for you friend, WOW !!"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-27T03:00Z,"Was going to use this to reduce the used space on my HDD, but too many moviez to do that!"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-27T03:08Z,"I echo 20-40's remarks on Serenity and Firefly, as does everyone I know that is into Sci-Fi.  Really messed up that no network would re-up for second season. Sad but true commentary with what is wrong, generally, in America."
,Fangular,2011-03-27T14:09Z,"Watched Serenity and I loved it - thanks so much 2040! Am currently downloading Firefly now.. you were right - you don't need to have seen Firefly to enjoy Serenity but now I really want to watch the TV series. I even found someone who's uploaded the whole season in small sizez (in .mkv format). 

Anyway, I really just wanted to thank you for introducing me to the show via the movie - it's very much appreciated.

Cheers,
Fangular"
,Fangular,2011-03-27T16:50Z,"@2040 LOL at your response to nudge23.. classic. I imagine this is extremely lucrative for you, after all.. you should be able to retire on all your earnings soon!"
,jmac85,2011-03-27T18:06Z,"@twentyforty: I actually have read this whole thing (believe it or not!). Problem with many Android phones is that their HW doesn't natively decode h.264/x264 at all. XviD works fine. I'm awaiting a new dual-core phone's release to see if it will. New one should be 960x540 res, so that'll be nice.
More on-topic, I've been stuck at 92.2% for hours...please seed a bit to me! :)"
,cindal,2011-03-27T19:26Z,These are great! Thank you!
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-27T21:20Z,"@jmac85: Actually, I pointed you to FIRST NOTE, ""right below the list"". But, reading the whole text cannot do  any harm, for sure.
Right there are three ""clues""
1. ...""*** Video is H264;"" (self-explainable which devices are targeted)
2. ...""MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems""
3. ...""ISO 14496-1 compliant""

but 1. implies 2. implies 3. You can have XviD and MP3 packed in MP4 container - but therefore H264 is superimposed.

Regarding seeding - I never stopped since upping, I would seed as promised - 48h at max. (8400 kB/s is more than enough for anybody) and then, as some slot open up."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-27T21:32Z,@Fangular: Do you remember Donald's Duck uncle? One that have a whole building as swimming-poll filled with money? Yep - Disney stole my life story...
,Fangular,2011-03-28T11:10Z,@2040 LOL - that's just how I picture you! Am surprised more people don't go down this same route - such an easy way to make millions overnight!
,jon4fun,2011-04-02T05:06Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encodes/upload.

Cheers
Jon
