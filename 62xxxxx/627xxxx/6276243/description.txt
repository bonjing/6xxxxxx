Unreal Tournament is a first-person shooter (FPS) video game co-developed by Epic Games and Digital Extremes. It was published in 1999 by GT Interactive. Retrospectively, the game has also been referred to as UT99 or UT Classic to differentiate it from its numbered sequels. The game is based on the same technology that powered Unreal, but the design of UT shifted the series\\\\\\\' focus to competitive multiplayer action, a trend at the time: id Software\\\\\\\'s Quake III Arena was released only ten days later.
