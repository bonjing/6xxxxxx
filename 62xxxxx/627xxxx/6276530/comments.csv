,beerman100,2011-03-28T12:35Z,"Hey mate, does this have eng subs for the potuguese parts ? And also, if this is the 2010 doco, it's just called Senna."
,zlayall,2011-03-28T19:47Z,It looks like itÂ´s just portugise and italian subs.
,spacetart,2011-03-28T19:49Z,"It's an alternate title. 

@BONE - Does this include subs?"
,gold333,2011-03-28T20:14Z,It's not an alternate title. If the nfo is correct it is the 2010 Senna documentary by Kapadia. The other 720p rip that lasts 2h42m appears to also be the 2010 Senna documentary by Kapadia but a longer version.
,RannyDoscoe,2011-03-28T21:14Z,"English subs for non-English parts:

,gold333,2011-03-28T21:48Z,@Ranny Doscoe: Those subs appear to be for the 2h42m 720p extended version. This torrent is the standard 104m version.
,gold333,2011-03-28T22:04Z,"Ok best English subs I found:

"
,RannyDoscoe,2011-03-28T22:38Z,"@gold333: Not sure about that. File sizes suggest it's the longer version. Elsewhere the 2.87GB file is the 2h43 version.

There's no NFO with the torrent here, I think the description above is wrong."
,auntystatic,2011-03-31T00:52Z,this one lasts for 2:43
,victor.brazil.qwerty,2011-03-31T18:13Z,"God, this guy makes me so proud to be a brazilian! he was extraordinary inside and outside the raceway. Patriot but only in a positive way. 

PS Ayrton Senna institute founded by him and managed by his sister Viviane nowadays helps children in need very efective."
,bighimey,2011-04-01T11:59Z,"IMPORTANT :

I have seen this movie in the theatre multiple times. 

This is the version you want!  It's the theatrical (shorter) release.

The 3hr version has many extras included but does not flow at all well.  It's as if all the special features and extra interviews from the Blu-ray have been spliced into the film.  It is good for extra info but not to watch as a movie.

Please watch the shorter version first."
,bighimey,2011-04-01T15:31Z,"Hang on, is this the short or the long version?  I already have the 8.9GB long version.  

I much prefer the theatrical release as it's cut better and is much more a movie to show people that don't know Senna's story. 

Is this the short or long version?  Can anyone confirm?"
,lexxxicide,2011-04-01T16:33Z,"This is the 2 hour 42 minute version, with the interviews added in. Like the previous user said it is better for extra information but it's poorly edited and doesn't flow well.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6272089/Senna.2010.DVDRip.Dual.Audio

Cinematic release, 1 hour 45 minutes. Same video quality, much better as a piece of film."
,guerogrande,2011-04-03T05:06Z,2.9 gb 712x400 xvid?  I would have expected 700mb for the quality.  The sub tracks I've found dont match up either.
,killem2,2011-04-07T03:56Z,NOT IN ENGLISH.  
,davidajgp,2011-04-11T18:47Z,There isn't subs.
,jesusxenu,2011-04-12T05:58Z,not Highres - Movies.
,BangUchiha,2011-04-12T23:53Z,"Thanks for the english subs guys they work great.

Thanks Bone for the Upload"
,SerSpec-V,2011-04-27T21:54Z,The problem with this version is that the added extra interviews are at least half the volume of the rest of the movie so you keep having to turn it up to hear them which really sucks. Just watch the shorter 1:45 version that doesn't have these and you will enjoy it much more. 
,rca_cha,2011-08-07T10:24Z,This is the extended version.. the above info is incorrect IT IS THE EXTENDED VERSION
,rca_cha,2011-08-07T13:32Z,"and also.. the extra interviews give a great amount of detail.. but is lengthy just got done watching it a great film..

,peterinto,2011-09-24T23:17Z,This is the LONG version.   Good quality.
,JRaiden,2011-11-23T01:56Z,"Confirmed: Extended. Subtitles needed (English).
Additions are mostly interviews: added hastily, abruptly.
Very fine SANTi release, as usual. Thanks seeders."
