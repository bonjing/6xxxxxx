SYNOPSIS:	This is the story of the rise and fall of a fictional silent film comic, Billy Bright.  It is said by some that the script was loosely based on the life of the then-recently deceased Buster Keaton.  However, it is far more likely that Bright is a composite character, as there are several aspects of his life and character that do not match well with Keaton's.  Billy Bright is depicted as quite talented, but also as egotistical, alcoholic and womanizing.  In later life he largely leaves alcohol and women behind, but the egotism remains unaffected.

Star Dick Van Dyke and writer/director/actor Carl Reiner are big fans of the old silent film comics; Van Dyke particularly admires the work of Stanley Laurel, who was still living in Santa Monica at the time he and Reiner were doing The Dick Van Dyke Show.  When Van Dyke asked for Laurel's permission to do a skit based on one of Laurel's classic routines, he was shocked to discover that neither Laurel nor the estate of Oliver Hardy had any legal rights to the material and images of Laurel & Hardy.  It was after this discovery that Reiner began work on the screenplay for this film.

ADVISORY:	Thanks to original uploader RandallmaeRises.  Since I did not have the VOBs to work from, I was only able to do so much re the video quality, which resembles Super VHS.  Sound is very good.  However, this is NOT a rip from the VHS release, which was pan & scan; it is the original widescreen.
