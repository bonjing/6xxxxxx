,tedblight,2011-04-02T07:39Z,"Plays OK, SBS... Film seems like a 2D to 3D conversion though, no 'wow factor'... could have been so much better...
Would like Jackass 3D in SBS and Saw3D SBS. Thanks"
,JOEY3D,2011-04-02T13:24Z,best 3d film ive watched is avatar no other film in 3d beats it all other 3d films look like 2d to 3d converts I myself am very disapointed with the movie makers we want more stuff popping out of the telly thats why I bought one presure needs putting on the film makers for this to happen dont get your hopes up for saw3d it two will disapoint you if you want popping out your telly stuff
,tedblight,2011-04-02T14:38Z,"Totally Agree, Avatar was made with 3D in mind... Alice is also good, CGI mixed with Live Action seems to work well. 
Too many Animation3D films, some are better than others.. Best so far is 'Meatballs' "
,rossboss,2011-04-02T17:59Z,thx so much perfect work love to get your links to more 3d movies urs are the best
,JOEY3D,2011-04-02T18:40Z,thanks rossboss this is my first film so far ive done tron legacy 3d watching tonight to make sure it converted fine without skips will then upload people will then be able to search for joey3d and my films will come up also search for lig he has a nice colection he is the one that showed me it could be done i just had to figure out how it will be slow for me till i get a tb.hdd saw 3d should be a week or two away and thanks tedblight will try alice in wonderland and cloudy with chance of meatballs
,picturedude,2011-04-03T20:13Z,"Thanks again Joey3D.
It's not eyepopping 3D but it looks better than standard 2D.

Looking forward to Tron Legacy, I've got it on Pre-Order but it's another 3 weeks before it's released."
,yarddawg,2011-04-11T20:24Z,"Members, is there something that I am doing wrong here? I have queued this up for download and it's just sitting there with nothing happening. I'm using Miro as the agent, is there a better agent or is it just the number of seeders? Usually even with this ratio, the file downloads, just slowly."
,LigGeorge,2011-04-18T23:31Z,Are you going to upload Saw 3d ?
,freeworkman3,2011-04-22T06:52Z,"Can someone please do clash of the titans, piranha, and jackass. I think those are the only ones I haven't found to download on here or other sites."

Best client is utorrent, although you might want to tweak the settings a bit, if you have a very fast internet connection (such as increasing the number of connections it can make per second and the increasing the size it will write each time; e.g. 10kb means that after 10kb is downloaded it will write the 10kb away, with 10mb it writes the 10mb after the 10mb has been downloaded). The writing size story reduces the strain on your harddisk.

For more info on the advanced settings see the utorrent site and download the help"

 freeworkman3 for clash of the titans in 1080p see torrent 5677101 of TBP
If you want it in 3d it is somewhat more difficult to find. Try torrentz com It is a very good site to find torrents.

,JOEY3D,2011-04-25T14:36Z,The Hole 3d is now uploading
,meamadbiker,2011-05-22T18:11Z,Does anyone else find that this has been encoded left and right around the wrong way and if you where you active glasses upside down then the 3d comes really good
,JOEY3D,2011-05-22T19:12Z,Meamabiker if this is the case with your tv then while watching in 3d go to your tv's 3d setting and you should have 3d correction press this and it should sort your problem hope this helps
,Terozer,2012-01-22T13:01Z,This movie is not recorded with 3D cameras. I Saw that after 30 seconds. :(
