What the crap is Arnold Schwarzenegger doing on the 

cover of Rico Slade's book? This is Rico Slade's 

goddamn book. Rico Slade is not a body builder, an 

actor, or a governor. Rico Slade is an action hero. 

Rico Slade doesn't care about the political climate. 

Rico Slade has an advanced degree in badassery. Rico 

Slade's favorite food is the honey-roasted peanut. 

Rico Slade can rip out a throat with his bare hands. 

But Rico Slade has a problem. His arch-nemesis, 

Baron Mayhem, is threatening to drop a bomb on the 

Earth that will kill every human being except 

himself while leaving the world's currency intact. 

To save the planet, Rico Slade must journey across 

Hollywood to find Baron Mayhem. Unfortunately, Rico 

Slade's crime fighting style involves ripping out 

the throat of anyone who gets in his way, including 

grandmothers and Midwestern tourists. As Rico Slade 

leaves Hollywood in ruins, the only person who can 

stop him from destroying the city is his Jewish 

psychologist, Harold Schwartzman. Until he does, 

Rico Slade will kill as many people as it takes to 

thwart Baron Mayhem's evil scheme. Rico Slade will 

fucking kill everyone. RICO SLADE WILL FUCKING KILL 

YOU.
