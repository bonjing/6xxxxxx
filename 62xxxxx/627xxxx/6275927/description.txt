Diskeeper 2010 EnterpriseServer performance software
is essential for the high capacity and mission
critical server. It is the only solution specifically
designed to restore and maintain performance and
reliability of large servers, including SANs, RAID
arrays and NAS. Servers that must be kept on line with
volumes up to 20TB and millions of fragments can only
achieve peak performance 24/7 with Diskeeper 2010
EnterpriseServer. Now, with IntelliWrite preventing
most fragmentation before it happens, the massive I/O
traffic enterprise servers must process go directly to
productivity, not writing fragmented files onto disk
As a result, server life is extended by years, energy
and cooling costs are significantly cut
