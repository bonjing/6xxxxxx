Not one of his better efforts but still a must have for those hardcore Funkateers. Sure this album features Bootsy, BlackByrd, Garry Shider, and others - but its probably the weakest P-Funk album out there. You can get a used copy for 1 cent at Amazon.com plus shipping and handling.

Track listing:
