THE APOLOGIES

Some of whatâ€™s on this DVD may be insulting to some people. Some of the bits that we considered â€˜funnyâ€™ at the time arenâ€™t really all that funny, sometimes probably plain insulting. Please believe that it was all done with the most harmless of intentions. In particular some of the French attendants seem to have been the butt of a few jokes too many. It might help to imagine that maybe we were just feeling really insecure ourselves.
