Game information:

Crysis 2 is the sequel to one of the greatest PC first-person shooters yet
created. Featuring futuristic war, gorgeous destruction and the chance to
kick alien butt on the grandest stage of all, New York City, Crysis 2 is
destined at the least to equal its predecessor, if not surpass it.
Additional features include: challenging AI enemies in the single player
campaign, 12-player support online, new and improved upgradable Nanosuit 2
technology and more.

The world has been ravaged by a series of climatic disasters and society is
on the verge of total breakdown. Now the aliens have returned, with a full
invasion force bent on nothing less than the total annihilation of mankind,
starting by trying to rip the heart out of Earthâ€™s most iconic city.

In New York, terrifying alien invaders stalk the streets and a nightmare
plague strikes down the cityâ€™s myriad inhabitants with brutal epidemic
speed. The cityâ€™s systems are in chaos, its streets and skyline are
smashed and in flaming ruin. This is New York City like youâ€™ve never seen
it before. Neither paramilitary law enforcement nor the might of the US
military machine can stand against the invaders, and all who choose not to
flee are dead men walking. Just to survive in this maelstrom of death will
require technology beyond anything any modern soldier has ever seen.

Yet one man will inherit that means to survive. One supersoldier, wielding
the combat enhancement technology of the future with Nanosuit 2, will make
the last stand to save humanity from destruction in the urban jungle that is New York City.
