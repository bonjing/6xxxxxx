,dolly121,2011-04-27T21:54Z,"Thanks, but just so you know, you can download it for free directly from Kawasaki's website."
,dolly121,2011-04-27T23:13Z,"EDIT: I just realized this is a SERVICE manual, not an OWNER's manual, in which case you cannot download it for free from Kawasaki.

guiltyspark119, thanks for the torrent.  You might want to update the description so that there is no confusion regarding the contents.

Thanks!"
,guiltyspark119,2011-07-14T09:24Z,"this is my first ever torrent, i have no idea how to edit it, but i'm sure someone will pick up on the fact it's the service manual. i sold the bike but i'm keeping this up as long as possible ANYway. :P"
,gig7310,2011-10-06T02:55Z,What is the password set on the pdf? 
,guiltyspark119,2011-10-10T05:03Z,"password set? there is none. it's open. all i did was buy it, use it, upload it. it's a manual to work on your bike."
