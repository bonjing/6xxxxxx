,DangerDan43257,2011-03-29T11:36Z,"@animalu u could always try adding the crackfix.
worked for me without it (win7 64 ultimate), does the skidrow-fix make any difference? cheers for this guyz btw"
[V],gansuk,2011-03-29T13:26Z,"the new crackfix works, it fixes some triggers ingame, the skidrow.dll gets nailed by some av thats why it fails to run"
,simz04,2011-03-29T15:02Z,"The new skidrow crackfix didnt work for me and ive got no av running on this machine so it cant be the problem. It crashes to desktop.

Will give this release a try, hope it works!"
,simz04,2011-03-29T15:45Z,"Doesnt work. I unpacked, used the start game.bat and the exe directly, tried compatibility mode, game just wont load for some reason. Win 7 64.

The game was loading and i played a couple mins before it crashed with the skidrow release so i know it isnt my system."
,Akwar,2011-03-31T00:56Z,Doesn't work.CTD regardless.his and the Skidrow crackfix is completely useless.
