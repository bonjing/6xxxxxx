,packers12,2011-03-29T03:25Z,Please comment! This is my first torrent.  You guys can make suggestions or recommendations. Also you can ask me for other android apps and I will see what I can do. Thanks for checking out my torrents!
,mZimm,2011-03-31T19:51Z,No seeders...but now that spring training is over they have a new version out that you need to watch and keep track of the regular season games. Would love it if you could upload that one. 
,packers12,2011-04-05T04:30Z,"This is the full version of MLB at Bat '11 and continues covering the regular season of MLB. The description can be confusing, but this is the full regular season app that costs $14.99 in the app market"
,chisoxnach,2011-04-08T04:31Z,"I dunno about this download, would love to have this app, but Android Market lists it as a 6.5MB download.  Here is 1.24MB...fishy?  Any explanation Packers?"
,packers12,2011-04-08T05:05Z,It's legit and the real deal bro. I got this out of a another torrent with like 1000 apps and just extracted this one and put it up by itself so people could find it easier. I was looking for this app forever and I finally found it scouring through a ton of torrents with a ton of apps in it. I honestly can't tell you the reason why its only 1.24 MB. But I can promise you its not some malware piece of shit. I will upload other apps if that would give you some security?
