A quality GhettoGarden Production.

This right here is NOT in any way, shape or form, made by me.
All credit goes to: Nintendo, and the makers of Desmume.
All i am doing is compiling all of these programs and files into one simple set that is quick and easy to access.
So this pack contains:
Desmume:
The Emulator that will run DS games(If you encounter any problems, than its your computer, Desmume runs these without bugs)
Pokemon Black English Edition:
A Game. Simple as that.
Super Scribblenauts:
Another game.

If you want me to upload other games, i will most certainly do that for you.
If it doesn't work on Desmume (i'll check), then I will put up an emulator that the specific game works on.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to comment below.

Thanks for considering this download,
