Both Party Down and Sons of Anarchy seemed to have some problems at finishing at 99.8%...so, to fix this, I have re-uploaded both for you guys.

New steps:
-Cancel old torrent
-Open new one
-Put the new file directory to the same one as the old one
-Force re-check in utorrent

It should now recognize everything you downloaded from the old torrent and continue and finish with the new one.

Sorry for the problems!

Enjoy!"

the old torrent has been deleted...this is the new one!"
