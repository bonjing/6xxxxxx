It's not a stretch to call Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn the most sublime of all dance partners 
and Sergei Prokofiev the most gifted 20th-century ballet composer. 
And so it goes without saying that the 1966 film version of the Royal Ballet production of Prokofiev's 
Romeo and Juliet featuring Nureyev and Fonteyn as the star-crossed lovers is an absolute must-have for anyone 
who cares a whit about the art. Director Paul Czinner has made all the right moves, 
alternating between full shots of the performers with long shots that accentuate how 
Kenneth MacMillan's fastidious choreography is inexorably linked to the characters, 
their story, the elaborate sets, and the viewer. Nicholas Georgiadis's costumes are sumptuous without being overdone, 
the supporting dancers and ensemble are as exquisite as the leads, and John Lanchbery conducts the Orchestra of 
the Royal Opera House with just the right mixture of joviality and tragedy that Prokofiev's 
classic score needs but doesn't always receive.
