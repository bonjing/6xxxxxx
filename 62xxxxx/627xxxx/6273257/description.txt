Hey, I used to love the old pokemon games / gameboy. So I uploaded a small sized Gameboy Emulator torrent (DUH) with Pokemon: Blue, Crystal, Silver, Yellow, Red and of Course Gold.
I also added nice neat intructions for controls etc :]
It's all neat, just open the folder then exe and choose a game, and you're ready to play mofo. 
Don't forget to Say Thanks, and of Course Seed.
PS. I'm eating a really fucking yummy sandwich right now.
