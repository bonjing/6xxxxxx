,Teddikilla,2011-04-20T20:05Z,"@Tjones101: Strange, It should download. I just downloaded it then, (Yes, I did just download it to make sure it works) :]
And it took about 20 seconds, there's 60 seeders, so Idk what went wrong. Must be something wrong with your net or security -Shrugs- :\"

,nathan_shanholtzer,2011-06-05T20:12Z,hey man game works great but wher do i go so i can use tm's with my pokemon only way i can get to the screen to use them is if im in a battle and then it wont let me thanks alot for the games man
,Teddikilla,2011-06-08T12:39Z,"@nathan_shanholtzer: I'm not too sure, but I'm pretty sure you press start (default controls) to bring up the menu. And I think the TM's are in your pack and you use them like a regular item :]
Sorry if that doesn't work, I haven't played them in years and haven't got any saves on this pc >."
,edzi07,2011-06-09T23:28Z,"how do you cut down trees in red, i cant go anywhere untill i find out! im stuck!"
,Teddikilla,2011-06-10T04:05Z,"edzi07: I think you get it by helping bill the pokemon maniac and he gives you a ticket for the ss anne cruise, and then you go to the captain and talk to him and he gives you 'cut' tm as a reward :]"
