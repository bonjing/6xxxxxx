RiPPERS NOTES:

Here is Star Wars: The Clone Wars in its
original aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Cartoon
Network in the US cuts off the edges to make
it 16:9 but Sky in the UK airs it in 2.35:1.

The TV x264 standards were set up when all TV
series were 16:9 and don't have any rules for
releases with other aspect ratios. That's why
we followed the movie standards which state:
For aspect ratio equal or above 1.78 horizontal
resolution must be 1280. e.g. AR of 2.35:1 will
be 1280x544.

Enjoy this great release from BiA
