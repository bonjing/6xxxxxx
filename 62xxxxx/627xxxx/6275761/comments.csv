,MusicNutt,2011-04-09T03:25Z,"Sorry harvey263. I'm looking for the ""OAR"" (Original Aspect Ratio) versions. (note it mentioned in the title of this torrent)

Sky in Europe shows them in their original 2.35:1 aspects.

I found 18. So I'm still looking for 15&16.

I'm hoping to throw up a torrent for the missing (as in not on TPB) episodes once I have them all."
