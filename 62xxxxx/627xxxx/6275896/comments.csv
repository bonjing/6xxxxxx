,Beberik,2011-03-29T13:28Z,"AudioChecker says, all but The Last Dance are probably CDDA, so it's not upconverted."
,gferek,2011-03-29T19:07Z,"Of course it's not. I own the CD. The Last Dance is a B-Side (read DEMO version) that isn't on the normal album, that's why it sounds like this. 
It's not that bad, imho o.O"
,maxicastro,2011-03-31T07:24Z,Even being a demo it sounds pretty nice to me ;)
