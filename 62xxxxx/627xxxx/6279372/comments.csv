[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-03-29T13:10Z,I'm having a network problem with incoming connections. Right now seeding to two hosts so if they stay on as seeds then it should be OK. I'll check it when I return home.

Ungrateful asshole whoever you are."

[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-05-05T12:09Z,"@Surfari_Master: Thank you. :^) I've returned to reseed this movie several times because people keep leeching it more than they send, so it's much appreciated and you have made it worthwhile!"
,Surfari_Master,2012-03-13T19:45Z,Please pretty please seed this again. I had this movie stored in a (now broken) external disk. I'm now stuck at 63.7%. Thanks a million in advance.
