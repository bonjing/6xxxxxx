"The duo of Captain Hugo and Bibi Tulin style themselves as the best sci-fi music adventure in the galaxy by two aliens hiding under regular human skin. The electro pop music they have presented to us on their debut We Came in Peace EP holds a similar humor in it as well. The music has some very nice and interesting layers and depth while still being light and fun to listen to. Bibi Tulinâ€™s voice holds a seductiveness in it reminiscent of Debbie Harry and is countered by the harsher vocal style of Captain Hugo. Really, how can you not want to listen to a song called â€œCtulhu (On the Dancefloor)â€?"
