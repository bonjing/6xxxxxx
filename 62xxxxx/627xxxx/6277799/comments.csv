,pillzhereish,2011-06-09T14:52Z,'The Merger' has a sound issue :(
,nslugr,2011-08-08T02:06Z,"""The Merger"" and ""The Job"" do have sound issues. The audio only comes out from the left side. I fixed that on my computer.
Download and install the following software (all free, just google it):
- MKVExtractGUI
- mkvmergeGUI
- Audacity 1.3 (beta, for AC3 support)
- ffmpeg for audacity

First, extract the audio file (ac3 file) from the mkv with MKVExtractGUI.
Next, import it in Audacity to create a stereo track and export it again as AC3: http://chacadwa.com/foh/mono-to-stereo-in-audacity
Finally, open both mkv and ac3 files in mkvmergeGUI, unselect the previous audio file and create a new mkv.

Hope this helps somebody."
,nslugr,2011-08-08T04:01Z,"Adding to my previous comment,
- ""The Convention"" also has the same problem
- The volume needs to be decreased by -13dB (before exporting) to match the volume of the other files [http://compsci.ca/v3/viewtopic.php?t=18250]
- The track doesn't need to be converted to stereo, just the import and export in Audacity fixes the problem
- In the export dialog, select 384kbps to leave the same bitrate as the others

Peace"

,machasdo,2011-12-15T17:47Z,"Downloaded it and the episodes only play up to 5 seconds then passes on to the next.
Using KMPlayer and season 1 and 2 play fine.
Downloading it again and I'll get back if the problem continues."
