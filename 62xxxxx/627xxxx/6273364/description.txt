What is Almost Live? Why its a Seattle Comedy Troupe.

Why is this a Misc Pack?
A few years back, they started airing re-runs on KING5s sister station KONG16 Monday - Friday, with 2 more re-runs following Saturday Night Live. But they never aired these in any sequential order, so its just a random pack of episodes, which is far better than watching YouTube quality stuff. The episodes are mostly from 1989 to 1994.

The filenames are based on the year it originally aired (which is listed in the credits) and the date it the re-run aired (2005-2006).

115 episodes, plus the re-union show and a short collection of skits in which Almost Live pokes fun at the poorly performing Seahawks NFL team.
