Family-patriarch Jack Byrnes wants to appoint a successor. Does his son-in-law, the "male nurse", Greg Focker have what it takes? 

It has taken 10 years, two little Fockers with wife Pam and countless hurdles for Greg to finally get "in" with his tightly wound father-in-law, Jack. After the cash-strapped dad takes a job moonlighting for a drug company, however, Jacks suspicions about his favorite male nurse come roaring back. When Greg and Pam's entire clan-including Pams lovelorn ex, Kevin (Owen Wilson)-descends for the twins birthday party, Greg must prove to the skeptical Jack that hes fully capable as the man of the house. But with all the misunderstandings, spying and covert missions, will Greg pass Jacks final test and become the familys next patriarch...or will the circle of trust be broken for good?
