Lines is a logic game with beautiful animated graphics, special effects and jazz music. As with the classical Lines game, 3 figures appear on the field, and you must move them to form horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines of 5 or more of the same figure. There is also a magic ball, which is filled as you accumulate points, along with a table of record scores.
