It should be known by now that I\'ve been a fan of the Age games from way back. There\'s just something about the historical nature of the games that appeals to me. To be fair, I think elves and space marines are neat too, but I think it\'s more exciting to explore the what ifs of real, historical situations. Though not quite as faithful to \"reality\" as some strategy games, the first two Age games offered us exciting sojourns into the worlds of \"capital A\" Ancient and Medieval strategy. The third title, Age of Mythology, proved that the mechanics were just as solid even if the historical inspiration was a little loose.
