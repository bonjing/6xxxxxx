,muk0690,2011-04-01T12:58Z,"The subtitles seem to be off for about 3 seconds. 
I've synched and uploaded it here:

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-01T13:30Z,Strange - I left original subs intact.
,muk0690,2011-04-01T19:09Z,"Maybe the original was out of sync.
First dialogue in the movie starts at 00:03:27
But the subtitles start at 00:03:24.
It can be easily synched with VLC, KMP etc while playing the file itself."
