Phantom Brave: We Meet Again is an updated version of one of Nippon Ichi's less appreciated strategy role-playing gems. Its gameplay is presented in a friendly pick-up-and-play style that never undermines the game's challenging aspects or tactical sophistication. A new scenario has been added to entice fans of the PlayStation 2 original back again, along with improved visuals and major menu tweaks. Though far from revolutionary, this new iteration still satisfies.
