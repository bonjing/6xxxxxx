Jackass 3D (2010) is the title for God's sake,
and it is not 3D ! It is 2D, CAPITO?!
(because I read a few foolish comments related to this.)"
,trntz-man,2011-03-28T03:17Z,"Seriously there are a lot of stupid people out there. I couldn't believe people actually downloaded both this torrent and the other one thinking it was in 3D. Both of these torrents are under 10GB, how the hell do you think a 3d movie can be suppressed under 10GB?!?

I would assume a true 3D 1080p rip would be around 30GB, give or take. That being a torrent with great audio (DTS) and true 1080p picture that is in 3D."
,hyrieus,2011-04-01T05:37Z,this torrent freezes explorer and I would say boo!
,hyrieus,2011-04-01T06:21Z,being a linux guy I can say this asshole is MPAA or something...waste of skin

,neomorphic805,2011-05-17T07:54Z,i recoded a .mkv 3d movie from 8.4 gb down to 5gb and it was still in awesome 3d i streamed it through my ps3 and my tv does the 3d decoding itsself.  used avs vid converter.  primo!
,marquee78,2012-01-10T17:27Z,"@hyrieus  I don't think the pirate bay marks MPAA guys as trusted uploaders, 

@fatfreddy, you are the fuckin man, you might just be the greatest uploader ever, your torrents have so many audio and subtitle languages you have opened these movies up to be accessible to just about everyone, kudos"
