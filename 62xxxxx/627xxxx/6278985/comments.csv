PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Welcome to the underground world of all-female fight clubs in the first release of its kind, Extreme Chickfights is a slugfest extraordinaire. From bare knuckle fights to 2-on-1 bully teams, it's action packed. The clubs are located in private locations with fighters and spectators by invite only. Fighters include bored housewives, schoolteachers, and law students, all with one thing in mind: to show their fitness above their fellow females in an uncivilized act best left in the stone age.

Actual review for: Extreme Chickfights (DVD)
----------------------
Approximately 8 or 9 fights on DVD. They're real fights including boxing matches, bare knuckle matches, and some allow the women to continue hitting the opponent when they're down. Reviewer said there were a couple of women in that were actually attractive. Well, one at least. Three of the fights descent, three full rounds with a good amount of action. A couple of the fights end after one girl gets punched a few times and decides to quit. A few others are totally inexperienced girls flailing away at each other, completely unable to hurt each other, so they eventually become exhausted. One fight has a fat girl vs. two normal sized girls, and it's like a fight from the Jerry Springer show. There are at least 5,000 punches thrown but they're wearing padded headgear and nobody can hurt anybody. In one of the good fights, one of the girls gets her sports bra bulled up and you get to see, well, you know.
----------------------------
Just another example of the degradation of society and uncivilized behavior that proves our world is indeed headed to the promised land prophesied in the movie ""Idiocracy."""
