,jorrell0733,2011-03-28T05:13Z,"This is definately the Race Not Qualifying, a small error as i got got to change the filename on here from the txt document, but the file itself is correctly named and IS the Race, Unfortunately TPB edit facility on your torrents isnt working so i cant update the text!"

As someone [rightly] pointed out, YOU are the ONLY person trying to help we fans of F1 (who are not otherwise able to see the fun) so you ARE, THE man! Thanks again!"
