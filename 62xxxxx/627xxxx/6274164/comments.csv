Try a different IOS or a different loader, like WiiFlow or USB Loader GX. I know for a fact every song works flawlessly.. I have watched many test this very file.

@Sing4me

I'll try to make Just Dance a priority, but I'm sure you can find it elsewhere in the meantime."
,JohnnySZS,2011-08-22T05:47Z,Really great! Worked flawlessly! Anyone know how to get the shop songs for free? :D Thanks!
,Jeronwong,2011-09-05T00:19Z,"Hi, I have soft-modded my Wii with d2x (which was important, because USB Loader GX would not have worked without it), and I got WBFS Manager 3.0. I've tried to format my drive into FAT32, which it said worked, but it still wouldn't load on WBFS Manager. My hard drive is a Seagate GoFlex 320GB.  Help?"
,Jeronwong,2011-09-05T07:51Z,"nvm just got it running...just use wiigame manager, works great now, cant thank you enough wii gm"
