Ever needed to edit a files properties or anything similar and have that fucking annoying 'Access denied' message or other similar ones pop up?
No worries, Just download this file, double click it so it is added to registry (installs it) 
Then any time you right click a file you will now have an option under the name of 'Take Ownership' :]
Have fun Owning shit ;D
PS. This works on Windows 7 and Vista, I haven't tested it on XP so if you're running XP then I'd recommend googling it or someshit Lol.
Say thanks.
Cheers.
