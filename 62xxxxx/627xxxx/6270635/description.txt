    A washed up Vegas lounge singer, Jack Satin (Hamilton von Watts), has    
    no money, no job, and delusional aspirations of fame. When Jack is       
    forced to leave Vegas, he packs up his old Cadillac and hits the road    
    for Atlantic City. But his car dies in the desert and Jack is left       
    stranded in the small town of Lost Springs. There, Jack meets jazz       
    legend turned mechanic, Doc Bishop (Robert Guillaume), who helps him     
    with his car trouble. Although Jack is far from the stage, he begins     
    to find himself feeling at home in the small town. When he meets         
    dreamy eyed bartender, Lauren Wells (Melissa Joan Hart), Jack starts     
    to see there is more to life than chasing fame and fortune. Doc          
    encourages Jack to explore his true love of music, while Lauren          
    provides the audience he has always wanted. But as Jack realizes this    
    town has more to offer him than the bright lights of the big city,       
    his Vegas past catches up with him -- what unfolds is comedy at the      
    crossroads of life.
