,viothy,2011-04-29T01:35Z,"thanks tony

i'll be seeding this for a while :)

with the slight exception of ep 5 (which I am still happy with) it is good quality, worth every bandwidth"
,steang,2011-04-29T13:32Z,"Hey great torrent Thanks

But can you possilbly get a copy of ep 5 in an AVI format?"
,tonyd79,2011-05-01T15:11Z,"no prob will put ep5 in avi format for you will 
upload it in the next couple of days"
,martink61,2011-05-07T14:32Z,"WOW! Thankyou ever so much for this.
Having only Freeview in the UK, all I ever get is 
old stuff repeated so many times, I actually know the lines for all the characters... 
This is some Wicked fresh Stuff. So far I am up to episode 4... BEST I have ever seen too. The Halloween one! Can you tell me what Program you use to record and edit them, cos its perfect quality through the setup I have?? I am right under The mobile masts using Mobile tech to seed, at some flat out speeds that rival Virgins BBand speeds. Will seed this at max speeds, midnight GMT till 12noon for a month!

BIG Thanks for your efforts"
