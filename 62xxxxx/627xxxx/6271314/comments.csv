,skreemer,2011-03-28T01:42Z,"Thanks! I use to download the subtitles straight from bsplayer, but addic7ed.com is doing a great job. If you understand portuguese/spanish or can translate the web site from within your browser, www.legendas.tv is also a great resource for subtitles."

,Bob__Dole,2011-04-02T05:55Z,"WTF, Fox repeated this episode again this/the_next week.

Remember the good ole days when a freakin' show aired regularly every week?  Network TV is going way down hill.

Oh, thanks for this one eztv."
