1. Install application
2. Choose custom install
3. Set update parameters later
4. It is recommended to turn program component update off
5. Replace file with cracked one
6. Restart the computer

Seems there was a license expiration problem with our previous release on some
PCs, it should be fixed by now.

In case application is complaining about an expired license (for example you
are playing with the system date) just restart the computer one more time and
everything will be reset to normal.
