,rogersmith,2011-03-31T08:43Z,"@davidask if the torrent you use doesn't already show up, browse for your torrent software and choose it. if you're able to figure it out, run the torrent after you've successfully added it.  this will load up the trackers/peers etc."
,rogersmith,2011-03-31T08:44Z,i was able to use the magnet link np. although it appeared as if it was empty too.
,astragirl80,2011-03-31T10:42Z,thanksssss :)
