Nuclear Free Nation

The Peace Foundation's Disarmament and Security Centre in collaboration with Kog Studios and Integrity promotions presents a compilation of Aotearoa/NZ music and visual arts to celebrate New Zealand's 20th year of being Nuclear Free.

It is a reminder to the people of New Zealand, and to all that visit our country, why the passing of nuclear free legislation in 1987 was such a significant event in our nation's history.

Featured artists: Anika Moa, Baitercell, Ben Throp, Benny Tones, Chong-Nee, Don McGlashan, Dubwize, epsilon-blue, Herbs, Huia, Hollie Smith, Jakob, Katchafire, Kora, Ladi6/Verse 2, Minuit, Pitch Black, Shapeshifter, The Mamaku Project, TrinityRoots...

Utilise the force of music to raising public awareness of social and political issues!

This package showcases Aotearoa/NZ music from different eras, and aims to broaden public engagement with the issues, and ensure that awareness of our nuclear free heritage and environmental ethos is passed on to younger generations.

Although this torrent contains only the audio from this release, the "Nuclear Free Nation" CD/DVD compilation is an excellent tool for working towards the goal of educating the public around the issue of nuclear disarmament and environmental sustainability.
