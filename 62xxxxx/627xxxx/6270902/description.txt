Churchillâ€™s Other Lives, begins, in which historian Sir David Cannadine looks at Churchill not as a statesman but as a Renaissance man. â€œIn contrast to todayâ€™s 24/7 politicians who have neither the time nor the talent to cultivate their hinterlands, Churchill did so all his life with extraordinary energy, imagination and versatility,â€ said Sir David. â€œI do not think that many of us appreciate the full dimensions of his personality and his genius.â€

And the extraordinary range of that personality and genius is perhaps best illustrated by his skill at the humble art of bricklaying. Churchill was a qualified member of the Amalgamated Union of Bricklayers and at Chartwell, his home in Kent, he laid a superb red brick wall around the vegetable garden with a trowel in one hand and a cigar in the other. He also built a swimming pool and a goldfish pond.

Bricklaying was only one of his many interests and the first signs of that rich and varied life were not as a builder but at Harrow school. There his achievements were not academic â€“ when it came to brains he would later describe himself as a â€œlate developerâ€ â€“ but rather as a swimmer for the school and at the age of 17 as the British Public Schoolsâ€™ fencing champion.
