Comments
Samson Reading; Single camera presumable operated by a member of the Samson crew starting from on stage Chris side and then on Paul's side and then continuing to swap between them. Some sound dropout, and occasional picture breakup & sharp editing between tracks as the camera moves from one side to the other but otherwise rather good although the a/v sync is off in places.

Samson Birmingham: Single tripod mounted camera shoot nearly dead on to the band over the heads of the crowd. Clear picture and sound although some tape wear is evident although you can see Bruce Dickinson's moustache!!!

UFO London 92: Pro shoot from TV broadcast but shot really close up.
