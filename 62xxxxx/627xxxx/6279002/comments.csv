,keirat,2011-03-29T05:24Z,"Can't give you a comparison to the TS and other previous releases, but there is an odd screen flicker at points and darks in particular don't do very well. Color seems a bit off (but not too far) from stills I've seen online. Still, it doesn't look like a cam or TS to my fairly untrained eye."

,msmmpts,2011-03-29T05:36Z,seed guys..
,xela1337,2011-03-29T05:46Z,It's not a CAM. This is the real thing.
,ballsackr,2011-03-29T06:02Z,It is a scene release so I'm sure that it is fine. I hope the bluray will be out soon here also.
,bloodyjimbonney,2011-03-29T06:18Z,Good quality. Any chance you'll be putting this up as 1 file instead of 2?

,_LarZen_,2011-03-30T11:23Z,"Picture is to dark, that combined with a not so great picture quality makes it not worth watching before a better rip comes.

Movie is out in about 2 weeks so I recomend people to wait."

You have to give credits to DEFACED cause they were first in uploading a DvDRiP, thanks to TVTeam for sharing, on the other hand, i agree with the majority of people who said about the quality.

Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

================================= Â«Â« ENGLISH Â»Â» ==================================


Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

PS: Feel free to copy and spread this to all torrents you download and upload, please!"

,ballzopie,2011-04-21T01:29Z,"My humble attempt to find the best deathly hallows rip 

Opening thoughts...
First off the movie is long enough to justify a 2 cdrip 1.39GB+, therefore i did not even consider 700meg releases
Second.. stop saying the movie is dark.  Have you never seen a harry potter movie? they're all dark, wake up!
I evaluated the following rips

Taken into consideration....
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6107024/Harry_Potter_And_The_Deathly_Hallows_Part_1.2010.PPVRIP.XviD-WBZ
Grainy, pixelated, colors seemed off
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6279002/Harry.Potter.and.the.Deathly.Hallows.Part.1.DVDRip.XviD-DEFACED
poor video most obvious in forest scene 1:03:55 CD1 (too bad too, usually scene rips never let you down)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6319993/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows__pt_1_Divx_DVDRip_(eng)
very solid rip, excellent quality [1 avi file 720x404 1.6GB] unfortunatly aspect ratio is off, should be 2.35/1 aka 720x304
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6281928/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_Part_1_HDRip_XviD-MAX
at first glance looks good, however it looks like ripper played with coloring in an attempt to brighten the picture
clearly the brightest rip but not authentic,


And the winner is...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6306554/Harry.Potter.and.the.Deathly.Hallows.Part.1.DvDRip.XviD-AZER000
excellent quality, proper 2 cd rip [2 avi files 720x304 1.39GB]
obviously you may see a bit more crispness in the video from a 2+gb release but this one is best bang for your buck,
good addition to any collection.

Thanks for the upload azer000"
