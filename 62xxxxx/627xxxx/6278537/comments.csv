,Zoecucumber,2011-05-13T20:58Z,"change ""[PS3] Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 [Ps3InMe][EUR].part05"" to ""[PS3] Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 [Ps3InMe][EUR].part04"". and so on. change part 5 to 6. 6 to 7. the last part should be part 10."
,slick666,2011-05-14T23:30Z,"Dude, Can u please upload part 4 separetly. It's Missing and I'm sure a lot of ppl dont like the idea that there is a huge movie file that gets skipped when you have to change the rar sequencing. Ty"
,miniRockStaR,2011-05-15T10:45Z,"If you rename the rars, you will get a CRC error, so I guess the part 4 is missing.."
,Zoecucumber,2011-05-15T19:11Z,"i renamed the rar files like zoe said, i got an error but closed the box, it continued to unpack, now i'm playing the game on my ps3 :) nothing wrong so far"
,Zoecucumber,2011-05-15T19:11Z,"*like i said
lol"
,Zoecucumber,2011-05-15T19:12Z,"btw, the movies were there. so idk what got skipped."
,Ps3InMe,2011-05-15T22:48Z,"Nothing got skipped Guys, 

It was a mistake made By me.
This is the Full game nothing got ripped."
,Zoecucumber,2011-05-16T17:17Z,"like i said, just rename them. it worked for me"
,orbknives,2011-05-31T19:06Z,"Hi Ps3InMe, this one is missing one movie file ""animation_movie_03.m2v"", even though the extraction has finished. Try comparing the content of the rar file to the extracted one, especially on the folder [PS3] Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 [Ps3InMe][EUR]/![PS3] Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 [COMBAT][VOSTFR]/BLES00978/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/data/PS3/movie. If you can, please upload the complete file, thanks!"
