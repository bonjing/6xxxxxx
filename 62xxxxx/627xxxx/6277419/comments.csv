YOU DON'T KNOW what a TS is!! A TS is just line audio, that's it, no body here said anything about this upload being a DVD rip. It erks me that you make a smart ass comment about wannabees.. when in fact it is YOU who is the obvious WANNABE!! Please stfu"

Just wondering because the comment seems to be a waste of time.
