,rxrxrxr,2011-04-24T13:49Z,All of the songs are slightly higher pitched than normal... not sure why no one has mentioned it but for me it's pretty obvious. 
,tcabbab,2011-04-24T17:48Z,"yeah I thought that too at first, but then I realized the youtube versions were the ones that were the wrong pitch. probably to evade removal. and yes, it sucks."

will seed forever"
,thedude27,2011-07-30T20:21Z,"Downloaded fast, sure, but every song is pitch shifted up."
,uhohspaghettios,2011-08-01T12:47Z,"Only checked Demon Days, and yes, EVERY song is a half-step higher than the original track.

I know because I tried to sing the first ""ooh"" in Dare and it didn't match...and though I really hate when people throw their ""credentials"" at you, as a music student/singer it's no question."
,1isozia1,2011-08-05T09:14Z,was very happy untill i noticed songs are pitched higher...but pretty good even so
,Nicky.g.5864,2011-09-04T07:32Z,"mr. broken baton i dont know why your posting modest mouse lyrics in a gorillaz torrent but ill go along anyways. let me start from the beginning. 
I backed my car into a cop car the other day. Well he just drove off, sometimes life's OK. I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh what did I say? Well you just laughed it off, it was all OK."
,tom_appleford,2011-09-06T17:56Z,"awesome, thanks"

,kayleighember,2011-10-10T19:04Z,"What... what is this... the key is like modulated up a step or two... these are not... yeah I'm just gonna have my sister make me a copy. -__-
But good job at organizing/labeling/sticking all the album art with it *shrugs*"

,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2011-12-22T00:20Z,Never heard of the Fall ever. so thanks a lot. 
,JonnyMonster91,2012-01-20T09:16Z,WSE spotted a trojan horse and some other garbage. I'd recommend steering clear of this one if you like your computer the way it is. Plenty of other torrents with the actual content.
,habwin,2012-05-03T18:46Z,"Thank you so much, you've saved me a lot of searching "
,dyt2012,2012-06-14T12:09Z,JonnyMonster91 what are you smoking?
