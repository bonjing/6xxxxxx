It is in 2-track stereo, and PAL.

This .mkv file appears to be ripped from the commercially released DVD, but has been extremely compressed (the running time is 3 hours 40 minutes).  If you want to burn it to DVD, I suggest you use a program (like DVD Flick) to create a VIDEO_TS file that will fit onto a dual-layer (8.5 GB) DVD."

For one thing, the DVDR torrent of this performance (some 11 GB) at Demonoid has now officially been declared ""dead"" after I (and about five other members) spent almost 4 weeks downloading it only to have it jam at 98.8%.

I successfully converted this .mkv rip to DVD, but it took a bizarre amount of time using programs that are usually much, much faster.

I created a VIDEO_TS file by running the .mkv file through DVD Flick, where it took 30 hours (!) to encode the audio.  At first, when I noticed that it had been running for a few hours and seemed to be stuck at 12%, I assumed there was an error and aborted the conversion.  I then tried again on two different machines, and the full encoding and conversion process took between 30 and 32 hours, with the vast majority of that time spent encoding the audio.  Let me also mention that I targeted the VIDEO_TS file to fit a dual-layer disc (8.5 GB) in PAL (the performance runs 3 hours 40 minutes).

The results are better than I had hoped for: the video is quite clear throughout when played back on a standard DVD player on a large screen TV (usually when you blow up a file of 761 MB to 8.5 GB there is a loss in quality).  Using ImgBurn, the DVD burned in regular time (about half an hour for the first pass and 20 minutes to verify).

So there you have it!  It's a great performance, a must for all Rossini fans, especially for Marilyn Horne and Samuel Ramey.

Let me know if you have any questions!"
