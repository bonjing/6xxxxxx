                     DESCRIPTION                   
                                                                
          Last week's winning family returns to take                  
          on a new set of challengers, hoping to               
          increase the prize money they have already           
          won. The hosts support the two teams as their        
          `fifth members', while they take part in a           
          series of fun games, in an effort to hold on         
          to as much of their allocated 100,000 as possible
