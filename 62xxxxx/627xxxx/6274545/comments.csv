,Vysce,2011-04-05T01:23Z,"CN logo and their little ads are weird, but the audio is fantastic and the video is nice too. Thx for the upload! One thing tho, when I put them into iTunes it sent them into my Movies instead of my TV shows. Is there a way to fix that? It's no biggie if not. Thx again, I love this series"

Plus I heard that e-17 onwards have hardcoded sub titles....Does this have that?"
