,hakuna_matata,2011-03-29T00:19Z,"I thought you were not going to upload this movie, and now you did. May be I miss-understood. 

Thanks for the up .. and 20-40 plz tell me the settings sent you mail."
,bender1110,2011-03-29T02:34Z,thx - but half the movie is in Portuguese and no english subs available yet?
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-29T02:55Z,READ Bender.
,Ataractic,2011-03-29T03:44Z,Awesomeness. Thanks!
,bender1110,2011-03-29T03:48Z,"I did read - try not to take everything personally. It was just a comment for other people wanting to download this and not knowing that half the movie is not in english. All you wrote is ""mixed languages"""
,cazo_lo,2011-03-29T06:33Z,"hi twentyforty, thanks for the very good work and lots of the fine pieces. one more thanks for the wishes you allways has realized.
So I will bring mine too you're attention. Please make it possible that you can bring the ""The Animatrix in a smal format like H264 352p with english audio and subtitelt (better for my Google english)"" and cut it into his 9 pieces - can you do this?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-29T07:56Z,"Again - personally: ""READ Bender.""

HINT: Top of the page:

Spoken language(s):English, Portugese
Texted language(s):Italian, Portugese

Languages are lined-up by alphabetical order (by site, not by me).

Beside, it's like grabbing the box of cereals in supermarket with ""No artificial sugar added"" written in big letters,  and screaming all over the place:

""People! Be warned! There is no artificial sugar in this""!

When someone say: ""We know. We CAN READ."" he could continue or say ""Sorry. I didn't know"" or continue... what's gonna be it's up to decisions he made, not the others. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-29T10:51Z,@hakuna_matata: 10 hours and my Inbox is empty. Are you sure that you sent e-mail and not the letter? lol
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-29T11:15Z,"@cazo_lo: Yes, I can. Are you sure about cutting ""in 9 pieces"", tough? It would make encode repulsive to many people.

That sort of things are  in user-domain, so, you should so it. Anyone can:

mp4box -splitx start_time_of_segment:end_time_of_segment movie.mp4

or 

mp4box -splits seconds_in_each_segment movie.mp4

eq. mp4box -splitx 60:120 movie.mp4 would extract one segment 60 seconds long starting on one minute and ending on two minute mark
or
eg. mp4box -splits 120 movie.mp4 would divide 
movie.mp4 in two minute long segments (or long as one wants).

Program MP4BOX is Swiss-Army-knife for mp4, free, open-source and is available for Windows, Linux, Mac and few more  OS. Just Google.

Next time, please, post the link in request, as

,skillet92,2011-03-29T11:29Z,"Thanks alot for this one! 
was waiting for it!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-29T12:12Z,"@cazo_lo: ERR. so it = do it 
Sorry."
,Kencoldman,2011-03-29T14:08Z,"Helo, thanks for all you do are you going or did you already up the animatrix http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/ 
that looks interesting."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-29T14:39Z,"Sorry, another error, just discovered.

The flags for splitting are:
- split seconds
- splits size (in kb)
- splitx Starttime:Endtime (in seconds)

So, instead of  -splits 60 (what would split/divide input  file in gazillion 60 kb segments , use -split instead (and how much each segment should be long, in seconds)
-splits 716800 would divide/split input in 700 MB segments. Well, stuff for calculators."
,t.trikiti,2011-03-29T16:41Z,"I bow my knees in front of you for this incredible upload. Ayrton Senna far far the best F1 ""car"" driver. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-29T17:27Z,"@t.trikiti: I have BluRay for three days, and I was waiting for English subtitles, what was discussed yesterday. Seeing many rips - XviD of 2.9 GB! then few x264 then small XviD of ""just"" 800 MB (624x320 as this one) I have seen what would happen regarding the people on crappy connections or allowance - and decided not to release my ""classical"" 480p rip - but  as this extra-small [quark]. Some people would object quality, but on CRT monitors or TV quark looks almost perfect (regarding the input BluRay produced well below the standards).

As I said like gazillion times:m ""Any fool can make 2 Giga-sized nice rip."".

Thank you for recognizing that my work is worth of troubles and absolutely the same for [quark] as for 720p, for example."
