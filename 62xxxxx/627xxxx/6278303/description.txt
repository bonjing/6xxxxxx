*** Video is H264; audio is AAC LC and container is MP4. ***

NOTE: Quark is lepton. Quark encode has one goal: smallest footprint possible.
      Audio is Dual (two tracks). Many players does not support that. VLC and 
      mplayer (-aid 1 or 2) do.
      First audio track is Main Movie audio, mixed languages.
      Second audio track is Commentary, English.
      English subtitles does not exist yet (just garbage one posted all over).

Requests (or re-seed requests) should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of newest torrents.
Re-seed request should contain exact time and time-zone you're in.
Re-seed time-window is 1 (maybe 2) hours because server-time is expensive and seeding speed is
above 1 Gbps. If you have slow connection, just forget about old, dead torrents.
Re-seed chances are good for single torrents whithin the week of original day of upping.
Chances for re-seed of torrents older than week are slim to none.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if circumstances allow (i.e. free slots open up).

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.

NOTE: [lepton] family = frame-size 368-624 width x -2 (depends on AR) pixels, 
             16:9 or 2.35:1 aspect ratio
             ONLY for PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, 
             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).
             WATCH from 6-8 ft. distance at low-res settings of display.       
      272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds
             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems
      320p = frame-size 576x320 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, or 576x240 for 2.35:1
             (movies/theatrical AR)middle-format, playback
             ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, 
             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).       
      352p = frame-size 624x352(272) pixels, 16:9(2.35:1) aspect ratio, 
             playback ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.       
      360p = frame-size 640x360 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, middle-format, playback
             as for 272p (except streaming)
      480p = frame-size 704x400 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 704x304
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.       
      720p = for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV and movies) frame-size is 640p or 1120x640
             (because of my own limit of 1400 MB per encode)  
             or 1216x528-544 pixels for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR),
             hardware intensive
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.
             Official 1280x720 frame-size is - simple - and - plain - WRONG.
             90% of encodes follow that wrong "standard" for years,
             what leads to unimaginable volume of "squashed" objects and people.
             Look any circular, well known object, not people, because human eyes
             can easily be tricked.
             Look at examples
             1280x720
             http://bayimg.com/PaEOfaADH
             and my 1216x720 (I go even as "low" as 704 pixels, if needed.
             http://bayimg.com/pAEoHaadh
             Use own eyes, please.       
      NAMING RULE: name.source.year/season/episode.frame-format.encoding-type
      
NOTE 2: 352p and 480p encodes use new tool-chain and new encoding type.
        320p, 360p should be considered obsolete.
        272p would remain because of compatibility with portables, but soon
        would be abandoned.
        Practically, ALL "wide-targets formats" would be abandoned, and
        only PC-PS3-Xbox formats would be encoded.
        I would like to keep PS3/Xbox/standalones compatibility - therefore, 
        I need feedback from users of PS3/Xbox and different standalone 
        MP4 capable players.
