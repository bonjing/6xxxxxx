One night, Bibianne hits a man with her car while driving drunk; she flees the scene, and the man crawls home to die of an internal haemorrhage. Bibianne becomes suicidal, but somehow manages to save herself after plunging into the river in her car. Determined to set things right, she ends up meeting the man\'s son, Evian (Jean-Nicholas Verrault), who falls in love with her, not knowing she\'s his father\'s accidental murderer. Bibianne has been given a second chance -- but will her guilt allow her to take it?
