"
,Teddikilla,2011-04-23T20:36Z,"@mulongzki123: You serious? 
Download a bittorrent program like: Vuze, or Utorrent.
Then once you've installed it, go to this page.
Click  the link 'DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT' 
and you will get a small file, then open that file using that program. It will then download, But be sure to upload as well :]
And to seed a seed ratio of at least 1 
It helps, Thanks ^_^"

                   Q.How does one get their ratio
                    Up to one,at moment mine is seeding at 0.016.
                          thanks"
,Teddikilla,2011-04-26T17:52Z,"@HOT LIPS: Just keep uploading :]
You will have an upload limit. Just set it to 100kb's or something like that. Either that or download everything and just leave it running till it seeds to at least 1. Thanks :]"
