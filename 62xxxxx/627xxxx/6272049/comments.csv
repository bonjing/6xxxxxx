releasing the game before shroo n TpTb does not makes it better from the one that shroo will upload.This release is very good but shroos' are better cuz he has info for the torrent.Aditionally it is very easy to install.It has only 2 easy steps that even a 10yo kid could unterstand.Also the download speed is much more(around 1mb/s).

Its easy, all you have to say is ""movies are cut"" or ""there are no movies"" See, is that so f**king hard?

I'll spell it out one more time for the people that dont understand - There are no movies or cutscenes in this release, if you want to play the game and understand what the f**king story is - go elsewhere!"

,Sinister181,2011-03-29T20:38Z,"Nice file size, Globe. Speeds are good too. But there's no way of telling if anything's been ripped from this. Hope all works well though, didn't really want to d/l the full 7Gb version."
,mulder00,2011-03-29T20:50Z,"Who cares about the cut scenes, Globe never has them in his torrents, they are compressed, if you want em download the 7GB file..@mcfly..

I have band with limits, so thanks Globe for making life easier! I picked up the 360 version, might check this out to see if there's a difference."
,Sinister181,2011-03-30T20:11Z,"I agree -- the least he could've done was answer the simple question. If this is a rip, he could've mentioned it in the title (one word -- rip), or the info. Just saying.

I hope that the videos are included though (like in most of his other torrents -- they're just compressed). If there are no cutscenes included in this, I'll have no other choice but to download the full 7Gb version."
,ponknasty,2011-03-31T00:37Z,No cutscenes and no soundtrack. Sound effects and voices but no soundtrack or cutscenes.
,dashingguyof2k,2011-03-31T09:47Z,"really no movies if there are in the game, just some gameplay movies... awesome graphics-the best i think.. I ended the game and had to see the end on youtube because in this it will straight away bring u to game's main menu no movie in the end when u'll end it.. what a fu**ing shame!!"

,Sinister181,2011-04-04T10:41Z,"This is disappointing. I just got up to the fourth chapter, and there's no fucking sound. There's no explosions, no bullet sounds, nothing. It didn't matter so much about the cutscenes, but this is ridiculous."
,Sinister181,2011-04-04T11:36Z,"Ignore that last post. I played on past that part, and thankfully there's sound again. Possibly in other parts there might not be sound (apart from voices)."
,vinayfre,2011-04-04T16:11Z,"this globe guy needs to learn fucking english!
why hide the fact that audio and video files were ripped... such a fucking waste of time.."
,gnurpi,2011-04-05T10:04Z,globe uploaded the vids which you can download from his blog
,gnurpi,2011-04-05T10:06Z,globe uploaded the videos on his blog
,ac1d69,2011-04-06T04:08Z,Can't even patch this fucking crap! Last 3 games I've downloaded from you globe been a complete waste of fucking time and bandwidth man. Get you're act together! Last time i download one of you're games i feel. And like others said. Learn fucking English. The way to talk you come across as a stupid motherfucker!

I found the above torrent which has the videos.pak, music.pak and sounds.pak. All up, it's 2.89Gb for just those three files. The last few torrents from Globe have been half-assed."
,OmNomk,2011-04-06T14:49Z,The torrent works...I'm playing with Nvidia 8600 GT which is bellow minimum and the game still runs great.The characters mouths don't move but maybe because of my graphics card.There is sound but I'm still on the first level. :) Ty Globe.....
,heroooooo,2011-04-08T23:12Z,"heyy poeple...... this is a half game...... at 41% , after the mission , the game automatically goes to the main menu....!!! fuck u globe...!! this is what u do for smaller downloads....!! u are a big asshole...!!! "
,ghostrider222,2011-04-16T18:30Z,"@heroooooo

Are you sure ?
Is it worth downloading ?"
,crossebby,2011-04-17T07:12Z,"Yeap, I finished the game. Some people complaining about cutscenes, but globe didn't removed all of them. Espicially the last cutscene is removed. So after the final step(end), U will directed to main menu, first I didn't undustand what happend I had to load 4 times to undustand that thats the end so the last cutscene is not present.

U can watch the final cutscene(climax) in Utube. There is apsolutely no problems what so ever, no need to install just extract and launch not to mention this game is terribly good I played it as ""post-Human"" and its messy hard. Defnetly worth buying if U want.

Thanks globe not 100% job but its OK, its happens some times."
,Sinister181,2011-04-18T12:15Z,"Guys, if you want the movies, music and sound effects, just download the following files.

-Music.pak
-Sounds.pak
-Videos.pak

From this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6265623/Crysis_2_Limited_Edition-CLONEDVD-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D

And place the three files (2.89Gb) in the ""Crysis 2/gamecrysis2"" folder.

Problem solved. Do this, and you will have the complete game, with nothing missing. It worked for me, as I was able to see the cutscenes and the ending, as well as listen to the music in the extras menu."
