* Hello PC games fans ...


* Play the new Crysis game ...


* Overview
 
Crysis 2 is set in New York City[6] in 2023 (three years after the events of the first game), which has since been evacuated due to alien infestation. Similar to its predecessor, Crysis 2 provides freedom to customize weaponry and abilities. Crytek wanted to avoid making another game set in a jungle environment, as were Far Cry and Crysis; New York City has been dubbed an "urban jungle". The urban atmosphere offers more options in how to progress and plan attacks. Players are able to navigate between floors and buildings, as well as a destroyed cityscape.
