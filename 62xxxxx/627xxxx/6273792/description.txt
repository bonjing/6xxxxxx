Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) is a master sorcerer in modern-day Manhattan trying
to defend the city from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina). Balthazar
can't do it alone, so he recruits Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel), a seemingly average

his unwilling accomplice a crash course in the art and science of magic, and

all the courage Dave can muster to survive his training, save the city and get the
girl as he becomes The Sorcerer's Apprentice.
