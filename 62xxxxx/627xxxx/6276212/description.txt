Coltranes Planes and Automobiles 1of6 Xvid AC3 MVGroup 1997

Robbie coltrane, in his own unique style, tells the story of some of the greatest engines ever built. This dvd contains six episodes, each covering a different type of engine - the imperial steam engine, the workhorse diesel, the exhilarating supercharger, the laid back v8, the noisy, smelly two-stroke, and the jet, the engine that went on to shrink the world. This is the highly-acclaimed channel 4 television series - a celebration of design, engineering and individual genius. If you want to see a man single-handedly remove the engine from a trabant, or toast marshmallows in the afterburner of a military jet aircraft, then this is the film for you - the guardian. I have a confession to make says robbie coltrane. I am a nosey bastard. I am incapable of walking past a piece of machinery without wanting to know all the details of its private life.

Part 1. Imperial Steam Engine
In the first programme, Robbie Coltrane turns his attention to James Watt's invention, the steam engine, tracing its development in a journey that takes him from Loch Lomond in Scotland to Bulawayo in Zimbabwe.
