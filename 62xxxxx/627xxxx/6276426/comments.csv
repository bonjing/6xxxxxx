,haydn01ac,2011-03-28T15:00Z,"Religion is the sum of all Evil.  
Just remember all wars are caused by it.
Kill all the Mother Fuckers who preach and piss in their mouths while their body's burn.
Amen! "
,Chance1963,2011-07-23T18:17Z,"@haydn: Your argument is not only cliche but inaccurate. Unscrupulous people may abuse or manipulate religion for ungodly ends, but true religion is simply trying to express gratitude to God and to seek His guidance. Most wars were caused by very obvious, and sometimes complex reasons. To blame religion for this is to miss the facts. Further, if you look at all totalitarian societies that were of Atheist doctrine, they were/are all nightmares. Communism was proof of that. Hitler used religion (and anything else he could) to further his egomaniacal war machine, but it was certainly not ABOUT religion. And on that last point, many sacrifice their lives in war to save and protect people. Fighting the axis powers is proof of that, and a good reason why you have the freedom you enjoy today. Your view is everybit as insufferably judgmental as those whom you would seek to criticize or blame! Lastly, WHY ARE YOU HERE? If you don't like this material, no one is forcing you. YOU are the one forcing your anti-Christian grudge on everyone else. You obviously have an axe to grind, it's not the Christians!"
