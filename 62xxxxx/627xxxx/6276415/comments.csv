any clues??"
,Mesto53,2011-06-02T06:43Z,"Nobody's posted about it, but to save others some grief, you need Service Pack 3 in order to play.  Also, to change your name.. I used good ol' ''Cheat Engine"" hex editor, changed all of the instances of SKIDROW to what I want, now they know who's name to say. :) Hope this helps guys, Thank you Ohshitson!"

,haxnett,2012-02-16T08:36Z,"Having trouble with install...
1-instructions say to NOT copy steamapi.dll when I dont' it says steam required to play, I dont' want to play through steam.
2- After updating custom DLC's I am to run the 2 files I believe data_core.dll and data_dlc_0004.wad through the unpacker however, after following each step, I have no file data_dlc_0004.wad.


Lastly, I tried to play with just the new expansions and not the custom DLC by just adding the expansions 2&3 folder's contents into the program directory and it just runs as the old game, can anyone offer suggestions? 

Thanks in advance."
