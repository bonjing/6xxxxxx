                Drama series moving between the lives, loves and lies
                of two generations of the same family who live at 32
                Brinkburn Street in 1931 and 2011. In 1931, Walter
                Ogilvie's gambling addiction leads to trouble when he
                is pursued by a debt-collecting gang, and wife Gracie
                takes in a mysterious lodger to make ends meet. In
                2011, Ellie and Nick Milliner have recently moved
                back in with Frank, Ellie's father, who has lived in
                Brinkburn Street his whole life. But all of the
                family are oblivious to the mystery skeleton that
                lurks behind the attic wall.
