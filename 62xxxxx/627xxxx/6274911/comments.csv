,raymond_u,2011-03-27T13:44Z,This is Finnish? Not the BBC feed? :s
,MikeR56,2011-03-27T14:49Z,"i seed this 50mB/sec until availability reaches at 

least 30.		

I'm only getting 19 k persecond. Why such a huge file if quality is questionable?

,gold333,2011-03-27T15:45Z,How many people are going to download this if it is in Finnish lol.
,killem2,2011-03-27T16:00Z,I'll pass. BBC feed is the only way to go.
,hockepocke,2011-03-27T16:48Z,"cant play, ERROR in VOB file 05 ????"
,dieana,2011-03-27T16:53Z,"Really should make it clearer this is all in Finnish. 
Not all that great quality either. "
,hockepocke,2011-03-27T16:55Z,Its not even 16:9 picture????
,MxLuvr,2011-03-27T17:53Z,"This is a horrible copy. Do not d/l this shit. Video quality is very poor, aspect ratio is virtually square - so not HD as the title claims. And the kicker: it's narrated in some language other than english.

Wtf wasn't this mentioned in the title? 4.5 gig worth of shit.

There's a proper rip elsewhere, a real BBC feed in widescreen (tv HD) and the size is only about 1.5 Gig. The moron that ripped this is pulling a fast one on us. 

Idiot."
,killem2,2011-03-27T18:49Z,do you have the link for the bcc feed?
,secana77,2011-03-27T19:00Z,Does somebody here have a link to the BBC rip of the race? Can't see to find it

,DaMoose74,2011-03-27T19:37Z,"Regardless of quality, it is very wrong to walk all over someone elses upload. If my eyes aren't mistaken it says Finnish in the spoken language section up top. So before you go knocking somebody's gracious torrent READ and show some respect. ITS FREE!!!! And so are THANK YOU's."

,SpF1nX,2011-03-27T23:45Z,"As it says, it is Finnish version and recorded to DVD in SP. HQ is 1 Hour and SP is 2 Hours.
Description again, read it before downloading.
Btw it is quite easy ( for most of us ) to change aspect ratio no matter program ppl are using.
Quite common feature in modern TV:s as well :sarcasm:
Something under DVD frames means specific things, especially what comes to size.
Source and overall quality are two different things, like upscaling video from VHS to 1080p.

,Geoffxx,2011-03-28T08:01Z,"i am actally pretty pissed at this, just spent 12hrs downloading this crap and have been avoiding all new channels so I don't get a spoiler, the simple truth is that this video was not or anywhere near as described.............no excuse"
,MxLuvr,2011-03-28T08:42Z,"SPfinx YOU tryt reading the description. Nowhere in there it says it is in Finish. And by adding HDTV to the title, you're clearly deceiving us into thinking this is a good quality rip, when you know very well the quality is shit. It is NOT hd. Not sure what kind of tv you guys have in Finland but HDTV is widescreen. The other kicker is that BBC does broadcast in HD so for you to rip their broadcast into crappy non hd 6:4 and then claim it's HD is just lame. And deceiving. 

To make matters worse, one assumes that a huge 4.5gig file would be superbly crisp and thus worthy of a lengthy download. Imagine our surprise to find a really crude, poor quality video that is unwatchable and not even in english.

Do us all a favor: either mention in the damn title that this is in Finish, do not deceive us by adding HD to the title and furthermore, drop dead."
,gold333,2011-03-28T15:02Z,"@MxLuvr:

Are you blind man? It says right under the title: Spoken Languages: Finnish.

You should check your d/l's before you start instead of blaming others."
,skjeggbulbul,2011-03-31T20:22Z,"Please put ""Finnish"" in the torrent title next time. Remember there's a download torrent link in the search results, so lots of people (myself included) will download it without ever seeing this page."
