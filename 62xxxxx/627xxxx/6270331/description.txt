Bug Fixes:
-------------------
March 24th, 2011

Alliance Guides Change Log:
* Fixed various things in the Shadowmoon Valley Leveling guide
* Merged Feralas Leveling guides into a single guide
* Fixed waypoint issue in first step of the Uldum Leveling guide (Stomwind to Stormwind)
* Added Loremaster guide redirects to make using the Leveling guides to get Loremaster achievements less confusing, as most of the Loremaster achievements don't need special Loremaster guides (you can simply use the specific zone's Leveling guide most of the time)
* For zones that need a separate Loremaster section for group quests (Dustwallow Marsh, for example) - The first step of the separate Loremaster guide recommends you to complete the zone's Leveling guide first, before trying to use the zone's separate Loremaster guide. You will be able to click a red question mark button (similar to if you were using an item in the guide window) to be sent directly to the zone's Leveling guide, for convenience.

Horde Guides Change Log:
* Fixed an NPC ID in the Blade's Edge Mountains guide
* Fixed several flight steps that had the wrong completion coordinates
* Added Loremaster guide redirects to make using the Leveling guides to get Loremaster achievements less confusing, as most of the Loremaster achievements don't need special Loremaster guides (you can simply use the specific zone's Leveling guide most of the time)
* For zones that need a separate Loremaster section for group quests (Dustwallow Marsh, for example) - The first step of the separate Loremaster guide recommends you to complete the zone's Leveling guide first, before trying to use the zone's separate Loremaster guide. You will be able to click a red question mark button (similar to if you were using an item in the guide window) to be sent directly to the zone's Leveling guide, for convenience.
