Flashy crimes get a lot of media coverage but the reality is that your chances of being murdered in America today are far lower than in the decade before the first video games came to market.

In other words, playing GTA doesn't have any demonstrable relation to criminal behavior in real life."
,spi-pie,2011-03-29T18:13Z,nbrazril...he's talking about the mentality behind the murder. That is something not tracked by statistics. He is simply saying that technology has provided us the means to MORE easily kill and to psychologically deal with killing. All *you* have to do is read before you dismiss an idea. Desensitization is developed by immersion. 
,opiemacleod,2011-05-17T21:10Z,Good book. The video game part is a generational thing in my opinion. But the book has a wealth of knowledge beyond that. Do you have On Combat spi-pie?
