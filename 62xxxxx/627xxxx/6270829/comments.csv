The episodes that were encoded to mp4, some of them are broken cutting off after only 8 minutes. Other episodes had commercials. One movie had a french watermark going across the entire bottom of the screen and the other movie aspect ratio and sync are so fucked I was dumbfounded. This pack is more or less a tease.  Within the week I will download the movies, specials and seasons from credible sources.  I will then encode them to mp4.  Beyond that, I will actually check the files before I upload them.  

Uploader,shame on you."
