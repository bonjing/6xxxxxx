Episode 9 has aired quite a few weeks ago.

Thanks in advance"
,BoonesFerry,2011-04-21T10:56Z,Unfortunately the show's website only has a few short clips of the show's highlights and not the full episode. I'm afraid we are all out of luck and may never see the final episode. 
,katskan,2011-04-22T09:35Z,"If memory serves me right, they are still airing the episodes in Canada. Perhaps someone could with this access could snatch it!

Canadians always get their show premieres delayed for some stupid reason.
