,jmac85,2011-03-27T17:35Z,"Sorry, taking all of 'Lost Girl' in this. Did not bother to read about it until today. Is it at all like 'Fringe' or 'The 4400'?
Also, thanks for 'What is Reality?'. Excellent, as always. [+1]"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-27T19:03Z,"Lost Girl is like no other show I know of.  Closest approximation would be a cross between Buffy and Angel, with some input from Mercedes Lackey's Chrome Born fantasy fiction world, and maybe a bit of Dark Angel thrown in for good measure!"
