Simon and Garfunkel need no introduction. The folk-rock pioneers who gave the world beauty and hope through songs such as 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' and 'Mrs. Robinson' decide to set aside their differences, and give fans a great show.

Back in the early 80's, the folk duo played a concert in central park, attracting hundreds of thousands of fans. A live album, film and tour followed. Though the performances were tight and their musical abilities were at their peak, they didn't seem to enjoy being together on stage, which somewhat spoiled most of the show for me. With Old Friends, they give a moving performance, and it's not just the fact that they're still singing their songs after all these years that gets me going, it's also the fact that they are singing them together and with pride and joy.

It was their surprise performance at the Grammies that forced them into a tour, with little hesitation i've heard.

They cover 20 plus career spanning hits including : I Am A Rock, Leaves That Are Green, America and The Boxer. Although their voices are not nearly as crisp and angelic as they were 40 years earlier, they still manage to hit the right chords, with the songs and the audience. My only complaint is the presence of a backing band. They do a great job, no doubt, but i've always been a fan of their acoustic only sets. There are perhaps 3 or 4 songs during the performance where this is the case, and it's quite moving seeing them in there old age singing their songs.

A surprise performance by the Everly Brothers halfway through the show gives us a reminder where Simon and Garfunkel's roots lie.

I recommend this DVD to anybody who is a fan of them. But if you aren't familiar with the two, then get yourself some of their greatest hits albums!

DVD bonuses include candid footage of performances during their 1970 special "Songs of America" as well as a photo gallery, and unreleased song "Citizen of the Planet"

I samband med en av Ã¥rets stÃ¶rsta happenings, duon Simon & Garfunkel's Ã¥terfÃ¶reningsturnÃ©, sÃ¥ gjordes det sjÃ¤lvklart en del inspelningar ocksÃ¥. Denna DVD, som fÃ¶rutom en minnesvÃ¤rd konsert ocksÃ¥ innehÃ¥ller en hel del mycket sÃ¤llsynt material.
