Through these works, Wiker reveals some of the most important lessons for our time as well as the true meaning of conservatism. Written with an educational purpose and witty tone, this is a must-read for conservatives, Republicans, and booklovers everywhere! 
From the Inside Flap

If you care about restoring Americaâ€™s liberty, you must read this book.
Never has Americaâ€™s understanding of herself been more at risk than it is now. But if conservatives are to restore America, they need first to rearm themselves with the wisdom of true conservatismâ€”and stepping up to the plate to offer just that is Dr. Benjamin Wiker.

Readers of his rollicking 10 Books That Screwed Up the World: And 5 Others That Didnâ€™t Help demanded this sequel, and now you have itâ€”ten books that could actually make the world better, plus four bonus books not to miss, and a warning about one celebrated book that has unfortunately led some conservatives astray. In an easy, approachable format, youâ€™ll discover:

* how the United States is following what Friedrich Hayek warned was The Road to Serfdom
* why The Federalist Papers offer less help to us today than The Anti-Federalists
* how Alexis de Tocqueville predicted Americans could fall prey to a politician like Obama
* why Shakespeare was a conservativeâ€”and what he has to teach us
* how â€œfamily valuesâ€ conservatism began with Aristotle in the 4th century B.C.
* the evil roots of liberalism: youâ€™ll find them in Ancient Greece and in a Christian heresy
* why J. R. R. Tolkienâ€™s Lord of the Rings is essential conservative readingâ€”and why Ayn Randâ€™s Atlas Shrugged isnâ€™t

Controversial, enlightening, and thought-provoking, Benjamin Wikerâ€™s 10 Books Every Conservative Must Read is sure to dominate conservative conversation for years to come.
