,Poeticile,2011-03-29T09:38Z,I don't think TPB keeps track of Demonoid seeders.
,nijal,2011-03-29T16:39Z,i'm gonna seed for atleast a month after i finished downloading
,njhere,2011-03-30T13:15Z,Did not work for me
,Poeticile,2011-03-31T00:49Z,^ Specifics? 
,wMin17,2011-03-31T10:57Z,"I ported this myself and was to lazy to upload it.  Thanks for doing it for me, Poeticile!"
,pennerer,2011-04-02T10:58Z,"Yea doesnt work for me either â everything goes smoothly (the intro, menu etc) until loading screen. After the loading screen the screen goes black and then back to desktop and the game closes."
,LoicJacquemin,2011-04-03T10:50Z,same problem as @pennerer
,RussianWolf766,2011-04-04T09:11Z,everything was working for me but after a while my controls desepeared and i can not set the again :((
,skullhill,2011-04-05T15:17Z,"Guys, this works. I have no problems and I'm on an old iMac."
,latr0,2011-04-05T16:50Z,"worked fine! untill when i tried to launch, the icon comes up but dissaper as fast and game wont start"
,ennes9141,2011-04-05T19:00Z,"I have the same problem as Pennerer and LoicJacquemin. The game starts up perfectly with the ubisoft logo and the menu popping up, but after about 15-20 seconds of loading screen time the game goes black and returns me to the desktop. Any fix ?"
,bangbrother1,2011-04-06T19:48Z,"it opens and then it just closes right before i can strart playing, what do i do?"
,tom5380,2011-04-06T22:48Z,"the game works..

it worked for me the first to times i played it, then i decided to change the graphics to high (or the highest) and then the game wouldnt work, i could get to the home page.
as soon as i changed the graphics back to default the game worked again."
,Poeticile,2011-04-07T04:40Z,"That's queer, my MBP 2009 has had no problem running it. 

Might need more details to help than ""won't open"", though. "
,nakata545,2011-04-08T16:59Z,"any suggestions for control changes on a macbook keyboard, since the presets really don't fit"
,ennes9141,2011-04-08T17:19Z,Has anyone been able to solve the problem of the crashing on the loading screen ?
,1Volt10,2011-04-10T01:20Z,"It runs perfectly on my macbook 45.1ghz / 2gb ram
but by perfectly i mean LAGGGG i can run borderlands and bioshock good but this game is lag
before you start open the ""everything you will"" folder than install all the wineskins, 1st time launching it LAGS! took 3hrs to download ;0
good job :) no issues yet"
,ynkhmer,2011-04-10T03:02Z,"Hello everybody:
I finally found solutions for most of you:

For those whose games crash once they started the game from the menu screen, before actually starting or conti your game, change your graphical settings to low (for all). Then the game wont crash.

I also encountered a problem where this is a shadow around me the whole time. Fix: set shadow to ultra high. 

cheers!:)"
,ixara,2011-04-11T03:29Z,"hi everyone,
i found out it worked perfectly if you just set the display settings to minimum at first (like ynkhmer 'n co said), then just tune your way up to you personal acceptable settings.
anyway,
great game, had a lot of fun with it, tnx to the uploader! 
does anybody know if crysis or crysis 2 is being (or has been) released (ported or not) for mac osx? (with ati 2600 card,...) ?
tnx in advance :)

,guso133,2011-04-21T08:04Z,"It says that my drivers are to old, and then i click okay and then the games starts. But as the game starts the screen turns white and i can hear the sound of the game "
,guso133,2011-04-21T16:55Z,"i have a radeon x1600 and im running 10.6.7, can i update my driver without doing anything crazy?"

,dkent555,2011-06-02T23:30Z,"Downloaded this onto my 4Gb RAM iMac, Waste of time as I had to delete it. This game majorly lagged my mac. Never seen that happen before. Shame."
,barano3,2011-06-07T03:29Z,"Ok game works great, nice downloading torrent, but the game itself sucks. Too repetitive and boring."

,laxbrah,2011-07-08T05:36Z,its runs kinda smooth on my macbook pro with all the settings on low. either way the game isnt even that good haha. but i will seed
,CosmicThePirate,2011-07-16T10:05Z,"Works perfectly, thanks for the upload.

As others have pointed out though, I can only run this on low settings.  Other then that, the gameplay is repetitive and boring.  "

,Brunchies,2011-09-24T03:02Z,It works on lion
,junoyoun,2011-10-19T02:03Z,"i recommend it...
it works fine on my mac:
os x 10.7 lion early 2011 (13 inch)
it took me 30 minutes to download it, a little bit lagged but ok, its playable."
,m3th0d,2011-11-01T15:17Z,"Okay. So the game itself runs smooth on macpro 10.7.1.  My 'only' problem comes when I touch the mouse. Looking around (and of course aiming) is quite seems impossible, because mouse movement lags like hell (not the game)! Any solution ? Keyboard input does not lag."
,L_u_c,2011-11-25T14:09Z,"Graphics and loading is fine, gameplay is good. Only problem i've had so far is the mouse lag, almost unplayable. Does anybody have a fix for this? I know other people are having the same problem."
,de_Kuijer,2011-11-28T07:37Z,"couldn't get this going on mid 2011 i7 iMac 10.7.2 had it up to the select screen once but now just black and then return the desktop.

fix?"
,L_u_c,2011-11-29T02:43Z,"My trackpad seems to work fine, but my corded mouse is laggy. Cyborg rat 7, has no problems with other games, only with wineskin games. its connected through a mac keyboard, i tried connecting it directly to the laptop but no change. Disabling trackpad doesn't change anything either. Anybody have a solution? Seems to be a wine problem."
,macsuper,2011-12-21T20:07Z,"To fix the mouse lag, download the latest wineskin engine update from the wineskin winery app. for lag you need to make a txt file writed with ""Text Edit"" in the root folder of Far Cry 2 (x84-x86). call it "" commandline) write in this text in text edit: -renderquality 0 -shadowdensity 0 -texturequality 0 -viewdistance 0 -detailquality 0 -novblank -norestrictions -width 310 -height 280 -safemode -availablevidmem 2 -percentvidmem 100 -minspecaudio -novsync -renderquality 0 -frameLimit 0 -nomemrestrict               Copy this into text edit. save it with txt rich format and locate it to the root folder c-drive > Ubisoft >= Far Cry 2  Enjoy!"
