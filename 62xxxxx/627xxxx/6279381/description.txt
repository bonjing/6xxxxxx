It is difficult to review Surrealist films, especially when Dali paintings escape even the more curious of the non-commercial cinemagoers today in this region. How then do you make head or tail of a movie so intentionally disjointed, confusing and artsy such as "C'est Gradiva Qui Vous Appelle"?

Well Gradiva may be calling all right â€“ but it's very difficult to answer, so to speak. This director, an 86-year-old man, apparently makes films that make sense to nobody but himself. The true artiste, if you like. "Gradiva" introduces an archaeologist (James Wilby) to us, and sets him off to chase the mysterious titular girl (also a double identity for Leila, played by the gorgeous veteran French-American actress Arielle Dombastle) while bedding his slave girl Belkis (Dany Verissimo) at every interval. This pretty much forms the plot for a person who is watching it on operational terms.

"Gradiva" would have been infinitely more difficult to watch if not for Dany Verissimo, the sultry porno-inclined actress that you might recognise from "Banlieue 13". The three leads all delivered good performances, one assumes, but the story is told in such a way that it projects little regard for audience understanding. Which bit is a dream allegory? Which bit is the "true" timeline? Only director Alain Robbe-Grillet and film students would know, I suppose. To others, "Gradiva" is a 110-minute long indulgence with plenty of artsy frontal nudity and sadomasochistic violence.
