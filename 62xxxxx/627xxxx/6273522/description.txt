      PetraSim is a graphical interface for TOUGH2, TOUGH2-MP,

      T2VOC, TMVOC, TOUGHREACT, TOUGH-Fx/HYDRATE, and TETRAD.

      These simulators are recognized for their powerful

      simulation capabilities involving fluid flow and heat

      transfer in porous and fractured media. The TOUGH2 codes

      have been applied to problems ranging from Yucca mountain

      groundwater flow to multi-component environmental

      remediation.



      PetraSim allows the analysts to focus on the model, while

      automatically handling the complex details of simulator

      input and results. The TOUGH2 versions of PetraSim include

      the corresponding simulation software at no extra cost.
