The Fixer is a British drama television series, produced by Kudos for ITV. Set in modern day Britain, it follows the life of an ex-British special forces soldier arrested by police after he killed his aunt and uncle following his discharge from the military. He is recruited from prison to serve in a covert police squad as a government-backed assassin responsible for eliminating criminals and renegade police officers that the law cannot apprehend.
