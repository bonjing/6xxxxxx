,pReStOn_C,2011-03-31T23:32Z,"Wow amazing this dude can compress files better than any other company in the worldâŚ Perhaps should give him a good jobâŚ Mopping the shit and piss from some crappy nightclub, as that is what the effort is worth"
,Hmacrew,2011-04-01T20:08Z,This can not be real you guys are so right but there are people who do not know about the true file sizes and get cought with these idiot fake uploaders and there ignorance. So it is good to warn the people who do not know much about computers let alone downloading from the bay..This is a classic case of a suspicious upload. Because alot of these apps are way too big  for this to be just 489.26 mbs. As for this upload this guy has to be stupid or ignorant or both SMH.. I would not download this if he paid me ! SMH

,leeryan9432,2011-08-09T06:02Z,"Do not download this, it is not what they say. They do not have all the apps they promised. Only a few like Skype, Firefox, FaceTime.

BTW, the password is 'working' so you can see for yourself."
