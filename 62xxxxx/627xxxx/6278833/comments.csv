,h4xXx,2011-09-08T23:32Z,"Now, does anybody have the actual 9th ed book???  I keep finding the 8th ed. Good for the tables, but when the prof puts homework out, it is a bit of a a pain to have to get copies from others' books."
,pseudipto,2011-10-02T22:24Z,yeah could you recheck these? chapter 5 is corrupted.
,huyev2000,2011-10-10T21:35Z,"Sometimes it helps to open the corrupt PDF file with Foxit PDF, but not this time - chapter 5 hadn't been uploaded correctly.
Please upload again.
Thank you for the other chapters - it's great!"
