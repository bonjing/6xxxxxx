,spiffdifilous,2011-03-27T13:53Z,"not sure whats going on. I keep getting the no file input error, but i definitely uploaded a torrent.."
,spiffdifilous,2011-03-27T14:56Z,I cant post the fucking links. I just keep getting database error.
,spiffdifilous,2011-03-27T15:02Z,something is wrong with the site today I think. My comments keep getting erased and every time I try to post a link to the file on a different website i get Database Error.

,notdone23,2011-03-27T15:39Z,"The magnet link works, it let me download a file called Scripts.zip"
,johnvon28,2011-03-27T16:11Z,This link is junk . It doesn't work 
,notdone23,2011-03-27T18:27Z,"I just unzipped scripts and it works. You can die in vehicles as usual and if your not in armor mode you can be killed fairly quickly. But the rest is true you have unlimited energy for armor/stealth modes. And anything else that uses energy.

You'll have to let me know when you make some more improvements -spiffdifilous-

The console cheats don't work even with 1.1 patch added. So i unzipped the 1.0 again and used this scripts.zip. Now i can play without dying every 5 minutes.

,bdsaint28,2011-03-29T11:57Z,"The file's ****ing password protected, and none of the links work. What a scam... "
,spiffdifilous,2011-03-30T20:15Z,"@bdsaint

You're clearly incompetent if you can't open the zip file. It's not password protected. Why would I password protect it? 

I'm not sure whats up with the torrent file not being available but several people have told em that the magnet link works just fine and also there is a comment that tells you where you can get it on another site.."
,neDav,2011-04-01T09:56Z,"Works flawless, but which guns have you modded, I can't really tell the difference.

It would be cool if you could have a script for all weapons, or to never lose weapons.

How is the update coming? "
,spiffdifilous,2011-04-02T07:35Z,"@neDav 

I've been away for a few days so not much progress on an update. I'm looking for a way to do the whole ""magic bag-o-guns"" work. As soon as I do I'll let you guys know.

As for which guns are modded, I'm pretty sure all of them(I'm really forgetful). The SCAR and SCARAB magazines are the same size but the carry capacity was pretty much tripled. I gave the Gauss Rifle a 15 round magazine, and it should start off with 30 rounds(15 in the mag, 15 carry) I'm probably going to up the initial pickup ammo amount of that to something more fun like 120 so you can just go nuts. I'm also working on lowering the reload time for the gauss rifle to make it more like a single fire assault rifle. I personally love using it with the reflex scope attached.

I'm glad some people are enjoying this. I'll update when I can and see if I can find a better way to host since I'm clearly having issues with uploading torrents here."
,spiffdifilous,2011-04-02T10:31Z,"ok guys, I just uploaded a new version. The link is in the description of the video I made using it. Check it out on my youtube! My name is MrSpiffdifilous. 

Sidenote: I still cant post proper links for some reason. Anyone know why? I see people do it all the time. Why can't I?

,neDav,2011-04-02T15:07Z,"NIce...., thanks. I would love to start the gane from the beginning with the Guass, Grendel, Jackel & the Majestic. "
,spiffdifilous,2011-04-02T18:30Z,"@neDav

Ya, that would be awesome. Unfortunately I don't think its possible to change the weapons availability in the game, as far as when/where you can pick them up first. "
,spiffdifilous,2011-04-02T21:45Z,Currently making custom reticles for the Reflex sight. Any requests for images? I can probably do custom colors too if anyone wants.
,spiffdifilous,2011-04-02T22:44Z,updated the youtube description with a link to some custom reticles.
,neDav,2011-04-03T18:02Z,"Cool, i'm digging the reflex recticle."
