What it does: 

Nanosuit energy is set to never run out no matter what you\'re doing. This means you can take infinite damage while using armor mode, aside from being shot by a tank...still kills you. You CAN still die, this wont make you invincible, but it\'s damn close. Stealth mode does not run down your energy, nor does sprinting, steadying your weapon or nanovision. Also, you sprint much faster than normal.

All weapons have larger magazines and a larger maximum capacity. Some have been adjusted to have less spread while firing in full auto. 

In the works: custom red dot reticles, custom weapon configs(ie. assault scope on SCARAB)

How to install: Download these files into a folder called Scripts if it doesnt automatically. Move the folder into the directory \"...\\Crysis 2\\gamecrysis2\". 

If you are using a retail version the directory is probably \"C:\\Program Files\\Crysis 2\\gamecrysis2\\\".

If you are using the Steam version the directory will be something like, \"C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\crysis 2\\gamecrysis2\\\"

If at any point you want to uninstall the mod, just delete the Scripts folder(NOT Scripts.pak) and it will be back to normal.
