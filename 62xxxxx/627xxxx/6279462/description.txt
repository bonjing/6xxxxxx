|Game Description|
+----------------+

It's the classic gem-swapping game that started the casual games phenomenon! Swap adjacent gems to match three or more sparkling jewels. The more matches you make, the higher your score. Relax to entrancing music and graphics. Get hints-on-demand when you're stuck. And when you're ready for a bigger challenge, try the Time Trial in both advanced and expert modes! 

Bejeweled is the first and only puzzle game since Tetris to be inducted into Computer Gaming World's Hall of Fame. Play it yourself to find out why!

Originally released May 30th, 2001.
