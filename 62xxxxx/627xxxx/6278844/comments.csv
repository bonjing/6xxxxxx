,beikercol,2011-03-29T02:00Z,fake????
,trickyx,2011-03-29T02:06Z,fake??? from bone?? are you being serious??
,PEXDUDE,2011-03-29T02:52Z,Nothing from .BONE. is fake
,keallineage,2011-03-29T04:26Z,Probably not fake but I'm not downloading until I know if its that annoying copy with the flickering in bright scenes. This file is the same size as those. Bone usually seems to test his stuff before uploading but I'm doubting this one.

,brotha_noomsy,2011-03-30T03:52Z,"Really hope i didn't just send a bunch of multiple comments. 
Thx .BONE."
,brotha_noomsy,2011-03-30T03:55Z,"swissjoe, TS=CAM+audio recorded directly from source. Has no bearing on video at all.
ALL TS copies are CAMs! You must have a computer, do a little google search on this and find out for yourself please.
Thx for UL best copy so far."
,KnottyBoi,2011-03-30T16:27Z,dammit man. is this v3 better than the v2? i cant tell
,keallineage,2011-03-31T04:28Z,Loses sound after 22 minutes when encoded (I encode so the kids can watch on their tv)... sound comes back after 17 more minutes but out of sync. Encoded 3 times to be sure. No problems when played on PC alone.... no flickering like the other copies.
,brimarosie,2011-03-31T15:50Z,"i had no problem at all encoding this and burning to disc - i used nero 8 and high quality 2 pass - I did not have any synch issues - the only small problem i had because i used high quality was it wouldnt fit to normal 4.7 disc so i just used 8.5 so i didnt have to compress and lose any quality
I am no expert on this and so i have no idea why it worked for me yet others here seem to be getting synch issues- "
,raysjets,2011-04-01T08:58Z,"By far the best copy out. Thanks bone you the only dude that puts multiple versions out and they get better and better.If there was a uploader of the year award it should go to you.A/8 V/8, that annoying flicker from other versions is now gone"
