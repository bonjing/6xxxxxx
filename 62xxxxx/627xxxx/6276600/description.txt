          * DTS-HDMA audio from the bluray was labeled Portuguese      
            but actually its mostly in English that you dont need      
            English subs to watch this. I included 2 subs (Italian     
            and Portuguese) on a separate folder so just remux it if   
            you need it. Enjoy!                                        
                                                                       
          * Special filters used which takes a lot of time to encode.
