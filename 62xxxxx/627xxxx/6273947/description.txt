None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 
All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 
I got fed up with the poor quality of a lot of Disney cartoons I downloaded,
and decided to do something about it. All have been re-encoded 
and cleaned up. No attempt has been made to "shrink" the file sizes.
All have custom menus using part of the original menus where possible.
I will seed until there are enough seeders and then will upload more.

There are a lot of b\w episodes on this disc that were not fully restored
by Disney,re-encoding has improved them but still show their age.
  

Enjoy
