Use the unique destructive powers of the Angry Birds to lay waste to the pigsâ€™ fortified castles. Angry Birds features hours of gameplay, challenging physics-based castle demolition, and lots of replay value. Each of the 225 levels requires logic, skill, and brute force to crush the enemy.

â€œLemme tell ya, these ainâ€™t no ordinary finches weâ€™re talkinâ€™ about. These here are the Angry Birds, the ones thatâ€™s gonna kick you in the â€˜nads. And theyâ€™re the ones on your side. They must be from Galapadapados, or sumptinâ€™.â€ â€“ Col. Angus, Bird Expert.
