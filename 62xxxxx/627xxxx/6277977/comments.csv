,dashivasss,2011-04-16T22:43Z,"I'm kind of amazed that you could even do this; do you even have the whole file?
I don't mind. 
Your deletion of my clauses I do not agree with however.

This is a collection of academic audio books and lectures.
Most lectures have to do with psychology, followed by philosophy, sociology, and then music history/theory.
Most lectures are from The Teaching Company, more information about them can easily be found from their site (support this wonderful company if you can).
Most audio books are from LibriVox and are free to download from their site.

When one downloads this post one is able to see the files available in it.
One may then pick and choose what files to download.
The first folder, AAA Guides, contains text related to some of the files. "

,ericplayzbass,2011-09-08T20:10Z,"this torrent is incredible.

I just started college, and so far (well, it has been for a long time actually) Philosophy is my favorite thing, and I am probably going to major in it, hopefully attaining a masters and Ph.D. as well.

this torrent is amazing and once it finishes I will seed the 19 gigs I chose to get forever."

,dashivassss,2011-12-27T22:50Z,...being its creator I may venture to say that if you absorb much of this you may find some kind of sad amusement at one who looks upon knowledge as a curse is so direct a manner...
