Awake & Aware - Volume 4B (NTSC Version):
========================================

A conglomeration of several political activist documentaries together on one "movie" DVD. This is an attempt at packing the biggest "punch" in one DVD title. I call the DVD's, "Awake & Aware" after a similarly titled conference in LA September 2009. Enjoy and please spread around :)

On the DVD:

Interesting interviews by "Project Camelot" of David Wilcock, Dr Bill Deagle, Bob Dean, Aaron McCollum, and a few interesting additional videos...
