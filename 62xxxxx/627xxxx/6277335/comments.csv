Waiting for it!"
[T],ILPruny,2011-03-28T13:57Z,How about you get that directly from source. See bobrelease on google.
,skillet92,2011-03-28T18:14Z,"direct downloads are too tough for me to download!
So pls!"

[T],ILPruny,2011-04-01T17:19Z,"Are you Retarded, dont you see the title, i dont claim this to be my encode. read the nfo idiot."
[T],ILPruny,2011-04-01T19:48Z,"Shame on me for uploading 160gigs on this, why the hell do i bother."

,dnbkid303,2011-04-12T02:16Z,"Then maybe you should think before you post man... I know it can be hard to contain negativity from spewing out of your ass, hell once I told my kid to stop making weird faces at the table, turns out he was choking on a piece of chicken... But seriously if someone is using their expensive ass bandwidth to give you something for FREE, Wow... I am literally speechless at how inconsiderate and selfish some people can be."
,dnbkid303,2011-04-12T02:18Z,"P.S. Thanks xvid-reenc, I will seed my ass off on this one... good upload dude!"

Jesus dude, chill out, I know it can be hard to contain negativity from spewing out of your ass, blah blah blah blah.....
They apologized for christ sake, what more do you want...."
,Life.D.Eath,2011-04-16T02:28Z,Thank you for this! A/V - 10!
,Tromper,2011-05-07T15:41Z,"A10/V10
Thanks for the up. I know it's not your fault that BoB put the subs or subliminal whatever in this but after finishing the third season I gotta say that the flashing subs at the bottom of the screen really are annoying. I tried to remove them but no can do with toolnix."
[T],ILPruny,2011-05-08T17:54Z,"THink a bit: Open files with VLC, right click,video,crop,1;85.
It's so HARD ?"
,Tromper,2011-05-10T00:01Z,Don't think there's any need to be so thin skinned and to take an attitude about this. Using VLC Player is OK if you are watching this on a PC but I like to watch on my TV. I use a flash drive and just plug into the TV. Can't eliminate the flashy subs that way and I can't take them out beforehand - just sayin' for others who might like to know.
[T],ILPruny,2011-05-10T18:10Z,"I must say i havent watched the show, someone asked me to upload this.
So fuck the motherfukin subs, not my encode dont care much, but if you realy want to get over the you can try some tricks, like puting a piece of thick paper or fabric covering the lower part of monitor.
:)"
,Tromper,2011-05-11T04:12Z,"Hmmm, won't discuss it any more. I'm certainly no match for that sharp intellect."
[V],mkvGOD,2011-05-12T11:32Z,"Better version here
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6383080

,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-13T01:08Z,There are no hard-coded subs in these. This is a perfect upload.
,salitrov,2011-05-13T08:56Z,"Great torrent, thanks!"

,hakuna_matata,2011-08-15T15:02Z,"Better Quality and Half the Size of the stupid 350mb episodes. . but why some stupid 7 people clicked minus.. must be jealous eztv lol.

Thanks for the BoB rips.. these must be good."
,walwolf,2011-09-09T00:59Z,why is this download so slow?
,holyfool,2011-09-12T18:48Z,madly thanx
,magi123,2011-10-27T12:39Z,"thank you, great job considering the file size"

,Phntzm79,2012-01-10T07:26Z,"Great work, small excellent quality Matroska files.Phantazm79"
,AmySand.A,2012-01-20T21:12Z,Thanks! Great quality for such a small size.
,snakeFisher,2012-03-24T05:54Z,"It's a BluRay rip, but its simply very good standard quality as it says in the name. A9 V9, the standard of video I'd download.

However, at the beginning of each episode is that tiny hardcoded subtitle saying the ripper and such, and it's driving me insane. I'm afraid I'll have to redownload if there's no way to get rid of that."
,cad23,2012-05-04T00:23Z,"a/9 v/9
thanks to the ripper for your time.
I agree with SnakeFisher though. Hard coded name of ripper and tiny flashes of subtitles in season 3 make this rip too annoying to watch.
I'll have to re-download a better rip."
[T],bzingaz,2012-05-08T05:22Z,thanks buddy..+1
