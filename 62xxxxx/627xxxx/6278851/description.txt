Author: Jen Kramer
In Joomla! 1.6: Creating and Editing Custom Templates, Jen Kramer
shows web designers how to create eye-popping web sites with
Joomla! templates and CSS. The course starts with the basics: how
to add the Joomla! template codes to a static HTML layout, install
the template package, and clean up styling after installation. The
course also covers advanced styling techniques, such as creating
multiple layouts within the same Joomla! template, configuring
menus and submenus, and implementing template overrides and template
styles. Exercise files accompany the course

Topics include:

* Preparing an HTML comp for conversion to Joomla!
* Converting from the index.html file to index.php
* Installing the template package file
* Downloading and installing tools
* Styling active links, navigation, sidebars, and more
