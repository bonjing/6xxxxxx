,hack0o7,2011-03-30T17:13Z,thank you very much dollar. been waiting for this one. respect from all the senna fans. 
,lexxxicide,2011-03-30T21:46Z,This film is supposed to be largely English is it not? Have you just got a hold of the Portuguese version? I'd like to know before I download.
,lexxxicide,2011-03-30T21:51Z,"I've just checked Amazon and other websites, Senna hasn't been released on DVD yet. If this is mostly in Portuguese (the film is listed as English language everywhere) and the DVD isn't out then I somehow don't think it's the correct film, or certainly not the version intended for release in English speaking countries."
,vladislaav,2011-03-31T01:37Z,thanks for the subs…great movie…
,lexxxicide,2011-03-31T02:11Z,I retract my previous comments. Good effort Dollar! =]

,Pedronqr,2011-04-04T02:54Z,"Thanks Dollar... one question, is this the same version with the director's commentaries?... that version is annoying because you can't listen to the original sound... thanks in advance"
,yakkabooty,2011-04-05T09:42Z,"Thanks heaps for this dollar, been waiting for this for a while now, i hope it has english subs as the link to them doesnt work,  will seed when done."

,killem2,2011-04-07T01:15Z,And I will seed after I verify. 
,killem2,2011-04-07T03:57Z,NOT IN ENGLISH. SENNA SPEAKS IN ENGLISH SOME TIMES BUT ANYTHING ELSE HAS TO BE SUB TITLED. NO NARRATION IN ENGLISH. WAIT FOR UK VERSION IMO.
,sedned,2011-04-07T12:31Z,"Great rip. Thanks!

You're gonna need subs for this (the ones included are, funnily enough, in Portuguese). Here are the English subs:

Keep seeding! Keep smiling."
,reelsplice,2011-04-07T20:44Z,Sub links are dead :-(
,reelsplice,2011-04-07T22:58Z,Do not bother with this if you cant speak Portuguese. I couldn't find any decent subs. Rubbish.
,rcsh,2011-04-12T15:57Z,Is this the 104 mins version?

The included subtitles were NOT good. They were okay in some parts but then they were just completely nonsensical in some parts. (They used the word ""coat"" for crash"" and often referred to ""him"" as ""her"". A lot of the English translations are jumbled, too. What's the point of translating English speaking voices to text anyway?) The ones that Kudremukh posted are even worse, as they're not even in English at all.

I guess you can stumble through it, but it's not ideal. Great documentary though."
,harvey_weinstein,2011-08-20T06:19Z,"Also, to confirm, yes this is the 105 minute (supposedly better) version.

The subs that sedned and micha posted are exactly the same and are not synched up to the video at all. I'm not sure how far off they are but it was more than I could gauge from a quick viewing. The best thing to do if you are going to download this version of the rip, is to just use the titles that are provided. They will get you through it 90%."
,KizzaTheOne,2011-08-25T06:57Z,"Great Doco! Thanks for the upload mate!
If anyone is struggling with subs; http://www.sub-titles.net/en/ppodnapisi/podnapis/i/1148530/senna-2010-subtitles
they work on vlc fine. if the link doesnt work try a google search, i found them in 30 seconds!"
,KizzaTheOne,2011-08-25T07:01Z,"actually, never mind, the subs i posted before are a bit out of sync >:("
,tpb4ever1,2012-02-10T03:46Z,Great documantry and great brazilian Racer. I'm gonna download and seed this one. Thanks.
,mojowoikin,2012-03-13T01:27Z,"Thanks for taking the time to up this dollar! A really good documentary. I enjoyed it even knowing nothing about Formula 1 beforehand.

Of the subs listed, several are in sync but none offered really good English syntax  interpretations, but it was enough to understand from the context. The sub file I used was www.AllSubs.org_senna-2010-dual-audio-3_26815.zip from the allsubs site.  As others have mentioned the doc is not entirely in Portuguese. Some Senna interviews are in English.
