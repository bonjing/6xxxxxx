 The geologist examines the causes of the natural disaster, following its      
 progress from beneath the Pacific Ocean to the Japanese mainland and          
 explaining how a rare combination of conditions caused both an earthquake and 
 a tsunami. He also discusses the current state of earthquake science, and     
 investigates why millions of people around the world continue to live in areas
 of seismic activity
