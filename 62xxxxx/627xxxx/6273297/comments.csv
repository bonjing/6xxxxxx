but from the picture, i thought this was the stereoscopic 3d version of avatar, as the picture stated, no where on your description did you state this as red and blue, i needed a smaller more compressed version of the 3d bluray for my samsung 3d tv, and my internet is only 24gb a month, so now ive got a useless video, sitting on my computer, that used up a HUGE chunk of my downloads per month, this torrent, is misguiding to say the least, why would you put that picture thats the stereo scopic 3d, i would suggest highly that you post that this is red and blue, im searching for like a 3 - 4gb of the compresed version top and bottom/left and right of the 3d blu ray, that i can watch, please help, and make sure it is what im looking for, that would make me respect you again, but i cant get my 3 gb of downloads back, i tryed watching it at 70% and was like, ohno.

so please tell me how, or upload a compresed version of top/bottom or side by side version of avatar 3d stereoscopic about 3-4 gb thnxs :)"
