Yudham Sei review


Yudham Sei is a crime thriller film directed by Myshkin. The film stars director Cheran in the lead role along with debutant Dipa Shah. Y. Gee. Mahendra, Lakshmi Ramakrishnan, Jayaprakash, Marimuthu, Yugendran and Shruthi play supporting roles in the film.

Yuddham Sei tells an investigative story and Cheran plays the role of a CBI officer in the film. He is in charge of investigating some serial killings and is in search of the killer. Dipa Shah plays his assistant in the film.

All of Myshkin\'s films have a trademark \'kuthu\' song and Yudham Sei is no exception. The \'kuthu\' song of Yuddham Sei features director Ameer, Neetu Chandra and writer Charu Nivedita dancing for the tunes. Interestingly the lady in the song Neethu Chandra will also be seen in yellow sari as Malavika and Snigdha in Chithiram Pesuthadi and Anjathey respectively.

Yudham Sei is produced by Kalpathi S Aghoram under the banner of AGS Entertainment. Myshkin who introduced Sundar C Babu in Anjathey is introducing another music director Krishna Kumar with â€˜Yudham Sei. Krishna Kumar has changed his name to \'Ke\' for films. Sathya is handling the camera.
