,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-26T15:57Z,"@shailesh417
When YOU--through much dilligence and patience--become the one encoding ~100MB episodes that everybody else encodes at ~175MB, and then uploads and seeds them without cost or obligation to anybody that wants to snag them, then YOU TOO can be, and moreover, will have earned the RIGHT TO BE, an ""arrogant bastard"".  Until that time, how about ""an attitude of gratitude""?"
,abj642,2011-03-26T16:18Z,"@20-40
you should not have uploaded godzilla for that idiot...
they dont know the meaning of gratitude....

@shailesh417
thanks for letting us know that the uploader is a waste... you are the second one in last few days who has enlightened us.... how about returning godzilla back u idiot??."
,Ataractic,2011-03-26T19:48Z,@shailesh417: do you have an twin who thinks like you too? or are you logging in again and again to click on '-'?
