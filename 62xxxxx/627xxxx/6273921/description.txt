Pirate Bay needed a good clean High Quality DOTN torrent, and this is it, I ripped to albums my self, and the 3rd I encoded from flac. And, as always from me, 100% complete ID3's and 500x500 art.

Torrent contains the three studio releases (so Far), 4th is slated for who knows when.

1. I (Yellow)
2. II (Green)
3. III (Red)

4. (Green) Bonus Disc

5. The Down Town [Single]

6. B-Sides*

*Note, I think the B-sides is an unofficial compilation, they pretty much all appeared on some release or another, mostly soundtracks. Plus 1 live performance of "Freak" at some acoustic show before he created Days Of The New.

Enjoy!

And please help seed, torrentas in general are lacking a good strong, high quality DOTN torrent.
