Soundgardenâ€™s new old live album â€œLive on I5â€ is an interesting time capsule of music from fifteen years ago.

The compilation is born again from long discarded two-inch reels recorded in 1996 while Soundgarden made a short run of the West coast, roughly concurrent with the release of their (current) swan song, â€œDown on the Upside.â€ The tapes were originally intended to be released as a live album back then, but with the bandâ€™s dispersal on April 9th, 1997 (a dark day in the memory of almost 14 year old M. Drew, to be sure,) the tapes sat gathering dust in the closets of Studio X (now Bad Animals) in Seattle. Now released in their retro glory as we near twenty years since the breakthrough dawn of grunge, the tracks are best viewed through the lens of your mindset in 1996. So travel back with meâ€¦to a time when David Duchovny was the hottest name working in Hollywood. Michael Jordan was just about to embark on his second three-peat. Eve 6 wouldnâ€™t score a single with â€œInside Outâ€ for another two years, leading to that event sometimes being referred to in music circles as â€œThe Beginning of the End.â€

The song selection for â€œLive on I5,â€ particularly when viewed as a reflection of the â€œDown on the Upsideâ€ tour, is both good and bad. While there are many album cuts that radio-only Soundgarden fans wouldnâ€™t know (a messy, colored-outside-the-lines â€œSearching With My Good Eye Closedâ€ for one,) there is also a distinct lack of material from Soundgardenâ€™s early years. â€œScreaming Life,â€ the bandâ€™s heady debut EP, makes an appearance with the familiar and welcome slogging of â€œNothing to Say,â€ but â€œFopp,â€ â€œUltramega OKâ€ and â€œLouder than Loveâ€ are all completely absent. On the other end of the spectrum, itâ€™s worth nothing that Grammy-nominated â€œPretty Nooseâ€ is also not present on â€œLive on I5.â€

So what does that leave? What it leaves is throaty, powerful versions of songs from the back half of Soundgardenâ€™s catalogue, with a couple covers tossed in for good measure.

Chris Cornell, without the benefit of Pro Tools or Cool Edit or SAW (or whatever the Pentium 1 1996 equivalent of those was,) to enhance and refine his vocals is a very different singer. He still possesses all the raw power that is so memorable and iconic, but the sustained wails are replaced with choppy, bitten off notes. This entire experience sounds exactly like what the band would have been if not for A&Mâ€™s backing and the â€œBadmotorfingerâ€-and-beyond huge budget. For fans of the first half of Soundgardenâ€™s legacy, this is a nice added perk, to hear what the hits would have sounded like on Sub Pop or SST. Listeners who know â€œBlack Hole Sunâ€ as the bandâ€™s signature song may find the change distasteful at first, but they might eventually think it a nice surprise to see the music they know played with reckless abandon and sung with unadulterated grit.

The other departure that makes this live effort separate from the studio records is the ubiquitous presence of Ben Shepherdâ€™s bass. No grunge band, save maybe the Melvins (and Buzz Osborne dislikes that label,) possessed a prevalent bass idiom. Yet here, Shepherd is practically forefront in the mix, aurally jacked to the nines for projection to a crowd. The end result has a more pronounced backbone, particularly during the extended and wandering solo of â€œSlaves and Bulldozers,â€ or the quick and dirty cover of the Stoogesâ€™ â€œSearch and Destroy.â€

The albumâ€™s best turn comes right in the middle, as their cover of the Beatlesâ€™ â€œHelter Skelterâ€ dovetails through similar chords into the somber, affecting â€œBoot Camp.â€ The actual cover of â€œHelter Skelterâ€ is average, as the band detunes the piece and wears away the sharp edges, but the way it changes to the suddenly similarly paced and equally morose â€œBoot Campâ€ is sublime.

Also of particular note is â€œRusty Cage,â€ which Cornell dedicates to â€œthe Man in Black;â€ Johnny Cash having covered it for his album that same year. The songâ€™s normally ferocious first half is played with a blistering extra half-step of speed, not settling down until the song crashes into the doom-laden outro.

â€œFell on Black Daysâ€ is executed with the necessary determined solemnity, a striking performance of what on record had always been an understated (and overplayed) song. Similarly, Soundgarden injects some creativity into super-single â€œBlack Hole Sun,â€ playing it without percussion. The song ends up being much more haunting without the expected punctuation of cymbal and drum.

Lastly, â€œLive on I5â€ might feature the be-all-end-all performance of â€œJesus Christ Pose.â€ The song has long been a favorite of dedicated Soundgarden connoisseurs, and the band doesnâ€™t disappoint with this authoritative, pummeling version.

Itâ€™s not all roses and cherries for â€œLive on I5.â€ Most of the songs from â€œDown on the Upsideâ€ are well played but feel more detached. â€œBurden in My Handâ€ is a nice cut, but somewhat sterile, â€œDustyâ€ is run of the mill and â€œTy Cobbâ€ doesnâ€™t offer anything the album version didnâ€™t. â€œHead Downâ€ has never been the best showcase for Soundgardenâ€™s ability, and could easily have been supplanted by â€œGunâ€ or â€œSmokestack Lightning.â€ â€œSlaves and Bulldozersâ€ has always been a brilliant piece, and musically still stands out on â€œLive on I5,â€ but Cornellâ€™s production-less vocals canâ€™t quite crank that song like it exists on â€œBadmotorfinger.â€

With all the rumors surfacing and in turn being buried about what Soundgarden might or might not be doing during this reunion, anything that can be proven in solid fact is worth exploring. â€œLive on I5â€ absolutely launches on March 22nd, and for fans new and old is a worthwhile addition to their collection. It is a portrait of one of the greatest bands in American music during the last twenty years, and was taken during the near apex of their dominion. Fans shouldnâ€™t miss this, and those who are too young to remember would be well served to start here.
