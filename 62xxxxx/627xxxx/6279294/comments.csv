,dashivasss,2011-03-29T18:54Z,"Another fuckin' spectacular SG-Universe episode.

They are unbelievably stupid for cancelling this masterpiece; its potential is phenomenal.

Enough character development in it yet? OMG "
,shayweis,2011-03-29T19:25Z,"Seriously how could they have canceled this show? has anyone in the sci fi network took the time to watch it? if this episode doesnt make them see what a jewel they got in their hands, then they really deserve to die in pain!"
,pimpmobile,2011-03-29T21:28Z,"You people are crazy for liking this piece of shit all it is, is a soap opera for nerds who can't get laid!  The only stargates worth mentioning is SG1 and Atlantis!   "
,kumorilastangel,2011-03-29T22:00Z,Thanks for the upload. I really hope they don't let the show die...at the very least I hope they go out swinging.

,spyvision360,2011-03-29T22:37Z,"Thanks EZ :)  i missed this last night i was thinking it was on tonight...you rock.... I have to agree with shayweis & dashivasss  this show was awesome a little darker than the other stargates but that made it great, they weren't trying to copy the others they took it to a whole new level...the story line was endless.. but thanks to the simple minded fans they shit canned the franchise..... thanks you people suck  "
,Shaktipat,2011-03-29T23:30Z,"-I agree with those who say that it`s sad that Stargate is taken of; Although I have to say that the show was actually not that good before they started loosing viewers, and getting more and more bad reviews: They were simply not true to the Stargate realm, and original series: They made a very hostile environement, very unfriendly, and with very little humor, and very little exploration. The ""boxed it down"", and made it to more of a soap opera, with a lot of intrigues in the team. -After they started getting bad reviews and ratings, they`ve changed it for the better.. but to late. And by starting of as bad as they did; they`ve probably killed the possibility for a new Stargate Atlantis movie.. witch is very very sad! 
The way the show has improved now, I would also hope that it continued: But, let`s be hones: They really blew it from the beginning.
-I think that if they tweaked it more towards the original ""spirit"" of the Stargate realm: Possibly by starting to explore more and more planets, with more and more encounters.. and if they made the team more solid, and friendly... and more humorous... they would have succeded in getting more and more viewers... it would not be to late.. but the people in charge does not agree. Sad story, really. 
Thanks for the upload, by the way.. and thanks for all the seedings... :)"

,nightprowler.,2011-04-02T00:12Z,"It's unfortunate that this show is getting cancelled because die hards can't look past the campy corny mostly stand alone episodes of previous series.  

SGU is a good show in its own right.  It doesn't need to be exactly like the others.  Evolve people!

Yes it has story, yes it has lots of character development, yes it has love triangles and evokes feelings.  Does this make it a ""soap opera""?  Not in my opinion.

This show had so much potential and now they have to cram in a bunch of stuff in half a season just to wrap it up.

SGU is like a whole series of Stargate Atlantis - Vegas which is one of my, if not my most favourite SGA episode.

If you don't want story go back to watching YTV and Treehouse."
