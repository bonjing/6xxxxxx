A mysterious alien duo has swept through the galaxy, fiendishly snatching
entire chunks from the worlds of Ratchet, Jak and Sly to create a mysterious
new planet in the galaxy. After being abducted to this new world, Ratchet,
Clank, Jak, Daxter, Sly Cooper and Bentley are invited by their gracious
alien hosts to compete in friendly, yet challenging competition to test
