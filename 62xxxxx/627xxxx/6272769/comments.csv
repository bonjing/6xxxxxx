:D"
,Josha5000,2011-03-26T14:31Z,"of course it works

that's why he uploaded it 2 times with different sizes

this smells like a FAKE so hard ;)"
,TheJepo007,2011-03-26T15:16Z,"@Josha5000

I tried to play with only this one extracted, got extreme graphics etc but with a new problem, mouse look stuck looking left so it was unplayable.. After I extracted the another one it was fine so I decided to upload both of them.

So I'm actually not sure if you need this one at all or just the smaller one, but just to be sure I extracted both of them. :]"

Yes you are a spammer, i've seen your comment in every crysis 2 torrent and the funny thing is, they all include a crack so please go and cut off your dick your piece of shit."

Is there an activation code for the crysis 2 download? I patched it with the launcher but it says need serial number..? can u help plz"
,TheJepo007,2011-03-29T21:57Z,"@ghbub5

There is no need for activation code, if you can't get it work with this, download and apply my other torrent and you should be fine."

Downloaded this torrent of yours, extracted the folders and put them in the install folder (hope that was the right way) and now the game is overall slower and I cant seem to get the console to open...

Any advice? Thnx in advance"
,Kratzen,2011-03-30T21:32Z,"This torrent sucks! I downloaded it and installed it in my FLT crack, and now it laggs like shit!"
,TheJepo007,2011-03-30T22:52Z,"@Marcvss and Kratzen

Have you tried downloading and applying my other torrent? If you have and it didn't help, try reinstalling the game without applying FLT crack.

However if that doesn't help, I'm afraid I can't either since I haven't had any lag issues :/"
,Marcvss,2011-04-01T02:10Z,"@TheJepo007

Tried using your other patch... same issue.

As you suggested, reinstalled without applying FLT and your patch, still same shit.

Reinstalled, using FLT and different patch... Succes!!!! Game runs perfect again.

So in the latter of it all, thnx for the time put in but your patch is a bit crap.

,qhdsagjuj,2011-04-01T15:27Z,"I found out this game forces you into updates so delete all of the contents of C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts/Crytek/Crysis 2/bin32/EAcore. After you do this there no longer will be any more forced update. When you start the game it takes a bit longer, but it still loads! Just leave the EAcore folder there empty! "
,Darkforge317,2011-04-03T04:18Z,"*Cough* Mind telling me the serial number please?
This window named ""Product Activation"" opens up as soon as I try to enter the game and it says ""Please enter the serial number that you recieved with Crysis 2."" Mind helping us all out with the Jepo? Please? I tried to put nothing and then click next, nothing happened, I tried entering xxxxxxxxxxxx and nothing happened, I tried to enter a random code and nothing happened. HELP PLEASE!"
,Darkforge317,2011-04-03T04:22Z," It asks me for a serial number... please help? I tried entering xxxxx, nope, I tried entering nothing, nope, tried entering a random code...nope! HELP ME PLEASE! The window named ""Product Activation"" opens up as soon as I start the game! It says ""Please enter the serial number that you received with Crysis 2.""  Help PLEASE!"
