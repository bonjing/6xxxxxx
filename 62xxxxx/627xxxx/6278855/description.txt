New York fashion model Alison Parker and her attorney 
boyfriend Michael Lerman are young lovers in New York City 
seeking to settle down. However, the reluctant, independent 
Parker wants her own apartment, and she eventually settles 
on a building inhabited by a surreal cast of characters, 
most notably a blind priest who stares at her from the 
building's top floor. 

Parker begins experiencing neck pains 
and insomnia and has flashbacks of her suicide attempts and 
recently deceased father, whose strange behavior a few years 
back prompted her depression. However, her father is not 
exactly dead, and when other odd tenants surface, Parker soon 
realizes this apartment is not exactly normal. Trouble erupts 
when Parker and Lerman begin to investigate the building's 
quirky inhabitants. When the dust settles, Parker becomes a 
permanent resident of the building, but not the kind she thought.
