I also have this box set but I just wanted to clarify that where you have ""1976 - High Voltage"" should read ""1975 - T.N.T"". Well that's what it is on their Australian version. Makes more sense than having the same album title released twice two years apart.

This boxset also includes a rare 12"" single called ""Cold Hearted Man"" which is not released in any other way."

For FLAC, I have recently feel in love with foobar2000. Not a pretty player, but pretty on the ears big time.
