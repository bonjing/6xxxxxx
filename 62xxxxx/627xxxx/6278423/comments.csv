,crossfire6,2011-04-02T22:04Z,"Can this be installed?  Or, is this designed to work from boot, only?
Sorry if a stupid question...but the 2010 pro version could be installed, where this one does not seem to do that."
,crossfire6,2011-04-02T22:17Z,"Never mind that last question.  ""CD based""...duhhh
I am a dumbass....
Thanks for the up!"
,kabutoTPB,2011-04-05T00:07Z,"ohh yeah...this one is good!!!
thanks a lot!"
,biccaas4,2011-06-07T02:58Z,sorry but can some please tell me how to get this to work? i tried to mount the downloaded file.. but that doesnt seem to work.....
,cybergeeek,2011-06-13T18:21Z,"nikita, plz tell me how to use this after mounting....i can see ""bootsect.exe"" n other related folders...plz guide me"
,StellaMan,2011-07-09T18:43Z,"Got to ask the same question as crossfire6, biccaas4 & cybergeeek ... The instructions say ""Unpack, burn or mount, enjoy..."" ... once unpacked, if I Mount the image there is no obvious Executable there & if I Burn to a CD it's not Bootable so I have the same problem !!! 

Surely it's not difficult, after going to all this trouble to upload it and supply it to us, to put a clear explanation of what to do ?!?!?"
,oifwolf,2011-07-15T23:56Z,"Same problem as the rest.
I have paragon drive copy - windows based.
      As far as this i dont know.
web site shows a vid about Hard Disk Manager as of this posting looks win based. so that answers some questions some of you guys asked.
       google is your friend

,adobay,2012-01-19T12:00Z,"Still same problem...
I do not find the .MSI file the product manual talks about for the installation.

And yes, tryed Google, but no luck.
Any help to get this installed? Thx."
,mohit11,2012-02-14T12:42Z,"easy to burn...
1. just unzip with winrar...
2. Look for ""rg-211hm.cue""
3. open that file with nero... nd bingo"
