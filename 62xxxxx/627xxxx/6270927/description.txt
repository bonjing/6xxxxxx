                The Dress.
                A new six-part comedy written and produced by Robert
                Popper, starring Tamsin Greig, Paul Ritter, Simon
                Bird and comedy newcomer Tom Rosenthal, plus special
                guest star Mark Heap. In this episode Mum goes mad
                when she finds out that Dad didn't throw away his old
                boxes of science magazines in their clear-out. So Dad
                builds a bonfire and promises he'll burn them all.
                But Dad is only pretending to burn them, instead
                squirrelling the boxes off to his shed in the garden.
