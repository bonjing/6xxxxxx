,nittany,2011-03-26T06:27Z,"What does ""RC"" mean that is in the torrent name and the info above says ""Bluray Disc RC""?'

I'm guessing it stands for Release Candidate  or Region Coded or something like that? 

Why is it important?  Does it mean this movie will be different somehow?

,karakorama,2011-03-26T22:35Z,Many thanks
,DJAbi7,2011-03-26T22:37Z,"Hi guys

There are a lot of seeders, but it only has a speed of 10kbps!! Come on guys, seed to the others!

Thanks a lot !"
,karakorama,2011-03-27T00:04Z,"Sorry, but why this have 1:85 aspect ratio?. On IMDB the aspect ratio of The Mechanic is 2.35 : 1.  Is this really from a Blu ray?, why not the original aspect ratio?."
,mat459,2011-03-27T00:32Z,"I have to wonder about the source too. The picture quality is good, but there is noise in the audio. And check out the scene at about 1:14:30. There is definatly a boom mic in the top center of the screen a couple of times. Still a great DL, but really curious about the source."
,spOOnPT,2011-03-27T05:04Z,Not from disc. Quality isn't BRRip and u can see CAMERA moving in some sequence parts!

@nittany RC probably stands for ""Really Crappy"""
,carma.cop,2011-03-27T17:16Z,"lack of quality v:3

,vctrt1,2011-03-27T21:39Z,"This is not BRRIP, probbaly HD cam. 
Video is sharp but colors are distorted with too much of yellow and green tones. 
Audio is very bad with a lot of noise, clearly mic audio.

,JozeTolas,2011-03-29T01:14Z,This version is really amazing!!! It seams like a non edited version of the film!!! There are some parts where we can see the multi directional mic of the movie LOL.... i think the guy that carries the mic its the principal actor from the movie LOL
,JozeTolas,2011-03-29T01:31Z,"Look the errors:

,Marco2112,2011-03-29T05:53Z,The acting in this movie is so bad that the story is impossible to follow.

It was definitely not a finished copy. The mic shots were funny. But, it was great quality video and the dvd isn't even out yet so 2 thumbs up! Thanks."
,-Cortex-,2011-04-07T18:17Z,"Jesus Christ some people are retarded. If you don't know what 'RC' means, freakin' google it ('RC bluray rip' would do), it's not that difficult.

Anywho, region C (most of Asia) is equal to region 5. Hence the dodgy AR (just like The American) and crappy editing."
,scylla91,2011-04-10T01:06Z,"Apart from the microphones that look every ten minutes, the quality is excellent, thank you!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-04-14T04:04Z,"@for noobs:

If the Info says that was ripped from a Blu-Ray Disc RC = Region C....than so it is !!!


Blu-ray Discs use a much simpler region-code system than DVD with only 3 regions, labeled A, B, and C.

- Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus the Republic of China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan and Korea.

- Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.

- Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as the People's Republic of China and Russia.

V:7

The quality overall is absolutely not worth calling 720p imo, but ok the video is okay, the audio on the other hand is terrible. It's de-synced out of this world"
