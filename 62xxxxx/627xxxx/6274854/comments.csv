However, I notice that the running time of this torrent is approx. 1 hour and 58 minutes. The official running time listed for theaters is 2 hours and 4 minutes(124 minutes). That's a 6 minute difference. But there is nothing missing from this version(no shortened or cut scenes, etc.), correct? If someone can let me know for sure, I'd greatly appreciate it. And thanks for the great quality download. A/10, V/10"
