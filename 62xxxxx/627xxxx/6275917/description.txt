Product Description
In this book John Bird and Carl Ross introduce mechanical principles and technology through examples and applications - enabling students to develop a sound understanding of the principles needed by professional engineers and technicians. No previous background in engineering is assumed and theoretical concepts are supported by over 600 problems and worked examples.

This completely new text is designed to match a wide range of pre-degree courses, and provide an accessible introduction for undergraduates with no previous background in engineering studies.

The authors have ensured syllabus-match for the leading UK courses at this level: AVCE optional units Mechanical Engineering Principles and Further Mechanical Engineering Principles, and the new BTEC National unit: Mechanical Principles.

A student-friendly introduction to core engineering topics which does not assume any background in engineering studies

A brand new text matched to the latest syllabus requirements
