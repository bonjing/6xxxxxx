>File 4 = "Noraa, Behind You! " -
This EVP is classic, at work we had a joke going where we called each other by our names -
BUT spelled backwards.. Aaron = Noraa.
I never even discussed this workplace joke with my family so I was the only one to even pick up on this one..
Noraa, Behind You (or Im behind you) this evp was a response to me asking them to repeat what I thought I heard,
they repeated it louder and clearer than I could have ever imagined. "Noraa, Behind You" is @ 2sec.
