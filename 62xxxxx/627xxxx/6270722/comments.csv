So far i have been unsuccesful
,nikoHD,2011-03-26T04:49Z,Hey 20/40 just wanted to stop by and say thanks for all the movies and shows! really appreciate your work man. when you start accepting requests again could you upload American idol Season 1?
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T07:25Z,"Thanks.

@nikoHD: Sorry, but maybe you can find Boxset of DVD disks ""Best of seasons 1-4"" somewhere. I vaguely remember seeing one long time ago."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T07:32Z,"@sharan007: Strange how some Latino uploader haven't made torrent. Maybe because rip is really ugly, almost unwatchable. Movie is interesting enough for some encoder to make nice rip too.  "
