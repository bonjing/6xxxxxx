Freedon to Love

Applying the Theology of the Body to Life and Relationships

Drawing on Pope John Paul II's Theology of the Body, author and speaker Christopher West shares God's original plan for marriage and sexuality and how an understanding of this plan gives us "the freedom to love."

The Theology of the Body has been called "one of the boldest reconfiguration of Catholic theology in centuries," according to George Weigel, the pope's offical biographer. It addresses some of the most fundamental and important questions of human existence, including:

     *Why were we created male and female?

     *Where do we com from and why?

     *What is the meaning of life? How do we experience it?

     *Why is there evil in the world and how do we overcome it?
