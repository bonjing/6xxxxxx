Los Crudos  
 
Wikipedia says:  
"Los Crudos was an American hardcore punk band from Chicago, Illinois that existed from 1991 to 1998.[1] The band played in the hardcore punk style,[2][3] and were a popular act within the DIY underground of the 1990s. Being Latino, they paved the way for later Spanish-speaking punk bands[2] and helped to increase the presence of Latinos in the predominantly white punk subculture.[4] They have been described as "one of '90s punk's truly great bands"[5] and "one of the greatest hardcore bands...ever.""
