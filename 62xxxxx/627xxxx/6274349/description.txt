The difference with most other All-In-One versions, is that this version
also has a 64-bits Recovery Mode, for system recovery. Other All-In-One
versions are often (read: almost all) based on the 32-bits version, which
makes it unable to use the Recovery Mode if you're on a 64-bits OS.

For a clean install: boot from ISO and just let the bootmenu timer pass
(10 sec.). Setup will be started and you can also launch the Recovery Mode for
a 32-bits OS from there. If you use a 64-bits OS, in the bootmenu choose
"x64 Recovery Mode" (don't use this for installation!).
Also with this version it's possible to upgrade from as well a 32-bits OS,
as a 64-bits OS. Depending on the type of OS you use, the correct setup
will automatically be started.
Tested upgrade from Vista SP2 32-bits and 64-bits -> OK.
NOTE: the "setup64.exe" is not signed, this is correct!

Apart from combining the editions and above described elements, there
are no modifications. All material is from the original MS ISOs
(so not activated!). Activation can be done using a OEM or Retail productkey
(except Enterprise editions). After a clean install or an upgrade, all
installed files on the disk where Windows is installed are 100% original
and untouched.
