Republicans have destroyed our economy, attacked every brown person they thought they could get away with, and lied every time they opened their filthy mouths.

This is Fox News ""history"", which means it's not worth the time of anybody with a mind.

,xelcho,2011-04-13T02:29Z,"The opening of Wikipedia really kinda sums it up:

A Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror is a 2004 book on American history by Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen. Written from a conservative standpoint, it is a counterpoint to Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States and asserts that the United States is an ""overwhelmingly positive"" force for good in the world.

If one take a moment to review the impetuous, Howard Zinn's ""A people's history of the US"".  It is crystal clear that Zinn wrote this book based upon the failure, not the standard, to write from the view point of the victims, or the looser's story. The assertion of this new book seems to be more or less a return to normality than a consideration of was it right?, just because you can does it mean you should?  or even more interesting, who were the beneficiaries of the any of these actions?

Seems to be more the noble hyperbole surrounding the wonderful intentions of plans that go bad or good, but no attention to who actually profitted."
