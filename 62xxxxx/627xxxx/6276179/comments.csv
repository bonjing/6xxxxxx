,wordisbond,2011-08-11T06:57Z,"I feel like I am doing the world a service when I seed this torrent. If you listen carefully you can really learn a lot about life from these tapes, its like a crash course in psychology. Its sounds stupid coming from a comedy show but if you listen to these tapes it will make you a much wiser human being, adam and drew really put into perspective why people behave the way they do and interact with each other. although time has passed and i have grown older from when i had time to listen to these, ( i have probably listened to almost all of them )  I will always remember and look back fondly the times staying up all night playing minecraft or gmod and listening to these tapes. and with that i will keep seeding this until well after im dead (assuming my computer will keep running)"
,DRAKKID,2011-08-16T17:43Z,@Wordisbond i completely agree. as a teenager with a pretty much absent father these guys gave me the guidance i needed. i would not be the man i am today with out this show.

You know it's all made up right? The producers make the callers change their story to be more interesting. They even got busted live when a caller said, ""The guy told me to say I wanted to fuck my sister but my real problem is..."""

Actually you know your full of shit right? I have called their hotline many times before (back in 2003) and they took my call and the lady who accepts your calls did not tell me to say anything. They ask you what your calling about so they can see if it fits into the show or not."

That isn't true the producers don't tell the callers what to say. A lot of the calls are bullshit and that's half the fun of the show, a lot of classic moments are when adam and drew call them out on their bullshit. 

But the message doesn't come from the callers it comes from adam and drew. listen and you will know what im saying. "
