,SpF1nX,2011-03-26T10:36Z,"Originally yes, but i didnt mention about it since it's 
HDTV->DVD via SCART to void HDCP, 
so it is MPEG2 720 x 576, 25 fps AC3 Stereo 48Khz with highest DVDR Mode 
( 1Hour HQ  around 9Mbps ).

Around SD guality, and this time easieast / fastest way to bring it public.
I focus later on to straight HDTV with H.264 MKV.
