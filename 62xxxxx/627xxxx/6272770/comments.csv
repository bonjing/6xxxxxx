,xiIix,2011-03-26T14:08Z,"I would assume it fixes many problems, otherwise Crytek wouldn't have spent all of the money actually writing the code for the patch. One thing I do know that it's suppose to fix is the console not showing up when you hit the tilde key."

,Deadman17,2011-03-26T14:18Z,"as it seems it works i used a serial of my own and it says it is already in use so i will try again later with the same one and if i still can not join a game i will try another one 
thanks again extremezone you are the best"
,RMJ13,2011-03-26T14:20Z,"this patch BSOD my XP harddrive and erased my boot menu I had to swap it to my 7 harddrive to share my experence with this I will not try it again!

and just silly ? if 1234 or xoxo keys cannot be used how can only 2 keys work for many

 THIS MAKES NO SENCE!"
,xiIix,2011-03-26T14:28Z,"Great. I didn't ""install"" crysis, I simply extracted that piece of shit cloneDVD one and played it as is because it refuses to install or uninstall (lots of us are dealing with this issue). Fuckit. First Crysis was better anyway. I'll just download a different image of C2, and until then I'll play Crysis1. Or Warhead maybe.

Thank you for the upload though. I've noticed most of my shit comes from you."
,xiIix,2011-03-26T14:29Z,"By shit I mean stuff I've downloaded, not that your uploads are rubbish."
,xiIix,2011-03-26T14:32Z,"Good news for those of you who have the dame prb as me, the crack works even if you don't run the update itself. I just simply wanted the console back and it did that for me so I'm happy."

,ChiliNoMoreX,2011-03-26T15:31Z,"yes, MP works. but servers still a bit buggy, they crash a lot, hosts can't start the game.. 
but those problems are related to server administration and has nothing to do with the crack, with works perfectly well.."
,ChiliNoMoreX,2011-03-26T15:34Z,"and for those with ""strict firewall"" problem:
deactivate your firewall --

,Aerionix,2011-03-26T15:55Z,"Worked great, have only tried starting from instant game, but no problems there except for my apparent general suckage at the game.  And I guess there's no plausible way I can blame NoGrp or extremezone for that.  If I think of one, I'll be back.

,elitegamernl,2011-03-26T16:15Z,woooot thanks it works :D playing multiplayer 
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-03-26T16:19Z,"1. The cracked exe in this torrent is the same as the cracked exe that released by vovan31337. So in other words it should work. Thanks extremezone for uploading it. :)

2. For those that want the cracked exe only, you can download vovan31337's crack by crackmania ru

3. There is also another cracked exe by TRiViUM. You can get it from nodvd net

4. So we have two cracked files from p2p groups (or individuals), but zero cracks from scene groups.

Greets :)"
,zazally,2011-03-26T16:26Z,Thank you so much extremezone the other crack that was uploaded would not start with my logitech USB 7.1 dolby digital surround sound headset plugged in the only way I could play it with the other crack was if I unplugged my headset or removed my software drivers for my headset which I did not want to do that not saying the other crack was bad still respect the work you guys do so thank you so much to all that made this game possible I love it! :D

,elitegamernl,2011-03-26T18:48Z,"Shiftnoob

i think your doing it wrong :P
I'm playing mutiplayer since this crack was released and still not kicked yet so ... "
,Aerionix,2011-03-26T19:19Z,"the server kicks and other issues seem to be related to server-side problems, not due to anything wrong with this patch.  I had disconnects from a couple of servers during loading, tried a different server and worked fine.  Can now confirm that it is not necessary to use the ""instant"" game.  You can use the server browser and join a game just like any of those high falutin store bought copies.  Can't imagine this going unfixed for long tho, so enjoy while it lasts.  

Side note, are the rest of you having to input a cd key every time you get into the multiplayer menu?  It saves my user info, but have to put a random key in every time I start a new session.  Can live with it, but was curious."
,lhgsh,2011-03-26T20:13Z,"Ok, kids. The UPDATE itself (v 1.1 exe) contains a VERY harmful virus that made me reinstall my WHOLE system.
The crack, however works ok in multiplayer too.
Solution: Go and download official update from filefront and then apply this crack."
,tops.c,2011-03-26T20:53Z,"Dirty AVG deleted v1.0, I have been playing on EA servers for years there is cheat engines running right by PunkCluster but guessing a key/code that will work online is laughable, now there are side servers but EA is watching them you may get to play a little while.  "

,Dumbbanus,2011-03-26T21:35Z,Multiplayer works if you juin a quick match! And crytek thought they will deter people from torrenting by adding a major multiplayer component that can only be accessed with a legit version...haha not gonna happen!
,WydawMakah,2011-03-26T23:55Z,"The virus is inside the update.

It is a rootkit type of virus.

When you open the executable, your antivirus SHOULD warn you.

To avoid all this, simply open the update with 7zip and erase ""DLL.exe"", which is the virus itself."
,WydawMakah,2011-03-27T00:03Z,"Also, for some reason my game will crash before even starting...

Crysis2 stopped working...

And since the servers looks like crap (only empty and full games and few players) I won't buy the game.  Anyway, anybody else getting kicked with this crack?"
,Nitro2012,2011-03-27T03:00Z,"This works great !
No problem at all!

no crash or BSOD

and then you can play !!

Thanks ExtemeZone for this upload!"
,PGHammer,2011-03-27T06:39Z,"Since the update has issues, instead, let the *legit* 1.1 update (yes, it works with the FLT cracked version as well) apply, then, if you want MP, use the crack here - otherwise, use FLT's crack (both the crack only and the FLT release are at TPB).

A couple things worked for me during that time, and I still am currently able to play online with this as well. Make sure if you're using Peerblock that it is off. Second, I used a program recommended during the beta called TCP Optimizer (its free). That cleared up the login/constant disconnecting issues. I can confirm that this download WORKS for MP. However because of the ""virus"" outcry I decided to download the patch from filefront, and used the 1.0 and 1.1 exes in this download."

My neighbor downloaded the FLT version and his update goes fine but the crack does not work and crashes on start up. I tried for 2 hours today to help him....lol Then I said he should go buy a copy. I pre-ordered! lol

When I go back to the update and try again it says it's already installed. So do I install the update from the launcher or not? If not, how can I bypass it?

DO NOT STEAL THIS GAME. I'm a die-hard pirate myself but this title is just too... wrong. Crytek is extremely dedicated to PC gaming, they're one of the few big companies that make games exclusively for PC gamers. This title was on other platforms but everyone knows who it's meant for. DON'T MESS THIS UP! crysis 2 has been devastated, cracked before its release AND multiplayer cracked too? if this doesn't end now it may be the end of PC gaming as a whole. BUY THIS GAME!"

Any help would be appreciated. :)"
,Kossy077,2011-04-04T08:25Z,"@pclove Oh yeah, Crytek are just falling over themselves to support PC gaming - that's why they couldn't wait to jump ship with Crysis 2 and gave us a dumbed down console port. Yeah, my heart just bleeds for Crytek. 

I mean the fact that Crysis 1 wasn't the world beater they, somewhat arrogantly, expected it to be was down to PC gamers, with us all being pirates and all. It had nothing to do with the small issue of needing to buy a new PC to play the fucker."

btw fella its not curtain cd keys you use, you enter your own xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx "

Do NOT start the game with the launcher.

Go to BIN32 and start the game with Crysis2.exe

Create a path of it to your desktop or Games paste.

,Kossy077,2011-04-05T19:24Z,"@Rodan.H Sorry people - I think the crack I used is actually the same crack (v1.1).

It's not big deal to me that I haven't got 1500 servers.... why would you need that many anyway? I can still easily find a game and play just like before. The only thing I noticed was that I can't use game chat.  

Can't you find any games or something? what's the problem? "

Damn!"

,Kossy077,2011-04-06T21:26Z,"@LaneyEFC You don't understand mate, yeah these clever guys always update cracks for single player, but the fact that the multi-player player was cracked in the first place was extremely rare. It turns out it was due to a master activation key getting leaked from inside Crytek - the chances of that happening again are next to nil - so now that they have identified and changed the keys means it's over. Trust me, you want to play on-line buy the game - it's the only way."

what you dont understand tho mate is, i read that the people who cracked crysis 1.1 have the master activation key, and i read the master activation key of games cost alot of money plus could take up to a few months to re-build so in that case, id rather listen to other people than someone on PB, it wont bother me as much as ive got the actuall crysis 2 on ps3, but i enjoy playing it with keyboard and mouse reason for me havin it on pc."

I don't know what website you got your info from, but it may be right. I can't say for a 100% that a new multi-player crack won't come out, but it seems Crytek have identified the keys and managed to block them. So when you mention about it been expensive and time consuming to change the keys, I'm thinking well haven't Crytek done just that? Isn't that the reason we are all getting the ""Valid key required"" message? "

,Kossy077,2011-04-20T21:01Z,"@LaneyEFC I've been able to ""play"" it too after the fix - your comment was no big surprise - but why bother when you can only see about 17 full servers? most of which you can't even connect to. That's why I didn't even bother posting a comment here. So comparing that to what we had before, with hundreds of ranked servers that I could connect to at any time, I still call it over. I'm not interested in picking up scraps. 

But if you find something that works like it did before fix (same as if you'd brought the game) then  please let me know - I'll happily admit I was wrong and start playing again with a big smile on my face. "
