This cablegate-201103250553.7z file is 13.8 MB (14,564,958 bytes) in size, and expands to 546 MB (573,410,587 bytes), containing 8,417 files in 146 folders.


If you're seeding an older CableGate torrent, seed this instead.  The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html (or better yet http://wikileaks.ch/magnet.txt which is sometimes updated first).  The IP for this domain is 46.59.1.2 (now hosted in Sweden).

If you run a local WikiLeaks "pull" / "scrape" mirror (search P2P networks for "wikileaks scrape"), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or the 7z command on any UNIX-like operating system.

The bad guys can put up blocks to all known / major HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!
