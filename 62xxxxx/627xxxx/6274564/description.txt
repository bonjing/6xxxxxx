Hey all, this is a great show- if you like fullmetal alchemist, but want to know more about the backstory you should watch this. It is a remake of the series that stays more true to the original manga- it is a lot more fast paced, and more interesting.

I have been having a lot of trouble finding all of these episodes dubbed so I figured I would upload all of the ones I've gotten already. I made it a .7z so that people couldnt just snag an episode or two and leave- I hope it's not too much of an inconvenience.

If you don't know how to unpack a .7z just download 7zip from 7zip.org

Hope you all have a great one :)
