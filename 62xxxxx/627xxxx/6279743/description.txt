This file has been, for me, one of the holy grails of Funkadelic songs. This is the most famous song ever released by Funkadelic and ripped up the charts the year it came out. What is special about this file is that it is the almost impossible to find 11 minute 26 second Club(called Disco then) version of the song. As far as I can tell, this has never been released on CD. This rip comes from a mint condition 12\" vinyl release. This is an perfect addition for the other Parliament 12\" collection I added at: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6221354 (If you haven\'t downloaded it, why not?) But if you are like me and want to get more of what you are funkin\' for my fellow Funkateers you will have to have this file.(Funk use to be a bad word!!) It was done in .flac so you get every beautiful note! 

Enjoy and please, please, seed!

Stay tuned Funkateers, more to come!
