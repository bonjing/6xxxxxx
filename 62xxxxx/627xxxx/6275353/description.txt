While T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. may be a strange title, realize that it stands for "The Awesome Power of a Fully Operation Mothership." And realize also, that this is George Clinton and the P-Funk Allstars, who are anything but conventional.

And in that same vein, this is not your typical funk record. The Allstars supply molasses-smooth grooves for Clinton to croon over, which he does very well on tracks like "Underground Angel," the title track and "Fly Away."

There are also moments where this is an out-and-out party starter. "If Anybody Gets Funked Up (It's Gonna Be You)" kicks off the album in grand fashion with a nice groove, and the capper is a remix of the same song by P-Funk associate Colin Wolfe.

But there are those songs that lapse into a boring cadence and stay there. Tracks like "Flatman & Bobbin" and "Mathematics" are prime examples of filler rather than meat.

"T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M." is hit-or-miss a good portion of the time. There's nothing on here that is really truly BAD, but there are a few selections that are definitely less than good. All in all, however, this is a good record, and if you're a P-Funk fan, this is most definitely your LP.
