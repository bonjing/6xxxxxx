Also included are Stream and The Limbic System, but they are in a WMA protected format and the license has expired. I can't get them to play, so I wouldn't bother d/l them, but that's up to you. Gossip of the Neurons works fine.

If anybody knows how to play WMA protected files whose license has expired, please let me know, because I have a few files like this. Thanks.
