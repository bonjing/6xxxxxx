,skip741,2011-03-29T09:35Z,"1st of all Thankyou for sharing this game.I wanted to write acomment of how it plays.How can find the words to say how just plain bad the graphics And handling are? As i limp around the tracks rendered in glorious flintstones level quality in my ford focus,i am laughing at what the heck happened to the awesome quality vids i had seen previewing the game--how on earth did i end up with flinstones level graphics realism that looked like it was from a game 5 or more yrs old?grid absolutely slaughters this game as does dirt 2 and most shockingly  even the original shift game far surpases this one, they managed to make it Worse on all levels!NFS hot pursuit is Way more fun, better handling and superior in graphics both on cars and landscapes. im running it on a quadcore intel with 6 gigs ram and an 8800gt. all settings maxed,  at 1680x1050 with decent frame rates..maybe it will look better and be more fun with the hypercars unlocked and other tracks, but my 1st impressions were like :youve GOT to be Kidding me!:it just cant be This bad,im in driving hell...it didnt hold my interest for more than 20 mins.. feedback from others would be interesting"
