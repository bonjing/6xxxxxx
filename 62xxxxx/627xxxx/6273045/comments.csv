http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1224369/
I found only a cam, a 1080p and a 720p. Both blurays were too large."
,himansu_007,2011-03-26T19:12Z,"Thank you 20-40
+1"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-26T20:08Z,"@muk0690: I've seen torrent two days ago, but seeing that subtitles have not been made yet, decide to postpone for future times. I can find the source, but problem of subtitles remains, as for Senna 2010 - and I'm not in the right mood to listen all idiots who would complain.

I would expect better approach from encoders of the movies from small cinematographies. Subtitles are not well excepted anyway, but listen Hungarian for 104 minutes without knowing a word - is very hard thing to endure."
[T],qwersd,2011-03-26T20:09Z,sorry 2040... my fault...
,jon4fun,2011-03-26T20:20Z,"Hi 20-40,

,muk0690,2011-03-27T07:39Z,"@twentyforty: It was mentioned in the description that ""subtitles ....... English"". But I didn't check the containing files yesterday. I checked it now and there was no subtitle.

anything would be ok!"
,i_am_sid,2011-03-27T10:14Z,"@twentyforty
Can you please encode

-------------Shaolin Soccer (2001)---------------
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286112/

----------The Chaser (2008) ----------
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190539/

Only source file are available. No BRrip available."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-27T10:32Z,"@r-0987: You requested Jackie Brown - yesterday.
              Don't you think that this one is probably too much to ask? Step on the breaks.

Beside, it's mediocre movie. Maybe your favored uploader have it, and I know for a fact that axxo done it while back, torrent is alive and well - and it is a good encode."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-27T10:47Z,"@i_am_sid: Maybe you've missed my statement made last month that I never would encode Chinese and Korean movies again.
Koreans broke the record on Hit&Runs (6 Korean movies in row have over 99% pure Hit&Runs, probably it's cultural issue)
and
people from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and emigrants should resolve a question ""What is the language and what is the dialect"" and why I need to listen rabid outburst of, in general, politically ""motivated"" idiots. Knowing deeply the nature of that ""issue"" I would add that I would continue with Chinese and Korean movies when pigs learn to fly."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-27T12:22Z,calling Jackie Brown mediocre does injustice to the word's definition. 'nuff said!
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-27T13:53Z,"@formerly_azrielle: Read again:
""please do this movie- Son of Rambow (2007)""..."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-27T19:47Z,"Sorry 'bout that...but...I saw Jackie Brown in a movie theater when I was driving a long haul truck across the country for a living, for a break from the monotony, and I was not particularly impressed."
,razorraj,2011-03-27T20:38Z,thanx man..........
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-27T20:54Z,"@formerly_azrielle: LOL So it WAS ""upside-down""... and I was thinking that you objected on my ""mediocre"" 'bout Son of Rambow not about ""Jackie B"". Never mind, I get it now. I am not crazy for Tarantino's 'opus', some movies are good, some bad, same as for many many other directors, but to be fair - QT is one of the best. Out there is plenty of better ones."
,EDDIEOH,2011-03-28T01:30Z,beautiful great video thanx 4 up!
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-28T05:52Z,"I don't follow behind Quentin Tarantino like some do--I don't know what other movies he has done, nor whether I have seen them--except Kill Bill 1&2.  They're worth seeing again and again, oddly enough."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-28T10:31Z,"@formerly_azrielle: I have seen all Tarantino movies and second your thoughts about KillBill. I add to that From Dusk Till Dawn and Pulp Fiction, as the best ones."
