,Meatus,2011-05-06T21:24Z,Sounds good.  Thanks!
,Meatus,2011-05-06T21:27Z,Actually at around the 3:00 point it gets grainy like the quality drops off.  That's the loud part in the song.
,Knikers87,2011-05-25T11:05Z,Best quality I could find
,beckylee,2011-12-19T22:25Z,"nothing wrong with this song, great quality and great song. thanks my friend."
,Schnippshly,2012-04-24T02:48Z,"I can't find a version of this song that doesn't have this horrible quality at 3:00. The MP3 is too loud, so it gets scratchy and sounds awful."
,XxHABlOSxX,2012-04-25T04:26Z,The reason why it gets loud at the 3 min mark is bc JC sung really loud into the mic at that moment... to show how much mood and meaning he  had towards that song.
