You have to feel for Treefight For Sunlight. With the industry seemingly insistent that bands burst forth fully-formed, firing on all cylinders from the word go, itâ€™s practically career suicide for your first album to merely suggest potential rather than scream instant magnificence. But thatâ€™s exactly what we get with the Copenhagen foursomeâ€™s self-titled debut. Treefight For Sunlight isnâ€™t a knockout success, but it just about contains enough to suggest that, if thereâ€™s any justice, the Danes deserve a second crack of the whip.

On paper, theirs is a beguiling proposition â€“ imagine a slightly cartoonish take on Sixties West Coast psychedelia, augmented by vocal layers reminiscent of MGMT or Panda Bear. Indeed, the enchanting curtain raiser â€˜A Dream Before Sleepâ€™ does a good job of whetting the appetite. But as first song proper â€˜You And The New Worldâ€™ moves into focus, the excitement levels are quickly dampened. It has decent ear-candy value, so isnâ€™t completely without charm â€“ but as a song, itâ€™s a non-starter.

And the albumâ€™s a real mixed bag from here on. The bright and breezy â€˜Facing The Sunâ€™ is enjoyable, if a little lightweight, yet itâ€™s sandwiched between the utterly forgettable â€˜They Never Did Knowâ€™ and the so-jaunty-itâ€™s-actually-quite-annoying â€˜Rain Airâ€™. Thatâ€™s not to say that all the jauntiness is unwelcome, though â€“ the rousing sing-along â€˜What Became Of You And Iâ€™ is by some distance the album highlight, even though itâ€™d be far better suited to CBBC than to the Brixton Academy.

With â€˜Time Stretcherâ€™, the record ends on an uncharacteristically intense, broody note. But while it means the album lacks a satisfying pay-off, it also signals a path via which Treefight For Sunlight can develop and mature. But with their debut album being so patchy, they may not be given the chance.
