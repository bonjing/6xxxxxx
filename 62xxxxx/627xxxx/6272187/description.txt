Highly acclaimed rising star of Belgian jazz and a modern piano master already
with his own musical voice and clear creative vision, Jef Neve returns with the
follow up to his universally praised Emarcy debut 'Nobody Is illegal'. Revealing
a mellower, deeper side to his personality on his latest album 'Soul In
Picture', Neve and his talented trio continue to build on their immense promise
as one of the most exciting new bands on the international jazz scene.

Throughout 2007 the trio played at major festivals like North Sea jazz, Jazz
Fest Wien/Austria, Vancouver Jazz Festival, Montreal Jazz Festival, Paris Jazz
Festival, Veneto Jazz/Italy, European Jazz Festival/Athens, Jazz au
Chellah/Rabat, Blue Note Festival Gent, Gaume Jazz, the London Jazz Festival,
'Piano au Jacobins' Toulouse, Middelheim Jazz/Antwerp, Lille Festival,.. and in
2008 will perform at Veneto Jazz in Italy, concerts in Germany, Spain, France,
Japan, Mexico, the UK, and many more locations.

Jef Neve was nominated for several prizes : the ZAMU Awards 2004 and 2005 in the
category 'best artist'; the 'Cultuurprijzen Vlaanderen 2005' in the category
'music' (next to Tom Barman/DeUs and Capilla Flamenca), and the'Octaves de la
Musique 2005'.

Then in February 2007 he received the ZAMU Award "Jazz". He also wrote the
soundtrack for the movie 'Dagen Zonder Lief' by Belgian film director Felix Van
Groeningen which came out in the cinemas in march 2007. Critics mention the
sound track as being one of the strong points of the movie, and Jef Neve was
invited to perform extracts from the score at the "World Soundtrack Awards" in
an arrangement for piano and orchestra.

Jef Neve is also part of the Pascal Schumacher Quartet, with which he recorded
two albums, and who won first prize at Avignon 'Tremplin Jazz'. The band
performed in Europe as well as tours in Australia and South-Africa. Parallel to
his fast growing activity as jazz artist, Jef Neve prepared the Goldberg
Variations by J.S. Bach during the year 2005, which he performed several times
in 2006 and 2007.

He is currently writing his first piano concerto, which will be premiered on 1st
and 2nd of May 2009, together with the Flemish Radio Orchestra conducted by
Michel Tabachnik. Jef Neve has been asked by the National Belgian Radio
VRT-Klara to do a weekly jazz program, and since January 4th 2008 his program
"Neve", recorded live, is broadcast every Friday night from 7 to 9 pm. All this
and he is set to conquer the international jazz scene as one of its brightest
new stars as both pianist and composer.
