                Duty of Care.
                When a teenager with severe disabilities dies due to
                a fire at his home, Ronnie and Matt soon discover
                that the blaze was not an accident. There is no
                shortage of possible perpetrators, but the finger of
                blame begins to point in an unexpected direction.
                When the case comes to court, James and Alesha find
                themselves up against a lawyer who is determined to
                win at all costs - and whose ego threatens the fair
                outcome of the trial.
