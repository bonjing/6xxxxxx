"Face Off"

President Martinez (Blair Underwood) and 
Blake Sterling (Zeljko Ivanek) have the 
Sleepers surrounded, but after Sophia 
(Laura Innes) triggers a national 
disaster, negotiations ensue. Elsewhere, 
with a lead on the whereabouts of 
Dempsey (guest star Hal Holbrook, "Water 
for Elephants"), Sean (Jason Ritter) and 
Vicky (Taylor Cole) continue on their 
mission.

Enjoy :)
