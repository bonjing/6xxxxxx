 Game information:
 =================

 Crysis 2 is the sequel to one of the greatest PC  first-person shooters yet
 created. Featuring  futuristic war, gorgeous destruction  and the chance to
 kick alien  butt on the grandest stage of all,  New York City,  Crysis 2 is
 destined  at  the  least  to  equal  its  predecessor,  if not  surpass it.
 Additional features include:  challenging  AI enemies in  the single player
 campaign, 12-player support online,  new and improved upgradable Nanosuit 2
 technology and more.

 The world has been ravaged by a series of climatic disasters and society is
 on the verge of total breakdown.  Now the aliens have returned, with a full
 invasion force bent on nothing less than the total annihilation of mankind,
 starting by trying to rip the heart out of Earth's most iconic city.

 In New York, terrifying  alien invaders  stalk the  streets and a nightmare
 plague strikes  down  the city's  myriad inhabitants with  brutal  epidemic
 speed.  The  city's systems  are in chaos,  its  streets  and  skyline  are
 smashed and in  flaming ruin. This is  New York City like you've never seen
 it before. Neither  paramilitary  law  enforcement  nor the might of the US
 military machine can stand  against the invaders, and all who choose not to
 flee are dead men walking.  Just to survive in this maelstrom of death will
 require technology beyond anything any modern soldier has ever seen.

 Yet one man will inherit that  means to survive. One supersoldier, wielding
 the combat enhancement technology of the  future with Nanosuit 2, will make
 the last stand  to save  humanity from destruction in the urban jungle that
 is New York City.
