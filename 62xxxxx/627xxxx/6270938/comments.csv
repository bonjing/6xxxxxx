,MrFwibbles,2011-03-27T23:22Z,"I'm told that AVG (and possibly other antivirus programs) gives a false positive on sHPsoBB.exe. This is because the file has been altered to redirect the game to the private server. You can't add the file to exceptions in AVG, so to get around that, disable the resident shield feature in the folder that you install the game to.
