Meet Roy Weichbrodt, Holyman Undercover.

Join Roy as he bids farewell to his farm and says hello to Hollywood in this attempted zany comedy. Roy heads to L.A. to search for his estranged uncle, instead stumbling on fame and fortune in a TV role playing Satan. Pursuing his dream girl, Roy's short lived popularity vaporizes in the backlash from jealous TV networks, producers and co-stars conspire to turn this upstart's life into a living hell."

An Amish man goes to Hollywood

What a disappointment!...I found this movie just plain silly and dumb. It had no clear Christian message...also was very suggestive in an immoral sexual way...inappropriate for younger viewers. It should have had a rating to this effect. I was very embarrassed that I did not preview this movie before watching with my children. I felt the jesting of Christianity did a disservice to all Christians...
