v: 7/10 (but it's ok: 1.5GB / 1:54h)

why 7 not 8..9?
video looks a little ""fatter"" / to wide;
bad aspect ratio?.."
,LezDawson,2012-02-04T17:30Z,Wrong aspect ratio. Should be 1.85:1 (not 2.35:1). There are better rips than this. But thanks anyway. I'm sure it should look ok by adjusting the playback aspect ratio.
