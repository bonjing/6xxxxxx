Sly 3 is a cell-shaded platform game involving vehicles, gadgets, and an assortment of minigames. Joining your heists are a few new playable characters and enough new items to keep them fully equipped. Sly 3 also includes competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes.

I have personally tested this with HDLoader 0.8b+ and 0.8c and it works perfectly.
