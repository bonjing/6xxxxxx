,jesusshockwave,2011-04-04T14:37Z,"Thanks Rasputinho. 

>I didn't realize the Snow / ""Scattered Flurries"" screensaver is a demo, nonetheless it is a freeware version. If you would like a Winter Wonderland background, you can go to http://www.whiteknightlogic.net/software/scatteredflurries/ and buy the screensaver for $4. It still works, just with a black screen. 

Glad to hear you enjoy all of them!"
,jesusshockwave,2011-09-11T21:24Z,"***In order for me to be able to upload more movies and music for you guys, I need constant seeders for my torrents - allowing me to focus my uploading and seeding for the new torrents. All of my torrents are less than 500MB (nothing), so please SEED! THANK YOU!***"
,hckrwolf,2011-09-24T08:30Z,can someone please seed?? TPB says there's 5 of you but Vuze says there's only 1... and im stuck at 0.3%
,ghostmumu,2011-11-29T20:20Z,Thanks! great collection but no seeders now...
,iPlunder,2012-02-19T11:46Z,"Strands is also a demo, from the same dev. as Scattered Flurries."
,iPlunder,2012-02-19T11:52Z,Just discovered that Ignis Fatui is also a demo.
,jesusshockwave,2012-02-24T00:04Z,"My bad guys, I am seeding again. Busy with school and work. It will be running."
