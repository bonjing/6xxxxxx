Diablo 2 Classic and Expansion. 
Guaranteed Clean, scan away please. 
I have downloaded on 2 computers. This upload is from Kynon Hill @ Demonoid. Giving mad props to him. 

I will give a quick description on how to download and use this, but its pretty easy. I am making a video WITH VISUALS for the slower learners on Youtube, which will be added later to this post. Check back in the next 3 hrs.

This is 100% working!!!

1. Dl

2.Unzip into a seperate folder

3.Using Daemon or PowerISO mount each file.

4. You may not be able to mount the X-pac right away, I was able to but other users reported @ demonoid that they could not mount x-pac right away. If that is the case, you need to just mount the play&install for now. After you have downloaded the Play successfully the Xpac will mount perfectly.

IMPORTANT:::: 5. Install CLASSIC, using valid CD keys. You can find about 20 free sets of CD keys in the video I am to upload later. You can also email slaynish@gmail.com and buy 5 sets for 5$ via paypal, or bulk sets for a different kinda deal.. He is a valid seller that represents a lot of the d2 community as far as CD keys goes. He sells to online d2 merchants that bot and spam, botters in general, d2jsp users...etc. slaynish@gmail.com once again.


6. Install XPAC, if you need keys see step #4 once again. Or good luck walmarting/getting overcharged for boochie deals.

7. 3.)Download the latest patch under [Expansion] from Blizzard's website!!
