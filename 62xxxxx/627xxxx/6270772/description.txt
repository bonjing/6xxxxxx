======================================================================================================================================
A washed up Vegas lounge singer, Jack Satin (Hamilton von Watts), has
no money, no job, and delusional aspirations of fame. When Jack is
forced to leave Vegas, he packs up his old Cadillac and hits the road
for Atlantic City. But his car dies in the desert and Jack is left
stranded in the small town of Lost Springs. There, Jack meets jazz
legend turned mechanic, Doc Bishop (Robert Guillaume), who helps him
with his car trouble. Although Jack is far from the stage, he begins
to find himself feeling at home in the small town. When he meets
dreamy eyed bartender, Lauren Wells (Melissa Joan Hart), Jack starts
to see there is more to life than chasing fame and fortune. Doc
encourages Jack to explore his true love of music, while Lauren
provides the audience he has always wanted. But as Jack realizes this
town has more to offer him than the bright lights of the big city
his Vegas past catches up with him -- what unfolds is comedy at the
crossroads of life
