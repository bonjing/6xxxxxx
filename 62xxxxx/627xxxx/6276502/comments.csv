,fuckincrazyness,2011-03-28T05:17Z,"homer saves mr. burns life by shooting down his hot air ballon, in return mr burns gives homer tickets to a football game. while at the game bart pee's his pants on the jumbo-tron.  homer goes to therapy for choking bart. then homer no longer chokes bart. Bart then becomes out of control because homer is to afraid to choke him. they reunite with the therapist. but the therapist gets mad at bart and chokes him. homer and bart then sue the broke therapist and live in his hollowed out tree."

,PAUL_D74,2011-03-28T21:28Z,"Really newme2011?
your moaning because somebody copies something from the bay?   
just think about what your saying here. the whole point of tpb is to copy.

and where's your evidence that he copies from someone else? there is every chance they both copied it using the same method and channel, might just look the same"
,PAUL_D74,2011-03-28T21:29Z,BTW thanks eztv for the great work!
,newme2011,2011-03-28T22:31Z,"@PAUL_D74 

people upload torrents he gets them then uploads in his own name he is a cheat AT LEAST UPLOAD YOUR OWN STUFF"
,simonjonnemeth,2011-03-28T22:41Z,"Bloody hell mate, how can you talk about stealing when your on a torrent website? Some people just don't think."
,woodis,2011-03-28T23:46Z,"@newme2011

The whole point of him uploading them under his name is that it is a well-known and trusted name. He's digging through all the crap that's out there and brings the good stuff to torrent pages like this one, thus helping to share the love :) If he was stealing them he wouldn't keep the tag of the original uploader now would he?

,Tordflake,2011-03-29T20:45Z,"@newme2011 You cant steal a torrent man,
Torrents are for sharing!"
,PAUL_D74,2011-03-31T00:07Z,"so, what if someone else uploaded it first? he's spreading the love, eztv uploads = more people watch = more laughs from this great program, win win win

then some teenage idiot comments with very little knowledge  or regards for others with no evidence and insults the uploader? 

you need to get a knowledge of whats going on here.
eztv gets absolutely nothing from uploading but the nice feeling of sharing. "

you deadset dont know what your talking about"
,PAUL_D74,2011-03-31T23:27Z,"i have got to copy a comment from some one else it might help people like newmw2011 understand.

""Everyone getting along... offering suggestions... kind offers to help find/seed a sought after title... not a single unprovoked attack on an innocent bystander... an uploader so known and trusted as to make a/v ratings pointless... 33-friggin-thousand seeders... no fights over imperialism or 911... an unfamiliar (to me), but seemingly legitimate subtitle link... sincere (though brief, i'll grant you) insights regarding the quality of the production itself... multiple friendly expressions of gratitude to the uploader....& no spam. By the gods, no spam.

Someday, fathers will sit around the campfire telling their children about this comment section.

'C'mon dad... Not one argument about nationalism? Not a single person spoke dismissively about the quality of a stranger's genitals?' 

'No, son....It was wonderful. People worked together toward a common goal, and they did so respectfully and in friendship'. 

'Yeah, okay dad....and you had to walk 6 miles through the snow to get to school, we've heard it all before....'

---
Anyway.... Thanks EZ. Always sincerely appreciated. Hope all will be well with the main site soon. :)""

if no one can understand the beauty of tpb after reading that, they obviously can't read. "
