Description

VSO Blu-ray to AVI software performs fast conversion Blu-ray videos to AVI with top image quality and easy file selection. Convert your Blu-ray files in AVI in one click. Select the audio and subtitle of your choice from the video, and press convert.  You may burn the conversion to DVD if you would like. Conversions are completed quickly, giving you the best quality possible. Create an AVI in stardard or high definition format: 720 or 1080 pixels in the output size of your choice.  Your AVI files can be uploaded to the internet or played by various plays that support the AVI format (one of the most widely supported formats besides DVDvideo - vob files).  Enjoy your blu-ray movies in non blu-ray devices and still benefit from the high definition quality!  For those who burn their AVI to DVD with our burning engine integrated in the software, no problems will be encountered as it supports all DVD types and brands. The live preview allows you to watch the conversion process. 
With the VSO burning engine included in the software, burn your project onto DVD automatically.

â€¢ Perfect quality
Use our quality advisor to adjust the settings of your project to get the best quality.  Select the output resolution, SD or HD, and output size from a list or set your own custom size.  The output can even be split over two disks.  See before you even start the conversion process what the quality will be and adjust settings for fine tuning. Never be disappointed again by poor quality results!

â€¢ Simplified with Advanced technology 
Our advanced discriminator technology does all the hard work for you behind the scenes. Whether you want to convert a movie or a Blu-ray series, the discrimintor presents the main files you need and insures the correct ordering of the files. This means no more sorting through long lists of video files wondering which file is the right one to select - our software does it all for you. Not only that, but for films with multiple angles, a special preview module helps you choose which angle you want to convert.

â€¢ Extra Fast
Our software has been optimized for multi-core processors meaning you get even faster conversions. Speed up your conversions by using the Cuda profile which will use NVIDIA CUDA technology during the decoding/encoding process. Now convert 3x's faster and you can even use your computer as you normally would without being slowed down by the conversion as your GPU is processing the data instead of your CPU!
