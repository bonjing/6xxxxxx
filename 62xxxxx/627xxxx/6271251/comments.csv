It seems that in Victoria these were shown as one big ""combined"" episode. But in NSW they were shown on separate nights.

Episode info (copied from elsewhere, not my text):

7.30pm Thursday 24 March (Ep 31)

Who can resist a choccy chip cookie? All will be revealed at this week's Temptation. Are contestants eating strategically...or are they just hungry? Either way. everyone gets a chance to burn off a few extra calories in this week's Contest.

7.30pm Friday 25 March (Ep 32)

It's off to the beach again. this time for a round of volleyball with some very specialguests. Michellehasanintensetrainingsessionandthings getmore thanalittle heated.Noteto selfdon't pick a fight with your trainer. it's inevitably one you will lose.
