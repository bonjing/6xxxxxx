NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Mars Needs Moms

Right heres our take on mars needs moms .....thanks kindly to toxicink for the source files.
The source files were nice but had a fair bit of camera movement and was lacking some life,but still 
good for what it is .....a cam.
So for this we cut the file up on the big camera movements and used a perspective filter to pull the wonky 
borders off without losing hardly any video...each part needed different amounts so AR does change throughout
but looks better this way in our opinion.
On top of that we added more colour,changed the contrast and brightness and increased the sharpeness.
Audio is off our old ts release but has been resynced to this version.


Some compare shots so you can see:

This is not knocking inks work what so ever,but just showing the difference in cropping etc....

Enjoy folks
