,nbrazil,2011-03-29T11:22Z,The recent economic woes are as nothing compared to the mound of 100+ million bodies sacrificed on the alter of Marxism. And let us not forget that much of the economic crisis was brought about by folks who fancy themselves followers of Marx.

You're right that millions died but that was Stalin's doing, not Marx's. And Christianity has killed millions more.  Do you even understand what Marx wrote about? Short term measures - typical among companies and government agencies who pursue profit above everything else - cause long-term problems and a lot more money. The Shell blowout is just one recent example. Libya will be another."
