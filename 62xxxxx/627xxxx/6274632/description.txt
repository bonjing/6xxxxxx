Movers & Shakers are an up-and-coming band from Boston, MA who have had a melodic sound with punk influences, although they are not a punk band. I would simply classify them as melodic rock. They're not as heavy as stoner rock, yet they are much more hard-hitting than jam bands or the Jack Johnsons of the world. I'm gonna stop there, because far more talented writers have written reviews on them, so I encourage you to check those out if you like to do some research before downloading.
