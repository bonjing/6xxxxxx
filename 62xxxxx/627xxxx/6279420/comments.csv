[V],HobbitGamez,2011-06-28T05:34Z,"To fix the ""Trial Version"" message:

Extract the ZIP file, then open the folder called ""properties"" and delete the following files:
partner.xml
partner.xml.sig
partner.xml.sig2"
,Schizoman,2011-08-25T06:35Z,"I never got the trial version message, it used to work fine for me but after the first few days it kept popping up with a message saying that the client version is out of date and to update it or get a new one.  If I choose yes to update the game closes and doesn' update, but if I choose no I can play without connecting to Facebook, but connection to Facebook is the reason I got this game.  Is there any sort of fix to this?  This seems to be the most recent upload of the game on The Pirate Bay so getting another one probably wouldn't update the game for me."
