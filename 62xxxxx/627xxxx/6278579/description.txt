SOURCES:
VIDEO: ADDiCTED  ... Thanks 
AUDIO: Thanks matey... Thanks

NOTES:
Here we go again with another rango....but this time we were given the 720p source files so we could get
an even better rip.
The source files were nice but were interlaced,had wonky borders and was dull loooking.
So for this we needed to rotate the video to straighten it up and then crop the borders,but we used a
perspective filter for that as they were still no dead straight,so this way you lost no video at all.
We then used our normal brightness,contrast,sat,sharpness filters to clean it up the best we could and then
save as a 720p rip.
Audio same as before but resynced and changed it so there should be no convertxto dvd issues,and then we muxed
it to our new encode.

Enjoy folks.
