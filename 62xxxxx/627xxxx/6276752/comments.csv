,sam.larsson,2011-03-28T08:03Z,"Oh man, how thankful I am to you Slicknick. Have done a donation, but it seems like time to make another one. Always sitting here and fishing till the next round pops up. Don't know if it's true, but I saw that there was 8 Seeders, and all of a sudden it dropped to 4. Are people that selfish, that as soon as they got it, they quit uploading, when there is over a 1000 people waiting to get it? Shame on you then. Leave the computer on."
