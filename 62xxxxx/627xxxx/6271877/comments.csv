,highlander777,2011-03-27T07:22Z,"Thanks for the upload!

A: 7 - Volume is a little too low
V: 7 - 

I don't if it's the editing or directing, the movie just drags. Scenes are held on too long. Lots of scenes really don't contribute to the storyline.
Got bored and started fast forwarding."
,sardox,2011-03-27T18:25Z,"Horrible film. 1/10. Horrible, distorted audio FX.
If you watch this movie, be prepared
to waste an hour and a half of your life.
Worst movie I've watched since
""Antichrist"", and at least that one had
some shock value and decent cinematography.
The writer/director of this piece of shite should
go back into hiding where he belongs."

Not worth the time watching this crap.
