,irtrav,2011-04-01T15:56Z,"To be fair, it's a fine torrent. It works online, patches fine (as there's no real protection), and the virus is very likely a false positive.

,deano_au,2011-04-05T13:17Z,"It works fine and there are no viruses.

It is a false positive because the batch file used wants to write to the registry to add registration information.

orcywoo6: You're an idiot. Do some research before you blow wind out of your arse. It wastes peoples time and scare people off from what is otherwise a great torrent and a great game."
,sergeant0101,2011-04-06T14:57Z,"it isnt running for me, pls somebody help"
,orcywoo6,2011-04-07T20:41Z,"Guys no need to tear me apart just because I am concerned, malwarebytes never gives me any false positives that was the only reason I posted."
,Pokler,2011-04-18T20:46Z,"You are all idiots. The trojan isn't even found in the file that adds to the registry nor the bat file (obviously).

It is found in the game's main exe and this is highly suspicious. The fact the uploader is anonymous doesn't add any trust.

I say this scene release has been messed with.

But go ahead and keep downloading software from Mr. Anonymous."
,JesterAzl,2011-05-05T20:42Z,"People are so greedy that they deny the obvious virus threat and run their mouths at someone being nice enough to warn everyone.

Hey dipshits, when you start to notice computer problems or someone using a credit card in your name because they stole personal information, make sure you think of this torrent and the obviously suspicious Mr. Anonymous. "
,andrewtan1,2011-05-12T17:49Z,Yup i'm sticking with its filled wit virus. Just wait or go and buy it instead.
,a1s,2011-07-17T04:03Z,"I did not find a virus.
Avast. 110716 bases. What did you use?"
,SadBear,2011-07-31T09:25Z,"Avira v. 10.2.0.696

Found malware on the exefile. Not going to use this torrent!"
,Hentheden,2011-08-12T21:11Z,"I can't get it to run, all it does is stay as a process. Any suggestions? Even tried copying from trial but then it becomes the trial."
,TwoGood,2011-08-17T09:36Z,Seed  Plzzzz? 
,mwalsher,2011-10-24T05:06Z,"@deano_au, you are an idiot. Lots of programs write to the registry without being flagged as malware. Lots of programs are flagged by a few scanners, but are false-positives and are soon no longer flagged once the scanners update. I would say to use your brain, but obviously you have none.

This torrent is risky at best (not necessarily the VACE release, but this specific torrent that was uploaded by an ANONYMOUS user!) The extraction program is flagged by a lot of scanners (not just one or two). Even if you manually extract the .V file with a reliable copy of FreeArc, the main EXE is also multiply flagged as is the identically named EXE in the DATA directory. In fact, if you open the EXE in the DATA folder in a hex-editor, you can clearly see the actual EXE inside the virus wrapper.

I suggest trying to find either a clean copy of the VACE release or another release altogether."
,smoothley,2011-11-04T20:44Z,"it has a virus, just follow these steps
- install with bat
- delete atomzombiesmasher.exe (size 100kb)
- start game from ..\data\atomzombiesmasher.exe (size 1.161kb)
Enjoy!"
,LastGodx,2011-11-06T16:37Z,"Ok so... For those who have problems running it...
1) Download the DEMO version from the creator's site.
2) Download this torrent
3) Install the DEMO version (don't launch)
4) Click the .BAT (batch) file from this torrent and let it do it's job.
5)Copy all of the files that have been made by the .bat file (or respectfully the ""game"" itself)
6) Paste the copied files from the torrent to the location of the installed DEMO version
7) Overwrite them
8) Start the game from ...\data\atomzombiesmasher (1,161kb)"
,yeeerk,2011-11-13T02:04Z,"it works fine for me.
although i did heed the warnings of the virus, so i avoided opening the .exe file in the first folder, which potentially was the supposed malicious file.

i followed smoothley's instructions:
- run .bat file
- play game using ..\data\atomzombiesmasher.exe

deleted the original exe file in case it was an actual virus

but as long as you use the exe inside \data, the game runs perfectly. thanks for the upload."
,ttorrentseed22,2011-12-27T01:59Z,"ok so i got it and nothing went wrong or happened no viruses were even considered positive so to ANYONE who says its a virus STFU bcuz I dwnloaded and its fine
im seeding 24/7/365"
,FaceCookies,2012-02-08T11:32Z,"Doesnt work for me, whenever i run the bat it pops u saying its done the everything dissapears like it deletes itself leaving the text file."
,Pvt900,2012-02-20T18:00Z,After i run the Bat it says press any key to continue i do and it all disapears help
,Kooblukhan,2012-06-15T00:48Z,"same as above, ran .bat and it all disappeared.  can't find it anywhere else either after searching forever.

seriously doubt the scene release did that naturally, i'm calling shenanigans.  can anyone prove me wrong and explain wtf happened?"
