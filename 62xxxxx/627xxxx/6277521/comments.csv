[V],RajMahal,2011-03-29T03:48Z,"Excellent quality bud..
Thanks :D"
,crispybaguette,2011-03-30T16:46Z,"bad cropping and only 2.0 audio :|
i hope a proper rip will turn up soon"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-30T17:58Z,The black bars are not cropped out... but there's nothing wrong with that.
,john depp,2011-04-01T04:25Z,"Seriously GoodFlims I like all your movies but this one.  I'm not commenting on AV qualities man!  You know what I'm talking about.

I thought you only catalog Good Films.  
Yes.  This movie is gore.  Probably as gore as your other torrent ""The Chaser (such a good film btw)"".  But that's about it... The story is really poorly written.  The characters make too many nonsensical decisions for no logical reasons.  This movie has highly competent actors in it but you know that alone doesn't make this a good film.  

I'm grateful for all other torrents by you but this movie was nothing but cheap and vulgar.

[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-01T14:23Z,"Actually, I don't know what you're talking about, because I don't watch everything before uploading. My uploads are not based (for the most part) on my taste in films.

The reviews/comments suggest it's one of those love/hate films (like Black Swan - pretentious rubbish in my opinion) :)"
,john depp,2011-04-01T20:59Z,"Oh.

OK.  I'm always thankful for efforts.  Just want to add that here :)

CHeers"
,mufuti9,2011-04-03T20:05Z,"it is a truly great film, one of the best korean movies I ever watched. Like most great films, not everybody is expected or obligated to like them, that is what personal opinion is for :-P

Quality is as usual and expected, the BEST!
No idea how this upload got -42 ratings, fucking morons.

+1!"
,Hyraxx,2011-04-05T01:19Z,"Fantastic quality both in audio and video. Great upload, much appreciated.

,gazza2009,2011-04-29T18:32Z,"black swan is trashhhhhhhhh, is this in english?"
,swamiolsson,2011-05-05T10:54Z,"Haha. There's some opinion displayed here. For that reason alone, and for the reason korean films are mostly VERY good or VERY bad - I'll DL this one and lend it an eye. The quality is very important.
Thank You, GoodFilms."
,swamiolsson,2011-05-05T11:02Z,"Whau! There's a very good DL speed here.
Thanks again, friend!"
,alembert,2011-05-10T09:58Z,"Seriously? Only ussian voice over& russian subtitle?Thats sucks bad....
No wonder this UL has a - 10 rating

BTW there is no way to change subtitles or audio for this file in Media player. "
[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-13T00:34Z,@alembert. NO... Read the description!!!
[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-13T00:34Z,"PS the negative votes all come from one pathetic guy, so ignore it."
,Wolfcry,2011-05-17T16:58Z,"A good film, indeed.

10/10 A/V."
,AtotehZ,2011-05-29T00:17Z,"@alembert
When you say 'Media Player' do you mean 'Windows Media Player' or 'Media Player Classic'?

MPC with the codecs every MPC user should have works 101%.

WMP is not a program I can make myself use and cannot comment on the capability there.

Microsoft has proven themselves to create rubbish software time and time again. They're slowly redeeming themselves with Windows 7 and perhaps Windows 8, but the OS is still with the same flawed core."
,xylolz,2011-05-29T20:33Z,thanks
,Tuppy,2011-06-18T10:15Z,"wtf. 
what is with the awful rating.
the audio and video quality are great.
boy that russian audio...thankfully can be changed to orginal as well as sub-titles. 
can't wait to watch this.

ps: try VLC people if you having trouble playing files. It plays just about anything I've come across, I don't even recall what it hasn't. Hell it even played a media file that was just ""file""."
,ronibob,2011-09-21T10:01Z,"just seen the preveiw on imbd looks a realy good film but it will take me about a week or so to download a 6.38 gig film thats with the fastest broadband in my area so unfortunatly i,ll have to find another upload cheers any how."
,casstin,2012-02-08T02:21Z,I started downloading this video when I noticed it's in 2 CDs format!! What the fuck? What fucking idiot still releases movies in 2x700MB format?? Who the fuck still uses CDs? Get with the fucking times and stop wasting people's time/bandwidth. God damn.
,casstin,2012-02-08T02:23Z,"Woops, ignore my comment before. I meant to post it to a DIFFERENT torrent, not this one. My bad."
,Impzman68,2012-02-11T22:20Z,Excellent quality....T/Y... can anyone help me with changing audio on VLC ?  ..thanx
