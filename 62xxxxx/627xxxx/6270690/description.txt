"Authoritative & wise" -- Warren Bennis "John Adair is without doubt one of the foremost thinkers on leadership in the world" -- Sir John Harvey-Jones There is a revolution underway. We are moving -- rapidly in some areas, slower in others -- from management to business leadership. As the market for good leaders who can achieve results increases, so-called leadership development programs have proliferated. Many of these are old management development programs renamed, and others are full of confusing theories and unproductive approaches.
This ground-breaking new book aims to set the record straight. It looks at the body of knowledge on leadership, identifies the seven key principles of leadership development, and answers key questions on how to select, train and educate leaders. In "How to Grow Leaders," John Adair continues to inspire new audiences with his timeless vision. A vital addition to the debate on leadership from a true expert, this book also considers the global challenge and long term issues involved.
