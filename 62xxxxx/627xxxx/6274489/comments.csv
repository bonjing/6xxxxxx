,c3bhm,2012-01-16T01:39Z,btjunkie comment says this one is missing some subtitles for some of the native american language parts.
,k_akshay007,2012-02-29T18:24Z,the subtitles do not work.....they are necessary for the native american parts!!
,k_akshay007,2012-02-29T18:26Z,sorry! there are two folders containing subs the second one has em'
,c3bhm,2012-03-24T02:24Z,The English subs that k...007 is referring to are for the whole damned thing.  There are not English subs for non-English parts only (and there are Native American speaking scenes).
