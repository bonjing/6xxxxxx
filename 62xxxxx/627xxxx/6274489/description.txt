Directed By: Edward Zwick
Tagline: Set in the Rocky Mountains of Montana in the early 1900s, this is a tale of love, betrayal,
and brotherhood. After being discharged, Colonel Ludlow decides to raise his three sons in
the wilds of Montana, where they can grow up away from the government and society he has
learned to dispise. The three brothers mature and seem to have an unbreakable bond, until
Susanna enters their lives. When Samuel, the youngest of the three, returns from college he
brings with him his beautiful fiance, Susanna. The eldest son, Alfred, soon finds himself in
love with his brother\\\'s fiance, and things get worse when he discovers a growing passion
between Susanna and Tristan. Colonel Ludlow\\\'s favorite son, Tristan is willful and as wild
as the mountains. As the brothers set out to fight a war in Europe, suspicion and jelousy
threatens to tear apart their once indestructable bond.
