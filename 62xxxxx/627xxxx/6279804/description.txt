A small village high up in the mountains of Ketama, North Morocco. Since centuries the life of the people that live here is intricately tied in with the drug hashish. Hashish as daily labour, hashish as a bartering good, hashish as business, hashish as the basis and philosophy of a social system, hashish as the medium of dreams and hashish as the reason for stagnation.

The film sketches a portrait of this life: a look at work and daily family life; the drug; music and landscape as a metaphysical projection surface; the question of freedom in a globalized world; and, at the core of the film, the stories of the people.
