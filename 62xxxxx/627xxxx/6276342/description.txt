SUMMARY:
While investigating a call in an abandoned house, Officer Frank Williams and 
a rookie find a woman brutally blinded, but they are attacked by a huge psychopath 
with an ax; the rookie is killed and Frank shots the criminal in the head, but 
has a severed arm. Four years later, the mutilated Frank is relocated, working 
as a guard in the County Detention Center. Frank goes with some delinquents 
to the Blackwell Hotel, an abandoned place since a fire burnt the last two 
floors, with the purpose of cleaning the location, preparing it to work as 
a shelter for homeless; in return, the criminals will have their sentences 
reduced. During the night, the inmate Kira that has some Christian tattoos 
in her body is kidnapped by the deranged serial-killer Kane that collect 
the eyes of his victims, while the rest of the group is attacked by the 
psychopath with his ax.
