Description
A scathing comedy satire of fashionistas and cut-throat corporate excess boasting a grandstanding central turn by Meryl Streep as the ultimate boss from Hell, The Devil Wears Prada is based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger who once worked as an assistant to real-life Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

In the dizzying world of New York fashion, where size zero is the new 2, six is the new 8, and a bad hair day can end a career, Runaway magazine is the Holy Grail. Overseen with a finely manicured fist by Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) - the most powerful woman in fashion - Runway is a fearsome gauntlet for anyone who wants to make it in the industry. To make Runway the fashion bible of New York and therefore the world, Miranda has let nothing stand in her way - including a long line of assistants that didn't make the cut. It's a job no self-respecting person can survive, yet it's an opportunity a million young women in New York would kill for. 

A stint as Miranda's assistant could blast-open the doors for recent college graduate Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway). More college drab than haute couture, she stands alone among the small army of 'Clackers' on staff at Runway - superslim fashion divas clacking their stilettos down the halls of the magazine's Manhattan headquarters. But when Andy comes in for the job, it dawns on her that making it in this industry will take more than drive and determination. And her ultimate test stands before her in head-to-toe Prada. Miranda can spin the fashion world like a basketball but has a devil of a time finding and keeping a good assistant. Andy is completely wrong for the job. But she has something the rest of them don't: she refuses to fail.

To become the perfect assistant, Andy will need to make herself over in Miranda's image. Soon, much to her boyfriend's dismay, she can talk the talk, walk the walk and never again confuse Dolce with Gabbana. But the more of life she sees through Miranda's eyes, the more she begins to grasp that Miranda's world is a fabulous but lonely one - and that sometimes great success depends on great sacrifice. But at what cost?
