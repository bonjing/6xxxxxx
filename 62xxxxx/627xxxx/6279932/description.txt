StoryLine:
**********

A documentary crew followed Metallica for the better part of 2001-2003, a time of
tension and release for the rock band, as they recorded their album St. Anger, fought 
bitterly, and sought the counsel of their on-call shrink. 

Some Kind of Monster is a music documentary about Metallica's making of their album St. Anger 
and the difficulties they had to go through in the process. The directors shot over 1200 hours 
and followed the band around night and day for over a year to create this documentary.
