STFU ... people are sick of your inane TS question ... and rate the fucking thing yourself then ... Jesus !! ... don't you get it ? ... yet ?  Wow   WTF ?"
,wizzkid1970,2011-03-26T04:08Z,fuck your rules on what is the right comment to say we will see the torrent for the face value which at the moment has no audio or video responses but as far as the image shots of the movie are concerned you can see they blurry and too much chroma but thats to be expected from crappy ts and cams for real i dont know why anyone would want to download a good movie in cam quality it totally ruins the movies experience and fine details

For the second time...

You are making yourself look dumb. I like that you are trying to be smart by listing what you think are facts and then spamming every recent movie listing.

Here is a bit of information that will help you figure what quality the movies will be, jackass.

TELESYNC (TS)

A telesync is the same as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for the hearing impaired). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled.

TELECINE (TC)

A telecine machine copies the film digitally from the reels. Sound and picture should be very good, but due to the equipment involved and cost telecines are fairly uncommon. Generally the film will be in correct aspect ratio, although 4:3 telecines have existed. TC should not be confused with TimeCode , which is a visible counter on screen throughout the film. Most R5 releases are Telecines.

Stick to looking for R5s and for the love of god quit making dumb posts.

Thanks. "
,KnottyBoi,2011-03-26T07:13Z,"wow..um...anyways, is this the same copy as

A=9 V=8 - Great job!


TY for posting something that is accually usefull to me trying to get a grip of the quality i can expect :)

@ Hero_No_1 : Ty for the upload ;)"
,KnottyBoi,2011-03-27T07:16Z,once again is this the same as the other big torrent?
,vernernet,2011-03-27T16:09Z,"Don't know if this is the same as any other....I haven't seen one other than this.
I also believe that a cam should be rated using a 1to10 scale. Totally diff than a dvd-rip scale.
On that note.....I give this upload -

A=7.5
V=8
M=8

Nothing to visual going on in this flick....so I think this is very watchable.
Thanks to the UL'er!"
,guanche07,2011-03-28T19:41Z,"Bloody good movie, will watch it again when DVDrip comes out...Thank you, good for cam !!!"
