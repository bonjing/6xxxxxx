Napalm Death album "Scum" (I also included "Nazi Punks fuck off" in the torrent).

Wikipedia: 
Napalm Death are a grindcore band formed in Birmingham, England in 1981.[1] While none of its original members remain in the group, the lineup of vocalist Mark "Barney" Greenway, bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris and drummer Danny Herrera has remained consistent for most of the band's career.

Napalm Death are credited with defining the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of hardcore punk and death metal, short songs, fast tempos, deep guttural vocals and sociopolitical lyrics. The band's debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community.[2]
