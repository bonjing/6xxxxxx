Guardians of Magic: Amanda's Awakening is a simple adventure/puzzle game in which the title character, Amanda, is tasked with discovering who is threatening the realm of magic and, if possible, putting a stop to it. To help her accomplish her goal, her late grandfather left behind two magical machines, a bubble blower that reveals invisible mystical creatures, and a "power drain" device that sucks all the electricity out of whatever it's pointed at. Unfortunately, he didn't leave them in one piece. Instead, he stashed the parts to the devices in a half-dozen different locales, some magical and some mundane, and now it's up to Amanda to track them down and put them together so she can get on with the job.
