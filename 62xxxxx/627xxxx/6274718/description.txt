HISTORY IN THE MAKING 

Once in a lifetime you may experience a brief moment when the stars align and something truly extraordinary happens. This was the case in October 2004, when four of the greatest living blues legends were assembled in Dallas, Texas for one incomparable night of music. At the time they ranged in age from 89 to 94 and all had received the National Endowment for the Arts Heritage Fellowship Award, the highest honor in the USA for traditional arts. These musicians have devoted their entire life to playing the blues, and staging such an epic event was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Once reunited, the old magic reemerged. It was if they were long lost school buddies.


JOE WILLIE "PINETOP" PERKINS 
Born July 7, 1913 in Belzoni, Mississippi, Grammy Award 
winner Joe Willie â€œPinetopâ€ Perkins took up piano mid-career after he was stabbed in the arm. Early on, Perkins 
accompanied such blues legends as Big Joe Williams and 
Sonny Boy Williamson. By 1953, he was well known as both a 
back-up player and solo act. This was also the year he made his first solo recording with Sun Records. Now living in Austin, Perkins used to visit Texas regularly when he played piano for the legendary Muddy Waters Band. Today, â€œPinetopâ€ Perkins is regarded as one of the worldâ€™s greatest blues and boogiewoogie piano players.

"PINETOP" PERKINS died on March 21 at the age of 97 at his home in Austin, Texas.R.I.P. 

HENRY JAMES TOWNSEND 
He goes by the name of Henry James Townsend but his friends call him â€œThe Muleâ€. Though the nicknameâ€™s origin is a mystery, it could refer to his stubborn will to keep playing. At the time of this recording, the dean of St. Louis blues and reigning patriarch of the blues, Henry James never had played Dallas in his 94 years. He is the only American recording artist to have recorded in every decade since the 1920â€™s. Henryâ€™s music is a unique combination of country and city blues, tempered with just the right amount of influences from Lonnie Johnson and Roosevelt Sykes. The best part about Henry is the wisdom he shares with the audience about his life and his music. Itâ€™s insightful, provocative and timeless.
 
TOWNSEND  died, at the age of 96, on September 24, 2006, at St. Mary's Ozaukee Hospital, Mequon, Wisconsin. R.I.P.

DAVID â€œHONEYBOYâ€ EDWARDS 
David "Honeyboy" Edwards was born June 28, 1915 in Shaw, 
Mississippi. To listen to Mr. Edwards and his skilled slide 
guitar playing is to journey back in time to the Mississippi Delta and the street corners of Clarksdale, Mississippi. There, Honeyboy played a pivotal role in shaping the seminal moments of blues history. He is sought after by documentary filmmakers for his detailed accounts of blues folklore, especially his recollections of the day Robert Johnson died. He describes Deep Ellum, east of downtown Dallas, as if it were yesterday. He recounts with incredible accuracy his escapades near the â€œCentral Trackâ€ (now Central Expressway) that bordered the west side of this area known for its colorful nightlife in the 30â€™s and 40â€™s. 

EDWARDS as far as i know is still alive.He is now trully the last... 

ROBERT LOCKWOOD, JR. 
Ninety-year-old Robert Lockwood, Jr. or â€œRobert Jr.â€ to his friends used to â€œplayâ€ one-month gigs in Fort Worth during the 50â€™s and 60â€™s. He learned to play guitar from the legendary Robert Johnson, who lived with Lockwoodâ€™s mother during his formative years. He learned his first song, â€œSweet Home Chicagoâ€, in about three weeks under Johnsonâ€™s tutelage. Robert is also one of the original King Biscuit Boys who once opened for King Biscuit Time, now the longest running live radio show in America. Today, Mr. Lockwood is recognized as one of the most prolific guitar players in the world. His unique chord progressions have earned him two honorary doctorate degrees for music theory. 

LOCKWOOD died at the age of 91 in Cleveland. R.I.P.
