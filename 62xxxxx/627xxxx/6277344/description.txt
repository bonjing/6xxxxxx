READ ONLY THE DESCRIPTION HERE.PLZ I AM VERY SORRY FOR UPLOADING THE TORRENT FILE BECAUSE I JUST HAVE TO UPLOAD SOME TORRENT FILE.JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ONLY AND DOWNLOAD THE FILES I VE DESCRIBED AND NOT THE TORRENT I VE UPLOADED HERE

Its 100% working. Just Follw these Steps ( In simple way :-)

1.Download this file http: //com/ ?gplcquyx21gkhv7     (remove the spaces wher ever i put) {size = 18kb}

2.Now u will get a rar file which ,wen u extract comes a file called \"OPTIONS\"

3.Copy this and replace it in the following folders in XP or Win 7 

XP :
C:\\Documents and Settings\\(User Name)\\Application Data\\Ubisoft\\Assassin\'s Creed Brotherhood\\Saves

Win 7:
C:\\Users\\(User Name)\\Saved Games\\Assassin\'s Creed Brotherhood\\Saves


4.Now Download this Skidrow torrent Named : Assassins creed brotherhood Full v1.01 Update Skidrow {size 111 Mb}
(watch out for the pic on the page : its written on it as Online + Offline)..this is the identity :-) 



5.Now u get inside the folder of the downloaded file, u ll see A folder named \"Online\" and many rar files.So first extract the rar file which ends with \".00\" and then u will get a skidrow Folder and a installer file.DO NOT INSTALL THIS FILE,AS IT IS A WASTE..Now hang on and Just go inside the \"online\" folder and extract the first rar file and then u get a Installer file. 

6.Install that file. Once it gets installed ,NOW go back and copy the contents from the Skidrow folder to your game folder and replace.

7.Now play and it will work 100%....

NOTE : IN THE GAME : U WONT FIND ANY THING LIKE DA VINCI DISAPPEARANCE ON THE MENU SCREEN..JUST START UR GAME WHERE U LEFT IT AND YOU WILL FIND A ICON WHICH LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE A NEW DOCTOR SYMBOL WITH 2 SERPENTS AROUND A STICK ON THE MAP NAMED \"RESTORED MEMORY\" NEAR THE PANTETHION LOCATION...
