When Tokyo is threatened by a 130 foot tall flying lizard 
with laser breath, Gamera turns from destroyer of worlds 
to protector of humanity in this sequel from director Shigeo 
Tanaka. Shortly after Gamera is launched into space, a meteor 
strikes the rocket carrying the rampaging terrapin, freeing 
him to return to Earth. And just in time, too, because an 
enormous reptilian named Barugan is wrecking havoc on Tokyo, 
his deadly energy field destroying buildings, and sending 
frightened citizens running for their lives. As Gamera engages 
Barugan in a monumental fight both on the ground and in the sky, 
the same folks who once cowered in terror from the towering 
turtle now cheer him on.
