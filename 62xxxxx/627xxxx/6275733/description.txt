[quote]Mohan (Mammootty) is an upper primary schoolteacher, who lives with his wife and their six-year-old son. He is actively involved in the cultural activities in his school and in his village too. His ambition is to act in films. Mohan is so besotted with this dream of becoming a star that he dresses and behaves like one. Although his colourful clothes and obsession with his looks invite the ridicule of his colleagues, his wife supports his aspirations. Then a film crew comes to the village for a shoot. Mohan makes several attempts to make his dream happen but certain incidents occur and the story takes a different turn.[/quote]
