,spencer05,2011-03-27T06:29Z,"This is fake, do not download!"
,sagi58,2011-03-27T12:55Z,It works great :) ty
,mjyumping2,2011-03-27T13:21Z,"Hey,

Don't listen to ""Spencer05"", cuz' he's a liar!
This works great!
Try it yourself, it works!

sagi58 is right. it works!"
,papitow,2011-03-27T23:20Z,"So far it's working good. I've already run the update through the launcher and it worked fine.
So, thanks mjyumping2
& get lost spencer05"
,just.dont,2011-03-27T23:20Z,This game requires an internet connection and a valid product key to work in an uncracked state. A mini-image does not (and can not) circumvent that.
,mjyumping2,2011-03-28T01:35Z,"@just.dont
So you don't have an internet connection?
To update by the launcher, you must have the DVD inserted on your DVD Drive.
This Mini Image simulates as a DVD disc that fools the game as you have the disc inserted.
and when you update the game, you don't need a valid product key, cuz' when EA made that, not all the customers (even they're Legal)  are patient to log in and put they're long serial everytime they update the game.
Therefore, the mini image can circumvent that!
Maybe you just don't know how to use this mini image. Thats why your name is ""just.dont"".

This works and always work. Because I also using this mini image."
,ccf10,2011-03-29T05:27Z,"This definitely works and definitely gets around the ""you need a valid copy"" problem. I just got the RELOADED version and searched around for a crack for a long while. This one, however, simply needs to be unzipped and mounted with something like Daemon tools to work perfectly.

Nice upload, man"
,just.dont,2011-03-29T20:23Z,"@mjyumping2:
I can update the game just fine. How that helps me play it, though? It still asks for either an internet connection (if I block it with firewall) or a valid serial (if I won't block it).

This protection was all over Sims 3, and it's the same here. Any kind of mini-image won't do jack shit unless you have a valid serial."
,mjyumping2,2011-03-30T03:30Z,"@just.dont
Well it's your problem.
It's only you with that problem. You're just making your own TS3 protection theory. "
,LordGrave,2011-03-31T22:23Z,"They just released 1.2 patch. The date in my country is still day before the release date :)
After update, the game keeps asking to validate the serial online. I didn't even get to try the mini image with 1.0 or 1.1. Trying to roll back at the moment."
,papitow,2011-03-31T23:40Z,Is it true that we cant update the game to version 1.2?
,mjyumping2,2011-04-01T04:03Z,"@lordgrave
Is it true that there now an update 1.2?"
,80smunch,2011-04-01T05:22Z,is true. I got the patch this morning
,apinujam,2011-04-01T05:37Z,"Do not install 1.2.3 patch for now! You'll be asked for legit serial number when you run the game. Just wait a little longer, somebody will find a way to get through it sooner or later."
,mjyumping2,2011-04-01T06:44Z,but 80smuch looks like he got the patch and game still working. I probably because of your computer.
,mjyumping2,2011-04-01T07:07Z,That issue must be the start of our extinction!
,papitow,2011-04-01T17:47Z,"Yeah, as already said, we better stick with version 1.1 and wait until some1 comes with a safe solution to update it to 1.2"
,joserobjr,2011-04-01T20:25Z,"don't update to 1.2 yet! This mini image doesn't work as crack!

A workaround I found is to use the crack files for 1.1 until someone release a crack... But you will experience random crashes...

This mini image is usefull if you have an original copy and don't want to keep using the cd.

(I wish it was already released in my country)"
,LordGrave,2011-04-01T21:06Z,I'm using 1.1 crack with the game patched to 1.2 without crashes.
,LenaIsAPirate,2011-04-02T14:48Z,This is great.  As far as I know this works for all future patches excluding game extensions or add ons...
,LenaIsAPirate,2011-04-02T14:50Z,"@joserobj
This works with all the patches, including 1.2.3. If it doesn't work you will only have to type in your initial registration code or reinstall and remember your serial code."
,LordGrave,2011-04-02T18:20Z,@LenaIsAPirate: That didn't work for me. Some codes are probably blacklisted. Might be you got lucky and got the one that isn't.
,Chelesia,2011-04-13T17:47Z,I get a error code that says the version of windows I am running is not compatable...help!!!!!!
,reynawask,2011-04-29T08:10Z,"yea, it's corrupted and unaccessible -_-, ill better buy it at stores and pay for a worth than downloading it freely and memory-worthy but it's corrupt :("
,simon75,2011-05-13T18:20Z,Thanks mate. Works brilliantly and im running update 1.3.13. Hopefully it will contine workingn for future updates and add ons. 
,AwDload,2011-05-16T19:01Z,I download this and get an Adobe reader file? Im not sure how to mount it.. Any help?
,mjyumping2,2011-06-01T06:04Z,"Thank you for positive users, I know it works
and for those who says this doesn't work, their idiots."
,twrntg,2011-06-07T20:33Z,updated to 1.3.13 with this and worked fine for me..
,greek_lover,2011-06-15T15:16Z,i download it..but i don't know how to use it.. i've install the original. but i don't know what to do next...
,TheDutchmen19,2011-06-29T17:33Z,Hey guys. I downloaded the game and installed it. And now mounted it on daemon tools lite. For wich Windows 7 bit is this ment? because it sais that I got the wrong one?
,kryinglady,2011-09-05T02:34Z,Cool it works! nicely done!
,Crumblezz,2011-09-26T01:05Z,"i'm sure it works but i don't know how to do. 

I extract the mini image (20 something KB) to the desktop then i try to mount it to Daemon tools, but it says that it can't mount because the file doesn't have any content! Help please!"
,11western,2012-01-13T18:11Z,"This Mini image works for me. I had bought the base game for my daughters laptop and put it on my pc as well. while she has the disc I could'nt play but just used this image a minute ago and game starts fine.
Thanks uploader!!"
,Spiro88,2012-05-25T11:32Z,"cool man!

P.S Does this work with the expansion???"
