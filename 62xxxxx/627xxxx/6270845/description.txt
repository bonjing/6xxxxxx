Fire and Water
I once visited Arlington, in 1976 with my family.
And much later when I worked for USTC.
I went to the Kennedy's memorial.
In front is John's eternal flame.
Around to the left is Bobby's Memorial.
It is the sound of a brook.
A Marble or Concrete Table with water pouring over and the contrast is soothing and appropriate.
And the inscription I once new...

This is Ted Kennedy;s Eulogy for Bobby:

"My brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, to be remembered simply as a good decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.
"Those of us, who loved him and who take him to his rest today pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will someday come to pass for all the world.
"As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him: 'Some men see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say why not.'"


I have felt for years I may have met Bobby in LA. A seven year old boy does not have the kind of reaction I had to watching a stranger die on tv. But he does to someone he may have just met. A man whose eyes were so incredibly...honest...and then so suddenly taken away.

I have always thought in the back of my head that I met Bobby in LA with my father before the convention...there are pictures I remember seeing of him in the streets in La among the people campaigning. And it has to do with Catalina...whether we went there or afterwards...that is my fascination with the ocean and why I continue to refer to it as representing God. And I do now believe we may have gone to see the ocean afterwards.


And as an aside...this has to be the exact reason and only explanation that no one responds....the world would not turn their back on someone hurting kids no matter how vile this world could possibly be.
