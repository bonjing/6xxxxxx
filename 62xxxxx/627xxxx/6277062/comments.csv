,micnor14,2012-03-15T22:31Z,"@TheSrbendaMan You need to move the folder out of the default position, e.g. - the updater is one directory too high in the RAR you downloaded. That's it. 

@SAFIBMWM3 That was a legitimate question in the comments section. Don't be a dick. There are  Adults present. 

@mr.funkalicous You need to make the shortcut to the correct EXE with the correct parameters (don't forget your parentheses "" "")
You will also wan't to stop steam in the background. That should do it. "
