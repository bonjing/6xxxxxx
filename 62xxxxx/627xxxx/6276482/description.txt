    The Team visit Jersey to investigate the origins of        
    Mont Orgueil Castle: a fortress that came to symbolise    
    the Channel Islands' bond with Britain.                  
    The massive castle that dominates the shore today is a    
    Tudor structure built on earlier foundations, and it's     
    that early castle, built by King John, that the Team      
    are looking for.                                         
                                                              
    Unfortunately everything is built on top of a rock         
    outcrop with the steepest sides the archaeologists have   
    ever encountered, and they have to employ mountaineers   
    to help get them and their equipment up the sheer         
    slopes; it's not an excavation for the faint-hearted.      
    As the dig continues, shadows of that original castle     
    are discovered and a story emerges of how Mont Orgueil   
    came to symbolise Jersey and the Channel Islands'         
    peculiar relationship with Britain and France.             
                                                              
    It was fought over, lost and won back again for          
    centuries, but the massive stone walls that the Team      
     uncover ultimately proved futile against the might of      
    gunpowder.
