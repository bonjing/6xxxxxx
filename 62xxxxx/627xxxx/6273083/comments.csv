,starpilotstarpilot,2011-04-10T06:27Z,"wait.....i'm the one who is trolling....i should refer you to my last rebuttal: lol....i have a quite a few fans actually....AND...you never listened to my music....AND....why the fuck would you advertise your album on my torrent while at the same time demeaning it? i can't quite wrap my head around that one....but, i tend to be the type of person who finds holes in the logic of morons.

,sh0tgunfacelift,2011-04-22T18:29Z,Idiot For the 100th time this isnt my band Empire Falls Are Awesome. You Wish you Band Had Half of the Talent this band Has.  I listened to your shit band aswell as almost got infected by the keylogger in your torrent. Stop posting on all of my torrents trying to advertise your trash.
