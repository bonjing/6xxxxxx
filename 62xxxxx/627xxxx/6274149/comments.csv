And then I will repay the commnity by bootlegging them here bwa ha ha >:D), could you give me a newb explanation of how I can play this on it? I never heard of emulators and all that before. I can't afford a Wii at the moment (no duh, just bought a $2,000 hunk of tech. Im broke) and dyyyying to play HM. I used to own this version but my nephew killed it viciously. Help please???"
