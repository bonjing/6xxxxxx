Starting with their third album, A Piece of Strange, which dropped in 2006, CunninLynguists began tackling some heavier topics, such as racism, self-hatred, and violence. There was still a light air of wit here and there, but this trio was looking to focus on the more serious side of life, which continued with 2007â€™s Dirty Acres. The fans who loved CunninLynguistsâ€™ goofier style were quickly appeased, though, with the two Strange Journey mixtape-style albums in 2009. But for their fifth proper album, it appears Kno, Deacon the Villain, and Natti are returning to the serious subject matter. As the album title indicates, Oneirology will deal with the science of dreaming, from the stages of sleep to dreaming disorders and everything in between.
