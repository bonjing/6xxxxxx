,erroid,2011-07-05T11:26Z,something wrong is with the quality - it doesn't have such power like in movie or it's not clear enough... hm...
,yojoe23,2011-07-10T19:03Z,"quality is fine. songs seem to be arranged a bit differently than when heard in the movie. Still, a very good soundtrack. Thx locobot12"
,yojoe23,2011-07-10T19:20Z,"Musical arrangements within the OST songs are a little different than what u hear in the movie.

Still a good OST for what it is!

Thx locobot12 for the UP."
