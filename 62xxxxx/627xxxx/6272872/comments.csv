,-spook-,2011-03-27T06:12Z,Could you please upload the PS3 version of the game? Thanks. 
,Aerionix,2011-03-28T05:34Z,"1) why was this upped by an anonymous user?
2) anyone who's actually got this game by fair means or foul, whats the dashboard update situation?  I'm still hesitant to update, and the last few games I've looked at wanted a newer version than what I have.  Does this need an update as well?"
,kaushikh,2011-03-28T16:52Z,"hey guys .. 
can any one of u who have already downloaded this game plzz tell me if this is AP25..

tnx a lot for d upload"
,alex22408,2011-03-29T03:24Z,pleasee upload dynasty warriors 7 ! 
,keith28,2011-03-29T07:27Z,this game is not ap 2.5. And JTLYK i really believe the uploader will add in info that it is ap2.5 if and when a game is. Why do you think uploaders never answer ur question
,NTA-Pro,2011-03-29T09:25Z,i'm hoping for the ps3 version also
,dubbman,2011-03-30T04:21Z,"downloaded and burned fine..
when i try to start it it says the system needs to be updated.

my 360 is not connected to the internet, and is not updated to kinect dashboard.

not sure if this means it is ap2.5 or what would happen if i update, but i don't really want to take that chance.
any body know if it'll work without LT+..  i believe i have ixtreme 1.6..  it was flashed at a local shop in september."
,All40ne,2011-03-30T06:32Z,"THANX UPLOADER!!.. Worked on first burn, wasn't surprised since abgx had all green (except for info in their database).. No Ap25 errors.. 

@dubbman.. You can update with no problem..and 1.6 should be good since LT+ is only to ensure more protection when using xbox live...

Don't forget to support the DeVs :-)"
,fankoosh,2011-04-01T10:26Z,"please i need help , i have sw ixtreme 1.6 , i have latest dash board 2.0.12625.0 , i repatched my Black ops .iso file by abgx.exe & all done ok , i burned on my DL DVD , but still i cannot play it , gives me disck unreadable , can all experts help me to overcome this problem, thanx

,brawlysnake66,2011-04-02T21:56Z,"Alright let me try to answer some questions heere

@fankoosh I tried patching Call of duty Black ops when the Anti piracy check started.It patched but It didn't work for me.Than I decided to mod to LT+.So make sure you have that otherwise,even if it is patched it won't work.

@dubbman Go ahead and update if you want,but if you have games that have Anti-Piracy 25,otherwise don't.This will terminate you from playing games that have Anti-Piracy such as Call of Duty.Until you re flash it to LT+ i wouldn't recommend it.

@alex22408 That game is already uploaded,but by another user.

@kaushikh As far as I know this is not AP25,but to be on the safe side check with ABGX 360.

@uzumaki92 I think the uploader did something wrong.All I know is that you can't have both regions on just one disk.I'm pretty sure this is NTCS,so this might be a waste of a download a it won't work for you,but if you want go ahead and try.

If I'm wrong correct me pllzzz....I trieed :)

,ToekneeNo,2011-04-04T23:43Z,"Hey, I have a problem burning these newer games.  Quick background info: Got my xbox 360 modded about 1.5 years ago and every game has loaded right away without a boot disk.

Games like NBA 2k11, Madden 11, and Halo Reach all worked, but recently games like Tiger Woods 12, WWE Allstars, and MLB 2k11 do not load, but they load properly on my cousin's recently modded xbox.  

What can I do to fix this problem?  Games as recent as Halo Reach have worked, but this last batch of new games isn't working.  Do I have to patch the new games? If so, to what wave?  Thakns for your help guys"
,farhan360,2011-04-07T21:30Z,friends does wwe all star ask for the update which activates the halo reach and call of duty black ops ap 2.5
,JustinV77,2011-07-12T06:59Z,"@dubbman : if you update, yor pretty much fucked, you wont be able to play any more games that are not originals, the update will flash your drive back to stock hence, itll need to be modded to LT+ v1.9 to play back ups again without any issues, sorry nukka, read up!"
,TDOG871,2011-08-17T17:27Z,how do i convert all these files to a iso file?
,bazman0316,2011-08-26T15:12Z,@TDOG871 download winrar
