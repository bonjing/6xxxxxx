,randernaut1,2011-03-31T08:44Z,"It's NOT a BRRip. You get black bars on the top and/or bottom of the screen now and again, plus the occassional TS scene where something is blocking bits of the camera view. The sound is shit too - like a high end line.

A/V based on it being a BRRip:

A - 1
V - 1


If you've watched it Cody, and still decided to post it as a BRRip, then I'd suggest you gently go fuck yourself."

for a 700mb size  quality it's more than OK !!
Both: Video and audio . It's not 10/10 but at least  it's decent. I'll let other people judge this rip and I don't rate it....

[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-04-14T03:54Z,"for noobs:

If the source says that was ripped from a Blu-Ray disc RC = Region C....than so it is !!!


Blu-ray Discs use a much simpler region-code system than DVD with only 3 regions, labeled A, B, and C.

- Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus the Republic of China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan and Korea.

- Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.

- Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as the People's Republic of China and Russia."
