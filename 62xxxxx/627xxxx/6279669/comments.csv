,ccutting6,2011-03-30T02:01Z,"DARTHEXILE STOP YOUR FUCKING BITCHING ABOUT MP4 IT'S BETTER THAN AVI 
ARE YOU THAT RETARDED THAT YOU CANNOT CONNECT YOUR PC TO YOUR TV 
ARE YOU THAT RETARDED THAT YOU CANNOT USE VIDEO CONVERSION SOFTWARE 
I'M SERPRISED THAT YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO DOWNLOAD A TORRENT 

I'VE REGISTERED WITH THE PIRATEBAY JUST TO LEAVE THIS COMMENT YOU FUCK WHIT RETARD WANKER TWAT WHO IS THAT RETARDED THAT YOUR MOTHER STILL WIPES YOUR ARSE FOR YOU  

RUDOS TORRENTS ARE GOOD QUALITY I HAVE ONLY HAD ONE OF HIS TORRENT WHERE THE SOUND WAS OUT OF SYNC 

WATCHED IT IN VLC PLAYER WHICH CORRECTED THE SOUND  

SO WHY DON'T YOU SHUT YOUR BITCHING AND GO AND CRY TO YOUR MUMMY ABOUT MP4   "
