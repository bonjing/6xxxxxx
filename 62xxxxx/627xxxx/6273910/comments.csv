,waafaa,2012-03-23T17:16Z,"You don't get it do you? Dr Duke doesn't hate all jews. He hates (and rightly so) zionist jews. jews that have an allegiance to Israel and who are manipulating the US to their will. Imagine if instead of jews, hollywood was run by North Koreans, instead of jews in Congress it was North Koreans, instead of jews running the Federal Reserve it was Koreans again. I think then we would all see how ridiculous the situation is and how, whites are not even in charge of their own country."
