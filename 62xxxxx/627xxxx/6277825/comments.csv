,www-moviecom-se,2011-03-30T13:02Z,Subs are included.
,ffhhkk,2011-03-30T23:27Z,"is there no way to rip this movie in an avi container with harded english subs? I'd convert it myself but i don't know how to convert from one format to another.

anyone know how i can do it using virtualdub?"
,ffhhkk,2011-03-30T23:29Z,my bad.. i was looking at another torrent. this one is in avi and has subs!! thanx to the uploader!
,githead,2011-04-04T15:09Z,"Subs are all over the place - the ones included are for a different version of the film I suspect.

In any case, don't waste your valuable time - this is one of the worst, most amateurish films I have seen in a long time. No narration, no captions to tell you who the interviewees are (and the english colossally boring anyway).

Most of the video quality is crap, there is no story or thread. This is an insult to the memory of Senna."
,srflojo,2011-04-05T02:08Z,"As this is the (nearly) 3 hour cut, I believe these are the proper English subs:

,srflojo,2011-04-05T02:20Z,"just a follow-up, the link in my other post is for the correct subs on the 2hour 42min cut.

hard-coded with AVIAddXSub, tested on computer and ps3, all synced and working"
,Ayrton_Castro,2011-04-07T19:49Z,"Thanks a lot, great movie, great quality!  ;}"
,baybeh,2011-06-14T18:26Z,"I don't get it. Why advertise it as the 104 minute theatrical version when it's the 2 hour 42 minute one?
Anyone know where to dl the theatrical version from?"
,ektoras44,2011-06-19T19:35Z,thank you :)
,fill3rup,2011-06-25T13:17Z,"This is a much longer edit of the Film,its about 2 3/4 hours long.. which is why the original theatrical subtitles dont work.. the one just entered are perfect.. Wonderful film and this is the definitive version..well done for the upload.."
