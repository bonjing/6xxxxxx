1st: I would prefer if you stay ""mute"", just get things you're interested in
2nd: You are in my home (more or less ""virtual"" one) and accept the fact that my word is the last word. I earned that right doing public service for years, for no money, just to help others and to get fewer and fewer Thanks. Respect that."
