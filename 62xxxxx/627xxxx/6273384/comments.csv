,labroue32,2011-04-13T14:08Z,"come on, people. years ago, a primitive custom build of windows from my own part received about 35k downloads in a few months over at demonoid.

now, this is an [i]improved[/i] release -- so, where are the 65+ seeders? this release is slowly dying. i've done what i could about it, though.

more info, just for the sake of it: this is build around tinyxp rev09, fourth option. included driverpacks are from 2009 or so, but those can be updated by modifying the iso before formatting and reinstalling.

because this release is feb-dated, only firefox v3.6 is included, so one has to ""check for updates"" once or twice for it to get updated to the current, v4.0 release.

also, especially owing to a preoccupation from your part of avoiding all forms of malware, one might be better to install the ""public fox"" addon for firefox, so that, suppose your immature cousin comes over at your home, he won't be able to install flash. also watch him out for inserting any kind of external hardware in, such as a usb flash drive -- in order to prevent the occurring of miscellaneous infections. computers, in their software part, only get certainly cured through a complete reinstall."
,labroue32,2011-04-14T15:21Z,"Tiny XP installs thousands of registry hacks, that improve the system so much youâ€™ll never want to go back to the standard version. 

i am using tiny xp rev 09 by eXPerience from a very long time. I have atleast installed it on 10 computers in the last one year. all i would like to say , is that its more charming than anything else.

Pirated Windows more impressive than the real thing.

One of the annoyances with installing a fresh copy of Windows XP these days is that the driver set is six years out of date, and thereâ€™s been a LOT of new hardware emerge since then. Itâ€™s one thing to install the latest graphics driver, but itâ€™s another to have to set up everything from the chipset to the storage drivers. Sometimes you feel that after having spent half an hour installing XP, youâ€™re spending twice that much time again to just get it functional.

Excellent release man.

First, THANKS! my computer is flying now. 

Good torrent. Worked fine for me. Amazed by the performance.

Just wanted to say thank you for a very well made job on xp... this is what xp is suppose to be!

Definitely looking for your releases from now on, eXPer1ence. You know you stuff

works fine as usual. +1. 

This is just as awesome as ever! Very very good work on this one. 

great up. works fine

TinyXP Rev09 by eXPerience is definitely a great OS. It has helped breathe new life into two of my computers. [...] So, in conclusion, if you need a powerful OS that uses peanuts of your RAM and installs on your hard drive under 600 MB, then TinyXP is the way to go. If you need to breathe new life into an old computer, you guessed it ? TinyXP is it. Thanks, eXPerience, for the great torrent!

Flawless and beautiful all in one.

Best collection of windoZe I know of..."
,labroue32,2011-04-14T15:23Z,"I wish Microsoft would hire the eXPerience team and all people involved with creating TinyXP so their skills could be put to legal use creating fantastic unbloated software like this.

Hi eXPer1ence, first of of all, i'd like to thak you for your releases. They are awsome. I'm a computer technician and use your releases in old computers.

I always +1 your ups since I learnt how to do unattended stuff from you ad youre releases are always one of a kind.

Thanks - this really rocks. 

I've already installed this on three different PCs and went successfully.

THIS IS THE BEST TORRENT EVER!!!!!!!! I COULD KISS U!!!!!!!

This download rocks!!!!! I installed in in no time at all and the installer didn't require input. I hope that's good. THX THX THX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this is really a great windows! thank you so much! 

looks sweet, thanks!

BEST FREE OPERATING SYSTEM YOU CAN HAVE ON A COMPUTER PERIOD! CLEAN AS A WHISTLE AND PURRS LIKE A KITTEN. MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I DID'NT FIND IT SOONER. I Like how geek friendly the extra options are on it. For example being able to get to the device manager just by right clicking on 'my computer icon' GENIUS! IF IN NEED OF OS, OR JUST WANT TO FIX OTHER PEOPLES COMPUTERS - BINGO! 

Best Torrent I have ever downloaded! Thanks eXPer1ence, impressive work! "
,labroue32,2011-04-14T15:45Z,"first off it began when i took the initiative of doing a survey on phone with people I knew. e.g., do you prefer file to be hidden, what theme do you like best, and small things like that. it turned out that windows firewall seems enough, because whitelist-based approaches are not well-enough developed yet. conclusion being, if you want to keep your system out of malware, only download file from sources you know can be fully trusted.

the underlying idea being that one should best abstain from being influenced by their own curiosity. sound people love xp.

this release is a kind of community work. people are welcome to contribute to the continuation of the project. take this creation out further if you have the means to. pursue experience's ideals. be the bill gates of the 21st century. etcetera.

i want to make it clear that this isn't by any means my own creation. it's the result of years of work time, from the part of lots of people, such as the driverpacks team. this release is just my contribution to the idea of keeping xp alive. why update, anyway? what (reasonable) justification?

people have told me, ""update,"" seven adds over to compatibility. what? others have told me: beats the interface 100 to 0. but i couldn't care less about the eye candy. the (unfinished) black theme that experience has added to xp works wonders over here. ""security?"" firefox is the only app communicating with the internet. just keep it up to date. most people that have in the years argued with me on the matter obviously think they know more than they actually do. naivety is precisely what i think is contributing to them constantly moving on to the bandwagon in virtually any worldly field.

the real thing that is stressed here is the idea. that xp is there to stay. in other words, not much is new here besides the idea of a community work aimed to the preservation of the ever-adequate operating system that is xp, and if such releases (as tinyxp) can help the cause, then why not?"

Actually I think the reason for the torrent is going to die is by the new release by eXP1rience:
