01 Radial-Arm-Saw Joinery: Fine Woodworking Workshops

Plot Synopsis
Curtis Erpelding is a talented furniture maker and teacher who, on this video, provides detailed instructions for using a radial-arm saw, the joint-cutting tool needed to cut complex angles in wood so that furniture will fit together properly. As the program progresses, Erpelding talks about the safety reasons for properly positioning one's wood and tools on the table. He works with some of the initial design work that will help students fit pieces of wood together, and he also starts shaping a dovetail slip joint, mortise-and-tenon joints, and other complex pieces. Various hand tools are featured as Erpelding cleans the surfaces of the finished joints.
