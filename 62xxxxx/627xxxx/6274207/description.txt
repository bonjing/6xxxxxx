Directed by Dejan Zecevic, the heroes in the comedy Mala nocna muzika are Spasoje and Cole, two likable but silly chaps, constantly getting into funny and hazardous situations.

They work in morgue and one night, out of curiosity, they decide to answer the phone ringing in the pocket of a dead man. From situation to situation, their lives become more and more complicated and they get closer and closer to the gate of danger.
