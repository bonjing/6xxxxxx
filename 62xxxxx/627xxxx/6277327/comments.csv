,asdfen,2011-03-28T12:14Z,"read the text files with instructions

,asdfen,2011-03-28T15:28Z,"Unlocker by ShadeSpyker

Replace the options file here:

In XP :
C:\Documents and Settings\(User Name)\Application Data\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves


Win 7:
C:\Users\(User Name)\Saved Games\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves

BESURE TO MAKE A BACKUP OF THE ORIGINAL ""OPTIONS"" FILE, JUST IN CASE!

Save Game that is included has 100% everything completed and is optional you do not have to use it."
,asdfen,2011-03-28T15:32Z,once you copy the file you get mission icons on your map
,iffens,2011-03-28T20:37Z,"can someone crack multiplayer ?
lots of games MP not cracked why?:S"
,pretttt1,2011-03-29T04:11Z,Does this allow you to do shop investments etc?
,asdfen,2011-03-29T11:39Z,shop investments and other online only features are not in. With included save there is no point doing investments as all shop quests are completed and there are ridiculous ammounts of almost every trade item
,dinoss1,2011-03-29T19:39Z,i did everything cant see where to launch this dlc
,asdfen,2011-03-29T20:59Z,"if you are trying playing with my save file than its accessed through MENU->DNA-> RESTORED MEMORIES
in case of new game the DLC is accessible through mission icons after Sequence 3 is complete"
,Rudy_Eila,2011-03-30T02:48Z,"Guys, I finished he AC B original story today and I just got this DLC, and I don't have the new missions in my save, I only have the features of this DLC in the 100% save, but it's 100% already so there are no missions to do...
Help me please?"
,SuperSups,2011-03-30T11:07Z,"Where are the 2 solo missions? Got only the DLC, armors and completion 100%/"
,XHaloX,2011-03-30T13:20Z,the solo missions are the two templar tombs appear on the map.
,asdfen,2011-03-30T15:20Z,"I've used the DLC unlocker after I've finished 100% story and it worked for me. The Main DLC quest and two Templar tombs appeared on the map. Check where you've copied the options file.
Basically as long as you are past Sequence 3 you should be seeing the mission icons."
,TheGovna,2011-03-31T16:42Z,"There will never be cracked multiplayer. Sorry, it's just the sad truth of pirated games most of the time. Other than a few blunders (Splinter Cell: Conviction) Ubisoft is pretty good about keeping pirates of their multiplayer."
,paul.i.k,2011-04-01T05:26Z,i had to create my own C:\Users\(User Name)\Saved Games\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves Folder becouse i didnt have it for some reason.. after that copied the DLC unlocker saved game and my Session disappeared instead there is a new one which has a fucked up graphics that wont go normal one.. wtf this is? it looks like PoP graphics! 
,asdfen,2011-04-01T10:34Z,you are probably in Raiden outfit. Just unequip it through MENU->ITEMS->Outfits
,unknownoob,2011-04-01T13:00Z,i dont know but when i get to close the game it doesnt save any help here
,maki1999,2011-04-03T14:08Z,"ok,i downloaded it,installed the patch 1.01 and i founded where to put extracted files:C:\Documents and Settings\(User Name)\Application Data\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood but there is not >saves< file and i completed the game so save exists"
,streetbum149,2011-04-04T10:43Z,"lol, wow guess we have some new ppl here. guys mp is almost never cracked and unless you have something like hamatchi (however its spelled) or tunngle its near impossible to play online. if you want multiplayer in torrents as far as i know thats the only real way. it works as if you were playing a lan game, just online."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-04-07T20:36Z,"Hamachi works only with games that have LAN support. 
Don't you have $15 to buy it?
I bought it online on e-bay for 53 Polish Zlotys, which is about $15. I don't really like this Multiplayer - I'll sell it soon.

I have a question. If I apply this DLC unlocker will I have my online account blocked?"
,Ramdoode2011,2011-04-10T18:15Z,"I have the same problem too.everytime I play the game for about 6 to 8 minutes, the game chrashes and breaks and freezes my pc,and i need to restart my computer. pls help , i dont know know why it keeps happenning,i tried everything lowering the graphics,updating the game,reinstalling it, disabling antivirus ,firewall, disabling startup programs even services in msconfig, my specs are fine ,even better than the recommended for playing Assassin's creed brotherhood according to system rating.my graphic card is a GTS 250 gigabyte lgb,my processor is an intel core2duo 2.80GHZ running on windows 7 32-bit.pls help ,i would really appreciate it."

,druid513,2011-04-12T15:43Z,"Where is save folder?
 i have c / program / ubisoft / skidraw /... / / save file ( not a save folder)"
,me0134,2011-04-16T05:08Z,"Here are the steps that I did to make it work since it never worked for the first time as well.

1. Download this torrent. (of course)
2. Install Patch 1.01 (do not change the default folders set to where this patch will be installed)
3. Copy the contents of the CRACK Folder to your Assassin's Creed Brotherhood game folder.
4. In the DLC Unlocker Folder, do not copy the ACBROTHERHOODSAVEGAME1.SAV, instead, just copy the OPTIONS file and paste it in:

In XP :
 C:\Documents and Settings\(User Name)\Application Data\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves

Win 7:
 C:\Users\(User Name)\Saved Games\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves

5. Play the game.

The reason why it never worked for the first time is because I copied ACBROTHERHOODSAVEGAME1.SAV from DLC Unlocker folder.after I restored my original saved files and just copied OPTIONS from DLC Unlocker folder,it then worked.I dont know why and what's the difference between my saved game file and this saved game file but it fixed the problem.hope this helps."
