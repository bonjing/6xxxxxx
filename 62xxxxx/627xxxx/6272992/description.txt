FAQ:

When I login, the UI appears to be different than it should be, flooded with all kinds of crap.

This is becouse our client is loaded with quite a few addons that would help you to play. You can disable some or all of them by doing so:

   1. Start your World of Warcraft by launching Wow(.exe) in your WoW directory and login to your account.
   2. In the character selection screen, bottom left corner you will see a button Addons. Click it. Addon window will pop out.
   3. Click Disable All in the bottom-left corner of the addon box (or untick ones you don't need) and hit Okay in the middle-right-bottom part of the window. Now your UI will be standard and clean.
