The Princess Waltz â€“ a dance of whirling blades held to find the princess
worthy of becoming queen of Seven Central in the fantasy world of Eldelant.
Hopeful candidates travel from all the kingdoms of Eldelant to take part in
the waltz, but only one princess will reign supremeâ€¦

You are Fukamori Arata, and you know nothing of princesses or waltzes. In
fact, your daily life in modern Japan couldn't be any more ordinary â€“ you
live with your mother and sister, are woken daily by your childhood friend
to go to school, and live a generally full but normal life surrounded by a
gang of rowdy classmates. When rumors start circulating about a transfer
student to your class, you don't pay much attention â€“ princes from foreign
lands don't study abroad here in this day and age, do they?

When Chris Northfield arrives, it seems the rumors might be true. What is
such a refined, polite and accomplished youth doing at your school? Your
curiosity gets the better of you, but as you investigate you begin to
realize you're getting into something deeper than you ever imaginedâ€¦
