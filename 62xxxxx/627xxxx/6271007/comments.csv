I know some people have been hatin' the Age of X event, but to my own surprise, for some reason,  I've actually been liking it quite a lot, so far. I find Rogue's ""Reaper"" incarnation so cool, in particular. Whether this holds true until the very end remains to be seen. In any case, I'm picking this up at the local shop as soon as I get my temporary torrent fix from you & other great ones. Thanks again.  :)"
