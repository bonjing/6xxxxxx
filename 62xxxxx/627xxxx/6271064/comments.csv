,gferek,2011-03-26T11:42Z,Because it was a file to download from Within Temptation's site as a reward of buying Special Edition. That's why it's 128 kbps. The rest is a rip from original CD. Sorry :(
,Kirinyale,2011-03-26T12:06Z,"Oh well, thanks anyway... hope that we'll get the bonuses in decent quality soon as well. ""The Last Dance"" is exactly what the rest of the album lacked..."
,maxicastro,2011-03-26T21:47Z,"Thanks for the up :)
I hope this release won't have that famous glitch on ""Iron"" that all torrents have had so far, but thanks even so ;)"
,maxicastro,2011-03-27T00:56Z,"No glitch at all!!
Awesome :D :D :D
Thanks again!!!"
