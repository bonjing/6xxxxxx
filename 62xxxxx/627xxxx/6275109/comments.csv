,MrArgentino,2011-05-15T20:38Z,"Duude, I so need this program but i have no fkn clue on how to install it could you give me any help please?"
,dnvm,2011-05-22T09:41Z,"I downloaded the file. Mounted it and everything installed ok. I followed your instructions and I create the activation code. There are 16 boxes each holding four characters, but I am only getting enough to fill 14 boxes. Any ideas why I am not getting enough to fill all 16. I am running Win 7 x64 and used the x64 keygen.
Thank You for your help."
,digmaster,2011-07-11T16:34Z,"does the keygen work on the inventor?
becouse i realy want the inventor and there is no torrent for it... can you give me some lights on how can i get it... thks"
,digmaster,2011-07-11T18:20Z,"by the way the torrent is perfect, works like a charm... still i have that question... can some one tell me how to get inventor?"
,klvsa,2011-10-01T04:20Z,"Just an add-on to sephff's instructions... make sure to run all programs ie install, crack, and activation as ""run as administrator"".. sounds trivial but trust me it is important. ie right click and run as admin...   

Thx for the upload Chris."
