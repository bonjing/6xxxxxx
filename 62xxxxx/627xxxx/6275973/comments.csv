[V],oldskoolscouse,2011-03-28T11:53Z,"@munki77,
They dont actually do the charts, they download my torrent, re-pack it then upload it as there own work. ive actually caught them doing it by embeding a tag. im all for sharing but reuploading it takes away seeds from the original torrent. but thanks for the compliment m8. i appreciate it ;o)"
