Where did you hear/see this has been renewed?  As fear as I know it has been cancelled, do I have reason to hope?  Let us know"
,Rubus65,2011-03-26T13:01Z,"as FAR as I know, but fear works too"
,Rubus65,2011-03-26T13:02Z,"Ooops... wrong show, for some reason I thought we were talking about SGU... never mind"

,applecakes,2011-03-26T18:03Z,"25,000 downloads in 6 hours?! Does Fox know Fringe has so many tech savvy diehard fans?? No way this show should be canceled, but Fox really needs to rework their content distribution to tap into this market... "
,The_Harlequin,2011-03-26T22:39Z,Cheers!
,Murugain,2011-03-27T18:31Z,"Fringe for 4th season, that's the best news, n' i agree with @applecakes"
,cheesboy,2011-03-28T08:49Z,"Thanks eztv! You rock the cock!

@Rubus65 it are true, believe it ;]"
,maxymail,2011-03-28T11:39Z,"content distribution to tap into this market... I'd buy that for a dollar, maybe even two dollars.. especially if I knew it was going towards the writer, actors, crew, studio etc."

,munki77,2011-04-01T04:49Z,"yea im here in spain and cant get fringe in english so if there was a way 2 get an ""offical"" copy of each episode i would pay a $ or 2 but for now keep up the good work EZTV!"
,Ganawa,2011-04-02T10:30Z,"set a place in internet where I, living in Europe, could watch these shows in streaming with some subtitles to choose. I'd pay for it, a month subscription. Don't give me crapy dubbed versions on tv with tons of commercials one year later, that's so lame!!   
Shows like this one, Caprica or SGU would survive "
,patdude,2011-04-03T11:44Z,Where is E19? It looks like Fringe is on yet ANOTHER break? How many do they need?
,abernick00,2011-04-05T01:28Z,"the show was renewed... it was all over TV. i dont know what i would do without this show... maybe the same as i did when Battlestar Galactica ended after four seasons...  bummed out....  but, Fringe will be back next season guys!"
,konking,2011-04-05T17:04Z,I'm also for a pay per download method of distribution for this series & others. I'm a shift worker & have to d'load if I want to watch as I don't have a hard drive recorder. Get with the 21st century FOX!

I would be a fool to ever pay high retail prices at places like Walmart or Bestbuy again. I even sold a 37""  HDTV to my boss for $600 that I only paid $78.24 for. I use  SnagBids.com"

Make sure to use a program like Peer Block while you download and upload. Anyways, great upload like always EZTV you are the man! or girl! whatever you are! lol"
