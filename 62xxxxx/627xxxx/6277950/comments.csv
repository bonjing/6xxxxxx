,Micktory,2011-05-10T00:00Z,"New update from steam, blocks this and it erased all my hattori saves"
,Bad213Boy,2011-05-26T05:32Z,"Figured out how to use this on ALL UPDATES!

Extract file. Only copy Steamclient.dll to the main game directory and AWESOMENESS!"
,spinitup,2011-05-29T05:04Z,"@Micktory:

You can avoid this by preventing Steam from automatically updating your Shogun 2 game. I think that process requires you to right click the game in your Library and change settings that way; there's not the option in the main Steam options window."
,Kamianbu,2011-07-28T14:21Z,"Got it, updated, played it and... it works XD

@Knaster
Collecter's edition is limited Edition. Both are the same, just different words


Now only if there was an Unlocker for the Ikko Ikki"
,TheXand,2011-09-30T17:23Z,"Fyi to everyone, this doesn't work and hasn't worked for months now. All it does is causes a crash. Look elsewhere for a Hattori clan unlocker because this one is obsolete."
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-01T23:46Z,"@ TheXand
