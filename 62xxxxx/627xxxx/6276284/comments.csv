,R2d6.51,2011-04-24T04:49Z,"Hey I looked at what you put together in this Discography & I don't even have the words to show my appreciation, except to say bless your heart & many thanks.. 

Morrison was the man when I was growing up near Hollywood as a young teenager going to the Strip & hang-in with th Doors at the Whiskey & Gazzari's,

I saw them all the time there & partied up off Sepulveda pass & Mulholland during those days.

Brings back so many memories of living in the 60's.

Rare stuff!!

Love Ya

Again, this is collectors stuff indeed. an't "
