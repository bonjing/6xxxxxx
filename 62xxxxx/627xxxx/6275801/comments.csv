The screen you are seeing just means that the windows system files are corrupted. This either means that a: windows didn't install correctly, or b: there is something wrong with the install files.

Try installing windows again with the same files/disc you used the first time. If it boots, problem solved 

If that doesn't work, that means that there is something wrong with the setup files and you need to find a different source to obtain windows. Use these new, different files/discs to install windows and it should work fine.

If that still doesn't work, then yes, you unfortunately have a glitch on the HDD, the Bios, or in anywhere of 150 different places. 

For the final attempt, google your computer's model and try to find the instructions on how to reset your bios to default. after doing that, install windows again..... Still not working..... then I'm afraid that you've got a hard drive glitch......

Hope this helps...."

I recommend deleting this torrent, as it seems useless."
