,BrokenEmpires,2011-03-27T16:09Z,props. of the 1GB version now I can fit it inside a drive and play it on the 360
,DontPissMeOff,2011-03-27T23:28Z,"Stick it inside ur arse and play it on whatever you want. Can't you record 4.37GB on a DVD-RW? No one who has just a little respect for film will watch it in the best possible quality, so people,  stop wasting bandwith on releasing BR-shit-rips. It pisses me off."

,mailer666,2011-04-13T04:58Z,"Video quality is bad.  There is a perpetual haze of transparent pixels running across the entire movie.

It's especially noticeable on white walls, and white objects etc.    

Playback was actually choppy at times with this video?!?

Render botch job?"

,kukki2,2011-04-14T17:12Z,"Yup. Its same thing as you may have noticed with ""black swan"". It's filmed as it looks ""grain"" or realistic, not sure about technical word for it. This rip is as good as it can be. Thanks for up!"
