i got a suggestion .. why u dont gather a team , get'em to know the steps to rip and upload .. all under ur supervision .. i mean something like aXXo .. and let it be yIFy .. it'll be easy to find ppl with the same specification u like "" broadband speed .. etc "" .. 

it's all for helping and getting this thing bigger for all the p2p world and ur fans .. 

all in all, thank u :)"

,bungunners,2012-04-27T17:00Z,"Hey man, thank you so much for this.  But I have to warn people now, that I received a copyright notice from NBC Universal on this specific torrent.  When I first got the notice and saw NBC I immediately thought it was because I downloaded Saturday Night Live season 1,2 and 3.  But thankfully in the notice it lists just this movie.  I'm stunned by this because I'm seeding at least a 100 movies and this stupid 8 year old movie got their attention.  No I'm not an NBC employee...I'm just a broke ass nigga who's only entertainment comes from the internet...So unfortunately I had to stop seeding this one torrent.  I thank you Yify for providing for us and in the same breath I'm sorry to the rest for not seeding anymore."
