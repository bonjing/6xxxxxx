i got a suggestion .. why u dont gather a team , get'em to know the steps to rip and upload .. all under ur supervision .. i mean something like aXXo .. and let it be yIFy .. it'll be easy to find ppl with the same specification u like "" broadband speed .. etc "" ..

it's all for helping and getting this thing bigger for all the p2p world and ur fans ..

all in all, thank u :) 

i copied it here cuz u r here :X"

i got a suggestion... if you remove ending cridits like you did with ""King Kong"" it will save 10% of size or more and it's not important to be 720p, so 10% faster download and seed.."
