RELEASE NOTES

The world financial crisis forced the most governments to pull back
their coalition troops from the Iraq and Afghanistan. And thus, the
responsibility for keeping the order in these countries fell on the
USA.

But soon, acts of illegal infiltration of the armed groups to the
Tajikistan territory became more frequent and unprecedented pace of
drug-trafficking began.

All this has led to a real threat of the national interests of Russia
and in August 2015 began "ten-day war" between Russia and the U.S.
