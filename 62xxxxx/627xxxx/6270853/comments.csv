Howard gives an update on where he stands with Artie. Debbie the Pet Lady calls in, angry at Howard. And Howard plays clips from Richard and Salâs St. Patrickâs Day street interviews.

If you have trouble with audio its more than likely that your media player cant play this .mp4 file...

Try VLC media player. WORKS GREAT."
