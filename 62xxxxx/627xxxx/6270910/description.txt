Ch4 Japans Tsunami How it Happened HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Japan's Tsunami: How It Happened investigates the science behind the earthquake and tsunami that has devastated Japan. It takes viewers on a journey with Professor of Geological Sciences Roger Bilham - in Japan only days after the earthquake struck. The programme follows Roger as he sets off to view the devastation from the air. In the magnitude 9 earthquake Japan shifted 12 feet towards the US. The earth was knocked off its axis and the rate of the earth's rotation was changed. This was one of the biggest earthquakes every measured: the ground along the east side of Japan dropped by almost 10 feet, making the tsunami catastrophic. This documentary also follows renowned journalist Callum Macrae as he travels to the north, where the towns of Sendai and Ofunato used to be bustling fishing villages.
