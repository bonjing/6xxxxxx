,Slam12345,2011-05-07T16:02Z,"@AmandaT
there are only two ways of doing it...
1: burn it to BlueRay disc or
2: put on external harddrive and connect to ps3 and either play from external or copy to internal.

way 2 will need 3.55 CFW and backup manager, unsure about 1"
,metro2033,2011-05-08T19:10Z,"Lolwut , guys no need to burn to a bluray disc , just get your ps3 hacked with cfw 3.55 ,instal manager ( rogero is best) , do a cross-cable internet connection between your pc and ps3 copy the game to hdd 0 / GAMEZ and PLAY .I know this is not gona help to much ..but you can try watching tutorials on youtube or something like that . By the way is working , great game!"

,bttrfly85,2011-10-05T21:46Z,Can you upload this in English and is there anyone out there that can speak dummy language about how to burn PS3 games to a disc?
,max_demon,2011-10-07T08:58Z,"Follow this and it is should change dialogue and menus back to english. These 3 items need to be modified:

1-PARAM.SFO
2-PS3_DISC.SFB
3-GAME_FOLDER (to BCUS98119)
as per instructions below

To unlock other languages (English), you have to change the game ID to BCUS98119.

1 - For this we use an application called PS3SFOEdit, execute the program and open the file inside the folder PS3_GAME \ PARAM.SFO
Then just change where it says Disc Title ID: put BCUS-98119, save the file.

2 - Now open Notepad and changed the PS3_DISC.SFB Disc Title ID for BCUS-98119.

3 - Then just create a folder on an external disk or transfer to internal GAMEZ folder (renamed BCUS98119 like usual)


Let me know if this fixes it. You should be able to apply this to other games as well to get whatever language u want out of them. "
