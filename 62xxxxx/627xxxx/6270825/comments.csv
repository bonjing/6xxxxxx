The movie is really, really bad though, easily worst I've seen so far this year, but for those looking for some easy action it might do, if you can ignore the total lack of imagination and apparent copy paste."

It's a decent movie.. nothing extraordinary though. There's a lot of fight scenes, but I wish they were better. They're too many cuts in them, they cut after every punch or kick. It doesn't feel like real fights. Needs more gore and longer clips. 

The acting is quite bad. The only ones really acting is Geoffrey Rush and Danny Huston. Dong-Gun Jang's and Kate Bosworth's performances are very bland. Tony Cox, yes the black midget, is an awful actor. Quite obviously as he was only casted because he's a midget. 

The story is very simple, and there's really no surprises. The guy is the greatest swordsman in the world, and he's unstoppable, without a single weakness - making the character a quite uninteresting hero. A hero must have weaknesses to be interesting, it adds depth to the character. This guy can't die. Which would have been alright if the fight scenes were more dramatic..  But it is this unstoppable hero that makes the movie less entertaining. You won't feel a connection with the main character in this movie. He's too powerful. 

There's no sex in this movie and there's nothing explicit or anything gory for that matter. 

It all falls down on the directors shoulders, an amateur film maker. This is his first movie ever. For a rookie, he did a pretty good job. 

Watch this movie if you're really bored and when there's nothing else to watch. But don't be downloading this movie expecting it to be brilliant, cause it's not. Expect the worst and you might like it. Had someone posted this comment before I watched this movie, I wouldn't have watched it. It's not worth it.

If you want an awesome ninja/samurai/swordsmen movie - you'll want to watch ""13 Assassins"" (recently uploaded on TB in DvDr), it's a great action movie."

The movie itself is a bloated steaming carcass stuffed with rotting poop.  But hey, don't take my word for it, take the word of the 13-22 year olds on this site who say it's awesome.

Forget that the acting sucks, forget that the sets are total CGI fake looking, forget that the story movies slowly, forget that the fighting is totally fake looking, forget that the martial arts are completely unrealistic, forget all of this!  Why?  Because it's violent as hell.  Isn't that what you want to see?  A stupid childrens movie full of violence and cruelty?  

If so then this is your movie."
