,n8schicht,2011-03-29T19:19Z,"Apple? ROFL! Go buy a REAL Multimedia Centre, muahahaha ^^

@extremezone: Thanks a lot buddy! Cool movie, excellent quality, great upload!"
,jasonbourne0310,2011-03-30T09:17Z,"It definitely a good copy.
I have heard from my friends about certain communities who use these files as source and re-encode them to small sized br-rips in mkv format.
In fact i got ""The Warriors Way"" brrip which is only 700MB!!
Video quality is excellent, i don't know why the scene release groups are not doing that!"

,wolf10,2011-04-01T13:15Z,LMAO...  who the fuck uses MP4 and M4V???

SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte 

blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

MVH.

PS: Ni fÃ¥r vÃ¤ldigt gÃ¤rna kopiera och skriva denna kommentar pÃ¥ alla torrenter ni laddar upp 

och ner, tack!

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

PS: Feel free to copy and spread this to all torrents you download and upload, please!"

First, this is .mkv, so...?

Second .mp4 is a great way to use h.264 coded movies in, so once again.. why the fuck wouldnt anyone? More bit rate etc on smaller file then avi for ex.."
