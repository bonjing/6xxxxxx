,1343,2011-03-29T00:08Z,"Showtime?  My ass!  Thank the British for the original, much funnier version by the same name."
,keitherton,2011-03-29T01:49Z,It's too bad assholes like @1343 know how to use the comment system.  
,tgbiker53,2011-03-29T01:56Z,i cant understand the british version and I like the amercian acters better espically kev and the black girl!
,spike68,2011-03-29T04:09Z,"hahaha love this show.

,Thrice626,2011-03-30T06:09Z,"I love British tv/humor and first knew of Shameless from the Brits. While most British shows don't convert well when Americanized (i.e. IT Crowd), the US version of Shameless is great. America got it right this time (no knock on the UK version, it's great too). Thanks VTV!!!!"
,vpnuser,2011-03-30T09:55Z,"it's a great show no matter what side of the pond it's playing. the us version is real good but the english version is so damned funny. if you like the show, you should try the english one too. plus they're already up to season 8 over there. season one u.s. is almost identical to series one u.k."
,vpnuser,2011-03-30T09:57Z,and...thanks vtv for the uploads!
,23creative,2011-04-14T15:00Z,"thanks VTV have d/loaded all episodes from you.. nice one mate!
I am from the U.K  and i have to say both versions are just as good, Paul Abbot (the writer) was involved in the U.S  version and it shows, I have really enjoyed it.. BUT for all of you that have not seen the U.K version.. i highly recommend it.. but wait a while because the U.S  version is basically the same story."
,axerine,2011-07-04T22:56Z,Cheers
,ahorwood,2011-08-27T01:05Z,"It's pretty rare that the comments on the Bay actually make me change my mind about anything, except whether or not to download, but you guys have convinced me to watch the original version. Thanks, and thanks to VTV. "
