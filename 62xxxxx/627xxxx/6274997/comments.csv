,asif_apshari,2011-03-27T13:50Z,"thnx buddy,,,,great upload"
,luckyman36,2011-03-27T18:09Z,"Great upload! 
Does anybody know where to get english subtitles ?"
,griiid,2011-03-27T22:48Z,"no english subs!?
how awful when they speak portuguese..."
[V],aoloffline,2011-03-28T00:54Z,"The encoder said that will try to add english subs.Wait until tomorrow,and if subs will be available i will post a link"
,VitalogyPJ,2011-03-28T01:38Z,"@griiid how awful when you speak english.

The problem isn't the language, it's the one who's listening/reading it. Maybe it's time for you to go back to school and educate yourself a bit more before saying nonsence and bash other languages.

Yes, I'm Portuguese with very proud!

Great UP."
,EiNST3iN2020,2011-03-28T01:50Z,if you don't speak portuguese this movie is useless.  i look forward to hardcoded english subs.
,griiid,2011-03-28T11:55Z,"Haha what!? You should be proud of your ayrton and that brazil has produced a world legend. And dont tell me that I must learn your language.. how rude. I hope that is not a typical brazilian behavior ;)?

Thanks for the info. Looking forward to the subs."
,battie83,2011-03-28T17:14Z,"Quick question if anybody can help. 

Why is this movie 2hours 42min when IMDB and other torrents say it's runtime is only 102min???? 

Someone please help this is giving me brain ache. Is there 2 versions of this movie???"
,X45JKD,2011-03-28T17:45Z,"@ griiid
Did u even look at your own post?

griiid at 2011-03-27 22:48 CET:
no english subs!?
how awful when they speak portuguese...

And you wonder why someone might take offense? Then you have the nerve to make racist comments AND call the victim of your offense rude?

You need to get your head on straight.

Either you're stupid, racist, or both. As an American, I really hope you're not one. I would be so embarrassed to have you as a compatriot.

@aoloffline
Thanks :)"
,gold333,2011-03-28T18:04Z,"Is this seriously a 720P blueray rip of the 2010 Senna movie??

How is that possible seeing as the Blueray (or even DVD) has not even been release?

Isn't this just a CAM?

PS: And yeah, how is it almost 3 hours long if the real version is 100 minutes?"
,X45JKD,2011-03-28T18:39Z,"the rips come out before the blurays - you can check for yourself with other posts

The runtime is probably just a typo"
,battie83,2011-03-28T18:41Z,It is the real deal 720p just can't work out why this version is long!!
,battie83,2011-03-28T18:42Z,"I got the subs from another upload but, there for the 100min version!!"
,battie83,2011-03-28T18:43Z,Not a typo it is that long.
,gold333,2011-03-28T19:31Z,"If it is not a typo and really 3 hours long it must be a weird version, as the official movie is 104 minutes.

As for English subs, if you search the name of the file together with English subtitles you will find several subtitles at a few sites. I've found 2 versions of the .srt. One is 170kb the other is 80kb. Perhaps these are the different movie lengths?
The portuguese translation at the start is dubious at best (like a software translation).

If anyone finds a good english translation please tell us."
,Robrein,2011-03-28T20:28Z,"First of all, X45JKD, it is quite rude to call someone stupid just because he doesn't know portugeese. It's about the same as I called you a cucumber because you don't know latvian.
And, I know, it's modern too notice racism in every peoples sentence or action, but just chill...

About movie... I guess it's some kind of directors cut, because it is really 2 hours 42 minutes all about Ayrton.
And about subtitles... I'm desperate for them. Every ones that can be found, as already mentioned, are from shortest movie.

[V],aoloffline,2011-03-28T22:16Z,"english subs(i think they are for non english parts only..did not see this doc yet)

,battie83,2011-03-28T23:16Z,"big thanks man, these work. Good job"
,VitalogyPJ,2011-03-29T02:00Z,"@griiid you definitely got the nerve ain't you? What a poor soul you are. In regard to your poor comment, the second one of that kind, I couldn't say better than what X45JKD said already.

Oh and other thing, please don't ever do a value-judgement like the ones you did, because besides the rudeness you already showed it shows also some ignorance. Why? Simple, because I said I was Portuguese, not brasilian, but because Brasil speaks Portuguese language which is native from Portugal I felt insulted by a stupid racist comment of yours and then again you beated yourself and tried to twist the whole thing against me, and that sir defines your character, or a lack of one I must say.

Have a nice life."
,VitalogyPJ,2011-03-29T02:04Z,"@Robrein you sir made me laugh hard there.

""First of all, X45JKD, it is quite rude to call someone stupid just because he doesn't know portugeese.""

Can you quote where, me or X45JKD, ever said that? Oh dear...

So, it is rude to say they should learn Portuguese instead of bash the language but it's not rude to say, and I'll quote ""how awful when they speak portuguese"".

Don't comment just for comment, read carefuly first."
,Robrein,2011-03-29T10:12Z,"@VitalogyPJ
""...Maybe it's time for you to go back to school and educate yourself a bit more before saying nonsence and bash other languages...""

Just a little quote from you.
I understand that you think different, but portugeese isn't top language to learn, but you think that everybody should know it. And that's what I picked up from your comment.

@aoloffline
Big thanks ;)"
,VitalogyPJ,2011-03-29T11:55Z,"@Robrein don't put words in my mouth please, that sentence you've just quoted don't say anywhere that I think everybody should learn Portuguese. What I said and meant to (if people knew how to interpret texts) is that instead of bash or trash talk about some other language just before you don't understand it then probably it's time to educate yourself a bit more.

English isn't my native language neither is spanish or french or italian and I can understand them all, it's a matter of culture and education.

And probably a bit of history wouldn't hurt people as well because Portuguese may not be top in your country but it's one of the most spoken languages around the world. But I am  not here to compare or say what's better than what I just want people to respect the next for one.

I think this subject has enough already said.

Again, great UP aoloffline."
,evian85r,2011-03-29T14:15Z,Big thanks for the subs aoloffline! thumbs up 
,Robrein,2011-03-29T16:30Z,"@VitalogyPJ
Then it's just misunderstanding :)
And we live in different parts of europe. For me more useful is to know russian, german, of course english and my native latvian.

But anyway... Peace and also enormous thanks to aoloffline. This evening will be Sennas night :)

Would like to see it better in cinema, but premiere is only in june and no cinema in Latvia is planning to show it, so only answer is piracy :("
,victor.brazil.qwerty,2011-03-31T20:17Z,"God, this guy makes me so proud to be a brazilian! he was extraordinary inside and outside the raceway. Patriot but only in a positive way.

PS Ayrton Senna institute founded by him and managed by his sister Viviane nowadays helps children in need very efective. http://senna.globo.com/institutoayrtonsenna/"
,griiid,2011-03-31T20:21Z,"X45JKD!
I might have picked the wrong word ""awful"" i can agree on that.

Im sorry that my english is not that good as yours, we none americans have to learn 2 more languages in school so not every language is perfect. How dare you call me a racist... shame on you!"
,griiid,2011-03-31T20:24Z,"X45JKD!

So funny that a single word got you calling me racist. If you know me at all you wouldnt dare to do so.
Anyway sweden says hello."
,tbone3181,2011-03-31T20:39Z,"lol at all you muppets spouting nonsense about racism and rudeness. any of you stop to notice that the guy who made the comment hasnt really responded? i shall tell you why...BECAUSE HE WAS SAYING THAT IT WAS BAD THAT IT HAD NO SUBS BECAUSE ITS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE!! then an (obviously) portuguese dude misinterpreted the word awful to mean that his language is awful.....hence why griiid replied by saying ""what!?"" Fools the lot of you"
,tbone3181,2011-03-31T20:45Z,"Incidentally this extended version is insightful but very poorly edited. it abruptly cuts from the movie (with music playing) to some extra interviews, and then back to where the movie left off. its very jarring, not to mention a lot of the interviews have poor picture quality and much lower (and also poorer) sound. rare case of extended being worse. still a great doc about a great man tho"
,bighimey,2011-04-01T11:54Z,"This is definitely an extended version of the 2010 film.

Despite there being a lot more interviews and talking, as a film, the theatrical release is far superior.  It flows better as a story.

Please watch the shorter version first, if you want to more about the man and F1 at the time, watch this after."
,victor.brazil.qwerty,2011-04-03T13:34Z,"this is the same as as senna 2010 dvd, the version released in brazil only exlcudes the coments from foreing people. My gosh... if you ever need some motivation in life, or more close to senna's personality, try to see this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5997202/F1_Classics_A_Star_Named_Ayrton_Senna_AVi you will see that talent is as important as determinaton. Gosh, i would like thgis so much besides being rich and partying"
,killem2,2011-04-07T14:16Z,"Much better quality.  This is a documentary.  If the theatrical version drops the foreign narration when it shoes ayrton in car for english voices perfect, and then use subs for parts when his family is speaking.

Great version so far."

,telquinn,2011-05-22T10:05Z,"Really touching film, I'm 31 and watched the tradgedy live and i shed a few tears watching it again. Note on the file, the english commentry version is annoying and removes any emotion and the portuguese version (from an english POV) is watchable but i couldn't get any sub-titles to work if there were any present.

OLE-OLE-OLE-OLE-SENNA-SENNA!!!"

,Shakurazz,2011-06-18T19:13Z,"So I just want to figure something out: is there a theatrical ENGLISH version of this film to download? This one – http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6272089/Senna.2010.DVDRip.Dual.Audio – as far as I understood, is Portuguese. And if there isn't an English one, maybe after the film's release in the U. S.
