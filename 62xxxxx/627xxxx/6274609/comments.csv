[T],Tyr3ll,2011-04-09T07:41Z,"guysss,i repeat :
give enough upload from your part if you want an acceptable download speed.
45 ko/s minimum up speed for this torrent.
Otherwise don't cry if you get slow download.
remember this is still the same deal between you and i so.
Ty !

[T],Tyr3ll,2011-04-13T18:41Z,"got serious problems with certain peers and especialy on azureus and with few ips from India who are completely ruining my seed !
guys,please,review your personal connection...
You make huge problems on my upload and the other peers cannot continue their download by your fault !
use utorrent instead of azureus or vuze who can make hard conflict on upload when not correctly set or fixed so.
Ty for understanding so.
regards"

,cisco7819,2012-06-17T04:00Z,"Try3ll, excuse my stupidity but how do you use the 
pat (I assume it is the file ending in SFV)? Where does that go? I've scanned the install folder but couldn't find where it should go. Or maybe I'm just not reading something right."
