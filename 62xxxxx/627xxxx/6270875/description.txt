But again, back to the conspiracy crap, if you read the crap that Nixon did in his bag of dirty tricks in campaigning...what he said about Scoop Jackson during the campaign...and whose psych office did they break into. These people do routinely pull crap on citizens, out of what excuse...Freedom. Than it isn't freedom...

The only time I admired Bush's response to anything was when he had the shoes thrown at him...it was like that whack a mole game...one shoe flew by and Bush ducked and then...popped up and looked..OK throw the next one...and then they took the guy back...who of all things threw a shoe at the man responsible for destroying his country on the false justification of 9 11 and WMD, both lies...the man threw a shoe, even just two shoes....do you know what they did to him...they beat the crap out of the guy...their own citizen as Bush continued his speech...in the next room in the name Freedom....the Iraq's beat the crap out of their own citizen and then imprisoned him. In the name of Freedom. At what point do we realize we have no Freedom, that is lies, just lies, just lies.
