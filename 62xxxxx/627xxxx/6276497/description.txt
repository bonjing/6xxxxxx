"Love is a Many Strangled Thing"

When Homer inadvertently humiliates Bart in front 
of a stadium crowd, Marge encourages Homer to 
enroll in a fathering enrichment class taught by 
therapist Dr. Zander (guest voice Rudd). Shocked 
to learn that Homer often strangles Bart for 
mischievous behavior, Dr. Zander conducts a 
series of treatments with the help of Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar (guest-voicing as himself) to teach 
Homer what it feels like to be young and small. 
But when Bart learns that the therapy sessions 
have transformed Homer into a pushover, he takes 
advantage of Homer and becomes a school bully. 
Hoping therapy could also cure Bart of his 
bullying habits, Marge enlists Dr. Zander's help 
to patch their relationship.

Enjoy :)
