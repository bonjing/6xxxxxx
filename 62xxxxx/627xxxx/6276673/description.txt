Race #5 for the cup aired on 3/27/2011

Ok fellow race fans here is race #5, you maybe wondering why this one is smaller than the rest. Well unfortunately the weather gave me some troubles and there is some spots in the middle of the race that I had to cut due to being too garbled to process. If their were others releasing this then I would have just scraped this recording. As it stands I did what I could with it for those needing their Nascar fix  hopefully this will get ya through. So their may be some glitches but still for the most part is good to go.
