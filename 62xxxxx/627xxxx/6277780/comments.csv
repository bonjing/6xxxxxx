indeed I respect Prophet Jesus and his religion & let me tell you that if don't then I can't be muslim since thats what our religion orders us. And no you can't judge on islam by the deeds of those, the only way to judge is to learn what this religion orders his followers,,,, can one judge on your entire family by what you do!!!! most families have good and bad members and I cant tell that the family is good or bad unless I meet them all or at least knowing what the family leader order them then it is not his fault that some or all of them did'nt obey 

so can I judge on christian based on what the US army did in Iraq( remember the cross that was hanged on a tank's canon)??Vietnam??japan(2nd WW)?? 
Or the most powerful support for Israel to kill children & elderly & even the inncocent youth in palastine, (& please don't tell me that those who fight for their country are terrorists too),,,of caurse if I do you will be looser but I don't Because I know what is real christianity   

And about the aim of muslims in killing unbelievers!!!!! I think you never read quran, If you did then you will have noticed that It only ask for killing those who try to kill you first, and please look for this sentence in quran  Surat Al-MÄ'idah ayah 32(((whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely)))

and this in Surat Al-'An`Äm ayah 151 (((Say, ""Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason."")))

and please look carefully at this one that tell to fight only those who fight you:
Surat Al-Baqarah, ayah 190  (((Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.)))

please know before you judge on anything

best regards all
Ahmad"
