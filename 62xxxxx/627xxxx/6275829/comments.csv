,Angelus1609,2011-03-27T18:51Z,I watched these after ripping them and they all worked perfect for me. Let me know how they worked out for you guys. Don't forget to seed. Thanks
,Angelus1609,2011-03-27T20:09Z,I used VLC player to watch them so I can't say for sure about Windows Media Player
,Teumeusseuk,2011-04-01T15:18Z,I'm stuck at 97% please seed ^
,nostar,2011-04-02T01:39Z,"me too, it was like 3 day ago, what is going on ?"
,Teumeusseuk,2011-04-02T16:34Z,"I don't Know, everything was working well, then no seeders anymore ! This Sucks !! (You can Wath with the 97% on VLC but sometimes it stopes for a few seconds in the movie, like it stops 4 times, 6 seconds each, Not that big deal after all, better than waiting for a dead Torrrent)"
,Teumeusseuk,2011-04-04T13:00Z,"It's Finally Working and i got it all, Thanks to those who answered my ask ! I'm Seeiding too ;)"
,Angelus1609,2011-04-04T23:14Z,"That was my bad guys. My apologies. I was seeding and didn't realize I had accidentally stopped the torrent while setting up a new torrent. Thanks for waiting guys and hope you enjoy the movies.

Peace, 
Angelus"
