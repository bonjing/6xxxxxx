,nofil,2011-08-04T16:48Z,where'd you get 24 bit from?
,icarusflying,2011-09-06T04:03Z,did not work. song starts but then is muted. waste of time
,music6,2011-10-11T17:53Z,"Well, files are mpeg-4 so I had to convert them to the mp3, but overall a great torrent, fast download so thanks"
,MrSalty,2011-11-23T21:04Z,"I can assure you, this is the studio master, in Itunes lossless format, ready for itunes.  Every file works perfectly.  Please note though, not all devices support 24bit audio quality and this would explain why one person above is having issues. 

As this is lossless, please feel free to convert to a format of your choice, at no loss of quality, as this is the finest you will find of this great album.

Cheers."
