I use stuffit and zipeg on my mac.  Is there another program that may work better?  Or is anyone else having problems with this?"
,nzvegan,2011-03-30T06:20Z,Same problem as above.
,alafar85,2011-03-30T23:40Z,Thank you .. worked perfectly with me on my PC... :D
,themorningstar69,2011-03-31T08:15Z,"Hey nzvegan, I used SimplyRAR for Mac to unzip and it worked just fine, I have checked it and it works great.  Just wanted to pass that along if you are still having problems, it is a free download.  Anxious to watch this one, I love Winslet"
,andrewv44,2011-07-16T23:16Z,"The file hasn't been properly compressed, but SimplyRAR somehow manages to uncompress it, Stuffit kept asking for other pieces on the mac, frankly I dont understand why in 2011 we are still rar splitting, no need to do it, it causes unnecessary problems, dont mean to be unthankful, I really appreciate the time taken to upload and create these torrents but just thought I might mention this..."
