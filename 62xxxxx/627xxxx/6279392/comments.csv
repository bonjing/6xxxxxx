,DeanMachine16,2011-03-29T18:00Z,"The video and audio looked and sounded great for the most part but mine was slightly out of synch towards the end.
Seemed fine in the beginning but by the time I reached the Rock's segment it was off by a half a second or so. 
Not much, but enough to be annoying after awhile. :-(

Anyone else experience this?"
