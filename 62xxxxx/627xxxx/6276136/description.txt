[color=blue][size=5][b]The Mechanic 2011 BDRip READNFO Special- HQ Hive-CM8[/b][/size][/color]



[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Why download a touched up rip of a rip BRrip
Get the real deal BDRip
Enjoy

This is another special of mine, more than 20hours work, took me the whole weekend. 
Source is still the russian bluray or telecine,whatever you want to call that source.
i am sure you noticed the black bars floating around in the movie.
from above,below,left and right along with skrewed video and a mixture of all at once.
I splitted the bluray in around 100 pieces and treated every piece differently as needed.
Only the 2-10 secs scenes were the bars appear are cropped and resized.
the main movie is still nearly uncropped.
you shouldnt even notice that there were the bars. 
looks like a real bdrip now.
this will definetaly do till the R1 retail in a month.
i also sharpened it, played with the rgb a bit,and denoised it
Looks perfect now.
also attached a longer sample at a place were some different bars were visible.
audio is from the best available source, the 5.1 audiomix from my r5 version with the best 
parts from iNK and imagines lines inside the russian track.
still thx guys

hope you appreciate my really long work on it.
this cant be done better with this source.
And as the cover of the movie says: "someone has to fix the problems"

Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a 'mechanic' - an elite assassin with a strict code 
and unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets. It's a job that requires professional 
perfection and total detachment, and Bishop is the best in the business. But when his mentor 
and close friend Harry (Donald Sutherland) is murdered, Bishop is anything but detached.
