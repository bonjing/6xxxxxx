Somebody please advise."
,eiwru,2011-04-09T22:52Z,"Well, for starters, it's mkv, which is extremely annoying.
None of my equipment at home can play that.
Sure I can watch it on my PC, but I'll have to install yet another codec and/or program.
Converting it to a DVD, Blue Ray or whatever disc takes forever, but at least I can then finally watch it in my livingroom on my TV.
But the subtitles probably will not be synchronized, although the sound USUALLY is.

Luckily there is an alternative: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3538488/Falling_Down_(Michael_Douglas)_-_Pal_Multilanguaje_Multisubs"
,felacio,2011-04-12T17:14Z,eiwru you are such a loser. hd video on torrent sites is only encoded with the mkv container. buy a standalone player like wdtv (it is dirt cheap) and enjoy the future. or else continue living in the 90's with your dvds. lol 
,Global_Warfare,2011-04-19T09:24Z,thx!
,Skram0,2011-06-05T06:57Z,"eiwru! Get XBMC. You can play MKVs, AVIs, ISOs, WMVs, M2TSs, and lots of others. MKVs are only getting better with time with more embedded functions like menus and many others. MKV is a really versatile container. Do a search for MKV and learn a little. Knowledge goes a long way.

Side note; the link you provided is PAL 25fps. Unsure if this torrent is PAL also. But can be a problem for us NTSC 23.976fps folks."
