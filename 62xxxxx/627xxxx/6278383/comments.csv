@TTNandR
if you wan´t seriously to make a good rip, use EAC and go for 100% quality.  Than include the EAC logs to your UL"

,emil2012,2012-02-13T21:08Z,@TTNandR You don't need to worry much about the 'quality' settings in flac as it is always lossless. Where you need to be careful is ripping the cd itself. If you are ripping an older or remotely scratched cd (google how to clean cd or how to repair cd). Use a good ripping program with cdparanoia and set it to 'full'. Nice job.
