,WilliamDaWillz11,2011-08-08T10:36Z,"Hey dude, I have a quick question. I've never done a torrent considering I've ran into maybe a small thing. I know how to upload a file, but how do I upload multiple files(as in a folder/aka upload the folder with the files in it) as a torrent. I'll further investigate myself, but can you assist? thanks."
,WilliamDaWillz11,2011-08-08T10:40Z,"And btw, is this torrent literally 320kbps? iTunes' mainly represent a 256kbps quality."
