,chuckasarus,2011-03-27T21:21Z,the keygen produces a 15 digit key and it requires a 18. How is this done?
,puunjab,2011-03-28T06:03Z,"1) Install both programs and just cancel when it gets to the part about licensing and choose never register.

2) The Keygen won't work if you try to activate during the initial install. The number it generates is 15 digits and it is correct, but it is not for this screen.


3) After the installer closes navigate to the application folder. You do this step once for each program.

4) Inside the program's folder is a program called license manager. 

5) Run the license manager and choose import certificate.

6) Import certificate is their version of an off-line over the phone installer. The 15 digit number works fine here.

7) Even though the keygen doesn't ask for it, it uses the Installation ID that appears in the license manager to generate the unlocking key. Until you install the software the keygen won't generate any number. This is why."
,puunjab,2011-03-28T06:06Z,"Thanks. Both programs works like a champ and that keygen generates an unlimited license. Just follow my instructions. 

The instructions are in the torrent, but it wasn't very clear why the program wanted 18 digits and the keygen only generates 15. "
,chuckasarus,2011-03-28T14:51Z,Worked perfectly! Thank you for all your help!
,Omarlim,2011-04-17T13:24Z,is it for windows?
,ned8,2011-05-04T12:21Z,"Dont work !
Once installed software, the keygen won't generate any number.
The number generate by: 
-license manager / import certificate-
only show 14 digits (like: 0000-0000-0000)
