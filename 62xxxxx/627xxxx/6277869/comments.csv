Nine-year-old Milo (Seth Green, voice-over by Seth Dusky) finds out just how much he needs his mom (Joan Cusack) when she's kidnapped by Martians who plan to steal her ""momness"" for their own young.

Milo's quest to save his mom involves stowing away on a spaceship, navigating an elaborate, multi-level planet and taking on the alien nation and their leader, the Supervisor (Mindy Sterling). With the help of tech-savvy underground Earthman Gribble (Dan Fogler), his bionic underground pet Two-Cat (Dee Bradley Baker), Duke Nukem (Jon St. John), and rebellious Martian Ki (Elisabeth Harnois), Milo finds his way back to his mom."
