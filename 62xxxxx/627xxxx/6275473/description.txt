Day of the Tentacle is the sequel to Maniac Mansion, but although based on the same basic premise, is a completely different game. 
With insane artists that were seemingly taken directly from Warner Bros.' classic Road Runner, combined with the talent of the likes of Ron Gilbert, Day of the Tentacle is more than just a game: it is an insane, surreal adventure with a long and complex story.
