,citizendonny,2011-03-28T20:15Z,I cannot find the serial number. could be a fake.
,iiimend,2011-03-28T22:10Z,"thanks great upload , worked for me (Win7)


The serial included in this release is :

B2DA1ABAA0034017

here's another one:
C9DA1A8AB0066691

I dont know if this is true but thats what a user in demonoid stated:
""It seems that the serial number works if you type it in but not if you copy and paste."""

,MagiciansFR,2011-03-29T23:33Z,"Installed on Windows 7 64 bit system. Acted just like the Britannica 2010 I had installed with a serial number that was banned. Britannica installs and opens just fine, but when you try to go to an article it just stays stuck on loading and the articale never comes up, will not go to ANY article in the encyclopedia. Anyone have any ideas why?"
,jojo07,2011-04-08T14:18Z,does it really worked with mac?
,Cgoff87,2011-04-12T07:30Z,"I uploaded 2010 last year but great to see the new version. Very nice, I'm getting this one! "
,inmatestar,2011-05-10T19:38Z,runs fine on windows 7 ultimate 32 bit. great upload. thanks man
,drmunch,2011-05-17T09:53Z,"I can't make this work for some reason, tried both SN's.. After 5 tries I managed to get the installation to finish, it kept freezing at about 40% on the first bar. Now that its installed, I can't get past the opening screen asking me to ""please choose a library"". Nothing happens whatever I choose:( Also, whats ment by ""ultimate""? This says ""student and home edition"" after installing."
,pigot,2011-05-23T11:52Z,"Hi everyone, 
it seems this application wont start easely in Windows 7 64 bits (x64). I was stuck at the step 'choose a library'. What Ive done is sipple: 1) I browse my hard disk to reach the program launcher (C:\Program Files (x86)\Britannica 11.0\Ultimate Reference Suite\starter.exe)
2) right click on it's icon, menu option Properties, and after that select Compatibility tab
3) click on box titled 'Run this program in compatibility mode for""
4) Select 'Windows XP (Service Pack 3)
5) start the encyclopedy again,
6) choose a Library
7) You can switch back to Windows 7 by unchecking the compatibility box (step 2 to 4)

it works, regards, Thierry"

,Kurtrocks1996,2011-08-31T04:01Z,"Those who are stuck when installing britannica , try this
1. Search for ''resource1'' rar file among the files within Britannica DVD
2. You can browse the disc and find ''Resource1'' rar file in: BritannicaDVD/installapp/Contents/Resources/Java/ Disc1/InstData/ 
3. Unrar ''Resources1'' to your desktop (only temporarily)
4. When unrarred you wil find $WORKROOT$ folder along with a couple of jar files. Go to: $WORKROOT$/data/cd/shared/fonts, then copy all .ttf files and paste them in C:\Windows\Fonts folder 
5. Restart the installation of the Encyclopaedia (you may be asked to uninstall or delete elements of previous installation)
 6. In my case it solved the problem, hope it does in yours! Enjoy Britannica! "
