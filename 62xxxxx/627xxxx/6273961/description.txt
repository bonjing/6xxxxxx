Inspired by Kraftwerk, Yello and OFF, Markus Fix interest in electronic sounds started at the tender age of 13, and soon after that, he visited the legendary club "Omen" in Frankfurt for the first time. He was so fascinated by the music that he started to spin himself and developed a unique style. Several years and many parties later, he founded together with some friends "Project 2000" and became resident DJ at the "Helium" bar in Frankfurt. Since then, his career rose quickly through the ranks and soon, he was playing at the main room of the "CocoonClub". At that time, he was already a guarantor for ambitious music beyond the mainstream. Meanwhile, Markus Fix has become a trendsetter himself: his releases on the partner labels "CÃ©cille Records" and "Oslo" were top sellers and gained enthusiastic reviews worldwide. Also as a DJ, he belongs to the global players and elates both promoters as well as the public!
