might be your computer, not the movie file. my computer does that too when trying to watch bluray rips of that size (and bigger, of course)
anyway, try using vlc if you dont already do so"

Its your computer that sucks, not the torrent. 

These large files are meant to be watched on big screen TV and thats why large. Else just get a 700mb fiile to watch on computer screen."

Best player for big .mkv files and blurays is ""Media Player Classic - Home Cinema"" aka MPC-HC"
