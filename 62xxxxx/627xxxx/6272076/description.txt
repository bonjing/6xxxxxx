Wasn't happy with the "Limited" copy floating around so i ripped, encoded, and am uploading this one instead.

x264 in mkv container, 1.4gb with 5.1 surround sound audio. (AC3 passthrough)

Encoded with handbrake.


English subtitles included, can be enabled and disabled in your player (such as VLC).  I included the english subs because some of the actors have a thick accent and you may miss a line here or there.

Enjoy.

PLOT: 
In war-torn Eastern Europe, a world-weary group of mercenaries discover a long-hidden secret in an abandoned WWII bunker.
