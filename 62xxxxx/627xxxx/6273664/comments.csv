,negeilv,2011-03-26T21:57Z,Thnx a lot BBC & F1 = Epic broadcasting
,digimike50,2011-03-27T00:59Z,"Great stuff! Thanks very much from an expat F1 fan, in Bangkok!"
,gold333,2011-03-27T04:37Z,"Whoever uploaded this is a total noob. This file is so irritating and unwatchable.

There are frame drops where fps falls to 2fps every 15 seconds. The audio is dynamically out of synch. Yes that's right: the audio delay varies throughout the 2 hour broadcast. It starts at 4.7 seconds, then 6.2, then 10.7 then 16.7 then 19.2. It's insane trying to determine the varying delay when you don't see mouths moving in the commentary. It's just hell trying to watch this. The uploader is an idiot for uploading this like it is. Why?"
,spoo71,2011-03-27T05:12Z,Badly out of sync.  Hope someone else uploads another version of this.
,canon60D,2011-03-27T06:24Z,"whoever uploaded this pile of crap needs to die.

unwatchable due to unstable FPS.. and seriously out of sync audio/video."
,MikeR56,2011-03-27T06:38Z,"Hate to bitch. Really appreciate the upload. But please do it right if you up the race. This is totally fucked up.

M."
,YandT1,2011-03-27T07:22Z,"This is way out of sync, please try again and do it right. If not, then I hope someone else will. This should be Nuked. not even close to watchable."
,jorrell0733,2011-03-27T09:43Z,"Sincere apologies to all who downloaded this torrent, I recoded it whilst in ebd and uploaded imemdaitely only after realising that the original broadcast was messed up on my end! Out of my control im afraid, but I will continue to upload the race after checking it carefully this time!"
,jorrell0733,2011-03-27T09:47Z,"re:gold333, no need to call me a fucking idiot man! im no way a noob!, just made a mistake of not checking this file after recoding in an effort to upload asap for you guys which resulted in a messed up copy! The origianl DVB braodcast was actually messed up meaning this is what i recoded! Sorry Guys, A One Time Erroe!"
,gold333,2011-03-27T15:51Z,"@jorrell0733:
Ok man my apologies. Everyone fucks up sometimes. Lol, I was frustrated because I actually watched through the whole thing while trying to sync the audio throughout."
,BigBubbles,2011-03-27T19:58Z,"Hey jorrell0733, thank you for the torrent, it has sync problems but it was much better than nothing."
,osbjmg,2011-03-27T20:58Z,"It's good to know the problem wasn't on my end.  I used VLC to adjust the audio sync, but it got worse as the time progressed.  Oh well, I hope you have better luck next time and you have my appreciation."
,kiwijam,2011-03-28T10:41Z,"Thanks for this jorrell0733, looking forward to watching the race! Are you planning to upload all races of the season? If you can you'll be a legend! Cheers"
