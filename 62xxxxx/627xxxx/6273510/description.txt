don't forget that:

We live in a very homophobic world full of prejudice and violence against the LGBT community. Letâ€™s change the world, reeducate the world in a good, modern, tolerant spirit. 
It's only up to  an individual to identify his sexuality. Letâ€™s explain directly and indirectly to people how important is to respect and treat the LGBT community just as everyone else. Spread the word! Share the movie with your straight and gay friends. 
A picture says a 1000 words. A Movie â€“ says a Million words.
