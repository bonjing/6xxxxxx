The world is your playground in Empire Earth II: Platinum Edition. Featuring Empire Earth II, Empire Earth II: The Art of Supremacy expansion pack, and the Prima strategy guide, the game is designed to test all aspects of your civilization leadership skills. 

With Empire Earth II, begin by picking one of 14 civilizations and watch them evolve as the game takes you through more than 10,000 years of history. Create your people, build them an empire, and then take your ever-improving army to conquer distant lands. The game features weather conditions designed to impact progress and stimulate new tactical initiatives.

With the Empire Earth II: The Art of Supremacy expansion pack, you can take control of Russian, French, Zulu, or Maasai troops to re-play huge battles in history. Meet with native tribes and choose to conquer them, assimilate to their ways, or create an alliance to support your troops in battle. The picture-in-picture system is intended to help you keep separate control over many regions in real-time, and an improved citizen manager system and research program eliminate the need to micromanage your city during a battle. Take your empire managerial skills online with friends and play nine types of games featuring multiplayer cooperative scenarios, tournament support, and a tactical planning map.

Intallation notes: 

You may need to delete myconfig.cfg if version does not match by installing.

Keys are in the text file named "Readme" (Required to play multiplayer on the official server)

Loader (using this loader allows you to play the game without any limitations):
In order to play the full game version online on the official game server always run the loader first and then using its interface open EE2.exe if you want to play the base game or EE2X.exe if you desire to play the expansion. If you are using Windows Vista, then you must run the loader as administrator (right click on it, then choose "Run as administrator").

The trial resetter is only needed if you forgot to run the loader first and there is no more trial time left.
 
Important notes:

The loader works well, even on Vista 64 bit (it must be run as administrator).
Unfortunately this loader is not working on Windows 7 64 bit and the game's protection detects virtual machines like Virtual PC or VMware, but in Windows 7 you can create a new partition (just by shrinking the drive) and install another version of Windows (preferably XP) and play online using the loader. You can install Windows on an USB flash drive too; just make sure it has a fast transfer speed otherwise it would be too slow.

Enjoy!
