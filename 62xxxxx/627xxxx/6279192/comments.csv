,Erx31,2011-04-22T14:22Z,u stupid asshole include crack! This doesnt work if u dont activate it by payemnt stupid motherfucker! i want crack to play all time and i aint gona pay n00b
,kovalt,2011-04-22T22:51Z,"It's got a loader, not compatible with Win7 64bit.... Then you got install virtual machine, WinXP, etc etc...."
,mihaihen,2011-04-24T00:32Z,"All seems alright so far. The only thing is... the game is kinda slow, and i more than meet the system req. Maybe it's from the loader?!?
Ps: will seed, like always :D"
,P_Light,2011-04-25T15:07Z,"To Erx31:
This torrent does not need a crack because the loader makes the game full version and you can play ""all time"" like you say. Next time, at least read the description before commenting..."
,Ilotan,2011-05-10T20:59Z,What's up with the 10/kbs download? :(
,Ilotan,2011-05-10T21:04Z,"^ Ignore that, just an internet fail."
,dauberbanaan,2011-05-12T21:21Z,"When I start the game, the text in the menu doesn't show up, making it unplayable.
I have seen that problem on the internet, but only with AMD cards and their solution doesn't work for me either (I have an NVidia card).
I'll try it on a decent OS (using Wine) instead of Winblows."
,Draco089,2011-05-19T02:40Z,Torrent works great! thanks alot for posting it =D
,Jones_250,2011-05-21T14:29Z,"The torrent was perfect. I do have one problem however. As I use Windows 7, and I really do not bother installing an virtual drive, I planned on using the trial resetter once an hour (not a big deal). The problem is that the resetter does not work. Probably IÂ´m somehow doing it wrong, as I do not have much of an idea how that software works.

Could someone enlighten me with some instructions how to operate this resetter?"
,nr14,2011-05-31T23:45Z,"To Jones_250

Its easy, start the program, press ""activemark"" in the upper right corner of the left-hand menu and wait, after that select everyone except ""hkey_local_host""\software..."", rightclick and press deleter key."
,EastLink,2011-06-04T06:40Z,Absolutely stupid how these commies wont let you run it Windows 764-bit OR virtual machines. Still a great fast download though.

,jairuzrojas,2011-08-02T18:24Z,"Hi i downloaded this yesterday great speeds!! thank you. and the game works perfectly except that the first time I played it it beeped after a couple minutes of me playing then it just quit out. I thought it was just a bug? so I just went ahead then did it again. Run the loader on admin open EE2X.exe and it runs fine, but after a few minutes then it just crashes.? Does this have something to do with having to Reset the trial? I thought if you ran the loader that it wouldnt do anything to the trial time? CAN SOMEONE HELP ME? if anyone is still on dis torrent?

I has vista idk what bit though"

,Scooby2608,2012-02-16T20:45Z,"Shit dont work. why cant people just upload a simple .iso file? I can mount it and play it as i wish no problems. Instead of making things complicated just do it the simple way.

Sorry dont mean to be rude, I just hate wasting my time with complications."
