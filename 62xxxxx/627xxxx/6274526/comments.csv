Having been a teenager in Glasgow at the same time as the film is set i can recognise everything in it right down to the Crombie coats and Harrington jackets. We used to sing ""bovver boots and bovver braces, we're the boys that slash yer faces"" Tollboys Ya Bass!....

,jurassicpunk,2011-04-25T19:36Z,"I had previously made the mistake of downloading the 98 minute version of this that had been going around. This looks to be the entire films. However, I notice that the running time of this torrent is approx. 1 hour and 58 minutes. The official running time listed for theaters is 2 hours and 4 minutes(124 minutes). That's a 6 minute difference. But there is nothing missing from this version(no shortened or cut scenes, etc.), correct? If someone can let me know for sure, I'd greatly appreciate it. And thanks for the great quality download. A/10, V/10"

The movie could use some subtitles because I can't understand the Scottish accents."
