,MyKrossini,2011-11-04T18:25Z,"You dislike FLAC because you are lazy and incompetent. Free Lossless Audio Codec is an amazing audio compression codec because you lose NO quality. Why would you dislike something that will give you the best sound quality? Is is possibly because your brain lacks the capacity to understand what's really going on inside your computer? Or is it because you are just too lazy to take 2 minutes out of your obviously extremely precious time to convert all 3, yes three, entire files to mp3? I hope you learned something today. You, sir, are an idiot. "

Cos it really takes so much space on ur drive, but gives the very Great sound quality, the exact record of the artist. i prefer you get an flac on ur track if u really like it. not the whole library of ur songs cos it takes time,"
,Azhet,2012-05-02T04:04Z,"To each his own. FLAC is good, but I honestly don't care about quality, I can't really tell the difference (and I do listen to music almost 24/7) so I prefer mp3. Also not all media players can play FLAC, so for some it's more trouble than it's worth. I'm not hating on it, it's great quality, just not for me. Good upload 10/10."
