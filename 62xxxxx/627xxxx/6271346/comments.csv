,Illegalbegal,2011-03-27T19:29Z,"Haha same thing happened to me a few months back, took me ages to get all the anime and stuff i had back, friggin Ext Hard drives!
Erm not sure personally, but 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto#Films
should have all the info you need, bear in mind that Naruto films are'nt cannon to the manga storyline so it doesnt really matter when you watch them!
(P.s second seeder should be online in a couple of hours, YAY because atm its just me supporting 42 leechers lol)"

,b1llbong,2011-03-28T07:17Z,wheres my post???   so u do have a virus on this torrent..!!!! ATTENTION: this torrent is infected.  it will not be deleted from your torrent software
,Illegalbegal,2011-03-28T19:32Z,"@ b1llbong
Wow are you completely retarded or what?
This torrent has been active for two days and only using two seeders for one, I personally have so far seeded 19Gbs, If you are claiming you have downloaded all 81Gbs in less than two days I must congratulate you for the quality of the shit you are talking.
Also this torrent doenst contain any viruses, your obviously too stupid to know what your doing as you claim this happens with ""another torrent"" my advise to you is to simply not download any torrents/connect to the internet at all rather than screaming ""virus"" as soon as you get confused.
To remove the torrent, right click on the torrent in your client, go ""remove and -> delete torrent + data""
To make sure your computer is completely infection free, i suggest you subsequently incinerate it, and yourself for good measure.
This can probably earn you a darwin award. 
Have a nice day, tard. :/"

So because THE PIRATE BAY didnt instantly upload and refresh your comment...my torrent must have a virus...
Yes.
In fact anyone else of a similar mindset/intelligence please don't bother to download this torrent anyway. :/"
,Illegalbegal,2011-03-28T19:45Z,"FYI:
Anyone concerned about 'Viruses' in this torrent.

,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-03-28T22:20Z,"I usally dont write comments. But I just must say that i fucking love You man!!! I`ve been searching everywhere for the old naruto anime, a here you are like an godsent. THANK YOU!!!!!!!"
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-03-28T22:30Z,OMG!!! My comment hasn`t shown up yet!!! LOL :P
,Illegalbegal,2011-03-28T23:17Z,"@MirrorWheelEyes

:D
Your very welcome sempai.
Was thinkin about uploading my Bleach/Full metal/ Evangelion collections too...may do soon
:)"
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-03-30T11:42Z,Well I`ll Be downloading that too. Despite the fact That I`ve not Been Keeping up with bleach since he destroyed Aizen. I tried but it felt like they where beginning all over again.... (noticed how the storyline and characters are similar to that of Naruto?)
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-03-30T12:03Z,"to rebornspetz

As i understand ""dattebayo"" are the ones releasing the originals. But If your looking for a site from where you can download the latest naruto, www.narutobase.net allways work for me. Though they dont have the anime dating back more than 50 episodes, They do have all the manga set up in volumes. Also If you are following the manga its nice to use www.mangastream.com. They allways inform you if the team that make the manga have a holliday or something so you dont wait around for nothing. And one last reference: www.endlessnaruto.com have a larger database than narutobase i belive. With soundtrack and movies and such. They also have a two chaptered pilot manga of how Naruto originaly where supposed to be. It was fun to watch (But I am glad they used the approach they ended up with"
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-03-30T12:12Z,"When I come to think about it, In the manga, when naruto tries to morph into the ninetales under his training with bee, he becomes a ""mini"" ninetails. That design is the same as the one used in the pilot manga. Guess Kishimoto Masashi didn`t want the design to go to waste..."
,Illegalbegal,2011-03-30T22:45Z,"@MirrorWheelEyes

Ahh funny you say that, Bleach for me should of ended with Aizen, and it plummeted in awesomeness after that while naruto has gotten sicker and sicker :D
Another awesome anime i would seriously recommend checking out is GANTZ which can be found at http://www.mangareader.net/97/gantz.html
:)"
,rebornspetz,2011-03-31T20:26Z,@MirrorWheelEyes  Thanx for the tip of sites! I will use them :)
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-04-07T17:50Z,"OK, im trying to read GANTZ, but how far should I read it before I make up my mind? couse im sorry to say it, Im kind off turned off by the drawings. Something about the faces that I dont like. Like they tried do make them authentic and screwed up.... Well maybe its becose Its hard to follow Naruto and Bleach. Now that was love at first sight :D."
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-04-07T19:08Z,Ok... I`ll be reading further. Mostly becose of Key Kishimoto lol :p... And I really want to know the deal is about Gantz..... (Kishimoto....hmm. Same as the creator behind Naruto....)
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-04-07T19:13Z,Know any sites where you can download each chapter? Realy dont want to start saving each page.Done enough of that in the beginning when I couldnt find any good naruto sites...
,MirrorWheelEyes,2011-04-07T20:08Z,Never mind. Found one

,donzaloog,2011-05-26T23:08Z,"For the best quality Naruto Shippuden subs use takafansubs.com. They are the ones who are dattebayo's successors. They are not as fast as DB, usually takes a few days, but definitely worth it."
,Illegalbegal,2011-05-28T02:48Z,"@ donzaloog

The vast majority of my episodes are dattebayo, and then :o  suprise! Taka's work."
