,greatcow95,2011-03-31T19:14Z,I've noticed this.  Two are stuck at 99.3% and it's showing that I'm still uploading to them.  It's being weird.
,greatcow95,2011-03-31T19:17Z,Let me know which file you're not getting.  Somehow I'm betting it's the Readme file.
,greatcow95,2011-03-31T23:32Z,"OK, that is truly weird.

Gk66 is version 6.6.  If you can use 6.7, which is under universal installer, you don't need that file.  It's the readme (which I kind of figured) that concerns me.  Here's the code:

Name: Basis School
Serial: 716708

This should work under all the versions."
