There were Gradekeepers on here for Windows so here is the Mac version of it.

Gradekeeper is a gradebook program for teachers to keep track of absences and not have to spend nights tallying grade points.  Included in this torrent are:

Gradekeeper 6.5 just in case everything else doesn\'t work for you.  It\'s on a DMG.

Gradekeeper 6.6 which is the last version that will work with a G3 system or (hopefully) with 10.3.  It\'s a ZIP file.  While I did test this with a G3, I did not test it with 10.3.  If it doesn\'t work, use 6.5!

Gradekeeper 6.7 which is the newest version.  It will work on any G4, G5, or Intel Mac running 10.4 or later.

The Readme file has the key to it, which works under 6.5 or 6.6.  I did not test it under 6.7 but I don\'t forsee any major issues with it.

Happy downloading!
