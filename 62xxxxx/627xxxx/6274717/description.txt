yes, this is a huge, uncompressed, ridiculous thing to upload.  please don't bitch about the size.
it's intended purely to give you ideas for movies to watch, and to provide a convenient, one click solution to searching TPB for a bunch of single movie files.
my choices are pretty arbitrary (both as to whether its 720 or 1080) as well as the movies themselves.  they're all classic films in ther own right, if you don't want some of them, just select "skip file download"
all of these play perfectly in vlc player, it's my personal collection.
if this becomes a popular torrent, i will continue to upload them in groups of 50 until my own library is exhausted.
feel free to provide requests for future films, i'm always interested in what others consider to be "classics"

i realize i essentially "stole" from others and honestly, i have no way to give credit for all the hard work that went into ripping and uploading the originals.  know that you are appreciated, and its not my intention to get credit for any of these rips.
