,ultimagic,2011-03-27T11:31Z,this must be the biggest torrent on TPB. with a very good list of movie.
[T],insinuendo,2011-03-27T12:53Z,"The vast majority of these titles are already available here.

Good choice of films, but an essentially pointless effort.

Sorry :("
,X45JKD,2011-03-27T16:24Z,"Eh. Most of them are 720p. With some effort one can download 1080p versions of these.

But nice of you to share them. Kudos."
,traderjohn,2011-03-27T20:53Z,"Great effort, but some very questionable titles. Top list should include:

A Christmas Story
Elf
First Blood
Rocky
Heat
Pretty Woman
Hunt for Red October (or Das Boot)
Jason Bourne trilogy (or at least a Bond film)
Unusual Suspects
American Beauty
Mad Max

And you have nothing by Pixar or Monty Python. That's off the top of my head."
,zcheeley,2011-03-28T08:07Z,"@traderjohn,

thanks for the input.  american beauty is on the uploaded list already.  

i fail to see the merits of elf.  

by unusual you must mean usual suspects, and yes i heartily agree.  in fact i agree with everything but elf.  

i have most of them in my library already, will upload if this torrent gets enough seeders to sustain itself."
,iliasvrahliotis,2011-03-28T22:59Z,"Oh,stop nagging and bitching and thank the man for the effort.Just unclick the ones you dont want and download the others already clicked.
Tnx zcheeley.n1"
,pix611,2011-04-08T00:32Z,"Zcheeley, you're The Man !!  
thanks for sharing unselfishly,
we need more people like you in The Pirate Bay."
,TheBanner,2011-04-13T01:25Z,"I did some research and I found out that this is the second largest torrent on TPB right now (Besides Porn) .
The largest is called (Geocities - The Torrent) , it's size is 641.32 GiB !!!
Nevertheless , zcheeley did an amzing work !"
,mininova_org,2011-04-25T04:32Z,great job thanks
,spawn4682,2011-04-27T16:28Z,No seeder since 1 week! :( Please seed guys...
,zcheeley,2011-04-28T01:22Z,"i have been seeding since 3/27/11 i am seeding right now, you just aren't connected to my swarm  there will only be me seeding until i have a full upload done, this should be done within 6 weeks and then there will be roughly 5-10 seeds if everyone cooperates.  so just hang in there a while ;)"
,NerdsterX,2011-05-01T23:17Z,you guys do realize if you unckeck the movies you don't want you can download the other ones in great quality
,Suman02,2011-05-05T10:32Z,Thanks man great effort! please  seed !
,Ninjalach,2011-06-06T19:25Z,"awesome collection...would be nice if others would take the time to put a collection like this together, maybe even do top 50 anime or top 50 comedies top 50 action movies would be totally sweet to see what peeps come up with"
,jshityeah,2011-06-20T10:22Z,"SWEEEET!! been downloading this for a while, PLEASE dont stop seeding lol!! 
Its pretty hard on your disk, so i found that skipping say half of them and downloading half, then downloading the last half isprobably the best thing to do, probably better speed too"
,roddick22,2011-06-29T14:44Z,Absolutely AMAZING!!! THANK YOU!!!
,zcheeley,2011-06-30T10:07Z,"just out of curiosity, what ""availability"" are you all registering?  I've been seeding for a few months, but only see .30% (not including me) which seems odd, given i've uploaded @ about 1:1.5  please provide feedback, if you have time."
,flerch,2011-09-26T22:03Z,"Good Job !!
Somebody commented on this as being a waste of
time, that they were here already.
The only waste of time is finding all 50 movies individually. cudos.
Keep it up man."
,partykiddie,2011-10-09T22:10Z,"@ultimagic
nope.. this torrent is bigger: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6721384/ER_-_Complete_Series_720p
