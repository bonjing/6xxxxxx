,Lac32,2011-03-27T15:10Z,I hope you keep this file size! this is the minimum necessary to HD
,MikeR56,2011-03-27T15:19Z,"I too would like a smaller file size but good quality. I just want to catch the race on my 20"" monitor, not a 55"" HDTV."
,Lm602,2011-03-27T15:49Z,if they're doing the f1 forum again this year please upload that. thanks alot from the US. SPEEDtv Sucks.

,Bulldog_swe,2011-03-27T21:23Z,"Thank you for this upload man, been lookin for this all day :-P"
,mojazubarka,2011-03-28T03:42Z,"SAFCukO09 THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL SEED TO MINIMUM RATIO 2. IS THERE ANY CHANCE TO UPLOAD POST RACE FORUM. I LOVE EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF BBC FORMULA ONE. THANK YOU, AGAIN."
,Lm602,2011-03-28T04:43Z,please put up the forum.
,raymond_u,2011-03-28T06:39Z,Hey mate. I'm seeding up to a ratio of 10. Could you up the f1 forum too please? :D
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-03-28T06:50Z,Personally i dont know loads about F1 lol is it the interactive forum at the end your after 
,raymond_u,2011-03-29T04:14Z,Yup mate. The Red Button forum on the BBC. I assumed as you had access to the HD feed from BBC that you'd have access to that. Could you maybe upload future races in 1080p too? :D
,raymond_u,2011-03-30T17:25Z,"I don't either, but I do have a 1080p HDTV. And I'm willing to wait twice as long for 1080p"
,55trucker,2011-04-03T15:13Z,"Nice work by the OP. Stop complaining about the screen resolution, 720 was around long before 1080 and it displays just fine. If you can't appreciate the effort by another then do it yourself. Hope the OP is around to upload the entire season, here where I am there is no BBC, therefore no complete coverage of the races. Thx for the work. Greatly appreciated"
,geenotreally,2011-04-12T12:53Z,"Came back to say a BIG thank you for a perfect upload. A=10, V=10. good bitrate, BBC did not have any sync issues. Now only if Eddie Jordan will shut his pie hole."
