|Game Description|
+----------------+

Spin, match, explodeâ€¦ WOW! It's a brilliant new way to play Bejeweled, from PopCap. Spin and match explosive gems for shockwaves of fun. Rotate jewels to set up electrifying combos, outwit surprising obstacles like Locks and Bombs, and create high-voltage Flame and Lightning gems. When you want to dial up the intensity, go for Challenge mode or five-minute Blitz. And if relaxing is more your style, kick up your feet with stress-free Zen. No matter the mode, you'll discover new strategies, improve your moves, and find endless ways to win!
