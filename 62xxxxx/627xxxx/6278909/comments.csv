Crack is from ViTALiTY. 1.02 crack is working fine.

giveme2entitlements.exe is from 
Well I dont know, whoever you are, thank you :)

Game is working fine, few bugs here and there. I finished it in about 3 hours. Only few decision could choose with Full Paragon and almost zero Renegade :/

Girl is killed, Asteroid smashed Mass Relay and because of that ""I"" killed 300.000+ batarians. So I must go to Earth for trial. 

So I will probaly start Mass Effect 3 before judge. Damn you Chuck Norris!"

You know, i posted some pictures. Maybe take a look?"
,deliverance6,2011-03-29T03:48Z,"taken an hour to get it, very few seeds atm. 
i'll seed for a bit but my up speed is crap. the installer is the real deal, as is the crack ( ViTALiTY. 1.02 ). 
The giveme2entitlements.exe is an updated one from the usual DLC cracker, sorry but i don't know the name. all in all, works perfectly!
Thank you very much anonymous uploader!"
,john6425,2011-03-29T05:42Z,"@pisoY

I took a look at the pics, but because of photoshop it's hard to trust anything. 

*********CONFIRMED**************

I installed it and am playing it now! 

**NOTE**
Make sure you put the crack in the BINARIES folder!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's right BINARIES. Else it will not start. "

No but seriously it was short and could have done a little more to get ready for ME3.

,wtfronsson,2011-03-29T16:23Z,"This was so bad I want to cry. Kill a hundred of the same basic guys youve killed about 20 000 by now, then one YMIR, and thats it.

,DontPissMeOff,2011-04-02T14:40Z,"1. @pisoY You can quarel with The Community, but deep down a still voice tells you something you already know, that you're an asshole, aren't you?

2. Guys, I have a problem with DLC authentication. The program ""giveme2entitlements.exe"" stops working. I guess it's a problem with Framework 3.5, but I don't know how to fix this. I have tried on two machines, I have tried installing Framework 4.0, unistalling, using the Microsoft clean up tool, going to Programs>Turn Windows Features on/off and ticking/unticking Framework 3.5.1 - nothing works and I can't play it. Does anyone know the sollution?"

,pisoY,2011-04-03T12:21Z,"It doesnt matter if Skidrow or Reloeaded, or whatever. Update the game to 1.02, then install DLC, after that crack it and put  ""giveme2entitlements.exe"" in Binaries and run it. If it doesnt work, then you are doing something wrong :)

I ask because I have all other DLC's installed from the beginning and quite enjoy replaying from a bit past half way though rather than from scratch and REALLY Don't want to lose my achievements.

,EvilAsh34,2011-04-05T19:42Z,"@Stiff_123

Yeah it works fine. Just make sure you follow the instructions *exactly* with the exception that you have to/should run the giveme2entitlements.exe as administrator. If you are truly worried you'll lose anything or mess up your game then back-up everything. By everything i mean your main ME2 game folder and also your ME2 settings in the documents folder. The back-up will end up being almost 17gb of space (if you have all dlc's) but as soon as you're sure everything is OK after you update then you can just trash the backup. That's what i did and everything worked flawlessly. 

One last thing. Absolutely be sure that you have the game blocked in your firewall. If it connects to the cerberus network it will screw shit up.

Hope that helps."
,Stiff_123,2011-04-05T21:07Z,"Yes and Thank You EvilAsh34 much appreciated!
Whew! 17+Gb ouch  but as you say only temporary so no biggy.
Yea I use PeerBlock which works great and was the only way I could get the DLC's to pony up the goods lol. P.S. I watched the walkthrough and I'm confused why so many were disappointed. I thought it was a nice addition. Not nearly as good as Shadow Broker but cool none the less.
Thanks Again!  He's got some Splaining to do Lucy... "
,Stiff_123,2011-04-06T08:51Z,"BTW I might add...
This is without question the Most Amazing, Thought Provoking, Absorbing Game I've Had the Privilege of Playing in My Lifetime and that is no small feat as I've played most of em. The only one I've ever played as many times just to test different outcomes. It's Crazy. Hell I'm Crazy. It's Perfect! I Hope they're just messing with us about ME3 Final and end up making ME4 & ME5!!!

,Virus_ST,2011-04-30T17:16Z,"hey dudes, thanks for helping me with my issue, you faggots. anyway i solved it, it was a meer matter of reinstalling the game. upon my web surfing i ran across some people having the problem with several dlc installers i.e. zaeed, overlord, kasumi. the problem was that after the initial verifying installer window disappeared nothing would happen. for those who have this issue i suggest downloading universal extractor. it's a free app used for extracting exe files. use it on the dlc files that won't work and once you extract their content copy the DLC__ into the biogame/dlc folder then use the giveme2entitlements file as per usual. have fun."

,TyMod,2011-08-06T19:02Z,The biggest reason people are having trouble is the fact they are using the originaly GiveMe2Entitlements.  Download the second version and use it to crack the DLC. Install the 1.02 patch and download the crack off of Gamecopyworld.com.  This is the best way to do it and to ensure you dont get crashes.

Please install Mass Effect 2 and try again.""... This should not happen bcoz i m playing Mass Effect 2 n i m on the Suicide Mission... Plzz frnds,help. I want to play the DLC bcoz Mass Effect 3 follows on from the events of this DLC..."
,acey2660,2012-05-31T07:16Z,"First off I would like to say thank you for the upload. I downloaded this and it works. I have the retail version of this game and this DLC worked with the Retail version!!!! I bought it off EA Store, DIGITAL DOWNLOAD and this worked perfect with the retail, so yes this works. 

My Norton 2012 did find a virus in the giveme2entitlements.exe executable and it cleaned it before I could even install it, So I had to remove it from quarantine and then I had to restore it back to its original folder... Then After careful observation of the file itself I have determined this is a False Positive... So I set my ANTI-VIRUS to allow the executable, and BAM! Installed Great!! All the other Virus Scans I ran, Passed!! And I have dealt with False Positives numerous amounts of time on PB. I am not new to downloading and uploading, so anyone who thinks this is a virus is wrong. As far as I can tell its a FALSE POSITIVE!! Which is common with game cracks. 

But anyways this DLC works great! I havent finished it yet but so far it works perfect. Thank You uploader for the UP!! Much Appreciated, This is the only DLC I dont have. And Again YES this does work with the retail version of the game, Just follow the instructions. I did not run into any problems what so ever (except norton killing the giveme2entitlements.exe) After allowing it to run... I had 0 problems. None mentioned above, like none of my saved games were erased like a few people have said on here. Seems to work flawlessy for me. Either I know what I am doing or the other people didnt download the same one as I did, (Which is this one)  THANK YOU UPLOADER!!! 

IF ANYONE CAN GET DRAGON AGE DAWN OF THE SEEKER DVD RIP I will OWE YOU!!! Please let me know, I cannot find that anywhere, Ill probably just buy it!! BUT IF YOU CAN UPLOAD IT PLEASE LET ME KNOW! "
,acey2660,2012-06-02T03:12Z,"OKay so I finished Arrival with few problems. The game would LAAAAGG so bad, but it had nothing to do with this download it was my Graphics card.... After rolling back my driver the game played perfect... The actual expansion was weak however. Only took 2 hours to complete the entire DLC. I am glad I didnt buy this, its definitely not worth $9.99 LOL but Thank You Uploader for this upload, it works perfect and I had no problems on this side of it. Because I have the retail version of the game I didnt have to use the crack. I installed it, ran the giveme2entitlements and it worked great after that!! Thank You again I give this upload a 10/10  "
