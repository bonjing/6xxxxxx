Description from the company: 

Illustrious names from the contemporary Metal scene, including Raymond Herrera and Christian Olde Wolbers (Fear Factory, Arkaea), Pat Lachman (Damageplan), Wayne Static (Static X), Jamey Jasta (Hatebreed), Stephen Carpenter (Deftones), Jed Simon (Strapping Young Lad), and John Boecklin (DevilDriver), have got together in the studio to add a wicked soundtrack to the game. 
Together, these musicians have created a rock-hard Metal soundtrack for nail'd. Besides various instrumentals, it includes three dedicated "nail'd" songs: "Count for Something", "Through Walls of Flame" (sung by Jamey Jasta), and "Decimator" (vocals by Wayne Static). All lyrics were specially written for the game. 
In addition, licensed tracks from Slipknot, Queens of the Stone Age, Backyard Babies, Rise Against, American Sixgun, Aggressive Chill, and Slaves on Dope help turn on the heat in nail'd even more.
