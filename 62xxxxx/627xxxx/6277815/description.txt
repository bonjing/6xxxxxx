On their MySpace page, Thousands playfully call themselves "Progressive House / Psychedelic / Thrash." Forget about noise, Seattle duo Kristian Garrard and Luke Bergman's wondrous album debut The Sound Of Everything is one of the gentlest, most tender records you'll ever hear; just two entwined voices, exquisite acoustic guitar and a very occasional harmonium. Oh, and sounds from nature; bird calls, falling leaves, blowing wind and natural reverb are all present, underlining the organic creation of Thousands songs and their surreal, nature-focused lyrics. At least their 'Influences' on MySpace tell the truth: "Sound History magazine. The coast. Darkness. Speaking in tongues. Silence."
