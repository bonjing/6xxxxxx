,Ki1l4U,2011-09-22T07:18Z,Is it a false positive? All his other torrents seem to be safe.
,Ki1l4U,2011-09-23T07:55Z,"Tested it and it does have virus's, the serial does not work with the demo downloaded from the official site."

,joew771,2012-06-24T02:43Z,"This does work. No viruses. I detected one with AVG, but it was a false positive. (eula.exe), which is in many programs, not only this one, and gets detected all the time. The program works fine with the serial provided. Just copy paste it in."
