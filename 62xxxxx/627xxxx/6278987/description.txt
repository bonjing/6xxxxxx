 Description:                                                                  
 Celebrated chef Raymond Blanc invites the cameras to his bustling Oxfordshire 
 kitchen to share cooking secrets he has gathered and treasured over the past  
 thirty-five years. The programme features a range of recipes for cooks of all 
 abilities that are inspirational, yet achievable.                             
                                                                               
 In this episode, Raymond draws upon memories of his travels through Asia to   
 create dishes full of fragrant spice and fiery heat. To kick off, a mouth-    
 wateringly fresh green papaya salad with the sweet crunch of pomegranate and a
 tangy dressing of chilli and lime. The inspiration for Raymond's next dish    
 comes from no further than his own kitchen. Indian vegetable curry infused    
 with a complex blend of masala spices is one of his much-loved family recipes.
 Next tender, slow-cooked pork belly marinated in a Chinese-style blend of     
 aromatic spices with a crisp, crunchy crackling, drenched in an intense meaty 
 broth.                                                                        
                                                                               
 To round off Raymonds trip down memory lane a stunning dessert of pasta-free  
 ravioli encasing exotic fruits and soft panacotta served with a cool coconut  
 sorbet. Ever willing to learn, Raymond visits Sri Owen, an expert in          
 Indonesian cuisine who gives him a master class in traditional Balinese       
 spicing before they savour an Indonesian feast of slow-cooked, marinated duck.
                                                                               
                                 Enjoy!
