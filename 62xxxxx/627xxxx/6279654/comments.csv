I've only sampled it on VLC player, waiting for the kids to get home before watching!!"
,BlackFuzz,2011-04-01T11:40Z,"This is a cam.

I expect higher quality for over a gigabyte of data. Whole screen was not captured in this, nor was the entirety of the film in focus. The final portion of the credits is also cut out of this version.

The majourity of the film is viewable in this file."

If your not using an IP masker in the year 2011 then I'll ask YOU not to DOWNLOAD from ANYONE ever again."

,007Michael4115,2011-04-20T01:16Z,great
,MBakke,2011-04-20T16:52Z,"What the hell are you talking about? This is fucking horrible. About 70% of the screen is included. Audio is great, 8, while the video sucks, 4. It's not that hard. Just bring a good camera and place a good mic. Then cut away the outside of the screen and edit it all a little. The most important part is not cutting away any of the movie itself. No one cares about a cough or a slight flicker. At least I don't."
,fightthenwofuckers,2011-04-21T11:56Z,I dont download cam shite and i dont know why most of you fucking spanners watch em? must be nerds. p.s. fuck off cam nerds.

if you want to surf safe, use anti virus & firewall
if you want to f*ck safe, were a condom.
if you want to drive safe, were a helmet. 
if you want to download torrents, use security app.

if you want every thing to be perfect, then you gotta spend some money. 

if you need free stuff, then you gotta be smart.

Not being rude, its an advice:)"
,Stevenmt57,2011-04-25T23:16Z,"This is off topic here but last year I read a post that explained what the different uploads were such as a ts, cam, r5 and so on. Is there anyone here that can make that list one more time. I get confused at times with all the terms. Thank you for anyone that can clarify this."
,Midnitewolfy,2011-05-02T09:05Z,"Since you guys are on the topic, what are some good apps or programs for ip masking and safety w/dl's?

links?"
,fallout11,2011-05-07T03:36Z,"Great little film, surprisingly good and funny."
,raul4ever,2011-05-07T05:54Z,care to update the less knowledgable people about the security measure needed for torrent downloads.. i already have an antivirus and a firewall.. what are good ip masking apps??
,kingjazz,2011-05-07T18:07Z,"For downloading safe:
PeerBlock ;) keep it updated :)

R5 - Region 5 dvd, Russian/Ukraine/Asia - sometimes lacking some post production, usually released earlier to prevent the pirating in these regions :p

TS - should be recorded from the projection booth with a cam on a tripod, can be very watchable 

Cam - a drunk guy holding a camera :P
