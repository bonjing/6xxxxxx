Is it asking too much for your 20-something child to make his or her own money and live independently? Barbara says her daughter, Chelsea, needs to grow up! She says sheâ€™s given her daughter nothing but the best, and all she has to show for it is a lying child who wonâ€™t speak to her. Chelsea says she canâ€™t live up to her momâ€™s â€œrich bitchâ€ expectations and just wants to be left alone. Mother and daughter see each other on the Dr. Phil stage for the first time in seven months, and sparks fly! Is Barbara surprised to learn the secret Chelsea reveals? Then, Chelseaâ€™s grandmother isnâ€™t immune to her granddaughterâ€™s conniving ways. Learn why she feels used. And, Barbara says Chelsea has spent thousands of dollars of her familyâ€™s money, and anytime she earns a paycheck, she blows it and doesnâ€™t pay her family back. Dr. Phil conducts an experiment to see what the young woman will do with $500. You may be surprised by the results!
