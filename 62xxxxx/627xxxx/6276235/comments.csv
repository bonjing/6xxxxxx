Traxinv99's cd has a few flaws."
,traxinv99,2011-10-30T21:58Z,No flaws... purposeful inserts.. 
,jbosch,2011-11-29T20:02Z,"there is nothing wrong with the torrent, Arno_Vermeulen just wants you to download his torrent(which sucks, I downloaded both and compared them), look at this other site he posted on:
