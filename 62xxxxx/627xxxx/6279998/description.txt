A small tool for launching programs or websites within a few clicks.
The general idea for this tool is to easily and fast be able to launch programs that you often use without minimizing all windows so you can click it on the desktop.

Alot better than using small icons in the quick launch taskbar. Just click the Quick Launch icon down on the bottom right to show or hide.

Requirements:
.NET 3.5
Win XP, Vista, 7
