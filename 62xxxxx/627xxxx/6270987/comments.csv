,XChoYX,2011-05-02T02:37Z,"Im having a problem with the extraction because when i try to extract it says you need the following volume to continue then after that another comes and another but i cant really extract it. I also changed the file extensions into .rar does that make a difference if it does what should i do to make it work?
Thanks Looking forward to your answers
and Also thanks for the torrent :D"
,smokeskreen420,2011-05-25T01:12Z,ok mother fucker why do you have a virus in all your goddam torrents for those noobs out there who dont know which one of the files is a virus it is the .sfv file
,lolzillaXD,2011-05-29T06:49Z,"WHAT THE FUCK??

I INSTALL IT BUT IT SAYS ITS SOME DIVINE WIND CRAP??

I THOUGHT IT WAS THE FULL CHRONICLES COMPILATION

DO NOT DOWNLOAD PEOPLE

I REPEAT

DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,FeyBart,2011-05-29T11:12Z,"@lolzillaXD
I think it says Divine Wind because that was the most recent installment in the game. And BTW, if it isn't, why would it matter? You got it for free, god damned!"
,Veriuser,2011-06-15T18:49Z,"@lolzillaXD 
That's the most retarded comment I've seen on this site, congratulations. Divine Wind is the most recent expansion and it only works with all previous expansions. Now think for a while, slowly.. Yes, it means this torrent is in fact the complete EU3 compilation."

Pink fucking skull... He has one for a reason, dumb asses. ""rlf-rls"", I thank you for this quality upload. I will now enjoy this free game (normally costing ~$40.00USD) which you have provided for the Pirate Bay community."
,lordorestis,2011-07-21T19:53Z,"thanks for the upload! i have a problem thought. it says ""CreateVertexDeclaration failed!! (Province Vertex Decl"" Upon) "" and crashes during the Creating the World"" in the load up. any help?"

,oo_500,2011-07-27T13:35Z,"""CreateVertexDeclaration failed"" means that your graphics card isn't good enough to run Divine Wind. Paradox went full retard by making this expansion require pixel shader 3, I mean who the fuck plays EU3 for the graphics?? They arent even good."
,legis1234,2011-08-01T17:52Z,do you have to donwload de .sfv file?
,Berkeap,2011-08-02T13:57Z,"It works for me, but I only can select 'default' and not the other mods. Is this correct?"

smokescreen:
Simple file verification (SFV) is a file format for storing CRC32 checksums of files to verify the integrity of files. SFV is used to verify that a file has not been corrupted... wich means, no virus... and yeah I copy and pasted from Wiki, just to tired and lazy to explain to retards...

legis:
no.. you dont have to download the .sfv file.
you got one .bin and one .cue file, both these files needs to be in same folder or you get error while trying to mount. Mount .cue with Daemon tools or any other image mounting program, or select .cue file to burn"
,iquit...,2011-10-09T23:08Z,I was wondering if you could get/make a keygen so we can play online

,robertfilipaj,2012-01-26T00:06Z,"I have a problem with the unpacking, It will sound stupid but can someone tell me how to unpack? like which files? all those rar files at once or one-by-one or all the files including the non-rar files??? please help me ..."
,[SMURF]Lolsmurf,2012-02-16T09:50Z,"****FIX FOR THE PEOPLE WHO GET THE CRASH AT STARTUP ****

1) DISABLE INTERNET CONNECTION 

2) Start the game from your program files europa universalis folder, click RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR

3) PLAY


=> A lot of people said: oh easy game no need for crack or something, well that's not right, the game must have some sort of built in registration which allows it to connect and try to register your game, this is what causes the game to crash at startup after the creating world or intializing map.


If this still doesnt work, go to the program files europe universalis folder and there you find settings.txt file

OPEN IT

a) set : fullscreen to NO (instead of yes)
b) PUT THIS UNDER GRAPHICS: size=
{
	x=1920
	y=1080
}


(**choose your own destkop screen resolution and adapt it**)

c) PLAY"

,oss_spy,2012-06-25T01:01Z,"How do I unpack and install this? I have the folder that is full of the same fan-eu3c file but I have no idea what to do from here. Please help me with this...I know that this is a good file, but I'm fairly new to unpacking things like this. Any help would be much appreciated!"
,TKiKhono,2012-06-25T04:06Z,"@oss_spy: Look near the bottom.  There will be a .rar file.  Unpack that and it will use all those other files automatically.

Then mount the ISO with daemon tools lite, or burn it if you wish.

Be sure to always check the .nfo files.  Open them in wordpad.  Don't use the default file association to open them (don't just double click them).  "
