The director who shot this film should have splurged for some lights on set.

It's ridiculous how the spin doctors and PR specialists for the film tried to cover the lack of lighting in the movie by suggesting the movie had a ""dark"" theme to it... it wasn't the theme but the lack of lighting that was dark.

Thanx mucho AiTB for the torrent :-) AiTB has always been in the top ELITE and best torrent sources!!!"

Video is somewhat grainy and flattering - but it is the best release so far...

For archive I'll wait until proper retail or HD source :)"
