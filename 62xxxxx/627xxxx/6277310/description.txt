In 1959, in an attempt to challenge traditional attitudes, Marcel MariÃ«n produced and directed the short subject film, L'imitation du cinÃ©ma. A combination of sexual and religious imagery, it caused a scandal in Belgium and was banned in France. It is the story of a young man in search for a cross who eventually has one tailor made. Even with the support of the Kinsey Institute, it proved impossible to have the film shown in the United States.
The film's title is a reference to The Imitation of Christ.
