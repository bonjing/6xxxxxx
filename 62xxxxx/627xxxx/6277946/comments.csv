Thank you scene4all.."
,rapitout,2011-07-05T08:17Z,"there was this this little problem after i installed , patched and used the serial that it wont search for me, just hang in there loading and loading and timeout after sometime....

so i again replaced the patched exe in the inst dir with the one it backs up.

so in someway it is registered now with the origional exe...

LOL now it offeres me to register it for lifetime for some dollars!"
