,frobknob,2011-03-28T23:50Z,The links work IF you copy the URL into your address bar - they won't work if you click on them because ImageShack evidently has a bug up their ass about TPB.

,Bargetti,2011-04-07T12:30Z,"@end77 

you really said that ""to much religious mumbo jumbo?"" let me explain something to you. a movie about exorcisms has a 100% chance to be about religion. its remarkable your saying the movie sucks because there is religion in it when you probably new that it would have religion in it before you hit the download button. so why are you complaining there is religion in a movie about exorcisms?  "
,Bargetti,2011-04-07T12:33Z,"BTW

A:1
V:3
