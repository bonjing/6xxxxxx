,VaticanCity,2011-03-29T16:20Z,"If anyone is interested in MexSim Acapulco MMAA,I just got finished redoing it for FSX.It's a very nice Airport.Small runway flicker in certain areas not bad I think it's with the elevation.I've deleted FS9 issues and all replaced with FSX.I added Small buildings and Items to make it very warm and friendly.I also added a small port ect.If anyone wants me to I'll upload it."
,VaticanCity,2011-03-29T16:22Z,"Mexsim is proud to present General Juan N. Álvarez International Airport or also
known as Acapulco Intl Airport. Because Acapulco has always been considered
an important resort and recreation area, Juan Álvarez International Airport has
long been important in the development of tourism in southern Mexico. It is the
largest international airport in the country's southern Pacific region, and one of
the largest air facilities in Mexico."
,beedeejee,2011-03-29T17:34Z,How do i need to replace the trees?
,VaticanCity,2011-03-29T21:20Z,The trees should be already replaced for you. Thier should be a file called EGNMbp.bgl in your scenery folder for the scenery.If it's thier its done if not I may have forgot to add it to the installer.But I'm pretty sure it's thier.Let me know though.
