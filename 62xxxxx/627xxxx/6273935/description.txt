RED GARLAND QUINTET ALL MORNINâ€™ LONG
Label: Prestige
Recorded:1957
Format:Mp3@320


On November 15, 1957, a quintet headed by pianist Red Garland recorded enough material for two records. This CD reissue (whose companion is Soul Junction) has a 20-minute version of \"All Mornin\' Long,\" along with briefer renditions of \"They Can\'t Take That Away from Me\" (a mere ten minutes) and Tadd Dameron\'s \"Our Delight.\" More important than the material is that, in addition to Garland, the main soloists are John Coltrane and trumpeter Donald Byrd. Byrd was on his way to getting his sound together, while Trane, very much in his sheets-of-sound period, was already blazing a new path for jazz to follow. An excellent and often quite colorful jam session-flavored hard bop set. ~ Scott Yanow
