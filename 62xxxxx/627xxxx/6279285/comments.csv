,canfiax,2011-03-31T19:20Z,"NOT WORKING - Fake. They want you to play  via Windows Player (because of some codec problem - lol like windows media player would solve that problem) and then when you do, you'll open ur browser gets virus.

,LukeScooto,2011-06-17T04:45Z,"You ever think he works for the MPAA? If he can distrupt the download scene even a little bit, he's done his job. If they hire 100 people like him, they can cause major damage, and make newbies scared to even try to download. Trust me, they dont fight all thier wars in court."
