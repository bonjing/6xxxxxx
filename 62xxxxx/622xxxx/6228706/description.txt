This is a software for Android-devices that makes it possible to root and unroot your device.

Simply just:
*Send the file to your device with either Bluetooth or USB-cable.
*Open and install the software.
*Open the app and press \"Temporarily root\" (You\'ll be able to unroot your device afterwards).
*Wait until the phone is being rooted and re-booted.
*Now your device is fully rooted!

You can unroot your device at any time, just simply:
*Open the app.
*Press \"Unroot\".
*No re-boot or anything, it\'s simply unrooted!

Enjoy!
