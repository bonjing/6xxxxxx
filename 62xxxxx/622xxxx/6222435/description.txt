This album is Vanessaâ€™s first collaboration with the guys from Ice Cream on Mondays. Recorded in 10 days, this project started out as a memento of their summer spent playing together and ended up being so successful that they remained together as a band and Vanessa began touring Europe regularly with ICOM. Reviewers called Thin Thread â€œa pop CD with folk integrity, with intelligent lyrics and a sincere delivery.â€ (Buddy Magazine)
