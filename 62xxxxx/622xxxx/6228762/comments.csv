,EduardoLorenzo,2011-03-19T16:02Z,"can you help me out?
I'm using r4 with wood r4.
I can play the game, I can save the game.
But when I press continue it starts a new game and what's even more frustrating is that when I save that I can SEE me old save file still there. I just can't load it.

Any ideas?"
,kalyndra,2011-03-20T11:56Z,"for me its the same i can play the game but i cant restart a saved game.
Also i can start only the first part i cannot redo time i play on r4 gold card"
,tails29,2011-03-27T04:08Z,i have the M3DSReal and experiencing the same problem as writing above.
,askurt,2011-03-28T16:43Z,"I am also experience the same problem with not being able to load the game, wich is realy sucky since it seems like being a great game"
,EduardoLorenzo,2011-04-03T19:13Z,"Oh I figured it out.. the save file was for some reason 8kB. That's why it couldn't been read properly.
Wood R4 version 1.26 saved it the first time right, but if you can change the size of the save file any other way, that probably would also fix it.."
,gracia_victory,2011-05-18T15:46Z,"I also get the same problem as listed above, and I still can't solve it. Any solutions?
Also, I have one more problem, I can't advance trough the plot, because the boulder in the Lazvil Hills didn't disappear after the first time traveling."

,Dixie51,2012-03-24T22:42Z,"Honestly, after reading the NFO file, I deleted the game. If people have nothing better to do with their lives than to create nfo files that contain nothing but profanity and content that contributes nothing to the actual game or files, I have no need at all for their games."
,Toner08,2012-05-18T23:27Z,This game loads and saves just fine on my DSTWO. Had no problem reloading a save file
