,11western,2011-03-09T01:58Z,"Thanks for this, it looks cool. Probably don't need it but it's nice to have something new...lol.
Question, can this be used to send an e-mail file, say a movie to my brother, so that he can unpack it on his end and it's not such a big file to send?

( never tried that)"
,11western,2011-03-09T02:00Z,that's a small file. while I was typing the comment it finished...lol...not used to that...lol
