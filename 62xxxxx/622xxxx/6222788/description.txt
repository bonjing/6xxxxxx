Erzulie Maketh Scent is a live album featuring a solo performance by Cecil Taylor recorded in Berlin on July 16, 1988 as part of month long series of concerts by Taylor and released on the FMP label.
The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek states "This solo concert, performed on the second to last day of a monthlong stay in Berlin in which Taylor performed in every conceivable setting, is perhaps the most satisfying of his recording career. Taylor's many influences, interests, and obsessions are engaged here: They are mused upon, debated, and underscored for emphasis. His exploratory range has never been greater than it is on this three-part set, with two short and very delightful "songs" tagged on at the end. Taylor's sense of playfulness seldom comes through in his solo work, and this piece is full of it. Here is the place where the man truly lives as an artist... Of all the solo work Taylor did in the '80s â€” and there was plenty â€” this is the one to own. Go ahead. Be amazed".
