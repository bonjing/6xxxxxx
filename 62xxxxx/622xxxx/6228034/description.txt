Natalie Grant (born December 21, 1971 in Seattle, Washington) is a singer-songwriter of contemporary Christian music. Her work has gained prominence, including four consecutive Dove Awards for best female artist, and with her signature song, Held. Born in Seattle, she currently lives in Nashville with her husband, Bernie Herms, and their twin daughters. She was awarded the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 Gospel Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year.

Natalie Grant is married to her producer Bernie Herms and gave birth to twin girls on February 16, 2007. She was a speaker and performer on the Revolve Tour, a conference for teen girls from Women of Faith.

She has a passion to see an end to human trafficking. She was affected by an episode of Law & Order that dealt with the topic and began researching. Her studies led her and her husband to travel to India to witness the red-light districts and what is being done to stop them. That experience, coming in the middle of a restless, stressed-out season for her, completely changed the trajectory of Natalie's life, awakening her out of complacency and passivity and into a life driven by compassion and passion. And it has forever changed the way she approaches her music.
