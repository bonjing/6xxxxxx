The group displays a firm grasp of all the things that make noise pop and shoegaze so great, like dynamics, male/female vocal tradeoffs, a bitter romantic lyrical outlook, and tons of pedals. And guitars! Yuck is overloaded with loud, fuzzy guitars that whine and grind through the songs, just like they should. On the album-ending Rubber, they even give the sound a twist by stretching out to epic length and creating all sorts of drama and tension out of a hugely ugly and grungy guitar drone that sounds like muck oozing down a flight of stairs. Yuck is an impressively assured debut from such a young band. Their love of shoegaze and loud/quiet 90s guitar rock is unadulterated and it translates into the songs and the sound, making it a pure and easy-to-love album for all those who have ever been fans themselves.
