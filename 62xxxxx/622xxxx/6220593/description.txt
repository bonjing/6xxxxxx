NATOBAR NOT OUT (Bengali, 2010) Information

Synopsis: Natobor Not Out is a comedy which will appeal to a wide cross-section of Bengalis -
urban, small town and even rural, as almost every Bengali is either already a poet or
at least aspires to be one. That thereâ€™s something in them that pulls them towards poetry
is now a known fact. This is the story of a young chap â€˜Natoborâ€™ from a typical north
Calcutta middle-class neighbourhood whose heart beats for poetry, but with no
appreciation coming from any quarters â€“ not even the local club, he loses heart almost
every day.
