,dark_defender,2011-03-05T14:40Z,I would want all of you to keep your upload speed limit to  max while downloading. I have my limits with upload speed. Please.
,dark_defender,2011-03-05T14:43Z,^ And of course seed too after you complete.
,indiaman,2011-03-07T19:13Z,Thanks for this wonderful season of Hustle and that too in just 1.28 GB.
,dark_defender,2011-03-07T21:09Z,"@indiaman: Thanks. But real credit goes to 20-40. Check out his torrents at

,Ataractic,2011-03-13T15:46Z,"Thanks for this. I was wondering if asking 2040 to upload hustle season 7 would be too much; I already have bothered him a lot. I love his encodes- will seed it as long as i can (for a month, at least)."
,eXXo23,2011-10-30T01:08Z,"Thank you seeders. Excellent torrent, very fast DL speed. I'll keep on seeding as soon as I download the whole file. "
