Bachelor Girl was an Australian pop band, formed in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1992 consisting of singer Tania Doko and writer/instrumentalist James Roche. Their debut single, "Buses and Trains", was an international hit, but subsequent releases only impacted Australian charts.

The band formed in 1992 when songwriter and record producer Roche met vocalist Doko. Roche was creating a demonstration tape of a song he wrote for an Australian girl group, Girlfriend, and when his original singer cancelled, he recruited Doko. The two then signed a deal with Gotham Records in 1997 after being rejected by Sony.

The band split in 2003 after the release of their second album. A third album had been recorded, but was not released. On 17 December 2010, Tania Doko announced via her Facebook page that Bachelor Girl would release more material in 2011.
