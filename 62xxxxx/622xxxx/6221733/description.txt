Hank Snow - The Singing Ranger: 1949-1953 [2002) Bear Family Records


Bear Family's The Singing Ranger: 1949-1953 contains every song Hank Snow recorded for RCA in the beginning of his career. Not only are career-making songs like "I'm Movin' On," "Marriage Vow," and "The Rhumba Boogie" included, but so is a wealth of unreleased songs and alternate takes. For diehard Hank Snow fans, this first volume of The Singing Ranger series is the most essential of the three. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
