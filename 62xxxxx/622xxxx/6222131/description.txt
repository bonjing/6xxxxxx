The setting of this drama is a beautiful and costly home in Sao Paulo that has recently come on the market. When a real estate agent starts handling the house, he discovers a woman and her daughter have moved in as squatters on the premises. Meanwhile, the night watchman of the estate has his own views on the squatters, and the three separate factions -- squatters, agent, and watchman -- have to somehow work out a solution to this situation.
