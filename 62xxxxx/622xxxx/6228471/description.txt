this has been ripped from a tape so not perfect quality but still ok.In October 1990 Coventry made dance music history. At a time when the nationâ€™s rave scene was still very much an underground \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"letâ€™s all congregate in a secret field/warehouse location\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Coventry launched the first legal all night rave in a city centre club.It was called The Eclipse, it had slipped through a gap in the law like a naughty kid through a fence and it was to become the epicentre of the national rave scene.
