,traloth,2011-06-20T13:44Z,mpeg4. For whateva reason my impressive array of players and using two different sets of mpeg4 codes (one Divx the other ffdshow) refuses to play this film without chugging. Oh well. You get what you pay for. :D downloading xvid version instead. 
,LetMeLIVE,2011-08-08T05:04Z,"@mobn, maybe research video encoding/processing before coming off as a clueless a-hole?"

,michaelrwatson,2012-04-04T22:07Z,"(a) filesize too large (699MB is best)
(b) resolution too high--sucks too much processor power
(c) movie sucks anyway. Thanx tho."
