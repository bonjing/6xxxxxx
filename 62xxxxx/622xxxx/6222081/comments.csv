It's extremely sad and frustrating at the statistics and how many people are locked away in jail in Mexico who never did anything, but be at the wrong place, at the wrong time. If you have no money, there is no way to prove your innocents. In Mexico they put 20 people or more in one jail cell and do not feed anyone, if it was not for their loved ones, the people in jail would die from starvation.

I have visited Mexico over a dozen of times and have saw first hand the corruption that takes place there. I have witnessed policia and federales taking bribes.

Share this movie with your friends and family and let them know the truth about the corrupt Mexican Government and their evil ways."
