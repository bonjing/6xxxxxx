,sell-out,2011-03-12T16:37Z,"not a good move as you have now lost your own identity uploading for that crappy group,cant believe you sold out, they only want you for promoting that site,man what a downfall :("
[V],prashant22,2011-03-12T18:25Z,"@cell-out
who r u to decide that that grp is bad..
hdscene's owner dumped his own grp so i had to leave it..
nd i hv nt lost my identity..its just for 2-3 torrents..i will upload with that account so no problems there..."
,apple016,2011-03-12T18:36Z,"this is not good.where is ur name ????
no offense dude but i really like ur name.we dnt want any caln name or team name.man !!!!! what can i say.but its not good u sold out name!!! really??
i dnt like it.sorry for rage.but....
any way 1 qus. what abt people who knw u as goku and prashant??? what i they do type ur name in search box????"
,apple016,2011-03-12T18:39Z,"and im sorry for that rage.but im fan of yours and that gives me ryt to show what i think of you......{may be u wont care},or ur upload. (but not in bad manners)"
,sell-out,2011-03-12T19:03Z,"you must be talking about thefalcon007 who also sold out to the same group as you,and they wont be happy if you upload other torrents under your own name now,but you already know that,you could have still used the HDScene on your headings but you sold out,and saying its for 2-3 uploads only,well thats just not true is it.
"
,muk0690,2011-03-12T19:33Z,"@sell-out: Bringing you a torrent involves many things. Think of that, and think twice before you post anything

@apple016: Read prashant22's last comment. I think you should take up some english classes."
,apple016,2011-03-12T20:34Z,"ok 1st thing 1st.
CORRECTION 
""what i they do type......."" i=if
@muk0690 
when i wrote my 1st comment.there were no comment by prashant as TPB shows ryt now{just before my comment}.so that's not my fault at all.
and abt my English yeah its kindaa bad,im working on it,till then do not read my comment.ok

but still im not happy with ""name changing move""
there are too many reason for that im against this move.. but hey who cares??? so dnt bother muk0690"
[V],prashant22,2011-03-12T20:48Z,"@apple
dude u wont see my name in the torrent thats all..bt after 2-3 torrents i will upload with my this account only...n u can see my name in the description of torrent...
and its the team that helps me to provide u movies with fast speed...so that u can download them with ur max speed...

@sell-out
who r u anyway..if i m right u never posted on my torrents..suddeny u appear taking indirect side or i should say direct side of hdscene...someone belonging to hdscene??
or a hater of etrg??
well whoever u r i dont care..."
,apple016,2011-03-12T21:28Z,"thx prashant.
if its about 2-3 torrents .then there is no problem.
thx again for getting my point.the point was where ever you go we go with you(atleast me) but whats the point to give away your name??
now i got my answers so i dnt have any queries.
topic closed (on my behalf) 
Dling ur black swan..."
[V],prashant22,2011-03-12T21:43Z,"@apple
no problems mate...i know what u ment to say..bt when a grp provides some benifit to u it has some rules too...in all if u get something u lose something too...

,sell-out,2011-03-13T12:07Z,"thats rip 2 from prashant22 the renegade,lets see if hes true to his word when he says its just for 2-3 torrents,and for everyones information HDScene is still active,http://thepiratebay.org/search/(HDScene-Release)/0/99/0 this guy just sold out"
[V],prashant22,2011-03-13T12:45Z,"@sell-out
i never said its nt active...i said its owner dumped it...i didnt sold out..i left by my choice there's nothing left of it now..they dont hv seedbox(as thats the only reason i joined hdscene because with my speed i cannot provide big sized movies)...although u must know everything already looking at ur knowledge abt it...surely one of them as i said earlier...whats the point in being part of a grp whose leader is only nt true to his/her words..."
,hardik_860,2011-03-14T15:37Z,"will u do robot  in hindi ?
