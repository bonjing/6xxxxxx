After being left to die in a botched attack, Da Wardenz want justice. You take the role of a rookie tank operator who wants to join them in their fight. To get in with Da Wardenz, you must battle your way through 25 missions, which will take you to exotic locations like Paraguay and Mostvia Vatska. Luckily, you are behind the controls of an M-13 Predator tank, and there are a wide array of weapons to use during each mission, including cannons, chain guns, and surface-to-air missiles. Between missions, you have an opportunity to upgrade the various parts of your tank like armor, chain-gun coolants, reload mechanisms, better targeting computers, traction, offensive air support, and engine upgrades. If you can impress the Da Wardenz, you will survive the action in SHELLSHOCK.
