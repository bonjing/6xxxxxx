Ghost World (2001)

Director: Terry Zwigoff

Rebecca: â€œFace it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth.â€
Enid: â€œThatâ€™s not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo-bohemian art-school losers!â€

The first time I saw this movie, I wondered if there were secret tapes of my girlhood somewhere. Eerily reminiscent of my own bored, suburban teen years, where there was nothing to do except drink alarming amounts of coffee, shop for weird second-hand clothes, and bitch endlessly about high school (openly nicknamed Auschwitz), Ghost World may be the first popular film about the real life of girls. Sure, thereâ€™s Heathers, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and endless other stuff which is supposed to unleash oneâ€™s inner 15-year-old bitch, but Ghost World really comes the closest for me.

Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) graduate from high school and promptly opt out of going to college. Instead, Rebecca spends the summer looking for an apartment and schlepping lattes to losers, freaks and perverts (â€œbut those are our people!â€ exclaims Enid) while Enid develops an interest in Seymore (Steve Buscemi), a local record collector. Forced to attend a remedial art class, (Illeana Douglas has a hilarious minor role as the flaky art teacher, complete with weird hair, purple batik clothing, and bad video art) Enid soon takes her talent for fucking with people to a whole new level when she uses racist advertising from the 1930s as a found art object. Amid the mean-but-funny pranks, Enid also finds time to help Seymore date, while she and Rebecca grow further and further apart. Filled with lines like â€œGo die, asshole!â€ and â€œOhmigod, theyâ€™re Satanists!â€, Ghost World captures the warmth and bitchiness of real friendship, set against a lurid backdrop of American suburban sprawl. I laughed, I cried, it was better than The Vagina Monologues.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
