This concert, filmed at the Sartoryâ€“Sale
in Cologne in July 1981 for the German
Rockplast TV series, followed hot on the
heels of the release of UB40â€™s second
album, "Present Arms", which, like its
predecessor, hit the No.2 spot on the UK
charts and came just two years after the
bandâ€™s first gig in their home town of
Birmingham.

The set list, drawn almost exclusively
from those first two albums, includes all
their early hits and shows what an accom-
plished live act they already were. A
perfect record of the early days of UB40.
