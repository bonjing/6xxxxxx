Mike Zito is a rocker at heart, influenced by his AOR heroes and the music 

he grew up with living from St. Louis to Texas. There's a distinct blues 

element present on this, his fifth CD, but it is subsumed by the 

Southern-style rock & roll songs he has developed and refined. Playing tunes 

that define his life, Zito's music needs little explanation or embellishment -- 

he's as straightforward as they come, with no punches pulled. He's prone to 

get funky on occasion, or go into acoustic unplugged mode, but for the most 

part, he sticks to tried-and-true upbeat rock songs such as "Love Like This" 

and "Universe," which define where he's at. The autobiographical "Time To 

Go Home" seems to show that as much as he loves this life, he's quite able to 

leave it behind and head for the shed. A tough yet soulful singer, Zito's 

guitar playing is not all that remarkable, but he gets the job done, and 

occasionally reflects Wes Montgomery's chords and stingers. What makes 

this recording a cut above is the excellent backing bands he mixes and 

matches, including keyboardist Benmont Tench, backup vocalists Theresa 

James or CeCe Bullard, bassist Hutch Hutchinson, drummer Tony 

Braunagel, and horn players Joe Sublett and Darrell Leonard, all pulled 

together by executive producer Randy Chortkoff. While there's a 

consistency within the repeated same thing, Zito's got a world of potential, 

and he's just scratching the surface.
