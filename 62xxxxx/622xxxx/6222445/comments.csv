Explorer.exe isn't a safe process to kill. It is Windows itself. Perhaps you meant iexplore.exe? That's just Internet Explorer, so that's safe to kill.

Other than that, Great Guide!"

explorer.exe is not ""Windows itself."" It is only the application Windows Explorer, and is perfectly safe to close and reopen. It will free up some of your processing power and RAM for resource-intensive tasks.

Also, even though I place info about the Dolphin emulator in several torrents that does not necessarily mean that this or any other game is supported yet (although it probably eventually will be)."
