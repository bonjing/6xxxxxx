Thanks AbAmerican for the download. I give you my personal pink skull."
,Zamrig242,2011-10-11T14:33Z,"Here are links to non-english scene subs for Rush Hour 2 and 3.  I am new and don't know how to upload just yet, but will get them up ASAP.  These both appear to be working well.  Just change the name of the file to the same as the movie file keeping the '.srt' extension and play with a VLC player.  The VLC player will automatically play the subtitles when opened, as long as the file names match.

Rush Hour 2:
