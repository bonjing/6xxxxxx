Description:
Dragon Saga is a unique, 3D side-scrolling MMORPG that closely resembles arcade classics like Gauntlet Legends, as well as PC Action MMORPGs like GhostX or Dungeon Fighter Online. The game used to be called Dragonica Online and was published by THQ, but since Gravity Interactive took over the service Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ they renamed the game to Dragon Saga. In some parts of the world the game is still called Dragonica Online. Those that are tired of  traditional side scrolling games like MapleStory and Wind Slayer should find that Dragon Saga is genuinely different gaming experience; and a fun one at that. Dragon Saga is one of the best free-to-play titles of 2009, so make sure to check it out. The gameÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s four starting classes are:

Warrior - Warriors are the traditional Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£tankÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ class in Dragon Saga. They have a large pool of hit points and are effective in melee combat but have little ranged damage.

Thief Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ Thieves, like in most games, are proficient at dealing damage and rely on their agility to attack rapidly in combat. Even though they can deal large amounts of damage they are vulnerable in melee combat as they have donÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³t have nearly as many hit points as a warrior.

Magician - The Magician in Dragon Saga is the basic spell caster of the game.  They have both supportive and offensive spells and can better specialize after their first job advancement. They are extremely weak in melee range as they have the least hit points in the game.

Archer Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ The archer class in Dragon Saga is proficient with both bow weapons and can deal a fair amount of damage from a distance but is vulnerable in melee range. They have more hit points than a Magician but less than a Warrior.
