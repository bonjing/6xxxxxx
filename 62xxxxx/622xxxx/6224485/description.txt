Considering the film makers never released a soundtrack for the movie, I decided to make my own. They did release a CD containing the music score from the movie which I have also included in the torrent, but not the actual songs heard throughout the movie. 

I compiled the songs from different sources, so the bit rate, quality, and volume leveling do vary some. For songs that appear in the movie as elevator muzak, I have included the songs by their original artists.
