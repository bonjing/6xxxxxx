FLAC versions of Bad Romance, Monster and Dance In The Dark - the three tracks from The Fame Monster that got awkwardly censored on the standard CD release (some CD releases left them uncensored, likely where these files were sourced from)

I didn't feel the need to include versions of the 5 intact tracks
