The Low Anthem is an indie folk band based in Providence, Rhode Island. The band rose to prominence with the release of their album Oh My God, Charlie Darwin. The album was originally self-released by the band in September 2008, and was later re-released by Nonesuch Records in America and British label Bella Union in Europe.

Smart Flesh:

From December 2009 until February 2010, the band recorded their third album, Smart Flesh, in the abandoned Porinoâ€™s pasta sauce factory in Central Falls, RI. The album was engineered by Jesse Lauter and mixed by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes). The album was released February 22, 2011. The band released "Ghost Woman Blues", the first song on the record as a free download in December on their website. The band appeared again on The Late Show with David Letterman on January 12, 2011, performing "Ghost Woman Blues".

Listening to The Low Anthemâ€™s breakthrough album â€“ 2009â€™s Oh My God, Charlie Darwin â€“ was a jarring experience. It was a clashing of two genres: profoundly moving acoustic folk and raucous blues-rock. The clash was so marked, it sounded like two separate bands. But the album was roundly praised by critics, who claimed that the two tones combined to capture a vision of America that was grounded in tradition but evolving and fragmented.

Whether you agree or not, it was a tough listen. Smart Flesh plays no such games. Its tone is more unified, dominated by the sensitive end of The Low Anthemâ€™s spectrum: while its predecessor is difficult to define, Smart Flesh is unquestionably a folk album, a record of acoustic guitars, banjos, vocal harmonies and timeless tales. The rock is still there on Hey, All You Hippies! and Boeing 737, but now it pours out in a more controlled fashion â€“ so as not to stamp all over the delicacy of the other songs, but to complement them. Indeed, Boeing 737 is a huge, stomping anthem that sounds like Bob Dylan fronting Arcade Fire. If The Low Anthem donâ€™t release it as a single, theyâ€™re mad.





The rest of the album is easy-going and mellifluous, songs built on the simplest of patterns. Each songwriter takes their turn, but the voices donâ€™t compete with each other. So Ben Knox Millerâ€™s Love and Altar, which shares a similar angelic tone to Bon Iver, blends seamlessly into Jeff Prystowskyâ€™s Matter of Time, even though the latterâ€™s vocal is gravellier. And then we get Jocie Adamsâ€™s clarinet solo on Wire, which is stunning.

Fans of Oh My God, Charlie Darwin may be disappointed by just how well Smart Flesh hangs together, and there is certainly an argument to be had here about whether this more unified sound is a little too predictable, a little too easy, to keep you gripped. There are lulls amongst these 11 tracks when your mind starts to wander â€“ Burn doesnâ€™t deserve its slot after Wire, and should have been dropped altogether, while some of the albumâ€™s later tracks seem to mimic what has gone before. An injection of passion towards the end would have helped: without it, Smart Flesh comes across as a little too atonal to be described as a classic.
