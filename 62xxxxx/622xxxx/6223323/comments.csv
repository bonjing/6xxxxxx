V = 5.5/6

Fast DL and scan thru the movie, not bad for a cam (a little dark in spots), audio is in synch and this is the whole movie.  Worth the DL if u cannot wait for DVDRip.

Thanks for up miguel1983!"
,audi_gal,2011-03-20T15:39Z,"haven't had a chance to watch the movie but i found the quality ok skimming thru it, bit dark like a PPVRIP or bootleg copy...thanks anyhow!"
,audi_gal,2011-03-21T05:34Z,"Justed finished the movie..it's pretty funny and totally chick flick as well another good movie asides from ""The Breakup"" considering how her other ones were not the greatest..this copy is totally bootleg, camera kept on shifting thru some scenes..good to watch if you can't wait to get the DVDRip..thanks again :)"
,Downlo22,2011-03-27T06:35Z,Audio is About 2-5 Seconds Off from the film... Other than that the Video And Audio Are great
