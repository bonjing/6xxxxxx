"Inostranka"

Newly appointed Alaskan Senator Catherine 
Lewis (guest star Virginia Madsen, 
"Sideways") threatens to divulge 
information about the Mt. Inostranka 
detention facility on an episode of 
"HARDBALL with Chris Matthews" (playing 
himself). Elsewhere, Sean (Jason Ritter) 
and Leila (Sarah Roemer) get a fresh lead 
on the whereabouts of Samantha, but it 
leads them to a dramatic turn in their 
lives. James Dempsey (guest star Hal 
Holbrook, "Water for Elephants") foresees 
that he and Sean will once again cross 
paths.

Enjoy :)
