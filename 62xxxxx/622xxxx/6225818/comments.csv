,mike18xx2,2012-01-19T09:53Z,{C_P}'s video quality is just as crappy now as it was five or ten years. Are they still using DIVX on a Pentium III?
,Llwynog,2012-04-07T05:53Z,"@mike18xx2 I have to agree with you about the quality. But since we can't afford Cable, and since PS3 Media Server struggles with MKVs and won't play MP4s at all, I can't be terribly picky so I have to take my AVIs where I can get them â no matter how much they suck.

I have good copies of every ep of B10UA except 1x16-1x20 so I'm getting them from this torrent since they're the only AVIs I can find. As grateful as I am to be able to watch the show at all, I really do wish AVIs worth watching were available."
