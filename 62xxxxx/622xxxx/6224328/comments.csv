,bloodandregret,2011-03-07T03:50Z,"DS113 is right. Significant chunks.

TvTeam is awesome - this is a freak occurrence."
,sonambula,2011-03-07T04:58Z,"Yes, the part of the intro after the previously on being human & before the black being human screen appears there is picture but no sound.  From 00:18 to 3:43, a whole conversation between Herrick & McNare. Sorry if you think I've just spoiled part of the episode for you.  But I don't think so 'cause I have no fucking idea what the were talking about but it look GOOOOOOD. I hope this is the only silent chunk. Is there a better download out there of tonight's episode?"

Not a fix but better than nothing until the video with sound is found"
