i hope that TPB develops a way that user reputation is placed, so no one can download a torrent if their reputation is under 10. 

that would prevent 90% of the stupidity and ignorance.

It's impossible to seed something you don't have...

oh but you are completely wrong mate!I was downloading with 300-400 kB/s while i was Uploading by 900 kB/s (hit 1.0 mB/s as well) It's how you set up your utorrent.It's just that ppl think that if they limit their upload to minimum they will get more speed...THat so moronically wrong!The Speed is Proportional to the upload..So if you share 80% during your download you get you optimum speed.

,Oroles,2011-03-09T12:35Z,"Guys, stop asking for the hi-res pack. Bioware didn't include it in the initial release. If you want it, just go to the Bioware social forums and download it from there, just like it was with the DA patches.
For those that don't want to use google, here's the link: http://social.bioware.com/forum/Dragon-Age-II/Dragon-Age-II-PC-Technical-Self-Help/Download-the-High-Resolution-Texture-Pack-for-Dragon-Age-II-6392956-1.html
As for the release, I hope that the full game has something special to offer, hopefully from the innovative storytelling. The demo did not impress me in regards to the combat, it seemed like they shifted DA to a more asian-like rpg (I'm referring to the weird, non-realistic animations for some skills).

Registered an account just to mention: DON'T expect DA:O The Clone. This game is very different, not better, not worse, just different. Give it a chance before creaming how it's not really Dragon Age. Yes, it has been dumbed down from my point of view (thanks to console-sucking orientation everything has been changed more or less in order to accomodate XBOX/PS3) but it's still a great action RPG. Yes, I miss Zevran, Loghain & the crew and I'd really like an epic proportion to this game, but it's a good game nevertheless."

Well, then you're an idiot if you got all butt hurt and rage-quit after an hour. Who the fuck only plays a game for an hour and makes a complete assessment of it? The only reason it got bad ratings was because /v/ bombed that site with bullshit ""reviews"". It's a great game, i'm like 11 hours in and i'm not even out of the city yet. And it's a LOT like Origins... but oh right, you played for a whole 60 minutes so you know everything - i forgot.

And it's PAID you moron... not payed. Kill yourself.

@WingsOfDespaireh

It was fine for me with Hi-Rez textures and using DirectX 11, but i could only set the game graphics on 'high', not 'very high'. But then i updated my nvidia driver with the BETA release specifically for DA:2 and now i have everything at max and it runs great(and looks gorgeous - see pic below). Try going to your cards official site and looking for a newer/beta update.

Update your rig, dudes... you think games are gonna get any less intensive graphically? Buy a card that can support DX11. You're gonna have to eventually.

It's not really slow mind you, but I am not getting 250kb/sec or anything like. More like 10-50kb/sec.

You mean Bioware? I don't think EA had anything to do with creating this game. At least not from the development aspect.

If you're looking for more of a strategic game then go find one, there are tons out there... i'm sick of people hating on games like ME and DA because they're not super faggy like the Final Faggotry games. Those games are shit. This game is awesome. Enough said."

I've yet to encounter a game that doesn't run maxed out on my 3 year old rig. Also, when games start using engines that have considerably more advanced and worthwhile DX11 capabilities (like the upcoming Unreal Engine 3), I'll buy a new card.

What I'm getting at is that the so called DX11 only features in DA2 are bullshit. You need DX11 to use high resolution textures? Ambient occlusion? Even anisotropic filtering? Really? Because I've played plenty of games with said features in DX9. I'd wager that BioWare were paid or pressured by EA, who hold marketing contracts with GPU manufacturers, to disable these features in DX9 in order to entice people to buy cards that are, for the moment, not even required."

But it seems to me if a file sharing program could intelligently divide which pieces go to those 15k+ people, it would more rapidly spread them to everyone.

Either people aren't uploading what they downloaded, or the torrent software/spec doesn't spread the pieces intelligently around, and is maybe causing the seeders to send the same parts to everyone rather than distribute new parts?

I was disappointed in the lack of personalization however, seems like everyone's mage will be the same save for the choices in specialization. At least rogues and warriors have varied weapons.

This was posted by a member of the Bioware team yesterday...


""I dusted off my wife's old single core machine and was able to reproduce the problem last night.

The problem is the game cannot save. This presents itself as three symptoms:
--You get a perpetual ""saving"" spinner on the right.
--Your save + load options are greyed out in the ""escape menu""
--You will hang on the next transition after a save is attempted (which for most people is at the end of the blightlands, because the initial autosave is still trying to save).

Programming is working on the problem now. I don't have an ETA on a fix, but we have been able to recreate it, which means we can work on fixing it now."""

You don't look much better than that other guy by your comment.

I had no goal, but my plan was to make him realize he's being a faggot. People have tried to help him, but he chooses to scream and yell instead of using his head. I just can't stand these complete idiots that blame everyone but themselves when they are too stupid to do something. Asking questions is fine, that's what these comments are mostly intended for, but becoming hostile and a complete fucktard towards everyone because he has the mental capacity of a retarded monkey is idiotic and pathetic.

I was merely putting him in his place, and now, look at his above comment... he may be disrespecting me, for obvious reasons, but now he's learned to appreciate the other users. Exactly what my plan was. No need to thank me.

Although i'm sure it would be *super* fun.

Secondly, i was never ""acting"" like anything, you(on your ""sos21"" account) were the one threatening random people and saying you would kick their asses IRL on a goddamn TPB comment page, not me, dipshit. I only said that to *you* so you could see how idiotic you sound. And look at you, you're *still* raging mad... lol.

So listen up @sos21(don't try to act like it's not you - why else are you so raging mad? lol), my invitation stands... i'm right here in TO, if you wanna back up your shit. I'm rational, though, i made that invite when i had no idea where you lived - i was hoping you did live in TO, it was a long shot, but then again, you were the one talking shit.

It's really not that easy, I've been trying to find out how to do it for 5 hours now. I've read through countless outdated guides that won't work anymore, and downloaded like 50 different programs, read through the entire hex code of it to try and somehow figure out which line is the Security software line.

This is a beta release also so it probably won't be cracked unless somehow we get lucky and there is a computer programmer who had a single core for some reason and experienced this issue."

,pamejudd,2011-03-12T22:17Z,"Download worked perfect for me. 

Pity that the game is crap.


If I bought it, I'd feel cheated: an arcade-like retarded hack&slash isn't what I expected after first DA. It's more like the Mass Effect but with swords and magic. 

Did you guys know that there's now not even a  chance to miss an opponent? That's right! Your heroes will hit all the time, but deal different damage. Kinda helps as the enemies come in waves (that's right, they spawn right behind your back or in front of you). 

Of course, one can't cast offensive spells outside of  battle mode, so no element of surprise in your tactics. Spell combinations are no longer there (that's right: you can't shatter an enemy that has been frozen or petrified). Apparently this was too confusing to console players...

And guess what: you can't buy armor to your party members! Seriously! They wear only their own armors. This was meant probably so that console morons can know who's in their party at the moment


Screw Bioware!

Prettier Aveline(let's face it, she's fucking ugly)
Reduced cool downs for spells(easier to play on harder difficulty)
Alistair redone(much better looking Alistair, Bioware failed)
Better hair for Isabel(pirate bandanna gets old)
Varric's ""bustier"" version of Bethany(can use the pre-game version of Bethany now)
Anders redone(less pussy looking Anders)
Chargen adds(lets you use default hair/beards on custom characters, as well as tattoos/freckles and other stuff)

Yeah, only Hawke can get different types of armors. You can still find auto-upgrades for your companion's armor, but they will look the same.

However, after you romance certain companions, their outfits will change entirely. For example, after Merrill moves in with you, she gets an all white Dalish type outfit. I haven't seen the others yet."

1. Mount the iso file with daemon tools, run it and start the installation.

2. When it asks for serial open the iso file using winrar, go into the 'Crack' folder and run the keygen.

3. Paste the serial into the installation

4. When it finishes, do not run the game, go into the crack folder again, copy the dragonage2.exe

5. Go to my computer, c; folder, program files, Dragon age 2, bin_ship folder, paste, replace file. 

6. Create shortcut of that file onto ur desktop and use that to launch game.

Run it and press generate a few times, then copy and paste the code in.

Everyone else, there is a problem with certain Nvidia cards and this game. If your having problems PLEASE do check your Nividia drivers are up to date and if that doesn't work play it in DX9 and NOT DX11.

I don't know if the new 1.1 patch has fixed this problem or not. But seeing as you can't install a genuine patch on this RELOADED version until they release their own patch themselves we'll never know until then."

Make sure you've updated your drivers. I know for Nvidia, they put out a beta driver pretty much specifically for this game. I was getting bad lag with HiRez textures on DX11, but it's running great on max settings after i installed the beta update."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-18T18:56Z,"@Sepher

Definitely NOT a ""shit game"". Try playing the entire game before making silly statements like that. I realize that's just your opinion, but if you liked the first one you'll like this one... apparently, you didn't like the first one, i guess.

The story is not nearly as captivating as Origins, that's true, but everything else has been improved. I also think that maybe Bioware rushed this released, and yes, it wasn't everything it could have been... but a ""shit game"", i think not."
,kahuna08,2011-03-18T20:01Z,"If you think this is a shit game, you don't know anything. The streamlining aspects of this sequel do not negate the RPG elements of it at all.

,remedy2,2011-03-19T04:37Z,"Ok I finished the game.  Just a few opinions.  At first I hated it but it grew on me by the time I got to the end. Its true its not as good as DAO mainly because the storyline is not nearly as interesting but it is still a decent game.  A few positives and negatives:

Positives:
1.  Looks better (as it should, its newer)
2.  Faster action which is nice
3.  Got rid of gifts for the most part to buy a character's love/friendship
4.  Waves of fighters so you don't really know what you are truly up against when you go into a fight (mixed feelings on this being a positive- it kind of sucks to get your ass kicked hard and think its over and another stronger wave comes to make it even harder but in the end it makes it more interesting)

Negatives:
1. Game play get repetitive.  Yes you fight different enemies but its the same fighting over and over.  Maybe have some of the quests involve puzzles or something other than fighting.
2. You get stuck in the same city for the whole game. 
3. Armor and weapons system kind of sucks now.  Boring looking inventory, can't change party armor for the most part
4. Can't talk to your party now except for set scenes
5. Crafting really sucks, you hardly get any crafting items along the way and you can't craft anything yourself.
6. Loot sucks, you get a bunch of junk unusable items.  It makes no sense.
7. Sex scenes suck

Anyway if I hadn't played DAO and was just rating the game on its merits I'd give it an 8 out of 10.  If I were to rate it compared to DAO I'd be at 6.  "

""7. Sex scenes suck""

Really? I've only seen both the Isabel and Merrill scene's(just one each so far, not sure if there are more), but i thought they were a huge improvement over the ones in DAO.

I'm sure, down the road, some modder will come along and completely redesign the romance scenes anyway, just like DAO. lol"

,inmate223,2011-03-20T04:54Z,"All the negative reviews are coming from people who are pissed it doesn't play like DA:O.

Here's a hint, if you want to play DA:O go play DA:O. Wow that was hard wasn't?

This game is fine. It may not be GotY material, but its fine nonetheless. That's the bottom line."
,remedy2,2011-03-20T07:23Z,"Before getting pissed at the game, play it through.  Its different than DAO but grows on you.  Its still a good game, yes I'm a little disappointed it wasn't better, but its an entertaining game.

The bottom line is DAO was a revolutionary game that was a home run for bioware.  Can't expect every game to be like that."
,saforetas,2011-03-20T11:40Z,"IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS GAME, READ IT CAREFULLY! 

I am a true fan of DAO, I completed both the original story and Awakening. Everything looked perfect: the story, the combat system, graphics, audio, conversations, controls, everything. But Dragonage II is not like that. 1) CONVERSATIONS AND AUDIO: they're too modern. I am sure that many words that are spoken by the characters couldn't have been used in such ages. And those voices of dwarves sound like they were done by teenagers or some very young men who ridiculously emphasize their tone and make it sound even more childish. 2) GRAPHICS: I wouldn't advice setting to Directx 11. It will significantly slow the game down. And all the shapes will look more blurry. And this will be very unrealistic and poor. Using Directx 9 automatically sets the graphic details to 'medium'. You won't be able to use 'high' or 'very high' settings. But the game will look better (not as good as DAO though) and it will run smoothly. 2) THE COMBAT SYSTEM: have you ever played Devil May Cry 3 or 4? Well, you will play it again. The combat system looks like one-on-one mortal kombat with some nonsensical fatalities. The character moves so fast and jumps so high that you will be forced to press mouse button 10 times a second! Fighting groups you will also have to be able to click on the desired enemy. But because of their super fast movement, it will be hard. Well, speaking about gore and body parts flying over your head, such things speak for themselves. 3) CONTROLS: they're changed too. Inventory, level-up screens look too simple and boring. There is not much choices you can make either about skills or things you acquire. And to think of 'junk' items place was the worst idea ever! Such term as 'junk' doesn't go together with olden-times inventory. Except if the character has some junk food. Abilities and their usage are too modern too. Even at the 2nd level you have some abilities to make 2 or 3 darkspawn dead with one click! Is it interesting? Decide for yourselves. 

So, there is no way we can compare the good old DAO with this DA II. Too many bad 'improvements' and choices. The game is too modernized. Nothing reminds me of old ages. If there were some cars in the game, that would really suit it. Obviously, we can't say the same about DAO. "
,dwatson,2011-03-20T12:53Z,"valterZz, you speak the truth! my advice to anyone wanting to play this game, DONT BOTHER. just start a new file on morrowind or oblivion until 11.11.11. all other RPG's should weep at the feet of the elder scrolls series."

,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-03-20T16:25Z,"People who are saying this game sucks have no idea what they are talking about, or are comparing this game to something else entirely.

Bottom line is: If you loved DAO, you'll enjoy playing this as well. The story may not pull you in as well as it did in Origins, The characters may not seem as deep, but it's still fun to play and a decent game by anyone's standards. As long as they don't fuck up ME3, i'll forgive Bioware for not making DA2 another epic tale like DAO.

@remedy2

Have you played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood yet? I must say, there's a sex scene early on in that game that puts Bioware's sexual related cut scene's to shame. It's like Bioware doesn't really put a lot of thought into making their cut scene's realistic."

Check your graphics card's web page for any updated drivers, even beta drivers.

No way!!!!!!
A torrent that has a keygen/crack (Illegal files that make use of code that it shouldn't) is detected as a virus? :O, this is groundbreaking.

You're possibly the smartest person I've ever seen on the internet, How many award have you won for winning at the Internet? 

You must also know alot about hacking/cracking/code in general considering how you have totally different views than the top computer experts ie (you don't believe that false positives are a thing) why don't you share some of your genius with us and write an E-Book?

And yeah we should definitely contact piratebay and have them remove extremezone, but then again with your prowess of computer hacking and code you should be able to remove him easily, You should also be able to take his virus infected files and clean them of viruses aka (delete the cracks/keygens out of them).

He saved my computer, but now I have to use my laptop cause my computer doesn't really turn on anymore. But at least it has no viruses.

I would honestly like to see this guy get a few honorary awards from this site, have some awards made up or something for (most contributed) and (smartest).

I would buy it, but due to the UK's economy crisis. It's just not happening. Piracy is there for some people as a resort to play games, without losing money which is important to their facilities. Fuck my life, minimum wage and a shit job.   However, this game is perfect in my eyes. For some reason, I can only play this game, instead of playing the first. Kudos for Bioware, now I look forward for DLC for this, Mass Effect II and I await eagerly for Mass Effect III. A perfect RPG and every choice has a massive impact on the game.

,tdsand,2011-03-28T22:54Z,"BEFORE YOU PLAY: There are a couple optional companions, Isabela and Sebastian, the latter of which require additional DLC, but both of which you should research before using.  Their companion effects can have a PERMANENT, GAME BREAKING negative impact on your character which you won't start to notice until you're well into your playthrough, and it will likely make it nearly impossible to finish the game on hard or perhaps even on normal.  Research this bug on the guild wars wiki or google or elsewhere before using either of these characters as there is no official fix for the problem at all yet.

On a completely unrelated note, and good news for some: I'm running it on low video settings (and sometimes on medium) at 16:9 with a SINGLE CORE pentium 4 3.0 ghz processor, 2.75 gigs ram, and an HD 5670.  My processor is obviously the bottleneck and occasionally maxes out at 100%, but the game does run perfectly smoothly at these settings on this old processor."

Maybe next time they'll get it right again.  Then, I'll buy it.

,slask25,2011-04-22T08:12Z,"@homemdafaina

Complaining about a game you didn't buy, on a torrent thread for the pirated copy of said game...right. Like Bioware and EA will ever read it, and if they however unlikely, ever did, they wouldn't give a damn, cause guess what, you're not a customer, you're just a leech in their eyes... 

Anyway, game is ok. First act is crap though, but the second picks up the pace, and the third is quite the ride."

1.) Do I leave it there? Or do i put it in the installer folder.
2.) When I selected play, it said I must activate it with EA, and then proceeded to tell me that my serial code was not valied (haha), and said i must activate before I can play, what can I do to stop this?"

I used windows search to search my whole comp and it hasn't found a single occurrence of a file or application called installbinship. Can someone please tell me where this thing is? Also, when I am copying the cracked content from the Crack dir, do I copy the keygen as well or just that other file ""DragonAge2"". Thanks in advance."
,OOHFFS,2011-04-29T14:55Z,"Something else just happened, I installed the game anyway and it made some kinda date check and i was like ok. Now it's asking me for a product key so it can check online with EA. Problem is the product key I used doesn't work and neither does any key I generate after that. Does this have something to do with me not moving that crack file to the installbinship? Cuz if it does plz tell wtf is installbinship and where I can find it."
,OOHFFS,2011-04-29T15:06Z,"Right I just did something: I unzipped every single thing in the data and sent it to a different folder. Instead of getting the 6GB i was meant, some folder called bin_Ship just popped up with the crack already in it. WTF just happened there."
,kingblue12,2011-04-29T18:34Z,"To get the crack working and skip the registration part, you need to locate the crack in the cd drive aftre you mount and install it. In side the folder named ""Crack"" there will be a .exe called DragonAge2. Find that and copy it to  c:/programfiles/Dragonage2/bin_ship Once copied you can create a shortcut to your desktop, or any other place. That should work. For the Very start when you need to put in the serial code, inside the cd drive, inside the folder named ""Crack"" there will be another .exe , that is the Key gen. Simply run it and copy the serial. I really hope this helps everyone that is stuck. :D"

,OOHFFS,2011-05-01T13:18Z,Can someone please explain to me how patching this game works when it's cracked? I just downloaded the new patch (1.02) and it made my game not work anymore because when I turned it on I was back at the product key page and had to register and EA account. So I recopied the cracked file into the bin_ship and it works again. However does that mean the patch is still in effect or not? Do we just have to do this for every patch then?
,DamonCA,2011-05-01T18:40Z,"Having a little bit of trouble here. I installed Dragon Age 2, then I mounted the image and proceeded to install it.

,Sivos,2011-05-02T20:11Z,"@OOHFFS  The thing about cracks is that most of them only work for certain patches.  Since you downloaded the patch, you are going to have to look for the crack that works for that patch.  It's not as hard as it might sound, try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6358576/%5BFTL3%5D_DRAGON_AGE_2_VERSION_1.02_CRACK     it shouldn't take long to download, probably at least 15 minutes."

,silencesummer,2011-06-19T09:15Z,"Worked perfect, thanks!

The game itself was OK, I just beat it the other day, but it lacked significantly compared to Origins."
,sbuck333,2011-06-20T02:01Z,"For anyone crashing at the opening cinematic, here is my advice: Re-mount the torrent navigate to the directx folder, and run the direct x set up. Let it update and check your components again. Afterwards, go to configuration. Change to DX9 just for the opening few minutes. Afterwards, if you have sufficient hardware and a DX11 graphics card, you can change back. I believe there is just some minor DX11 bug that occurs in that one scene.

I am about to try and patch the high detail textures in, anyone had any luck with that?

cheers and thanks again mate, excellent torrent"

,harryham1,2011-07-07T07:39Z,"@gun007freak
The problem is that this relies on something by Nvidia (like a lot of games). I think due to the crack it does not install physx automatically (see what they did there. They took physics, and, you know what, never mind).
Download here: (replace DOT with .)

I also restarted the computer, after downloading was complete, after first installation and after second.

,Gadorach,2011-08-31T05:12Z,"Start From DragonAge2.exe [FAiRLiGHT] 1.03 Cracked EXE.

Open in a hex editor of choice.

If using Hex Workshop, Use the [Find] system (CTRL+F) and switch to the [Range] Tab at the top of the window.

Select the [Custom Range] Radio Button, switch to [Hex] and enter [001A73D0] into the [Starting Offset] box.

In the length section, input [5] or [00000005] (same thing -_-)

Go back to the [Criteria] Tab in the [Find] window

Change the [Type] dropdown box to display [Hex Values] and enter [8B44240456] into the [Value] Box.

Click [Find all instances] and then click Search.

You should come up with only one result. (the [Find all instances] is used to make sure you only have one)

Modify the currently highlighted value (should display [8B 44 24 04 56]) with the value B001C20400.

Save and exit Hex Workshop.

Copy your successfully modifyed EXE to the Dragon Age 2 [Bin_ship] Folder.

Overwrite when prompted (or just backup your old exe and drop your new one in).

Done. (You can Play now, assuming you've already patched and decrypted your DLC)

,Gadorach,2011-08-31T05:18Z,"^^
My tutorial for getting all your DLC working.
You still need to get the DLC, the Cracked 1.03 EXE (By Fairlight) and the Decryptor tools for this to work.
One more Thing, The How-To for the decryptor:

1) Run decrypt_dlc.bat
2) Open the game's install dir and find the [C:\Program Files (x86)\Dragon Age 2\addins] folder.
3) Open all of the folders, one by one, modifying the [manifest.xml] files
   so that at the end of the fourth line says [RequiresAuthorization=""0""] 
   instead of [RequiresAuthorization=""1""].

Also, make sure you Copy the cracked EXE over again after you finish to make sure your DLC didn't overwrite it."

,MatressGiant,2011-10-16T20:36Z,"It's so sad that anymore one must hope people are actually just trolls...

For everyone that actually can't figure this out:

How to get ANY game to work 60% of the time, every time:
Step 1: Read the .nfo file that came with the torrent
Step 2: Follow the numbered instructions within
Step 3: ???
Step 4: Profit

*PRO TIP* If that doesn't work, read comments by other people. Chances are, if you are having a problem after following the very difficult steps above, someone else just as mentally handicapped as yourself has already spammed the comments section about it.

Your an embarrassment to the human race.

,kifkif92,2011-10-23T23:29Z,"Hello everyone ! 
THIS IS A COMPLETE TUTORIAL FOR THIS TORRENT ! READ IT !
1) After downloading the torrent, extract everything with winrar.
2) mount image with daemons tools 
3) install by clicking on setup in the extracted files. do not launch the game, it will ask you key that you don't have (keygen won't work)
4) copy the DragonAge2 file in the crack, and paste it in bin_ship : [ for those who can't find it : it is located in Computer -> C: -> programsFiles -> dragon age 2 ] replace the other .exe file 
5) in bin_ship, click on DragonAge2Config, then go on game and change the direct X version : switch to direct X 9 (it bugs in the intro with dx11)
6) you can create a shortcut anywhere with the Dragonage2.exe you pasted before ; run it.
7) ENJOY AND SEED
8) You're welcome :P"

,Piggelmee11,2011-12-04T16:58Z,"Works great!
just unzip downloaded file, install by running Setup, fill in product key 9WBK-8K66-P6SQ-JA6Q-BA9Q.

A new directory is made: :C//program files/Dragon Age 2. In this directory is a map: bin_ship.

The unzipped image file contains a 'Crack' map that containes 2 files. Copy these files into the bin_ship map in :C//program files/Dragon Age 2.
You have 'overwrite' them when asked.
one of these copied files is a .exe to run Dragon Age 2. ENJOY!"

That means you did it wrong. Don't forge to copy the files from the Crack dir folder to the folder in C: hardrive and use that to run the game."

I have:  256 MB ATI Radeon X1300PRO

All my other hardware passes easily.  This mean i'm not going to be able to play on this cpu?

My laptop has Intel HD (1696 MB) Graphic card w/ i5 but my fan has crapped out so it shuts itself off when it gets hot.  Therefor I cannot play games on it until I replace the fan.  But I should be good to go once I do, right?"
,cl0wn3d,2012-02-26T23:39Z,"@Zala66 
You won't be able to run it, Intel HD graphics forces the other gfx card to run through the HD chip, so it bottlenecks the gpu power. Sorry mate, get a new computer. I recommend something from the MSi manufacturer."
