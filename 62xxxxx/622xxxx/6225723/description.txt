The Bundies are a stereotypical American family. Al is a shoe salesman who is fond of frequently reliving his doubtful 15 seconds of fame on the football field. Al is terrified of the all-to-frequent amorous advances his ditsy wife Peggy, a woman who must spend most of Al\'s wages at the salon and the mall. They have two children : Kelly, the stunning but superficial party animal, and Bud, who is too wrapped up in himself to realize his goal of \"scoring\" with a girl.
