Superman flagship director Richard Donner presents this special cut of the 1980 sequel starring Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel, who's locked in a battle to save Earth from three evil outcasts of planet Krypton. Donner shot footage for Superman II concurrently with the first blockbuster, but director Richard Lester ultimately completed the project. This re-edited version features Donner's original vision, including restored deleted scenes.
