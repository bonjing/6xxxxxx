before anything else... you people please use google.. try the simple words that are giving the title of this software

the first link that appears is related to one of the greatest websites posting applications to be downloaded.

download.cnet.com

me only infiltrating the registation ;) ...oh well and that splash screen saying : ""IT'S SAFE NOW"" , the icon of the installer, the draw from the left within the installer...that's all I did."
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-03-08T20:49Z,"to be fair till the end...I also did one more thing :)))

the way the installer behaves...

meaning the options already ticked for you such as the license agreement   

and also the multi multi multilanguage support added for the installer, ok ?

download.cnet.com wouldn't allow its policy to help software hijacking. With a simple letter to them you could stop this if you think you are right. And even so, I don't give a damn on the issue, use a sniffer on version 2.3 and 3.0 ... and see for yourself where it searches for updates !!!!

I do not follow that official link of yours ... as I am not so stupid to leave even my fake IP there at command ;)))))

As long as this software updates and it does what it did before, at least... let me use it and offer for free to other users, please ;)))
i am trained at one of the romanian ...services, you may imagine i will do a step after I would know the next 5 steps and all the implications :))))))))))))

I like your indian name, India it is a big software maker ;) like China too
