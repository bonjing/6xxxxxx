The note was nice xD
"
,dogmit,2011-04-17T21:30Z,"Thank you kindly!

p.s. Though it's a little weird to make 720p file encoding with DivX :)

Oh, and thanks to cartoon palace releasers."
,muckymucks,2011-04-18T15:58Z,"This torrent is missing 212 and 213. Just a headsup. 

Thanks for the torrent, uploader."
,dogmit,2011-04-20T17:27Z,"Oh, and ""210 - Brain Eraser"" is broken.
On the 7th second the screen freezes and sound disappears, though ""playback"" continues, but it's no use."
,dogmit,2011-04-20T17:45Z,"Maaan, and 211 - benson be gone is broken too."
,enzy,2011-05-15T14:24Z,thanks dude!
,underoath281,2011-06-05T21:10Z,"Just posting to state that Dogmit is wrong.
I just tested episodes 210 and 211 and both play perfectly, 100%.

Someone should recommend a media player to him that doesn't come pre-installed on the computer."
,RunescapePirate,2011-06-28T04:18Z,"@dogmit

,Clipper2010,2011-07-07T04:49Z,"@ underoath281...

WRONG. 

Just because some advanced 3rd party players, like VLC for example, can play bad files does not mean they are not bad.

It is a well intended (but horrible) feature to help people who have to play a media file that is corrupted when alternate copies do not exist. 

Such players were NOT created so that ignorant people can create/defend bad files. Unfortunatly, because of players like VLC, this kind of stupidty seems to be becomming the norm.

Anywho, the files ARE bad. They do NOT deserve to be defended. The creator does NOT deserve to be praised for creating them.

People like you are ruining the digital media scene by misrepresenting bad files as being ok because of your cluelessness and reliance on players that hide & fix problems on the fly."
,Oisterboy,2011-08-08T00:38Z,"@Clipper2010, you seem so comfortable complaining and yet you offer no solutions. Got a problem? Do it better yourself next time. Simple as that. "

,Soulbox119,2011-11-17T10:12Z,"Hey guys, just letting you know, I'll be removing this torrent, tomorrow or the next day and reuploading all the seasons seperately and adding the additional ones i missed."
,Soulbox119,2011-11-17T10:16Z,"Also, sorry for any ""bad files."" Just an uploader using shitty freeware converters. If you have a problem with the torrent, please don't download it."
,iViolence,2011-11-18T22:03Z,I don't know why. Please re-upload.
,Soulbox119,2011-11-25T17:48Z,"lol i tried to delete this torrent multiple times, it won't work lol, so i guess it's staying"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-02-21T00:26Z,"Did anyone bother to read the text file included in this torrent?

It's my personal opinion that perhaps Soulbox119 is Gay!"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-02-21T00:27Z,"Thanks for the UP. I'll go check out the new ""fixd"" 1's"
