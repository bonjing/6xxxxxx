Two 23 year old friends, a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigby, work as groundskeepers at a park and spend their days trying to entertain themselves by any means, much to the chagrin of Benson, a high-tempered gumball machine, and Skips, a yeti, but to the delight of Pops, a naÃ¯ve English gentleman with a lollipop-shaped head. Muscle Man, an overweight and green man, and High-Five Ghost, a ghost with a hand extending from the top of his head, are both neutral about Rigby and Mordecai's shenanigans.[3] The episodes usually revolve around the two's personal life such as obtaining concert tickets, getting food, or making up for a mess they have caused, often leading to highly surreal and unusual events.
