,ioniancat21,2011-03-09T17:42Z,Just so all of you know; WinRAR can be registered using the 3.x Keygen or License File. Simply download the trial and use those old 3.93 keys.........
,NvySEAL667,2011-03-09T19:55Z,"seems to be working for others. for me, the keygen reports that I need to reinstall winrar. it's probably something in my registry. i'm sure i'll figure it out though. thanks bone"
,NvySEAL667,2011-03-09T20:20Z,Registered it with a 3.9x license. Works great :-)
