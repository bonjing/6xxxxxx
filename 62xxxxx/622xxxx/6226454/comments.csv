I've tried several firewalls including Zone Alarm Pro, Symantec, and several others all with the same results.  It could work for weeks then all at once it makes it through.  What it really needs a host file block, but I don't have the addresses to block.  Anyone have any ideas on this?"

I don't really use this tool, can't help you.
Try searching Google, you might find an answer."
