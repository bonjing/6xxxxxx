The husband-and-wife duo of Danny & Tiffany Preston may hail from Los Angeles, but it was a Lebanese Casio keyboard (programmed to play microtonal scales and various Middle Eastern rhythm patterns) that inspired them to create their unique brand of globe-trotting poptronica. Their first full-length album finds them settling into a well-developed and highly personal sound that draws from any number of exotic musical cultures without depending too much on any one of them. The title track offers what may be the perfect introduction: glistening guitar lines, lurching rhythms, dubbed-up baby-doll vocals, wordless whoops, and a tight-but-dreamy melody combine to make one of the more original sounds currently on the market. Sometimes befuddling but never boring, Rainbow Arabia is making music that ultimately sounds like no one elses.
