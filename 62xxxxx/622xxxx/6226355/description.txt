Alien Ant Farm is an American alternative rock band that formed in the southern California city of Riverside in 1995. Their name comes from an idea original guitarist Terry Corso had about aliens and the earth--"I was daydreaming at my dull desk job with my feet up, and I thought to myself, 'Wouldn't it be cool if the human species were placed on earth and cultivated by alien intelligence?' Maybe the aliens added us to an atmosphere that was suitable for us, and they've been watching us develop and colonize, kind of like what a kid does with an ant farm." The band has sold over 1 million units worldwide, and has 4 studio albums, and 8 music videos.
