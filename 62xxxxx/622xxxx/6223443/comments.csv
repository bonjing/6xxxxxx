,Astonvista,2011-03-06T15:59Z,Is it cracked?
,lucid657,2011-03-06T16:04Z,"Why do people keep asking if it's cracked? The exe is encrypted, and the decryption keys come from EA's server. So untill the 8th in the NA, there wont be a crack. You can decrypt it by brute forcing it, but it'll take you a pletheroa of time..."
,Astonvista,2011-03-06T16:19Z,Shit... Why I can't see comments?
,Farkeman,2011-03-06T16:30Z,"@Astonvista
no

i would suggest not to waste your time in search of crack before 8th of march :)"
,Grimfate,2011-03-06T16:33Z,Lol True fact that the piratebay is good advertising for the gaming community. I wasnt going to buy this game until I downloaded it... got excited waiting for the crack i just went ahead and bought it for the ps3. Still want to have it on computer though for laptop
,Aledd,2011-03-06T17:19Z,lol im gona be lazy and just use my xbox controller on the PC... 
,Farkeman,2011-03-06T18:33Z,"You bought it for ps3 ? wow dude , you are crazy to play it on a console ...
i have da2 preordered but it arrives 3 day later in europe , so il just play pirate version till then ^^"
,Ravaner,2011-03-06T19:15Z,Aledd im not sure this game has native xinput support the demo didnt support the 360 controller
,lucid657,2011-03-06T19:33Z,"if you guys want  cheap key, get it from intkeys, i got mine for $28, and it just arrived today!"
,Farkeman,2011-03-06T20:21Z,"Intkeys have a pretty bad rep on internets , wouldnt recommend doing business with them ...

g2play.net or plati.ru is the place to go for cheap cd keys ,da2 is only 15$ there ... but i prefer to have box version of such an awesome game :)"
,cmoyano,2011-03-06T22:23Z,"@Aledd

,deathtrooper30,2011-03-06T23:08Z,"@cmoyano 

STFU you fucking idiot!"
,lucid657,2011-03-06T23:15Z,"Ive bougt from intkeys before, and intkeys and cdkeysexpress are the best imo. But that's just me."
,cmoyano,2011-03-07T03:15Z,"@ deathtrooper30

,xaxax,2011-03-07T05:56Z,consoles are for noobs/idiots
,Topska,2011-03-07T07:07Z,"Wow, a childish internet converstation.
Never seen one of those before. -_-"
,theswordbuggy,2011-03-07T11:34Z,@Topska lol i agree and half of them can't even spell what a bunch of idiots and stop asking for the crack either wait or find a way to crack yourself which very hard if you are a noob so stop fucking bithing and wait. :P
,puppymang,2011-03-07T12:44Z,"Anyone who plays Dragon Age 2 with a console controller is just silly in my opinion. It's like playing an MMO with a controller, you're really limiting yourself by doing so.
I think you'd get a better experience by using the mouse and keyboard for this game.
also LOLCONSOLEPEASANTS."
,energitic,2011-03-07T13:05Z,any one can tell me why the .mdx file work
,energitic,2011-03-07T13:06Z,sorry how does the .mdx file work
,BlackMoth,2011-03-07T13:31Z,"its basically a different format of DVD image.
like iso.

download 7-zip and extract it or use magic iso to open"
,z5k,2011-03-07T13:37Z,"@cmoyano

Lol well said mate, next time you hurl a hollow insult, try typing in proper english so people can actually understand if you're trying to be offensive.
"
,ThomasDollar,2011-03-07T13:45Z,just mount it with daemon tools... u may need a newer version
,Ravaner,2011-03-07T15:23Z,"Some people like mustard some dont some like controllers some don't we may be pc gamers but that gives us no right to judge, plus if you really need to place yourself on a pedistal because you use a keyboard that says more to damn you than redeem"
,deathtrooper30,2011-03-07T15:57Z,I don't like onions or bastard kids(which make up 90% of this place of course)!
,ninjanutta,2011-03-07T16:41Z,"bunch of nobs,whats wrong with a controller,i got all consoles and a gaming rig that probrably destroys yours,who you calling a peasant,wanker,i like a controller too with 46 inch 3dtv.dickheads have no clue,keyboard and mouse has its place for rts etc but to cunt people off for using a controller????cunts,child cunts at that.lol"
,janxp,2011-03-07T17:21Z,"@cmoyano

Get your thumb out of your a** and GTFO. Cuz ppl here don't realy care what punks like you think."
,Yamucha87,2011-03-07T17:29Z,"I really wanted to support Bioware with this game, and this would be one of the few games that I actually wanted to buy ( costs 60 euros on my salary of 250 euros, and still I wanted to buy it). But, seeing that they are being dicks with this encryption, I not only will not buy Dragon Age 2, I won't buy any other game they release. I will just play cracked versions. "
,cptlegion,2011-03-07T19:37Z,I decrypted exe. Now i just need a damn crack :/
[T],Knaster,2011-03-07T19:58Z,holloow then u are a traitor
,Achilles295,2011-03-07T21:40Z,"@Yamucha87

You are absolutely right. How dare they protect a software on which they worked for the better part of the last 2, maybe 3 years. The nerve of these pricks! 

These people gave a ridiculous amount of time and effort to make a product you will probably use for months to come, you will also probably vote for it when the VGA's come, but you will not spend 60 euros on it because.... they tried to protect it. Pure crap. 

And that's not actually an anti-piracy measure. Even people with legit copies can't play the game right now because the date-check server won't allow it.

If you want to keep doing what you're doing you're free to cook up whatever BS helps you sleep at night, but don't try to use it as a sensible justification."
,lucid657,2011-03-07T21:45Z,"sweet, anybody that preordered it can use the decrypted exe from asia to unlock the game, im playin right now ;-)"
,Wintermist,2011-03-07T23:48Z,Any link to that de-crypted exe? I pre-ordered.
,lucid657,2011-03-08T00:24Z,"Decrypted EXE here, I downloaded this one

http://www.mirrorcreator.com/files/1WN6MADJ/DragonAge2_0.exe_links"
,deathtrooper30,2011-03-08T01:29Z,The EXE works! Thanks
,delboy1972,2011-03-08T08:19Z,"What do you input for the registration code, when it asks for it?"
,Wintermist,2011-03-08T09:00Z,"Thanks for the EXE, now I can play my pre-order ahead of time hehe."
,SLVBros01,2011-03-08T16:34Z,"Man, I love taking things without having to pay for them

who's with me there"
,Perhelion,2011-03-08T16:36Z,"How has anyone gotten past the online activation? Does the crack do that? If so, it's not working for me.

Anyone want to give details on how they installed it if the game is working for them? "
,Ultrakonkret,2011-03-09T02:26Z,"@energitic
Just rename the file to: Dragon Age 2.mdx
then u can handle it with daemon tools or other progs as an image"
,Perhelion,2011-03-09T07:10Z,Just FYI: Having the settings on DirectX 11 can cause the game to crash before it even loaded. Putting the setting on DirectX 9 has fixed the issue.
,zulu1310,2011-03-10T01:37Z,"i downloaded this and it downloaded as a COM) and yes the parentheses are supposed to be there, i tried renaming it but it still won't open, is there anything i can do or will i have to Re download?"
,wrathbreaker,2011-03-11T05:16Z,need more seeders
,lShadowl,2011-03-29T01:21Z,"Can someone kindly make a short manual to get this working?

THX alot!"
,relic626,2011-07-16T10:38Z,supporting the makers..... of this game or any other game makers should be done don't just always download copies for free at least 1 out of 10 games buy 1 plz.. would suck if u worked at a grocery store and instead of paying for shit ppl just took it wen u aint lookin >.>i recently play amnesia the dark decent you guys should chk it out :)
