,tybomb,2011-03-20T09:22Z,"   This episode sucked!!!  They need to hire some new writers and get this train back on the track.
   There was one funny joke at the end with the ""generation awsome"" bit.  The whole rest of the episode was about as entertaining as a diaper commercial.
   It's like the hired a bunch of soccer moms who think they're funny but aren't to guest write on short notice."
