- Black.Swan.2010.Blu-ray.RE.x264.720p.DTS.MySilu
- Black.Swan.2010.Blu-ray.RE.x264.1080p.DTS.MySilu
- Black.Swan.2010.BluRay.720p.DTS.x264-CHD
- Black.Swan.2010.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD

When I watched the 720p screener of this, I didn't realize how much grain there is in this film. It's quite insane, actually, not just luma noise but lots of chroma noise, too. So much, in fact, that both of the MySilu versions are really way under the required bitrate. They look smudged and full of ugly artifacts. The 720p almost looks like a DVD with the 1080p at times looking like a bad 720p rip.

The CHD ones are (obviously, with their immense filesizes) much nicer to look at. Very little artifacts, and the noise is sharp and noisy rather than blurry.

Now the question is whether there's so much noise there that you actually gain enough from a 1080p version to justify its large filesize. It's close to not being so, actually. The grain is just so prominent, that to some extent, what you're actually gaining with the higher resolution isn't so much picture detail as it's prettier noise!

Me, I like noise, so I've gone with the 1080p CHD release. But if you want high detail without blur yet not spend the extra gigs required for that massive 14-gigger, and you're considering the MySilu 1080p one just because it's 1080p, my advice to you is: Don't. Get the CHD 720p instead. It's more detailed than the 1080p MySilu, because that one is just getting terrible smudging effects from the codec not having enough bits to produce much more than blur.

Actually, I'd say the 14GB CHD is pretty much around the sweet spot for 1080p. Much less and quality would start to suffer.      "
