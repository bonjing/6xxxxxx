File size went high :( Hope you all adjust.
This movie carries variable aspect ratio and excellent graphics, gave more bitrate to viewing pleasure, 
thanks for waiting."
[T],pmp_2010,2011-03-05T17:36Z,"Awesome!!!
Any chance you can upload 'Inside Job'? The copies currently floating are 700 megs+"

,banukaknight,2011-03-06T02:13Z,always worth the wait! tnx boss!
,stingy.scrooge,2011-03-06T07:20Z,"Great quality as always!! Ticten now is a trusted brand name :D

Could you do Dan in real life,the number 23,Three Kings?"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-06T12:25Z,"Inside Job, The Number 23, & Three Kings are accepted, 
Thanks for waiting friends, ans sure for the comments :)"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-06T12:29Z,"Now I'm not caring about how many hits I may get, I'll try to do maximum requests,

Avatar Extended is messing...
It's enriched with stunning graphics and I'm unable to get it under 500MB, it'll be a waste to do so, more bitrate is required to keep the quality, so the size might increase, I need more time for that, 
hope you can wait, I know it's been a while, kindly excuse me :(
Troy is fine, also The Sixth Sense & Mr. Nobody."
,banukaknight,2011-03-06T13:01Z,"man this is just tremendious quality !
tnx man!"
,stingy.scrooge,2011-03-06T16:07Z,"@ticten

I dont think you have to worry about hits...people will download your torrents irrespective of what movie you upload cause of the size and quality.

So,now your changing your market approach from production oriented  to customer satisfaction,eh? :)

Okay...so I am going to be greedy and ask you for a few more movies - ""The Green Mile"" and  ""In bruges"". "
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-06T18:02Z,"The Green Mile is accepted..
Change of field is always good :)"
,supcena,2011-03-06T19:09Z,hey buddy ....when can we expect bad boys 2 ?? 
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-06T22:14Z,"Bad Boys II is lengthy and has super speedy video, so I need more time to make it fine, I need to use maximum settings to get it under 420MB, been trying to find a new setting to do my future torrents with 480p video, without adding much size.
I'll make it soon.. :) 
(I've many more moves in Hard disk, but internet connection is limited :( Unable to upload more)
I've 6 hours of free usage daily, download, upload everything has to be done in this small interval."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-06T22:17Z,"I'm not giving excuses, no one needs it. Kindly adjust. Thanks."
,supcena,2011-03-07T15:48Z,"no problem mate ...appreciate your hard work ....take your time ....will wait until then
