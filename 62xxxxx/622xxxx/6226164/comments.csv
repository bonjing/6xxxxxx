,makkawi,2011-03-07T21:23Z,well they r both great uploaders.-ispiron- due to limited uplaods only uploads ASOT everyweek. Djlellone uploads almost all shows and is always the first to upload them. so you can just use cue splitter and download cues from cuenation. CHEERS for both DJlellone and -inspiron-.
[V],IndexTrance,2011-03-07T21:23Z,"Just have to comment this.. Inspiron don't split shows but download a cue and sourcefile from Cuenation..
And when he does retail CD's it's just someone else release-groups cue.. That's how much he rocks man.."
,makkawi,2011-03-08T08:56Z,lol Segelboy. Wlecome Back man trance community missed u. didn't now about -inspiron- downloading from cuenation. still he takes the initiative and upload it for us. and he still is the backup for splitted ASOT when u r gone. i personaly download ur uploads and when ur gone i download from djlellone and slpit them myself but i still make sure to rate all of u for ur efforts. so keep up the good work.
