,Phatfish,2011-03-09T00:20Z,"A/V -  Great

M - Heartwarming even for someone brick-hearted like myself, but unfortunately dull and lacked depth as a documentary. I was pretty bored.

Thanks 4 the up!"
,Dizzious,2011-05-02T01:09Z,...and why exactly did you feel the need to insert hundreds of newlines into the description of this torrent? There is absolutely no reason for that. Seriously. I should not have to scroll down for an hour just to get to the comments.
,Jew4Nazi,2011-05-04T02:08Z,@dizzious be grateful for the movie you idiot. and quit complaining or else u freak of nature
,eallik,2011-06-18T19:14Z,Agreed with Dizzious â sick thing to add those line breaks.
,psichoate,2011-07-15T01:25Z,"personally, i am a big fan of newlines. I am expecting a lot from this movie so it kind of built up the suspense. Plus I felt like I actually did some work for it."
,Drop-22,2011-08-20T18:25Z,"OMG! It took me a 8 days to scroll down to the comments...I incured serious injury to the distal phalange of right index finger....not to mention dehydration, exhaustion, emotional strain on my relationships...I won't even mention the unmentionable fact that this was a film and not a poem...Oh woe is me, the deception...Oh woe! Is me?!"
,stijr,2011-12-03T10:01Z,thanks scenebalance@@@@

,candorist,2011-12-19T22:02Z,Im not an expert but this torrent is complete bullshit. Just a map full of maps full of maps full of maps. Where is the MOVIE!?!?!?
,shavarma1,2012-01-14T09:40Z,Thanks a lot ! Great Stuff !!
,lazy_journalist,2012-04-28T13:22Z,"a/9 v/9
works fine
many thanks for the upload

amazing, one of the most intresting doco's ever"
,gmeddy,2012-05-01T16:55Z,I can't believe anyone would complain about having to move an index finger twice on their scroll wheel to get down to the comments. Probably annoyed because that finger was just busy up the right nostril... add a few hundred more lines next time scenebalance! good work.
