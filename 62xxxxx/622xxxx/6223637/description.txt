If you don't have anything on your machine to handle wavpack files then go to http://www.wavpack.com/downloads.html and get a plugin. Alternatively you can download foobar2000 which can handle wavpack too. And if you really don't like wavpack you can just convert it to whatever format you like once you've downloaded it.

My upload is slow (30kBps) but I will seed until the torrent is healthy.

Thanks to the original uploader, "MothmanEX" at http://www.expresshare.com/video-games-ost/21402-final-fantasy-vii-ost-lossless.html
