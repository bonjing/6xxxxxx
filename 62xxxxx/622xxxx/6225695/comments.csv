PLOT (spoilers!): Things couldn't be any better for happily married couple Jung In (Choi Jin Sil) and Hwan Yoo (Park Shin Yang). But one day, Hwan Yoo discovers that he is dying of leukemia [or is it a tumor?]. Heartbroken at the prospect of leaving Jung In behind, he proceeds to write love letters aimed at making his wife's emotional transition more bearable. Soon, Hwan Yoo dies and Jung In is left hanging, wondering whether she can go on without her true love. Just then, a letter arrives from Hwan Yoo, followed by even more letters. Slowly but gradually, Jung In begins to realize why she must carry on living.
