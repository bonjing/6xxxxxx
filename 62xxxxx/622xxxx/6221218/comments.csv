I think it is beyond time someone came up with a database program that will store and catalog all these apps so that collectors can keep the newest versions or track versions of apps.  And if everyone used it, they could actually download these packs and check in whatever is in them keeping everything tidy instead of having folders and folders of duplicate crap all the time.

Also, I hope if someone does this, it is available to Linux as well as Windows and Mac users."

Secondly, you are talking about a database with these kind of apps? What about the app Applanet."
