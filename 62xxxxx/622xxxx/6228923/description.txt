Reine Geschmacksache (Fashion Victims) 2007 (GERMANY)

At 52, traveling salesman Wolfgang Zenker (Edgar Selge) is in old school territory: he peddles the company's classic clothing line to boutiques that cater to women over 35. 

When Wolfi loses his drivers license in his brand-new Mercedes but can't afford to lose the season's sales because his frustrated wife (Franziska Walser) desperately wants a new bathroom, their son's vacation plans take a back seat as Karsten (Florian BartholomÃ¤i) is forced to making sales rounds with his father instead of celebrating his high school graduation in Spain. 

Also making the rounds in small town southern Germany is successful and attractive sales rival Steven BrookmÃ¼ller (Roman Knizka), 33. As the men's paths cross, long-hidden secrets are revealed and things come to a hilarious head.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I've noticed that in several PLAYERS the Movie file .MKV behaves strangely when you CUE / QUEUE. 
The subtitles get confused... I advice to watch the movie from the beginning till the end only using the PAUSE button if needed.
Don't move the movie playing bar back or forward, then the subtitles will show accurately.
Enjoy the movie...

and

don't forget :

We live in a very homophobic world full of prejudice and violence against LGBT community. 
Letâ€™s change the world, reeducate the world in a good spirit! 
Letâ€™s explain directly and indirectly to people how important is to respect and treat the LGBT community just as everyone else. 
Spread the word! Share the movie with your straight and gay friends. A picture says a 1000 words. A Movie â€“ says a Million words.
