Anyone who has ever enjoyed music and poetry created in the singer-songwriter model, be it Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, John Lennon, Randy Newman or any of the other greats too innumerable to mention would do well to check out the recent release from Nigel Stonier entitled `Notes from Overground'. In this recording Stonier steps firmly out from the shadows of the back-up man and takes centre stage and microphone with assurance, dexterity and passion. 

Singing of the dark times in which we find ourselves (`Season of Thunder'), 
his own personal journey (`In the Time of My Running'), personal relationships (the lovely `Set You Free' and the brutally honest `Transient Friend' and `Nearly Man') and the darker sides of the music business (`Whole Lotta Nothin' Going On'), Nigel Stonier pulls no punches while never losing his sense of humour and irony. 
Musically it is a feast of rhythms and styles, ever driven by his masterful 
musicianship and years of experience. His lyrics are focused, mature and 
realistic. He is able to laugh at himself as well as his fellow humans but 
remains ultimately hopeful, never losing his belief in the basic goodness that 
always underlies mankind's crass stupidity and selfishness. `Notes from 
Overground' is a richly satisfying and rewarding experience.
