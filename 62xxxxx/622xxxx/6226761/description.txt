Review
Best Book of Its Kind!
This book by Wilfred Funk was the most important tool in helping to build, not only my vocabulary, but my love for words, and a richer understanding of our language, including where words come from, how they evolve, and the proper words to use in all types of situations.
The way Funk structured this book doesn't just teach you words, but with each word you learn, he helps you unlock the meanings of several other words almost simultaneously. This enhances your language, vocabulary, and reading development exponentially. It also aids in your fluency and ease of expression. 

I don't know one person, professional or otherwise, who couldn't benefit from reading this book, which is more like a workbook.
Within less than a couple of months you will be reading, conversing, and understanding on a level you never thought possible. This book should be standard in every school, from upper elementary to college.........
