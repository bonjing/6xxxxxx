trully never seen that before, ill wait till someone downloads it and coment..."
,brfsa,2011-03-06T11:32Z,"yes, m4v is new.
it played perfectly on VLC, Mplayer and QuickTime.
it seems its was encoded with H264 and HandBrake for Mac OSX.

the quality is really good compared to 700MB avi movies.

Sound 10/10
Video 9/10"
