Living with the Tribes
Complete Series 1 - 3
Kombai, Mek and Machigenga

Series 1: Kombai

 

Extreme travelers Mark Anstice and Olly Steeds embark on a unique expedition into one of the most remote rainforests on Earth. Their mission to track down and live with the remarkable Kombai tribe, a people whose existence was discovered only 25 years ago and whose ways have changed little since the Stone Age. From beginning to end, experience the highs and lows of this intrepid pair's fascinating quest to survive the rigors of rainforest life.
The Kombai Tribe had lived in the same primitive fashion for centuries when Steeds and Anstice went to live with them, and the culture clash between the tribe and the travelers produces some remarkable moments over the course of their three-month stay.

Searching through treacherous jungles, Mark Anstice and Olly Steeds track down the most mysterious tribe in the Peruvian Amazon - the Machigenga. After Mark and Olly persuade the locals to let them stay, these intrepid travelers face unbelievable challenges to gain acceptance from the tribe - eating live cicada and singed monkey hair, competing in a dance-off with the chief and endangering their lives by consuming the strongest hallucinogenic drug known to man. With a desperate search for a chief's missing son, hunting horrors, taboo-breaking trouble and so much more, this is Mark and Olly's wildest season yet!
