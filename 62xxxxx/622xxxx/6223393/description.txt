Two simultaneous dinner parties unfold - one for a group of female friends, the other for their male counter parts. At each dinner table, the conversations quickly deleve into the characters recent sexual escapades: there's the adventurous couple tries "swinging", the middle-aged woman who notices a spark of intrest from her daughter's boyfriend, and the young newlywed who thinks sex simply isn't for her. With comic subtlety, the film capyures the many contrasting views - men's women's, young and old, conservative and liberal - about what it means to be a good lover.
