[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T16:08Z,"you have to copy the url and then open a new window and then paste it.

on other torrent sites that allow bbcode the images work fine.  I use imageshack because they are simple to upload to.  I'll have to prefix the images with an anonymous service to allow clicking from them on tpb.

this is only a new thing that imageshack has started to implement.  some reason they do not like us."

just right click and open in new tab, it works for me"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-07T00:15Z,"that seems to work in google chrome, but not firefox.  firefox must pass the HTTP referrer when you do this while chrome isn't.

if you connect to piratebay via HTTPS then the links work just by clicking them."

,gocry_emokid,2011-05-26T10:13Z,"I have loved every HolyRoses download I've watched. I'm grateful to you for uploading this, as we are moving this weekend and watching this on my PSP will keep my son busy and happy while the TV is packed/in transit/waiting to be hooked up.

Thank you for making a point to upload all the best and most popular movies-- and for making a point to use the PiZ format. I can't even tell you how often I turn to you for fun, entertaining movies with perfect sound and visual that will play flawlessly on my old-school PSP. 

However, I should stop gushing, since I'm starting to sound like an advert. Thanks for uploading this; I'm looking forward to how quiet and pleased my kid will be this weekend because of it. ^_^"
