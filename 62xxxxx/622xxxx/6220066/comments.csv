480p equals 480 pixels in height (usually 720 in width). this one is 304px in height which means its not 480p.
Can someone say if this is a BRRip, or anything about the quality?
Downloading anyway."

No the bluray hasn't been released yet (to the public) but scene groups usually acquire their releases somewhere between the manufacturers and the retailers, so they are usually up in torrent form before the public can purchase them..

It mentions clearly in the information about the source.  SOURCE......: 1080p BluRay CHD    

And as far as the quality. a 480p rip will look better than a brrip or bdrip, but will still be inferior to a 720p rip (it's not very hard to figure out ya mong). "
,TheSourMango,2011-03-05T20:53Z,"This is not a BRRip judging from the grain and low contrast.
If the source is 1080p, the ripper has used some kind of add grain effect, since the movie certainly didn't have the artistic grain effect during the preview screening in the movie theatre.
The quality is definitly watchable, but please be advised it's not a BRRip nor 480p. This movie is below Standard Definition."
