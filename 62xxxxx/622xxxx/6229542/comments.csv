 i know you r trying to get some kind of revenge by clicking minus on every upload of 20-40 for reasons as stupid as shit but please listen to this...
you come here 10-20 times a day to check the mans uploads, take them , leech off them and click a minus everytime nothing is going on in ur real life. what kind of person does that make you... r there any words to desribe that.. new abuses have to be created in the language for egoistic lifeless selfish jerks like you..
I can only imagine how people like u r in real life..

No, it has iMDb 3.8. I made this only for people who cannot afford bigger download (there is plenty of torrents of this movie)."""

WHO assume that so called ""black numbers"" are even higher. Approx. one third is so called ""highly functional"", what means that they appear as normal in every-day's life.
