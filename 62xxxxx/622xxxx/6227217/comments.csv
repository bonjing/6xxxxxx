,TKOG11,2011-03-08T05:49Z,is this the unrated version?
,iPod87,2011-03-08T06:24Z,"Yes I think so, I don't see any scenes that are censored in any way. "
,kingofny,2011-03-08T07:39Z,dude this is just cruel i literally just dloaded this and converted it myself today
,iPod87,2011-03-08T08:23Z,"Sorry kingofny I've had it for about 2 weeks now I just thought it was time to share. Was yours a BR Rip as well?

I've had to resort to staying away from the most recent releases because HR is going to release a more sought after copy anyway."
[V],RR-NE,2011-03-08T09:45Z,What converted do you use?
,iPod87,2011-03-08T10:19Z,"If your referring to myself RAYMONDryche than its listed in the description Handbrake Nightly Build svn 3786. I should probably check to see if there's an update soon too.

But I think you may be asking kingofny in which case I'm not sure."
,kingofny,2011-03-08T14:45Z,i also use handbrake and @ipod87 while ur right that HR will do a better quality UL than u is still not so bad if you look youll see that 3x0 did all the latest releases too but he usually did them b4 HR and he got tons of dloads too
,gwapsako,2011-03-08T16:18Z,"thanks for this ipod87! 

i hope u can keep seeding ur uploads from now on :)"
,iPod87,2011-03-08T21:16Z,"@gwapsako:

I've learned my lesson and am only uploading 1 or 2 torrents at once which I can begin seeding immediately instead of uploading 10 torrents at once which I did initially that took me ages to finish seeding."
[V],RR-NE,2011-03-09T00:53Z,"i was referring to you ipod87, i achieved my VIP skull long ago, i had way more toreents than i do now ()deleted a whole lot"
,iPod87,2011-03-09T01:12Z,"@kingofny:
Thanks for the encouragement but I can hardly be compared to 3x0 who had already achieved trusted uploader status when he was uploading recent torrents before HR. Case in point the lack of seeds I have for my upload of The Next Three Days which HR has also uploaded. So I'll stick to uploading older movies I think.

@RAYMONDryche:
I never questioned how you got your VIP status. I have the utmost respect for all trusted and VIP uploaders for their contribution to the community. Without 3x0 Handbrake instructions I'd still be waiting in vain for HR and others to upload my movie requests rather than be uploading handheld movies myself.  "
[V],RR-NE,2011-03-09T02:02Z,"i know, i was just telling you, (im bored"
,makoy32000,2011-03-18T03:18Z,"May I request for Unknown by Liam Neeson and I Am Number Four? Please? :)
