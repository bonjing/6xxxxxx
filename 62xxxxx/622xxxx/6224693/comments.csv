,nickthenack9,2011-03-08T08:42Z,I didn't make the game so I can't help you
,nohuelebien,2011-03-08T14:18Z,white screen for me too
,sparrowhawk13,2011-03-08T20:03Z,"Yeah, you didn't make the game, but you made the TORRENT, so any insight as how you went about that would probably shed some light onto why it isn't working.  For example, did you just buy the game, install it, then drag it from your applications folder into a zip and upload it?  If so, it probably won't work for anyone else.  If it doesn't work, then it's a junk torrent, if it's a junk torrent, then it's TPB cancer and just wastes time and bandwidth."
