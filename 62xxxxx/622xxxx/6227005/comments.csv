,fluxocity,2011-03-15T01:11Z,"This is high quality video and audio but not 1080, are you people on crack?  Grainy in parts and some choppiness indicating transcoding errors.  Downloaded in 30 minutes though so thanks very much."
,Brandhole272,2011-03-26T02:00Z,"It it 1080. The original format had letterboxes when even it was being played in Blu-Ray player. So we removed the Letter boxes to make it 1920x800. So it essentially is original format without letterboxes, which hints the name 1080 which was originally on the disc. "
