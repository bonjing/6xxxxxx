Canadian indie rock/shoegaze ensemble Braids make noisy, somewhat experimental pop that owes a heavy debt to various shoegaze bands of the 90s. Featuring the talents of keyboardist Raphaelle Standell-Preston, guitarist Katie Lee, guitarist Taylor Smith, and drummer Austin Tufts, Braids originally started out as the Calgary-based band the Neighborhood Council. The four-piece released an EP before relocating to Montreal and changing its name. Braids released their debut full-length album, Native Speaker, in early 2011.
