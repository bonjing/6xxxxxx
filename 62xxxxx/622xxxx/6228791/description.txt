JOHNNY COPELAND  THE CRAZY CAJUN RECORDINGS
Original Release: 1998
Audio CD February 18, 1999 
Label: Edsel Records UK


Considering the amount of time he spent steadily rolling from gig to gig, Johnny "Clyde" Copeland's rise to prominence in the blues world in the early '90s wasn't all that surprising. A contract with the PolyGram/Verve label put his '90s recordings into the hands of thousands of blues lovers around the world. It's not that Copeland's talent changed all that much since he recorded for Rounder Records in the '80s; it's just that major companies began to see the potential of great, hardworking blues musicians like Copeland. Unfortunately, Copeland was forced to slow down in 1995-1996 by heart-related complications, yet he continued to perform shows until his death in July of 1997.
