The Olsen gang in Jutland. Ones again Egon Olsen has a plan when he gets out
of Vridslose State Prison. He has found out that the Germans left a large sum
of money (in American dollars and gold bars) in one of their commando bunkers,
when they were defeated in 1945; the only problem it's in Jutland. Egon,
Benny and Kjeld "appropriate" a car and drives to Jutland along with Kjelds
wife and child Yvonne and Borge. They look forward to fooling the the people
in Jutland, but of course, things don't go quite as planed. It ends with Benny
, Kjeld, Borge and Yvonne sitting in the train back to Copenhagen, were they
are overtaken by Egon in his car on the road next to the track. This is the
last time the Olsen gang goes to Jutland.
