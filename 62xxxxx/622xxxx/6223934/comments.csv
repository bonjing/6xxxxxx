,intrinsic75,2011-06-11T10:49Z,"I'm fairly new at this and have only downloaded about 30 movies, but this is BY FAR the best one I've ever downloaded. ALL the others have some gliches, or poor sound, or pixellation, or something. But, this was perfect. And only 400mb.  You're my new hero Pluto.  You definitely desereve your skull."
,intrinsic75,2011-06-11T10:50Z,"And, it didn't take long to download either, not sure what that other person was complaining about.  ???"
