[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-08T01:41Z,few days probably.
,sebitas71,2011-03-08T04:37Z,"Hey thank you very much for your releases! i jusst have a small questions i have all your movies in itunes but i cant see them, they are just a bunch of frames and the movie goes really slow! what can that be? ty very much!"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-08T05:11Z,do not know.  try play with vlc.
,themorningstar69,2011-03-09T06:39Z,"Thank you so much Holyroses, I have wanted to create an account for a long time just to thank you, I always look forward to all of your work.  I have one question, how do you get all of your movies to show up marked HD in iTunes, I have not figured out a way to do that.  And Sebitas71, I do all of HR's stuff through iTunes and on both Apple TV's and have never had ANY kind of issue.  Bummer though"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T15:28Z,its a metadata atom.  hdvd or something.
,loanhighknight,2011-03-10T02:09Z,"First of all, HolyRoses thank you SOOO much for another excellent round of uploads. You rock.

Second, to answer themorningstar, there are a whole range of metadata fields that mp4s can hold that iTunes doesn't give you the option to touch. But there is a program out there called MetaX that I at least use for editing metadata for my mp4s. Its host goes in and out of functionality so it can be tricky to track down, but the program is rock solid and it works great. It even has chapter support if you know the start and stop times of each chapter. And that little 'HD' icon is a metadata field, so you can use MetaX to make it appear."
,Freebasedog,2011-03-10T07:48Z,thanks I wish I had waited for you instead of the screener with the brutal audio sync that was out a while back
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-10T15:39Z,dont bother with anything other than real dvd rip or bluray rips.  there are too many movies to watch crummy copies.  just wait for movies.  there is always something to watch.  to reason to spoil a movie you really want to see by watching something unbearable.
,jcburnunit,2011-03-16T07:28Z,great movies holy roses!  Been DL movies for a long time but just getting into DL for my appleTV and Ive been having a harder than expected time finding good quality movies that work with my ATV.  Your the first Ive found that work seemlessly!!
,themorningstar69,2011-03-16T16:57Z,"That's what made me a big fan of HR, I downloaded one of his torrents and realized that it was already set up and ready to go for my apple tv, just drop in iTunes and you are ready to go.
Loanhighknight, I was using MetaX, but I couldn't figure out how to add the HD tag with it, I liked the program though.  In my search for that functionality I came across Subler, it is a plain program but it adds every tag you can think of for iTunes.  It also doesn't completely rewrite your file like MetaX, it just adds the information when you save like it does when you edit in iTunes."
,0sw4ld,2011-03-18T04:37Z,"holyroses thank you so much for the quality uploads, every movie ive downloaded has worked flawlessly on my atv. i am a HUGE FAN!"
