,Zero236,2011-03-09T11:27Z,"Thanks Hiest, loadedin under 15 mins, gonna watch it this weekend. Did a quick scan, noticed a little wobble on the opening credits leads me to say a CAM rip, when I got to the movie the video was clear, audio also seemed clear. IMO (for a quick scan) it' gotta be 1 of the better cam rips!!

,jjf3,2011-03-14T04:48Z,"This movie is very watchable the whole way through even in the darker parts its fine.

A 8
V 8

Its not a DVD by any means but close enough. "
,killyourself,2011-03-27T09:30Z,"A: 7

@hiest Thanks again!"
