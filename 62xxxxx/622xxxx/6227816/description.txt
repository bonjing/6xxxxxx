There is always a day, once a year, dedicated to someone who is close to our heart and has seen us grow and develop. They pick us up when we have been defeated by obstacles, they walk us through the toughest times, and they cheer for our successes. From the moment we are born, our mothers shelter us from danger, just like how mother kangaroos hold their babies close to them in their pouches as they move around.

We are always so busy in our daily lives that sometimes we neglect to tell our mothers that we love them. In fact, many of us are also guilty of snapping at them when we are not in the best mood. However, they have never taken it to heart.
