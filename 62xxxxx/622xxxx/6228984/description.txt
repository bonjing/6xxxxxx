InfoGraffiti Episode One.



This DVD is the work of one months collaboration by the /r/infograffiti community on reddit. We're spreading a message that mainstream media outlets choose to ignore. If you want to take part in the project, burn this DVD as many times as you can, label it with the DVD cover, then leave it in the city in interesting places for people to find. Be creative and document your work for the /r/infograffiti community.



We're making the worlds biggest printing press and we want you to take part. 

We already exist on every continent of the planet, but we want to grow further. Help us grow by seeding this torrent, telling your friends about the project, and most importantly, by burning and distributing the disk. Episode two launches February 10th.

HOW TO BURN



You're going to have to experiment with what works best. High quality disks are best, as cheaper ones

seem to crap out and make DVD players spin aimlessly. If you do use cheap disks, burn at 1x or 2x.



Use NERO if you can get your hands on it. If not there's imgburn - an open source image burner.
