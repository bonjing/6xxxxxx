[V],HobbitGamez,2011-03-07T03:03Z,"It is worth noting that while this game contains the entire trilogy, I have only successfully played Metroid Prime 1 & 2. Here is how I did it with USB Loader GX:

1. Load USB Loader GX from the Wii Menu or The Homebrew Channel.
2. Load Metroid Prime Trilogy with your default settings.
3. After you reach the main menu of the game, create a save file with your Mii.
4. Attempt to load either Metroid Prime 1 or 2 and select your desired difficulty.
5. When the game loads, you will be taken back to the Wii System Menu.
6. Go back to USB Loader GX, back to Metroid Prime Trilogy, and select ""settings"" instead of playing the game.
7. Scroll down to ""Alternate DOL"" and click it once.
8. Go to the next option ""Select DOL Offset"" and click it.
9. You will be given three options for an alternate DOL (one for each game), so select the one you want and save the settings.
10. When you load the game, the menu process will be skipped and you will be taken directly into the game you chose.
11. You must select the Alternate DOL for the game you desire to play every time you wish to switch games.
12. The game will be played throughout with the difficulty you first selected in the menu before using an alternate DOL, and you can only maintain one save file per game.
13. Like I mentioned previously, I have never successfully played Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, although this game is available apart from the trilogy.

If anyone has anything to add to this, or corrections to what has been written here, feel free to comment."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-03-07T07:07Z,"It is also worth noting that this Wii title is dual-layer, thus if burning it to disc be sure to use a dual-layer disc or it will not finish properly. It is unlikely you will have success playing Metroid Prime 3: Corruption from the trilogy off of a disc, but if anyone's experience contradicts this be sure to comment and let others know."
,black_shadow_1981,2011-03-08T12:58Z,thanks wiiGM ive been wanting to play the first 2 games for along long time
,bengaard,2011-03-09T20:37Z,"Thanks a lot, wiiGM. I appreciate your work!"
,crispykiller96,2011-04-08T05:37Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD DOES NOT WORK I CONVERTED THIS GAY WBFS FILE TO ISO AS WBFS MANAGER 2.5 WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT EVERYTHING WORKED FINE UNTILL I START THE GAME AND GET THE DREDED BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH CHANGED IOS MESSED AROUND NO UCK DONT DOWNLOAD THIS GUY SHOULD UPLOAD ISO FILES NOT GAY CURRUPT WBFS FILES 
,Senzeki,2011-04-26T03:42Z,"@crispykiller96

There is nothing wrong with the torrent. Metroid Prime Trilogy is a finicky game and requires special settings to get to work properly. Yelling in caps in the comments section isn't going to fix your problem.

Go find a solution for it yourself, because they are out there. This exact .wbfs wiiGM has uploaded is working great on my console.

There is nothing corrupt about this, or any other wbfs file, and they can be transfered back into ISO anyways."
,BlueBomb,2011-08-20T05:25Z,"Seriously, this format SUCKS. Can't load it with USB Loader updated, can't load it with wbfs manager... For God's sake why change something that was already working at it's best?! Why creat .wbfs if you can fucking make a .iso scrubbed and all?!"
,DyO152,2011-08-24T13:40Z,I  WANT  A  PC  VERSION ! ! ! ! !
,rogergamer,2011-09-04T10:19Z,seed!!!!
,rogergamer,2011-09-06T13:40Z,H1 checksum failed
,Laeter,2012-01-10T19:46Z,"@bluebomb This torrent was clearly labeled. Not so bright to come in here to complain about the format.

For some usbloader/softmod users, wbfs is perfect. Great compatibility across multiple apps & minimum file size. Easy to convert back to iso."
,bush420,2012-03-17T11:47Z,Thanks. Can u plz clear if 3rd part works or not??
,leba2,2012-04-30T03:56Z,ok so metroid prime 1 only works till before you get to the phazon mines. this game just stays in the elevator forever and never actually gets to the phazon mines. metroid prime 2 works perfectly fine. and metroid prime 3 never loads
,endahosor,2012-05-01T13:22Z,"There is a way to play Metroid Prime 3: Corruption

1.Install the d2x-cios, you can download it from:""http://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios/"". Notice that is a modified cios, so you take the risk of your own.

2.Update your loader to the lastest version.

3.If you have ever mod the option ""Alternate DOL"", set it to the default ""off"" in your loader.

4.Set the option ""IOS Reload block"" to ""on"" in your loader. 

5.you can play Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and also Metroid Prime 1 & 2 now. You can select the difficult level in the game and have the own save date of each trilogy.

6.Like I mentioned previously, the d2x-cios is a mod cios so you have to take the risk of your own.

And finally I wanna say ""love piratebay"" ""love HobbitGamez"""
,mikeysama,2012-06-23T05:47Z,"I'm having the same problems with 3 that everyone else has. While I could just get the stand-alone version of Corruption, my OCD won't allow me to basically have 2 copies of the same game eating up my USB thumb drive's space.

I'm going to download ryneg0d's torrent and see if it works any better. This may be a bad rip. This being a dual-layer game, if one of the layer's is bad it'd explain why Metroid Prime 1 and 2 work but not 3. Certain dual-layer PS2 games can have similar problems."
,mikeysama,2012-06-25T00:21Z,"THIS IS A BAD RIP. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. ONLY METROID PRIME 1 AND 2 WORK ON THIS RIP. 3 DOES NOT.

I downloaded ryneg0d's rip, and all three games and the MP2 multiplayer start on Configurable USB Loader, and launch fine from the game's main menu without any boot.dol dickery if you're homebrew apps and cIOS are up to date. ryneg0d's rip is here:

Sorry HobbitGamez."
