,Tatletz,2011-03-09T07:52Z,"Thanks for the upload {HMP}
Please advise if this keygen and serials will work with Nero-10.5.10500 which is the latest trial version from their website."
,{HMP},2011-03-10T01:34Z,"it should do m8. you can but try !!!

,Smileydawg,2011-03-10T09:56Z,hey hmp i did everything you said but when I use nero vision the patent activation comes an said that the serial pirated what should i do now.
,{HMP},2011-03-10T19:15Z,"to be honest m8, i dunno

i've always got this to work but for some reason there's a lot of people who can't get it working.

i thought you guys were pirates !!!!

i've uploaded this a number of times as people were complaining.

there's 135 seeders on this at 18:10 on 10/03/2011

nobody has complained as yet (except you lol)

if this still aint working, let me know guys as i don't wanna be uploading ""rubbish"" (dead software)

PLEASE GUYS LET ME KNOW IF THIS IS WORKING FOR YOU, IF IT'S NOT WORKING I CAN SIMPLY DELETE THE TORRENT !!!

,{HMP},2011-03-10T19:17Z,"@ smileydawg, try using the keygen to generate a new serial for the nero vision. there's a drop down list that lets you select which part of nero you need a new serial for. hope this helps ???"
,Smileydawg,2011-03-11T06:51Z,well i tried using iit but the same serial keeps coming back up but I download ur nero 9 an thats works perfectly nice job man and Thanks alot
,{HMP},2011-03-12T04:22Z,"@ smileydawg, the only thing i don't like about nero 9 is it seems to take all day to install and you allways seem to get a stop start effect when converting from AVI to DVD format,  not to mention it seems to take about 1 hour 30 mins lol.

i use WinAVI Video Converter for converting my files. takes approx 20 mins and allways good quality.

i'm using WinAVI Video converter 9 at the moment as my WinAVI Video converter 10, does everything it's supposed to do but for some reason, looses the sound.

Nero 10 is much ""much"" faster at installing, running apps and converting video files.

anyway my friend, glad something worked for you.

there's always a plan ""B"" lol !!!!!

L8trs my friend !!!"
,Tatletz,2011-03-15T08:22Z,"Just for the record => Activate all functions with the keygen and they will work properly(including Nero Vision), I tried them and all is OK.
Thank you {HMP}!
PS. Install it offline and block Nero from accessing Internet with your firewall"
,benz-ino,2011-03-18T19:06Z,hello i did everything you guys said but i just cant activate nero (vision) it says need patent what can i do and on the nero control says multimedia suite 10 expires 'never' and underneath again multimedia suite 10 demo?? i don't get it
,Dustypirate,2011-03-28T06:52Z,"@Smileydawg & @benz-ino

I had the same problem, and figured out how to fix it. And HMP you should probably list this. 

1. Open the Keygen provided with this torrent.

2. In the drop down select. ""Activar Patentes"" and copy that key.

3. Open Nero StartSmart and in the top left corner, a little under the nero logo, you should see a drop down and a page icon. Click it and select ""Set Serial"".

4. Add the serial you copied. Then restart the program.

Now vision should work for you, it does for me after doing that.

(Btw, I've been using piratebay for over 3 years now and I've never had an account, just made this to help you guys out.)"
,dlugi_kamil,2011-04-01T12:57Z,"Thanks HMP,  100% work. For aktivate patents use  keygen. "
,blue_bomber,2011-04-02T22:58Z,"Nice one HMP, works perfectly and nice one Dustypirate as it wouldn't have worked perfectly if I never read your comment!"
,NXiL2009,2011-04-06T03:50Z,"4 ri-tards like me, make sure you copy and paste ALL the serials in the notepad ""serials"".  

once i did this it worked great.
so, 
delete serial after install and then copy all the serials from notepad.  then reboot, open program and burnnnnnnnnnnnn "
,Parcero,2011-04-11T18:05Z,"Hello HMP

It seems that ""no one"" is capable to deliver new serial for NERO 10 (V.10.5.10300) or (V.10.2.12.100) Your version is the first on what came out end of 2009 and your KEYGEN works very well in this version only. But the (V.10.0.13100) have errors inside. For example, Nero Vision (V.10.0.13100) don't work very well to convert BLUERAY in DVD and i'am still waiting for five month, to have a new KEYGEN with new serial inside to make happen, than i can work with the version (V.10.2.12.100) or with the version (V.10.5.10300)

It seems, that AHEAD is controlling very much here serials :-(

No chance to make work the newers versions of NERO 10

Sincerely

Parcero"
,copperweed,2011-04-16T14:35Z,"Hmmm...{HPM}, hanging you would be too light on you. You deserve a 25-year sentence in Gulag, Siberia; hard labour, extreme cold, undernourishment and hoping that one-day you will be released. But that day never comes, because death sets in about the late teens. And you know it.

First, this program does not install, because the decent computers have NET Framework v 3.5 or 4 installed, and your program does not find v.3 and, for this reason, it stops installing.

Second, long minutes pass before the installation stops. During this time your program installs adware and other malicious codes that deliver web pages in every few minutes, disables MS Security software and disables access to the files on D drive. Your mates keep coming and going in my computer as they like, but it does not work for me. 

Third, the displayed commercial WebPages pay you handsomely for using my computer, my Internet time while you deny usage for me. This is theft.

You are not at all a Robin Hood, who steal from the rich and distributes the loot amongst the poor. You are a nasty cyber-criminal preying on the poor. Because only the poor seeks out pirated software.

There is no mistake, mate. I wiped, formatted my disks three times, reinstalled XP and security AND your NERO 10, and I always got the same result.

You greed is over-excessive; your moral standards are subhuman. You are a ruthless, rotten scoundrel."

,ptcruiser70663,2011-04-27T19:12Z,So glad you don't want to waste our time???? Why not tell us this crap is in Spanish?
,ptcruiser70663,2011-04-27T22:59Z,Bummer!
,ineedpB,2011-04-29T11:33Z,"superfast download thnx! :D

,jasonjames2011,2011-05-01T22:37Z,"Is this some sort of joke?!

ive dowloaded and deleted, and re-downloaded...

but the same problem comes as everybody else is mentioning also.  This serial does not work 
9X03-016C-MXEX-4536-T0L7-2W2T-AMPX-97TA

however its done, however u put it into the Nero, it does not work.  

If u wait all the time to download, then install, u will all see how much time uve wasted.  The same as me.

Useless....."
,freedomdwarf,2011-05-27T12:14Z,"@HMP: This simply doesn't work!!
It didn't behave like you explain in your README1ST!! text file.
The serials don't work.
I tried the KeyGen many times - every single one failed.
@DustyPirate: I followed your 'fix' and that didn't work either!! I still get the Patent Failed message and I can't create DVD's - the very thing I wanted Nero for!

I spent ALL DAY pissing about trying to get Nero to burn a DVD - it failed every time no matter what I tried.

Useless. Waste of time! "
,freedomdwarf,2011-05-27T12:40Z,"@HMP: This simply doesn't work!!
Installs fine but you can't do anything! 
I didn't get the problem with .net framework nor did it come up and say it wasn't registered.
But, Patent failure message every time.
If I block internet access it tells me it needs it to verify the patent serial.
Tried many different serials from the KeyGen (more than 20!) - none of them worked.

@Dustypirate: Tried your 'fix' - that didn't work either!

I spent ALL DAY pissing about with this and I just couldn't get it to work no matter what I tried (I'm not a newbie either - I'm a PC techie and have been for many many years!!)

I am just wondering if this serial (and those in the keygen) are for a specific region/area and hence why most of us can't get this to work."
,freedomdwarf,2011-05-27T13:55Z,Sorry guys.... I'm not gonna seed something I can't get to work.
,hyddenblue,2011-05-30T17:55Z,"you guys are just stupid.....it seems i'm the only one that made this thing work....and i didn't do anything special,just installed and didn't give a shit about the instructions"
,ace5903,2011-06-22T11:37Z,ok well i'm not able to get it to install i'm useing xp service pack 3 with all updates and can't get the framework 3.0 to install thanks for the try

,umarnawazkhan,2011-07-04T02:01Z,"does nero vision have any problems?
becz it stop's working after few days?"
,Beefyis316,2011-07-06T08:07Z,"GUYS THIS WORKS!!! I NEVER COMMENT BUT I AM THIS TIME!! THERE IS A NOTEPAD FILE THAT SAYS ""Instructies +Serial"" WITH a few serial numbers in it...If you open Nero smart start, click on the menu and go to ""get serial"" you open up the serial numbers page..you need to add all the serials from the notepad to here..Except for the last one which for some reason does not work..Then Also I disabled all internet access for the program. This allowed me to use Vision..Im not lying it took me 4 hours to figure this out..This worked for me! "
,Amegon,2011-09-30T13:40Z,Keygen is only a program that shows always the same serials. no variations!
