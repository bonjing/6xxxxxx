,firsteye,2011-03-07T21:04Z,"@Likeadidas95 games aren't just about graphics for me that's actually the 4th most important part behind playability, enjoyable characters and story content... it's sad that people have become such graphics hores that they dismiss a game just because they sacrificed graphics for more game content / to come in on budget ya those pretty textures cost money something you obviously don't care about you have 0 right to complain especially since you haven't even tried it yet and even after since your pirating it."

,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-09T14:33Z,"so u installed this with daemon tools? so why are these fuck wits going on about phoenix, fuckin dicks delayed me from even trying to download this"
,kaz050,2011-03-09T15:14Z,"@Devilishredbeardishness

i agree it would be nice too have a lil text on how too.but they say there are 2 ways.1 is mount with daemon tools and open the cd and hit setup it will install steam but u still need a key. and the othere is with phoenix wich i have no idea on a how too install"
,dvdplaya,2011-03-09T15:26Z,you're the idiot.  it won't even install because Steam opens up and asks for a key!
,Kogelkauwer,2011-03-09T15:44Z,"@cainyboy

,Bendico,2011-03-09T16:48Z,"@Kogelkauwer

,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-09T22:12Z,"hold on u can't install without a steam key, this is fucked then"
,-pexi88-,2011-03-09T23:29Z,this need sim pack or some else way to install becouse no serial and crack. and crack does help anything becouse you cant install game without key!
,Bendico,2011-03-10T03:14Z,"@cainyboy

Fuckin' aye."
,elturbo9077,2011-03-10T05:31Z,"cainyboy

i have been downloading stuff also from a long time ago and i recommend to people not to download this becuase this game has steam and to crack steam you need to crack the client and the exe of the game and to install the game you need a custom installer the installer that brings the games does not install on crack versions if anyone wants the game i would say wait for the group release only noobs download this 

and downloading this is ok but if u have a key or make a custom installer then copy the crack only when they release it "
,elturbo9077,2011-03-10T05:32Z,"cainyboy

i agree what u say about noobs"
,elturbo9077,2011-03-10T05:35Z,same thing happen to the retail version of fallout new vegas there where retail copies here but the steam version crack does not work on a retail copy 
,wilson1375,2011-03-10T06:01Z,what the fuck is phoenix
,wilson1375,2011-03-10T06:03Z,"Oh, and if you would be so kind to put ""NOCRACK"" in the title next time"
,mgcg88,2011-03-10T06:06Z,"@Cainiboy
I'm not stupid or dumb and I understand a lot of downloading any kind of stuff,but I'm not being able to install the game too,it installs steam and asks for serial.
So shut the fuck up and stop saying that who can't install are noobs and ""dickheads""."
,kudos128,2011-03-10T06:25Z,lol at these nublings that dont even know that most of these games run on cracks
,SlazsH,2011-03-10T06:31Z,"lol, it's not meant to be installed yet. no need to cry about it. just wait for serials/keygens and a crack.
it's all about downloading it ahead of time."
,PredatorRules,2011-03-10T13:45Z,"@SlazsH
tru to that, All i need to do right now is to wait for a crack by Skidrow/RELOADED/FLT - or any crack that will work with no problems"
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-10T14:15Z,"I worry about steam though,"
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-10T18:11Z,"yeah but it asking for a key through steam preinstall, says to me requires steam pre online activation before install, which means this would have to come precracked, hence this iso would be useless, because only a post installed, version could be cracked, but hey i could be wrong"
,Wlbc,2011-03-10T20:21Z,"I have a crack here but as I go through the activation of serial steam? can you help me? so I can post the true crack here

sorry I do not speak English"
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-10T20:30Z,so what we do now?
,Bigd616,2011-03-10T20:56Z,Look Guys I Say Wait until a week or so has pasted and just download one that has crack too or that is pre cracked

i just buy the game....and all my trouble are gone."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-11T11:02Z,"hey if u've got the money, besides its only a 5 hour campaign, so this game is for the mp anyway."
,dr.pluto,2011-03-11T11:36Z,not realy got the money but i want it all...not just sp but mp too ;)
,Baron1981pl,2011-03-11T12:35Z,"A few days ago appeared Homefront-SKIDROW torrent and i have downloaded it. Installation is different from that with Steam, but it still requires a key. The key is in the folder with the crack, but it is packed with zip. and needs a key to unpack it. everything seems correct in this folder are files: Steamclient.dll, steam_appid.txt, keygen.exe, Click For Password.url, Binaries"
,Lt.Hawk,2011-03-11T15:46Z,I am going to try Phoenix and see if that will allow me to get a working copy.
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-11T16:26Z,"@ dr.pluto, I'mnot really worried about this game, there is no guarantees with is, it just looks like cod 6, u get bonuses for ur kills in that too. The game I'm hangin for is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, thats got a truly unique Multi player."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-11T16:28Z,"@ Baron1981pl , I'm sorry but, I'll believe it when I see it."
,d15a5t3r,2011-03-11T16:36Z,"OMG the internet is for some reason flooded with fake cracks and full versions of the game. Why can't people just get a life and wait for the real masters of this art like Reloaded (who has always had top notch torrents) to release a real version. Too many times have I seen all PC games canceled in the industry because people cant keep their mouth shut about an uncracked version of a game including EA MMA, Madden 11, NCAA 2010 and 2011... just for some recent names. I am a graphic and production developer for Crytek and it is very hard to even get the idea of a PC game in production stages anymore because of the publicity of the piracy. I believe in shareware and it's how I began my career but under the cover of the internet."
,Kronical4,2011-03-11T17:44Z,"@Devilishredbeardishness

I was in the beta for the MP, on the ps3, and played the full game on ps3, the MP was fun for the first day or two, but it gets really repetitive, real fast. You get a ""target"" to kill as someone has a ""target"" on you, and so on. Don't get me wrong it's cool, and new idea, but  it gets old fast, the real juice of the game is in the SP. Though I don't want to try to turn you off that, maybe it was just me. Just letting you know so you ""could"" be ready for it. :)"
,Kronical4,2011-03-11T17:47Z,"By the way i am not talking about Homefront, it's Assassin Creed Brother Hood, should of stated that, don't want to confuse people sorry."

when I install the game it asks steam to be online & when its online it says type a serial & I have seen all comments no serial around!"

forget the liars I don't think this torrent is gonna work even if there was a crack! The game won't work because the crack would be placed over the main exe example homefrome.exe

This is a steam install in order to install it you need a serial & steam is connected online  so it will check for its authenticity.

Press Scan a SIM-file, point to the .sim file on the Homefront.ISO -> hit scan a SIM-file again -> click Homefront on the top box -> choose your destination folder -> hit unpack.

You just have to open the image (Homefront.iso) via Deamon or some virtual mechanics and COPY all contents of ""DVD"" to your disk. Now move the installer into folder with install stuff, launch it and read the screen instructions. Remember - if ""any key"" doesnt work, use ENTER!

Installation takes few minutes, I have the game unpacked now at 9,54 GB. We now just need to wait for some proper crack!"
,m377z0r,2011-03-15T12:31Z,Ok guys you seem to have the warez scene all mixed up. nobody relases a crack in a pw protected .rar It has never been done and will never be done. Warez are supposed to be free that means that you do not password protect the rars in order to make people go onto some bullshit site and answer alot of crappy surveys. All those files are and will always be fake and probably also virii. The crack will be released by some groups when they are done cracking it. No you dont activate a pirated game on steam to me that seems. well.. uh dumb? I dont understand why people pay attention to the dicks posting these links they are obviously fake. But i can understand how some people that are new will fall for these tricks. So kids do not download password protected cracks as they are in 99% of the cases FAKE AND INFESTED WITH VIRUSES!

Devilshred, why are you always this happy when you write? :) And its funny, out of the comment you wrote Homefront sucked since you could not get the multiplayer to work. and other people should not buy it because of that. hahahaha, i hope that was a mistake. ordered it yesterday for ĂÂŁ20, I hope i have it before the weekend.

,SlazsH,2011-03-17T05:15Z,"Ok, to those being stuck in the main menu, there is some confusion on how to use the 1.3gb updater.

1. Extract the SIM file from phoenix to a folder named ""Homefront"" (my mistake first was placed it in a folder with a random name)

2. When the Phoenix extraction is over, transfer the ""Homefront"" folder into another folder (Name the folder to let's say ""Steam"")

3. Run the 1.3gb updater and from there, select the directory ""Steam"" not ""Homefront"" or else it will create a Homefront folder inside your Homefront folder.

*You will know if you done it right if you will be asked to overwrite files.*

Thanks to Chosen"

1st Mounted Torrent using Demon Tools

2nd Used Phoenix 15 beta 3 to extract the sim file from the mounted torrent.

3 The extraction makes a new folder with all the folders and sub folders. (primary game folders)

4th Used the updater and copied over the folder to the folders that Phoenix made (Primary game folders) 1646 i think in total

5th used the crack to replace the main files in folders that Phoenix extracted.

,brutal_product,2011-03-17T16:41Z,"all is well except for sound and video settings, neither of which will save after restarting the game. video settings hold in game but not after restarting. audio settings only hold in options, but default when game launches. a minor problem, but...save game works. had to open the Chinese site with IE for ftp download, apparently firefox didn't like it. thx for everything in this torrents comments, they helped immensely.

This is a totally awesome looking game if you have the hardware. And this game has so much potential. But the wonky fuckin mechanics, the horrid AI, the atrocious voice acting, and the over all glitchy/bug ridden gameplay makes this 10 lbs of shit in a 5 lb bag. If you really must play it, then spend the time getting it to work, but trust me, you won't be missing anything by waiting for a proper scene rls crack. Although the MP Practice maps are beautifully rendered and would be great, there will most likely be no official server support because the SP sucks balls. Playing thru much of this was a chore.

,chosen0001,2011-03-18T19:53Z,"@busta5000
you have to update your phoenix before you unpack the sim and make sure you copied the 1.3gb update correctly 

@shangry
you cant copy the links from the image. you just have to manually type them into a new window word from word since TPB wont let me post them on here"

thn copy the crack into binaries? "
,brutal_product,2011-03-19T04:43Z,"this is how I got it to run:
1. copy contents of ISO/image to a new folder on desktop
2. copy/paste installer into said folder (look for torrent)
3. run installer as ADMINISTRATOR (I had to dl msvcr100.dll into same folder for it  to run (google it) 
4. choose install path.  I chose Program Files (x86). If all files are correct, you will go thru a series of y/n prompts and the files will begin extracting, takes 10+ minutes. It creates a folder in Program Files(x86) called ""Program"" and installs to there. Rename ""Program"" folder to Homefront. 
5. download 3DMGAEM.Homefront.for.Steam.Unlock.Version.Update and extract and/or run this to it's own folder. It will create a sub-folder called Homefront.
6. copy the new sub-folder Homefront to Program Files (x86), overwrite and merge. 
7. dl current no-dvd crack, copy/paste/OVERWRITE to \Program Files(x86)\Homefront\Bin (where the .exe is)
8. Get ready to waste 4 hours of your precious life on this piece of shit."

yeah it is. "
,pot2_76,2011-03-19T05:24Z,"this is how i got it to work:
1.Before you extract make sure to update phoenix program to the latest beta   (version 1.5 beta 3) then click instruments/update  CDR/internet.Wait for update to finish.(you can download phoenix here at tpb just do the update).
2.Mount homefront iso(i use poweriso).On phoenix click instruments again/sid unpacker/browes for the sid file homefront.
3.This is very important follow instructions carefully!Before extracting sid file make new folder on your desktop and name it homefront and extract files there.After extraction
 is complete, transfer homefront folder into another folder(name that folder...i named it steam).
4.Run the 1.3gb updater and from there select the steam folder not the homefront folder.(you will know if your correct if it asks you to overwrite files). 
5.Copy and paste crack in binaries folder(if ask to overwrite then overwrite it).
6.Play the game!
Hopes this will help specially for those who are getting stuck on the main menu."

,Rebellman,2011-03-19T18:04Z,"@Lastgameking
Sorry, I didn't have your problem. But when I tried to install this game at first time it didn't work well 'coz I didn't update the Phoenix succesfully, check that you open Phoenix as ""ADMINISTRATOR"" and then update it. After updating, close phoenix and open it again, then use it. By doing that I managed to get it, then I tried use the update only by unzipping it and pasting it into the ""Binaries"" folder. That didn't work because couldn't even use the options or SP buttons. Then I copied the crack there but same problem. So if you follow my instructions to the so far that you have copied the inside of the update to the binaries, you should be able to run the game but no play it... :S Sorry if this didn't help... Remember that I need some help too because I can't start a game."

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6242645/installer_for_homefront

2. Extract all the content within the ISO file with WINRAR or any other ISO tool.

3. Put the Kwadie Homefront installer into the directory where you extracted the ISO.

4. Download msvcr100.dll from here:

http://www.dll-files.com/msvcr100.zip?0WMmUGbEeS 

and extract it into the same directory you extracted the ISO.

5. Create a folder anywhere on your hard drive that is not protected.

6. Run the Kwadie Homefront installer and everything else should be self explained.

7. If you complete this process and you don't see the Homefront directory where the files ""installed"", RESTART YOUR COMPUTER!

If the files are where they should be, then download the sound and ammo crackfix from UFO.sule here:

,imaculate,2011-03-24T07:12Z,game works great after doing myth1337's instructions!  Thanks NEIRO15 for upload and myth1337 for the instructions.  The game isn't too bad.  Been playing it for about 2 hours now.  Feels like COD MW 2 single player....
,imaculate,2011-03-24T07:19Z,I followed myth1337's instructions and the game works perfectly with no issues.  Been playing it for the last 2 hours.  I reminds me of COD: MW2 single player.  Thanks myth1337 for the instructions and thanks to NEIRO15 for the upload!
,wtfjbl,2011-03-24T12:32Z,"myth1337, nice work! This is a confirmed solution. Works very well and no issues on 7UltimateX64. One tip: The kwadie installer made a folder on my C drive named ""program"" despite me setting a path. But it's okay...a simple cut and paste did the job ;).

So everyone follow myth1337 instructions! "
,Blackluc,2011-03-24T16:47Z,"Myth1337's intructions do not work for me, the game crashes at menu. Currently downloading the Skidrow release..."
