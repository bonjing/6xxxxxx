uncheck the ""share security threats"" checkbox on the use agreement screen."
,cuticle,2011-04-07T01:17Z,"@PhilLesh12

I unchecked the box, and it still asked for a password. the username it must have gained from the keygen was ""nimrod@lipshit.com""

I'm not sure what to make of it. I double checked and there's no way to contact it"

it makes you do that because multiple antivirus programs can conflict with each other

@everyone else
when the key works, it asks you to make an account. when you make an account, you provide your email address and a password. then when someone else uses your key, it asks them to provide these details to make sure you don't get your key stolen. SO, when it asks for a password for an email, that means someone beat you to that key and already made their own account with it. The uploader is not going to have the password for it. "
