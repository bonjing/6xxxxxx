

Full Title:  Nina Simone - Tell It Like It Is: Rarities & Previously Unreleased Recordings 1967-73.

Review:
Brief though it was, Nina Simone's tenure at RCA between 1967 and 1973 amassed an impressive 9 albums, many of which stand as creative peaks in her lengthy career.

However, her imposing tally of recordings did not stop there, as witnessed by the numerous studio alternate takes and unreleased recordings that have graced the countless reissues and 'greatest hits' comps over recent years.

On this double CD, the best of these alternate takes are neatly brought together in one place along with a few exciting, previously unreleased recordings, to make this album an essential purchase for all Nina Simone enthusiasts.

Both CDs contain 2 previously unreleased recordings, many exceptionally rare versions plus the full unedited version of Why? (The King of Love is Dead). The collection is produced in conjunction with the Dr. Nina Simone Foundation.
