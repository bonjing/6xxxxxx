,Vid_Pillager,2011-03-11T04:09Z,"Thanks for another great upload! 
I need help finding a movie (released in theaters this year--may not be out yet?) my daughter wants to see. 
I'm looking for the name ... The movie is a love story about a boy and girl growing up in a small town. They live next door to each other and go to school together. That's all she could tell me LOL! If someone can help that would be great!"

,ps3_in_az,2011-04-25T02:38Z,"Dear Playstation3user, you are an idiot! I use extremezone's DEFACED torrents on my PS3 with no problems. Just download to an external hard drive or thumb drive and then plug 'n play. If your PS3 does not support certain file formats, use E.M. Total Video Converter - HD version 3.71(from the Pirate Bay) to convert to DivX.Avi format for easy PS3 use. By the way, you rock extremezone, keep up the good work!"
,scotsman163,2011-04-25T20:09Z,"always been extremely impressed at all downloads from extremezone, i specifically made this profile so i could comment and say thank you! "
