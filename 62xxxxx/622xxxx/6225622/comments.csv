,xw0lf,2011-03-09T12:25Z,"F*CKERS, please SEED! (or die)

i not plane to feed leechers all my life..

after 2 days of seeding this torrent, i and my friend are only 2 seeders all the time, while 9 idiots finish download and close torrent... (selfish bastards)

keep the seed, show respect to uploaders and other ppl. give chance to others to finish torrent!"
,rhflem12345,2011-03-10T09:32Z,Please seed if you have it.Thank you.
,acka23,2012-02-11T21:12Z,"Only 3 out of the 12 files playable I tried every player but will not do it, has anybody else got the same problem?"
,acka23,2012-02-11T21:25Z,"I am happy to seed but 9 out of 12 files will not play ,what a waste of time."
,Birdsand,2012-02-15T10:17Z,Excellent quality. These films are just a joy to watch. Johnny Weissmuller IS Tarzan. Maureen O'Sullivan left to have lots of kids and a brown haired British actress gets replaced with a blonde haired American actress. Though Brenda Joyce (in the later films) is fun to watch. And then there's Boy. Makes you feel warm an fuzzy.
,Birdsand,2012-02-15T10:18Z,And yes...I'm still seeding and will continue to do. THANK YOU to the uploader.
,demonbeast,2012-03-06T00:01Z,Can someone confirm that only 3 are playable?
,demonbeast,2012-03-07T07:50Z,All 12 movies play on VLC - ignore comment above...
