,yofro,2011-04-05T22:44Z,"Thank you FXG for the upload. 

Just a heads up for everyone! My roommates and I got a letter from Charter stating that Columbia Pictures contacted them about copyright infringment for downloading this file, movie title: ""The Tourist"" on 04-01-11. I'm the only one who downloads anything in the whole house xD

So funny because I hadn't downloaded in a month and decided to just get this for the hell of it :p and had just told my friend, who is super scared of torrenting, that they're perfectly fine. 

Not faking it and not trying to scare anyone because honestly, there are way too many of us. Guess now I can add myself to the ""I have been warned"" list."
,rdkt11,2011-04-08T16:54Z,"Video and audio quality are great.

AS for the movie itself, it was terrible.  The end was obvious from about 15 minutes into the film, and Angelina Jolie is an awful actress.  She just tries to look like a femme fatale for the whole time.  A pretty matronly femme fatale.  The fact that this got nominated for several awards shows that the whole thing is fixed."
,Sicy,2011-04-09T23:39Z,How do you get the english subtitles on? Anyone please?

,734Ch3r4u,2011-05-04T18:07Z,"Am I the only one that couldn't find English subtitles for the non-English Parts Only?  FXGâ€™s torrent provides English subs but even the spoken English parts have English subtitles.  I couldnâ€™t find any English subs for the non-English Parts Only on any of the subtitle sites that would sync up properly with FXGâ€™s torrent.  Anyway, I broke down and made the subs myself.  If anyone wants the English subtitles for non-English Parts Only, let me know how I can upload them to you.  I tried uploading them on a few sites but when I search for them myself I canâ€™t find my own upload.  Perhaps there is a delay.

Although this torrent didnâ€™t have the proper English subtitles for non-English Parts Only, since Axxoâ€™s retirement FXG has stepped up in a big way and my hat is always off to the FXG Team.  FXG is always my #1 download source.

Just so that people know, to get subtitles (in windows media player) you have to rename the subtitle file (.srt) to the exact same as the film obviously without changing the extension. Then press alt, go to 'Play' then hit lyrics, captions and subtitles and then English. Hope this helps guys!"
