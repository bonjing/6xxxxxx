,scottsasse,2011-03-31T00:47Z,"WOW!! I'm only downloading 1 350MB episode from season 2 and 24 hours later I am only at 25%!! To top it off I've already seeded out that 25% to a 5.31 ratio and I'm lucky to get in 1.3kbps. SO........what I'm saying to all 59 of my peers out there (just you selfish ones) is do the right thing and SEED out at LEAST what you're taking in and this torrent will go much faster. Otherwise Dexter and I will hunt you down!!!          *********************************************************Many, many THANKS to LaMerck for the upload and THANKS to all you PROPER past, present and future seeders out there!! Love, DrScott"
