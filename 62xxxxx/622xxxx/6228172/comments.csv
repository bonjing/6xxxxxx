Thanx again"
,Ghanijazz,2011-03-09T00:46Z,"when release damn crack
without crack this torrent is useless"
,dumas1000,2011-03-09T01:32Z,"It's much easier to download games pre-crack if you have limited brandwidth. Leechers on official releases hammer any potential of getting recent speeds. One dragon Age 2 torrent on this site has 817 leechers and 1 seed. If you download games early, you get better results. So no, this file is not ""useless."" 

My speed caps out at 175 kb/s, more or less. If you have the means to obtain much faster speeds, then I suppose you wouldn't care. I have a feeling that most people don't get significantly more than 175 on average though."
[T],Knaster,2011-03-09T06:54Z,The singleplayer part is apparently only 5 hours long. Im not going near this then!!!!
,xidio,2011-03-09T09:16Z,"Why download the game and play it if you find 5 hours too short?
There is also multiplayer which the games main focus is at."
,fippmeister,2011-03-09T10:45Z,"I share Yatzee's views on multiplayer. Still, five hours is five hours, and if half of the PR bull they kept spouting about how this game would revolutionize the way stories are told through gaming, I figure it ought to be a good five hour gaming stretch. Heck, might be a fun five hours even if it's a generic FPS; more entertainment than most movies give me. (="
,IceDeathBoy,2011-03-09T15:59Z,5 hours of fun and intresting story. i give it all for just a really good 2 hour story in any games... And also there are diffrent difficulties to play. 5 hours on hardes.. hmm. Dunno..
,RKO1989,2011-03-09T17:31Z,"@Likeadidas95  --kid its just a iso.mount it with daemon tools or something,install d game,wait for a crack...its that simple."
,FoxFire2012,2011-03-10T11:31Z,"@RKO1989

How do you expect us to install the game when it's asking for a steam activation key?

Have you even downloaded the game and tried to install it yourself? Because clearly, you have't."
,qrsboy,2011-03-10T12:40Z,could you upload mlb 2k11
,Baron1981pl,2011-03-11T12:33Z,"A few days ago appeared Homefront-SKIDROW torrent and i have downloaded it. Installation is different from that with Steam, but it still requires a key. The key is in the folder with the crack, but it is packed with zip. and needs a key to unpack it. everything seems correct in this folder are files: Steamclient.dll, steam_appid.txt, keygen.exe, Click For Password.url, Binaries"
,ricsiba,2011-03-11T21:38Z,"Baron1981pl!!!!!!!

yes you uloaded this skidrow.. i get it but cant do surveys for the password!
what is the password?? pls write it for me! 
i! d much like to play this game for a long time.. 
richard hungarian

great thnks if you send it to me"
,junkbokx,2011-03-12T09:31Z,"Calm down, ricsiba. There is no Skidrow release of this game, and if there was it would damn well not require some lame survey scam to obtain the serial.

This torrent is nothing more than the Steam files legit users can download in advance of the March 15 release date. There will be no crack for this game until after March 15, at which time everyone will probably need to re-download this game.

As for my view on multiplayer games, they fill me with murderous rage if I lose. I find this to be a very disturbing and uncharacteristic aspect of my personality, so I now eschew the multiplayer experience. Playing the hell out of this game for five hours is about the amount of time I have to spare playing games. Is downloading an action movie any different?"
,SweatyGremlins,2011-03-12T12:19Z,"I used to get a lot of game rage, all my controllers\keyboards had bite marks, eventually i kicked my TV through a wall :\

It takes a while but you can get rid of it, just try calm yourself each time and if it does not work turn it off and come back to it later.

Keep trying and eventually it starts to settle in."
,nooralmadi008,2011-03-12T18:37Z,how to install the game if there is steam
