Enemy Territory Ultimate Installer is a very simple installer that gathers all you need to play to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. With the regular files, you need at least 3 steps to install version 2.60b. With ET Ultimate Installer, there's only one file to download and all the files needed will be installed in a few seconds.

It is especially made for all the beginners and for people who want to (re)install ET quickly and easily. It's faster and easier to use than the usual installers! You will get the latest patch, the maps most commonly used (at least in competition), the most played mods, etc. Why not trying it then? ;)

Features:

The game Enemy Territory (for Windows)
The latest 2.60b patch
The latest version of PunkBuster (December 9, 2009)
