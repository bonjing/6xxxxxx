,iPod87,2011-03-06T12:59Z,"Thanks for all the new uploads HR. Your uploads are always of the highest quality.

I'm trying to upload a few older movies that you've missed along the way. Trying to add soft subtitles where possible too.

Your uploading much higher quality BR Rips (e.g. The Next Three Days) than me so I'll leave all the newer uploads to you."

,DFigotin,2011-03-10T20:18Z,"Really wanted to see this movie and when I finally did, it was so horrible. The actors have no chemistry with each other through out the whole movie. Never though James Brooks would disappoint; especially this badly."
