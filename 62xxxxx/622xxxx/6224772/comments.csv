THIS torrent is: Family Guy - S09E13 -Trading Places- V-XviD|A-mp3.avi

IMDB:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1795203/

Doesn't the name make sense? TRADING PLACES? In the above episode, Stewie makes an Evil Twin of himself. His Evil Twin tries to eliminate the ""REAL"" Stewie and chaos ensues. 

Why would the title, ""The hand that rocks the Wheelchair"" make any sense for THIS episode. 

To ALL TPB members and Guest that end up reading these comments: This IS episode 13 of SEASON 9. 

IT IS NOT! episode 12 as the  made by the above named individuals falsely claim.

TRUST eztv, he's a long time up-loader and has his facts straight. If he labeled it SO9EP13 . . . Then that is what it is!

Helping to keep the facts straight :~)
THANKS big time eztv. The download went really quick (17 minutes) and as usual the quality is superb!!!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-03-13T09:51Z,"I owe an apology to @rndmfrd222 & @DeltaPan, please accept it. I was incorrect, and they are absolutely right, This is labeled wrong. Episode 13 of season 9 isn't airing until 3/20/2011 . Its my fault of ""jumping the gun"" before I'd watched the entire download.

My bad. I haven't know eztv to make such errors?? I spoke to soon, sorry to all. Thanks eztv, no one is perfect. . .My thanks is sincere, I needed this episode to be up to date anyway."
,sketos,2011-03-14T04:40Z,"this is not s9ep13.
