,320hunter,2011-03-07T00:27Z,"@ neonrainbow It is no secret that i have a dozen ""green & pink accounts :)"
[V],neon,2011-03-07T09:46Z,A dozen ???...on here you mean or spread out elsewhere...i dont want to miss out on great music uploads :)
,320hunter,2011-03-07T13:59Z,"@ neonrainbow! Yes i have a couple of places but have ""PirateBay"" largest place of accounts in every conceivable color 3 green 11 pink. But I only use ""320hunter"" for a while and start over. I Have about fifty who recognize me with my odd stuff to look around a bit at 320 torrents from 2004 :)"
,brendl,2012-01-21T19:08Z,"What the hell is this shit. The quality is incredibly inconsistent across all songs. Most of the songs are poor quality. I have checked with a spectrum analyzer and the quality definately isn't up to scratch. Most songs are missing a lot of high frequency information. This is an indication of a fake 320kbs rip. Either that or it has been extremely poorly ""remastered"". I have since obtained much higher quality rips than the ones present in this torrent."
,brendl,2012-01-21T19:26Z,"Just wanted to also add that there is a shit load of annoying distortion that is audible as well. Compared with the true FLAC copy I have, this is extremely rubbish."
