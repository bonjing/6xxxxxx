,muthineni,2011-03-08T16:23Z,"good evening sir.
back from my hiatus. but luckily got my shows as regular or weekly reups (thanks to that genius brain of urs..)

n now will take hereafter, blackswan, morning glory and other 720p which are surpisingly hale and healthy till now (the leechers usually suck them out dry)
nothing from this pack though, just wanted to thank you here.
will be following and seeding sincerely from now on for a few weeks atleast. god bless."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-08T16:35Z,"Hi muthineni. Glad to see you back. I have couple of 720p on server and if something is slow, let me know.

Thanks, folks!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-08T17:11Z,"@banukaknight: Because 2h51 rip cannot be small. Few seconds before I pressed Search button on this page (wow!) and found few 1.3-2 GB rips on TPB. Avoid HDTV version you can find on www (yes, I just did that too). In short, for reason not known to human kind, that good movie never was released on BluRay, and DVD seems as dieing thing.  I do not have Abyss disk, I cannot get one, only thing I could would be low-bit plain re-encode in iPod or 352p format in probably 400-500 MB range."
,Ataractic,2011-03-08T17:35Z,Thanks for mad love. Just wanted to know- will you be upping it regularly?
,coolasad,2011-03-08T17:43Z,thanks for House.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-08T18:20Z,"@Ataractic: Yes, it's good."

I can't believe they are cancelling SGU!!! Anyone heard anything different please post here!"

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-08T19:01Z,"@Jon and all SGU fans: Yes, announced in December.

""Six Reasons SGU Was Cancelled
1) Year-Round Scheduling
2) The Move to Tuesday
3) Professional Wrestling
4) Time-Shifting and Online Viewing
5) Mid-Season Breaks
6) âŚ Viewers Just Werenât There""

thanks a bundle man for including house.

+1 as always"
,stinto,2011-03-08T19:37Z,"has something changed with recent encodes as this movie and a few others ie bluray.720p. H264  are no longer playing correctly is the upload being corrupted 
I have no fault with previous uploads as I quitelike your encodes this seems to affect only the last week or so
thx fer sgu"
,froglog,2011-03-08T20:04Z,Thanks
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-08T20:08Z,"@stinto; First voice. I haven't ""broke"" a thing, in fact, two days ago 480p was announced here, from long time user, as ""playable"" again, on  Mac, under QuickTime. Since 480p and 720p use ABSOLUTELY SAME setting (only 720p have understandably a higher bitrate) - I cannot see nor find any reasonable explanation for playback problems you have recently.

Since nobody else have said something like you just did, I only tip on local problems. You should use Reference Playback System from link I placed for good reason as part of long Header, and if you run Windows of any kind, there shouldn't be any problem in installing the items or find counterparts for different operating system, if needed."
,mjkuyu,2011-03-08T20:17Z,House!......YAY!!

What's the difference between the Mar 6 version S03E07 of Being Human and the Mar 7?"

"">twentyforty at 2011-03-07 18:27 CET: 
Sorry for audio drop outs on Being Human, but it's has been aired without the sound at all on few places. Official RIVER 550 MB XviD has even longer dropouts and 1.46 GB hannibal have them too, in same manner and on same places."""

Have you heard of the web TV shorts spin off Becoming Human? Our speed is too slow for streaming and I think not playable in our region....."
