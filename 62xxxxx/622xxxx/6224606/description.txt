Contains two albums: 

1) Dulce Et Decorum Est

and

2) Kleos


Each album has two folders. The first folder contains "audio files", which are lossless quality audio files. They are best played in Windows Media Player. 

The second folder contains images of each disc. You can burn the image using the free program ImgBurn (Google it). It's fairly straight-forward.

I have up'd this torrent because my previous two got messed up and I apparently no longer have 100% of the files. 


HOPE YOU ENJOY!
