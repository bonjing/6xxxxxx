├óΓé¼┼ôCoca-Cola wants to teach the world to sing, but in the process they├óΓé¼Γäóve trashed water supplies, peddled sugar to generations of kids, and undermined workers├óΓé¼Γäó rights around the world. Put down your soda, read The Coke Machine, and join the global movement to rein in unaccountable corporations.├óΓé¼┬¥[color=deepskyblue]
