I feel kind of noobish asking, but is there something I'm missing?"

,predictable2042,2011-08-10T06:07Z,"Don't bother downloading this one, IP's are being logged and you'll receive a copyright infringement notice from your ISP :-/"
,K0nsol,2011-08-22T05:39Z,Yup being watched. Received notice. DONT DOWNLOAD !!!!!
,ghandi253,2011-10-14T03:49Z,Get yourselves peer block and you'll be good to go.
,drako314,2012-01-16T13:20Z,"wow great upload speed MB thanks people!

A=10
V=8.5
Great quality even on 1080 hi def, an so very funny."
,EMINEMROCKZ34,2012-02-11T22:31Z,"@Zatticus the only time stuff skips is if the op fucks up or you stop downloading it before it finished like its at 55.9% and you ""open containing folder"" and try to watch it then if you didnt do that try re-downloading it"
,daedalis,2012-03-16T19:05Z,Definitely being monitored - received a notice from my ISP. Either get Peerblock per ghandi253's suggestion or download another version with fingers crossed.
,wtfname,2012-05-02T19:08Z,I can't believe I just found this guy.  He is extremely funny to the point I was Crying.  Thanks for the UL TVTeam!
,xpmule,2012-06-12T00:07Z,"so uhh who gave you the emails ?
you seem to have left that part out lol

also i find it strange that ""they"" have all your email address's..
that seems a bit odd

I've never received an email from an isp EVER .
I have had an isp PHONE someone i know and say they received a complaint.
Which i think was bullshit and was because of high bandwidth usage anyway.

Bottom line is there is a LOT of people
out therewho's job it is to wander around the internet spreading false information and to intimidate / scare people away from piracy..
This is a known fact, so it seems a little foolish to simply believe every thing people say on the internet but if you people want to do that then have at 'er lol

And by the way, any anti-piracy groups want some of this come and get it :)
Bring it bitches !
over a decade of piracu and still goin strong.
Kiss my ass :)"
,xpmule,2012-06-12T00:09Z,oh and i would laugh my ass off if i got an email for this because i never did download it lol
