Plot Summary:
--------------------
 Next in the four-part Marvel Anime project and broadcasts after the Iron Man anime. Wolverine is a mutant,
possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical 
capabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually 
any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate

The first episode of the series brings us to a time where Logan is drawn back to Japan to rescue Mariko from her father.
At this point in his history, it's to set up his great Japan 
adventure that helped truly define the character in the 80's where he gained his concepts of honor and family.

Synopsis:
--------------

Episode 9 is Titled "Hell Road"
---------------------------------
 Logan and yukio begin their battle through the Deadly traps that give the hell road it's fearsome reputation.
The 1st trap they encounter fires hundreds of razor sharp spears at them from the walls, they manage to get past but
The Bike is destroyed leaving them to set out on foot and fall straight into a spear filled pit. Meanwhile the rebel leader Koh 
gathers his men and prepares for their attack on the dragon palace. Yokio and Logan escape the pit but run straight into 
one of the criminal gangs responsible for setting them and another fight begins. Elsewhere Shingen tells the robot statue Vadhaka 
that he will have another chance to atone for his disgrace in failing to kill Logan. As Yukio and logan fight their way through 
the thugs and their traps the criminals also start to take advantage of the disruption of the status quo and attack each other,
causing even more chaos and destruction. The rebels start their march behind Master Koh and his apprentice Min but their "secret 
tunnel" falls far short of the map they showed Logan and they surface at the entrance to Hell Road and begin the march down it.
 Logan and Yukio have been delayed by some giant pendulum blades but he takes a desperate gambel and breaks through. 
 The chaos intensifies and all the gangs join the battle, wrecking each others traps further and killing each other off so that 
by the time Min,Koh and the rebels arrive there is very little left to threaten them, Wolverine realises he was duped into 
running the gauntlet and clearing the danger for them as there never was a secret tunnel. Logan and Yukio leave the rebels 
to deal with the last of the defenders while they head on to the Dragon Palace but they are stopped by the appearance of
Kikyo, the Mutant assassin is back to settle his score.
