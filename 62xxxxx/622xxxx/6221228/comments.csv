,some-young-guy,2011-03-05T16:18Z,"Without watching the whole movie, I just skipped through it randomly to summarize the A/V and here's my take;

A-8, some background hiss throughout, but this will most likely not be noticed after a solid minute of watching the movie

V-7, good quality, but obviously cropped and since there's quite a few dark scenes, the darkness becomes blurred.  At least the colored places are vibrant and not lacking like so many other cams.

Great upload though, and I am thankful."

V?"
,KnottyBoi,2011-03-16T06:12Z,Does the camera shake up and down in the middle or have a head in the way like the other?
