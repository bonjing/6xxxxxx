Jalacy Hawkins (July 18, 1929, Cleveland, Ohio â€” February 12, 2000, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France). 

Best known as Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Jalacy Hawkins was an African-American musician, singer, and actor. Famed chiefly for his powerful, operatic vocal delivery and wildly theatrical performances of songs such as "I Put a Spell on You" and "Constipation Blues", Hawkins sometimes used macabre props onstage, making him the one of few original shock rockers.

1982 Compilation from the legend best known for his theatrical stage presence & his immortal 1956 rendering of 'I Put A Spell On You', which is included here. 14 tracks in all.
