Six years after they revolutionized R&B and soul with their debut album, Keep on Movin', Soul
II Soul returned with Vol. V: Believe. Since their debut, the soul collective had been struggling
to regain their position as musical innovators; in the process, they turned out two confused
albums that had their moments, but nothing quite as stirring as their initial singles, which were
collected on the British-only Volume IV: The Classic Singles. Believe, their fourth album of
original material, doesn't necessarily make a case for Soul II Soul as pioneers in the mid-'90s,
but it does represent something of a comeback. Where their two previous albums were
muddled affairs, Believe is clear and confident, filled with fully formed songs. It helps that
Jazzie B, the leader of the group, has persuaded former members Caron Wheeler and Penny
Ford to make appearances on the album, and has recruited some genuine new talent that
helps spark him into recording his best music since the group's debut. Granted, it doesn't
push down many boundaries, but Believe fits comfortably into the laid-back, jazz-saturated
grooves of '90s R&B. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
