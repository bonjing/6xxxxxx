Helmed by master director Okamoto Kihachi (â€œSword of Doomâ€), this crime thriller tells the tale of two brothers, Ryuta and Mineo, who belong to a yakuza gang. Both secretly dream of leaving their life of crime and going straight -- Mineo to run away with his girlfriend, Ryuta to spend more time with his disabled son. 

Mineo reveals his secret wish to his brother when Ryuta is sent by the boss of the family to tell Mineo to give up his budding career as a crooner. Not only is it an embarrassment to the family, but the young girl who is the only witness to a contract killing in which Mineo was the getaway driver works at a restaurant right down the street. Ryuta better talk some sense into his hardheaded little brother soon, because the boss has only so much patience.

Also features Mifune Toshiro as an auto mechanic who is forced to let the gang bring cars to his shop after a job -- and where the bossâ€™s lieutenant is just itching to take Mineo for a midnight tuneup. If Ryuta canâ€™t straighten his brother out, what does he do -- put family business first, as he always has? Or stand up for his brother and risk his own life -- and his young sonâ€™s?
