I much prefer info from Ryan Dawson's short videos on YT.  He started out somewhat anti-Jew, but he honorably clarified his views later.

(I can't see these comments appearing just the count)

In the four or five years prior to 9/11, there were at least five remarkable public statements made by three+ elite think-tanks and public relations firms, all of them with deep ties in the government, and with official and unofficial positions authority within the Pentagon, Intelligence, Security.  These statements were in writing and/or verbal testimony to the United States Senate Armed Services Cmte.

They PUBLISHED written statements which described the VITAL need FOR a 'catalyzing and catastrophic event', 'a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat', 'a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well-being', 'a renewed threat to American security' which 'would clearly do the trick', 'a clear and present danger', a 'lucky' and 'providential' event like the 'Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor' which would arouse Americans from our 'soothing dreams of permanent neutrality'."
