Advice to people who are having trouble: 
When you are in the Registration process, disable your internet connection for a little bit, click on Validate after all the info is copied and pasted into the Registration form. Then click Next. Re-enable your internet connection again."

,dest4mex,2011-10-31T18:56Z,"I'm sorry. The program opens with a pre generated serial # that is not the serial # in the crack, therefore invalidating the ID registration code. Hmm. Doesn't work for me. I disabled the internet, and still no luck. Too bad. "
,dest4mex,2011-10-31T21:53Z,any suggestions?
