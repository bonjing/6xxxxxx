I'd just like to note that this is the same as Nat Geo's Story of Earth documentary. Only here they changed the narrator (gruffer voice). Visual quality of this is noticeably better than the Story of Earth rips, though."
,ArriFinu,2012-06-16T02:39Z,"anyone has the NatGeo's video about water on earth and its origin from deep the planet and it's less than 4 minutes (3:46)?
I guess its title is:
Earth the biography: Oceans
or:
National Geographic - History Of Earth's Oceans
I couldn't find it for download on any torrent website, I only find it on youtube, but I don't need flv files, nor to convert them and lose a&v."
