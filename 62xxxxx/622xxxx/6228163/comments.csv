Thats why it shows for you Mitzep and not for us..
So it would be better if you could upload the screenshots in some other sites.."

Thanks for the upload. I would love to support the animators of this film so they can continue their work and possibly make a longer film. Any relevant information related to this would be greatly appreciated."

this short film was made with an open source program named blender. the ppl who made it did it for free and in a year. it could be watched on youtbe. the website for the movie is http://www.sintel.org/ 
and for the program is
blender.org
support them by buying dvds and if ur interested learn 3d animation with blender. "
