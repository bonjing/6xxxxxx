,g0f3,2011-03-12T15:03Z,"@MrAntiVirus funny copy-paste statements you're doing to CC's posts. chattchitto has quite a track of genuine releases with false-positive cracks and quite a good repeatability of positive comments (dozens of thousands). you're the only one flaming these threads without any credibility and evidence of actually getting infected with viruses or non-working releases. 

don't complain for having a CRACKED software. 
either use is and make constructive comments or shut up, turn around and stick your head up your arse."
,grg426,2011-03-13T10:07Z,Thanx a lot man!You' re the top!
,theoriginalphantom,2011-03-15T11:18Z,"@MrAntiVirus Are you even on this planet? This uploader is highly respected for the work he does. I have used hundreds of his torrents and not once have I had a virus or anything. So take your envious head and flame filled mouth to another place as its not welcome here. 
CC thanks for this mate, well appreciated."
,waterbong,2011-03-24T01:19Z,Works great just follow the instructions.  Thx for the up!

,Cristaline2308,2011-04-01T21:02Z,"Have the same as 81support. Can't find ""anydvd.chk"". Please help ! =("
,mvictorinox,2011-04-05T13:54Z,"Thanks.

Also was quiet surprised to hear a favourite McKennitt track play.  Thought I had my music player on by accident."
,pirateb87,2011-04-09T14:10Z,sorry i do enjoy your other fine releases but this one dont work as it is the patch when you apply shows as an invalid licence
,pirateb87,2011-04-09T15:17Z,"ok fixed it first if you have not installed yet when you have downloaded this disconnect from the internet install dont restart and apply patch simple

If you have installed uninstall search anydvd on your pc hidden files aswell and slysoft search that delete all then reinstall and dont be connected to the internet this time fool lol"
,Pizzpott,2011-04-11T14:23Z,"As always, faultless. many thanks CC again."
,Androide323,2011-04-11T21:59Z,"The key is not working, can you put a new one please?"
,tideomega,2011-04-14T02:53Z,My first time and needing to know where to put in the key ?
,justatest90,2011-04-30T07:54Z,"Does anyone else run into the problem where it says:

AnyDVD requires to update a critical component to decrypt the disc 
""""
If you do not download the update, decryption will stop.

I'm getting this on Blu-Ray discs more and more often. Any tips?"
,halfmonkey,2011-05-01T12:03Z,justatest90 - This is where the Blu-ray disc you are attempting to crack has new encryption keys that this version of AnyDVD HD can't crack - We need a new update from Slysoft basically (not ChattChitto's fault).
,hattedone,2011-05-03T17:00Z,"Can you list the movies or benefit over installing this version over v 6.7.8.0?  Is there a list somewhere of what movies each version ads? 

I assume if you ever let it update itself to get a patch on a new movie (TRON LEGACY) for example that it's going to invalidate itself so you should never let it get patches?

This is one of those programs I will probably end up buying I hate all the annoying protection on blu rays and don't want to have to always play my original discs."
,Bruza005,2011-05-07T12:54Z,"hey folks, when i applied te key it says that it is not a registered version and that it is registeresd to XXX@gmail.com. 

I think the key might blocked somehow and i prob stuffed up the installation. Is there a fix as i have tried to uninstall /reinstall and no luck. 

I have had chattchitto working versions before so this is my bad. any help appreciated. "
,hattedone,2011-05-28T11:16Z,"Ok I getting the same (invalid license error) was stupidly looking in the main Program(x86) Slysoft directory and not in the Program Data directory for anydvd.chk

Enabled view hidden files from control panel (Win 7 64 bit ultimate) and sure enough the file was there. Deleted it and it worked... ran program and unchecked all update and phone home options.  Reconnected internet and all is working.

if you DO not disconnect internet it will automatically write another anydvd.chk file.

Have fiddled with the program and considering buying it but damn $177 and a lot of the newest blu-rays it is having trouble with.  Slysoft checks this site regularly so come on guys.. LOWER your damn price and get your thing up to date and more people will buy it. Consider pirate bay advertising.  "
,immapirateyay,2011-07-04T18:59Z,Works like a charm. Thank you very much ChatChitto!
