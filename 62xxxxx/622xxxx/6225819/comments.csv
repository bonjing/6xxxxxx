Thanks a lot for sharing your ÂŤunique-piece-of-artÂť work. We (your regulars) understand the time and love you put on your shares and that's what makes your gifts so appreciated...
Live long and Prosper Twentyforty."
,Fangular,2011-03-07T16:21Z,"I second the thanks for Being Human! 
I'm about to use the last of my download (until the 16th, when it gets renewed again), but I wouldn't be able to download this show at all if it weren't for you and your brilliant small files, 2040 - many, many thanks!"
,the_shroud,2011-03-07T16:21Z,Thx for Being Human UK & Californication
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-07T17:00Z,"@.ACHILLES: I have watched SNL with Miley. And show was incredibly bad (except first sketch) and I follow religiously SNL for last 9 seasons and can sustain Mrs. Cyrus for more than twenty minutes. Point being, I deleted the file after finished watching. Sorry."
,coolasad,2011-03-07T17:15Z,Thanks
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-07T17:42Z,"@Fangular: Let me know when your hiatus is over,  which shows you've missed or torrents are dead by then. I'll integrate (re-up) these episodes in packs to come."
,psipsina111,2011-03-07T18:05Z,"Thank you. The Event, Outcasts and Desperate housewives. My night is going to be in front of the laptop headphones on."
,punk67,2011-03-07T18:15Z,thanks 4 event being human family guy and simpsons twenty forty
,Fangular,2011-03-07T18:21Z,"2040 - thank you so much!! It's really amazing to me that someone on the other side of the world - someone I have never even met - is so generous and considerate. You know, you've really made a difference to my world - you've made a difference to quite a few people, in fact, as you can tell by the vast majority of comments you get. I've never seen an uploader with such a fiercely loyal following as yours - which is the very least that you deserve, mind you.

But on top of everything else, it just makes me happy to know that, however rare, people like you exist in the world. I had a crappy sort of day and your comment has cheered me up so much - not just what you said but what it represents.

So thank you! Thank you for existing, 2040.

Cheers,
Fangular"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-07T18:27Z,"Sorry for audio drop outs on Being Human, but it's has been aired without the sound at all on few places. Official RIVER 550 MB XviD has even longer dropouts and 1.46 GB hannibal have them too, in same manner and on same places."
