IMAGiNE NOTES:
Here we are with nice encode for you all.work done made a small script to brighten it up and alter the contrast....also changed the rgb colours and added some sharpeness.With the audio it was a pain to sync but we got there now it was just a case of muxing the audio back to our encode... more work done to it..... We had to cut the film up into 15 parts for where the camera movement was really bad. Then needed to use the perspective filter to be able to remove all the borders at different angles without losing any of the video (almost any anyway ). Then resize them all so they had the same res so it was possible to append all the files together. Now due to different amounts being removed the AR in parts might be a little off but at least you have the whole video,instead of just cropping the hell out of it. FYI great line overall it come out nice for a TS plus subs for non english parts .. Enjoy
