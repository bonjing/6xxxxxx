,Perhelion,2011-03-08T15:29Z,"Is anyone else having an issue where the game crashes before it even starts? When I switch the EXE back to the original, it asks me to activate my serial online or it won't launch. "
,Perhelion,2011-03-08T16:37Z,"How has anyone gotten past the online activation? Does the crack do that? If so, it's not working for me.

Anyone want to give details on how they installed it if the game is working for them? "

,knightman698,2011-03-08T20:36Z,When i click on it it says application has failed to start because physxcooking.dll was not found. what do i do?
,PlaidCactus,2011-03-08T22:10Z,Still not sure if legit....would feel better if uploader was VIP or trusted.
,midurix,2011-03-08T23:39Z,"@knightman698 AND FOR ANYONE ELSE WONDERING WHERE TO PUT THIS

When you have installed the game you need to put this crack in the following folder:

program files --> electronic arts --> Dragon Age 2 --> bin_ship

I had no idea where it went and got the same physxcooking.dll error, so all i did was search for that dll and put the crack in there, not rocket science! ha"
,greg723,2011-03-09T01:58Z,i downloaded this and extracted it but when i tried to run it this popped up..... d3dcompiler_43.dll was not found.... wat the hell? can anyone please help me
,fatgums,2011-03-09T11:22Z,@greg727 prolly you need to install directx. find the latest one.
,Lucky13s,2011-03-10T00:50Z,"This is not a fully working crack, there will need to be a crackfix. The game crashes at some points on some sidequests."
,ThongDaddy,2011-03-10T01:03Z,is there a way to fix the audio???
,nimodium,2011-03-10T06:09Z,"Is there a way i can download this without my utorrent giving me the message ""Error: Access is denied"" :("
,IndoctriNation,2011-03-10T19:46Z,"@nimodium:

You have probably clicked 'no' when uTorrent asked 'The uTorrent client has asked permission to uTorrent' (or something like that) and made uTorrent remember the answer. Best to turn off or uninstall Google Desktop's indexing feature."

,DeepSpace9,2011-03-14T20:14Z,I had installed the game on my girls computer then installed on mine but it asked for a new activation code. I was like WTF.  So you saved my azz for real and saved me bucks.  The crack works fccking awesome.
,jim1202,2011-03-15T11:05Z,"@lac_1508

People that have this problem: It crashes at the start screen, the box with dragon age 2 and the tribal sowrd on it.

I had this aswell, but i have found a way to fix it!
Go to your install folder off your dragon age 2, in my case 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Dragon Age 2\bin_ship

open up dragonage2config, go to video, render AND IT PROBABLY SAYS (directx11 if avaible), change it to dx9! bam it works thank me by sending me a pm :D 

Make sure you go to the tab above and click save settings( i dont know if he saves automaticly)"
,jim1202,2011-03-15T11:07Z,"@impulse89

Try the same as i told lac!:D"
,Xenus333,2011-03-20T14:21Z,"jim1202 thank you a hundred time, i was about to turn crazy, changed to direct x 9 and all is fine, may the gods of the internet smile upon you"
,tubby2010,2011-04-14T11:17Z,i tried it and it said i was missing some thing
,kaigen,2011-04-24T00:00Z,"^_^ YOU GUYS ROCK! Changed the DirectX to V9.0 and it started working. I haven't been through much and it's a little slow, but god am I happy to be through that black screen of death. "
,OhSoNinja,2012-01-10T21:06Z,"It keeps telling me ""The program can't start because phsyxcooking.dll is missing from your computer."" I've already downloaded physx and installed it so what do i do?"
,DasGaming,2012-05-02T02:40Z,"If you want to stop the lagging, freezing and crashing launch the game from the Windows Games menu."
