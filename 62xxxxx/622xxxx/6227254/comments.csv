,shayweis,2011-03-08T09:07Z,i cant belive those mother fuckers canceled this show!! its the best sci fi show around!
,uberman21,2011-03-08T09:58Z,"Thanks eztv

@shayweis - Amen - and if Fringe goes too then there's just nothing of quality left"
,francescdhir89,2011-03-08T10:55Z,wasted tis season is there last season...
,darkrose6,2011-03-08T13:50Z,"I enjoy SGU, but it doesn't compare to the other series SG-1 or Atlantis. The plot development is really slow, I'm hoping it picks up."
,darkrose6,2011-03-08T13:51Z,"Stargate Atlantis, now that's something worth finishing........."
,NaNaMoose,2011-03-08T14:04Z,"Cheers!

Caprica Is the Biggest Travesty! That Show Had Infinite Possibilities! The worse Part Is, They Stopped It Just When They Were About To Make That Connection To BSG That The ""Fair Weather"" Fans were Looking For. F*&K The F*&King Sci Fi Network! They Are The Worse Thing That Ever Happened To The Genre. Except for those God Awful Movies They Make..Maybe. Seems Like We Are Destined To Be Victims Of Corporate Culture In ALL Aspects Of Our Lives! *SHUDDER*"
,Chadly,2011-03-08T15:31Z,"They canceled Stargate Universe?? Why? I thought it was just as good or better then the other stargate shows. TV is going crazy with canceling shows lately. Soo many shows I think are good are gone now or going :( Better be replaced with better stuff, thats all I gotta say :)"
,sonaro,2011-03-08T19:17Z,"You guys realize this IS the reason why they are cancelling the show.  The ratings just aren't there because tech savy sci fi fans just come online and download it.  The network doesn't care how many people like the show, they care how much money they can make on advertising (ie commercials).

The 4 month gap mid season probably doesn't help much either."
,penetr8or,2011-03-08T21:06Z,"Well if they want people to watch it, then they need to make sure it airs in the countries where people want to watch it!
We have yet to see more than the first season of SGA here, and I doubt we'll see SGU for YEARS yet..

Downloading is the ONLY way for us to watch it!"
,Chadly,2011-03-08T22:16Z,"Sonaro is right. People need to watch the show when it airs. I watch it when it airs then download it cause I want to keep it for future entertainment. So come on people support your fav shows by watching them the day they air. If you cant be home when it airs, buy a dvr or pvr box whatever its called where you are and record the show. Recording the show counts the same on statistics as if you were watching it then and there. Call your service provider and get the DVR PVR today :)"
,NaNaMoose,2011-03-08T22:28Z,"@sonaro

Speaking for myself I always watch the shows I can For that very reason. Anyone with half a brain knows you have to Support the show to keep it on the air. I always watched sgu, caprica, etc. and only download if I miss it(like yest.) or if I can't get it where I am (like Doctor Who) It's not like movies or music. They don't get cancelled if you dload them & I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of that."
,LordReserei,2011-03-08T22:59Z,"Thanks for this!

Can always rely on eztv!


@sonaro 

I can't speak for everyone, but I myself watch a show when it airs and if I like the episode a lot - download it after to watch it again. 

For shows that aren't aired in the UK (or are aired later)...I do the reverse...download the episode and watch it again when it's aired in the UK. "
,xniggler,2011-03-09T00:52Z,"shayweis , you are fucking joking ...this is the worst sci fi show ever...only reason i watch it is to see the fx...."
,Veina,2011-03-09T01:10Z,"Caprica was a fail boring show, this has gonne in the same steps and i see why they canceled it. 
Ill watch this series till the end just to see how will they end it but so far pretty boring show."
,NaNaMoose,2011-03-09T02:38Z,"@veina

You're entitled to your opinion but perhaps someone with such a LIMITED Imagination is not best suited to the Sci-Fi genre."
,instantnet,2011-03-09T05:17Z,sonaro- This is true with any show. People are bombarded with signs and ads everywhere and are sick of it. I dont have cable so I cant get it. Perhaps they need to do more product placement like in chuck (subway) How else can they do it?  They could offer it pay per view but pay per view requires a cable subscription which is stupid.
,tictoc108,2011-03-09T07:52Z,"It would be not very nice, but, as they already put other shows calls inside the episodes, why not put other advertisements. We could get used to it, and then the show would be also *for* downloading, and they would just keep an eye on how many are getting it. My two cents..."
,axilleaszz,2011-03-09T09:53Z,thanks
,Pendaws,2011-03-09T14:07Z,Thanks EZTV
,znanost,2011-03-09T20:32Z,best series
,epdm2be,2011-03-09T20:52Z,"to penetr8or: I'm in the same situation as you. It takes over 3 years before we see these shows in my country. There are a few exceptions (hawai Five-O).

to LordReserei: I too watch them, even after I downloaded and seen it years before, when they're finally being shown in my country on TV. Problem is that by then most of these are already cancelled (in the US) and hence our opinion doesn't count at all. It so stupid that US-ratings don't take international intrest into account. The corps make billions of dollars years after they cancelled these show by selling them as to international TV-companies abroad.

As for MHO about this show. I think Atlantis was the best SG-franchise. But since this is a cross between SG and StarTrek (also cancelled) and since there's no space-themed sci-fi-show being made, I liked it. Now all we have are stupid cooking shows, stupid home rebuilding/improvement shows, stupid sing and dance contests and bimbo's going for the next topmodel. Yek."
,BencyHUN,2011-03-09T22:18Z,"Woah, there's no official information about the end of the show.
Only Syfy stated, that they willl not air the 3rd season. MGM is still mute."
,shayweis,2011-03-09T23:38Z,this show is too quality i guess for the general public that watches reality shows all the time.

The only good peaople here is eztv that has shared this to us sick pirates, and those who have seeded well after finish the DL. Enjoy.

thanks to eztv ! - peace -"
,plzseedthistorrent,2011-03-10T08:02Z,"I really like this show, and I hope MGM moves it to another channel or whatever they have to do to keep it going. I am not always around when it airs in my country, and I do not support i-tunes."
,udumbmuthas,2011-03-10T13:58Z,"It's stupid to think of downloading television shows as piracy, you don't pay to watch it anyways well if you watch it directly on sat or cable. I Just watch it on Hulu."
,grafkaal,2011-03-10T16:54Z,"They are hoping that people will pay for SGU on iTunes so they can recover some of the costs. Hasn't really caught on yet though! £2.49 per episode or £43.99 for Season pass. But iTunes is getting bigger and bigger, and with no carrier control on iPhone who knows.(Only a couple of quid less than the box set £49.99) But thanks Eztv, I will download then watch when aired also!"
,vegemiteguy,2011-03-10T22:12Z,thanks uploader and yes so many shows have bitten the dust only to have far inferior shows prevails for many seasons.
,pimpmobile,2011-03-11T05:10Z,"I can't believe this shitty show is still on and you losers that watch it are sad!  Atlantis was good sg1 was good, but this show is crap and the actors/writers for this piece of shit should be shot for incompetence! "

,eightyth_attempt2register,2011-03-13T03:31Z,"First, watching it only boosts the ratings if you've been selected as part of the Neilsen ratings group and you will know if you've been selected.  Second, watching it on itunes goes to the parent company of the show (or something like that) and does not affect the network itself, so the network doesn't take into account the itunes sales.  This is explained better than I can on the comments of the blog entries on the Gateworld website.  Google for the website as I don't know if posting a link will jack my post up as fucking abusive shit like CAPTCHAs and worse everywhere on this site, even when emailng the site for help."
,Quinthas,2011-03-15T06:10Z,"This was by far the best and most believable Stargate Show so IDK what Pimpmobilecocksucker is talking about.  They Cancel these shows cause so many retards watch reality tv and Dumb ass talent shows like Americal Idiot, I mean Idol(What a waste of life).
As far as savy ppl downloading the shows, Syfy should wisen up and replay the shows online instead of trying to hold out on people that get home late or missed an episode - they could include an online ad in the Ad package they sell comercials in."
