From Wikipedia:
Isle of Flowers (Portuguese: Ilha das Flores) is a 1989 Brazilian short 
film by Jorge Furtado. It tracks the path of a tomato from garden to dump 
with the help of a monotone voiceover and a collection of bizarre images. 

While a very humorous film, the message it delivers about how human beings 
treat each other is anything but such. The director himself has stated that 
the film was inspired by the works of Kurt Vonnegut and Alain Resnais,
among others.
