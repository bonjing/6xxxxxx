The fourth album in the Twilight Sessions series. 
Like the previous four releases in this series, this is a collection of improvised live recordings. 
In places, very ambient: long, drawn out pieces that evolve slowly, creating quite an emotive and evocative sound. Each piece starts as a blank canvas with no preconceived notion of where the music will go. Notes and noises are played from synths, guitar, voice, clarinet and samples and fed into one or two loops which repeat and layer and decay. These loops can be quite long, so as a performer I can add notes as I see fit, but only have a certain amount of control over what is heard - the rest is serendipity. 
This time, the whole album was recorded in one week in November 2010, with each recording around an hour long. 
I hope you enjoy this album as much as I enjoyed making it. Rest assured, another one will follow soon enough!
