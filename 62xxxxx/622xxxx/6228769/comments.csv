,gerdsperd,2011-03-09T05:15Z,"How does one SYNC the subtitles to the movie?  I was able to add the subtitles with Submerge, but they were not at all synchronized.  What is the trick to sync the subs to the movie?"
,GLOatPB,2011-03-25T04:13Z,@gerdsperd: Make sure the title of the subs is exactly the same as the title of the movie. You can make this happen by cut-and-paste. Note: this only works with .srt-files
,ptprof08,2011-06-14T14:00Z,Very GOOD movie. Copy is very good too. Worth the wait of download. Subtitle is as good as the film.

,oniscoid,2011-07-30T04:03Z,"@gerdsperd

use Subtitle Processor to edit the srt file (change start time, change speed, skew etc)
