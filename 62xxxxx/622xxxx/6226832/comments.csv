,scyris99,2011-03-08T09:47Z,"Honestly, Norton says its own files are a virus probally, that program same with McAffe generates tons of false positives so you THINK its really doing anything. In reality, you can get a virus past norton/mcaffe easier than any other anti-virus. One of the pains of being 2 of the top known and most cracked brands."
