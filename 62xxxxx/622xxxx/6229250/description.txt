		Crysis 2 - Build 5620 Benchmark Addon + Optional CFGs v3

================================================================================

Changes v3: - Added autoexec.cfg with AI improvements, FOV set to 60
                   - Removed fixed resolution
                   - Memory usage improvements
                   - Further optimized shaders
                   - Removed useless FPS eating LOD & View Distance settings

Changes v2: - Fixed black screen issue where mission would
                     not load after cutscene - net_lanbrowser (system.cfg)
                  
                   - Shader Optimization + Increased Shader Threads

                   - Included Precompiled Shaders (all SP + MP maps)


Required - Crysis 2 (5620) developer leak


Provided - Benchmarks Addon

             - Cleaned up Bin32 dir (AI fix & no protect included)

             - Modified Engine.pak for Benchmarks Addon support

             - Optional cfg files (tested on GeForce GTX 275)


Installation - Delete the original "Bin32" dir & replace with the provided one
               
	  - Copy the provided Engine.pak, replacing the original
                
                - For improved AI run the "DisableAIDevMode.reg" and use the provided "autoexec.cfg".
               
	  - If using Optional CFGs, copy & replace the Shaders dir located in
                 "C:\Users\YourName\Saved Games\Crysis2" with the provided one (extract zip archive first)
       
NOTE: THIS WILL ELIMINATE ANY STUTTERING/FREQUENT HDD SEEK PROVIDING SMOOTH GAMEPLAY
                   SINCE SHADERS ARE NOW ALL PRECOMPILED (ONLY USE WITH PROVIDED CFGs)


Optional - Copy the provided cfg files, replace "system.cfg"

             - These cfg files have been adjusted for maximum possible quality
               and performance, inside are descriptions of most CVARS.

             - Realistic HDR, Global Illumination, Shadow fixes, Shader Optimization &
               NO Texture Streaming, are only some of the modifications included in the cfg.

             - Multiplayer LAN workaround is also included (use Tunngle/Hamachi)


Description - Basically this addon allows you to benchmark Crysis 2 performance on your machine.
                   In the "Benchmarks" dir, there are 4 CPU Benchmarks & 4 GPU Benchmarks included.
                   The optional cfgs provided have been extensively tested on a GeForce GTX 275


NOTE: If you are planning on running Crysis 2 (5620) in 64bit (Bin64), best forget about it.
          The 64bit executable has sound issues, AI issues and countless other problems.

Though the 4th level of quality is not FULLY implemented in the leak, the provided CFGs will force VeryHighSpec. 
           
           The only differences between HighSpec & VeryHighSpec are:
           -polygon count (tris)
           -higher quality particles
           -shader calculation changes (only visible through debug)


THIS ADDON DOES NOT ADD OR ENABLE DX11 SUPPORT. IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE LEAK


ENJOY :)
