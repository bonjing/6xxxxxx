GREAT JOB! Makes the BETA fully playable...but a few issues remain on my system...

SPECS
=====

Gigabyte GA-790FXTA-UD5 Mainboard
Phenom BE X4 965 3.4GHz
Radeon 5970 (main)
Geforce GTX 285 (PhysX)
8192MB DDR3 Crucial Ballistix Tracer
SAMSUNG SSD 32GB (boot) - Win 7 x64 ULT.
WD Velociraptor 300GB x2 (apps / games1)
WD Scorpio Blue 500GB (games2/emus/stuff)

I'm running the 32-bit version renamed to ""rift.exe"" to avoid flicker in fullscreen with crossfire (ATI app. profiles fix)

On ""Second Chance"" level - 

The water in the harbour has triangles ""sticking out"" of the top of it in the distance (it's fine close-up)

Also on one of the later levels when you are on FDR - you look at the water and it's not there (orange fog) - then it ""pops"" back in like it was always there?!?!

All levels - shadows for items from the floor above are also rendered on the current floor surface.

If these can be fixed with .CFG and shader hacks - then I wish you best of luck!

Top stuff @Trigguh!"
