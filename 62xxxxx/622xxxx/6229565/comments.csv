,narpet,2011-03-10T09:09Z,"Sorry for the slow torrent, I'm using a dedicated computer just for uploads with BitTorrent 7.2 and it still shows max of 60Kbs even after setting my max to unlimited. Wish I could just push these files to some seeders ftp's to help with distribution. If anyone is interested I could put them thru Giganews bulletin board sites like alt.binaries.bootleg.... any thoughts? I do have a few non released movies which were acquired during some South American climbs. Thx"
