You're stupid fool!Get yourself a decent IS instead of McAfee first.Second, it's a FP because of keygen and your McAf..k went crazy and third but not less important-download WinRAR somewhere else then and do not be a troll."
,TechGeek2,2011-04-19T18:02Z,Listen some of you. Anytime you download a torrent which contains a keygen or other hacking tool your anti-virus and/or malware scanner will detect the same as malware since it is a hack. It is a false positive. You should know these things before you begin to download torrents and make negative comments about the upload. Nakita200's uploads are perfect. Great job Nakita200. Thanks! Please keep it up!
