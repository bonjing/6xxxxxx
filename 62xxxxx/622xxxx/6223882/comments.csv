,Rj408,2011-03-07T15:39Z,"Hey thanks for the hard work, I always download your stuff! 

I'd like to make a suggestion for your consideration if I may. Have you ever thought of adding a 'new' folder into the torrent? Making it easier for people to load all the 'new' stuff onto their ipods? I think that would be awesome! "
