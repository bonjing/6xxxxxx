*Note 1: Only inclusin not all in 320, its a demo, so really not needed, this is 
         best available.

**Note 2: While this isn't exactly a Rammstein release, it features Till and the 
          lead guitarist of Rammstein (Krupse) on the title track, and sound very 
          similar to Rammstein, although they are more on the rock side than 
          metal. Also, this band has been around since 1969.
