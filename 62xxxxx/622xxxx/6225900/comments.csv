,iamcims,2011-07-05T03:46Z,Why did you not mention this is in russian uploader? When you load the torrent it clearly reveals this in the name.

Use MKVToolnix, deselect the Russian audio, remux as a new file, should be a bit smaller than the original.

If the file refuses to play on a home HD media player, then in MKVToolnix, go to options, and tick the box 'Disable header removal compression...'. Remux the file again (original file or the new 'english only' file)."
,Vicar in a Tutu,2011-08-29T12:27Z,"...oh and just for the peeps that don't know, MKVToolnix does not re-encode the file. So:

1. it will take minutes to edit an mkv rather than hours.
2. no loss of detail, compression etc. it just strips out the video and audio and 'muxes' them into a new file (unchanged)."
