It is important. Everyone should try this release.
With these release from me ""Igor LinuxFun"" every Fat PS2 User can enjoy ""Linux Kit"" with no need to swap discs.
Actually if you search for torrent--type in google ""PlayStation 2 Linux Kit United"".
Official name for this release is:
""PlayStation 2 Linux Kit United by Igor LinuxFun"".
Remember ""No More Swapping"".
Linux Kit is merged---It had to be this way from the very beginning. But now everything is restored to its order.
Enjoy... But please do not forget to seed. Care about one another..."
