     Brian L. Weiss, author of "Many Lives Many Masters," "Same Soul Different Bodies" and other books that explore the phenomena of past life regression has just released three meditation (hypnosis) audio cds to help people remember past life experiences.

     I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading his first book before you jump into these sessions.

Contents:

Regression Through the Mirrors of Time - two 20 minute tracks

Regression to Times and Places - two 20 minute tracks

Spiritual Progress Through Regression - two 30 minute tracks

These audio files were ripped directly from the retail discs translated to FLAC and encoded to 320kb mp3s. NO RE-ENCODING after that. If you are interested in the FLAC versions of these cds let me know.

READ HIS BOOKS, especially if you are skeptical about reincarnation. You may not experience anything the first few times you do this. Sometimes it takes practice, sometimes months of practice. READ HIS BOOKS.
