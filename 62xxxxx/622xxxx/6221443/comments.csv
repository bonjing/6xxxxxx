,Illanair,2011-03-05T17:43Z,Anonymous uploading a leak - I smell a rat.
,Cybercharger,2011-03-05T17:47Z,"Well it says CLONEDVD, so no crack."
,thority,2011-03-05T17:49Z,"Unfortunately.

3. Czekaj na cracka!
CZEKAJ NA CRACKA! 

means ""wait for a crack"" in polish."
,lilwoodenboy,2011-03-05T17:57Z,looks fake to me. 
,zack0905,2011-03-05T18:05Z,no i think no crack
,exaulted,2011-03-05T18:23Z,"Looks real, but whats the difference... This a CloneDVD-P2P. It means there is no crack included. It means you cannot play, you will have to wait for the crack, and who knows when that will be released. Better to wait for the full scene release. Patience is better."
,Zukin,2011-03-05T18:25Z,"Ok so like the other one, a good one, we just have to wait for the crack "
,CaptainProton,2011-03-05T21:26Z,"I want the crack now! I don't understand why it takes several days, isn't it quite a routine procedure for them to make a crack? skidrow is so lame..."
,bajeezus,2011-03-05T21:58Z,"A trusted, anonymous uploader? What?"
,janxp,2011-03-05T22:29Z,"CaptainProton:

Why don't you take those words, shove em' up the place where the sun dont shine and get the f*** outa here. We are ALL WAITING, none of us are complaining, and furthermore SKIDROW has done more to the community the you could do over 7 lifetimes. So please just STFU and keep your  clean."
,Atkecar,2011-03-05T23:20Z,"janxp:
I agree...!!!"
,Grimfate,2011-03-06T02:29Z,"@ Captain

Your a grade A doucher... Funny thing is you will still get your crack.. you will still get a game without paying a dime... Who will make it possible? Skidrow. Your just lucky being a pirate means we dont discriminate because you would be the first on my ban list."
,mpayne69,2011-03-06T05:03Z,Has anyone tried to use the Dragon Age 2 demo exe?
,fangnfx,2011-03-06T05:26Z,"@mpayne69

I tried that and the .exe it just crashes."
,nota369,2011-03-06T07:02Z,this isn't multi7 
,Hagec,2011-03-06T08:59Z,"to Captain : I hate people like u , always complaining about something .....you shithead .....have u ever tried to make ur own crack ????  have u any idea how difficult it is to make a working crack ?yeah it is normal that skidrow release game with crack.....but maybe u didnt notice that this ISNT skidrow release ..."
,Nuno1976,2011-03-06T13:50Z,"@ captainProton

what a fucktard"
,Krobon,2011-03-06T17:51Z,"I agree on certain levels however, I always enjoyed the fact that there were games I could play before they came out, if they don't come out till after the release I might aswell just buy the digital download version."
,Krobon,2011-03-06T17:52Z,"If the crack isn't out before the release date then the crack is worthless to me, in the instance of this game in any case. I already pre ordered a month ago."
,regentas,2011-03-06T19:52Z,"EA has dealt with skidrow :( he was a good man, but still got taken down ;*( .Just joking dudes he probably forgot to pay the website rent :P"
,ErunamoCZ,2011-03-06T20:00Z,"Skidrow pages are offline again? That is strange, second time in last 24 hours... EA hitsquad probably found Skidrow's lair :D"
,nick.nider,2011-03-06T22:07Z,"it is written that the page has been closed because of illegal material by EA---
he ll just have to make an another one :p"
,oohhleo,2011-03-06T22:53Z,"@CaptainProton SH1THEAD!
WHY don't you make a crack if it's such a routine procedure?! Do you even have any idea what a crack is? What it takes to make a crack?
Thoughtless m0r0n!!!

And for @Krobon
Why don't you just get the h3ll out of here?!

I don't get it... What is wrong with people like the two of you? Inbreeding? F*ckbreedin? "
,cloudgodd,2011-03-06T23:50Z,"@nick.nider

where does it say that?

my guess is the server probably got to busy w/ all the f5 pushing and they shut it down for a bit."

It's the result of the letting dumb asses breed and the end result... more dumb asses!  


Please adopt the one child law and take a test... if they fail then fix em!"

What's wrong is people like you whom think that your opinion is the only correct one and think it's your god given duty to tell others what to do and say, I've given my say about the matter, if you don't like it then that's opinion."
,RhymesMatter,2011-03-07T21:49Z,Skidrow is the team with probably the biggest ballz in the Internet...Not a chance in a million years that nabs from EA or Ubisoft or any other Company could stop them or many other teams for the record...As long as Internet Exists piracy will exist.Even if The Skid Rowdies stop one day another team will take their place..
,mekushion,2011-03-07T23:06Z,"Should we expect a crack by our beloved Skidrow tomorrow then do you reckon? Or do you think it'll take a few days? Any ideas where the crack will be tomorrow if it is out too, skidrowcrack.co.uk? (just thought it might be difficult to get through the trillion of fake ones)"

,marcusfenix919,2011-03-09T09:17Z,"I'm pretty sure this is the one I downloaded.  Has anyone else?  I can't find an ISO for the life of me.  I extracted the .rar and all I get is the contents of the iso.  Nothing to mount.  I can install with serial, but it installs 2.00GB of I don't know what and I'm just really lost.  "
