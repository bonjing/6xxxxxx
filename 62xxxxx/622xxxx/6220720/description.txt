I did not rip this torrent myself. Since this one is very hard to find, I decided to upload it to share it with Steve Miller Band fans. It has been ripped from vinyl by an unknown person in FLAC format. I listened to it on a good stereo set, NAD amplifier and Tannoy D500 loudspeakers, and the quality is good, although a digital remastering would be a better thing. 

There is a CD on the market ( supplied from Germany, manufactured in Argentina ) but reviews say the CD quality is flat and poor.

Since this recording dates from 1972, the quality is not what you might expect from a modern digitally remastered version. Still, it is very acceptable and I hope you will enjoy it. Please let me know what you think of it.

Sincere thanks to the original unknown uploader.
