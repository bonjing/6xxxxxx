2 Meter Sessions: A legendary archive of music sessions. Songs in different renditions. From a single guitar and a small or acoustic version to complete bands that go full throttle with an electric set. Weâ€™ve recorded them all.



The 2 Meter Sessions were founded in 1987 by Dutch TV- and radio host Jan Douwe Kroeske, when we recorded the first 2 Meter Session with New-Zealanders Crowded House. Since then, the archive has grown into a amazing total of 1460 sessions. Ranging from bands of different genre, age and fame. To give you an idea, weâ€™ve recorded from Nirvana to Eels. With Radiohead, Low Anthem, dEUS and Yeasayer in between. Weâ€™ve met up with Joe Cocker, Aerosmith, JJ Cale, James Taylor and Jackson Browne. We werenâ€™t even too shy to record with Sepultura and Tool. In short: Weâ€™re willing to record anything that we consider to be true and good music. Our most recent recording was with Alberta Cross by the way, our next recording will be with Ed Harcourt.



We have several friends with professional studios in Amsterdam where we record these 2 Meter Sessions for television and radio. Weâ€™ll broadcast them along the way at Hollandsâ€™ alternative radio station KinkFM. Where Jan Douwe, or â€˜JDâ€™, has two shows: 2 Meter into the Air every day from 7:00 â€“ 9:00 Dutch time, and 2 Meter Live, every thursday night from 22:00 â€™till midnight Dutch time. Donâ€™t mind the language, youâ€™ll understand the music. You can listen to the station at any time and place. Thatâ€™s online with iTunes at www.kinkfm.com.



Also, weâ€™ve had two seasons of 2 Meter Sessions: The Conversation. A talkshow with guests from the world of music who gets to pick three songs out of the archive, talks about the fragments and additionally plays a 2 Meter Session in the TV studio.
