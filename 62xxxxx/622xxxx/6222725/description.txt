Subrahmanyam aka Subbu (Allari Naresh) is a software engineer, who was brought up by his maternal uncle (Ahuti Prasad), a doctor. He searches for an alliance to his innocent nephew but could not get a suitable girl. However, Subbu has a soft corner towards his colleague Madhu (Anita) and secretly loves her. But Madhu is fond of rich living. Subbu works in a firm managed by Busy Balaraj (Brahmanandam). Once Balaraj throws a party and Subbu gets drunk. By the time he wakes up, he finds a Sanjana (Ritu Barmecha) by his side in his house. Sanjanaâ€™s elder brother Durga (Srihari) and two other brother (Subbaraju and Samrat) thrash Subbu and force him to marry their sister alleging that Subbu is in love with their sister. They invite Subbu to meet their father JJ (Nagineedu). Being intelligent, Subbu gets the video CD of the CC camera in the bar and finds that the three brothers played the drama and arranged all this. At this juncture, Madhu tells Sanjana that Subbu did not love her and is favouring her. Sanjana in turn tells her brothers that they can threaten Subbu and get married to her but it is absurd to marry someone who doesnâ€™t love her. Meanwhile, love guru (Vennela Kishore) enters the scene. What happens next should be seen on-screen.
