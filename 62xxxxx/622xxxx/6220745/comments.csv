   * No limit on the total number of PCs you can install the game on.

   * There is a limit to the number of unique/different PCs that can play the game within a time window (if online) [5 PCs in 24hrs].

   * After each new install there is a 1-time online check needed the next time you play, requiring a log in to your EA account to verify game ownership.  If you are a member of these forums, you already have an EA account â€“ just use the same email/password.

   * You can play offline thereafter - the game will NOT require any subsequent login checks.  If online, a game ownership check happens each time you play."""

I like variety. This is a different kind of RPG. If you want a heavy RPG game that's not as fast paced, check out Mass Effect. Hell, play some KoToR. Dragon Age 2 is just like Splinter Cell: Conviction is to me. It's a different kind of game with similarities to it's previous titles."

Which is precisely why they'll be able to bypass it when they get their hands on a decrypted version of the files....

Why can't we bypass it right now? because the files are encrypted, what happens when someone gets the decrypted files? they begin working on cracking the other protections there and release it... you replace your encrypted files with the cracked decrypted ones and.... wallah you can play the game.... just relax guys.

1- of course because the story is shorter but also..

,Isti01,2011-03-07T16:49Z,"@dballaz
It depends on how many files are encrypted. If only a few then they will be uploaded as a crack and it will work, but if half of the game is encrypted and it's impossible to upload the decrypted US game files to us europeans then yes, we'll have to wait. This is only how I think it is though.. nothing of what I say is fact lol "

You know how long it'd take to download half the game and decrypt 3 GBs of Data? yup you guessed right, it'd take too long.

The only encrypted file(s) would be the DragonAge2.exe if I have to guess, the decrypted version would just have SoildShield protection like DS2 which is already cracked by groups like FLT and Skidrow... also this is an illegitimate copy of the game, do you think it'd unlock even if you tried at said date?

All I'm saying is... the release date check won't matter if the game is cracked, the crack won't tell the difference between a EU or a US version."

,LadyZubat,2011-03-07T17:37Z,"You guys are idiots. Stop guessing what DRM the game has when you have no idea that it's just a cd key check and a release date check. IT HAS NO DISC PROTECTION WHATSOEVER. No it's not anything to do with EA, are you so fucking blind blaming ea for everything? DAO had the same thing apart from the release date check. I quote directly from BW forums.
""Dragon Age 2 Physical & Digital PC/Mac DRM are as follows:

    * No disc check, you do not need the disc in drive to play.

    * No limit on the total number of PCs you can install the game on.

    * There is a limit to the number of unique/different PCs that can play the game within a time window (if online) [5 PCs in 24hrs].

    * After each new install there is a 1-time online check needed the next time you play, requiring a log in to your EA account to verify game ownership.  If you are a member of these forums, you already have an EA account â€“ just use the same email/password.

    * You can play offline thereafter - the game will NOT require any subsequent login checks.  If online, a game ownership check happens each time you play.""

Oh for the sake of bacon. It is this sort of doom and gloom naysaying that depresses the heck out of me. ""Oh, I don't really understand how things work in the industry, but 7GB is less than previous, so it must be bad."" 

I shall try to explain in 3 main points why Dragon Age II is 7 GB.

1 - We used a different compression scheme in DA II than DAO (something called ""ogg"" I am told).
2 - 2 less fully VOed langauages
3 - Optimized mesh data, physics and lighting (which I am told reduces the footprint of environments by close to 75%)

I know some will still doom and gloom, but the game is 7GB because we are better at making games. So, now that you have some reasons why the game is 7GB I hope this will calm some of you down.


That is what they said in a thread on the forums. Anyways you all know that half of origins was nothin but filler and padded its numbers. In the Fade and Deeproads were taken out, the game would be twice as small and the game would be just as good."

Most people know that cd key checks are routine and have been quickly and easily defeated in the past. Most already understand that DA2 uses a release date check. I think the confusion comes from the fact that most people do not understand why a date check cannot be defeated before the trigger date. There are gaps in our knowledge. Can you shed some light on this?"

That doesn't really make me a troll does it?"
,LadyZubat,2011-03-07T18:39Z,"Ok, so people are asking how can they not crack this oh simple release date check! Well, it's pretty clever I should say, You see, there is a .exe to actually run the game (most games are run in a similar fashion *duh*) When cracking the game, crackers (let's put it simply) edit the .exe and bypass or remove the protection it holds. (note sometimes there are other files involved but that depends on the game and dmr). So basically what is stopping the crackers from doing this is that they do not have a valid and correct .exe file. It is (putting this simply) just a piece of code, which in this very unfortunate case, requires decoding and decrypting to function. The decrypting will ensue when the game is unlocked, everyone putting in a cd key (legit one) and passing the release date check will be able to update the .exe (decrypt it so it could be functional). But well, apparently the game already got unlocked in some parts of Asia, so I suppose soon we will get a crack, if there are no surprises in hand."

@others

It kinda had to be a smaller filesize, for some of the reasons others have mentioned, but also, in DAO, there were many more story intros. Not only human male/female and all their story intros depending on whether you chose warrior, mage or rogue, but also for elf and dwarf as well.

DA II, of course, only has the story lines for human."

Evil was lucky, he registered that key to his account before anyone else did. Each key is allowed to be activated on one account only, if he shared his EA account we could install it on unlimited amounts of PC's however only 5 would be able to play at a time if their online.

In other words, his key is useless for activation now.

The game will be unlocked on 00.00 PST most likely. In GMT that translates to 8.00am (8 in the morning). Now add (or subtract)  to that a few hours (depending on where you live) and you get the time that the game will unlock.

Ah, yeah that makes sense. I shouldn't be giving advice on a torrent i never downloaded in the first place, lol. So basically you guys just had to run the setup, then copy over the rest of the files from the torrent manually? Seems easy enough.

And you're right, i did download the MDX torrent... just had to run the setup.exe to install it. My folders looked like this:

Just tried that after cleaning the registry of DA2 demo's traces and it still does the same thing.

3.Inside the 'DISK1' folder double click the 'AutoRun.exe' to begin the install. Be sure to click Standard install or else you will get an error message. After it's finished it will add an 'Electronic Arts' folder into C:/Program Files with two folders. Don't worry about the small size.

4. Now download the crack found here ,

Hmm, did you overwrite the crack last? Make sure you do, also, i believe you have to rename the date bypass file from DragonAge2_0.exe to just DragonAge2.exe - then overwrite... try the game, see if it bypasses date check and goes right to the key check. Then install the Crack over that file and try to play.

@SlazsH

Yeah, it hits my FPS hard, too... and i have a decent card: GTX 460 1MB. Try enabling the hirez textures and DirectX 11 again, but play around with some setting like try 'high' textures in the other texture option instead of very high, also, mess around with the anisotropic and anti aliasing seem to have a huge impact on FPS as well.. so toggle those. I managed to keep the DirectX 11 and Hi-Rez textures with about 25fps average. Not super great, but definitely playable."

,fiftynine,2011-03-08T12:12Z,"just a few clarifications for those who are having problems. i run XP, so this may not work for Vista/7. 

First, FOLLOW install instructions, namely:

1) Extract setup files
2) Run ./ _Installer/DISK1/Autorun.exe and install the game

install it! not doing so *might* not allow you to save the game. (more clarification needed)

you have to install it on the default (C>Program Files). trying to install it on a different partition will give you an error code 2324 or something like that. it will require less than 8mb.

this will give you a ""Dragon Age 2"" folder in your program files. it contains ""docs"" folder and nothing else, which is PERFECTLY FINE! that's only the game register, if you will. the game is installed pretty much wherever you unpacked the rars in the first place.

for example, if you unrar this torrent in ""D:"". you'll get bin_ship, data, packages, and whatnot folders. go to ""installer"", and run autorun.exe and install in default ""C:"" drive (requires less than 1mb). once that's done, go back to ""D:"" and copy over crack. use THAT cracked exe to play the game. right click on it and send to desktop or whatever.

as for the graphics, XP users are stuck on medium (haven't tried the high-res patch yet). 

for importing DAO saved games, it's in-game. wait until the character creation screen. you'll have the option there.

if voices are silent but every other sound is fine, go to audio settings and tick the ""Force Stereo"" option, then restart the game."

,Felgard,2011-03-08T13:12Z,"well I've played some now and i can save i get sound and right now I'm climbing mountains with a babbling elf.

when i tried to install the game by using auto start in ./__install regardless of what i chose i got a error code 2324 (custom or default).

i also checked ""Program Files, Program Files (x86) and ProgramData"" to see if any folders with dragon in them had been made and found non.

so i believe its enough to copy the game to where you want it crack it (%game%/bin_ship) and play it. 

if you cant save try using the ""%game%/bin_ship/DragonAge2Config.exe"" that might be why i can save.

don't forget to save the settings before you exit the config tool."

Yes, i imported my DAO save into DA2. You can import any save from DAO, even unfinished games or a game from a DLC like Awakenings(which is what i did).

@Koga131

No problems saving my game so far. Evreything has ran smoothly - of course, i didn't use this install, i used the MDX one that was removed for some reason.

@ascorius

Then somethings definitely wrong. The graphics in this game are amazing, even the skin textures on the characters have been drastically improved.

@fuzionaddict46

Not much difference to be honest. I played on both settings but had to go back to 'high graphics' as the fps rate was dipping too much. There's really not a *huge* difference from high to very high, apart from the ground looking more contoured and other things like buildings and stuff looking more realistic. I'm still running on DX11, though, and still using the hi-rez texture pack... i just set the other graphic settings to high, not very high(makes a huge difference in frame rate).

@denaron

Exactly. Just as i mentioned above... i can play with the hi-rez texture pack, and can use DX11, but i cant set the game graphics higher than 'high', or the frame rate just plummets. Not even sure why, either as there's not a huge noticeable difference in graphics on the 'very high' settings.

@KMYash

You should be able to adjust the settings in Character Creation as soon as you leave the default character, ie; go to one of the presets. After doing that, you should be able to scroll down and adjust the other options... i recall when i was at that point it was a bit confusing at first.

BTW, i'm fairly certain when you alter your character, it also automatically alters your sister's character in game... because i played with the default character, and with a custom character, and the sister, Bethany's, appearance changed, too. Even her clothes changed.

This game will not run correctly on a single core processor.

You will be able to play fine (as well as your single core usually lets you play), But you will be unable to save/load/autosave and you will often be caught in endless loading screens.

Your only option for playing this game if you have a single core is to leave your computer on 247 and hope you don't get caught in an endless loading screen on your way to the end of the game.

 But when it comes to fights,cooldowns, talents. they really fucked up.
As Tank, no real appealing abilitys, no AoE Taunt, and its impossible to keep aggro on 13+ mobs in this game.
And as for Heal...  60 sec CD Healspell. And there is only 1 heal. and u have a Potion cooldown also, 
They have turned the best singleplayer group fight game genre into a booring DPS race.

,fiftynine,2011-03-09T07:59Z,"@IlisavD
extracting one rar file automatically extracts everything. for instance, right click on the first file and select ""Extract here"", and that should do it. it'll give you lots of folders. run ""autorun.exe"" deep within the ""Installer"" folder, then just copy a crack (downloaded somewhere else) over the exe file on the bin_ship folder. some have run the game without installing, so you can just crack it and play. hope this helps.

yes but mobs always comes in waves later on in the game, and a 20 sec cooldown is just retarded. 
for me it kinda feel that the feeling is gone

its fun and all but its all just run in a town story mode, with same textures on ""dungeons""
no adventure at all.

1.  Everyone who has Nvidia cards definitely upgrade your Nvidia drivers to 267.24 Beta.  Even without the texture packs the game was f-d up.

2. Game is kinda of slow to start.  Not sure if I like it better than the old.  It definitely looks better just hope it gets more interesting."
,fiftynine,2011-03-09T08:31Z,"@yoognr1
i actually agree. in fact i didn't get taunt until level 10. i prioritized AoE abilities instead to deal with waves. and ditto on the dungeons. still, i wouldn't count this out. i'm out of the town now and i'm hoping it gets interesting from here on. seems that while battles seemed to be faster, area progression is so much slower."

I cant find anywhere to select a different voice for my character ( he sounds like a fag) and the fighting/story is cool/good. But the speech choices with there little symbols, and the skill building/armor is just way to simple. I read afew comments about how it was simplified but fuck me, are you serious!!!. Bring back Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinternights days, where you had to put some thought into it lol. Im playing Dragon Age 2 and thinking about Dragon Age.

Too much is different, The armor and weapons system is boring, it doesn't have a compelling story like the first, and, you are right, they dumbed down the gameplay.

So they can sell it to a broader audience.  Previous Bioware games (Including DAO) was made for PC and hyped to be Baldur's Gate's 'spiritual successor'.  This dumbed-downed game was made for the console gamers...not us.  (Bet you EA had some part in that decision making processs...thanks for letting the publisher fuck your quality product Bioware)

Although I'm grateful to all the folks who helped the share this game, it's is a rainbow colored  turd.  It's pretty to look at (graphics are somewhat nice) but once you get into it...welll it's just shit, isn't it?

However, to answer your question to hopefully abate the same one for at least this page, you need to place the crack in the bin_ship folder to WHERE YOU ORIGINALLY EXTRACTED the Electronic Arts (NOT the install location) folder and use the DragonAge2Launcher application to start the game from there. 

On that note, however, is there anything in the works to get around this? Having about 10gb used up instead of only about 5 is just a slight annoyance. :3"

- DX 9 and DX 11, both work fine with great FPS and graphics before the freeze.
- Messing with Vsync and full screen.
- Toggling auto-save off and verifying core affinity (despite the fact that I have a quad core processor).
- Running in compatibility mode for previous versions of Windows (I have Windows 7 64 bit ultimate).
- Reinstalling drivers; I have the latest Nvidia betas.
- Reinstalling the game; I have checked this torrent and one other to make sure it wasn't an issue with this torrent.

,MrTTAO,2011-04-02T18:20Z,"This is NOT A CLONEDVD!
it isn't even a disk image, much less a perfect copy including subchanel emulation. This is rars containing a directory which contains the installation files.

Sure you can burn it to a disk, and you can use it to install, and has no crack... but when someone says CLONEDVD I expect a perfect 1:1 clone copy of the DVD, not a pile of files... Should have just left it as an ISO."
