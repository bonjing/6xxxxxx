TruSurround XT is the second generation of SRS TruSurround. Building upon its patented predecessor and namesake, TruSurround XT not only solves the problem of playing 5.1 or 6.1 multichannel content over two speakers or headphones, but also utilizes proprietary algorithms from SRS Labs - Dialog Clarity and TruBass - to provide listeners with a truly immersive audio experience.

TruSurround XT accepts input from up to a 7 channel (6.1) audio source and processing a 2 channel output. When receiving multichannel content, TruSurround XT virtualizes the channels, creating "phantom" speakers that appear to extend all around the listener, producing an amazing surround sound effect. When receiving mono or stereo content, TruSurround XT includes the functionality of SRS WOW to present an expansive three dimensional sound field.

:: Tweak Pack for PowerDVD 10 ::
================================

Blu-Ray_Region_Reset.bat:         Resets the Blu-Ray region settings

*    CLFLVSplitter.ax can cause a crash when you play flv videos in Windows Media
     Player. Disable_CLFLVSplitter.bat unregisters the FLV Splitter, which fixes
     the problem

**   This comes in handy if you selected "Don't ask me this question again" and 
     want to re-enable or disable TrueTheater Lightning and Smart De-interlace
     when playing High-Definition content

***  Enables/Disables BDRegion and RemoteControl10 from running at startup.
     Don't disable them if you're planning to use a remote to control PowerDVD!


I've fixed the Black Skin and the tweak batch files, they now work in 64-bit versions of Windows.
