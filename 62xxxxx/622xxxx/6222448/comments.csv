[V],HobbitGamez,2011-03-06T04:36Z,"Wii Sports Resort is one of a few games for the Wii developed thus far that requires an alternate ""dol"" file at initial boot-up (it wants you to watch an instructional video on Wii Motion Plus). If you have the latest version of your usb loader (I use USB Loader GX) you will not have to download any additional files to get this to work, simply tell it to load the alternate dol already located in the game. To do this with the latest version of USB Loader GX, follow these steps:

1. Open USB Loader GX as usual
2. Click on the Wii Sports Resort game
3. Go to settings
4. Go to ""Game Load""
5. Scroll down to ""Alternate DOL"" and click it once
6. Go to the next option ""Select DOL Offset"" and click it
7. When it asks you if you wish to use the alternate DOL that is known to be correct, select yes
8. Go out of the settings and load the game as usual, watch the video, and you will probably be taken back to the System Menu (this is ok)
9. Go back to USB Loader GX, back to Wii Sports Resort, back to settings, and select ""Default Gamesettings""
10. It should work flawlessly now, and you will never have to go through this process again

Note: This method is very similar for other Wii Motion Plus games that require an alternate DOL initial boot-up, so simply follow the same instructions."

thanks for the up WiiGM"
[T],dramacore,2011-06-10T19:25Z,"haha the sound issues were the best part.
it was like a free experimental noise set during a shitty tutorial video i couldn't skip. "
,curtis.e.bear,2011-07-05T12:59Z,"HobbitGamez you are a legend! Thanks for taking the time and effort to not only upload the game but explain easily how to get it going.

I just thought i kept downloading corrupt versions. You made my day!"
,HSSG,2011-09-16T11:53Z,Works! Thanks!!
,asdfqwerzxcv,2011-09-17T05:50Z,Do you need the motion plus to play? Please respond
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-09-24T08:47Z,"@asdfqwerzxcv

Yes, wii motion plus is absolutely required for playing this title."
,busterthefox,2011-09-30T04:54Z,"Very fun game. Worth it for how small it is on my USB Drive. :3 I never had that alternate dol problem on configurable USB Loader. 4.3 U. Anyway, this works great.

Come to think of it, I also had absolutely no issues with Smash Bros. Brawl OR Metroid Other M. Maybe I'm just lucky? XD"
,TheChoZen1,2011-10-11T04:30Z,I don't understand any of this. First time I have ever heard of a WBFS file. This is all new to me. How can I just burn this file to a disc. Any1 ..any1 help a bro man out!?!
,noobtroll,2011-11-18T02:37Z,"You're the man HobbitGamez...your uploads rock! Thanks for the information and upload, works flawlessly on my 4.3U w/ USB loader GX after following your detailed instructions."
,CubbyStar,2012-01-04T02:59Z,"WBFS Manager just keeps crashing at the end, doesnt seem to load the drive.. just freezes ? 

any help?"
,Sivos,2012-01-09T00:05Z,"You know, I just ordered the Wii Motion Plus and I realized if they didn't get rid of the offer of getting this game along with the attachment, they would have saved themselves from this game becoming pirated, lol.  Just because you can't play this game without the Wii Motion Plus, so this torrent would have been made useless.  Sure it would just cause some people to download it, burn it to a disk and sell it illegally, but it would have stopped the majority.  Anyway, thanks for the upload, it downloaded fast so once I get the Wii Motion Plus in the mail, I'll be sure to give this a try.  :D"

,lemonhead26,2012-01-18T22:01Z,Do i need to do this to play other wii motion + game?
,lemonhead26,2012-01-18T23:02Z,i get a blue error screen when i try this xd
,lemonhead26,2012-01-18T23:07Z,Nevermind i found out how. If you follow Hobbitgamez instructions and get a blue error screen then go to settings and change Error Fix to Anti
,Nyghtstalker,2012-02-17T15:55Z,"I have a question for you Hobbit regarding the Wii, is there anyway I can contact you besides here? That is if you even get it here. lol"
