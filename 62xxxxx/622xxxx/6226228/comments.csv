[T],TaurusKJ,2011-03-08T12:37Z,"@reichert: Certainly. I have rarely felt the need to include info, such as the link you posted, in any of my torrents.  I found it only necessary to give the logistics of the torrent, such as the name, how big it is, the region code, how I made the file and so forth. True, the download would not include who starred as the tailor or how many awards it has won, but I don't believe that is prudent to actually obtaining the movie, and I was only making available what I obtained on TPB, which was not available on TPB anymore.  So if a downloader wants to know who did Barbra's hair for the movie, let he seek such facts on their own time.  Bygones. "
