Alex Gates (Jack Nicholson) is a wealthy wine dealer who has distanced himself from his wife with his philandering and from his son (Stephen Dorff) with his negligence. After he steals a diamond necklace with the help of a safecracker partner, Victor (Michael Caine), things start coming apart. His wife sets out to interrupt what she thinks is another one of his weekend dalliances, but what is really his trip to pawn the stolen jewels.
