* 3 Car Garage is the fifth album by American pop rock group Hanson. It consists of material from their MMMBop album minus four tracks. There is much confusion that 3 Car Garage contains tracks from both the MMMBop and Boomerang albums, when actually, only songs from MMMBop are present. The tracks that never made it from MMMBop to 3 Car Garage are the shorter version of "MMMBop", "Something New", "Incredible", and "Baby (You're So Fine)".
