This is an updated version of the torrent from Games4theworld titled "SimCity 4 Deluxe [FULL] * Games4theworld *".

This one gives you the latest version of the game, v1.1.638.0.

The torrent by Games4theworld worked fine for me on Win7 x64 but there were a number of fixes that sounded desirable (details below) so I rebundled everything to include the update. This is a stand-alone install (you do not need the Games4theworld package, only this one).


Included:

- Installation Guide
- SimCity 4 Deluxe CD 1.ISO
- SimCity 4 Deluxe CD 2.ISO
- Simcity 4 Deluxe v1.1.638.0 update
- Crack


The differences are:
1 - This one assumes you will burn the ISOs to CDs and install from the CDs (but you could still do it from the ISO images if you prefer - I like to use actual CDs).
2 - This one includes the update to v1.1.638.0 (from ea.com).
3 - This one includes the no-cd patch for v1.1.638.0 (from GameCopyWorld.com).
