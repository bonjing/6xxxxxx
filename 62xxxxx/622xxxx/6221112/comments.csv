USE THE FUCKING (+) or (-) QUALITY RATING OPTION INSTEAD OF CRYING AND COMPLAINING (making yourselves look like the ungrateful little pukes you truly are) SECOND LEAVE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK OR NONE AT ALL.  If you have the time to piss and moan without uploading a better version.....then I suggest you go pay for a movie ticket and STFU because myself and thousands of others who actually appreciate this website and its dedicated up-loaders are sick of comment pages being nothing but useless, ungrateful, whiny, repetitive, BS coming out of some of you people.

,7thSense,2011-03-17T06:07Z,I remember when a TS was what it was supposed to be: a video recorded with a professional level camera. Now people record with a cheap home cam and call it a TS. There's a reason there is a distinction between cam and TS.

,dlarrym1111,2011-03-20T05:27Z,"@7thSense: This is from your own comment: ""I remember when a TS was what it was supposed to be: a video recorded with a professional level camera.""

This is NOT what TS means and never has nor will it ever in the future. It is an acronym referring to the word TELE-SYNC -ie- TS. TELE-SYNC is the audio from the Projection room of the theater where a CAM movie was made. It means the audio is from the same source that is producing the audio for the speakers in the movie theater. It is far superior then the crappy audio you would get from the mics built into the camera. TS audio that is coming into your CAM from cables coming from the projection room of a movie theater has a distinct advantage over using the built in microphones on a camera your holding while sitting in the audience. 

In other words:

TS= Generally better audio that was captured from the audio output from the projection room of a movie theater. Audio cables are strung down and connected to ones video camera and the camera's built in microphones are cut off. The built in mics are inferior when a TS audio source is available.

NON-TS audio= Usually means mediocre sound quality at best that is captured from the built in microphones on the same video camera used to make the CAM recording of a movie. The video camera are in the audience with the video camera owner and can't achieve the audio quality of having a direct connection to the audio source in the projection room as a true TS lets you do."

,fignose,2011-03-21T21:29Z,"Video is crap, sync is crap, don't bother downloading"
,Doowangle,2011-03-21T22:24Z,"These comments are meant to post about the torrent, good or bad, it is not here to simply coddle the balls of every contributor. If you are too much of a bitch to handle negative feedback, then don't post low quality trash. 

Just because you contribute does not mean you are immune to negative comments. Yes its great people take the time to do this for us, and I thank a majority of them, but when the quality is shit, you are going to hear complaints. Get over it. 

Just because the torrents are free does not mean that we have to happily accept horrible quality, its a big community with lots of uploaders. There is no reason to pretend like this is good when you can find better theater releases of all kinds of movies.

And lets be honest, more people upload to get their nerd ego stroked than upload because they are such great people. So lets not pretend every negative comment is the equivalent of spitting on Mother Theresa.
