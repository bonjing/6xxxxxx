kylepro88, do you know how many christian movies get sold in one year in a country like India having 40 million Christians? Some months back we held a Bible Mela here in my city (and it has the highest number of Christians among any city of India). We put up lot of stalls and sold everything from Christian Comics to Evangelical books, Christian Music to Christian DVDs. Do you know how many Christian Movies got sold? Over 1 Lakh (1,00,000) people visited and yet only three dozen movies got sold. Reason is the price. A Christian DVD costs around Rs 500/- (Approx 11 dollars). However this is the weekly salary of a daily wage earner here in India. If you look around here in India, the Hindus offer a combo of 4 religious movies for as less as Rs 40/- (less than a dollar). Other Hollywood/Bollywood movies are available with the roadside vendors in combo packs (2 to 6 movies) for as less as Rs 50/-. Against such stiff competition only very few religious Christians will buy the Movies. Also spare a thought for those Christians who live in countries where christian media and Bibles are banned. All Islamic Countries and Communist countries fall in this category. And so also countries like Bhutan, Tibet, etc.

So please stop preaching and start practicing or at least praying for those who are creating the movies and/or sharing them."

Obviously some people in the movie industry would like it to be theft so they can make more money but their wish does not make it so.

That said, please do buy Christian Movies when you can afford it."
