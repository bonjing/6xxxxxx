Celestial Decay, is a great symphonic metal band from Sweden... 

This is a torrent of their album 'Contradictum', released in 2009 i think. 

The album Contains a nice cover of Rihannas 'Unfaithful' and the 24 min long 'Final Night' at the end.


If you like epic music and/or power/heavy/trash metal, then you will enjoy this release. 



Here's a video teaser i found on Youtube:

Enjoy! /Chris
