This is for some friends on a post I have created here at TPB.
I will link this torrent in that Post.
If this is 100% Awful, then I am delsuional.
If its 50% awful than there is hope for me.
I have no memory of ever learning Piano.
Of evr having played before this last year.
Because as a very young child, aroun seven my father would fondle well teaching me to play Jesus Loves Me on his lap at the piano.
And after Eddie committed Suicide a mand his wife Roy and Julia offered me a place away each day, in all the could do then or now, to offer me amoment away from what was happening in my home.
I learned to play piano there in the ruse of learning to play Chess. I learned to keep everything from my family to the point that at one point I even kept everything from myself.
Until a year ago when it came back slowly none of my friend or family had ever heard me play.
In this is some verification to me at least in what I am saying.
I have no ida what I am doing when I play at all. None. I  just do it.
I was hurt that bad. And sometimes I hate it.
And I am so scared to share it with anyone.
There is in the mp3 a very large gap. I do not know Garage Band well enough to edit yet. So I had to leave it. I was looking for better speakers so I could respond better to what I was playing.
I do not hear well and have to loop my voice through the computer to hear well enough to sing.
If this is absolute crap ignore everything I have said in my post.In my heart I do not believe it is, just that I see something more in what I was once able to do so long ago....before november's trees when Eddie hung himself.
