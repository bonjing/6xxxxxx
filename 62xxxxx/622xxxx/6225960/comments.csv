other game rar's same size take me 5-10 minutes but zona torrent tagged stuff takes no joke 30 minutes to 1-2 HOURS.  and there's really no massive file size increase when the iso finally extracts.  they work fine, but yea, it takes forever to unrar for some reason."

,SheffieldKnight,2011-08-18T20:01Z,WTF took 3 n half hours just to unrar...... you fool leave it to the pros that upload on here!
,Ali_M.,2012-03-12T00:34Z,pure garbage. decompress will last a lifetime. do not download.
,Zstar,2012-03-25T18:33Z,"yeah like wtf, it took me like 4 hours, do not bother, your better off buying it"
,AKAONI_LOCUSTS,2012-05-11T08:17Z,why would you unrar it? put it in your portable hard drive (formated for wii)
