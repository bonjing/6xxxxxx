put the .apk on your SD card, insert it into your phone.

Then, go to settings, applications, then set the phone to allow installation from unknown sources.

After that, go to the android market, download the free astro file manager.
Open up astro, locate the .apk on your sd card and tap it. You should then have an option to install."

Google is your friend, mate. :-)

ATT blocks unknown sources, only allowing you to use Marketplace Apps but this link shows you how to sideload apps on your Motorola Atrix.

BE WARNED - a little command line interface knowledge is needed and you really should not attempt it if you don't feel comfortable with it. Also, I am in no way responsible if you brick your phone doing this as it will void your warranty."
