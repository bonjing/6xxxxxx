,rey94,2011-04-01T11:15Z,heey does it works good ???
,tal.merc,2011-04-02T02:48Z,"ya know, if you werent such a prick, i'd help you out. and test it again, i have tested it 6 times and it played just fine. and what the fuck makes you think im gonna re-rip it and reupload it just for you. plus you can't seem to take into account is that since this has been uploaded nobody said anything about problems. and just because you say it doesnt work, don't make it fuckin so. so you can leave all the shitty comments you want, because i and everybody else, arent gonna give two sweet flyin fucks. "
,tal.merc,2011-04-02T02:51Z,"and no not that didnt apply to you rey94, and yes it should work providing you have custom firmware. and if have any problems leave a comment....just dont be a prick about it pls. "
,tal.merc,2011-04-02T02:56Z,"and no rey94 that didnt apply to you, and yes it should work alright, but if it doesnt jus leave a comment and ill try to help you out. 
just dont be a prick about it...pls"
,Erick300,2011-06-01T21:10Z,tal.merc you know what?? YOUR SUCH A JERK!
,tal.merc,2011-06-12T03:57Z,@Erick300 tell it to the fuckin' birds.
,noronha_96,2011-06-14T03:30Z,Hey why you guys such jerks cant you ask nicely!He uploads the game and you guy still complain 4 f*ck sake use some manners...
,arata75,2011-06-20T00:38Z,"Thanks for the upload, but is anyone else having frame rte issue with this? There're not that bad most of the time but they're definitely noticeable.

I'm not sure if it has something to do with my PSP (3001 model), or if it's just the way the game is or if it's a bad rip, but Liberty City Stories didn't lag at all.

My cfw is PRO-B 6.39 and I'm using the Sony driver. Maybe it'll work better with the M33 driver, I dunno."
,tal.merc,2011-06-22T03:31Z,"@noronha_96 thank you for that, its nice to see somebody has some manners
@arata75 theres not too much i can do about the frame rate issue as alot of people with a downloaded version of this game have the same issue or something similar, regardless of the model.
This is just an example of what i mean...http://community.us.playstation.com/thread/411767?start=0&tstart=0.
Although, you could try to increase your CPU speed if havent already."
,EnjoiBakedOmlet4You,2011-06-27T08:10Z,you people are stupid. why dont you just leave your psp un-hacked and convert the iso to eboot? fuckin idiots.
,arata75,2011-06-29T07:24Z,"@Enjoi

Because you touch yourself at night.

@Everyone else

I fixed most of the lag by converting the cso to iso using UMDGen. The thing I didn't know about cso is that it's a compressed format, which means the PSP has to actively unpack the game while you're playing it, causing major lag and pop in (especially for a game like GTA, which frequently streams data from the ""disc"").

Converting it to iso expands the file to its full original size, albeit twice as large as the cso. I recommend converting this to iso if you have the space on your memory stick.

Always, thanks again for the torrent, tal.merc. I meant to post this comment a while ago, but TB was being reaaaaaaly slow for me."
,filipao,2011-07-18T14:09Z,"@enjoi

because the game is too big to be converted to eboot"
,tauroman,2011-08-06T14:38Z,"Mine is 6.35 Pro with m33 Drivers and NP9660. I don't know much about this: but will this game run on this configuration.

PS: Mine PSP is  3004"
,dkcalf,2011-08-07T21:05Z,"@enjoi

you  cant use eboots unless it is undecrypted. you dont know anything. also, if the games laggy try converting from cso to iso. great upload if you do"
,jo1n,2011-08-11T21:45Z,u should write whether it cso or iso format in comments but thanks for the upload
,zombie1999,2011-08-28T10:02Z,it requires a password to unzip the file
,zombie1999,2011-08-28T11:04Z,can u reply asap
,tal.merc,2011-09-06T04:17Z,"@jo1n thanks for the tip, i'll be keeping that mind.but again, this was my first upload
@zombie1999 because your not supposed to unzip it, you simply put it in the iso folder on your psp. and you are aware you need CFW(custom firmware) to play this, right?
@everybodyelse would you guys prefer iso or cso format?"
,squall14716,2011-10-01T03:40Z,".cso is always preferable - smaller size, less to download, and it can always be losslessy converted back to an uncompressed .iso in the event that it needs to be."
,MrCatscan,2011-10-02T17:17Z,can somebody help me? i've downloaded the torrent now i've got a map called grand theft auto vice city stories (psp) with a cso file in called grand theft auto vice city stories (psp).cso . what am i supposed to do next? im just new with illegal downloading psp games... 
,enclave1987,2011-11-16T23:55Z,"agree with squall
thanks for the download"
,Kokotinka,2012-02-16T23:27Z,"damn, at least post a password for rar files, otherwise worthless download (and don't say: because your not supposed to unzip it, you simply put it in the iso folder on your psp), psp doesn't support rar files as far as i know"
,Kokotinka,2012-02-16T23:55Z,"My apologies, different torrent lol."
,elia.b,2012-02-19T02:45Z,I have 6.60 god vi when i was trying to extract the file it said there was an issue with a password
,eric_n1,2012-02-23T03:30Z,"Great U/L
Guys,
tbh converting to iso does double the size, but it is worth it (excellent framerate)
So please cut this guy some slack and enjoy the game."
,Mahdi96,2012-03-15T22:19Z,does it work with PSP GO 6.60 pro b 10 ?
,djyeroc,2012-03-18T00:55Z,"Idiots. This works perfectly, tal.merc did nothing wrong."
,swaken04,2012-03-24T11:14Z,My Psp Has A CFW 6.35 Pro b2 . and it always goes to blackout when i played it about 30mins .
