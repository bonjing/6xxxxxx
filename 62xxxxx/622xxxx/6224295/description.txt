Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories for PSP.
YOU NEED CFW(CUSTOM FIRMWARE)!!!!!
I have 6.35 PRO-A4, works on that and i've tried it on my friends 5.50 GEN-D3 and it works great on that. 
However if you encounter a problem, leave a comment and the name of the CFW your using and i'll see what I can do.
If you leave a comment saying you don't have CFW, well google it or something.
