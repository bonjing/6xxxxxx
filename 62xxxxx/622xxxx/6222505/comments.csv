,black_shadow_1981,2011-03-11T20:53Z,or you can put it on a harddrive and load it from there (like i do) useing gx loader
,moh27,2011-08-16T17:17Z,"i tried transferring the file to my HDD using wiibackupmanager and it always fails in the end and doesnt get transfered. and my drive is already formated to FAT32 with 2 Games on it already that work.

is their something wrong with this file ?"
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-09-13T03:38Z,"@moh27

No, there is nothing wrong with this file. It is the full game, including all of the subspace emissary videos and music. Nothing was removed, and the quality is identical to a store-bought copy. There is no reason why it shouldn't work with USB Loader GX.

Try using this program to transfer the file (you don't even have to convert the game to ISO again):

,bobop30,2011-10-09T02:53Z,"Hello, I have tried to transfer this file multiple times to my HDD via Wii back up manager but it fails to transfer all the time. I then tried to do it manually but it says that there is not enough disk space but I got about 70GB free. Is the another way. I got the program to you referenced below. So should I split it . Let me know if you have time.

Also thanks for all your hard work."
,bobop30,2011-10-09T04:16Z,"Nevermind I used the wii game manager and splitted it into 4gb pieces and it works fine, should I do the same for Metro prime trilogy? Ever time I load the game and then I choose which part to play I get a black screen afterwards."
,bizysamoan,2011-10-13T23:39Z,yup i got the same as MOH27 & BOBOP....the games there but as soon as i go 2 transfer the file 2 my usb using wii game manager then check it with the wbfs manager theres nothing in my usb????? whats up with that ?????
,bizysamoan,2011-10-13T23:40Z,yo bobop howd u split the file in wii game manager m8???? 
,bizysamoan,2011-10-13T23:55Z,yo hobbit we downloaded this game yet it cant even work!!!!!!!!!!!!! a little heads up would of been good......other leechers beware.....lol

,vivi420,2011-11-02T03:05Z,you dont need to split it just convert to iso with manager then convert back it works
,osgiken,2011-12-07T10:50Z,"had issues trying to convert to iso with
wiibackupmanager_build78

i converted to iso with wii game manager v1.5
then used wbfs manager to put on drive."
,relic1882,2011-12-09T22:29Z,I like using Wii Backup Manager but it wouldn't transfer this game for me either. I just used Wii Game Manager 1.5 to transfer it and it worked fine. Shows up as a valid game in the list for Wii Backup Manager now too. I guess sometimes you just need to try a different transfer program before you bitch that it doesn't work. :) Thank you uploaders for your awesomeness!!!!
,ntong27,2012-01-10T00:52Z,"This file is incomplete and by the way in order to burn this file to a dvd it has to be converted to ISO, when i try to convert it to iso using wii backup manager it just stays on 99 percent complete."
,ntong27,2012-01-10T01:12Z,"To burn this file on to a dvd you'll need to convert it to an ISO, to do this you'll need wii backup manager v1.5 (note don't use the latest version cause it wont work) once converted to iso you can burn it to a dvd (im using Verbatim DVD+R DL 8.5 GB, minds you it wont fit on to a 4.7 GB dvd r."
,ntong27,2012-01-10T07:24Z,"This works , jusst need to convert it in to (ISO) using wii backup manager v1.5 (note do not use the latest version)after converting it to iso you now can reconvert it to WBFS using the latest version of wii backup manager build78 after that just place in ur hdd and it'll work 100 percent."
,keano077,2012-03-03T02:38Z,Does this work online?
,OscarAndradePTY,2012-03-11T02:00Z,Do as ntong27 said. I did and it worked fine. It includes Masterpieces too.
,fartvon,2012-06-06T18:42Z,"Guys can i play this on my sony viao i5 laptop? if i can, whats the procedure on installing this game?"
