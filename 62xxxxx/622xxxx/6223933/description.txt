Founded in 1956 as a jazz-focused offshoot of the famed Chess label, Chicago's Argo Records (renamed Cadet in 1965) amassed an impressive stable of talent including Ramsey Lewis, Ahmad Jamal, James Moody, Illinois Jacquet, Max Roach, Lou Donaldson and even Benny Goodman, favoring a bop-oriented approach deeply influenced by Windy City soul, in its time the Argo aesthetic proved a little too slick and commercial for jazz purists, but today the company's output is justly celebrated for its commitment to the groove. The Heatin' System compiles ten tracks from Argo/Cadet's mid-'60s zenith, and aficionados of acid jazz and funk will find much to savor here, highlighted by Jack McDuff's blistering title cut, the set also includes sublime entries from Baby Face Willette ("Mo' Rock"), Sahib Shihab ("Please Don't Leave Me") and Marlena Shaw ("Liberation Conversation").
