,magicriver,2011-04-24T23:39Z,"any suggestions for subtitles for the non-English parts?  (they aren't hard subtitled, and all the many subtitles I downloaded seemed to be for shorter version of the film, since they lagged a number of minutes behind it."
,Lightmanone,2011-07-11T03:56Z,"@magicriver
have the same problem, I am gonna rate this torrent down, not because of the quality, cause that is actually good, but for destroying a good part of the movie because of lack of english subs. Gonna download a different 1080p torrent"
,sjw71,2011-07-31T03:54Z,Any word on the Eng - Freign only subs?
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-09-10T02:53Z,"This is not Blu-ray rip but HD-DVD rip.
25 frames, Run-time 01:43
Blu-rays are 23.976 frames usually and very few 24 frames.
My blu-ray has 23.976 fr and  01:47:43   run-time.
I suppose I should upload my proper BDRip before you guys fool more people downloading this inferior q crap."
