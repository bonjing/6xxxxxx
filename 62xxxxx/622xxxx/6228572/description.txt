Interesting, eclectic set of five originals. Some of the cuts swing pretty well in a bop-Django Reinhardt sort of fusion. "Ragahantar" and "Ara-Be-In," by contrast, are fusions of jazz with middle-eastern music and a bit of a psychedelic rock drive.

Jerry Hahn (guitar); Michael White (violin); Noel Jewkes (flute, saxophone, tenor saxophone); Jack DeJohnette (drums).
