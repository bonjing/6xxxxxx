Over two hours of film are cut out, including the ""good old times"" part (with Andrews remembering how Terry blackmailed him with photos and tape, to prevent a further torture of another victim in the next room) which is undoubtedly the most  impressive scene in the film.
Thanks anyway, because, like I said, the quality is great."
