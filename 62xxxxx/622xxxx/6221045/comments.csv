@all:
The movie was shot mostly on 16mm film.
I can attest to the fact that it does come with a layer of film grain that is thicker than most motion pictures. It would appear that this transfer captures that pretty well for the most part; thi...s is not a movie that is going to look crystal clear even on a Blu-Ray disc, and it was not meant to.
Can confirm that the film grain is intentional on the part of the filmmakers.

Any assistance would be helpful.

Better luck next time."
