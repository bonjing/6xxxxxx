,s0litaire,2011-03-09T03:56Z,Looking for English subtitles for this...
,Zokk,2011-08-23T01:56Z,I'm having the same problem with the subs as 737Almost_Every_Day. They're all just question marks or random characters.
,Zokk,2011-08-23T02:17Z,Figured it out. They're Korean and Chinese subtitles; completely of no use to us native English speakers. Please change the subtitle language in the torrent description to reflect that accurately.
,Geroshabu,2011-09-02T06:42Z,It is as Zokk says.
,caicaiu86,2011-09-26T15:50Z,ARGH I cant seem to find the right subtitles for this on the web. please post a link if you find one.
