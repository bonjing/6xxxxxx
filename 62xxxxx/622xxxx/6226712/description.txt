The man who has made a career out of exposing the artifice and excess of modern living takes a trip to the most artificially excessive city on the planet for his seventh HBO stand-up special. When Dennis Miller takes the stage viewers can rest assured that no topic will be too taboo and no subject over the line, and in this typically scathing look at pop-culture and modern living, Miller addresses a wide variety of issues ranging from gay marriage and global warming to cringe-worthy comb-overs and the presidential aspirations of former first lady Hilary Rodham Clinton.
