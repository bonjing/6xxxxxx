,xchiamiov,2011-03-21T04:06Z,http://www.ponychan.net/chan/ep/res/754.html is the source thread.  It contains a few more eps than are here.

,martinlarsen1,2011-04-01T15:44Z,link is broken... 
,Dark_Dragon,2011-04-30T07:09Z,New link: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/754.html - today you can download from there all episodes up to 24th. Hopefully E25 and not yet aired E26 will be added there eventually.
,Dark_Dragon,2011-04-30T08:08Z,"In discussion to which I posted link above, link to 23th episode is not present in the first post but buried in comments. When I was looking for this missing episode I found better place to download all episodes including E23: http://ponies.asshat.se/"
