This collection contains all episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic as of 08-03-2011.

It was created by an annonymous brony and posted on ponychan.net I take no credit for the rip what so ever aside from creating this torrent.

The rip is from iTunes and in 720p with 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound. This rip suffer from the Quicktime gamma bug. This means the colors are slightly washed out. This can be fixed with the following filters. I take no credit for this solution, it was posted by an anonymous brony on ponychan.net


Anonymous Gamma Colorfix:

ColorYUV(gamma_y=-24,gamma_u=-24,gamma_v=-24) Gradfun2db(1.51) 

As this encode suffers from the quicktime gamma bug, tunning gamma down on playback completly removes it, my testing shows that -24(-256 being 0.0 gamma) brings it back to original value and using debanding filter twice leaves artifact so use once only.
