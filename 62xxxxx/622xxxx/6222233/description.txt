Hank Snow - Thesaurus Transcriptions
Original Release / Bear Family / 15488



A truly fantastic 5-CD box set of great unreleased Hank Snow songs recorded during his prime from 1950 to 1956. Few people-even big Hank Snow fans-have been aware of the extent and quality of this wonderful material, recorded only for radio play and never issued commercially. Snow is at his relaxed best with just his guitar, steel, bass and fiddle(either Tommy Vaden or Chubby Wise )on various cuts, and free from the pressure of trying for commercial hits he ambles through numerous old gems that he never recorded elsewhere, including a bunch of Jimmie Rodgers songs, plus a healthy amount of instrumentals featuring his distinctive guitar work.
