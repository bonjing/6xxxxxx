[V],HobbitGamez,2011-03-29T08:22Z,"@ada357345

Yes"
,ada357345,2011-03-29T15:17Z,"Hi wiiGM, What do you think of this:
http://myhomebreware.com/?hop=midebell

I was going to buy it but thought it is best to get your advise first..."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-03-29T17:41Z,"@ada357345

Don't purchase that. It is a complete scam. All the information you need to safely softmod your Wii is in this torrent. Just use the method appropriate for your version of System Menu."
,ada357345,2011-03-30T15:52Z,"Thanks for your feedback. I just got the Wii 2 weeks ago, I want to soft mod it to play copied games, but don't want to lose the warranty. I guess I'll just wait till the warranty expires. One year to go. Counting down..."
,bubba6876,2011-04-03T00:33Z,How excatly do we get this on our wii?
,aznadik,2011-05-17T04:07Z,"Will the Soft-mod guide work on the Newest Wii Console with Mario Kart bundle (introduced on May 15, 2011 for $149.99): http://amzn.to/iw7XvY ?

Am planning to buy it. But, would like to know if  that can be soft-modded. Anyone have tried it?"
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-05-21T19:18Z,"@aznadik

What you mentioned was not a new unit release, just a price drop. It it the same Wii that was more expensive before."
,SouthPaw_Chi,2011-06-02T22:08Z,"Will this work with 4.2U? copyright date on bottom of Wii says 2006. Got it for Xmas about a year later, finally got around to setting it up."
,trickeymickey,2011-08-27T00:44Z,will this work on 4.2 e as my other homebrew stopped working
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-09-05T02:02Z,"This packaged guide is growing a little redundant now. Visit this site for the latest, updated information:

And just so people will stop asking, YES, this works on ANY WII and ANY SYSTEM MENU VERSION. Use the latest letterbomb method for best results on 4.3u, 4.3e or 4.3j"
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-09-05T02:06Z,"Note:

Ok, so I take back what I said, System Menu Version 1.0 is not supported. I would be amazed if anyone is still using that, however, if you are, just update your Wii manually or via a wireless connection. Also, not all Korean Wii Systems support soft-modding."
,Obsequey,2011-09-23T21:58Z,"Thanks, i need this guide to mod a friend's wii."
,404url,2011-10-30T10:44Z,Does this work for all versions on Wii?
,kddigger,2011-11-28T20:16Z,"im new at this, but i didn't find any zipped file (as stated in instructions). my question is how do you install this onto the Wii."
