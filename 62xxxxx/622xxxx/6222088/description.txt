|What is this?|
+-------------+

This is an archived site-rip of a very reliable Wii Homebrew Soft-mod Guide. All of the information you need to soft-mod your Wii is on this site, in a very easy-to-follow tutorial which can be performed no matter what version of System Menu you are operating on. This guide will allow you to play backed-up or downloaded games on your Wii! I have taken the liberty to rip this site in case it ever goes offline for any reason.

Unzip the archive and follow the html link in the folder to get started. All content that was on the site is located in the folder and can be browsed offline, however, if there were links to other sites (which there are some) you will require an internet connection to get to those sites.
