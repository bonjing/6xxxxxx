http://www.eonline.com/on/shows/after_lately/index.html

Apparently there is a new show every Sunday at 11pm EST.

If it's not too much trouble, could you upload a few episodes? Thanks in advance."
,EdgarS789,2011-03-09T08:49Z,"Some confusion, TV.COM says ""After Lately"" is on weekdays at 11pm. They probably mean M-Th for new episodes. Who knows?"
,EdgarS789,2011-03-09T08:51Z,"Correction? According to TV.COM, After Lately is on weeknights at 11pm."
