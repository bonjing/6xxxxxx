      Genre       :   Drama                
                                           

                                                  
 It is an unusual yet simple story of a visually  
 impaired orphaned girl, Rabia who is offered a   
 better life when a young couple makes a conscious
 decision of adopting her and how she fills the   
 vacuum in their lives. Then through a twist      
 of circumstances when the protagonist comes      
 to know she is going to die, she makes two       
 important decisions that would change Rabiaâ€™s    
 and another young womanâ€™s life forever.          
 Aptly supported by an ensemble of different      
 characters, Ek Noor is an effort to give the     
 audience a glance into the plight of children   
 who get maimed and orphaned in terrorism -  
 stricken states the nobility it takes when  
 young parents make a conscious decision to  
 embrace such children as their own. It is a 
 big commitment and challenge to do this
