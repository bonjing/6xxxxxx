    Dense and tranquil woodland in the County Durham           
    countryside seems an unlikely venue for Time Team's       
    investigation into the earliest days of the Industrial   
    Revolution. But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the      
    heart of an iron and steel-producing complex that          
    fuelled the spread of empire.                             
                                                             
    Over three days the Team fight through the undergrowth    
    to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw    
    materials of industry under appalling conditions.         
                                                             
    As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the    
    archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs    
    of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site.   
    And with the help of old records they can even put       
    names and trades to the people who occupied the           
    workers' cottages that once stood alongside the works.     
                                                              
    It's a story of how cottage industry gave way to the     
    might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and     
    the Team uncover the highs and lows of the working life    
    of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how    
    excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge   
    lumps of 200-year-old slag!
