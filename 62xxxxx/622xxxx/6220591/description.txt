Crysis 2 - Build 5620 Benchmark Addon + Optional CFGs
==========================================

Required - Crysis 2 (5620) developer leak


Provided - Benchmarks Addon

             - Cleaned up Bin32 dir (AI fix & no protect included)

             - Modified Engine.pak for Benchmarks Addon support

             - Optional cfg files (tested on GeForce GTX 275)


Installation - Delete the original "Bin32" dir & replace with the provided one
                - Copy the provided Engine.pak, replacing the original


Optional - Copy the provided cfg files, replace "system.cfg"

             - These cfg files have been adjusted for maximum possible quality
               and performance, inside are descriptions of most CVARS.

             - Realistic HDR, Global Illumination, Shadow fixes, Shader Optimization &
               NO Texture Streaming, are only some of the modifications included in the cfg.

             - Multiplayer LAN workaround is also included (use Tunngle/Hamachi)


Description - Basically this addon allows you to benchmark Crysis 2 performance on your machine.
                   In the "Benchmarks" dir, there are 4 CPU Benchmarks & 4 GPU Benchmarks included.
                   The optional cfgs provided have been extensively tested on a GeForce GTX 275


NOTE: If you are planning on running Crysis 2 (5620) in 64bit (Bin64), best forget about it.
          The 64bit executable has sound issues, AI issues and countless other problems.

Though the 4th level of quality is not FULLY implemented in the leak, the provided CFGs will force VeryHighSpec. 
           
           The only differences between HighSpec & VeryHighSpec are:
           -polygon count (tris)
           -higher quality particles
           -shader calculation changes (only visible through debug)


THIS ADDON DOES NOT ADD OR ENABLE DX11 SUPPORT. IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE LEAK


ENJOY :)
