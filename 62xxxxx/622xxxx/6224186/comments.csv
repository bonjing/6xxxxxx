Avoid this one guys, this has nothing to do with civilization coming to an end, or society crumbling under the weight of corruption or anything like that. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES WEARING AMERICAN DENIM JEANS. This is the most worthless documentary I ever seen and I'm a little angry that such a stupid documentary was even created in the first place."

You're not American, are you?!"
