I had an old Boards of Canada torrent that had trouble seeding so I got rid of that one and I added two albums to this new one. So download this one instead. 


I will try and seed to the best of my abilities. My internet doesn't work very well and cuts out randomly. I always seed at night, and whenever I am not home throughout the day.

[1989] Acid Memories
[1992] Closes Vol. 1
[1994] Hooper Bay
[1994] Play By Numbers
[1995] Twoism
[1996] A Few Old Tunes
