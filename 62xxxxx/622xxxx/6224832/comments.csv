,bocmaxima,2011-04-19T07:09Z,"Thank you for the upload! I haven't downloaded yet, it is taking its time.

However, I must ask: are these albums real? I was under the impression that Acid Memories, Closes, Hooper Bay and Play by Numbers were never released, and the ones on the internet are usually fake, could someone check these please? Thanks."
,bocmaxima,2011-04-21T03:57Z,"I checked it out, here's what's up:

Albums ""Closes Vol.1"" and ""Play by Numbers"" are not real, but the songs in those folders are mislabeled BoC songs from other albums.

Album ""Acid Memories"" is not real, but a mix of mislabeled songs by BoC and other artists.

Album ""Hooper Bay"" is not real, and does not seem to contain any BoC songs, only contains mislabeled songs by other artists. 

The rest of the albums are well labeled genuine Boards of Canada, including the unofficial ""A few old tunes"" and ""Old tunes vol 2"", only missing ""Boc Maxima"" and the unlabeled 35 tracks tape.

""Acid Memories"", ""Closes"", ""Hooper Bay"", and ""Play by Numbers"" cannot be found anywhere. Here is more information:
