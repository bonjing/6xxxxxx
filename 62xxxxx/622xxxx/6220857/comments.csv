[V],globeplus,2011-03-05T13:23Z,"Thank you for the nice contribution sharing spirit about the file , of course the hindi is hindi and it is no way around that but any subtitles or audio that it is possible to use with the file in english certainly welcome too , from myself is the guarantee to the users that i getted the best possible movie file under the circunstances for the moment and making the comparing to the original used to do the work i have to say without trying to be arrogant with that , that the dub plugins simply done it once more a wonderfull work , i didnÂ´t showed a comparative video this time but the original had a kind of an embaciated picture making the picture looking a kind of old beside it is recent , once more the colours and particles was corrected by the plugins giving an excelent possible powerfull color picture with a bright ambience , to the Dub plugins i say the next thing : Well done my friends , keep it up the good work ...

Thank you for the cooperative comments and of course donÂ´t forget to watch this movie , see you all around ."
,billylopez,2011-03-05T13:54Z,globe most ur movies suck!!
,Wick3dMind,2011-03-05T14:55Z,Billy bck off he atleast contributes us with the movies that we want to watch! If u dont like him get lost!
[V],globeplus,2011-03-05T14:58Z,"To billylopez : youÂ´re right , me as a director sometimes i donÂ´t get the best angles in some shots because i get the impression that the movement of the cene sequence is ok with the acting action , so i decide to record the cenes in more angles as possible and then choose the most adequated movement for the particular cene that it is beeing recorded , sometimes i get a kind of stuck between 2 or 3 different shots of the sequences but with some help from the special effects i finally get the correct feeling about the most adequated filmed sequence for the cene , you always need to try to follow the argument more close as possible but keeping in mind the acting available and the action itself , with the experience you simply start improving yourself step by step making the filming of the cenes and what shots and angles can be most adequated for the current cene .
Thank you for your comment and i only want to be another valid option to the possible interested users , of course that i respect too the fact if they the users prefer to try other available working files around , it is always up to the user ... thank you ."
,keandra101,2011-03-05T16:00Z,"globeplus,
Can you please get the Roomate, and The Rite!!!
Great work as always!!!"
[V],globeplus,2011-03-05T16:57Z,"To keandra101 : the movie you refered it was on the theatres 1 year ago , here is the plot .

The Roommate hit theaters February 2010. This thriller was directed by Christian Christiansen. It's cast include seasoned actors such as Leighton Meester, Minka Kelly, Danneel Harris, Cam Gingandet, and Billy Zane to name a few. The acting was okay. The story wasn't so great.
The movie is about a small town girl(Sara) going to a college in the Beverly Hills area. She arrives before her roommate(Rebecca). She meets two girls in her dorm room. Later they invite her out to frat party. Sara takes a liking to the drummer at the party. She later returns to meet her schizophrenic roommate(Rebecca). They develop a friendship."

[V],globeplus,2011-03-06T06:37Z,"To blusniffer : billylopez said that my movies sucks , so i explained to him my difficulties in do it the work on the direction of the films , of course just a healthy humor , you needed to read it the billylopez comment to get the comment correct interpretation but it is ok doesnÂ´t matter , unfornatly we still without audio or subtitles in english for this movie . "
[T],protoyu,2011-03-06T13:49Z,@globeplus can u plz move to matroska plz.Only it is a bulshit quality.It doesn't deserve a 1 gb size. 500mb mkv would be watchable.As anybody with a good head ain't gonna keep it.These TS files are basically watch n delete torrents. So can you avoid a huge size??
[V],globeplus,2011-03-06T18:17Z,"To spcaxel : each type of video have their own carachteristics but no matter what you can make a video file with what size you want after certain amount of bitrate but depending on the video type can be more or less justified to improve the picture stability during the view  , on the matroska the nice qulity can be reached for not too much size but without that means that smaller sizes can also do the trick , so something between 300 and 500 mb can be generally enough but you can always opt for a stronger bitrate if you want , about my uploads i prefer the divx because reach true quality and very common on online movie sites , just a really quality popular video type and to work with the Dub plugins 99% of the time works perfect , so for a matter of a good sense on the possible work i use this type but also respecting a few other video types out there that it is possible nice picture too with very nice codecs helping on the work but not so populars as that and the main general work can be more carefull and exhaustive to reach the ideal point about the wanted quality picture , so my friendly user making the balance about all the points that can be interested to choose a video type for this type of work , certainly the DivX is a positive option .

I respect your opinion too and i am not the own of the true about this things , just gived my point of view about this type of subject . Thank you for your comment ."
,fuckcopyright,2011-03-06T19:57Z,lmao illegal oscars we should make that for the pirate bay anyone in favor of illegal oscars say iiiiii!! lol 
,blusniffer,2011-03-06T23:55Z," lol fuckcopyright i don't think my idea would work as some uploaders use the comments section to write 7 line paragraphed shortstories in the search for compliments in place of the old Thank u.
Can you imagine the acceptance speech? lmao"
