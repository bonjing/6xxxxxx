This is another quality recording by Tony Joe White. What stands out immediately, is the high quality of the production and arrangements, the sound being clear without losing that swampy, funky feel. Tony Joe White is a gifted guitar player and his playing is really fluid and bluesy and if you like comparisons, you can hear Chris Rea, J.J.Cale, Dire Straits and even Z.Z. Top in some of the songs. His voice sounds a bit flat in places and I prefer his singing when he's going for that low growl (as in Yo Yo Man rather than the higher pitch but overall this is classy stuff. Definitely recommended if you like laid back blues. 
Anyone who can rhyme slippin and skinny dippin' is certainly worth a deep investigation.
