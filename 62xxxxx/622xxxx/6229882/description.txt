another fresh new release of VLC 1.8
not official yet but appears stable enough...
Guess it will be officialy released by videolan.org in few days to come or may be a little bit later...
Anyway worth a download...
100% trust
No fake anymore.
Enjoy and have fun
cheers
PS: as usual this is the direct win 32 executable directly compressed in 7.z
same for vlc 1.2.0 git also...
