[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T00:48Z,iPod files I will up soon.
,malatata,2011-03-06T01:55Z,SO how do you do the HD conversions with encode handheld?
,henrikhoe,2011-03-06T16:06Z,"HolyRoses, can you please let me know how you encode your videos, i got a big collection of movies i want to encode specfific for the ipad. I see your movies have subs, but they are in a srt file, and it wont show subtitles on the files then.

Sorry for asking you, but i spend all weekend trying to fix my problems. My ouput files are 3gb, and with bitrate around 3000, but in fast scenes, stuff get very blurry and it doesnt look any good.

Would appreciate your help alot mate. If you could tell me the process of encoding, and what programs you use etc"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T16:22Z,"The srt files are only provided to assist other advance users who need them for other purposes.  If they want to edit the srt file or translate it and then inject my audio and video into an MKV then they could use the srt file.

the M4V file in my torrents already has the SRT file included into the container.

I have a set of tools that are released to the public domain.  There is a ubuntu thread that has many examples on usage.  Read the entire thread it should answer most questions.  This is a very advanced encoder however and you need to be a power user to understand how to use it.

I don't assist with other peoples encoding methods or tools.  My tool is best."
,henrikhoe,2011-03-06T17:55Z,"Thanks for your answer holy, is the tools you are using available on the windows platform? 

I would just download your files, but my gf requires subtitles, and i see many of your movies dont have english subtitles (soft).

If you would have subtitles for all movies in english then i would just download from you, but since its just a few with subtitles i need to encode myself.

Do you think you can point me to a website with the tools you use to convert the video :) Cause i didnt understand what thread you are talking about. Thanks again, awesome work"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T18:01Z,its not for windows platform.  requires a unix like os.
,henrikhoe,2011-03-06T18:02Z,"Okay Holy

Can you point me to those tools? I mean, i love to do this on my own movies. I would just download your movies, but i need subtitles on all movies im afraid.

Didnt know what you meant by ubuntu thread, but can you give me a link.

If you dont want to do that, can you tell me if its possible to add soft sobtitles to those movies i have downloaded from you, and add soft subtitles myself.

I tried mp4box, but i didnt get it to work, do you know of anything else. If i just could add subtitles, then i dont need to encode."
,henrikhoe,2011-03-06T18:03Z,"Sorry, got a double post, sorry about that.

But is there a way to add soft subtitles to the movies i have downloaded from you on the windows platform.

Sorry again, dont want to bother you. But i kinda need subtitles :)"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T18:36Z,google.
,henrikhoe,2011-03-06T20:48Z,"Already have googled, but i was recommend yamb by secret kingdom, thanks though, seems it working good"
,Freebasedog,2011-03-10T07:46Z,thanks!
