Taken from Clyde 1 website :- Des McLean is a comedian with a track record that clearly demonstrates his wide appeal to those who love to laugh, from the heart of Glasgow to the "big smoke" of London, Des has performed and entertained at the highest level selling out gigs from new York to Edinburgh. He is Billy Connolly's "favourite comic on the Scottish circuit". In 2006 Des made his mark on Bowie @ Breakfast in 2006 so we've let him run riot with his own show!
