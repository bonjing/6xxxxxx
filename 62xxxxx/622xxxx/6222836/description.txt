Tagline
Biopic of the famed mathematician John Nash and his lifelong struggles with his mental
health. Nash enrolled as a graduate student at Princeton in 1948 and almost immediately
stood out as an odd duck. He devoted himself to finding something unique, a mathematical
theorem that would be completely original. He kept to himself for the most part and while he
went out for drinks with other students, he spends a lot of time with his roommate, Charles,
who eventually becomes his best friend. John is soon a professor at MIT where he meets
and eventually married a graduate student, Alicia. Over time however John begins to lose his
grip on reality, eventually being institutionalized diagnosed with schizophrenia. As the depths
of his imaginary world are revealed, Nash withdraws from society and it's not until the 1970s
that he makes his first foray back into the world of academics, gradually returning to
research and teaching. In 1994, John Nash was awarded the Nobel prize in Economics.
