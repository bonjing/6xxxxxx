,soldado651maia,2011-03-10T15:05Z,"HERE IS THE FIX FOR INFINITE LOADING AND SAVE GLITCH

Works on Windows 7 and multi core CPU and yet I experienced these if you check task manager > performance and you see only had one CPU there. So something weird was going on. 

open start > run > msconfig and went to boot > advanced options and deselect the checkbox for 'number of processors'.
 Then reboot. Now I have 4 CPU's in my task manager.
Just tested the game and now it works fine, even with autosave on, music enabled and Directx 11."
,the5age,2011-03-10T16:16Z,"Voices are not working even if I copy the ""vo"" folder?!

Do I have to copy or move the folder and do I have to make ""packages vo"" folder or do I have to copy it to ""/packages/vo"" folder.

Another issue is that I can't create my character, I can only choose from presets like in the Demo, is there a fix?"
,ccq49,2011-03-10T19:07Z,"ok voices work thanks for the fix, as fast as playing your old character no there is no way to do that, you can upload your old character just to affect story , by your choices from previous game, but you have to play as hawke, "

,the5age,2011-03-11T12:11Z,"OK, fixed the voices and dialogs. Copy the ""vo"" folder from ""Modules"" folder to ""\packages\core\audio\vo"". Overwrite the resident ""vo"" folder with the copied ""vo"" folder. You can move the folder, too.

HQ RIP if you exempt this little inconvenience, first two presets are locked, but other presets can be customized, I guess this is meant to be this way.

Just be more descriptive with the fixes next time Shroo, thnx for the RIP!"

you say you ripped nothing out, the game file after full install of your copy is 5.18gb

something had to be ripped!"

,soldierofthelam,2011-03-13T21:31Z,from my understanding though you also need a DLC decrypter for DA2 to get the DLC to work with any version of ripped game.
,Shoobox,2011-03-13T21:50Z,"@soldierofthelam

Nope you do not need the DLC decrypter:
the file you listed works perfect with this version of DA2 TPTB.
ive tested it out and confirmed it works with this release, downloaded your mentioned file from TeamTPTB directly and even comes with modded xml files after setup to replace in addin folders for dlc"
