Features:

Automatically Save and Fill Website Logins

1Password allows you to quickly save new Logins from within every browser it supports. It will detect when you are logging into a web site, and if it notices a password you do not already have saved, 1Password will prompt you to save the new Login in your secure, encrypted data file to use later.

True Integration With Web Browsers

1Password offers what no one else does: true web browser integration. Many applications provide safe storage areas for your private web information, but you often need to add your data by hand, then manually copy it back out when the time calls. We knew there had to be a better way.

 Support for Popular Web Browsers

The password, identity, and personal information tools that come pre-bundled with web browsers are specific to their exclusive playgrounds. Your data is locked up in each browser, forcing you to find a way to migrate your passwordsâ€”if thatâ€™s even possibleâ€”every time you switch browsers. With 1Password, your information travels with you.

Strong Password Generator

Letâ€™s face it: the days of using your petâ€™s name or your anniversary as a password are long gone. While 1Password remembers all your passwords so you donâ€™t have to, it also has a great tool called the Strong Password Generator for creating really strong, un-guessable passwords to keep you safe online.

Rock Solid Security

All of your confidential information is encrypted using AES, the same state-of-the-art encryption algorithm used as the national standard in the United States (Fun fact: AES stands for â€œAdvanced Encryption Standardâ€). 1Password uses 128-bit keys for encryption, which means it would take millions of years for a criminal to decrypt your data using a â€œbrute forceâ€ attack.

Securely Organize Your Life With Wallet

The Wallet provides a secure place to store sensitive information like credit cards, bank accounts, memberships and reward programs, etc. You can use 1Passwordâ€™s powerful encryption technology to safely save all this information and find it when you need it.

Automatically Fill Credit Cards While Shopping Online

Shop more conveniently and keep your credit card numbers out of business hands by saving them locally in 1Passwordâ€™s Wallet, then filling them into shopping forms when you want.

Automatically Fill Addresses, Contact Information, Forums, and More

In addition to credit card numbers, 1Password allows you to automatically fill even more things like your address, contact information, favorite links, and forum registrations with just a single click. You can save all or some of this information in a 1Password Identity, and you can create as many Identities as you like.
