SANTi NOTES
This movie is very grainy but that's the way it was intended to be shown. If not done right, it will really look bad on an xvid encode so I did some changes on my script/filters. The result came out really good with just the right amount of grain, sharpness, noise, etc... The best you can get from a standard definition xvid release. Check sample and see for yourself.
