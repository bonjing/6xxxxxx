         Deep in the Brazilian Amazon lurk tales of a massive          
         one-eyed monster. With slashing claws, savage howl,           
         noxious stench and a gaping mouth in its body, the locals     
         tremble to repeat its name: mapinguari. To gather concrete    
         information on the creature, Spain must gain the confidence   
         of the local tribes. He takes part in an extreme initiation   
         ritual: wearing gloves lined with venomous bullet ants. The   
         insects' stings send Pat into a hallucinatory world           
          of pain.
