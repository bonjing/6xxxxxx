Hint: use '@foo' to launch a virtual device named 'foo'.
please use -help for more information

Is there any solution, thanks."
,AIN_22,2011-09-15T06:54Z,May be the exe file get infected by virus/ Otherwise it runs smoothly in any PC {Well i've not try this emulator in 64 bit OS if someone tried than post a comment about the running of this}
,fezankhan93,2011-09-23T09:47Z,"Will it work on Windows 7?
any special requirement to run android emulator ?"
,AIN_22,2011-09-25T15:46Z,its requirement is very low!  Believe me I've run this emulator in a Pentium 4 processor pc in my cousins home. Now i am  useing core2duo. runs flawless.  Just somehow i get a windows 8 capable pc then it will be awesome. Keep it alive.
,AIN_22,2011-10-09T07:01Z,android 4.0 is awesome. love the taste of ice cream sandwich. never get rid of this. 
,torrentreview,2011-10-10T10:19Z,"I reinstall it and it works, thanks!

One thing, the android 3.2 seems to lag, any ways to solve this?"
,torrentreview,2011-10-10T12:17Z,"The problem seems to be with android 3.0 and above, and the lag is quite bad. I had increase the RAM to 1000MiB, but it doesn't change much.
I went to check it up on the internet and it was said that the lag was a general problem because android is a different OS, are you facing this too?"
,AIN_22,2011-10-12T17:00Z,Not too much sometimes when many programes running at same time. I've upgraded my pc to i5 series and ram 4g+   nvidia 2g graphics card. Smooth runs but.in dual core a little bit laggy. Faced in past. 
,AIN_22,2011-10-14T08:08Z,This is Nur Muhammad
