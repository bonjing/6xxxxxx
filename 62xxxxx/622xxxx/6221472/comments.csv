This controversial documentary by Roberto HernĂÂĄndez and Geoffrey Smith openly shows the world the broken and corrupt justice system that Mexico currently has in place.

The Mexican government has just banned viewing the documentary inside the country which means that there is extra reason to spread this as much as possible, join the struggle against censorship, spread the word!

Official plot summary:

Two young Mexican attorneys attempt to exonerate a wrongly convicted man by making a documentary. In the process, they expose the contradictions of a judicial system that presumes suspects guilty until proven innocent.

For now, the biggest movie theatre chain in the country is disobeying our corrupt government. 

But for how long...?

So I'm helping make sure everyone that is interested has a copy. "
