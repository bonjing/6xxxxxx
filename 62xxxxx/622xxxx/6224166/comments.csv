,djrjx,2011-03-07T00:39Z,"How the heck do I seed my own torrent? I see there are 4 leechers, and 0 seeders. I know I should be a seeder... I thought it would happen automatically as soon as someone tried to download the mix. I am using Vuze and I have the client open and ready to seed.

I can't find any indication I am seeding. Is anyone able to download?"
