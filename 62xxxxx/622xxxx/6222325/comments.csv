But the videos are very huge, downloading at 256 KB is aaahhhhhh ....then  i have to change them to mp3 Audio files, to listen it from my mobile or ipod. 

It will make my (mine and others) life easier if you could upload them as an Audio book , what do you think? can u do that, please, plezzzzzz ...zzz :))))

I prefer audio books, than videos, a 30 minute drive (cooking, cleaning, labor job) is one lecture by professor from the top universities ...  what an age to be alive!  "

You should be able to configure your bittorrent client so you can selectively download individual courses from such an archive."
