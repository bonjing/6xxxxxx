,Ais Cold,2011-03-08T22:55Z,textures are fucked upp in kirkwall but it works.
,knightman698,2011-03-09T03:40Z,hey so im kinda new at this. how do you un rar?
,Perhelion,2011-03-09T07:08Z,Just FYI: Having the settings on DirectX 11 can cause the game to crash before it even loaded. Putting the setting on DirectX 9 has fixed the issue.
,killua086,2011-03-09T10:46Z,anyone know why i cant equip armors to my companions? they are all binded to my character only O.O
,DonCorleone7,2011-03-09T15:10Z,"u cant equip items on your companions no longer, a downside i know :("
,crier82,2011-03-09T16:25Z,"@e0r: LOL, you're getting this game but you have no idea what this game is about?

You CAN'T import char from DA:O cos this is an entire DIFFERENT adventure. There's no Grey Wardens. This was advertised for the last entire year, were you in a coma?"
,DonCorleone7,2011-03-09T18:04Z,i think he means importing the save from origins or witch hunt which will have an effect on the da2 universe.
,elessarGObonzo,2011-03-10T03:01Z,toward the beginning of the game it will seek for Dragon Age 1 saved games. you can select them or default histories as a background for your DA2 adventure.
,gate2padfoot,2011-03-12T02:17Z,"Dude cn u plz upload
Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 2"
,MaikinhoBr,2011-03-13T15:54Z,Waiting Crack For V1.01
,apadf,2011-03-13T16:16Z,"@MaikinhoBr
same here, some group working on it?"
,Disketa,2011-03-13T22:35Z,"Can anyone confirm if that crack from smi10tha is real thing? I can't even download it, so I think it will probably be a fake :("
,apadf,2011-03-14T07:18Z,probably the endless survey plus fake file combination
,anderst5,2011-03-14T08:01Z,"@knightman698 to unrar u can either double click the rar file , than you select pack out files and then select where u want to urar them. Nor u can rightclick it and then select pack out files."
,Gory666,2011-03-16T22:17Z,it worked mbb15 thanks :)
,FlubbaJubba,2011-04-02T10:42Z,"I got this crack and i am stuck at the EA product key screen, i have put in multiple cracks and nothing, anyway to bi pass this?"
,elite1230,2011-06-20T16:23Z,works 100% for me no viruses :D
,Kommondoz,2011-09-03T06:42Z,"Holy crap, i have been looking everywhere for this. all the other ones are for dragon age origins or those god dam survey scams. i didnt even think this one would work!! thank you so much"
