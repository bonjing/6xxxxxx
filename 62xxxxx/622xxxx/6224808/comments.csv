April 9, 2007â€”Geologist Juan Manuel GarcÃ­a-Ruiz calls it ""the Sistine Chapel of crystals,"" but Superman could call it home.

A sort of south-of-the-border Fortress of Solitude, Mexico's Cueva de los Cristales (Cave of Crystals) contains some of the world's largest known natural crystalsâ€”translucent beams of gypsum as long as 36 feet (11 meters).

How did the crystals reach such superheroic proportions?

In the new issue of the journal Geology, GarcÃ­a-Ruiz reports that for millennia the crystals thrived in the cave's extremely rare and stable natural environment. Temperatures hovered consistently around a steamy 136 degrees Fahrenheit (58 degrees Celsius), and the cave was filled with mineral-rich water that drove the crystals' growth.

Modern-day mining operations exposed the natural wonder by pumping water out of the 30-by-90-foot (10-by-30-meter) cave, which was found in 2000 near the town of Delicias (Chihuahua state map). Now GarcÃ­a-Ruiz is advising the mining company to preserve the caves.

""There is no other place on the planet,"" GarcÃ­a-Ruiz said, ""where the mineral world reveals itself in such beauty."""
