History Education
BBC Radio for schools
exact broadcast dates unknown - 1980s-90s?
44100Hz / 128 kbps stereo

There is some distortion mostly in the few places with music like the introductions.
Overall they sound fine for their age and perfectly listenable.

Following on from the History Mysteries series
these are similar on some levels but very different in others.
Firstly the title I used here (History Education) is a bit of a misnomer.
The title just helps things for example when I have to give Demonoid a title of the torrent. 
It's not the proper collective title for these broadcasts in the way that the History Mysteries are. 
These programmes are more documentary-centric whereas the Mysteries tend to use dramatisation more.
However actors are used for historical readings and recreations. 
You might recognise some names in the credits for example Crawford Logan.
