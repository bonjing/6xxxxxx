"Bombshells"

Tension reaches new heights when Cuddy faces 
sobering news that propels her to reevaluate 
her priorities. While House is distracted by 
his concern for Cuddy's well-being, the team 
treats a teenage patient whose worsening 
symptoms and suspicious body scars indicate 
more than just physical illness. Sensing the 
teen's troubled emotional and mental state, 
Taub turns to the patient's personal life 
for clues and uncovers disturbing home 
videos that could put the lives of his peers 
in danger. Meanwhile, Cuddy remains hopeful 
that House will be fully present when she 
needs him most, and a series of dreams, 
including a musical scene choreographed by 
Mia Michaels, provide glimpses into her life 
and her relationship with House.

Enjoy :)
