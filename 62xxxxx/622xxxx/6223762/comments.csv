,WEDITKUL,2011-04-05T16:37Z,"uhm, maybe because it is not on DVD yet...
lolaford please don't ask stupid questions. By the amount of seeders and leechers I think you can deduct that people do watch this. So what you are asking is why are all people not like me and don't watch this kind of video. Well different people have different tastes, and if you don't know that then you are the moron. 

SAFCukO09 thanks for the upload:)"
,dromatic,2011-04-07T07:01Z,If you dont like free shit/piracy then stfu and go buy high quality. Thanks for upload.
,Bresieda,2011-04-08T04:16Z,a7/v7 watchable
,shiftedx9,2011-04-10T05:24Z,"to answer lolaford's question, uploaders post cams because people watch them. there are plenty of people out there who dont want to wait for the dvd release, i dont happen to be one of them but to each his/her own. the quality is good for a cam, but of course its not dvd/blu ray quality so either wait it out or stfu. we dont need your bitching"
,Desarae_AZ,2011-04-20T05:39Z,"If you don't like a movie's audio or video, then go to the theaters buy 2 tickets, pop corn, and some drinks. After you spend $50, then STFU and come here for free movies. Its that simple.  "
,sevenover,2011-04-28T21:31Z,lolaford TS stands for tellesync witch is a cam that has been adjusted by another user to be more enjoyable.  so to answer your stupid ass question TS is in the title of the torrent.  Pull your head out and learn about this wonderful world instead of making dumb ass comments about things you know nothing about.
