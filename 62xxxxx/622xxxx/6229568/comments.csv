,muthineni,2011-03-09T09:01Z,"'Dear ' minusues,
 i know you r trying to get some kind of revenge by clicking minus on every upload of 20-40 for reasons as stupid as shit but please listen to this...
you come here 10-20 times a day to check the mans uploads, take them , leech off them and click a minus everytime nothing is going on in ur real life. what kind of person does that make you... r there any words to desribe that.. new abuses have to be created in the language for egoistic lifeless selfish jerks like you..
I can only imagine how people like u r in real life..
god ur disgusting lowlives.

please stop the negativing.. how can u downrate something that u take daily.. think of it.
take and leech off. thats enough damage"
,dark_defender,2011-03-09T11:15Z,"Hi twentyforty,
Thanks for the encode & upload..+1
*Thumbs Up*"
,bender1110,2011-03-09T15:23Z,"@muthineni - yeah its wierd, I dont like knitting but I dont go to knitting websites and criticize them....

some real stupid haters here. The minus button is supposed to be for faulty or mis-represented torrents"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-09T16:40Z,"@bender1110: I know what you meant, but that's watered-down reality. Facts are, well, different and sobering:
1) Two guys are convinced that majority of my torrents are, as you've said, ""mis-represented"".
2) One guy simply hate my flag. I know from where he comes, so, it doesn't bother nor surprise me.
3) Bunch of payed shills quite regularly visit TPB (other public torrent sites too) and to make torrents repulsive - rate them down or scream FAKE! just to divert people from download. 
4) Two uploaders/affiliates probably out of old-fashioned jealousy rate down all my torrents.
5) One staff member does that too, but he stopped or haven't be caught lately - yet

Resolving that issue is quite simple; TPB M.U.S.T remove ""Quality"" rating option. It acts counterproductive and serves as playground for lunatics. If somebody want to leave comment, procedure is a tad longer and little more complicated and these idiots cannot articulate their thoughts anyhow, hitting the ""minus"" is only thing they are capable of."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-09T16:57Z,"... also, script for bot activities is so simpler in cases when some moron just want to press one button on page just once. It is one-liner, idiotically simple, and script log-in, press button and change proxy server (what they use almost always)... completely automatically - and that could be done every few minutes. It's has been used intensively in cases of on-line voting or rating anywhere, from Idol-voting to making fake pools, for years."

It's has = It has

Sorry."

,girlonthewall,2011-08-29T03:35Z,"Hi, for some reason when I try to play the mp4 file it's just sound and no picture. From reason the positive comments I'm assuming that I'm doing it wrong & that maybe there's something I should be doing to get it to work properly. Can someone please advise me? Thanks."
,girlonthewall,2011-08-29T03:56Z,Using a mac btw.
,Mutegrill,2012-02-10T06:18Z,"twentyforty: Agree with all the other sensibel people here, it's a great torrent!

On the question of changes to make piratebay equally as sensibel: There is MORE to that elevated statement piratebay keeps issue towards the movie/music industri (SOPA etc), that ""we must be free"" (in a sence). But does piratebay really mean that? No of course not!

On every other file sharing site they present you with links to ""their friends"", sites that do the same as themselves. Does piratebay do this? No, and they actually seem panicly afraid the users (us) will post links outside of piratebay to sites with similar services. This way they keep the ""customers"" who generates revenue (when clicking on ad-banners etc).

Related to that; ask yourself why you can't change or delete your uploaded torrents posts? Well, the more torrents in the system, the more piratebay sell ads: When marketing they of course includes ALL torrents, even those totally inactive (""Look how many torrents we have, thus extremely many visitors"").

So, there is so much more to piratebay than you'd thought...

One other thing: The administrators are probably told to act in a certain way, to keep visitor statistics (making a LOT of money). Administrators that are easy to lead, most likely really young and aggressive boys (many of you probably met these boys in the forum, they tend to threat and be really obnoxious).

Me? Well I still return to parentbay (sorry...piratebay) when in dispair, but I do my most downloading using Mipony (or Jdownloader) after visiting for instance: THEPARADOXusabitTRUHDonedll and so on. Preferably via rappichair links (can't spell other sites here, your comment become unpostable...). I get sick speeds! :-)  And without paying a dime.

Even THIS release of Little White Lies is available on ONEDLLandPARADOX..! :-)"
,resmith,2012-04-16T07:07Z,A / V 10 Pretty good movie. Thanks uploader
,ixvortex,2012-06-02T15:15Z,"Great quality for the size(important to us with limited bandwidth). Fast download. Awesomeness as usual from twentyfourty.

Great movie for those that like to watch the lives of self absorbed, drug soaked, narcissistic assholes. I couldn`t finish this one.

Watch the HBO series Shameless, it`s much better.  "
