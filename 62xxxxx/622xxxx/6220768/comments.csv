To start out with Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry, is to instantly raise your musical IQ measurably. Thanks so much for this. Contrary to music industry claims, I am not stealing this music. This just saves me a trip to my garage to retrieve the CD and upgrade it to lossless format, as other parts of the music industry had lead me to encode it in a lossly format. Anyone out there listening?   "
