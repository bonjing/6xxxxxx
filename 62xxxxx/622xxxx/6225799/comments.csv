,blusniffer,2011-03-08T07:11Z,"I for one want his and others opinions of the quality before spending hours downloading files only to find it's either fake, shit quality.
Of course PB is free apart from the free time spent dwnl but i never start before checking user feedback+ won't DL if theres 0 comments."
,blusniffer,2011-03-08T07:22Z,"That's PB way, decent quality gets thanks and shit quality gets bad criticism. It's a free site as the 'stop complaining its free brigade' bore us all to tears but if anyone actually takes comments personally they need to man up or fuckoff.

We'r all fracturing a law or three by DL'ng from Pbay so moral highgrounders button it!!"
,kidwolf187,2011-03-08T07:22Z,"hello globeplus ur a five letter word starting with b @kidder ur comment much thank yous glad somebody is rating this crap saves me time. globeminus these comment boxs are for people to rate the quality of ur uploads if u cant handle there critism(srry cant spell) find a new hobby, so thanks for tring but fail mostly because u said that stupid shit to kidder"
[V],globeplus,2011-03-08T09:29Z,"To kidwolf187 : I canÂ´t take it , please leave me alone !... now , seriously , i think this atributed scores can be better thinked too avaliating all the points that can be considered for the possible best file under the circunstances m so you can 3expressan opinion but that canÂ´t mean that the correct avaluation on the right perspective is beeing done , get the idea ? Thank you for your comment and i am more sports than you think but for torrent files and comparing with the other possible files available , this one is the best , it is presunction saying this ? no , i explain cams are type of videos that it is very tough to donÂ´t get imperfections with the normal codification , if you think for a second it is exactly for video files with this carachteristics that the Dub plugins was concebed , so it is just a matter to do the work that make sense using this type of video file taking the correct advantage of the fantastic work that the Dub plugins can done  .

Cheers . "
,kidderxl5,2011-03-08T09:58Z,a4/v4 at the best
,billylopez,2011-03-08T13:51Z,"@ everyone
i guess we should really say thankyou because globeplus does spend alot of his own time for people who do enjoy his downloads even though some of us bag him!!!

i think an apology is needed here and I'll be man enough to say it

Sorry globeplus for being an asshole
but i still think your torrents suck "
[V],globeplus,2011-03-08T15:59Z,"To billylopez : what you think about the other torrents ? you have an opinion too ?
