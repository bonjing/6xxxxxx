,113maddog,2011-03-05T13:31Z,i have seen the sample it seems like its not a 720p
,Darkangelas,2011-03-05T16:39Z,Thanx but slow
,rsl87,2011-03-05T18:43Z,"Everyone needs to do some research before they start complaining about the quality.. if they did they would know the film was intentionally shot to be grainy.. thats what the director wanted... all these ignorant comments are really getting annoying

Quality is fine!"
,midge218,2011-03-05T19:04Z,how can you say its not 720p check your eyes checked or just watch shitty quality
,113maddog,2011-03-06T06:34Z,"@rsl87 you might be right about the directors choice as i have seen all the samples of different releases are the same shit.
@midge218 you dont know shit fuking moron."
,ultimagic,2011-03-06T12:14Z,"@vaxxxo

the quality is good. grainy is part of the film"
,113maddog,2011-03-08T15:04Z,forget its grainy or not. see the movie. very powerfull acting almost a masterpiece.
,Mamoon69,2011-04-10T09:10Z,"GRAINY low-quality video. I downloaded the sample file & it dowsn't deserve a BDRip tag. 

I downloaded this alternative torrent & it is much clearer picture and one-quarter the size:

I say to: (rsl87) & (midge218): you are totally wrong and don't know how to judge high-quality movies. Do don't accuse others of something you are wrong about."
,axemblack,2011-07-20T14:27Z,"@Mamoon69 it is apparent that it is you who knows nothing about rating release quality.

First BDRip is not indicative of quality, it is merely the source of the rip. A BDRip could be worse or better than a DVDrip, it is entirely dependant on the settings used by the encoder. Same goes for '720p', this simply refers to the resolution! Not the actual quality of the picture.

Second, the fact that you would recommend a crappy FXG release over this excellent release...well perhaps you shouldn't be commenting on torrents at all you are simply misleading everyone else!!

This film is meant to be grainy, it's intentional. And this is a very good release. 10/10"
