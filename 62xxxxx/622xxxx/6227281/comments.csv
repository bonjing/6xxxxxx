,quattrob,2011-03-08T07:29Z,How to install this? it says I need to install Dragon Age 2 but I already did?
,OmniNegro,2011-03-08T07:37Z,"Is this not already a part of the ISO?

The game is too new for someone to have remade all the textures. What am I missing?"

,ascorius,2011-03-08T09:25Z,"Hmm, I cant seem to install this. I get the game to run perfectly with the crack fully stable and all. But the graphics are seriously dissapointing, so I hoped this would help. But this just tells me I need to install DA2 first. "
,ascorius,2011-03-08T09:48Z,I cant install it. It won't detect my DA2 install. Any manual file install out there?
,BrutaleBent,2011-03-08T10:16Z,"Posted by Soliddough on Demonoid - seems to be working:

""Found a solution to the inability to install it on the clonedvd version. If you have an archiving software like 7zip, you can open the .exe file. In it you will find a $[34] folder. That folder contains a 1 on 1 copy of all the files you need in the packages folder. So copy it, and merge it into the existing /Dragon Age 2/Packages/ folder. Open up the dragon age launcher, go to config, and you should now be able to pick the high resolution option.

Hope that helped!"""
,ebhomepc,2011-03-08T10:17Z,Hmm can any one give me a cd key i cannot install the game HELP!!

,Addaxx,2011-03-08T20:38Z,"Be warned, this texture pack is extremely resource intensive. If your graphics card doesn't have a lot of memory, you're going to suffer a huge hit in performance. 1GB cards can utilize this pack well, 512MB, 768MB cards can 'try', but you'll notice the performance drag, especially if you're playing on high resolutions.


The GTX 480 has 4.0 GB that beat 1024 MB almost 4 time. "
[V],Murlok,2011-03-08T21:24Z,Addaxx how did you get that 4 gb graphic ? 
,azizex666,2011-03-08T21:56Z,think he's counting the 3 GB memory allocated to graphics by the system also.

,Dw514,2011-03-09T04:36Z,"Hello Dragon Age 2 Community,

I have a quick question regarding the high resolution texture pack. I currently have a 460 Gtx 768 graphics card and I was wondering if it would be possible for this pack to run smoothly. 
If the answer is no, than is it possible to use my system ram (which is 4gigs) to use as vram instead? 

The reason i am asking about ram to vram is because i used to accomplish this on GTA 4 on the pc by configuring some files. 

A fast reply will be greatly appreciated."

,xiIix,2011-03-09T17:42Z,"If you don't know, then stop trying to act like you know. There isn't a consumer graphics card in existence that has anywhere near 4GB of video memory. And there is more to a graphics card than the amount of memory it has. There are some 512MB cards that completely demolish some 1GB cards out there. Maybe if you spent a few minutes learning instead of trying; and failing, to impress people with your financial status, you'd know these things."

Actually there is a 4gb graphic card. It is XFX Radeon HD 5970 BE Limited 4GB, crazy price tho.

@elturbo9077
dual GPU in SLI or Xfire does not mean a 4gb all together. check ur system specs, even if SLI is enabled, it still reads as 2gb, but u get almost 2x FPS tho."
