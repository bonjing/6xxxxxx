High Resolution Texture Pack for the PC version of Dragon Age II

This will add the option to enable higher detail replacements for most textures in game. A big difference will be noticed on level art especially.

Requirements:
Using high-resolution textures requires a graphics card with at least 1024MB video memory.
Most of the benefits from the Hi-resolution textures will only be seen if you are able to run the game in DirectX 11.


Note: In order to enable the "Very High" setting you will need a video card that supports DX11 and the latest driver

Be warned, this texture pack is extremely resource intensive. If your graphics card doesn't have a lot of memory, you're going to suffer a huge hit in performance. 1GB cards can utilize this pack well, 512MB, 768MB cards can 'try', but you'll notice the performance drag, especially if you're playing on high resolutions.

DX11 cards are recommended, obviously, the game only supports DX9 and DX11 cards, DX10 is mixed with the DX11 in the form of filters and shaders.
