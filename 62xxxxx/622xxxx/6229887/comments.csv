,RaiKitsune,2011-03-24T00:48Z,"The person who's account I was using stopped renewing his membership, it might be a while before I release an update."
,Rookie_One,2011-03-31T22:24Z,"ah well, it was cool for the time it last"
,Gerster,2011-05-23T17:57Z,"Since it will take a while before you can release an update, would it be possible to (7-)zip your rips and upload them somwhere?
That way you it would be much easier to share it and people wouldn't rely on seeders."
