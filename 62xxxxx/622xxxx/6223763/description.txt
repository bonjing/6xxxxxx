The very first Rush single, recorded during the Spring of 1973, the 'a' side was a cover of the song made famous by the Stones, but the 'b' side was an original Rush composition. These tracks have never appeared on any other (legitimate) release and so this 7 counts as one of the most prized possessions in any Rush fans' collection. The single was not a great success, and is certainly not the finest Rush recording, but provides a good insight into the formative stages of their career.
