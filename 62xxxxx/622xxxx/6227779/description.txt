What I find most interesting is that NASA and these news outlets actually feel
they need to debunk non-believers. The truth is, if this were a real event, they
wouldn't even need to entertain the thoughts of those who refuse to believe. I
mean, if it's assumed to be real by the masses, why bother? When someone
puts so much effort into convincing you that a lie is the truth, but fails to ever
provide tangible proof; most intelligent people will be naturally inclined
towards disbelief. People who speak the truth, and know what they are saying
is fact, usually completely refuse to answer absurd accusations, and why
should they? Facts are not something to debate.
