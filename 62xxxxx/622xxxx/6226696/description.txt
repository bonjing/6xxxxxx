This band came out of nowhere, arising mainly from the YouTube user 'above92's own endeavors. They're like Attack Attack!, Woe is Me, We Came as Romans, and The Devil Wears Prada all rolled into one. They feature Tyler Carter and Johnny Franck on two of their tracks. I'll post Inception ft. Tyler as soon as it's become available.
