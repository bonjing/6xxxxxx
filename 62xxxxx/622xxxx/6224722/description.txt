"And Then There Were More"

President Martinez (Blair Underwood) and 
his longtime Chief of Staff (guest star 
Roger Bart, "Desperate Housewives") 
charge the intelligence community with 
decrypting Thomas's (Clifton Collins, 
Jr.) satellite message, but more 
importantly determining to whom it was 
sent. While they are distracted, Thomas 
unveils a surprise attack, but he does 
not anticipate a heroic stand-off with 
Blake Sterling (eljko Ivanek), who learns 
an important lesson about Sleepers from 
Maya (guest star Clea DuVall, 
"Conviction").

Enjoy :)
