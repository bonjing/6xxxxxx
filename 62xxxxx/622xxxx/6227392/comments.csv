,Livens,2011-03-10T00:08Z,"Yeah, suks it was canceled. Apparently people like ghosts and wrastlin more than good scifi...

But I still want to watch the remaining eps... so thanks for uploading!"
,Bob__Dole,2011-03-10T02:11Z,"^^  Because no show lasts forever,  Why watch any show since it would eventually be canceled??"
,ezuz,2011-03-10T15:25Z,"I'm with the rest here, sad to hear about Sify not buying into series 3. But there still hasn't been word from MGM so they might sell it to someone else.

Either way, thx EzTv. I would buy these shows if I could in my home country, but as it stands I can only get them through here."
