,salchi13,2012-02-10T23:12Z,"Perfect and about the previous comments, don't worry, audio is working perfectly for every one of the three movies."
,tyl0608,2012-05-30T18:02Z,how come no audio?=0
,bigrod,2012-06-07T18:07Z,How do you take the subtitles off? The picture and audio are PRISTINE!! 10/10 for a/v! But the stupid subtitles are damn distracting
,bigrod,2012-06-07T18:09Z,"SIKE! nevermind! I just figured it out... If you just delete the .SRT files or actually, just run the movie in a separate folder without the .SRT files, no subtitles appear on the screen."
,vampzcore,2012-06-12T04:53Z,Thaks a lot PetaFOX and seeders!! :) 
,Tyestor,2012-06-16T20:19Z,Trinity is not 720p.
