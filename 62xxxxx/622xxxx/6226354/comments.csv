just wanted to say great work bro
just recently found out your torrents and i must commend your dedication ..

always nice to see some one sharing new tv episodes, esp ripped in small size but great quality like yours..

if you can accommodate it in your schedule can you PLEEEASE add house MD to your show packs

and +1 as usual to the quality"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-07T20:36Z,"Thanks.

@Dr-nidO:  Thanks. But: You just broke third ""do NOT"" rule above. House has been dropped out of my consideration three years ago, and such mega-popular show is easy obtainable in any color, shape or size everywhere - except here."
,jon4fun,2011-03-07T21:32Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"

sorry to wander into the forbidden territory unknowingly :-)

any way can you refer anyone else doing it regularly because i can't find any new episodes  in H264 below the size of 350 mb"
,froglog,2011-03-07T22:23Z,Thanks a lot
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-08T02:06Z,"Agree with your opinion of 2.  Haven't seen this one, though am fan of Jolene Blalock--she made Star Trek Enterprise worth watching (and the ongoing wait of 2+weeks downloading all 22 GB of the series!)."

,stinto,2011-03-08T19:33Z,"has something changed with recent encodes as this movie and a few others ie bluray.720p. H264  are no longer playing correctly is the upload being corrupted 
I have no fault with previous uploads as I quitelike your encodes this seems to affect only the last week or so"
