,Armageddon1976,2011-03-10T12:24Z,"Thank you, AiTB. :D It took me about 24-26 hours or so to download, which considering it was only -just- released is fantastic. The game installs fine, keygen works fine. Exceptionally easy to install (Whereas at least two other torrents on the piratebay have unnecessarily complicated crack instructions), and it works fine. I'll be buying it at the end of the month, thanks to those who set me up to 'try before I buy' :D"
,cuteJD,2011-03-10T15:05Z,now getting good speed........ thnx uploader and seeders.....
,cuteJD,2011-03-12T15:00Z,works like a charm
,The__dude21,2011-03-12T18:26Z,will this work on a MAC ?
,abanaisme,2011-03-13T05:27Z,"The game is not worth buying. It's not even a RPG anymore... it's a Party based Tactical-Action game WITH RPG elements. And it's a game in BASiC stage... not polished, all the little details that make a game great are gone. They think we buy the game only cause it have a good story and the name BIOWARE on it... idiots. Thanks for you guys who let me test the game b4 buying it. "
,cuteJD,2011-03-13T16:34Z,"i am playing it just because i liked the first one.........origins............ this is a crap game........ but thanx for the upload AiTB...........

,Josh-Evans,2011-03-17T01:46Z,"Can someone help me please, I mounted the game and installed it all fine but it keeps coming up with an EA registration page, saying I have to register to activate the game? I tried to register with my EA account and the serial number I got from inside the image but it wont let me play. How can I get rid of this, I just want to play the game to see if its any good :/"
