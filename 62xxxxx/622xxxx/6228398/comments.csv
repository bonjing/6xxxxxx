Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) are best friends who have a lot in common, including the fact that they have each been married for many years. But when the two men begin to show signs of restlessness at home, their wives (Jenna Fischer, Christina Applegate) take a bold approach to revitalizing their individual marriages: granting them a ""hall pass,"" one week of freedom to do whatever they want...no questions asked. At first, it sounds like a dream come true for Rick and Fred. But it isn't long before they discover that their expectations are out of sync with reality."

[V],globeplus,2011-03-09T02:07Z,"Hi . SCREENER definition : clean normal picture since the start to the end an it is a copy from a video or movie from a DVD , in this case the work of the plugins wasnÂ´t too much , when the picture is good enough and clean what it is possible to improve is the colours , the copy from the DVD looks very nice after the ripping normally and the picture soft and clean but also a little bright without real life besides that it isd real ok to watch , with an enchancement of the colous the picture simply gains life and the copy of the DVD it is like beeing farway , the ideal is really this : make the DVD ripping then improve the colors and we get a powerfull clean quality picture to use on the computer from the DVD ."

,kill_all_fakers,2011-03-09T04:52Z,"Wiki definition: 'A screener (SCR) is an advance screening of a film sent to critics, awards voters, video stores (for their manager and employees), and other film industry professionals, including producers and distributors'. Sorry, but what you've upped is NOT a screener."
[V],globeplus,2011-03-09T07:56Z,"Read this general definition extracted from a specialized site :

Screener

Screener normally refers to a copy made from either VHS tape or from DVD-Video disc that are sent to movie critics and censors before the movie is available to public through video rental chains. Normally refers to a very good quality bootlegged copy."
,kidderxl5,2011-03-09T09:52Z,"This is not a screener, compared to a dvdrip the quality is, a4/v4"

,hyshloger,2011-05-03T20:32Z,"Please label your uploaded video quality apropriately.

screener= DVD or VHS quality of pre release media.

AVI and/or DIVX= the media file format.

Just an FYI to avoid confusion."
