Moctar is a young boy who, although born in France, has grown up in Mali. At the age of eleven, he moves with his family to live in Paris. Moctar struggles to adjust to life in France, and is homesick for Africa. He begins to see visions of a hyena in the street. When he tells people, nobody believes him. He is laughed at by his schoolmates and sent to the school psychologist. He meets a man in the street called Paulo who helps Moctar to understand his visions.[1][2]

Writer/director Ouedraogo, maker of the acclaimed Yaaba, travelled to Paris from his native Burkina Faso to shoot this intriguing tale of an African boy adjusting to life in France, where he's troubled by memories and visions of his homeland. Although the overall feel isn't as idiomatic as the film-maker's previous work, Bohringer is on mercurial form as the former truckdriver who befriends the child, and the blend of the experiences of two worlds and cultures is arresting, if not fully achieved.
