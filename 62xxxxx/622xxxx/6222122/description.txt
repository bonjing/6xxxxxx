Finally the True WWE mix single
We Are One (WWE Mix)**

*Note 1: I have included 2 album arts here, I believe the 1 I assigned is the 
          correct 1, but you can pick the 1 you like.

**Note 2: As stated, the REAL version of this single, theres a lot of torrents that 
          are not exactly fake, but inaccurate, and just have the original from Easy 
          Day as the WWE Mix. The WWE Mix has an entirely different guitar mix 
          towards the middle of the song. Compare the two, and you'll see the 
          difference.
