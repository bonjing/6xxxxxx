Sora no Otoshimono is an adventure game based on the popular manga by Suu Minazuki.

Tomoki Sakurai is a young man whose motto is "Peace and quiet is the best", but he finds it difficult when he has to put up with a next door neighbor with a killer karate chop, an eccentric scientist bent on discovering the "New World", and a borderline sadist. One day, while he was witnessing a strange anomaly in the sky, a UMA (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) falls from it. What falls from the sky is an Angeloid named Ikaros, who soon becomes Tomoki's servant. From then on, more Angeloids come to him, and with this, he finds himself struggling for his peace and quiet, but at the same time finds pleasant things in the Angeloids bring him.
