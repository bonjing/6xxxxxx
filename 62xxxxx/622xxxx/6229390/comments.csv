,Ioxen,2011-03-09T07:39Z,wut?
,mnamna,2011-03-09T09:29Z,"Thanks for the heads up, 33wearhilton41. Not downloading this Fame-GirlZzz set."
,slee2099,2011-03-09T10:31Z, Thanks WMI I for one still love the trio whether they're nude or not 
,lena.katina,2011-03-09T11:43Z,"TPB has turned into a piece of crap.
They even deleted most of the diana & sandra torrents despite that those are grown up girls. WTF?

What's the next best torrent site for teen pics? Where do you guys migrate to?
I use btjunkie, but it's not as good as TPB used to be.
Whats the best torrent site now?

Thanks for the upload, though I am not interested in Virginia, find her a bit boring."
,jizzlobber72000,2011-03-09T13:42Z,Thanks for your continual posting of all the Fame Girls... all hot / all delicious
,rbburner,2011-03-09T15:42Z,What a waste.  Sears catalogue has better pictures.
,XxlKooLaiDlxX,2011-03-09T16:41Z,"@ lena.katina: I can't speak of any torrent sites because I don't know of any but I've been using a image chan site that is great. All the models we were used to, but none of the bullshit attached like here age restrictions or trolls. All like-minded people in one place. I would post the site address but I've always lived by ""loose lips sink ships"". It's not like a super secret site or anything but that's just how I am. A decent enough search should find it though. That's how I found it after all. It's awesome because they had Newstar Krystal sets posted 10 sets ahead of her website lol. Only problem is they don't use torrents. They upload to file sharing websites so you have to be kind of quick to download sets before they get erased."
,cult22,2011-03-09T17:31Z,"i think i lot of people turn to site like mu to put there file cause you don't have to seed or feed like torrent.
just need to find the best forum for the file."
,MotleyC,2011-03-09T17:39Z,XxlKooLaiDlxX perhaps a hint at how you found it?
,raptor215,2011-03-10T03:28Z,"yeah, i dont know either...i looked at 4chan but i cant figure out the categories...looks like a bust though. usenext has a ton of stuff but its all old stuff...none of the newer tinymodel/ newstar stuff."
,PlightOfTheInnovators,2011-03-10T04:21Z,"I think I know where XxlKooLaiDlxX is talking about, and I can understand his reluctance to say what it is, this is probably due to the site always getting the links to the files deleted after a day or two, the result of fucking trolls reporting the files to the uploading site, like he said, its not a mega secret website but we dont want TPB moral crusaders coming over and making things worse. As for other torrent sites with CM I havent come across any with any new stuff on, but if your looking for fillers for collections ect then try BTMonster,BTJunkie, and Monova, some torrents are dead but thats always been the downside of torrenting.BTW-if you find that site make sure you`ve got a good anti-virus, otherwise it might fuck you up, and stick to the rules otherwise you`ll get a ""GTFO"" ban for a month....take it easy :) PS-good work Mr index."
