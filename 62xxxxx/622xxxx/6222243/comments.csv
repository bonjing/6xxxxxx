,Stovo,2011-03-06T13:09Z,"Hey Robston. Thanks for taking the trouble to up this fantastic BBC series. I can't understand why it isn't being downloaded more. 

I believe you mentioned in the comments section of another episode that you might not continue if you don't get any feedback from the community. You mentioned that the series is available with English subs from another site. I have been unable to locate it. If you do decide not to up the remaining episodes, could you provide a link to that other site? I've only been able to find the series hard-coded with Dutch subs.

Anyway, thanks again."
,yourmate,2011-03-06T14:58Z,"Robston, I registered here just to make this comment, so I hope you take it seriously! I am totally addicted to this fantastic series. It's the best TV series since The Wire. I've tried to delay viewing my downloads so I can savour ""next week's"" episode, but it's impossible. I once watched three episodes back-to-back, because I couldn't tear myself away. The development and the tension is just incredible. To think that you might stop uploading them is terrible! Maybe you're not getting the number of downloads that the series and your efforts deserve - maybe it's ""early days"" and the downloads will pick up. The downloads will just stop if you do, leaving a lot of people chewing the rug in frustration!

Please PLEASE continue uploading this series. I live in a very remote part of the far east, and it's just such a pleasure to be able to immerse myself in this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who enjoys it, and maybe some are too lazy to say ""thank you"".

The amount of pleasure you bring with these downloads has no relation to the numbers you're getting. Please keep them coming - it seems such a waste to stop now!!!!!!

THANK YOU a million times."
,danglish,2011-03-06T18:40Z,"Thanks a lot for uploading. I'm danish, living abroad, quite proud that this danish series is so famous.  I DO appreciate your work. I will seed. I'm as addicted as ""yourmate"".
Thanks again!"

[T],Robston,2011-03-07T01:35Z,"Hello Stovo,

Right then, here we go. 
The Season 2 copy I had was the hardcoded Eng subs version... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6191813/The_Killing_Season_2_(Forbrydelsen_II)_English_Subs_Hard_Coded
that unfortunately has bad Google translated subs.

So I am currently downloading this one..
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5432881/Forbrydelsen_II ,which is the Danish only version, and was going to use the subs found at opensubtitles.org.

However... Kchase77 has taken this version and added some English .Srt Subs files (the very same subs I was going to use) which seem pretty good. Well done Kchase77.

Their torrent is here..
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6216337/Forbrydelsen_2_w_English_Subs_(not_hardcoded)

So I'm running both those torrents, which are sharing the same folder because they are exactly the same files except one torrent includes the subs files.

So, fingers crossed that these versions are OK.

[T],Robston,2011-03-07T01:37Z,"Hello yourmate,

Thank you for those kind words.

Robston"
,yourmate,2011-03-07T14:56Z,"Robston, they're just words, unfortunately - I feel I owe you a pint or two at the very least! I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way. I really do thank you for this. One problem seems to be (at least for me) a weird trick the PB search engine plays - episodes 1-6 show up easily, at the top of the list for a search for ""the killing"". The later episodes are invisible unless I keep trying, and there seems to be no consistent way of getting them at the top of the search list.

Incidentally, of all the things I've downloaded this is by far the most seeding I've ever been able to achieve, so there's a lot of interest out there!

Tak sa myket! Don't give up!!!!!"
,barton_fink,2011-03-07T16:05Z,"Thanks, loving the series"
,Stovo,2011-03-08T02:02Z,"Robston my man!

Thanks for the links. Like yourmate, I'm presently in Asia, and the only way I'm ever going to get this truly excellent series is if some digital Samaritan uploads it to a torrent site. As you can see, there are people out there who do appreciate the time and energy you are putting into these uploads.

About the paucity of downloaders: perhaps Forbrydelson just isn't getting the publicity it deserves. I only discovered this BBC series reading the online version of the admirable UK paper The Guardian. Oddly, there seem to be a lot of Brits who have it in for the BBC. As an American, I can only appreciate the great stuff they have consistently put out over the years.

I imagine many English speakers don't like reading subtitles - certainly Americans hate subtitles. I like to rework LBJ's famous putdown of Gerald Ford: Americans can't chew gum and read subtitles at the same time. It's a shame really. The series will probably end up being remade in the States and all the color of the original will be lost - like what they did with the Swedish ""Let the Right One In"". Far, far more interesting to watch the original.

Keep up the good work Robson, we the unwashed downloaders of the world are in your debt."

If I were Danish, I would also take pride in Susanne Bier, the director of many excellent films. 

Hey danglish, Denmark is a small country - right? Everybody must know everybody. Could you get me a date with Sofie GrĂĽbĂ¸l - she is so my type."
,yourmate,2011-03-08T08:40Z,"Stovo, I think you may be right about the subtitles putting people off. I don't mind them at all - if anything, it makes the whole thing seem more real to me.

Another thanks to Robston while I'm here."
,kchase77,2011-03-08T13:40Z,"Hey thanks, Robston, for the mention! Appreciate it.

Getting ready to upload another Danish show called ""The Eagle: A Criminal Odyssey."" Will be Danish with English subs--that are very good. :)"
,woollypig,2011-03-09T06:36Z,Thanks ever so much!!! We don't get the BBC over in Asia so I depend on you entirely for this series. I've been telling all my friends to watch it and the best part of my week is when there are new episodes to downloads! Thanks again!
,scottielass,2011-03-20T16:04Z,Many thanks again -- this series is brilliant.
