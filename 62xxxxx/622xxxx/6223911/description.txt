2 Meter Sessions: A legendary archive of music sessions. Songs in different renditions. From a single guitar and a small or acoustic version to complete bands that go full throttle with an electric set. Weâ€™ve recorded them all.



The 2 Meter Sessions were founded in 1987 by Dutch TV- and radio host Jan Douwe Kroeske, when we recorded the first 2 Meter Session with New-Zealanders Crowded House. Since then, the archive has grown into a amazing total of 1460 sessions. Ranging from bands of different genre, age and fame. To give you an idea, weâ€™ve recorded from Nirvana to Eels. With Radiohead, Low Anthem, dEUS and Yeasayer in between. Weâ€™ve met up with Joe Cocker, Southside Johnny & the Ashbury Jukes, Aerosmith, JJ Cale, James Taylor, Tony Joe White and Jackson Browne. We werenâ€™t even too shy to record with Sepultura and Tool. In short: Weâ€™re willing to record anything that we consider to be true and good music.



We have several friends with professional studios in Amsterdam where we record these 2 Meter Sessions for television and radio. Weâ€™ll broadcast them along the way at Hollandsâ€™ alternative radio station KinkFM. Where Jan Douwe, or â€˜JDâ€™, has two shows: 2 Meter into the Air every day from 7:00 â€“ 9:00 Dutch time, and 2 Meter Live, every thursday night from 22:00 â€™till midnight Dutch time. Donâ€™t mind the language, youâ€™ll understand the music. You can listen to the station at any time and place. Thatâ€™s online with iTunes at www.kinkfm.com.



Also, weâ€™ve had two seasons of 2 Meter Sessions: The Conversation. A talkshow with guests from the world of music who gets to pick three songs out of the archive, talks about the fragments and additionally plays a 2 Meter Session in the TV studio.
