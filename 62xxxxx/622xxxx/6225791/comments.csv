Computers don't make mistakes it's you who does...
I bet you go a wooden PC that's all, minimum requirements for 6500 Kbps stream would be like 2Ghz dual-core processor and any gpu that isnt older than a few years .. hint: Media Player Classic Home Cinema plays movies better on weak PCs than VLC! VLC is nice but not for wooden PCs... you can also try KMPlayer... good luck!"
