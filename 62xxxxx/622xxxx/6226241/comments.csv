,ireallyamabum,2011-03-12T04:51Z,"YOU DUTCH FUCKING RETARD!!!!!
First off ure posting this movie in the dvd section when u apparently filmed this with ure FUCKING CELLPHONE in a theater. How come 90% of all movies have pisspoor quality and hardcopyd dutch subs. Class act wanker, u and ure down syndrome dutch uploader friends really makes ure country look great!!!!"
,honunet,2011-03-12T07:16Z,"@capncajun  

You can use DVD-R, DVD+R or DVD+/- RW.  SOME players might not support RW's but most today will play the others.  You do NOT need to download gigs upon gigs upon gigs of VOB files like this one in order to burn to disk.  You can burn pretty much any format you want to disk with the right format.

There is an excellent program just for that called convertxtodvd which burns anything you can download on this site to dvd.  Including VOB, although you should use dvdfab for that really.

But just because this guy uploaded in VOB format which fits nicely on a  DVD-5 does not mean it is DVD quality.  It is still TS (telesync) which means it was filmed by anything from a cell phone cam to a digital but was for sure filmed with cam in theater, but with a line to the audio jack so sound is decent. 

 So my advice to you is to wait for an actual dvd rip to burn to disk, not a cam.  Not worth it.  You can get both the programs I mentioned on TPB, just search under applications.  Hope that helps"
,ThoMasster,2011-03-12T17:16Z,"@ireallyamabum
so why dont you just download this movie in ur own language instead of crying here that this one (meant to be for dutch ppl) is hardsubbed... "

,streetbum149,2011-03-27T05:22Z,huh. well i sort of agree with you oz. if you dont like the quality of the torrent than simply dont dl it. but i just cant figure out why he took a shit ts and converted it to dvd format to begin with. seems like all work and no gain. i agree with you on the do it yourself thing aswell. come on guys! you call yourselves pirates?!? bring a good cam next time you go to the movies so my broke poor ass can watch too. 
,chefgeek,2011-03-28T06:03Z,"why would anyone want to ""download and find out"" when it is a huge file size?

Ever thought of putting up some screen shots, or even a sample, then people can make the choice without wasting a lot of disk space, bandwidth and the freaking time it takes to download 4+ Gigs.  Only to find out it is a shitty Cam.

The torrent file should reflect the source or the type of source, not the file extensions of the files you get.  Anyone can put shitty quality into ""dvd"" format.  Doesn't mean you are getting what is thought to be dvd quality.  

Remove the skull, or upload like one that deserve the designation."
,chefgeek,2011-03-28T06:06Z,"Correction, it does says TS2DVD, but I think it done so to deceive.  Meaning that work had been done to improve the quality with the encode, then just not compressed after.  That I can understand, but not just for the sake of putting into *.vob to give the impression of better quality"
,RaztaMazta,2011-03-28T10:53Z,"I waisted my time downloading, can´t even open the files cause they are damaged. Sucks..."

,streetbum149,2011-03-31T07:58Z,"yes this dvd is a ts...which it says clearly in the description ts2dvd. next time you dl something make sure you read all of the title. if you dont want shitty ts dont dl anything with ts in it. im waiting for dvd, which will take months to begin with. but a man can hope cant he? i remember x-men origins dvd was leaked b4 the dvd even came out."
,streetbum149,2011-03-31T08:04Z,"@candela20m would be nice but unfortunately would take more to do. maybe he dosent know Spanish, then he would either have to hire someone to do it for him or learn to do it himself. which would take longer to do. besides, this is not the place to be posting then since he just converted it. the actual ts was the imagine one i think.
