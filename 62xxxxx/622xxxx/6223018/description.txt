This is an edit of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5976024/TRANCE_-_John_00_Fleming_LIVE_At_1015__San_Francisco_2010.11.20

I removed the major glitches and since I had to decompress the original into .wav anyway, I saved it in VBR0 instead of CBR320kbps. (Same quality, smaller file.)

I have not managed to find a solution for removing the numerous little discontinuities. They are too many for a manual edit, some kind of (semi-)automatic solution would be needed. If you know how this could be done, please tell me in the comments. (I kept the .wav file for further editing.)

As always, please seed after you are done downloading. This is a great mix, it deserves your bandwidth. :)
