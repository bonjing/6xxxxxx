No need for that..! 
by default it should be 'read only' though!

Just make sure u add the links otherwise idm will render ur license invalid everytime u attempt to download!

It doesnt matter if u wish to put the host file back to read only! go ahead !"
,bert16,2011-03-10T04:02Z,"By default the hosts file ""should"" be read only, but since I've had Windows 7-64 it has never been. I'll follow your advice just leave it as is. Sometime ago unknown to me, the line ""127.0.0.1 validation.sls.microsoft.com"" was put in there, and I don't remember having done it. I just left it alone and my Windows is still activated."
,bert16,2011-03-10T05:24Z,"I installed your torrent following your instructions and ""just in case"" changed the hosts file to read only. I might take off the read only flag in a few days, let's see. I do have another question, though. The portable you put in there, what's that for and how do you use it? Is it just for Internet Explorer since there's a small iexplore.exe in there?"
[T],locobot12,2011-03-10T15:06Z,"Portable is a prelicense portable version of idm...
iexplorer is for integration with internet explorer thats all!!

it should work fine!

its Working...nice
thanx...."
,bert16,2011-03-16T03:15Z,I installed IDM and it's working great. I set the hosts file to read only just in case. What I don't understand is why did you put in that pre-license portable version? What does it do and is it pre-cracked?
,skgl,2011-05-02T18:34Z,"im using windows xp. after installing idm, whenever i start windows, i get an error msg that '12 files required for browser integration are missing in idm'  .... what should i do to remove this error?"
