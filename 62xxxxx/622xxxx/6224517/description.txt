Brooke Fraser is no sex symbol or sleazy pop princess so itâ€™s unlikely she will become world famous.  In fact, I donâ€™t think she particularly wants to.  She has a niche, and interests far deeper than just being a rich entertainer and keeping the gossip magazines fed.. 
However, as with the majority of pop/rock acts of the modern era, there's nothing all that musically groundbreaking that would make Albertine stick out from the rest of the pack.
