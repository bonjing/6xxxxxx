,banukaknight,2011-03-08T10:53Z,"Matrix ?

anyws.. riddler did one year ago
http://1337x.org/torrent/103380/The-Matrix-Trilogy-Complete-BRRip-m720p-x264-MKV-by-RiddlerA/
one file is about 500mb in size. and 1270 quality
230+ seeders. it's fast download.

well it might be too big to handle..
but even ticten wouldn't be able to do the rips under 400mb as the movies are 2hours long...

so... why waste the precious time of ticten when u already got a satisfying torrent people??"

Thanks for this support, trust and sure... your love.
Thanks to everyone :) :) :) "
,banukaknight,2011-03-08T15:54Z,"heard you were having trouble about messing with ""bad Boys II""..
well the movies is 147 minutes long...
cutting the titles might be get it to like 140.. but... yet.. i dont think u'll be able to make a 2 & half hour long movie in to a 400mb file boss...

well i've been waiting too long to see the bad guys..
so ... i think u should aim for a size like 440 and get over with it....
u are worrying too much about us handsome!
anywas...

Avatar EXTENDED..
almost 3 hours long... i assume it got off the list huh? no worries (though i was expecting that to.. lol)...
long live the ticten king.
have a nice day"
