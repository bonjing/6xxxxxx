I have built my chiptune collection over they years quite extensively and now feel like I should share my hard efforts with everyone else. This is 7.79 gigs of chiptune goodness, everything in folders by artist name. Every artist included has their complete discography in this torrenet, or those albums I was able to find. Even the albums are labeled. Enjoy!
