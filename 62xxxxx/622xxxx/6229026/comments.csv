,jules888,2011-04-23T17:20Z,Strange that someone would upload 7.8GB of MP3 files. What a waste of space. I appreciate the fact that someone put the effort into finding these tracks and putting up here but it would have been so much easier to download and seed if they were all in their native .mod format.
