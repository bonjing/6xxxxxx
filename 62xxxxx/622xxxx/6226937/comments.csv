,yourmate,2011-03-08T08:37Z,Fantastic! Thank you! I hope Mr Robston can finish uploading series one!
,nigeria70,2011-03-08T15:10Z,I already uploaded Series 1.
,aajkd,2011-03-08T15:47Z,"Firstly.
Creds for spreading this great series!

But as I commented on your other torrents as well. It would be nice if you could help people get the full episode 18 of season 1.
Either upload it, or just give a hint about where you found it."
,aajkd,2011-03-08T15:50Z,And hopefully you read the comment and created this torrent in another torrent client?
,nigeria70,2011-03-08T19:52Z,I posted a torrent of Episode 18 of Series 1. 
,aajkd,2011-03-10T01:16Z,"Better edited english subtitles:

Might be hard to use with the hardcoded ones, but probably worth a try"
,aajkd,2011-03-19T03:52Z,"Edderkoppen

Another good danish crime/drama.

,cantoute,2011-03-28T05:34Z,"Thanks for sharing this :)
why did you hard code the subtitles and not just add the subs files... vlc manages this very well :)
Just curious to know what could justify having to re-encode the film when it's so easy just to rename the .sub to the-avi-file-name.en.sub file so vlc finds it automatically."
,Stovo,2011-04-01T21:03Z,"Appreciate the effort you put into this upload. However, the English in the subtitles is so bad as to be frequently incomprehensible, which totally ruins the viewing experience."
,aajkd,2011-04-04T03:34Z,"A bit sad to see so many seeders and downloaders on this torrent..

,Bossofyou,2011-04-29T09:23Z,"subtitles on the last torrent were perfectly fine, you weirdo. same as broadcast pretty much. these, however, are shit. garbled nonsense half the time and not a fun viewing experience. why bother? dissapointing upload. maybe this hasn't been broadcast with subtitles yet, i dunno, but you're talking rubbish. probably not even your fault but whatever.
*oh yeah, it's free..blah.blah...blah. doesn't mean we should waste time with semi-useless crap. if you're gonna do it. do it right. Good show anyway."
,Bossofyou,2011-04-29T09:26Z,"sorry if i'm coming across like an arsehole, it's just your description makes out this a step-up subtitle-wise when in actual fact it's a giant step down."
,op.Artemis,2011-05-18T21:44Z,"Season one

,arwenthecat,2011-08-04T18:10Z,Excellent. Much improved subtitles and video quality is the best Iâve seenâŚwell done. Pity I only got this from Ep 5 onwards. Simple how to combine method. Download avi & srt files. I used ConvertXtoDVD to combine them. Just put the 2 files into ConvertX and press Convert it will convert them and make them playable on a standalone DVD. When you play just go into Settings on the screen and turn on the subtitles. Simple...honest.
,redjadevideo,2011-08-07T21:27Z,thank yoU!!
,empkid,2011-08-23T04:19Z,Hardcoded subs are stupid.
,far451,2011-10-01T08:16Z,"really terrible subtitles / simplistic translation, e.g. 10 minutes in, when a guy says ""hei"" at the end of a phone conversation (in Danish they use 'hei for both hi and bye), it's translated as ""hello"" :("
,dahamsta,2011-10-26T19:43Z,"As others have stated, the subs on this are garbage."
,M-rtestrawberry,2011-11-12T17:30Z,"Can you please upload episodes 13-16 on this site so I can take him? I nead him voor a friend!
thanxyou "
,ashbrook,2011-12-01T03:30Z,Many thanks for uploading this great series!
,arnoldusD,2012-01-24T10:52Z,thanx mate !!
,LCJ_10,2012-05-19T01:56Z,I read that there were 13 episodes of this season and that the final episode is not due to screen until June 2012. Is this the complete season given there's only 10 episodes?
,stef_kont,2012-06-10T16:09Z,nice series
