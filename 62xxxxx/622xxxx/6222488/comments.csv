,Skullster,2011-10-24T16:14Z,Game downloads fine.  Placed onto WBFS folder on hard disc using WBFS manager and the game would not boot just black screen and locked wii.  Copied the file again direct rather than using the manager and the same issue.  Wii is PAL but using USB loader GX this has never been a problem.  Usually I use ISOs and WBFS man to convert. Also tried forcing to PAL 50 and 60 and system default but no go.  Any ideas on getting it to work?
