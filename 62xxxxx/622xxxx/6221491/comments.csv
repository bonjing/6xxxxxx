,richardpa,2011-03-06T00:48Z,"Good PPVRip and a steady download...
A/9
V/8.5 
Really Good PPVRip, has pretty heavy chroma (colour/contrast) but this can be easily altered on your VLC Player or through your HDTV. The audio is Great, there's only a few minor glitches but nothing to spoil the copy. There's also a small watermark L1 in the bottom right hand corner but again this doesn't spoil the movie at all...          
Many Thanx to IwannaFan2 and IFLIX for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
,dlarrym1111,2011-03-06T06:05Z,"@IwannaFan2: I am used to your uploads being great, I PARY this isn't like ,""The Warriors Way"". I had commented on that upload page as to how it was cropped and other flaws, I have much faith in you, I'll Comment back, and YES I am grateful. PLEASE understand I meant no disrespect, just constructive criticism. THANKS sincerely, everyone is ranking this as TOP NOTCH!!! "
[T],protoyu,2011-03-06T08:41Z,"What the hell is this? Who downloads this.Has anyone got any patience. And IwannaFan2 this kind of picture quality and 1.12 G""f***ing""B.You just wasted my 23 mins."
,krzniuean,2011-03-06T09:57Z,any screenshots
,iridis_alpha,2011-03-06T11:40Z,"spcaxel - thats why it comes with a sample you fucking retard .. a sample is 1 minute of the movie so you can check the quality WITHOUT DOWNLOADING 1GB  - LMFAO oh man.

hooray today I taught a retard something, there's my good deed of the day."
,vsjane,2011-03-06T13:45Z,"Don't regard IwannaFan2 as a worthy uploader, this because of the butchery done to his files with the hard coding of advertisements. See a good psychiatrist and address your narcissistic failures. "
,quank861,2011-03-06T13:46Z,"@richardpa that's the comment we all would wanna see on all torrents...telling about the rip and not the fuckin ""seed"" comments...thank you dude for the review and i have a question...what is ppvrip,what ppv means ? lol"
,shrek23,2011-03-06T14:12Z,"iridis_alpha
love your comment man
seems that some people do comment without thinking for a moment"
,shrek23,2011-03-06T14:22Z,"WHAT IS PPVRIP????
-PPVRips are Pay-Per-View videos which have been recorded from Hotel rooms. PPVRip is a Pay-Per-View video source.
-PPVRips are said to have come from Pay-Per-View sources, but what is interesting is that all these releases are brand new movies which have not yet been released to Screener or DVD but are available to view by Hotel customers."

,dlarrym1111,2011-03-07T02:06Z,"@shrek23: PPV's / PPVrips are really the same thing.  As for you thinking that HOTEL customers get movies first using PPV, thats not true, ANYONE, home or hotel, that has DTV Satellite service as there Digital TV provider can choose to use the PPV service to watch movies and/or record them to there DVR's. (DTV customers get a DVR as part of the package, it is a NON TIVO DVR however) ANYWAY. . . DTV has some deal with certain movie studios allowing for simultaneous releases on DTV's satellite service and in the theaters at once. This is also being done with other movie studios where a movie gets released to NetFLICKS or BLOCKBUSTER and to DTV's PPV service at the same time as those RENTAL places. In ANY case it isn't some service that is only for hotel customers.

As for the quality of this upload, I said I'd get back for a comment, It is CROPPED, grainy, the sound is not great and I agree, this isn't up to par for IwannaFan2's stuff. Hope a good copy shows up somewhere. This isn't the worst upload of this I have seen, but it's pretty  messed up. PLEASE DON""T CROP!!! Thanks!"

,MrSorter,2011-03-07T22:48Z,I don't know about anyone else but ppv rips suck ass big time as far as I'm concerned. I'd rather wait for a decent TS or longer for a dvd rip
,whoadizzle,2011-03-07T23:12Z,"this might seem like a retarded question, but my video player(divx) up-to-date and all. Wont play this rip, where can i get a secure, reliable directshow filters. 
Please let this pirate watch the booty we've looted!"
,Tok3R,2011-03-08T03:33Z,Just get VLC and use that for movies. It's the most reliable media player.
,redactedwv,2011-03-08T04:06Z,"@ dlarrym1111 - Good info, thx man

Thx to the uploader & seeders. Sincerely appreciated as always"
,mervin338,2011-03-08T10:25Z,"While this may be one of the best rips out there so far, it's still pretty bad, video wise. You're better off waiting for a better rip than trying to enjoy the movie watching this copy.
