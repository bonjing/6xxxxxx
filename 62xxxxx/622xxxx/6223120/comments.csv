I am shocked at how little Wagner is available on TPB. Lost my kick-ass Wagner CD and most of his stuff uploaded here just sucks!! Maybe I'll have to go out and buy it yet again but as a proud pirate, just the thought of buying a CD that I once owned makes me want to set my balls on fire!! .................................so if anyone has some awesome Wagner PLEASE upload it and let me know at DrWynnScott@gmail.com or leave a comment on one of my torrent pages. Lotta Love, DrScott"
