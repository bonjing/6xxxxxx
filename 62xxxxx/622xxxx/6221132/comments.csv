,enonumus,2012-02-18T09:20Z,"Wasted about 24 hours downloading this because the specs said the aspect ratio was 16x9, and the only copy I had was full screen 4:3.  It was 16x9 alright, but only because someone specified 16x9 when they ripped it, and it's just a 4:3 full screen copy stretched and distorted to 16x9.  What's more, I'm 99% sure it was ripped from VHS, the color is completely washed out and the detail is sub-DVD.  My 4:3 copy is only 522x384, but it was definitely way better than this 720x416 copy.  I suggest another torrent."
