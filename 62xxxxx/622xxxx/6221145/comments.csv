,Speedy1986,2011-03-07T19:26Z,"Pokemon Black works great on my R4DS card! And it's in fully English.

No save errors or something. But needed to update. (http://www.r4wood.com/Kernel/h/Wood_R4_v1.26.rar) 
1.Download latest version.
2.Unrar it.
3.Copy DS_Menu_DAT & _Rpg to Map and Overwrite it
4. Done

Don't know if white works but think it would.

@Koedje, Get version 1.26 See link above.

@Remember 1234, Make sure you have the right version that's compatible with your card. Mine froze and got an error to without the update.

@Dungermum, It's an UK/Euro Rom"

thats the best emulator for this game and it also sounds better


IF YOUR USING NO$GBA emulator you must enter in these ACTION REPLAY CODES FOR IT TO SAVE NORMALLY

load the emulator ---- load the game --- when it comes up with the error enter the action replay code and enable it then click file and reset rom

As promised this a exact retail version of this game.  I am running on  DeSmuME 0.9.7 x64 and it works like a fakin champ!!!!! My desktop is more than capable of running this game although my AMD CPU usage gadget says both of my cores are running around 70%, which is normal for DeSmuME when im downloading and sharing torrnets, just surprised by the resources that are needed to run this game well!  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!! I will be looking for more to come from you!!!!!!!"
