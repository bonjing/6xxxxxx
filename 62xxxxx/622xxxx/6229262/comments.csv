,Quattrox,2011-03-09T05:56Z,Thank you
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T06:09Z,this is likely overcropped.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T06:17Z,"Tron.Legacy.2010.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD

if you want the original with imax scenes."
[V],DibyaTPB,2011-03-09T07:57Z,Thnx..
,krazyq,2011-03-09T09:34Z,"i can only find the 720 version, with chd plus what's the difference"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-09T15:33Z,"this version is cropped removing all the imax footage.  The ""dark knight"" was a movie that was similar."
,giantballsack,2011-03-09T15:39Z,Thanks for the heads-up aoloffline!
,hei-ja33,2011-03-09T17:23Z,"Languages spoken:
    Poland ?????"
,X45JKD,2011-03-09T18:18Z,"The spoken language as being Polish is most likely a typo. See the movie info:

AUDIO..........: DTS  5.1  48.0 KHz 1 536 Kbps English

Thanks, BOZX."
