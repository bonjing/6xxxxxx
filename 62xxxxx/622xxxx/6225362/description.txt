	Friend of mine recently asked me if i could find a version of this, any
version other than streaming for her daughter to watch or for her to burn to dvd.
So i went on a search.The torrents were dead, both the one with the cartoon version
and this movie for some reason No one had it except y.t. so i spent the time ripping them with a ff plugin, then recombining them all back to 1 piece with a video joiner.

The cartoons may not be the ultimate best, and same goes for the movie, they were
combined using an ipod codec cuz everyone seems to like my mp4's as of late. 
The TV Cartoon Episodes include 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,and 15 parts 1,14,and 16 were no where to be found. They were converted to a heavy mp4 codec on combining but reconverted down to ipod codec. The movie was a pain cuz i ran out of space 3 times trying to recombine them. When i say heavy codec, i mean it takes up a lot of space without producing any super hi def end results. So with some crafty shifting about and fiddling with the program i used to recombine them (cuz it doesnt give ya a lot of options to play with) i came out with a fairly watchable copy of it. I had to do a 2nd pass on it due to discovery of REALLY low volume in some of the parts I increased the volume 149% of the original to bring it up some so you can hear it. I'm assuming the person who chunked it up and uploaded it recorded it from VCR (thats what the original really looked like, and it looked like it was almost a record of a record judging on how low the audio is. Don't crap on me for it, not my original and i did what i could).Resolution on the movie i do know from original scan was 480x480 so i left that intact(i really dont like anything smaller cuz its really chunky if you watch it on a small monitor)

Told my girlfriend i had a horsey movie and she liked it. I some what do remember seeing this a long time ago, however im not sure. Theres 9 hiccups in the sound, nothing abtrusive or nothing, sound isnt there for a second. Thats where the 9 parts were painstakingly put back together.But its all here except for those 3 shows.
