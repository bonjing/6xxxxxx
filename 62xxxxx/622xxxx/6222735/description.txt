Would you risk breaking the law for your childrenâ€™s education? What about for their safety? One mom made headlines when she landed in jail after lying about her daughters' address, so they could attend a school in a safer district. Did her punishment fit the crime?  Kelley, a single mom, was prosecuted, convicted and sent to jail for listing her fatherâ€™s address as her daughtersâ€™ residence, so they could attend school in a safer district. Kelley was convicted of two felony counts for tampering with government documents. Did Kelley's punishment fit the crime? Plus, Reverend Al Sharpton, who held a rally in support of Kelley, faces off with a columnist who disagrees.
