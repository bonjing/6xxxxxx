SUMMARY:
In 1184, French village blacksmith Balian just lost his wife trough 
suicide grief-stricken by their child's death; the crusader lord Godfrey, 
baron of Ibelin, reveals himself as Balian's father and offers him 
a crusader life, which the youngster spontaneously rejects but after 
the local priest taunts him till his sword strikes fatally accepts, 
fleeing the French bishop's bloody justice and seeking divine forgiveness 
as promised to crusaders in Jerusalem. On the way, Balian is instructed 
the skills of war and chivalric honor code and dubbed a knight in 
Messina by his father, who was fatally wounded fighting off the 
bishop's men. After shipwreck on the Levantine coast, Balian soon 
proves himself a superior knight as fighter and noble idealist in 
the loyal service of leper king Baldwin, whose pragmatic right hand, 
the count of Tiberias, fails to convince Balian the ruthless knight 
Reynald de Chatillon and his traitorous master, candidate-heir to 
the throne Guy de Lusignan, must be stopped by all means before 
they plunge the crusader kingdom in a fatal war against the noble, 
militarily far superior Saracen king Saladin. When Tiberias is 
proven right, he leaves for Cyprus, brave Balian stays to defend 
besieged Jerusalem against impossible odds.
