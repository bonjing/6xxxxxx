Also, pardon me for getting off the subject, but are you having trouble with your Dell when it comes to extracting the CD? In mine the buttons on the keyboard and above don't work, I have to use Windows, go to the CD on My Computer, and click ""eject."""

If it installs on your PC then it should find your model and tell you what drivers you need. If you are using it as a restore you would have to try it.
