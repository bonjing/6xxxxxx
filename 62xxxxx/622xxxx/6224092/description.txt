Faron Youngs Aufnahmen fÃ¼r Capitol, hier erstmals vollstÃ¤ndig versammelt, bilden zehn Jahre Country-Music-Geschichte ab. Young begann als Imitator von Hank Williams. SchlieÃŸlich fand er seine eigene Stimme, mit der er Hits wie 'I've Got Five Dollars And It's Saturday Night', 'If You Ain't Lovin' You Ain't Livin'' und 'Live Fast Love Hard And Die Young' landen konnte. Dann versuchte er sich am Rock 'n' Roll, ehe er zu den Wurzeln zurÃ¼ckkehrte mit 'Alone With You'. SchlieÃŸlich wurde er ein Pionier des Nashville-Sounds mit Hits wie 'Hello Walls'. Zehn turbulente Jahre, eindrucksvoll dokumentiert. Farons Youngs Tod im Dezember 1996 bedeutete das Ende einer Ã„ra und den Verlust eines groÃŸen Talentes der Country Music. Mit dieser Gesamtausgabe seiner schÃ¶nsten Aufnahmen kÃ¶nnen wir die Erinnerung an ihn bewahren. 

English:
Faron's Capitol recordings (complete here for the first time) capture ten years of country music history. Beginning as a Hank Williams disciple, Faron found his own voice and scored hits like 'I've Got Five Dollars And It's Saturday Night', 'If You Ain't Lovin' You Ain't Livin'', and 'Live Fast Love Hard And Die Young'. Then he tried his hand at rock 'n' roll before coming back to basics with 'Alone With You'. Finally, he became a pioneer of the Nashville Sound with hits like 'Hello Walls'. Ten turbulent years - all of them here. Faron's death on December 10, 1996 marked the end of an era, and the passing of one of the great country music talents. Here's a chance to salute his memory with a complete edition of his finest
