,killua086,2011-03-09T10:48Z,anyone know why all armors i get in game are bound to my character only?
,crier82,2011-03-09T16:21Z,"@killua086: yes, it's because the game sucks. Lots of pieces of inventary of your party can't be removed, they are stucked with them to the end. You can only upgrade what they are already wearing.

I won't buy this POS."
