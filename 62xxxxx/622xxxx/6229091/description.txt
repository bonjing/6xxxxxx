Vivre Sa Vie - A Film in Twelve Episodes
Jean-Luc Godard, 1962
Starring Anna Karina

This is basically just a reupload of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3439574/ , except with subtitles, since not one of the uploaded versions on TPB have them. I also took the liberty of adding substantial punctuation (e.g. periods) to the .srt since it was missing them, which was rather aggravating. I also ran across a better translation of Brice Parain's conversation with Nana in the cafe and have thus replaced the original conversation in the subtitle file with that.

Enjoy.
