Animal Alpha was a five-piece Norwegian rock group formed in 2002.

The band spent much of 2004 playing shows around Norway. This, alongside performances at Osloâ€™s prestigious Ã˜ya Festival (earning them 8 of 10 points in British Metal Hammer magazine), combined with an appearance on the national TV program â€˜Lydverketâ€™, created a buzz around the band that led to two sold-out nights at Osloâ€™s 500-crowd-capacity John Dee club. The band then signed with small indie label Racing Junior, penciling the release of their first EP and album for spring 2005.

Animal Alpha spent 2005 playing all over Norway supporting their self-titled EP and debut-album â€œPheromonesâ€, which was released on September 5.

Their Second album, "You Pay for the Whole Seat, But You'll Only Need the Edge" was released on January 28, 2008.

As of March 12, 2009, Animal Alpha has disbanded. On their website and myspace, a press release was posted, saying that the band "found themselves in a creative deadlock while preparing for their third album and after evaluating the situation decided to call it quits." At least two of the band members will be pursuing solo careers or other projects. 

Agnete has a new band - Djerv.
