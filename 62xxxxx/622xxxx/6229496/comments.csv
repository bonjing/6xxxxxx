,orgnlchc,2011-03-09T12:54Z,"The site is updated, of course. Only problem (as I see it) is the comments section. It's pretty unorganized and needs a fresh look and probably an incentive for users to comment on the quality, fakes and the movies/shows in general. 

Thanks for the torrent, upper))"

,killersushi,2011-03-12T11:20Z,I'm confused. Is this season 1? I can't find any other season 2 torrents of this show at all. That and it says 2009 so why does it say s02?
