"O'Leary's Cow"

After a teenage boy is brutally murdered while
spreading the word of his church in Chinatown,
Detectives Wysocki and Evers enlist
Superintendent Colvin to gain the cooperation of
locals. When the unofficial mayor of Chinatown
is uncooperative, Alderman Gibbons is called
upon to broker a deal that accelerates the
investigation. Meanwhile, Teresa's brother-in-
law (guest star Rockmond Dunbar) rolls the dice
with a shady business deal, and Liam goes even
deeper undercover.
