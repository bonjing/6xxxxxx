Storyline: 

When their owner clears out his bedroom in preparation for starting college, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the toy-box gang are dumped in the donations box at a local nursery school 
and find themselves at the mercy of a horde of wild, sticky-fingered toddlers. 
As they struggle to stay together while coping with the chaos, the gang meet a new bunch of toys led by pink teddy bear Lotso, while Barbie is at last united with her male counterpart, Ken. 
The yearning to return home cannot be ignored, however, and many comical adventures ensue as the toys make a series of elaborate escape attempts.
