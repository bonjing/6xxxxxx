And thanks for your work."

It's not a noob question - it's one I'm sure plenty of people would like to ask but a lot have been flamed for doing so.

It's all about the aspect ratio which isn't supplied in the description of most movie torrents (for this movie it's not even listed on imdb)...

In this case it's 2.40:1 (2.4 horizontal pixels for every 1 vertical pixel). So if you take 1920 and divide it by 2.40 you get 800. Hence the 1920x800 resolution.

I'm not sure how it looks on plasma, lcd/led lcd tv's. I have a HD CRT (the very last of its kind)... she's got a big ass but boy does she look great.

,beliha,2011-05-22T16:29Z,"1920x800 is how it came in the original BluRay release! 

like gvim said, its a 2.4:1 ratio, which is what movies made for theaters are filmed in, instead of the 1.7:1 ratio which is the standard BluRay/HDDVD ratio used for home viewing, called: Anamorphic widescreen. 

Unfortunately, because of the non forward thinking and politics of Audio/Video companies who have a controlling stake in setting these formats, we have to lose a great deal of our TV size to those letterboxes when viewing a 1920x800 movie that was filmed for theaters. So if you have a 50 inch TV, and you watch this, you are in actuality watching a 46 inch TV, because 6 inches were lost due to the difference in formats.

Not sure why HDTVs aren't made to match the movie theater's ratio. It was just a stupid decision from these companies."
