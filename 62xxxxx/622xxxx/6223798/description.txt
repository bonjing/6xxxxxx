This sounds like KJP's most personal and rewarding album to date. If you would want to put it in a catagory it would be somewhere between "alt.country" and "acoustic blues" but it's more than that. The tracks are mostly acoustic, three of them just Kelly Joe and guitar, sometimes added bass, harmonium, a subtle drum. No instrumental fireworks, just enough notes to accentuate the melody . On a few tracks there's a banjo or a melodica. The most important side of this album is the beautiful storytelling.
