We Dare is the name of this curious game in which up to 2 couples may participate in many different mini-games, ranging from the popular game of the apple, until lap dances. 


As you can see, the Nintendo Wii has gone from playing tennis spanking in less than anyone had imagined. Clearly, if you are at least a little jealous, this game will not be suitable for you (much less for your partner.) On the other hand, can be a great way to end the night if you are at home with a friend and two other friends. 

With 40 different games, grouped in various levels ranging from adventure and intelligence to the seduction and the tone actually spent. 

A great idea for couples swingers for singles, for which she is home alone with 3 friends, but not for the user with a girlfriend and no desire to see how another man gives a lap dance. 

Fortunately for those who have a partner, there is the obvious solution to purchase only two controls (if you have 4 controllers, then two should be hidden where nobody can find them), or to buy the PS3 version, which can only play for 2 people. 

If you live somewhere that is not framed within the European continent, then do not get your hopes up, as this dirty game will be released only on European territory and for now, no information to indicate otherwise. 

At the end you leave a video for that you get to know it all about, and watch the finish, which brings a very good surprise."

,e5frog,2011-03-11T14:52Z,"I agree, doesn't work. Have softmodded Wii and uLoader, got through settings and then it freezed on the loading screen. Seems to hang when you try to handle avatars as well.
If anyone at all manage to get this version running, please tell us how.
Moving on to attempt number three:

,zafira12,2011-03-11T17:16Z,"This does work from usb you need to use Mighty loader which i downloaded from

http://usuaris.tinet.cat/mark/mopok.cgi?article=mighty_loader_english 

Then unzip the file and place the Mighty Loader file in the apps folder of the sd card and load from the homebrew channel."

,e5frog,2011-03-12T14:35Z,"Updated to uLoader 5.1E, ios222 freezes after logo, with ios223 it continues through setup and then freeze at ""Loading...""
I'm trying that WBFS version linked to.
I have never had to change ios before, this has been the first time.

It would be strange if Mighty Loader from a year ago works (game actually starts after setup) when it uses the same work by Waninoko as uLoader does... 

Maybe the firmware revision of the Wii is important."

,jujunice1,2011-05-15T08:10Z,work very welll thanks uploader without u the world is impossible
,azazeal90,2011-06-15T13:17Z,"THIS MIGHT HELP YOU FIX IT-------------------------

I used ""cIOSX_rev21"" and chose IOS 249. Then the ""IOS 58 v????"" and installed it on IOS 249. 

I used Mighty Loader v 15 to play. But this action made the USB Loader GX unable to start. 

Same with Coverfloader

IMPORTANT: if you do this fix you'll have to use Mighty Loader. "
,raido01,2011-07-24T18:45Z,Works with mighty loader v16
