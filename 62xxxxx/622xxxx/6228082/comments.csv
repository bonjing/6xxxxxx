,kingofny,2011-03-08T14:48Z,HR's copy has no subtitles? how are u supposed to watch that? its like watching kill bill witout subs for the chinese
,iPod87,2011-03-08T16:01Z,"I think you mean the Japanese in Kill Bill kingofny.

Don't be so harsh on HR he's a great uploader and in his defense none of the BR Defiance rips I've seen had English subs for the Russian.

Though HR doesn't usually have soft subtitles for his uploads I'm glad his most recent upload of Hereafter had subs for the French.

,kingofny,2011-03-08T18:34Z,hey ur not gonna hear any complaints about HR from me hes my chief uploader
,souls2deny,2011-03-09T00:37Z,"HR's copy of defiance in question was uploaded over 2 years ago, and the reason it didn't contain subs was because it was a dvd screener and was uploaded while the movie was still in theaters. 

For the most part HR's uploads with movies that contain foreign speaking have subs in English that are hardcoded in the file. 

Anyway, ipod87 your doing a great job with your ups, keep up the good work. "

I always wait for HR's BR rips rather than settle for the DVDSCR if I can because they are always of the best quality."
