A.R. Rahman's score for Danny Boyle's "127 Hours" is one that utterly transcends expectations. A fluid mix of many genres, the soundtrack album combines Rahman's music with pieces by Free Blood, Bill Withers, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Esther Phillips, and Sigur Ros. A.R. Rahman captures the emotional intensity and pace of this film in the sounds he creates.
