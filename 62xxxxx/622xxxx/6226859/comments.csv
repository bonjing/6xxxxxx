,nsatampa,2011-03-08T17:12Z,"Ya, its definitely a different sound for them, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it..."
,twiztid_clown65340,2011-03-08T19:41Z,"eh, its ok I guess, just hope they don't sing this when I see em April 22nd lol I seen em last year too but this wasn't out yet obviously"
,djdj1723,2011-03-08T21:46Z,The song is definitely growing on me the more I listen to it.  Thanks for getting it out so quickly.  I can't wait for their new album to come out.  They're my favorite band by far.  I love these guys.
,djdj1723,2011-03-08T21:47Z,Nsatampa...thank you!  I agree...it continues to grow on me as I've listened to it for the past hour or so.  This is my favorite band ever and I can't wait till the new album comes out.

[T],PeteSapai,2011-03-09T03:40Z,"Love Seether! This song indeed differs somewhat from the usual stuff, but I think I like it.
Oh, and I wouldnt call this 'good quality', it's actually pretty bad (but if you can't hear it, just enjoy it :))"
,bil_gr7,2011-03-11T18:40Z,"Cool song, I can't wait for their new album!"
,NickNLCA,2011-03-31T23:45Z,"Yeah, it's pretty poor quality. It's good for now, though. Enjoy it until a better leak happens."
