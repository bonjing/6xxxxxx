Found this rare item on some other tracker... enjoy!

Throne of Chaos, a band from Finland that has changed it's style quite a bit over their three official album releases.

This torrent contains these three albums (192kbps mp3):
2000 - Menace and prayer
2002 - Pervertigo
2003 - Loss Angeles

First album has been compared to Children of Bodom - technical/progressive thrash/death metal with growl...

Second album is more power metal-ish, and even has the Dream Evil singer (Niklas Isfeldt) singing lead on several tracks. Still some growling here and there though.

Third album is even more power metal, almost symphonic at times, slower tempo in general and not much growl at all.

All three records are _really good stuff_ though, so if you're a cross-genre listener you'll probably appreciate all three!

Too bad they quit in 2005... let's hope they give it another try!
