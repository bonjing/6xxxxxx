,dzlrules,2011-03-10T18:15Z,"Dude, I had to check and make sure this wasn't a FOX rebroadcast. Outstanding quality. The pre-race show was a bonus too! Thanks again, brother! Normally, I'll only seed to a 1:1 but yours get at least 2:1

Will you be capping the hour show this weekend, between vegas and bristol?"
,jameshotwire,2011-03-11T17:25Z,"Thanks for all the replies and excellent seeding.  @ mmg113 probably not doing the formula 1 season, I don't have cable or satellite, I get these from regular over the air broadcast ATSC.  @ DZLrules the 1 hour show this weekend yes,  will name it: Daytona 500 The American Dream HDTV_JHW .

,jameshotwire,2011-03-13T19:42Z,"LOL 420, ya know I upload something like smallville and have 1000's download it, and maybe get 1 comment if I'm lucky.  I do be feeling the love on these Nascar releases LOL and I like it. 

On another note ""Daytona 500 The American Dream"" failed to record sadly, I believe due to day light savings time change that happened today. "
