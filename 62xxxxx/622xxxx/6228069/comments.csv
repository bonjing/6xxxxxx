http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5789086/Worms_Reloaded-SKIDROW
is it missing something?"
,Umalo123,2011-06-29T18:51Z,"Installed ok. Sound works on Win7. Can't start LAN game. Tried with Steam tricks. Any suggestions. (not firewalled, antivirus stooped.) Anyone made multiplayer via router. Any port to be forwarded specificly to this this game?
Thanks. Good torrent. Hope will learn how to play on LAN "

THE COMPRESSION IS HIGHER
ANY INSTALLER HAS AN OPTION TO DEAL WITH COMPRESSION RATIO
SMALL SIZES MAY EXTRACT SLOWLY BUT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF A SMALLER FINGERPRINT ON HDD.
THIS IS SKIDROW TOO !
THE UPDATE INTEGRATED IT IS SKIDROW'S ONE
I used lzma2/ultra switch compression, hope you get it timoe14 ? ;)"
