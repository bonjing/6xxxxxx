The torrent, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6219140 has a shortcut to
the bootit NG image but NOT the file itself!

This torrent is the missing file, bootitng.iso which creates the
Bootit NG boot CD onto a blank CD.  You need a CD or DVD burner
and burning software.

Without this software you cannot restore the image of Vista onto 
a spare 80 GB HD.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
