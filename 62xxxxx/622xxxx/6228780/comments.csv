hard coded subs 
only downfall is it's an MKV file instead of MP4 or AVI which would play on my XBOX or PS3 but i just converted the movie to AVI "
,st0gey,2011-09-29T19:32Z,"Thank you thank you thank you for uploading this f***ing great movie! Blair Witch style movie-making but does NOT take itself too seriously, and is oh so much the better for it :) CGI is good, acting is great as is the script. It's a real gem!

A/8
V/8
M/7.5

English subs are indeed hardcoded. They're not perfect but they're more than adequate and certainly don't remove from the overall entertainment.  If you can handle subtitles (i.e. if you're from anywhere other than the U.S.) you should watch this movie!"

,xeno100,2012-01-26T21:00Z,"Why oh why is this MKV. Won't play on a PS3 or on a normal DVD player. Not all of us are teenagers that want to sit in our bedrooms watching a movie on a computer screen.

Convert it then. I've downloaded a number of avi converters and none of them seem to be able to convert from MKV to AVI properly. "

Thanks for film!!!! "

,UnlceACAB,2012-03-11T21:28Z,"Those complaining about the format: 1. It's free, you shouldn't complain; 2. Use VLC to play it (VLC plays anything) and if you want to watch it on a TV, just buy a cheap HDMI cable to link your PC to your TV. VERY EASY TO DO."
