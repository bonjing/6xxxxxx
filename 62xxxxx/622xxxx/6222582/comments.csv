crimson85067 doesn't have a clue what 720p means.  The movie IS in fact FULL 720p (1280x720).  720P refers to the vertical resolution, the number of vertical scan lines, it has nothing whatsoever to do with quality.  

Now, as far as the quality goes, it's ok but not perfect to be sure.  There is noticeable macro blocking in the heavy action scenes.  It's slightly lower quality than what you'd expect for a 2.4GB 1280x720 XviD encoded movie (XviD being the primary factor in the lower quality aside from the file size/bit rate).  

The reason that it's slightly lower that what you'd expect for this file size is that it was ripped with 640Kbps 6ch audio, rather than a standard 384Kbps or even 448Kbps.  This consumes roughly an extra 200K of the file size, or about 500K total just for the audio track.  That leaves only about 1.9GB for the video track, just too low for a full 720p XviD movie.  

That file size would've been perfect if it was encoded with an H.264 codec, but DivX is only about 60% as efficient, so it would've needed to be close to 4GB.  That said, this is still the best torrent around currently for this movie.  "
