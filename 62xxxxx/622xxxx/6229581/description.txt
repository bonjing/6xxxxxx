Synopsis
Electra (Mari TÃ¶rÃ¶csik) is considered mad because she mourns the loss of her father, Agamemnon, and roams the countryside accusing the new king Aegisthus of murder. She constantly claims that her brother Orestes will return to right the injustice and expel the usurper who rules the country with an iron fist. A messenger brings word that Orestes is dead, but soon thereafter he appears, to do exactly what the 'mad' Electra has foretold.
