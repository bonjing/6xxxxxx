Get all the interviews you want-instantly!
It's a jungle out there-a jobjungle. You're crouching-and grouching-waiting impatiently to attack the next job that appears. You hear a rustle through the trees and hold your breath. Something movesâ€”but before you can pounce, it's gone. Each time you get better and better...at blowing interviews.

Is that you? Why? What are you waiting for? You could be having more fun and more success than you've ever had in your life! Instant Interviews turns you into an interview magnet. If you're going to use traditional lead sources like the Internet, classified ads, or job fairs, this book will supercharge their effectiveness. You'll stop waiting for something to happen and start making it happen yourself..............
