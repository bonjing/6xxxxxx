The Solution to run pokemon white and black on no$Gba with save fixes (in Game Saving) Fully Working, i tried getting the game to work until i found the real solution, this is just a text file so its virus free, the problem was with the noba.ini settings, copy the ones in the text and use the ar codes and your game will work fine, i even tried the poke sav for pokemon white and im playing with lugia and mewtwo even tho they dont exist in game, more info on pokesav and how to get all the pokemon from any game version or unlimited master balls is here on this link, much lovin for all em pokemon players.
