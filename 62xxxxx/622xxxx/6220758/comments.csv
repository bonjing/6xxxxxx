which fucking game?!
you forgot the most important information from the name of your torrent. 
because ""the solution"" is more important to mention."
,TombRaiderAddict,2011-03-05T12:18Z,I replaced the text but what do I do with the ar codes?
,misery89,2011-03-05T12:24Z,"hahaha sorry i tried editing the torrent but editing is disabled, its for pokemon white and black lol, im playing white right now on gba with incredible speed, im battling the fourth gym :P"
,misery89,2011-03-05T12:26Z,"when u start no$gba press F2 add the codes as action replay Raw and reset the emulator, once u reset retick the codes, u have to do t his everytime u reopen the emulator"

,zxkb4s29,2011-03-06T17:54Z,"dude, i dont want to read the description for EVERY torrent uploaded, only whose title interests me.

i imagine you in a bookstore, reading through every book because you just dont need blurbs."
,ze_bony,2011-03-07T11:59Z,"Works perfectly, and the performance difference between no$gba and desmume is huge. Well worth the trouble."
,D0gmeat,2011-03-07T23:13Z,"@zxkb4s29: Don't have to read the description, just read the tags. Or download a text to speech app. YYY."

**QUESTiON**

I pressed F2, copied and pasted the text in the box, selected Action Replay DS, selected RAW and I go to press ok and it's not letting me enter it... Although, if I select Codebreaker, it will let me do it, but then the emulator shuts down... Can you or someone here just give a SIMPLE step by step way to make this work?? Much appreciated.. Thanks."
