,Wolf069,2011-05-07T04:17Z,"DL is good,but the program is pretty much worthless."
,msmojomaster,2011-05-28T01:06Z,"hi,the download is good and working,but the program itself has a defect,when you click on a word to translate,the program doesn't catch the entire word but only one letter or more,like if you click on on some word,it will try to translate the letter your mouse was on "
,Cracker_Jak,2011-09-04T23:57Z,"Thank you, Clean but I expected that. I've downed a few of your ups and they have all worked and all your cracks are clean. And this program is hardly useless so don't believe the wolfman and try for yourself.
Peace"
