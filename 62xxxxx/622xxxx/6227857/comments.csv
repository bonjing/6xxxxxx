[T],extremezone,2011-03-08T12:47Z,i must say i didn't tested (files are on seedboxes) but i've read about this on some private trackers and release sites and seems it's working fine
,jastor,2011-03-08T13:08Z,"When I view the header of the file I find this: the MDX file is a rar file containing sr-codbo.iso (call of duty black ops from skidrow).

So I label this as fake."
,FearedNightmare,2011-03-08T13:15Z,seed please downloading at 50kb/s and its dropping
[T],extremezone,2011-03-08T13:21Z,yeah sure...don't take in serious this spammers
,RafiDLer,2011-03-08T13:23Z,"What does ""Theta"" mean?"
,ChrisBear,2011-03-08T13:50Z,The Crack is done by Theta! Thats who did the Crack!
,teddy45,2011-03-08T13:57Z,is ths really the whole game?
,RhymesMatter,2011-03-08T14:03Z,"@RafiDLer 

THETA stands for the Hellenic (Greek) letter ""Î""
What i am curious about (in srsly i am saying this out of curiousity) are those THETA guys known?and how come That non of the known suspects (RELOADED-SKIDROW-RAZOR1911) haven't been the first ones to do the crack?Plz don't bash i am not ungrateful or anything i just ask :S"
,Josha5000,2011-03-08T14:07Z,Theta is a group that cracked the game.
,SgtSposh,2011-03-08T14:18Z,cant get past the tutorial with the theta rls :(
,kriswr19,2011-03-08T14:25Z,does it include the dlc's?
,ChrisBear,2011-03-08T14:28Z,the game I have off skidrowcracks works before the site got taken down again works. But I will let you chose who to download from. I respect Extremezone and his uploads. So your chocie.
,FearedNightmare,2011-03-08T14:31Z,"i love how the screenshots could be taken from the demo but im downloading to check it out however it will take like a week going at 20kb/s

,FearedNightmare,2011-03-08T15:14Z,zosaria its only like the first 0.5% i think thats slow like that if u use Âľtorrent click on the red cross to minimise it to your tray and the upload speed will go up to 600kb/s
,egervari,2011-03-08T15:15Z,"I dunno about this. Even if it works, I'm still scared to run it."
,Klimt_Westwood,2011-03-08T15:23Z,Does anyone know why TPB deleted that Black Emporium torrent? Was it fake/virus?
,devrindare,2011-03-08T15:39Z,"I am not believing what other saying

,Vvornth,2011-03-08T16:43Z,"Works great for me with DirectX 11 :)

,davian07,2011-03-08T16:45Z,guys i'm in the game but my WSAD keys don't work... i tried setting the movement arrows as primary and wsad as secondary but it still doesn't work... any thoughts?
,moldybudz,2011-03-08T16:48Z,"Crack works. Thanks THETA! I was actually going to buy this game, but I went down to EB Games and Gamestop and neither were selling it! They both informed me that they rarely sell PC games in the store anymore (I hadn't been to either store in a very long time). And developers wonder why people pirate! Why should I be punished to have to buy a copy online and get it shipped to me (I like physical boxed copies of the few games I actually buy, I bought Dragon Age: Origins in store boxed) and have to wait when PS3 and XBOX owners can go to the same store I was in and pickup their copy no problem? Thanks THETA for helping me play this amazing game where traditional methods have failed. Now I can play offline too on my plane rides!"
,zakonodavac,2011-03-08T18:06Z,8.0 kb/s ... this is so slow ... :(
,Urban_Ninja,2011-03-08T18:35Z,At this rate i can try the game in 6 weeks :/
,neonazgul,2011-03-08T18:40Z,"Humm i'm going with a stable 1,8 mb."
,majinbuxl,2011-03-08T18:43Z,"@moldybudz
EB games and Gamestop haven't been selling PC games for quite some time. If they do, its usually a very very, VERY limited selection. They never sold many PC games because their prices are too expensive and they never have any sales going on. Also, buying from an online store (steam, amazon, etc) then downloading the game directly to your PC has become pretty much a mainstream thing these days because its usually pretty cheap and you don't have to worry about hoarding dvds anymore."
,Addaxx,2011-03-08T19:34Z,"Go download the RELOADED version guys, just click on extremezone VIP profile, you should see it... It's the second upload that he made. It's faster, deeper, and also very nasty. ;)"
,Aledd,2011-03-08T20:36Z,Is this best one around atm? or is there better :)
,Tulizx,2011-03-08T21:01Z,"Been playing for a couple of hours, no problems so far.

,ImSoJaded,2011-03-09T22:22Z,"It works fine, although I used the Reloaded crack. Word of advice: nVidia users should grab the latest beta drivers, otherwise I was told Dx11 might be choppy/unplayable. Get the high-res textures from BioWare site. Runs nice so far. Thanks, extremezone!!"

,chip211,2011-03-12T01:36Z,pogaru if you have a single core processor you will have to download a patch but you have to wait because it needs to be cracked
,zazes,2011-03-12T06:53Z,"If you have a quad-core, set your cpu to use only 2 cores and you should be able to save. Auto-save doesn't seem to work though. Alt-Ctrl-Dlt, Task manager, and set affinity for dragon age process."
,Pogaru,2011-03-12T08:37Z,"@chip211
Yes, I have single core processor. Thanks for info.
I'll wait this damn patch :D"
,chip211,2011-03-12T23:05Z,"@Pogaru
the patch is on and working but needs the crack

=s"
,MaikinhoBr,2011-03-13T15:53Z,Waiting Crack For V1.01
,Omanon,2011-03-13T16:07Z,"Waiting for 1.01 fix as well. Wish I knew how to do it myself. I thought it'd be a quick crack to make since DA2 was cracked on release, then again Shogun 2 is being released soon so I suppose that the established and larger groups focus their work on other titles since this one was already cracked once."
,karol321,2011-03-14T05:28Z,works perfectly on win 7 ultimate thanx good torrent!
,katniss85,2011-03-14T10:24Z,"could someone upload that crack to some other place, its just not downloading for me :("
,TheQCurse,2011-03-14T17:33Z,"The product key is not working for me, how do I fix that?"
,Omanon,2011-03-14T20:47Z,"Since I got told it was safe I tried the link finally as I do have some responsibility for providing it.
Quick played through the intro and tried saving once you start your own character. I can confirm it. Saving in 1.01 works thanks to that file. Seems I win at internet today. ^_^
Go forth minions, thank the asians and play DA2!"
,tannerest56,2011-03-18T04:59Z,I have the game downloaded but when I launch it it tells me I have to enter the product key to activate it. None of the serials work. How may I get through this obstacle?
,zsenie,2011-04-08T02:54Z,"does not work. when i install the game and start playing, another cd key is required and none work!
