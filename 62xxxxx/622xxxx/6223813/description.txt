NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Drive Angry 2011....

Heres our v2 .....but this time using the cinedub release 

Video is sharper than the other release but has issues aswell...first it's cropped alot more,secondly

is has a scrolling pulse that last for a few secs every now and again.

Video was also over bright and had lots of glare.

We fixed what we could and then resynced the line audio to this release ...
