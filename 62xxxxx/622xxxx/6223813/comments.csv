V:6/7
Totaly watchable :) Thanks....."
,wayneking,2011-03-07T23:08Z,"Not a great TS imo.  

A 6  V 6 for by cam standards probably fair.  That strange pulse is not too big a deal as it's only several times throughout the film and only for a couple of seconds each time.  All in all very watchable especially for a brand new release,  but not a DL for the snobs.

Thanks a lot for the UL froggie100.  Your work is much appreciated."
,vernernet,2011-03-08T05:47Z,"I rate this as(for a cam):

V\8
A\7

Also watch all cam rips on my dell widescreen pc monitor....don't know what it may look like on tv.

Very watchable.
Thanks for the uP!"

,stonertodd1989,2011-03-10T23:26Z,thanks dude
,uStoopidShit,2011-03-11T00:50Z,"Horrible quality, screen flickers very often and brightness is off the charts, dont be fooled by these other peoples ratings. Movie is UN-WATCHABLE on iMAC 27. sound is alright tho."
,prash1989,2011-03-11T05:00Z,tell me abt the movie its watchable or not.
,skiba_,2011-03-11T17:49Z,"The title is ridicolous, but once I saw Nic Cage was starring, it all made sense"
,RWAB,2011-03-12T06:25Z,"stop rating TS as Cams dumb asses, TS are supposed to be close to dvd quality"
,superkop,2011-03-12T13:25Z,"@RWAB You are the dumb ass. TS doesn't refer to the video quality at all. It means Telesync. Uses a camera to record, but uses an external audio source. Before you start insulting people, you should probably do research. Hopefully you just have it mixed up with R5. R5 refers to a regional code. That of the former Soviet Union. R5 = DVD. It is the same copy you would get from a DVDRIP. Please do your homework before you make yourself look like a fool."
,kreem,2011-03-12T19:10Z,"Man - Nicholas Cage has been in some shit films but this one takes the biscuit - it's utter garbage. 

V-7 (very watchable for a cam)
A-4 (bit tinny and distorted)
M-2 - utter shite.

Thanks for the up tho."
,uStoopidShit,2011-03-12T21:47Z,I stopped watching 20 mins in. Waiting for better copy.
,squirtbox,2011-03-14T05:05Z,very watchable...
,Cgoff87,2011-03-14T18:04Z,"The video is good, but the audio not so much.

For TS (Everybody's a critic)
8/V 2/A

If someone can go into the theater with an audio tape recorder the audio can be added to make this perfect."
,CapnCajun,2011-03-15T04:12Z,after I DLed this and tried to watch it my Windows Explorer would shutdown everytime I went to the file with all my movies in it and if i managed to click the avi file before it closed it and windows media player tried to play WMP would get an error and shutdown a well. any explanations?

,JoedaMoe,2011-04-09T00:15Z,thanks for uploading this torrent.
,B.Genaaid,2011-04-12T16:05Z,"@CapnCajun
That is because your xvid codec creates an error with your Divx codec.
Solution open a non avi folder, set view of that folder to list (files) and then apply to all folders those settings.
Open now your avi folder and it will not crash.
to play... open power dvd or similar (NOT WMP) and select the file from within the players menu and play..... 
So maybe you are a bit wiser now and not so stupid to delete all your files for totally nothing .... well, if you are that stupid, you deserve it. :)"
,B.Genaaid,2011-04-12T16:20Z,submit comment gives error on page...
,B.Genaaid,2011-04-12T16:22Z,"@CapnCajun
You must be the dumbest *ss around here, just put your folder view on list instead of thumbnails and switch off folder/file preview.
Its the codec causing your explorer to crash."
,B.Genaaid,2011-04-12T16:24Z,but it seems to work anyway... 
,SYMatkal,2011-04-20T17:09Z,"@DazDemon, and everyone else trolling here, different groups specialize in different things. FXG specializes in DVDRips, and IMAGiNE focuses on being the first release out there, so of course there's sometimes a tradeoff in quality. For the next month or so, this will be all you'll get, as the other copies out there all rip off IMAGiNE's release.
""if you trying to compete with the other uploaders then you lose!"" He is one of the main ULers of IMAGiNE releases, hence the green skull. Stop trying to talk like you're an experienced torrentor."
