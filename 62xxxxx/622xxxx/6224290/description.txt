From Manchester and part of the Hang Cool tour this is a nice audience recording. I didn't call it Hang Cool in Manchester because of the lack of songs from that album. In fact this registration only has the performance of  'Song of Madness' from the Hang Cool album. The video is shot from the back of the arena balcony. Thanks to the many zooms it's still very watch able.  Sound is also ok for an audience recording.
