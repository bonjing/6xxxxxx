"Jewish themes" in the films of MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³:

JancsÃ³'s recurring interest in Jewish culture is one aspect of his work that has consistently been overlooked by most criticsâ€”including Hungarian ones. GyÃ¶rgy BÃ¡ron reflects on the director's hitherto unrecognised obsession.

"Jewish themes"? Let's put the term in quotes, because what would count as a "theme"? The Hungarian-themed SzegÃ©nylegÃ©nyek (The Round Up, 1965)? The Russian (Soviet) Csillagosok katonÃ¡k (Red and the White, 1967)? The Italian La Pacifista (1970)? If we discuss detention camps, is that a "Jewish theme"? Or what about the love of two Israeli citizens? And are these films actually about whatâ€”per seâ€”their theme is?

In the oeuvre of MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³, films with a so-called "Jewish theme" (regardless of what we mean by this) play a major role, from the three-part JelenlÃ©t ( Presence) that he began in 1965 and finished in 1985, through to the half dozen pieces of the KÃ¶vek Ã¼zenete (Message of Stones) series that he made at the beginning of the 1990s, L'Aube (The Dawn, 1985) taking place in Palestine, and two new documentaries with the titles ElmondtÃ¡k-e? (Have You Been Told?, 1995) and ZsoltÃ¡r (Psalm, 1996). Throughout a hundred-odd years of film history, no other significant film director has made so many documentaries with an almost monomaniacal attachment to the same theme.

Why is it, then, that this conspicuous body of work in the JancsÃ³ oeuvre is surrounded by a wall of cautious silence? Is it because of the "theme"? Is it about the usual restraint, confused looking aside? Or do we feel that JancsÃ³ is being an unauthorised tourist in the area? Is the undeniable inconsistency in the quality of these works the reason for the bashful silence? Would it be embarrassing to applaud the "good intentions" of this great director?

The first part of the JelenlÃ©t series, to my mind, is immeasurably heavier and deeper than the second and third one. From the KÃ¶vek Ã¼zenete series, the MÃ¡ramaros or the Moldavia travelogue is probably weaker and more superficial than the one about Budapest. The structural form of ZsoltÃ¡r is more delicate and fragile than ElmondtÃ¡k-e?, another Holocaust story and one shot on the same location. But if the work is uneven, why is it that we don't at least mention the worthy parts of this section of JancsÃ³'s work?.... KinoEye
