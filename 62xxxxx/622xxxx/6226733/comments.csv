,AGHOR,2011-05-20T16:19Z,How do you run the emulator. Pls assist. I have extracted the files.
,Yenrock7,2011-05-29T16:03Z,I only hope a tutorial for noob is included in this torrent. It will really come in handy.
,takitos123,2011-06-06T06:30Z,"I recommend using PSX v1.13 for this game as it wouldn't need any plugins like ePSXe,especially if u r not sure of what plugins to use in ePSXe.

to run games in psx, click file and choose ""insert cd image"" then find the directory of ur chosen game.

you can change some config in the ""configuration"" menu under the file."
,anydream,2011-07-29T16:22Z,Can anyone tell me if both discs included in that .7z file? The file size seems way too small even for 7z compression.
,anydream,2011-07-29T18:09Z,Well it seems there is a .bin file for each disc.
,Fenr1r,2011-09-21T14:40Z,"Thanks dude!
I really wanted to play this game after I beat Chrono Trigger."
,Mangachaos,2011-09-27T05:52Z,"I downloaded it and tried it. Seems totally fine to me. May be since I got the better emulator for it I guess. Thanks for uploading it. Many thanks!


AGHOR - You use the .bin file and play them as iso ones. However it may be troublesome to switch discs with them...  .cue is a better choice when it comes to that since you only use your deamontools and switch ""cds"" through that instead. Afterwards you just need to save and you can use the iso or bin file again.
