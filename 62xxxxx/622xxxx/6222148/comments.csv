This is either gonna be really good or suck major ass. I do THANK miguel1983 for the upload and THANKS to all you seeders out there!! After I watch I will comment on A/V & M quality. Love, DrScott"

I first thought - well, learn to translate words a little better there *upman* or maybe learn to type a little better - then, after reading the first comment from wizzkid1970 I burst into laughter.

scottsasse said *A tire falls in love with a woman???* - No, I thought - I checked out IMDB and - YUP, no foolin, no typo - just STUNNED at the accuracy of the movie plot !"
,scottsasse,2011-03-06T21:09Z,"Wow this movie sucked! I am now 45% dumber for having watched this movie. And to think I could have beat off, ate lunch, beat off, smoked a cigarette, beat off, taken a shower and beat off again instead!! UR-dejavu was thinking what I was thinking, this HAS to be a typo. Well boys and girls it's NOT!! In fact the ending left room for a sequel. Rubber II, Rubber Does Hollywood!!!! C'mon Frenchie don't bury your toxic waste in my back yard and I wont shit in yours!!"
