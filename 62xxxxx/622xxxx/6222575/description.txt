Brett and Mandy are engaged to be married and have three young daughters. Mandy says from the outside, they appear to have it all together, but the reality is far different.  Brett says heâ€™s addicted to sex, online pornography and talking dirty to other women. He says his fiancÃ©e, Mandy, isnâ€™t meeting his needs and uses his indiscretions as an excuse to push him away. Mandy says Brett is a liar and a cheater, and itâ€™s difficult for her to be intimate with him.  Mandy says she knows that Brett has been physical with two other women during their relationship, and sheâ€™s caught him multiple times communicating with women online or through texting, but does she know all of his secrets? Brett admits heâ€™s still lying to Mandy and has something to reveal.
