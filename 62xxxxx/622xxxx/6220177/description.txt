Use Your Illusion II is the fourth studio album by hard rock band Guns N' Roses. It was one of two albums released in conjunction with the Use Your Illusion Tour, and as a result the two albums are sometimes considered a double album. Bolstered by lead single "You Could Be Mine", Use Your Illusion II was the slightly more popular of the two albums, selling 770,000 copies its first week and debuting at #1 on the U.S. charts, ahead of Use Your Illusion I's first week sales of 685,000. Both albums have since been certified 7x Platinum by the RIAA. It was also #1 on the UK Albums Chart for a single week.

For some reason most of the Guns n Roses torrents here were made by people with tin ears. That is why I'm offering this in the .flac format. The files are small, but there is NO lost of sound. Making these perfect to burn to CD. I will be offering 2 more Guns n Roses torrents for those who are critical like me. I posted this one first because i have seen several request for this one.

Mp3 is dead! Long live Flac!!!
