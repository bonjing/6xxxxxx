,Baron1981pl,2011-03-11T12:32Z,"A few days ago appeared Homefront-SKIDROW torrent and i have downloaded it. Installation is different from that with Steam, but it still requires a key. The key is in the folder with the crack, but it is packed with zip. and needs a key to unpack it. everything seems correct in this folder are files: Steamclient.dll, steam_appid.txt, keygen.exe, Click For Password.url, Binaries"
,SweatyGremlins,2011-03-11T13:27Z,"@Baron1981pl

I think you downloaded the iso which will install the non Steam version. 

I also found a crack that requires a password to unpack but could never complete the procedure to get the password. 

(and it copped a few Trojans in the process so grab MalawareBytes Anti-Malaware and do a check if you tried)

I'm no expert but i don't think groups like SKIDROW make releases with passwords, if it was legit it would be here on The Pirate Bay anyway.

Hoping for Homefront and Shogun 2 releases soon, pre-ordered Crysis 2 too, so many good games this month."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-12T06:14Z,dude there is no non-steam version of this...
,AntiSyrum,2011-03-12T07:25Z,"yo guys know this game hasnt been released right? it comes out March 15, 2011"
,SweatyGremlins,2011-03-12T12:14Z,"Are you sure that there's no non Steam version? I thought they were releasing it on GWL as well, maybe that's a different game i was thinking of."
,kutjez,2011-03-13T01:36Z,"once and for all the n00bs out there:all the shit that requests for some sort of password,DUMP IT,FAKE!
Off course there will be a non steam version,on tthe 15th,when the game is released.BE PATIENT"
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-13T02:56Z,"dude the retail disc uses steam, u tell me where u can buy a non steam version, Use phoenix to unpack this,"
,SweatyGremlins,2011-03-13T05:20Z,"Yeah i looked through google and it looks like it was going to be released under both Steam and GFWL but switched to just Steam.

Thats better for us, only one crack to worry about."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-13T06:09Z,"means u'll have to learn how to use phoenix extract or wait for a customized pirate iso, like the dow 2 one."
,fabriciorasta,2011-03-15T02:28Z,hey guys..friends..the Phoenix now extract corretly !!! yeah...Phoenix work now....Update the Phoenix and unpack..Work now..Work now....yeah

,Guillo_89,2011-03-17T21:22Z,"Ok, I'm having a problem.

After I unpacked with phoenix (1.5 beta3), I downloaded the steam fix unlock but I can't install it. Whenever I try to unpack the content to any folder an error comes up. It either says ""ERROR: archive data corrupted (decompression fails)"" (or something just like that), or it says ""CRC check failed"". Whatever the message, the thing is that I can't unpack the content, therefore I can't update the damn game. 

I've tried to google it but no one seems to be having this problem. If anyone gives me a solution, I would be extremely grateful..."
