Album notes
Every song that Carl Smith recorded during the '50s is included on Satisfaction Guaranteed, a five-disc, 143-track box set that stands as the most comprehensive retrospective of the honky tonk star's peak period. During the era that Satisfaction Guaranteed covers, Smith scored more Top 10 hits than either Hank Williams or Lefty Frizzell, and many of his best songs -- "Loose Talk," "Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way," "Hey Joe!," "Are You Teasing Me," and "(When You Feel Like You're In Love) Don't Just Stand There," among them -- are stone-cold honky tonk classics. For serious Smith and honky tonk fans, the set is essential, but the sheer length of the box -- not to mention its strict chronological sequence -- is tedious for anyone that isn't willing to dedicate the time to plow through the abundance of material here. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
