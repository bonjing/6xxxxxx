Notes:

 - Strangely (considering that it is based on true events and its influence on the civil rights movement of the early 1960's) this film is out of print. It was actually released on DVD, but with such a small run that it is generally thought that it never was. Even a used original DVD can cost hundreds of dollars.
 
 - Not my rip/encode. I found it elsewhere, but I think it should be here too. It's passable but I would have made the resolution a little higher. I'd re-encode it myself, but see above. ;^)

 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
