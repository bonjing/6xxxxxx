Let Me Come Home, the sophomore effort from Edinburgh, Scotlandâ€™s Broken Records, dials down the stadium-sized production that nearly swept away 2009â€™s promising Until the Earth Begins to Part and replaces it with a rawer, nervier feel that both helps and hinders the groupâ€™s painfully earnest blend of Springsteen-meets-Arcade Fire indie rock. Stripped of its nosebleed-section bleat, the band storms out of the gates with â€œA Leaving Song,â€ a spirited romp that will likely draw comparisons to fellow countrymen Frightened Rabbit. The songâ€™s build feels organic, and it dutifully sets the tone for what follows, even if what follows is fairly forgettable, despite the fact that the band obviously really, really wants to connect. Folk and country-tinged midtempo cuts like "Dia Dos Namarados!," "The Motorcycle Boy Reigns," and "I Used to Dream" are pretty enough, but outside of â€œA Leaving Songâ€ and the delightful, road trip-ready â€œA Darkness Rises Up,â€ Let Me Come Home never really develops into the lump in the throat it wants to be, though it certainly isnâ€™t for lack of trying.
