Swing would be reacquainted with its blues roots by way of Kansas City, when Count Basie and the Barons of Rhythm brought their hot sound to the Big Apple. Basie would also give Billie Holiday her first break, offering her a chance to travel, perform, drink, and gamble with the rest of the band. Another young singer named Ella Fitzgerald would get her start in Chick Webbâ€™s band at the Savoy Ballroom, and then be named top female vocalistâ€”over Billy Holidayâ€”by Down Beat in 1937.
