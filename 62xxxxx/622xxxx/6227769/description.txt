Ratt - Best of Me [promo 2010].VOB


HQ promo music video. "Best of Me" is a song from Infestation, the seventh studio album by American glam metal band Ratt. It is the band's first original effort since their self-titled album in 1999. It marks the Ratt studio debut for guitarist Carlos Cavazo, formerly of Quiet Riot. It was released by Roadrunner Records, a sub-label of their longtime home Atlantic Records.

In a March 18, 2010 interview with Metalholic Magazine, guitarist Warren DeMartini said of Infestation: "It really exceeded our expectations. Conceptually we kind of wanted to revisit the period of Out Of The Cellar and Invasion Of Your Privacy. We were sort of loosely trying to shoot for something that could fit between those two records. We were looking for more uptempo ideas and the double leads that Robbin Crosby and I started doing back in 1983."

Their 7th studio album, Infestation, was released April 20, 2010. In the US, the album debuted at #30 and sold over 13,000 copies the first week it was released. In Japan, the album charted at #5. The band is currently on an indefinite hiatus.
