John Coltrane, The Last Trane, 1965 (1989 - Prestige / Original Jazz Classics 394)


From the Album; "The Last Trane represents the final studio session for Prestige in the productive recording relationshipbetween John Coltrane and Red Garland. Often with trumpeter Donald Byrd on board, the two made a sucession of dates in 1957 and '58 in which Coltrane's genius could be heard developing. His celebrated job with Thelonious Monk had deepened his harmonic understanding and reinforced his determination to explore beyond the boundries of standard jazz improvisation. In his remarkable blues solo on "By the Numbers," Coltrane both affirms his roots and announces a new direction. Comparison with the other slow blues, "Slowtrane," made eght months earlier, is instructive.
