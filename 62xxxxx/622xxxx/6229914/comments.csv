,smarty100,2011-03-09T16:47Z,"plz add sample
thanks a lot"
,nameuser123,2011-03-10T12:38Z,"The sample is in the correct aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 - unless fake black bars have been added when uploaded (which I doubt).

Tron Legacy was released in the cinemas in three different aspect ratios so it's a bit confusing. But this upload appears to be in the full  2.35:1 wide screen ratio. :)"
,nameuser123,2011-03-10T12:45Z,The audio on the sample clip seems out of sync. A fraction out. I don't know if the file of the full film is the same.
,BetterThanLife,2011-03-11T15:28Z,"The ratio of the film switches back and forth, but that's not a problem. However, the sound is. it drives me bonkers when the lips don't align with their voices as it is throughout the movie"
