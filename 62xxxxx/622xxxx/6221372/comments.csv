My game is broken after changing my front pokemon, [ eg. changing Totodile to Weedle ] battling a trainer and after that it either hangs when talking to an npc, battling another trainer or walking out of a building. 

Do you know anyway to fix it 'cause I can't find any and I've tried searching but was unlucky. 

Everything works great except for that problem. Cheers!"

,Anonym099,2011-06-29T16:20Z,I hope this works on DeSmuME. I'll let you guys know.
,Titanium9533,2011-08-23T18:18Z,"The game freezes in the slowpoke well. Anyone know a way to fix this or a way around it? The game works fine apart from that, and this is the furthest I have got so far (this is my 5th download for soulsilver) all others have stopped working earlier on. This is getting really annoying that I can't find one that works, so if anyone knows of a fix for this one please tell me. "
