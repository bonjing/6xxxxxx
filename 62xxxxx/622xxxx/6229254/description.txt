After surviving Vietnam and the illegal fighting circuit, one man finds himself facing a whole new set of challenges in this action-drama. Billy Thomas (Lou_Ferrigno) is a kind soul who happens to have a colossal body -- and a remarkable talent for the martial arts. Tim Yum Lin (James_Shigeta) is leader of an underground crime syndicate who has dreamed up a way to profit from Billy's size and strength. Tim and his underlings kidnap Billy and hold him captive, telling him that his best friend has been killed and he must obey or he'll be next. Billy is forced to take on a number of brutal, fearless competitors in no-holds-barred cage matches held in an underground arena, with Tim's gang taking bets on the action. Billy handily wins the matches set up for him, but seeing no other way out, he makes a deal with Tim to bet on himself in an upcoming fight -- with Billy's freedom hanging in the balance. The Cage 2: Arena of Death also stars Shannon Lee, Reb Brown, and James Lew.
