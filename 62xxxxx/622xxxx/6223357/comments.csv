,s0mnambul1st,2011-03-07T02:46Z,"Guys, I need help.  I watch videos on my PS3.  I unmux the mkv file using mkv2vob software.  But recently, most mkv files are unwatchable on PS3.  On the PS3 menu, the preview icon shows the movie but when I start to watch, it doesn't play.  No error message whatsoever.  Please help."
,dj3scobar,2011-03-07T06:40Z,"This ain't a forum, go ask your questions bout mkv2vob elsewhere.

Thanks for the upload aoloffline! Hopefully 1080p isn't too far off.
"
,Phov,2011-03-07T14:29Z,Woah! Nice. Thanks. Will seed.
,Hazelton,2011-03-07T18:37Z,"@ s0mnambul1st

It's because you updated mkv2vob. You'll need to roll back the version 2.4.7. After you download that version disconnect from the internet and untick automatic update. 
 You can find it here : http://www.videohelp.com/tools/mkv2vob/o...s#download"

,satoshi101,2011-04-22T02:08Z,PLEASE READ: I have been using this site for a very long time now and I have never commented until now. After using this file I got a letter from my ISP. be warned.
,dyerphotos,2011-05-02T17:12Z,BE WARNED!!! this file has some sort of tracking...got a letter from ISP about copyright issues
,malhalla,2011-05-07T13:12Z,"Americans, please stop posting. Rest of the world don't give a rats arse if you get mail from your ISP.

The only tracking is in your IP, not in this upload.

Mask your IP or change ISP, move to a better country (any) or whatever.

Download and enjoy people!"
,NicolajEtlar,2011-06-09T21:00Z,"i dont get it is it a bill u get, or a warning?. "
,southak,2011-12-01T21:17Z,what malhalla said x 2
,lattari,2012-02-23T13:59Z,"@malhalla Thank you! Its so irritating to read comments demanding the uploader to DELETE a pperfectly good torrent because some american douche got a letter from Comcast. So here is a reminder:
Although some americans probably contribute to the site (thank you for that) its not all about you. I know, its an overwhelming concept, but with time you can get used to it. To stop the inconvenient letters, participate in getting some change in your local government or move and join the real world"
,sagamore9,2012-04-15T01:50Z,"use peerblock if you get a letter from comcast, I won't use comcast but it's not the torrent.  A user of PBay in USA."
