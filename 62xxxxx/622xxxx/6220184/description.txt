Matthew 25:14-30

   14 "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. 15 To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.

   19 "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'

   21 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'

   22 "The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'

   23 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'

   24 "Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'

   26 "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

   28 "'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

I am so tired of hearing this nonsense go back and forth, over and over again...

"This is better... That's better..."

Listen, snap out of it...  You get what you pay for...

This is "piracy", not "Tech Support"...

When it comes to "Trolls", they are like a 10 year old kid, with their face pressed against the glass, waiting for the store to open the day after Christmas; bouncing up and down, doing the "Pee-Pee Dance", because they "just can't wait" for that "latest-greatest Mortal Kombat" video game, that they were too cheap to actually BUY, yet MAKE A BIG ASSED FUCKING SCENE about how they don't want THE LAST VERSION because it won't play on their PLAYSTATION 2...!!!

This concept needs to be understood...

(A.K.A. "The-Arfen", "Cuelebre", "zakimar", "L.E.F", "mygirlscock", "baracas", "sssamridh", krautschneider, nervin, bigbluesea, etc...)

I'm gonna do THIS like we were back in the Marines, and I want you ALL to understand this, that ANY time that one of these assholes "Trolls" the fuck up in HERE, and GRAFFITI on my fucking walls, I'm going to PULL THAT FILE DOWN, rebuild it, ADD AND LAMINATE THEIR FUCKING NAMES TO THE "TOP 100 TROLLS MOST WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE" LIST, and then let the REST of you INNOCENT PEOPLE who PAID THE PRICE and have to DOWNLOAD IT TWICE, be CRUCIFIED like CHRIST, such that ANYONE who SEES ONE OF THESE TROLLS, or ANYONE who fucking DARE to TEMPT THE WRATH OF GOD, be EXPOSED TO THE WORLD by EVERYONE OF YOU ALL THAT SUFFERED, and SHOOT THESE "TROLLS" ON FUCKING SIGHT...!!!

I "Double-Fucking-Dog-Dare" you to TALK ANY SHIT, or say ANYTHING FUCKING NEGATIVE, on MY WALLS, in MY HOUSE...!!!

(NOBODY wastes MY fucking time...!!!)

These imbeciles, however, fail to comprehend that as "new" software is developed, there is still a shit-ton of computers on the Planet THAT STILL REQUIRE "This old and outdated software (A.K.A. "The-Arfen")"...

See, the thing about "Trolls", is that you NEVER KNOW if they were born that way, or if they had to get a scholarship to "Hogwarts"...

Suffice it to say, there are MULTIPLE approaches to a common solution...

That's where I come in...

I just want to see the beauty and genius that arises from the Planet of my species, unhindered by the restrictions of the New World Order...

Now, listening to people argue about which is the most preferable solution, to a crippled application, is about as enthusing as taking a "Troll" to the "Prom"...   Trouncing the fuck up in here, like this was the fucking "Simpson's" and you were commenting on "~The Worst Torrent Ever~"...   Fuck off with that nonsense...!!!

IF I WANTED YOUR DRAMA IN MY LIVING ROOM, I'D BUY A FUCKING TELEVISION...!!!

So, quit fucking bitching about shit, and go do something productive, like fighting the Vatican and the New World Order...!!!

Now, wake the fuck up, and start getting right with Jesus...!!!

IMMORTALIZED UNTIL THE RAPTURE OF GOD ALMIGHTY...!!!

Now, I want you to think about this, you "smart assed dumb shits", that nobody on the Planet is gonna want you, and if you fuck with ME, God ain't gonna have a fuckin' thing to do with you...

So, where's THAT leave you...?!?

I "Triple-Dog-Dare" you...!!!

Now, I'm tired and out of breath, so let's get this Show on the Road...

However, I want you to understand, that if THIS torrent gets pulled down, it's because I'm "under attack" by Trolls, and THEY don't want YOU to have THIS torrent, because it makes THEM look incompetent...  Thus, they will attack the integrity of this file, (or myself) to cause "doubt" in your mind, such that THEY would redirect your attention from HERE, to whichever malicious direction THEY COULD DECEIVE YOU to following...

Before you "Trust a Troll", verify that they HAVE EVER contributed a fucking thing to "progress"...

There is absolutely ZERO reason for you to be HERE, and I want everyone to acknowledge, that if YOU don't want this torrent, then get the FUCK out of here...!!!

Every file that I post, is 100%, and ANYONE who tries to tell you DIFFERENT, is by definition "lying to your face"...

See, now here's the part about it...

Each one of these Trolls has an individual agenda...  They are destroyers...

They prey on the naive...

They have no credulity, yet for the naive user, these Trolls intend to do nothing more than cast "doubt" over the strength and integrity of ANY torrent that conflicts with their invested interests...

These "Trolls", are called "Provocateurs"...

They mean ONLY to incite riot...


Now, I've completely lost my sense of humor about this subject...  So, I want this to be understood, SHOULD the thought, cross YOUR mind, to desecrate MY walls...  Every one of my files, come from my personal Library, to archive in the hands of my brethren, such that they flourish, and realize the divine craftsmanship of Almighty God, in turn plant ALL the seed of their yield, never knowing who is the next Michelangelo or Beethoven, nor would that opportunity ever befall them, should the work of YOUR own hands fail God's divine will...

There is an encryption, in the Bible, such that, if YOU try to stand between ME and New Jerusalem, I come armed with the Armor of God...

Ephesians 6:10-20

The Armor of God

 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord
 and in his mighty power.

 11 Put on the full armor of God,
 so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.

 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
 but against the rulers,
 against the authorities,
 against the powers of this dark world
 and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God,
 so that when the day of evil comes,
 you may be able to stand your ground,
 and after you have done everything,
 to stand.

 14 Stand firm then,
 with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
 with the breastplate of righteousness in place,

 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

 16 In addition to all this,
 take up the shield of faith,
 with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

 17 Take the helmet of salvation
 and the sword of the Spirit,
 which is the word of God. 

 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.
 With this in mind,
 be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.

 19 Pray also for me,
 that whenever I speak,
 words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known
 the mystery of the gospel,

 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains.
 Pray that I may declare it fearlessly,
 as I should.

Paragon Hard Disk Manager 2010 performs almost every imaginable task that involves hard disks and files. It's the latest version of a mature, product that I use whenever I need to copy disk partitions from one physical disk to another, resize partitions, or prepare disks for complex multiboot Windows installations. Paragon's app also backs up and restores anything from complete hard disks to the contents of any set of files you specify, wipes data from partitions or whole drives, and copies hard disks to disk images that can boot in VMware Workstation or Microsoft Virtual PC. This sort of sweeping hard disk management always entails some risk, but Paragon Hard Disk Manager 2010 comes with a confidence-inspiring set of safety features. It's the only disk-management utility I trust on my key systems. 


Disk Management Basics

If you're reading this review, you're probably not the kind of passive computer user who buys a machine with a single Drive C: partition on your hard drive, then never changes that basic setup. You probably know the advantages of dividing your disk into multiple partitions, and you don't need to be told that a "partition" is, essentially, a part of a physical disk that gets a drive letter to itself (though that's a rough-and-ready Windows-centric definition that doesn't cover all possibilities for partitions). 


I usually keep my hard disk divided into four or more partitions: one for my Windows XP system, one for my Windows 7 ($119.00 - $319.00 List, ) system, one for data only, one for long-term storage of installation programs and other large files. Depending on the system, I may sometimes even add additional partitions for other special purposes. I make daily backups of the partition I use for data, and less frequent backups of the other ones. 


Managing With Paragon

Paragon Hard Disk Manager has an interface much like other long-established disk management programs such as Easeus Partition Manager Professional 5. 0 and Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0, but I prefer the clarity of Paragon's UI. 

The Express Interface leads directly to specific tasks, such as splitting or expanding existing partitions, wiping data from partitions or the free space on your drive, and backing up your e-mail or documents or whole drives to "archive" files. The express interface can also install a sophisticated boot manager that lets you boot Linux and Windows easily on the same disk. All these tasks can be performed with other tools, some of them available free, but I like the clarity and reliability of Paragon's wizards and the consistent reliability I've seen from its results. 

Experienced users will prefer the traditional hard-disk management dialog, with a tree-structured diagram of your disk structure at the top and a graph-style diagram of the disk at the bottom. Here you can right-click on a partition and choose from an enormous variety of tasks, including basic ones like renaming or testing a partition to such arcane tasks as changing the specific version of the NTFS file system used on a Windows partition. A partition explorer lets you extract files from external disks or from partitions that are normally hidden from Windows. For the really daring and the highly competent, a direct disk editor lets you change the actual bytes on your disk. A menu item lets you burn a bootable CD with a similar set of tools that you can use if your system gets damaged too badly to let you boot into Windows. 

Paragon is my disk-manager of choice because of its excellent interface and because it's the only program of its kind that has always worked with all the hardware I could throw at it. Other packages I've tried have sometimes been unable to recognize some disks that I connected through Firewire or other uncommonly-used connection. Granted, most of those apps have since improved, but none can quite measure up to Paragon's ease of use and rigorous safety tools. 


What to Buy, and When

I actually tested a near-final version of the $129.95 Professional version, which differs from the basic $49.95 Suite version in that it adds the ability to work with Dynamic Disks, a Windows feature more for corporate and enterprise installations than the home, school, or SOHO setting. That's why the screens say "Professional;" the versions are otherwise identical. Both versions should be available in final form within a few weeks after this review goes public, and if you buy the also highly recommended 2009 version now, you can upgrade for free to the 2010 version when it's released. The Professional version belongs in any IT manager's toolbox, and the Suite version is a multi-talented bargain that no advanced Windows user should be without.
