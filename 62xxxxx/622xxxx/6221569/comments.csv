,icy100,2011-06-23T16:45Z,DONT DOWNLOAD From episode 11-22 there are 2 red vertical lines going across the screen for the whole episode. Unless you  can bear through those DONT DOWNLOAD.
[T],ajaxen94,2011-06-25T15:35Z,@icy100 are you sure its not your computer as i don't have 2 red lines on my copies on my tv or computer and i think out of the thousands that have downloaded it someone else would have been sure to have noticed it
