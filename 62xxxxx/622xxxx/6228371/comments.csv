,iplaydeadxdhx,2011-03-09T06:04Z,"Every download for this game is going VERY slow..

But when I download other things it's fast. I dont understand.. lol"
,iplaydeadxdhx,2011-03-09T06:04Z,.
,Perhelion,2011-03-09T07:07Z,Just FYI: Having the settings on DirectX 11 can cause the game to crash before it even loaded. Putting the setting on DirectX 9 has fixed the issue.
,aviel,2011-03-09T09:12Z,can sme1 upload files with polish subtitles?
,cuteJD,2011-03-09T11:48Z,nice down speed........... 5 seeder-37 leachers and i get  1.8KB/s ........ :(
,uroshuchiha92,2011-03-09T15:03Z,"I have the same question as iKitty
Clonedvd's DA2 is like 5gb and this is 6gb.
Whats the difference?This one has more languages or what?If its only languages then I don't care lol but if something else then I do care."
,DonCorleone7,2011-03-09T15:09Z,i was getting speeds of 450kbs last night but i had to shut the computer down. Now im gettin speeds of max 100kbs!! More seeders please!!
,uroshuchiha92,2011-03-09T15:19Z,Why is this 5gb and reloaded 6gb?If its only because reloaded has more language packs then I don't care but if its something important.... 
,uroshuchiha92,2011-03-09T15:20Z,wops I didn't notice my first comment got through...net bugged out.

,jVance,2011-03-13T03:10Z,"So when I mount the ISO, I open it, click setup and it tells me, ""the specified path does not exist"", how can I fix this?"
,sumith51,2011-03-13T06:12Z,is this game full or just a demo??
,knight_of_starrs,2011-03-18T09:40Z,"Installation failed for me, two files inside the iso, core_data.rar, core_env.rar seem to be corrupted."
,knight_of_starrs,2011-03-18T10:22Z,"I found a solution to fix the installation failed problem with this torrent.

I did this with uTorrent 2.2 (build 23703)

1. Extract this rar to a desired folder

2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6228419/Dragon_Age_2-RELOADED

3. Set the download location for this new torrent to the same folder where you have the rld-dag2.iso file

uTorrent would download the remaining missing blocks for the iso

see my earlier comment for the details of corrupted rar files in iso.

iso file size 6.59 GB (7,082,606,592 bytes)

Now the setup should complete without errors."
,AMDKMA,2011-03-29T23:01Z,"I can't seem to find the keygen, any help?"
