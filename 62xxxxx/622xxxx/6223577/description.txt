George Noory hosted a night of Open Lines, offering a special line for callers who wanted to share their 'unusual moments'. The final half-hour featured a classic clip from a past Coast show, when Art Bell talked with a caller who claimed to be a pilot flying into Area 51. 

First hour guest, author Adam Catlin, spoke about his investigations into the paranormal, some of which are presented in From Among the Dead.
