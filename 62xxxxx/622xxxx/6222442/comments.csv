or is it that when a newer ver is out then i have to look and download for another client?
thanks"
,Shakz76,2011-03-06T14:15Z,"You will have to use the pylotro client and click patch. It takes a bit for the update, but it eventually finishes. I think instructions for this are in the readme. "
,Shakz76,2011-03-06T14:33Z,Bumped upload speed up a bit so yall can get it a little faster. Dont have much bandwidth to share to begin with but hey....its the thought that counts right?
