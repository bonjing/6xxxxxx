This was not created by me but its impossible to get. Its just the client and the latest version of wine compiled on osx and packaged. Credit to the guy in the readme enclosed. I tested it on my OSX machine and it works great. 

Took me over 2 weeks to get this file from the original host with multiple failures and 40k download speed for a 13gb file. There is an easier version that can be had on the net thats only 11gb but it does not work. Just a heads up.
