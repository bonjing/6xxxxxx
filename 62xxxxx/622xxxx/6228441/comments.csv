,yes201,2011-03-08T20:35Z,"Doesn't work. For the Exiled Prince, you should be finding a new quest in the middle of Hightown, I believe, which isn't happening.

,morel142,2011-03-08T23:28Z,"Guys..

 Edit each manifest.xml for each dlc and remove the part that says RequiresAuthorization=""0"" completely.

 The slightly altered it, but for the most part, most dlc's for dragon age 2 follow the same rules as for Dragon age 1.

 Basically after the specific dlc data it should look like this.. 

ExtendedModuleUID=""campaign_base"" Priority=""100"" Enabled=""1"" State=""2"" Format=""1"" BioWare=""0"">

 Boot up game and poof, activated and working.. :)"

,Dw514,2011-03-09T00:46Z,"Dear Dragon Age 2 Pirates

This torrent only includes the DLC for The Black Emporium and Exiled Prince. 

But it does not include a Decrypter needed to activate this DLC ingame. 

A DLC Decrypter for this game will be released in the week. 

Please remember, that changing the RequiresAuthorization=""1""  to ""0"" will activate the DLC on the downloadable content in the main menu, but will not show in game.

So please be patient and a DLC decrypter will be available soon. 

Thank You and have a nice day."

,yic17,2011-03-09T06:38Z,nevermind. it doesn't work. I signed in and got 2 Premium Content and I thought they were this but it's not.

,bjh089,2011-03-09T06:51Z,And just to note when i started the game i seen them pop up but havent played the game since so i'd have to confirm when i check the dlc out. It might just show up in game but still not let you play them or access them? And ya in game is where i seen it at i know it also shows in downloadable content at the main menu.

,ryger48,2011-03-09T07:41Z,"@bjh089
Just to clarify: when you say they pop up in-game, were they the actual dlc quest names, or were they the premium content quest names that get auto-added when you link your account?  Because I linked everything up, but the dlc doesn't show up on the ea/bioware account (but the premium content does), and when I go in-game I have 4 new quest entries in the journal with the pop ups on the screen, but that's just the premium stuff too..."
,yic17,2011-03-09T08:16Z,for everyone who hasn't got it working .. is it possible that we're simply not yet to the point where they activate?
,karaouli3,2011-03-09T08:27Z,i remember reading that you can get both after the opening when you get to kirkwall so.. i guess we wait for a decrypter
,THE_SK1TZ,2011-03-09T10:53Z,Has anyone gotten this to work on the CLONE version? I really dont want to download and install the RELOADED. If anyone figures out how to get it working on CLONE let me know. Thanks.
,DimDima,2011-03-09T11:15Z,"It does not work neither on the clone version, nor the reloaded version. You can relax."
,morel142,2011-03-09T11:27Z,"
 Well if you don't remove the authorization part, each one will show ""Unauthorized"" next to it's name on your downloaded content screen.

 If you don't connect at least once to the EA servers it shows it as an ""offer"" 

 After that you get the quests after you start  the game.. 

As for the ""DA2 Not installed means you need to copy the entire cloneDVD Contents into the almost empty directory in C:\program files\blah blah..  Depending on what release you downloaded :)"
,weewing427,2011-03-09T11:35Z,"to be able to install the dlc, simply launch DragonAge2Config.exe, and then go to repair and click all of the options there, it will basically add shortcuts & registry entries all by itself. You'll be able to then install the DLC's and HiRes textures afterwards. Hope it helps"
,yes201,2011-03-09T11:46Z,"All I see in the repair section is:
Create Start Menu Shortcuts
Create Desktop Shortcut
Create Quick Launch Shortcut
Add Firewall Exception

I don't see how any of those would help activate DLC. And trying them out, they don't seem to help."

Anyone happen to know if this is a bad version or something, and I should switch?? Anyway, back to the connection issue:), I had to manually add the DragonAge2 [.] exe to my firewall exceptions and it worked fine after that.

Just to make sure (I was a little confused with the original instructions), using black emporium as an example, are we supposed to be placing the manifest file directly into the da2_prc_one folder (if so, with or w/o the exe used to install it), or are we supposed to copy the ""black emporium"" folder that holds both of those files into that directory (would this even make a difference?)

Just download the RELOADED version and that's it, just to be safe.
About the DLC, it doesn't really matters because nothing works. The manifest.xml file should be placed inside the DLC folder (after installed) and that is it. You can change yourself the existing manifest.xml with notepad but it still will not work."

As repeatedly said, that does not work. All that does is make it show up in the game's Downloadable Content menu as installed. It doesn't allow you to actually recruit the characters, get the items, or play the missions in-game."

Please actually test it in game before saying something works. Like actually go into the emporium.

I believe i am using the clonedvd file... well, i used the MDX torrent that was taken down on the 6th. Anyway, all i did was as most have done:

1. installed both DLC's
2. copied the manifests to their appropriate folders & overwrote originals
3. created and logged into EA account and checked they were installed in-game(they were)
4. closed the game and ran the deda2drm BAT file to activate
5. ran the game again and checked my messages at home

worked for me... i'm not sure if creating an EA account had anything to do with it, worth a shot i guess."

Everytime i ran the batch file without admin it would say Dragone age 2 is running jerk or try running in admin. I would run in Admin and get this isnt a windows bla bla bla.

So before all this i had moved my the electronic arts folder in the clonedvd to Program file x86. I run windows 64bit. 

Right Click your Electronic Arts folder. Go to the Security Tab. Make sure everything (like the name of your PC) has full control. I noticed mine didn't so i had to give it full control. After this run the batch file and Boom it should work."

,gmcr,2011-05-08T14:43Z,"HOW I GOT THIS SHIT TO WORK
=======================

1. Install DLC

2. Open manifest.mxl with notepad++

3. Replace the line RequiresAuthorization=""1"" with RequiresAuthorization=""0""

4. Play

Note: This will not work if you are using the regular notepad, you have to use notepad++.
Also, I'm using the reloaded version if that makes any difference.

Confirmed to be working for the Black Emporium and Exiled Prince DLC"
,gmcr,2011-05-08T14:46Z,Derp.. I meant manifest.xml not manifest.mxl
,hack_sparrow,2011-06-02T22:56Z,"thnx a lot extremezone -- ,   FOR THOSE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH INSTALLATION  ---(this is a DETAILED explaination  on how to install the  patches --- simply 
 1-----copy the folders to the main dragon age II folder 
2---  open the installer in each one of the two folders , install the  packs  (the useable (.exe) file) just keep doing next ,etc,..
3--- the  go to the  addins folder in the main DAII folder(directory) , you'll see that there are two folders made ,.. da2_prc_one AND da2_prc_seb ,, 
4---go back to the  downloaded folders  COPy the MAINFEST file from the black emperor folder and paste it into the da2_prc_one folder AND Replace the old MANIFEST FILE --

,Prissyponts,2011-07-02T20:56Z,"Me and my brother downloaded the torrent about an hour ago, and followed the instructions. But it seems it won't work, I don't receive the letter. Can someone help me?"
,reambonanzajan,2011-11-02T03:46Z,This is how i did to make it work. Run the dragon age launcher as administrator then install the 2 DLCs. After that just follow hack_sparrow's instruction on copying the manifest.
