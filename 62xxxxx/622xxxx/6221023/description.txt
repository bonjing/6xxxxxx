The second edition of Fundamentals of Machine Elements provides thorough coverage of basic machine elements and their realistic application in modern engineering. The book is divided into two parts: Part I (chs 1-8) covers fundamental background topics, and Part II (chs 9-20), presents the design of various machine components. Unique coverage of MEMS devices is provided in chapter 20, reflecting the importance of microsystems in today's industry. Fundamentals of Machine Elements, second edition is rich with examples and homework problems designed to test student understanding and build their skills in analysis and design. The engineering design process is stressed throughout the book through the use of Case Studies,open-ended problems, design procedure boxes, and in-text discussion. The book is complemented by extensive online resources for instructors and students.
