Saying that it's colder everywhere else is retarded too.  What time frame?  Everywhere?  Really?  Average temps over any significant period of time will prove that statement wrong.

Do you even realize that the difference between the average temperatures during the last ice age and what we consider normal are only a few degrees C?  It doesn't take a huge change in average temp to have a global impact."
