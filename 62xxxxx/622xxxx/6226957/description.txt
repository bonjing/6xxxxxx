The three episodes are basically just a summary of Gundam SEED with a few new perspectives.

NOTE:
I did NOT create this torrent, just uploaded to PB so people find it here. I also didn't see anything of this quality in dual audio here on PB.

There was only one seed when I found it (to whoever that is: I love you). I'll be seeding as much as possible for as long as possible.
