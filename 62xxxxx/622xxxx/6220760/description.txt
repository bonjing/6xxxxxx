Storyline: The movie begins at a blood bank. A homeless man walks into the clinic and sits by another homeless man (Luke Goss) with a scar running down his chin. A nurse takes the latter man into a room with several people waiting where he is to be drained of blood, but kills his captors and reveals himself to be a new breed of vampire.Two years have passed since the climax of the first film, and Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been trying to find Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who survived his suicide attempt and turned into a vampire. He has been sweeping across Russia and eastern Europe, searching for his old friend and mentor, enlisting the aid of a young man, Scud (Norman Reedus), to design him a new line of gadgetry and weaponry. In the first scene, Blade fights his way through a large gang of vampires, leaving one of their number, Rush (Santiago Segura), alive, yet telling him he will be back for him. Blade finds Whistler locked in a tank of blood by a gang of vampires who were keeping him alive for purposes of torture. Blade rescues him and brings him to Prague.

Storyline: The film begins with an opening narration about Dracula, told by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds): In the movies, Dracula wears a cape and some old English guy always manages to save the day at the last minute with crosses and holy water, but everybody knows the movies are full of shit.
The truth is, it started with Blade and it ended with him. The rest of us were just along for the ride.The film starts with a group of vampires, looking for "Drake", a.k.a. Dracula (Dominic Purcell) They subsequently find and wake him in a Syrian ziggurat tomb, although not before he kills one of their own number
