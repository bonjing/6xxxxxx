,Mattaclysm,2011-03-09T18:29Z,Thanks neon... HDLiTE's rips are the best (in terms of quality) IMO... Thanks as always for sharing! Any ideas when you may be able to get your hands on a Little Fockers BRRip?
[V],neon,2011-03-09T19:26Z,"Mattaclysm next few weeks m8...  Universal Studios has announced that Little Fockers is releasing on both DVD and Blu-ray on April 5, 2011....my guess is before the end of this month :)

,killy69,2011-03-10T13:06Z,too much grainy
,Mathlol,2011-03-10T17:36Z,"Too much grain?  Have you seen th thousands sucked into xvid releases at higher file stats?

Be grateful for a releaser.  
If you don't like it, don't visit again."
,Mathlol,2011-03-10T17:40Z,"@killy69 If you knew anything about Black Swan, you'd know it was shot in a grainy method, 16mm.  Don't be so quick to judge."
,hpisaliar,2011-03-16T18:39Z,"Hi
I just want to know one thing . Blu ray site shows Black Swan release to be March 29. Then from where dows one get the copy to rip"
,Reactor69,2011-03-20T14:01Z,HDLiTE never fail to amaze. Great quality to size balance.
,osriccc,2011-03-28T08:13Z,If I was going to marry anything... it would be HDLiTE.
,est1987,2011-04-03T06:53Z,Got a copyright infringement notice from FOX. 
,mcumcu,2011-04-27T22:11Z,"I had PeerBlock going, but my ISP still got an infringement notice from DTecNet Software for this torrent. BE CAREFUL!"
,midurix,2011-05-10T22:40Z,@Milhouse1980 It amazes me when people like you request a movie. Why do you think that just because someone has uploaded a movie you somehow think that they are going to be able to get another random movie just like that? they aren't wizards or magicians. I just don't see your logic.
,DaNtsu,2011-05-18T19:31Z,Thanks! Like your style!
,Heides666,2011-05-22T08:46Z,"Ugh. It's quicktime mp4 and bogs my computer so much it plays the 1min sample at 4 frames/MINUTE, no joke.  Audio is fine, but vid is 4 shot slideshow. I have no probs w/ other 720p x264s, even with higher bitrates.

It may be a good DL for some, maybe even most ppl, who knows.  THOSE ppl can thank you. But I'm sorry, this DL was a complete waste of limited bandwidth, time and HD space for me. Fuck. File Info on DL page next time."
,rg_ms,2012-01-20T23:31Z,Thanks! Looking great on 42'! Sound is also OK!
