[V],globeplus,2011-03-20T16:20Z,"To have the game quickly running normally they need to be on the normal iso extension but and i didnÂ´t said it on the emulator , the BZ2 or Z2 generated by the Linuz Iso can go ok in quick mode with a little trick : the user only have to remove the word BZ2 or Z2 from the iso name and on the generated table that comes with any type of this files , so to the question : Can i run Z2 or BZ2 in quick play mode on this version ? yes , with a little touch on the name of the game .

,bigbopper100,2011-03-21T20:53Z,"hey globe have you thought about having ago at ps3 games getting them down to a reasonable size?
all the best!"
[V],globeplus,2011-03-22T18:53Z,"To Blaze69 : it is like that but you can improve a few frames per second muting the sound on the sound plugin but that dpmÂ´t sounds nice and the improve not too much besides that still playable .

To bigbopper100 : first you get them for me then you test them after that because no ps3 emulator available yet and not sign of that .

To sakti01 : click on the magnet link and confirm the application , say ok to the new included torrent file and the file will start downloading on the torrent program ."
