read by BILL WALLIS 2005.
Complete & Unabridged. 

P.G. WODEHOUSE is a comic genius best known for Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, pig loving peer Lord Emsworth, and a regiment of aunts and butlers.

But although Wodehouse and his work have become indissolubly part of the English language and it's literature, the writer himself is enigmatic.

His life, notorious for one historic blunder during the Second World War, remains unexplored.
