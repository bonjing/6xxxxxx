,NewMex52,2011-03-21T00:24Z,"If you're worried about the 5gb file size, you probably need to install a 2nd or 3rd hard drive into your system.  Also.  With so many seeders available at this point and time downloading the file should pose no problem.  Get the latest version ""VLC Player"" to playback the .mkv file."
,Bootre,2011-03-21T00:42Z,"Quality is very poor.  The video looks like the size should be less than 500mb, not 5GB.  Don't bother."

Crappy xvid to x264 transcode using DVDFab."
