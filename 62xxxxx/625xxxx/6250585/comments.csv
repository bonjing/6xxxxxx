,KapitanPaz,2011-03-17T21:41Z,NUKED there is a repack
,Tilatus,2011-03-17T21:48Z,"Confirmed, doesn't install on the cracked game. Have to try with the clean install, I think."
,Tilatus,2011-03-17T21:57Z,Tried the link muratce020181 provided and it worked perfectly with the crack provided here. Thank you!
,HellSpawn123456789,2011-03-17T21:58Z,I installed on the original exes. Didn't change the result.
,magic-Heiner,2011-03-17T22:03Z,"Doesn't work for me!
I have tried a clean install and it says the same ""this update is not compatible with the current installed game"" "
,Insomneac,2011-03-17T22:10Z,"There is a screw up by Ubisoft.

This patch only works for the US or RUS versions.

It will not work for any Multi releases.

The actual patch for the Multi is 72 MB.

Filename: ac_brotherhood_1.01_online.exe

Thanks for the upload, though."
,Tilatus,2011-03-17T22:34Z,"The link provided by muratce020181 works fine. Just change the '&' to '.' and use that exe, then copy the crack."
,Olymp7,2011-03-18T00:03Z,"Install the game and start it. It will update to 1.01, than copy the crack in this torrent. Worked for me :)"
,Gaijyne,2011-03-18T11:01Z,Applied this patch but still crashes.
,TechnoBanana,2011-03-20T02:23Z,"People saying its Ubisofts falt, its not, its your falt for maybe not using a SKiDROW torrent with this patch. If you have cloneDVD use the clone dvd crack! "
,Ghanijazz,2011-03-20T15:04Z,"how to fix this ?

this update is not compatible with the current installed game"
,Insomneac,2011-03-21T21:52Z,"@ TechnoBanana, you have no idea what you're talking about.

Yes, it was UbiSoft's fault, and no, there is no ""CloneDVD crack"".

And there is no difference between the Skidrow version and the CloneDVD version.

They are both identical....."
,Kimovec,2011-03-22T16:25Z,"TO EVERYONE: If U had same problem as I had: ""this update is not compatible with the current installed game"" , just donwload the exe file from post uploaded by muratce020181 (change & with . ), run it, install it, and then use and copy crack from this torrent to your install folder. It WORKS! Enjoy:)"
