,leesgirlrn,2011-03-31T14:42Z,"OMG!! it WORKED!!! thank you SO much!! I've actually bought this program twice, but when my computer crashed, they wouldn't let me re-download - said I had to upgrade for several hundred dollars AGAIN! seriosly???  Thank you Thank you Thank you!"
,leesgirlrn,2011-03-31T14:43Z,oops-sorry - didn't realize I came to the Mac one- I downloaded the WIN one!
,ragefresh,2011-04-02T20:19Z,"ok everything went smoothly till, i got the part where I open the terminal to past the text that begins with Sudo. when i past that part and press enter it tells me to be careful using sude command and to enter a password. when I try to enter a password, it simply won't let me type! what the heck? HELPP!!?!?!"
,hlitani,2011-04-02T23:15Z,"Thanks! that did work wonderfully! 

Ragefresh: Just type it anyway, and if it doesn't take, change permission in the sudoers file to include yourself. To do that you have to to 'apple shift G' in the finder then '/etc/' in the box. in the etc folder you will find the sudoers file, get info on it and + yourself in the permissions. if your user password is nothing than it won't take either. Good luck"
,elmaestrojoe,2011-04-05T02:25Z,"hlitani: I'm having the same problem as ragefresh, we copy the first Sudo into terminal then text edit prompts us for a password but we don't have permission to write, I found the file in finder and clicked get info like you said but we can't give ourselves access because write permission is greyed out. Under sharing & permissions it lists user capabilities:   system :read & write  wheel: read only__ everyone: read only - all greyed out.  this happened to me with photoshop too, anyone help please?"
,WA3d,2011-04-05T18:01Z,"the same thing happened with me ! in the very beginning I got the same message. when I tried to make it I lost the data which suppose to be written in Terminal and it's empty right now ! I just don't know what to do.

How would i find a serial number ""inside the torrent?"" i already looked at the torrent (in bittorrent) and could not find it. PLEASE HELP QUICKLY! And also, what does that textedit thing do when you save it? thanks,

[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-04-16T16:55Z,"The ""Activation Blocker"" simply block's adobe so that they can't check the serial. (With other words, then the serials will work) 

Serials will be inside the ""iNSTRUCTIONS"" file, i always leave my serials inside it.

,firstcut,2011-04-17T20:37Z,"I mistakenly ran the program after installation before I had opened terminal and pasted the codes. Yes, what you explicitly mentioned not to do. Where do I go from here? Should I uninstall and start from scratch?"

Dude, if you can't download a torrent then your one dumb kid....

There you go, one piece excellent information!

,tunk4life,2011-04-19T20:33Z,EVEN THO THAT WAS HIGHLY DISRESPECTFUL AND EVERYONE DOESNT KNO HOW TO DO  THINGS LIKE THIS IN THA WORLD I DO APPRECIATE THE HELP THANX BRO

Peace bro! "
,tunk4life,2011-04-20T04:36Z,didn't mean to have it on. Ok i down loaded it and when i install it asks for a serial number. now what?
,tunk4life,2011-04-20T04:39Z,i got it my bad
,tunk4life,2011-04-20T04:43Z,but one question what is the terminal app?
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-04-20T18:56Z,"By default it provides a bash shell, which allows the OS X user to visually interact with the system core.

Allmost the same as CMD in windows :) "
,tunk4life,2011-04-20T22:49Z,OK so how do i exactly do steps 4 and 5 because i think i did it wrong. I went in to documents and typed terminal and went from there wasn't exactly sure what to do with step 5 so i put it in tha sam place as 4. and now i opened the program and its not plain any audio and it plays only like 10 sec. of video.
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-04-21T04:06Z,"Take a look here: http://bayimg.com/gAHPEAadk

Paste it in to the Terminal as i have done on the picture, hit enter, write your password (it won't show that your writing), hit enter again, the ""host file"" will now show up, then you enter all that stuff into the hosts, now save pressing CMD+S. 

It's not so difficult.. Now open AE, then use one of the serials and your Adone After Effects will be full activated. 

Good luck! :) "

,redeiws,2011-04-25T16:38Z,"TY, Everything works great, download and serials are good.

!!!!!! One problem. I had CS4 installed and now with the installation of AE CS5 I see an Adobe Updater Icon in my Mac toolbar. Is this something I should be worrying about? OR does changing the host database disable exactly this?"
,redeiws,2011-04-25T17:09Z,"I opened the Adobe Application Manager and disallowed Adobe to check for updates and then refused to update all of the CS5 applications.

Just to make sure, it would be a foolish move to try and update AE using this crack, amiright?"
,tunk4life,2011-04-26T04:59Z,tha host works for both is that what ur saying??? and if it is i don't kno why it still isn't working.

,biggie01,2011-05-10T18:22Z,"Anyone try this to disable Adobe from checking for updates? 


Machine-wide disablement
To disable access to updates for all users on a given machine, administrators can create an admin preference file. (This file disables access to updates both from the Help > Updates menu, as well as automatic update checks.) Create a plain-text file named AdobeUpdaterAdminPrefs.dat with the following contents:







	1



Put the file in the following location:

Mac OS	/Library/Application Support/Adobe/AAMUpdaterInventory/1.0/AdobeUpdaterAdminPrefs.dat 
Windows XP and Higher	 C:\Program files\common files\adobe\AAMUpdaterInventory\1.0\AdobeUpdaterAdminPrefs.dat 
Windows XP and higher (64-bit)	 C:\Program files(x86)\common files\adobe\AAMUpdaterInventory\1.0\AdobeUpdaterAdminPrefs.dat 
Note: This will also prevent administrators from checking for updates and installing updates through that update check. This is easily dealt with by simply renaming the AdobeUpdaterAdminPrefs.dat file, running the update check and installation with the Adobe Application Manager, then restoring the file to it's original name.

Alternatively, with the system wide update disablement in place, administrators can install updates by downloading them from http://www.adobe.com/downloads/updates. "

I installed it following your instructions although they were somewhat outdated since some of us upgraded to Lion. But with the comment posted by JethroN I was able to access my host file and to my surprise the information I needed to insert into the host file as per your instructions was already there. Of course this is due to the fact I had already installed Photoshop CS5 with your blocker instructions inserted in the host file so I did not have to do it again. When I finally launched After Effects it did not even ask me for the serial and away we go all sails up on to new and exiting pirate adventures.

Many many thanks Cyberpiraten.....Long live thepiratebay and its members."
