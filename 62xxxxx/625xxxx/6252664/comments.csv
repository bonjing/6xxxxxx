,DrifterSK,2011-03-18T14:10Z,Thanks Pokler! This is one of the better site rips.
,alexanderrg,2011-03-19T09:06Z,Thanks for all the uploads. Much appreciated.
,bowhan333,2011-05-24T10:03Z,"Thank you Pokler. I've dled most of these, and would like to help seed, but i've moved them to an external drive and am not sure how to restart them. Any help on how to do this?
Would also love to see some FTV!"
,Pokler,2011-06-24T21:40Z,"You can point your torrent in utorrent to the new download location. Or download the torrent file again from tpb and set it to download to your new location (mark your files as read only to be sure nothing will get overwritten).

And on another note 723 leechers?! Where did all those people come from and they only seem to like this last one."
,aleksuu,2011-06-25T15:29Z,"How do you mark files, that can be read only in utorrent?"
,Pokler,2011-06-28T13:18Z,I have no idea what you just said.
,aleksuu,2011-06-30T19:44Z,"Same as you: ""mark your files as read only to be sure nothing will get overwritten"""
,Pokler,2011-06-30T20:22Z,"Aha, I see it now.

You can mark it read only in Windows Explorer or any file explorer program and not in uTorrrent.

Just right click them and select the option."
