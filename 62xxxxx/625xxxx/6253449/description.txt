Get maximum results in minmum time with Jeanette Jenkins and her Ultimate Cross-Training workout.

This time-saving, calorie-blasting routine brings you the best of her most popular Hollywood classes: CardioSculpt, Kickboxing, Pilates and Yoga, the same classes that have helped shape some of Hollywoodâ€™s hottest bodies.

Designed to challenge and improve all five components of fitness: muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, flexibility and body composition (increase of lean body mass/ decrease of body fat), Ultimate Cross-Training will sculpt and define your entire body from head to toe and help you lose weight â€“ all in as little as 10 minutes a day.

Presented in four 10-minute segments, the entire workout can be completed in one exercise session, or, if you are running short on time, you can do the first 20 minutes (Kickboxing/Sculpting) in the morning, to boost your metabolism and help you burn more calories throughout the day, and then do the second 20 minutes (Yoga/Pilates) in the evening, to help you release stress and get a good nightâ€™s rest. If you are a beginner, you can simply do one 10-minute segment on four different days, increasing the amount of time as your fitness level improves. You canâ€™t use time as an excuse anymore!
