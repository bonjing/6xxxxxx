The funk gems and semi-gems of this album are:

\\\"Comin \\\'Round The Mountain\\\"(Gem)--The late great
Eddie \\\"Maggot Brain\\\" Hazel on soaring guitar
(his last studio performance with Funkadelic),
the legendary Buddy Miles on drums, Cordell \\\"Boogie\\\"
Mosson holding down that percolating bassline.
All of this equates to an incendiary funk-rock jam session
with George scribbling some quickie lyrics that are partly
based on the old choral standard and partly about jammin\\\'
in the U.S. Funk mob!
The end result was DEFINITELY not the song you
remember from high school chorus! (-:

\\\"Smokey\\\"(Gem)--Man!!, I still love this slinky-sexy-funky
joint here! With the late great Glenn Goins and his distinct
churchified tenor ranting, raving, and extolling the joys of
loving a double-entendre, which could be perceived as either
a woman or some bomb-azz weed! (-:
I love Bernie \\\"Da Vinci\\\" Worrell\\\'s keyboard and synth work
on this, along with both Glenn & Garry Shider\\\'s tasty rhythm
guitar feels woven in between.
I also love the droned background vocals of Garry, Fuzzy,
Grady, Ray, Calvin, George and Mudbone from Bootsy\\\'s Rubberband.
The \\\"lookin\\\' back at cheaww!\\\" and the \\\"Waell, weall, weall, weaaaaawwwwlll!!\\\"
Like Al Green and Sly Stone on acid!
In black gospel singing, these are known as \\\"squawls\\\" or
drawling out a word by changing the pronunciation from you
to yeaww, and so forth.
I just love the atmosphere of this jam and it\\\'s eerie
build up to the end.

\\\"If You Got Funk, You Got Style\\\" (Semi-Gem)
Was a throw away track from Bootsy\\\'s Rubberband\\\'s debut
album sessions. George & The Gang tried to salvage it,
but it still sounds like just a pretty good demo with
some good potential. It\\\'s cool.

\\\"Hardcore Jollies\\\"(Semi-Gem)--Is just basically
Mike \\\"Kidd Funkadelic\\\" Hampton working out on his mighty
axe, along with the other musicians in an impromptu jam session.
It just shows that a funk band can play rock after all!

\\\"Soul Kiss\\\" is a real gem to me!--Quirky, catchy, hooky,
George Clinton\\\'s writing style is flirtatious and lewd at
the same time without being vulgar. The vocals and the
track all work well together, and I always wished this
could\\\'ve been a B-Side to another stronger song.
Real P-Funk Headz know and love this one!

\\\"Cosmic Slop (Live)\\\"(Gem!!)--Recorded live in the upstate
N.Y. Air Force Hangar during the P-Funk Earth Tour rehearsals,
I really love this stripped down, raw, and slightly sped-up
version of their original 1973 hit, which has it\\\'s charm as well,
but I like this one more for it\\\'s energy.
The sound crew must\\\'ve been buzzing, because the backgrounds
are pulled down too low in the mix on the
\\\"Would you like to dance with me, we\\\'re doing the Cosmic Slop!\\\" part.
It was sung really lazy, like what you would hear in a
rehearsal, but it still works fine.
The guitar between Mike, Garry and Glenn is stellar!
This song still rocks!

\\\"You Scared The Lovin\\\' Outta Me\\\" (Gem!!)--Everything about
this song is the bomb!!--The atmosphere, the guitar-layered
track, Jerome \\\"Bigfoot\\\" Brailey\\\'s kickin\\\' drumming, and of course..
this is a Glenn Goins vocal tour de force!
You really hear the uniqueness of his very soulful vocal
instrument on this song!--Another true P-Funk Headz staple!

\\\"Adolescent Funk\\\" (Semi-Gem)--Sounds like they just had
a very laid back track for a demo they were working on
and George just told Bernie to stretch out on it and play with it.
Then the little scatted vocal line just kind of developed.
It\\\'s cute, but more demo than a song.
It closes the album out though on a mild note.

Overall I gave this album a 4 star rating...
it\\\'s not one Funkadelic\\\'s best, but it has some great gems on it.
Still worth a good listen after 33 yrs. 

More of what you\\\'re funkin\\\' for in .flac.

Mp3 is AM radio compared to Flac.

Enjoy and please seed.
