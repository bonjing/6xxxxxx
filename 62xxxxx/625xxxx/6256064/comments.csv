,Jayde99,2011-03-21T02:58Z,"Thanks for the upload Inspiron! I appreciate that you do this for every ASOT.

I did notice something though. Am I the only one that the songs don't match up to when a file starts? Example:  Exploration of Space starts ~3:30mins into the Phoenix file instead at the start of its own file."
[T],FatFreddy62,2011-03-21T13:40Z,First of all thanks ... much appreciated ... secondly ...yeah ... ur splitting is way off ... its like 2 mins ... maybe u got ur cueing wrong ... thats in blake's set ..i didnt check the rest ... anyways thanks keep it up ;D
,DLovas,2011-03-24T04:37Z,"u are truly a god - Armin should give you a damn shout out.

i can just picture it:

""I'd like to give a shout out to Inspiron - he truly is amazin...""  "
[T],-inspiron-,2011-03-24T15:51Z,"@DLovas : REALLY THANKS , like your words, actually it's like a dream to me :D , i sent him requests and Birthday Greetings but no response :( , I appreciate it mate :)

@Jayde99 , yooz2714 : actually , here's the thing , first i haven't listened to the sets until they are uploaded all and everyone has them, don't wanna be selfish to enjoy them alone :D , therefore i didn't know about it , and i think it's just in Blake's set right ? anyway, is it a problem or is it ok? :) "
,Jayde99,2011-03-24T22:30Z,"It was just Blake's set. The others are ok.

And it's not really a problem, for me at least. Just something I noticed. Keep up the good work! =)"
,sitihsrah,2011-03-26T22:28Z,"Love armin. . Love Inspiron.
Keep up the good work.  :)"
