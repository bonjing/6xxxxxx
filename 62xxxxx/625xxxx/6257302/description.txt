AUDIO:Thanks m8ty 

Plot:
Set in a medieval village that is haunted by a werewolf, a young girl falls for an orphaned woodcutter, much to her family's displeasure.

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Red Riding Hood 2011

Right the russian video was ok ,nothing too special but watchable.....but it did have a few issues.
Main one being the colouring was well whacked and also it had black borders on the right and top at
slight angles...oh and the worse thing was the interlace it was encoded into the film.
So we cropped the borders fixed the colouring the best we could with a white balance and rgb eq.....
we also hardcoded the one line on non english subs,we fixed the interlace issues and messed with the 
brightness and contrast.
Audio was pretty decent,we just had to sync it and then mux it altogether 

Enjoy folks
