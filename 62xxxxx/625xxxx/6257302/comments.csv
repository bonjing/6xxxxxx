Why would you say something so fucking stupid. If you actually downloaded it and couldn't get it to work that's your dumbass problem. It's a simple AVI file and plays in all players. Anyone wanting to see this movie go ahead and DL it. It's very watchable for sure ... a little bit dark, but the audio is good.

@swissjoe ... you're slacking dude ... why didn't you copy/paste you're ""TS"" bullshit on this one? ... come on ... educate us ... It's a TS .... or ""at least"" very good cam audio"

You can try to use K-lite's codec package but frankly I think you're getting yourself in deeper than needed. I think this release has some problems for Canadian / American viewers."

When it comes to cinavia, you can convert it into format you wish, but it will still be there.

Cinavia is getting to be a serious pain in the ass for us PS3 users. I hope its creaters die a slow and painful death!"

Most of these movies are monitored, the reason they're not removed is because Piratebay (who so graciously hosts the torrents) bobs and weaves around the legality behind copyright laws (mainly keeping safe harbor in countries that don't have these bullshit laws). So know a little bit about what you're talking about before you start calling names. Also, Peer Guardian is a great tool to use, but it is in no way, shape, or form fool proof. "
,bajungadustin,2011-05-18T16:49Z,"@joe4sale

You should really know what you are talking about before you start runnin your mouth.

The only videos that are monitored to the extend that say.. might have a trojan on it that would back door your system and send movie companies your ip and address would be critic copies of movies. There is not way that a TS that was recorded somehow magically transferred a tracker to the video camera. personally i dont think that any of that happens. first of all i have never gotten one and second it would be a waste of time. there si too many people torrenting to take action. there are a few examples in the media but those are distributers not DL'ers. And if you didnt know.. the 4 guys running the pirate bay went to jail.. because the sweedish government altered the laws as such so that the movie, game, and music industries could take them down.

Following the conviction, the IFPI demanded that Swedish internet service providers block The Pirate Bay, but the ISPs have refused to do this.[80] Jon Karlung, managing director of Bahnhof, stated that ""we will not censor sites for our customers; that is not our job. I am against anything that contradicts the principle of a free and open Internet.""

and an even bigger problem.. is you literally cant shut the pirate bay down. there are backuip servers all across the world.. it one goes down they all go down. And the reason for this is because they can no longer ""Hide"" in safe harbor in sweeden because the loop hole no longer applies to torrenting and P2P.

so maybe you should know a little more about what you are talking about."

,gnetix,2011-06-02T21:56Z,Thanks but it doesn't play on the Playstation due to the Cinavia encoding thing. I knew that Blu-ray disks sometimes had this but not a camera upload. I wish you guys would stop using the Cinavia program to convert videos :(

You really are a fucking idiot aren't you. Before you spout off telling people:

""bajungadustin at 2011-05-18 16:49 CET:
@joe4sale

You should really know what you are talking about before you start runnin your mouth.""

Maybe you should really know what you're talking about. Most torrent clients tell you the IPs of everyone you're connected to. Wow. That was hard, idiot.

Also you wrote this paragraph, with all of your mastery of brain power:
""and an even bigger problem.. is you literally cant shut the pirate bay down. there are backuip servers all across the world.. it one goes down they all go down. And the reason for this is because they can no longer ""Hide"" in safe harbor in sweeden because the loop hole no longer applies to torrenting and P2P.""

This paragraph contradicts itself at least twice. You can't shut down the pirate bay but if you take one server down, of the many across the world, they all go down and this is because you can't hide in Sweden?

Let me reiterate: IDIOT!

Yeah, I'm a month late on that, but it felt good."

This isn't a very good cam version - top of a person's head is visible near bottom right of the screen, picture is a little blurry and sound is what you would expect - I guess?

I went on to get FXG's d/l and it's MUCH better by far, (as it's a DVD copy).

Thank you Froggie100 for taking the time to put this up - I do appreciate it (albeit my comments) but I have to be honest on what I have seen from this torrent and then people can make up their own minds.  Thanks again :) -x-"
