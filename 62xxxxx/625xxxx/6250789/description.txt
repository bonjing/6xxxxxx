"Maureen Oâ€™Hara and Lucille Ball star as dancers in this romantic comedy about two very different personalities in the same chorus line.  Oâ€™Hara is the young Irish red head (complete with her original accent) who loves classical dance more than anything in the world, and Ball is the burlesque queen who loves rich men.  The romance comes in when they end up competing for the same man, but itâ€™s not really all that important who wins.  The most significant theme is that of the serious dancer struggling to overcome her crass, bourgeois surroundings and establish herself as an artist.

Oâ€™Hara may have received top billing in this film, but with the exception of a scene in which Judy lashes out at the jeering burlesque crowd who is mocking her classical dance, Ball steals the show with her outlandish personality and entertaining strip tease dances.  Overall itâ€™s interesting as one of Oâ€™Haraâ€™s earliest films (her second in the U.S.), but youâ€™ll get more out of it if youâ€™re a Lucy fan anxious to see her on the big screen. Oh, and if you like cat fights, this film has a tempestuous one. "
