,tscardino,2011-03-21T06:00Z,just downloaded this.. no different from the other versions on here even though it says this is a DVDR in the nfo. also left part of the screen is cut off. i would recommend waiting for a better version to come out
,Plasmadude,2011-03-21T17:38Z,"somewhat kool in the beginning but overall a shit movie.  it has no value of any kind,unless your a kid getting stoned, probably OK then"
,letovsky,2011-03-21T19:40Z,Is used as the source of recording from a cinema. Subsequently transferred to the VOB. Poor quality. It makes no sense to download.

,xhomezorzx,2011-03-29T10:11Z,"So sick of idiots posting bullshit cam vids in the DVDR section, it's called DVDR, because it is a section meant for ripped videos straight from dvd/bluray discs. Quit posting your garbage up here just to disappoint leechers with your crap torrent, you inbred clown...."
