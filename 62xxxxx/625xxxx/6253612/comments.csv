,Gh057man,2011-05-17T07:16Z,Not only have you rar'ed 15Mb worth of files you have also compressed those rars!??? I fail to see the logic in compressing any torrent files; particularly for one this small. At the very least it is a sure way to kill off seeding - as most sensible seeders will delete these files as soon as they extract them. You're an A-grade f***stick for wasting the torrent community's time.
