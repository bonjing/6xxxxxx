,lucid657,2011-03-17T18:53Z,"@peeyoosh

yeah, but his rip is smaller due to the fact that he removed the audio (even though he said he didnt)"
,pirateola,2011-03-17T19:21Z,"Globe's rip may be 1.86GB but it does not have any sound/audio files and I may also go ahead and guess that it does not have any video/movies as well.

Will download this as a game without audio/video is not worth playing, I guess globe likes it that way."
[V],gansuk,2011-03-17T20:30Z,globes rip has everything removed audio vids and mp im guessing hes deaf this rip would of bin upped around same time as his rip but i grabbed it to see why it was so small compared to kaos rip but with no audio and vids its gonna be alot smaller so i decided to release this here since its almost full with just english language only the other language is removed in this rip

,blackmamba007,2011-03-21T20:19Z,"Thanks for the game. For the first time the game runs fine but when I exit the game and restart the game, the main menu doesn't appear and a white screen with no text in it. That's not your fault and its from the Ubisoft's side, thats why they have released some patches. But my problem is I can't install any patch and get this error ""Could not retrieve installation folder!"". So, I need the registry entries, Can you please provide me the registry entries."
