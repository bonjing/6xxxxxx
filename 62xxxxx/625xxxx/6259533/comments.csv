Can't wait to see the first race of the season."

,55trucker,2011-03-21T20:16Z,"First off...Thx to the OP who uploaded the file for sharing..appreciated. 
This file is not the BBC broadcast that is commercial free. This is the american broadcaster Speed program. Americans for some reason find the necessity to ruin their broadcasts by taking sponsor breaks all thru their programming and this is no exception. You get three mins of racing ---three mins of sponsor breaks... etc. etc. The original 80min broadcast has been edited to fit a 60min time slot including sponsor breaks. The american broadcasters are still living in the dark ages. When will they stop letting their sponsors dictate policy where program breaks are concerned. "
