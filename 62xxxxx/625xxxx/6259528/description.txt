This is a documentary regarding the staged death of Mohamed Al Dura and the subsequent coverup, the medias disregard for truth and lack of journalistic integrity, the court case of Philippe Karsenty who proved the fraud committed by France2, and the Israeli public reaction which till today is largely ignorant of the facts of this case.
This is the full DVD. In order to play it you should open your DVD player and then use advanced file option to open the folder. If someone can rip it to a smaller AVI file it will be easier. 
The documentary is a mix of English, German, Frech, Arabic, and Hebrew with Hebrew subs hard-coded accordingly. An English sub file is desperately needed.
