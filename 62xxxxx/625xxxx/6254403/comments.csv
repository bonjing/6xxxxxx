,IkkuHihi,2011-03-19T18:41Z,"

@slosh74

You need to install the game first via this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6242645/installer_for_homefront

And then crack it. :)"
,amazlng,2011-03-19T20:45Z,Whats the fuck with all gay stuff? and spam links? lets wait for some genuine crack..

,Peeez,2011-03-19T22:38Z,Well you can play the game but... wth this doesn't fix the sound or the ammo!??!?
,UFO.Sule,2011-03-19T23:56Z,it fix ammo and sound :D
,3x1t,2011-03-20T00:09Z,"meh.. not even worth it to fix this game, graphics suck game story sucks even more, and the game play sucks completely...

better play assassins creed brotherhood :) "
,ExSysEXE,2011-03-20T02:35Z,"@ 3x1t- Hey Trolltwit. These are comments for the crack fix WITH sound + ammo bug fix, which seem to work just marvelously. Why don't you go find an Assassin's Creed torrent with a ton of comments, find a Cosplayer there and go suck his dick. GTFO."
,fredalt,2011-03-20T04:37Z,"PLEASE HELP!

I got the other crack working, but not this one.

Already passed the first mission, since there's nothing that define a first mission, I'm almost sure that I've passed, because I already got to the refugees camp, soooo... when I run with this crack, the game won't even start, and I receive a message from windows saying that the program doesn't respond (in portuguese that's the term we use, I dunno how it is shown in the english version), just like when a program crashes.

Any hints??

By the way, thanks UFO, although this crack is not working, the otherone is totally playable.
Man, I love piracy.

COPY COPY COPY COPY"
,dubai1991,2011-03-20T04:54Z,it works for both the sound and ammo bugs....thanks UFO

,ChicoChico,2011-03-20T17:12Z,"Works for me.

No need for lowering volume, this fixes both ammo and sound issues, well at least for me."
,Fa1con87,2011-03-20T17:29Z,"This doesnt work, when you copy and paste it comes with an error saying that the program wont start! 

Any ideas?"
,Ninjen,2011-03-20T18:44Z,"idk if this is obvious or not, but the radio music plays way to loudly amongst all other sounds. if this crackfix supposedly corrects this, it didnt for me.

however, simply turning down the music in the system options solves it"
,yoshez,2011-03-20T18:44Z,Let me know when you're going to make actually WORKING crack lol
,Ninjen,2011-03-20T19:03Z,"lol i was up to the point where you had to cross a street without being spotted by the sentry gun. and then Satan himself teleported me to somewhere out of the area and i had to huff it back the the objective point. (jk about Satan) anyway, any idea how this happend? i was able to find a newspaper on the way, floating on the grass"
,UFO.Sule,2011-03-20T19:08Z,"@Fa1con87 
try restarting computer if not make fresh install of homefront using phoenix and crack it... shout work "
,fredalt,2011-03-20T23:48Z,"@UFO.Sule
i got the same problem, and i used the phoenix to install, i cant reinstall because i've deleted the files, but it shouldn't be a problem of installation, because the other crack you made works.
Please help man, this game is already buggy as it is."
,BRATB,2011-03-21T06:02Z,"Thanks UFO :D
Worked for me.
The others should appreciate
the time you spent working on this.
The game is not bad, I give it 6.8-7."
,Peeez,2011-03-21T15:26Z,"damn didn't work for me.
I installed the game with phoenix 1.5 and took the crack from the other torrent, because this one didn't have any. I copy over the Binaries and GCGame folder over to the installed folder."
,Wolfwood428,2011-03-21T18:19Z,man Thank you soo much.
,dunderpuffran,2011-03-21T21:43Z,"i still cant the sound to work :/ i got NO sound at all :( please help if any1 can..

and btw thx alot UFO (y)"
,Laranth,2011-03-21T21:48Z,"SOUND FIX

In windows 7, you can try to go to 

My Documents -> My Games -> Choose Homefront -> then GCGAME then Config, there's GCENGINE.ini, delete GCENGINE.ini! 

This is the easiest way for you to fix Homefront no sound bug! "
,vincentdesrd,2011-03-21T22:29Z,Deleting GCENGINE.ini does NOT fix the choppy crappy sound issue.
,lordnaul,2011-03-22T00:38Z,"works great, sound fixed. but now i get a wired mouse thing. when i stand still i keep slowly turning to the right. all other games are fine and this only appeared after i used this fix. any ideas? "

In level 2 you cannot jump over the fence to throw the grenade behind the sentury gun.  You start to go over it, then slide back into place.  one person said jumping over it teleports you, I wish this was the case, i cannot complete level 2 right now.  Game was fun sofar... "
,Peeez,2011-03-23T15:09Z,Can someone tell me how exactly install this fix crack thing?
,UFO.Sule,2011-03-23T20:38Z,"extract Homefront crack ammo+sound fix.rar to your desktop and open folder u extracted then copy two folder from extracted folder to your homefront installation folder... it will ask you to overwrite old files with new and you click yes :D

if game wont start or it crashes at start use my other crack with same installation as this to pass 1 level... and after u finish 1 level use this crack again (do the same thing to install it) :D "
,wesb2,2011-03-23T22:28Z,Well I tried beating the first mission (i think I'm onto the third even) using the other crack and the game still won't launch for me with this crack on win7 64bit

,woopwoot,2011-03-25T01:49Z,"i know this may seem like a nooby question : P, but is steam supposed to open up when I run the iso? because its asking for a serial...or am I ment to dum the files somewhere?"

Still a bug, but not a gamebreaker"
