        Based  on  bestselling  author  Alistair  MacLeans  novel  of
        intrigue  and mystery,  Golden Rendezvous  is a  heady mix  of
        action and  suspense set  on the  high seas  of the  Caribbean
        Ocean.

        Aboard the converted passenger liner SS Campari, Chief Officer
        John Carter  (Richard Harris,  Gladiator) senses  something is
        drastically afoot after sabotage is attributed to a succession
        of unfortunate  delays. When  a crew  member goes  missing the
        rising mood of jeopardy suddenly turns violent, thrusting  the
        whole ship into instant turmoil. Armed with an atomic  device,
        master criminal Luis Carreras  (John Vernon, The Outlaw  Josey
        Wales)  hijacks the  ship and  intends to  ransom his  wealthy
        passengers for the golden contents of a US Treasury ship.

        With the  stakes raised,  it is  up to  Carter and his rag-tag
        crew to overcome the odds and rescue the hostages before  time
        runs  out.  Featuring  character  stalwarts  Burgess  Meredith
        (Rocky)  and  Gordon  Jackson  (The  Whistle  Blower),  Golden
        Rendezvous speeds along in the gripping tradition of Die  Hard
        and Under Siege.
