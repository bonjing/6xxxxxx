Converted from an official released VHS tape. This is actually a great promo video for the Bat Out of Hell 2 album. The DVD contains video clips of several Bat 2 songs, interviews with Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman and also some live performances. The live footage is from the History of Meat Loaf TV show. There are also behind-the-scenes footage on creating the music video's. All in all very entertaining stuff.
