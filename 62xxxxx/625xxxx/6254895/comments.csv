,Dr-nidO,2011-03-19T17:56Z,Many thanks for this one
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-19T18:05Z,"@jotalopes: It's old Black&White, very rare. Grab that torrent while you can. I have that movie somewhere, but small-sized and well... maybe not suitable."
,hkoraddi,2011-03-19T19:57Z,"thank you twentyforty.

your 480p is more clear then the 720p(they look like a pixated upscaled rips) available out.i even prefer your 320p over the 720p of others as ur rips are more clear den theres."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-19T20:06Z,"Thank you my friend. However, obviously producers of this movie have chosen bad company to produce Blu-Ray because this one is not... well... a nice one."
,hkoraddi,2011-03-19T20:07Z,now i think i know one of the person who is giving u -ve its banukaknight he is misleading about u with stupid craps even on riddlers page.
,qudube,2011-03-19T20:43Z,Thank you for your consideration for this encode and sharing your work  Twentyforty. . 
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-19T21:02Z,"@hkoraddi Well, it's maybe a way to say me Thanks for putting Lie To Me in TV Pack. He is very, very sick, probably.

It's Hindu way for thanking me for upping Hindu Bollywood CD last week.

BTW, he admitted to give me gazillion of minuses with words ""I can't resist.""

He and other Indian friends give all minuses. Comments (102 comments on ""Boat  that...)  where they have been caught and admitted are - deleted, by their moral supporters."
,froglog,2011-03-19T21:29Z,Thanks

,t.trikiti,2011-03-20T08:34Z,thanks! sharing like crazy!
,suryamukhi,2011-03-20T12:26Z,"i m also hindu, but never give u minus.."
,suryamukhi,2011-03-20T12:27Z,i have given you at least 40 + in past 1 hour by just closing and opening my browser in your last 3 torrent..
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-20T13:46Z,"@suryamukhi:  I know, I hate generalizations and my remark has nothing to do with religion. But - the statistic (and history) bears the truth, of endless bitterness - for me, personally. My torrents are literally swarmed by yellow-white-green, but instead of just a shred of gratitude, I get - too little plain Thanks to be true. Let me repeat  what I said yesterday: Three Canadian peers I see in Download queue, and I got thanks from all of them, same goes for people from Australia and New Zealand. Point being, I know my ""regulars"" almost by name.

Contrary to that, your folk leads the crusade against me. Are Hollywood joined forces with Bollwood outsourcing their Witch-hunt against P2P? Anwer is, sorely, yes.

Are all people the same? Yes, by color of blood. Differences are in the heads, my Hindu fellow.

BTW, I have right here, few nice people from your country, couple of them I address and comprehend as Friends, but involvement in ultimately nefarious activities against me is, I am sorry, too much ""from one direction"" to be neglected or taken easily.

,hkoraddi,2011-03-20T14:15Z,well i am Indian and Hindu too well cant blame u for anything.one rotten tomato rottens the whole bucket.
,ArtieT,2011-03-20T15:59Z,"As formerly_azrielle noticed before, the hard-coded craziness with the voting system is happening again - now when you vote '+' for this torrent or more recent ones the '- ' count goes up by TWO, and if you vote '-', the '-' vote goes up by THREE (sorry, I had to check)! 

This again suggests at the very least that some twisted, petty individual with access to TPB code is targeting 20-40 - why?? And why are the mods not doing something???  

The last time we talked about this, the comments got deleted - I wonder if the same will happen again???"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-20T16:46Z,"@ArtieT: Only TPB Administrator (higher ranked than Moderator) or Mod. with Admin. rights can access the sit code and modify it.
So, answer to your question is - obvious."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-20T16:49Z,"ERR (damn keyboard)

sit = site
"
,Ataractic,2011-03-20T18:25Z,"2040: I agree with your thoughts about 'Hindu's, but extend it to 'Indians'. As I have seen, almost all my countrymen, no matter their religion, have a false sense of entitlement: if anyone helps them once (like you always do), they EXPECT to get help from the same source again and again. and they seem fit to criticize the effort, which cost them nothing in the first place.

I wish I could dish out some advice other than 'ignore the motherf*****rs', but I can't. On behalf of my countrymen who cause grief- I am Sorry."
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-20T18:26Z,"oh its bad.. about - thing.. but I guess we should start voting in minus haha lol.. sorry my bad, Dont know what to do from all the way here siting in himalayan hill. 

@20-40 .. Nice to know that you are a Stickler too, Its an Honor, to know that part of you. :) I hate that sometimes too but don't worry about a few typos once in a while, I wish we could use Edit option on comments :)

And Its good that you choose to make this 700mb rip on 480p resolution. I wonder how YiFY do it man its crazy to see his rips, I wish I could see the preset settings for his. "
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-20T19:15Z,"There IS a bright side to this, twentyforty, and it is this--the largely minus averages will tend to keep the hit and run leechers from downloading your encodes.  Whereas those who have become acquainted with your quality, will download your encodes, and, more importantly, will spread the word by way of word of mouth to their friends and by positive comments."
,johnnyO,2011-03-21T06:17Z,"Thank you once again 20/40, another top torrent, you are #1"
