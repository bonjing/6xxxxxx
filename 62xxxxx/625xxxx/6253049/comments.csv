,silveroakleaf,2011-03-19T03:54Z,"I've been downloading torrents for almost a year and really haven't noticed the +/- until a couple months ago when I started doing my own torrents. Who cares how many minuses there are? It's like email spam and web ads, I just tune them out.

The true measure of a torrent's quality are the number of seeds, well written reviews/comments (both positive and negative), and the overall long term reputation of the up-loader.

I say boycott the +/- system! "

,steeevo_j,2011-03-21T19:22Z,"I agree with silveroakleaf, the -ve is a waste of time and obviously open to abuse as we are clearly seeing.
This is SPAM!"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-25T00:38Z,"This is a really good movie!  A=10, V=11!"
