The 1st book of Ross MacDonald's acclaimed Lou Archer series. The books can be enjoyed in any order as there is no series continuity in terms of plot or character/relationship development. Although this is the first of the series, I wouldn't advise basing the quality of the series as a whole on this first effort. It's not a bad book but the series does improve in later novels.
Brief synopsis:
Private detective Lou Archer is hired by the wife of a wealthy man to investigate her husband's  sudden disappearance.
