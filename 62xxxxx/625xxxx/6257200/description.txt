Comments :
Before leaving on his second tour in Afghanistan, Marine Captain Sam 
Cahill, a leader, an athlete, a good husband and father, welcomes his 
screw-up brother Tommy home from prison. He'd robbed a bank. In country, 
Sam's helicopter is shot down and all are presumed dead. Back home, while 
Sam wastes away as a prisoner in a remote encampment, Tommy tries to take 
care of the widow and her two children. While imprisoned, Sam experiences 
horrors unbearable, so when he's rescued and returns home, he's silent, 
detached, without affect, and he's convinced his wife and brother have 
slept together. Demons of war possess him; what will silence them?
