Newsjack is a topical sketch show from BBC Radio 7. The show aims to get comic mileage from the news - political, cultural, sports, and trivia. Hosted by Miles Jupp, the tone is lively, satirical, and distinctly irreverent.

Many of the sketches are written by members of the public, as the programme is happy to accept unsolicited material.

Regular strands currently include:

The Newsjack App: Newsjack has moved into the 21st Century and finally got its own "app". Well, actually, it's just the answerphone of a Nokia 3310. But like the "Vox Pops" of previous series, this is the perfect place to air your one-liners or quick jokes. They can be about any prominent news issue and these messages will then be heard throughout the show.

NewsFox: Newsjack's gun-totin', burger-munchin' cousin from the other side of the Pond. This feature will take the form of a quick Transatlantic news round-up - but with everything dealt with in rapid speed and with a very right-wing, tabloid perspective. We would also like very short one-liners which can act as stings. For example: NewsFox: For the right to bear News.

The 60-second Interview: Ronseal. Miles has to interview a topical guest in 60 seconds. Who is he talking to? What is he asking? Why does he only have 60 seconds? You decide.

The Newsjack Analyst: A new character who has been brought in to analyse both the news and Newsjack's coverage of it, albeit in the style of a sports pundit, e.g. our pundit talks us through Ed Miliband's defensive mistakes, or how David Cameron could improve his technique...

NewsDog: Radio 7's flagship consumerist comedy segment. Each week, Miles will tackle the big issues affecting the down-trodden consumer. Yes, the Government has bailed out the banks to the tune of Â£3billion but what has that done to the length of the chains on the pens? Or are you a Mayor of London concerned you may have entrusted the building of a multi-million pound Olympic stadium to cowboy builders? NewsDog can help.

Newsjack Films: Since the British Film Council has gone up the spout, Newsjack has bravely stepped in and started producing topical films. This is your opportunity to write the film trailer for this week's film...e.g...(at the time of writing) "Andy Gray's Anatomy"

Corrections: An old "favourite" and another good opportunity for short jokes. At the end of the show these 'corrections' pretend to address any mistakes we made in last week's show.

"And finally...": A post-credits sequence where we pretend the current episode, in keeping with a lot of Radio 7's output, is an old show and make jokes about how the world might have changed since the programme went out. Listen to the end of an episode to get a feeling for it.


 
http://www.comedy.co.uk Review: 
This show has made a positive impression on us. Each week, some skits fall flat, but there's also always at least a couple of gems in each episode to keep us entertained.

Newsjack should certainly be praised for giving new writers a chance to get their sketches broadcast. Quite a number of aspiring writers managed to get material on the first three series of the show and it is expected even more will make it onto this new fourth series. To find out more about how to write for the show see the Newsjack website and this blog entry by script-editor Dan Tetsell.
