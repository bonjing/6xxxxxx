,Wokrakken,2011-03-19T03:26Z,"The sound is on a 2.5 second delay. If you use VLC player, just hold the J button until it says ""Audio delay 2500ms"""
,weaping_reaper,2011-03-19T07:34Z,"@Wokrakken .. Thank you dude, Ive been using VLC for about a year now, and I didn't know that shortcut.. I just use to go into tools/Track synchronization , but holding J and K is a whole lot easier now, because now, I can actually see if its going into sync or not. :-D"
