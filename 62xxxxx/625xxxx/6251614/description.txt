Chocolate News was a satirical fake news show hosted and head written by David Alan Grier with an emphasis on African American culture. Chocolate News aired satirical pieces and sketches about current events and news stories. The show satirized these stories with a focus on how Grier thinks typical African Americans view them. Sketches were directed by Rusty Cundieff, who directed the most sketches on Chappelle's Show.

The show ran for one season in 2008 on Comedy Central. Ten episodes in all, but I couldn't find the last one.
