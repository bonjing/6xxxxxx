This is a big one. I have included every comic I have that is based on characters created by Robert E Howard. The most well known and popular are of course Conan & Red Sonja, but there are also Kull, Solomon Kane, Cormac Mac Art, and others.

I do not claim that this is complete because I just don't think I'm lucky enough to have it all and there are some reprint issues that I know are missing. If you can fill in anything then please do.
