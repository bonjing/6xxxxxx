K heres the deal with this, thought i was getting a 2 parter rar when i downloaded this that extracted to a single vid, nope, its 10 parts of the video, i have no idea why they did it that way, however it fits on the handhelds the way they did it(hence why i tagged it that way) 

Its great quality, I dunno where Rudos is this week, however i will play again next week lol.

The parts are in mp4 format, just make sure you got them in order in the playlist and your good, i checked, no missing parts, its the full show. 

NO PASSWORDS ON THE RAR, honestly I HATE putting up rars for you guys cuz its hard as hell to convince you its legit. But rather than upset all you, I've warned you in advanced it multipart video(and NO not like that release we wont all talk about) its not a webripz, its looking to clear for webripz.


So i do apologize for upping it in rar I didnt put a password on it, just extract it where ever, you'll be fine(tylenol for headaches, midol for cramps) So dont download it and then extract it go WTF and come back here and flame cuz i did warn you in advance.But the quality is great.I was gonna combine it but wasnt gonna make you guys wait longer. Total size of extraction is 980 Megs.
