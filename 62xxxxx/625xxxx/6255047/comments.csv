,DjHero,2011-06-16T09:12Z,"This just doesn't work with my computer. First it said my computer didn't have ""d3dx9_42.dll"" and after i acquired it, now it immediately says ""PamMainGame.exe has stopped working"""

,ToxicCookie,2011-07-08T00:20Z,"Would like to point out that the game only costs 4,5âŹ during the Steam summer sale, for those interested. More purchases means more DLC in the future, after all ^^"

,extral1f3,2011-10-10T01:53Z,I Have this game but the quality of all the words are so low i cannot read them but is not a problem other than that fact. I dont know how to attack or anything. what are the default controls? Anyone?
,extral1f3,2011-10-10T01:59Z,"Btw, this installed perfectly for me. I have tried 4 times before in the past, couldn't get it to work and deleted the .Iso. 
Here are the steps I took if it helps anyone:
1. Download
2. Mount .Iso
3. Open The Disk (Explore or Open in New Window)
4. Run Steambackup2.exe
5. Put Crack Found On The Iso Into PAM Install Folder (Copy and Replace)
6. Don't Forget To Support The Software Companies!
7. Have Fun :)"
