Great job and great quality.

I skipped ahead once or twice to check before watching,  and stopped at a scene with subtitles.  :D,  I was all like,  what the fuck is going on.

Thanks for sharing this."

Pretty good picture for a cam just a bit dark, the audio is spot on, there‘s no sync or bad distortion problems that normally come with a cam copy. So all in all a Good watchable copy... 
Many Thanx to qwersd and T0XiCiNK for the Decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"

,ust2,2011-03-25T12:18Z," Can anyone confirm it not playing on PS3?

 I've downloaded others in the past where people said they didn't work, but playing them from a usb-stick (display all) and it worked just fine."
,ust2,2011-03-26T01:21Z," This WILL play on PS3.

 Just as I figured too lol. I don't know what method the people saying that a movie won't play on PS3 are using, but I havn't had any problems playing anything from a USB thumb drive.

 Just stick the file on one of those, goto Video, select the stick, press triangle and goto 'Display all', and play!

 Simple as that."

 Movies like these don't need crystal clear video to be enjoyed anyways, as long as you can still see what is going on and the audio is fine, that's all you need."
,billnie,2011-03-26T03:31Z,thats why ps3 sucks nigger cock and xbox is leet because you dont get fag messages sayn this is protected by fag corp
,ust2,2011-03-26T04:28Z," Er.. I guess it does not play on PS3 afterall >:(

 Sorry for the confusion.

 I only tested a few minutes before, just went to watch it and for some reason when it plays continuously for a few minutes that ""protected by Cinavia"" message pops up.

 It's strange because you can fast forward to any spot, it doesn't matter where, but as soon as it plays for a few minutes that messages appears."
,edium,2011-03-26T23:11Z,this is really good for a TS. very watchable 9/10
,imahaxyoo,2011-03-27T03:39Z,"For a cam this is VERY GOOD.Probably one of the better cams I've seen on TPB. If you're one of those people who absolutely cannot stand cams then don't bother with this, it is still a cam.

As for movie total let down, a disconnect is felt between seth rogen and the two brits throughout...worth watching in 1080 maybe but not in this quality just makes things worse.."

The movie is funny, cant go wrong with Seth IMO, the cam does go fuzzy sometimes in the flick, but not to much to irate me atleast... Its a okay looking copy for a cam, gotta be one of the better ones I have seen on the site.

The Audio is kind of jacked up, but if you have a good player that you can tweak your options, I simple just 'Normalized' the Audio and it sounded 50+% better then leaving it alone. The Video needs to be tweaked a little too, not much, but it is watchable for anyone who wants to see the movie asap, if not you should wait for a better clean copy. "
,yrogerg123,2011-04-27T07:14Z,"To lethalbynature: it's not spam. Check for the pirate symbol when you're skeptical. 

Also, check the sample first, the quality really is not that good, so I'll be waiting. But thanks for the upload anyway."

,Craigos87,2011-05-09T21:02Z,This is decent quality for cam. From the sample the audio is fine. The video is ok but the dark scene used in the sample isn't an accurate portrayal of the quality. In my opinion if you want free its as good as its gonna get.
