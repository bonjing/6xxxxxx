BUDDY GUY A MAN AND THE BLUES
Audio CD  October 25, 1990 
Label: Vanguard
Format: Flac

Buddy Guy's greatest album is also his debut full-length session as a leader. "One Room Country Shack," "Mary Had a Little Lamb" (a Stevie Ray Vaughan favorite), "Sweet Little Angel," and "Worry, Worry" are defining songs, full of high-wire vocal dynamics and guitar work of almost balletic poise. The tone of Guy's 1957 Fender six-string remains the benchmark for nearly every blues player who's since hefted a Stratocaster. This CD is as tasteful and dramatic as Guy's 1990s performances are brash and assaultive. Producer Samuel Charters, the noted blues historian, caught Guy just as he was emerging from the shadow of B.B. King and Muddy Waters, and provided an excellent cast of supporting musicians, including the underrated guitar genius Wayne Bennett, gritty piano virtuoso Otis Spann, and Muddy's redoubtable drummer Fred Below. The results are blues perfection. --Ted Drozdowski
