    Groby Old Hall in Leicestershire was once home to the      
    legendary White Queen: Elizabeth, the wife of Edward IV   
    The Team are here to help the new owners, who have       
    saved the house from dereliction, to find out what has    
    gone on in their garden over the centuries.                
                                                              
    It's full of tantalising glimpses of archaeology: a      
    medieval wall with a window, carved stones and what       
    looks like the remains of a Norman castle. Sorting this    
    lot out is the kind of challenge the Team can't resist.   
                                                             
    Over three days they discover this remarkable piece of    
    land contains over 600 years of archaeology. It may        
    seem run down now but it once belonged to one of the      
    most powerful families in medieval Britain, the Greys.

    trenches as Tony is joined by historian and

    piece together the intriguing tale of this power-hungry   
    family.
