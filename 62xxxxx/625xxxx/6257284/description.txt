When the motorcyclist Johnny Blaze finds that his father Barton Blaze has a terminal 
cancer, he accepts a pact with the Mephistopheles, giving his soul for the health of 
his beloved father. But the devil deceives him, and Barton dies in a motorcycle 
accident during an exhibition. Johnny leaves the carnival, his town, his friends and 
his girlfriend Roxanne. Years later Johnny Blaze becomes a famous motorcyclist, who 
risks his life in his shows, and he meets Roxanne again, now a TV reporter. However, 
Mephistopheles proposes Johnny to release his contract if he become the "Ghost Rider" 
and defeat his evil son Blackheart, who wants to possess one thousand evil souls and 
transform hell on earth.
