CD Description
'21' is the second album from singer-songwriter Adele, and like her first record, 2008's '19', it is named after the age Adele was when she wrote the album. Most of '21' was produced by Rick Rubin, who has worked with some of the biggest acts of the last 20 years, and Florence & The Machine producer Paul Epworth. Lyrically the album reflects Adele's increased maturity since '19', although it explores many of the same themes.

Found the FLAC from various sites and torrents. I re-encoded them because ipod doesnt support FLAC and the file sizes are rather large. 

Download and check out the quality. You wont be able to tell the difference between these and the originals unless you're a serious audiophile.
 
Enjoy!!
