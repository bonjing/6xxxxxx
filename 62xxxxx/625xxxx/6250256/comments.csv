Probably one of the better movies I've seen in a while, and the quality is near perfect. "

,waffles4you4ever1,2011-06-02T22:48Z,"Hey guys, Them movie was Amazing.

Buttt. I just got a letter from my internet provider saying that they knew I had downloaded it. I have comcast, so idk if that helps. It just said it was a warning, and to not do it again. So im guessing this is copyrighted protected some how?

How do I stop this from happening again? I hear peer blocker is a good thing to use?"
,gcharitha,2011-07-14T14:09Z,very good quality & a movie.
,janhighboy,2011-07-19T04:07Z,"Haven't watched this one yet but it downloaded very quickly. Just a word of warning, I received a total of 8 DMCA notices for this torrent from Qwest, my ISP. My internets were locked out so I called customer service. They turned it back on after I agreed to delete the material and emailed me the list of 15 offenses. There were 6 for Dinner for Schmucks and one for Xmen 1st Class. I do use Peerblock so there must be a few IP's that haven't been updated to the list yet."
