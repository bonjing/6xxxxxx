Born in Perth, Australia, Grace Woodroofe is about to take the music scene by storm. The indie-blues chanteuse's demo was placed in the capable hands of Ben Harper, by none other than the late great Heath Ledger, and it was love at first listen. Ben Harper quickly led her into the studio, and the debut self titled album was born. With a live show described by the LA Weekly as 'powerful, dynamic and striking', Grace has spent the last two years perfecting her live show. She was recruited by Harper to open for his North American tour in 2009, and has played many a festival, including Byron Bay's own East Coast Blues and Roots Festival and Perth's Ellington Jazz Festival. With a deep, honeyed huskiness, Grace creates amazing tales of life, youth, love and death. She is wise beyond her years; with stage presence of a seasoned performer. In the words of Mr. Ben Harper himself, 'You are not going to believe this girl'.
