Foreigner - Break It Up [Bananas tv show 1982].VOB


Very HQ Bananas tv show promo music video from an outstanding and very rare 1980's tv show from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's.

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.

"Break It Up" was the fourth single taken from the album, "4", by the band, Foreigner, and the first to feature a b-side that was not available on one of their albums, a live version of their Hit, "Head Games". The tune was written by Mick Jones and reached number 26 in the U.S. charts where the album, "4", had already gone to number 1, eventually selling more than six-times platinum.

Foreigner are a British-American rock band, originally formed in 1976 by veteran English musicians Mick Jones, ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald along with American vocalist Lou Gramm. Foreigner have sold more than 70 million albums worldwide (including over 37.5 million in the United States alone).

In June 2011, Foreigner (again along with Styx) will be supporting Journey in their UK tour.
