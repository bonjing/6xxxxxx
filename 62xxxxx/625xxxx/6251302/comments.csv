I got the other torrent by you (clone dvd version) and was waiting for proper crack for it.  I think I understand what RIP version is.  (basically it stripped out certain language file and etc to make it smaller?)

So this one is properly cracked and OK to play?  Should I delete the other one?

Thanks uploader!!!"
,john depp,2011-03-18T03:54Z,"By the way, awesome speed just like the other one... Thanks for that."
[V],DibyaTPB,2011-03-18T03:59Z,Do not delete the original iso wait for the crack. An original is much better than ripped(of course). This one works and you can play but have some bugs.
,spelonkar,2011-03-18T04:06Z,"The instructions say to mount, install, play. So im assuming this is precracked with the minimal files required for a small download although im not sure, downloading now"
,deathtrooper30,2011-03-18T04:25Z,Yeah you get free MP with every pirated game..... GTFO!
,dumas1000,2011-03-18T05:18Z,"No pirated game includes multiplayer. The main draw of how you fight PC piracy if you are a developer is to create a game that has a compelling MP component. There are some LAN-type hacks for a small handful of games, granted. For the most part, if you want the MP, you gotta buy the game."
,XyberDeath,2011-03-18T07:11Z,"The installation fails after about 40%, gonna give it one more try."
,JordanTPB,2011-03-18T07:39Z,"It works for me playing right now. Thanks Dibya, and nobody say this is fake because it works for me and Dibya is a reliable torrentor. So if its not working you probably did something wrong."
,ASAD1,2011-03-18T07:53Z,How do I change the menu and subtitles to english.
,Leignheart,2011-03-18T08:07Z,can anyone tell me what the two russian choices are in the installation?
,Leignheart,2011-03-18T08:14Z,"seriosuly how do you change to english, i need to install in english"
,Leignheart,2011-03-18T08:19Z,anyone?
,JordanTPB,2011-03-18T08:30Z,@ASAD1 I think you have to choose English as the language while installing because mine is in Russian too and I think I messed up while choosing. If not then just deal with playing in Russian.
,john depp,2011-03-18T08:51Z,it's the second choice for english
,john depp,2011-03-18T08:53Z,also there was uninstaller included so I used it to wipe my Russian version before going for it. 
,Leignheart,2011-03-18T09:12Z,"i got it to work but i can change the audio, everything is at max and it cant be changed, it makes the game quite unplayable"
,Leignheart,2011-03-18T09:13Z,i meant to say i CANT change the audio
,Leignheart,2011-03-18T09:25Z,anyone able to fix the sound issue?
,JordanTPB,2011-03-18T11:20Z,I uninstalled and reinstalled in english but for some reason when i run the game it says you must be logged into steam and own this game if you wish to play it. Help?
,JordanTPB,2011-03-18T11:24Z,"Nevermind, Ran as administrator and it worked."
,clemlenain,2011-03-18T15:07Z,Where is Stoked for pc ?
,me_demon815,2011-03-19T06:35Z,"i tried to open setup but it say the file is too long to fit in memory !

,defecator,2011-03-19T10:14Z,"What's ripped from the game? It doesn't say in the torrent description, nor it the comments."
,scopio,2011-03-19T11:37Z,This installation totaly killed my pc lol
,danniboy123,2011-03-20T12:16Z,thx!
,Ness86,2011-03-21T10:02Z,"The multiplayer doesn't work ... :( 

The multiplayer work with other pirated game (bulletstorm,batmanAA,COd4...etc)"
,itsfelix,2011-03-22T05:53Z,This game is only the singleplayer with only the Russian and English files. It has a number of bugs. But if you just want to try it out then this torrent is for you. It's only a 2.7 gig download compared to the other torrents (8 gig).
