,doneffa,2011-03-19T21:21Z,no more jokes or fakes?
,raduciu,2011-03-19T21:30Z,"Game is cheap i bought it. That ""support the games you like"" got me on this one."
,CobraN8,2011-03-19T21:43Z,dont work.
,ToonForever,2011-03-19T21:52Z,"Works 100% thanks lads!! am at turn 14 now with no crashes, before I got CTD all the time at turn 10"
,unrealdj,2011-03-19T21:54Z,"This is real, but ya like he said, you HAVE to install it over the other chinese crack.
If you do a fresh shogun 2 install and use this it wont work without the 1st crack.

Fixes so far, 
Saves work (Old saves are destroyed/not working)
no message about it being a cracked game after ranom amount of turns"
,slaindz,2011-03-19T22:00Z,"Also, you have to start a new campaign.

Any saves made with the old patch will still corrupt."
,1phoenix1,2011-03-19T22:15Z,"It`s all chineese, what button should I press to install it?"
,RedXIIIx,2011-03-19T22:53Z,"@1phoenix1

The top left button that says v1.0 DVD v2"
,ToonForever,2011-03-19T23:07Z,"1phoenix1 - press first top left button and wait for install, make sure you have V1 crack installed as well"
,1phoenix1,2011-03-19T23:16Z,"RedXIIIx, ToonForever thanks, seems to be working... for now."
,Illanair,2011-03-19T23:25Z,Seems to work - Haven't played enough turns to test it properly though.
