,Tamarind777,2011-03-21T04:18Z,"Oh, give me a break with this foolishness. Folks simply have a problem with the God of the Bible not the Bible itself. God has called everyone to repentance or be lost and you love pleasure more than God, so you try and discredit the Bible. The Bible is fine just the way it is. What you have a problem with it judgment. Even if it were tampered with, it still contains the essentials and much more to lead us to Christ and empower the sinner to live above sin and the world. Get with the program, because you WILL be judged soon."
,sarsapil,2011-03-21T04:36Z,"HOW SOON...?  God, I must get a good lawyer then... C'mon, get real, get a life, stop making the life of Bible parasites easy... Wake up, snap out of it, be an adult..."
,ed.boey,2011-03-21T10:37Z,"One thing for sure:

Jesus ain't Christian and JESUS CERTAINLY AIN'T MOSLEM AND HE IS NOT ARAB. Stop wasting your time trying to convince other people about your ""PERFECT RELIGION"" and your ""PERFECT PROPHET"".

Just use your own brain and let others use their own brain to make their own decisions. But one thing for sure, your satanic god will command you to hate and kill others who cannot see any truth about your religion."
,principlemajor,2011-03-21T11:41Z,"@ ed.boey and others:
Jesus (peace be upon him) came for only the lost sheep of the house (meaning the children of Israel) but Muhammed (upon whom be the peace of Allah) came for the whole of mankind.

Read Matthew 15:24 in your Bible
""But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.""

In the Quran it says in Surah 34:28 ""We have not sent thee
But as a universal (Messenger)
To men, giving them
Glad tidings, and warning them
(Against sin), but most men
Understand not.""


Last of all, Islam has always given respect and freedom of religion to all faith.
Surah 2:256 says"" Let there be no compulsion
In religion: Truth stands out
Clear from Error: whoever
Rejects Evil and believes
In God hath grasped
The most trustworthy
Hand-hold, that never breaks.
And God heareth
And knoweth all things.""
"
,ed.boey,2011-03-21T13:12Z,"@principlemajor: all I am saying, there is a problem with the moslems' perspective regarding the ""PERFECT RELIGION"", ""PERFECT BOOK"", and ""PERFECT PROPHET"". 

As you have inform, you clearly have read the Bible and the main problem with all moslems is they like to use 1 verse whether it from the bible or quran... and think it already represents the whole book... Just like Ahmed Deedat did.

And you try to convince others with the way you make conclusion... ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD LEARN HOW TO USE THEIR BRAIN FROM THE ATHEIST."
,ed.boey,2011-03-21T14:03Z,"Just because you know 1 x 1 = 1, it doesn't mean you already know the whole math concept. 

All religious people should stop talking like they understand God, you only have time to understand yourself and your fellow human. 

You will be judged by the way you treat others."
,suminoe,2011-03-21T14:28Z,"Frankly, I don't give a hoot about what some schizoid jew said and did 2,000 years ago. Or what some paedophile mass murderer said to justify his criminal behaviour 1,400 years ago.
Both were quite clearly utterly and completely insane."
,ed.boey,2011-03-21T14:56Z,"@suminoe: that's why I like the Atheist more than the religious people.... at least they are the most honest people in the earth...

When they don't know, they say I don't know... When they don't care, they say I don't care...

It's okay if you don't believe Jesus, as long you do good to your fellow man. 

But the problem is probably in the end all atheist will end up being moslems or be killed. Because their prophet and god command them to kill everyone who don't believe in their religion."
,principlemajor,2011-03-21T19:12Z,"@ ed.boey, oh tell me where in the Qur'an it says that people should forcibly convert to Islam?
Give me evidence. It is written in the Qur'an.

Surah 2:256 "" There shall be no compulsion in (acceptance) of the religion, the right course has become clear from the wrong.""

Also all prophets/messengers came with one message saying ""Worship only One God who is the Creator"". All muslims believe in all the prophets and they make no differentiation between them. "
,principlemajor,2011-03-21T19:14Z,"Talking about atheist (a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings), if they don't believe that there is God, ask them, h9ow did they come into existence?

How did their forefathers came into this world?"
,ed.boey,2011-03-21T20:19Z,"@ principlemajor: I think if you asked me to give some evidence regarding the quran, you asked the wrong person ... 

I don't have to read it to know that there is major contradiction between the deeds of the ""peaceful"" moslems and the ""full of anger"" moslems... 

Both of behavior came from the same sources, the quran (the perfect book)... Just like ""the perfect prophet"": he talked about peace, but his actions prove something else... he talked about honoring women, but his actions... you make your own conclusion.

BTW: I never say that being atheist is right, all I am saying is I like them more than all the religious one because they are much smarter and honest. At least I'm not afraid being killed by them, if I say ""all atheist are morons"". :-) "
,principlemajor,2011-03-22T10:37Z,"@ ed.boey and kimm_23f, 
Allah declares in the Holy Qurâ€™an, Surah Fussilat, Verse 53 â€“ 54:
â€œSoon shall We show them Our Signs on the horizons and in their own
beings until it becomes clear to them that it is the Truth. Is it not enough that your
Lord is a witness over everythingâ€


Secondly, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whosoever sees me in a  dream has surely me for Satan cannot impersonate me and whosoever lies against me should prepare for a seat of HELL in this world till the next world.

Thirdly, before Islam, omen had no value and they were been misused in all areas.  Women were buried alive in the pre-islamic period. When Islam came in, it denounced all those and gave women their right. Read the full Qur'an and you would know. 
Talking about those who calls themselves muslims and they do things in their own desire, this people do not follow the tradition of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). 

Now kimm_23f, you telling me to read some science, Islam talks about more about science than any other religious book. Have you forgotten that many Science scholars have even testified to what the Qur'an says. Do you know that the mountains (under it the shape) is in a form of a peg that makes it able to stand still in the earth other than that, wouldn't it shake with us when it shock. Allah says about this in the Qur'an. If you don't believe there is God, wait until the day you die and you would know and I pray Allah guides you to the path of sanity and logic.

Anyway this is not the right forum to argue about religion.
I would really love to have a debate with you on IM if you don't mind, we can do a conference chat on YM."
,ed.boey,2011-03-22T12:09Z,"@ principlemajor: I think you should know that I have no intention of debating you or what-so-ever moslem hero such as Ahmed Deedat...

The only difference between me & kimm_23f and people like you is... we know what we believe because we use our own brain and will not let other to dictate what we have to believe...

The only reason I comment in wasalnaser upload is because your religion claims about what is right and wrong (well, it is the ""only perfect religion"" according to your ""perfect prophet"" and your ""perfect book"")... 

Let your truth be your own truth and let everyone, in this era of information, find their own truth. 

All I know is when I see those ""Full of Anger"" moslems, I know that they will be a big problem in the future. (Imagine millions of people like your ""perfect prophet"", that is disaster for our woman and children).

If you are the type of ""Peaceful"" moslems, well I think you should try to convert those ""Full of Anger"" moslems first before you try to convert anyone who don't wanna know and don't  wanna care about anything that came from your religion."
,ed.boey,2011-03-22T14:04Z,"@Zakimar: well, thank you... It is an honor for me to receive such a nice compliment from someone who are willing not just to ignore, but also to kill 12 millions people from this planet just because his god and prophet permit him to do that kind of thing...

I never like the bankers, financial people, the capitalist and everyone who treat people as their slave for money... but I will never kill them just because they don't see things, the way I see things."
,suminoe,2011-03-22T15:47Z,"Surah 2:256 "" There shall be no compulsion in (acceptance) of the religion, the right course has become clear from the wrong.""

Of course - if there are no infidels, who will pay the jizyah, so all the no-good lazy moslems can goof off?"
