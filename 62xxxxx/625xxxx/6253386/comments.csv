Enjoy, and please help out."

,Hatshepsut,2011-03-21T04:02Z,"Jag kan inte få undertexterna att fungera? Det funkar på datorn med VLC men när jag bränner på DVD så finns inga undertexter när jag ska titta. Vad gör jag för fel?
Den här serien har jag längtat så länge efter så tack tack aajkd i vilket fall!"
