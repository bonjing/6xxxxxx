Synopsis from IMDB:
"The series follows young reporter Bjarne Madsen in Copenhagen in 1949, a time marked by the aftermath of World War II. Madsen is inexperienced, but enthusiastic; when he gets a hunch of a crime syndicate of black market trade he hunts the story head-first, much to the discomfort of his more conservative newspaper colleagues. However, as Madsen uncovers new elements of the story an older colleague catches interest, and together they venture into the dark side of the big city. Meanwhile, Bjarne's brother returns from America with new ideas of jazz and big money, and they are both drawn to the beauty and talents of young diva Gordan."

The English subtitles are just put through google translate, and might be hard to use at this stage. My hope is that they can be improved as a collaborative project on google docs. Both people with knowledge of nordic languages and english are needed. Please leave a comment at the start of the document when you have worked on it.

To use the subtitles, just paste the english text into an empty windows notepad and save as a .srt file with the same name as the episode.
