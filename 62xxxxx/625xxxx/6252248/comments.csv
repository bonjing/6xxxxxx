,optimusprime2,2011-03-18T13:33Z,"@khalifa1942
I think GLOBE only included the English Audio in this . And do a hash check if u think the files are corrupt or not fully downloaded. "
,tayyabaziz,2011-03-18T14:23Z,still not getting sound can you people give sound filelist

,optimusprime2,2011-03-18T16:02Z,"After extraction u should see:

,tuhin619,2011-03-21T14:33Z,Globe is the real Assassin. You Rock man!!!!  \m/
,tuhin619,2011-03-21T14:41Z,"Globe can you let me know the graphics settings of this game in my system??
i have
Core2Duo 4400 @ 2.00GHz
RAM- 2GB
OS- win 7 32bit
Gforce- Nvdia 9400 GT 512mb
and the game is running a bit slow if i increase all to max."
,Bad213Boy,2011-03-22T00:12Z,"You should really put a aposterphy after the ""n"" in Assassins. Searching for this was a pain because you didn't spell it exactly as the game has it.

Also, this didn't work for me. In order for me to get the voices to work, I had to change my audio cards channels. Hopefully some of you can do this. Full sound only works when you use either 2 or 4 channels. I usually use 8, but in this case, it didn't work.

Wonder if anyone can confirm this with a legit copy."
,Bad213Boy,2011-03-22T00:18Z,"*** READ THIS ***

For those of you who can't get voices to work, change the channels used in your audio card from 8 or 6 to 4 or 2. For some reason full sound doesn't work with more than 4 channels. That means you might have to change your audio to Stereo or Quadraphonic under Control Panel Sound configuration."
,tuhin619,2011-03-22T05:47Z,"@Bad213Boy- this one is really a legit one. all u need to do is put the ""sounddata and PB"" folder to the game destination.

I wonder how can a guy rip a huge file in 2 GB or 3!!

Nice work Globe. 10/10"

,ekarth22,2011-03-26T03:17Z,"Optimus brother, you come as a shining angle. Thanks for this upload."
,ekarth22,2011-03-26T03:24Z,^  I meant Angel. Sorry for spell mistake :)
,ekarth22,2011-03-27T05:46Z,"this works and for those who have trouble plz see-

* If using Realtek High Definition Audio, Soundmax HD Audio, or nForce Audio, you
may experience sound anomalies. To work around the problem, reduce the Hardware
acceleration slider to 'Basic' in the Windows Control Panel -> Sounds and Audio
Devices -> Audio tab -> Advanced -> Performance tab.

PS : and if your in the game while you change this settings, you have to restart the game before the problem is fixed (before you whine and ***** on these comment pages)"
