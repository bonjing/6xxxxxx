This c.d. is well worth the extra money you will pay. 
The reason for the high cost with this c.d. has to do with Dave's untimely death and for the fact that this Wayne Metal church release was a special project for David Wayne. 
DAVE was NOT able to use the Metal Church band name, this is why it is called WAYNE METAL CHURCH.For legal reasons pertaining to another band member of the origional METAL CHURCH line up who already had other plans for the name. 
If you are a DAVID WAYNE fAN, THIS C.D.will be a collectors piece for you to own. 


Craig Wells, one of the origional guitar players from the METAL CHURCH era is playing on this set of incredible songs. 
This is the closest that you will be to hearing old METAL CHURCH 
WITH SOME MODERN PRODUCTION AND GUITAR SOUND. 
The lyric and voculs are some of DAVID WAYNES best work ever. 
The guitar work on this c.d. is almost like a time machine, bringing us back to an earlyer time, when METAL CHURCH was a house hold name among metal heads. 
You will not be disapointed with this purchase if you love THE ORIGIONAL METALCHURCH and enjoy DAVID WAYNE'S primal scream. 

There is a Mississippi Queen cover that is better than the original version as amazing as it sounds. The guitar is crunchy, the drums
are heavy and the vocals are amazing. Not for the faint of heart. 

David Wayne fans have been left with another master piece. 
REST IN PEACE DAVE!
