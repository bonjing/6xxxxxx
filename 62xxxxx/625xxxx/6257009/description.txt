Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) must be one of the biggest pricks we've ever encountered in cinema. I can't think of a character who is more selfish, egotistical, and downright mean than ole Charlie Babbitt. Charlie's just been informed by his late father's lawyer that he has been largely cut out of his father's will because of the resentment he harbored towards him. Sure, he received his dad's classic car and his prize-winning rose bushes, but the old man's 3 million dollar estate, he can't touch that
