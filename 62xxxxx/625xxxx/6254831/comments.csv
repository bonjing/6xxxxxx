,MaximilianKohler,2011-03-25T02:44Z,"A/V:10/8 - good enough for a documentary though I guess.

""complete season"" is wrong though, there are 9 episodes so far and not sure the season is even over yet http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1806234/episodes"

This is the COMPLETE season as stated in title and 10/10 A/V. Very nice upload."

Exactly what I was looking for, Complete season, small File (3.9G) and good video quality. 

YOu Rock !
