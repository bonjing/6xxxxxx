well these new drivers are based on previous catalyst 11.4 early preview but are more recent
this is the RC2 of the previous catalyst 11.4 early preview march 7
new openGL version and few bugs have been fixed again as well
orginaly designed for HD 6700/6970 only,we have modified the original inf file to get more supported products thus most models with a new modded inf.
more info :
avalaible only for XP-32 bit !
Desktop products only ! 
Might not work perfectly so.Use at your own risk !
good luck ! 
recommended for advanced users only ! 
(experimental drivers...) for personal use and internal testing purpose...
if you are not ease with drivers,i suggest you to let it down so.
note :
if you have installed previous AMD Catalyst 11.4 Early preview...
Then uninstall them before installing these new ones.highly recommended...
all feedbacks will be welcome.
seed asap ! as long as you can so.
Ty for your unterest
