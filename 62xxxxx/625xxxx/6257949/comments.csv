[T],prathaprabhu,2011-03-21T01:26Z,"Once again i repeat you don't have to encourage me but don't rate my uploads if you don't like it. If you believe that you can get this anywhere please do so. 

BTW - As the title says ""This is Windows 7 Professional and N w/ SP1 Volume Editions"". 

If you don't understand please don't comment at all. 

Thanks"

,saiphurus,2011-03-22T18:16Z,"Hi, could someone seed this torrent?  I'm downloading and I don't see any seeders, contrary to what it says above..."
[T],prathaprabhu,2011-03-22T19:56Z,"Alternatively you can download all my collections from my blog
http://prathaprabhu.blogspot.com
http://prathaprabhuwindows.softarchive.net - As I have already seeded a lot from my 1 Gbps server and now the files are no longer in my server as it is expired"

[V],RR-NE,2011-05-19T05:43Z,seriously why would anyone want to download a 224 GB torrent?? how long did this take to upload into your torrent client?
[T],prathaprabhu,2011-07-01T18:00Z,"I am not asking anyone to download the full 224GB - but they required products.

Cheers "
,tsiugr,2011-09-08T13:52Z,"Could you seed please? 
This is a nice upload, cause we can find everything in one torrent. But you have to seed, because nobody of us downloads all 224 GB!

So, seed please!!!"

,d_vegad,2011-10-14T06:52Z,"Somebody Please Seed, I found this torrent after lot of hurdles....... "
,Zbegry,2012-03-23T14:12Z,"Thanks mate, great work!"
,Kara-kan,2012-05-24T17:22Z,"I suppose that one can make upgrade with this one from Vista, not a clean install only, right?"
,Kara-kan,2012-05-24T17:42Z,"I have another question:
- will this release download the updates from MS?
- are there any problems related to the ""genuine MS product"" issue?"
