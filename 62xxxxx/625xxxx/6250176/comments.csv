,Pwny,2011-06-05T19:28Z,I'm pretty sure season one had more than 2 episodes...
,estally,2011-06-07T18:34Z,"by the way, how to download seed or magnet"
,JimmyC916,2011-06-24T15:58Z,"Great rip. A: 10 V: 10
I have been looking for this all over the place and never found the torrent. Thank you so much for this upload. Great picture and sound. This torrent is a must for all you 1000WTD fans. Thanks again. "
,pouchie45,2011-07-06T09:36Z,"Hi thanks man. Do need three more episodes
Season 1 Episode 11: Escaped Deaths
Season 4 Episode 9: Death By Special Request and
Season 4 Episode 10: That's 'Mister Death' to You.
And not to rain on your parade, you may need to relabel as the season and episode titles are out of sync according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_1000_Ways_to_Die_episodes

Thanks, massive upload!!!!!"
,thecrazyglopss,2011-09-04T05:10Z,"You need to get the seasons and episodes synched badly.

I'm just not gonna download because I'm too OCD.

,CodeX96,2012-05-28T16:38Z,"this is gay, because some episodes are missing and according to some episode guide sites online, season 5 in this torrent belongs to season 4 and so on...:S whats up with that i would rather not download this torrent if it is false i admit its a lot of 1000 ways to die episodes but its not worth having if its not perfectly named etc."
,CodeX96,2012-05-28T21:42Z,this is really actually just seasons 1 - 4 on epguides.com it states that season 2 episodes are all season 1 and season 3 is season 2 and season 4 is season 3 so if u download season 5 episodes off the net using different methods (jdownloader) then season 5 will turn out to be season 4 so there is no season 5 in this torrent
,CodeX96,2012-05-28T21:43Z,"i downloaded season 5 using jdownloader and i found that ""season 5"" has 22 episodes...so maybe half for season 4 and half are the real season 5"
