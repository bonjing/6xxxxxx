Many kinds of male chauvinism, from the traditional village to the brutal hand of state power, and all of them visited upon the mother archetype, who remains the inexhaustible source of love that all characters, at their root, are seeking.

Updated subs by urbanhuntress a must "
,bullseye[0],2011-06-11T17:02Z,What the fuck is the point having the subs in French if the language is in French. Need to have English Subs.  Thanks for the up anyway. 
,lostlunarsoul,2011-09-03T04:35Z,^Because Quebecois French differs from European French.  There is also Arabic in the movie.
