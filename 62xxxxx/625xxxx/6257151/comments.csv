,CaptainJacSparrow,2011-03-20T15:28Z,This has got to be one of the worse games EVER
,zilko,2011-03-20T15:51Z,"Game is fine, when i first started i was this game is total shit. But when i went along with it it came better."
,Remcconen,2011-03-20T17:54Z,"After installing this update and using the new crack, I can't play anymore. I use the automaticly created icon on my desktop. It says: ""The Test Drive Unlimited 2 Server is Not Available""
What am I doing wrong?"
,Remcconen,2011-03-20T18:03Z,I can't play anymore. I think the problem is my profile is an online profile since the update or something. How to change it to offline?
,Laranth,2011-03-21T00:38Z,"TO ANYONE WITH CONTROLLER PROBLEMS. i.e. Steering Wheels setup 

AT THE CONTROL SETUP SCREEN...

Unplug your keyboard - Click Detect Device (It'll still register a keyboard, this is okay) - then setup your controls - Plug the keyboard back in and play.

,mammon78,2011-04-17T04:02Z,It still asks for online activation.  Is there a way around this?  I've added the uploader.exe to the firewall blocklist.  Any fixes?
,extrem3hunt,2011-06-09T14:02Z,I have a problem with the controls even though i changed them from the options menu they still are the same (default).
,extrem3hunt,2011-06-10T10:04Z,"I have a PROBLEM when i launch the game and press play for the offline mode, a fullscreen launches and stays blank then it crashes."
,extrem3hunt,2011-06-10T10:44Z,"{Controls Problem fixed}
It sometimes also shows the loading icon then crashes. I have tried reinstalling it and other cracks but kept on crashing."
,Drkpl8,2011-08-09T02:33Z,"I blocked the uplauncher in my firewall, and copied the crack to the game directory, but it still keeps updating the crack (testdrive2.exe)

what i've tried 2 :

First let update, then block in firewall, and then copy crack --> Same result..

what can / should i do?

obviously all the time skidrow and razor releases are perfect, but i think its the fault of TDU2

please help me, i just got my 911 Carrera wheel and want to test it out with TDU2..."
