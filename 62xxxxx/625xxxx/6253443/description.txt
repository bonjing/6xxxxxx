
Many people claim that Metal Church isn't as good when they have a different vocalist to David Wayne (vocalist on first two albums 'Metal Church' and 'The Dark'). I definitely agree with this, but what I don't agree with is the same people saying that Metal Church suck without David Wayne. 

This isn't true at all. 'Hanging in the balance' is the only Metal Church album I have without David Wayne as the vocalist (I'm English, so I have to order up in HMV or Virgin and wait about 6 months before actually getting the Metal Church album I'm after). 'Hanging in the Balance' and 'Metal Church Live' were in a double-disk package that was actually in the shop so I took advantage of the situation and bought the package. 

So anyway, 'H.I.T.B' offers melodic rhythms from songs like 'Waiting for a Saviour', 'End of the Age' and 'Lovers and Madmen'. 
Songs like 'Conducter', 'Down to the River' and 'Little Boy' pack lots of heaviness and even 80s thrash material. 

If you're a fan of the first two Metal Church albums don't give it a miss just because it has Mike Howe instead of David Wayne. 
Sure, it isn't as good as 'Metal Church' or 'The Dark' but it is a great album.
