   Cyrus and April meet randomly online and they  
   start getting close but they never reveal      
   their true identities. But patience runs out   
   and they finally decide to meet. Somehow April 
   manages to find out his true identity but Cyrus
   fails to do so. April thinks that Cyrus is too 
   good for her and tries to sulk away in the     
   fear of rejection whereas Cyrus looks for her  
   everywhere as she was the only one who could
   understand him as a friend and as a lover.
