,dendiput,2011-03-23T19:44Z,Thanks for this. Excellent collection.
,uchihamadara85,2011-03-31T17:31Z,are these ebooks formatted well? 
,Markstern,2011-04-05T22:32Z,"uchihamadara85: I'm reading The Legends Of Drizzt atm, reasonably well formatted, some spelling errors (mostly words spelled wrong by one or two letters, making it a correctly spelled word but in the wrong place, easily decipherable) though very few substantial errors. Found just one (during 6ĂÂ˝ or so books) place where I actually couldn't decipher the correct meaning, and only for less than a third of a page. In my opinion (with english being my second language, though I consider myself quite well versed in the language) perfectly readable. All in all, a great torrent containing great books, thanks uploader! Oh and since you appear to like much the same books as me uploader I'd like to recommend The Death Gate Cycle by Margaret Weiss & Tracy Hickman, 8 great fantasy books by the same authors that brought the world The Dragonlance series!"
