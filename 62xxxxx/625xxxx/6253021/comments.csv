,silveroakleaf,2011-03-19T03:57Z,"I've been downloading torrents for almost a year and really haven't noticed the +/- until a couple months ago when I started doing my own torrents. Who cares how many minuses there are? It's like email spam and web ads, I just tune them out.

The true measure of a torrent's quality are the number of seeds, well written reviews/comments (both positive and negative), and the overall long term reputation of the up-loader.

I say boycott the +/- system! "

,BadboyJay55,2011-03-26T03:36Z,"Holy shit, 93 minuses!

This torrent either gives you aids or was hit by spammers.

I'm going to download and find out which it is."
