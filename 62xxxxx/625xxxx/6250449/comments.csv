well... if you made an USB drive to install from, the origin of your problem might be the inability to point toward the booting information, either due to a missconfigured bios to firstly try booting from USB device, or an error on your flash drive. check bios first booting device and also don't ""stuck"" with ""win 2 flash software"" try other methods googlin' for it"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-03-19T12:20Z,"if you receive that error only when dealing with 64 bits xp, then use win to flash while being in an 64 bits environment ! meaning you have to install a 64 bits version on your computer anyway... prior to convert an 64 bits version OS to flash drive ;)"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-03-20T13:50Z,"please search on google the Microsoft links to download 

vcredist 2005 service pack 1 +ATL (32BITS)
vcredist 2008 service pack 1 +ATL (32BITS)
vcredist 2010 service pack 1 (32BITS) , YES 
THERE IS SERVICE PACK 1 FOR VCRED 2010 !

TO HAVE BEST COMPATIBILITY WITH 32 BITS WORKING APP"

it's for 32bit ?"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-03-30T21:41Z,"this is exactly what it says... 64 bits xp, with some 64 bits preinstalled support...
BUT any 64 bits platform in order to secure the smooth passing from 32 bits to 64 bits...it keeps compatibility with the older 32 bits applications !
SO, because I forced the installation only of vc_redist 64 bits version... but many applications are still working under 32 bits, you have to install all 3 types of vcredist 32 bits !!! as well, to have support for those applications to have an well working 64 bits operating system able to run 32 bits applications !

that's why I've said to manually download vcredist 32 bits 2005, 2008, 2010 ...and install them !
as an example to fully understand this issue, you must know that the direct x 9 support on 64 bits operating system will detect and install BOTH 64 bits and 32 bits DX libraries... ok ? if a game does no have instructions to work on 64 bits, it will work on 32 bits engine, in spite of the 64 bits operating system ! got it ? when you install 32 bits support or applications on a 64 bits platform it will display something like ""C:\Program Files (x86)\ "" meaning it will install within a separate program files directory apart from the default one... that will  deal with 32 bits app.  hope you understood it this time :)"

,kekalot19,2011-09-06T08:44Z,hey sir. why is disk cleanup missing from the system tools? hmm......  I ran this OS and it is VERY quick and probably the best in speed.  But I ask why did you not put disc cleanup?  I check system 32 and you delete it from there and i check the registry and...hmmm..  is it me or am i just going crazy! please! HELP.  I use disk cleanup a lot because I use a lot of files in the temp directory.  Where do i get disk cleanup? can you make a zip on here of the disk cleanup feature please :(. i rly hope this is not laced. please let me know.  because i dont see why you would lace such a good release. :( please tell me its not laced and please tell me why no disk cleanup :( i am so sad right now. please let me know. 
,kekalot19,2011-09-06T08:51Z,and why do you disable system restore on the .exe..i shouldn't have click!  and why disable the option to turn it back on!!!!!!!!!!!!! O_O'''?   also is that file you include dx10? or dx9 c ?
,kekalot19,2011-09-07T06:34Z,wait sorry.  I didnt know the benefits of deleting cleanmgr.exe/diskcleanup.  I realize that if disk space is low it doesnt propt you any more.  wow.  gosh i feel dumb now lol.
,Malofito,2011-11-14T04:30Z,"Hello, I had just installed it and it was awsome but... I had a slight trouble with it. When I ran my Super AntiSpyware, Eset Smart Security or my defragg tool... it froze and became useless... had to reboot and again froze when trying to use one of these... can you help me I really liked it but I cant afford do have freezig windows on my pc. My PC isnt the problem, Im certain of that its a 3 CORE AMD RANA PROCESSOR AND 8G OF RAM AND AN ANTEC 550W POWER SUPPLY. So then if you know a solution please help me. TY."
