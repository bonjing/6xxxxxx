,Str8UpWHITE64,2011-03-29T04:55Z,I burned it and ran it on my xbox that is pre-kinect update and this game has a system update on it that is required to have to run the game.  WTF dude?  I dont know what just happened.

,meatheadrhino,2011-04-10T18:47Z,"My boy loves this, top upload as always, many many thanks. Don't cheap out on discs, always use Verbatim DL, never, ever have any probs!!!"
,Breks,2011-05-23T16:28Z,"Well, all I have to say is, that for me, this sucks. Burning went a-okay, I put it into my machine and it says play game, with no screen for it, just blank play game, I press A and I get unreadable disc error, telling me about cleaing it. I don't really have a problem with the way I burn games and discs, so I dunno what's the problem"
,hungry110,2011-05-23T17:53Z,"@Breks,

me too buddy.  I patched the wave down to 3 and get the same error.  Never usually have a problem burning and playing.  Am getting the same error with some of my old wave 4 games which I used a boot disk for.

Thinking I may have to flash to a newer firmware."
,Breks,2011-05-23T18:37Z,"Strange is, I patched it down to wave 2, but I also did the same with WWE All Stars, Mortal Kombat and Lego Pirates of the Carribean and all of these worked without a problem. So, what I don't get is why is this game ""special"" in this way?"
,hungry110,2011-05-23T20:04Z,"Yeah, same here.  Mortal Kombat and Lego Pirates works fine, as does Michael Jackson.  Had the same disc read error with Lego Star Wars 3 and just now LA Noire.

Think these must be the new wave.  Will have a look on the forums later."
,Breks,2011-05-24T14:04Z,"I don't think it's a new wave, especially, that Lego Pirates was released later than Lego SW 3. But that's a good idea, I will look around on the net aswell. Maybe someone has a solution"
,datsura,2011-05-26T23:28Z,"I burned this game (along with others that worked just fine to play) but the xbox only recognize it as a dvd-disc, and I cant play the game. Anyone who knows what wrong?"
,Breks,2011-05-27T05:32Z,"Well, for me, it was something else, but I think there are more problems with this game, than it should have"
,Terora,2011-07-07T01:51Z,Works Great! Thx
