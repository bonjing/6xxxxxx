I just started to watch these so if you find any problems 
(glitches/naming/sync) you are welcome to contact me at 
ollietheguy@gmail.com I will fix it ASAP. I double checked 
the episode order/names and checked most files for sync 
issues. I noticed in Vol. 4 most of the intros are slightly 
out of sync. It's very easy to spot when Bugs Bunny eats his 
carrot or the lightning at the end of the intro. That's the 
way it is on the source. Not sure why. However, the "meat" 
of these episodes seem totaly fine. Other then that 
everything else seems to be in order. If i ever re-rip an 
episode i will tag it with .V2-OLLIE.avi and re-upload the 
entire torrent.

OMG! You kept everything in the order of the DVDs!?

I did a little research before i started this project and
there are 3 ways of thinking when it comes to the order.

Option #1: Should we go by the production order as listed 
on the B:TAS site, which leaves gaps in between some 
two-parters? For instance, "Two-Face Pt.1 & 2," which, 
according to some people should be watched as separate 
episodes because there is a several month lapse in time on 
the show from when Harvey becomes Two-Face to when he 
presents himself as a bad guy, and during this time he 
develops a gang and credibility. Also, when going by 
production order, "Christmas with the Joker" is #2, and 
includes Robin, who then disappears in the following 
episodes. Does this mean that the air-date order is 
correct instead?

Option #2: Should we go by the air-date order? Was the 
air-date order the way the creators intended us to watch 
them, or was this just the network presenting them the way 
THEY wanted too. One thing to keep in mind, A LOT of shows, 
live-action and animated are made and produced out of order, 
so could that be the case with B:TAS? Were they just 
produced out of order and aired the way the creators 
intended? Also, there are contradictions on the B:TAS site 
as well. The episode guide, is presented in production order, 
however during the introduction on the first page, it talks 
about how Harley Quinn showed up in episode #7 "Joker's 
Favor", which is true, but only if you're going by the 
air-date order.

Option #3: Should we go by the order on the DVDs? This is 
the same as the production order, with the exception that 
all of the two-parters are together, instead of some of them 
being separated as they are in the production order. An 
example of this would be "The Cat and the Claw Pt.1 & 2" 
which are separated in the production order, with two 
episodes between them, but they are joined back-to-back on 
the DVD order. Same with the "Two-Face Pt.1 & 2" episodes, 
which are spread out in the production order with five 
episodes between the two parts, but also joined back-to-back 
on the DVD order.

Take your pick! I picked option 3.

I also included all 3 of the feature films. As far as i can 
tell the best order to watch everything in is ...

1. Batman: The Animated Series (episodes 1-60) 
2. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 
3. Batman: The Animated Series (episodes 61-85) 
4. Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero 
5. The New Batman Adventures (Vol. 4)
6. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman 

but what the fuck do i know!!!??? :)
------------------------------------------------------------
I ripped and uploaded these for a few friends that wanted me
to. I decided to put them on a public tracker in the off 
chance anyone else wanted them as well. I'm well aware there 
are other torrents of this series. Most of them are IMO not 
done right. If for some reason you don't like how i did it..
Don't fucking download it. I don't really care if you think 
the file size is wrong, you prefer mp3, or different
resolutions. Take it or leave it :)
