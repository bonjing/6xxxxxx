,ozzi191,2011-07-02T11:08Z,"Can some1 plz seed this one? Started to go really slow after 40%, its nothing wrong with my internet speed since tests tell me that i have a full download speed of almost 10MBPS"
,ecOr,2011-07-02T21:33Z,"Great torrent, but where can I get all the english subtitles of the pack? Need them very much.."
,who..,2011-07-30T22:33Z,"Downloading,dude you rock!! :D"
,DamageIncM,2011-08-03T21:25Z,"This is the best one!
The quality is just great, little to no macro-blocking and the audio is dynamic.

Also, it's AVI, so no Matroska MKV crap that's barely supported.

Just too bad it's not the most seeded torrent, so it's quite slow with downloading.

DOWNLOAD AND SEED THE BEST ONE RIGHT HERE! :)"

,jagblade,2011-08-21T16:05Z,"Whenever I go to play the videos (either on DivX or Windows media player) it just sits still. It's not paused or stopped, it's shown as playing. It just sits there on the very first frame however with no sound. Anyone know what the problem is?"
