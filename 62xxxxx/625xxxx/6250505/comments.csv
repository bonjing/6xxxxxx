The instructions are incomplete. 
After installing DVDFab it wants to restart the computer (Yes/No) to complete the installation. I didn't know what to do so flipped a coin and answered No, then clicked on Automatic Cracking 1. Apparently it installed and cracked OK that way, but I haven't tested it yet to actually copy a DVD disc. "
