This program was made with the help of one of Jagex\'s employees, Daniel Hanuczek. He has given us the formula for SMS text messaging interpretation, and we have inserted it into this application. 

We couldnt have done it without you, Danny. Thank you.

Please leave some feedback at our website, located on the application itself.

If you would like to see this working, just watch
