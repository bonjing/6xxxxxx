The story starts in the city of Mumbai where a motorcycle gang starts breaking into banks and other public places and vanishing on the Western Express Highway.
ACP Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) a no-nonsense cop, is called inside the case. He is married to Sweety (Rimi Sen). Jai seeks the help of a thief named Ali (Uday Chopra) and devises a trap to catch the gang, but it fails. Kabir (John Abraham), the leader of the gang, eventually taunts Dixit by saying that he couldn\'t catch him even if he were right in front of him. He is proved correct and the failure of Dixit seemingly leads to the break-up of his partnership with Ali.
