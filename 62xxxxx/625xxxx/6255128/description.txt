My Neighbour Totoro (Twin Audio) it works better when you use VLC media player not the standard Media Player.

VLC provides you with two spoken languages, 1 for the Japanese actors and the English dubbed version if you want to hear the Japanese right click the screen and find audio track and it would come up with 2 choices Japanese or English choose which one you want.

The subtitles are located in the subtitle selection just right click the screen and choose the subtitle action and there you go!!!

Enjoy this torrent!!!!
