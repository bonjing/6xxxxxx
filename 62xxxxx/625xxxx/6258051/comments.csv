,hwaire,2011-03-21T03:44Z,LOL forget you man If you need your console moddded I will do it For $30.00 Any drive Any Model No slims As of yet Contact xboxmodz22@yahoo.com
,Rickanie,2011-03-21T04:47Z,"$30.00 why so cheap man? The 9000 series are  a pain unless you use switches, but they cost like $35. You should charge everybody $100 who cares.
jaj ja ja ja ja"
,Coolkat1969,2011-03-21T13:18Z,"LOL It cost in holland 30 Euro.

I wait till someone can mod the slim line."
,zenman76,2011-03-21T14:28Z,"How about people just learn to do this very easy mod by themselves and save the cash, by downloading this torrent for example. 

Some of these people are charging STUPID amounts... 30 is just about fair but even then its like 20 mins to get an idea of what your doing (at best) and like 5 mins to do it. 

100 bucks for a flash, you gotta be fuckin kiddin me lol.."
