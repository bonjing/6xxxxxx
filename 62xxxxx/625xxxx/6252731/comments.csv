I had to say because i had not heard of this film until browsing the top 100 dls i was not sure if i would like it but after watching it i have to say this has become one of my favorite movies with real endings not that shit where the antagonist always comes out on top"
,chopper-read,2011-03-22T15:59Z,"Best part of this movie is the music.
Very weak story line!!"
,squaky,2011-03-23T19:02Z,Great movie and unexpected ending.
,unuser,2011-03-24T00:40Z,"1. This director is so in love with the music that you can't make out any of the dialog. The music plays too loud over the actors' lines. 

2. Everybody dies. Where's the interest?. Why should I care about any of these dirtbags? 

3. Decent acting. Crap story. "
,niterescue,2011-03-27T20:54Z,downloading now...thanx for the upload!  looks like an interesting movie from the trailer.
,bfpg8989,2011-04-05T01:19Z,"@ unuser  read the book its a lot better
thanks for the up Sam and maybe people need to just invest in a bit of surround sound equipment when watching if they're that fussed about audio discrepancies, music is good and movie was one of Farrels best so........its up to the users ....lol "
,firexninja,2012-03-18T21:15Z,thank you!
