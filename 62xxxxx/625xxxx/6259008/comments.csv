,AAAA_BBBB,2011-04-01T19:16Z,"License files (keys) HBEDV.KEY and HBEDV1.KEY in folder ""Keys"" are not valid - told Avira Premium during installation. When string ""I already have a valid HBEDV.KEY license file"" in the dialog window was clicked => that license file (first, then second) through Browse dialog was selected => then Avira adopted first key file (then second) initially, but after quick internet seeking didn't adopt finally, and had stopped antivirus protection, so umbrella sign in tray icon is closed. And what now? Sorry, but would this download author have placed on TPB any (another) working license files (or keys) or any working keygen or some patch? Please add this files to your current download, if they exist - to launch this Avira Premium. Avira Free is a good antivirus, hence Avira Premium will be yet better.

This Avira Premiun was installed on empty and formatted HDD partition, on clear Windows XP SP3 english (almost absolute single, only system drivers, uTorrent, UltraISO and WinRAR - just after this progs) - ans such trouble.

I'm so sorry for my poor english, my native language is russian."
