,hotcakes717,2011-05-31T12:10Z,Why can't I find the other 7 episodes? Does anybody know where to find them?

The 'series' is apparently eight brief (6 to 8 minute) online episodes -- viewable in their original form from YouTube and the BBC.  (The latter is not available to North American IP addresses, however.) 
The fifty-some minute video here is the eight brief episodes strung together as a 'conventional' broadcast program.
