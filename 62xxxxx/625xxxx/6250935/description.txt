The Tourist 

The Tourist is a 2010 thriller/romance film directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. It is a remake of the 2005 French action film Anthony Zimmer. After a very public slow start, The Tourist went on to gross US$ 258 million worldwide.[2] The film was nominated for three Golden Globes, with a debate arising over the question if it was a comedy or a drama. Donnersmarck repeatedly stated it was neither genre, calling it "a travel romance with thriller elements", but that if he had to choose between the two, he would choose comedy.[3]
