,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-06-26T15:10Z,"Hey I've got a question Mr or Ms uploader.

Are you informed when someone comments on your torrent's thread?

Just askin', 'cause they's a whole hell-load of dead torrents on TPB and I beg the uploader to turn it back on but it never happens.
I doubt these people are in jail or dead, and in fact most times I click their link and see that they've been busy doin' more uploads."
