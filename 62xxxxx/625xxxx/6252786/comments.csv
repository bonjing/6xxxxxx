Has anyone had any success with Kon Boot yet?

I've only tried the USB hack so far and I get to Kon Boot menu and it runs through and then cycles back to the menu, the same problem as many other people so I think I may give the CD boot a go and hope that doesn't have the same issue. If anyone has this same problem search on google for 'irongeekusbkonbootfiles.zip' you may get more success than me with hacking password from USB booting.

Thanks for sharing Anon."
,Cr4sh0v3R1d3,2011-05-17T10:21Z,Worked great for me on 3 different computers so far. I'm using it on a usb sandisk drive formatted as fat32. it runs through just fine reboots and any user account password can be bypassed just by hitting enter on the password prompt screen.

,FailedSuicideAttempt-,2011-09-22T05:11Z,"Don't be a tool box like me and think that the burn wasn't correct or didn't work simply because Windoze can't see any files on the disc.  I burned 6 copies using Nero, Imgburn, on three different computers before I realized that they were all fine and worked, just that the files are not seen or recognized by Windows.  In fact some OS kept trying to act like they could write to the discs, even though they were closed.  Trust the Verify options that it is actually correctly burned or just simply try it out rather than assuming there was a problem.

Oh one more thing, it worked on XP,Vista, and Windows 7 except when there was a dual booted Vista over XP system.  There it would do nothing and I tried all six different copies.  "
