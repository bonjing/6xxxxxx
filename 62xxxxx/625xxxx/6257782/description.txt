Taco.

Okay, so this is one of those guilty pleasure CDs that I'm not ashamed to admit I own.   Not ENTIRELY sure how a one-hit wonder can have a greatest hits CD, but since I really like this CD, and tend to blare it while driving down the road, I won't question too closely. :')

Track List:

1. Puttin' On The Ritz
2. Singin' In The Rain
3. Encore (Sweet Gypsy Rose)
4. In The Mood
5. Chattanooga Choo Choo
6. There May Be Trouble Ahead
7. La Vie En Rose
8. Frenesi
9. Perfidia

Hope you enjoy!  Share the love and be a seed
