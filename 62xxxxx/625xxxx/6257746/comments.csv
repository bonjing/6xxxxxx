Almost a third of the image is cut from both the sides.. Avoid this shit!! Download the DVD iso file instead... You'll get excellent quality and maintain the aspect ratio

[V],twentyforty,2011-10-08T20:06Z,"Read title, moron. It is HDTV. NOTHING is cropped, 'el stupido'... 16/9 is BIGGER than 2.35/1, right? But - you can't get that for sure.

But, even for stupid persons - HOW SOMETHING BIGGER IS CROPPED (MADE SMALLER) TO BE MADE BIGGER? Something is wrong there... ROFL."
