,dea1hwarper,2011-04-02T04:32Z,im having a problem with the game itself. when im playing i am trying to build things or research stuff but every now and then the game figgits and the desktop arrow appears then it goes back to the game. but after this occurs a few times it completely takes me back to the desktop.  can someone please tell me what the problem is?
,saeed.kh,2011-04-06T06:51Z,"hi (dea1 hwarper)...
maybe you are running something in background...close all of them then run the game...

thanks for this perfect torrent...and viva thepiratebay.com"
,hayek23,2011-05-28T22:16Z,BAD copy!!!  Broken game!  Appears to work but the resource buildings don't function properly. The more resource extractors you build the LESS money you get. Also there is no popup over minerals to show remaining $$$. Check the demo out to see the differences. 
,Fenr1r,2011-08-21T08:12Z,"Worked in my PC.
Didn't play it for long though.
Just checked if it works.

Thanks!"
