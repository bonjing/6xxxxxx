I donÂ´t have this in a lossless version, I am looking for this too
covers included
I think this is the same show as the one on Show of Hands video (but here are more tracks) and some songs appeared on the cd too

Canadian rock trio Rush on the "Hold Your Fire" tour recorded live at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, England.
The known title for this recording is Birmingham '88 Remaster Edition and is generally considered as one of their best "non-official" releases.
An absolute must, amazing sound and fantastic performance!
