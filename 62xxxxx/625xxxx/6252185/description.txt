I contacted the owners of this video and they gave me kind permission to use their Email as information about this video.

HELLO,
THANKS FOR GETTING IN TOUCH WITH ME.
YES MY HUSBAND TOM AND I FILMED IT AT THE TRIANGLER FIELD NOV 2001.
THE IMAGES YOU ARE SEEING ARE GOING UP INTO THE TREES, FOR THERE IS A 10FT DROP RIGHT WHERE THE FLAT ROCK IS. WE GOT THE COPYRIGHT LAST YEAR CAUSE A FRIEND SUGGESTED THAT WOULD BE BEST TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS. THE MAURY SHOW CONTACTED ME EARLIER THIS YEAR TO SHOW IT ON THEIR SHOW, SO WE AGREED.
GHOSTSTUDY.COM HAS HAD IT ON THEIR WEBSITE FOR AWHILE NOW. WE SENT THE TAPE TO THEM AND THEY PUT IT ON THERE SITE.
THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HONEST AND YES YOU CAN KEEP IT ON YOUR SITE AND YES AGAIN I READ SOME OF THE STUPID COMMENTS, BUT THEY ARE SMALL MINEDED PEOPLE.
SINCERELY
DELIA & TOM UNDERWOOD
