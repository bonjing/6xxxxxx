As formerly_azrielle noticed before, the hard-coded craziness with the voting system is happening again - now when you vote '+' for this torrent or more recent ones the '- ' count goes up by TWO, and if you vote '-', the '-' vote goes up by THREE (sorry, I had to check)! 

This again suggests at the very least that some twisted, petty individual with access to TPB code is targeting 20-40 - why?? And why are the mods not doing something??? 

The last time we talked about this, the comments got deleted - I wonder if the same will happen again???

,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-20T19:04Z,"LOOKS LIKE THEY DID!  Are there any other (free) torrent sites with tpb's ease of use that you/we could migrate to, with better modding? I haven't had great luck with any."
,Ataractic,2011-03-20T19:05Z,"Just read about the series; sounds interesting. Thanks for this, Sir. Sounds pretty good."
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-20T19:05Z,"Thats Weird.  

How can we come back from that?

Weird Weird Situation Man... 

We need elections now, and need new party to take over the cabinet of TPB."
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-20T19:06Z,Thx for Treme.2010
,silveroakleaf,2011-03-21T03:34Z,"Really...to hell with the +/- ratings...ignore them!  I always do!

As for another torrent site, KickAss is my second home.  None of the BS with reCaptic plus it automatically recognizes your show based on the torrent name.  Oh, and Firefox won't freak out about an ""unsafe reload"" either."
,htctouch,2011-03-21T05:58Z,lovely share
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-21T06:16Z,"thanks, will try this--never heard of series, lived in Louisiana '81-'84 in Army--New Orleans was interesting place--to VISIT!"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-21T07:27Z,Will look at kickass--recommended from another source as well.
,hazel13,2011-03-22T03:19Z,Thank you for this i've been wanting to watch this series...
