The automatic seamless loop engine and the brand new
synchronised sampler will let you perform astounding
remixes live, with no preparation at all. The visual
representation and the cues allow you to clearly see
the song's structure, and never be surprised by a

the beatlock engine your scratches will never end
out of the beat.

Add to that an infinite number of cue points you can

the beginner to the professional DJ, the possibility

Welcome to VirtualDJ 7

This latest version keeps VirtualDJ's famously
extensive feature list still way ahead of the
competition. VirtualDJ 7 brings you all the latest
technology and improvements from the DJing industry,
while staying true to the core values that have made
VirtualDJ so popular: accessibility, versatility and
cutting-edge technology.

* Multi-Deck. Don't limit yourself to a simple two
decks setup. With VirtualDJ 7, you can set
yourself up with 4, 6, or any number of decks up
to 99. Now it's up to you to see how far you can
go. Unleash your creativity. But rest assured that
your software won't be the limit.

* Line-in inputs. Always wished you could run your
analog device input or maybe a live musician
through your software? Now you can by bringing
them all together inside VirtualDJ. With VirtualDJ
7, you can set as many input channels as your
audio hardware supports and route them to any deck
at will. You get full control on the input stream,
including applying effects, visualizing the
beat-waveform, synchronization, beat-matching, and
more. You can also instant-record a portion of the
input stream, and then replay and scratch it as
you want.

* Rewire support. If you like to compose your own
tracks, or want to mix traditional DJing with live
performance, you can now link all your favorite
softwares. VirtualDJ 7 is compatible with any
Rewire application (Ableton Live, ...). A Rewire
application can be assigned to any deck, and you
can apply addition effects, visualize the
beat-waveform, synchronize and beat-match, etc...,
like you would with a normal file. The
play/pause/pitch/etc controls of the deck will
control the Rewire application, so that you can
choose to work either from the VirtualDJ screen or
from the Rewire application.

* GeniusDJ. Be sure to keep your music library
always up-to-date. If you have a Premium
Membership, you can ask GeniusDJ to recommend and
download new songs based on a selection of
existing songs, or based on your mixing habits.
You can also use GenuisDJ to automatically top-up
your folders with the latest songs from the same
genre. No matter how you will choose to use it,
keeping your library on the edge has never been so
easy.

* New Audio Engine. Because the quality of the sound
is of paramount importance to any real DJ,
VirtualDJ 7 makes sure to bring you the best sound
science has to offer. The new Advanced Master
Tempo will give you a sound clearer than ever,
even at extreme pitch changes. While the new Pure
Scratch mode will give you a high-fidelity scratch
emulation, sounding more real than the real thing.

* Database managment. VirtualDJ 7 also features an
improved database managment. Move information from
and to ID3 tags, change or rename multiple files
at once, use several new extended fields, nest
virtual folders, everything is there to help you
easily keep your library organized and clean.

* DJ Controller support. Atomix Productions worked
with all the main DJ manufacturer brands (Pioneer,
Numark, Denon, Vestax, Gemini, Hercules, Stanton,
American Audio, Behringer, Reloop, etc...) to
ensure that most of the DJ controllers on the
market today work plug-and-play with VirtualDJ 7.
VirtualDJ 7 comes with predefined mapping for most
of the DJ Controllers (more than 80 in the default
installer, and more can be downloaded from the
website), but the mappings can be easily changed
and tweaked to your liking.
