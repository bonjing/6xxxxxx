,Early_Riser,2011-03-26T17:59Z,"Download went really fast, lots of seeds. 
Video is very clear except for ghost images during fast action.
Audio quality is also very good but is 0.4 sec out of sync with the video. My VLC player can adjust for that so personally I'm very happy with the quality of the download and will seed for at least 4:1 ratio. Thank you hiest for the hard work and the upload."
