kenta-v.ez. discography
Hardcore, Hardstyle, Gabber, Jumpstyle
2003.10 - 2011.03
LAME MP3 & FLAC (Mixed bitrates)

Summary:
I'm a big fan of kenta-v.ez., and have decided to release a pack of every track he has composed, written, or remixed up to today, March 16th, 2011. To compile the pack, I have obtained over 30 different albums and scoured the web to produce this discography. I hope you get to enjoy the awesome beats and patterns kenta-v.ez. has produced.  If you're not aware of kenta-v.ez.'s style, he often works under the HARDCORE TANO*C label focusing on hardstyle,  gabber, and hardcore -- the tough stuff. Enjoy.

Release Info:
The bitrates in this pack vary from 64kbps MP3s to 1024kbps FLACs. There are two reasons for the quality variance: 1) The common practice of encoding at lower bitrates in the past, some of these tracks are very old; 2) Purposely low-bitrate releases to stop DJs from stealing a setlist. These tracks are encoded in the highest quality you're going to find them on the net, I've gone for lossless whenever available. Sadly, a few tracks have been lossy re-encoded (like hANA wA sAkurA kimi wA utsukushi), but it is the only form they are available in. All tracks for which album art exists, have had it embedded in meta-data stripped JPEGs at resolutions <=800x800. Everything that can be tagged, has been.

There are only five tracks missing from this discography, all from the album "b.e." (2007). I've spent hours trying to find it to no avail, even Perfect Dark didn't have it. Aside from that, I believe the discography is complete.
