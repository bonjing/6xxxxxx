[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-21T13:51Z,Better quality than all previous torrents.
,abet002,2011-03-26T05:18Z,does this have black vertical bars at the side? 
,abhikrit,2011-03-26T08:16Z,nope... obviously... that's why its called PROPER!
,abhikrit,2011-03-26T08:17Z,thanks goodfilms..
,bonemalone,2011-03-27T19:57Z,"I bought the blu-ray+dvd combo pack, already got it before release day, but I want a nice version on my comp too, so I'll grab this.
Me has no blu-ray player in his pc yet, so thanks GoodFilms :)

I LOVE Rapunzel! >_>"
,LiLo1010,2011-03-30T06:04Z,"I bought the 4 pack combo today but, unfortunately, I don't have Blu-ray on my computer, so I can't play the disc. I thought it did. I can play the regular DVD, though, so that's fine, but it doesn't offer the bonus features that the Blu-ray disc does. Is there a torrent yet that also offers the special features offered on the Blu-ray disc? Does this one or is it just the movie? I don't want to download for hours for this one if it doesn't offer the special features."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-30T15:31Z,"This is an encode of the film, not the disc. If you have the disc, watch it on your blu-ray player."
,captfine,2011-03-31T11:37Z,Would my ISP detect me for downloading this? I've downloaded tons of other Disney films but I'm wondering if they would be able to detect Tangled since it's so recent? If you can answer that'd be great! :)
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-31T19:40Z,Stop trying to scare people into not downloading. We know what you're doing.
,captfine,2011-04-01T00:54Z,What? no I'm genuinely concerned. D: I've downloaded multiple great films/shows from you and I recommend you to anyone (namely Torchwood. Yours is the best that I've ever found) but my friend just recently got a letter from his ISP about downloading a Paramount film from another contributor so that's why I'm wondering! 
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-02T15:59Z,"Well this isn't Paramount, you are fine :)"
,Quesse,2011-04-04T21:01Z,"Please excuse my ignorance, but... what are those files with Chinese names? O.o"
,N-Asadi,2011-04-05T13:02Z,"@captfine
it's just stupid"
,justwolfmom,2011-04-07T17:59Z,Thanks so much!  Great quality.
,LiLo1010,2011-04-08T04:09Z,"I don't have a Blu ray player. I can't afford it quite yet. I bought the blu ray disc because I thought I had blu ray on my computer and that I'd eventually get a blu ray player, making buying just the dvd a moot point and a waste of money. Thank you, though, for answering my question. It helped. "

,littlecookie,2011-10-09T20:16Z,"Stop making people scared about this download. Just downloaded, and went all well. Finished downloading in no time, good video quality, same counts for audio quality. I only found a few chinese documents with it (2 pieces). Deleted them since I didn't knew what it was. Everything fine :)
Great upload GoodFilms, thanks! :)"
