[V],Iznogoud9,2012-04-13T10:05Z,"Too lazy to turn the subtitles off, eh? Has it occurred to you that some people actually want them? Not everybody is fluent in English. As for mkv, you didn't tell anything people didn't already know from the torrent description. If *you* don't want a mkv version, use a different torrent."
