,PGHammer,2011-06-06T17:37Z,"Civil Twilight's ""Letters From The Sky"" is one of those songs that gets under your skin - no matter your age.  While ""I Am Number Four"" is thought of primarily as a teen movie, don't you dare believe it.  The movie's soundtrack (moreso the unofficial version) seriously belies that.  I'm about to hit the big five-oh - and ""Letters"" hit me like a sucker-punch to the gut.  Be warned."
