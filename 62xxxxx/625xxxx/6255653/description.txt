Ingenue ripped with CDex instead of EAC due to a scuffed disc so hence no log/cue files. The only studio albums missing from this compilation is "A Truly Western Experience" 1984 and "A Wonderful World" 2002. If you have one of these please do make available!

Ingenue 1992


IngÃ©nue is the second solo album by k.d. lang, released in 1992 (see 1992 in music). It has more of a cabaret flavor than Lang's previous work, and was her most successful album on the pop charts both in her native Canada and internationally.

The salsa-inspired "Miss Chatelaine" was ironic; Chatelaine is a Canadian women's magazine which once chose lang as its "Woman of the Year," and the song's video depicted lang â€” who was usually best known for a fairly androgynous appearance â€” in an exaggeratedly feminine manner, surrounded by bright pastel colours and a profusion of bubbles reminiscent of a performance on the Lawrence Welk show.

The multi-format hit single "Constant Craving" inspired (albeit subconsciously) The Rolling Stones' 1997 single "Anybody Seen My Baby?", from their Bridges to Babylon album, with the result that the Stones gave writing credits on that song to lang and her collaborator Ben Mink.

Hymns of the 49th Parallel 2004
