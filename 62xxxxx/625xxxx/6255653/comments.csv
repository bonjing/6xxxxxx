,RexRexroth,2011-12-08T18:47Z,"Duh!  After much research and a complicated transoceanic mix-up with a video store in Australia, I discovered this concert was never released on DVD (only VHS and laserdisc)!  I wound up paying $50 to have a professional rip done from my VHS copy and now have a great quality DVD of it.

I'd happily upload it here but I am a computer idiot and need to be talked through the steps of how to upload.  Any one want to help?"
