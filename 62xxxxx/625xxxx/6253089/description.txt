Storyline:The film is set in a post-apocalyptic United States, two months after a mutated strain of mad cow disease has turned most humans into zombies. College student "Columbus" (Jesse Eisenberg) is on his way to Columbus, Ohio to see if his parents are still alive. He loses his car in an accident and encounters "Tallahassee" (Woody Harrelson), who is on a quest to find the last Twinkies on Earth. They travel together and when they stop at a grocery store, they meet two sisters, "Wichita" (Emma Stone) and "Little Rock" (Abigail Breslin). The sisters con them into handing over their weapons and steal their vehicle. Later, the two men find another truck loaded with weapons, but when they meet the girls again, the girls attempt once more to steal their truck. Columbus proposes a truce and suggests they travel together.
