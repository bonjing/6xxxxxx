         Texas is appearing in its 13th straight NCAA Tournament       
         and has reached the Sweet 16 five times in the last nine      
         years; Oakland is the automatic qualifier from the Summit     
          League and is 1-2 all-time in NCAA Tournament games.

         The Obaminator interrupted the last 24 seconds of game        
         time with a press conference about Libya. The remaining       
         bit of the game was shown in a split screen so nothing        
         was missed, and nothing that happened in those few seconds    
          had any effect on the outcome of the game.
