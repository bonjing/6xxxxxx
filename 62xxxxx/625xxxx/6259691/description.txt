Rachel Harringtonâ€™s unique talent has deep roots. Being a single parent, having a strong Pentecostal upbringing and thriving in rural Oregon where she fondly recalls her ancestors, this singer-songwriter, who beats to a unique drum, finds ideas everywhere. 

Gospel and Motown and standards by greats like George Jones and Loretta Lynn flooded her subconscious when she started learning guitar at the age of twelve.

In 2007, she produced her own record, 'The Bootleggerâ€™s Daughterâ€™ which shot up to number one on the Euro-Americana Chart and landed on the number 36 spot on the Americana Music Association Chart. â€˜City of Refugeâ€™ followed, as did a three month European tour. 

The last several years have included multiple touring and opportunities to teach songwriting. These are skills which Harrington appears to have available in her back pocket. 

Her recent recording, 'Celilo Falls', contains 13 tracks; all written by Harrington except â€˜House of Cardsâ€™ which she co- wrote with the albumâ€™s producer Evan Brubaker and â€˜Spokaneâ€™ which was written by Art Hanlon. 

The album is filled with Harringtonâ€™s tear-soaked voice; itâ€™s a voice thatâ€™s from another generation, never slick or polished, or sonically airbrushed, it is genuine and undiluted. The themes are mostly wistful and occasionally humorous, but always subtle. 

â€˜Goodbye Amsterdamâ€™ ends with this lovely stanza: â€œTime I get to Glasgow/ Iâ€™ll feel right at home/The rolling of the road settling inâ€¦â€ â€˜He Started Building My Mansion Todayâ€™ is based upon her grandfatherâ€™s thoughts. â€œI feel it in my bones, Iâ€™ll soon be on my wayâ€¦â€ is how the conversation resulted in song. 

Harrington goes on to discover the beauty of place with â€˜Spokaneâ€™ â€œStanding at the riverâ€ and â€œlooking out on an empty groundâ€ Harrington examines the details which colour our everyday locales.

â€˜Pretty Saroâ€™ is a tribute to the â€œAmerican musical lineageâ€ which stems from the Scottish, English and Irish traditions. A plaintive ache appears as she sings, â€œWhen I think of Saro in dawnâ€™s early light/Sheâ€™ll always be crying as she was that poor night.â€

The levity comes through in a song about settling for someone who isnâ€™t â€œMr. Right.â€ â€˜Youâ€™ll Doâ€™ is brilliant in its work-a-day, natural discourse. 

â€˜You Donâ€™t Knowâ€™ is the â€˜Blowing in the Windâ€™ of this generation. â€œWho makes the moon do pirouettes? Who forgives, or just forgets, You donâ€™t knowâ€¦â€ 
This is a simply structured series of verses which gradually build in meaning. 

The romantic â€˜Let Me Sleep in Your Arms Tonightâ€™ is pristine and poetic:
â€œWhere the wildflowers bloom and the mustangs roam, the prairies ocean wideâ€¦â€ 

The final song is â€˜The Last Jubileeâ€™ which is Harringtonâ€™s â€œversion of heaven.â€

The songs are made more powerful with the addition of the following excellent musicians: Fiddle and pedal steel (Dan Salini), mandolin (Ronnie McCoury), slide guitar (Rod Clements) and bass (Jon Hamer).

On 'Celilo Falls', Rachel Harrington does a remarkable job of merging angelic vocals with twangy instrumentals, and infusing intimate family histories with just the right amount of seasoning.
