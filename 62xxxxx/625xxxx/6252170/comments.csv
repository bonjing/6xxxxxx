On the list of things you need to find is a lever but there is no lever on the screen and when I click on hint it shows were it should be but its not there!!! I also started playing as a different person but still the same problem. And again on different hidden object I need to find a head but its not there.

,DreaD151,2012-04-20T17:22Z,listen this is funny but it might work go to the game file on your hard drive and find the folder in ex C:progra~1puppetshowlosttownce.... that has the pic files for the hidden object and try saving as the file ext. for instance lever.EDG or whatever the ext. is  a pic off the internet of something else or copy and paste another one and rename it lever worked for me on return to ravenhearst but it was a ring and it was replaced through out the game lol
