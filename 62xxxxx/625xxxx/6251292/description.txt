"The Blackout in the Blizzard"

A severe blizzard causes a city-wide blackout, 
adding to the obstacles the team must 
overcome in order to solve a murder case that 
could be linked to a potential viral outbreak. 
But when Booth and Brennan find themselves 
trapped in an elevator during the power 
outage, Sweets is on hand for outside 
assistance, but does more than what's asked of 
him when he initiates a touchy conversation 
about Booth and Brennan's relationship. 
Meanwhile, Angela and Hodgins get worrisome 
news about the health of their unborn baby, 
and Hodgins and "squint" Wendell Bray (guest 
star Michael Grant Terry) get creative in the 
lab and put their scientific skills to use to 
identify the victim and the rare disease.

Enjoy :)
