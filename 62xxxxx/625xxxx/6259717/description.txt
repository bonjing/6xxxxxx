  Installation Information:
  =========================
  
  * Burn or Mount.
  * Use our Installer located on DVD1 in the FairLight folder.  When asked if
    you want to apply updates and crack press Yes. If this  step fails or  if
    you want to do it manually by extracting the zip files  in the  FairLight
    folder on DVD2, you will need to extract update_common.zip and one of the
    update_XX.zip depending on what language you choose to install.
    We leave it as an exercise to the user to figure out which one. ;)
  * Launch the game using Shogun2.exe in the directory where you installed it.
  * Buy the game if you enjoy it, saves are compatible with uncracked version.
