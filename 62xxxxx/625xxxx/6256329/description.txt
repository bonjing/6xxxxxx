                The 'divinely decadent' Berlin cabaret scene is in
                full swing when a young and wide-eyed Christopher
                Isherwood arrives in the city to stay with his close
                friend and occasional lover, the poet WH Auden. To
                Isherwood's reserved English sensibility, the city's
                thriving gay subculture is thrilling and
                intoxicating. But Christopher soon finds himself
                heartbroken after the failure of a hopeless love
                affair, and so sets out on a process of
                self-discovery as he forges an identity and place for
                himself amidst the chaos of 1930s Berlin.
