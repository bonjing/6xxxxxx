20kbps, MONO, it sounds like AM radio   :)


I found this one (along with the EP sleeve and the actual record scan) somewhere on the web many years ago. The MP3's are encoded at 20kbps and by today's standards they sound terrible.  However, it's somewhat interesting to see how it all began with this business of ripping LP's EP's and singles into digital formats.
