The only reason I comment in wasalnaser upload is because your religion claims about what is right and wrong (well, it is the ""only perfect religion"" according to your ""perfect prophet"" and your ""perfect book"")...

Let your truth be your own truth and let everyone, in this era of information, find their own truth.

All I know is when I see those ""Full of Anger"" moslems, I know that they will be a big problem in the future. (Imagine millions of people like your ""perfect prophet"", that is disaster for our woman and children).

If you are the type of ""Peaceful"" moslems, well I think you should try to convert those ""Full of Anger"" moslems first before you try to convert anyone who don't wanna know and don't wanna care about anything that came from your religion. "
