Languages: English (Japanese subtitles)

Directed by: Bruno Mattei

Starring: Reb Brown


Basically a shamelessly low budget, near scene-for-scene rip off of Predator starring the almighty Reb Brown and a killer robot that sounds like it's saying 'Greasy!' a lot. It's very amusing, albiet for all the wrong reasons. This version has Japanese subtitles that can't be removed unfortunately but the spoken language is English, so it can still be 'enjoyed' by all.
