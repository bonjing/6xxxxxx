,Lolzard,2011-03-21T13:16Z,"So I got the game and the crack, but I still cant find the key from anywhere. Anyone have any leads on this? And please dont send me those BS download sites that want your money in one way or another."
,XDamage,2011-03-21T15:46Z,"This is all much appreciated. :) 

But I have already downloaded the Shogun.2.2011.PC-R.G.-KZ.TV(bestrepack.net), which I can't install because of Steam. Is there any way to get just the FLT installer, and use it with the version I have already downloaded, or do I have to download the FLT version?"
,naibaf44,2011-03-21T16:56Z,"I have the game and this crack, but I cant find any key/keygen anywhere? Am I being retarded or am I doing something wrong, please help since im really looking forward to this game.

I'm doing this now, haven't tried it out yet."
,maiiney,2011-03-25T03:11Z,"please help, i've been downloadin torrents for a while and most of the time have no trouble at all. i completed the installation, past the menu, but the problem is there is no sound at all. my sound drivers up to date, tried running game in compatibility with sp2. also tried running as administrator. no problems found in dxdiag either. i've never asked for help with these torrents but this one...i can't figure out the problem "
,crimsonlung,2011-03-27T18:18Z,"This is very easy to install, but all the idiots writing these tutorials expect everyone to know what Pheonix is.  Please follow this tutorial:

How to install:

FIRST, Install Phoenix, navigate to this link:

http://stat1cv01d.com/load/0-0-1-9-20

then click ""download"" at the top of the page, download/install it.

1) In Pheonix, go to Instruments->Update Content Description Record->Internet
2) Mount the first disc with (preferably Daemon Tools)
3) Go to Instruments->SID Unpacker
4) Click Scan a SIM File
5) Navigate to the disk you just mounted and click the SIM file (should be only one)
6) There is 2 sections, in the top section, select the game, it should highlight the game components needed, if you speak another language, select that at the bottom. 
7) Click the ""unpack"" button and choose where to install it
8) A white window with some text should pop up, it will have strange characters on it eventually, mount disk 2 in the same slot as the first one.
10. Once done unpacking, Download this crack,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6258022/Total_War_SHOGUN_2_UPDATE_CRACK-FLT_DiBYA and apply it to your extracted folder."

,ZeroSeek,2011-04-07T17:01Z,"Sorry for double posting, but with install the update does he mean , just copy paste it into the install folder ? from the update_en.rar?"

,DerFeniks91,2011-04-24T19:22Z,To what game version does this update take you to?
,sarevok1990,2011-04-29T02:33Z,"im having one of those nights so this'll be a stupid question probably, but what is the cd key for the game? or is there some way around that?
im using daemon tools to mount the MDX files. ive installed the ""crack"" installation but it looks like a copy of the game contents, and when i run the game from that it says it cant find the ""steam_dll"" something. sorry about this"
,bsk1694,2011-05-03T17:08Z,"It's simple actually, 
Install The game (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6257777)
 download this torrent, open the winrar and copy off the files into the directory where you installed the game."
,NameLessSultan,2011-05-10T16:05Z,"hi everyone,it would be great if we have the latest patch,we really need it plzzzz"
,NameLessSultan,2011-05-12T00:40Z,"wowwwwww thanks a lot ninja,i still didn't test it but some say that it's working,and since it's working that means it have a crack with it,so thanks again"
,spinitup,2011-05-25T03:04Z,"Hi. I downloaded this today and followed instructions - unpacked update_en and unpacked that into installation folder overwriting as necessary. Then unpacked the rest, overwriting as necessary, Yes To All.

I assume that's all that's necessary. I ran the game however and the game version is still 1.0.0 Build 3241.0. As far as I can tell, the executable supplied was the same size as the last one.

Have I done something wrong? It appears nothing has changed."
,Bad213Boy,2011-05-27T05:52Z,"Someone still needs to fix the movie .pack files. Even the Add-on Torrent one is wrong. I had to used Pack File Manager to open the movies2.pack file and half of the intro and ending videos were all wrong.

I had to install RADTools and FMV-Extractor. You can't just play the .bik files using RADTools. I needed something to analyze the info first and unlock the file in order for RADTools to play the videos. This is where FMV-Extractor came in. I was able to analyze each .bik file and then play them within FMV-Extractor, but it still needed RADTools installed to play the videos.

There are quite a few ending videos missing. The Mori, Oda, Takeda, and Uesugi are all missing. "
,spinitup,2011-05-29T05:28Z,"@Everyone. As of yesterday (May 28th 2011) I experienced a critical problem with Shogun 2 - once I started the game it hanged at the Sega/Shogun 2 screen and failed to proceed further. The cursor remained the same as the Windows cursor and I left it for 25 minutes and still nothing happened. I tried multiple times to load the game but came up with the same problem. I had to Task Manager that shit to turn it off.

This coincided with installing the latest updates - The Chinese patch + Crack 1 & 2. So I looked on Steam and it was on sale with 33% off. I like this game so much and it was a bargain so I bought it, hoping this problem would go away. It didn't. I deleted all the pirate shit and downloaded the legit copy. I also bought the new DLC (worth it IMO).

Apparently Creative Assembly are working into the night on a fix because that patch fucked everything up and there's a shitstorm going off about it. If you are in this situation, don't worry it's not your drivers or what's in the registry from that (what you might think is dodgy) Chinese shit. Those guys did good, it's the actual developers that fucked up.

BTW my pirate copy of Shogun worked perfectly before the patch update, but I wanted Anti Aliasing and to fix some of the retarded things troops were doing on the battlefield. My advice if you haven't updated is to hold off a couple of weeks and stick with the Fairlight release.

I personally tried the DiBYA update and it changed nothing. Maybe I was doing it wrong - I followed instructions and no version change occurred."
,spinitup,2011-05-29T05:32Z,"BTW if you are experiencing that patch problem where the game hangs indefinitely at the opening credits (shogun 2 box containing credits surrounded by black + no icon change), Sega's support team have recommended deleting the file contained in C:\Users\insert your username\app data (hidden folder\The Creative Assembly\scripts."
,muckguppy,2011-06-16T13:13Z,"yeah man THANKS for the advice @spinitup .. I will just force my AA in control panel and relax with my fairlight release.

Cheers bro!"
,stefanelul1,2011-08-22T18:53Z,where do i get the dlc's from ?
,cerin616,2011-10-08T04:09Z,"So let me get this straight, are people reccomending using the fairlight (for people who dont know, its the FLT torrent available) version? is there something wrong with DiBYA?"
,Lockey007,2011-10-11T21:13Z,"Ahhh this installation is so fucked up for me, i played game when it was realeased for couple of days, and than i could't open it. Same with this release.
I appreciate the hard work, but try making this installations little easer for us mortal humans..."
,azibet,2011-10-24T23:52Z,"Dear PrirateBay, please sort out the shitty torrents that don't work. Missing mss32, how'd you expect me to run the game without it?"
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-26T22:14Z,"***UPDATE ONCE AGAIN***

This download is old and is missing tons of stuff, including the movies. If you want the complete version with all movies and DLC's do a search for:

Total War Shogun 2 v.1.10 + 3DLC RePack by R.G.Mechanics

R.G.Mechanics is Build 4247, so I don't think you'll need to download ""Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack"" patch. Either way, you'll still need ""patch10.pack Build 4358"" & ""3DMGAME-Shogun2.v1.1.0.Build.4358.0.Crack.Fix2.Patch-3DM"".

Do another search for:
 [FSrv] Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack

Anyone who's played Build 4247 knows how fucked up the game is. The latest patch, Build 4358, and crack are on the thread 35:

Page 35:
 patch10.pack build 4358
 &
 3DMGAME-Shogun2.v1.1.0.Build.4358.0.Crack.Fix2.Patch-3DM "
