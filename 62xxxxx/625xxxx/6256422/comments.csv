[T],deffjam555,2011-03-20T04:41Z,It has dual audio so play it in VLC video player and then go to audio settings and switch to ENGLISH or hindi and the audio will play in ENGLISH only through the movie. i will be uploading more such types in small sizes

,chedderz66,2011-03-20T05:04Z,"cam with duel audio one of which is english. dont waste your bandwith. Seriously, dont."
,ThePsydome,2011-03-20T05:10Z,"I have downloaded the full file and had a flick through it. I agree with vernernet;

A=5
V=7

I have downloaded every cam version thus far and this is the best, but still has some problems with over brilliance. It looks like a filtered version of the previous cam and is more defined. My main gripe with it is that it is in mkv format so I cant watch on my xbox 360. But definitely download it if you were unhappy with the previous cam. Btw any titles are in Russian i think. The default language is Hindi, but there is an alternate English channel."
,heavydiamond,2011-03-20T05:11Z,"loads of sick lads watching this though 

netcrawled
all the ap2p shit heads
roadrunner

these fuckers r out 4 this one /just letting u know
by the way the print isnt the best very dark at times but overall as cam standards v8 bit blurry due to file size a9 duel language works

thanks "

,vernernet,2011-03-20T13:26Z,"heavydiamond >
I've only ever seen PPV for pay-per-view
Still not sure of PDVD"
[T],deffjam555,2011-03-20T14:19Z,"Asian Silvers / PDVD: 
These are films put out by eastern bootleggers, and these are usually bought by some groups to put out as their own. Silvers are very cheap and easily available in a lot of countries, and its easy to put out a release, which is why there are so many in the scene at the moment, mainly from smaller groups who don't last more than a few releases. PDVDs are the same thing pressed onto a DVD. They have removable subtitles, and the quality is usually better than the silvers. These are ripped like a normal DVD, but usually released as VCD. "
,vernernet,2011-03-20T14:56Z,Thanks for the explination>deffjam

,dungab,2011-03-30T02:24Z,is there a fucking good copy?
,honunet,2011-04-02T16:09Z,"PDVD does not mean pay per view noob, it means pre-dvd rip.  In other words a shitty cam job burned onto a dvd and sold, usually in the phillipines or Malaysia, then ripped and uploaded on here.  there is NO reason on earth anybody should be downloading this shit with R5's out right now.  R5 is basically a screener and is near dvd quality"
,JeremyWP-442,2011-04-03T02:53Z,"@ chedderz66

Seriously, what is your problem?

This guy has gone to all the trouble of re - encoding this video to 500MB, yet it still is of similar quality to the larger 1.4gb versions. It has Dual Audio which can come in handy for some and all you do is complain, complain, complain.

It's free. Stop being a spoilt little brat.

^LIKE if you agree with me."
