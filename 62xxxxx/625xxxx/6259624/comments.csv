,crapre,2011-03-24T01:15Z,"Dear Mr. Kick-Ass,

Your releases are *amazing*, but this is the first-time I find one lacking subtitles.

That's a huge disappointment, for what makes your releases the best out there, apart from the fact that they provite the best quality/size ratio out there, is that they *always* include subtitles.

I'd like to suggest a few improvements, however:
- when providing english subtitles, provide the english subtitles for hearing impaired (like me) whenever possible ;
- when a bluray disk has more subtitles, include those as well (why just english & spanish) ;
- include a NFO file in your releases ;
- switch to the MKV containter at some point, for it is so practical ;

This being said, thanks again for all the fish! :)"
