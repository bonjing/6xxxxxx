Since Konami's smash hit game Metal Gear, the MGS franchise has grown in strength and numbers and no-one could predict how massive, popular and downright epic it would be.

With every game there was always an amazing soundtrack so I bring to you all the OST's from the MG franchise barring a couple of the PSP game soundtracks.

In this 724MB 7zip file contains a XXL 8 OST's and they are as followed:

Metal Gear
Metal Gear 2:Solid Snake
Metal Gear 2:Solid Snake Music Collection
Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Red Alert
Metal Gear Solid
Metal Gear Solid 2
Metal Gear Solid 3
Metal Gear Solid 4

Please bear in mind, the reason I 7zipped this is because there is 8 OST's so you will need 7zip to extract the files.

Please seed, leech, comment and enjoy=]
