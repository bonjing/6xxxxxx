[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-05-26T21:54Z,"@ovi68:

What a shame for your comment!!! Pixels are ""everywhere"" in a video file !!! If you want to count them :   1280 x 544 [width x height] About quality ...hmmmm.....well ... let's see... the torrent has a considerable number of seeders and leechers and  only a single comment against a reasonable/more than reasonable quality !!!  

See comments about the other uploads of mine [with CODY' s Rips !!!]

Once.Upon.a.Time.in.the.West.1968.720p.HDTV.X264-HDxT

It's obviously that at the time of this release the Blu-Ray was not out !!! I DO NOT PRETEND ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT THIS IS A HDTVrip. The watermark is there: HDNet Movies at 01:08:34 !!!
