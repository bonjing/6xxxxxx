- "Serious Danger of a Full Core Meltdown": Update on Japan's Nuclear Catastrophe

Fears of a full-scale nuclear reactor meltdown are increasing as Japanese authorities use military helicopters to dump water on the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station. The water appears to have missed its target and failed to cool the plant's reactors and spent fuel rods. "The walls of defense are falling with the melting of the cores, the collapsing-we expect the collapsing of the vessel. And with these damaged containments, these are all open windows to the atmosphere," says Paul Gunter of Beyond Nuclear. Some experts say U.S. reactors are safer than those in Japan. But investigative journalist, Karl Grossman, notes a 1985 report by the National Regulatory Commission acknowledged a 50 percent chance of a severe core accident among the more than 100 nuclear power plants in the United States over a 20-year period.
