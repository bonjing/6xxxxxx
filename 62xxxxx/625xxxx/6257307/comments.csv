Game starts fine with StokedlauncherPC.exe , no probs ,but it seems key configuration is missing something for i couldnÂ´t exit the game by any means , needed to manually reboot , but iÂ´m yet to give it another shot...
One thing i am sure of , and iÂ´m no noob downloading games at TPB , probably got over 300 so far , that is extremezone is one of the best uploaders when it comes to game sharing ,always two thumbs up releases,(those skulls dont come easy)!!

Many thanks to those who we worship:

Reloaded
Skidrow
Razor1911
Skullptura
Vitality
NoGrp
FLT
Vace

...among others...

keep up the good work...iÂ´m waiting anxiously for MW3 and BF3..."
