I went through the list that can be downloaded from B&N (there are more than 4400 books of them!) I went through the lists and I reached number 1600.
Since I am mostly interested in philosophy and logic, I found a few books in that category.
Here are the URLs of these books. I would really appreciate it if you can download them. Needless to say, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you whether or not to honor this request, and at your convenience. Whatever you do or not do, I am greatly thankful to you, even for the offer alone.
With kind regards.

Here are the books:

,terrentius1,2011-03-19T12:00Z,"Philosophe123,

You are better off doing a search on PB instead of requesting those texts.  The ones you interested are quite generic in nature and are plentiful on the PB website.  There will be nothing new in them.  They are nothing more than texts that have been repackaged since 1940s.  You are better off requesting from loki6612 a text that has not been uploaded, content wise, thus adding the virtual collection."

,loki6612,2011-03-19T21:12Z,"@Philosophe123 if what Terrentius1 said is true please reconsider your choices and pick other books, also please try to limit your choices to 5 as stated in the original info for this book."
