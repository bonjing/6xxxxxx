,alphinha,2011-03-21T13:45Z,"hahaha! you do not get lucky friend, believe me! I have tried and failed!
My computer:
Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 2.50GHz CPU @ Overclock: 3.30 Ghz
RAM: 6 GB
Hard drive: 1 TB
is not perfect, but it's enough to play the news.
and not holding any game, I overclock the graphics card!
Bye, Have a good day."
,Assassin2009,2011-12-03T11:35Z,"I think, it will WORK ON WINDOWS 7 IF, you set up (in ""properties"" => ""Compatibility"") The compatibility mode to ""Windows XP"". Just try. I'm not shure, but it should, I'm on XP, and to MORE older games, I'm setting up compatibility to ""windows 95""...."
