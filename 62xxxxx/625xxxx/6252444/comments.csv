,Rubbebubbe,2011-03-19T13:03Z,"Tack som tusan.
Jag har en äldre flash (LT 1.6 ?) i min box så jag använder fortfarande en så kallad ""activation disc"" för att kunna spela. De senaste spelen (Dragon Age 2, Bulletstorm och Crysis 2) vill uppdatera boxen och jag har inte vågat göra det eftersom jag inte vet om det kommer att fungera. Vet heller inte om mina äldre spel kommer att fungera efter uppdateringen. Någon som vet mer om mitt ""problem"" så vore jag jättetacksam för svar."

,roll555,2011-03-19T19:49Z,"If there ever was a game that defined the word epic in gaming, well it is crysis 2. It surpasses all your expectations and by such an enormous amount that you actually end up thinking - "" Is it real?"". One day you are playing a game like homefront, which has setup a precedent in the market for lack of innovation and pathetic graphics, and then suddenly you start playing Crysis 2. Well, its like a breath of fresh air and its so damn pleasing to the eyes. Well hats off to people at crytek for creating cryengine3... Wish there were more games like Crysis... God bless you Crytek.. Wish I had a pc powerful enough to run Crysis2 :) Still, loving it on Xbox also... :)"

,Aerionix,2011-03-28T11:53Z,"So I have DA2, Homefront, Bulletstorm, this, and WWE All Stars, and I am sick to death of not being able to run them because of shivering with fear of the idea of a dashboard update, when I have no idea what version of flash, mod, or tag that's in this system.  

Endless stories of how black ops, nfs, fable 3 and more no longer work after the update, just didn't want to take the chance.

So as I stared at this game in its snug little case flashing sarcastically at me, I got up, stormed over to the machine, and may have performed the very first Rage Update in history.  And every single game works.  Ironically decided after to stick with the pc version of this now that multiplayer seems to be working for the moment.  But I'm all smiles and loving the world right now.

Thanks as always for a great upload AiTB. "

You have to hack your 360's drive to read these games. OR if your luck, you can jtag your 360.

See http://www.apiratesbook.com for more details.

APB will show you how to hack your 360.

Burned with Xbox back up creator 2.9 (build 0306) using Imgburn as the burner. = make sure you run it at write speed x2 and not ""maximum speed"" to reduce disk of having a coaster and faulty loading disc!

Also as long as you are using Xcelent quality dual layer discs like Verbatim, you will have almost 100% success rate.
