The Dragon Pearl 2011 DvDScr XVID Hive-CM8


Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time

Source: 700mb Screener avi

Video: 720x352 @bitrate 1200 2pass
Audio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo
Sample: yes included

Encode: Source was not the greatest,looks more like a TS to me but since the
source file is called dvdscr i will let it like that.
The video was dark,milky and colourless and has chinese subs which i had to cut off.
the subs were only in one vertical line but nearly filled the complete screen so blurring
would look worse than cropping them off.
tried to brighten it up and give it more life. audio was english stereo still the same.
on faster scenes is a bit pixelation which already were on source due to low bitrate.
can do nothing about until better source is available.
since than its a watchable copy for such an early release.
