,ekarth22,2011-03-18T05:20Z,"Mr.Loki, I need some books from that barnesandnoble site you mentioned.

Kaplan GMAT Math Workbook 

http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Kaplan-GMAT-Math-Workbook/Kaplan/e/9781419552168/?itm=1

I've been scammed atleast 3 times while downloading this ebook. The other releases of this ebook on torrent and warez sites contain only few pages and remaining 200+ pages are blank! So kindly put a proper ebook of this.

And this handwriting improvement ebook

,philosophe123,2011-03-18T09:28Z,"Good lord! You are awesome. 
I went through the list that can be downloaded from B&N (there are more than 4400 books of them!) I went through the lists and I reached number 1600.
Since I am mostly interested in philosophy and logic, I found a few books in that category.
Here are the URLs of these books. I would really appreciate it if you can download them. Needless to say, itâ€™s up to you whether or not to honor this request, and at your convenience. Whatever you do or not do, I am greatly thankful to you, even for the offer alone.
With kind regards.

Here are the books:
