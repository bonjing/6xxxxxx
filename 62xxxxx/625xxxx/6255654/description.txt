                 The Unborn (1991)
                 -----------------
A solid and very underrated horror film starring Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga and James Karen.

I have seen this film many times in the mid-nineties. I saw in again just recently.
Now you have the opportunity to see it! I guarantee you will be glued to your seat till the very end of this film!

Plot: A couple who cannot have children joins an in-vitro fertilization program. While she is with child, she finds strange occurrences happening within her body. The horror surrounding the child comes to light when the parents find that their child has been part of a mad experiment.
