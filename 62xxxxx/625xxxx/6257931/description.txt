Both Doctor Who 2011 Comic Relief specials joined together as a single anamorphic MKV.
Converted from this torrent which consisted of 2 mpeg files:

Video: MKV 720 x 576 (Aspect 43:24)
Audio: 2ch 192kb/s AC3

Definitely better quality than the torrent consisting of two wmv files.
A somewhat sharper picture than the TvTeam AVI version.

Slightly better quality than my own AVI encode which can be found here:
