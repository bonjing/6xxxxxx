might - "Farmer J" @ 320k on mp3


From the LP Pine 2010
Their first single - released to indie radio stations across the country (and a few select over seas)


There's some chilling old-analog instruments hidden in the background of this song

Awesome bass groove with the drums
and really atmospheric guitars
