Comments :
In Minangkabau, West Sumatera, Yuda a skilled practitioner of Silat Harimau 
is in the final preparations to begin his "Merantau" a century's old rites-
of-passage to be carried out by the community's young men that will see him 
leave the comforts of his idyllic farming village and make a name for himself 
in the bustling city of Jakarta. After a series of setbacks leave Yuda homeless 
and uncertain about his new future, a chance encounter results in him defending 
the orphaned Astri from becoming the latest victim of a European human 
trafficking ring led by the wildly psychotic, Ratger and his right-hand man Lars. 
With Ratger injured in the mÃªlÃ©e and seeking both his "merchandise" and bloody 
retribution, Yuda's introduction to this bustling city is a baptism of fire as 
he is forced to go on the run with Astri and her younger brother Adit as all 
the pimps and gangsters that inhabit the night hound the streets chasing their 
every step...
