The film tells the story of 3 brothers who made the difference in Brazilian history. They were hemophiliacs and got AIDS through blood transfusion. Their lives were dedicated to the fight against dictatorship and AIDS and for freedom and human rights in Brasil. Nowadays they are a symbol of dignity and hope of better days.
