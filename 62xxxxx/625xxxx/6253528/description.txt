While exploring an uncharted island, crooked businessman Clark Nelson (Jerry Ito)
abducts a pair of mysterious pint-size natives. But unbeknownst to Nelson, the tiny
natives send out telepathic distress calls to Mothra -- the giant moth they worship
back home. Before long, the gigantic winged beast descends upon Tokyo on a rescue
mission, leaving destruction and chaos in its wake.
