Hey all, I have just started this new Music Blog at Did.YouHearTheNew.com. I did not start this site for any other reason besides to put up new music for my friends to listen to, since I always keep going "Hey, did you hear the new blah blah...

So, this site and now this mix-tape is one other way I have to put some music out. Hopefully others can enjoy it as well. 

This music is a lot more Indie stuff, with Electro-Pop, Dance, Rap, Folk all in one mix-tape. Some of my favorite Rappers released albums recently, which is added, but I separated them in case you absolutely hate rap/can "unselect" them easier.

In addition this month, I added a folder of "B-Sides" or "Extras" that I did not deem worthy to be on the A-Side, but it would behoove me to not add them.

Enjoy!!
