Time Team is a popular archaeology documentary series produced and broadcast in the UK on Channel 4.

This pack contains all(?) Time Team material upto Series 17 (2010), including publications, specials, live broadcasts, and the various spin-off series (but exclude a number of short DVD-only extras and the pilots).

The files in this torrent have been collated from many different torrent sources, and represent the best versions that I could find, but HD files have been avoided where possible to keep the overall torrent size manageable.  A typical episode lasts ~48 minutes, in either 350Mb  or 700Mb filesize (VHS/TV/DVD mixed quality).  

This was originally collated as a megapack for a private tracker. I can take no credit for the capping or encoding any of this material: for more information about the source torrents, credits and reasoning behind particular version choices, see the included text file.

There is probably a significant overlap between the data in this torrent, and the recently posted (but less comprehensive and currently very slow to seed) torrent at https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6206367.  Feel free to selectively use this one to get data faster and help complete the other!  (though you'll need to rename individual files to make them match).
