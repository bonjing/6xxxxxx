Total War Shogun 2 READNFO-FLT

Game information:

In 2000, the Creative Assembly re-invented the strategy genre with Shogun:
Total War, an unprecedented blend of 3D real-time battles and turn-based
management game and the first offering in the multi-award winning series
With over 7 million units sold and universal acclaim from the press and
community, Total War has consistently been at the cutting edge of the genre
and is today one of the most successful PC franchises of all time

In 2011, the makers of Rome and Empire: Total War will release the sequel
to the game that started it all. Shogun 2: Total War will take long-time
veterans and newcomers alike to the next level of strategy gaming on PC
Based on 10 years of experience in making Total War, Shogun 2 is the
perfection of the series with a new Artificial Intelligence (AI)
revolutionary multiplayer modes, brand new campaign map options and epic 3D
real-time battles

It is the middle of the 16th century in Medieval Japan. The country, once
ruled by a unified government, is now split into many warring clans. The
player takes on the role of one Daimyo - the clan leader - and will use
military engagements, economics and diplomacy to achieve the ultimate goal:
re-unite Japan under his supreme command and become the new Shogun - the
undisputed ruler of Japan
