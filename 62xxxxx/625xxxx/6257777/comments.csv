,InsoGr,2011-03-20T17:00Z,could you upload just the crack? ^_^
[T],extremezone,2011-03-20T17:07Z,other p2p savings will not work with fairlight crack/patch so you need to download all iso files to get this working properly
[V],Mbb15,2011-03-20T17:09Z,"@Extremezone, you forgot half of their nfo, its not really nice to delete that because it is their 1000st release!

proper NFO:

 Special Announcement:
  =====================
  Release #1000!

  Two boys sit on a train, in rural areas of a  low  density  populated  part
  of the world. There and then they form a  pact  that  will  forever  change
  the course of the computer industry, marking a shift  in  culture  that  is
  soon to reach far and beyond their own  expectations, and  the  horizon  of 
  their own vision. There and then, the group FairLight was born.

  April 1987 was the year when  the  infant  was  conceived.  The  infant  is 
  now a grown man at the age  of  23  who  made  significant  impressions  on 
  Commodore 64, Amiga, Super Nintendo and the PC scenes,  both  for  demo and
  cracks. Today we celebrate a historic day, a  day  few  people  would  even
  envisage could  ever  come  -  FairLight  celebrates  it's 1000th  release! 
  Well, this is  naturally  not  entirely  correct,  it's  release  #1000  on 
  PC ISO  which  followed  hundreds  of  on  C64,  Amiga,  SNES  and  earlier
  PC floppy scene appearing in parallel, or the dozens of mind boggling demos 
  ever seen on most consumer hardware. So, rejoice and celebrate today as you 
  are one of those who can  taste  yet  another  fruit,  resulting  from  our
  blood, sweat and skills. Hours, days, weeks  and  months  have  been  spent
  - both screen time and in some cases also prison time, for you to enjoy our
  work. Rejoice and celebrate with us, the efforts earning your  respect.  We
  are still here; we are  still  the  sentinels  of  a  world  free  of  copy 
  protections. We are still here as we were built stronger  to  last  longer. 

  We are FairLight, standing up for quality, tradition and pride!

  The FairLight council stands with eyes wet  in  admiration  from  the  work  
  of the PC ISO section. ""Boys, you have all done well. You bow to no one!""   

  We are proud to be the first gameISO group reaching #1000 gameISO releases.
  FairLight started the gameISO  division in  late  1998 and  is still going.

  For your pleasure, check the FairLight dir for all the #1000 nfo's, and the
  releases.txt for all the game releases both in the included zip-file.  

  Special thanks to our lost/retired members that made this possible!

  In April 2012 we will celebrate our 25th anniversary. Stay tuned! :)"

I can't believe how stupid you are."
,murbarak,2011-03-23T19:01Z,"Ok, so this is apparently the way to activate AA in TWS2 At the moment.

Turn on Anti Aliasing

For ATI cards

Go to â€œstartâ€ menu and search CCC (Windows 7 users only) then you can find gaming tab, and what you need to do now is to click 3D application settings, next in the AA option uncheck use in game settings and put it to what ever you want. Thats how you do it.



For Nvidia cards

Right click the desktop, click the nvidea control panel, in 3d settings, click on manage 3d settings. Then click on program settings tab, then find shogun 2 total war. After that you will see a list of options underneath it, first click â€˜anti aliasing â€“ modeâ€™, set it to â€˜enhance the application settingâ€™, then go to the â€˜anti aliasing settingâ€™ and set it to whatever you want, e.g 2x, 4x etc.

,sazura,2011-03-25T06:07Z," Alright, here's the problem I'm running into. Installed fine, loads fine. Everything is peachy until I actually get to the campaign map. The problem is that there are no roads/trails, no water, and no territory lines. 

  Picture the game, except the water is invisible and all of the territory lines are missing. Also, whenever I select a unit on the Campaign 
screen, it doesn't tell me how far it can move and how much movement is left. 

 All of this combined makes the game pretty hard to play. Anyone else having this problem?"

I extracted the update_common.zip and the English zip, and now I don't have a Shogoun2.exe in the directory I installed it in. Where specifically do I have to extract these files too? I have a feeling that the update files did something to the .exe file, because I had it in the directory before I extracted the .zips. "

Friend, 01 Jooce already answered your question. I had the same problem as you and it worked for me:

Jooce01

IF YOUR INSTALLATION ISNT WORKING THEN TRY THIS, IT WORKED FOR ME! BUT YOU MUST DO IT IN THIS ORDER!

1/ mount disc 1 and open the installer in the fairlight folder
2/ when it asks for disc 2 you MUST leave disc 1 mounted and click ""next"" on the installer
3/ the installer should say ""cannot find .sid file do you want to search manually?"" or something similiar
4/ with disc 1 still mounted click ""YES""
5/ UNMOUNT disc 1 and MOUNT disc 2
6/ Click on the .sid file in DISC 2 

This method is the only way i got it past %98 but you have to do it in that order..

Turn on Anti Aliasing

For ATI cards

Go to Ã¢â‚¬Å“startÃ¢â‚¬Â menu and search CCC (Windows 7 users only) then you can find gaming tab, and what you need to do now is to click 3D application settings, next in the AA option uncheck use in game settings and put it to what ever you want. Thats how you do it.



For Nvidia cards

Right click the desktop, click the nvidea control panel, in 3d settings, click on manage 3d settings. Then click on program settings tab, then find shogun 2 total war. After that you will see a list of options underneath it, first click Ã¢â‚¬Ëœanti aliasing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ modeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, set it to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœenhance the application settingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, then go to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœanti aliasing settingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and set it to whatever you want, e.g 2x, 4x etc.

PLEASE REPLY, EXTREMEZONE.

Thank you very much for all of your uploads! They are always top notch, games or movies.

However, I have a question about this game! I don't know if you do or do not play this game currently, but do you think that the patches for this game will be released soon? I hear of Build 3272 or that other one. But those are v 1.0. According to steam news, the game has been updated to 1.1. Any possible sources for the newest patch would be highly appreciated! :)"
,jan765,2011-04-10T08:00Z,":::::IF YOU CANNOT INSTALL THE GAME, DO THIS::::::

1. Read the .nfo file! Tells you everything you know.
2. Don't run/double click/run setup. Use the fairlight installer.
3. THIS TORRENT DOES ""NOT"" REQUIRE -STEAM-"

When you mount the flt-sh2a directly from the torrent (without moving files to the desktop, etc.) you go to Computer or My Computer and search for the disc.

There you will use either Explore/Open Folder to View Files, or any option you have depending on your system.

Then from there you go to the Fairlight Folder and click the installer.exe

,GamingGuy151,2011-05-17T16:13Z,"It's funny how the people that have the same error like I had and manage fix it, only say ""nvm I fixed it"" not HOW they fixed it.

This is how to fix the ""installing 0/0 kb (-2147483648%)"" problem:

Open the .iso with a program that allows you to extract the files. PowerISO is what I used. Now make a separate folder on your desktop and extract the files from the .iso's there. Once done, run the fairlight installer from there and it works! Hope this helped!

"
,slipp3ry,2011-05-18T02:58Z,"@defendor -- 

it is not the .sid files you want, 

on the 2nd/""b"" .iso, inside the folder named ""fairlight"" , there are a bunch of .zip files titled ""update_cz"", ""update_en"", etc etc... if you want English, open the ""update_en.zip"" .. and there is a folder within called ""data"" ... now copy this folder into your installation folder (usually in c:/windows/program files/shogun total war 2 ) "
,slipp3ry,2011-05-18T03:00Z,"just came back in to say, even with directx11 patch, my game still crashes a lot.. its playable but it crashes a bunch. This is an AWESOME game though , ill probably end up buying it..

plus, the fact that during the campaign, you can play other players on the internet is SICK! and we cant use that feature with the cracked version... support this great game and buy it ! "

Mount disc one, open Fairlight folder, select installer, run installer, during installation it will prompt for disc 2 - drag disc 2 ISO to mount then press ""ok,"" when asked for updates and cracks  on disc 2 just select ok, run the common files when prompted, and you're done.

Also, Shogun2 doesn't appear in your ""games"" folder and doesn't make a desktop icon. Just go to your programs (86) folder or whatever your directory is and copy the shogun2 application icon to your games folder and you can now launch it from there."

I had to install RADTools and FMV-Extractor. You can't just play the .bik files using RADTools. I needed something to analyze the info first and unlock the file in order for RADTools to play the videos. This is where FMV-Extractor came in. I was able to analyze each .bik file and then play them within FMV-Extractor, but it still needed RADTools installed to play the videos.

There are quite a few ending videos missing. The Mori, Oda, Takeda, and Uesugi are all missing. "

,Fireskrit,2011-05-31T04:24Z,"@jimmeh35, the executable file won't be in the folder where you've installed to. When you mount the file, go to the drive that it's been mounted to just in ""My Computer"" and instead of opening the file to run the installation, right-click the drive (mine is default F: drive) and click ""Open"". You should then be able to see a SKIDROW folder; that has what you are looking for."

i decided i like the game enough , so i bought it. $30 from amazon.com and i downloaded from steam. 

took a while to make the game not crash anymore (but i believe this was from the cracked version still not uninstalling completely).

now i can play the game 100% without crashing, and ITS GREAT! also the multiplayer options in this game are AWESOME! during battles on campaign mode, other people will control AI for you and make the battles way better.. 

BUY THIS GAME! THIS DOWNLOAD VERSION SUCKS! "
,slipp3ry,2011-06-03T03:01Z,"sorry i dont mean ""it sucks"" , i appreciate fairlight and what they do .. 

but if you have the $30 to spare, it is well worth buying this game.. and if you are having tons of problems with crashes , buy the legit version and install on a new windows User Account and it'll work "

i got to play about 70 turns with only maybe 3-4 crashes , but around turn 80, my game has started crashing again during every battle. Its extremely fucking annoying , and make sthe game completely unplayable.

so , i recommended that you buy the game if you are fed up with crashing.. well , i take that back. The legit copy crashes all the time as well. So dont buy this game unless they patch is or something because its so fucking buggy, it sucks. 

fuck you sega , fuck you creative labs.. releasing this shit game with all these bugs , its ridiculous

,Banzay27,2011-08-06T04:05Z,"Downloaded fine. Installed fine. Thanks, ez.
The only mishap I had, as it's been denounced here, is the crashing upon reaching a certain turn.

First playthrough, as Oda on easy, had half the map and the Shogunate, it was on turn 213.
Second time, I had yet to make a move on the Shogunate, had almost half the map or so with the Shimazu on Normal. Crashed at turn 173.
Third and last time I devoted to this game's very unpolished campaign I was Hojo on Normal, had a bit over half the map - I state so to give an idea of progress, I doubt it matters regarding the glitch. Haven't bothered to check what turn I was just in but I think I had more turns under me than I had with the Oda, and this time around I'd heavily manipulated the game with a trainer, even using it to regress years when I was getting close to the time limit - which I ended up passing and failing the campaign anyway once I was distracted to cheat back a few years. But that's okay, because you can continue your campaign, it doesn't necessarily all go to waste; besides, we don't get anything as a reward other than a message saying we made it. Every unit has short, re-used intro vid and each major clan has a weak re-used vid for its demise, but no vids for starting campaign or ending or whatever else. I find this worse, relative to Medieval 2.

Anywho, on to making actual relevant criticism yet before this become ranting.
They called it the best Total War yet. Said the campaign AI was markedly improved. I failed to confirm this impression. The only pleasant change I noticed from Medieval 2 - the only other Total War I played - was that allies tended to remain allies better and armies couldn't enter our territory without declaring war. I vaguely recall it being different before and having my realm trespassed by anyone, only to get backstabbed once they were in the outback of my nation and far from my frontline armies. This time, there's military access in diplomacy. But this little improvement hardly makes up for the incredibly blunt AI which will act stupidly linearly. You up the difficulty, they just get more aggressive and somehow pack more and bigger armies. But you hide a reinforcing army in a forest near a town, when they try to take the town and fail on account of the hidden reinforcements, they won't ""learn that the hard way"" as you'd expect. No, they'll keep throwing armies at your town only considering the numbers you have garrisoned.
But one of many flaws. Realm Divide is, of course, another weak sauce feature, meant to halt ""end game steamrolling"" as the community calls it. It's exaggerated and certainly uncreative. Making every clan, allied or no, band together and turn on you until the end of time when you conquer about 1/3 to 1/2 of the map, this way throwing diplomacy and trade out the window, isn't an admirable game device.
The only way to remedy it is with the re-emerging of clans once you are Shogun. They will have a clean slate, though most will still end up allying with your enemies, and the rest will be weak to survive alone.

Only other issue off the top of my head... the auto-battle feature, ever so needed on account of the game being a hardware hog and the slow loading times, can't be counted on to play battles out realistically. It will factor in quantity a lot more than quality, or other factors such as being the defender inside a castle. Many an easy battle I had take to into my own hands because an auto-battle won't consider actual tactics, it's just statistics. I would simply line up my matchlock troops on the inner wall for them to gun down the enemy in droves once they reached the outer courtyard, but that advantage is moot on automatic.

In hindsight, I shouldn't have waited for this release to return to this addictive yet inevitably drudging series. I'm trying out Empire next, hoping I'll have more fun if only because I preferred the firearm units in this one and that the game's older and should run more smoothly - Shogun 2 ran smoothly for me alright, once I had settings mostly under Medium "
,Banzay27,2011-08-06T04:15Z,"Downloaded fine. Installed fine. Thanks, ez.
The only problem I had was the common crashing upon reaching a certain turn. On 3 playthroughs, it happened on 3 different turns. Seemed random, I can't fathom the cause.

Conclusion is I shouldn't have waited for this to return to the series. And not because of this crashes.
They called this the best Total War yet, markedly improved campaign AI. I didn't see it.
No, the AI needs much improvement, the code needs optimization because the loading times and hardware hog are unjustified and it overall feels underwhelming. The battles themselves seem to remain the main attraction. Not much to criticize there other than base mechanics - for instance, ranged units are too stiff in positioning. I once had several matchlock samurai units near a routing enemy unit in range, I had them target them and they didn't shoot in time because of how they turn to position so unrealistically. This mechanic needs to be much more malleable and fluid for ranged combat to work in mobile situations."

If you are looking for a non Pc game  of this subject, play NObunaga's Ambition.

Alright a few notes...
1. PapaBearster theres instructutions work perfectly, if anything happens that they dont, you did something wrong, get over it and look to see if you followed the steps properly, dont get all pissy about it.
2. For some reason the game is immeadiately set to the highest graphics settings, i reccommend that unless you want massive amounts of lag, to lower this to the medium or lowest graphics options and lowest screen resolution selectable, if the game loads slowly the first time, dont panic its just because of the settings that it intially has.
3. I have heard the game to be a softwear hog, im pretty sure this can be remedied by doing the above, i have a 5GB ram and excellent graphics card on one of the newesr Athalon AMD computers, if i expierence any freaky lag or wierd ass gameplay ill post them up.

THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!!!
For one setting the graphics to the lowest gets some really really crappy renderings in general, setting it to high lags the game so badly!, playing medieval 2 on low graphics is 10 times better!
Two the campaign system is like that of Empires and Napoleon Total war, utter crap!, why would you make a game based in the feudal era of Japan in Empire style format, make it in Medieval style format, since most of the animations are not using guns! Next the portraits, unit cards and building pics, are utter crap!, the ones in NObunaga's Ambition were freackin awesome and epic looking, why couldn't they just gain copyrights to use those!, besides which the battles are heavily unrealistic, i lose like half a unit of elite samurai to archers, WTF!!!, and Japanese armor was by non means crap mind you,
they added so much other crap shit to it, that it just overcomplicates an otherwise simple game!

My advice, wait for the Medieval 2 total war Kingdoms mod that is going parallel to this  SHogun 2 total war, but will be using Medieval style tactics and gameplay as well as more promising animations and a much better map of Japan as well as a simple campaign with not as much lag!"

Fairlight's auto install with the 2 DVD's is the best base for the game. All the other ones I've tried seem to have major bugs.

Anyhow, since Pirate Bay doesn't allow us to post links anymore, I'll have to tell you what to search for.

Do a search for:

[FSrv] Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack 

You might have to register to see the page. I was already registered. You'll need to download 7z to unzip the files because for some stupid reason, winrar wouldn't do it. Don't forget to write down the password.

This is actually a patch of a patch. If anyone has used v1.1.0 BUILD 4247.300958, you'll know how many crashes you've had to deal with. This should definitely work. Make sure you remove all your  Microsoft Visual C++ installs. From playing so many games, I honestly think they're starting to cause many issues for games. Anyhow, have fun."
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-26T20:58Z,"***UPDATE AGAIN***

Apparently the above patch is missing 2 files and needs another crack.

Once again, search for:

Download Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack. Download 7z to unzip it, don't forget the password. Then click to page 35 where it reads:

""I am playing ROS without any problems retainers and saves are working great.

This download is old and is missing tons of stuff, including the movies. If you want the complete version with all movies and DLC's do a search for:

R.G.Mechanics is Build 4247, so I don't think you'll need to download ""Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack"" patch. Either way, you'll still need ""patch10.pack Build 4358"" & ""3DMGAME-Shogun2.v1.1.0.Build.4358.0.Crack.Fix2.Patch-3DM"".

What you need to do (very basic so sorry)
I used PowerIso
1) mount both torrents
2) make a folder on your desktop for the game
3) extract game a into the folder
4) extract game b into the folder
-when prompted replace all of the copies and do this for all actions
5) open up the folder (after game a and b are extracted) and go to the starlight folder
6) install and have fun

if you get an error at 98% that means you did not paste b into a (at least for me that's what it meant)

,LeSeedeur,2012-01-20T16:49Z,"This Game Runs Properly for me

I will detail every install steps...

First, get Daemon Tools Lite to mount the first iso image. When it is mounted DO NOT run the setup wich will pop out by default, instead browse the ""CD"" and go inside the FairLight folder where you will find a Setup.exe file wich looks like the steam icon.

After you ran this setup, it will ask for the language and the file directory output, configure those if needed and after, click once on the installation directory textbox (to make it on focus) and press the ENTER key. 

The Installation Should have started by now, when it asks for the second CD do not press anything. Go back to daemon tools, unmount the current cd and mount the second CD. Go back to the installer when Daemon Tools says it is mounted and press the OK button. Wait for the installer to Display Done! with the progress bar at 100% before closing. There is no close button you must close it like you close any other windows with the red X.

Go to your install directory folder and search for Shogun2.exe => Right click on it and make a shortcut. Press the yes button to the dialog to put it on the desktop. Here you go, you are ready to play the game, seed the torrent, rate Five on Five and have FUN !

By the way thanks to the uploader I will buy the game soon because it is AWESOME !"
,LeSeedeur,2012-01-20T16:55Z,"*edit to my previous comment

Don't forget to press YES to the dialog when it asks if you want to update and crack. If you pressed NO then you must follow the instructions the uploader provided in the description of this torrent."

But since then I quit playing since nobody was uploading any of the latest patches and downloads and the mods I played it with was no-longer working with the version I was playing it at.  So then I see this and a beam of hope shun through.  

I load it up on my utorrent, waited a week, installed properly, applied the cracks, and it doesn't even get to any of the splash screens.  It starts up, after a bit my cursor changes to the spearhead, the Shogun 2 screen disappears, it sits on a black screen like its starting up, then it crashes, along with my hopes of playing a more updated version of this game along with the DLC.  I'm playing on XP and my drivers are up to date.

I want to know why this game is receiving to so little attention from crackers anyway.  Is it to much to ask for a working game with updates and DLC?  Especially after months since the game has been released and multiple official patches and dlc's has been released?? Damn"

,Nounread,2012-03-26T07:41Z,no one is going to do Fall of the Samurai so you should just buy it.
,blackdemon90,2012-03-26T18:49Z,"@extremezone hey mate, Im just wondering if you have a CD key for this? I keep getting stuck on the part of the installation where you need a CD key and Im not really seeing anything like that in the info? Am I installing this right because Im pretty sure I followed the info perfectly XD note Im not exactly computer smart so be as simple as possible with me if you can XD"
,noekk,2012-03-26T22:44Z,"Hey Nounread,

""the new Fall of the Samurai is a new software lock and thus is probably uncrackable. RIP free games.""

Is that new software lock called Steam ?

PS - Skidrow already cracked it genius"

,jahbreeze,2012-04-23T04:04Z,"I get almost throught the entire install when it says there was an error.  I have to cancel out.  What's the deal with that?  Anyone else get the same problem?

I am installing using daemon tools lite to mount.  I put dvd 1 and 2 on different drives.  Halfway thru it asks me to find the .sid file to continue.  "
,jahbreeze,2012-04-23T04:33Z,"just solved the issue.  As @donindia mentioned earlier, i had to umount dvd1 and mount dvd2 to the same drive as dvd1 when prompted for 2nd disk.

IM SORRY 

ALLRIGHT THIS IS HOW IT WORKS

1 EXTRACT CD 1 AND 2 INTO ONE MAP DOESN MATTER WHERE 

2 EXTRACT MAP FAIRLIGHTS INTO THAT SAME MAP 

3 DONT LISSEN TOO THOSE DUMB FUCK ABOVE ME NO START THE FAIRLIGHTS INSTALLATION DONT MOUNT ,REALLY DONT MOUNT MIGHT EVEN DISTURB THE INSTALLATION NO JUST EXTRACT FAIRLIGHT MAP AND CD 1 AND 2 INTO THE SAME MAP , AND DONT JUST PASTE THE ISO NO YOU NEED ATLEAST 4 OR 5 CD 1 AND 4 OR 5 CD 2 

NOT: SID SIM AND SIS FILES THOSE ARE THE CD 1 AND 2 FILES 

DO THAT AND I HAVE WINDOWS 7 AND I HAVE PLAYED A BATTLE ANDAFTER THAT TOOK ANOTHER TURN EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECT 


SO DONT MOUNT !!!!! EXTRACT ,

IF U WANNA BE FOR SURE JUST EXTRACT BOTH ISO INTO ONE MAP AND THEN START FAIRLIGHTS INSTALLIATION , THE FAIRLIGHTS INSTALLATION IS IN THE FAIRLIGHT MAP 

BUT DO INSTALL THE STEAM FIRST , 

NOTE : WHEN U INSTALL STEAM  U GONNA GET A ERROR JUST IGNORE AND TRY AGAIN THEN UPDATE , AND DONT MAKE AN ACCOUNT JUST GET STEAM UP AND RUNNING DONT GO FILLING NAMES OR EMAILES , THEN U GONNA GET ASSRAPED BY STEAM

NO JUST INSTALL STEAM IGNORE ERROR UPDATE 

AND EXTRACT ALL FILES INTO ONE MAP AND START UP FAIRLIGHTS

NOTE: FAIRLIGHT CAN BE START UP BIJ DE FILE ''INSTALLER ;; IN THE FAIRLIGHT MAP 

IF U DONT MAKE IT NOW U HAVE AN IQ OF A MAGGOT AND 

IM GONNNA GIVE U THE NEXT INSTRUCTION 

BUY A GUN , PUT IT IN UR MOUTH AND PULL THE TRIGGER , CUZ U ARE ALREADY BRAIN DEATH "

,zxcv2012,2012-05-22T04:57Z,"so i played this version for a while and it worked perfectly. I was running it on almost all ultra settings and still maintained high FPS. But i wanted to get FOTS so i got the other torrent from extremezone and installed it fine and everything, but i only have the options for low or medium settings on DX9-10 with still a lot of lag. would anybody know why this is? i might be asking in the wrong place, i already tried to ask it on the torrent i downloaded; thanks."

,MikePony,2012-06-22T23:52Z,"Cannot confirm as working, yet, but as for an install error, I got it around 50%, or so and followed Auricon's advice. I had both images mounted in separate drives.
