Who the hell are you man? Are you asking for it or Ordering him to do it? Get a life for gods sake. Go and Join some institute to learn Written-English like 
Inlingua, British School Of Language or British Council. May its not your problem you don't know how to write properly!

@Ataractic
I dont know these fellows come out in unwanted places, I have one more to add to this list. FETAL19 (Viciously) he is literally more crazy guy from Spain. What he does cant beat anything, He post spoilers, Can you imagine anything worst than reading spoiler on a sports torrent. Seriously these PITA needs Spanking big time.

Instead of thanking - or showing even a sign of gratitude - you bombarded all of us with same asking again and again.

Not to mention your totally rabid outbursts, admission that you are responsible (with cronies of yours) for minuses saying to all of us ""I can't resist"". I can prove shit now, after 102 comments were erased.

You constantly put petroleum on fire, inspiring other lunatics to scream some nonsense.

Thx again 20-40 for ignoring these ingrates."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-21T07:24Z,trouble with private trackers is you have to have an invite to use them.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T07:50Z,"@silveroakleaf: I am a member of many private tracker sites, but I don't upload there.

Regardless of few bad seeds in barrel, aside 99% of Hit&Runs, knowing but neglecting what many people think of me (hating me, as I talk too much, I am no good, some have better encodes than me, ""I have small dick, but I know the guy who have huge one"") deep down inside, I know that I am right, I do have a right and I would be here to the day I die (cheer up folks! that joyous day is closer than you think...)

Then, some of you would join private-tracker sites and see the truth - you would download less and you'll have troubles (or not been able) to maintain needed share ratio - without donations - paying for someone's work once done for free. "

do not bring a country's name into this .

u know that evry uploader u request movies from--stylishsal, riddler, goku61,gunnersrock ,rapidripper n many many others r all indians..
wat does that make u??--- a motherrrrrrr fuckerrrrrrrr

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T11:49Z,"""ppl with eyes do read""

NOT just with pair of eyes, people should understand what is written. Working brain is needed.

So far, you proved two things for sure:

- your ""chatlish"" ""tweetie"" sub-language is insufficient for any conversation

- you are bad, pathetic human being, because every time (regarding Lie To Me and other requests from you) when I bite the shit and have mercy - you turned  around, wanting to chop my head of (this is NOT your first mental breakdown here) and visiting threads of other uploaders bragged about me - then come back - do some shit -  scream - run away - come back - shortly, acted as insane person.

You cannot handle me - BUT - you came to me - and you should act as majority do regularly: Grab something, seed shit back, saying to yourself ""Fuck you, twentyforty"" - and BE QUIET.

BTW, do not point to minuses - WE KNOW THAT YOU AND OTHER LUNATIC ARE RESPONSIBLE - YOU ADMITTED THAT, REMEMBER?

,muk0690,2011-03-21T12:41Z,"@banukaknight: You are a pathetic, lunatic, bag of crap. You are not a piece of crap but a bag of crap. Don't ever bring up the country again. "

anyways i told u before man.
i've gotten rid of that ""leisure  time activity long time ago.. clicking on ""-""
i'm more like a  ""+"" guy now
btw...
i'm really pissed at right now is that i don't f'n understand what the hell means ""syfyoriginal____"" movies
because fml last time i checked... the answer was... funny but not helping me.

oh! Jack ass 4D
look who's talking.
what to do man. i'm not twilight guy with cold heart. hard to leave the neighborhood ""P"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T21:01Z,"""syfyoriginal"" is a part of movie name, not put there by me or for nothing, but from SYFY TV channel, probably because of type of your asking - to distinct syfy channel production from Hollywood one. In same note, I  should say that syfy movie production sucks and mainly these movies are, so called ""B"" or even ""C"" production, and in general, should be avoided or ""taken with care"".

Regarding the minuses and especially things you have said, not just here, but throwing the mud on me, personally insulting me and invitng lunatics to come and ruin my work and hard earned reputation - I hope you would realize how much harm was done and, to be honest, some things must not be forgiven, no matter what.
