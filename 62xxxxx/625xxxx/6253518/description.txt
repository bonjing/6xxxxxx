another fresh release of VLC 1.2.0-git from today
still in beta stage but stable enough.
Untouched,uncompressed 100% original win32 setup exe
enjoy
regards note :
saw many hugarians and armenians guys that were freezed on my torrents.
all ip have been logged...
by this fact if this problem will reappear,i will be forced to temporary ban certains connections...
Don't worry,such ban will be for a short time,indeed !
I repeat again and again :
fast upload is needed from your part for each of my torrents.
minimum :50 ko/s...
set your upload to 0 if needed(mean maximum or unlimited)
set correctly your torrent client ! go to setting options of your utorrent and go to setup guide to make a full speed test of your connection and get thus all right settings for.
if you cannot download then it can mean that you don't give speed up enough.
avoid any proxy ! if you use VPN connection,be sure it is rightly set before.
If you are freezed :
Then disconnect and stop spamming as well as freezing my upload of my torrents;
leave it and let place to the others peers.quite disappointing in such cases for me so.slow connections are not suggested for my torrents.
Best is cable,T1,optical fiber,ADSL2,ADSL2+ on low ping with minimum 1 meg up
Well in this way,
i wish you have a pleasant download
ty for understanding
regards
