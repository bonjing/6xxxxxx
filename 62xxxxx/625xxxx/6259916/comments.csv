[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T15:17Z,"@Kencoldman: Hi, long time no see.
Season of  Lie to me and similar shows (by ep. number) is too big for me (3.1 GB) and more than double above the limit. Sorry."

,the_shroud,2011-03-21T16:40Z,"Thanks for Becoming Human, Breakout Kings & Californication :)
Just started to collect BK upon your recommendation but guess I started too late, been trying to download ep1 from 2nd Week Mar and Mar 06 pack for 4 days now. 
Anyone out there who's still got it, please seed again. Thx"
,Kencoldman,2011-03-21T16:58Z,Thank's for the quick response and all your hard work. I'll just try and download slowly. But if possible you can upload the weekly episode of Lie to Me would make some happy I guess.
,Kencoldman,2011-03-21T17:02Z,Thank's for the quick response. I'll just download the old fashioned way. Will you add Lie to Me to the weekly upload by episode we would be verry happy. Thank's for all your hard work that you do for us expecting only that we help seed. 
,jotalopes,2011-03-21T17:15Z,Thanks for Family Guy!
,Ataractic,2011-03-21T17:25Z,"2040: Thanks a lot for Californication and Breakout kings.

the_shroud: I'm trying to download BK episode 1 too- to no avail. If you manage to download it completely, can you plase seed it for a few days? Thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T17:42Z,"About Lost Girl and old encodes:

Just a  glance over my quote of the quote would solve the ""mystery"" over older encodes.

I cannot, stop everything just to obtain few Gigabytes big sources, encode them all. spend a week for upping, and then - thanking to gazillion minuses torrent die in 24h, like happened just yesterday.

How anyone could have problems with understanding consequence of ""minusing"" - no one sane (who is not here at daily basis and KNOW what's going on) would download a torrent under 67 minuses.

I have done great Treme torrent, 2.2 GB instead of 6.5 - and get 42 downloads, 9 seeders.

Same crap happens with all targeted torrents.

People are great when they need something only (except just handful of ""regulars"").

Now - you all can get the idea how do I feel. 
Now - you all can find reason more to hate me more - because who to fuck am I to tell you anything.

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T17:45Z,@Ataractic & @the_shroud: Day after tomorrow. Be here.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T17:56Z,@Ataractic & @the_shroud: I loaded 2nd.Week torrent and seed BK 01 now. Slow as hell.

,the_shroud,2011-03-22T04:30Z,"btw guys, for the past few days I've been ""right clicking-open in new tab"" 2 pages worth of 20-40's torrents to plus(+) them at every new session.
There's been a large build-up of minuses(-) between Treme and Beautiful.2009.
Lets come together and set the record straight re quality of 20-40's encoding. WE CAN WIN"
