For those unfamiliar with ISO, you will need to either load the ISO file with a virtual disc program to play it:
Using a program such as Magic Disk:<a href="http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-history.htm">http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-history.ht</a> (freeware)

or burn it to a DVD-R using a program like Nero

Enjoy! ;)
