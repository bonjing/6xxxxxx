I didn't play on my psp for a LONG time, and i'm scared i'll screw things up when I try to update to another firmware.. Also because i'm confused with the whole thing.. I remember M33 is not updating anymore, so I had to download 5.50 GEN-B, but now what?
Please tell me!!
Or email me to powerlifehd@gmail.com !!"
