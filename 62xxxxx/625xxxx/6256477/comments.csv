Stop bitching about somthing that's free!!

Thanks eztv! 
You're my number 1 stop for all tv shows! Keep up the good work."
,o0alias0o,2011-03-20T14:06Z,"Once again thanks eztv!
Always clean and always the BEST quality viewing!"
,Markstern,2011-03-20T15:31Z,"If you don't like eztv's screenshot Moocheet then here's a thought; Make your own after you download it? Or do you propose that the major uploaders should be required to try and anticipate the needs of every lazy, ungrateful dipshit coming their way whining about stupid shit that either doesn't matter, or that can be solved by said ungrateful moron in a matter of minutes? In short, if you don't like this release for some reason, consider that no one is forcing you to download it, you f***ing ingrate. Great upload eztv, as always."
,RipOrDie999,2011-03-20T18:27Z,"Thanks. A friend started watching and is ""man, I think you got tricked, and this is the wrong episode.""

And I was: ""No way man, this is EZTV."" And we left it at that. "
,bagdouche1225,2011-03-21T02:21Z,Thanks again!
,Blueguru2,2011-03-21T14:52Z,"The quality is good but the source was 25fps so it runs a bit faster and sounds are 4% higher frequency. This is PAL speed, if you are used to NTSC speed you will find yourself slightly amused/confused.

If you are looking for the HD version, as usual the bit torrent world is slower than the donkey world: ed2k://|file|Star.Wars.The.Clone.Wars.S03E21.Padawan.Lost.OAR.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA.mkv|585415770|9F91A50F6E91C0C4B57B5FF0F7D85BA4|/"
