Many thanks, the image quality of this is much better than the previous torrent (if only a bit dark). Also, it's not cropped, showing the full image area - and you get to see the intro/opening credits!

Just 2 things:
1 > The aspect ratio is wrong, resulting in a too wide image - change it to 4:3 (easily done in VLC) and it's just about right.
2 > There's movie sound in the right channel only, with just noise in the left. This is also easily solved in VLC, by choosing Audio Channels, Right. 

And oh - if you want Swedish subs for the English parts, you have hardburned ones in that old torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5213088/ ;)"

(It's actually better on that other torrent, I even tried to use that audio with this video, but they sadly went out of sync after a while).

Let's just hope all of Widerberg's movies will one day be released on DVD (dare I say Blu-ray?) - as of now, just 5 out of 13 are! Of those other 8, all but 2 are thankfully available here @ TPB (just Heja Roland! and Victoria are missing)."
