,themadhumper,2011-03-20T19:24Z,So thats a no on putting up the whole 3rd season?
[T],MelloYello,2011-03-20T20:45Z,First I have heard about it.  I don't have all the episodes at the moment but I'll see if I can get it done.
,themadhumper,2011-03-21T12:50Z,"Sweet beans, thanks...seasons 1 & 2 are up here somewhere....but no one's done season 3...which is a shame."
[T],MelloYello,2011-03-25T00:51Z,No one has done season 3 yet because it isn't finished until episode 22.  I got all episodes encoded I'm just waiting for the finale on Saturday.
