A nice see through tights outfit looks amazing.
Ella looks like she's gonna be the first to show the goods.
And next weeks the pussy peek Who Hoo.
Sandra still my fav but Ella a very close second."

,proud0,2011-03-19T04:15Z,"Thanks for the post. Your efforts are always appreciated. HOWEVER! The more I see of these models, the clearer it becomes that they are past their prime for what they were: child and teen models. While technically, they are still in their teens, it's the earlier part of the teen years that was of most fascination to many if not most who enjoy this hobby. Fame Girls need to trot out some younger models (we might not be able to share on TPB, but that's not the issue) to keep fresh and relevant. Ella, Sandra, and Virginia, while they have given many years of enjoyment, are now like girl gymnasts at their third Olympics. They are good, but not the best, just sentimental old favorites who didn't know when to call it quits."
