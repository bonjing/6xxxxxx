,JIHUIN,2011-03-20T03:33Z,"Hi mate! First of all I would like to thank you for uploading this game...I'm downloading it right now at 90kb/sec...it's good that there's a patched and unpatched version...i'll feedback the result after I finish downloading the file...by the way mate, the God Eater Burst you have uploaded recently, is there a patched ISO for that one?"
,grave18,2011-03-20T04:16Z,Downloaded the unpatched iso. This does not have in battle voices (like character comments during the fight and other SFX). It also hangs when starting the 1st chapter with lightning and if youre playing or battling tifa or cloud. Will check the patched one for any issues
,xgun75,2011-03-20T04:44Z,"Got the unpatched iso. Does not work on 6.31+prom v1. (Shows white screen after setup). Will try the patched one. Hope it works, even though it is for non-prom."

,Impulsedrive,2011-03-20T08:12Z,"I'm on 6.35 Pro and had freeze/crash issues, and I used the patched one instead and now Chapter 1 loads so I assume all will be well from here on out."
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-20T09:47Z,"robotiod, i'm gonna check this and will report back.

P-roy, yup, fb.com/nitrogenua

Adaness, most likely it will work on 5.00, though, if you considering updating, you can use this http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/1873 - it works on custom firmwares higher then 4.01 M33. Then just install the prometheus upgrade from here http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/1953 and you're good to go."
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-20T10:11Z,"JIHUIN, hey. You're welcome. Speaking of Gods Eater, there may be some development, i'll check it and report back when i'll have some spare time. The games coming so fast! Kizuna Drive and Jikandina already coming in!

Glad i was cautious enough to include both, though, sorry for making some of you download BOTH. Btw, grave18, what FW do you use? Collecting compatibility data :)

blaze612, well, there are couple of private trackers, which post things very fast and early."
,xgun75,2011-03-20T13:17Z,"Patched version seems to be working fine on my slim psp cfw6.31+prom v1. I say dont d/l the unpatched one at all. Thanks for the up, Nitrogen."

,roxas_nevermore,2011-03-21T00:12Z,"sorry to doubt this NitrogenUA, i know your torrents is always for real, but i thought the US will be out on 22nd, and EU on 25th. Is this really EU? sorry X)"
,joshvil,2011-03-21T00:41Z,"no doubt.. this is dissidia 012.. patched version works great for me.. using cfw 5.03 prometheus & psp 3000.

,NitrogenUA,2011-03-21T17:11Z,"grave18, thanks.

roxas_nevermore, i don't know what kind of proof you demand :) screens, captured video? pretty much any electronic data can be forged, so just take my word on it ;) i see no point in fooling people.

Speaking of saves import feature and US version, it seems like EU version is kinda buggy on import, it declined to import my savegame, showing it as corrupted. On the other hand - i've got a word that US version imports saves fine, both from original Dissidia and from Prologus. I'm working on US version at the moment, expect it in a couple of hours. Love."

,NitrogenUA,2011-03-23T23:00Z,"bnkboi, hey. as zedlimra stated, just try pressing start OR download the patched ISO.

Based on reports gathered, unpatched game works better on 6.35/6.37 firmwares.

Working like a charm on 6.35 PRO"
,NitrogenUA,2011-05-28T12:06Z,"SoraxNamine, red flashing is ok. Yes, your firmware is 5.50 Prometheus. When screen goes white press Start or X and the game should continue.

piecereese, i haven't played far through game, so i haven't encountered any sound problems. Can it be, not every dialogue has been voiced? Or different characters might have or have not a voice during the same dialogue sequence? Clarify this for me please."

,silencesummer,2011-07-06T02:02Z,"Yes, it worked for me! I had no idea how to use ISOs before on the PSP, turns out its super simple! The ""patched"" version worked for me, so I guess I have Prometheus, v 5.5.

As for the game, I had played a few minutes of the older Dissidia game, but I have no freaking idea what is going on in this game; I still don't have a grasp of the controls. The ""RPG"" style is so simple its boring, but the manual controls I don't get, probably because I chose RPG first so that's what the tutorial battle was on..."
