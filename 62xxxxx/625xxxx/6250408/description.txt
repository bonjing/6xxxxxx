300-Plus Classical Works - A Personal Compilation

Encoding: MP3
Bitrate: 128kbps
Count: 312 pieces

I'm back with a more tweaked and slightly expanded version of what I previously offered in my 300 Classical Favorites volume, not being able to let my previous version rest in peace! But I promise this IS the last version as I don't see anything to improve on or add to. Some of the previous tracks I noticed were abridged versions of the original, which I replaced with the full length recording of that piece. Some new ones I added which I thought were worth being represented here. Some I just didn't like the sound of the instruments used, and I replaced them with arrangements transcribed for different instruments. And yes, I included Beethoven's Ode to Joy this time and happy with that recording!

You may ask what was my criteria for putting together this compilation...what I included versus what I left out. I was looking for works that were more melodic in nature than what I'd call abstract. Something you can hum to and follow along in the melody, something you can join in the particular energy of the piece or be taken up in the romanticism it portrays. Something you can dance to or be emotionally transported into the fantastic world or story that the music creates in its melodies and movements!

I know the 128kbps is too low for many classical audiophiles out there...but for those who enjoy listening to classical radio broadcasts, you'll find this to be superior in sound quality. I may also point out that no encoding can ever be better than the source recording...and if the source sounds muddy or otherwise poor quality, that's what you'll get at 320kbps or lossless flac format. So my task was to find superior sounding source recordings that I can encode down to 128 to get the highest quality sound at this encoding level. My reason for using the 128kbps limit was to keep the footprint of this package relatively low on your hard drive or portable MP3 player while still delivering good listening-quality classical music.

Hope all will enjoy and treasure this final version of my compilation. I originally did this just for myself...to have a broad spectrum of good classical music all in one volume to load on my ipod and just let it play all day long without touching it. Now it's my gift to everyone who will appreciate what I'm offering here!
