The title track which opens the album is awesome. It has quickly risen to become one of my favorite metal tracks. The rest of the album is pretty consistently awesome. This is my first Metal Church album, so apparently there's a different vocalist than in the past. I found the vocalist to fit just fine with the music, perhaps if I had their other stuff I would have a different opinion. 

The one *big* downer for me on this is the production. I know they were going for a "retro" sound here but I didn't dump $10k on a sound system to hear muddy tones. It really agitates me at first but I get used to it after ONLY listening to this album a bit. If you're picky about sound you might not like this album's production. But don't let that get in the way entirely, or you'll miss out on a great metal album!
