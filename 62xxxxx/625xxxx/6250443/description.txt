This is a rare and beautiful duet album featuring jazz virtuosos Oscar Peterson (piano) and Milt Jackson (vibraphone).

This is a 1992 digital remaster of an album originally released in 1983. I ripped the CD myself using lossless encoding (FLAC).

The tracks are:

1.) Lady Be Good
2.) If I Had You
3.) Limehouse Blues
4.) Mister Basie
5.) Reunion Blues
6.) More Than You Know
7.) Just You, Just Me
8.) Here's Two of the Few

From the liner notes:

"The concept of the rhythm section in jazz has been founded on the assumption that [...] it is necessary to have one or all of the following: bass, drums, guitar. But a few players can break the rules. Two of the few are Oscar Peterson and Milt Jackson, who prove here that it is possible to operate from an internal rhythmic pulse and swing just as hard as if a rhythm section were present. Further, they create melodic and harmonic beauties with none of the collisions or confusions suggested by the sonic similarities of vibes and piano..."

Enjoy!
