,daba_1,2011-03-19T19:15Z,"The brassy, 12-track Nothin' but the Truth is the first recording by this former Duke/Peacock sideman to see the light of day in more than 40 years. Now in his mid-seventies, Texas Johnny Brown remains one of the more immovable veterans dotting the inexplicably low-key Houston blues landscape. And this spirited collection plays up Brown's dual strengths as a songwriter and entertainer. The album features 11 originals, a few done up in stylish big band threads ĂÂ  la B.B. King -- the sort of simmering, sophisticated grooves that straddle the fence between juke-joint wailing and nightclub-slick rhythm & blues. The most memorable moments on Nothin' tend toward R&B's staunch reliance on structure, melody, and spot-on production values. The insistent toe-tappers ""Your House, Your Home"" and ""Stand the Pain"" and the keyboard-drenched ""Blue and Lonesome"" are easily among Brown's best."
