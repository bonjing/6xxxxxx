,aarque,2011-03-18T14:19Z,"You know what? YOU'RE WELCOME you pissy little whiner. Here, mama's boy, click on the link it took me all of 45 seconds to dig up, the link to the FTX support page that has the version 1.5 upgrade. I can't help you if you can't be bothered to click the link, the same way you can't be bothered to even RESEARCH your own dam patch.

You need to ask yourself: ""How am I going to survive when my mother dies and stops shoving the food down my throat?""

,aarque,2011-03-20T11:41Z,"Yes well I did search, which works so poorly from here that I usually have to find one of my comments to check my torrents because keyword search fails. So apologies to the original seeder.

 Stupid me for assuming somebody would type their request into the search bar first before going to the trouble to erite out a comment asking somebody else to search it for them. "
