          The Woman in Red (1984) With English Subtitles
          ----------------------------------------------        
This is the film which is very dear to me. It stars my favorite actor: Gene Wilder.

The film deals with the topic of love-at-first-sigh and what a love and at what a time in his life!!! San Francisco ad man Teddy Pierce (Wilder) falls head over heals in love with Charlotte (Kelly LeBrock) as she walks over a grate and a rush of air from the grate causes her skirt to lift up in a revealing manner (a parody of Marilyn Monroe in The Seven-Year Itch).

Teddy is happily married to Didi, but he can't get this woman out of his mind. Encouraged by his friends Buddy, Joe and Michael, he tries to ask her for a date but mistakenly phones Ms. Milner, a plain ad-agency employee, instead. Teddy ultimately does become acquainted with Charlotte.

He begins using elaborate ruses to see her socially without his wife finding out. Meanwhile, he incurs the wrath of Ms. Milner, whom he stands up. Events come to a head in Charlotte's high-rise apartment, where she invites Teddy into her bed.

What happens next is for YOU to find out.
