,tideomega,2011-04-19T01:19Z,"ChattChitto, installed and on the welcome screen there was only one  program that said never expire(which was the Free program) and now they ""ALL"" say never expire which means that I  installed the program correctly.I use Zone Alarm and Now can you guys tell me if I need to block it from accessing the net or is there a setting that I should uncheck to keep it from trying to get updates ? Should I ask these questions on the SuprBay Forum ? Sorry for long post.
