    A small community is besieged by vampires. After he watches friends      
    ravaged in a convenience store, a lone avenger goes off to do battle     
    with the undead, armed with shotgun, chainsaw, and Holy water. Later     
    he finds other survivors and they try to stay alive long enough to do    
    battle with Liven, king of the vampires.
