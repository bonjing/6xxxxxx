Synopsis: Believing that "a man is measured by his enemies", Harry Maloney (Colm Meaney) plots to destroy George O'Flaherty, the most powerful man in town. Unfortunately for Harry, his chosen nemesis is also the town's matchmaker, and he needs George to broker the marriage of his dim but handsome son, Gus (Cillian Murphy). Being indebted to George only fuels Harry's irrational hatred more. But somehow, no matter how hard he schemes to bedevil George, Harry proves to be his own worst enemy.
