                              PLOT                               


       At the beginning of the film, Frankie Wilde is a wildly      
   successful DJ on the party island of Ibiza. He has a recording   
   contract, performs at high-profile nightclubs, and lives in a   
   luxurious villa with his trophy wife, Sonya, and their son. In   
  talking head sequences, contemporary DJs laud Frankie's turntable 
   skills during this period. It is also evident that Frankie has   
    cocaine and alcohol addictions (in hallucinations, his drug     
  addiction is represented by a giant, menacing badger). His career 
             is increasingly guided by egotistical,                 
               insensitive super-agent Max Haggar.
