,ProLT,2011-03-20T10:04Z,Thanks it works ;) All 4 costumes in my inventory and saves are not changed (damaged)
,TempDude29,2011-03-20T10:49Z,Confirmed. Works great with no problems so far.
,lukegoodman2001,2011-03-20T12:05Z,nice one thanks how do u use the cheats? unicorn etc?
,klord2010,2011-03-20T12:11Z,"Nice up. It's worked nicely, too. Thanks."
,shdspyker,2011-03-20T12:20Z,"@lukegoodman2001, cheats only work in DNA(Replay) mode, after you enter a DNA memory, goto options and then cheats."
,martronn,2011-03-20T13:30Z,"Win 7:
C:\Users\(User Name)\Saved Games\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\Saves  what doe's this mean?

 this folder don't exist!! so where do i install this???"
,martronn,2011-03-20T13:37Z,???
,shdspyker,2011-03-20T13:38Z,"@martonn, you hhave to change (User name) with the account you are using on your PC right now."
,shdspyker,2011-03-20T13:42Z,"GOOD NEWS FOR ALL RIPPED VERSION USERS WHO CAN'T UPDATE!!!!

You can still play the DLC, download the SKIDROW's cracked files for 1.01 and overwrite in your game directory."
,martronn,2011-03-20T13:51Z,you mean i got to change the name of my account on my PC??
,shdspyker,2011-03-20T14:50Z,"@matronn No, open this folder, I was just indicating that you have to paste it in your user directory saved games as you can see above in the description^"
,Zeplinx,2011-03-20T15:16Z,"@matronn It's probably in C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\SAVES

That's where I had it in Win 7 64bit"
,shdspyker,2011-03-20T15:44Z,"@hollow Yes you can, but don't forget to replace the 1.01 exe files from SKIDROW's update.

I'm also using globe's version."
,shdspyker,2011-03-20T17:00Z,"@Zeplinx, I use x64 too, but I found mine in the folder I wrote in description."
,cirios8300,2011-03-20T19:55Z,shdspyker:         THANK YOU !
,Furious1964,2011-03-20T23:20Z,"It works, but I hope they release the DLC's, the Templar Lairs and the ability to invest in the shops."
,shdspyker,2011-03-21T03:28Z,"@Furious1964, check map AFTER completing the main story, the DLC and Lair are there."
,shdspyker,2011-03-21T03:30Z,"and idk if the investments will work cuz it requires ubiaccount, maybe if skidrow does something about it...but I played without investment and it's fine, investments will only make you more money in shops and money is quite easy to make in AC:B anyway."
,korlaeda,2011-03-21T13:38Z,"unfortunately, Raiden outfit disapppeared after installing :("

But then I'm stuck in that grey place with all the white lines moving, I'm stuck in that loading screen and I'm invisible :s
