Special Announcement:
=====================
Release #1000!
Two boys sit on a train, in rural areas of a low density populated part
of the world. There and then they form a pact that will forever change
the course of the computer industry, marking a shift in culture that is
soon to reach far and beyond their own expectations, and the horizon of
their own vision. There and then, the group FairLight was born.

April 1987 was the year when the infant was conceived. The infant is
now a grown man at the age of 23 who made significant impressions on
Commodore 64, Amiga, Super Nintendo and the PC scenes, both for demo and
cracks. Today we celebrate a historic day, a day few people would even
envisage could ever come - FairLight celebrates it's 1000th release!
Well, this is naturally not entirely correct, it's release #1000 on
PC ISO which followed hundreds of on C64, Amiga, SNES and earlier
PC floppy scene appearing in parallel, or the dozens of mind boggling demos
ever seen on most consumer hardware. So, rejoice and celebrate today as you
are one of those who can taste yet another fruit, resulting from our
blood, sweat and skills. Hours, days, weeks and months have been spent
- both screen time and in some cases also prison time, for you to enjoy our
work. Rejoice and celebrate with us, the efforts earning your respect. We
are still here; we are still the sentinels of a world free of copy
protections. We are still here as we were built stronger to last longer.

We are FairLight, standing up for quality, tradition and pride!

The FairLight council stands with eyes wet in admiration from the work
of the PC ISO section. "Boys, you have all done well. You bow to no one!"
We are proud to be the first gameISO group reaching #1000 gameISO releases.
FairLight started the gameISO division in late 1998 and is still going.
For your pleasure, check the FairLight dir for all the #1000 nfo's, and the
releases.txt for all the game releases both in the included zip-file.
Special thanks to our lost/retired members that made this possible!
In April 2012 we will celebrate our 25th anniversary. Stay tuned!

Game information:
=================

In 2000, the Creative Assembly re-invented the strategy genre with Shogun:
Total War, an unprecedented blend of 3D real-time battles and turn-based
management game and the first offering in the multi-award winning series.
With over 7 million units sold and universal acclaim from the press and
community, Total War has consistently been at the cutting edge of the genre
and is today one of the most successful PC franchises of all time.
In 2011, the makers of Rome and Empire: Total War will release the sequel
to the game that started it all. Shogun 2: Total War will take long-time
veterans and newcomers alike to the next level of strategy gaming on PC.
Based on 10 years of experience in making Total War, Shogun 2 is the
perfection of the series with a new Artificial Intelligence (AI),
revolutionary multiplayer modes, brand new campaign map options and epic 3D
real-time battles.
It is the middle of the 16th century in Medieval Japan. The country, once
ruled by a unified government, is now split into many warring clans. The
player takes on the role of one Daimyo - the clan leader - and will use
military engagements, economics and diplomacy to achieve the ultimate goal:
re-unite Japan under his supreme command and become the new Shogun - the
undisputed ruler of Japan.
Set during the golden age of Samurai warfare, Shogun 2 brings to life the
most turbulent period of Japanese history.
* New character progression
* A complete single and multiplayer offering
* New Generation AI system
* Improved land and naval battle gameplay
* Accessible and in-depth empire-building gameplay

Installation Information:
=========================

* Burn or Mount.
* Use our Installer located on DVD1 in the FairLight folder. When asked if
you want to apply updates and crack press Yes. If this step fails or if
you want to do it manually by extracting the zip files in the FairLight
folder on DVD2, you will need to extract update_common.zip and one of the
update_XX.zip depending on what language you choose to install.
We leave it as an exercise to the user to figure out which one.
* Launch the game using Shogun2.exe in the directory where you installed it.
* Buy the game if you enjoy it, saves are compatible with uncracked version.
