,enigma62,2011-03-20T14:53Z,Works great.Thank you.LEGO Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Video Game out May 13th.
,avengerz43,2011-03-20T20:44Z,Didn't work for me on 4.2U wiikey2 all updated. Burnt to DVD using imgburn. Sure it works fine off USB loaders but for those disc users wait for another one. 
,silingual,2011-03-21T00:16Z,This didn't work for me either. I couldn't get it to copy over to a wbfs drive in order to try it with CFG loader. Don't know exactly what went wrong but I kept getting errors copying it using Wiithon.

What the hell is Wiithon? Use this program for WBFS:

,Starmont,2011-03-21T14:24Z,PAL or NTSC?
,Starmont,2011-03-21T14:30Z,So Is it PAL or NTSC?!
,silingual,2011-03-21T14:44Z,wiiGM: Wiithon is the wbfs drive manager for linux. It worked fine for everything but this. I have never ran into problems with it moving stuff to the wbfs drive. I might just update the cios later and use fat32 on the drive just haven't had time. I will find a Win box and try it tho but I doubt it is Wiithon.
,exdeee,2011-03-21T15:21Z,"@Starmont: USA means NTSC.

@silingual: I'm clueless about Wiithon, all I can tell you is that I used WBFS Manager 3.0 (on a win box, of course) and it works like a charm."
,240p,2011-03-22T14:30Z,When i start there is a black screen. i'm on usb loader gx on IOS249 base57 rev 20.
,fldc,2011-03-23T02:42Z,"I would recommend fat32 and using the wbfs_file cmd line util for linux, so much easier :D
And for black screen on usb loader gx, this seems to be happening with some ntsc games on a pal machine, try it in wiiflow or cfg usb loader."
,240p,2011-03-23T21:11Z,thx
