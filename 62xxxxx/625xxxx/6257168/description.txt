UglyTruth Discusses Possiblity of Stuxnet Attack on Fukushima

A very interesting discussion of the origins and history of the Stuxnet malware program and the cui bonos and WTFs involved in the fallure of the backup systems at Fukushima.  Highly recommended for the strong of stomach.


We are joined by Keith Johnson of www.revoltoftheplebs.com and and Jonathon Azaziah of www.maskofzion.com to talk about the possibility (likelihood) of Israel's Stuxnet virus being used in bringing about the meltdown of the reactors in Japan, as well as the recent murders in the West Bank as a pretext for even more war against the Palestinians.
