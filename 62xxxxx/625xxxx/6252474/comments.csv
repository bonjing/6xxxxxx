I tried this game on  kmeaw 3.55 cfw internal as well as external. These are the steps i followed:
1) Copy to Game in usb
3) Used gaia to select the game

When i run the game(externally or internally) the screen goes black for 8 - 10 seconds and then main menu screens open. 

Whats the way to run this game???"

,yasuodances,2011-05-15T08:36Z,"psmods, 
Don't tell others to post a new thread on a forum. That's bad habit, they should search the forums first to see if there are any related post. I get tired of seeing the same post pop up in a new topic that has been answered so many times."
