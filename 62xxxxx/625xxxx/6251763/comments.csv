On August 11, 2011, mysterious objects thought to be meteorites crash into Earth's oceans near several major cities. These objects are revealed to be spacecraft, containing hostile alien forces. The U.S. Marines from Camp Pendleton arrive in Los Angeles to defend against alien ground forces and assist in the evacuation of civilians, in preparation for a bombing campaign. Among the military's forces are Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart), a U.S. Marine Staff Sergeant who had planned to retire, and his new platoon."

[V],globeplus,2011-03-19T22:18Z,"To Ace24502 : read this if you want

http://www.maximumcompression.com/programs.php

but the compression depends too on the possible compression of the files that you are compressing , some will have better ratio than another ones , audio or video files the compression is almost nothing , so for this particular type of files you need to work the files itselfs reducing their size with less bitrate with conversion tools for audio or video.

I hope this comment help you . Best of luck ."

,5amjr,2011-07-25T23:38Z,"Jamo most of his uploads are cams, other uploaders files which he puts through a simple dub plugin and re-names his own.
He says it takes him 15 hours work on each cam, lol, the green skull is his lifeline and goes for quantity not quality!
It's sad."
