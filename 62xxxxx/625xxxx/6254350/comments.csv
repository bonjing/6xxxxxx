,daba_1,2011-03-19T10:38Z,"The four remaining JOB sides by Pryor (""Boogy Fool,"" ""Raisin' Sand,"" ""Cryin' Shame"" and ""Eighty Nine Ten"") are to be found here on this compilation, with Snooky also found in support on two tracks from a 1949 Baby Face Leroy session. With the other 13 tracks including John Lee Henley's ""Rhythm Rockin' Boogie,"" Walter Horton's ""Have A Good Time"" and rare but notable sides by Sonny Boy Williamson, Little Willie Foster and Louis Myers And The Aces, this is a harmonica rarities package that's pretty tough to beat.
