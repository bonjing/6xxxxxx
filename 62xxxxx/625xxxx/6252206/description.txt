Chomskian Abstract - 2007.03.09 - Cornelia Parker - GCJM

===========

Noam Chomsky responding to questions asked by Cornelia Parker at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 9 March 2007.

A 41 minute interview, without questions.
Silence replaces the interviewer's questions to leave a poignant pause for reflection and anticipation, a curiosity in place of the obvious.

===========

I am an artist living in London writing to ask you a favour. I was wondering whether it would be at all possible for me to visit you at MIT [the Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in order to record a video conversation based on your thoughts about the unfolding environmental disaster now threatening our world. I have read with great interest and trepidation your observations on the probability of nuclear annihilation (apocalypse soon), and would greatly value a chance to discuss in more detail the threat of this other, slower, but equally devastating apocalypse. I would be very grateful to have your consideration on how we have come to this critical point in history. Why the powers of the world are so slow in acting to try to prevent this catastrophe and why the American government appears to be in denial about it.
