As far as I can tell, a mostly-complete scan of the Voynich Manuscript. 
Wikipedia sez: "The Voynich manuscript is a handwritten book thought to have been written in the early 15th century and comprising about 240 vellum pages, most with illustrations. Although many possible authors have been proposed, the author, script, and language remain unknown. It has been described as "the world's most mysterious manuscript"."
Enjoy.
