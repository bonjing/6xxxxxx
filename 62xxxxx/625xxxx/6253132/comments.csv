,nikolai1uno,2011-04-02T17:56Z,"Hey all, Quick Question....

I have been here for a long time grabbing whats upped, etc.  I have never really had a disc go coaster on me.

However, I can't burn this game and WWE All Stars correctly, and yet nothing has changed on my system.

The console thinks this game is a DVD

All ideas at all, o gifted multitudes??

Thanks"
