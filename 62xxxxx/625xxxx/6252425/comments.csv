I have been here for a long time grabbing whats upped, etc.  I have never really had a disc go coaster on me.

However, I can't burn this game and WWE All Stars correctly, and yet nothing has changed on my system.

All ideas at all, o gifted multitudes??

Thanks"

A question, I have LT, not LT+, will it still work?
AS I understand it since there's no ap 2.5 on this game LT will work as well as LT+, is this correcrt, or will something go wrong if I try to play this on my LT flashed xbox 360 ?

Thank you a lot in advance!!

Best regards!"
