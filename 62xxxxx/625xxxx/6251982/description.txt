This is a VHS rip of the 1986 hit movie 'Free Ride'. The quality is decent but not prefect.. It IS a VHS rip, 
but anyways a movie worth checking out.

The subs is Norwegian and im sorry to say hardcoded in the movie, but after a while you learn to ignore it,
i looked for years after this movie, and the only one i found was with hardcoded norwegian subs so there
was nothing i could do.
