As formerly_azrielle noticed before, the hard-coded craziness with the voting system is happening again - now when you vote '+' for this torrent or more recent ones the '- ' count goes up by TWO, and if you vote '-', the '-' vote goes up by THREE (sorry, I had to check)! 

This again suggests at the very least that some twisted, petty individual with access to TPB code is targeting 20-40 - why?? And why are the mods not doing something??? 

The last time we talked about this, the comments got deleted - I wonder if the same will happen again???"
,banukaknight,2011-03-20T20:06Z,it sure iss i thnk
,psipsina111,2011-03-21T20:34Z,@banukaknight  syfy original Battle of LA is an older version from syfy channel(I guess) it is not the film that is out just now.
,banukaknight,2011-03-21T20:42Z,"ya sir i noticed.

,whoopers,2011-05-28T20:41Z,"is this the science channel version or the sky one version?  just curious, if i can avoid seeing 'another guys tackle' i would enjoy it more lol"
,Fangular,2011-06-04T18:46Z,"I just discovered that you had uploaded this, 2040 - much to my absolute delight! (It's always so cool when you're searching for something in Pirate Bay.. and then your name comes up in the results!) So a belated thanks from me.. am looking forward to watching this."
