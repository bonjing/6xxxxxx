TS doesn't have to be recorded from the projection box...it just yields better results.
TS is just CAM video, with audio from the actual source (they generally grab it from outlets designed for the hearing impaired). Just an FYI. "
,orgs,2011-03-22T21:05Z,"@swissjoe ... STFU already .... You're not a genius here .... TS can come from a variety of sources, not ""just"" the projection booth. How many torrents did you copy/paste this dumb statement to ... I've read it at least 5 or 6 times. Download it and see for yourself
For the record, to those interested in this movie, this copy is far better than the others. I don't understand why it's so far down on the top 100 list. Give it a few days and this will be the most downloaded copy ..., trust me on this one people !! I've d'led 4 different copies and ran them side by side in different players ... this is the clear winner ... and Yes swissjoe, it's a TS"
