This movie is not an ordinary one.If you like the world you live in , this movie is not for you.If you are rich , this movie is not for you either.If you belong to the ruling class , this movie is not for you.If you are capitalist , this movie is not for you.

However if you want to learn something about the real life , something about the world you live in, something that you will never learn from school, colege, tv, radio, something that bothers  people on this Planet since the world exists - then this movie is for you! Watch it and think about it!

Remember one thing.There is only one way to change everything.And all starts with one simple sentence!!!


PEOPLE , UNITED WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED!!! 

PEOPLE , UNITED WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED!!! 

PEOPLE , UNITED WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED!!!
