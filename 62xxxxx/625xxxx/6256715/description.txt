Synopsis

A second-generation Sikh in London gives up his dream to save his father's reputation until he meets a girl who gives him the strength to stand up for what he believes. This cross-generation drama is about second chances.
The protagonist of the film (Akshay Kumar) runs a corner shop in Southall but his desire is to break into sports/cricket. His father is a strict traditionalist and his mission is to ensure his family do not lose their Indian culture and identity. Akshay, however wants to play cricket â€“ not for India but for England â€“ and he gets the chance to do this. Also, according to the makers of the film, cricket is just the catalyst, the real deal is father-son drama.
The film is also about British Asian identity and the cross-generational conflict between a father and son. The primary message of the film is about family ties and duty, a yearning to follow oneâ€™s dreams, and trying to make sense of the dichotomies that life presents when oneâ€™s family has migrated to another land.
