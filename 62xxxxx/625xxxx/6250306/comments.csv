If youâre like me youâve put serious cycles through your PS3,
perhaps damaging some internals,
like the Blu-ray drive for instance. My old fat, 256MB NAND PS3 suffered this loss.
Anyway, goodnews: It is now possible to (re)marry Blu-ray drive boards
to other consoles, meaning there is still
hope for your thought-to-be dead drive."
