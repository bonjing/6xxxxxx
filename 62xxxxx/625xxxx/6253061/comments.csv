[V],twentyforty,2011-03-18T20:46Z,"@shailesh417: I have seen minus few minutes after I uploaded torrent, but having five torrents before to start, I have NOT started to seed this one, as the last in line.

My comment was late, for same reasons.

That is not about quality anymore. Idiots have grudge with me and are on crusade, as they always do.

So, use what supposedly humans have inside the skull and right between the ears - and it's not mash-potatoes.

How can anyone rate something that he have not?

I have feeling that you cannot answer that because that wasn't the purpose of your asking. Why you haven't said what is really on your mind, -  like ""Keep the mouth shut twentyforty and drop your pants."" LOL"
,silveroakleaf,2011-03-19T03:53Z,"I've been downloading torrents for almost a year and really haven't noticed the +/- until a couple months ago when I started doing my own torrents.  Who cares how many minuses there are?  It's like email spam and web ads, I just tune them out.

The true measure of a torrent's quality are the number of seeds, well written reviews/comments (both positive and negative), and the overall long term reputation of the up-loader.

I say boycott the +/- system!"

Now, wait until different opinions came - then DELETE all good comments and left just the bad ones. And left ALL fucking minuses.

Then discuss on IRC how VIP status should be REMOVED for members who have low fucking rating. Offer explanation hoe RATING is BASED ON PLUS-MINUS ratio ( not simple numerical difference - @silveroakleaf)

*** Video is H264; audio is AAC LC and container is MP ..............AND SO ON................""*
You would prefer, I suppose, the blockiness that comes from low-grade 1-pass encodes?  H264 is VASTLY SUPERIOR to XVID, both in terms of smaller file size, and video quality.  AAC is likewise better sound quality than mp3 typically used with XVIV .avi's.  Again with file sizes of about 55-60% of typical equivalent XVID .avi's.  Learn SOMETHING about encoding B4 you mouth off, OKAY?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-19T11:50Z,"@azrielle: Many of my movie encodes were 3-PASS back on mininova. My old regulars know that. Now, today, I can perform 3-pass encoding and they can't - and that pretty much freaks them out.

Many of the encoders purchased more than few computers - and never even come close to my volume.

Many encodes ARE better than mine  (and I stated that here many times) BUT:

- I am fucking reliable (I cannot make ugly encode). Others can and have.

- I have 200 hundredth encodes per month, one ONE computer. Majority encode a few - and that could be done by - ANYBODY

- I started with h-dot (ancient beginnings of x264 project) and they cannot tell me something I don't know and haven't invented during all years of my experience. That freaks them out too.

- My encodes are roughly THREE times smaller than XviD counterparts - but I encode 480p and ""official"" XviDs are 352p - my frame-size is BY ONE THIRD BIGGER.

- They are stupid and I am smart. What they can do  than invent something to brag about?"

,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-19T13:53Z,"'sallright--I understood what you meant.  When I was encoding rented DVDs with Gordian Knot and XVID, I never paid any attention to a standard screen size--just picked one of the suggested [divisible by 16] sizes and used gut feeling based on how much constantly changing (and therefore more pixel-intensive encoding) action scenes there were, length of the movie, and what my ultimate file-size goal was (e.g. if I wanted aprox 700MB, and lots of action, I would pick a smaller screen size, knowing that I could zoom out VLC on the playback).  I never have seeded them as torrents (tried once with Hopscotch--a Walter Mathau flick dating back to early 70s, but couldn't get it to work), only sharing them with friends and relatives via CD/DVD burns and USB Drives."
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-20T19:44Z,Nice .. so you can actually upsize by 1/3rd .. that amusing isnt it. and have ever worked on VP62 or newer version that Codec ?

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T21:50Z,"@hakuna_matata: 1-pass, 2-pass or 3-pass encoding means ""How much times encoding program have worked on the input. Doing 1-pass encoding is bad thing - program goes through input just once - doing the actual encoding. 

In 2,3 or even more  -pass encoding, program goes through input first time just to gather statistics, to ""learn"" as much is possible  called 1st pass of nTh) - and then performs actual encoding doing 2nd pass, but using statistics from previous one. I 3-pass encoding, final pass is 3rd and two previous ones serve as ""platform"" for final encoding (result, output)."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T21:56Z,"@hakuna_matata: ... and up-size is wrong word you used. In English, your upsizing mean ""enlargement"", ""making something bigger"" and I never said that, nor nothing alike. My wording is stripped down and should be taken ""as said, literally""."
