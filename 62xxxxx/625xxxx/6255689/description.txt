Therefore no need to explain...you know what i mean.

Seed with me asap ! i need seeders guys,please !
I don't ask you seeding every time but please,few minuts,or few hours or at night.
all my torrents have a ratio of 15.0 on my computer...
I seed,share and seed and share again and again but,what about you ?
don't forget to seed a bit to help the other peers as well...
Don't be egoist !
I try my best but my connection is hardly saturated sometimes.
So please,be patient !
and again and again,give a descent upload speed from your part when torrenting
otherwise i well fear you will get nothing...
that's the game and you must play it ! that's the way...to...share with the other peoples all around the world.All peer must absolutely give a descent upload from his part.try to adjust it during downloading so.
Be more cooperative ! 
Open your eyes as well as your heart...act with tact and play the game and share rightly so. 
Ty for understanding...
Have a nice day end
