,nikrusty,2011-05-04T21:12Z,"@bjodahl and dmc for error ""X3DAudio1_7.dll is missing"". Just update to the latest Directx 11 release. There is updated version in the installed Risk Factions folder itself!"
,nikrusty,2011-05-04T21:37Z,"@gws - Thanks gws, chaning the name works perfectly :) Here is my version for those who'd like to use a free Hex Editor

1. Download this: HXD Free Hex Editor
http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/

2. Backup the Reloaded steam_api.dll

3. Open up steam_api.dll in the game folder.

4. Go to Search.

5. Look for *!RELOADED!* into the find field.

6. type in your name, notice that on the left those Hexes (random looking number) have to all filled up with something, therefore enter your name and then spaces e.g. nik and several space to fill up the place. Remember all characters should come up to 12. As *!RELOADED!* has 12 characters and you are replacing it.

7. If you've done everyhting right, save the file. If get ""File size has changed"" means your character count isn't right!"
,dmc_,2011-05-17T06:17Z,"I would just like to say that after downloading this game here and playing through singleplayer I made the decision to purchase the game off of steam for $10USD for its multiplayer content.

I'm a very happy customer! :)"
,Pid0s,2011-06-12T13:52Z,What do you mean with ``copy over the cracked content`` ?
,TurbulentCat,2011-07-23T11:43Z,"Guys wondering where the crack is, once you've mounted the disk go to my computer and open the disk. There you will find the crack. replace everything in the installed folder with everything in the cracked folder"
,SadBear,2011-08-04T23:02Z,"@pidos

Open the mounted image (not autorun). Then you'll see a folder named 'crack'. Copy the content to where you installed the game."
