The pure rich vocals of Megan Burtt are some of the best that I have ever heard in 2010! Meganâ€™s 2010 release â€œIt Ainâ€™t Loveâ€ is a pop driven album which is a collaborative in style and musicianship that supersedes some of the charting talent of today. â€œIt Ainâ€™t Loveâ€ is a break out album for Megan, as each of the 12 songs highlight her talent as a singer and songwriter, with memorable and highly evocative vocals. Megan shares her thought provoking lyrics with her luscious vocals, while you revel in the impressive guitar accompaniment losing yourself in the story.
