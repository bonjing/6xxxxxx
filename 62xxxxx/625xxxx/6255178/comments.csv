Thnx anyway (no gay:p)"
[V],Mbb15,2011-03-19T16:01Z,"Yes I agree gameplay is much more important than graphics ( and I also completely agree with your thoughts about GTA because indeed vice city and san andreas were awesome and gtaiv was not really awesome only the graphics) but the graphics in this game could have been a little nicer because this is just horrible lol, dont know if the gameplay is any good but i'll find out"
,cat_fish_1,2011-03-19T16:19Z,"@ mbb15
YOu are totaly correct!
This game is DX11 and should not look like shit as it does."

It tells me that PhysX has not been installed properly, and the game doesn't boot. I've tried three seperate times. I already have PhysX installed, of course. The game just won't recognize it."
,Dahbakon,2011-03-19T20:23Z,we'll let you know when we know
,badea19,2011-03-20T00:34Z,working perfect . thanks . use sound and ammo crack and fix after install. game sux 
,Mickaus,2011-03-20T02:03Z,"For those that have problems with it saying Physx isn't installed correctly, ensure that you have the latest version installed.  I've noticed that games that come with the Physx software have various versions bundled, sometimes newer games have older versions!

Even the Nvidia website does not have the latest version listed.  To download the latest version, google:
PhysX_9.10.0514_SystemSoftware.msi
(the Nvidia site has 9.10.0513).  Physx is kind of like the Directx updates, in that each release isn't cumulative and backwards compatible.  Thats why with Directx and Physx, you will notice multiple files which are very similar, and should in fact be part of a single file update.  I head physx is heading this way, and Directx may also do the same.  Keep in mind Physx is by design 'very' extremely unoptimised to run on CPU, and is only GPU accelerated on Nvidia.  Just hope game developers wake up to Directcompute and OpenCL."
,joonior83,2011-03-20T05:14Z,"A little tip for those of you still having Physx problems, even after trying what's already been posted.

I don't have this game yet, but I've noticed with other games that complain about no Physx I've had to find my Physx directory, which, for me is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common

copy the .dll files in there and put them in the games main directory, whatever it is.

This typically fixes any Physx issues I have with other games, and I'll bet it helps on this one too.

Reply if it works, please."
