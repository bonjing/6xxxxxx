The Black Eyed Peas debuted their new single on tonight\'s \"American Idol\" and dedicated the song to victims of the disaster in Japan.

\"This song is about love and strength and is dedicated to our friends in Japan,\" said will.i.am, as he began \"Just Can\'t Get Enough\" with Fergie, who sat atop a white piano. All members of the group were dressed in white for their rousing performance on the hit FOX music competition.

The Black Eyed Peas just released their new video for \"Just Can\'t Get Enough,\" which was filmed in Japan just a week before the earthquake/tsunami disaster.
