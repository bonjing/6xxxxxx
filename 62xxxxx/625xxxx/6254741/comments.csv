I will get the smaller file first that you posted, and if it's a good episode I'll grab this one and keep it on my PS3. This season has been weird in that there are so many episodes . Will season 4 ever end... I hope we won't have to wait to long for season 5. There has been a few duds in season 4 but overall it's been good with a few really great episodes. Still my favourite paranormal show out there. Season 2 of Ghost Lab was very good too, you done a great job with that. Sad that's off air."
