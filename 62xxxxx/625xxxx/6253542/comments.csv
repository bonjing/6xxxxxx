If you've downloaded this and are having issues with setup saying it can't find the installer, you may need to folderize this a bit after extraction.  Gather the ""MSI"" folder, ""Runtime"" folder, ""TurboTax 2010 Installer.exe"" file and ""TurboTax 2010 Installer.exe.config"" file into a folder called ""TurboTax 2010"" at the same level as the remaining 4 items.  Run setup.exe and voila."
