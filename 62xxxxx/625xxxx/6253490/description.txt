Important antivirus scan results:
*********************************
Scanned with............: Norton, avast, Avira and Kaspersky
Number of files detected: 1

Detected by Avira: Patch_x32/Patch.exe
[DETECTION] Contains HEUR/Crypted suspicious code
[NOTE]..... The detection was classified as suspicious.

Date of scan: March 18, 2011 


The detection by Avira is a false positive, caused by some used binaries 
and cryptors (or maybe the patch is also added to the virus database).

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!

So just stay cool ... or don't use this!!!


* Credits for the patch goes to: shajt

* Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! *

               Diskeeper 2011 Pro Premier 15.0.951 + Patch (x32-x64)
          


Release date Diskeeper 2011 15.0 Build 951 Final: March 03 2011


For over a decade, Diskeeper has led the way in Windows system defragmentation 
technology, and Diskeeper 2011 continues with the tradition of true "Set It and 
Forget It" performance enhancement that is a hallmark of the Diskeeper name. 
Whether you've used Diskeeper before or not, you may already be familiar with 
some of its features, but Diskeeper 2011 adds refinements to these features, 
and a number of other core enhancements.

New Diskeeper performance software 2011 will make your PC(s) faster, more 
efficient, more reliable and last longer. And use less electricity too!
Diskeeper also includes powerful defrag engines for what isn't prevented 
and runs in real-time, with zero resource conflicts. 

How??? All computers suffer from fragmentation - where files are broken up and 
scattered all across your disk drives. This makes it take longer to read, write 
and save files. Plus since your PC is working harder than it needs to, more wear 
and tear occurs. Diskeeper with new IntelliWrite fragmentation prevention resolves 
this by preventing up to 85% of all fragmentation from happening in the first 
place. Any remaining fragmentation is quickly eliminated in real time thanks to 
Diskeeperâ€™s InvisiTasking technology. 

With new Diskeeper 2011 your computers simply run better than new all the time! 
Your computers will run faster with Diskeeper 2011 installed. You'll enjoy using 
every aspect of your systemâ€”from downloading to accessing files to surfing the 
web with greater ease and efficiency. Leave hang-times, freeze-ups and other 
fragmentation-based crashes in the dust.

File fragmentation on your computer's hard drive is one of the most basic reasons 
for slows, hangs, crashes and system errors. Left alone, it will bring your 
computer to a halt. Fragmentation is continual and with the number of today's 
applications, peripherals, and file sizes, it accumulates hourly. 
No manual defragmenter will prevent this. Diskeeper 2011 is the only defragmenter 
ever built that defragments in real time without requiring a schedule. 
Your computer will run faster with Diskeeper 2011 installed - period.

Available in Diskeeper 2011, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment 
defragmentation without tapping into active system resources. 
The result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts 
in real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance. InvisiTasking 
technology offers true transparent, background processing technology allows 
Diskeeper 2011 to defragment your computer in real-time, completely eliminating 
the need for cumbersome maintenance operations. Free up gridlocked resources and 
let your computer hum along at peak performance. Diskeeper 2011 Professional 
enhances the reliability and performance of your computer-automatically! 

Diskeeper 2011 I-FAAST file optimization technology accelerates file access times 
to meet the heavy workloads of file-intensive applications. 
Utilizing a specially formulated technology, I-FAAST closely monitors file usage
and organizes the most commonly accessed files for the fastest possible access, 
boosting file access and creation to speeds above and beyond the capabilities of 
your system when it was new, up to 80% faster.  

High-power computer systems require high power-defragmentation engines. 
Only Diskeeper 2011 includes the advanced technology necessary to eliminate 
large volume fragmentation found on big and busy computers. 

The remarkable Terabyte Volume Engine (TVE) technology. TVE is the only defrag 
technology with the necessary horsepower to eliminate the rapid fragmentation 
build-up that occurs in high-traffic volumes that handles millions of files. 
TVE was initially developed for the highest capacity servers but has now also 
become essential for the high end power user. Large databases, CAD programs -
Diskeeper 2011 handles the biggest jobs fast and thoroughly. The greater the 
number of files and fragments on a volume, the more dramatic TVE's benefits 
will be. Nothing compares to TVE's ability to eliminate enterprise level 
fragmentation. In a class of its own, TVE makes real-time power computer 
defragmentation a fact.


Changes in Diskeeper 2011:
**************************
- Efficiency. New technology and advanced algorithms maximize performance 
  while eliminating disk I/O activity not conducive to improving your computing 
  experience. Maximum performance from minimal effort!
- Immediacy. With IntelliWrite continuing to prevent most fragmentation before 
  it happens, the new Instant Defrag feature of Diskeeper now rapidly eliminates 
  any fragmented data that does occur.
- Scalability. With the immediate file-by-file approach to optimization, time 
  and resource consuming whole-volume analysis and defragmentation operations 
  are rarely, if ever, needed. This revolutionary new design scales to much 
  larger volumes than traditional disk defragmentation technologies!
- Defragmentation Options. Diskeeper now defaults to an "Efficient" 
  defragmentation method to maximize efficiency and performance while
  minimizing disk I/O by intelligently determining which files, folders 
  and free space should be defragmented. This setting can be changed to 
  a more extensive defragmentation option from the Defragmentation Options 
  tab in the Configuration Properties.
- Savings. Diskeeper now tracks I/Oâ€™s saved on your system. Taking into account 
  the I/O activity of Diskeeper as well, this cumulative net figure equates to 
  less system processing overhead, disk head movement, and total power consumption 
  resulting in reduced operating costs. Now itâ€™s even easier to gauge the benefits 
  of your new investment !

RAID Arrays (hardware and software) 
Mirrored Disks 
Mounted Volumes (letter-less drives) 

Resource Requirements
The disk space requirements for Diskeeper depend on several factors. 
The Diskeeper installation package is about 60 MB. After the installation 
is complete, Diskeeper occupies about 38 MB of disk space. If Internet Explorer 
is not present on your computer, some other needed files (hhupd.exe, 50comupd.exe,
and wintdist.exe) may be added. Further, your system may require a new or updated 
version of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), which is less than 6 MB.
  

Additional Software Requirements
Diskeeper relies on the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). The MMC provides 
a single point of control for system utilities such as Diskeeper. The MMC is 
used as a central location for a variety of Microsoft and third party 
administrative tools. The MMC is included in newer Windows operating systems.
 

A Note About Firewalls
As a normal part of its operation, the Diskeeper Service (DkService.exe) acts 
as a Windows service on your system. If you are running a hardware or software
firewall, you may see messages indicating Diskeeper Service is trying to act 
as a Windows service. These messages are expected; you can safely allow these 
events. This functionality is designed to allow for support for network operations 
(e.g. Remote Control) via Diskeeper Administrator. 

You may also be notified that Diskeeper is trying to access the Internet. 
It is important to note that Diskeeper does not access the Internet (except 
when you specifically use the Check for Updates feature), but it does use 
Windows mechanisms that may trigger these alerts from your firewall. 
Again, these messages are expected and you can safely allow the events. 
If networkability or automatic update checking is not required, you can 
safely disable this.

Note:
***** 
If you're using a cracked version of Diskeeper then permanently 
block internet access for Diskeeper with e.g. a firewall.

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.

15. No Promises ... No Debts!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. Avira AntiVir Premium 
3. avast! Pro Antivirus
4. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
