,Steelwolf12,2011-04-02T19:41Z,"Killer program. Works very well on my x32 systems, but for some reason wont work on my x64 one. When i install the x64 patch it makes Diskeeper expire and all its features useless. Tried all methods stated and no success. Anyone else having this prob and know how to fix it?"

It took me 8 minutes to download the whole file, without you guys, thru normal direct download on my wireless broadband, definitely its gonna be 45 minutes. 

True superb spotless torrent and stunning great software. Voted as the best disk defragmenting/mantainance software everywhere. Shall not have a computer without one! "

,peegee23,2011-04-26T07:03Z,"after quite some time, the program notified me to register again. just rerun the patch. btw, the file is automatically quarantined by Avira. just a false positive."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-04-26T22:45Z,"@greet86 
Extract the RAR file with e.g. WinRAR:

A few scan results are mentioned in the torrent description."

,Schredas,2011-08-03T04:47Z,"Patching freezes after the ""few more seconds"" thing appears.. SUCKS."
,akarath,2011-08-07T13:33Z,Ok i used this on windows 7 64 bit works fine no problems.Just make very sure you block internet.
,1291kevz1291,2011-08-14T10:18Z,"Hi, I found a solution for those who have problem with the x64 patch. I believe it is caused by using a renamed installation path. To fix it, stop the ""Diskeeper"" service just in case, then copy all the files in C:/Program Files/Diskeeper Corporation/Diskeeper to your installed directory. After replace all the files, it should work."
,art00rz,2011-08-20T00:28Z,"thanks, it's working. And I didn't have any trouble with the x64 patch."
,rocketero,2011-09-16T01:51Z,"I works perfect, thank you very much for posting this. Patch was having a bit of problem with Avast antivirus but at the end all worked fine."
,Cursedata,2011-09-28T06:28Z,Hmmm. 32-Bit Patch seems to be a virus trendmicro 2012 picked it out as a (virus unconfirmed) if ppl say it works I wouldn't pick it out but for me I wont use it but 64-Bit Setup seems to works and as I have a 64-Bit system Thumbs-Up for 64-Bit Setup Patch

,pa1ner,2012-04-26T12:30Z,don't work piece of shit
,ironymon,2012-05-26T12:51Z,"First of all, if u can't make a patch that is free of false positives, then fuck you. It's easy to put in a real deal and label it as false positive, then people mindlessly download shit, if my av detects even false positive im erasing this immediately.  That's how you stay truly safe."
