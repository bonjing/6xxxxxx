Its been over half a year since Ellen
Alliens album Dust first saw the light of
night. And since then it has been impossible
to get away from the strangely glittering
fairy dust that graced the albums cover. On
your skin, your clothes, in your nose, and
above all, in your ears. Dust truly left its
mark. Anyone that had anything to do with
techno in 2010 couldnt avoid experiencing
Ellens most personal and without a doubt most
mature reflection of her own being, a
sparkling gem full of pop appeal and
unexpected twists and turns. And why would
they want to? It unites many facets into one
although the album, which was produced
together with Tobias Freund (whose projects
include tobias., Pink Elln, and Sieg ber
Die Sonne), is extremely diverse and
wide-ranging, it is also a coherent impression
of a singular personality. A snapshot of an
artist who was one of the first to begin
hammering Berliner Techno into stone, and
since then has worked tirelessly at molding
and shaping its perfect form. So it really
comes as no surprise that these remixes are
just as impressive as Ellens original LP
thanks to the multiple perspectives they
provide. Placing the tracks in different (yet
well-selected) hands was supposed to be a
simple experiment, but what was originally
intended to only be released digitally ended
up being so impressive that a decision was
made to turn it into the tactile experience of
a silver disc. The result is thirteen
adaptations of the material on Dust which
transition between multiple varieties of
House, Techno, Disco, and Ambient as if the
idea of different categories never existed.
Here, a rigid structure takes a backseat to
creative freedom. The artists selected for
this project come from completely different
stylistic camps, and can without a doubt be
referred to as key players in todays club
sound. The innovators. The musicians
musicians. The secret stars. This compilation
offers a total of thirteen tracks which each
present a different, individual idea of what
the word remix means. The storied art of
taking pieces of something already available
and creating something new. And the result is
definitely quite impressive. The remixes which
stand out the most are probably the incredible
cover of Flashy Flashy by Nicolas Jaar, this
seasons soul house brother, the remix of
Should We Go Home by John Roberts (debut
album entitled Glass Eights, released by
Dial, 2010), as well as the remix of Ellens
pop song You by Munk, from the Munich-based
label Gomma.
