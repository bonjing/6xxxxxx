,nerdmatt,2011-03-21T23:30Z,"you guys look 'pro', could you help me out?

i put a torrent up yesterday but i cant edit the name of it, or its description?"
,Dude72,2011-03-22T00:14Z,"Thanks! Downloading again :) 

Will help seeding when finished!"
[V],bestec1234,2011-03-22T02:13Z,"I knew TGF would come through and start seeding again.  Figured it was some connection problem on your end.  This torrent is very much well worth the wait, of course.  Thanks again!


nerdmatt: you should instead ask for help on suprbay.org.
