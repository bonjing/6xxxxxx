Mike and Dane are home after a long day of paintballing. Mike's mother Nikita is in a terrible mood. They are starving and instead of getting a nice home cooked meal, Nikita throws 2 TV dinners at them. This sets Mike off and he storms out of the house. His buddy Dane is puzzled, and wants to know whats wrong with Miss Denise. She explains about the terrible day she is having, and Dane is a great listener. He gives her a giant hug to make it all better. She is grateful that her son has a friend like Dane.......very grateful indeed.
