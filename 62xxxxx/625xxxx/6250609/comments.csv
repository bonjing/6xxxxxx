,sourav321123raktim321,2011-03-20T13:23Z,"though the size is almost ~2gb, i can not understand why, the color quality is not that sharp. I mean its kinda blurred and the color quality is not that good."

,alphaecho,2011-08-21T10:03Z,"jbwckz has a point. If you're not willing to go up to 4GB then you might as well stay down in the 1GB range with all the other rippers out there.

However if you truly want to stand out from the crowd. 4G real 720p not 544p rips will make you a legend.

Everyone has 16:9 monitors and TV screens. Take Alice in Wonderland by CBGB for example. Best copy of all time of any 4GB 720p rip of all time not to mention the fact that it's 720p not 544p."
,TaZeRz,2011-10-26T03:49Z,"alphaecho you sir are very stupid and do not understand aspect ratio in films, they will never fit your 16:9 display unless they are filmed in this ratio which most cinematic films are not."
