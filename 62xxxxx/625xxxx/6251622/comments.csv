@fearloathingandparanoia
Sorry for f***** up the subs of 'The Man From Nowhere'.
Got it from a site & it worked well on the beginning.
I know it su**s to watch a foreign movie without proper subs. 
A friend of mine fixed it somehow for my version,

,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-20T21:16Z,wow first of all... i commented on the man from nowhere torrent and idiots are replying back here. secondly.. to the people who say i dont know english and i need subs... those dumbfucks should know that the subs i needed are for a korean movie. and i got so pissed off because all your uploads have been top notch which is why this fuck-up pissed me off. and to all the other morons - i appreciate only perfection which is why i consider people like you'll worse than cockroaches. fucking idiots. first learn to stand up for urself and then for someone else. the uploader is educated enough to apologize for a fuck-up and i highly appreciate that.
