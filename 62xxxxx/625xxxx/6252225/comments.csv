,Illanair,2011-03-18T12:33Z,"@DibyaTPB: That still doesn't mean that it's the exact same crack that has already been the reason for banning/deleting torrents. Just saying. (Not that I'm complaining - I'm using it and no odd malware or anything here, aside from savegame corruption ofcourse)

@homemdafaina: Sure - Because he'd be able to see those comments when the site doesn't always update each torrent to show all posted comments... (insert caps lock rage induced rant here)"

,Illanair,2011-03-18T13:33Z,"Yeah - you didn't follow the instructions as follows.

-You need to use Phoenix 1.4 Beta 7 (Important, the latest 1.5 version skips stuff)

-Update the CDR in Phoenix

-Mount both dics on two different daemon tools drives

-Unpack the game in Phoenix and point to the second SID file when asked to. Let it unpack the whole thing.

-Double check that the Shogun folder is the size it needs to be.

-Run the cracktool, play, enjoy savegame corruption."
,wunknown,2011-03-18T13:53Z,"Nice but we need a simple version.
It's doable."
,wunknown,2011-03-18T14:01Z,"Ummmm...
I've done the same thing again.
I'm not crazy. I know how to crack/patch a game. 
I'm used to those things.

But when I doubleclick on the shortcut, it does just NOTHING. 

Then I saw on the web ""removing a file (in user directory. not in installation directory)"" it would fix my problem but no. Of course not...

If someone can fix this."

Or do you ask TPB for help what to do when the paper is out at the toilet too? Ask for permission when to get up in the morning?

although the previous ali 230+MB patch must be applied first.

I have tested it myself, although I didnât get myself to the 50th turn yet, the save/load issue has been fixed ( no need to get troops out of castle) although you have to start a new campaign completely."

,qzcvb_qzcvb,2011-04-04T15:15Z,"
Hey, thanks Dibya. There was another torrent with the same ISO but I had problems extracting that SIM file with phoenix. I think It was corrupted. 

This one works though.

Guys, you'll also need ""Total.War.Shogun.2.11gb.Patch.To.15.8gb.Unlock.Incl.crack-ali213"" to play this game. Just Google that one. Do this after you unpack the SIM file with Phoenix.

It's pretty simple to install, the instructions were just a bit brief though. 

Graphics are still kind of dark though. I downloaded the one from KAOS and realized that the issue with the sound was with the RIP itself when I tried this one from Dibya. Still I appreciate they ripped it. Now I'm seriously considering buying this game.

Thanks again DibyaTPB. "
,qzcvb_qzcvb,2011-04-04T15:25Z,"
Wait, after reading all the previous comments I'm kind of irked at the lot of you.

Listen you need this crack to make it work 
Total.War.Shogun.2.11gb.Patch.To.15.8gb.Unlock.Incl.crack-ali213

I won't bother posting a link. You need to do things for yourselves kiddies. Also the whining about Dibya losing his skull makes me want to slap you all.

I installed steam as well but it wasn't running when I played the game. 
I have no save issues but haven't gotten around to 50+ turns yet. 

This one's given to you for free and all you can do in return is nag and whine. Buy the game if you can't grasp the simplicity of installing a piece of software. All you have to do is follow instructions and click the mouse. 

Bunch of self entitled pricks. "
,FrankieFame,2011-04-16T23:07Z,"if you guys want to change the language of this game all u have to do is download the demo version of this game from steam and then go into your steam program files and exchange the local_en.pack and the local_patch_pack with the 2 of whatever language you have in your data folder, change the text in the language file to EN and trade the encyclopedia folder with the one in your steam program files for the game. Enjoy"
,mpj123,2011-06-01T08:33Z,"If anyone is wanting to change the language, an easier way is to just delete all the unwanted language packs in the data folder. Then the game has no choice but to choose english, also change the language from ES to EN in the language.txt file. (same folder)"

The Daemon Tools Lite part was easy, I did it, but I can't do the Phoenix part. Can somebody help me? I want only short instructions, with only clear words, without links. Any help is appreciated, I can't wait for someone to help me. I can't fix this game for around 4-5 days. Thanks a lot guys!"
,ariton1,2011-07-02T12:34Z,"Oh, I finally fixed the game myself.
If Phoenix 1.4 beta  or 1.5 beta 3 don't work, get the Phoenix 1.5 beta 5 from google.
It will work, because it's a new version, many bugs/things like that are fixed and it seems faster than any other versions. It won't skip nothing."

This download is old and is missing tons of stuff, including the movies. If you want the complete version with all movies and DLC's do a search for:

Total War Shogun 2 v.1.10 + 3DLC RePack by R.G.Mechanics

R.G.Mechanics is Build 4247, so I don't think you'll need to download ""Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack"" patch. Either way, you'll still need ""patch10.pack Build 4358"" & ""3DMGAME-Shogun2.v1.1.0.Build.4358.0.Crack.Fix2.Patch-3DM"".

Do another search for:
