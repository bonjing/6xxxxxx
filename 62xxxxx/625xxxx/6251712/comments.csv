,RThsA,2011-03-25T05:42Z,"Actually, the show is on hiatus right now (likely because they need more time to get through dubbing), so there won't be any new episodes for likely a month or two."
,Safetyfailure,2011-03-26T00:05Z,Nooooo!
,mini1guy,2011-03-30T13:33Z,"Hey everyone, I have a very important announcement,
apparently the guy who made the original dragon ball z kai is plagiarizing dragon ball z, now from what i read they are going to stop production of the dragon ball z kai series, ending with the Japanese episode 97, but I don't know if they will keep dubbing episodes into English or not."
,Safetyfailure,2011-04-10T00:48Z,"I'm confused. Were they trying to create a whole new story? I thought they were just redoing the show in HD, not a new story."
,klown3plus1,2011-04-11T15:39Z,are these episodes cut or the uncut versions? thanks
,nick17g,2011-04-11T20:26Z,"Dragon Ball Z Kai is just a remake of the old show but cut shorter. I believe it is for some anniversary, I am not exactly sure. I do know they are taking the old real and touching it up so the Kai series is mostly just the same old show. I do think it will end at 97 instead of 98 but that is because the earthquake in Japan that caused the studio to shut down. That may also be why the English dubbed shows have been delayed but there hasn't been any press releases so I wouldn't know for sure."
