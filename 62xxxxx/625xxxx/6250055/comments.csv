,sathikg,2011-06-08T15:28Z,nice upload..... thanks a lot......
,ramikaz,2011-08-12T12:36Z,Why would anyone download a 2 or 4 GB version when this one is available?  Thanks.
,xacebop,2011-08-15T14:22Z,agreed ramikaz... x264 is the future. super compressed mkv and mp4s make avis look like crap. compare this 420meg file to a 2cd avi release at 1.4gigs. this looks as good as if i played a dvd
