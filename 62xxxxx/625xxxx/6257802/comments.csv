,mevidek,2011-07-08T16:59Z,"How to install:
1. Download torrent using uTorrent or BitTorrent.
2. Double click on torrent once finished.
3. You will notice that the files are all '001' files or some other numbers. Double click on the first one, and click 'choose program to open with'.
4. Select your unRaring software. I use WinRar and Tugzip.
5. Now open the file that you just chose to switch to be openable with WinRar.
6. Create a folder on your desktop.
7. Select 'Extract to (your folder name) desktop'.
8. Close your unRaring software.
9. Double click on the folder on the desktop.
10. Double click on the iso. file.
11. Use your Iso software to mount (I use Virtual CloneDrive as it's free and easy to use).
12. Allow autorun.
13. Press install.
14. Let it fully install!!!

Hope I helped!! Don't forget to check out my music torrents!"

anyway, what's the diff between gold and vanilla? fixed bugs? added mods? i see stuff like 'medieval 2 total war gold' but can't find any info on just wot 'gold' means apart from it forcing me onto steam, which i dont like. only just got a pc that can run games again and everything seems to be attached to fuckin steam!!! last time i was on steam was when i bought HL2. does steam scan ur pc for tor'd games? that's my fear."
