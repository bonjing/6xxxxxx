VMware Workstation/Player (Multi-Brand) Bios Installer
Works on VMware W'Stn (v6-7.x) & Player (v3.x)[Windows]

Decription:

It works by finding vmware-vmx.exe (if present in one of the 5x locations), where Restorator 
silently patches binres 6006 entry with the selected resource file, and confirms the job is done. 
It will patch any version whether x32 or x64 bit by disregarding CRC checking. 
It's portable, nothing is actually installed to your system.

How To Use:-

1. Make sure VMware W'Stn (v6-7.x) or VM Player (v3.x) is turned off 
   (can't patch a file if it's in use).
2. Double-click the Installer and make your selection ...it will confirm done, seconds later.
3. VMware should now run with the bios file you selected.

Note:- on first use a "back-up" copy of your vmware-vmx.exe is made and confirmation of 
it's location displayed ... if for any reason you wish to return to an untouched state, you have 
the ability to just manually overwrite vmware-vmx.exe in your Program Files with your untouched 
back-up copy.

USB Boot (USB_Boot.iso allows booting from USB Stick)

The VMWare virtual machine's BIOS does not offer the option to boot from USB.

There is a workaround:-

* Download the plpbt-x.x.x.zip file and unzip it.
* Boot your virtual machine on plpbtnoemul.iso or plpbt.iso

* Choose USB with up/down arrows and press ENTER.
* Before you press ENTER, remember to "connect" your USB drive to the virtual machine:

Note that: This trick doesn't work under VirtualBox.
