1) make sure your xbox is flashed with the latest iextreme lt+ firmware
2) download a program called abgx
3) while in abgx go to the autofix tab, set to level 3
4)open the disc image file of whatever game you have downloaded in abgx
5) wait for the game to be stealth patched etc and wait till it has finished. you will be prompted to press any key to exit.
6)go back to the folder containing the games files and now click the and open the  image file.
7)it should automatically open in the program imgburn (im assuming you have this? if not then download imgburn!)
8)put a blank dldvd in you drive hopefully a verbatim disc.
9) hit the burn button and wait for the game to burn........hey presto! a fully functioning new game.

8)put a blank dldvd in you drive hopefully a verbatim disc.
9) hit the burn button and wait for the game to burn........hey presto! a fully functioning new game.
10) MOST IMPORTANTLY! after all steps are complete, raise you middle finger high in the air and shout FUCK YOU MICROSOFT!!!!!!

enjoy ;) "

,manrock111,2011-04-07T16:59Z,"@littledo i did what u said and its still not working....
any idea?"
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-07T19:46Z,"Hey, thanks!

A question, I have LT, not LT+, will it still work?
AS I understand it since there's no ap 2.5 on this game LT will work as well as LT+, is this correcrt, or will something go wrong if I try to play this on my LT flashed xbox 360 ?

Thank you a lot in advance!!

Best regards!"
,littledoo,2011-04-07T20:31Z,as long as its not ap2.5 you should be ok
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-08T03:02Z,"Okej thank you!

And btw I have not the kinect dashboard, must I get it to be able to play this game? (If it is on the cd's of this game or dragon age 2 or dead space 2, which all I have but not yet played) ?

And if I do install it, my flash LT will not be affected right, so that something like I can no longer play older games would happen?

Thank you very much in advance for the answer, really need to know this, so I can start play this games, cant get a confirmation on either way from when I google it, so please if you know let med now, thank you!

Best regards!"
,littledoo,2011-04-12T23:42Z,"couldnt really say, im sure if you did the update from a game disc it wouldnt affect you. i can only speak from my experience, i have had no problems. i updated from a dragon age 2 game disc and have had no problems with older or new games. i guess it comes down to wich firmware u have. im using iextreme lt+"
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-16T03:01Z,"As I understood it lt+ is only required if the game does have ap 2.5, and since this just as dragon age 2 does not have that, lt+ should not be needed?
So in that aspect, updating to kinect/newest from one of these cd's, wont affect the firmware lt (not+), and affect the possibility to play older games (too), right?

Thank you very much in advance!
(Do not want to fuck it up so I cant play anything if I update the xbox to kinect/newest, want to be sure, nothing will happen)
Thanks!"
