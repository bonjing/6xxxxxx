i just made an account just to thank you !  "
,Busoap,2011-03-19T23:23Z,"ThĂŠ only problem i have is that the mouse doesn't run smoothly when there are no guards 

Maybe its because of my Macbook but i doubt it :)"
,Poeticile,2011-03-20T02:35Z,"Hey thanks, hope you like it. :)"
,baudelaire_anywhere,2011-03-22T18:29Z,"hey! I have the following problem: after the 2 pre-title credits of the delevopers etc. I get a black screen, with some ambient music (normally backing the menu I suppose). I tried with several screen resolutions in the pre-game menu, same result. has anybody any suggestions what might cause this, or rather how to fix it? 
in any case many thanks to Poeticile for efforts and generosity!"
,baudelaire_anywhere,2011-03-22T18:32Z,"I'm running a macbook OS 10.5; 4 GB RAM, 2,2GHz.

on the black screen there's no reaction to any keys, save the power button, with which I always have to force a shutdown/restart.

Great game, excellent port. Thanks!

Does anyone else have this problem and better yet does anyone know how to fix it... Thanks :-)"
