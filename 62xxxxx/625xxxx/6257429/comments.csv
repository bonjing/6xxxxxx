,asaiza2000,2011-03-22T19:46Z,"@swissjoe, please shut up about the same question you've been posting on EVERY torrent. I mean thanks for the looking out man.. but I think people get it."
,Riptyed,2011-03-23T16:31Z,@swissjoe do you not have a life?!!? STFU!! every torrent I've looked at has the same question. if your looking for attention go somewhere else.
,clonies,2011-03-24T19:38Z,"As you can see in the screens, the quality is awful. Better save your bandwithd and wait for the DVD version."
,stlctan,2011-03-24T19:43Z,I'll wait
,superkop,2011-03-24T20:42Z,"@swissjoe . . . You need to shut up because what you are saying isn't true. Telesync has NOTHING to do with the quality of video. Telesync means that the audio was recorded using an external audio source. IE, plugging sound directly into recorder before going to speakers. R5 is DVD quality. Cam and TS are recorded visually the same way. Yeah, one may be in the booth, another in the seats. But that doesn't have anything to do with those little letters people put next to their posts. Do research please? Because you look new to the game"
,blues6988,2011-03-29T07:51Z,lol thank you superkop
,welshlegend21,2011-03-29T21:12Z,A4 V4 not bad :D
,ijacker,2011-03-30T03:06Z,"@qwersd 

I followed the link to the forums, but didn't realize it was a referral link. I think I went around it by clicking the ""register"" link at the top.

Anywho, how do I get my own referrer url code?"
,iamhelix,2011-04-03T10:41Z,"who gives a fuck about TS vs cam and shit, you guys need to get a life you keep fucking the comments of every torrent wqith bullshit!"
,shewolf415,2011-04-05T01:32Z,Swissjoe you are an idiot. You must have nothing to do all day. You post the same stupid shit on every torrent. You try to sound smart and you just come across as being a moron
,cja844,2011-04-06T20:14Z,I do not think this is watchable.  this is not a TS or it is a bad one.  this looks like a bad cam.  a/2 v/3.  A lot of popping and cracking in sound.
,SecretAgentMan23,2011-04-08T06:55Z,i smell a stinker....

,grei_eba,2011-05-11T03:23Z,"I don't know about the Audio, but as soon as I saw the video, I erased it. Gotta keep waiting for a better one.."
,ndarlington,2011-05-13T01:44Z,"I always watch cams, you get used to it after a while, but the video here is beyond awful.  The worst blur comes in about 10 minutes in.

Unwatchable.

Thanks anyway."
