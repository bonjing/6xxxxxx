A:9, V:8.
I haven't watched the movie yet, Just scanned through to see how the quality was."
,scottsasse,2011-03-25T05:55Z,"""swissjoe"" and ""db110688"" STOP leaving the SAME trolling comments on all the torrents that are or claim to be a TS!!! You two should just hook up in a hotel or chat room and make sweet love!!! .......................Anyhoo, A=7, V=8, M=7 and THANKS to all you past, present and future seeders + uploaders out there!! Love, DrScott"

A:8 (it did have pretty good sound)
V:7.5 (this is not a 9 or 10 video quality)
overall its still a decent upload thanks crazy-torrent."
