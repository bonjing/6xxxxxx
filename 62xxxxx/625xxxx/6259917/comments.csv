and please do not come with questions like :

Why does it have 16 MB instead of 22 MB like the original ?
 cause I'll hate to have to answer to you:
- It does not contain the google tollbar and browser defender installer as the original !  "

,boondall,2011-04-14T06:55Z,"NIS '11 deletes file as soon as i d'load it. Giving messages of major virus. I know about false positives and disabling anti-viruses before downloading etc etc, but damn, first time its done that. usually i am prompted. any ideas ??"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-04-16T11:30Z,"some AV ceased to limit their fight against infections and extended it to antipiracy...
people should limit also the use of such abusive products...

this is like american policy...first they come to rescue the rebels, release the citizens from tirany, they say...but once got there... they kill the rebels, make colateral damage and secure oil only...

if you have doubts, extract the content and make a simple rar archive to deliver it to virus total site... you will see for yourself it is clean

get a nonabusive AV
condemn the damn Norton Shit Invasive 11 till they renounce to that kind of job"

Am impresia ca esti roman, ai cumva windows 7 ultimate activat, ca toate torentele ce le-am testat devin nongenuine dupa kb...133, sau instalarea lui microsoft security essential."

I am glad others were able to ""Activate"". Maybe they got activated before the serials were ""Black Listed""?

I tried all of the serials you provided:

If I allow the program to server check to activate, it fails: ""Invalid Serial"".

If I block internet access, it fails becuz it can not access server."
