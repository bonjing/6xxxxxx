Sorry I'm a bit new. Help is much appreciated! "
,guatemario,2011-04-30T17:11Z,"This is how I installed:

1) Download (sorry if too mamy details) the torrent.
2) Unzip.
3) Unrar.
4) Disconnect from the Internet (in the event that the application wants to ""phone home"" during the installation).
5) Install
6) At the end of the installation uncheck the option to run the software.
7) Copy the lxtitdrp6520310.exe file and paste it in the same where you installed the application is installed.  The file path may look like this:
C:\Program Files\ImTOO\DVD Ripper Platinum 6
8) After pasting the exe file, run it (double click on it).
9) Click on the ""Patch"" button.
10) Now run the application.
11) In the menu bar click ""Help""
12) Select ""Enter Code...""
13) Enter whatever name you want.  ""XXXX"" would work.
14) Enter a 40 digit number.  ""12345-67890-12345-67890-12345-67890-12345-67890"" would work.
ENJOY!"

15) On the Menu bar, Click on Tools, then Preferences.
16) Uncheck the option ""Check for Updates Automaticall"""".  I did this to be safe.   I do not know if you can get updates.  Someone else may want to advise.

17) Hook back to the Internet!"
