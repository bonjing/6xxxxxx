some one seed for god sake........with high speed.
seed ..............plz"
,lcoming,2011-04-08T21:20Z,If you like the videos so much then you have to pay for it. For someone who teaches so well....He needs to be paid for it. (personal opinion though). Give 200 USD or so wont be a bad idea for all this. Imagine how much you pay for med school and those teachers come to read power point slides for you..........I am not preaching or anything but I really think this guy should be paid for what he does. cheers!

,motpa,2011-04-12T16:55Z,"and im downloading it from here not because i dont want to pay but because i am sick and tired of my countries messed up internet connection...

,SHERIFA,2011-04-12T19:43Z,"So far 750 GBs Uploaded to all leechers. UP speed is 500-650 kB/s, but my connection (and Internet) is 1G, I've achieved speeds up to 84 MB/s (megabytes, NOT megabits!) per second, so it's NOT my fault for low speeds (I don't seed any other torrents these days!), it's about YOUR connection ! Increase 'em buying from your ISP bigger net-package. I'm payin' $37 for 1G (1024 Mbit/s!) speeds, no problems."

PLEASE SEEEED.... 
thanx for ur interest"
,SHERIFA,2011-06-07T12:54Z,"Guys - Sharing is the Point ! When you download the torrent, leave it to be seeded and do NOT quit the torrent client ! 24/7/365 seeding is the Point."
,PH.AHMED,2011-06-09T23:12Z,"hey people PLZ SEEEED
i've noticed that most people limit their UPLOAD speed while keeping their download speed unlimited.... thus limit the seeding ability.....
why this such selfish ACTION...???!!!!!!!!
it won't harm u to keep every people downoalding from u..... even if u r 1% or reaching 100%
i've uploaded about 60 GB till now... and i'm happy for that.... HELPING each other is not a sin....but limit this help is the absolute SIN especially when it's only will cast u just to unlimit ur upload speed and keep ur torrent ACTIVE ......  
thus facilitate much SPEED availability & rate for all ....."

,aekae47,2012-01-23T09:19Z,"There are two torrents for these videos,

1. Uploaded by ""SHERIFA"" (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6253759/Dr._Najeeb_Video_Lectures__ULTRA_COLLECTION)
Size: 89.76 GB

2. Uploaded by ""junoon"" (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6920323/Dr._Najeeb_Medical_Video_Lectures)
Size: 95.69 GB

I've seen the contents of these videos and found that the one by ""junoon"" has a few videos repeated that's why it's size is bigger. Many videos in Histology folder are repeated in other folders too and there is one video called Heme Metabolism which is not by Dr. Najeeb at all. This torrent has only one seeder presently so you won't be able to download it properly.

The torrent by ""SHERIFA"" has good number of seeds and doesn't have these repeated videos so it would be better if you download that one (sorry to say that, ""junoon"")

Type IV Hypersensitivity Part 2 in Immunology folder is missing in both torrents. WBC Parts 1,2 and 3 are missing in Immunology but are present in Histology in SHERIFA's torrent whereas they are repeated in Immunology and Histology in junoon's torrent"

Right-click on the link ""get this torrent"" and select copy adreslink (or something like that). Then open uTorrent and click on the ""magnet"". Insert the link you've just copied and you're good to go!"
,phospho,2012-04-18T12:41Z,"there's a consistent lag in the videos. I've only seen the 2 repro cycle ones, but honestly, if all the videos are like that, then it's a big deal for me. I don't think I've ever gotten a headache this bad just by watching a video. Also, for the people trying to download, I have been keeping my PC on 24/7, and I have a very high speed connection. Hopefully that's been helping at least a little bit."
