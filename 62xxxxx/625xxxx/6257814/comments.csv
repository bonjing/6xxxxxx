Kosovo is Serbia, it was paid for in Serb blood, and one day Serbia will take it back."

SERBIANS WERE PROTECTING A LAND THAT IS OWNED BY THEM! IF MUSLIMS WERE WALKING AROUND IN ANY TOWN OR CITY OF USA, AND IF THEY STARTED TO TELL YOU THAT THIS TOWN IS OURS NOW BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING HERE NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? YOU DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW MANY SERBIANS VILLAGES AND TOWNS AND PEOPLE DESTROYED BY MUSLIMS BECAUSE YO UARE JUST BUYING WHAT IS SOLD TO YOUR MIND ON TV! JUST ASK THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE IN THE TIME OF WAR, DON'T COME TO ME WITH WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD ON TV!"

And about wars, i think you should leave them behind and look to the future. Serbia has an amazing young crowd, well educated and international, and i'm sure in one or two generations it will become a great place well known all over the world."
