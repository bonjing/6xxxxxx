Films that have been terrorism with the elements of love have always been fantasized us for years and one such movie is Anwar starring Prithviraj, Mamta Mohandas, Prakash Raj and Geetha

Rating: 2.25/5

Who's who in the movie :

Anwar : Prithviraj
Stalin Manimaran : Prakash Raj
Babu Sait : Lal
Basheer Bhai : Sampath

The opening scene of the movie screens with a bomb blast in Coimbatore. Babu Sait, who is suspected for the reason for the bomb blast is arrested by special investigation officer Stalin Manimaran (Prakash Raj). 

On the other hand Anwar is arrested for handling Hawala money and this is where Anwar gets the company of Babu Sait and his members. With no time Anwar becomes Babu's trusted man and the right hand. Babu Sait helps Anwar to get his bail after Anwar becoming his trusted guy. In the mean time Anwar is very much attracted towards Babu. Anwar, after getting released from the prison, heads to bomb the police headquarters. This activity of him is noticed by Basheer Bhai (Sampath) who is the gang leader as well the leader of Babu.

After this particular incident, Basheer Bhai makes Anwar, a leader for another dangerous series of bomb blasts. Anwar executes all the plans but one incident in his life haunts him and does not allow him to do the laid plans. 

The rest of the movie is said with twists and turns. The remaining is the story . 

Performances:

Prithviraj's performance is extremely outstanding in the role of Anwar. The role of Anwar reminds Mammootty and Mohanlal. Mamtha Mohan Das could have delivered a good performance. 

Prakash Raj, as usual he has done a great job in the movie. Sampath, Lal and the rest of the supporting cast performed well on their boundaries.

Director Amal Neerad has tried to make the movie a great hit but has succeeded to an extent. Music by Gopi Sundar is entertaining but most of the time, too much of noises are found irritating.

Watch it only for Prithviraj
