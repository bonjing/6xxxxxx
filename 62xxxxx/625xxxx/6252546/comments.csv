[T],-inspiron-,2011-03-18T12:24Z,"and by the way , great work , just saw your uploads , thanks :)"
,mcs88,2011-03-18T13:22Z,I think 1 track is missing from this release. CD2 Track 10 should be Armin van Buuren - Take A Moment (Alex M.O.R.P.H. Remix). CD2 has 15 tracks according to Discogs and beatport.
[T],FatFreddy62,2011-03-18T13:41Z,anytime dude ... only here to share what i have ... i prefer listening to the continuous mix ... thats the point of a DJ right?? can u upload it or should I ? i hate it when there's 10 torrents on the same subject ?? dont u?
[T],-inspiron-,2011-03-18T15:27Z,"@mcs88 : This pack is released by ""Napith Music"" version. In ""Napith Music"" version didn't have track no#10 on CD2

@yooz2714 : yes me too , i prefer the mixed version, and sure , i will upload it too :)"
[T],-inspiron-,2011-03-18T18:13Z,"HEY GUYS , this is the full versions,    JUST UPLOADED THE MIXED VERSION SPLIT TRACKS , cheers "
,qazwsxijn,2011-03-19T04:25Z,"the FUCK? this isn't ""mixed by armin van buuren"". do you know what ""mixed"" means? this torrent is just a series of unmixed tracks that happen to have the same sequence as asot2k11

this has NOTHING to do with armin, please label your torrents correctly next time... dumbass"
[T],-inspiron-,2011-03-19T10:11Z,"@qazwsxijn : heeyy!! idiot, do you know how to read!!!! check the comment above urs!! and it's the name of the album, and could't change it after made the tag by mistake and uploaded the mixed version, so next time, don't download if ur gonna act like a child and go cry to someone else"
