As formerly_azrielle noticed before, the hard-coded craziness with the voting system is happening again - now when you vote '+' for this torrent or more recent ones the '- ' count goes up by TWO, and if you vote '-', the '-' vote goes up by THREE (sorry, I had to check)! 

This again suggests at the very least that some twisted, petty individual with access to TPB code is targeting 20-40 - why?? And why are the mods not doing something??? 

The last time we talked about this, the comments got deleted - I wonder if the same will happen again???"
,Ataractic,2011-03-20T18:14Z,"I checked it too (sorry, but I logged in again twice and clicked + to make up for it), but the - gets incremented only once. Looks like they're tinkering with the code.

and thanks for the upload."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-20T19:14Z,"Literary few minutes after I posted that Quote (few times, deliberately, on different threads), bot was - removed. Silly idiots."
,dark_defender,2011-03-20T19:54Z,This is fucking outrageous. Damn the idiots.
,believenu,2011-03-20T20:31Z,I hit a + symbol and it came up +1 and -2 at the same time something definatly screwy but as with all your torrents all +++ quality so lets the normal persons who can read ignore numbers and d/l as per usual.Seeding is sharing.
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-20T23:34Z,"@bktheman: It always has been regular TV show in my TV schedule. Do Search on page top *name*+h264 and you'll get the torrents and see if anything is alive. From September last year I packed shows daily and probably only way for you is to get that episodes  someplace else.
Heroes were encoded too. Show was very good in Season One - but I wasn't on TPB back then, get the season pack somewhere else too (I don't have it)."
,guitarblues14,2011-03-21T18:18Z,Thanks for White Collar mate. I really appreciate you reseeding it (: 
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T18:43Z,"I found source for ep. 9 and encoded fresh one, in Mar.20 pack."
,guitarblues14,2011-03-21T22:35Z,"I did DL it & now I'm seeding it for anyone who might want it. Thanks again for taking the time out to reseed it. 

@bktheman : I haven't watched it yet but I've seen the torrent on some other users account, its RiddlerA if I'm not mistaken, you can check it out there if you so please."
