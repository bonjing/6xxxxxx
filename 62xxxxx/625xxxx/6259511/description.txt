A collection of songs from musicians around the world
all completely written and recorded in one day - 19 March 2011.

After the resounding success of Album In A Day volume 1, 
we quickly decided that we would have to try this again some time. 
So earlier this year, we invited musicians from around the world 
to each write and record a completely new song, from scratch on 19 March 2011. 

All the songs would be collected together the next day 
and released as a free download and bit torrent on Monday 21 March 2011. 

The response has been phenomenal! 27 songs from musicians all over the world and a wide range of styles as you might expect from BFW recordings - ambient, indie, electronic, experimental and much more.
