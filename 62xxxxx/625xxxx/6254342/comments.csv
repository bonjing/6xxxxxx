My download haven't started yet but judging from the song list this one issurely up there among the very best. Thank you for having such great taste in music and sharing it with us wannabe electroheads :)"

Largex: I really donÂ´t know what to answer to such praise of my humble compilations...so I simply say thank you and promise to try and introduce new stuff in the future also."
