NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Limitless 2011

Here we go we a half decent TS of this release.The video isn't the strongest but is more than watchable
unless you only want really high Q.
The video source had issues with the normal stuff,colouring,brightness etc....so we made a script to fix it the
best we could.
Audio was sweet .....just needed to be synced,but was a pain to do,but go there in the end.
Now the video has a to chunks of video missing but only 1x 4 secs and 1 x3 secs so not much .....however we also
removed 2mins 26secs off the start due to no audio (long story ) .....we were going to leave it with the russian audio
but didn't see much point as 99% of us wouldn't have a clue what was being said.....
But in all honestly you would never guess it was missing becasuse of the way it starts ......trust me,still worth the look.

Enjoy folks
