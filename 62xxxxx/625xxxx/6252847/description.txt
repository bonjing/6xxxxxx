This is Alternity, an out-of-print science fiction RPG, produced by TSR in its last days before it was bought out by Wizards of the Coast. Wizards canceled the Alternity line when it decided to roll out the d20 system. Although Alternity is primarily geared towards space opera (and has two settings to support such play--Star Drive and StarCraft), it can support other subgenres of SF, such as post-apocalyptic (Gamma World), conspiracy a la X-Files (Dark Matter) and parallel Worlds (Tangents).
