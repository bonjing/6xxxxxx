,LordTruce,2011-03-22T21:44Z,"I seem to have a problem running the application.  It tells me that a file called ""d3dx9_38.dll"" is missing from my computer.  Has anyone else had this issue?"
,Madxy13,2011-03-30T01:08Z,"Hi, I'm new. How do I install this game? Or where do I put the folder after I unzipped the rar? I'm used to just doing this with isos."
,TyMod,2011-04-01T22:06Z,Direct Plays mean all you have to do is extract it to where you want and BAM.  All done.  You can play the game from where you extract it.

,AznPenguino,2011-05-25T07:50Z,"Hey TyMod, do you need to have a CD/DVD-ROM Drive to play this? Cause I tried opening and it says I need one."
,AznPenguino,2011-05-25T08:31Z,"Actually, ignore previous comment. But whenever I try to extract it to my desktop screen, it says I need a CD drive to open it. Is there any way to play this Dead Space without constantly having to extract from WinRAR and wait 10 minutes to play?"
,TyMod,2011-05-28T00:37Z,I have never heard of this issue.  Try re-cracking it by downloading the latest crack from Gamecopyworld.com
,9Rain,2011-06-13T07:46Z,"Hey a so u need to do a direct play of halo 2 and deadspace 2 :) because that would be awsomesauce!!! So big fan

And to the dude above me: I HOPE YOU DO THE SAME."
,Pezomi,2011-09-28T23:51Z,"Thanks Tymod, 6.13 GB is nice compared to some other games. I'll be sure to seed. I feel good seeding games over 20GB."
,Pezomi,2011-09-29T00:39Z,"nvm, after looking at your downloads, I've changed my mind. Your kinda all over the place"
,TyMod,2011-09-29T12:53Z,"lol yeah, I havn't done a game in awhile because they take awhile to seed and with school I don't have the time to seed games forever.  But I do have about 20GB of games uploaded so please do seed :)

Glad you like the compressions too."
,Pezomi,2011-10-02T07:39Z,"Downloaded, and have been playing it. A couple of things...

1. No Viruses
2. Is as advertised, direct play, works perfect.
3. Scary as shit, HIGHLY Recommended.
4. Don't forget to seed, seed like this:

http://i1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc429/Pezomi/seeded2.png

It helps others and it's not like it requires anything special, just leave your computer on for a night.
5. Great upload TyMod, and my thanks."
,TyMod,2011-10-02T18:48Z,NP.   This torrent needs some seeds.
,TyMod,2011-11-24T18:24Z,"Please keep seeding people.  It needs some seeds!!!

If you like it than seed and but it later lol"
,lembird94,2011-12-05T08:45Z,hey TyMod. I have a request to make of you. I have searched every torrent website around and i cannot find a torrent for Fable 2 for pc. Do you suppose you could maybe make one? 
,TyMod,2011-12-06T22:10Z,"@lembird94
Fable 2 was not released on PC :( Only the first and third one. Sorry mate. You will have to buy it for the Xbox 360 and if you don't have a Xbox 360 then you will have to buy that too. lol

It wasn't all that great though man so you arn't missing anything. "
,samcooldude1430,2011-12-08T11:06Z,Hi TyMod Please upload Mass effect 2.....
,lembird94,2011-12-12T01:10Z,i did not know that. thanks TyMod. :)
,TyMod,2011-12-12T02:36Z,"your welcome bro.  Trust me man, if they had it on the pc I would upload it for you."
,lembird94,2011-12-12T06:10Z,"The original gears of war was released for pc, no? is there a possibility of you uploading that? I loved that game...before my xbox melted for the 3rd time... :/"
,TyMod,2011-12-13T03:54Z,lol I thought about it.  I will even give a tutorial on how to activate it. I will upload it in a little while.  Just be on the look out.
,TyMod,2011-12-13T04:48Z,Actually.  Due to time and the fact I got other things to do first thing tomorrow (when I can basically) I will up it.  I will include a tutorial on how to get a free games for windows live key for the game so you guys can play online.
,lembird94,2011-12-14T03:13Z,"TyMod, you are the man. :)"
,TyMod,2011-12-14T03:58Z,lol I know man.  I will make sure to give you a shoutout.
,TyMod,2011-12-14T04:37Z,"Dude,  Depending on how long it takes to compress gears, IDK if I will be able to get it up tonight.  I need to compress the game and to make sure the file size is minimal (I'm aiming to get it on a DVD5 disc), it is going to take a bit and then I need to compile and compress the disc file.  I finished the autorun and all the other stuff and I ripped the unimportant stuff (other language stuff) so all that is left is the compression.  To make sure I give the best possible upload I can I will need all night to do the compression.  Sorry man. I SWEAR IT WILL BE UPPED TOMMOROW.  It is 100% updated and precracked so all you have to do is install it and then it will work online :) with the use of a key (I will provide a tutorial on how.)  sorry but when it is upped tomorrow I will make sure to add in a special extra bonus. :)"
,lembird94,2011-12-20T23:45Z,"dude, theres no need to rush. :) just take all the time you need to make it a kickass torrent just like all the other ones. "
,TyMod,2011-12-21T03:53Z,"Well I am.  I got WAY behind.  I got the rest of the week off though so I am going to do it tonight.  Uploaded a Beyonce torrent to hold ppl over though so if you like Beyonce, download her new album.  Otherwise get ready to be mind fucked lol"
,takashi8525,2011-12-21T17:41Z,"hey dude,i know you probably have alot of requests but you wouldnt mind making a fable 3 for windows 7 64 bit would you?"
,TyMod,2011-12-21T19:07Z,NP I got all week (Until Christmas) to do stuff.  I will up the Gears torrent today. (The packing just finished.) and then I will download and repack Fable 3 for you.
,TyMod,2011-12-21T21:17Z,The packaging of Gears went smooth so now I am installing it.  As soon as it finishes and I test the game to make sure it runs smooth I will up it immediatly.
,TyMod,2011-12-21T23:18Z,GEARS TORRENT IS UP NOW! ENJOY!
,takashi8525,2011-12-23T17:40Z,"great work on this,i'm seeding :D"
,takashi8525,2011-12-23T17:45Z,"dude nevermind fable 3,unless other peopple want it dont stop if you have already started,but do you think you could do skyrim?"
,TyMod,2011-12-24T15:15Z,I was looking into Skyrim.  It will have to be a while.  This week I will be out of town and unable to upload stuff or help.   I will repack it and check it while I am out of town so when I get back home I will be able to upload it immediatly.  
,takashi8525,2011-12-24T18:15Z,"dude dont do that while your out of town unless you want to,enjoy your break bro take all the time you need on it,dont rush it"
,TyMod,2011-12-24T21:05Z,Trust me I won't.  But a week with the fam is bad enough lol.  I'm sure I will have time.
,takashi8525,2011-12-25T13:59Z,"haha like i said,if you dont want to dont do it,i'm downloading fable 3 thats why i said not to do it unless other people have emailed you asking for it,but i'm gonna stop seeding this about at 100 GB,i'm already at 6.94 GB"
,TyMod,2011-12-25T17:41Z,Alrighty. Thanks man.  I got skyrim in like an hour so you could problebly just get Razors release real easy and quick.
,takashi8525,2011-12-26T15:48Z,where did you get it at? i googled it and i only got the skidrow games website and the pirate bay lol
,takashi8525,2011-12-26T20:48Z,"hey bro,i finally found razors crack and with the razor 1911 installer but it had a missing dll in the file so it wont work"
,TyMod,2011-12-27T04:09Z,"I downloaded it from here but mine failed too lol.  Razor sucks these days.  When I was installing it the installer quit working.  Just download the black box release, I think its 3 to 4 gigs or get skidies.  They are all on the bay too.

AND SEED THE DAMN GAME."
,takashi8525,2011-12-27T16:17Z,"black box or skidrows release works?wow last time i used skidrow it crashed my pc,i'm scared to use it again i might use black box lol and that tells me no  one is seeding skyrim,you'd think being its a recent release it would have a good amount of seeders lol i think i might put up crysis 2 here soon"
,takashi8525,2011-12-27T16:31Z,"lol never mind dude,i forgot how to upload a torrent..."
,rollercat,2012-03-06T02:47Z,So I downloaded it and I think I've done everything right so far. However I'm at a point where it's asking for a code. What do I do there?
,TyMod,2012-03-09T01:59Z,Well.  You can always grad an EA keygen from ChattChitto but it shouldn't ask for a key since it is completely cracked.  I havn't had anyone else say something about that happen either so idk what to tell you.
