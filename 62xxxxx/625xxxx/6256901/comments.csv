So whoever kept hitting the minus button was just an idiot spammer with an axe to grind (or something along those lines). I knew from past experience that mkvGOD is very aptly named and I was therefore not about to be dissuaded from downloading these episodes.. but am just writing this to let anyone who isn't familiar with mkvGOD know that the quality of these files is fantastic.

So thank you, mkvGOD! I look forward to checking this show out."
