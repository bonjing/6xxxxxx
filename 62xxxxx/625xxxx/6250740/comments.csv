Also: Chrome is still the better browser when it comes to rendering images (GIFs in particular). I have both firefox 4 beta, and minefield (firefox64), and can safely say that Chrome has no problem's with gif boards (it increments gif frame's at the same time), whereas firefox struggles (renders  all new gif frame's on the page first before moving onto the next --slow!)

Chrome can't handle more than 15 tabs on linux though without getting unstable and causing slowdown, whereas Firefox can. But who has 15 pages open at the same time anyway?"
