PROPER NOTES


Where to begin.....DASH/AVS720/OEM1080 must think we are
all stupid using their fake injet made proofs. From their
m2ts sample you can see their source is Region A, same as
ours, which means discs should look the same or atleast
similiar. As you can see from our pic proof that we
included they are no where near the same. Their disc even
has pixelation as if it was taken from the encoded video.
They have had many Questionable proofs since the new rules
have taken effect... We feel enough is enough, as it is
just being disrespectful to all hard working x264 groups
out there. So here is a REAL RETAiL Rip for those that care
about quality,the old spirit of the scene and fair competition.
