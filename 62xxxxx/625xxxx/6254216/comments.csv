[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-19T12:37Z,Well those screens definitely look better than the old ones.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-19T22:47Z,i watched bits and pieces of the 1080p and i dont think its really worth downloading again if you had CHD's copy.  you might be able to see differences if you looked really hard.
[V],BOZX,2011-03-20T05:15Z,well i think this 720p is much better thn other rips...
,lorduspungus,2011-03-20T07:19Z,"hey BOZX. U uploaded Vikings.Collection.4DiSC.SE.PAL.DVDR-BBDvDR. i have been stuck on 99,5 for weeks now...could u....prehaps?=) "
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-21T14:39Z,this one is indeed much better.
,abhikrit,2011-03-26T07:10Z,thanks buddy :)
,cmunguiag,2011-04-04T20:16Z,Can't download the torrent file.
,john depp,2011-04-09T05:39Z,Try magnet link if it doesn't work
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-05-18T03:05Z,"I'd advise people not to download this version.

The fie/folder checks through as clean by Kaspersky Internet Security 2011, but I found that merely highlighting the 'Black Swan' folder caused Windows Explorer to crash without fail almost (when I say almost, I mean 99%) every time I clicked on it. What's more, I had a difficult time removing the file/folder from my PC precisely because of this problem.

It was the *only* file on my PC to cause the temporary crash either when I highlighted the folder, or attempted to open the file. So I guess the file is suspect, though as I say Kaspersky checked it out as clean, and 99% of the time it is right on the money.

I've downloaded this one and found is works perfectly: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6221294/Black.Swan.2010.BluRay.720p.DTS.x264-CHD"
