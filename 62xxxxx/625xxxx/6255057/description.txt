    Jamie's Dream School approaches its midpoint, but is all   
    the good work being undermined by persistent              
    indiscipline in the classroom?                           
                                                              
    Two new teachers join the staff room. Maths and finance    
    guru Alvin Hall came from an under-privileged             
    background in the American South but has built a         
    successful business and TV career, while                  
    environmentalist Jane Poynter has worked on the            
    International Space Station.                              
                                                             
    Hall is shocked by the mayhem and lack of punctuality     
    from the Dream School kids. But, having laid down the      
    law, he starts to inspire the kids by using money as a    
    metaphor to make scary fractions and algebra a little    
    more relevant.                                            
                                                               
    Nana Kwame, who left school with no GCSEs, turns out to   
    be a whizz at maths, under the firm hand of his          
    American tutor. And the magic of money maths also works   
    for business-minded but similarly under-qualified          
    Jourdelle, who impresses Alvin with his dedication and    
    ability.                                                 
                                                              
    Dream School headmaster John D'Abbro requests the          
    support of his two toughest-talking teachers - David      
    Starkey and Alvin Hall - for an emergency assembly to    
    address discipline at the school. But there are           
    unexpected consequences when pupil Harlem launches a       
    verbal attack on the headmaster and has to be sent home   
    When she returns to school with her mother to sort       
    things out with Jamie, and watch footage of her           
    outburst, it's a sobering moment for parent and child.     
                                                              
    Jayne Poynter wants to move science out of the           
    classroom. The scientist lived in a biosphere for two     
    years, and wants four of the kids to live in their own     
    biosphere for three days to understand how eco-systems    
    work. But can they monitor oxygen levels, while          
    ignoring encouragement from the other pupils to leave     
    for a cigarette?                                           
    And David Starkey's roller-coaster history course         
    continues. Deciding that a noisy classroom of 20 is no   
    way to engage students with his high-flying ideas, he     
    tries Cambridge University-style one-on-one tutorials      
    with a selected group, including Dream School's           
    ubiquitous new academic high-flyer, Danielle.
