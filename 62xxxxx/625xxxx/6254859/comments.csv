,punk67,2011-03-19T22:24Z,thanks for fringe mate !!will the joker thats put 31-ratings please fuck off you cock do you really think 2040 doesnt know its you?all you have to do is read all the positive feedback in the comments to realise that its the same sad little coward thats been doing it for months !!why dont you put your toys back in yer pram and fuck off somewhere else you pathetic little turd??!!!
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-19T22:54Z,"Thanks punk67. We all know - but new guys are repelled by seeing gazillion of minuses on all my torrents. They react to what they see and go someplace else.

However, funny, but illustrative and sad thing in the same time is - that these guys come from the countries which have been reason why I started to encode extremely small sizes. Funny is because Aussies and Kiwis, who have same shitty connections, are for years good people, vivid supporters and never forget to say Thanks. Same as Canadians, people from Ireland, and USA (if we exclude their ""supremacy"" in Hit&Runs).

I don't like generalizations, but it must be some cultural-civilizational missing link."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-19T22:57Z,that these guys = haters and minuses
,abj642,2011-03-20T00:26Z,"@20-40

""these guys come from the countries which have been reason why I started to encode extremely small sizes""

i completely agree with you.I reiterate that, the people from my country are a disgrace in P2P. i think nothing can change them."
