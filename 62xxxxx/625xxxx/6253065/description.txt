Knight Riderz
Mind Riddims (2011)


Canada based duo known as Knight Riderz are producing lazer bass bombs in a 12 dimensional world of twisted low frequency induced hip-hop. Releases forthcoming and already out on ESL, Muti Music, True Movement, Seclusiasis, Made In Glitch, Formation UK, and remixes for Thunderball, Freestylers, South Rakkas, Kush Arora, Love & Light, and King Fantastic illustrate only a small fraction of what is in store from the Riderz. Their original work with MC's Zulu and Juakali define their style with lazer like buzz saw synth work surrounding a thunderous vocal vibe or beautifully intricate melody. Fully equipped with a deadly live performance Knight Riderz are bangin bassbins world wide in 2011.
