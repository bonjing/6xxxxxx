I still don't know why they don't do it! You are paying for inferior quality :("
,jimclip,2011-03-21T00:12Z,"I know, it kills me that people pay as much or almost as much as the CD would cost to get 256k AACs (which are probably better than 320k MP3, even if the LAME encoder is used, but still aren't lossless !!!) and little or no artwork and nothing to hold or have as a backup. Apple developed the ALAC lossless encoder, so if they won't use FLAC at least give us an ALAC option !!! Oh well..."
