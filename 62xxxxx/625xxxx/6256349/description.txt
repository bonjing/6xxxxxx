* NOTE: The iTunes release does not include the full setlist played that evening. The omitted songs are Ashes, Hopeless and a truly outstanding performance of the Rufus & Chaka Khan hit Ain't Nobody, which KT covers regularly and even released as a B-side on the Saving My Face vinyl single. The live version of Ain't Nobody from this show IMO is one of her best performances of the song; I'd encourage you to check it out, there are at least two versions of it on YouTube, albeit not in the same quality as this produced release. It's too bad it wasn't included on the iTunes releaseâ€¦maybe it had to do with royalty issues?

iTunes also released this show in video format, but I haven't gotten it yet, so I'm not sure if any of the excluded audio tracks are present in the video version (doubtful).

Since this is an iTunes exclusive release, unfortunately there is no lossless version available.

Enjoy, and please seed !
