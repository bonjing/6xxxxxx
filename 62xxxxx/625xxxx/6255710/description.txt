Dreams have long fascinated mankind. The possibility of a person entering the dream of another has never been attempted before.
 
Now, a university dream research clinic is exploring â€œdreamlinkingâ€, a method by which conscious people can insert themselves into othersâ€™ dreams. The research director Dr. Paul Novotny (Max Von Sydow) recruits washed-up psychic Alex Gardner (Dennis Quaid) for his experiments, and Alex proves a natural for dream manipulation. But even though the doctor overseeing the research has only the best intentions, someone else believes that dreamlinking can be the ultimate weaponâ€¦ and heâ€™s determined to recruit Alex for his own evil ends.


The film also stars veteran actor Christopher Plummer and actress Kate Capshaw.
