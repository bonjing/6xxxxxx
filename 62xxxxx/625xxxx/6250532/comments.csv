Since i didn't have the registration key for my version on 1 click dvd copy pro, i couldn't update. so you saved me! thank you again

Everything worked smoothly! this is not the same as a ""crack"" the patch works with the original .exe rather than replacing it."

but this omg first time no hesitation copied it np played it back no bad sectors at all just like new

you just need to download dvd43 for32bit or dvd43 plugin for 64 bit which i have because it does not have its own decryptor but thats a little thing compared to what it can do it can actually copy your scratched or bad sector dvds no problem at all perfect quality

THANK YOU :)"
