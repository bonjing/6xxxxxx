Originating in a rural area that cares little; and has a minimalistic way of supporting the arts of any form one group of seven young men have managed to break free from the grip of regional conformity and do exactly what they want, the way they have always wanted to do it. Forming from the ashes of numerous West Aussie bands (Christina Rose, Next To Nothing, The Color Theft) As Islands Divide are an entity comprised of individuals with a common goal. To play music they love, to people who enjoy it as much as they thrive on playing it.
