In this sequel to the hit comedy, Ben Stiller returns as hapless museum night watchman Larry Daley, who must help 
his living, breathing exhibit friends out of a pickle now that they've been transferred to the archives at the Smithsonian 
Institution. Larry's (mis)adventures this time include close encounters with Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams), Abe 
Lincoln (Hank Azaria) and Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest). Owen Wilson and Robin Williams co-star.
