After years of Downloading, i thought it was time i uploaded a torrent of my own.
I haven't found this band on any major torrent sites, so i thought i'd be the first to expose them on this platform.

This is the debut album, Feel Life's Fear, minus one track i seem to have lost, but plus an extra track that wasn't recorded for the album, "classical metal".

A metal band from the Central Coast of Australia, one of the best in my opinion.
Enjoy.
