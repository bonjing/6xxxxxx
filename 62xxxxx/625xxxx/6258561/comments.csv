,tybomb,2011-03-21T22:53Z,"What was the newest episode before this one? Apparently this one is either episode 13 or 14 (still trying to figure that out).  There's a damn episode 21 on here somewhere. 
  The numbering system for this show is absolutely f&ck#d.   Not to mention piratebay's search function turns up completely differen't results from one search to the next.  I'll search for family guy and then arrange by upload date and find nothing uploaded in weeks, then hit search again and suddenly there's 5 new episodes uploaded over the last few days.

  This show is almost not worth the effort!

PLEASE"
,AndroidLove,2011-03-23T07:35Z,"@ dncc:
Try ""ConvertX to DVD"" - works 100% for me all the time and very simple and easy to use interface.

That's the official website - don't think I need to tell you what to do to find 'alternate' versions :)"
,orchlon,2011-03-23T15:12Z,This is Episode 14 if you count the christmas one as 2 episodes
,sketos,2011-03-23T15:32Z,"Thnkz eztv,but still, dont mess up the episode numbers.
This is 13,it was posted even on wikipedia.
Dont fool yourselves with comments about the double episode."
,thedonlk,2011-03-25T01:03Z,"eztv, u r the best man..."
,heisenberg737,2011-03-27T06:54Z,"this is episode 14 IF you consider road to the north pole as 2 episodes which it isn't
there have been numerous double-length episodes before, all of them were counted as 1 episode, so there's no sense whatsoever in skipping episode 8 and subsequently fucking up the numbering for like two thirds of the season."
,systemsmoke,2011-03-27T15:31Z,"Wikipedia, eh? Must be accurate then!"
,systemsmoke,2011-03-27T15:42Z,LOL Not sure I care what you number the episodes as long as I can find em.. Cheers EZTV!
,cuzkelly,2011-03-30T15:05Z,"people don't want to download the same episode twice, so please get the episode numbers correct?"
,frienlyfire78mm,2011-04-03T00:07Z,This is episode 13 both wiki and hulu both say it.
,hugh-jass,2011-04-06T23:01Z,jesus who gives a fuck u know wat episode ur geting after the first poster said its not 14 its 13 so stop bein a whiny lil bitch and enjoy the fuckin thing!
,wroth91,2011-04-08T22:53Z,"@ hugh-jass:
ya damn right >..< stupid fail people, just be glad the damn thing is here and stop bitching -..-' stop flooding torrent comments with useless posts"
,KaVaLaRhS,2011-04-10T22:29Z,"Officially,this is episode 13."
,Screamokid,2011-04-11T05:02Z,"""Wikipedia, eh? Must be accurate then!"" - systemsmoke

I sense a little bit of ignorance here. Wikipedia is a non-profit organisation which allows it's users to publish their own pages. This means that it may not be 100% accurate but the pages are checked by staff who will post up a banner that comments on the information provided. There is also a sources list at the bottom of the page providing the research proof. There unfortunately isn't any for Season 9 but the proof is in the fact that there were two single double episodes (excuse the fact in normal circumstances this wouldn't make sense), meaning in theory, this would be episode 15, yes? So if if it's episode 14, you're counting one double episode is a double episode and one double episode as two single episodes meaning your logic must be off...

I've now downloaded this episode and will watch it, thank you for your time and thankyou eztv for uploading."
