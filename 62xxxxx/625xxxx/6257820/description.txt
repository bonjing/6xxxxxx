Both Doctor Who 2011 Comic Relief specials joined together as a single AVI.
Converted from this torrent which consisted of 2 mpeg files:

Video: XviD 704 x 400
Audio: CBR 120kb/s MP3

Definitely better quality than the torrent consisting of two wmv files.
A higher resolution and somewhat sharper picture than the TvTeam AVI version.

For those who prefer anamorphic MKV, I'll convert the mpeg files again and upload them as a new torrent shortly.
