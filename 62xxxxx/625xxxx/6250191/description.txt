                 The Beast Of The Yellow Night 1971 DVDRIP
                 -----------------------------------------

The most underrated horror film sees the light of day. This gem of a horror film has been bomb-shelled by critics. But for what reason? I have seen this film start to finish and I must say that director Eddie Romero makes use of the little resources he has to make a thought-provoking horror film that deals with many topics: re-incarnation, redemption and the very essence of evil. The first thing I noticed about the film was the beautiful and photography used by the director which gives and ethnic perspective to the movie and he script and dialogue captivated me throughout. The ending climax is very well done. Do not expect over-the-top special effects, but rather a chilling tale that will leave you thinking about the film long after you see it. 

Plot:
-----
Satan saves Joseph Langdon/Philip Rogers (John Ashley) from death on condition he become his disciple. As it turns out, he becomes a hairy murderous beast: a werewolf on the rampage carrying out the evil deeds of the devil.
