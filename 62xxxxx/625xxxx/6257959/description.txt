This is the Complete Sharpe collection, all 24 of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe Stories (21 books and three short stories). Most of these books have multiple versions allowing the listener the option to choose their favorite narrator (Whether it is William Gaminara, Fredrick Davidson or Alistair Maydon). 

This torrent is different from the previous version I had uploaded. This torrent offers more variety of readers and several versions of books not found elsewhere (such as William Gaminara's reading of "Sharpe's Waterloo") .

As far as I know this is THE ONLY COMPLETE SHARPE COLLECTION offered on the Internet, so I hope you will enjoy it.... :D


This is a very large torrent with 52 books (counting the different versions of each story) so please help seed it.
