Podolinsky's style is not at all didactic or 'lecture hall' instruction. With attractive personal style, he taught me the difference between stating a wish or dream, and WRITING clear goals -- goals that I'll use to measure my progress & build my successes. I'm squirming because of his insistence that I include rewards & punishments as one way of keeping myself motivated. But even I - a person raised in a guilt-powered family - can embrace discipline the way Podolinsky outlines it. In our company, we've already employed his lessons, and they've been warmly received & acted upon. 

I'm receiving reports of "hey, this works!" and "you mean I'm allowed to schedule a life for myself?!" [Yes, folks, finding a balance between personal & professional goals is a whole chapter in this tiny book.] What a gem "Go for Your Goals" turned out to be!............
