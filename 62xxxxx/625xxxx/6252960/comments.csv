,ragman420,2011-03-19T08:08Z,"I've been using this ever since Windows 7 came out as an unmanaged client, but haven't been able to find a serial for the management console.  Is there one in this torrent?"
,ragman420,2011-03-19T08:19Z,"I should clarify my previous comment.  This doesn't need a serial when used as an unmanaged client and it's a terrific upload, but if you want to install the management console which allows you to control the settings on other computers on your network it asks for a product serial number and I haven't been able to find one anywhere."
,nambi,2011-03-21T14:19Z,Use ep11 as the managed server and ep12 on the clients.
,ragman420,2011-03-28T13:55Z,EP 11 isn't compatible with windows 7 just vista and XP.  I've tried.  Windows 7 requires EP 12.
,nambi,2011-03-30T22:34Z,in a server client environment with win 2003 servers you can use ep11 on the 2003 it will manage the ep12 clients.
