,CrAcKeZ,2011-03-21T00:17Z,"I hope its for Windows CE..else its 1.94GB of waste for me. Anyway thanks joe-blow but try putting a comment regarding this for example:

Windows CE
IGO Primo v9.xxxx
etc.. thanks again for the upload"
,CrAcKeZ,2011-03-21T20:29Z,"So to help this out, as I can confirm this is:

---------
IGO Primo 1.1
Version: 9.2.1.178658
Feb 9 2011
---------

and the Igo primo version is under NGG, NavGear Germany. Thoughts? well with the EXACT same maps its VERY VERY inaccurate compared to my original gps version iGO 8.3.4.117940. Also when I started IGO Primo it complain that I have little memory(I have 64mb in my gps) so it used some microsd momory, anyway that wasn't the problem. My iGO 8.3 is just much more accurate with same maps/pois."
,CrAcKeZ,2011-03-21T20:29Z,oh and its Windows CE version for sure :}
,CrAcKeZ,2011-03-21T20:36Z,"damn I wrote a comment and it didn't posted succefully, anyway this version is Windows CE version and it has the following info I can confirm:

-------
iGO Primo 1.1
version: 9.2.1.178658
Feb 9 2011
-------

and its under the brand of NNG, Nav Gear Germany. Btw my iGO v8.3.4.117940 is WAY more accurate to this iGO Primo, don't know why. I like the iGO Primo interface..looks more modern but its inaccurate compared to the 8.3 so.. I'll stick to 8.3"
