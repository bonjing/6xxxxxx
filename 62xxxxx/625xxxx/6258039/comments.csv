,UnidH4x0r,2011-03-22T02:19Z,how dare the screenshots not work?!!
,orgs,2011-03-22T20:53Z,FYI ... scroll down a bit. The copy by Feel Free is by far the best one out there. I've checked them all ... the focus is consistent and it's not as dark as the others. Audio is decent on all of them. just do it and thank me later  lol ... No offense to the uploader at all ... Thanks everyone for your hard work and sharing !!
,orgs,2011-03-22T20:56Z,@swissjoe ... again ... Download it and see for yourself ... the audio is good. What's with the copy/paste bullshit ... on about 10 different torrents. You must just like to hear yourself talk ... WTF ??
