In this off-kilter comedy, a woman comes to terms with her husband's strange secret: a compulsive desire to cut off his arms.

The film tells the story of John, a man who suffers from a psychological condition known as Body Integrity Identity Disorder in which an individual paradoxically doesn't feel "whole" unless he loses one or more major limbs. When John leaves his wife and goes to find a doctor willing to amputate his arms, it triggers a twisted romp filled with mistaken identities, missed chances, and tragic consequences. The film is a dark comedy that explores the ways in which a culture with so much wealth can come to fetishize suffering. But at its heart, Armless is a fable about acceptance, a meditation on trust, love and marriage.
