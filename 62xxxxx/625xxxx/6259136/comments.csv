,scalpar,2011-08-05T21:19Z,putting it all in 1 file and then cue sheet? you suck. really. i was looking forward to listening to it with winamp or ipod but now have to dl again since it's less work than splitting your crap.
,josh0223,2011-10-26T01:00Z,"How is flac more convenient? The only time I use music is on an MP3 player, most of which do not support flac. The quality difference is insignificant and and not worth it"
,mccriswell,2011-10-28T22:56Z,this is just one track.  not very user friendly
,f_2_o,2011-11-23T17:55Z,if u don't know how to convert a single flac file into mp3 tracks and if u think there is no difference between mp3s and flacs then u idiots should not download this fine release.. what a bunch of idiots!

If I just ignore that fact for a moment: torrent is excellent quality!"
