AGHHH! Thank you anyway, it was Goebbels last (and fruitless)  effort to make ordinary Germans die fighting for their damned nazi regime. No such luck, krauts may be fanatics when they are brainwashed, but not stupid, so they surrendered .... and lived."

completed your nazi films ? so you have all 1.049 of them?? wow"
,sarsapil,2011-03-20T04:34Z,"PLEASE. SEED YOUR MUCHHAUSEN FILM, I started to download it and now it has slowed down a lot... OK, I admit I may not have them all but I have about 78 of the most well known and also all the wartime and before surviving Wochenschau and Tonwoche, about 100 Gigabytes of such films. I was looking for Kolberg to download it from internet and it was NOWHERE available until recently, there was in fact a torrent but without seeders for years. Thank you."

The problem has now been corrected with a new torrent available here:  [url]http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6258780[/url].  Seeders are very welcome and appreciated; the file and folder names have not been changed.  You can delete this torrent from your client and add the new one to continue your download and to seed.

sarsapil:  Re Munchhausen, send me a PM at SuprBay (CaptButlerII); there is a problem but also a solution, I believe.  Re Kolberg, I believe I know the torrent you mention; it was for an AVI file with French subs."
