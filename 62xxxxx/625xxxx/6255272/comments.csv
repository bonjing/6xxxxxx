,pterion,2011-03-19T18:00Z,3.41 thank you....
,skeever,2011-03-29T15:11Z,"Couldn't get it to unrar, said the filename was too big"
,Daveanorn,2011-03-30T17:05Z,"I got the same error, said something about 260 words...

I looked it up and I found out is a configuration from winrar. You just have to shorten the winrar file names or extract it on your C: drive. (Root).

Bottom line, the directory the pc as to access cannot have more than 260 words."
,GokkRedfist,2011-03-31T21:15Z,Works great on 3.55 Kmeaw. Thanks for the upload!
,Ps3pirate,2011-04-03T07:08Z,open it with winrar and then extract the folder inside to someplace like your desktop... instead of extracting it using right click... that way you skip the 260 word limit in the filename
,Blood-Wiper,2011-04-14T02:31Z,Please how do you jailbreak 3.55 and run games that you download? 
,ROKKERO,2011-04-26T06:11Z,"i had trouble opening this file using winrar. so i tryed z7 and it works fine! 
bood wiper. you need a ps3 with firmware 3.55 or lower! if you have 3.56 and up, forget it and get another ps3! i have a ps3 with firmware 3.41 and it works great! to mod your ps3, it's very easy!! you can find all the info you need here on the internernet. use your search engine. good luck "
,p2preller,2011-05-05T20:12Z,"Damn PS3is good. Anyway, anyone knows if the rumours about the 2nd update? http://kissiebilder.2u.se/ use translator if needed. Is it true?????????? Cant be..????? Hope not. And will PS3 ban everyone? Sad day....."
,darkalex1,2011-05-31T13:07Z,thanks seeding now
,gers03,2011-06-05T12:10Z,"Thanks for the Upload, However I cant make it work with the fix you provided. I am running 3.55 Multiman and if I copy the PS3_Game folder over to the main directory, overwrite all the files, the size of the game reduces to 300 or so Meg. I have replaced the main eboot and replaced all the eboots in each TR game. It loads up and allows me to select a game and then I get a black screen. Pls Help!!!"
,fulanus,2011-06-14T20:45Z,"All OK here. Kmeow355, Rogero. I have to use the included fix. Thanks. Seeding now"
,rickiii,2011-06-23T18:19Z,"Works perfectly with 3.55 kmeaw Multiman, although winRAR couldn't do handle the name well so had to use 7z to get it to work properly."
,vgvgvg7412,2011-07-01T11:07Z,Thanks a lot. Works Great. Love Lara :)
,piratas34,2011-07-15T12:26Z,Black screen after selecting game and i did everything that said in manual
,Fuqthegovt,2011-08-10T15:57Z,"@gers03 You are supposed to copy/paste the files from the fix, not the folders, and keep the same file paths for each. If you copy/paste entire folders it deletes any original files not in the new folder, as you found out. This works fine with kmeaw/3.55 if done the right way. Not complaining, but wondering why the fix isn't applied before making a torrent of it to make it noob proof."
,popeysson,2011-08-21T14:52Z,"for those who have problems with winrar, use 7z to extract the archives, works flawlessly
but i got the black screen when i select a game (used the patch provided, copied the files folders by folders) still, doesn't work, black screen, will try a copy on internal HDD"
,hairyshit,2011-09-09T21:36Z,select+x in multiman is all thats needed if you get a black screen during game selection menu.
,villita5,2011-10-04T04:00Z,"I need Help... I can enter to main game, but when I choose a game the screen becomes black and I can't access... what I have to do??? Somebody can send me the files which I have to replace... plz"
