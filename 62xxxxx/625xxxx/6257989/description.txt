Here is ALL the music Strauss composed for the Viennese public for over 50 years!! This torrent contains all 51 CDs of the now out-of print Strauss Edition. 

As many of you may already have some of this music, I have presented each volume separately in the torrent so you can pick and choose if you do not want to DL the whole thing. A file named "Index Booklet" indicates which works are on which volumes for your reference. The producers of this Edition only provided one or two well-known pieces on each CD so that Strauss-lovers would have to buy more volumes to get their favorites!!

There are, sadly, no scans, but I was able to find some track info for some of the volumes from another site. If anybody knows where more track listings can be obtained, please leave a comment.

Notice to Mac Users: The original uploader made the liner notes available through the Get Info (command-I) box. Just GETINFO on each file to get a nice description of each work. There is also cover art embedded as an icon for each file.

Notice to Windows Users: I was unable to access this info using File Properties (comments). Perhaps some Windows guru will be able to enlighten me with a comment. In consolation, about 60% of the volumes contain a pdf file with the liner notes. Sorry I couldn't get them all.

I hope most of you DL the whole torrent. You will then have the 478 tracks of some of the happiest music ever written!.
