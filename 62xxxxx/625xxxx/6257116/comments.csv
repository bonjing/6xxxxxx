,Drikkedunk,2011-04-30T13:38Z,"I'm also missing ""d3dx9_43.dll""

And I did check this thread for relevant solutions.

Thing is, when i Run Dxdiag, and check which Direct X I'm running, it says Version 11, which is currently the newest one?

Any solutions to my prob? 
Thanks."
,Drikkedunk,2011-05-01T21:40Z,"@ Shahzaib.

Didn't work for me, sadly. :/ 

Still claims that it's missing. Any other suggestions? :)"
,Drikkedunk,2011-05-03T13:50Z,"@ Shahzaib.

Nope. And I doubt that I'd know how to.

Should i try to install, from your link? :)"
