Band Members: Scott Thomas & Balthazar Getty


This is one of those albums that Amazon said I might like if I liked Cake, Barenaked Ladies, Dave Matthews Band, etc.  And they were actually right!   Actor Balthazar Getty (geez, he's from a rich famous family, he can act, he's cute AND he can sing!  Some people just have all the luck HAHAHA!) and Scott Thomas form this indie band from California.
