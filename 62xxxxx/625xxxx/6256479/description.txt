           Replay the events of the first hot war of the Cold War era, the
           Korean War, also known as the Forgotten War.
           Players will be involved in two campaigns, both set in the 1950's:
           the North Korean (June 25 - August 20) and the American (September
           15 - October 8).
           In this title tactical engagement experts can test their skills
           on a new strategic level. Move your forces over the entire Korean
           Peninsula, managing reserves, as well as the fuel and ammo supplies.
           Tactical battles in Theatre of War 3: Korea are generated based on
           the strategic situation.
