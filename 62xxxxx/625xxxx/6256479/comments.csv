It crashes to desktop when you try to start a tactical battle or any kind of mission. Worthless."
,Oracle1990,2011-03-23T11:36Z,"You can try to get another crack, try www.gamecopyworld.com, I uses that and the game is working nice. (I had the same problem that it was crashing to the desktop; In the help screen that poped up I removed ""show on startup"" and clicked on show next. After I done that, the game has been working without problem.)"

,Zmalski,2011-03-29T06:31Z,Can anyone help with a constant CTD whenever an attempt to start a campaign or any mission is made?
,Filion91,2011-03-30T02:24Z,"works well with me, as for the serial, just close the dialog box when you are prompted to type it and copy the content of the crack folder into the main directory of the game

+10 honor points for the uploader"
,xmadx55x,2011-05-19T23:19Z,"crashing to the desktop? well, simple, run as administrator and it will work :) working on win7,

,CakeMonster,2011-06-05T01:06Z,"@liam5557 

Explore the iso and copy and replace the crack exe file over the installed one and of course when you run the game do so as admin by right clicking the file"
,CakeMonster,2011-06-05T01:16Z,"@liam5557

Copy EVERYTHING from the craked folder inside the iso into you install folder

access the iso by mounting the iso and then in my computer opening it by right clicking the ""dvd"" and select open but not ""run"""
,guy5253,2011-09-03T07:42Z,i need a cd key please
