Comments :
Mark and David are best friends, photo journalists going from war to war. 
In the spring of 1988, they're in Kurdistan, at an isolated mountain clinic, 
waiting for an offensive. David's had enough - he wants to go home to Dublin 
to his pregnant wife. He leaves, with Mark promising to follow in a few days. 
A week or so later, Mark's home after being wounded, but David's not been 
heard from. Mark's slow recovery and uncharacteristic behavior alarm his 
girlfriend, Elena, who asks her grandfather, a Spanish psychologist, to come 
to Dublin to help. Are there things the carefree and detached journalist is 
bottling up? Is he a casualty of war?
