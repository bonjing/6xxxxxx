Cuba is undergoing major economic change. The government is cutting back on subsidies like ration cards, and planning to lay off more than a million people. Instead, people can now set up businesses for the first time. 

Small shops and services are sprouting up as private businesses within the socialist economy and farmers now cultivate formerly weed-infested state land, with roadside stands selling directly to the public. Not exactly a free market economy on a big scale but least preliminary steps towards reform.                            Michael Voss reports.
