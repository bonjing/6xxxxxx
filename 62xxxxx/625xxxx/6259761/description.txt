If you are a fan of Oumou Sangare, then this is a must-have torrent.

This album was originally only released on cassette in Mali, and has never been available internationally, despite being a fantastic album.

These FLAC files were ripped from a CD re-release, purchased from a vendor in Bamako. There wasn't any information on the remastering in the CD, but it was an official release from Sangare's own label, so I assume the CD release was sourced from the original master tapes.
