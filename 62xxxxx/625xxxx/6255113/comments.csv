Wow STFU already ... what did you do copy/paste on every torrent that claimed TS ... This is like the 5th time I had to read your stupid shit today !! ....and for what? ... to show us how smart you think you are ?? TS is just line audio ... it can be had from numerous sources ... not just the projection booth. TS on this site ... basically means it's better than hand cam audio .... What ?? ... did you just find out what TS meant and felt like you had to share your new found knowledge. Just download the fucking thing and see if the audio is suitable for you"

So what do you mean if the budget was 150million dollars and they made well according to you and also all the opening weekend and Gross its still doesnt add up to over 150million dollars. So what do you mean"
