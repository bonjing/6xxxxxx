From out of nowhere came Little Sam Davis with this sterling set, making it clear that at least a few blues harpists of post-war vintage are still roaming around out there, just waiting to be rediscovered. Backed by a sharp rhythm section, Davis shows that he's been keeping his ear to the ground over the decades. His harp mastery and enthusiastic vocals are equally arresting.
