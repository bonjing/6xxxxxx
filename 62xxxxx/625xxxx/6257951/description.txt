____________________________________________

This is a decent collection for fans looking to acquire Glenn's biggest hits. 

Songs like The Heat Is On, You Belong to the City, Smuggler's Blues, The One You Love 
and True Love - all classic '80s tunes that you've probably heard countless times before 
- are all present and accounted for. 

The Top 20 hit Sexy Girl is also here. Plus Solo Collection has the fantastic album track 
I've Got Mine, a moody, synth-laden gem which as noted, sounds like it could have been 
Part 2 of You Belong to the City.
