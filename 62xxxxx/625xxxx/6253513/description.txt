The Coal Porters qualify as non-American alt country only on a technicality of residency. Though based for most of their 18 years of existence in London, they originally formed in Los Angeles as a vehicle for former Long Ryder â€” and American â€” Sid Griffin. 2008's Turn the Water On, Boy! is one of the most accomplished collections in the Coal Porters' hefty discography, an invigorating revisiting of Griffin's bluegrass roots. Though sufficiently orthodox to satisfy the most adamantine of purists, the Coal Porters nevertheless manage to stir a faint essence of London into the mix â€” "Final Wild Son" would have fit neatly into the Pogues' catalogue. Griffin's reverence for his spiritual ancestors is demonstrated with a stately version of Gene Clark's "Silver Raven" â€” and their requited admiration for him is proved by the willingness of former Byrd Chris Hillman to lend his mandolin to "Mr Guthrie." ~ Andrew Mueller
