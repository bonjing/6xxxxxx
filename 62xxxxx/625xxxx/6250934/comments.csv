i can't understand by read me"
,bisops,2011-03-21T10:41Z,thanx u for this torrent
,CodaBrink,2011-03-22T16:23Z,"@bisops you click InstallMod.exe

How the mod works, is you have to research ""loom"" in the town center, underneath ""loom"" is a technology called ""Yeomen"" that will increase your population limit by 100, research it again, it will increase your population limit by 200, and if you research it one last time, it will increase your population limit by 500, leaving you with the capability to have 1,000 units. It makes for some crazy battles if your computer can handle it."

,CodaBrink,2011-05-02T03:15Z,@krood That's very strange that you're experiencing that. I've never had that happen before. Let me look into it.

,kisung,2011-08-06T01:56Z,"I can't find the ""Yeomen"" in my town center. Is that because my game is not updated or because I extracted the filegame to play with 7zip to play?? Please help me"
,CodaBrink,2011-08-25T14:56Z,"kisung - That's because you didn't use the official installation method to install the game. The registry entries showing the location of the game were never made, so the installers don't know where to point the files. Just manually point the installers to the root directory of the game when installing."
