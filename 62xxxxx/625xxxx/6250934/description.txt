In order to use these files you first must:

1. Have to have both Age of Kings and The Conquerors installed using the installers off of the CD\'s.
2. Have the latest updates installed for both Age of Kings and The Conquerors installed. (Version 1.0c for The Conquerors)

Or if you don\'t have exactly that, like say you copied the AoEII folder from a friend and didn\'t install it,
and you think you\'re smart, you can extract the files using 7zip, and put them where you think they belong.

NOTES:

If the installers don\'t automatically detect where your AoEII installtion is at, that means that an entry that should be in your registry, isn\'t in your registry.
Not all is lost though, you can always try pointing the installers to the root of your AoEII game directory.

In order for the population mod to work in multiplayer, everyone must have the mod installed. If everyone doesn\'t have it installed,
you will just end up with \"Out of sync\" errors 30 minutes or so into the game with everyone else mad at you. (Don\'t do that.)

The color fix installer is just a batch script that kills explorer.exe and starts the game. I don\'t know why, but it fixes it, and
it\'s the only way I know how. If you have Windows XP or earlier, don\'t bother installing this, it wont do you any good.
