  In 2000, the Creative Assembly re-invented the strategy genre with  Shogun:
  Total War, an  unprecedented blend of  3D real-time battles  and turn-based
  management game and the first  offering in the multi-award winning  series.
  With over 7  million units sold  and universal acclaim  from the press  and
  community, Total War has consistently been at the cutting edge of the genre
  and is today one of the most successful PC franchises of all time.

  In 2011, the makers of Rome  and Empire: Total War will release  the sequel
  to the game that  started it all. Shogun  2: Total War will  take long-time
  veterans and newcomers alike  to the next level  of strategy gaming on  PC.
  Based  on 10  years of  experience in  making Total  War, Shogun  2 is  the
  perfection  of  the  series  with  a  new  Artificial  Intelligence   (AI),
  revolutionary multiplayer modes, brand new campaign map options and epic 3D
  real-time battles.

  It is the middle of the  16th century in Medieval Japan. The  country, once
  ruled by a unified  government, is now split  into many warring clans.  The
  player takes on  the role of  one Daimyo  - the clan leader -  and will use
  military engagements, economics and diplomacy to achieve the ultimate goal:
  re-unite Japan under his  supreme command and become  the new Shogun  - the
  undisputed ruler of Japan.

  Set during the golden age of  Samurai warfare, Shogun 2 brings to  life the
  most turbulent period of Japanese history.
