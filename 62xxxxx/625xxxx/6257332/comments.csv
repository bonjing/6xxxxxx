Thanks uploader!

@dncc AVI's should run perfectly fine if burned to a disk. You shouldn't convert them if you can help it as you'll lose quality.

You should have a go at using other software to see if you find any differences.

Wish I could help more, I'm not particularly experienced as most my movies go straight to an external hard disk."

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a snob,
I enjoy stupid and unambitious films, especially when stoned, but this is way too much. The Last Airbender is like Casablanca compared to this shit. In my stupidity I forgot to check IMDB page, because I thought ""It's a movie about dragons, it has to be fun, right?"" WRONG, fucking WRONG.  It's my second comment on this site and I've seen dozens of shitty movies from here, that's how bad it is. It's so boring you might die from a stroke, just because your brain decides to end it's suffering. It's worse than bubonic plague, worse than the holocaust. I think this film caused the earthquake in Japan. If I could go back in time I would kill myself before I started watching it.

,lamnep,2011-03-26T10:59Z,"Just to clarify for everyone who doesn't know what a TS is, a TS has the same video source as a CAM but has audio pulled directly from an audio stream.

Some people have mentioned a TS as being a TC, a TC is ripped directly from the projection of the movie.

A CAM is simply recorded with a video camera, both audio and video.

It doesn't matter what software was used to encode or anything like that it simply describes what sources where used for audio or video."

 I don't normally bother commenting on the actual movie, but god damn was this a disapointment.

 It drags out the same plot for the entire movie, one which is full of holes, and then wraps up so abruptly and unintelligently.. the end of it was just so half assed.. 

 I was left wanting my money back on a free movie, litterally, the people who made this owe me $12 for even just watching it."

===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!
