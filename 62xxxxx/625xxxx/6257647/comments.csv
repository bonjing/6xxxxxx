,flackers,2011-03-20T16:06Z,"apologies. the brief synopsis refers to a different Lou Archer book, 'Sleeping Beauty'.
The appropriate synopsis is as follows:
Private detective Lou Archer is hired by the ex-fiance of a local beauty to investigate the mysterious stranger with whom his bride-to-be is now living."
