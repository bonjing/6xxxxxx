The 20th in the critically acclaimed Ethiopiques series, Live in Addis Ababa takes Ethiopiques â€“ and Ethio-jazz â€“ to a new place. The Either/Orchestra, a 10-piece jazz orchestra based in Boston, are among the first non-Ethiopian artists to become serious interpreters of Ethiopian music. Recorded live at a historic concert â€“ the first performance by a U.S. big band in Ethiopia since Duke Ellington in 1973. The results blend state-of-the-art playing and an exotic, captivating Ethiopian program into a kind of Buena Vista Social Club Addis-style, featuring several Ethiopian elder statesmen performing with a big band for the first time since the 1960s, and two younger singers doing so for the first time. Inspired by the great Ethiopian pop and jazz of the â€˜60s and â€˜70s, the E/O has brought the full array of modern jazz and Afro-Cuban innovations to an Ethiopian repertoire.
