Each book contains the topics found in the syllabus of typical Primary School English course books. There are lots of fun, practical activities involving listening, doing and creating. Progression is carefully developed, introducing students to the written language gradually; the first book contains mostly listenings and practical activities, and each successive level contains vocabulary and language activities matched to the exercise types and skills of students of that level. 
Self-assessment is possible thanks to systematic revision activities for individual use. Each volume has a removable insert with the audio tapescripts for the listening activities and answers to the activities...
