This new Metal Church album came with great anticipation. I think the critics of this new material are being a bit too harsh. Let's face it, the glory days of most metal bands of yesteryear are gone. To expect a repeat of their debut, "Hanging", or "Blessing" is just asking for way too much. I think that this new incarnation of Metal Church have put forth a worthy product. Certainly it's not going to be their best. With a great band like Metal Church, who have set the bar so high, there is going to be some disappointment with many loyal & longtime fans. The fact of the matter is that Kurdt still knows how to create interesting tunes with crunchy riffs. What more do you want? Repeatedly listening will bring forth the realization of one thing-that they are still a significant metal outfit. Loyal fans: don't turn your back on this release. Give it a try.
