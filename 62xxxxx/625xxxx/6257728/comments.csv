,tlssmith51,2011-03-20T16:38Z,yea but is it actually TeleSync...??
[T],jerry7_57,2011-03-20T17:41Z,"Thank you SAFCukO09! 

@Tlssmith51  why don't you d/l it and find out for yourself since you don't trust a trusted uploader, it's free you know."

,Phaegian,2011-03-22T01:08Z,NOT a Telesync.
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-03-22T06:43Z,shut up it is a ts ........... long gone are the days where a ts was filmed from projections rooms ...think about it ....these days they are cammed by cam or hd phone and the direct line source comes from somewhere else and synced
,M15f17,2011-03-22T14:08Z,"thats why the scene is dead, ppl don't know the definition of TS and mark cams as TS. sure ""long gone are projection room days"" but tht just means its a CAM with direct audio, NOT A TS!"

,orgs,2011-03-22T21:22Z,"@swissjoe
You're just an idiot ... I think you copy/pasted this dumb statement on every single film on here that claimed to be TS .... Download it and see for yourself, instead of asking this stupid question and thinking that you're educating someone ... you're wrong ... so STFU and quit insulting the uploaders and our intelligence. You're just making yourself look like an idiot !!"

,LewDogg419,2011-03-25T22:20Z,"why the hell didnt i know that it has the 2 guys from shaun of the dead in this?  pretty funny, as for quality its dark but watchable.  Thanks!"

,bmss,2011-03-27T05:07Z,"Another Great Quality upload from SafCuk0o9, Thanks. Gaurantee this is the best copy on the web so far"
,davey62,2011-03-27T08:04Z,"it's watchable, but the movie unfortunately is trite and unfunny.

,DreaD151,2011-03-28T16:29Z,man i just wish someone would comment and be honest instead of complain and bitch 
,priced324,2011-03-31T05:05Z,"YEAH SWISSJOE YOU D.F. SHUT UP, YOUR EVERYWHERE SPEWING YOUR IGNORANCE.KEEP YOUR THOUGHTS TO YOURSELF AND EVERYONE WON'T KNOW HOW IGNORANT YOU ARE.  "
,NinjaFurion,2011-04-01T09:49Z,"This isn't Telesync, this is a X-Ray Rip shot in the 18th dimension to the power of who gives a shit, while being compressed from its original file size of 1 petabyte all the way to a microscopic 1 gigger!  How is this possible you might ask, its cuz SAFCukO09 is that dude who kicked Merlin in the nuts and made him cry like a little bitch while he showed him what real magic was all about!

@SissyJoe , Phaegian (is that pronounced Faggin?)
U need to be careful who ur accusing of mislabeling torrents.  SAFCukO09 has been running this game for a long time, and without him, you'd only have torrents that range from shit to fake to choose from.  And you are wrong, wikipedia is not the end all source for knowledge.  If you know so much, where is your skull and bones?  There's a pecking order, if you wanna come at SAFCukO09, do it humbling wit respect, else you gots to deal wit his whole leeching posse, cuz dats how we roll on this site, son, recognize!  If you wanna be our teacher, why don't you do something real impressive and give us a TeleCine.  Until then, pull the douche out yo ass, wipe off the nut, and stop being so anal!

@SAFCukO09, yo ups may not always be perfect (cuz of whats available), but they are always first out and almost always the best when released.  It is great uploaders like you that give SissyJoe something quality to watch while he's restocking his kleenex and jergens supply!

Thanks for all your hard work, bro!

@SissyJoe , Phaegian
and sorry for being hostile, but that's how you sound when you post stupid stuff to a quality uploader.  IDC if the movie quality is labeled as RetardedElephant, if SAFCukO09 upped it then strap on the helmet and grab a bag of peanuts cuz its worth the bandwidth to check the quality."
,kostasbaleno,2011-04-01T16:53Z,thnx. nice movie
,shewolf415,2011-04-05T01:11Z,"Yea I agree with the majority on swissjoe. He always makes and ask the same dumbass questions on every torrent. And for you to challenge people like safcuk who is been doing this longer than you even understood what the word download meant. You make yourself look like a moron, like your educating people whos Iq is much bigger than your shoe size. "
,Quickie582,2011-04-07T13:01Z,"cam is a  cam is a cam, i'll wait for a DVDrip"
,corseretrograde,2011-04-07T16:15Z,"CAM!  And a lousy one at that.  Very dampened audio, dark video, NOT watchable!
"
,xiIix,2011-04-30T20:10Z,"True TS's are still done, so you are wrong SAF. All you need to do is find a theater that has hearing impaired seating and use it to jack into the camcorder. "
,xiIix,2011-04-30T21:00Z,"@Priced, please stop the pathetic DRAMA. SAF could fucking disappear off the face of the earth and hardly anyone would notice. People said the same shit about Axxo and POOF he was gone and NOTHING changed. One goes and 100 pop up. Who fucking cares! 

Take your delusions of grandure and shovem up your ass. I've been in the scene for over 18 years and have been encoding audio and video even longer. I was exploiting time warner OC3 mail servers when most of these kids were nibbling on their mommy's tits, I know a TS when I see one. This isn't.

The audio is too tinny, overmodulated, and the highs resonate like hell. It's been doctored to sound as good as it CAN, but it's not a TS. This source was not taken from an analog or digital source. This is not a TS. Period. End of story. "
,MyFootHurts,2011-05-05T07:34Z,"So tired of douches calling cams TS, and so tired of their little fanboy shits coming to their defence."
,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-05-21T12:29Z,"been wanting to see this movie for awhile now. love simon pegg and the fat guy...lolol

cam, TS...whatever the @#$% it is....it wasn't the best ""theater"" rip i've seen, but it damn sure isn't the worst...(Deathly Hallows). 

i'll give the audio a 5 on a 1 to 10 scale.
and the video a 3. 

what can i say, SAFCukO09...buddy, you did the best you could with what you had to work with. and fuck all these other illegitimate bastards who are complaining, you've no right...YOUR GETTING IT FREE FUCKERS!!!...lol. 

wasn't all that funny. it had it moments, to few mind you, but it did have them . ;-)"
