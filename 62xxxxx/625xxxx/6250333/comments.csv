,fpborges,2011-03-17T19:39Z,"As usual, thanks for the upload!"
[V],Masterzilla,2011-03-17T23:56Z,THANK YOU!!! Always on time. Don't be upset much about someone uploading it in DVDRip. Your rips are better than S1 used to be. If this stuff is converted to avi I'd be happy even with it. And after all everyone can do it on their own. Thanx once again for bringing in the source ;)

,porpoise,2011-03-21T11:15Z,Thanks thanks and thanks again from Oz.
[V],mirogster,2011-03-24T23:59Z,"@Masterzilla If you gonna to convert those episodes on .avi - better don't. You'll end up with 2-3x bigger file and no better quality :( Sad but true.
As I said, we must wait (and truly pray) for some good soul to which'll upload decent quality stuff :)"
