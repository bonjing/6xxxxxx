,ca1amity,2011-05-19T07:02Z,"I found my login just to comment:

This torrent is very poorly put together.
Audio quality is O.K (although I have a sneaking suspicion judging by some fidelity issues that this is not a direct CD rip and encode) but the real, glaring issues are that:

1. When you load these tracks up for the first time the ID3 tags are all crammed with spam for whatever ripping/torrent site that pulled the original tracks - so enjoy editing that shit out. Protip: there is a ""comments"" section for just such a purpose, I dont need some site name in every field.

2. Once thats done you'll notice that... *most* of these tracks are out of order AND have the wrong names - just go pull up the soundtrack wiki and compare

I had to go use album samples to figure out which track was which by listening and fix all the names.

Thanks for uploading, but next time dont guess at the names just look it up and save us all a lot of trouble."
