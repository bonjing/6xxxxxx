With a wealth of practical lessons and activitiesâ€”from how to correctly use apostrophes to creating "word snapshot" postersâ€”this guide contains information that can help any English or language arts teacher inspire middle grade and high school students. Because of its humor, accessible content and format, and often unusual approach to traditional subjects, this fun book has remained popular since its introduction in 1991, with this new edition updating topical references and adding dozens of new lessons and activities.
