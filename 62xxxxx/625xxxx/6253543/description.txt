         For generations, fishermen have told tales of sea             
         monsters. One of the world's most legendary monsters is a     
         sea serpent known as Cadborosaurus, or "Caddy," which has     
         been reported off the coast of British Columbia for more      
         than a century. But to science, it doesn't officially         
         exist. Now Pat travels to Vancouver Island to track it        
         down. He questions eyewitnesses, explores the myths of        
         the coastal people who have occupied the area for more        
          than 5,000 years and confers with top oceanographers.
