Walmart is depleting the Social Services budgets of all communities where it has stores, one at a time, with tax-breaks and paying below-poverty wages to its workers, they call them "Hourly Associates". Assistant Store Managers, glorified slaves, are not much better.

Store co-Managers are a bit better, while Store Managers are the initial step of decent pay; however, their working conditions are just as disgusting as those of the hourly associates.

These files are for fiscal year 2009, they are very close for the current management pay and bonuses.
