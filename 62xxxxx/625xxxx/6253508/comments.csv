If you accidentally lose your torrent file, come back here and reload it. And seed on. If you format your PC, come back here afterwards and re-download it. And seed. Create a folder somewhere on your PC, where the torrent file won't bother you. Make yourself a commitment to seed for 1 year or something. Do it for the fact that you were given this freely.
God bless you all and give you wisdom."
