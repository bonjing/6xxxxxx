These are all songs that were recorded for Norman Grantz's Pablo label in the seventies and early eighties. In those days, no matter how many songs were recorded at a session, record producers would ration us to only ten to twelve songs per album and discard the rest. Few record producers were more parsimonious than Norman Grantz. I have just ripped one of Ella's albums on Pablo and it contains a miserly nine songs. The songs on this album are not 'alternate takes' or in any way 'seconds', just songs that were deemed surplus to the 'ration'.

Gregg Field, now a partner at the Concord Music Group and co-producer of this album, is also one of the world's top drummers. He was a member of the Count Basie Orchestra in the early eighties and part of Ella's permanent trio. He knew that a lot of Ella's recordings on Pablo were unreleased, he played on many, so he set about finding them.

The result is this themed 'Love Song' album (which suggests that he found a lot more Pablo tracks) released in 2007 to celebrate what would have been Ella's 90th birthday.
