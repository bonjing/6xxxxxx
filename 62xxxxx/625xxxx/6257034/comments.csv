[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-21T00:43Z,ive upped retail tangled 720p with correct aspect ratio mate.
[V],aoloffline,2011-03-21T01:23Z,Good for u.AVS720 rls on tpb has 1280 x720.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-21T13:13Z,"I thought you were more cooperative than that.

The AVS release isn't retail, and the retail SiNNERS release is better quality than the AVS720 and your CHD and HDChina torrents (which have bad AR) so it's a shame if you decide to hold on to them just because of the swarms (which will die in time if you do the right thing)

Have a nice day :)"
