If you had any doubts as to David Wayne's vocal ability live, then look no further: I rate this one of the BEST live metal albums of all time. I have the import, so I don't know if it's in the other release, but there's a paragraph where the band explains that it was live recordings and they didn't do much to improve the sound, so to expect the sound of a live recording: ALL I HEARD WAS PERFECTION LIVE! The riffing this band did back then was unbelieveable. Think of Iced Earth's guitar speed now ... well Metal Churh had it back then. And David Wayne's vocals were as powerful, if not more, than on the albums! This guy has a heaviness to his voice that no one can pull off live. If you liked the 1st two Metal Church albums at all, then get this and play it loud!
