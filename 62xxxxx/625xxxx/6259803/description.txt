Agent Doug Carlin from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is sent to investigate the explosion and discovers evidence that the attack was committed by a domestic terrorist. On arrival at the scene he hears his phone ringing which he discovers isn't his ,coming from a body bag nearby.He then meets with the investigating police officers and FBI Agent Paul Pryzwarra, and informs them of his findings.
