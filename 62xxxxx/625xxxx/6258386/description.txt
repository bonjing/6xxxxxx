Shortly before the end of Eddie Murphy - Delirious the irrepressible Murphy points out the irony of his appearing before an SRO audience at Washington DC's Constitution Hall, the same establishment which refused to allow black opera star Marian Anderson to give a concert in 1939. Murphy may not be in the same style of performance as Anderson, but no one can deny that back in 1983 he galvanized an audience as few other comedians could. Occasionally there's a PG bit involving Eddie's family, but for the most part the humor is raunchy -- as evidenced by Murphy's routine about Ralph Kramden being "serviced" by Ed Norton.
