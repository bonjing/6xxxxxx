Jeeves - A Gentleman's Personal Gentleman.

By C. Northcote Parkinson.

[The Life and Times of Jeeves]

NOT P.G. Wodehouse.

Taken from cassette, so quality is not the best. Approx. 2 hours.
I've left the music at the beginning and end but removed it from the other sides.

Read by Gerald Harper, with:
Frank Duncan as Jeeves
Keith Alexander as Bertie Wooster

And a large supporting cast. Details, with cover scan, included.

I hope this isn't a third copy as Demonoid has rejected the first two attempts.
