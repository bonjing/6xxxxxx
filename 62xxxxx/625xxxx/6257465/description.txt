Chaos reigns at the natural history museum when night watchman Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) accidentally stirs up 
an ancient curse, awakening Attila the Hun, an army of gladiators, a Tyrannosaurus rex and other exhibits. Larry tries 
desperately to keep the museum under control, but he's fighting a losing battle until President Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) 
comes to the rescue. Owen Wilson and Dick Van Dyke co-star in this family-friendly fantasy.
