,millennium5,2011-03-17T19:25Z,"Thanks a lot for the up, but the story is crap, the vatican did not burn witches at the stake but Bible believing Christians, they called us Heretics because we red the Bible and believed more in the word of God that in the Pope. The pope by the way is the Antichrist as described in the Bible and the RCC is the Whore of Babylon.

And the Pope is behind the NWO too, beware of the second beast from revelation. Nicolas Cage is a Freemason and they are like all other secret societies controlled by the Vatican via its Gestapo the Jesuits.

Anyway, great work uploader, its not your faul the story is a propaganda lie."

,Dragonite_9,2011-04-02T23:52Z,"Can I have your attention for just a minute please! Please read this for all ours sake! 

SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte 

blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

MVH.

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

PS: Feel free to copy and spread this to all torrents you download and upload, please!"
,Shoobox,2011-04-10T17:39Z,"disappointing:
 usually 3Li has English subs, this rip has no English subs in the folders. this has non in both the vob subs folder"
,Shoobox,2011-04-10T17:48Z,"this version will work for english subs
www DOT podnapisi DOT net/en/season-of-the-witch-2011-subtitles-p1133473"
,Shoobox,2011-04-10T17:50Z,"ENGLISH SUBS

www DOT podnapisi DOT net/en/season-of-the-witch-2011-subtitles-p1133473

MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SRT FILE AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD IT TO MATCH THE SAME NAME OF THE 3LI MOVIE FOR ENGLISH SUBS TO WORK.
EXAMPLE  
""SEASON OF THE WITCH.SRT"""
,willebyj,2011-04-18T00:47Z,"thanks for the up 3li, will comment on quality when DL completes :)"
,malhalla,2011-05-08T07:25Z,"The English subtitles referred to here are the worst I have experienced. Remind me to stay far away from Robin Joseph's sub's. Not even watched the first two minutes of movie before I feel the need to turn it off. One example is a witch in start saying ""You will burn in hell"" it is subbed as ""we will burn in hell"". That is a major error as it shape the movie story. I am guessing it is a sick attempt from the author of the subtitles to cover religion's endless havoc."
