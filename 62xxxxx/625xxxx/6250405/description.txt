SUMMARY:
A 14th century Crusader returns to a homeland devastated by the Black Plague. 
A beleaguered church, deeming sorcery the culprit of the plague, commands the 
two knights to transport an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will 
perform a ritual in hopes of ending the pestilence. A priest, a grieving 
knight, a disgraced itinerant and a headstrong youth who can only dream 
of becoming a knight join a mission troubled by mythically hostile wilderness 
and fierce contention over the fate of the girl. When the embattled party 
arrives at the abbey, a horrific discovery jeopardises the knight's pledge 
to ensure the girl fair treatment, and pits them against an inexplicably 
powerful and destructive force.
