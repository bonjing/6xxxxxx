,zgruner,2011-03-19T21:43Z,why my antivirus shows that there are viruses here:/ cant start game because shogun.dll is infected....
,coolman1312,2011-03-19T21:47Z,It works. and my computer isnt infected so its safe to asume that you got a false positive 
,coolman1312,2011-03-19T21:52Z,"Probably a false positive, because my antivirus didnt scream"

,JedoDre,2011-03-20T12:22Z,So can someone go past the 40th turn to see if everything works? Previous releases seemd to have problems wih the cracks that corrupted savegames and wouldn't let you play past 40 or something like that.

Have steam installed, made sure patch was in right directory, need help, thanks in advance."

,ShockerStalin,2011-04-02T00:47Z,"Shoul there be some kind of progress bar when using Phoenix?

I have the mdx file mounted in Daemon. Run Phoenix as it says to but as soon as I click ""Unpack"" I get a tool tray pop up saying it is working, but there is no progress bar, nothing seems to be happening and nothing is unpacking to the destination folder.

Has anyone got this to work on Win 7 64bit?"
,coolman1312,2011-05-08T10:00Z,@ShockerStalin My computer is Win 7 64 bit and it works perfectly
,Bad213Boy,2011-05-27T05:54Z,"Someone still needs to fix the movie .pack files. Even the Add-on Torrent one is wrong. I had to used Pack File Manager to open the movies2.pack file and half of the intro and ending videos were all wrong.

I had to install RADTools and FMV-Extractor. You can't just play the .bik files using RADTools. I needed something to analyze the info first and unlock the file in order for RADTools to play the videos. This is where FMV-Extractor came in. I was able to analyze each .bik file and then play them within FMV-Extractor, but it still needed RADTools installed to play the videos.

There are quite a few videos missing. The Takeda intro movie is missing, and the Mori, Oda, Takeda, and Uesugi ending videos are missing. "
,spinitup,2011-05-29T05:07Z,"@Everyone. As of yesterday (May 28th 2011) I experienced a critical problem with Shogun 2 - once I started the game it hanged at the Sega/Shogun 2 screen and failed to proceed further. The cursor remained the same as the Windows cursor and I left it for 25 minutes and still nothing happened. I tried multiple times to load the game but came up with the same problem. I had to Task Manager that shit to turn it off.

This coincided with installing the latest updates - The Chinese patch + Crack 1 & 2. So I looked on Steam and it was on sale with 33% off. I like this game so much and it was a bargain so I bought it, hoping this problem would go away. It didn't. I deleted all the pirate shit and downloaded the legit copy. I also bought the new DLC (worth it IMO).

Apparently Creative Assembly are working into the night on a fix because that patch fucked everything up and there's a shitstorm going off about it. If you are in this situation, don't worry it's not your drivers or what's in the registry from that (what you might think is dodgy) Chinese shit. Those guys did good, it's the actual developers that fucked up.

BTW my pirate copy of Shogun worked perfectly before the patch update, but I wanted Anti Aliasing and to fix some of the retarded things troops were doing on the battlefield. My advice if you haven't updated is to hold off a couple of weeks and stick with the Fairlight release."
,spinitup,2011-05-29T05:25Z,"BTW if you are experiencing that patch problem where the game hangs indefinitely at the opening credits (shogun 2 box containing credits surrounded by black + no icon change), Sega's support team have recommended deleting the file contained in C:\Users\insert your username\app data (hidden folder\The Creative Assembly\scripts."
,victoriousvic,2011-10-09T00:42Z,is this the full game or....?
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-26T22:17Z,"***UPDATE ONCE AGAIN***

This download is old and is missing tons of stuff, including the movies. If you want the complete version with all movies and DLC's do a search for:

Total War Shogun 2 v.1.10 + 3DLC RePack by R.G.Mechanics

R.G.Mechanics is Build 4247, so I don't think you'll need to download ""Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack"" patch. Either way, you'll still need ""patch10.pack Build 4358"" & ""3DMGAME-Shogun2.v1.1.0.Build.4358.0.Crack.Fix2.Patch-3DM"".

Do another search for:
 [FSrv] Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack

Anyone who's played Build 4247 knows how fucked up the game is. The latest patch, Build 4358, and crack are on the thread 35:

Page 35:
 patch10.pack build 4358
