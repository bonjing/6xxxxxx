Thought i would share this with the world ,

Pink Floyds,  Dark Side of the Moon 4.1 DTS 96/24 Encode.

Source: MLP 96/24 Unoffical DVD-A of Original Master recording by Alan Parsons

Obviously need SPDIF output and a reciever that can handle dts 96/24 otherwise dont bother downloading.

Enjoy
