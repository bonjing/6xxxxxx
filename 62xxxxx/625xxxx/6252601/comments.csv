Sound issue: yes. 

For english, select the second (down) option when installing.

Can't change game difficulty, stuck on normal.

For better performances, go to nvidia control panel and select ""force alternate frame rendering2"" for sli setting.

Thank tou AiTB !"

,majinbuxl,2011-03-19T20:23Z,"This works fine for me. You don't need to download anything else to make it work. No other cracks or patches. Just download this torrent, run installation, select second option during install, and then just run the game.

Originally I installed this and then also installed ""crack fix+ammo"" as mentioned by UFO.Sule but I couldn't hear speech sounds. Unistalled and then reinstalled the game using method above. Now works fine. Once again, you don't need anything else."

,Muianescu,2011-03-31T13:11Z," Thanks for the game it works just fine in Windows 7 with all details on very high and antialiasing at maximum. First of all is correct that on install you need to select case 2 (for english) and if you have the latest video driver never, but never try to instalate the ageia physx provided by the game, or direct X. For me having directX 10 could be a problem installing directX 9. As for the game it was so fucking annoying that I have uninstall before finishing. My rate because of this is 2/10. Astounding graphics but too scripted even for the order in which you can run into a room and if you don't understand for the first time what you need to do, the enemies continue to respawn. And the most idiotic thing, weapons from enemis could not be used, just like delta force 4 incredible for a game in 2011!"

 Read in the comments that the Skidrow update might solve it, downloaded and installed said update, now when I start the game nothing happens, after a minute the message ""Steam must be running to play this game."" Pops up. And in the Binaries map a file called ""HOMEFRONT.exe.3072.STEAMSTART"" is created.

Will try the sound fix but expecting another shitheap.

Not sure if its the release or the game, but this has got to be one of the most unstable/buggiest game I have tried in quite some time. Good thing I didn't spend any money on it. Guess I'll try again in a month or three, hope some patches or whatnot will make it work properly by then.
