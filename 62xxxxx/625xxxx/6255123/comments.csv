1->2. Right before leaving Dock Colony on Elsa _first time_. All consequent visits not counted.
2->3. After fight with Albedo and before fight with strange guy in Song of Nephelim. Go back to tower 2 and save your game.

To swap DVD you have to save your game, shutdown PS2, change DVD and load your game from new DVD."

,wazza89,2011-08-22T22:01Z,"Hey thanks alot for the up. Just a tip for anyone using PCSX2, I just started the 'second' disk and encountered some problems that I have now solved.

The savepoints are a known problem, so using savestates is what most of you will be doing, however when you go to board the Elsa after the commander gets attacked, for me the savepoint near the bridge of the ship reset to ps2 browser. The save point in Ziggys room worked, so I saved there. Now swap to disk 2, and turn the 'skip MPEG cutscenes' ON in game fixes, because there is a bad sector at the beginning of 2nd disk halfway through cutscene. You can turn this back off afterwards. No matter how many times I extracted the ISO, the error persisted, so I can only conclude it is a disk error. 
Once again, thankyou Lain_13, I hope I have been some help."
