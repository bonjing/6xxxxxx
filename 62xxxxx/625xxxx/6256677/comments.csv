,Dreamkingno1,2011-03-20T10:45Z,"Plenty of leechers but not a single seeder on at the moment...If you can seed a full copy even for just 1 hour it will help others get the whole thing and spread it faster.

,mw1987,2011-03-20T11:43Z,"@Newmagnus
That's because you are stupid!

Use peerblock application to block anti peer 2 peer noob! 80% of leechers coming from those anti pirate organizations.

You have to block them... Learn to seed properly, #1 rule"

,JamesDurden,2011-03-21T08:32Z,quality = 3/10
,Patriquez,2011-03-23T14:44Z,"Normally i never have problems with ''Sir Paul'' rip but this time something seems wrong with the file.
Downloaded 2 times but it refuses to play in windows media player(yes i have all the codecs) and when i play it from usb on my plasma tv i get a strange annoying noise trough the video.(No, never had this problem be4 and watch movies all the time this way)
Gom player did manage to play the file in a correct manner, but i refuse to watch this on my computer while i can watch it on my tv.

I gave a shot at the torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6259160/UFC.128.Shogun.vs.Jones.HDTV.x264-RUDOS

And i must say that the quality is much better than the ''Sir Paul'' rip and had no problems playing it with WMP and my plasma tv.

Thanks anyways for the effort uploader."
