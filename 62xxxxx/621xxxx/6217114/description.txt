                Who's the Daddy?
                Sitcom about slack admin workers at a law firm.
                Darrel's estranged dad Pat turns up doing odd jobs at
                Fox Cranford. Pat soon spots an opportunity to find a
                new home at Darrel and Shelley's flat having been
                kicked out by his ex. Shelley sees Pat for the
                unreliable self-obsessed idiot that he is and verges
                on the point of violence. It's a big day for Asif -
                if he passes his driving test he's been promised a
                new set of wheels by his dad. And Kenny is stressed
                because everyone thinks he's boring now he's settled
                with Tania and sets out to prove them wrong.
