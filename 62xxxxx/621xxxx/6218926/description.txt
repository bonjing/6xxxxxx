K heres a little inside info on these files. No ones got NWA shows on file on here, so I figured the Media Crew to NWA SW, the fella responsible for keep that fed alive for the past year, should release some unseen goodies.

These may not be the best camera work, these were mailed to me directly for me to use footage off for commercials and stuff. THESE ARE THE ONLY COPIES ONLINE OR AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC!!!

I will seed indefinitely, I would also take notice of the Red River stampede as well for a much more updated recent show. These are still nice videos for the die hard fans like ol N2KMaster here :P
