This feature follows the student unrest that gripped Hungary in the wake of the 1947 socialist revolution. Scores of students are now able to attend college. Students march in an organized parade and push police into the water. They try to convince students at a parochial school to join them. Dialogue ensues, a student starts to sing old folk songs, and the young police chief counters with folk dancers. When students from the religious school are arrested, the situation verges on violence. Discussions of revolution and reform dominate the dialogue between the two factions who are equally concerned with local and world events.
