Show Summary: A comedy series. How I Met Your Mother is a comedy about Ted 
and how he fell in love. It all starts when Ted's best friend, Marshall, drops the 
bombshell that he's going to propose to his long-time girlfriend, Lily, a kindergarten 
teacher. At that moment, Ted realizes that he had better get a move on if he too 
hopes to find true love. Helping him in his quest is Barney, a friend with endless, 
sometimes outrageous opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet 
women. When Ted meets Robin, he's sure it's love at first sight, but destiny may have 
something else in store.
