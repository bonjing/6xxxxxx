With session drummer Larrie Londin, they released FOREVER that summer, produced by Bob Gallo. While the first single, ""You Can't Dance"" was cracking the top 40 throughout Ontario, DJs got a surprise bonus when their cover of Van Morrison's ""Into The Mystic"" on the b-side also became a hit. With the exception of that song, all the tracks were written by Ryan and Yeomans. ""She's The One"" was released as the next single, and other noteable tracks included ""She's Gonna Get Away,"" ""Brazil Nuts,"" and the tender ""The Night Music"" and ""No Sad Songs."" They called on Bob Clarke, who was in The Amen with them over a decade earlier, to be the new drummer, and they hit the road while touring across Canada and making stops along the eastern US seaboard. They were nominated for a Juno that year for most promising new group, but lost to Myles and Lenny."
