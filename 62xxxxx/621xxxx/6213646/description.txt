From Publishers Weekly
Author of What Makes Juries Listen, Emmy winner for her Boston TV talk show, Hamlin here presents a variety of techniques and approaches to promote job success. In a breezy, informal discourse, she begins with a differentiation of three basic work personalities\"achievers, affiliators and influencers.\" Suggesting ways that each of these types may conduct a conference, ask for a raise, lobby a client, solicit a would-be employer, Hamlin provides guidelines, insights and advice that are patently useful. There are many innovative strategies for the neophyte public speaker, for example, and for making presentations both verbal and visual. This is a compendium of tested techniques that can help readers to improve communication on the job and elsewhere. 30,000 first printing; author tour.
