,Danbouges,2011-05-09T01:27Z,"Much, Much better than the top torrent. THanks so much man. Not everyone wants a cheap thrill on an ipod screen, some of us download these seasons to enjoy for hours on real setups. This is like the 3rd show I wouldnt be able to watch without you. Without this ""the shield"" release, I couldn't watch it. No where on the net is there a decent copy besides this."

,riplikethat,2011-09-05T22:57Z,"Why is every other season than season 1 not properly widescreen?
"
[V],meech,2011-09-10T15:47Z,Because that's how the dvds were produced.
[V],meech,2011-09-25T00:35Z,"riplikethat:
Also, not all widescreen is shot at 16:9.  The term widescreen is usually used for anything wider than 4:3.  Just because it's not 16:9, doesn't mean it's ""improper"", it's just how it was shot/dvds were produced.  I have to admit, some of the shield dvds had weird ratios (wider than 4:3, yet skinnier than 16:9), but like's been said, them's were the dvds."

meech, get a proper source please, there is no place for severely cropped shows anymore. it's 2012 not 1999.

Get this instead:
