You guys must really be messing with something, i patched and here runs fine with 3.55 kmeaw. Just follow the exact instructions inside the patch file."
,astrosal9,2011-03-08T07:56Z,This is my first time downloading something to my ps3 using pirate bay. Can anyone be nice enough to explain how and which update i have to use for pirated games and explain how to install this game? Step by step? Any help will appreciated.
,lonewolf2k2,2011-03-10T02:42Z,haha do you even have a JBPS3
,josevaldo,2011-03-10T03:46Z,"@astrosal9

I'll be a nice guy and tell you to type ""ps3 hacks"" on google. Surely you'll find 10 or more sites with very good tutorials.

Good Luck"

,psu190,2011-03-10T07:18Z,"game freezes after initial fight scene, with patch deployed and also .sfo file  Anybody else freezes?"
,krumbs,2011-03-11T10:14Z,"Does not work for me, either. After the initial fight and the cutscene. the video simply fades out... and then nothing!
This happened four times in a row. Did wait for upto 20 min in the hope that the game was loading in background. Had to reboot the ps3 every time, and the worst part is that game progress does not get saved - so you have to  all over again each time.
Yes, followed the instructions for patching up the game. Am on 3.55 kmeaw, using the latest version of multiman. 
Any help will be most appreciated! In the meantime, i am downloading the xbox 360 version of the game. "
