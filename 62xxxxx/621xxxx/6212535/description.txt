              In late 19th Century Hong Kong the British      
               may rule the land, but the pirates rule         
               the waters. Reluctantly, the Coast Guard        
               is given money to fight these pirates, but     
                 the pirates themselves have many contacts       
                 (that is, bribed officials) in the              
                government, and seek to thwart the Coast        
                Guard's efforts to eliminate them. One           
               Coast Guard officer is Dragon Ma, who is         
               determined that his beloved Coast Guard          
                will not be made fools of.
