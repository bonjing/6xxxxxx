,tommy69lvr,2011-03-04T02:59Z,"The first, true digital computer was invented at the University of Pennsylvania, in the USA....It was call the ENIAC.  Personal computers were also invented in the USA, by the founders of APPLE and Microsoft.  Check your history."
,tommy69lvr,2011-03-04T14:06Z,"Well in the USA, we are not given a ""choice"" between 2 candidates.  Anyone can run for any office, and usually many candidates run and are eventually reduced to 2 or 3 through a series of primary elections.  Most Americans, not all, feel that it does not matter whether you are Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or any other religion or race.  We are all Americans and try to tolerate each other, not spread hate.  Candidates are elected based on there agendas not on there religion.  Religion and government should remain separate so that all people can worship as they see fit.   Attacking a certain group shows a lack of understanding of how the USA actually works.  If you notice, no matter how many Jews are in office, our justice system is still based on English common law, a very Christian system of values. "
