This is a pretty good compilation of what the Bible says about these things. Never take the speakers word all by itself.  Look at the Bible and see if what he is saying squares with truth.  

This guy is pretty good - and while it is great to have this sort of input, it is 

essential that you form your own understanding based FIRST on the Bible.

I hope this collection will be a valuable resource for you and if you find it is, here is the site that it comes from - you can order an official copy from there: http://store.livingontheedge.org/store/products?search=let+my+people+think&commit=Go
