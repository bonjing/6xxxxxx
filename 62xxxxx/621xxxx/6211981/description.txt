White Dwarf magazine once churned out excellent, British-flavored AD&D content in its infancy. The AD&D Fiend Folio, full of perennial fan favorites, was culled from the pages of this magazine. A second installment was planned, but a falling out of some sort occurred. We were left always wanting those insane monsters from over the sea.

The wait is over. Every AD&D-relevant issue of White Dwarf was located in the highest quality to allow for every page of every Fiend Factory section to be pulled in chronological order, resulting in this. Within find the unpublished fourth (and fifth?) monster book(s) for AD&D.
