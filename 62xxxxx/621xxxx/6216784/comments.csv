,Z_Pirate,2011-03-09T00:20Z,"A couple of tips for anyone using R4i-SDHC / R4i-SDHC 1.4.
If you are have a 1.4 then you will want to run Wood4TT 1.25, which can be gotten here http://www.r4wood.com/pages/TTi-DSTT-Kernel.html.  Just rename ""TTMENU.DAT"" to ""TTMENU.nds"", then drop it and the ""_rpg"" folder into the root of your card.  Easy as.
If you have the original R4i-SDHC it is a little more complicated, you will have to search for ""RetroGameFan Multi Cart Update"" and download it off of Filetrip.
6.53 will be the version you are after, you should easily find the R4i-SDHC folder amongst the other flash carts.  Within this there will be all the files you need and instructions on how to install.

If you are unsure which R4i-SDHC you have, just check out http://www.r4i-sdhc.com/downloade.asp."
,Z_Pirate,2011-03-09T00:23Z,"Also forgot to mention, that if you are using the original R4i-SDHC you have to use a clean rom to play.  Such as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6214473/Pokemon_Black_and_White_%5BNDS%5D%5BEnglish%5D%5BClean_ROM%5D%5Bwww.consolasat."

,craiggalexander,2011-03-12T23:19Z,"ok the ROM works perfectly fine in Desume 0.9.7.  but the only problem im having with alllllll of these rips of pokemon black or white is that the start button does NOT work. meaning, after you beat the first gym leader and leave you get the HM CUT, but you cant teach your pokemon the move due to lack of having the ability of pulling up the start menu, saving and loading is fine, but the start menu is ot there. if anyone knows how to pull that up, please email me.

If anyone is having this problem this is my solution:

1. Download this torrent (obviously, because it rocks, ty consolasatope)
2. Unzip blah blah blah
3. Download the latest Acekard firmware i.e. 1.8.6a from here >>> http://filetrip.net/file.php?id=24259
4. MAKE SURE YOU FORMAT YOUR SD CARD. I have a Sandisk 4GB SDHC. I used this software to format it on PC. (for those using a mac, it doesn't work on mac using crossover, i have bootcamped windows) find the software here >>> http://www.sdcard.org/consumers/formatter_3/
5. Load up all the files that you have downloaded. That should be the __aio file, the akmenu4.nds file and the pokemon[colour].patched.nds file, onto the SDHC card.
6. Play

This is what worked for me. I actually get to the menu screen with no loading problems at all. I'm currently talking to Prof Juniper and have already typed in my name with no problems.
I've looked around the internet like the rest of you having problems with this (acekard users particularly) for a good few hours. If you're reading this I strongly suggest you try it. 

This method could also work for R4...I don't have this model card so I can't say."

Not claiming enough knowledge to speak openly about emulators but I've been using them for a few months now.
That being said, I can't get this to work on No$gba [The DS emulator]  
It simply tells me 
""The save data could not be accessed. 
Please turn the power off and reinsert the Game Card.""

Is there something I'm not understanding or am I just failing?"
