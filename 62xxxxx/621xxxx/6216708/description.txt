Today will be focused on the new trainees and their ability to process pain. They have proven that they have what it takes to get this far, but this is only the beginning. I want them to not just experience the pain, but process it and let it be something they take with them and grow from.

I bring in Master John to help the trainees with this process. He has trained several slaves and is well known in the BDSM community. His expertise will help these girls immensely throughout the remaining time that they are here.
