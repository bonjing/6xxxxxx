För en fattig fan är du den som skänker bröd i svältens stund.

..undrar vad den andra snubben menade med ""password""?

Ha det!"
,SnapplerX,2011-10-16T21:15Z,"when the key works, it asks you to make an account. when you make an account, you provide your email address and a password. then when someone else uses your key, it asks them to provide these details to make sure you don't get your key stolen. SO, when it asks for a password for an email, that means someone beat you to that key and already made their own account with it. The uploader is not going to have the password for it. "
