Even CD-images. Anything.

You tell it to burn - it burns! :)"
,User897,2011-03-04T12:20Z,"What are the Blu-ray features?  Does it burn, play, convert, etc.?"
[M],Ubehage,2011-03-04T12:42Z,"It does the same with Blu-Ray as with DVD...

All the same features."

,TheEmpathicEar,2011-03-04T17:49Z,Thx! What is the exact version number for this release?
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2011-03-07T22:02Z,Good question Ear! It's amazing that this would lack a version number. All of these releases come with a version number AFAIK.
[V],big_dad_e,2011-03-08T04:57Z,"Thanks Ubehage!  I had an earlier version installed and could not get newer installs to work, until now!  Works great, TYVM M8!

,Murdermaru321,2011-04-30T06:10Z,"Thanks allot! but i have to say.... If you can't update, then you don't get the most recent ""cracks"" from the developer, which means you can't copy your newest Blu rays... 

This kinda sucks since you can only back up movie that are older than this version of dvdFab 8.."
