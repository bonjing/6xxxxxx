From the Infowars web site ::

Prison Planet.com journalist, editor, and webmaster Paul Joseph Watson andeditor and researcher Aaron Dykes fill in for Alex. Paul Craig Roberts talks about Libya and the economy. Paul and Aaron cover the latest news and developments in the Middle East and the rise in oil and gold prices.

Alex began hosting today's show, but had to leave after a half-hour due to illness.


I'm including in this torrent ebook copies of two of the three books Dr. Roberts mentions during his interview and which are the subject of his recent article:
"The Perfidy of Government: How we Lost our Economy, the Constitution and our Civil Liberties" 
http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=23441
elsewhere titled:
"The Perfidy of Government: Evidence v. Denial"

The books are:

Matt Taibbi's Griftopia - Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids & the Long Con That Is Breaking America

and

JFK and the Unspeakable - Why He Died and Why It Matters, by James Douglass.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
