Fullmetal Alchemist Ultimate Complete Collection (Dual Audio / Eclipse Fansubs / Hiyono Fansubs)


Okay, I'm not writing another synopsis this time, and I don't think it should be necessary.

For those of you who have been wondering why it has taken me so long to supply the next FMA Brotherhood update, here's your reason. Supplied here are all 51 episodes, 1 movie, and 4 (US Released) OVAs of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime, as well as all 64 episodes and 4 OVAs of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. The Brotherhood episodes are done as the the previous set, with the audio and DVD subs meticulously applied to the Eclipse Fansub 720p releases. 1-39 are dual audio, 40-64 are Japanese Audio with subs by Eclipse. Once again, the Eclipse subs are still available for 1-39. The original Fullmetal Alchemist episodes and movie are all direct DVD rips done by yours truly. The OVAs were found online with only a full subtitle track, but I altered them to have a track for just tags and song lyrics too. If anyone happens to have a subbed copy of the 5th OVA, I'll gladly include it in the next update if you can supply it to me. All presented material for FMA 1 is in 480p, fullscreen for the main series, widescreen for the movie and OVAs. Please seed, and enjoy thouroughly.
