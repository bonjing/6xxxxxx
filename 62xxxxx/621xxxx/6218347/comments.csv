,squaretwo,2011-03-28T00:35Z,Thank you! I've been waiting too long for FMA: Brotherhood 720p with english dub.
,209zG8stevr,2011-05-01T11:23Z,"once again i ask the torrent world why .mkv???? could some1 please explain the diff between .mkv and say .avi and ts files i know what they are i just dont know why some are used for some files and while .avi seems to be the universal format for uploaders, why it isnt for certain shows (example: the 70 sumthan gbs of Macguyver) 

do not get me wrong i am addicted to torrents and i thank the scene im just curious i guess lol thanx uploader..... waiting for new hdd than i will get this :)"
,209zG8stevr,2011-05-01T11:26Z,"also shockingly fast for the seed to peer ratio (to all who arent dlling this becuz a lack of seeds, i have 27/58 seeds and 28/86 peers and its going upwards of 300kb/s) food for thought 

thank torrent Gods for seeders

;)"
,AssD,2011-07-09T05:18Z,"209zG8stevr: Hi, mate! .avi is a really old format. It was created in 1992 by Microsoft. Why the hell would you still want to use that? .mkv was created ten years later and is the Nr. 1 choice for every movie downloader. It takes less space and is supported by many Blu-ray players. Only noobs upload HD movies in .avi. I hope that helped. Lol."
,dinosaur58,2011-07-12T09:25Z,"@ 209zG8stevr: I would add to the above comment that avi does not support soft-sub, and does not 'like' multiple audio streams, so if you want the option to watch in Jpn WITH Subs OR Eng WITHOUT Subs you need to use a modern container such as mkv or mp4. If you have trouble playing these formats try VLC player [or MediaPlayerClassic with a good codec pack if you know what you're doing] - both are Freeware."
,temlin,2011-08-18T23:42Z,"Great upload! plays well with vlc. with every soundâŠ‚

Can anyone tell me the easiest wat to convert to avi? I can't play mkv file on my PS3 as far as I know."
,thepinkunderlord,2012-03-23T17:47Z,"Question, why are the FMAB episodes from 40 onward only japanese?

Also, @Deathwolf666 download ps3 media server, you can stream them from your computer to your ps3 with no hassles whatsoever"
