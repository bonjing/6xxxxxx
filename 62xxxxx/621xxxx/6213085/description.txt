"Noam Chomsky will talk about social justice and â€œpeople-centered movementsâ€ in Egypt and the Middle East when he speaks on Thursday at the Unitarian Universalist Church."


Organiser Michael Louis Ippolito of Bridgewater hopes Thursdayâ€™s talk also raises awareness of a movement to amend the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would abolish the legal personhood of corporate entities.
