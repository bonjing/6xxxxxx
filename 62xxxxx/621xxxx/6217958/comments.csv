One thing that's confusing me is that I was sure I started downloading a lakorn, a few days ago. Forget the nake, but it had the title ""Chocolate"" in brackets and I do know that their also exists a movie of the same name. I can't find either evidence of my download, nor of the lakorn, now.

Did I dream it, cuz if I did, my lady had the same dream.

Very confused!!!"

If you really want, I will upload for you.

Yes please... -)

Also, could you please, please, please upload just the first disc again of Theptida pla rah as, no matter what I do, it freezes at 1 hour and 40 minutes - with 20 minutes still to play.

Have tried to repair it without success.
