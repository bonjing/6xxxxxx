the bootit NG image but NOT the file itself!

This torrent 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6221430 is the missing file, bootitng.iso which creates the
Bootit NG boot CD onto a blank CD.  You need a CD or DVD burner
and burning software.

Without this software you cannot restore the image of Vista onto 
a spare 80 GB HD.

Sorry for the inconvenience!

I could NOT get this image to boot on HP TouchSmart PC IQ775.

My image of Windows 7 Ultimate booted on first try!

Otherwise this image will boot on 9+ of 10 computers designed to run Vista

Frequently the Vista image will not boot on newer vista machines. 

If so you can boot spare HD on a compatable PC. 

Use regedit to edit registry settings of HKLM/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/

Change the start DWORD values for msahci from 3 to 0 and, pciide 
from 0 to 3.

Replace spare HD and your boot should succeed.

Please note sometimes even my Windows 7 image needs this registry hack!
