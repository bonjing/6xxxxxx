Deploy My images of Windows onto PCs (laptops, netbooks or desktops). No activation or produuct keys required!


Restoring images wipes everything off the target partition and is NOT for NOOBS!


V32LO.img: Vista Lite image needs 80 GB HD, minimum 1 GB RAM, 2+ GHz


Apparatus:

1.  Desktop PC
2.  DVD burner
3.  Spare 80 GB HD (see above paragraph)
4.  2 blank CDs: 1 to make BootitNG boot CD, the other Vista Boot Recovery CD

Help.txt  This help file

Almost always, you need to enter bios to change SATA operation from AHCI to ATA, IDE or Auto

Vista Boot Recovery.iso creates Vista Boot Recovery CD.  
It is NOT a Windows Vista CD and may be necessary for doing boot repairs.

Frequently, the Vista Boot Recovery disk is needed to perform initial boot repairs.
Frequently the Vista image will not boot on newer vista machines. 

If so you can boot spare HD on a compatable PC. 
Use regedit to edit registry settings of HKLM/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/

Change the start DWORD values for msahci from 3 to 0 and, pciide 
from 0 to 3.

Replace spare HD and your boot should succeed.

and how to manage Avast antivirus.

Deploying Windows Vista involves restoring the windows partition onto free space.

Big Thank you to all the torrent trackers, uploaders, seeders and commentators. 
Without your help these images would cost more than days of toil.
Thanks to Pirate Bay,btjunkie, snapfiles, cnet, filehippo, oldversion.com,
mydigitalife, blackviper, BootitNG, Avast, Driverguide, Google, CUSTOMERS!

NB my disciples:

Beware of Acer Computers.  Acer HDs change the first partition on the HD.  
Therfore you need to do Step 8 after Step 6.  
This puts a dummy 2 GB data partition onto the beginning of the HD. 
Make the dummy partition botable (set active using BootitNG)
After you restore the dummy partition continue with steps 7 - 11. 
After step 11 use BootitNG to set active the partition immediately below the
dummy then boot PC normally. Remember this will shift everything down by 1.
So MBR Entry 1 becomes MBR Entry 2 and New Volume-2 becomes New Volume-3.

Also beware, if the PC has micro drives then remove the wire from the motherboard first, 
because the drive letter D: may be assigned to one of the micro drives.

Drive letter D: must be assigned to the data partition.
Upon first boot the drive letters should be assigned properly. 
Upon first boot, HD must boot alone without any other hard drives or flash drives attached.
Then shutdown PC and reconnect micro drives. 

If drive letter D: is not assigned to New Volume partition then:

click start >Right click computer >manage >disk management >
Right click on DVD or micro drive that has been assigned letter D: >
Change drive letter and paths >change >
Click drop down arrow and choose available drive letter >
Yes to warning about programs may not run correctly >Change New Volume to D:

Good Luck my disciples! 

May the force be with you!
