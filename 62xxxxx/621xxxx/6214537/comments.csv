,upstreamftw,2011-03-02T23:43Z,Have this working with open bittorrent tracker but tpb seems to be refusing it for some reason so their is infact a seed for this .. idk why its being dumb 
,upstreamftw,2011-03-02T23:47Z,"TPB isnt recognizing me as a seeder for some retarded reason, i do see this happening a lot with other ppl as well but w/e open bittorrent is recognizing me so should be fine."
,upstreamftw,2011-03-03T00:46Z,"Also something id like to add that im not able to due to not being allowed to edit torrent, is that this is for the 4.2U NTSC Wii consoles not the PAL version I would change it if TPB would allow me to do so. :D"
