is anyone having problems with their download speed i installed the latest  version of torrenz and ive gone from been able to download a 700mb movie in 20mins to around 2hrs any help would be great"
,kuranfowler,2011-03-03T11:37Z,"@powerful38: In regards to download speed; calibrate your Johnson rods, quantify the magenta color, check your rack and peanut steering if you have it, and if you don't, then don't worry about it. Most importanty though be sure you're putting out at least thirteen thousand kajigga watts in order to ensure maximum butterscotch mobility."

,wackaday,2011-03-03T20:08Z,"DO NOT bother downloading this if you plan on playing it on a PS3, the audio is completely fucked! it's the same problem that FXG's upload of 'The Other Guys' had."
,torrentdlder,2011-03-03T22:16Z,"Hi FXG,
Im a big fan of ur work. But pleeeez move on from ""avi."" to ""mkv."" cuz the quality is a world of a difference. Ur rating would change from 9/10 to 10/10 or +1. I would'nt be surprised if u guys would become #1 in movie uploading.
Appreciate your work guys :)

P.S. pl don't mind the suggestion."

,johnderr,2011-03-09T16:22Z,"@FXG_Team

Thanks so much for the upload, the only problem i had was that i am on my university network and they were contacted by MediaSentry on behalf of Paramount Pictures under

'Unauthorized Distribution of the Copyrighted Motion Picture Entitled
       The Fighter' 

There's NOTHING they can really do to anyone else but i would advise that if anyone on a University Network wait until they go home as i have been banned from the internet and had a disciplinary hearing. 

Thanks anyway i still watched it. A/9 V/9 M/9"

Nice story. The conflict between career and personal goals is nicely portrayed by Mark Whalberg. Must watch.

Thanks FXG!"
,deeatoms,2011-03-12T09:10Z,"I also had problems with the audio when I tried to play it thru my ps3. I also had problems with the movie ""the other guys"" by fxg. Im just letting people know incase they are planning to play it thru the ps3. Other than that fxg has the best uploads. Thanks."
,jjbrinks,2011-03-13T01:15Z,Mediacom suspended my internet for this one. Paramount is watching for you.
