,ut1880h,2012-02-05T15:06Z,Thanks for the doing the conversion to mp3. [What did you use?] Thanks also for naming the files intelligently and including track numbers and cover art. Many uploaders ignore the state of the tags and the downloaders have to fix them up if they want an organized library.
