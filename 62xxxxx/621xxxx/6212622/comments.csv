,Aizou,2011-03-02T08:59Z,"@ NOX55: I trust EZTV and I watch those dramas from EZTV through VLC player on mac and Power DVD player PC with English subtitles... I didn't have any problem with that... May be you have headphone's cable problem or you don't have DiVX codec or something... By the way, I trust EZTV...

@EZTV: Thank you, mate..."
