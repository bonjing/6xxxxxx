"US President Barack Obama has condemned the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters by Muammar Gaddafi's regime, calling it "outrageous and unacceptable."

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also censured the Libyan government's severe suppression of Libyans and called for an end to the â€œbloodshedâ€ in the North African country.

To learn more on the latest developments in the Arab world, Press TV has conducted an interview with renowned academician Professor Noam Chomsky who says the US and its allies have vested interests in stable dictatorships in energy rich countries rather than real democracies."
