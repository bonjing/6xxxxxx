This package contains The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblvion + Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles addons.

CorkScrews are prepackaged wine prefixes inspired by the "Wine bottle" of
Crossover (cxgames.). This package was built using ArchLinux and also tested on Ubuntu 10.04, it should work properly on any Linux distribution with wine installed.

To install the game run oblivion_installer.sh. This will extract the archive to ~/.wine/wineprefixes/TES4_Oblivion. 

IMPORTANT: If you experience issues running the game at first, try chaning the resolution in the options menu to your monitors native resolution before launching the game. Alternativly you can run "WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine/wineprefixes/TES4_Oblivion winecfg" from a terminal and configure the bottle to run in a virtual desktop.

To launch the game execute the script located in ~/bin, either by double clicking on it, or from a terminal enter: ~/bin/oblvivion . I reccomend adding $HOME/bin to your $PATH, especially if you want to use more then one corkscrew. A desktop launcher is not included with this release, but you can easily make one yourself.

To uninstall delete the TES4_Oblvion folder in ~/.wine/wineprefixes.

I encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other applications and games. This package along with the installer can be freely redistributed and/or modified only by qualified software pirates. If you are happy to see a game or program you like running on linux be sure to let the developers know. 

For other packages just search "CorkScrew" on your favorite torrenting site.
