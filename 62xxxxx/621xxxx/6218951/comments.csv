,sqlife,2011-03-05T18:56Z,"Way too many leechers atm. But thank you for the upload, will definitely get around to it when even downloading the sample file is possible. "
,Midfrost,2011-03-05T19:07Z,"People, stop downloading and remove, seed! This is the slowest connection I've ever gotten from Top 100. It's only bloody 600KB/s! I usually have 12MB/s!

Cmon now, don't limit your uploads!"
,DontPissMeOff,2011-03-05T19:25Z,"@Midfrost
I'm glad for your internet bandwith, but be aware that not everyone has such a good connection. I can download at 700kb/s  maximum and my max. upload speed is something around 50kb/s. I can't do anything about it - my internet provider says there is no technical possibility to increase my speed. Thus, if 600kb/s is too slow for you, maybe try to buy a BlueRay disc instead of donwloadin this one, ha?"
,Midfrost,2011-03-05T20:06Z,"@DontPissMeOff
The issue isn't that people have low-standard connections, the issue that they're severely limiting their upload rate. If 320 people would upload at 50, that'd be 16k.
But as of writing this, I'm getting 430KB/s from 112 seeds and countless leechers.
Even if I'm past all these leechers in percentage, that's still 430 / 112. If it wheren't for the fact that from a single Swedish IP I'm getting ~200KB/s. So that leaves 230KB/s split over 111 people.
Honestly, are people still using 26k baud modems?"
,gvim,2011-03-06T01:49Z,"Amazing how many of you are being whining little bitches. You are getting something for free. If you don't like the speed go down to your nearest shop and pay the exorbitant price to buy it. Otherwise... STFU.

BOZX. +1 to you mate. This is gonna get me an epic gobby from the mrs."
,mkvluv,2011-03-06T03:05Z,this movie a naturally blurry & grainy as the director intended. i don't think it's worth the 14gb 1080p. i doubt anyone will be able to see the difference from the 4gb 720p rip
,ultimagic,2011-03-06T03:23Z,"@Midfrost
you should not surprised with this kind of torrent.
maybe you are new to download the 1080p rips."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T05:07Z,i think its dumb using crap film techniques.  this is the HD era why use these crap grain film techniques.
,ultimagic,2011-03-06T12:19Z,"if the film is in early 50's below, it's good to use a grainy techniques."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T15:57Z,The Hurt Locker was also shot on 16mm film and that was very grainy.

,X45JKD,2011-03-06T17:51Z,"Just wanted to say thanks again. Keep up the good work, BOZX! This is an awesome upload!

As for a director's decision to have a more gritty grainy look to a film, I think it gives the movie a more immediate feel, like a home movie.

If you compare this to a 720p rip, you'll notice that some grains are missing :P - but seriously, don't you want to see ALL of the grains as the director intended?"
,timdezot,2011-03-06T21:40Z,"this is not really 1080p
cuz the height is 800px

this is true 1080p, he just removed the black bar of top and bottom."

u know why? 4 including sample
no one else did that in 1080p version
at least u know what u downloading
THANX A LOT"
,free2flie,2011-03-11T03:53Z,BOZX. Never ceases to amaze me. Thanks
,TheAre1973,2011-03-11T19:03Z,when will people realize MKV is fuckin grainy and MP4 is superior to it. Stop using MKV! no wonder Steve Jobs wants to kill flash. 
,mkvluv,2011-03-13T18:12Z,"@ultimagic: the move is in the CURRENT ERA, fool! they were using cell phone in the movie.

@TheAre1973: MKV is a container, not a codec. do your research before you post, idiot."
,gregorymendoza,2011-03-14T02:24Z,SEED MOTHERFOCKERS!!!
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-03-18T09:07Z,"Man, I've tested four releases of this title.
- Black.Swan.2010.Blu-ray.RE.x264.720p.DTS.MySilu
- Black.Swan.2010.Blu-ray.RE.x264.1080p.DTS.MySilu
- Black.Swan.2010.BluRay.720p.DTS.x264-CHD
- Black.Swan.2010.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD

When I watched the 720p screener of this, I didn't realize how much grain there is in this film. It's quite insane, actually, not just luma noise but lots of chroma noise, too. So much, in fact, that both of the MySilu versions are really way under the required bitrate. They look smudged and full of ugly artifacts. The 720p almost looks like a DVD rip with the 1080p at times looking like a bad 720p rip.

The CHD ones are (obviously, with their immense filesizes) much nicer to look at. Very little artifacts, and the noise is sharp and noisy rather than blurry.

Now the question is whether there's so much noise there that you actually gain enough from a 1080p version to justify its large filesize. It's close to not being so, actually. The grain is just so prominent, that to some extent, what you're actually gaining with the higher resolution isn't so much picture detail as it's prettier noise!

Me, I like noise, so I've gone with the 1080p CHD release. But if you want high detail without blur yet not spend the extra gigs required for that massive 14-gigger, and you're considering the MySilu 1080p one just because it's 1080p, my advice to you is: Don't. Get the CHD 720p instead. It's more detailed than the 1080p MySilu, because that one is just getting terrible smudging effects from the codec not having enough bits to produce much more than blur.

Actually, I'd say the 14GB CHD is pretty much around the sweet spot for 1080p. Much less and quality would start to suffer."
,ultimagic,2011-03-21T15:26Z,"@mkvluv
i didn't say THIS FILM is early 50's. i'm just saying, you know what i mean?"
,Tbone321,2011-03-22T06:35Z,"@s0mnambul1st

If the file is over 4gb you have to split it. PS3 doesn't support video files larger. So under the File Splitting drop down, select FAT32 (4GB). If that's not your problem then idk o_O. Lemme know if it was tho."

Professional Review"
,kornchild2002,2011-03-27T15:07Z,"The PS3 supports files larger than 4GB, you can stream them using a media server or ever host the content and download it to the PS3's hard drive using the media server.  The issue is that the PS3 does not recognize file systems beyond FAT and FAT32, that is where the 4GB file size limit comes into play.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the file system used with the PS3's internal hard drive.

As for the grain, that was intended.  Many directors are either still shooting on film or they digitally insert grain (ala 300).  They do this as it gives the movie a gritty feeling.  The streets of Gotham in The Dark Knight looked great with a thin layer of grain and I couldn't imagine them any other way.  Even The Social Network used grain in many scenes to emphasize the setting (small college dorms, a bar, etc.).

Not every movie is supposed to look pristine and it is exactly what the director's intended, get over it.  But meh, meh, meh, I doesn't wunt teh grane!  Fuck off.  I am tired of hearing people complain about the grain in high def releases when it is mostly intentional and adds so much to the experience.  Black Swan would not look the same without the grain and the characters would all look like plastic dolls.

As for this release, it looks pretty good and will likely hold me over until they release a more comprehensive version of the movie. It is my understanding that there are a handful of special features on the retail Blu-ray release but they are holding back even more content."
,ael00,2011-03-28T10:51Z,"@Timdezot If you weren't a complete retard you'd notice that the movie wasn't shot at 16:9. So.. if you wanted a movie 1920 by 1080p, you would need to alter the pixel aspect ratio - which 264x does not support. OR you could change to divX/XviD which are crap at size/quality ratio compared to x264.

So this is in fact full HD. Get your fucking facts right next time you bash a quality torrent."
,eluent,2011-04-08T20:43Z,"Thx.
The video in the sample looks good. Yet you didn't use the most demanding scene, far from it. Which makes it all the more harder to evaluate and compare without downloading the 14GB..

The pic on http://pic.phyrefile.com/i/iu/iuyiyiy/2011/03/04/01.png seems to indicate that this version does better on what other, lighter, versions seem to crawl, tough : face close-up.

Please next time choose a more significant scene, and one that doens't come as late in the movie (afaik this scene appears quite late in the movie."
,eluent,2011-04-09T00:44Z,"Now that I've donwloaded it, it is clear that unless you watch your movie with a microscope, you won't notice any improvement over these under 5GB versions :
