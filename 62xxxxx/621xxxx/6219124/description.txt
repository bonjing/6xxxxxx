About Activiti 5.3

The first version of the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN 1.0) is from 2004 and helped the Business Process Managers and Business Process Analysts to model their business processes. Programmers and developers used WS-BPEL 2.0. BPMN 2.0 defines one language for modeling business processes and making them executable on a process engine without the need of conversion.

Tom Baeyens and Joram Barrez, the former leaders of jBPM now working for Alfresco, started the Activiti project to create this superb BPMN 2.0 process engine. Half a year later Activiti 5.0 was released. Activiti is lightweight and has a very clean and open API.

Big thanks for all the hard work!
