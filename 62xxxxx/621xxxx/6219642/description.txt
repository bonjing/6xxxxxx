22 year old Seth (Rocco Reed) awakes one morning to find Jessica (jessica drake) a mysterious and beautiful woman moving in next door. When Jessica catches him spying on her while having sex, she gets him to do odd jobs for her around the house. But it turns out that she's more interested in having a young stud to mentor than to do hard labor. And for Seth, it's a dream come true, especially when he discovers her true identity. Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction...and a whole lot sexier!
