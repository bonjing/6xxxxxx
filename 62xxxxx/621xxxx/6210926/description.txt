Dr. Vasi invents a super-powered robot, Chitti,
in his own image. The scientific body, AIRD    
, that must approve the robot, declines it     
based on its not having emotions and the abilit
to make rational judgment. A sudden flash of   
lightning evokes emotions in the robot, and    
Chitti is seemingly ready for integration into 
the human world. Then, Chitti falls in love    
with Dr. Vasi's fiancÃ©e Sana and turns on his  
creator.
