Take surf music, add the Ventures, feed Quicksilver Messenger Service some Happy Trails 'shrooms, request Soft Machine as backup band, catch an Iron Butterfly, ask Big Brother and the Holding Company to make up something quick cuz Janis Joplin has left the building; mix this up, drink some red wine, have a smoke and let the jams tickle your spine...
