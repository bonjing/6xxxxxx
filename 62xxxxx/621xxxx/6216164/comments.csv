,rogerthis,2011-04-01T01:27Z,Many thanks for the upload Raymondhome - great quality. Poor reviews put me off this at cinema but I think the critics were way off. I really enjoyed the film - it shoots for a mostly honest and fun take on the genre. Paul Rudd gets most of the laughs - he's becoming a bit of a comic legend.
