""Just"" HDTVRip though, waiting for the BD Release of the collection in Fall :-)"
,GarudaBKK,2011-03-11T02:38Z,"As always, you have the best releases in my eyes. I saw you had problems to encode in AAC, any idea what to do? Because as it is now, there is no sound on WD TV, neither on stereo nor on digital output.

Cheers"
,dude8888,2011-03-13T18:53Z,"Only Downloaded Episode IV so far
A=8, V=8, M=10
I believe this is the best rip out there 
(there are also no TV station logos in the corners)

can't wait for Bluray this Fall!!"

Thats why nowadays, ppl understands that there's should be a video player, and an audio player installed on their computer ;) (Give VLC or GOM a try, you'll say goodbye to iCrap)"
