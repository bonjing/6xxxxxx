maybe u should stick to licking your dogs balls and not uploading ur shitty crappy torrents!!!!!"
,ArtieT,2011-03-17T11:24Z,"Oh Kian, give it a rest on the other torrent comment pages, eh?  Looking at your uploads it seems like no-one wants them, which is genuinely sad, but don't take your jealousy and frustration out on good uploaders/encoders like 20-40.  You should put your own house in order before criticizing others. Why not start by sorting out your internet connection before trying to u/l over 2Gig torrents?? 

You're transparently one of those chippy newbies who start by trying to contradict the 
experts 'ftw'. Sadly, there seems to be more of these people thanks to the internet school of 'knew it already' (motto: never back down).  Well, that way you will have lots of arguments and learn little. Why not instead say 'great work' and maybe politely ask 'how did you do that?' Someone actually did that and 20-40 has even been good enough to share his toolkit, if you want to spend your time constructively by searching for it...

You should hope people treat you better as an encoder in future...but that would require 
that they start with humility to the goal of respect, not with arrogance to total domination, which seems to be your foolish goal. Think about it."

you havnt even downloaded it .
i re encoded them for ipod cuz there where none like that
and i encoded it for ppl who love the show and miss it
specially for the oldtimers with ipods

i arranged the subtitles which were messed up in the source 
and i made everything perfect 
and you know what 
you wont see my name on any of that shit 

When you are gonna put it in you ipod or iphone you'll see 'Charles Addams' the guy who created the characters .
and by god it'll feel good when you'll see it like that in your ipod , try that if you have any"
