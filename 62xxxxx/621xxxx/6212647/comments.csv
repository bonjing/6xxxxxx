[T],stevekasian,2011-03-04T04:16Z,"Thanks for the share Psysive.

To be clear though, sharing 2 or 3 things on TPB doesn't give you cart blanche to request anything your little heart desires.

So put a sock in it, would ya?

Thanks,
Steve"

[T],stevekasian,2011-03-06T03:40Z,";-)  I've come across nothing worth uploading for quite some time here. It seems everything worthwhile has already been shared.

Hey, I really like your little pronunciation guide to your username there. Very helpful."
