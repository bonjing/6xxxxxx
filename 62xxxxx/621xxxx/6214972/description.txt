"Three Cheers for the Cheated" is the second studio album by the band "Fancy Trash". The album has a folksy vibe, and while folk isn't really my thing, the music is pretty good, and the lyrics are fairly exceptional. Lyrics that are not dumb are kind of rare these days, and they go a long way towards making a good album.

I came across this CD in the basement of a record store in New York City. I picked it up because I thought it was interesting, and I'm very glad I did. I've been unable to find this album on any torrent sites, and it's really worth putting out there. These guys deserve to have better exposure.

Note: My ISP has been throttling torrent traffic and closing ports on us, and I only own a laptop that I move around with. This means that seeding will be intermittent, but I will not abandon this torrent (at least not for a very long time from now). Have patience.
