Really Good quality rip for a PPV and a very watchable copy...
Thanx to IwannaFan2 and IFLIX for the Decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a really quick download...:)"
,vsjane,2011-03-04T15:55Z,Nice file that I do thank you for but at the same time offer my disgust with the gratuitous advertisement hard coded into the file at the end.
,cigaretteburns,2011-03-04T19:26Z,The advert at the end is unavoidable. It is nothing to do with the original file sharer or uploader. These adverts are hardcoded by the TV supplier (hotel chain etc). Great upload (terrible film!). Thanks IWannaFan2.
