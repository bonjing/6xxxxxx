,DrSmitzel,2011-03-09T23:22Z,The video is good. But the Audio is crakling? Not sure if this on your end or mine. Does anyone else have this problem? 
,dj-test,2011-03-10T15:09Z,"No problems with video or sound. Colors look like some sort of 70s movie, but way better than any other version. In some instances it seems like the movie is cut for a second or two, maybe some sort of quick editing for PPV.

I think this is the only real ppvrip, the one from imagine is recorded in an angle and heads are cut."
,nuthing11,2011-03-20T23:21Z,"Good quality audio & video, some minor skips. But beware- this torrent was tracked by my local ISP and I received a warning letter for sharing it after only 6 hours online. Is there any way around this?"
