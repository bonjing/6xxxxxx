,Fangular,2011-03-03T18:27Z,"Cool.. what else is in your top ten favourite movies, 2040?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-03T19:16Z,"@Fangular: In weeks before last Xmas I uploaded I  think a majority of my bucket-list (I was damn sure that my time runs out).

Surprisingly (kidding), these movies have been downloaded maybe few dozen times and as always, they lost battle against magnificent movies with Dolph Lundgren or with Jackie Chan and few more prestigious actors.

I am sure that my personal taste is very very different from majority around here, but I would stubbornly continue with the rest of few my favored, beloved and precious ones. 

I do not need clapping audience for that, this matter and choices have been explained right here, in more than thousand words and more than few dozen times and are personal as can get."
,froglog,2011-03-03T22:47Z,Thanks
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-04T00:40Z,"In case anybody's interested (I like ""lists"" in case you couldn't tell!), my favorite movies of all time (and kept me sane through my divorce 13 years ago):

Hopscotch - (Walter Mathau, Glenda Jackson, Sam Waterston) romantic spy comedy
Down Periscope - comedy
Last Of The Mohicans - romantic adventure
Starship Troopers - SciFi, 1st part follows book fairly close
Hackers - hard to classify
Sneakers - hard to classify
Invitation To The Wedding - mild romantic comedy, last movie Ralph Richardson was in
Love Is Forever - romantic biographic thriller
10 Things I Hate About You - modern retelling of Taming Of The Shrew
Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves - Romantic drama"
,the_shroud,2011-03-04T01:10Z,"Can't seem to make lists. Once in a while a film comes to mind and that's the one for now. Right now its 
""Strange Days"" directed by Katheryn Bigelow (Hurt Locker) and written by then husband James Cameron (Avatar)
Next to Blade Runner its my fav SciFi with its noir mystery, gritty execution but most of all its SciFi concepts really f*&ked my mind.
Can't find a good copy around much less a small sized one.
How did you rate that film?"
,micmac33,2011-03-04T01:24Z,"Thanks a lot, excellent quality 10/10."
,ladderman22,2011-03-04T01:36Z,Only cause you say its good ;)
,theaetetus,2011-03-04T05:05Z,"Thanks for this. Just watched it, and found it to be quite good.

But then I did some research, and it turns out that this is probably one of those cases in which the director's cut is worse than the original thatrical release: the director's cut is shorter by half an hour.

Unfortunately, the theatrical release hasn't been released on BluRay."
,muk0690,2011-03-04T08:22Z,"Will definitely download this. Thanks twentyforty.
I love that personal taste of yours."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-04T17:03Z,"@the_shroud: It's a kind of heresy comparing these two movies. One is typical example of very very good idea translated into phantasmagoric script and ruined by silly directing. We all KNOW that Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett and  Juliette Lewis are first echelon of actors - but in that movie - they act as - idiots. Who is to blame - we all know too well.

Oh, other one is Blade Runner, a masterpiece, in every possible aspect.

I, unfortunately have BluRay of Strange Days and I can encode 480p or 720p, just let me know which version you want."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-04T17:22Z,"@theaetetus : Theatrical Cut (1h58) - 18 minutes longer is available as Revenge 1990 1080i HDTV x264 DD2.0 but it's 6.68 GB and therefore not anyone's cup of tea. Also, quite a lot of people have great problems with playback of 1080p. I have this one, I watched both versions, but encoded one I have. Basically, both versions are equally good."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-04T17:57Z,"@theaetetus : ... and DC (this one) has spicier scenes inserted, TC is sanitized but have more sentimental ending (a little). Also, HDTV stream was technically incorrect and therefore not very suitable for ripping."
,the_shroud,2011-03-04T19:33Z,"720 would be brilliant.... at least for me that is. 
Thx anyway whether u decide to up it or not.
Much appreciated"
,theaetetus,2011-03-04T20:00Z,"@twentyforty: Ha! The first time I saw Strange Days, it made a big impression, but then when I watched it a second time a couple of years ago, I was disappointed. And of course, one would expect Strange Days not to be a masterpiece, given that The Hurt Locker is so mediocre.

I've read enough about the ""extra"" scenes in the theatrical release of Revenge for it to not be worth my while to watch that, for the time being, anyway.

I'm very fortunate that there is someone who does and uploads excellent HD rips who has similar tastes to my own. :)"
