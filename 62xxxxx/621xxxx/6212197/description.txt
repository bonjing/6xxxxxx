                Drama series. In an effort to boost her Silk
                application, Martha accepts a rape case, against her
                better judgement. Even worse, Clive is prosecuting
                her client and delights in riling Martha. As the case
                draws to a close, Martha begins to realise that
                things are not always black and white, especially
                when she makes a startling discovery.
