Do all adults experience memory difficulties as they age? What is the difference between normal memory change and the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease? Is it possible to stem -- or even reverse -- memory decline? This up-to-date book is a comprehensive guide for everyone who wishes to learn the scientific facts about how aging affects memory and what can or cannot be done about it. Gilles Einstein and Mark McDaniel, widely respected for their research and popular lectures on memory, offer a lively overview of how memory works and how memory processes change with age. They then approach the topic of memory improvement, drawing on the latest rigorous scientific evidence and sprinkling their advice with anecdotes and graphics to illustrate major concepts. Organized for accessibility, focused on practical and concrete techniques, and filled with reliable information (including suggested Web sites for more information on topics of particular interest), this book is today's best guide to memory and to verified ways of dealing with its decline..................
