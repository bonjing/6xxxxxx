Blutch and Chesterfield get away from the 22nd Cavalry and go spend some R and R at Fort Bow, their old posting on the frontier. Thats where Chesterfields flame Amelia lives, the daughter of Colonel Appleton. But when the cavalrymen arrive, they find the young lady dancing with a dashing young lieutenant. When a young Native American boy gets mixed up in it by mistake, it doesnt take long for the situation to spiral out of control.
