But other than that, thanks for uploading."

,zoepi,2011-05-19T07:39Z,"Great set.  However, does anyone know how to fix the audio synch?  On playback, my audio is at least 5 seconds out of synch with the video?  I've tried several differenct CODEC's and players and no success.  

Also, running Windows 7x64."
,murfinator,2011-06-03T21:19Z,BEAUTIFULL TORRENT i loved it sadly the story is now over :s :D
,blackharu,2011-07-14T15:34Z,"Really? I'd expect anyone over the age of 12 to want it in Japanese. English dub actors just aren't that great. Personally, the only dub I like is DBZ."
,Glorz,2011-12-16T22:55Z,is this original show? with the kid with his puzzle necklace and stuff? 
,fairy12me,2012-02-17T20:44Z,"files are 222 but the episodes are supposed to be 224, how?"
,KanixD,2012-02-27T14:09Z,"Great torrent, however once you get to the Japanese (English subbed) episodes it completely ruins the experience. My nostalgic marathon was sadly cut short."
,nukesub,2012-05-18T13:23Z,also detecting trojans in this file...
