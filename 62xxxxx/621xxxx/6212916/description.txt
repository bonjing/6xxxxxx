Franklin Mint Records - The Greatest Jazz Recordings of All Time Vol. 95. I will be uploading the complete 100 record set that I recorded from vinyl a few years back and decided to share these because they are out of print/pressing/circulation and never came out on cd. This is a 7zip rar file. Please seed & Enjoy!

**Note**
On the album, Blues Parts 1 & 2 are one whole track. Here, I have separated them into two tracks and that is the reason there are 14 tracks in the download.
