      More fast-paced sketches, favourite characters and arresting
      visuals from Limmy. Adventure phone-in host Falconhoof is asked
      about a spot of charity work. We meet the Secret Agents who try
      to outwit each other in a poisonous situation. And zoned-out
      waster Dee Dee has an encounter with a laughing cow. Plus Limmy
      learns a new word, relives the golden age of games and battles a
      malevolent room in his house.
