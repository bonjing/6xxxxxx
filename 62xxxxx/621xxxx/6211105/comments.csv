,moshster,2011-03-01T15:32Z,1876x1080??  Anyone confirm if this has black borders on left and right?
,somedude.1001,2011-03-01T17:29Z,weird aspect ratio.
,xiIix,2011-03-01T19:10Z,"That is the oddest shit I've ever seen. I'll wait for a proper rip. I mean yes, it might be anal to give a shit about 44 pixels of width but, hey.. I guess I'm anal then. I don't like off the wall shit."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-01T21:24Z,"interesting cropping i guess.

1876 x 1080 = 1.73

1280 x 732 = 1.748

(values from their 720p)"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-01T21:40Z,sounds like the source was pillar boxed.  hdchina also odd framing.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-01T21:54Z,"if that was the case they could remove the pillar and crop...

44 pixels pillar

crop right 22
crop left 22

now remove too much pixels from top/bottom

crop top 12
crop bottom 12

gives you 1876x1056 = 16/9

now rebuild at 1920x1080 1.77:1 AR (scaling)

Will loose 24 pixels of real data.

Don't know if this is what the issue is/was here..."
,mkvluv,2011-03-02T02:51Z,"i'll wait for a proper 1080p rip. this movie is too good to be mutilated like this, lol"
,Skram0,2011-03-02T06:52Z,"http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Tangled-Blu-ray/18854/

It looks like the movie aspect ratio is 1.85:1
So the resolution should be close to 1920x1038
1920 / 1038 = 1.8497"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-02T07:28Z,hard telling until you have the real media in your hands with regards to what the disc really is and how its encoded on disc.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-02T16:10Z,i haven't watched this yet.  I suggest trying to find a ball or globe or a square in the video and snapshot it and then confirm that the result is actually a circle or a square.  If the known object is actually a circle or a square then the video is at the correct AR.  Dont concern yourself about the video sizing then.  Just my thoughts.  will see when scene releases there versions.
,somedude.1001,2011-03-02T19:41Z,"Yup, thats what I usually do, too. But the difference in this is so small 44/1920 or a little over 2%, so probably not noticeable unless said object is very big."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-03T01:15Z,"ar of the film is correct.

at 46 seconds the 0 in 50 is basically perfect.

width 365 height 361

at 16:9 ar the width is 374.  Not a perfect circle."
,moshster,2011-03-05T21:56Z,"Holy crap.  The 1280x746 I have also has thin balck bars left and right.  My Pioneer Kuro's blacks are so black I had not noticed the black bars against the black frame of the panel.  So, it looks like the 1920x1080 has been correctly cropped to 1876x1080 to take full advantage of 1080 vertically."
,k-line,2011-03-06T02:38Z,this movie looks amazing in 3d... too bad i don't have a 3d tv
,mischiefmaker,2011-03-06T15:52Z,"Every once in awhile, there is a black bar on the left side that expands and shrinks.

I have not checked the 720p versions, but I suspect it's also there.

Any explanation?

Thanks!

Btw,Tangled.2010.BluRay.1080p.x264.DTS-LTT is 1920 px wide and 1.85:1 but it looks like that one is simply a stretched and re-encoded version of this based on comparisons of the 0 in ""Disney 50 years"". That version also has the same expanding and shrinking black bar on the left."
,pzoned,2011-03-06T15:56Z,"The source of this rip is from the 3D version of the blu-ray, that is why there are borders. 

Will wait for a rip from the 2D Blu-ray."
,xiIix,2011-03-11T19:03Z,"It's odd to me that nobody has released another 1080p version orf this. I'm just going to buy the bluray disc to be honest. This movie was fucking awesome so I don't mind paying for it. For what it's worth the 720p version of this was really clean for being 720p. One of the best 720p rips I've ever seen, but I want the real deal so I'm just gonna go out and buy the disc itself. I'm hoping there are some behind the scenes stuff too, because this film was insanely expensive. Most expensive animated film in history, and second most expensive film in history animated or not. 260 million to make it. And I'm betting that at least a third of that money went into Rapunzel's hair. Hair is SO HARD to get right in these animations, and this is by far the best hair I've seen yet."
,pzoned,2011-03-11T23:14Z,"@xiIix

If you do, would you make the rip we both desire? I'd buy it myself since it's not like $20 is asking a lot for a quality film, but I don't own a blu-ray drive for my PC. :(

And yes, a film only has value to me if I can see it in my beautiful XBMC library. :)"
