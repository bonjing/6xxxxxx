,freshmen,2011-03-25T04:19Z,"There is a ""No input file specified"" error."
,PhoenixRG,2011-03-25T13:17Z,@ freshman in which episode of which season.
,kheady,2011-04-01T06:12Z,"@ PhoenixRG, the ""No input file specified"" error that freshman mentioned, is the error you get when trying to download the .torrent file.  I get the same error when I click on the download link. I've never seen this error before when trying to download a .torrent file from piratebay. It's only on this torrent that I'm getting the error.  Any ideas?"

,Laith_88,2011-09-03T01:48Z,In season 4 the video pauses and skips forward a few seconds and sometimes a few minutes. Does anyone know why this is? It hasn't happened in season 3 and I got it from this torrent too.
,PhoenixRG,2012-02-21T04:27Z,@ Laith try using mpc or KMPlayer
