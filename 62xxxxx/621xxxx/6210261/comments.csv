can you consider ups that are normal format that can be put straight onto a usb then watched on tv, no fromatting required???"

,montmarte,2011-03-01T07:35Z,"maybe quick to download, but is there a fast way to convert so as to put on a usb so i can watch on tv???"
,montmarte,2011-03-01T07:37Z,"it iquick to download, but no faster than any  other format....is there a way to convert rar to watch on tv via usb stick, rather than just unzipping and then watching on laptop???"
