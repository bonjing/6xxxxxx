Blasto was a third-person shooter game developed by Sony Interactive and published by Sony Computer Entertainment America for the Sony PlayStation in 1998. Although heavily marketed the game proved too difficult for many gamers. â€œThereâ€™s a good game here â€“ itâ€™s just simply hidden under many layers of frustration.â€ The late Phil Hartman had voiced Captain Blasto, an extremely muscular, alien-fighting, dimwitted captain whoâ€™s always in the mood for a babe from any solar system most specifically in the Planet Uranus.

GAMEPLAY:
The game was a third-person action/platform/shooter. The enemies are aliens that teleport in around the player based on events that are triggered as the player explores the environment. The game had a strong platform element with elements such as rotating 3D sections which have to be navigated while shooting at aliens. Puzzle elements tend to be limited to simple â€œFind The Switch To Proceedâ€ scenarios. However, some of the elements within the game require the player to utilize different weaponry in certain situations in order to advance to the next area.

PLOT:
After returning from the 5th dimension, a diabolical tyrant alien named Bosc is bent on conquering the Planet Uranus with his own army and attempts to invade and destroy Earth as well. He is seeking to reign supreme for his power of the solar system that includes his alien army capturing and enslaving the Space Babes throughout the galaxy.
