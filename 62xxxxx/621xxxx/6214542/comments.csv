,SomewhatSkeptic,2011-03-04T19:26Z,"Yes, it's real. Thanks to uploader, seeders, and Kurzweil of course. Now I want to see Plug & Pray."
,SomewhatSkeptic,2011-03-04T19:29Z,"Also, keep an eye on a few things for the future: development of strong AI / artificial generalized intelligence (AGI), YouTube: juan+enriquez+life+code, YouTube:supramolecular+self-assembler, EPFL's Blue Brain Project, Stanford's Brains in Silicon

www ted com is also amazing for all sorts of shit"
,SomewhatSkeptic,2011-03-04T22:21Z,"Also, NOVA scienceNOW has some cool futuristic stuff. Neil deGrasse Tyson is no Carl Sagan, but he's not too shabby for public TV. Never saw anything with Krulwich.."

I cant wait to be a fucking robot."
,kissing_hitler,2011-03-23T20:57Z,"As a fan of the whole singularity/Kurzweil thang I was very disappointed with this.
It offered nothing new."

Quality is amazing.

This is one of the better documentaries I've seen in a while. It offers a great non bias view of Kurzweil's predictions. You can draw your own conclusions. Scary yet thought provoking stuff. Definitely worth a watch. It's prompted me to read his book in fact. 
Cheers Jappe2, awesome upload."
,Andy_14,2011-04-13T13:14Z,"If this topic interests you you may be interested in watching lectures by Aubrey de Grey a scientist working to find therapies that will reverse the effects of aging. De Grey asserts that it is possible that the first people who will live to be 150+ years old are already alive today and that these people will be vital and productive, not frail and weak."
