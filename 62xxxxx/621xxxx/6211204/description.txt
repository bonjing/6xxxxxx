The Intro:
It doesnâ€™t matter if you love him, or capital h-i-m
Just put your paws up
â€˜Cause you were born this way baby

The Verse:
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
â€œThereâ€™s nothin wrong with lovin who you areâ€
She said, â€œâ€™cause he made you perfect, babeâ€
â€œSo hold your head up girl and youâ€™ll go far,
Listen to me when I sayâ€

The Chorus:
Iâ€™m beautiful in my way
â€˜Cause god makes no mistakes
Iâ€™m on the right track baby

Donâ€™t hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and youâ€™re set
Iâ€™m on the right track baby
I was born this way

The Post-chorus:
Ooo there ainâ€™t no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooo there ainâ€™t no other way

Verse:
Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure

I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (love needs faith)

The Bridge:
Donâ€™t be a drag, just be a queen
Whether youâ€™re broke or evergreen
Youâ€™re black, white, beige, chola descent
Youâ€™re lebanese, youâ€™re orient
Whether lifeâ€™s disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
â€˜Cause baby you were born this way
No matter gay, straight, or bi,
Lesbian, transgendered life
Iâ€™m on the right track baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
Iâ€™m on the right track baby
I was born to be brave

Repeat the chorus
