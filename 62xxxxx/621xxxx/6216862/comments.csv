[V],jainmehul,2011-03-03T23:06Z,"^^
this is the real iTunesRip... i just have converted them to VBR - V0 which is better option.. converting them to 320kbps is not good (It will degrade the quality)"

,blackey83,2011-03-18T11:09Z,awsome dl bra even better album please support lupe though and by this record
,phrend,2011-03-19T04:38Z,"Thanks forthe up, but I'm confused... if the source was iTunes, why not leave them in Apple's m4a/aac format and avoid the ""generation loss"" from conversion to mp3?

The info also states that the ripper was EAC, but isn't that for ripping from disc?  Did the uploader download the album from the iTunes store, burn to disc, then rip to mp3?

...just trying to figure out the source of this rip."
,HoslerG,2011-03-25T09:28Z,This album is GOD! Thank you!

,limited305,2011-04-07T05:59Z,Lupe Fiasco and B.o.B.  - Proving Hip Hop is not dead yet
,herbaltea,2011-04-26T07:21Z,"This is shocking, I previously downloaded ""The show goes on"" as a single through a different torrent and the comparison of the sound quality is dreadful, the 320 kbps verson (Which was a previous download) compared to the one in here is really bad, the songs in this seem really quite, muffled and I have good speakers, I deleted this instantly and I'll be waiting for a better download. Thanks anyway Jainmehul,
Could be just me, I do look for the best quality in music."
