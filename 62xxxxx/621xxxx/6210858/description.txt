Indie Sun Recordings presents the debut single â€œPtakhaâ€ from a talented Russian folk / industrial / rock newcomer Risha!

The single features three original tracks (â€œPtakhaâ€, â€œMaslenitsaâ€ and â€œGolubkaâ€) delivered by three talented musicians: Irina â€œRishafoxâ€ Lvova (vocals), known for her work as cellist / back vocal with countless Russian bands and projects (Tut Kak Tut, Vespercellos, Deform, Tracktor Bowling, etc.), and two members of Deform â€“ Andrey â€œOstravâ€ Ostrav (guitars, programming) and Alexandr Suprun (drums).

Seamlessly blending authenic Russian folk songs with elements of electronics and grooving industrialized guitars, Risha manage to create their own unique sound. It is sure to appeal both to fans of folk metal and fans of industrial metal as well as those looking for something fresh and quite unconventional.
