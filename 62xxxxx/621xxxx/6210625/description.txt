           At the Edge of the World chronicles the controversial Sea      
           Shepherd Antarctic Campaign against a Japanese whaling         
           fleet. The international volunteer crew, under-trained         
           and under-equipped, develop a combination of bizarre and       
           brilliant tactics with which to stop the whalers. But          
           first they must find the Japanese ships, a far more            
           difficult challenge than ever imagined - long-time             
           activist Paul Watson and first-time captain Alex               
           Cornelissen employ an array of strategies in the hopes of      
           finding an elusive adversary in the vast expanse of the        
           Ross Sea. With one ship (the Farley Mowat) too slow to         
           chase down the whaling fleet, with their second ship (the      
           Robert Hunter) unsuited for Antarctic ice conditions and       
           with no country supporting their efforts to enforce            
           international law, the situation becomes increasingly          
           desperate. Against all odds, however, a real-life pirate       
           tale unfolds - a modern-day "David vs. Goliath"                
           adventure.
