,YZF-R1,2011-03-05T01:27Z,no worries! Now spread it around and let people know where to find it. The best way to fight censorship is to let everyone see the thing being censored! :)
,rsh1,2011-03-05T12:55Z,"Thank you very much for the upload. I agree we should spread anything that is supposed to be censored by authorities. We should teach them a lesson: if you want to censor something, you will just make it famous!"

,Eugenedlgza,2011-03-10T22:43Z,I cant Unzip it on a mac... can someone help me?.
,YZF-R1,2011-03-11T22:00Z,"@Eugenedlgza: I think the easiest way for you would be to simply install UnRarX (http://www.unrarx.com), it's supposed to be fairly easy to use.
Another option is to download the command-line tools directly from rarlabs.com, tutorial here (http://www.robertvenema.nl/journal/archive/howto-command-line-unrar-on-mac-os-x/)"
,Archangeldawn,2011-03-21T05:58Z,"I have heard about the censorship of this movie in Mexico. Seems they are just not rumors. Glad to see this being seeded ! Even if its .rar it's not a big deal, just unzip ,wait a few minutes , and watch."
,luisjose5,2011-03-23T01:37Z,A/V anyone???? Will download and post later...
,djmopa,2011-05-02T04:13Z,"One of my friends from Mexico city, who has moved to the United States a few years ago, gave me this movie to watch. I am glad I did. It's extremely sad and frustrating at the statistics and how many people are locked away in jail in Mexico who never did anything, but be at the wrong place, at the wrong time. If you have no money, there is no way to prove your innocents. In Mexico they put 20 people or more in one jail cell and do not feed anyone, if it was not for their loved ones, the people in jail would die from starvation.

I have visited Mexico over a dozen of times and have saw first hand the corruption that takes place there. I have witnessed policia and federales taking bribes.

Share this movie with your friends and family and let them know the truth about the corrupt Mexican Government and their evil ways."
