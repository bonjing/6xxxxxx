,11western,2011-06-02T04:07Z,"Don't know how to use this yet but following what ""simpleeda"" says it seems to work fine. I'm not sure if I did the reg file correct since it didn't come up with the apply box, But I've opened it up twice and no change so I guess it works.
Thanks Mno74 hope it's easier then autocad...lol"
