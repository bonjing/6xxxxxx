product description
===================
Alibre Design is an industrial-strength, affordable parametric solid modeling system. Create precise 3D mechanical designs and automatically generate and detail associative 2D drawings that update when the 3D model changes.

Alibre Design 2011 now makes 3D designing easier and more robust with major enhancements, including a complete top to bottom code re-write, native 64-bit version, powerful sheet metal conversion tools, and a myriad of time saving tools and customization features.


Feature comes in Alibre Design Expert
=====================================

Core Functionality - Model Creation and Documentation
-----------------------------------------------------
* 3D Model Creation
Get the idea to working prototype fast. Alibre Design offers a rich set of 3D modeling tools for the fast creation of complex geometry. Bottom-up and top-down design allows you to work efficiently. Everything you make is instantly editable, allowing for fast iterations.

* Surfacing Tools
Alibre Design Expert comes with Moment of Inspiration (MoI). Incredibly powerful and easy to use, MoI offers surfacing and rapid concept development capabilities so you can create more ergonomic, consumer friendly products.

* Sheet Metal Modeling
If your design calls for sheet metal Alibre Design offers advanced modeling tools that make it easy. Flanges, closed corners, complex lofts, dimples, and many other tools combined with instant flat patterns get accurate and fast results.

* Advanced Sheet Metal Modeling
Advanced sheet metal tools include: Conversion of normal or imported parts into unfoldable sheet metal parts, lofted flange creation, and contour flange creation. These tools fundamentally change sheet metal workflows, providing superior speed to the design process.

* 2D Documentation Creation
Turn any 3D model into a 2D drawing instantly. Comprehensive detailing tools make efficient work of fully conveying your intent. When you update your 3D model, all associated drawings update, including annontations, views, section views, etc.

* Design Configurations
If you work with parts that have variations on the same basic design then you need design configurations. Create variations of parts or assemblies and keep them in a single file. Simply choose which configuration you want to use at any point.

* Direct Editing Toolset
A toolset dedicated to working with geometry when feature history is not available. Easily change the sizes of holes, or move entire parts of the model around without editing a single feature. Perfect for working with imported parts or making last minute changes.

Extended Features for Workflow Improvements and Downstream Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* 2 Standard Part Libraries
Don't waste time modeling common components or waste money building things you can get off-the-shelf. Two part libraries offer millions of standard and manufacturer-specific components for every industry, all just a download away.

* Photorealistic Rendering
Show clients what they're getting before it's made and use it to win bids. Create compelling brochures to drive sales or create a beautiful virtual product line on a website. Rendering so easy you will be productive inside of 30 minutes with no previous experience, guaranteed.

* Document Management
The Alibre Vault provides complete document, process, and contact management. Supports every file type from Excel to PDF to 3D models. Easy to use with fast search and completely customizable to fit your business. Use it as a single user or deploy it across your organization.

* Alibre CAM
Fully integrated into Alibre Design, Alibre CAM offers machinists a fully loaded, completely parametric, auto-updating toolpath generating powerhouse. There are multiple levels of Alibre CAM. The basic version comes with Alibre Design Expert.

* Alibre Motion
Fully integrated into Alibre Design, Alibre Motion offers advanced motion analysis capabilities. Easily set up motion elements by reusing relationships you've already set up in the assembly. Graph things like a part's velocity, position, and many other things. You can also export movies.
