,keeza,2012-02-14T13:25Z,"Bought a Chinese Double DIN GPS online that had Route 66 installed but no maps and very bad lag.  Simply downloaded this and copied folder straight to the 2GB SD card supplied with the GPS.  Worked straight away, has fleet management, calculator, currency converter, the works.
Highly recommend this and am seeding unlimited."
