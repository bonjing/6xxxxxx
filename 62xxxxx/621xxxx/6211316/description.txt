Franklin Mint Records - The Greatest Jazz Recordings of All Time Vol. 97. I will be uploading the complete 100 record set that I recorded from vinyl a few years back and decided to share these because they are out of print/pressing/circulation and never came out on cd. This is a 7zip rar file. Please seed & Enjoy!
