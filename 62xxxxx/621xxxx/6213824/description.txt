Nationalistic Movement of Jammu Hindus against the terrorist-separatist-islamist-appeasing policy of secular napunsaka Indian and J&K governments. Since June the whole Jammu region spanning over 5 districts is boiling with Hindu anger to reclaim the Land for the usage by Amarnath Yatris earlier sold by the Government to the Hindu Shrine Board and then quickly taken back under pressure from the terrorist-communal Anti-Indian Muslims of Kashmiri Valley. The movement has become an outpour of accumulated Hindu anger and pride suppressed for decades by the Jehadi-Secular nexus in Kashmir and rest of India. Brave Hindus of Jammu will not take it any more! Bam Bam Bhole! Om Namah Shivaya! Vande Mataram! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!!!
