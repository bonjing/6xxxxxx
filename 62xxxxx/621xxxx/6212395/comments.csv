,bert16,2011-03-08T05:11Z,How do you activate this thing? Are you including a loader or do we just use one of the thousands out there and hope for the best?
,Straydog1st,2011-03-08T15:47Z,"@ bert16,

You didn't read the text saying there is a loader in it, simple and easy. And yes, there are really hundred available, some better some worse. You are free to choose because the OSs are not touched."
,bert16,2011-03-10T04:09Z,"@Straydog1st -- you're absolutely right, when I read the description I missed the part where it says ""with activator"" (I assume you're using a version of Daz Loader)."
,Straydog1st,2011-03-10T21:21Z,"Hi Berta,

In the torrent is a simpler one. If you prefer the one you say you can download it from one of the links on his post, here:

IÂ´ve had bad experiences with pre-activated win-installers, so I thought iÂ´d do it myself :)"
