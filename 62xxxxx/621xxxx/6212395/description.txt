Windows 7 With Integrated SP1 ISO â€“ Untouched Original â€“ With activator. All Versions


These are two original WINDOWS 7 MS untouched ISO images. One for all x64 OS versions and the other for all x86 OS versions. They can be used for all versions of Windows 7 just by adapting its configuration file. Instructions included on the Info.rtf file.

These are Windows 7 install versions integrating the Service Pack 1, not slipstreamed, to be used to install Windows 7 on new computers. They are incomparably better than slipstreamed options and have different installation behaviour, as described on the Info.rtf file with each ISO.

As always, language packs can be added to the same usual versions.
