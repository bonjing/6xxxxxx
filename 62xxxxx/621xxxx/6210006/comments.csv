,Commlink,2011-04-03T23:31Z,"For those that asked already, and other that may want to know...

BRRip = Blu-Ray was the source

Just like DVDRip = DVD was the source

The quality of what you download is not necessarily going to be DVD or Blu-Ray quality. Having a BRRip just means that the source was good.

That is a big part of making a good quality file, but it doesn't guarantee anything. A lot can happen during production of the rip and things like format and file sizes can affect the resulting quality.

The file size is 700MB, so you aren't going to be getting super high quality from this. The original source would have been reduced in quality quite a bit to get it down to that size. Around 700MB usually is an acceptable file size for a movie, where you aren't looking for anything extraordinary but still want decent picture and sound.

It should be more than watchable at that file size, and the comments on quality seem to have thought it was great quality for a 700MB rip.

If you are looking to burn it to disc and watch on a big screen plasma with lots of high end speakers, so you get a real high quality experience like you would from the actual DVD or Blu-Ray, you may want to go looking for something with a bigger file size."
