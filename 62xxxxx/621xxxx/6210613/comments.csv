,JayHorror,2011-03-03T11:55Z,Maaaan I have missed your uploads TY WTC.
,pooket,2011-03-21T04:01Z,"Hello WTC-SWE,
  Thanks for all the great stuff you have uploaded!  I've been slowly enjoying it for the past 2 years.
I was wondering if you could re-seed ""Ocean Colours""?  You originally uploaded it on May 16, 2010.  I've been trying to get it for weeks, but it ain't happenin'.  Thanks!"
[V],WTC-SWE,2011-03-23T15:32Z,"@ pooket 

A few hours after you posted your comment i started to reseed "" Ocean Colours "". According to my logs you should have the torrent by now.Enjoy and let me know if you need anything else to be reseeded."

You'd probably got corrupted files(or PC) and thoose ain't coming from me,that's for sure.Please make a force recheck and if you still have issues, just download the pieces(parts) you need.
There're no rar's or anything crap on all my uploads.It never has and never will.Good luck with your issue.

Regards
WTC-SWE"
[V],WTC-SWE,2011-09-01T04:05Z,"SPECIAL NOTE :
-----------------------------
All my torrents are seeded 24/7  except 31 that are stucked at 99% or so.I would really appreciate if you guys could seed and help me retrieve thoose back.

Basically we're talking about 50-100 MB for all of them(except 5).Mostly subtitles, image files missing or small parts of the avi file itself.

5 of thoose are at rate 0% - 60% (The Evolve series). The scratch from the trackers aren't always accurate,so don't pay to much attention on it.If you see a torrent flagged as Zero ""0"" seeders it doesn't automatically mean that that's the case.Just click on the magnet link and ckeck it out.The reason for this issue(s) with the ""download part"", occurred when my account was deleted accidentally  way back.

All new torrents though are working as usual(Download This Torrent Option).

Thank you for taking time reading the above and if you can help ,then feel free to contribue.Thoose torrents can be of joy for many years to come for all others.

Kindly regards
WTC-SWE"
[S],WTCSWE,2011-09-06T08:19Z,"If you guys have any of thoose torrents bellow stored somewhere on your drive(s),please help me retrieve them.
Some of them are 3-4 years old and it would be nice to keep them all alive for future use(ers).

Thanks guys!
