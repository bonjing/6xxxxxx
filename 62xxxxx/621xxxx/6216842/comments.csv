Good game and torrent."

,mwalsher,2011-12-26T03:33Z,"By ânew installerâ do you mean a custom, user-made one?"
,gtxSeries,2012-02-03T16:08Z,"@ leecox1000:
You should do that either in the options, or hit Alt+Enter.

@ mwalsher:
Yes, I wrote it personally using Inno Setup. This is a simplified type of installer that avoids microsoft's complicated and slow ""Windows Installer"" and doesn not check windows version or anyting. All it does is copy the files to the designated install location and add the essential registry entries to enable the game to run. To confirm this, all you have to do is open the source code of the installer itself (included in the torrent), so you can see for yourself that this is not bogus stuff and only does what I told you."
,crimsoncore,2012-03-19T21:14Z,hey dude... seed... anyway.. the top torrent doesnt work? seems like windows 7 users have a major problem... can you just upload the crack? it'll take forever again to download T_T
,crimsoncore,2012-03-22T01:38Z,"just got mine solve.. i dont know if this help but i have legit copy of windows 7 64bit, and i updated it.. 500MB+
