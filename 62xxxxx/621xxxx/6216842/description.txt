Fahrenheit with a new installer - installing the game on Vista/7 should no longer be an issue. This installer already contains the 1.1 update and is pre-cracked, so you just need to install the game and play.

Installation:
 -Mount the ISO image to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD and pop-in the disc
 -In the launcher, select Install / Installieren (the launcher likes to start 
 in german)
 -Install the game like you would with any program
 -Start the game with the shortcut on your desktop/start menu (unless you didn't
 install shortcuts)
 -Have fun!

Just like with my Resident Evil collection, I included the source of the installer, so that everyone can check it out.

Enjoy and please seed!


Note: I have a dual monitor setup and when I started the game under Win7 x64, the screen was completely blank. This was easily solved by temporarily disabling the second monitor by pressing WinKey + P
