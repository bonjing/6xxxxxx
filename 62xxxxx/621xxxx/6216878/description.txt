IMAGiNE NOTES:
Well here we go with our version .....and yes theres like 99 already out, but we thought we'd do one and one with different audio. Video was pretty nice like most R5's but colours looked a touch off and also lacked some life..... so done our normal stuff of crop, (borders only) resize, sharpness, brightness, contrast, white balance and rgb eq. The audio is off our TS release and all we done was add the russian audio to the end to make it complete and then resynced it and muxed it together with our video. Enjoy folks
