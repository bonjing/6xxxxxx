Negramaro is an Italian rock band. Their name comes from Negroamaro, a wine (and a red grape variety) from Puglia, a region in the South of Italy. Their initial success was with the song "Come sempre", from the album "Negramaro" recorded in 2003. It was chosen by RAI (the Italian national television) as the soundtrack for its 50th anniversary advertisement. They debuted in Sanremo's Festival in the young artists section with the hit "Mentre tutto scorre". This song was subsequently chosen as the title track for the movie "La febbre" by Alessandro D'Alatri featuring Fabio Volo.
