My 1st up in a while for music, anyway, as always, 500x500 album art, 100% complete and proper ID3's.

Their very 1st album released under the name Rainbow Butt Monkeys
1. Letters From Chutney

5 Studio Albums
1. Tip*
2. Greyest Of Blue Skies
3. Finger Eleven
4. Them Vs. You Vs. Me
5. Life Turns Electric

One Compilation Album (A Best Buy Exclusive)
Us Vs. Then Vs. Now

And two soundtrack appearences

2. The Punisher OST

*Note: This also contains the Canadian only track "Consolation Day" which is the original version of "Awake & Dreaming" its a little bit longer, and has a few differences in nuances, most will not notice.

Enjoy, HMD3
