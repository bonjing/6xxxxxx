Now please start seeding it. I've been stuck at 96.3% for the past couple of days. I'll continue to upload for as long as I can. Thanks."

,bigboimikey,2011-03-14T18:33Z,"Dude, you, the uploader of this torrent, need to seed the shit out of it. I'm looking at the peer list, and most people, me included are stuck at 97.1%. We can't seed it if we cant even download all of it. I've been running this torrent for almost a week now, its starting to get ridiculous."
,bigboimikey,2011-03-16T06:53Z,"Thanks for the torrent. I know it may have seemed like I was whining, but after you finally seeded it today a lot of us were able to finish downloading it today. I'll continue to seed till a 1:1 ratio. Thanks again."
