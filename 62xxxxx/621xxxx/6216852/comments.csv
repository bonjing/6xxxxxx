,ccglindsey,2011-04-29T02:07Z,"thanks for the Up, but I have one question:

I installed it after Norton ( of Course blocked it), 

I blocked the .exe in Norton,

and the app opens, but

It DOES NOT request any registration number.

on the About Screen it says it is Offline and no activation Number, but the only other option is to DEACTIVATE it, (but not to register it.)

I am in the middle of a project.

Does the requirment for the Activation change after a re-boot?


Or do i just let it be?"
