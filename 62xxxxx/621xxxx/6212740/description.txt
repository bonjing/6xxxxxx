We are pleased to announce the release of VortexBox 1.8.In the last release we added DVD movie ripping now we made it better. VortexBox now identifies the DVD and names it accordingly. VortexBox can also create an mp4 mirror of your DVD with a Windows Media Center xml file. This works great for viewing movies in Windows Media Center. You can now select the length the DVD tracks you want ripped. This is great for TV show DVDs where you want to rip all the tracks greater then a certain length.
We have also added the latest version of SqueezeBox Server (7.5.3) and a bunch of other fixes and upgrades. Thanks again to the VortexBox community for all their help testing the new version of VortexBox.
