,graybone,2011-09-27T19:47Z,"HÃ¥ller pÃ¥ att bli galen.. Jag har laddat ner 2 olika torrents till detta spel, och bÃ¥da har en fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att crasha vid vissa tillfÃ¤llen, mitt i en bana speciellt. NÃ¥gon som kan vara snÃ¤ll och sÃ¤ga till om denna version ocksÃ¥ gÃ¶r det och isf om nÃ¥gon vet en torrent dÃ¤r spelet faktiskt funkar? Eller om det Ã¤r nÃ¥got fuckat med min dator kanske, jag vet faktiskt inte:s Spelet stÃ¤ngs ner och det kommer upp en ruta dÃ¤r det stÃ¥r ""NFSC.exe har stÃ¶tt pÃ¥ ett problem och mÃ¥ste avslutas."", och man kan bara trycka pÃ¥ en knapp som Ã¤r ""close"".. Ã„r alltid lite sur sÃ¥ jag trycker direkt pÃ¥ ""close"" utan att lÃ¤sa allt.. Jag har windows xp sp3 btw.

Finns det nÃ¥gon sjÃ¤l som vet nÃ¥got sÃ¥, SnÃ¤lla svara!!!!!!!!"

,Varrkarus,2011-12-04T02:34Z,"Crack causes the game to crash after Wolf (One of the first 3 bosses). Tried many times and still crashes, so it's definitely not an issue on my side."
,Varrkarus,2011-12-24T03:35Z,>>Crack causes the game to crash after Wolf (One of the first 3 bosses)
,Varrkarus,2011-12-24T03:36Z,Found a fix. Run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 3) and it will no longer crash after Wolf.
,risto-10,2012-01-05T19:30Z,i cant launch the game. When i launch the game my screeen goes black for a sec and then comes a message what says nfsc.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close and then i can send report. any advice?
