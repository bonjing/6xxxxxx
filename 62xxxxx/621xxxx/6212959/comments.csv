,MattB543,2011-03-03T03:11Z,"the problem was with another torrent i tried, so i deleted it and i'm trying this one because apparently this one doesn't have that problem, but seriously, we need seeders"
,Lorden--,2011-03-03T09:12Z,"Works great for me, full grafic setting (except shadows) and 30 fps. I'll keep seeding this."
,MattB543,2011-03-04T03:24Z,"how did you get it to work? mine shows up and then dissapears on the dock, but i have the three things that should be in the launcher section"
,Lorden--,2011-03-05T10:12Z,"sometimes it takes some time to open...
i suggest that you delete the following folders:
""Users/username/Library/Preferences/League of Legends Preferences/""
""LolClient""
restart you computer afterwards and try to start the game. Wait a little bit, it sometimes takes a time to start the launcher (on my mac i once had to wait about 20 sec).
if it still doesn't work, delete the two folders again and reinstall the game.
i hope it works then, because i don't know what else you could do except follow the guides posted in http://eu.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=132051&page=21.
There it also says that it can take even about 10 min to start the launcher..."
,Lorden--,2011-03-07T10:52Z,"You can also try to quit following prozesses:
cmvs* (all that start with this, i'm not sure if they belong to lol, but they open when i start lol)
League of Legends/or all that have related names)
wineserver
@ khendrix, wich prozesses do actually belong to league of legends?"
,MattB543,2011-03-07T23:47Z,where is the lolclient to delete? i cant find it in preferences...
,Temping,2011-03-08T21:24Z,"The instructions for the US is ever so slightly incorrect. In system.cfg, the instructions say to change the last line to US. It actually should be NA."
,MattB543,2011-03-08T23:34Z,"alright, i'll try it"
,MattB543,2011-03-09T01:49Z,"The thing is, it wont patch so i shouldn't even worry about changing the code yet... it just disappears after a second"
,iTrippin,2011-03-11T06:10Z,"It works, what Lordon said fixes the opening problem"
,Lorden--,2011-03-16T22:07Z,"@MattB543 and all others that could not find ""LolClient""
it should be ""Users/username/Library/Preferences/LolClient/"""
