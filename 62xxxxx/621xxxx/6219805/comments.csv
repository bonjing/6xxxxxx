[V],loverulz,2011-03-05T02:38Z,"Britney Spears got her fans amped up for her forthcoming album, Femme Fatale, when she released its second single, ""Till the World Ends,""

"" 'Till the World Ends' is fun! It's fun. I like it. It's good energy,"" she said of the track, which was produced by Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Billboard. ""I'm a vibe person, and I think I love good-mood songs, and if it puts me in a good mood, it clicks for me."""
