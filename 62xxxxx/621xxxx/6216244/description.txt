Mordrin McDonald 21st-Century Wizard - S01 & 02 - Audio Comedy - BBC R4  
10 x 15 Minute Episode - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo



Step into the magically mundane world that is the life of 21st-century wizard Mordrin McDonald - an isolated sorcerer with enough power to destroy a town in his small finger, yet not enough clout to get his bins emptied on time by the local council. Even for such a skilful sorcerer, modern life is rubbish. 

Listeners follow the life and times of 2,000-year-old Mordrin, who has been a practising wizard for many centuries. Despite wielding incredible mystical powers, Mordrin's humdrum existence, based in the small Scottish village of Blairochil, is a far cry from the mystical excitement portrayed by the likes of Merlin and Harry Potter.
