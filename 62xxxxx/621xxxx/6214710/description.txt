"There's a film that Jean-Pierre Jeunet will direct sometime in the next ten years, a cybernoir affair set in a ruined New Orleans after the levees have finally burst once and for all, and the city has been permanently inundated by an ultratoxic Mississippi. It will be something about black-market biotech, or mistaken identity, or both. Somehow the year will be both 1929 and 2093. And throughout the film will run a soundtrack as dark and quirky, as trippy and eclectic, as the movie itself. The familiar strains of traditional Appalachian ballads, blues standards, dust bowl folk; the harmonicas traded for electronica, but still a banjo and dobro here and there, and over it all, sultrysharp vocals as rich and disarming as the greenblack waters of the drowned French Quarter . . . Now, if you can imagine that, you have a pretty good idea what to expect from Snakefarm's Songs From My Funeral". (amazon.com review)
