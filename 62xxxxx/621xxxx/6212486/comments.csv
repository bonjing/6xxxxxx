,maciel666,2011-04-21T13:06Z,That crap fuck my Media Player! 
,badboy2k7,2011-04-29T23:54Z,works great for me only thing is i dont know what to do with the RUS files that are in there?  It would be nice if there were some english instructions...
,maneff,2011-06-28T09:30Z,"Great software! I love it, the srs HD lab really sounds close to the limits (unlike the srs audio sandbox 1.10) :} Love it !   
pp. Also the .reg key is correct! (10x)"
,BludRayne,2011-08-07T21:42Z,"First...it doesn't ""F"" with your specific media player or snail your system. I suggest you had performance issues to begin with.

For those who have issues with the Russian aspect of this. Download the trial from http://www.srslabs.com/ and then apply the reg from this download. Works perfectly.

Cheers"
,cantech,2011-08-28T14:41Z,"Okey Dokey,
 First off the link to D/L the official version is here
https://www.srslabs.com/store/store/download_hal.asp?
2nd Yes it can screw up your sound at least with windows 7 64 bit so I reccomend you use system restore right before installing make a restore point and you can always go back to it if it screws with your system.
3rd you can download the official version as of aug 8 2011 and just extract and right click and merge the SRS-HDAL.activLic.reg to make the app fully functional
before anyone pipes in. I am a computer tech with 20 yrs under my belt in almost all aspects of programming and hardware and this was my own personal experience. so :-P"
,Jamaloy,2011-09-07T20:06Z,Scanned cleaned and installed with a bit of trial and error. Seems to work perfectly and hasn't screwed anything up. Running windows 7 64-bit and generally prefer the KM Player as my media player of choice and it's all good so thank you very much! My only question is why would you use this over the old audio sandbox which is an amazing piece of software. I can't see any benefits of upgrading especially as I used to use the audio sandbox as a graphic equalizer as well which this new one hasn't incorporated. Any help anybody?
,maneff,2011-09-13T10:54Z,"GREAT! Thanks (again for caring) :>
To people with problems:
# If you have issues with sound, close all programs that actually use SOUND before Installing! (including, firefox, winamp, and especially SKYPE !)
# Note that after install you will need to choose your output AUDIO DEVICE (from the ""options"" panel in the SRS program). Select the first and then try to listen to some music or sound. If nothing sounds choose the second, third and so... till you hear sound.
# After doing everything correctly you WILL have issues with crappy software (like SKYPE) so configure them properly without the access of autoconfiguring the audio device ... OR ELSE ....

## IF THIS SOUNDS ""BAD"" OR WORSE THAN YOUR STOCK DRIVERS just Uninstall it and try to get the latest drivers for your audio card (don't trust windows's built-in driver and the windows update drivers, they are NOT yours and the most of them won't sound OK and won't play 5.1 4.1 7.1 etc)

### If you have a really LOW-END / cheap sound system, just install the previuos version -> SRS AUDIO SANDBOX 1.10 and that would be a better choice for you ####
Thanks again, Volume up and so.."
