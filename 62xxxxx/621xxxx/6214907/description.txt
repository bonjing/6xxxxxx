Finally, a MASH release without canned laughter. Ripped by me personally in high quality h.264, these episodes come straight from the UK DVD box set.


Watch using VLC, or any other media player that supports MKV/h.264 (all the decent codec packs support it).


So far the first 9 seasons are up, 9 is still ripping. I'm watching the episodes before I upload them to check for quality, so I can guarantee that everything I upload is glitch free.

***PLEASE***

Seed for as long as you can, and always make sure you seed AT LEAST what you leech. I can't seed forever if you want new releases!
