,mugginsville2000,2011-03-05T23:44Z,so im a total newb and was wondering how i seed after a download is done.  if i delete the torrent from my library but i keep the files in the directory they download to will it still seed the file?  any help would be much appreciated

For seeding...after the download completion don't remove the torrent and downloaded files too...Only the torrent loaded in application will be seeded...Then seed that's solely your choice but don't remove the torrent and files too"
