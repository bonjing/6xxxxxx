An outstanding mini-series by Ridley Scott based on the novel by Ken Follett.
While I have little interest in medieval times, I found the story riveting. The acting was sound, and while the violence was graphic, it was not gratuitous. 


This torrent contains a rip of all four discs and scans of box and disks covers. This is the Scandinavian release so subtitles are in Danish, Swedish, Finish and Norse. but the spoken language is the original English.

I've had problems in the past uploading torrents of DVDs so to avoid problems I've rared each disk (apologies to folks who don't like rar/zip files), but you can download and watch the first disk while you're downloading the rest.

Please seed when you can as I do not have a 24 hour connection. seeding will NOT be available from me between the hours of 23:00h GMT and 09:00GMT.

Constructive comments are welcome.
