But how it came to have “*” in the folder’s name like “1Intro *” or “Chp 1. Interface *”, etc …; because I have invalid filename in extracting this archive.
At the end I was able to extract it without folders."
[V],polisdavid,2011-03-30T10:46Z,"Tobro,  I put the * on the folder names to tell me I was done extracting them, I did it all with screen captures.

Sorry if that caused you problems...."
