,zayson,2011-03-02T04:26Z,"Carbon69,  LOL?

150 milliseconds.........=6 months (probably) team work to develop 2011. Now look., you can milk the cow but if you don't feed it- it will die. I suggest you to make funny agreement ""with your moral"" and every 10-th ""easy bucks download"" you really buy one (any) software.. Those people have families too., like we do. Thank you!"

Then you'll simply learn lesson- uninstall/install and put the ""must have"" firewall. Download fresh software every 4 months and you're OK. "

,TheAslan,2011-04-22T17:38Z,"What did you mean about this:
""Download fresh software every 4 months and you're OK.""

If i understood correctly you're saying that i can't update TU but i can download and install fresh software...if i already have TU installed and running  i have to still install it...right?"
,zayson,2011-04-23T18:08Z,"TheAslan,

Well- yes..

If you prevent software from updating (you should do it always) maybe you'd like to update it manually at some point.. I wrote four months because that would be logical time for TuneUp to integrate few fixes.. Most of the crucial updates of the legal software reinstall the application anyway."
