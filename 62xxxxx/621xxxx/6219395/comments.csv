[T],metalcore.,2011-03-04T23:57Z,"fair write up, but these people (ie right to life people) are ignorant morons who havent the slightest idea what they are talking about and consistently spread unfounded bullshit all over the world, most being christian fundamentalists that are, in fact, entirely driven by religious indoctrination and complete and utter mindlessness. Not only is abortion natural, but necessary- especially in America, the world does not need more born bred and indoctrinated greed driven consumers.

the sweet irony comes from the observation that the very people arguing against women's right to have an abortion are the best cases for the existence of abortion- if you could have aborted a Hitler, right? (clear exaggeration before you get your panties all in a bunch)

in the southern US they are trying to pass a law in which the murder of an abortion doctor will be considered ""justified homocide"", and these people talk about right to life? fucking hypocrites. straight up."
[T],metalcore.,2011-03-05T00:03Z,"btw, it doesnt get attention because the issue has long been settled. Noone is forcing anyone to have an abortion, thus they have no argument. this is despite the fact that the fundies dress up like pimps and claim they are forcing underage whores to have abortions (laughs hysterically); seen that shit? its quite humourous- a sad and pathetic ploy by desperate people who cant wait for the apocalypse to come. 

the only people who think this is an issue are religious zealots who argue right to life but then arm themselves and shoot abortion doctors (see Army of God documentary, for instance). these people are retarded, mindless fools who should not be listened too because they are living in states of delusion."
,hrmitcrb,2011-03-05T01:11Z,"The pious and judgemental people who picket abortion centers need to get a life of their own. Those who oppose abortion would have women return to the days of back alleys and coat-hangers. It's discraceful that  women who have often endured agony beyond measure in reaching the decision to abort (for various reasons) are then subjected to ridicule from the self-righteous protestors. Incidentally, there are mere abortions per capita are in the bible belt. "

 I think you need to get an ""argument for dummies"" book. Why is it that pro-infanticide folks like you always present such idiotic statements? So what if women have been disenfranchised throughout the years, does that make it right to murder babies? Yes, it's sad what women endured, but how does murdering babies make up for the hardships endured in the past?

No one's forcing anyone to get an abortion. That's not the issue. The issue is that there should not be state-sponsored infanticide. Murder is always a crime, especially murdering someone just because it will cause you some inconvenience."

No need to back alleys, your side murders for money - pure and simple."

Killer are made not born. Secularism has murdered more humans in the past 100 years then ALL religious war combined by a factor of at leas 100. Secularism nearly nuked Japan out of existence if not for massive reinvestment by outside parities."

Your quote: ""Secularism has murdered more humans in the past 100 years then ALL religious war combined by a factor of at leas 100.""

Tell that to the millions of right-wing GOP followers (including the so-called 'values-voters' while opposing abortion) who supported George Bush's war for oil in Iraq which has killed millions."
,Balthazar7,2011-03-07T02:41Z,"left-wing then senator now secretary of state Hillary Clinton voted for war and continues to affirm that vote.

left-wing then senator now American Prez. Barack Hussein Obama voted for war and  affirms that votes that vote everyday ... all the while preparing for a 3rd. war with Iran.

Bush - Obama are nothing more than errand boys for the plutocrats and oligarchies running the Western world.

Senator Obama voted NO to the Iraq War."
,Balthazar7,2011-03-08T01:23Z,"Technicality nothing more. Senator Obama voted in favor of every single budget funding the war. As Prez., Obama has increased war funding and increased the overall national budget for all military expenditures. As a percentage of GDP under Obama, war funding is fast approaching WWII levels. With no exit strategy in place ... this may bankrupt the USA.

Don't know how old you are but do you know the the Vietnam war ended? Both Dem and Reb refused to continue funding the war so troops were forced to come back home. ""declare victory and run"" was the mantra.

Today's American politicos are almost all blood thirsty killers of innocence overseas or in their mother's womb as long as the money keeps flowing.

America has lost its soul."
,hrmitcrb,2011-03-08T11:34Z,I'm old enough to have protested against the Vietnam War and every war since.  I have also visited the Vietnam War Memorial (The Wall) on several occasions to pay respects to friends that I lost in that foolish endeavor.  It was pressure from conservative 'hawks' which got the U.S. into Vietnam and pressure from liberals which got us out.  Conservatives traditionally support violence over peace and oppose abortion.  But in checking the numbers on abortion rates you'll find there are more abortions per capita in 'red' states than 'blue' states.  And your 'facts' about war funding dollars being comparable to World War II are grossly inaccurate in that they are not adjusted for inflation.  Obama did increase funding to get the U.S. out of Iraq and also to get the U.S. out of Afghanistan.
[T],dramacore,2012-02-12T20:47Z,"religion, the business of mind control and money.

no gods, no masters.

so if someone with aids rapes a teenage girl,
she should have that baby?  there's so many
flaws to pro life.  and as others have mentioned
people will go about abortion their own way.

we should be a society that supports choice."
