Review:

From Grove Press Guide to Blues on CD
Slim amuses himself rolling the organ keys in four of ten songs on yet another Prestige/Bluesville album recorded in 1961. Stick to his lusty voice-and-piano escapades, because when he pulls out the stops waves of funereal or giddy schmaltz spew forth. -- Â© Frank John Hadley 1993

Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide
Like Slim's other Bluesville work, this is a characteristic and very consistent effort, though not what you would single out as the cream of his recorded work. He varies the program between originals and covers of standards like "Mean Mistreatin' Mama," "Rock Me Baby," and "Goin' Down Slow," providing a touch of unpredictability by switching from the piano to the organ on a few tracks.
