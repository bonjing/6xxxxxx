,SCBacon,2011-03-04T23:48Z,"@Titanosaurus 
Yes it is, check here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Archer_episodes

The 2009 is helpful as it shows when the show began, if there are two show with the same name this can be useful. (This is also useful with Doctor Whoo 2005 etc).

Just look at the season and episode number.

S02E06 :)"

,nbrazil,2011-03-05T08:14Z,"A quick IMDB search produces two previous series entitled Archer.

1975: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072468/

1985: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088735/

Both completely unrelated to each other and the current series. Downloading one of them by mistake would be annoying, although possibly a pleasant surprise."
