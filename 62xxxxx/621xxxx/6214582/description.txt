I could only find the illustrated version in the bookstore so I decided to get it.
The illustrated version is concise and funny. I actually found the illustrations to be more effective than the written version (which I read 3 years ago).[cut]
After finishing the book I decided to quit. I've been smoke-free for three weeks! I'm also proud to say that I can go to parties, drink, and have no urge whatsoever to smoke. The book has a great way of showing the reader a different perspective of smoking in general.............
