From Wiki:


Manfred Mann were a British beat, rhythm and blues, pop, and cover band of the 1960s, named after their South African keyboardist Manfred Mann, who later led the successful 1970s group Manfred Mann's Earth Band.[1] Manfred Mann were chart regulars in the 1960s, and the first south-of-England-based group to top the US Billboard Hot 100 during the so-called British invasion.
