I started downloading torrents of yours even if I don't know what they are just because I know if you like them I probably will too. I wanted to ask if you have the complete V series in HD. I saw you have ep 1-3 up but the torrent is dead. I'm having a really hard time finding it so if you have it would you please upload it? Thanks in advance and thanks again for all the great torrents you've already uploaded."

Great upload, good quality, thank you for sharing.
Too bad we were left with a cliffhanger on this one."
