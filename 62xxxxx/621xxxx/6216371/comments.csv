,lance_kidd,2012-01-16T10:18Z,"This is a wasted download.  You can't even hear a WORD of the movie because the commentary is recorded over the top of it.  It's worth nothing...Unless of course, you actually want to hear Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy talk about a bunch of crap for an hour and a half while the movie silently plays in the background.  Why would they even do that?  "
,Saki33,2012-02-13T15:31Z,"I'm not going to play it, but the commentary is a bonus feature. Disregard the negative comments. These people don't know what dual audio means.  No one told you? It's in the TITLE! Play it with VLC player and select the track one audio only and you won't hear the commentary. If burning it or playing from a portable hard drive through your TV's USB port, first load it in mkvmerge, deselect track 2, and mux. "
