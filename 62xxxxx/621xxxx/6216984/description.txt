"Murphy finds that most workplaces are brimming with untapped talent. Only it's suppressed by goal-setting that discourages big ideas and leaders who focus on happiness rather than greatness."
Training Magazine

Weâ€™ve all heard the saying that a happy employee is a motivated employee. But what if thatâ€™s not true?

Leadership IQ CEO Mark Murphy says the â€œhappy employeeâ€ philosophy doesnâ€™t work. A study of more than 500,000 leaders and employees shows that despite the billions of dollars organizations spend to satisfy and engage workers, 72% of employees admit theyâ€™re still not giving their best effort at work. Rather, itâ€™s leaders who focus on making their people greatâ€”not happyâ€”who inspire Hundred Percenter performance.

If you talk to the employees behind todayâ€™s great innovations, youâ€™re unlikely to hear, â€œI was inspired by a boss who coddles me.â€ Instead youâ€™d probably hear, â€œMy boss challenges me and pushes me past my limits.â€ Most workplaces are brimming with untapped talentâ€” only itâ€™s suppressed by leaders who fail to connect with and challenge employees to unleash their true potential.

Here are just a few of the big ideas in Hundred Percenters:

The harder the goals you set, the better your employees will perform
You should never use a Compliment Sandwich to deliver feedback
Talented Terrorsâ€”people with great skills and a bad attitudeâ€”can destroy your company culture
Before you can start motivating Hundred Percenters, you have to stop demotivating them
You should never ask your employees if theyâ€™re â€œsatisfiedâ€
This groundbreaking book debunks management fads that donâ€™t apply to todayâ€™s workplace and provides the facts, theories, and direction you need to become a 100% Leader. Apply Murphyâ€™s leadership lessons and youâ€™ll see innovation, productivity, and profits soar, while employee turnover rates plummet. Hundred Percenters will bring out the best in your workforce...............................
