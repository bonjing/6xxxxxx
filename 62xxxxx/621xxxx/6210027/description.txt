"The Illusionist" represents the magically melancholy final act of Jacques Tatiâ€™s career.
 Tati, of course, was the tall Frenchman, bowing from the waist, pipe in mouth, 
often wearing a trench coat, pants too short, always the center of befuddlements. 
If youâ€™ve seen "Mr. Hulotâ€™s Holiday" you know who he was, and if you havenâ€™t, 
it belongs on your must-see list.
