Fear Of A Black Planet 1990


Fear of a Black Planet is the third studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy, released April 10, 1990 on Def Jam Recordings in the United States. Production for the album was handled entirely by production team The Bomb Squad, which expanded on the dense, sample-layered sound of the group's previous album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988). Fear of a Black Planet contains lyrical themes concerning organization and empowerment within the African-American community, while presenting criticism of social issues affecting African Americans at the time of the album's conception.

The album debuted at number 40 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling one million copies in its first week. It ultimately peaked at number 10 on the chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Upon its release, Fear of a Black Planet received general praise from music critics and has since been recognized as one of hip hop's greatest and most important albums. In 2003, the album was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2005, it was chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.
