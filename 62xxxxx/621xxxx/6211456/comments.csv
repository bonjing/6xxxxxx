,dapinder,2011-03-02T02:57Z,"Thanx xRG. Your effort is highly appreciable. The video clarity of your rips is excellent. I have just one request:
Can you please increase the resolution of your future releases to 720*304 (i suppose that is maximum to be supported by a DVD player), as with this much clarity, the increased resolution will act like cherry on cake. Thanx"
