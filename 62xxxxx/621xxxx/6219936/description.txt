Plot:
Seven ex-soldiers are hired to rob a group of American GIs\' trucks, under the misguided notion that these trucks contain a wealth of treasures. They successfully seize the trucks, only to find that there\'s nothing precious within. A troop of fully-armed, brutal, not to mention racist GIs, led by Peter, is now after them. At the same time, their former superior (in charge of seven) is tracking down a cargo of dangerous chemicals and he asks for their help. They reluctantly agree, and their personal conflict is turned into an action-packed confrontation fought and waged for the sake of one thing only: their country.
