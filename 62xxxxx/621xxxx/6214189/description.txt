SUMMARY:
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe was a revered football superstar back in his day, 
but that time has since faded. But when a messy drunk driving incident 
lands him in jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden 
Hazen (James Cromwell), a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's 
athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team 
of convicts, to square off in a big football game against the sadistic 
guards. With the help of fellow convict Caretaker, and an old legend 
named Nate Scarborough to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to 
be a very interesting game. It's only the warden and the guards who 
have no idea who or what they're up against, with Paul the driving 
force behind the new team.
