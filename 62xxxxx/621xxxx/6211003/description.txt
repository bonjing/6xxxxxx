 Born in a prominent Bengali family, Subhas had   
 dedicated much of his younger years by being     
 actively involved in ridding the British from    
 India.For this purpose he joined hands with
stalwarts such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas 
Gandhi, but expressed his frustration,especially
with Gandhi's slow and painstaking way of trying
to win over the enemy with love.
