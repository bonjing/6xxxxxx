With Microbiology Demystified, you master the subject one step at a time -- at your own speed. Unlike most books on microbiology, general concepts are presented first -- and the details follow. This unique self-teaching guide gives you a quiz at the end of each chapter to reinforce learning and pinpoint weaknesses -- and a 100-question "final exam" to review the entire book.
This heavily illustrated and entertaining self-teaching tool gives you everything you need to: Painlessly master all major microbiology concepts, in the order they are taught by standard texts. Decipher complex terms and ideas, with a fun, easy-to-read format. Learn microbiology from an expert teacher partnered with a writer who takes the student's point of view.
