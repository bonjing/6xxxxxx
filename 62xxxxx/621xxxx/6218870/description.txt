THE DEL VIKINGS THE BEST OF: THE MILLENNIUM COLLECTION
Label Hip-O 
Original Year 2004
Format:Mp3@320


The Del Vikings have a confusing history, but there are a couple of undisputed facts. Their signature tune and biggest hit, "Come Go With Me," was written by bass vocalist Clarence Quick and features a fine lead vocal by Norman Wright, as well as a distinctive sax line by Gene Upshaw. Past that, confusion reigns. "Come Go With Me" was a hit in 1956 on Dot Records, and while it was still on the charts, the group split into two different outfits, both using the Del Vikings name, or some variation of it, with part of the group remaining at Dot while Quick and Wright moved on to sign with Mercury Records. So while Quick wrote the other big tune that was a hit for the Del Vikings, "Whispering Bells," it wasn't his version of the group that had the hit. This brief collection sidesteps all of that and presents the top dozen sides released under the Del Vikings name, including the two biggest hits. In truth, this is probably sufficient for most listeners. A pleasant enough doo wop group, the Del Vikings came late to the dance, and thanks to the confusion of their contractual situation, were never really given the opportunity to develop their sound further. ~ Steve Leggett
