Notes:

 - This movie is already torrented here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5568038/The_Lavender_Hill_Mob and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4023371/The_Lavender_Hill_Mob ) but they are 3.58 and 4.36 GiB in size respectively. Black and white movies lose very little quality on compression so I present this one as a smaller yet still high-quality alternative

 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
