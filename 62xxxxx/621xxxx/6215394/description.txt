The beginning of the decade was marked by the New Romantic movement and later by
fashion inspired by heavy metal bands, including teased hair, ripped jeans and neon clothing.
Some clothing and mens hairstyles had influences from the 1950s, especially in the first part
of the decade.

Significant fashion trends of the 1980s include

During the early 1980s there was a resurgence of interest in the ladies' evening wear styles
of the early 1940s peplums, batwing sleeves and other design elements of the times were reinterpreted
for a new market. The shoulder pad helped define the silhouette and was
reintroduced in cut foam versions, especially in well-cut suits reminiscent of the WWII era.
Before too long, these masculinized shapes were adopted by women seeking success in the
corporate world and became an icon of women's attempts to smash the glass ceiling, a
mission that was added by their notable appearance in the TV series Dynasty.


As the decade wore on, shoulder pads became the defining fashion statement of the era,
known as power dressing and bestowing the perception of status and position onto those
who wore them. They became both larger and more ubiquitous~every garment from the
brassiere upwards would come with its own set of shoulder pads. To prevent excessive
shoulder padding, velcro was sewn onto the pads so that the wearer could choose how many
sets to wear. By the end of the era, some shoulder pads were the size of dinner plates. It was
inevitable that as the cycle of fashion turned

Leg warmers are coverings for the lower legs, similar to socks but thicker and generally
footless. Leg warmers were originally dancewear worn by ballet and other classic dancers.
Leg warmers are worn by dancers in keep warm the leg muscles and to prevent cramped and
injured muscles.
Construction

Traditionally knitted from pure wool, leg warmers are more typically made of cotton, synthetic
fibers, or both. Some are made of other materials, such as chenille. Other leg warmers are
made of wool, camel hair and Old English Sheep Dog hair.

Leg warmers can vary in length, though not in width, due to the material's stretchiness. They
are commonly worn to just below the knee, though many dancers prefer it to extend to cover
the lower parts of the thigh. Some leg warmers cover the entire foot; these warmers usually
have a pad that grips the floor so the dancer does not slip - however this has been known to
cause career-ending injury. Some leg warmers are particularly short and made of thinner
material; these are also known as 'ankle warmers'.

Ray-Ban is a high end manufacturer of sunglasses, founded in 1937 by Bausch & Lomb.
They were introduced for the United States Army Air Corps. In 1999, Bausch & Lomb sold the
brand to the Italian Luxottica Group

Ray-Bans were created in 1937. Some years earlier, Lieutenant John MacCready returned
from a balloon flying adventure and complained that the sun had permanently damaged his
eyes. He contacted Bausch & Lomb asking them to create sunglasses that would provide
protection and also look elegant. On May 7, 1937, Bausch & Lomb took out the patent.The
prototype, known as Anti-Glare, had an extremely light frame weighing 150 grams. They were
made of gold-plated metal with green lenses made of mineral glass to filter out infrared and
ultraviolet rays. Pilots in the United States Army Air Corps immediately adopted the
sunglasses.The Ray-Ban Aviator became a well-known style of sunglasses when General
Douglas MacArthur landed on the beach in the Philippines in World War II, and
photographers snapped several pictures of him wearing them.

Denim is a rugged cotton twill textile, in which the weft passes under two [twi- "double"] or
more warp threads. This produces the familiar diagonal ribbing identifiable on the reverse of
the fabric, which distinguishes denim from cotton duck. Denim has been in American usage
since the late 18th century.The word comes from the name of a sturdy fabric called serge,
originally made in NÃ®mes, France, by the AndrÃ© family. Originally called serge de NÃ®mes, the
name was soon shortened to denim.Denim was traditionally colored blue with indigo dye to
make blue "jeans", though "jean" then denoted a different, lighter cotton textile; the
contemporary use of jean comes from the French word for Genoa, Italy [Genes], where the
first denim trousers were made.
