Itâ€™s taken a year or so for Jenee Halsteadâ€™s debut album to make it from Cambridge, MA to Europe , but itâ€™s certainly been worth the wait as this pressing includes 5 bonus tracks from her â€˜Hollow Bonesâ€™ EP in addition to the 10 songs of â€˜The River Graceâ€™.

A modern American folk singer/songwriter in the truest sense of the genre, Jenee has much in common with Patty Griffin & Shawn Colvin in both writing style and delivery, what is more impressive is the fact that this is her first album and the quality of the writing is up there with the very best.  Sheâ€™s a keenly observant writer and has an eye for detail way beyond that of a young artist, and there are some lyrics here that really stand out, notably on â€˜Darkest Dayâ€™ where she paints a vivid picture of a stolen car and the story that unfolds.  

Musically, this is appears fairly traditional with acoustic guitar taking the lead, with a band of mandolin, bass, dobro and more, but thereâ€™s a definite contemporary feel in places that gives the album a unique atmosphere, and makes it stand out from the crowd â€“ itâ€™s delicate, but much more complex and constructed than it first appears.

Vocally she shares many attributes with Griffin, the range and phrasing certainly have distinct similarities, and this is no bad thing as it makes the whole collection immediately engaging and somewhat familiar; but from the first listen in its obvious Halstead is ploughing her own furrow with her mix of traditional and contemporary themes.  

The addition of the 5 â€˜Hollow Bonesâ€™ tracks are a definite bonus, these tracks were written and recorded after the original release of â€˜The River Graceâ€™, but they follow on seamlessly and show the natural development of an artist.

All 15 tracks here show mark the arrival of a talented and impressive artist â€“ this is a beautifully understated record, but everything is perfectly balanced resulting in one of the most memorable albums in recent memory.
