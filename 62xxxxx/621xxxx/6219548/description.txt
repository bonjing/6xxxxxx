                The Jingle.
                A new six-part comedy sitcom written and produced by
                Robert Popper, starring Tamsin Greig, Paul Ritter,
                Simon Bird and comedy newcomer Tom Rosenthal, plus
                special guest star Mark Heap. Friday Night Dinner is
                a truly original series about the Goodmans, a family
                who have made an art form of their eccentricities. In
                the second episode, when Adam and Jonny come home to
                find Dad secretly peering into his underpants with a
                magnifying glass, they're desperate to find out what
                he's looking at. Meanwhile, Mum is just trying to
                have a nice Friday night, but Jim - the neighbour
                who's terrified of his own dog - keeps interrupting
                the meal. Dad takes Adam - who's single - into the
                toilet to have a private chat about 'females'. Soon
                the whole family are in the loo quizzing poor Adam.
                Jonny is loving it. And finally, the secret behind
                Dad's pants-peering is revealed.
