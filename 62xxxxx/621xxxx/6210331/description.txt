These are songs written or cowritten by Lady Gaga that were released by others; this is as opposed to covers of songs initially released by her. (I have _those_ at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6176715 and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6185844 )

"Make Her Say" is actually a Kid Cudi song that samples Gaga, but this seemed like a decent place to put it.

"Fever" and "Fashion" also exist in versions by Gaga herself - see http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5949534. Fever was occasionally performed by Gaga years before it appeared on Adam Lambert's For Your Entertainment. Fashion as sung by Gaga was released for the Confessions Of A Shopaholic soundtrack. (Some other songs from this collection may exist as unleaked demos.)
