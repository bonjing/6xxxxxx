,metalvegetax,2011-03-06T03:12Z,come on guys keep seeding and let me know how i did
,quietas,2011-03-10T03:37Z,"Unfortunately you uploaded the Memnoch the Devil (5) as an abridged version.

Here's the unabridged version: http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/4736471/Anne_Rice_-_Memnoch_the_Devil.rar.4736471.TPB.torrent"
,quietas,2011-03-10T03:38Z,"Opps, here is the link to the page rather than the torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4736471/Anne_Rice_-_Memnoch_the_Devil.rar"
,Rugburn54,2011-03-11T18:47Z,"O.K., here's how you did. The attempted up is great. The follow through for a self sustaining seeded project is a total failure.  Right now fifty-nine people are trying to download a torrent you are refusing to seed.  No orgasm on this end. You are on my ""No-Fly"" list."
,AnastasiaMore,2011-03-23T19:07Z,PLEASE SEED!!!! I can never read through any of her books without becoming narcoleptic from her detail OD-ing. PLEASE PLEASE SEED!
,metalvegetax,2011-03-28T01:31Z,rugburn54 you are a homo at least I am trying to hook others up with something i made i cant seed 24/7 you a55hole
,hhaddow,2011-04-03T11:56Z,what are your seeding hours as you cant seed 24/7 (use gmt/utc or state the time code pleese)
,FeistyFe89,2011-04-06T00:09Z,"Thanks for the Audio books.. 
1 ?, R U a boy or a girl..? "
,Harleyx,2011-04-13T00:49Z,"metalvegetax, there is no need to call people ""homo"", or any other name. If you are doing the up, and the seed, take the 'water off a ducks back' approach if they are wrong, and correct if they are right. As an uploader, it looks bad when you make posts like that. Not sayin, just sayin"
,sarnjo,2011-04-14T20:26Z,PLEASE SEED!!!! 
,metalvegetax,2011-04-20T12:36Z,I tryed to do you all a favor and all i get is bullshit from you people out of ten comments some my own only one thank you if i could pull the torrent and kill it for ever i would but i'm shure somebody  would just re up load my hard work you people are getting stuff for free it makes me sick that you bitch and complain
,peterjeanme,2011-05-02T21:51Z,"Is anyone else having audio problems with any of these books, the recording seems to keep skipping, using different players.  I'v hashed checked the files and it says its good."
,peterjeanme,2011-05-03T02:29Z,"Failed Torrent- I downloaded again using another torrent client and i'm still getting skips, the first one on the first file right at 2min in."
,andrewtora,2011-05-18T11:47Z,"Thanx girls!!!
Goodbye and good for me!!!"
,rythmos12,2011-06-20T00:59Z,"These books keep skipping forward.  It gets you in suspense, then skips right ahead.  Very frustrating.  I was pretty stoked to get these though. It kind of is a disappointment.  Nice effort though."
,krad21,2011-06-27T09:22Z,"Thnx for the Up effort, but book 2 skips plenty about 3 or 4 times during the first 8mins. I think maybe you have some files in different order when you combined them all into 1 file. Although its great for space it actually sucks....bigtime. Its not like i'm going to hear the whole audio in one go. 

When I put it into my mp3 player it takes wayyyyy to long to fast forward to the part that I last stayed. A suggestion...maybe combine the files into 10min files or so.

Are all the books skippy like this? can anyone confirm?"
,metalvegetax,2011-08-16T21:08Z,no just the one book skips a few times when i joined all the tracks I messed up the order of 3 2-3min tracks otherwise all other books work just fine sorry my second upload  aint perfect but your all welcome
,Monk1969,2011-10-12T18:36Z,"3 2-3 min tracks?? It skips regularly the first 50 minutes of the first book, I'd say it skips a part EVERY 2-3 minutes, for how long I dont know only listened to 50 min... sounds like it is the same problem on book 2 as well?? anyone know?"
,khayt,2012-06-24T06:25Z,"VERY DISAPPOINTING - unless you want an incomplete book DON'T DOWNLOAD.. THIS TORRENT SHOULD BE REMOVED. I  downloaded blackwood farm, and as I have read it before I know that these ""skips"" mentioned by others are sections of the recording that have somehow been removed. METALVEGETAX your intentions were great - my thanks - there are no other Anne Rice audiobooks I can find that have been compiled into single files. But, please check your work before uploading. "
