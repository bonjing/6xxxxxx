One question though, just out of curiosity: how come the file sizes vary so much?"

,fillinthisspace,2011-05-18T05:17Z,"reliant1,
I downloaded your torrent of the Terminator series and the quality was great, as I'm sure these will be. It's good to see people moving to encoding for quality rather than file size, but I'm curious.... why 900p?
Given the standard definitions seem to be either 1080p or 720p I'm just wondering why you choose 900p? Is there a particular reason for it I don't yet understand?"
[V],reliant1,2011-05-18T09:15Z,"optimal (vs 1080p) for encoding(time, efficiency), storing, distribution. plus for Wide XGA, Wide XGA+, SXGA+, UXGA Đ¸ WSXGA+ , etc HD devices. 
Iâm not bluray publisher or TV network, so i have limited resources."
