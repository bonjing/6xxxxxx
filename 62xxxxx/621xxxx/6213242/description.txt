               How can I write ISO files to CD or DVD?
 

Many products are posted as ISO-9660 image files. An ISO-9660 image file is 
an exact representation of a CD or DVD, including the content and the 
logical format. The most common use of an image file is to write it to 
a blank CD-R or DVD-R, resulting in an identical copy of the original disc 
including file name and volume label information. ISO image files may also be 
opened and their contents copied to a local folder, much like ZIP files. ISO 
files may also be virtually mounted and accessed as a device. These three
