This is a tool that i found that allows you to change the key installed in your kaspersky product. I have only used it with kasperksy internet security 2011, but should work with kaspersky antivirus as well. This works and does NOT require deleting your old key or disconnecting from the internet. make sure that you check the \"enable drag n drop support\" when you install the autohotkey. this was scanned with kis 2011 and numerous other scanners and found to be clean, if anything is found by you, then likely a false postive. instructions are included as well.
