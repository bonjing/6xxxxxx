Description:
Halo Custom Edition, sometimes abbreviated HaloCE, is the Online Multiplayer 
version of Halo. This is not freeware and does require a purchased, genuine
license to play online.

USB Edition Goal:
This is an updated version of the Cracked HaloCE released a few years back. The 
original author cracked it, then made it portable. He then used UHARC to 
compress into an 85mb executable. The executable was blue and named 'HaloCE.exe' 
with a happy face. 

Halo enthusiasts will know exactly what im referring to. Big props to the
author, as this version has been used, recycled, re-labled throughout the 
years. Just shows the mastery of his/her work. One of the greatest all-time
classic Warez. Just take a look around on the web, and you'll still see it 
floating around.

Upgrades:
1. I encapsulated everything, to make it stealth, and work from any location/
drive. The original version only worked if you put it in 'C://Halo Custom 
Edition'.
2. I also extended the portability to work on USB/Portable Media devices.
