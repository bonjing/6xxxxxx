Troubleshoot:Thumbnails not created
Reason:1- Maybe the required video codecs are not installed in your system. This software basically works on FFmpeg libraries.so you need to download and install a codec package like Vistacodec or K-Lite Megacodec to fix the problem. [both are free.]
Reason:2- Maybe your video file or output folder has UNICODE names like Chinese,Arabic etc. Be sure that all file and folder names are English only.
