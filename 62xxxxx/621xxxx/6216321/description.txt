Eddie Kirkland (August 16, 1923 â€“ February 27, 2011) was an American blues guitarist, harmonicist, singer, and songwriter.
Kirkland, known as the "Gypsy of the Blues" for his rigorous touring schedules, played and toured with John Lee Hooker from 1949 to 1962. After his period of working in tandem with Hooker he pursued a successful solo career, recording for RPM Records, Fortune Records, Volt Records, and King Records, sometimes under the stage name Eddie Kirk. Kirkland continued to tour, write and record albums until his death in February 2011.
Kirkland died in an automobile accident on the morning of February 27, 2011 in Crystal River, Florida in Citrus Country. The accident occurred at approximately 8:30 a.m. after a bus hit Kirkland's car, a 1998 Ford Taurus wagon. Reportedly Kirkland attempted to make a U-turn on U.S. 98 and Oak Park Boulevard, putting him directly in the path of a Greyhound bus. The bus struck the vehicle on the right side and pushed it approximately 200 feet from the point of impact. 
Kirkland suffered serious injuries and was transported by helicopter to Tampa General Hospital where died a short time later. The bus driver and 13 passengers on the bus were not hurt.
Kirkland was survived by a wife, Mary, and nine children. Kirkland was predeceased by one child Betty, and his first wife Ida.
