,AGlive,2011-04-12T14:48Z,"i have heard a lot about this show.. therefor i will give it a try :).... 

Thx a lot mkvGOD... Keep up the good work."
,AGlive,2011-04-12T17:31Z,"OK GUYS I JUST SAW THE FIRST EPISODE... No offense mkvGOD but the print is just not right.... i understand that to reduce the file size you have to make sacrifice (video quality), but the video quality is just too bad..... i was hoping to burn it on to my DVD and keep it as a collection but this kind of video quality is just not acceptable for a Collection.... But its pretty good if someone just wants to watch and delete the show and not collect it....... anyways here is my rating.

Video= 6.5/10 (for the reduce size i would give it 8.5/10)

Audio= 9/10"
,McQuefferson,2011-05-11T05:32Z,"I wouldn't judge the quality based on the first season, they were very low budget back then. Danny Devito wasn's evem committed yet."
,n4ch1k3th,2011-05-13T09:07Z,"Funniest shit....!!!!
