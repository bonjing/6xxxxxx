The following year, he put out his first solo album, â€œBlue Hand Johnnie,â€ the first of several well-received recordings including â€œJohnnie B. Bad.â€ He also toured extensively, playing with such superstars as the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton. When Johnson died in 2005 at age 80, he was at the height of his musical fame.
