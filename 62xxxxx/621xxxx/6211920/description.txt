Middle Class Misery.

This week Max Keiser and co-host, Stacy Herbert, talk about a Chinese gold standard and about sobering facts about the U.S. middle class. 


In the second half of the show, Max talks to John Butler of Amphora Capital about gold bugs, the duration paradox and holding dollars.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
