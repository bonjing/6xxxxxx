NeDiVx Notes:
Previous release is a mislabled BDRip, which require proof. It is most likely not even that, but a reencode of the following p2p release: Tangled.2010.Bluray.720p.DTS.x264-CHD which was floating around only hours before -AHole made their appearance. We believe other groups shouldn't hold back with preing from legitimate sources when there are suspicious "dvdrips" floating around from "one hit wonder" groups. Here's a Retail R2 rip with subs included.

credit NeDiVx & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
