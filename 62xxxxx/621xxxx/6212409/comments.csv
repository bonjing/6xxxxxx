,CaptPeacock,2011-03-22T19:43Z,Is this a trial version?  How do you run the FIX program?
,CaptPeacock,2011-03-26T01:53Z,There is no text file saying how to use the FIX.EXE file.  How is this done?  Do you copy the file to the install directory then run?  Are there any parameters to FIX.EXE?  Nothing I've tried works...
