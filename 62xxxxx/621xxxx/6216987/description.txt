Description:
I tried many of the portable dropbox version out there, but none of them has made me happy.
So I started to create my own DropboxPortableAHK, here it is.

Instructions:
1. start DropboxPortableAHK.exe
2. enter your preferred name for your new dropbox folder
3. go through the normal setup steps of dropbox (which is launched by DropboxPortableAHK.exe)
4. after finishing the setup steps, DropboxPortableAHK closes dropbox
5. choose wether you want to move your existing dropbox folder to the portable directory or let dropbox download all files
6. DropboxPortableAHK moves the dropbox folder to the current DropboxPortableAHK.exe directory
7. DropboxPortableAHK runs dropbox again -> Happy syncin'!

From now on, simply start DropboxPortableAHK.exe and you are done.
Even if you move from Vista/7 to XP (usb-stick) dropbox does not have to be set up again.
