,El-solo,2011-07-23T16:35Z,try using peerblock....i havent gotten a warning since ive started using it over a year ago
,dominick1290,2011-12-04T23:12Z,was gonna download until i saw the status about the copyright infringement thats bullshit there is no e-book for harry potter so what are we stealing were dealing something some guy invented that he is sharing? 
,hectorp212,2011-12-13T03:45Z,I don't know if these work for anyone else but it doesn't work with iPad
,rshook,2011-12-23T22:40Z,".azw files will work on the ipad as long as the kindle app is installed. There are other apps that will read epub files as well.

Also, if you get a copyright infringement notice do us all a favor and tell them you own a copy of the book and they can piss off until they put digital copies up for sale on amazon, google books, and barnes and noble. At least then they'll have a partial leg to stand on.

I imagine lots of illegal downloads will get their attention faster than clicking the stupid amazon ""request this book on kindle.""
