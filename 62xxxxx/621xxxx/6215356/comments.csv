Purim is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the Hebrew month of Adar, which usually falls sometime in February or March. Purim is such a popular holiday that the ancient rabbis declared that it alone would continue to be celebrated after the Messiah comes (Midrash Mishlei 9). All other holidays will not be celebrated in the messianic days.

Purim is so-called because the villain of the story, Haman, cast the ""pur"" (the lot) against the Jews yet failed to destroy them. Reading Purim Story is a central part of the Purim celebration."
