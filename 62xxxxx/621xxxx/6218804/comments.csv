,anfjavid,2011-04-09T06:11Z,"Dude, unlike BD TS 2010, in 2011 the registration is mandatory. I registered with a valid email account and the bitdefender website shows product status as evaluating. I applied a 13000 days patch. 

Will BD come to know about this if i update it after the evaluation period and blacklist my IP address (though i have a dynamic address ? ). Is it safe to stay with the patch or i should uninstall it and re-install with a genuine key given by yours ?

Plz help mate"
[T],dada_sh,2011-04-09T10:10Z,"@ /anfjavid/,  Buddy i advice you uninstalling your old patched Antivirus, cleaning your registry & download the latest release of the software from source: http://www.bitdefender.com/world/Downloads/ during installation & when the software ask for serial insert the genuine license provided in my torrentâ€¦ continue & enjoy a fresh & safe setting

,rocky040,2011-06-17T09:06Z,thanku man.. but it is showing valid for 152 days only....
,quietcity,2011-06-20T00:38Z,"Excellent torrent (as usual)...
Works perfect, no issues. Thanks for sharing mate! :-)

@ rocky040
Please, read carefully the info from up-loader! This key give you 257 days from the date specified above, NOT FROM THE DATE YOU HAVE USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME! So it is normal you get 152 days since you have installed this on June 17, 2011
If you want 365 days - the procedure is very simple, just find $39.95 and - voila! :-)"
[T],dada_sh,2011-06-20T18:18Z,"Thank you quietcity, guys for a 606 days genuine license refer to: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6482270/BitDefender_Antivirus_Pro_2011_(606_days_Genuine_License)
