As Autumn Falls are a five-piece metalcore band hailing from Edinburgh, and have spent the last few years honing their style into something truly unique; blending elements alternative screamo and mainstream hardcore into something altogether more involving and melodic.

Having established themselves with their energetic live shows, they've proudly shared stages with the likes of Azriel, Maths, Young Guns, Yashin, Bury Tomomorrow, The Casino Brawl and Shadows Chasing Ghosts, they have been back in the studio and present their second EP Seeing Is Believing!
