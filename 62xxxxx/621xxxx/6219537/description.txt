The bandâ€™s full-length album, Encounter, was released stateside October 12th.  The album is distributed by Spinside Records, the artist-centric imprint and new division of Inside Recordings, the independent label formed by Jackson Browne and his management team. "Encounter is a hook fueled, emotional songscape - with powerful tracks and soaring, achingly beautiful vocals . . . â€ says Browne of the duoâ€™s release.

 

Moguai stated, "Working with The Green Children was really an honor for me, I like what they do, their story and what they represent. MillaÂ´s voice is absolutely outstanding, and listening to the original track was so inspiring, that I ended up making two versions of the remix. There were just too many ideas floating in my head.  Meeting them after a gig in DÃ¼sseldorf (Germany) was a pleasure, itâ€™s the music that connects!"
