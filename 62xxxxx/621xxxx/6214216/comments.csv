LaRouche is a certifiably psychotic fascist, racist, and anti-semitic lunatic with a long and disgusting record of extreme and extremist causes."

This was done and posted to help with anyone's own research, so any view is appreciated!
Therefore it's better to know even worst case of offenders opinions and sift out the grain of truth even from such sources. Just use critical thinking (I know it is quite scarce right now, but anyway) and everything will be OK!"
