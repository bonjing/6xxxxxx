About game:
The third entry to Dawn of War 2, Retribution, targets rabid fans that can't get
enough of the franchise while also appealing to those who haven't tried it all. As a
$30 stand-alone expansion it's easy to recommend, because despite its comparatively
less exciting narrative, it still has a great set of missions, a lot of tactical options,
multiplayer, and the same fun Dawn of War mechanics the franchise was founded on.

Installation:
1. Install
2. Play 
3.No crack/serial needed

Uploader Note: I didn't tested but from some private torrent sites seems to work (block steamclient.dll on your av to avoid to be 

moved on quarantine) , anyway seedboxes supported so download and test it by yourself if you want and search the web for more 

details.
