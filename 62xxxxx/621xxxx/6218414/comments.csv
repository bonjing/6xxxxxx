I would apprecate you not posting other links on my torrents. I resepct other torrent providers so I expect you to do the same!"
,TorrentChick,2011-03-04T20:19Z,"I haven't finished downloading it, but I hope it works. If anyone has as information on how they got it to work that would be much appreciated. "

,TorrentChick,2011-03-04T21:44Z,I just installed the game and clicked the exe on my desktop and it worked flawlessly so far. (Though I have only tried campaign so far)
,serryale,2011-03-04T22:15Z,"can anyone say if playing with AI works?only campaign works for me, for other singleplayer it gives me error.Plus i think because there is logged in with a steam account,the game moves slow,i had the previous  two DOW 2 and i had no problem."
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-04T22:22Z,"@ ChrisBear , thanks dude, I was worried about that, my steam account is important to me, I bought the first two games of this, and then played the Retribution Beta, but there were some real dick heads on that, so I can't be bothered with the multiplayer for retribution I'll keep playing Dow2 for multiplayer and wait until retribution is in a steam sale."

Is this something to do with Windows 7?

I had the other two on WinXP and they worked fine. I know very little about Windows 7 though...

Can anyone help me out here since I see some of you got it running?"
,mhuitt,2011-03-04T22:56Z,"Sorry for the earlier posts. IE doesn't some to register and kept giving me a page error. Even after reloading those posts didn't appear till now. So I download Firefox which doesn't appear to have that error.

But no, I get no send error report. The only message I get is when I click on the executable in desktop or c:\games\folder

""Game is not being run as a known Dawn of War II product. Try again by launching game from Steam"" - that's the error message I get."

I cannot start the install because of it. I even downloaded the damn file and placed it into system32 folder but it doesn`t do the trick.

i get that error, how do u fix it?"
,mhuitt,2011-03-05T00:25Z,"Well, I don't have an anti-virus installed.

I've gone into the Win7 Firewall program, added in the DoW2R program and Steamclient.dll, then removed the check mark from them.

Still get the same message."

,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-05T04:04Z,this is working good for me
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-05T04:08Z,"doesn't seem to access steam at all, so all good"
,sage1210,2011-03-05T11:06Z,"hmmmm.....i can only play the campaign too.

skirmish is not work (error with ask me to send a report). more than that i doubt why even ""test performance"" also has the same issue ?

may be i will try another torrent ?"
,ChrisBear,2011-03-05T11:44Z,you wont be able to play multiplayer with cracked versions as it runs through steam. Which in turn will need your steam account which will in turn get your account banned as they will probably detect it.
,tyrael,2011-03-05T11:45Z,"@ anyone with ISDone.dll problem

i encountered this error and found a way:
the way of fixing this problem is almost idiotically simple.
basically you CAN'T type the install path using keyboard - you HAVE TO click your way through folders to select desired location. i tried several times using keyboard switching lower-case and upper-case to match my folder names (even tho it shouldnt be case sensitive) and even after selecting folder by mouse/browse button and erasing one character just to type it in again the same way by keyboard i got this error. that led me to only one conclusion - no keyboard typing, mouse clicks only lol...and poof, no ISDone.dll error!"
,tyrael,2011-03-05T11:48Z,"this is a real deal so no worries, the game works and here is some proof (i made those screens myself):

i hope this helps someone, if so dont be shy, post a feedback.
thank you extremezone! you're da man!"
,Naltarion,2011-03-05T12:23Z,"ChrisBear says:

So even skirmish with PC is blocked?"
,auberon82,2011-03-05T12:58Z,"Ok, i cant get this to work. I get the same steam bullshit over again.

I blocked the game.exe in my fw with no results and I can honestly say I ain't got a frigging clue how to deal with this steamclient.dll. I cant tell my av or my fw to do nothing with it, since it is no exe.

It seems to me like not everybody gets the steamsheet or everybody get over it like the next step.

A hand pls?"
,barbaneli,2011-03-05T13:04Z,"@tyrael

The installer has problems with changing the install path. Your solution is not working and the installer does not accept even a manually created folder. 

Only way to install at the moment is to use the default installation directory and just accept next."
,buchanko,2011-03-05T13:35Z,"This torrent file is from skidrow and it's a repack.

,tyrael,2011-03-05T20:44Z,"@barbaneli
i didnt say all this to point out manually created folder. the important thing is to choose the install path using browse button NOT by typing it with keyboard so the DoWar2R intall folder has to stay but you can customize disk/partition on which the installer will create it.
just click browse, select the folder you keep your games in and installer will add DoWar2R folder in which the game will be installed. i srsly dunno how to say it in better way.
i myself installed (NOT moved/copied after installation) to g:\games2\DoWar2R\ using this 'method' so it must be possible. it *may* be somehow system dependent, i am on win xp pro sp2 x86."

,nicoloff49,2011-03-06T00:56Z,As everyone knows if you read the earlier posts...Campaign is the only item that works on this version. The game takes quite awhile to install.
,nicoloff49,2011-03-06T00:58Z,For anyone that has had problems with the steam message coming up and such when you double click on the .exe try de-activating your Anti-Virus then while the game is up and running minimize it and re-activate it. Worked for me.

,shadowvenom,2011-03-06T16:10Z,the game works fine but you  you cant adjust the settings everything is on low and that sucks but adleast you can play it lets hope some one releases one that we can adjust but for now this will have to do

don't make me laugh man !!

who will spend much time like that ?

,streetbum149,2011-03-29T19:19Z,"you could call it an expansion since technically you cant play skirmish in this torrent. but the campaign is much more ""full"" or expanded upon than the last 2 damn of war campaign's. you can play as any of the six races now implemented. space marines, imperial guard, chaos marines, eldar, tiranid's, and ork's. and the amount of missions is quite expansive. will certainly eat alot of hours out of your day. on a side note the game itself has a skirmish mode but the torrent is bugged and wont allow it for some reason. so if you were gonna buy the game and decided not to with no skirmish and all than no worry's. as far as i can tell all the campaign missions work in this torrent tho. have fun gamein."
,jasperz0r,2011-03-30T01:51Z,"thanks a lot for the info, but what I realy meant was, do I need the original Dawn of War 2 for this or not?, if I do I have to download that one to, but if I don't need it then yay."
,jasperz0r,2011-03-30T08:02Z,"ok, so I installed it, normaly it takes about 5 minutes to install a game on my pc, this took about 30 minutes, and everytime I have to go to a menu, it takes another 30 minutes to load, and on top of that, the game is shit."
,Everqueen,2011-03-30T11:33Z,"Gents! This file has a Trojan in it! Sorry extremezone! Had to notify the public, maybe re upload with out the trojan"
,streetbum149,2011-03-30T13:57Z,"no trojan's in this torrent, if there is im not getting it. most likely a false positive (avg does that shit to me all the time, especially with trainers and cracks). @jasperz0r sounds like you need to upgrade your pc mate. make no mistake this game is very harsh on your hardware. if you dont have the money (like me) id recommend company of heroes, another good game by relic\thq of the rts genre. its alot less harsh on the graphics, but alas it is yet another ww2 game.

,jasperz0r,2011-03-30T23:29Z,"@streetbum149 I have the latest pc tech avalible, the biggest baddest Videocard, and an I7 extreme quad, 12g drive memory overclocked to 5.0, and 5 terrabyte memory if this cannot drive this game, nothing can, and I have Company of Heroes, that game totaly kicks ass."
,mikefrombrooklyn,2011-03-31T03:01Z,"Getting an odd error:

Game is not being run as a known Dawn of War11 product. Try again by laucnhing game from steam.

Anything I can do?"
,streetbum149,2011-03-31T16:42Z,"@jasperz0r ah ok my bad then. ya coh is a great game, and it runs like a champ on my pc (asus Xtreame Design hybrid m4a89gtd pro\usb3 motherboard, 1tb hard drive, 4gb mem, amd quad core phenom black edition 3.2 ghz, on board graphics, nothing overclocked to prolong lifespan) which is obviously not that great. dont know why they didnt stick with that engine for dow2 instead of the crappy-cartoonish looking engine, all they had to do was implement melee. well good gameing to ya lads. im off to smoke a bowl and play some killing floor.

Here's the quick solution : Right click on DOW2.exe and select the option ""Run as administrator..."". Game will launch with no questions asked."

,retado,2011-05-14T21:52Z,"Game works fine. Only problem is that the installation takes forever. Leave it running and play something else, like Portal 2 ;)

1- You don't need any previous versions.

2- This one has its own campaign and thats it. If you want to play the real storyline campaigns, download the Chaos Rising standalone.

3- Skirmishes don't work, probably because you can only create these games while logged to Steam.

4- Multiplayer, don't even ask for it to work."
,Nigs_R_Us,2011-05-15T21:18Z,"New to torrents and i wanted to know if theres any installing specifications i should know about, like (cracks, aux installers, etc.) for this game. And if the game is also in another language as is the installment instructions."
,streetbum149,2011-05-17T11:26Z,"game is in english but you may be able to change the language, haven't tried. everything needed to run\install the game should come with torrent, if you want you can use the cheat-mod with it tho which i am. just be sure to edit your exe short-cut with -dev in shortcut-property's-target."
,johnnysawyer,2011-05-19T21:39Z,Any fix to ISdone.dll error ?

,HD_DLER,2011-06-27T16:32Z,can i only play campaign on this game? 
,13maniacs,2011-06-27T17:21Z,"@Prandur  When it says ""Current Steam account does not own this Dawn of War II product. Switch Steam accounts and try again."" Just run the program as administrator and it should work"

,Yenrock7,2011-08-18T10:21Z,I will try to Install on the folder which the game provided and hopefully it might work. The UNINSTALL was just 1 second. I can't hardly believe it. BUT the Setup was around 20 minutes or so.
