,what6733,2011-03-05T15:26Z,Can't unzip or install nothing :(
,fltsimbloke,2011-03-06T03:31Z,"Thanks for this.  I am sick and tired of these guys charging an arm and a leg for their ""new"" versions.

I bought version ProX2 and ProX3.  Before that I had bought Videostudio 7, 9.  Now they have a few new features and they are charging $80 for an ""update"".  Give me a break, and they wonder why folks pirate software.  How about charging $25 bucks for the update from X3 to X4.
"
,fltsimbloke,2011-03-06T04:30Z,"Installation appears to have worked great.  I am testing now.

Just a note, must start up the software in the trial mode, then shut down, then start up again.  Upon start up it will ask you for registration option, click the purchased register button on the bottom left corner, then you will get the phone Corel option.

then follow the provided instructions."

,etarip375,2011-03-19T09:41Z,"Thanks nikita200. How to install this in EN-US language when your Windows language is different?! It automatically chooses your Windows language and there is no way to change it! Neither in the program nor ""by hand"" (it changes only menu, but not effects names e.g.)."
,Danielzxzx,2011-03-20T20:48Z,So how do I get the installation code?

 ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..  

Cut the internet off / or block the application with your favorite firewall during the activation. Run the keygen, enter the serial and choose phone corel => enter the obtained installation code in the keygen to get your personal activation code .. "
,unispirit,2011-03-31T01:38Z,"Tried to follow the instructions, but after install I only get a window reading: ""Corel Videostudio Pro X4"" - with the only options to cancel or abort the installation process. No place to put in the serial, and the ""Next"" button is greyed out.

Any suggestions what I might have done wrong? I run on a Windows 7 64-bit O/S"
,tophtml,2011-03-31T03:51Z,Installed like a dream and works great.
,unispirit,2011-03-31T23:45Z,"Found the solution, in case anyone got the same problem:

Installed and working :)"
,xDJCJx,2011-04-05T02:14Z,It says i Cant do it because I running a windows 64 bit or something like that
,colinb74,2011-04-06T02:23Z,Thanks uploader. Great software! Clean files!! Works 100% :D 
,toxic_elvis,2011-04-09T18:57Z,Tnx You nikita200!!!
,fotografik,2011-04-24T09:53Z,"All I have are a bunch of zip files with archives inside of them, and I have no idea how to start the install.  There doesn't appear to be any documentation that says what to do with all these zipped folders."
,fotografik,2011-04-25T06:47Z,Okay.  I figured it out.  Thanks for the up!
,fotografik,2011-04-26T20:52Z,"Okay...now that I have finally have had time to use this software, let's just say I'm glad I got it here and didn't pay for it.  I'm running an 8 core processor and this thing uses only one.  Slower than hell.  I didn't realize it is only a 32 bit native app.  Hard to believe that any developer wouldn't offer a 64 bit version of a fucking video editor."
,PlasticFork,2011-05-02T05:24Z,"Thanks for the upload, much appreciated."
,sonalux2005,2011-06-25T15:20Z,"i have downloaded it...when i open the keygen, what is the installation code should i provide? Also what is the activation code?"
,sonalux2005,2011-06-26T01:53Z,Nikita200 Thank you so much. I figured it all out...:) It is a gr8 download...:)
,lollygreen,2011-07-02T10:38Z,"I downloaded it and its says that file 17 is broken which is Cr-9g0h, has anyone else had this and it still work? Is there a quicker way to open all files at once as I am doing them one by one, and its so slow?

With Gratitude

Lolly"
,Slammer94,2011-07-05T06:11Z,"Awesome. Works great. Just to clarify the installation instructions (Thanks there fltsimbloke; was really lost without your note) After you install it, chose the option to register late or start the trial or whatever it was (the other two options are the register it via internet or offline; neither will work) and then close the program. Open it up again, and click the register button in the bottom left of that screen. Open the keygen and select the right product from the dropdown list (should be the last one) then copy the only number sequence in the keygen to that window where it asks for one. This will let you click the phone option. Copy the other number sequence it gives you into the top ""registration"" box in the keygen and hit generate. Then copy the new number sequence it gives you into the remaining box in the registration window. BUT MAKE SURE YOUR INTERNET IS TURNED OFF FROM THE TIME YOU START THE INSTALLATION UNTIL THE TIME YOU HIT ""OK"" FOR THAT REGISTRATION! OTHERWISE IT'LL GIVE YOU PROBLEMS! After that, you can turn internet back on and be just peachy. I wonder if you can update it... probably not. Best not to try to. Hope this helps someone and makes the installation instructions a little clearer. Great upload by the way! Ignore the false positive for the keygen, 99% of the time keygens are false positives anyway, and this one is clean."
,anonymous292114,2011-07-28T21:03Z,"Instructions for activation

Disable network connections and keep disabled until the end of the activation.

Install, then start.
Register using valid email and password
Of course you get an error. 
On the error page try several times until you can continue and register later.
Open the program and then exit it.
You get an exit screen where at the bottum is a button: already purchased.
Press it to start the activation.

Now there are 3 codes:
1. SERIAL: Generated by keygen after selection of the correct product.
2. INSTALLATION: Generated by activation screen if you press PHONE 
3. ACTIVATION: Generated by keygen after entering the INSTALLATION code including the -

So: with the keygen generate a SERIAL. Open keygen and select the correct product. A serial will be generated.

Enter the SERIAL in the Corel activation screen and select Phone Corel to get the INSTALLATION code.

Put INSTALLATION code with - in keygen to get the ACTIVATION code. 

Finally paste the INSTALLATION code in the Corel screen. That is it.

Now reconnect network."
