Features that make Titanium Maximum Security our best product yet
SPAM-BLOCKER
Finds and blocks annoying and dangerous junk email and image spams. The real-time spam detection provides immediate protection from outbreaks.

REAL-TIME UPDATES
Safeguard you from the latest on-line threats today and in the future. Titanium Maximum Security leverages Trend Microâ€™s Smart Protection Networkâ„¢ plus real-time antivirus scanning to provide always-on-guard protection keeping you safe from latest, ever-evolving malware threats.

PARENTAL CONTROLS
Protect your children from inappropriate websites, limit their time on the Internet, and see detailed reports about what they do online, without having to look over their shoulders.

DATA THEFT PREVENTION
Prevent hackers and spyware from stealing credit card numbers, passwords, email addresses, and other sensitive data. 

Stop protected data from going into web pages, email messages or instant messaging. Use the pre-defined categories or set new ones of your own. Putting just part of a word or number into the Data Theft Prevention list can still protect the whole thing. For example, entering just the last four digits or your credit card can block spyware from getting the entire number.

TREND MICRO VAULT
A password protected folder that can safeguard your sensitive files. If your computer is lost or stolen, you can remotely lock this vault to keep these files safe.

SECURE ERASE
Deleting a file just removes the directory information used to find it, but not the actual data. Secure Erase overwrites deleted files with random data, so that the contents canâ€™t be retrieved.

SYSTEM TUNER
Recover disk space, make MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® start faster, clean out your instant messaging history, and optimise your computerâ€™s performance. Schedule automatic tune-ups to keep your PC running smoothly.

LIGHT ON SYSTEM RESOURCES
Titanium is powered by Trend Microâ„¢ Smart Protection Networkâ„¢ which gathers and analyses threat data, blocking viruses and other malware BEFORE they can reach your PC. Because the processing is done â€œin the cloudâ€, Titanium uses less of your PCâ€™s memory and disk space, so it wonâ€™t slow you down.

DETAILED SECURITY REPORTS
Easy to read graphic reports provide you with all the details about the threats that attack your computer. You can drill down into detailed logs with just one click.
