Release Title: King Arthur 2004 EXTENDED DC 720p BRRip H.264 AAC-TheFalcon007(HDScene-Release)
Storyline: Based on a more realistic portrayal of "Arthur" than has ever been presented onscreen. The film will focus on the history and politics of the period during which Arthur ruled -- when the Roman empire collapsed and skirmishes over power broke out in outlying countries -- as opposed to the mystical elements of the tale on which past Arthur films have focused.
