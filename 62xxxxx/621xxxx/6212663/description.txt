Inside:

shaolin.m4v
shaolin2011.srt


This is a complete version of dvd rip in m4v format with complete subtitles that make sense. 

As a native Chinese speaker I finally broke down to translate this movie myself after looking for an okay subtitle for days, just because I want to watch it with my English speaking friends. 

This is my first time making subtitles and uploading to pirate so I apologize if I could do better.

Watch with VLC and select subtitle track from Video > Subtitles track > track 1 [English]

Thank you and enjoy!
