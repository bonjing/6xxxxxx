           Mark and David are best friends, photo journalists going       
           from war to war. In the spring of 1988, they're in             
           Kurdistan, at an isolated mountain clinic, waiting for an      
           offensive. David's had enough - he wants to go home to         
           Dublin to his pregnant wife. He leaves, with Mark              
           promising to follow in a few days. A week or so later,         
           Mark's home after being wounded, but David's not been          
           heard from. Mark's slow recovery and uncharacteristic          
           behavior alarm his girlfriend, Elena, who asks her             
           grandfather, a Spanish psychologist, to come to Dublin to      
           help. Are there things the carefree and detached               
           journalist is bottling up? Is he a casualty of war?
