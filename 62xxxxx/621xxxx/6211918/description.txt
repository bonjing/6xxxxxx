Jerry McCain earned the nickname "Boogie" when he began playing harmonica on the streets of Gadsden at the age of five. Several of his uncles played the harmonica, and his mother and aunt played guitar in the church, but his real musical influences were the blues musicians he heard on the jukebox at his father's barbecue stand when he was growing up in the 1930s and '40s. He began imitating the sound of blues legends Sonny Boy Williamson and Sonny Terry. It was the music of Little Walter that inspired McCain to launch his own recording career.
He made his first commercial recording in 1953 on the Trumpet label in Jackson, Mississippi and has since recorded on a variety of blues labels. His most recent album, I've Got the Blues All Over Me , is his fourth for Ichiban Records since 1989. He recorded his best known song, "She's Tough," in 1960, which was covered by the Fabulous Thunderbirds.

Frank Frost was born on April 15, 1936, as Frank Ottis Frost, in Auvergne, Arkansas. His first exposure to music came as a young child when he learned to play the piano for the choirs in his family's church. At the age of 15, he moved to St. Louis, where he teamed with harmonica player, Little Willie Foster and began to learn both the harp and the guitar. While with Foster, Frost met Sam Carr, the son of the legendary Delta guitarist, Robert Nighthawk. The two became fast friends and decided to put their own band together in 1954, a venture that was short-lived at the time as they soon took on the role of backing harmonica great, Sonny Boy Williamson. In 1959, the two left Williamson and headed to Mississippi, once again to form their own band. Three years later, they hooked up with guitarist, Big Jack Johnson and began to call themselves Frank Frost and The Nighthawks.
    The trio caught the attention of Sun Records owner Sam Phillips. He brought them to Memphis in 1962 and they put together their first recording "Big Boss Man!" for his newly created Phillips International label. Three years later, they were in Nashville, working with Elvis Presley's guitarist, Scotty Moore for yet another LP on the Jewel label that saw a minor hit single for them with "My Back Scratcher" (a take-off on the Slim Harpo song, "Baby Scratch My Back").
    The group disbanded in 1975, but reunited again in 1979 with the new name The Jelly Roll Kings. Under this name, they became the first artists to record for the newly founded Earwig Records, releasing "Rockin' The Juke Joint Down" that same year. The band thrived over the next two decades as the preeminent example of modern Delta Blues. Big Jack Johnson eventually left to pursue a solo career, but Frost and Carr continued under the name, adding guitarist Fred James to the mix.
    Frost would also have a successful solo career. He released several albums under his own name including the acclaimed, "Deep Blues" in 1992. He could also be seen in a commercial for presidential candidate Bill Clinton, as well as a short performance in the film, "Crossroads". The Jelly Roll Kings were also featured on the soundtrack for the Blues documentary "Deep Blues".
