
What a beautiful story for the young at heart of all ages, and especially for children. The music is fantastic! The main character is Daniel the dolphin, and his journey is a great metaphor for the self-discovery journey. His sidekick is a lovable squid, who adds just the right kind of clean humor that kids love. The animation is good, and the colors are splendid. The story line is simple for children to understand but includes just the right amount of suspense.
