This is a voice collection from a series of torrents available on thepiratebay.org.  I tested everything contained in this set using the included reader Text Aloud, on Windows 7 x64 SP1.

I would recommend for some avoiding dates in numbers, some (crystal/mike I know for sure) pronounce them as xxhundredxx such as 1938 as ninteen hundred thirty eight instead of nineteen thirty eight.

Can't seems to be better when replaced by cannot or can not.

Neo voices can't pronounce "sounds" like aaghh..they spell them....quickly.

Of the test material I tried (the first story of the "Complete Robot" A Boy's Best Friend by Isaac Asimov) I found the voices to be as follows (Mary is an M$ voice, and is not included in this torrent)
Ordered first by rating second by alphabet
(fix the "sounds" problem and you have the absolute best!)
