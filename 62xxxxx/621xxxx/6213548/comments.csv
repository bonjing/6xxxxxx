,Tsuris,2011-03-02T14:37Z,Samples of each (original files created and shrunken .m4a files) are also included so you can get a good sample of each.

Thank you for the comment :)
As far as the download, my upload is slow (25@daytime 45@night).  If you want to save time either download only the small samples or no samples, they are just to help make the choice of downloading fewer pieces for those who want only one voice."
,ekarth22,2011-03-05T04:49Z,"With all respect Mr.Tsuris,
Neospeech Julie is better than Bridget, i tried them both.

Bridget sounds more human like but her rhythm and speed is not good like Julie.

But thanks very very much for uploading this AIO torrent, I wish people will seed this for a year."
,Tsuris,2011-03-05T07:54Z,"No Mr. needed (am a guy but still young..i hope :P) Each will have their own opinion, i prefer the tone of Julie but bridget sounds more natural and that was what mattered to me (also in speak to file bridget goes about 2-5x as fast, again all a matter of preference).  As a question to all interested in scifi, i am looking to create a mass Isaac Asimov torrent, with actual voices (where available) and tts where not, does anyone else have a preference on the voice chosen?"
[T],Huggybaby,2011-04-24T04:58Z,"Tsuris you are right, Bridget is excellent. Thank you for the torrent.

I remember before Vista/7 came out, there were going to be more voices than just Anna, I wonder what happened?

BTW, Freespace SCP can use these ""speakers""."
[T],Huggybaby,2011-04-24T05:00Z,"PS It's hard to believe, but AT&T has definitely been surpassed (to my ears) by the NeoSpeech options."

Sounds like better version of Siri.
Thank u very much indeed!!!!!!!"
,Tsuris,2012-03-05T13:49Z,never heard siri (not counting tv) but I like bridget as well :)
,xxptlare,2012-04-08T23:39Z,"Hi and thank you for the torrent. 

And also, to people who are new to text-to-speach English voices, I recommend ""Paul"". It is by *far* superior to all other voices I've tried, and I've tried pretty much all of them. Trust me, I use TTS for years now. And as for software, I recommend ""NaturalReader"". Google it and you'll find it on torrent sites.

So to recap:

Best Voice: -Paul- [by NeoSpeech]

Best Software: -NaturalReader-"
