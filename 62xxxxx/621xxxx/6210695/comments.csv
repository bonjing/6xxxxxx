If you want supersonic, 640Kbps 6ch audio, but don't care too much about the video detail, this is your torrent.  However, if you don't want to watch a super softened movie that lacks most of the fine detail (wrinkles, hair, etc.), then I recommend something else.  Should've taken half the data bits thrown away on 640Kbps audio and used it for the video to improve the quality.  The video is very clean, it's just ultra softened for a 1.6GB, 720P BRRIP.  I deleted it and downloaded another torrent."
