,Sacred_Pillow,2011-03-16T20:04Z,"EnkiEa, I too am a Christian. I have been a guilty sinner just like the rest of the human race, but because of Christ's sacrifice God holds me guiltless. If you are also a Christian as you say you are, then I must exhort you to present a better testimony than you have in your writing.

James 3:9-12 says
""Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.""

Paul says in Ephesians 4:29 ""Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.""

He also says in Romans 12:14 ""Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.""

Understand that I am not writing this in self-righteousness, because I have none. I am just a sinner saved by God's grace, and the only righteousness I have is through Christ. I am only trying to do what Hebrews 10:24 tells me: ""And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works."" "
