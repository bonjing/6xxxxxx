Matthew 25:14-30

   14 "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. 15 To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.

   19 "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'

   21 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'

   22 "The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'

   23 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'

   24 "Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'

   26 "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

   28 "'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

I am so tired of hearing this nonsense go back and forth, over and over again...

"This is better... That's better..."

Listen, snap out of it...  You get what you pay for...

This is "piracy", not "Tech Support"...

When it comes to "Trolls", they are like a 10 year old kid, with their face pressed against the glass, waiting for the store to open the day after Christmas; bouncing up and down, doing the "Pee-Pee Dance", because they "just can't wait" for that "latest-greatest Mortal Kombat" video game, that they were too cheap to actually BUY, yet MAKE A BIG ASSED FUCKING SCENE about how they don't want THE LAST VERSION because it won't play on their PLAYSTATION 2...!!!

This concept needs to be understood...

(A.K.A. "The-Arfen", "Cuelebre", "zakimar", "L.E.F", "mygirlscock", "baracas", "sssamridh", krautschneider, nervin, bigbluesea, etc...)

I'm gonna do THIS like we were back in the Marines, and I want you ALL to understand this, that ANY time that one of these assholes "Trolls" the fuck up in HERE, and GRAFFITI on my fucking walls, I'm going to PULL THAT FILE DOWN, rebuild it, ADD AND LAMINATE THEIR FUCKING NAMES TO THE "TOP 100 TROLLS MOST WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE" LIST, and then let the REST of you INNOCENT PEOPLE who PAID THE PRICE and have to DOWNLOAD IT TWICE, be CRUCIFIED like CHRIST, such that ANYONE who SEES ONE OF THESE TROLLS, or ANYONE who fucking DARE to TEMPT THE WRATH OF GOD, be EXPOSED TO THE WORLD by EVERYONE OF YOU ALL THAT SUFFERED, and SHOOT THESE "TROLLS" ON FUCKING SIGHT...!!!

I "Double-Fucking-Dog-Dare" you to TALK ANY SHIT, or say ANYTHING FUCKING NEGATIVE, on MY WALLS, in MY HOUSE...!!!

(NOBODY wastes MY fucking time...!!!)

These imbeciles, however, fail to comprehend that as "new" software is developed, there is still a shit-ton of computers on the Planet THAT STILL REQUIRE "This old and outdated software (A.K.A. "The-Arfen")"...

See, the thing about "Trolls", is that you NEVER KNOW if they were born that way, or if they had to get a scholarship to "Hogwarts"...

Suffice it to say, there are MULTIPLE approaches to a common solution...

That's where I come in...

I just want to see the beauty and genius that arises from the Planet of my species, unhindered by the restrictions of the New World Order...

Now, listening to people argue about which is the most preferable solution, to a crippled application, is about as enthusing as taking a "Troll" to the "Prom"...   Trouncing the fuck up in here, like this was the fucking "Simpson's" and you were commenting on "~The Worst Torrent Ever~"...   Fuck off with that nonsense...!!!

IF I WANTED YOUR DRAMA IN MY LIVING ROOM, I'D BUY A FUCKING TELEVISION...!!!

So, quit fucking bitching about shit, and go do something productive, like fighting the Vatican and the New World Order...!!!

Now, wake the fuck up, and start getting right with Jesus...!!!

There is absolutely ZERO reason for you to be HERE, and I want everyone to acknowledge, that if YOU don't want this torrent, then get the FUCK out of here...!!!

Every file that I post, is 100%, and ANYONE who tries to tell you DIFFERENT, is by definition "lying to your face"...

See, now here's the part about it...

Each one of these Trolls has an individual agenda...  They are destroyers...

They prey on the naive...

They have no credulity, yet for the naive user, these Trolls intend to do nothing more than cast "doubt" over the strength and integrity of ANY torrent that conflicts with their invested interests...

These "Trolls", are called "Provocateurs"...

They mean ONLY to incite riot...


Now, I've completely lost my sense of humor about this subject...  So, I want this to be understood, SHOULD the thought, cross YOUR mind, to desecrate MY walls...  Every one of my files, come from my personal Library, to archive in the hands of my brethren, such that they flourish, and realize the divine craftsmanship of Almighty God, in turn plant ALL the seed of their yield, never knowing who is the next Michelangelo or Beethoven, nor would that opportunity ever befall them, should the work of YOUR own hands fail God's divine will...

There is an encryption, in the Bible, such that, if YOU try to stand between ME and New Jerusalem, I come armed with the Armor of God...

Ephesians 6:10-20

The Armor of God

 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord
 and in his mighty power.

 11 Put on the full armor of God,
 so that you can take your stand against the devilâ€™s schemes.

 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
 but against the rulers,
 against the authorities,
 against the powers of this dark world
 and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God,
 so that when the day of evil comes,
 you may be able to stand your ground,
 and after you have done everything,
 to stand.

 14 Stand firm then,
 with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
 with the breastplate of righteousness in place,

 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

 16 In addition to all this,
 take up the shield of faith,
 with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

 17 Take the helmet of salvation
 and the sword of the Spirit,
 which is the word of God. 

 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.
 With this in mind,
 be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lordâ€™s people.

 19 Pray also for me,
 that whenever I speak,
 words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,

 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains.
 Pray that I may declare it fearlessly,
 as I should.

Kaspersky - Internet Security 2011 (Lifetime Fail Safe)
_______________________________________________________


Now, let's get down to business...

What is contained in this torrent are three versions of the application, and three methodologies of the solution...

These are given in order of installation precedence, however, should you choose to utilize them, is at your discretion...

The first, by which it must be mentioned, that THIS is your LEAST preferred method, yet it MUST be installed first, should you choose to utilize it at a later date...

Such that, if you follow these instructions, you will have all three options available at a moment's notice, under all possible conditions...


This whole thing became an issue, when the "242.Kaspersky - Internet Security 2011 - [10 Year License Key]" had the "carpet pulled out from underneath it" just recently...

Before that, you would have been licensed for 3700 days...

Suffice it to say, those who wish to pursue the repair of such a solution, may wish to give it consideration for future releases...

Here, I will explain and offer these three methodologies as a "Lifetime Fail Safe" solution...


To begin, what is known as the "Trial Resetter", is exactly as it sounds...  It's a small applet that, in order to EVER be used, must be injected during the Installation Process, but before the Activation Process...  The result of which allows the user to reinitiate the file, and subsequently reset the "Trial Period" for Kaspersky back to "30-Days"...

Secondly, the "10 Year License Key"...  Until a couple weeks ago, this file would "Activate" Kaspersky for 3700 days without exception...  Alas, they pulled the carpet out from underneath it, by restricting directory permissions surrounding the file "fltlib.dll", and thus disabling the effect of the "10 Year License Key" upon system reboot...  However (upon reinitiation), the "10 Year License Key" is your ONLY "Fail Safe", as it does NOT require Internet access, nor authentication...

Which brings us to the "Blacklist Keys"...  These are a "God Send", and EXTREMELY USEFUL, but they come at a cost...  Namely, the "Blacklist Keys" are "handmade", by a "handful" of people...  TO WHICH YOU MUST OFFER YOUR RESPECT AND GRATITUDE...!!!  However, they STILL must be "created", which leads to "downtime"...


To summarize...  The "Blacklist Keys" are your first choice if they are available, and will remain active upon reboot, until the company "Kaspersky Labs" identifies them, at which point they are disabled, and the user must attain a new "Blacklist Key"...

The "10 Year License Key" is your 100% Fail Safe, that can be initiated WITHOUT internet access, REMAINS active for the duration that the computer is booted, is completely updatable, and is completely "transparent", such that the user DOES NOT receive ANY "Trial Notification" nag, like the "Trial Resetter" produces EVERY 5 minutes...

Last on the list, is the "Trial Resetter"...  All of the methodologies work and are solid solutions, however I (personally) can't stand the "Trial Resetter"...  Aside from "TROLLS", it's one of the more annoying nags on the Planet...  I would MUCH RATHER use the "Blacklist Keys (if available)", or the "10 Years License Key (upon system reboot)", simply so I don't have to see that fucking "Trial Version Nag" EVERY 5 MINUTES...

I would much rather (if I had to), use the "10 Year License Key", and consider it as a "60 Second Nag" to re-initiate the process upon every system reboot, for a fully functioning, completely updatable, non-authenticating, "Top-Shelf" Antivirus and Firewall solution...


Now, I'm tired and out of breath, so let's get this Show on the Road...

However, I want you to understand, that if THIS torrent gets pulled down, it's because I'm "under attack" by Trolls, and THEY don't want YOU to have THIS torrent, because it makes THEM look incompetent...  Thus, they will attack the integrity of this file, (or myself) to cause "doubt" in your mind, such that THEY would redirect your attention from HERE, to whichever malicious direction THEY COULD DECEIVE YOU to following...

Before you "Trust a Troll", verify that they HAVE EVER contributed a fucking thing to "progress"...


I'm working for God and Jesus, and if you trust in my word, I will meet you in New Jerusalem...
