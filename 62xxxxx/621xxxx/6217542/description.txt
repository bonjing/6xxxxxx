Matthew 25:14-30

   14 "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. 15 To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.

   19 "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'

   21 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'

   22 "The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'

   23 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'

   24 "Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'

   26 "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

   28 "'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

I am so tired of hearing this nonsense go back and forth, over and over again...

"This is better... That's better..."

Listen, snap out of it...  You get what you pay for...

This is "piracy", not "Tech Support"...

When it comes to "Trolls", they are like a 10 year old kid, with their face pressed against the glass, waiting for the store to open the day after Christmas; bouncing up and down, doing the "Pee-Pee Dance", because they "just can't wait" for that "latest-greatest Mortal Kombat" video game, that they were too cheap to actually BUY, yet MAKE A BIG ASSED FUCKING SCENE about how they don't want THE LAST VERSION because it won't play on their PLAYSTATION 2...!!!

This concept needs to be understood...

(A.K.A. "The-Arfen", "Cuelebre", "zakimar", "L.E.F", "mygirlscock", "baracas", "sssamridh", krautschneider, nervin, bigbluesea, etc...)

I'm gonna do THIS like we were back in the Marines, and I want you ALL to understand this, that ANY time that one of these assholes "Trolls" the fuck up in HERE, and GRAFFITI on my fucking walls, I'm going to PULL THAT FILE DOWN, rebuild it, ADD AND LAMINATE THEIR FUCKING NAMES TO THE "TOP 100 TROLLS MOST WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE" LIST, and then let the REST of you INNOCENT PEOPLE who PAID THE PRICE and have to DOWNLOAD IT TWICE, be CRUCIFIED like CHRIST, such that ANYONE who SEES ONE OF THESE TROLLS, or ANYONE who fucking DARE to TEMPT THE WRATH OF GOD, be EXPOSED TO THE WORLD by EVERYONE OF YOU ALL THAT SUFFERED, and SHOOT THESE "TROLLS" ON FUCKING SIGHT...!!!

I "Double-Fucking-Dog-Dare" you to TALK ANY SHIT, or say ANYTHING FUCKING NEGATIVE, on MY WALLS, in MY HOUSE...!!!

(NOBODY wastes MY fucking time...!!!)

These imbeciles, however, fail to comprehend that as "new" software is developed, there is still a shit-ton of computers on the Planet THAT STILL REQUIRE "This old and outdated software (A.K.A. "The-Arfen")"...

See, the thing about "Trolls", is that you NEVER KNOW if they were born that way, or if they had to get a scholarship to "Hogwarts"...

Suffice it to say, there are MULTIPLE approaches to a common solution...

That's where I come in...

I just want to see the beauty and genius that arises from the Planet of my species, unhindered by the restrictions of the New World Order...

Now, listening to people argue about which is the most preferable solution, to a crippled application, is about as enthusing as taking a "Troll" to the "Prom"...   Trouncing the fuck up in here, like this was the fucking "Simpson's" and you were commenting on "~The Worst Torrent Ever~"...   Fuck off with that nonsense...!!!

IF I WANTED YOUR DRAMA IN MY LIVING ROOM, I'D BUY A FUCKING TELEVISION...!!!

So, quit fucking bitching about shit, and go do something productive, like fighting the Vatican and the New World Order...!!!

Now, wake the fuck up, and start getting right with Jesus...!!!

Gentlemen, don't fuck with me...

You're going to sit back when this is done, and realize, that you might as well leave the fucking Planet, when EVERYBODY has a copy of the Platinum I give them...

At which point, they all read YOUR NAME...

IMMORTALIZED UNTIL THE RAPTURE OF GOD ALMIGHTY...!!!

Now, I want you to think about this, you "smart assed dumb shits", that nobody on the Planet is gonna want you, and if you fuck with ME, God ain't gonna have a fuckin' thing to do with you...

So, where's THAT leave you...?!?

I "Triple-Dog-Dare" you...!!!

Now, I'm tired and out of breath, so let's get this Show on the Road...

However, I want you to understand, that if THIS torrent gets pulled down, it's because I'm "under attack" by Trolls, and THEY don't want YOU to have THIS torrent, because it makes THEM look incompetent...  Thus, they will attack the integrity of this file, (or myself) to cause "doubt" in your mind, such that THEY would redirect your attention from HERE, to whichever malicious direction THEY COULD DECEIVE YOU to following...

Before you "Trust a Troll", verify that they HAVE EVER contributed a fucking thing to "progress"...

There is absolutely ZERO reason for you to be HERE, and I want everyone to acknowledge, that if YOU don't want this torrent, then get the FUCK out of here...!!!

Every file that I post, is 100%, and ANYONE who tries to tell you DIFFERENT, is by definition "lying to your face"...

See, now here's the part about it...

Each one of these Trolls has an individual agenda...  They are destroyers...

They prey on the naive...

They have no credulity, yet for the naive user, these Trolls intend to do nothing more than cast "doubt" over the strength and integrity of ANY torrent that conflicts with their invested interests...

These "Trolls", are called "Provocateurs"...

They mean ONLY to incite riot...


Now, I've completely lost my sense of humor about this subject...  So, I want this to be understood, SHOULD the thought, cross YOUR mind, to desecrate MY walls...  Every one of my files, come from my personal Library, to archive in the hands of my brethren, such that they flourish, and realize the divine craftsmanship of Almighty God, in turn plant ALL the seed of their yield, never knowing who is the next Michelangelo or Beethoven, nor would that opportunity ever befall them, should the work of YOUR own hands fail God's divine will...

There is an encryption, in the Bible, such that, if YOU try to stand between ME and New Jerusalem, I come armed with the Armor of God...


###################################################################################


Ephesians 6:10-20

The Armor of God

 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord
 and in his mighty power.

 11 Put on the full armor of God,
 so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.

 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
 but against the rulers,
 against the authorities,
 against the powers of this dark world
 and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God,
 so that when the day of evil comes,
 you may be able to stand your ground,
 and after you have done everything,
 to stand.

 14 Stand firm then,
 with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
 with the breastplate of righteousness in place,

 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

 16 In addition to all this,
 take up the shield of faith,
 with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

 17 Take the helmet of salvation
 and the sword of the Spirit,
 which is the word of God. 

 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.
 With this in mind,
 be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.

 19 Pray also for me,
 that whenever I speak,
 words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known
 the mystery of the gospel,

 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains.
 Pray that I may declare it fearlessly,
 as I should.

Revo Uninstaller
________________


Revo Uninstaller, developed by the VS Revo Group, is a software utility for the Microsoft Windows operating system designed to be an alternative to the built-in Windows "Add/Remove Programs" control panel applet.

The main feature of Revo Uninstaller is to remove unnecessary files and registry entries left behind by incomplete program uninstallation routines.


Available editions
__________________


The product is available in two different editions: A "pro" edition distributed under a shareware licensing model, and a "free" edition distributed as freeware.

The shareware edition has the following additional features compared to the freeware edition:

  -  Real-Time monitoring of system changes during install of programs.

  -  Forced Uninstall remove remnants of already uninstalled programs.

  -  Multi-level Backup system including full Registry backup.

  -  Print and Print Preview of installed programs.

  -  Export of installed programs in TXT, HTML and MS Excel.

  -  Customizable and flexible User Interface.

  -  Visual themes support.

  -  Full 64-bit compatibility Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.


System requirements
___________________


Hardware requirements call for an Intel Pentium 133 MHz processor or equivalent, 64 MB of RAM, and 5 MB of free hard disk space. Administrator privileges are required.

For systems where Revo Uninstaller cannot or should not be installed, a portable version is available that can be started directly (e.g. from a USB stick) without requiring an installation and without leaving files or registry entries on the computer.


Features
________


Uninstalling software


Revo Uninstaller begins with listing all the installed programs found on the user's computer. If Revo Uninstaller fails to list a particular program, the feature "Hunter Mode" can be used to manually select the program to uninstall.

When uninstalling software, Revo Uninstaller prompts the user for which particular "mode" to use, "built-in", "safe", "moderate", or "advanced". The built-in option simply runs the application's bundled uninstaller. The safe option only removes files which mostly likely can be removed without any impact on system stability and proper functioning. The moderate and advanced modes scan deeper in the registry and folders (directories).

In case the user wishes to roll back an uninstallation, Revo Uninstaller can create a System Restore point.

Next, Revo Uninstaller runs the program's built-in uninstaller, if possible. Sometimes the built-in uninstaller may be corrupted or missing. In cases when the built-in uninstaller prompts for a reboot after it has completed, it is recommended to cancel the reboot and continue with Revo Uninstaller.

After the built-in uninstaller has completed, Revo Uninstaller proceeds to scanning the hard disk for leftover files using algorithms. Users can exclude certain folders (directories), file extensions, and even hard disks from scanning to ensure a critical file is not removed by accident. Once additional scanning has completed, the user is presented with a list of registry entries and files. The user can decide which files to delete or to keep. Revo Uninstaller will prompt if a reboot may be necessary to remove all files completely, as some may still be marked as "in use" (and thus the operating system will not allow them to be deleted).

Revo Uninstaller finishes the uninstallation by offering the user to go back and choose a deeper scanning mode.


Other features
______________


Revo Uninstaller also includes several other computer maintenance features:

  -  Junk Files Cleaner: Deletes temporary application files.

  -  Auto Run Manager: Deletes or disables applications which run at startup.

  -  Browsers Cleaner: Removes Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Netscape
     browsing history and cache.

  -  Windows Cleaner: Clears temporary Windows files.

  -  Evidence Remover: Prevents restoration of deleted files by overwriting free
     space.

  -  Unrecoverable Delete: Overwrites and then deletes selected files and folders
     in order to prevent their restoration.

  -  Microsoft Office Cleaner: Clears the recently used file history in Microsoft
     Office 2000 through 2007.

  -  Windows Tools: Provides shortcuts to commonly used tools in Windows, such as
     System Restore.

  -  AutoUpdate: Checks for new program builds. It can download and install new
     versions and display a summary of changes incorporated into the latest
     version.
