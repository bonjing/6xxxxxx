,pirateman2,2011-03-03T15:19Z,"Hi Malestrom,
I want to thank you for all your consistent hard work.
Specifically for the following uploads;
Wood, Elektor, Servo, Discover, Science, New scientist, Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Scientific American, Nuts & Volts, just to name the major magazines I am interested. Not to mention your countless uploads in Electronics and science books in PDF format. It would not have been possible to pursue my thirst for knowledge without you.
If I had the money, I would subscribe to all these publications and books.
As it stands, I can barely pay for my Internet service! 
I don't have any extra means for *acquiring knowledge*. 
I just wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn more when I couldn't afford it any other way.
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you....
PS: I seed 3:1 to try to compensate for the *hit and runners*."
