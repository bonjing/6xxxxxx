Could this be a font package problem. Which font did they use?
Perhaps my Windows XP Hom eidition being in Dutch is the problem?"

,DonkeyHotey,2012-01-28T16:21Z,"I wish people wouldn't write detailed explanations on how to install it properly when they can't even explain things in simple English. You probably want to help but what is the point Bseos  of saying "" Copy Contents from crack folder"" when there is no pissing ""crack folder""? How the hell does that help anyone. Could no one crack an English f*cking edition of this to save us all having to negoci8 this sh*t in f*cking Japanese??? Worst piece of software i have ever tried to install, and still not managed it, and im not surprised considering the state of the instructions in here. What a waste of f*cking time."
,DonkeyHotey,2012-01-28T17:46Z,"BSEOS

I just saw your post explaining, and I apologize for jumping the gun . I still can't install it though."
,chriznow,2012-05-04T05:56Z,I had a problem with it encoding where it would get stuck on preparing output and time out but I installed QuickTime and now it works perfect. Before I had QuickTime installed I would get a message when it started up that it wouldn't be able to process QuickTime files. So I guess QuickTime is required.
,chriznow,2012-05-04T06:33Z,BTW Nice Crack!
