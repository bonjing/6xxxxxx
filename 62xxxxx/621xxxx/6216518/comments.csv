,cokes79,2011-03-04T20:04Z,"@froggie100: Would you mind sharing how you were able to add the extra boot option for 64-bit repair? None of the AIO tutorials out there address the need to do this, or how to. TIA!"

,mannay,2011-03-11T15:57Z,"@froggie100 i have downloaded this torrent and burnt it on a dvd i changed my boot options to boot from dvd rom first  but it doesnt  prompt me to ""press a key to boot from dvd "" option it just boots my old windows 7 which was facing activation probs ! i want to install a fresh copy help !"
,scandal0us,2011-03-11T18:12Z,"update- I did a fresh install, ran every update, and then activated. Flawless setup.
Hey mannay try the F10 key during boot. Or just google how to access boot menu on your specific computer on google. My guess is you changed the setting but did not save the bios setting. Just a guess. Good luck."
,sranja91,2011-03-15T01:17Z,@mannay check if you made it bootable dvd...

,zbiox,2011-04-06T09:25Z,"I've some problems installing SP1 on clean Win7x86 (it has no updates, I downloaded it from froggie100's torrent)

1) When I boot from ISO -> choose Windows setup -> Stay offline, or smth. like that -> Update , I get a message :
""the computer started using Windows installation disc.. remove the disc restart the computer so that run Windows normally ..
then insert installation disc and run to upgrade..""

2) When I run my Windows, open SP1 disc content with explorer choose setup -> update, I get a message : 
""to upgrade you must be running with SP1 installed. Close the installation run Windows and check for updates SP1 .. bla bla bla""

How do I setup SP1 correctly?"
,Rupam89,2011-04-06T15:09Z,I have a Windows 7 Ultimate RTM x64 installation. I'm low on disc space on my C drive. Can I upgrade my installation with this edition to Windows 7 SP1 Ultimate x64 with such low space (almost 500mb)? Also I wish to do an USB installation using Flashboot. Any suggestions? This question is for the uploader froggie100 and the other people who have downloaded this torrent and upgraded this OSs. Please help me.
,coalhada,2011-04-08T04:30Z,"It is working flawlessly, I´ve made a clean install of the ultimate 64 from this iso and registered with the provided crack. 
Haven´t tried to update, tough.

Thanks a lot."
,furtive,2011-04-19T06:11Z,"Tested this out today, worked great. Best part about it is it saves so much space in my cd-case. Does work with OEM which is all i cared about. Retail is a bonus"
,kane2007,2011-05-02T20:08Z,This is an awesome work n also thanks for taking the pain to upload it...cheers!
,Shadow Master,2011-05-06T08:29Z,"I'm also getting the ""to upgrade you must be running with SP1 installed. Close the installation run Windows and check for updates SP1 .. bla bla bla"". I already have SP1 installed. I don't have any other updates. The only updates I have hidden are language packs and malicious software removals. Makes no sense."
,furtive,2011-05-14T22:26Z,"@shadowmaster

you are supposed to boot from this CD. aka boot from CD. Don't run this while you already have windows installed.
