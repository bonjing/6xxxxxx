System Requirements:
If you want to run Windows 7 on your PC, here's what it takes:
1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor.
1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit).
16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit).
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver.
Additional requirements to use certain features:
Internet access (fees may apply).
Depending on resolution, video playback may require additional memory and advanced graphics hardware.
Some games and programs might require a graphics card compatible with DirectX 10 or higher for optimal performance.
For some Windows Media Center functionality a TV tuner and additional hardware may be required.
Windows Touch and Tablet PCs require specific hardware.
HomeGroup requires a network and PCs running Windows 7.
DVD/CD authoring requires a compatible optical drive.
BitLocker requires Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 1.2.
BitLocker To Go requires a USB flash drive.
Windows XP Mode requires an additional 1 GB of RAM and an additional 15 GB of available hard disk space.
Music and sound require audio output.
Product functionality and graphics may vary based on your system configuration. Some features may require advanced or additional hardware.

PCs with multi-core processors:
Windows 7 was designed to work with today's multi-core processors. All 32-bit versions of Windows 7 can support up to 32 processor cores, while 64â€‘bit versions can support up to 256 processor cores.

PCs with multiple processors (CPUs):
Commercial servers, workstations, and other high-end PCs may have more than one physical processor. Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate allow for two physical processors, providing the best performance on these computers. Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, and Home Premium will recognize only one physical processor.

The difference with most other All-In-One versions, is that this version 
also has a 64-bits Recovery Mode, for system recovery. Other All-In-One 
versions are often (read: almost all) based on the 32-bits version, which 
makes it unable to use the Recovery Mode if you're on a 64-bits OS.

Instruction:
For a clean install: boot from ISO and just let the bootmenu timer pass 
(10 sec.). Setup will be started and you can also launch the Recovery Mode for 
a 32-bits OS from there. If you use a 64-bits OS, in the bootmenu choose 
"x64 Recovery Mode" (don't use this for installation!).
Also with this version it's possible to upgrade from as well a 32-bits OS, 
as a 64-bits OS. Depending on the type of OS you use, the correct setup 
will automatically be started.
Tested upgrade from Vista SP2 32-bits and 64-bits -> OK.
NOTE: the "setup64.exe" is not signed, this is correct!

Apart from combining the editions and above described elements, there 
are no modifications. All material is from the original MS ISOs 
(so not activated!). Activation can be done using a OEM or Retail productkey 
(except Enterprise editions). After a clean install or an upgrade, all 
installed files on the disk where Windows is installed are 100% original 
and untouched.


Activation (located in Tools folder of .iso file)
- mini-KMS Activator (1.072 by WZor) for Enterprise editions
- Windows Loader (1.9.5 by Daz) for the other ones
