,.ACHILLES,2011-03-02T07:37Z,hi twenty forty.....u have many tv series episodes....it would be better if u upload them in collection or full season collection way like user ridler do......reply plzz
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-02T07:59Z,"@.ACHILLES: I have skipped your question yesterday because I was sure that such questions often come from stupid persons.
Today, I add ""annoying"" to such assumption."
,.ACHILLES,2011-03-02T09:27Z,"kkk alright......u don't understand but if u see your tv pack torrents,they dont have seeds........but anyways thanks for ur 720p blueray rip movies... gr8 quality!!!"
,DMVIN,2011-03-02T10:58Z,"achilles, riddler uploads a season at the end of all episodes being aired while 20-40 uploads them as they are being aired"
,hkoraddi,2011-03-02T11:13Z,"@dark_defender-
hi my net speed is 256kbps so almost takes me 11hrs to get it if ppl seed it average.and i always wont leave without atleast 2x up so 2 days for dat so just asked him as he had told wen ppv rip had arrived den he had told he shall 272 wen dvd comes.so asked him.

no options but down this as i love the rips of 20-40.they are the best out there."
,rojenatgmail,2011-03-02T12:21Z,Thank you!
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-02T13:20Z,"I would be happy to initially seed a collection or two--assuming I had twentyforty's permission to do so, but unhappily I haven't yet figured out how to post torrents and get them accepted by tpb tracker (or any other for that matter) and my upload speed ain't all that good, so it would probably be a week or more of continuous initial seeding even if I Did manage to figure it out. :("
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-02T13:21Z,"@@hkoraddi: As you learned, my friend, through all years you have followed me, I remember all ""open things"", and your asking about Tangled PPV. I did. But, as you surely know, my encoding has changed, dramatically. Nowadays, my 720p are 7 MB/minute and ""old"" and partially abandoned 272p were 4.44 MB/minute in cases like these, when source has full wide-screen aspect ratio of 16/9 and not theatrical 2.25-2.35/1 (narrow-wide or Cinemascope). Point being, 272p would be roughly 450MB (it's 100 min. movie) and weighting the size gain, savings by that - but getting much worse quality - I opted for 700MB-720p as a try to achieve ""one size fits all"", but it  obviously wasn't the case. I stopped with encoding of so called ""double-releases"" (272p and 720p of the same movie) for one simple reason -  I can't make it.

In my first answer I tried to keep things simple (therefore such ""shortness"") and I am sorry for that."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-02T13:41Z,"@azrielle: As I said like gazillion times, my ""regulars"" do not need any permission from me. In fact, I encouraged people to make season collections and make torrents, therefore I made and posted ""How.to.Make.a.torrent.avi"" and ""How.to.Upload.torrent.avi"" 3.5 MB videos in every MU.txt file which was incorporated in many of my torrents, but nobody (or few) actually looked into. I have 54 kB/s upload speed and that is considered as lowest limit for uploads. I would send you  these MU links in e-mail and you'll see how simple it is."
,dark_defender,2011-03-02T14:13Z,@twentyforty: Please send those links to me as well in the email friend. I would like to do it too. Thanks !!
,micmac33,2011-03-02T19:26Z,"Thanks a lot, excellent quality."
,jon4fun,2011-03-02T20:46Z,"Hi 20-40,

"
,kian89,2011-03-15T22:00Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6222350/Tangled_%28PSP__iPod__Zune%29

I m pretttttty sure that NOONE would prefer his self advertising files whith his name on it 20-40 which doesnt even makes any sense lol, when there are other nice rips out there.
and + you may also notice noone even seed his torrents except he himself"
,USAPatriot1,2011-04-28T15:16Z,Seeds? 
[V],twentyforty,2011-12-14T18:26Z,"@kian: As wee seen before, you are lunatic. You have left same shit many times. Your OCD manifested by hitting the ""minus"" button is proof more. Everything you say is a lie. ""Do NOT sell my encodes"" - is what that means."
