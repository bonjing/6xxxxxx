Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Wheadon teams with 
acclaimed artists John Cassaday and Neal Adams to deliver a classic tale 
of man versus mutant. Just as growing tensions between humans and 
mutants reach an all-time high, Dr. Kavita Rao discovers a "cure" for mutants. 
However, Wolverine, Beast, Kitty Pryde, Cyclops, and Emma Frost 
aren't convinced that mutants need curing. 
As the pressure is turned up on mutants to take the antidote, 
a powerful new adversary named Ord threatens to 
silence Dr. Charles Xavier's prodigies once and for all. 
Now, if the X-Men lose their powers, mankind will be helpless 
to defend against the malevolent extraterrestrial invader.
