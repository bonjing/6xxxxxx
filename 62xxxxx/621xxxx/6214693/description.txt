Bassist and producer Bill Laswell's fascination with Arabic culture has led him into strange and wonderful projects like this, an all-star program on which performers as diverse as Iggy Pop, Hakim Bey, William Burroughs, Patti Smith and Genesis P. Orridge read selections from ancient and modern texts written by or about the Hashisheen (or Assassins). Like the readings, the music that accompanies them is disturbing and perfect: Laswell is a long-established master of the dark, deep groove, and when Jah Wobble or Anton Fier takes the reins the results are no less powerful.
