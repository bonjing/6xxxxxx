"Sex Mob Does Bond" is the soundtrack to an imaginary James Bond flick. Sex Mob rip through the Barry songbook, infusing each piece with a sexy, almost trashy vibe that was always subdued in the Bond films. These tunes play great whether you're a fan of James Bond and John Barry or not. As sexy as anything Bond should be, and more fun than you thought jazz could be.
