Garden gnomes Gnomeo (voice of McAvoy) and Juliet (voice of Blunt) have as 
many obstacles to overcome as their quasi namesakes when they are caught up 
in a feud between neighbors. But with plastic pink flamingos and lawnmower 
races in the mix, can this young couple find lasting happiness? 
Written by Walt Disney Pictures
