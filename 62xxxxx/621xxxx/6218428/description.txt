Bulletstorm takes place in the 26th century, where the Confederation of Planets are protected by a secret black-ops army called Dead Echo. The story follows space pirate Grayson Hunt, voiced by Steve Blum, and his cyborg partner Ishi Sato, whose squad went AWOL after they were betrayed by their commanding officer, General Sarrano. Ten years later, after a spontaneous and liquor-induced attempt to take revenge on the General and his forces, Hunt's and Sato's ship crash-landed on the planet Stygia, a former resort planet now overrun with meat-eating plants, feral mutant tribes, criminals, and Godzilla-sized monsters. Hunt and Sato search for a way off the planet, all while doing battle with the General's forces, who also crashed on Stygia after Hunt's attack. Along the way, they're joined by Trishka, a foul-mouthed woman with a dark past who also knows her way around a gun.
