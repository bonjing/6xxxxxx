But its in 4 winzip files. of the 4 the first 3 contain some file names that are the same such at Databin-c. andso i put all of those in seperat sub folders in my main extraction folder. then clicked install from there. but when i tried to play it; it said and X3Audio_86 was missing. but i see its also in a winzip. should the game read those from in the winzip., if not what folder should i extract it to? thanx"
