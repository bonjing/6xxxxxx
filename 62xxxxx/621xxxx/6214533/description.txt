***Robbie Williams - Discography (1997-2009) - 320kbps***


Borrowing from such flamboyant pop stars as Freddie Mercury, Elton John, and George Michael, British singer Robbie Williams started out in the boy band Take That, but soon split and launched a solo career. By the late 1990s he had become a dance/pop sensation, with a more mature sound that was still rooted in dance with a rock edge.
