,TheSecretUchiha,2011-03-04T14:38Z,"@meiskam If you use the update the game wont work,also from what country do you need to be so that you can use the updates that are in the torrent"
,meiskam,2011-03-04T19:06Z,"@TheSecretUchiha, these are the same files that are included in the torrent, that the cracks were made to work with.  Download the updates from ea.com to get them faster, then apply the crack after you update.  If you're asking about the region of the installs in this pack, I don't know .. it hasn't been fully seeded yet."
,Despl,2011-03-08T21:45Z,When i try to install the update that comes with the game it says it isn´t able to check the version an the update can´t continue.
,nAngel,2011-03-08T21:49Z,"@Despl, be sure you follow instructions carefully :)
Cause all works perfectly. I promise ;)"
,Despl,2011-03-08T22:28Z,"@nAngel But i do! i open the installer, select the country (do i have to select one in special?), agree on the terms, i even installed the EA download manager to see if was needed, and then i go to the folder where the update is, double click to start and just when is about to finish gives me the message that the version can´t be checked. Do i have to put the update in some other folder?"
,Despl,2011-03-08T22:29Z,"BTW, thanks beforehand for the game. (If i can make it work)"
,TheSecretUchiha,2011-03-09T15:37Z,"@Despl i dont know if you will read this but!The update you used wont work cause your not from the country that the update is for,so for it to work you must select the country the update is for but i dont know it.Sorry(Well if someone has alot of free time he/she can install and remove the game selecting another country each time until the update works,oh and btw dont bother downloading the updates from the site cause the crack doesnt work with the newest update if you want the newest update you need a newer crack!I hope everyone got it xD)"
,nAngel,2011-03-09T15:48Z,"@Despl, sorry, but EA Download Manager is not necessary.

And i have no idea where the problem is. Maybe some protections on your computer doesn't give access to check your game? If you are under Windows 7, you should run update via ""Run as Administrator"".

Anyway i can give you link where you can choose more versions of same update - http://www.patches-scrolls.de/sims3.php
At first i should propose you to reinstall game, then use update again, at first ""Worldwide"" (that's the same in my pack), then try ""US"" version. Then other one, if you need. (the same crack in my pack will works)"
,nAngel,2011-03-09T15:51Z,"@TheSecretUchiha
There are only ""Worldwide"" and ""US"" versions of updates, and only newests there is possible to get for now. Same with cracks."
,TheSecretUchiha,2011-03-09T16:26Z,@nAngel there are 7 different regions so 7 different updates only 1 will work depending what region you chose
,Despl,2011-03-10T04:26Z,"Thanks! I found other patches for The Sims 3, just the basic, and now it works. Now i´m just having some problems updating the expansions. Thanks for the help and the tip, and yes i have windows /."
,Despl,2011-03-10T04:27Z,* Windows 7
,TheSecretUchiha,2011-03-10T09:01Z,@Despl If you can make it work i beg you to tell cause i wanna play Sims 3 for ages(I had the basic and all the expansions just not the new one)Btw guys did you saw the upcoming Sims Medieval?

,asseffj1,2011-03-20T04:09Z,"@nAngel 

I've Downloaded everything, but when I try to start the game it says i need to insert the CD, whats up with that? Any insight from anyone would be great.
