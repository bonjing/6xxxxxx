,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-07-21T00:57Z,"Well, this finally, after 3 days of trial and error, this seems to be what I was looking for - lightening fast password protection of portable usb drives without the problem of the registration being broken when online - 'trial version expired.'  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU."
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-07-21T02:52Z,"Note: On my USB drive after I had StorageCrypt password protect it I had to ""Run as administrator"" AND IT WORKS AWESOME!!!  500GB PROTECTED IN LESS THAN 15 SECONDS!!!!"
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-07-21T03:18Z,"All I wanted was a simple, FAST, RELIABLE, secure crack - Password Protection of several 500GB drives!

I wish I'd tried SecureCrypt first!! Instead I spent 3 days on USB Secure, Universal Shield, Folder Lock, TrueCrypt, Folder Protect, Password Protect, Easy File Protector....!!!! Argh!

Bugs, slllllooooowwwww (20 hours), ""license expired,"" complicated.

STORAGECRYPT IS THE ANSWER!  PAY THEM.  BUY THIS GREAT SOFTWARE.

REMEMBER - ""RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR"" the little program that is placed on your USB drive when you password protect it. "
