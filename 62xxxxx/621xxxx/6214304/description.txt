Friend and colleague, Artie was killed during the raid, and a servant of the law decides to take under the guardianship of three children killed each other. But his family budget was not suited for such expenses. Then Artie decides to take money from those who do not deserve: the first on my radar was a major drug dealer. And if you can escape justice in the courtroom, the justice of the police will not leave anybody.
