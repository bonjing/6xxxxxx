If there\'s any albums I\'ve missed, please inform me of which one, I\'ll include it.  This torrent is not meant to take away from Bruce Springsteen\'s album sales in any form. It is meant to share his awesomeness with the world, and expand his fanbase to a newer generation. If you like Bruce, the E-Street Band and their music, then buy the albums as I did.

Note: does not contain soundtrack performances. also, this is a 2nd uploading of this. it appears the first got a bad hash somewhere, and may need to be nuked.

Will originally seed 3:1. If it dies, it dies. Not my problem if people don\'t share. Don\'t Hit & Run. RE-SEED!
