On their third outing, Lau confirm they're anything but a flash in the pan, and in fact one of the most exciting acts in folk music at the moment. That they carry a special instrumental sparkle is apparent from the instrumental opener, "The Burrian," which hangs moodily like a mix of traditional Scottish folk and Mazzy Star's languor. Vocally they're fine, too, and songs like "Winter Moon" and "The Master" show the quality of the arrangements, spare yet superbly effective. Virtually all the material here comes from their own pens, the exception being a cover of "Dear Prudence" that captures the dreaminess of the original but gives it an intimacy and immediacy that distinguishes this version. This is a band that performs with both passion and grace as the accordion, guitar, and fiddle weave in and around each other with something close to telepathy. Stirring and utterly wonderful.
