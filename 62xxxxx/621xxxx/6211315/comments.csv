I watched it. It is like most PPV Rips.
Grainy, cropped (doesnt fill whole screen)
Something is covered up on low right corner of screen.( LI? )
Will Wait for DVDrip to burn"

,NSGNT,2011-03-04T19:57Z,"I check a sample and i say pass.

V- poor : 6 at best
A- good ( stereo at best)
M- up to individual taste."
,dlarrym1111,2011-03-05T08:42Z,"Its not ""FAKE"", but it has been severely cropped. Also, what ever the software was that was used to crop this copy, it screwed to quality all to pieces. I have seen MANY PPV (pay per view releases) that are great. For example, the copy I have of: ""The Disappearance on 7th Ave"" is superb quality. All a PPV is, is a copy or release of a movie copied from an individuals TIVO or DVR. In other words, an exact digital copy, except being copied to a blank DVD or BRDVD, it was copied directly to a TIVO or other DVR (Digital Video Recorder) and there is not a reason in the world it shouldn't be on par with a DVDrip. Thanks for the effort @IwannaFan2, it was just mucked too much  I'm not saying you personally did anything to this copy but someone did.

Thanks anyway, but using VLC, and trying the latest vs of QuickTime, still no different. Nothing helped, it still was grainy and blurry and much of the view was obscured by cropping. CROPPING, the nightmare of all downloaders."
,KnottyBoi,2011-03-06T21:19Z,"thanks BONE. that type of info keeps me from burning 20copies and finding out 2 days later there is a better copy LOL

V: 0 UNWATCHABLE*

*Grainy video, obvious edits including black box in lower right corner to cover whatever watermark was there and a giant black bar across the top of the screen to cover whatever subtitles may have been there, leaving a sliver of video above the cover itself. My 5 year old edits film better than this. Don't waste your bandwidth"
