,jonbond92,2011-05-26T11:11Z,"@won1024
Wait, since when are there cops in this one? I must have not played that far, because I haven't seen one cop in this game. You can go as fast as you want in explore mode..."
,Toumbid,2011-06-16T17:28Z,Since when NFSu2 is 250 MB? Would't that much of compression damage some data of the game?
,Slammer94,2011-07-05T06:44Z,Hmmm idk if this is ripped or just uber compressed from 1.3GB to 230MB? I'll download this and a normal one and compare them. And try to remember to post my results back here haha
,ncc46537,2011-07-07T14:51Z,"UHARC used to pack.
Extremely experimental high compression archival program.
It worked.
Works well, though I must admit that the graphics of the actual game don't meet up with my standards...
Then again, i can play pretty much any game on full settings, albeit I must remove anti-aliasing and shadows from that list of full settings.
Have fun with this game."
,.M3th,2011-07-11T07:17Z,The game does work but its a rip(no music tracks or cutscenes) should have known with the small size.Just saying for anyone who wants to know.

,EricTickles,2011-09-26T03:10Z,"Definitely a safe torrent. Was expecting virus along with the 232 mb file, but it's safe. I assure everybody."

,Dylan227,2011-10-06T19:24Z,"Never mind I think I know how
For people who don't know how to install here are the steps:
1) Choose a location ( I chose C:Downloads)
2) When you finish downloading the game there    should be a winrar type file there @ C:Downloads
3) Double click the file
4) You'll find uharc.exe, setup.bat, Data1.uha, Data2.uha and Data3.uha
5) If you click uharc.exe it will load a screen for about 1 sec. then it will disappear so go to setup.bat it will tell that files uharc.exe, Data.uha 1,2,3 will be missing from C:Downloads
6) To fix this just highlight and drag them to where you save the NFSU2 winrar type file(for me C:Downloads).
6) Run setup.bat again it will decompress the file.
7) You will have to create a new folder and send all of the applications, folders etc. into the folder
8) Although you can't move speed2 it will say create link.
9)Play the game, It's a long process, but I'm sure all of you can figure it out =)"
,Dylan227,2011-10-06T19:29Z,"For people who don't know how to play the game
Run uharc.exe; you'll see a black screen for about 1 sec then it dissapears thats good it means that it decompressed. Then run setup.bat(it will show you what to do) and if you have any questions from there you can ask me. "
,bazilsajjad,2011-10-18T16:35Z,"Works great
