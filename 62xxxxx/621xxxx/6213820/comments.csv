,pirateman2,2011-03-03T15:50Z,"Hi Malestrom_HH,
I have these heathkit electronic books in PDF format which I scanned;
DC Electronics
AC Electronics
Semiconductors
Electronic circuits
I paid over $1000 USD for these courses when I had the money 20 years ago. I know it sounds like a long time ago and they should be obsolete by now, but I have yet to find a better course in these subjects.
If you are interested in having them, please let me know how I can get them to you and still stay anonymous.
I'll check this torrent's comment for your reply (if u'r interested)."
