,OmegaWeaponX,2011-08-21T09:15Z,"Ok, so I've been trying to get Borderlands GOTY to load up in PS3, and I've been having a lot of problems. I'm on 3.55 cfw, I'm using multiman and I have several other games in there, hell, I recently downloaded Duke Nukem Forever, passed it over with a USB device (PSP), and it worked like a charm after I installed a pkg file. I tried passing Borderlands GOTY over via FTP, using Blackbox and FlashFXP, I'm able to connect to the PS3 and everything, I transferred the game BLUS30386-[Borderlands] into the GAMES folder, where all the other games are, and it does not show up in the backup manager. I then moved the folder into the empty GAMEZ folder, and it still does not appear. I installed a pkg file for the game, and the icon now appears in the XMB under GAME, but when I tried to load it up, all I get is a black screen, I doubt that's where it has to be anyway. So, what am I doing wrong? Can someone please help me? "

,tapptastic,2012-05-17T20:21Z,@ OmegaWeaponX I had to wait about 3 mins for my screen to load. Just wait
