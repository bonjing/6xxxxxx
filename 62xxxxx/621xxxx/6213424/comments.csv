,MarkupX,2011-03-02T13:47Z,"It sure does, but there appears to be a problem with the way I uploaded it. The magnetic link should work"

,annabelle31,2011-03-02T15:44Z,"The magnet link also doesn't contain any files. Or I'm doing something horribly wrong at my end. I'll leave it running for some time, perhaps it'll work later.

Thanks for sharing, the book looks interesting."
,annabelle31,2011-03-02T15:45Z,"Well, I stand corrected, the magnet link DOES work after all.

Thanks!"
,MarkupX,2011-03-02T16:39Z,It should be also noted that this doesn't include the CD that contains all the source code. However not to worry because the official website has all the source code and updates. When I can edit i'll include this in the info.
