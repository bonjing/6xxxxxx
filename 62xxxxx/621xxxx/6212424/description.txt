                A charity night at the Jockey ends in disaster when
                Shane steals Tilly's wheelchair. Shane's actions
                cause public outcry and throw the Maguire family
                business into chaos. Libby's new friendship with
                Martin helps her to rediscover her passion for
                literature. It also opens her eyes to her diminishing
                relationship with Frank, much to Patty's fear, who
                instructs Frank to woo Libby back. But Frank's
                benefits have stopped and his total disregard for
                others causes widespread problems until his actions
                finally have an impact on him.
