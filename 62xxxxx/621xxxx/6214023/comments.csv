,xkillerz,2011-04-20T06:35Z,Will this work on Win 7 64-bit if i install into the 32-bit file?
,JREY82,2011-04-25T11:05Z,"I've mounted image, half way through installation it asks me to insert disc 1 ??? Any help appreciated here ppl"
,pfcf,2011-04-25T22:10Z,Just click with right button on the .iso file and extract the files with Winrar. Then run the Setup file into the folder. ThatÂ´s it
,AxelVanKampen,2011-05-07T13:38Z,"The instructions say:
Directions:
1.  Run AutoCAD.exe

There is no AutoCAD.exe file included.
What to do?"
,dave4436,2011-05-11T22:23Z,Im having the same problem?? I cant see autocad.exe file anywhere?? please help??
,borgeklungerbo,2011-05-12T05:12Z,"The file is called Setup.exe.

The problem I am experiencing is that none of the serial numbers included works. It will not event give me the request code under activation, because the serial key is invalid."
,thebuilder2011,2011-05-13T11:25Z,VERY FUCK THIS DONT DOWLOAD ITS A FAKE IM WASTING MY 3DAYS IN THIS!!! I INSTALL IT CANNOT RUN BECAUSE MISSING IN X86 SETUPRES
,littld62,2011-05-20T09:36Z,"Thank you for putting this together.

Works great!

For those who are having a hard time getting it  activated, try turning off your network card/wireless card you will get the correct activate option.

For those who say virus, 

xf0a2011-32bits.exe will trip malwarebytes and other antivirus, spyware tools 

Over 90% of all keygen/cracks will give you a false positive telling you that there isn't anything actually wrong with the file but it's associated with a 'bad thing'. ie pirating. 

Seeing how you are downloading this instead of paying for it, deal with it, remove the file and stfu..

Golf claps!"
,veedom,2011-05-21T14:16Z,"I have the same problem as JREY82. Asking for disk 1 midway through download. Also, I see no sign of .iso files anywhere. Need help here guys."
,a-spot,2011-05-24T21:03Z,After half of installation it asked to put disk 1 to disk station? Why?
,jockford,2011-07-12T09:24Z,if you dont like this then BUY your own then UPLOAD it here
,Ghita79,2011-07-12T23:07Z,"Thanks, works perfectly.
And the installation was easy. Just follow the instructions. "
,Gamer-GSXR_1000,2011-07-21T01:03Z,anyone know where i can get autoturn software?? This is a software that simulates vehicle turning path... Please help..
,Gamer-GSXR_1000,2011-07-21T01:14Z,"
Anyone know where i can get autoturn?"
,tykoh,2011-11-17T16:25Z,"Anyone else having problems. It took me a while to get it to work but yeah, in the end, shit got done. 

To simply put it. What most ppl said is on the right track. Simply mounting it did not work for me. It asked for me to insert CD1. Extracting seems to be the way to go. 

1. Make sure you have winrar: Right click on the iso file and extract to a desired folder
2. Run setup.exe
3. Don't know bt everyone else, but errors came up on mine about missing files. Just keep ignoring them and eventually the install will get on and finish. 
4. Follow instructions from the crack folder: Use their serial and follow the instructions to authenticate.
5. Use the fax option to get ur authentication number thing. 

Hope it helped someone. "
,FromHeartToSun,2012-02-13T21:47Z,I`d made it!!I`m sooo happy! thank you very much!=)..from Russia with love
,pasa-frik,2012-03-06T21:45Z,"Thank you very much, it works perfectly you just have to follow the instructions to the letter. "
,lilome,2012-04-13T07:40Z,"First let me say "" I Made It thru installation & configuration"". But.........
 A ton of html files in the x86 folder were gone.
These were only text files for error messages.
But my 1 & only problem here is the activation.
The patch worked. Said ""successful"". 
I got a 32 digit Request Code  that I put in the patch/generator. After hitting generate It gave me only 54 numbers. 
Activation code is 64 digit code.  16 boxes x 4 in each , 
It says to paste the code in the first box and any remaining will automatically be filled. But it wont let me paste. I can copy then paste in a notepad or anything else but just cant do it in the activation window. the rest wont fill & i have no numbers left.
THIS SUX  
Anybody have any suggestions. 
This doesn't make sense"
,hdranger,2012-05-18T15:11Z,I was able to download and install it. But when i go to activate it i tried all the codes in the .txt file and it said they were not good activation codes. When i try to active it with the network card turned off as suggested in one of the comments it tells me it cannot activate. Any suggestions ? 
,nongratas,2012-05-19T13:13Z,"Funcionou direitinho.
Great. It works fine. About the activation request code: Just leave the last boxes blank and insert only the numbers that are generated.
Thanks dopusy"
