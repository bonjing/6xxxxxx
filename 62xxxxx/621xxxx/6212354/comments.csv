Your also missing tracks."
,ScoreGods,2011-07-17T18:20Z,"THIS IS A QUALITY UPLOAD

Thankx @ Uploader


for the rest of the MP3 junkies out there 


@ Uploader

Uploading albums of master composers like Hans Zimmer  only makes sense if UNTOUCHED

Uploads are welcome in full albums

1. Wave
2. Flac

If anyone needs to encode into MP3 learn the way how it is done just right. Follow the instructions while encoding, make sure you do NOT run other applications while encoding (like working in Photoshop or another audio application while its running) Doing so ends in bad quality- like so many uploads here.

MASTER COMPOSER = Top notch quality in composing, recording and ""mastering"" 
The chance you make mistakes with YOUR audio file is rather high unless you are an audio engineer or other pro with a lot of sound studio experience.  

Do NOT touch the audio files else the upload gets a negative quality rating. 


Enough said"

But where do you get FLAC scores from? I can't find them anywhere.
Thanks again."
,spOOnPT,2011-12-13T10:13Z,"I've compared this with mp3 320kbs and mp3 is more vivid sound, this one is more technical, its like all instruments are separated from all. maybe its better that way for mixing and editing professional audio"
,akiba-kei,2012-02-03T07:34Z,"thank you but the tracks 01 and 10 are missing, the sound is amazing!"
