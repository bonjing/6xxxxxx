METAL SLUG GAME


Metal Slug is a series of arcade-style shooters that is basically Contra, if Contra were sprayed with a fire hose full of anime box sets. You choose from six playable characters with no discernible difference and fight tooth and nail through legions of baddies, racking up a body count to rival John Rambo's.

The controls are fairly simple: move with the D-pad, shoot with one button, and jump with another. You can use the touch-screen to view your map, although if you canâ€˜t figure out where to go, odds are youâ€˜re having this review read to you while you struggle with your juice box.

I find that, in writing this, any review of Metal Slug 7 will be a retrospective of the series as a whole because if youÃ¢Â€â„¢ve played one Metal Slug, youÃ¢Â€â„¢ve played them all. But if you felt the first game needed to be about an hour longer and you really needed more character choice than â€œPlayer1â€ or â€œPlayer2â€, then perhaps Metal Slug 7 is the game youÃ¢Â€â„¢ve been waiting for in between Ritalin doses.

The only significant additions are the new vehicles called "slugs" - a tank, a plane, a robot on a radio flier wagon, the trouble bubble from GI Joe, a bipedal shopping cart with guns, and a giant robot - but even they (except for that last one) are kind of boring. Metal Slug is also one of those â€œrealisticâ€ shooters where you canÃ¢Â€â„¢t take a bullet to the chest without flinching and where you can get run down by a tank and come out smelling like roses.

While in one of these â€œslugsâ€, left and right control movement, and up and down control your aim. But as simple as this sounds, this can be frustrating to the point of throwing your DS out the nearest window. You will also be attacked from both sides, which wonÃ¢Â€â„¢t aid in the grounding of any airborne DSs. This kind of design would be okay if it was for an arcade game, but itÃ¢Â€â„¢s not, so thereÃ¢Â€â„¢s no need to bilk players for quarters. Fortunately, you have the option to forego the vehicles in most cases, and in the parts where you are required to use one, itÃ¢Â€â„¢s not so bad. In fact, one of them has you piloting the aforementioned giant robot and going toe to toe with a similarly sized fellow.
