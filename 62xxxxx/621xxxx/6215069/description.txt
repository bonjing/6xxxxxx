Description: 
David Attenborough returns to Madagascar to see how the island has changed
in the 50 years since his first visit, and to search for more clues about
one of his most treasured possessions, the egg of an elephant bird, an
ostrich-like creature that weighed half a ton. Scientists perform tests
to determine the age of the egg, as the naturalist discovers whether the
story of the bird's extinction can shed light on what is happening on the
island today.David Attenborough returns to the island of Madagascar on
a very personal quest. In 1960 he visited the island to film one of his first
ever wildlife series, Zoo Quest. Whilst he was there, he acquired a giant 
egg. It was the egg of an extinct bird known as the 'elephant bird' - the 
largest bird that ever lived. It has been one of his most treasured 
possessions ever since. Fifty years older, he now returns to the island 
to find out more about this amazing creature and to see how the island has 
changed. Could the elephant bird's fate provide lessons that may help protect 
Madagascar's remaining wildlife?Using Zoo Quest archive and specially shot
location footage, this film follows David as he revisits scenes from his youth 
and meets people at the front line of wildlife protection. On his return, 
scientists at Oxford University are able to reveal for the first time how 
old David's egg actually is - and what that might tell us about the legendary 
elephant bird.
