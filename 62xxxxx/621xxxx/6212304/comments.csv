,scottsasse,2011-03-02T02:24Z,THANKS in advance BONE!! Downloaded a few of your torrents before and they're always right on target. I downloaded this movie yesterday from some ass-muncher who advertised it as a PPV rip. How stupid must one be to F-UP a PPV rip and instead of ripping it from the cable/SAT box aiming a F-N camcorder at their cheep old glossy television screen???? I do believe that torrent has since been deleted and the user hopefully too!

All the other rips will be much better quality, avoid the EVO rip."
[V],.BONE.,2011-03-02T04:48Z,ye my advice is get 1.4gb but this is still good anoth
,scottsasse,2011-03-02T10:25Z,Just finished watching. As far as I'm concerned for 800MB the picture & sound was as good as one would expect. A=8 v=10 m=8 THANKS again!!
,QborT,2011-03-02T16:19Z,"See kids, even .BONE. agrees that is one of the worst rips available.  Like .BONE. said, go with a rip that is over 1gb.  The movie is long and deserves a higher bitrate."
