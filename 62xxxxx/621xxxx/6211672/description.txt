Oath Keepers Are A Fraud.






 The group calling itself "Oath Keepers" are
nothing more than "Gate Keepers" who are hiding the truth about America's
problems from those who need to hear it most; our Military and Law
Enforcement. Fortunately, their leader Stewart Rhodes, has and will
continue to expose himself and his false front as a fraud.
