Young pilots AJ and Andrew get the chance of a lifetime to fly the magnificent DC-3 specially equipped with skis to land on frozen strips.
It's up to Chief Pilot Arnie to guide them in the lost art of taking off and landing on skis as they fly to a remote lake and land on the thinning ice. Meanwhile, tension mounts as Buffalo's contract for the Mackenzie Valley food mail service is up for renewal, and Rod balances tricky personnel issues with preparing for the arrival of his first child.
