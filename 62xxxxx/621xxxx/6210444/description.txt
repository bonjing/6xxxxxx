Milt Jackson - Big Mouth [1981] 
1995 - Fantasy, OJC 865 / 025218686525

Review by Scott Yanow
It is to vibraphonist Milt Jackson's credit that he is able to "overcome" his backing on this CD and play some typically swinging music. Jackson is joined by electric keyboards and electric bass on most selections in addition to a couple of Latin percussionists and as many as four singers. Yet even with the many studio musicians, Jackson's basic bebop approach is unchanged and the repertoire includes several standards (such as "Bags' Groove," "The Days of Wine and Roses" and "I'm Getting Sentimental over You") that he has performed a countless number of times.
