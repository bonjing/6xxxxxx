,sj1,2011-03-12T12:01Z,"1: Sonic Adventure
2: Sega Bass Fishing
3: Space Cannel 5 part 2
4: Crazy Taxi

They should have put a lot more on if they do another I hope they do a compilation with games like Soul Reaver, Legacy of Kane, Re-Volt and a hell of a lot more... If I had the software to do them myself I would."
