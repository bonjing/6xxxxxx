Romanian Subs...?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-06T00:44Z,"All of my subs are soft subs.  Do not select the subtitle and they will not play :)  Source had them so i just include generally whatever source provides since its simple to do so.

I suppose you could use the supplied subs and translate them to english with google language tools if you wanted.

Regardless the subs are soft and impact no one and only a few kilobytes in size."
