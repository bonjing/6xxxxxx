The contestants are excited to hear from host Alison Sweeney 

that they will all be going home for two weeks. Each player 

returns home to emotional reunions with friends and family, 

after which they navigate the challenges of being back in their 

real lives, facing the same temptations that brought them to the 

ranch and realizing all of the things they are capable of doing 

now that they couldn't do before. When they come back to the 

ranch, they'll compete in a 5K challenge on a treadmill just as 

they did in the first episode of the season, but this time, 

they're going to run the 5K all by themselves. And just as 

before, each will pick who they want to train them - Bob Harper 

and Jillian Michaels or Cara Castronuova and Brett Hoebel-in the 

order in which they finish the challenge. Then a few contestants 

reach milestones at the weigh-in, after which another player is 

sent packing.
