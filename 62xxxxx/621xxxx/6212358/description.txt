Band of Horses, originally briefly known as Horses, is an American rock band formed in 2004 in Seattle by Ben Bridwell. They have released three studio albums, the most recent and most successful of which is 2010's Grammy nominated Infinite Arms. The band's line up, which included Mat Brooke for their debut album, has undergone several changes, although the current members, Bridwell, Ryan Monroe, Tyler Ramsey, Bill Reynolds, and Creighton Barrett have all been with the band for several years. Vocalist Bridwell has been likened to Jim James of My Morning Jacket, early Neil Young, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips.
