NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........

Here we are with a nice TS of Just Go With It for you all to enjoy. First of all thanks to our

mate TaRiQ786 for the source files...  With this one we needed to do some cropping

and rotating, we also made a script up to adjust the whate balance, gamma,

brightness, colors and ran a denoise and a sharpening filter. Turned out nice.Now 

the audio we just sync our very nice Line to our encode...

Anyway enjoy folks ....
