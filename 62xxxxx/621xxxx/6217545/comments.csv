,GimmeSkelter000,2011-03-04T18:01Z,No problem. I spent a good week trying to find a working Cowboy Bebop torrent in AVI format with no luck. so i figured i'd just convert it myself and upload that shit. :) enjoy!
,Ryukira1,2011-05-15T02:19Z,"Man, you're epic.  This is such a great series, and I can't wait to watch it again.  Thanks."

,ibeomnivore,2011-10-31T09:16Z,"I wanted to thank you for putting this in an avi format. The mkv ones are killing me, can't convert/burn them to DVD format. I'm not dl the movie, I already have that. I will seed this if it turns out ok. I will let you know how my dl comes out. This is the ONLY anime I have ever watched and I thought it was well told and pretty well done. Kinda reminds me of Firefly. Thanks again for the upload. I wish more peeps uploaded in an avi format, thanks."
,ibeomnivore,2011-11-03T15:49Z,"Just finished watching the first two sessions and everything seems to be good. Video is fine and audio is spot on (V-10, A-10 When I only put two sessions on a regular DVD disc using high quality to burn). Will be seeding for a bit more. I do like the previews at the end of the sessions, but not this version of the end credits as much as the the version I saw on the television. The swearing doesn't really add to the show, maybe even detracts a little. Didn't dl the movie on this torrent, seems to have problems and is short (Besides, I already have the movie). This is a VERY GOOD torrent!! Worth dling (skip the movie part). Thanks GS again for the avi version and your efforts on this one. MUCH appreciated! ""Enjoy Space Cowboys"""

,JonathonDoh,2012-05-26T07:37Z,Glad to see that this series is still floating out here in the ether. Thanks to all who made this available. I'll be seeding indefinitely! :)
