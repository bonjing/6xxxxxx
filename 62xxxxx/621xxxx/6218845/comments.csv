,eclassics,2011-03-04T19:34Z,"Movie was released ON Eid-ul-Fitr in 1976. Multi Star Cast. Full Action. Super Duper Hit. A Best Pakistani Cinema Classic. Has Resemblance with the Godfahter (1972) (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino). So, Sudhir is the Pakistani Godfather. Excellent Movie. You'd love to watch and also leave comments here. Please seed it as well. Because Sharing is Caring. "
