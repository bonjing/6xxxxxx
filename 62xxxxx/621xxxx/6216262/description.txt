Bob Servant is retired and a little bit bored.

When he starts getting spam emails, he decides to play the fraudsters at their own game and soon has them in the palm of his hand.

Bob is a hero for our troubled times.

He takes on internet spammers so you don't have to.

Born and bred in Dundee, Servant sees himself as a people's champion.

His extraordinary self-belief stems largely from his dominant position in Dundee's notorious Cheeseburger Wars of the early 1980s - a period of riotous appreciation for the traditional American snack that caused madness on the streets and lined Servant's pockets.

He continued his Midas touch in the 1990s by running what he often claims to have been the 'largest window cleaning round in Western Europe'.

And now, he's taking on the internet spammers of the world.
