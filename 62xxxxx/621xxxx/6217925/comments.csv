,chosen11one,2011-03-04T19:30Z,"@gwiapsak  I can't find  a good torrent for that movie and torrent in my sense is  which should have more seeders and should be less then 1gb, when i will find a torrent like it I will try to download it and encode it in ipod format. So for now I am not sure that when I will upload it but I will try my best:)but I will be uploading Tron Legacy soon in ipod format, so be ready for it:) "
