Year 2011. is here now, it's been some time since we've been doing these playlists, a big thank you to all of you who supported us and downloaded our lists up to now - this year we're gonna try and make them better and FRESHER!! every time...
We will, of course, continue with NAVIGATOR indie playlist each month, but in addition, we'll have some specialized playlists from other musical genres as well throughout the year. We started the year with two specials: NAVIGATOR THE BEST OF 2010 indie playlist (Alpahabetical order)  and THE BEST INDIE COVERS 2010 playlist...Hope you like them, your comments are, of course, welcome!

Anyone who is interested in sending your own stuff (via links to downloads), we would gladly listen to your music and include it in our list or radio show if we find it good, so more people would hear it...

As always, our own radio show is on the internet radio station http://radio.elektrana.net/ , every Tuesday 7pm CET. There you will be able to hear some new stuff before we upload it on the net.

We also included artwork from our good friend Andrea Rankovic. Every month you will be able to use her artwork as cover for Navigator's Fresh!! Indie Playlists.


Best regards
Navigator team
