,Kenny00000,2011-03-04T06:54Z,Trojan inside both files !!!
[M],Ubehage,2011-03-04T10:18Z,Kenny: That's not a trojan. That's the activator. Why do you think I included virus-result verification link ? :)
,DeepDarkerSpace,2011-03-04T10:34Z,"This works I used it, it activated. Thanks I really needed it my activation got messed up from that windows 7 sp1 update which messed up my activation, And I double checked to make sure it works it says its genuine. Thanks Ubehage. "

,xxbonoxx,2011-03-05T18:13Z,Is this working for SP1? 
,egk,2011-03-05T20:06Z,I can't get it to work. It opens up but it will not let me do anything. I tried disabling my anti-spam and anti-virus but nothing. Anyone have any advice?
,Motassem,2011-03-06T00:01Z,Not working
,egk,2011-03-06T02:19Z,I got it to install but it did not beat the new SP1's genuine copy issue.

,elite007man,2011-06-12T03:22Z,"Amazing, and worked on 7 x64 6.1 build 7600 fully updated as of 06-10-2011. Was having trouble validating my LEGIT windows 7 install due to me changing hard drives (went to a new SSD) and this fixed all my ""non genuine"" windows. Thanks for fixing what 6 hours on the phone with microsoft couldn't fix in less than 2 minutes."
