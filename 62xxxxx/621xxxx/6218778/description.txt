The Electric Spanking of War Babies is the twelfth studio album by American funk band Funkadelic, released in 1981 on Warner Bros. Records. The title is an allusion to the Vietnam War and baby boomers. It features many relative newcomers to the P-Funk mob, many of whom would remain employed by George Clinton on future releases under his own name or under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All-Stars. Sly Stone is a collaborator on this album. Clinton originally planned on this being a double album, but the idea was quashed by Warner Brothers. Some of the deleted tracks would appear on future P-Funk releases, most notably the 1983 hit single "Atomic Dog" which appeared on the first George Clinton solo album. This was Funkadelic's best album of the later years and a must have for fans
