Meet Will Knox, an alt-folk troubadour whose lilting British accent comes from being born and bred in Hammersmith, London, but whose smart, labyrinthine lyrics were shaped by his subsequent, more far-flung journeys. At 18, Knox moved to Boston to pursue his music career, landing support slots for Art Garfunkel, Pete Francis (of Dispatch), and Tyrone Wells. While there he created his first EP, 2007â€™s Buckled Knees; its award-winning track â€œNever Letting Goâ€ was featured in MTVâ€™s College Life.

Now a New Yorker, Knox derives inspiration from the city that never sleeps for his debut album The Matador & the Acrobat, voted one of Shred Newsâ€™ â€œTop Ten Albums of 2009.â€ The city has had a major effect on his writing style: Armed only with a pen and notebook, heâ€™d ride the subway for hours, observing this new, rich, frenetic underground worldâ€”or as one Matador track describes it, the â€œBelly of the Beast.â€ The resulting visionary melodies, hooks, and intricate arrangements create a stunning world where the songs may hold shadow and darkness, but thereâ€™s always light at the end of the tunnel.
