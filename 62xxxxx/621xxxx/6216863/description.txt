I am uploading the sorted portion of my wallpaper collection, with the exception of my personal photos. This should come to about 5,350 images (about 4.10GB), which I can use all of for wallpaper on my 1440x900 monitor. The collection is expansive, with a particular emphasis on automotive-related content, found mostly in the "Cars" folder, with 1,915 images, including the subfolder "Circuit Maps", but not including the related folder "Mountain Passes", which has 73 images of driving roads the world over.

I will be seeding until April. If someone would like me to extend this deadline so they can take up seeding, contact me on 4chan's /o/ board, where I am a regular poster.

All the best,
K Series
