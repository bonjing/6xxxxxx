This tool can be used to format a hard drive with a WBFS partition, add WBFS or ISO game images directly to a hard drive, convert WBFS to ISO and vice versa, download high quality game covers, and manage Wii games from 2 different sources simultaneously. All of the additional Nintendo themes for this software are also included. It is worth noting that this is the latest version of the software previously known as "Wii Backup Manager." This program serves it's purpose very well, and it is unlikely that any updates will ever be needed.
