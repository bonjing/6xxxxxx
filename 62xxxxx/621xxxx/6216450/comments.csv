,varikonto,2011-03-20T19:24Z,"If I run avadonkg on Mac, it doesn't give me a key, but I get this...

/Users/home/Downloads/Avadon-Keygen-TiLL/avadonkg ; exit;
Macintosh-6:~ home$ /Users/home/Downloads/Avadon-Keygen-TiLL/avadonkg ; exit;
dyld: unknown required load command 0x80000022

Can anyone make sense of it and help me out? Thanks."
,TiLLseed,2011-03-22T22:36Z,"Are you running Snow Leopard? I haven't tested on anything else.

If you have XCode installed, you should be able to go to the directory in a terminal and type:

gcc avadonkg.c && ./a.out"
