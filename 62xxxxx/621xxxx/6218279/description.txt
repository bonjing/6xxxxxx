This season focuses on Sam and Dean continuing to hunt demons, the introduction of mysteriously benevolent demon Ruby (Cassidy), and a rivalry with Bela Talbot (Cohan), a professional thief who steals the Colt. Much is made of the fact that Dean's crossroad deal means that this is his last year on Earth before going to Hell. Lilith serves as a recurring villain throughout the season.
