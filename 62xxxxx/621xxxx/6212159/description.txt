Comic genius Dave Chappelle trained his satirical eye on the vagaries of pop culture and race relations in his brilliant but short-lived Comedy Central series CHAPPELLE'S SHOW. The edgy funnyman brandished his unique style of streetsmart comedy to skewer everything from car commercials to the KKK, blending sketches, parodies, standup, and musical guest performances into a hilarious sendup of modern American life. Though the show was cancelled after only two seasons, Chappelle did record a handful of skits for a possible third season, presented here as a collection of "lost episodes."
