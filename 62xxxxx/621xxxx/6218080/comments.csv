,xtrasauce,2011-03-04T16:57Z,Why can't I see this torrent by searching eagleheart on piratebay? The only way I was able to find it was by googling. So weird.
,bjoernhund,2011-03-06T05:35Z,"Yeah, the search engine has been strange for a while now. I too searched for ""eagleheart"" and this didn't show up, but when searching for ""eagleheart.S01E05"" it did. 
It's been similar with other torrents, just weird. 
Hope they fix this error in the search engine."
