- As Gaddafi Forces Launch New Attacks, Reports on the Ground From a Divided Libya

Forces loyal to Col. Muammar Gaddafi have launched fresh air strikes on Libyan towns captured by anti-government opposition in a popular uprising over the past two weeks. Gadaffi has lost control of the eastern half of Libya and thousands of protesters are thought to have been killed by Gadaffi's forces. We get reports from two journalists on the ground in Libya: McClatchy's Nancy Youssef in Brega, and The Observer's Peter Beaumont in Tripoli.


- "Really Bad Reporting in Wisconsin": Media Parroting Walker's False Claims of Taxpayer "Subsidies" for Workers' Pensions

In their coverage of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's attempt to undermine public workers' unions, many journalists have parroted Walker's claim that unionized state workers get their pensions "subsidized" by the state. We speak with investigative reporter and Pulitzer Prize-winner David Cay Johnston, who counters the assertion that pensions are costing taxpayers by pointing out that the workers themselves contribute 100 percent in deferred compensation. Johnson's latest article is called "Really Bad Reporting in Wisconsin: Who 'Contributes' to Public Workers' Pensions?"


- NATO Gunships Kill 9 Afghan Children; 3rd Reported Attack on Afghan Civilians in 2 Weeks

NATO helicopter gunships killed nine young boys in Afghanistan on Tuesday while they collected firewood in the northeastern province of Kunar. It was at least the third instance in two weeks in which the U.S.-led NATO force was accused of killing a large number of civilians. We speak with independent journalist Rick Rowley of Big Noise Films who has extensively reported in Afghanistan. "The strategy [of] the surge has failed," Rowley says, "By every measurable means, the U.S. is losing the war."


- Bradley Manning Hit With New Charges in WikiLeaks Case, Including "Aiding the Enemy"

The U.S. Army has filed an 22 additional charges against Army Private Bradley Manning, who is alleged to have illegally downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. military and State Department documents that were then publicly released by WikiLeaks. One of the new charges, "aiding the enemy," could carry a death sentence. We speak with Glenn Greenwald, constitutional law attorney and legal blogger for Salon.com. "Although the charging document does not say who the 'enemy is,' there's only two possibilities," Greenwald says. "Either they mean Wikileaks â€¦ or any kind of leak now of classified information to newspapers where your intent is not to aid the Taliban, but expose wrongdoing."
