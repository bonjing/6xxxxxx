There is lots of high bitrate stuff which I am unable to find elsewhere.  Such as pirates at 320 kbs.
I haven't downloaded everything, but here is an somethings with their bitrate:

Gladiator 320
Lion King Expanded Score 192
Special Edition 320
Muppet Treasure Island 320
Pearl Harbor 320
Pirate's World's End 320
Pirate's Dead Man's Chest 320"

,krtislav11,2011-03-27T20:14Z,95 hours of music
,yopepoy,2011-04-01T21:28Z,"can you upload crysis 2, that's his latest composed."
,skollatus2,2011-06-20T10:57Z,Brilliant upload!
,ScoreGods,2011-07-13T19:54Z,"Discographie doesn't make sense for Hans Zimmer

1. There are far too many movies 
2. There are far too many brilliant composings (1000+)
3. They all should be in the very best untouched sound quality which would be at Wave or Flac maybe MP3 @ 320+

So uploading single albums in untouched audio format would be best



"
,ScoreGods,2011-07-17T18:08Z,"@ Uploader

Uploading albums of master composers like Hans Zimmer  only makes sense if UNTOUCHED

Uploads are welcome in full albums

1. Wave
2. Flac

If anyone needs to encode into MP3 learn the way how it is done just right. Follow the instructions while encoding, make sure you do NOT run other applications while encoding (like working in Photoshop or another audio application while its running) Doing so ends in bad quality- like so many uploads here.

MASTER COMPOSER = Top notch quality in composing, recording and ""mastering"" 
The chance you make mistakes with YOUR audio file is rather high unless you are an audio engineer or other pro with a lot of sound studio experience.  

Do NOT touch the audio files else the upload gets a negative quality rating. 


Enough said"

,thepartycrasher,2011-08-28T19:33Z,"It's always amusing how people like @ScoreGods, who have contributed FUCK ALL, want to critique the contributions of others.

If you don't like it, UPLOAD YOUR OWN! Otherwise, please keep your opinions to yourself.

Thanks..."

Yeah people don't know how to encode MP3. A prime example of this is ANY FILE with CBR. The whole point of mp3 lame encoder is it's VBR features and performance. Also ALWAYS use JOINT STEREO not stereo.

A 320CBR in stereo is RETARDED...

An --altpreset -V0 will blow it away in sound quality and be HALF THE SIZE"
,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T06:53Z,"Also if your looking for the BEST RIPPING software around then checkout

dBpoweramp

And please always encode mp3 with LAME altpreset -v2 then it will be joint stereo and optimized."
