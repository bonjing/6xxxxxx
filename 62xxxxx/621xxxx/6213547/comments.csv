,WentloogWhix,2011-03-05T20:57Z,Please be *very patient* with this download. I don't have a fast connection and my bandwidth is restricted and expensive.
,Rugburn54,2011-03-11T18:53Z,"O.K., we've been patient. The attempted up is great. The follow through for a self sustaining seeded project is a total failure. Right now people are trying to download a torrent you aren't actually feeding. If you can only feed a very small percentage for a seed don't up such large files. No orgasm on this end. You are on my ""No-Fly"" list. "
