The problem with keys posted in places like this is that they are quickly disabled, and off you go looking for another key.

You can find large collections of keys posted on sites like

http://www.kavkisfile.com/key/

These too are quickly disabled, so they post fresh ones every week.

For me, spending $20/year for a license saves me a lot of time not chasing keys for a year."
