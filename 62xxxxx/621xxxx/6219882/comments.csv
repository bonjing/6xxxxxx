,geefung,2011-03-29T22:06Z,"This game appears in my 'Backup Manager' after I uploaded it from my
File Zilla FTP server / PS3 FTP. When I load the blue  ray disc and
navigate back to the XMB I can see the Game and splash screen fine.
When I click on the X button to start the game it never loads.  Does
this game need some other file in order for it to load? I have other
games loading fine Red Dead Redemtion and a few others but this game
will NOT load. How to get this to load? What backup manager and Hex on
the PS3 USB dongle will this game work with?"
