Excellent copy that is picture perfect, this copy is as Good as the 1.4 and 1.6gb BR/BDRip versions I downloaded earlier this week. The audio is excellent too, played it through 5:1 surround system and it was spot on...
Fantastic Disney animated movie and is easily as good as the Lion King... and funnier...
Many Thanx to TvTeam and NeDiVx for the Excellent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
