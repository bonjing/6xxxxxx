,cortez_the_killer,2011-05-04T12:30Z,"ManiJan - Don't go spouting that shit you motherfucker. This torrent is where it's at - 30+ seeders, high speed download. As opposed to the shit you're trying to plug, 6 fucking seeders well you can suck my dick!!"
,cortez_the_killer,2011-05-04T12:33Z,SizeKing you the man baby! I appreciate your generosity brother.
,ImNoMyth,2011-05-06T02:49Z,Thanks SO much for your hard work.  Would you mind sharing what programs you use to rip these into x264 mkv files PLEASE?  I would REALLY love to rip my dvd/bluray collection to my hard drive but my current set up takes up too much space!  Thanks again.
