                Fed up with his boring life on Creevey Farm Alo goes
                to the city to seriously party and try to get laid.
                Meanwhile his parents, fed up with his behaviour,
                remove him from college in an attempt to force him to
                buckle down on the farm. But Alo rebels and hosts a
                party that ruins the farm. He hopes that this will
                show his parents that they can't keep him trapped
                there, but when his dad is hospitalised he finally
                sees it's time to grow up.
