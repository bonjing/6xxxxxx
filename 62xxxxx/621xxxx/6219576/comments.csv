,jewelsowinner,2011-06-22T02:47Z,Not the best quality with the pictures cutting off on the sides. Is this some handy cam in the movie or just a really poor quality rip?
,AtotehZ,2011-09-08T21:22Z,"TeleSync. If you look at the time this was uploaded and go to IMDB you'll see that the movie was still in the cinema back then.

It is wrong to upload it in the DVD-R section and for that I rated it down.

They should make a section only for TeleSync..."
