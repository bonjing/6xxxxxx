                Final episode of the chilling drama about three
                families who live in the same remote house in
                different time periods. In 1968, Paul asks a tearful
                Ruth to leave Marchlands with him, while things come
                to a head between Robert and Evelyn. In 1987, Eddie
                and Helen are still at loggerheads. Eddie takes Amy
                to Alice's grave, and Scott has another seizure. In
                2010, Nisha is shocked to discover that Mark has lied
                to her about the history of Marchlands. An emotional
                Ruth finally learns what happened to her daughter all
                those years ago.
