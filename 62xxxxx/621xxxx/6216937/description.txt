From Wiki:


Roderick David "Rod" Stewart, CBE (born 10 January 1945)[2] is a British singer-songwriter and musician, born and raised in North London, England and currently residing in Epping. He is of Scottish and English lineage.

With his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart came to prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s with The Jeff Beck Group and then Faces. He launched his solo career in 1969 with his debut album An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down (US: The Rod Stewart Album). His work with The Jeff Beck Group and Faces proved to be influential on the formation of the punk rock and heavy metal genres, respectively.[3][4]

With his career in its fifth decade, Stewart has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best selling artists of all time.[5] In the UK, he has garnered six consecutive number one albums, and his tally of 62 hit singles include 31 that reached the top 10, six of which gained the number one position.[6] He has had 16 top ten singles in the U.S, with four of these reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the "The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists".[7] He was voted at #33 in Q Magazine's list of the top 100 Greatest Singers of all time.[8] In 1994, Stewart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.




Atlantic Crossing 2009


Atlantic Crossing is Rod Stewart's sixth album, released in 1975, and peaking at number nine on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. On June 30, 2009, Rhino released a two-disc version with bonus tracks.

The title indicated Stewart's new commercial and artistic direction, a double pun on both his crossing over to Warner Brothers and on his departure to escape the tax structure of the United Kingdom for the sunnier pastures of the jet-set life in Los Angeles, applying for American citizenship at this time. The album was divided into a slow side and a fast side, apparently at the suggestion of Stewart's then-girlfriend, Swedish actress Britt Ekland. Stewart would repeat the format for his next two albums.

Stewart jettisoned his association with Ronnie Wood and the stable of musicians who had been his core collaborators on his classic run of albums fusing soul and folk on Mercury Records. Instead, he used a group of high-ticket session musicians, including the cream from Memphis with The Memphis Horns and three-quarters of Booker T. and the MG's. Produced by Tom Dowd, the famous engineer and producer on records by so many of Rod's heroes during Dowd's time on staff at Atlantic Records, the album continued his approach as at Mercury, but with more polish, more of a deliberate commercial sheen. Atlantic Crossing inaugurated the next phase of Stewart's career, that of a glamorous front-rank rock personality, a constant figure in various tabloids, underlining Stewart's appeal and star power. Stewart would confirm this new direction by the end of year with the announcement of his exit from the Faces, a band of mates rather than hired hands, and as the decade progressed by embracing popular trends in hard rock and disco more fully.

Stewart continued his mastery of ballad singing as a track from this album, "I Don't Want to Talk About It," hit number one in the UK, in tandem with "The First Cut Is the Deepest".

The design of the album was a bit of a marketing mistake. It did not have track listings on the outside and the cover was regularly ripped open.
