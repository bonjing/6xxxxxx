,Arrogant,2011-03-02T10:39Z,That`s impressive. Thanks a lot from a fan of You in Norway!
[T],trialNerror,2011-03-05T04:46Z,"You're very welcome!  :D

Goodness gracious 62.5 GiB is a lot to upload!  LOL!  Please be patient, I will be seeding this as much as possible.  

I'm having to swap uploading between this and the Season 4 of Ghost Adventures (which honestly am disappointed by the lack of seeders - I stopped it when I saw 12 seeds, but now it's back down to 1 [me])."
[T],trialNerror,2011-03-06T04:30Z,"With that GA S04 taken care of with a bit more seeders available for it, I'll be seeding this gigantic collection darn near constantly from now on!"
,Charlie117,2011-03-08T04:37Z,"This is awesome! I get around 300kb/s for a while, then stops, and comes back, but I understand the initial seeding and appreciate what you're doing :).
Thanks."
,Arrogant,2011-03-09T10:50Z,I shut down my computer when not inuse therefor I only seed when its on...
[T],trialNerror,2011-03-10T06:14Z,"Every little bit helps, Arrogant.  Thank you.

Within a couple days there *should* be more seeders able to share the Complete Collection.  Seems to be about 10% uploaded to some in a day and they're currently at approximately 86%.

Thanks again to all the supporters and helpers!"
,STriderFIN77,2011-03-14T06:38Z,"Seems like im only seeder at the moment, and i took only extras :D"
[T],trialNerror,2011-03-14T09:46Z,"I've uploaded 100GB so far and am still seeding as often as I can.  In uTorrent it reports about a dozen (fluctuates) seeders, but perhaps much of those are like STrider and only went for/sharing the Extras. Hm. Pewp. I guess 62.5 GB is too much."
[T],trialNerror,2011-03-28T12:36Z,"Not as frequent as I use to, but am still seeding this beast..."
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-05-25T16:58Z,Thanks tNe. You are awesome!
,swe_mike4,2011-07-26T05:05Z,anyone know when season 7 is relesed?
,Yoursupply,2011-07-31T13:33Z,"Ghost adventures with that pretty boy is lame...
Ghost Hunters... they rock... well, kinda... "
,hawkeye1326,2011-08-19T03:59Z,SEEEED! im going to seed for 5 days or more! seed!
,hawkeye1326,2011-08-19T04:01Z,thank you trial! ive been looking for the complete set!
,LoonyJ,2011-09-09T19:20Z,"@swe_mike4
The last episode of season 7 airs on October 5, and as soon as it is finished, I will compile a torrent for that season. Just be patient, or if you want each episode right after it comes out, check out Tube + and you can find them there."
,swe_mike4,2011-09-12T01:51Z,"LoonyJ
thanks allot will wait impatiently for it. and since i cant see 1 episode and then wait cant handla that "
,icescate,2011-09-15T18:19Z,did you have another version that you took down. The reason I ask is because I've been seeding this for a couple of weeks and the weird thing about it is that my bit torrent7.2.1. says there is more people are seedin & leechers
,JamesYaDeadHomie,2011-09-26T00:55Z,"It would be nice if people would SEED, I have a 8mb connection, and I've been downloading the first season since 11am, and only have gotten 3 episodes finished, and now it's 7pm. -_-"
[T],trialNerror,2011-10-28T10:17Z,"Oh, that's weird. 
6 seeds and 66 leechers.
Yikes!
Anyway, am still once in a while u/l'ing this fat turd
Nearly 63 GiB! That's BIG! Please be patient.

As for larger #'s for seeds & leeches showing up in a torrent client: that's due to the DHT which has seeds the trackers don't account for."
,heyirockmylaptop,2011-11-27T01:13Z,PLEASE SEED!!!! ive been downloading this file for quite some time now! there is almost no seeders and my download does not go up from 100k/bs :(
,big_griff,2012-02-10T06:49Z,"pleaes seed, theres 73 leechers and only 7 seeders cmon people"
,big_griff,2012-02-10T06:52Z,if anyone can upload creepy canada i would very much enjoy that it is by far my favorite show thanks pirates
