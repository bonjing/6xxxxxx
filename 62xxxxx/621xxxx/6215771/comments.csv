,elcapizzo,2011-07-09T11:21Z,"Terrible movie. Extremely convoluted and inconsistent plot during the movie and also the actual game series. Horrible ad-hoc mix of animation styles and character representation.

DS: Downfall was much better. This was a waste of DL and time.

Oh, the aspect ratio was crap and the vid was slow so it sounded like it was in slo motion. I had to use VLC to speed it up to make it watchable.

,Ghostwork,2011-12-19T04:42Z,i'm not sure if this is a proper xvid.  it wouldn't stream over to my xbox like every other xvid-type video.
,WthnMyslf,2012-01-25T00:36Z,"Its people like you, elcapizzo, that make me wonder just why anyone goes to the trouble of putting anything up at all on these torrent sites.  First off, this isnt a forum for movie discussion so whatever you feal about the movie should be kept to youself PLUS you wouldnt even have known you hated it if miguel1983 hadnt of put it up in the first place....secondly, I'm tired of all these winny little babies getting all their shit for free and then bitching about it because a fucking pixel is out of place.....if you have a fucking problem then go buy the fucking movie and shut the fuck up and let the rest of us enjoy our internet freedom while we still can....in closing...eat shit...die"
