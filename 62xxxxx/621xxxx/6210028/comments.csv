,Kekkai,2011-03-05T03:58Z,"Thank you, as always, it's wonderful to be able to watch House and not have to worry about being in front of the television and having the episode interrupted by commercials.   Your downloads are always seeded well, and take very little time.

I'd love to see what else you provide torrents for, as I'm looking for a second show to watch - until the next season of AMC's genuinely great series - Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and The Walking Dead - and of course, Dexter from mainstream HBO/SHO.  One episode of something each night at dinner - that much television and no more.

Will you provide the AMC series?  It would be great if you did, to have a reliable source for them when the season starts."
