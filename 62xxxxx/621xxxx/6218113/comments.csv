,henkiedepenkie,2011-03-04T14:59Z,is  it the original version?? not just a patched japanese version
,Degtyarev,2011-03-04T16:31Z,"Checked and confirmed legit, this is the European version and NOT a patched JAP copy.

Is there any piracy protection though? Blocked XP or whatever? No idea.

Thanks Scenetime, very much appreciated!"
