I've downloaded so much from TPB over the years, figured it was time to give back.  Here's a torrent I made myself of "The Darkness" for the XBox 360.

I had previously played and enjoyed "The Darkness" on the PS3, and when I saw a copy of the 360 version for five bucks, I figured I'd buy it and rip it.

When I ripped the disc I had bought, abgx360 said it was region-free, so figured it would be a good candidate to upload!

So, here is a region-free English copy of "The Darkness" for the 360.  It's an old game, but I enjoyed playing through it and figured it's always nice to pick up oldies but goodies.

Archive is 7-zipped, tested a burn with imgburn on my modded 360 and it works just fine.  Again, abgx360 says it's region-free, but I purchased the game in Amerika so I'm using it on my modded NTSC Amerikan XBox 360 just fine.
