,ryans435,2011-08-30T19:23Z,"The first IMG is ""Dragon Age: Origins"" for some reason.  At first, I thought it was my PC messing up, because every time I mounted the image, Dragon Age started up.  So I restarted my pc twice, I tried using a different mounting software, and I tried deleting my actual image for the dragon age game.

I don't know what the hell is going on, but I can't watch the first img...The second one works fine though."
