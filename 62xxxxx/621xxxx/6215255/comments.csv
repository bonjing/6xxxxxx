,alicedowntherabbithole,2011-04-02T03:47Z,Thank you very much
,spike68,2011-04-30T07:19Z,I have been looking everywhere for this. Thanks so much.
,spike68,2011-05-14T04:21Z,I can't get the video to play correctly. The audio is good quality though.
,pjsmoke,2011-06-27T01:14Z,"The quality is just as good as the original source, which is good enough. However, mkvgod forgot to re-encode and mux the audio for one of the episodes. I completely forget which episode it was though.

Also, it's a shame that only half of the episodes in season 2 are widescreen and the others are 4:3.

Still worth a download as this show is hard to find and there aren't any dvdrips of this show anywhere."

That would be season 2 episode 11 - The past is prologue I'm currently up to that episode and have no idea what i can do to resolve the issue."
,pjsmoke,2011-07-18T18:57Z,"Download that episode from bitsnoop. Just search Jerimiah season 2.

You can either re-encode it or if you don't know how to do that download ""MKVmerge"" and add that audio to the mkvgod video. It should be in syc with the video."
,pjsmoke,2011-07-18T19:00Z,Tick the video tab on bitsnoop and search Jerimiah season 2.

Thanks for the info, I had never heard of bitsnoop before, I'll download that 1 episode from there and just watch that version, I'm not a big fan of MKV's, I only downloaded this torrent because it was the only Jeremiah torrent I could find :D"
,gmhoth,2011-10-20T10:22Z,"Good trick asshole.   For the unwary, this is not the full series, it's the pilot and a couple of episodes only.   So mkvGOD, why would you do this to anyone, asshole."
,gmhoth,2011-10-20T10:41Z,"Not the full series, just the pilot and another episode, very misleading."
[V],mkvGOD,2011-10-31T05:14Z,"@gmhoth
Umm...there are 35 episodes here, which is the whole series. So idk what you're talking about"
,Makaras00,2012-02-12T21:18Z,"Legit, helped me finish the second season when netflix took it off Insta'"
,honunet,2012-05-26T21:09Z,thanks bro
