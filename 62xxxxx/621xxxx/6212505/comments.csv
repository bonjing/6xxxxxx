This isn't fucking usenet, open your eyes and unrar this shit before you seed it so all can verify.
No thanks from me."
,thepirateboy43,2011-03-02T21:52Z,"@aparadox Sceneline is trusted. RAR's make it smaller. Don't like it? Buy the DVD 12 months after the TV show. 

Excellent release as always, kudos to you :)"
,panties,2011-03-03T00:52Z,now I`ve heard that too... Vids stopped getting smaller by compression by the time divx and mp3 arrived lol :P

.RAR's don't make modern video formats small, it just reduces the amount of people willing to seed a torrent. 

Look at the size of the file compressed and then the file alone, its the same.. Its a waste of time and slows down torrents"
