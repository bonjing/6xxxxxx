"Among the DC Slime Artists: Tom DiLorenzo on Congress, the Fed and the Smearbund"


Lew Rockwell on how very worried the Fed is about its critics.

Congressional creeps would not be so rude, insolent, lying, hateful and dismissive in their malicious libel of an invited committee guest, appearing at his own expense, unless they were afraid, very afraid. But efforts to silence Tom DiLorenzo, Ron Paul, and the rest of us will not work against those of us who will not back down, or away, from truth.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
