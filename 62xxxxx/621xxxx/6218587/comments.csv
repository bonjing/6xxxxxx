,immagical,2012-01-22T16:32Z,"@luukx20.  the problem you are having is that a laptops volume is pretty crap when up 100% especial;y with new movies with good detauiled audio. if you use earphones or even a pair of decent speakers you will see that the audio is great, compared to the older version of this film. meaning the old vhs or dvd.."

No offense, but perhaps you should be watching this on something better than a laptop if you're going to complain about sound quality.  Or at least buy a decent pair of external speakers with their own amplification.  "
