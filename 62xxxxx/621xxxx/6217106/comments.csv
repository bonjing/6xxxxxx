[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-16T16:24Z,"You seed by leaving it running in uTorrent. You need to so others can download it too. You got your files from someone who was seeding, you need to do your bit so everyone gets it. If no one seeded, you wouldn't have been able to download anything. "

,_kn0wledge_,2011-03-30T03:47Z,You rock! I love you fellow house fan. Thanks for uploading. If anyone can point me in the right direction as to how I can upload media (I have close to a Terabyte full) I would really appreciate being a contributor like our good friend Sniffer_V here...
,beardownUA,2011-03-30T07:08Z,"Unfortunately, I need to point out a flaw in this torrent, even after I praised it. Season 6 has a couple problems with it. For starters, there are only 21 episodes in the season, not 22. Next, I noticed that the titles of the episodes were incorrect (a minor detail, not too concerned with it). But the biggest one is that there are 3 missing episodes. Instead of those 3, there are copies of other episodes. Here's IMDB's page for season 6 and all the correct episodes, in order, and properly named. Sorry Sniffer_V, but no one is perfect

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/episodes#season-6"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-30T19:17Z,"Firstly re the episodes, the first episode of season 6 is a double episode, on the DVD it's as 2 episodes, this is a DVDRip so has 22 episodes.

Secondly, which 3 episodes are missing? I'm downloading them all now to check can you tell me which ones you think are missing?"
,lionsun,2011-03-31T14:23Z,"c'ON ppl seed seeeeeeeeeeeed plz,, it's huge torrent my DL is less than 9kbs......seeeeeeeeeed THX"
,_kn0wledge_,2011-03-31T21:44Z,"Yo Sniffer,

about those files in question... You have every episode of season 6 in the file. However you have the episodes named wrong. The problem stems from naming the episode ""Broken"" part 1 and part 2 when in actuality both parts 1 and 2 are in the first file of season six (its the hour and a half long episode). Also the only episode you have in there twice is ""Baggage"" so just delete one of those (the extra episode of ""Baggage"" is named ""Help Me"" which is the last episode in the season.) So just change the name of each file and also delete the extra episode of ""Baggage"" and everything else is great. make sense?"

,bvanlogg,2011-04-05T16:04Z,"Guys, I need help!! I'm pretty friggin' addicted to this show, but only started watching from season 4... *shamed face* I'm also VERY new to downloading shows and movies straight from the web, never knew how to. 
I tried downloading it season by season from another link, but after 3 days of download for S01, the damn thing turned out to be in Italian! I wanna get this right, but I don't have enough space on my C drive for this file. I have 110Gb free on my D drive, but I don't know how to ""Save"" it onto that drive. Please please help me out, I feel like a total moron! I have Windows Vista Home Premium software, so if anyone can tell me more about how my computer works and how this whole ""seeding/"" leeching"" thing works, I'd be so grateful. An that way I can educate future idiots. 
PLEASE REPLY!!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-04-05T20:47Z,"First of all you need to change the directory you have for your downloads. I'm assuming you use uTorrent, if not download that. File, Preferences, Directories. Choose the D Drive for where to store downloads in.

Second thing to know is that you can download this episode by episode if you want, when you download the torrent you'll see it opens up and you tick the bits you want to download, just untick the ones you don't want.

Thirdly, search for uTorrent FAQ's

Fourthly, this addiction of yours, whatever it is that has caused it, it's not lupus.

Hope that helps."

NOTHING!!! how much work did you put into uploading and sharing this? NONE. . . . dont complain about something that was free and that you had to do no work to get, dont like it go spend a couple hundred bucks or more and pick it up at wal mart"
,sgtscrota,2011-05-06T07:40Z,"@crooked_b

So nobody is supposed to say anything about the duplicates and missing episodes, so that everyone else can download and find out for themselves the hard way?

Hey, want me to wash your car for free? Oh you don't like that I took a dump in your glove box? too bad, it was free."
,LadyBlackArachnia,2011-05-06T18:19Z,"Okay, here's the thing, I did some research and the episodes are all there http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_House_episodes I went through each of the torrents files and looked at the list. So I believe they are all there. So no worries CX. If they aren't playing then i am as lost as you. I only use Windows Media Player as well and uTorrent bjut hopefully that wont happen to me. Your welcome for helping CX and thanks Toilet_sniffer_V."
,sgtscrota,2011-05-07T06:29Z,"LadyBlackArachnia,

If you just compare the file names then yes, they are all there, but if you actually WATCH them you will find that a few episodes of season 6 are there twice but under different names. 

For example, if you open the file named as ""Season 6, Episode 20 - The Choice"", it is the same episode as  ""Season 6, Episode 21 - Baggage"". The same for eps 16 and 17, and 12 and 13, meaning that 3 episodes are missing. Plus the first file of season 6 is actually ""Broken"" parts 1 AND 2, therefore the episode names for each following files are displaced.

If you don't actually watch them and just go by filenames then you can't see the problem, that was my (and a few other posters') point."
,LadyBlackArachnia,2011-05-07T08:03Z,"Please seed, hate to be one of those ppl but right now I am. I was hoping to watch it with my mom for mothers day weekend. So please help and I can seed afterwords."

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-05-14T17:55Z,"I've checked season 6 and there is 1 duplicate that I can see. All episodes are in there but the episode number and name is out by one. If you start at the beginning of season 6 and watch every episode in turn you will watch them all in the correct order. Episode 2 shouldn't be there and so episode 3 should be number 2, episode 4 should be 3 and so on.

When season 7 finishes in 2 weeks time, I will upload seasons 1-7 inc and I have started season 6 again from scratch. They are all named correctly this time."

,ehagglun,2011-07-16T23:54Z,"Oh yeah, nice going douchebag.... 
First episode is a double, which means it's twice as long... therefore Season 6 episodes 2-11 is mislabeled. 
Episode 12 is a duplicate of episode 13 (meaning its the same fucking episode)
Episode 14 is missing
Episode 15 is mislabeled (should be 16)
Episode 16 is duplicate of episode 17
Episode 17 is correct, whoopi well done
Episode 18 is missing, instead its a duplicate of episode 19
Episode 20 is missing. instead it's a duplicate of episode 21
Episode 21 is correct... wow.
Episode 22 finally is correct.

What the hell were you doing, smoking weed?

@crooked_b: So just because it's free anyone can put up any kind of shit? Like, you want to download that new Transformers movie but instead you get Little Mermaid? You're stupid and I guess you know it...
