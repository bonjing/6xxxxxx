Any TV made since 1949 can show 540p

720x1280(720p) is the lowest resolution that is defined as HiDef

If you're going to rip from BluRay at least keep the resolution above that of standard DVD's (800x600) or you're just wasting your time."

960x540 is High(er) Resolution, hence its in the right cathegory. You are right that this is not quite HD resolution, but quality does not come only from resolution and its optimal choice for small size smartphone optimised movies."
