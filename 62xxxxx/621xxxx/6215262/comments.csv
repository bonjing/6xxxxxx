,somematt,2011-04-14T05:52Z,Thanks for the .mkv collection of this awesome show!
,somematt,2011-04-18T02:50Z,"I'm still really happy about this one, but one small item of notice: The episode ""30% Iron Chef"" is missing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_30%25_Iron_Chef

I probably wouldn't have noticed, but I am a bit particular about my naming conventions so came across that.

I'm keeping my ""+"" vote on this, though. It really is a great collection!"

Thanks for letting me know, I will re-upload this with that episode after the rest of season 6 is finished"

,ThomBags,2011-06-19T04:59Z,Anyone else notice the audio is sped up by about 1 note?
,LouieChuckyMerry,2011-07-19T14:13Z,"mkvGOD:  I'm very appreciative for your effort; I wish that more Uploaders realized the advantages of using the Advanced Video CODEC (AVC) and the Matroska (MKV) container to reduce file sizes yet retain quality and increase usability.  That typed, perhaps you'd consider also taking advantage of the Advanced Audo CODEC (AAC) so that a larger percentage of the reduced files can be dedicated to the video while still maintaining audio quality.  Most people can't hear the difference between 192 Kbps 2-channel AC-3 and 64 Kbps 2-channel AAC-LC, and if you made this change it means that your present video rate of 384 Kbps would be increased to 512 Kbps (while maintaining the exact same file size).  Just a thought, and thanks again."
,LouieChuckyMerry,2011-07-27T11:04Z,"Good quality files for their size, A7 V7.  All files for seasons 1, 2, and 3 have 192 kbps CBR AC-3 audio and ~384 kbps AVC video; all files for seasons 4, 5, and 6 have ~128 kbps AAC-LC audio and ~384 kbps AVC video.  EVERY file has an incorrect aspect ratio of 3:2 excepting season 1, episode 1, which has a proper aspect ratio of 4:3.  Using your video player to change the aspect ratio of the remainder of season 1 and all of seasons 2, 3, and 4 to 4:3 corrects those errors; using your video player to change the aspect ratio of seasons 5 and 6 to 16:9 corrects those errors.  These files play fine in VLC Media Player and The KMPlayer without the installation of any additional CODECs.  Thanks to the Uploader."
,Jabdy69,2011-08-25T10:22Z,PLEASE SEED!!! Downloading at 10 KiB/s. Too slow!
,Delixu,2011-10-18T18:57Z,You and Google are the only two gods I believe in.
,Jooshua,2011-10-25T11:50Z,Hey mkvgod.. I love your downloads and REALLY appreciate this one.. but from what I read on IMDb these are incredibly out of order.. is IMDb wrong? Or are they meant to be this way? Sorry not trying to complain.. just a little confused.
[V],mkvGOD,2011-10-31T05:16Z,"@Jooshua
These are put in the production order. The episodes were aired in a different order"
