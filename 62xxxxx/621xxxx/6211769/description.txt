Golden Trout Software Shadow Copy Cloner 1.1.3

Shadow Copy Cloner backs up all of your files, including Windows system files, by copying them to a second disk drive. Since the backup disk is a normal NTFS file system you can easily recover a corrupted file or folder by copying it back. Unlike other backup products, Shadow Copy Cloner preserves Windows file and folder permissions, preserving the security of your multiple-user system. A key feature of Shadow Copy Cloner is that it can make a bootable copy of your system drive. Should the system disk in your computer crash, you can install the backup disk in your computer and boot your system as it was when your last backup was made.
