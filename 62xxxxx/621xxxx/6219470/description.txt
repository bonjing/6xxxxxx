bought this for myself as a nostalgia trip and for music to work out to on my step and exercise bike. 
It was a bargain and I haven't regretted buying it. It contains many old faves [which are on every 80s compo going] 
plus some rarer classics and some songs I can barely remember. An absolute must for anyone who grew up in the 80s, 
or who wish they had! Best track: 'Some like it hot' by the Power station. A belter of a song, much under-rated 
in my humble opinion.
