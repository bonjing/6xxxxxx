Dexter is one of the best TV sitcoms.

Like many other guys i was having a problem with the English subtitles,
which are not syncing properly with the episodes available here

so i found an another way to get rid of it.

with the help of an particular software
i edited and synced those subtitles for each episode correctly
&
here are the "Actual English Subtitles" for this series without any syncing problem.

Cheers guys...enjoy. :)
