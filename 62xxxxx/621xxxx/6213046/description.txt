Rainbow - Death Alley Driver [promo].VOB


Very HQ rare promo music video. "Death Alley Driver" is a song from Straight Between the Eyes, the sixth LP released by Rainbow, released in 1982. A remastered CD reissue, with packaging duplicating the original vinyl release, was released in May 1999.
 
The band line-up was the same as had recorded the previous year's Difficult to Cure album, with the exception of David Rosenthal, who replaced Don Airey on keyboards.
 
The title allegedly came from a phrase from Jeff Beck, describing Jimi Hendrix to Blackmore.

This promo video was made for Death Alley Driver featuring Sega's Turbo arcade video game and a motorcycle/car chase scene. It is still occasionally aired on VH1's Metal Mania program.

Rainbow (also known as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow or Blackmore's Rainbow) were an English rock band, controlled by former Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore from 1975 to 1984 and 1994 to 1997. It was originally established with former Elf members, though over the years Rainbow went through many lineup changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. In addition to lead singers Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White, the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neo-classical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.
