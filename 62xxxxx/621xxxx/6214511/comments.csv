,SupremeViper,2011-04-29T14:48Z,"Oke, then first i would like to thank XoLWoX for updating the black version aswell as the white version, so thanks :D. And now well the white version is absolutly not working for the R4 card.
The black version works just fine, so far no error's occured but the white version doesnt even launch it shows a white screen the moment i start the game."
