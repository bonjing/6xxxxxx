I test all my stuff in VLC and WDTVHD Live media Player

****************************************************************

I provide a small sample, so please download this to check your 
compatibility first if you are unsure.

If you can't watch mkv's, burn them to DVD using Convertxtodvd (4)

For all of you downloaders, I would like to give you some advice, 
you should at least be using an IP blocker such as PeerGuardian 2
and Ultrasurf (hides your ip) they are both free and fairly easy to set up. 
The next level of security is an Anonymous Proxy or a VPN, both 
hide your IP address, but VPN hides everything you do online, I 
am afraid you have to pay for both of those, but will prevent 
ISP letters.
