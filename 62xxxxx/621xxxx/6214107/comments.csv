,MrBrownastoneize,2011-07-17T15:35Z,"@ chesss You cannot do that. But a 2 Tb drive costs 120$ tho..

A hundred Gig file? How about vol.1 and vol.2?"

,trod999,2011-08-18T16:06Z,"First of all, thanks for the huge torrent... it'll be great once it's done!  Problem is... the download speeds on this torrent are terrible, even though I'm connected to 7 seeders and 22 peers.  Download speeds average around 30kB/s (upload averages 40kB/s).  D/L reaches a short peak of over 100kB/s which is nice, but it never sustains it.  It's not uncommon for d/l to drop below 10kB/s.  I've been at this torrent for 10 days now, and am at 31.4%.   I'm using BitTorrent 7.2.1, and it works great on every other torrent I've used.  Does anyone have any ideas?  Or are others getting the same d/l results?  Thanks!"
,trod999,2011-09-09T15:27Z,"Well, I'll answer my own question.  It took about 30 days to download this whole thing.  I got the best results by limiting upload speed to 50kB/s :-\  I know I know, but when I left it unlimited, my d/l speed sucked Bishops.  Now it's happily seeding, so u/l is unlimited.  While d/l averaged around 50kB/s, it would vary wildly from 20kB/s to 80kB/s, and sometimes outside those ranges (as low as 0, as high as 300), but it would never sustain itself long outside 20-80.  It mostly hovered around 30 when I'd look at it, so there were enough high spikes to make the average around 50kB/s.  Hope this helps!"
,Krmpf,2011-09-16T14:46Z,"Could someone reload the separate sections (Openings A00-A99, B00-B99, etc.) as single torrents? I don't need it all at once, but I'd seed the ones I want for some time."
,Krmpf,2011-09-16T14:48Z,"If you do, it would be very kind not to use rar to create a single big file ... Thx!"
,bl0nd3,2011-12-14T04:46Z,"A very unique material, just hoping download won't take forever. Thanks man!"
,Fipper,2012-03-27T16:44Z,"It took me 8 days and 18 hours to download. Great torrent, well worth the wait. Thanks Mart!"
,Trendle,2012-05-24T01:55Z,"Very nice torrent, no doubt... but it's crazy to pack it all in a single 100GB rar!!

Btw, SEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!"
,Trendle,2012-05-31T13:56Z,This should be on a private tracker... I'm stuck at 62%... dl speeds are a joke.
