Due to popular demand I have produced this Fritztrainer Megapack which contains every Fritztrainer ever made (up to 1/1/2011). I had to put it in a compressed RAR file unfortunately otherwise the torrent file was too big and Demonoid wouldn't let me upload it, so you'll have to download the whole lot if you want it. Check available disk space before you begin downloading as the file is over 100GB!!! Enjoy!
