Since this download is not an AP 2.5 torrent, is it then not safe to play?
Should I download the REPACKED version of the game instead so I can play with AP 2.5, if that will make a difference? :)

(Sorry, please bear with me, I am not an expert at this)"
,manowx28,2011-03-04T19:57Z,"this game does not have ap25 protection,  so this game does not need any patch ok...the burning speed is bullshit if you have a good medium and a good burner and a good brand like verbatim.. soo burn it at any speed.


fuck the the speed like 2.5   cause  many  burnerr  wont that  speed anyway!!

questions  like  will this work on ixtreme 1.6??  where  have you been for the last years?? 

google shit first  and  don't ask noob questions ok"

,dragonhan222,2011-03-05T14:42Z,"@Discokid 
if the game fails to update it means you used the 360 waves patcher to play the game, in order to update you must put in a clean ripped copy of the game

1 download this torrent if you dont have the .rar files already with you

2 burn the .iso do not use the waves patcher

3 get your hands on the activate.iso 

update should complete if you use these 

happy hunting pirates "

Then I click on the game disc again to load it and it starts loading the game (the loading screen from the game itself shows up), but then, all of a sudden, I get the ""The disc is unreadable."" error. Does anybody know what I am doing wrong?

I have the latest firmware update which was required for the AP2.5 games (I think it's iXtreme 2.1) and I burned a fresh rip (no patch since I have the latest firmware). Also, if it's any help I downloaded the Repacked version (the ""fixed"" one) which was later uploaded. 

Thanks in advance guys!"
,IceIceTommaY,2011-03-16T03:54Z,@sean yeah I've burned a bunch of games before... but this is twice I burned this game with a new burner (that has burned games successfully) and i get that logo... weird.   ABGX ran it fine too...

I've accumulated of over 9TB of prated stuff from over the years and this has never happened before...

Meh, it's probably Karma kicking me cause i didn't seed this enough (i was in a rush to get the game and kinda hit-n-ran at 3.5MBps)
