Following the quelling of Lajos Kossuth's 1848 revolution against Habsburg rule in Hungary, prison camps were set up for people suspected of being Kossuth's supporters. Around 20 years later, some members of famed highwayman SÃ¡ndor RÃ³zsa's guerilla band, believed to be some of Kossuth's last supporters, are known to be interred among the prisoners in a camp. During the film, the prison staff try to weed out and identify the rebels and find out if SÃ¡ndor is among them using various means of mental and physical torture and trickery. When one of the guerillas, JÃ¡nos Gajdar, is identified as a murderer by an old woman, he starts aiding his captors by acting as an informant. Gajdar is told that if he can show his captors a man who has killed more people than himself, he will be spared. Fearing for his life, he turns in several people his captors had been looking for by name, but couldn't identify among the prisoners.
