,ferusx,2011-06-28T17:30Z,"Can someone verify if this is the original, untouched version and not the enhanced, remastered version?
If not, can anyone help me with where I can find the original version?"
,duffyrabbit,2011-09-04T03:07Z,"Dude, the original, untouched versions were nnever released in HD, so it is pointless to upconvert the DVDs/480i to 720p.

The enhanced versions are way better than the original DVDs.  Paramount did not do a hack job on the enhancements, unlike what Georgie Lucas does, so you have nothing to worry about."
