There is the way - tell the reasons on Forum. They are not reasonable (TPB administrators) enough to remove ""Quality"" button - pure sandbox for lunatics.

Hey - but endlessly dangerous Tweet button (as direct line to MPAA agents) is right here to make our days."

,etowhid,2011-03-01T15:36Z,"Hi 20-40,

I know requests are ""ON HOLD"", but I'd really really appreciate it if you could reseed Lie to Me S03E04 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5912699/Lie.to.Me.S03E04.480p.HDTV.H264).

I have all the other episodes, & my collection is incomplete without this one. If it is possible for you to share the file (torrent/direct download), please do. Thank you. :)"

,jon4fun,2011-03-01T16:29Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers
Jon

Thanks for Castle and The CF Show.

The same idiots everyday, loggin on just to put a [-] against you. At least you can take one thing from them, the most precious comodity of all - time. These losers waste their time logging on just to [quality] something without watching. It wouldn't surprise me if the idiots DL your brilliant work anyway and just can't figure out how you can be so good at encoding."

,ibg270,2011-03-01T19:42Z,seed guys! i'm having too slow download speed!
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-01T19:59Z,"@r-0987: Unfortunately, I tried to watch that movie last night. And: it's a piece of Kryptonite in hands of Lord Voldemort, living proof that both Reese and Jack can play in bad movie, and even contribute quite a lot. Owen is bad as bad can be, and Mr. Rudd proved once more how he can't act at all. Writer should be shot dead and director hanged by the neck... Enough?

@ibg270: I seed. You can download whole pack in 320 seconds."
