But there is a Nightlies version also !
ask to google and search and you will see that i don't lie anymore.
Otherwise what interest to lie about ?
don't worry it is 100% guenine bro !
it's just an advanced version of vlc,but videolan.org doesn't directly release such version to public.However you are completely free and fully allowed to download,test and use it... 
It's just a better more advanced version than the classic vlc ;)
