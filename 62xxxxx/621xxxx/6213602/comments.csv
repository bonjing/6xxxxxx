,jmac85,2011-03-03T01:01Z,"Thank you for this share. On a side note, I've been reencoding 720p 1+ GB shows to fit my laptop screen (1024 pixels wide). I have found that 576p is a good nonstandard resolution to consider. With 1024x576, I can get 60m shows with ~80kbit audio down to about 280mb. Of course, I use CRF of 27 rather than specifying a bitrate as well as using --preset slower on x264. Any other suggestions?"
,banukaknight,2011-03-03T02:16Z,tnx for putting lie to me in BOSS .. jai ho!
,believenu,2011-03-03T04:51Z,"thank you, seeding is sharing"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-03T07:42Z,"@jmac85: At low bit-rates, two-pass encoding is imperative. I've done 576p (as a counterpart to NTSC 480p) and I think it's good frame size especially for movies (and for personal use, because I have big problems with morons who cannot accept something out of their common frame).

Extremely low bit-rates imply two-pass and turning x264 upside down - therefore, presets should be avoided. I can send you encoding lines in e-mail, not here."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-03T07:43Z,Thanks guys.
