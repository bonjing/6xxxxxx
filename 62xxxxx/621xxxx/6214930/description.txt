"Balance"

When free-spirited Callie admits to frugal 
Adam that she is in major debt and then goes 
to extreme measures to secure a royal 
interview for him, Adam worries that the 
differences in their approach to finances 
might be too much for their relationship to 
handle. Meanwhile, while taking care of Tommy 
in the mornings for Lisa, Mike is surprised 
by how much he enjoys the morning coffee 
dates with the other neighborhood moms, who 
welcome him immediately into their tight-knit 
group, and Ethan finds it difficult to break 
up with a girl after she makes a bold move.

Enjoy :)
