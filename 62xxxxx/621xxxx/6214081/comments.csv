Of the two NTSC ready versions available right now, this one is noticeably clearer.

,The OutLaw Torn,2011-03-03T15:14Z,"Wow.....this release is a BEAST. 100% retail, a full month before dvd release. DVD9 compressed to DV5 for burning onto dvd. Compression used was done very well. Looks as clear as a DVD9 on my 37"" Visio. Might I also mention that this DVD is UNTOUCHED. It is full retail with nothing removed from it. All menus and special features are included. EXTRA props for leaving the special features intact. Also, it's NTSC, Region 1. Video - 10, audio - 10. Sat down and had a few beers while watching it. Props to NLUPPER002 for posting it here, and props to DMT for providing it for us!"

,KhaosGT,2011-03-06T18:04Z,This File Was Flawless! Thank You
,arthaxerxes,2011-03-07T06:59Z,The size of the movie WITHOUT extras and with ONLY English 5.1 sound is 2276 MB. Isn't that a little off from normal 4300 MB DVD size?
,SlightlyCloser,2011-03-07T19:32Z,Where can i get english subtitles for this? (if there are any)
,djanbrok,2011-03-10T09:13Z,"@SlightlyCloser There's english subtitles.
Thanks for this! :D"
[T],480v,2011-03-11T13:55Z,"@ arthaxerxes

4300 MB is dvd5. Retail dvds that are truly untouched with everything intact (extras, etc.) should fit dvd9 (7900 MB)."
,arthaxerxes,2011-03-11T19:30Z,"@480v:

You're proving my point for me. Yes almost all DVDs nowadays are DVD9. But after cutting all extras and all 5.1 audio tracks except for English, the size (especially if it's claimed to have untouched Video) should not drop to around 2600 MB. Depend on the movie length, the right size varies but rarely below 4GB. This copy has 2 extra 5.1 audio tracks (each around 450 MB) and some extras so in order to fit on one DVD5 the video has to be shrunk even more. "
