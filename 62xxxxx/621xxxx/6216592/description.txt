Director JoÃ£o Batista de Andrade was filming a documentary about migrants coming from Northeast Brazil to SÃ£o Paulo in search of a better living. His intention was to give voice to these underprivileged and homeless people. While preparing to interview a man who lived under a bridge, a passer-by interfered, starting an argument about the role of people from other states in the development of SÃ£o Paulo and the rural problem in the Northeast.
