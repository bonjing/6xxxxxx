Â» Personal Comparison vs. ThinApp
I have been using ThinApp for years to make portable applications for 
myself and team. Never thinking twice, as VMware is the guru of virtualization.

Until a few weeks ago, i discovered 'Spoon Studio' formerly known as Xenocode.

Being an experienced user of ThinApp, i dove right into Spoon Studio. I was
amazed! Spoon Studio offers many more options, the portable apps created peform
better and faster with greater compatibility between OSes and architecture. In
addition, portable apps created with Spoon Studio are dramatically smaller in
size. Spoon Studio offers tons of tweaks, templates, tools, etc. 

Noob? no problem. Spoon Studio provides templates for a few common applications
to help you build your first portable application. 

Words cannot describe the shock i was in after trying and realizing Spoon Studio 
is far superior over ThinApp, it's not even close. Try it.. and you'll see!
