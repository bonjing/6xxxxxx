,NazstyNazG,2011-03-06T18:08Z,swelog as in the other comments im gettin same results using usb loader and configurable loader. can u sort it out as it seems the ps3 version u are also seeding does not work either also visited the swelog website impressive site but nothing on this game.must be a slip up as deblob 2 works flawlessly thats why im not giving u pure abuse. 
,itchy2011,2011-03-06T23:00Z,Works up to the point you start then it just locks on loading screen. Softmod wii BTW so dunno about mod chips but its the real deal !
,dfabian001,2011-03-09T01:21Z,"Doesn't work for shit!!!  This is a wasted download!!!  Will load through the UBIsoft Splash screen, but then locks up!     DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME    EITHER POST A FIX or DELETE THIS TORRENT@@@!!!!"
,e5frog,2011-03-11T14:48Z,"I agree, doesn't work. Have softmodded Wii and uLoader, got through settings and then it freezed on the loading screen.
If anyone at all manage to get this version running, please tell us how."

,azazeal90,2011-06-15T13:18Z,"THIS MIGHT HELP YOU FIX IT-------------------------

I used ""cIOSX_rev21"" and chose IOS 249. Then the ""IOS 58 v????"" and installed it on IOS 249. 

I used Mighty Loader v 15 to play. But this action made the USB Loader GX unable to start. 

Same with Coverfloader

IMPORTANT: if you do this fix you'll have to use Mighty Loader. "
