[V],raymondhome,2011-03-01T23:55Z,Rated PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence and brief mild language.

[V],.BONE.,2011-03-02T05:00Z,goes abit pixelated at the best action parts grab the 1.4gig its better :)
,nik666666,2011-03-02T05:50Z,FINALLY! thnx evo :)
,puppyup,2011-03-02T08:40Z,"Rip is very good for the average viewer.
A/V: 9/9.

Movie itself is a sensual feast, even though storyline and characters turn out to be a bit incomplete or not enough elaborated. However, it's really worth watching and the soundtrack is intriguing. I'm gonna see this in cinema. The special effects and set design are the best I've seen in years."
,epictroll,2011-03-02T09:43Z,"A 9
V 9

Unfortunately both characters die at the end.

Just kidding. Just watched the first 4 minutes and wanted to thank ray big time"

,UrInaTion,2011-03-02T15:47Z,Can Anyone tell me why after i have copied the popcorn crack into the movie file that no popcorn comes out. I am sick of this shit..i need to stick my dick in someones ear for believing in others..The Power Of Christ Compels You!..The Power Of Christ Compels You!
,-wkr-,2011-03-02T16:19Z,Thanks! 
,QborT,2011-03-02T16:27Z,Seriously the bitrate is far to low in this rip.  Making an 800mb rip of a 2+ hour movie is an epic fail on EVO's behalf.

Just out of curiosity, Why is 5 channel audio so hard to find?

Liked alot this movie. The rip is very good, the audio is a bit low, but is not a problem. The movie is simple story, but well done. The Daft Punk soundtrack dismiss comments."
