Installer is in russian but a little bit of common sense and selecting english when prompted works great.  I'd make sure to uninstall/completely close steam and/or uninstall your previous half life 2.  Thanks for the upload."
,johnmchall,2011-05-01T06:23Z,"works fine for me, except when i get past (SPOILER) The Head Crab Zombie stage, and i walk into the loading area, it goes to the starting screen. If this is because this is as far as the game i downloaded goes, i will be very upset because i know that the actual game goes much farther."
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-05-01T19:23Z,"@johnmchall
I need to confirm this. Wait for a while."
,johnmchall,2011-05-01T22:47Z,"well, after waiting two days, it loads the next area now. problem solved itself i guess."
,Mantas98,2011-05-05T17:01Z,when it installs so slowly(english version)?
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-05-07T10:48Z,"@Mantas98,
It depends on your PC configuration, but it should not be slow anyway."
,ust2,2011-05-08T10:11Z," Worked alright, fully english and nothing is ripped. 

 I only played about an hour so far, seems fine.

 Though I was a bit iffy on the bin's being unmountable and the forced .exe install only, but performed some scans, it was all clean and did it's job without any hassles (simply click and wait).

 Best of all NO STEAM! +1"
,nikolara,2011-07-02T18:19Z,"I installed the game, and as I start it, it seems as if its starting normally. But then something pops up saying the memory could not be ""read"". Help anybody? "
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-07-03T18:24Z,"@nikolara,
Be sure that you launch the game without Steam running. Also try to install Microsoft C++ Redist."
,CannabisKing,2011-07-09T00:17Z,"Before I download this could somebody give me a little insight on how I should run it?
I'm thinking add the bin files to a rar archive, mount the archive with damon tools lite and then run the exe? If I got all that horribly wrong please don't flame me lol. I'm new (n00b) to TPB I only want to dl this because my discs got destroyed and it's really hard to find a pc copy of hl2 where I live. Much appreciated."
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-07-26T15:19Z,"@CannabisKing,
No, you don't need to do anything with .bin's.
There's one .exe file (the smallest one). Run it and follow the instructions on your screen."
,xxpillowpantsxx,2011-08-04T02:43Z,"everytime i try to launch the game it says ""cannot create some of your include files hl2.exe continue? then i click yes and nothing happens pls help"
,Powermad8,2011-08-22T00:12Z,"I installed seemingly with no problems, but when I clicked the shortcut it said that it can't generate hl2.exe or something like that. Luckily I have an hl2.exe from my torrented copy of Portal, so I copied that in there. I froze and crashed at one of the loading screens where I'm in the hidden hallway with that girl. I'll see if I can fix it."
,dundun12,2012-03-10T03:41Z,Quick note: When you're going to play these no-steam games make sure you exit out of Steam FULLY. Or else it won't work. This happened to me with Garry's Mod No-Steam and it would not properly work without having to fully shut down steam.
,renatobr,2012-03-28T07:18Z,"i have a question , this is a updated source engine?

this is a updated version of half life 2?"
,gf_portal,2012-04-22T16:58Z,"I have Half life 2 already but there are no achievements.Tell me....Are there achievements?
In this torent ? "
,The_Reaper95,2012-05-18T12:26Z,"I haven't downloaded or installed yet (Obviously) but I don't really care if it's in russian or anything (I can't speak Russian) because I watch Anime I'm used to reading english subtitles whilst I cannot understand the language I am hearing, besides, I played Metro: 2033 like that because Russian people sound cool XD!"
