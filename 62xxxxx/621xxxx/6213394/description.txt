Plot

The Secret Sex Lives of Romeo and Juliet is the supreme archetypal Harry Novak soft-core sex comedy. It perfectly balances humor with humping, moderating the multiple mutual aardvarkings with Henny Youngman style jokes and blackouts. It is the film he strives to make every time he brings the bare together with the bawdy and the brainless. The result is something unique: a film that can be enjoyed both for its sexuality and its slick \'60s sense of humor.
