                   Din's Curse Demon War PC Standalone
                   -----------------------------------
        Din's Curse: Demon War is the first expansion for the unique
        action RPG Din's Curse. Din's Curse is a single player and co-op
        multiplayer action RPG for Windows and Mac PCs with 141 class
        combinations (196 with the expansion), infinite number of
        dynamically generated towns, real consequences, and a dynamic,
        evolving world. 

        The demons of Aleria are furious! After the 4th Great War and
        necromancer Ciglio's death, the undead horde has been causing
        utter chaos, attacking everything that moves... even demons.
        Demonkind were quite happy when Serina, a human city, was
        overrun, but that was before thousands of human zombies poured
        into Kraval, slaughtering the huge demon city. Thus began the
        Demon War. Demons of all kinds are fighting back. They're hunting
        down and killing any undead they find. Oh, and they blame the
        humans for this entire mess. For spite, they razed Serina to the
        ground even though it was already deserted.

        As a servant of the mighty Din, it's your responsibility to
        safeguard humans from danger. This was a hard task before. Do you
        have what it takes to save humankind from the Demon War?
