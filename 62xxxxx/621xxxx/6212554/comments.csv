But the movie starts out with black bars, then eventually fills the screen, the goes back and forth. Is this just the way the way they made the DVD since 2.35 aspect ratio monitors/TVs are barely in existence?"

,seanieboy78,2011-03-08T16:35Z,i got this from you it was one of the very few that took about three times the amount of  upload than download before i had it. which brings me to my point. how come is it i always hear people bitching about the length of time it takes to dl. sometimes i wait days for a film because i use a dongle and they lower my usage between 4pm and midnight if i use my huge fair usage of 3gb.lol which is about a day tops after i get it. but it allows unbelieveable amounts to be uploaded so i get about 10% of what i upload back. Who gives a fuck its free you can just leave it on overnight and mostly by morning its done (mostly?). anyway right now i have 8 films that are seeding and not one of them has 1 leech taking it. is their a notice board on this site? as i know this is random shit which has nothing to do with the film which by the way is about a 6. video and audio not so hot but like i say im not complainin g it was watchable if this was the one i dl'd.

Are you kidding me!?!?!?!  You sir should be banned from this site.
I had to post another comment when I saw that SHIT coming outa your mouth.  My surround sound system is around $300 and I play movies pretty damn loud, this torrent had no problems what so ever in audio.  MY suggestion to you would be getting a better home entertainment system, or to pay the ticket price at your local movie theater and save the rest of us from wanting to lynch your ass.  Second suggestion would be to fuk off.....THANK YOU extremezone for bring the ""GRATEFUL COMMUNITY"" another ""PERFECT"" and ""FREE"" movie.  "

,AllSaintsMEOW,2011-03-16T17:08Z,"Yes it's my opinion and I'm entitled to it. Most have given the audio a perfect 10, I am just saying that I did not find it flawless.

The ability to hear flaws does not depend on the cost of the sound system but the person hearing the sound.

The notes did say that they amplified the sound 300% more, which is likely where the minor but noticeable distortion came from.

I am sure 90%+ don't care about that, but a small few will appreciate me pointing that out.

And I don't mean to insult you just because you could not discern the flaw. I give respect to you and the releaser and everyone else here.

Peace!"

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

Are there any error codes?  I'd look into VLC for OSX.  I hear it's pretty good.  Anything else you need, shoot me an email:  alex4108@mailinator.com

BTW, Great torrent!"

in regard to your comment, i do not have a mac, but know that KMplayer and the K-lite Codec pack, is a good combination, i have virtually no problem with any of these torrent programs and im using a crap Hewlett Packard.

on another note, many of these Xvid dvdrips also are compatible on the playstation3 and xbox360 consoles via USB+FlashDrive"

,Brickstin,2011-05-07T23:26Z,Its a great Vid. except for the audio.. dude you amped the vol by 300%? Do you realize how distorted it sounds? I had to use a compressor just to minimize it. x.x If you need to increase vol it shouldf only by done by 25% not 300% The loud sounds get soo distorted including the parts of the explosions and corridors opening ect and motorcycles reving. It sounds horrible.

What a waste of two hours of my life.  I would highly suggest never watching this movie.  It is slow, doesnt make too much sense, and just pisses you off.  Hell they sit around the last half of the movie.."

A little lost - How can a program (code) move into the real world (like turn organic)/ the whole concept of the movie defies even the slightest logic!!!

Its like the 80's electric dreams (there a 8 bit computer falls in love and tries to kill a guy)- here its an ancient computer that hosts an entire self aware society WoW"

Well then you should just get off the fucking internet then. They post what they thought about the movie so that the downloaders can have an idea. If they hear ""movie is absolute shit"" about 100 times in the comment section, it would help any dim wit like you make a better decision and save the 1.5gb for something else. fucktard."
,showitoff,2012-03-25T18:23Z,JoeyJa your the stupid fucktard......what a great life you must have basing it all on what other people's opinions on something are.......20 people might not like the movie......i might.....so its worth the computer time.....not my time.....to download this and see if I like it!  All i want to see is if the video and audio are good.....not comments from some twat.....who lives by others peoples opinions!
