[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-02T06:29Z,im seeding but it takes a while to detect the peers sometimes because i seed all my low seeded torrents at 1kb too. don't worry though i upload around 250-500kb. the lowest is 250kb
,Doomext,2011-03-02T06:48Z,"Just tried it. Doesn't work properly, clearly a colour issue. I tried this on Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit. Either way i'll share till ther's 10 in Seed Swarm."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-02T07:04Z,"if u have an ati card, that's prolly why. im on win 7 64bit. 9gb ram, 1tb hd, nvidia geforce gtx 260 1.5gb vid ram, intel i7core cpu 920. so i'm pretty sure it's not a win 7 thing or a nvidia thing :)

might try using the compatibility options on the shortcut, tamper with those n im sure you'll get it looking perfectly."

Don't ask me how or why, but it works on many older games that suffer this issue!"

,LOG1Kpi,2011-06-10T16:26Z,"Damn I love this game! I remember playing it on my windows '98 :D Everything is working fine and I'm seeding, but...I remember there were movies (FMVs) in the game, they get skipped :( How can I see them???"
