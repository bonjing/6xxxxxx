DEATHTRAP DUNGEON:
The game is a third-person adventure, with the player taking the role of an adventurer (either the Amazon "Red Lotus" or the Barbarian "Chaindog"), who at the invitation of a wizard explores a series of dungeons and must overcome both monsters and traps to find riches.

Deathtrap Dungeon sends players into battle against more than 50 different monsters in this 3D action/combat title. Make your way through 10 dangerous 3D levels filled with mazes, corridors, dungeons, and traps while battling dragons, mummies, rats, and zombies. A variety of weapons are at the players disposal including a choice of swords, hammers, flame-throwers, muskets, and magical spells. Using these weapons it is up to you to do what many others failed to accomplish losing their lives in the process. You must find and destroy the great dragon Melkor and free the city of Fang from his terror.
