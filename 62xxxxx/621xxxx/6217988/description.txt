Amanda Rose The Game of Time - Wendy99

Amanda Rose is standing at the crumbling entrance to an abandoned mine. When she steps through the opening and into the darkness beyond, sheÃ¢Â€â„¢ll discover something incredible. Only a few days ago, she watched her father leave their home to go on a secret mission. A few hours later, she was searching the desert site where his plane had crashed for clues to his disappearance. And not long after that, a strange device threw her back in time. SheÃ¢Â€â„¢s helped the citizens of an Old Western town, met a wise Indian chief and made her way to the mine, which serves as the gateway to an amazing secret.

Will you guide Amanda through the breach? Are you brave enough to walk boldly with her into the unknown?
