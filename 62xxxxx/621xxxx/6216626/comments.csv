,scottsasse,2011-03-05T23:19Z,"Watching this movie was more difficult than munching on my own anus like an apple. For it is a real piece of shit. NO PLOT, the audio is horrible. Hell, I could make a better movie without even taking the lens-cap off the camera!! So.....if you like watching muslims killing innocent people and raping women while they're breast-feeding then move to Iraq. The movie's only saving grace is that Mo-Ham-Head ends up dying by barfing up pig blood on a white horse and ends up in hell being gang-raped by satan and saddam hussein!! Quentin Tarantino really lost my respect in helping make this dumbski movisky popular!!"

This is not a light weight flick. There is very little dialog and the cinematography is very well done.

This is not so much an ""artsy"" film - as it is a story of futility in the same aspect as ""The Kingdom"" but unlike the Kingdom, the plot and the ""message"" are delivered on a more artful level. Some people would want more dialog but the point is the limited level of communication, the futility of selfish survival, & some political issues surrounding the WoT.
This is NOT a childish ""shoot 'em up"" film."
,rtghrtyzx,2011-03-06T00:43Z,munching on my own anus like an apple........Every guy had this dream of giving a bj to himself but munching of his own anus like an apple? You must be truly hard core gay sick for even imagene that one. Munching......
,mininova_org,2011-03-06T02:47Z,pathetic camera work. not the uploaders fault though!
,orgnlchc,2011-03-06T12:54Z,"I agree with ""wierd-old-guy"". The movie was good and it actually was pretty artistic. I was watching it while I was high and it was absolutely amazing. The cinematography was flawless and the fact that the director made us 'get' what the character went through EVEN though he was a terrorist, judging by his actions, not by american propaganda. 

Of course, this movie is propaganda'ish but only because there is a lot of mistrust in governments of the world and their hypocratic actions. 
Do recommend it, though."

DONT DOWNLOAD!! WASTE OF TIME."

What a movie! Visually stunning and it really makes you think... what would you do if someone invaded your country, killed your wife and kids...

I think all who don't like the movie must live in the States or just not have any real taste in arty movies!

In my opinion this movie should have been on the shortlist for Best Director at the Oscars, Skolimowski's work far surpassed The King's Speech in directoral terms!


PS No subtitles are required for this movie, if 10 words are spoken the entire movie I may be exaggerating. To add to that it's amazing how the director speaks through his camera and scene selection."
,UNDER8ED,2011-03-15T01:49Z,"Watching this film is like a straight guy accidentally clicking on a porn link that started playing gay porn, and instead of shutting it off immediately you continue watching it in hopes of rubbing one out. Anyone who reads this comment and still decides to download and watch this film will be doing exactly what I described. I am not going to go play Russian Roulette with myself so I can get the time I wasted on this film back in my next life."
,tonym2112,2011-03-21T03:48Z,This movie is the most pointless waste of my time ever. I wish I had a do over!
,R2d6.51,2011-05-21T00:28Z,"FWIW

I''ll comment after seeing it, but the guy with the apple (scotttsasse)sounds like a depraved animal  of sorts whose credibility for anything remotely civilized can probably be seen in the Hyena & Baboon exhibits in any local zoo.

If Quentin Tarantino went so far as breaking single film awards to festival entries as a Judge at the Venice Film Festival to fight for giving it 2 awards; that's good enough for me to watch it because Tarantino's film genius is unquestionably light years beyond putting a mirror in our faces calling a spade a spade as anyone bold enough to walk that ground with a camera rolling ever has in human history."
,thewaymouth,2011-06-04T20:41Z,Essential viewing.
,netrek,2011-06-07T10:51Z,"Total crap! Islamist propaganda.

What is this the Al Qaeda Film Festival? We are supposed to sympathize and care for a cold blooded murderer who kills 3 American soldiers?! WTF! The soldiers were trying to liberate Afghanistan from assholes like the Taliban main character who would have all people there living under Sharia Law and under 7th century barbaric oppression where women and religious minorities (Jews, Christians, Zoroastians) are treated like second class citizens and falsely imprisoned, raped and murdered. F*UCK this movie, F*UCK the director, F*UCK anyone who worked on this Islamist propaganda piece of crap. It's sad how deluded liberals are. They will actually hand the sword to the Jihadists so they can cut their own throats! WAKE UP YOU MORONS! 

Whole plot: some scenes to portray America as the Great Satan and Jihadists as innocent victims, unrealistic escape from prison in Poland, a bunch of senseless murders of innocent people, rape, Taliban guy finally is killed. 

People who like this film are probably the sort of pseudo-intellectual liberals who gush over Roman Polanski and thinks he's not a pedophile! 

Those defending this steaming pile of shit just goes to show how dangerous and stupid the philosophy of moral relativism is. You're spouting exactly what the Jihadists want you to think! ""Hey he came to our country so we're allowed to kill him!"" Funny how you can throw the context out so easily. This guy may not have been a hardcore fighter, but by  going along with the Taliban he gave tacit approval to their barbaric acts of terrorism. This is precisely how terrorism thrives, it can't exist in a vacuum, so-called ""moderates"" give it material support. No there is such a thing as evil and what the Taliban has done to Afghanistan is truly evil. And anyone liberating the country is not terrorists unless one has the mental illness of liberalism which makes rational analysis impossible.

We're supposed to believe his individual ""right to survive"" trumps the rights of all these people to survive! High idiocy.

Postmodern nihilistic, the most banal sort of arthouse deceptive intellectually dishonest shit! 

Skolimowski must have been inspired after watching the equally shitty film ""Kingdom of Heaven"" where the Muslims are portrayed as enlightened peace lovers and the European Christians as barbaric, savage, imperialist warmongers on a blood lust! 

Some idiots here will sympathize with the main character and say he's just trying to survive in tough conditions, but I can easily find hundreds of millions of counter-examples in history where people found themselves in MUCH harsher conditions than the main character in this film did (Even permanent conditions which they spend their ENTIRE lives enduring!) and 99.99% of them did not resort to such barbaric and evil acts as he did and kill tons of innocent people! 

If one wants ample evidence of crimes against humanity they need only survey the recent and distant history of most Muslim countries! They will find no shortage of genocide, forced conversions, raping, false imprisonment, destruction of churches, institutional racism, etc. 
Rendition of terrorist scum whose goal is to kill as many innocent people as they can is hardly a crime against humanity! Only if you are a moronic liberal would you think that. We are in a game with the very highest stakes, this is not a Utopian world and sometimes you must do unpopular and even mean things to protect the many from the evil few. The Jihadists have NO moral or legal strictures on them. If the liberals in the EU can't live with capturing and interrogating Jihadist scum then we the US have to pick up the slack for the good of even the EU! Sometimes following the letter of the law is immoral. But no, in the liberal binary, moral calculus you must treat terrorist scum who want to literally destroy Western civilization and usher in a global Islamic Caliphate with every possible legal right! FUCK THAT! Europe now has a huge problem with homegrown terrorism thanks to the foolish liberal policies that welc"
,netrek,2011-06-07T10:55Z,"(got cut off)

Europe now has a huge problem with homegrown terrorism thanks to the foolish liberal policies that welcomes tens of millions of Muslim immigrants into Europe. They do not want to assimilate into the prevailing culture, they want to follow oppressive Sharia Law, and now they have the luxury and privilege of being able to use our liberal democratic laws against us as they sit in their council subsidized flats while living on the dole and plot terrorist acts from the heart of Europe! It's no wonder the huge attacks in England and Spain happened from Muslim citizens of their own countries. If they had stayed in Jordan or Saudi Arabia it would have been much harder for them to successfully carry out their attacks because the intelligence services and laws in those countries are much harsher and much more effective! But it may be too late for Europe, they welcomed the Trojan Horse into their midst and it sure isn't going anywhere!

And for those of you gushing over Tarantino you really have a bad understanding of what makes great films. His movies are so uninspired, so cliched and are just works of homage with nothing truly original. He picks and chooses the most sensationalistic or obvious elements from various genres and mixes them all together. I have more respect for a 12 year old who makes their own film ans uses creativity and original thought!"

First they get an Italian to play the Afghani Muslim; they put the ugly wife of that jew child rapist Polanski in it; and they make no mention of the hypocrisy of the USA invading and occupying a country and then putting people on trial for fighting back!!!
