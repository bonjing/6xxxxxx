Thanks :)"
[T],PeteSapai,2011-03-01T20:09Z,"I prefer VBR (most people who claim 320k sounds better than LAME -V0, or even V2, haven't done an ABX test to find out they're wrong), but 320k still is 100x better than 128k. Nice work (as usual)!"
,DrizzyDeniz,2011-03-01T20:34Z,OMG!.. fuck you SW i hate u. fake gangster. and willow is tha bomb. ure freakin 3OH!3 sucks... Im older than u and u want to make friends with jainmehul because u has no friends... ;) stfu anyway jainmehul is the best and u sucks.

,idontcare007,2011-03-02T18:11Z,Kayse ho Mehul? :P
,daba_1,2011-03-02T19:02Z,"Thanks for upload and quality. For other people information Japanese and German pressings are the best. A lot of times Japanese releases will have an extra track that is not released elsewhere. Especially on vinyl rips.
Green Skull well deserved!!! :P)"
,ernie_25,2011-03-02T22:48Z,good work :) gunna seed for 1 week
,queener666,2011-03-03T00:27Z,"highest quality vbr is best imo. vbr just calculates when the low density sound can be carried by lower bitrates and leaves bitspace for the ""noisy"" parts so that quality isn't compromised (of course it's still lossy as long as it is not flac codec) and the filesize would be much lower than 320cbr. I didn't get any difference between vbr and cbr through my experience. Except 128kbs. Very interesting thing about bitrates is, if the ripper knows what is he doing, even 128 kbits would be sufficent in some cases. This is a very rare thing these days. But it reminds me that bitrates isn't everything."
,kerrycherry,2011-03-03T05:45Z,"My own 2 cents, I prefer FLAC, since it's easy to convert into lossless and then from there, to any compressed version I prefer. I don't really download 320 anymore, unless there's absolutely no other choice."
,elucider,2011-03-05T10:04Z,"awesome work jainmehul, but could you plz upload this album in FLAC..really looking forward to that! thanks...and keep on delivering the good stuff!!!..:)"

,Tiffany1567,2011-05-02T04:22Z,Don't Download this torrent!!  Unless you what to be tracked!! Beware.
,Paranoia187,2011-05-09T22:07Z,There is no file called Extras.rar so I think the people posting above me work for the recording company
