,privatco,2011-03-04T01:12Z,Svensk (Swidesh) subtitle plz! where can i find it plz if there is som can tell me?
,SynapsisXXXX,2011-03-04T06:08Z,"what is this?? I mean i admire LTT very much and all that.... but look at the size!!! Its just a LITTLE too less for a single layer dvd, and too small for a dual layer dvd! 120mb less and it would hav fitted in a single layer dvd! the loss in quality would have been virtually negligible!"
,sawwei,2011-03-04T10:02Z,"SynapsisXXXX, I find it amazing that ltt99 was kind enough to share this movie 4 FREE !!!
Yet, you can only moan and complain, while you don't contribute anything. It's people like you that pisses me off. If you don't like the file, don't download it...or better yet, buy the original Blu-ray and stop complaining."
,de_spijker,2011-03-04T16:23Z,thx ltt99.
,SynapsisXXXX,2011-03-05T03:41Z,"sawwei - and the world has it's fair share of people like you, who don't do anything useful either, and yet have this supreme wisdom to stick their nose up someone's ass and offer them advice that they are themselves incapable of following.. listen dude, opinions can either be good, or they can be bad, and if you can't appreciate that then you should learn that from wherever you haven't learnt that from."
,moshster,2011-03-05T21:46Z,"Something not right with this file.  When streaming to PS3 the audio is fine, but no video even though the PS3 is showing video bitrate."
,mischiefmaker,2011-03-06T12:37Z,"This video works for me, but every few seconds there's a black bar on the left side that continually expands and shrinks.

How come there's a difference in aspect ratio between this torrent and the other 1080p? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6211105/Tangled_2010_BluRay_1080p_DTS_x264-CHD_BOZX

Thanks"
,mischiefmaker,2011-03-06T15:47Z,"Hm, to add to my previous comment I think this is a resized and re-encoded version of Tangled 2010 BluRay 1080p DTS x264-CHD BOZX "
,Spree2009,2011-03-07T17:39Z,"@mischiefmaker 
The one you linked is a re-encoded version and there for you have black sides when you play it in powerdvd 10 or media player 11"
,zero_kull,2011-03-09T04:43Z,I need the fucking Spanish subtitles lol xD
,est1987,2011-03-18T14:35Z,Subtitles can be found at subscene.com folks.
