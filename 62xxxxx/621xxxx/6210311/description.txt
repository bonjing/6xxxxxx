A mysterious, lethal disease is on the loose worldwide, resulting in a catastrophic death rate of humanity, and the increasing rise of attacks, caused by the living dead. In Japan, several high school students and a school nurse have banded together to escape Fujimi High School shortly after it was attacked by zombies. The group now attempts to figure who or what was responsible for this plague, and in the meantime, attempt to survive the present apocalypse.

Bonus Notes



I was asked why I encoded so
Answered.
I made them this way so PPL with lower end cpu & gpu, small hard drives, slow internet connections, and bandwidth caps could enjoy a hi resolution experience without suffering for it and still look good on the hi end side.

I Re-encoded for HQ Video & Low file size (yes) = more space, more video storage
(try it You'll like it)

For the mkv haters out there, mkv is not your problem, it's what they may contain. the subs in this one will kill ya, Sorry not planning to hard code at this time so you have to look elsewhere.
P.S. vol 5-6 changed the sub provider to a more player friendly group

Plays in my
VLC .... Ver 1.1.4 internal codecs
Media Player Classic & Zoom Players
With K-lite codec pak http://www.codecguide.com/
