Savage Garden
Affirmation (1999)


Australian pop duo Savage Garden have taken the world by storm without the record company hype and career-establishing game plan that is often the background for pop-oriented acts.

Daniel Jones comes from a long line of musicians. When he was ten, he was already playing the keyboard and drums in bars and hotels. Darren Hayes' show business experience extended no further than his involvement in many school plays. When Jones and the band he'd started with his brothers advertised for a singer, the inexperienced but enthusiastic Hayes was the only hopeful to answer. He wasn't what was needed for a covers band playing the Gold Coast resort area of Queensland, but Hayes inspired a different flame in Jones and the pair broke away to start writing original songs.
