[V],twentyforty,2011-03-01T12:52Z,@ogeth: Thanks. We both answered three minutes apart and TPB needs up to 45 minutes to sort comments out and make them visible.
,banukaknight,2011-03-01T13:12Z,try to make some time for doing NARNIA triology pack like you did for Arther.. plzzz
,hardik_860,2011-03-01T13:40Z,"@ogeth  : thanks  4 helping .................
@twentyforty: thanks 4 uploading......"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-01T14:10Z,@hardik_860: Uploading is piece of cake. 2-pass encoding of 2h40 event is painfully slow. But I got human acceptable size of 450MB instead of 2200MB for XviD (what most cannot afford at all).

I absolutely loved 'Me and You and Everyone We Know' by the way - such a gorgeous movie! Thanks so much for the (brilliant quality )upload - seriously, it looked stunning and I really, really appreciate it."
