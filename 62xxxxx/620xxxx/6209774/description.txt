His only hope may be Orlando, a woman from his past who\'s reluctant to help but who may hold the key to solving the case. Suddenly the two are prying into old crimes, crisscrossing continents, struggling to stay alive long enough to unbury the truth. But as the hunt intensifies, Quinn is stunned by what he uncovers: a chilling secret . . . and a brilliantly orchestrated conspiracyÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥with an almost unimaginable goal.

Furiously paced, filled with superbly drawn characters and pitch-perfect dialogue, The Cleaner puts a powerful twist on all our expectations as it confirms Brett Battles\' place as one of the most exciting new talents in suspense fiction today.

I couldn\'t find a pdf of this great book anywhere, so once I finally found a txt doc while trolling I felt I should upload for your reading pleasure :)

Make sure to check out the following two installments in the Jonathan Quinn series: The Deceived and Shadow of Betrayal. The fourth installment entitled The Silenced will be released on April 5, 2011.

If you enjoy Brett Battles\' novels, please purchase them. I personally own all three installments and will be picking the fourth up the day it hits shelves. For convenience sake though, it is nice to have a pdf you can read on your phone or e-reader :D
