,CainUAC23,2011-03-02T00:38Z,"it says ENGLISH, what it doesn't say is that its BOTH english and japanese at the same time, i played it on VLC media player, no audio track selection, just both english and japanese spoken simultaneously, this movie is also broken into two halves, and quite honestly, un watchable, the instructions were just a rant about who its from.  Thanks but no thanks."
,spratman,2011-03-11T00:58Z,"Ignore the other comment, that's the way the intro begins. Audio is Japan only. For subtitles in SRT format: http://subscene.com/english/Summer-Wars-Sam-wzu/subtitle-417235.aspx"
,max_planck_no_1,2011-04-16T13:51Z,"Can someone post quality, audio (is it dual audio?)?

You guys suck at making comments. Help us out!"
,whatariot34,2011-04-18T11:28Z,"spratman is right. The intro is unique in the way it is done - It's about an mmo for people around the world, and it has an echo in english that is done intentionally - as in for EFFECT.

The movie itself is in japanese - keep watching and you'll see.

spratman has posted the subtitles, downloadable from an alternate website. I had thought they were already on there, but as for how to install them - not sure on the difference between .srt files and .idx"

,Osmodivs,2011-06-14T20:37Z,"Subs DO NOT work, VLC sends me an error saying it DOES NOT recognizes that kind of extension.
I had to search for subtitles somewhere else, I found some .ass file extension that DID work, but I could only found the CD1 subs, I'm still missing the CD2 subs, does anyone knows where to find them?"

,Tecanuva,2012-01-08T10:10Z,"I like how you clearly labelled your files and didn't just put them as ""CD1"" and ""CD2""...oh wait, you did. Then in the instructions it was just a circle jerk of links from where you downloaded it. -1, eat a dick"
