Never seen TV Team do it before, yes, it happens.

They can't really do much 'cept reup and delete this one, so there's no point in anybody hanging on this torrent, it's gong nowhere.

The 34 peers showing as waiting for it, may as well delete from client, as this dog ain't huntin'.

TV Team will have to redo torrent with .avi instead of empty Rar file from encoder release.

In case they don't do so, haven't done so yet and think they've just moved on.

The 745.92MB Rar'd versions from Scene.line and balance etc are here...

As too the MP4 versions

Choose another torrent, TV Team may not notice the error for a while if at all.

Peace. : )"
