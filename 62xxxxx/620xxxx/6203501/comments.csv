Can you find any interesting books regarding ''paper models''?
I have already found plenty on Net and also on Piratebay but I was wandering if with your ''connections'' you could find something more recent, possibly regarding Modern Architecture and airplanes.
Thank you again for all your usefull uploads.
Best regards."
