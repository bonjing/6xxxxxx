Abstract

Mouse and keyboard have been traditional interfaces to a computer. A real problem is faced by people with certain disabilities while making use of the mouse. Providing relief to people suffering from paraplegia, quadriplegia etc while they make use of the computer is a major aim of the project. Replacing the mouse as a pointing device is a possible solution to the same.

The proposed approach to answer this problem is to provide a tool to navigate the computer User Interface (UI); similar in functionality to a mouse. 

The process of locating a moving object in time using a camera is called Video tracking. 

Pointer movement is achieved by tracking the motion of the head using a webcam. An algorithm analyses the video frames and outputs the location of moving targets within the video frame. 

The foremost aim is to provide users with disabilities with a tool that can ease their interaction with a computer and also, decreases their dependence on traditional pointing devices. Using this as a device to handle mouse pointer movement can also give users freedom from stress injuries caused due to continuous usage of the mouse.

Many programs are available in the market with a similar aim of providing users a hand-free pointer-moving facility, but they are costly alternatives to address the problem. The proposed program is especially attractive because of the fact that it can provide a low-cost means of human-computer interaction requiring the most basic of computer hardware. Cost cutting can be achieved by making use of complete Open Source development tools in the making of the proposed motion tracking software."

Well this torrent was only a way of getting this file transferred to me (It was on my home pc, I don't live there anymore) hence it required no description. But before I knew it, it had a some downloads so I thought why not ask for feedback while at it.
