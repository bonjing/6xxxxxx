[T],Coolguy33,2011-03-02T12:08Z,"I appreciate and am overwhelmed that SEGA have finaly decided to release this officially. However, why in the hell did they give us 4 games, i mean they run great and all but to be honest they suck ass.....Crazy Taxi is probably the best out the bunch and even that gets lame after a while. The Dreamcast had many great games (Mavel vs Capcom 1 & 2, R.E. Code Veronica, Blue Stinger, Daytona, House Of Dead 2, Power Stone, SoulCalibur etc) and the one game that made me get a Dreamcast in the first place.......Shenmue!!!  :)
What are SEGA playin at and why in the heck didn't they release these games man. Maybe they are seeing how well this collection will do and will make a Vol 2. If they do they should put a better load of games on the disc. Guess i shouldn't complain, it's a start at least anyway. lol"
