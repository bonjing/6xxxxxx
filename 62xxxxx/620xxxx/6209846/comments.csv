Systems do not differ a lot of files. Basically, all the files are identical. You can simply create a link, rather than duplicate file. Use the -o option in CDIMAGE, or the option to ""optimize"" in UltraISO.

Thanks."
,Evilbones76,2011-08-11T16:11Z,"Ok, so you actually uploaded another copy WITH cd key?

Why the hell didn't you say?  So people do not bother downloading this one??

Thanks for your efforts, indeed.  But please be a bit more clearer.
