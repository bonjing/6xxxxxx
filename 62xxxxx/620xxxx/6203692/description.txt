          * This is my first R5 release. I actually played around      
            with my script and did some changes. The results came      
            out very good which makes this release looks like the      
            source used was retail. Thanks to T0XiC-iNK for the        
            audio, it synced perfectly with this release. By far,      
            the best quality you can get from an xvid encode.          
                                                                       
          * Special filters used which takes a lot of time to encode.  
            For those who wait knows what they're getting and we       
            do not disappoint.                                         
                                                                       
          * Colors, brightness and contrast untouched same as source.  
            (We do not touch source to preserve the picture the way    
             it was intended to be shown.)
