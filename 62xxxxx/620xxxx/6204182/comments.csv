,edroonieoffice,2011-02-27T15:27Z,"I am still hoping that somebody will upload the old Larry Cohen classic ""Full Moon High (1981)"" (in original English). I have seen it many places but always in other languages for some reason."
,Night_89,2011-03-01T03:14Z,thanks
,ofpirate,2011-03-09T23:29Z,there appears to be a problem with video encoding on this... playback is choppy/skippy (w/MPCHC)
,ofpirate,2011-03-11T21:41Z,"quick update to my previous post - i repackaged my original copy of this release in a new MKV, however it seem to resolve the choppy playback. finally, I just downed a new copy, which seems to be better... strange, ESIR releases are usually so sweet... but this is the second time that Ive encountered one that worked fine when I first got it, and became unstable later on."
