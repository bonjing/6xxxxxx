,mkvluv,2011-03-03T03:49Z,why is the file size so weird on this? can't we keep it at dvd5 size? thanks
,ps3_4_eva,2011-03-03T21:26Z,"mkvluv: watch it, listen to it. you'll thank him later"
,-Cortex-,2011-03-04T23:20Z,"@mkvluv - It's 4/3 DVD5, new rules allow encodes in multiples of 1/3 DVD5, instead of DVD5; 1.5 DVD5 and DVD9.

This would only fit on DVD5 if DTS was removed, everyone loves DTS!

@HOT_SNAKES - Anyone who doesn't understand the difference between ""your"" and ""you're"" is a moron (read: you're a moron)."
,s0mnambul1st,2011-03-07T02:47Z,"Guys, I need help.  I watch videos on my PS3.  I unmux the mkv file using mkv2vob software.  But recently, most mkv files are unwatchable on PS3.  On the PS3 menu, the preview icon shows the movie but when I start to watch, it doesn't play.  No error message whatsoever.  Please help."

Re playing on a PS3 have you tried the device player on Vuse once you link your PS3 and pc together - Vuse finds all my devices, PSP, XBOX 360, Sony TV etc - works for me - except on the odd occasion when it grabs the wrong soundtrack on an mkv file - anyone know a fix for that by the way? Alternatively have you tried ""4videosoft MKV converter"" - very powerful pretty much any format to any format as well as a ton of handy and saved settings to short cut everything specific for popular things like IPODs PS3s XBOXes, etc. Happy days....."
