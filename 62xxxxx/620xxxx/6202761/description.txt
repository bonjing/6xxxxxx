Whatever you do, PLEASE have an open mind when going through this book and realize that some of what you are going to read goes directly against a lot of what you hear in the mass media and from many other outlets of fitness information. The problem is that many of these so called â€œexpertsâ€ you see in the media and in all the advertisements really know NOTHING about true health/fitness, they are simply trying to force you to buy their latest gimmick or fad product or supplement they are selling.
With this program, weâ€™re going to cut right through all of the crap, and give you the straight honest answers about exactly what is needed to get a truly lean and healthy body and keep that for the rest of your life (and of course get those six pack abs that everybody wants!).
Everything you will read in this manual comes from years of sound research as well as hands-on experience with thousands of my clients for both exercise strategies and nutrition strategies. The bottom line is that THIS STUFF WORKS time and time again, as proven by thousands of my customers who write in all the time telling me about the tremendous changes theyâ€™re seeing in their bodies after adopting my style of training and nutrition.
However, keep in mind that it will only work if you actually apply the information!
