This e-book is a tool kit for your mind. On its own, a screwdriver will only help you in a small way. Although it can be very useful, there are only a few jobs that you can use it for. When, however, you use this screwdriver as part of a complete tool kit, the range of options open to you is enormous. A craftsman with a good tool kit can make many different, useful things.

Similarly, individual thinking skills used on their own may help you in a small way. When, however, you use many different thinking skills together, your ability to solve problems increases significantly. Mind Tools is a tool kit of thinking techniques. This e-book is divided into two parts. The first part covers techniques that will help you to develop your skills as a business thinker and make you more productive. This begins with individual sections that cover the time and stress management skills you will need as you become increasingly successful. They explain how to control and dissipate the pressures that will build around you. These tools will help you to live a happy life as well as a highly successful one.......................
