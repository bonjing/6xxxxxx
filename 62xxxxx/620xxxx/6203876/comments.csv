,superscot81,2011-02-27T14:03Z,There are no english subtitles for the quite extensive french speaking parts of the movie.
[V],neon,2011-02-27T16:58Z,theres a sub pack in the info files :)
,superscot81,2011-02-28T03:35Z,"Okay. I see that. However, I'm in my 60's and most tech stuff goes over my head. Can anyone give me here or refer me to a step by step idiots guide to get the subtitles to work. How do the subtitles get into the movie from a separate file?"

,doydot,2011-02-28T16:15Z,"Thx for upload neonrainbow. 
A=10 
V=10. 
I am also having trouble with subtitles. I even tried in VLC player (Media=>Advanced Open File=>File Selection=>Add-then added the movie.
Checked-Use a subtitles file=>Browse-added .SUB file and later tried it with .IND file aswell, but still no luck.
I've downloaded a lot of yours before with subs and haven't had any problems. This was my first time manually trying to add them. I am doing something wrong?"

,uStoopidShit,2011-03-13T16:40Z,"Subtites dont work, atleast on MAC; I had to download subtitles from another upload on Btjunkie, I dont have a link but the file name is Hereafter[2010]DVDRip XviD-ExtraTorrentRG.sub I let opened this .AVI file in VLC and then Video>subtitle>choose file>Hereafter[2010]DVDRip XviD-ExtraTorrentRG.sub ; Worked like a charm

Noir, next time you upload a file try to get working subtitles. Thanks."
