Book Description
================
The only hardcover edition of Roald Dahlâ€™s stories for adults, the Collected 
Stories amply showcases his singular gifts as a fabulist and a born 
storyteller.

Later known for his immortal childrenâ€™s books, including Charlie and 
the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, and The BFG, Dahl 
also had a genius for adult short fiction, which he wrote throughout 
his life. Whether fictionalizing his dramatic exploits as a Royal Air 
Force pilot during World War II or concocting the ingeniously plotted 
fables that were dramatized on television as Tales of the Unexpected, 
Dahl was brilliant at provoking in his readers the overwhelming desire 
to know what happens nextâ€”and at satisfying that desire in ways that 
feel both surprising and inevitable.

Filled with devilish plot twists, his tales display a tantalizing blend 
of macabre humor and the absurdly grotesque. From â€œThe Landlady,â€ about 
an unusual boardinghouse that features a small but very permanent clientele, 
to â€œPig,â€ a brutally funny look at vegetarianism, to â€œMan from the South,â€ 
in which a fanatical gambler does his betting with hammer, nails, and 
a butcherâ€™s knife, Dahlâ€™s creations amuse and shock us in equal measure, 
gleefully reminding us of what might lurk beneath the surface of the 
ordinary.
