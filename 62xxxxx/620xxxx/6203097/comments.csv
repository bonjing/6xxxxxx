[ www.torrentday.com ]

Lets add a useless nfo file telling everyone about TD.com
How about a bullshit readme file with the same TD.com info
Dont forget the torrentday file with TD.com info

what the #### is next, full screen adverts?
A request for money?

And last but not least the sample file, on a 350Meg tv show.
Does this mean with all that advertising, torrentday has gone from quality to crappy?

Here is an idea, why dont you edit the movie file, and put YOUR ads in there. That way people will know all about you."
