,calinet6,2011-03-01T00:55Z,"Did you all get all files downloaded? I assume you know what FLAC is, but for the benefit of a doubt, it's a lossless format (full CD quality). Read more about how to play it here: http://flac.sourceforge.net/documentation_tasks.html

Also this is my first uploaded torrent, so I could have done something wrong, if you can't open the .torrent let me know."

thanks a lot for this sounds nice..

unfortunately the reason you're having problems is you never used any trackers so I've uploaded it again here for you you will have to download it again because the hash has changed..:)
