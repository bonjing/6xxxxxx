I'm kind of new to this whole ""sharing"" thing, but people obviously don't care about their audio sounding anything more than hissing compressed crap. This is NOT a proper 320, and the uploader tagged every track with his website or something, which is totally annoying. Tagging the image is stupid too, but easily fixed. But removing your goddamned ""songslover"" website from every track, and then having to reorder all the tracks because the metadata isn't there, you fail big time, so you get a nice uncivil message from me. Not seeding, let this one die."

,queener666,2011-02-28T04:55Z,"thanks for warning.

Re-encoders suck."
,volcomhackzor,2011-03-08T19:49Z,"confirmed, its a re-encode. total waste of time, go download another release of the same size and it'll be TRUE 320kbps, not crap KBPS. 
@love555, do you know how to upload torrents?"
