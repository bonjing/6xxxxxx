My favourite TV-program.
Have seen most episodes but not close to all Specials...will try to DL and see what speed I can get.
Once again, thanks for this!!"

Many thanks for this collection. I haven't watched many of these eps but do enjoy them when I get round to it."

,twistles,2011-03-17T17:23Z,"Just checked this, and its now 29%!  Verrry slow, despite being, I think, a demonoid release.

I'm going to upload an even bigger torrent on TPB only, which I collated as a megapack for a private tracker.  Will include all material including series spinoffs [Digs/HH/PBS etc] to 2010 (excluding pilots and dvd-only specials).  "
,twistles,2011-03-17T19:03Z,"As promised :

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6250365

17 Series (inc 2 with extras), 8 Live Series, all specials, 3 spinoff series and some publications and reports, to 2010.

Feel free to grab just chunks from mine to help this torrent here along faster: there is likely to be a significant overlap of data [spot this by comparing file sizes], though renaming will be needed.  Mine should, at least, be fast! :)

This may seem like a torrent hijack.  I suppose it is, in a way, and for that I should apologise.  But I do feel it is somewhat justified as this isn't actually a TPB release (many of the listed seeders will have picked this up elsewhere), and because this torrent would take many months to complete at the current apparent rate."
