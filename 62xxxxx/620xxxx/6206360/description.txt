On August 20, 1982 Sinatra gave a concert together with the Buddy Rich Orchestra 
at the picturesquely situated Altos De Chavon Amphitheatre at the Dominican Republic.

A felicitous and diversified setlist, a mixture of old hits and new hymns was picked for the audience and a few gems were added, like â€œI Wonâ€™t Danceâ€ or the magnificent â€œSearchingâ€ â€“ which he didnâ€™t sing too often in concert.
