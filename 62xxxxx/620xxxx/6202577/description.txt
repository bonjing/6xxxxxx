In June of 1982, Queen was at the height of its powers as one of Britain's best rock bands when the played a concert at the MK Bowl in Milton Keynes, not far from London. As one of the group's increasingly rare shows in England, the concert was filmed for British television, but never aired in its entirety. Queen: On Fire at the Bowl presents the legendary Milton Keynes show in full, with remastered visuals and the sound remixed in surround stereo from the original 24-track audio recordings.
