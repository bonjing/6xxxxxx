It supports up to 16 connected controllers simultaneously for multiplayer action, and includes rumble-force feedback with fine-tuning options. This software also works with ANY other pc controller including racing wheels, dance mats, drum kits and guitars!

This software package is the most recent November 17th, 2010 update and includes 125 controller images (to easier set up button mapping), 86 controller profiles (from many popular PC game titles) and 92 themes for the app itself!
