,shravanm,2011-03-05T04:36Z,please seed.....or make 99 available once again...
,bennbones,2011-03-07T11:00Z,having problems watching anything on my xbox past the first 5 or so episodes.. might just be me so ill dL it again and cross my fingers that it worked. everthing else you have uploaded has been awesome! 1998 worked like a charm! i hope its just  me!!!!
,wazz000,2011-03-07T13:24Z,"@ Bennbones. I can confirm most of the eps from raw 1999 don't work on xbox 360. No need to redownload. Jus watch all raw 1999 eps on ps3 or pc/laptop or burn episodes on DVD using convertxtodvd (4-5 eps shud fit on one DVD)

hope that helps buddy :D"
,bennbones,2011-03-08T03:38Z,"thanks for the advice thats super helpful i dLed them for my boyfriend and myself, last night we tried to watch a couple more eps it didnt workit was starting to drive me crazy! All the eps from 1998 worked do you know why 1999 went on the fritz? Thanks again though :)"
,wazz000,2011-03-08T14:22Z,"@ bennbones

Well the person who ripped all wwf raw 1999 eps used a diff codec. Thats y the wwf raw 1999 eps dont work on xbox 360

No need go crazy for such little things buddy :D

Like i said theres tons of ways to watch avi files

Heres few examples of Devices/Players/Machines that will play avi files perfectly :D

1: ps3 Playstation 3

2: http://www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/17249318/Western-Digital-Elements-Play-2TB-Media-Player/Product.html?searchtype=allproducts&searchsource=0&searchstring=western+digital&urlrefer=search

^^ I bought this device few weeks ago ^^. Its really good. It has 2TB Internal harddrive. It also has a usb slot. so u can plug in external hardrives or usb sticks. Jus plug in ur tv and watch



3: Burn the eps on dvd using convertxtodvd (4-5 eps shud fit on one disc) then play dvd in any dvd player

4: Watch on ur pc or laptop LOL


I can confirm all wwf raw 1999 eps work on Ps3 Playsation 3 and Western Digital Elements Play 2TB Media Player

Good luck bennbones :D"
