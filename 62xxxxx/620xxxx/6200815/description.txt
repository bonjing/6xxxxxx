"TGS Hates Women"

When a blog accuses TGS of being misogynistic, 
Liz hires an upcoming female comedian, Abby 
Flynn (guest star Cristin Milioti). Liz's 
plan backfires when Abby seems to be falling 
into female stereotypes, and Liz and Jenna 
decide to put Abby in her place. Meanwhile, 
Jack Donaghy intends to become the successor 
to KableTown but can only achieve this by 
eliminating the competition, the 
granddaughter to the CEO, Kaylie Hooper (guest 
star Moretz).

Enjoy :)
