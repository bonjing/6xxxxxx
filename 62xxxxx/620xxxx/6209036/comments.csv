,spingo_80,2011-03-05T10:12Z,Here's an idea! download the film. then here's the best part.- upload the same amount you have downloaded!!! then stop sharing if you wish. too many greedy fucking thiefs are not seeding.
,mugginsville2000,2011-03-05T23:28Z,so im a total newb and was wondering how i seed after a download is done.  if i delete the torrent from my library but i keep the files in the directory they download to will it still seed the file?  any help would be much appreciated
,mc_homes,2011-03-06T13:29Z,"@muggins, no that wont work.  you need to keep both the torrent and the files you downloaded.  basically after the torrent has finished you just keep it running in your bittorrent program."

why does Wahlberg keep getting roles? he just can't ever act. he plays the same character over and over again. just no ability i guess.

Bale was awesome in the film and played a role never seen before. 

amy adams was super as always. 

overall i didn't care for the film do to wahlbergs attempt of acting. "

================================= Â«Â« ENGLISH Â»Â» ==================================


Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

,2manydoobies,2011-04-30T18:55Z,"Apparently alot of people have been receiving notifications that they've ""illegally"" obtained this movie from their providers, so giving that i probably will avoid downloading this movie.
but if im on my buddies wifi should i still download it and let him have a chance of getting the letter? Or will paramount somehow contact my house instead of my buddys? 
even if you are warned of downloading movies by your service provider... what can happen? and do different penalties apply to canadians or perhaps NOT apply?"

I used Sharaza. Uninstalled that and called Cox, I told them I uninstalled the program and they said okay. The CSR told me that Cox doesn't give companies  account info because it's private and the only way that they would submit it is under a court order. I asked if that has ever happened and he said no.

,llgundall,2011-05-03T22:54Z,so your point is? its okey??
,burt64nyg,2011-05-04T08:31Z,The point is that you take a chance every time you download illegally. 
,burt64nyg,2011-05-04T08:36Z,"I also heard of the three strike rule. Some providers will give you three strikes when it comes to downloading illegally. If you get caught 3 times, they will ban you from ever receiving internet service from their company under your name. "
