,goingbaldy,2011-02-26T01:37Z,enough of the PPV crap!!
,mig7arte,2011-02-26T01:52Z,"wy canÂ´t this people wait!!!!!!!!,very low resolution"
,professorjpj,2011-02-26T02:42Z,What do you mean WAIT? WE'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE IT WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER TO THEATERS! ENOUGHS ENOUGH! 
,User897,2011-02-26T04:55Z,"This is fucking ridiculous.  We have R5's of bullshit movies that came out this month, yet we just now get a CRAPPY PPV watermarked piece of shit for Tron now?  What the fuck?  Why the hell is it so goddamned difficult to get a watchable copy of a film that will be officially released in April?  Has Disney removed everyone's balls? "

Instead of bitching what other people can or cannot do why don't you, that's right, YOU, show the way and upload a good copy. Take some initiative and DO something for the community.

""Has Disney removed everyone's balls?""
seemed to have removed yours."
,professorjpj,2011-02-26T07:10Z,"Trust me, if I had a PERFECT copy of this movie, I would release it today! Screw disney, and all the movie companies that won't let us pirates make a living too!!!  I HAVE BALLS!!!"

Fuck you.

Simple, yet effective.  You know my balls are still attached because they're bouncing against your chin, you asswhore."
,kartungg,2011-02-26T10:35Z,"This quality aint good at all :/
I mean, 1 of the greenskull uploaders should have a dvdrip now ? ppvrips are very low quality, not worth downloading... 

And YES, fuck disney and all the other movie companies."
,chedderz66,2011-02-26T13:18Z,I've seen some pretty good watchable PPVrips but this one is pretty bad according to the sample. I tried sitting through a TS of this weeks ago and stopped because it needs to be seen in R5 or better quality to be enjoyed. Thanks anyway.
,mikey21001,2011-02-27T08:17Z,"hmm.. I paid to see it in the theater, in 3d even.. loved it, and like downloading it until the Blu-Ray comes out, and then my ticket stub goes in the case. 

Until they come out with Instant-BluRays, this has to do.
