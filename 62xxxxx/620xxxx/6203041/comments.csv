I will seed upload during off peak hours. "
,ChiSicko,2011-02-28T17:32Z,It would be nice if someone would actually seed this; this is why many people ignore anything posted by a non-VIP.
,iPod87,2011-03-01T06:17Z,"Just a little update.

Sorry about the delay in seeding currently Starship Troopers, Serenity and Ghost Rider have multiple seeders. Though a lot of hit and runs too.

Am now working on seeding Rounders, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Miss March.

I will aim not to upload so many at once if I upload again (given the hostility I have encountered from comments I am less inclined to) as its too slow to seed more than 3-4 torrents at one time with my upload cap.

Personally I am sorry for having uploaded too many at once and therefore leaving some unseeded but I would like to point out that we should give every uploader a fair go, even VIPs were newbies at some point."
