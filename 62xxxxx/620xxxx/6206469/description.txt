The female-fronted noise poppers are certainly content to mine the depleted fields of shoegaze and twee indie sounds for inspiration, the group creates a maelstrom of melody out of both, with a layered, fuzzy approach that incorporates big, clean riffage, anonymous vocals hiding in the background, and a considerable churn across memorable four-minute pop songs. Thereâ€™s a great deal more structure in their work than is found in many of their contemporaries, and their contemplative song structures work in favor to this approach. Itâ€™s the perennial box of chocolates filled with razor wire, but even the most fastidious of modern music archaeologists wonâ€™t see this one coming.
