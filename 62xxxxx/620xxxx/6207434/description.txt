                Science-fiction drama series. When missing
                expeditionary Josie Hunter walks back into the
                settlement, unharmed, the jubilant air quickly takes
                a darker tone. Josie is different, her children
                cannot communicate with her, and reports of her
                violent behaviour circulate. Tate and Stella must
                find out what is behind this changed Josie, and begin
                to come to terms with what is really at work on the
                planet.
