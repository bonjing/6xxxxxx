*Release Notes...: The last episode of this was released as season 2 which turned out to be incorrect. There were two seasons
		   held in Alaska, not one. Discovery Channel categorizes this show as its own, separate from the Alaska
		   shows. These are obviously the same show held in different areas of the world. So, for the sake of 
		   archiving and continuity, this season will be tagged as the third season of "Out of the Wild".
