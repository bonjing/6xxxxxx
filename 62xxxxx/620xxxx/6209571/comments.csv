i think this might be good"
,marti-n92,2011-03-02T10:41Z,"it's big size because it's an dvd version, with .VOB files ;)

A 7 V 7"
,Barkingspyder,2011-03-03T09:14Z,"I'd rate the quality more like 8 audio and 8 for the video.  If you think this is a large file then you need to look at other DVDR files they all tend to be around 4 GB.  The upper obviously wanted to get the best quality from his rip of PPV so he didn't compress with xvid or divX or whatever.

Many thanks for the effort.  Really have to get to a theater and see this for full effect."
,toffel22,2011-03-08T17:15Z,no english subs. the quality is not good though i believe it's the best one out there yet.
,torent816,2011-03-14T07:55Z,"total crap quality, DON'T DOWNLOAD

just another TS formatted as a standard DVD file and not an actual DVD rip. just wait for a full 1080p blu-ray rip..."
,Brian1454,2011-03-15T15:56Z,"bad torrent
first of all: why the unholy huge file size?? 4.36Gb for something that should be at max 1.4GB or 700MB

the quality is very bad, under decent quality for a cam and barely watchable. (very dark, unsharp and bad sound)
V: 5
A:4

sidenotes:
the download was quite fast, and the intro for some reason is in some scandinavian language/
the subtitles (not hardcoded but optional) is decent"
,greenbeard2000,2011-03-15T22:32Z,"fuckin rubbish, unwatchable shite. missing the first 30 seconds A=0 V=0 it would have been better quality if you had drawn the movie with a crayon while drunk. its a waste of time to anyone who downloads it its the same shit cam rip as the rest"
