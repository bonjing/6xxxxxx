HDRI light kit pro,

found it somewhere on fileserve but it was really hard to find! so here you go guys!
I do think it's version 1.0 actually so not the newest one but that's okay for now!

WORKS OF COURSE FOR BOTH WINDOWS AND MAC!

put in the comments that it works if it does for you! it did for me! :D
