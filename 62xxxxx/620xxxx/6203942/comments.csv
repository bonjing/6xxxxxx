[V],-jonny-,2011-02-26T13:47Z,is there something wrong with the wiki release? i thought that was from the new bluray.
[V],aoloffline,2011-02-26T13:56Z,"It is from the new blu ray.The V?A is great,but has REZ 1280 x 534 instead of 1280 x 544.u can see in the screens"
[V],-jonny-,2011-02-26T14:44Z,10 pixels is nothing. the difference between 2.35-4:1 is unnoticeable imo. i'd stick with the wiki release.

,exaulted,2011-03-01T07:51Z,Wow.. I never had a problem with a torrent before. I usually see speeds of between 1.5MB/s and 2.5MB/s and higher. This torrent has been chugging along at 1.7kB/s and slower. It almost seems stuck at 34% for a couple of days now. What is going on with this torrent?
,ofpirate,2011-03-02T17:28Z,I agree... this torrent doesnt seem to be working properly.
,exaulted,2011-03-03T06:37Z,It isn't being seeded. We are stuck at 34.5% for days now. That's too bad. I was looking forward to this release.
[V],-jonny-,2011-03-03T12:41Z,I think I'm done here.
[V],aoloffline,2011-03-03T13:49Z,i'll seed
,abhikrit,2011-03-03T16:01Z,what the hell happened to your TRUSTED status jonny??
[V],-jonny-,2011-03-03T18:28Z,"I don't know, but I'm not carrying on without it. I don't lose out, but you lot do."
,l2s_rg,2011-03-03T21:23Z,"i wouldn worry about the skull jonny we all know your a quality releaser 
i also feel your pain couldn get into my other account had to create a new one same on the forum "
[V],-jonny-,2011-03-03T23:44Z,"Unless my skull magically reappears, I won't be returning. My forum account is also banned. The staff at this place like a good power trip.

I have done absolutely nothing wrong; I have provided quality HD movies for years, and this is the thanks I get. It's pathetic.

What they don't seeeem to realize is that I'm not the one losing out here.

Grow up. I suppose it makes sense that a pirate site is run by kids."
,abhikrit,2011-03-04T04:47Z,@ jonny.. .dont worry about your status out here.. though its totally unfair... but yeah... you have provided us with great HD stuffs... for great HD lovers like myself...
,rakz2cul,2011-03-07T19:04Z,"who is responsible for taking out vip sign from jonny...
jonny is an  awesome up-loader among all,putting up some good work for years... we all are very thankful
this is seriously insulting..."
,TRed07,2011-03-08T06:03Z,"Wow, big mistake by whoever did it.
If it wasn't for the -jonny- and GoodFilms uploads, I wouldn't even come to this site."
,Mathlol,2011-03-10T21:38Z,"Now that you mention it I do see.  Exactly, I came here for the high end and found jonny immediately.  Of co sometimes you don't need the size and cut down to other respectable releasers but jonny was a goto guy when you wanted something badly.
FIX IT!!!"
,Mathlol,2011-03-11T03:16Z,"Someone give Jonny his green skull back. 
I have no problem posting on every file I come across if thats allowed =)"
[A],toba,2011-03-11T09:05Z,"trusted skull is back. I like your torrents. whatever issues you and the mods had, consider them buried."
,esf4567,2011-03-15T06:04Z,Glad to see the trusted skull is back.  We all appreciate -jonny-'s work.  Thanks.
,ofpirate,2011-03-15T07:54Z,"hey jonny im noticing more and more 5.46gb releases out here lately... is there some new single layer burning technology out that im not aware of? also, thx to you, goodfilms, aoloffline, etc for many years of great quality entertainment"
,Night_89,2011-03-16T09:56Z,"Request
Resident evil quadrology 720p brrip
thanks"
,rlhq23,2011-05-25T23:21Z,"Jonny, you have my sympathies. At work, I'm the guy who ends up getting the shit despite the fact that I put the most work in. It's all taken for granted. So, I understand your frustrtion. Regardless if you return or not, thank you for ALL of your quality HD releases. So many of them were obscure classics that I couldn't find anywhere else. I couldn't have completed by Bogey collection without you. All I'm missing from my classics collection is On the Waterfront. I'll find it someday. Thanks for everything, Jonny!"
,rlhq23,2011-05-25T23:26Z,"Since I'm here, I do have a question. Why do some blu-ray rips seem to have such an excessive grain effect to them? Examples being the HD releases of 21 Grams and Black Swan. Obviously, it is intentional or unavoidable in some cases (i.e. 28 Days Later) but for the remainder, the inconsistency is beyond my understanding. Could anyone explain this to me? Thank you!"
,full.sail,2011-12-02T19:19Z,"Thanks!!!
Torrents looks really nice, i'll be ready to seed soon."
,Viciously,2012-05-09T08:40Z,Thanks. My favorite movie ever.
,parks88,2012-06-07T21:40Z,"the only files I have once the movie is finished downloading are "".mkv"" & "".nfo""...I also have a Mac...is there something that I should do in order to play?"
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-06-15T01:47Z,"-jonny-

Just to say a big Thank you, your movies are all great quality and I'm so thankfull for it. Please continue the good work, ignore the haters. I play your movies on a WDTV to my 40inch TV, all flawless, video and sound. Much better than 2g brrips."
