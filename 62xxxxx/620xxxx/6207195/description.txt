Jonathan Hugh - Lucid Dreaming | New Age, Ambient, Cello | 2010

    The album is in the style of cello post classical, indie, ambient, chill out. It is inspiried by the early concept albums of Jean Michel Jarre, Tomita, Mike Oldfield, Andreas Vollenweider, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, David Sylvian, Brian Eno and late Talk Talk where the tracks are continuous and flow into one cohesive piece. It takes the listener from a sunrise to a sunset. The cycle of one full day.


    This is definitely a great choice for those who loves ambient music. These songs are like streams that flow into you ears and touch your soul softly. You can listen to the whole album for free before buying it at http://jonathanhugh.bandcamp.com/album/lucid-dreaming, so why don't you give it a try. I am quite sure that you'll be charmed by the beautiful sound of Hugh's Cello.
