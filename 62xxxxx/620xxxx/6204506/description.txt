UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT!

Or something...the riff was a few minutes shorter than the video & I had to figure out how to re-synch it, so you'll notice a brief "riffless" period about an hour & twenty minutes in when they're running around the beach. Also, I don't know if this was cropped from 4:3 after the fact or if it's some sort of post-post-modern irony, but half of the director's credit is out of frame. Either way, it doesn't detract from the SHOCK AND TERROR.
