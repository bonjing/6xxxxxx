,oobaka,2011-02-28T17:36Z,"Clips of this movie don't do it justice.
This is truly a horrible horrible movie.
I highly recommend it *L*"
,candycanegl,2011-03-01T21:35Z,"omg this film was totally ruined! some idiots are talking thru the whole thing!!!! 

hah just kidding..some jackass has to make that comment on every riffed torrent though."
,gtvsa,2011-03-03T00:56Z,"Tom, it's already out. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6198731/RiffTrax_-_Harry_Potter_Order_of_the_Phoenix_-_dual_audio.avi
As mentioned in the comments though you either need the most recent update to VLC, or watch it in a diff program (quicktime, etc)"
,shpongles,2011-03-13T05:00Z,"The video is poorly cropped and stretched for some reason, as mentioned. But other releases aren't like that so it must be a problem from wherever this vid was taken from."
,murdkipz,2011-04-09T14:49Z,"Donating makes no sense. Why not just buy the actual rifftrax file? They don't care where you get the MOVIE, you just have to pay for the riff track, and donating randomly instead of buying the correct file completely fucks their ability to gather accurate statistics about their fanbase. "
,Animator5,2011-08-25T05:53Z,"Why is this censored? Granted i've only bought 2 riff  episodes, but neither one was censored. "
