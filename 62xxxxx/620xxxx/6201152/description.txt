Fifteen-year-old Madisen says she wants desperately for a place to belong and has made terrible choices in an attempt to do just that. She claims to have already gotten pregnant and started cutting herself. Everyone, even Madisen, agrees she is troubled, but why does Dr. Phil say it wouldâ€™ve been a bigger surprise if she didn't turn out this way? Did her father really try to forfeit his parental rights? And did her mother turn a blind eye to so many warning signs? Learn why Dr. Phil believes itâ€™s not too late for this teen.
