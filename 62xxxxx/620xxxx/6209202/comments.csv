,wawakaka,2011-02-28T20:21Z,brother.. i download .. one more e-book like this and its 2500 books so... its new vol.. please reply
,firgy,2011-02-28T21:52Z,This probably includes those files. I downloaded a 2500 ebook torrent and incorporated it into this one.
,tpb720,2011-03-02T21:17Z,"Nice effort, but too bad that the torrent includes lots of duplicates. Some books are included there several times...
You might have selected the best version of each book instead of cramming them all together."
,robert1246,2011-03-05T04:31Z,"I have to write something or else... Nice effort, but what's the idea of putting together a faawking big RAR file that downloads at less than 5 ko/S, which uTorrent says should be in in about 12 weeks from now; we are lucky this page says 24 seeders!!!"
,wawakaka,2011-03-05T16:38Z,BIG BIG THANX.. BROTHER.. GOD BLESS YOU
,robert1246,2011-03-08T03:23Z,OK I admit I was a little severe. It downloaded in less than 48 hours. But you have to admit that it is still a long wait if you only want some titles or authors. Good job; I will enjoy sorting them all
,dsrs,2011-07-04T15:09Z,"any thanks for first effort
have to agree that putting in rar not good idea
we cannot choose not to download individual books"
,Iceman480,2012-02-26T16:18Z,Thanks for the up. to thoses bitching when you sort through keep what you want then delete the rest after you have seeded.
