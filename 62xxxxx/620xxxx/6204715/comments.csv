[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-03T23:14Z,i never recommend burning my videos to dvd.  you will likely screw it up and of course the transfer to dvd is a very poor copy.

,NoMoleste,2011-03-24T08:44Z,"As usual from you excellent quality. Much thanks.Technical question though...
File plays fine on my PS3 from a sd card or directly off the ps3 hdd but if I try to stream from the desktop using ps3 media server I get an unsupported file error...even when I change the extension to mp4. This goes for all your files in my collection. Any thoughts on why?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-27T03:28Z,error with that program.
