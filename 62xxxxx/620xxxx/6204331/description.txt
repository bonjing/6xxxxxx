Hidden Agenda is an text-based computer strategy game whose scenario was designed and written in 1988 by Jim Gasperini, with input from project consultant Eric Ehrmann. The narrative simulation system was designed and implemented by Greg Guerin and Ron Martinez (who also produced the game). The game was intended to simulate the conditions of a post-revolutionary Central American country. It is considered a forerunner of the Games for Change movement, alongside other early Macintosh games including Chris Crawford's Balance of Power and Balance of the Planet.

The game is set in the fictional country Chimerica which has been recently liberated from the rule of the corrupt dictator Farsante and his ruling clique. The player takes the part of the newly elected president of Chimerica.
