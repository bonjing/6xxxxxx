                Penultimate episode of the chilling drama about three
                families who live in the same remote house in
                different time periods. In 1968, Robert advises a
                distraught Paul to leave the village and make a fresh
                start with Ruth. In 1987, Eddie and Helen are at
                still at loggerheads - then Amy goes missing. In
                2010, an exhausted Nisha is increasingly unsettled by
                strange goings on at Marchlands.
