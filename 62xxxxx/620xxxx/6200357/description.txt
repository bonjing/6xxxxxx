RELEASE NOTES

Welcome to a world of pain. Heaven is once again in danger and
threatened by a reckless army of hell spawn monsters - and they will
stop at nothing. This time, only two heroes can save heaven from total
destruction: Daniel and Belial, two champions from previous Painkiller
stories, have to team up and put an end to the conflict in the old epic
struggle between heaven and hell. Unfortunately hell's army is even
greater and stronger than before: The new general of the abyss has been
endowed with powers of all the previous leaders combined, and she's
determined to see the next war through until hell's victory. Her
legions won't back down without a long and bloody battle. Can you
survive the endless attacks of nightmarish minions and terrifying
fiends?
