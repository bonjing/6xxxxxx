,Psychedelic10,2011-03-17T05:03Z,"How do I get this to work? All that I get when I dl it and open the archive, is the .exe file which doesn't install anything, and only creates a black loading screen. There isn't a folder with game files in it or anything. I am relatively new, I've only mounted a few other games, and had no problems, but i cant figure out how to mount this and am sure I am missing something. Help is appreciated!"
,Psychedelic10,2011-03-17T23:24Z,Nevermind haha.
,mad_joe,2011-03-19T16:40Z,"what crack should i use this one or the crackfix? ive used this when i installed the game after i reach the area where i can purchase weapons/armors all the items are at 0 cost,looks like this is a crackfix+cheat though.."
,negity,2011-03-29T17:40Z,Hey man nice job but when i try to put on the Elite Engineering Suit first it takes it 3 light things to open up and second i cant see the suit only the weapons and i really want to have that suit its all yellow and stuff :D

,Growhow,2011-04-13T17:47Z,"Hey umm I'm not sure who I should ask about this but I've been wondering why no one has created a keygen for this game so people could play the multiplayer (MP requires the key).

Do you know are there any keygens or is it even possible to make one for this game?"

,Gabberz,2011-05-05T19:49Z,"So playing for the first time on a new game file and I come to the store and discover it's full of ALL the items and suits for free... wtf? anybody know why or how to get around this? I wanna play the game for real, not with some cheat in it.

PS: not playing the ""New game +"" or anything like that "
,bearscar93,2011-05-16T19:33Z,"im having a problem, when i start the game the only thing that comes up is a black loading screen. plz help."
,bearscar93,2011-05-16T19:45Z,i cant figure out of to do this. why do i get a black screen when i try to play the game??
,bearscar93,2011-05-16T21:01Z,"Nvm, was easier than i thought :P"
,Mikeee200,2011-05-19T06:27Z,"everyone here who is haveing problems with this or any other update, just search google for a hacked game save that has everything unlocked, and then start a New Game + =]"
,Banzay27,2011-05-21T06:03Z,"""The Elite Engineering Suit will now appear properly after completing a full-playthrough of the Single Player Campaign.""

Well, I want that, but I don't want all suits and items available at zero cost from the very beginning. Sure as hell not on my first go.
C'mon, that ruins the game, bro.
Ah to hell with it, guess the ""Elite Engineering Suit"" will hafta to be left out."
,timmyns,2011-06-30T07:04Z,"Great ""update"", now instead of crashing at the door in chapter 7, it just crashes randomly. Thanks!"
,sneezehead,2011-08-26T21:38Z,"""Save games will now be recorded, and deducted, properly when playing the Single Player Campaign in Hardcore mode.""

This is true, but unfortunately, the hardcore mode rewards do not unlock unless you play the entire game from start to finish without exiting to the main menu.  I hope there's another patch and Fairlight update to implement it, but I won't hold my breath."
,Hancock79,2012-04-03T17:47Z,"the update notes say that there's suits unlocked in the first store.  you can play the game ""for real"" without the extra weapons and suits, it's not going to magically force you to buy them."
