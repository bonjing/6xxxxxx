  Caught the first 60 laps or so on tv before I had to leave and it was a good race that far in at least"

,mavrix,2011-03-01T08:58Z,"I agree with newrose 100%, and I don't believe I saw any hiccups like those couple that were in the daytona upload.   10/10 all around, and a VERY good race!   

Thank you jameshotwire!

See you in Vegas!"
,rontorr,2011-03-02T04:03Z,"is it just me, or is the audio a few seconds out of sync with the video?"
,dzlrules,2011-03-02T04:11Z,"Thanks James. DL'ing now. Appreciate your time, efforts and bandwidth. 

@rontorr - Without having the file yet, I can't say. If it is though, I know with VLC media player you can advance or retard the track sync at tenths of a second intervals."
,salbrecht,2011-03-06T10:54Z,"Great quality!!  I did not notice any audio sync problems.  Also, thanks for including the post-race interviews.  Thanks for your effort, it is greatly appreciated."
