1985 - F.Z. Meets The Mothers Of Prevention

...was originally released in two slightly different versions in the US and Europe. The two versions were later combined and reissued on a compact disc: first in the US on Rykodisc in 1986 (although this version omitted the track "H.R. 2911"), then on the European "Zappa Records" disc released in 1990, and finally on the Rykodisc reissue in 1995.

The album's title is a reference to the lobby group, the PMRC, who were campaigning to require record companies to put warning stickers on albums they considered offensive, and to Zappa's former band, The Mothers of Invention. The original US version of the album contains the track, "Porn Wars" â€” a sound collage featuring excerpts from PMRC hearings. This track was omitted from non-US versions, and replaced with three other pieces: "I Don't Even Care", co-written by Zappa and Johnny "Guitar" Watson, and two instrumental tracks â€” "One Man, One Vote" (a Synclavier composition) and "H.R. 2911", which collates some of the backing music from "Porn Wars", without the PMRC hearing excerpts and other dialogue.
