Niji Entertainment, founded by Wendy and Ronnie James Dio, before Ronnieâ€™s untimely death, is keeping it in the family by releasing Bitten by the Beast, as David Rock Feinstein is Ronnieâ€™s cousin and former band member in Elf.

Feinstein has put together nine new old school style Metal tunes that will have you cranking it up to eleven. The most talked about song is sure to be â€œMetal Will Never Dieâ€ sung by Ronnie James, himself. The rest of the album does not break any molds but it sure as hell rocks hard enough to keep the horns in the air and the heads banging.

â€œSmoke on the Horizonâ€ opens with a massive riff that sets the stage for the best tune on the album, â€œEvil In Me.â€ Other standout moments include the seedy â€œKill The Demonâ€ and â€œGambler, Gambler.â€ â€œRockâ€™s Boogieâ€ is the only time where one might think that the music does not match up to the rest of the album, as the main riff is simply â€œLa Grangeâ€ with a ton of distortion. That said, even it rocks.

In a time where â€˜Metalâ€™ tends to mean growling or just idiots pounding on their instruments, it is refreshing to see passion remain for the true roots of the genre.
