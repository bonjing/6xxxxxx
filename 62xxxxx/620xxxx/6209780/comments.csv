,jj423,2011-03-01T02:42Z,so? what ya think about it? any comments?
,pstreets,2011-03-03T00:18Z,"I think it's got a lot of potential.  Uses all the standard Android widgets, but like all home screen replacements it doesn't support HTC sense widgets...  Performance is definitely a big deal for SPB, it's very smooth (on HTC Desire)...  they have a nice set of their own widgets, but a lot of them aren't fully functional, or aren't for me at least.  Also there is no Programs list, they put all your apps in screens automatically.  I don't really like that... ill keep using it for a few days and see how i like it, also hope I get a beta invite.  "
,kaizen61,2011-03-03T19:57Z,It doesn't 'support' the HTC sense stuff because it is proprietary and HTC won't allow it.
,akaquizno,2011-04-06T03:26Z,will this not work now that the real version is released. it wont load for me
,Mr.Leach,2011-04-12T05:10Z,"jj423, Thank You Very Much. (HARD AS HELL TO FIND)

IT WORKS FINE ON MY HTC EVO
TRY INSTALLING IT VIA SUPERBOX FREE FROM ANDROID MARKET. YOUR WELCOME DIP"
,GKT4734,2011-04-23T16:59Z,how do i install this on my android.  I am a complete newbie to android.  thanks
,pharmocy82,2011-06-18T12:20Z,This is an excellent navigation app for 3D viewing of mulitple home screens. I installed this on my rooted HTC desire hd and it worked. The rooted phone runs off ADWlauncher which allows individual customisation of icons and grided formation of apps. This app does not allow gridding of apps so you cant separate them into rows - its a continous row that has to be filled (hope u understand that!). Good to download and play around with esp as the visual manipulation of home screens is a wow factor for phone show offs.

,wii666,2011-07-31T05:55Z,"My Rooted Liberty v.09 Droid X says not compatible, but I just tried pushing buttons because I saw that it had loaded in the background... I pushed the search button and away went the notification that it was not compatible. It has not crashed yet... and allows me to lock and unlock and still have it running. Tried rebooting, and had to go through the activation thing again.

Activate? Yes then says loading with an overlay screen that says not compatible. Wait for the SPB to load in the background then hit the magnifying glass ""search button"" works every time for me. "
,kimma20,2012-01-07T06:37Z,some one have it for symbian ?
,leffe72,2012-01-13T22:23Z,"It doesn't work on Sony Ericsson Arc. Not compatible, it says. "
