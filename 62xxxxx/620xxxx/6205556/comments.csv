Plot

John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) is an alien from planet Lorien who was sent to Earth as a child alongside eight others to escape an invading race, the Mogadorians, which destroyed their home planet. He is protected by a Guardian, Henri (Timothy Olyphant), and has developed superpowers due to his extraterrestrial nature, such as enhanced strength, speed and agility, telekinesis, resistance to fire and heat and the power to generate light from his hands.
The Mogadorians, led by the Commander (Kevin Durand) eventually discover about the nine toddlers and come to Earth in search of them. They can only be killed in a particular sequence, with three of them having already been slain. John is Number Four. Knowing this, he and Henri move from Florida to Paradise, Ohio, where John befriends conspiracy theorist Sam Goode (Callan McAuliffe); and falls in love with amateur photographer Sarah Hart (Dianna Agron), whose ex-boyfriend, school athlete Mark James (Jake Abel) is a bully who often torments both John and Sam."

[V],globeplus,2011-02-27T06:42Z,"To concerned : RIGHT ! IT IS ! Russian cam in fact and by the way i am concerned if you donÂ´t know where i can get audio or english subtitles for this movie ? the true is that we really are more than lucky to have this movie like this for the moment , really bullshit files out there ... How much time do you think can take to the english cam be available ? "
,Prosper0,2011-02-27T14:47Z,are there at least subtitles for this? :/
,honunet,2011-02-27T17:25Z,why would you even upload this?  Are you Russian?
,lisik_aka_andrew,2011-02-27T18:25Z,what's the problem in being russian? I actually am russian so what does it change?
,jacquetc,2011-02-27T18:49Z,"To the uploader:
Is there any English or Spanish subtitles available for this movie? Unfortunately not everybody speaks Russian. 
Anyway, thank a lot."

[V],globeplus,2011-02-27T23:46Z,"Hi friendly users of this movie file ! Unfornatly for this movie it is only crap files with codec bullshit around and even myself didnÂ´t mind to have subtitles in english or spanish but the reality for the moment it is that only a russian cam can be watched , so i suggest to the users that if someone find that subtitles create a link in any nice file sharing service around and please upload them , normaly can be a mega or less for that , so for the moment this still the best possible to watch this movie , thank you and anyone can help creating a link to subtitles for this movie . Thank you ."
,dlarrym1111,2011-02-28T01:04Z,"It was uploaded in Russian because a huge number of the members here are Russian . . HELLO ALL YOU IDOTS. Why can't a given movie be in Russian? They have some of the best stuff Iv'e seen. . Can you not read subs that are in your own lang.? or do they come and go to fast for you. I just got a copy of NIGHT WATCH and the sequel DAY WATCH! Those are AWESOME movies!!! I suggest anyone who liked the MATRIX or the NAKED LUNCH from Cronenberg will loves these pics. ANYWAY.

,inmartie,2011-02-28T11:22Z,If anyone have a subtitle in english 
,lisik_aka_andrew,2011-02-28T18:41Z,"dlarrym1111
Appreciate your words, man!
The funny thing is that being russian I like TPB because here us the only place where you can find movies in any languages you like without having too much trouble with it. And thats a great thanks for creators and administrators!
I searched through several russian websites for english or spanish subtitles but couldn't find any. Maybe it's just a question of time, just like nice DVDRip or even BDRip, so let's just be patient and wait a little."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-28T21:59Z,"NEWS : i got some time and the correct means to do a nice work in the English subtitles but 7 or 8 hours beeing a kind of fast are needed to have them ready to go ... i already have close an hour of movie done but more 3 hours or something maybe no one can take from me to finish the work , please users of this file i want the next opinion : of course that the english subtitles will be uploaded in a link to complement this file but the fact that i have the subtitle when i finish the work can be justificative for a new file with them hard subbed ? please give me your opinion about this particular subject . Thank you and ... THE WORK IS GOING ... a link will be uploaded at this comments soon as possible ."

,dlarrym1111,2011-03-22T21:01Z,"@lisik_aka_andrew, If your talking about the comment made by , then I should tell you, That the comment he made IS NOT about Russia or the Russian people. 

Of coarse there is nothing wrong with being Russian, or speaking Russian. The comment your talking about was only pointing out that it is bit strange to upload a movie that the upoader him or her self cannot even understand. 

PLEASE don't start some sort of racist arguments on these comment areas. This is for rating movies and comments about the quality of these movies. Thanks"
