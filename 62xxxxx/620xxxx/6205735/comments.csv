Tonight is Part Four - but shows even with -1 CANNOT be uploaded.

Seems as continuation of victories of lunatics."

,jon4fun,2011-02-27T15:54Z,"Thanks for the 2nd chance and the extras [+]. I've heard about Charlie Sheen ranting on this guys show so I have got to hear what goes on on Alex Jones.

I'll also give [Camelot] ago even though I am sick of a 're-visioning of the Authurian Legend'. This has literally been done to death and they all, so far have sucked - just my opinion, in book, TV and movie format. With the possible exception of [Excalibur] but that they have been the soundtrack :-) that I enjoyed.

THANKS, for the small size/high qaulity files.

Cheers
Jon"
,dark_defender,2011-02-27T18:15Z,"Thanks 20-40 for the encode & upload..+1
If possible could you please re-seed Hustle S07E06 in ""TV.Shows.Pack.Feb.18.Fri.H264i[CHOOSE]"" or in some other TV show pack? My RAM died and i wasnt able to complete the download within your earlier seeding time. And now it is not getting completed.
Thanks in Advance !!
*Thumbs Up*"
,jmac85,2011-02-27T18:29Z,"You have to upload The Promise. I've been following the series and cannot be left just hanging! You know all the lunatics are the ones downrating the torrent, so ignore them. Besides, the 'Quality' should not be used to rate the show itself, only the visual and audio quality of the material. If anyone knows anything about your encodes, they will know that both A/V are perfect."
,htctouch,2011-02-27T19:57Z,thnk u sir :) ur gr8
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-27T20:08Z,"@dark_defender: In TV pack tomorrow.

@jmac85: Rules have been made clear long ago. What bothers me is 134 finished downloads on Promise P3 - and only fucking 22 ""pluses"" and 37 ""minuses""  from perpetual idiot (one guy who change proxy servers) and in general hit minus BEFORE torrent is out (this one - 10 frikkin GB got 2 minuses in first 20 minutes when less than 2% was out). He doesn't care about A/V quality - he is just mentally ill.

Point being - if someone love some show - he COULD vote. Vote doesn't goes to me - but the show, to be uploaded in future.

I give a damn for votes anyhow. Thanks are different thing."
