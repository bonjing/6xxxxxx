Someones attempt to ""COVER"" them has only messed up this copy. Its all blurry at the bottom and worse still, the non-english parrts that are subtitled, are partly covered by this lame attempt to cover the time stamping at the bottom of the frame. Does ANYONE have or know where a copy is that hasn't been screwed with. This is barely watchable i my opinion. The sound is good and the p icture is good too except where this blurry area is. I have software to do this as well, but I wouldn't FORCE everyone downloading to my preferred way to watch a movie buy making irreversable changes to it. Doing this makes everyone else that doesn't want the stuff at the bottom covered up to have to deal with it ANYWAY. Who is the selfish but that fucked a great WP up.??? I know it wasn't you .BONE. so please don't take offense. I do appreciate it. I know it was like this where ever you got it from. Just for the record, PLEASE, any uploaders, LET THE DOWNLOADER be the one to decide if alterations need to be made. Its one thing to try and get a CAM watchable, but thiis supposed ""FIX"" blocks about 15% of the total view and as I said, covers important subs when people are not speaking english, and in this film, is a lot of the time. IF another, ""un-tainted"" copy exists, please post a link. Thanks .BONE. truly, I know it wasn't your doing, your just trying to bring great things to the rest off us.!!!! Nuff Said. . . "
