Is Obama Jewish? 




We are talking about a man that dons a skull cap and
campaigns for president of the United States, by visiting the wailing wall and
Yad Vashem, the sacred jew holocaust shrine. This is a man who went from an
absolute NOBODY Senator, to President of the United States in two years flat.

I can point out a thousand times Obama wearing his yarmulke, or that his staff
is entirely jewish (Emanuel, Summers, Axelrod, Clinton). Or that every
appointment Obama made, when taking office, were jews (Paulson, Napolitino
and others). Or that his chief of staff is the son of jewish irgun terrorists. Or I
can point out how he recognizes and celebrates jewish holidays, like he is
going to do now. Obama will be the first president (thought he was a black
dude?) ever to host the jewish passover ritual known as seder at the White
House.

Not exactly keeping in trend with someone whoâ€™s
supposed to be posing as a christian. Or was it Muslim? No...itâ€™s jew. This is
the same holiday Abraham Lincoln was assassinated during all those years ago.
Barack Obama, the non-jew, also goes out of his way to bless everyone with his
warmest Hannukah greetings.

Barack Obama claims Jewish "kinship" HERE stating clearly, "There is a kinship and a sense of shared community that predates my political career and will extend beyond this particular election," Obama said, according to the pool report from the
closed-door event. "Know that I will be there for you, just as I believe that you
will be there for me." Stressing the point, he added: "My links to the Jewish
community are not political. They preceded my entry into politics." Weâ€™d be
silly to think they didnâ€™t, Hussein Obama.
