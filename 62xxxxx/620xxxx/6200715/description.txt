"Todd Packer"

After many years and motel rooms, Dunder 
Mifflin traveling salesman (and Michael 
Scott's best friend) Todd Packer (guest star 
David Koechner, "American Dad") is ready to 
leave the road behind and take a desk job in 
the office. However, it remains to be seen if 
Jim (John Krazkinski), Dwight (Rainn Wilson), 
Holly (guest star Amy Ryan, "Gone Baby Gone") 
and the rest of the office are ready for 
Todd. Elsewhere, after his computer freezes 
for the millionth time, Andy (Ed Helms) 
battles office administrator Pam (Jenna 
Fischer) for a new computer.

Enjoy :)
