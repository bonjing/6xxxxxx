Dr. Martin Harris and his wife Liz arrive in Berlin for a biotechnology summit. Upon arriving at their hotel, Martin realizes he forgot his briefcase at the airport. He takes a taxicab driven by Gina, but on the way to the airport, the cab crashes off a bridge into the river after narrowly avoiding a refrigerator that falls off a delivery truck. Martin is knocked unconscious upon impact, but Gina saves him from drowning before fleeing from the scene. On Thanksgiving day, he comes to at the hospital after being in a coma for four days."

Cheers and if i was you watched the movie with this file ! Seriously ."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-26T04:56Z,"To concerned : GOD DAMMIT ! READ THE DESCRIPTION ! It says that it is an Avi DivX worked by the Dub plugins but the type of the filmed video is a CAM , worked CAM in this case if you prefere , i understand the point of view that you are making but still a cam anyway worked more correctly as possible by the dub plugins , now imagine that it is a DVD Screener then get the indication of that but still worked by the Dub plugins in an Avi Divx video type .

Cheers . "

,asaiza2000,2011-02-26T22:00Z,"@concerned... I have to write this because I'm so sick of seeing your stupid comments on all of globeplus torrents. I'm so irritated by the fact that you keep thinking your so smart and think you know what your talking about, but you don't. I have taken it upon myself to provide you with a link to the definition of DIVX... because it is painfully obvious that you have NO clue. Globeplus is doing his best to make a cam into something of decent quality...so that people like you and me can enjoy it. I can't believe that you are so unappreciative about that. You are an asshole. Sorry to offend anyone..  DIVX definition  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DivX"
,asaiza2000,2011-02-26T22:26Z,"One more thing to anyone that does not understand. A cam is just that.. a cam.  Divx is a video format that allows for a smaller size (difference could be up to 2GB smaller) but the same kind of quality that you would get from a VOB (dvd) format. For example say you take some home video clips and you want to convert them... and say you have 3 choices, VOB= 2GB excellent quality, FLV= 300MB crappy quality, or DIVX= 700MB excellent quality. Choosing divx will give you a decent sized file and excellent quality.  BOTTOM LINE> globeplus is NOT saying he has a DVD rip here... he is just simply saying he has converted the video to divx."
,Shoobox,2011-02-27T02:43Z,"@concerned
i usually do not agree with globe but you sir are wrong.
 DivX is a codec format of a  video file,  a cam can be a DivX format too.

once again @concerned DivX is a encode format.
lots of people use cams for home movies that are in DviX format to playback on their DivX player.

[V],globeplus,2011-02-27T03:05Z,"To asaiza2000 : thank you for your observations but the Concerned only think that is a repetitive indication saying that a movie canÂ´t be divx and cam at the same time , i think it is possible because  the codec that do the codification is the Divx but the way that the movie is , is a cam not a dvd rip or screener , like the codec used or video type can be xvid or like in this case divx or wherever , what  mean is independtly of the codec used to get the picture the way the movie is presented is a cam , 700 mb for a divx can be ok but more than 1000 bitrate in a nice way is not a bad idea , so a giga can be the ideal for this type of file , you get a nice bitrate and no doubt the imperfections worked are corrected more as possible but still true that 700 mb for a divx can still be ok . Thanks for your comment but i think Concerned get the point view of that a movie can be a cam and divx at the same time , the picture is a cam but the codec to get the video is divx ."
[V],globeplus,2011-02-27T03:08Z,"To shoobox : it is unbelievable that even you think that a movie can be a cam and get the codification video with the Divx codec but it is possible , i think the Concerned need to relax a little bit on his appreciations , that´s all ."
,captain71pugwash,2011-02-27T05:24Z,"Just read the comments.. What is it with you people that continually moan when you are getting this for free.. Are positive comments to much to ask ??? For fuck sake, show a bit of appreciation once and a while eh, and be grateful for what you get !"
,FreeHansje,2011-03-02T12:01Z,"Wether this is codex DivX or not is irrelevant: if you do not state clearly this is a CAM recording you lul a lot of ppl in thinking this might be from a DVD. I don't want to watch CAM recordings, no matter how good they may be."
,blusniffer,2011-03-03T00:51Z,"Excuse me Uncortonable? Please don't try to sound intelligent globe because you end up making an idiot of yourself as i cringe at your comments! Please remember your on an illegal site so keep the attitude to a minimum when you have a go at critics of your files!!

Here's some homework for you,
1) Upload a file that isn't someone elses torrent upload.
2) Use something other than the now infamous ""free dub plugins"""
,blusniffer,2011-03-03T00:57Z,"Oh and before his 2 suck buddies jump in, i don't think i'm better than anyone else i'm just the same as other users only i hate seeing reviewers shot down because they correctly called them all shit!!!
Some of u idiots thinks he's working 18hrs to upload a divx get a grip. Uploaders like bone share some real quality files unlike this plegerist who can't take the critics."
,Krelianz,2011-03-13T19:28Z,can i get a screen capture of the quality?
,haylzxx,2011-03-14T16:21Z,A/V????
,pmartini,2011-03-20T03:17Z,Seems that is very difficult for you to mention that is CAM on title
,blusniffer,2011-03-23T05:21Z,"He is not interested in quality, it's quantity so he can turn to one of his friends and say 'i've uploaded a couple of hundred torrents haha'!

Of course what he doesn't include is that 92% of his uploads are v4 A6 shit cams which were other uploaders 1st attempts which he dub plugins!!!!  lmao"
,theoriginalphantom,2011-04-02T15:16Z,"@globeplus
Dont worry about the comments of others. You do some good uploads that I note others dont. Divx, Xvid, Avi etc are just codecs for video, which incidentally are the main ones used in video cameras. They are also pretty much universal for uploads as most if not all pcs etc can read. Get a grip people and appreciate what others do for the rest of us."
