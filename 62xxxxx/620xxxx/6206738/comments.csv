,y3n007,2011-02-28T08:41Z,Is this as horrible as it looks?
,Neoburn,2011-02-28T18:54Z,It's a bad movie but i like it when movie's ar that bad 
,PurityDeath,2011-02-28T20:03Z,"This movie was actually pretty good. I caught it one bored night on Sci-Fi.

Bean's role isn't very big but who really cares about that guy anyways? The decent plot, acting, action and girls dragged it to completion without kicking and screaming."
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2011-03-01T08:25Z,What a shitty movie. So fake looking. lol.. Only watch this if you are very high. I couldn't watch it the quality is good but the movie itself and production sucks hard.
[V],matimike,2011-03-01T17:52Z,a/v 10 thanks
,stanmedico,2011-03-02T18:50Z,"u fucking idiots, just watch morons. watching all movies for no money and commenting about production , direction and all .shit eaters "
,PurityDeath,2011-03-03T00:50Z,"It's not as if they force you to pay for it on basic cable.

Everyone knows Sci-Fi's array of movies are total garbage. Anyone thinking about watching one should already be taking into consideration the fact that they're just laughably bad with their production values and are usually plagued with HORRIBLE acting and CGI.
I have no idea how they've come to the conclusion that producing and airing the plethora of suckfest movies that they do is a good/money-making decision.

That network has been nothing but worthless useless garbage since they canceled Farscape.
Battlestar Galactica and Stargate are such fail goddamn shows.
Merlin is the only decent thing they have going for them and I watch it when it's new, not two years old.
All inclusive, taking all that into account, this is still the best one of their suckfest movies I've seen in 5 years and I'm hoping that it portends well for their future but have very low expectations."
,donki,2011-03-04T14:08Z,I enjoyed the end credits most.

,pen8tr8tor,2011-03-11T05:26Z,i really want to know who the script writer is. what a shat movie
,maggotrape,2011-03-13T08:16Z,"This is WORSE than it looks. It has to be one of the most obscene wastes of film I have ever wasted 90 minutes of my life on. I urge anyone reading this to just skip it! Now that I think about it, I have wasted more than 90 mins cause i had to download it too. The best part of the movie was the half a second it took me to delete it. If you are going to get it anyway, then here ya go;
Audio-8
Video-9
Movie-(see above)
Thanks Extremezone! 
Seed Seed Seed!"
,maggotrape,2011-03-13T08:20Z,"Is anyone else as ummm, well, uhhhm, scared of the ""beasts"" as I was??? I can not for the life of me, picture the staff meeting in which this film was greenlit!"
