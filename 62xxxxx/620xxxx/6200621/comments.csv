,WARFDEE,2011-02-25T04:41Z,I can't find it again but someone posted this episode under eztv as a wmv file.  when you try to open it it says you need a license and then shoots viruses your way so if you come across it stay the hell away its a fake.  And by the way thank you eztv fast as always with the real ones.

,mugginsville2000,2011-03-05T23:39Z,so im a total newb and was wondering how i seed after a download is done.  if i delete the torrent from my library but i keep the files in the directory they download to will it still seed the file?  any help would be much appreciated
,ionlyknow,2011-03-09T23:04Z,"@mugginsville2000
To upload you download the file, keep it exactly as it was when you downloaded it (inj the same folder) and do not shut of the upload in utorrent (or whatever software you use). The upload will then go by itself. "
,Spyxz,2011-03-21T17:30Z,"Thanks, great quality as always."
,romanof,2011-03-23T16:04Z,"@mugginsville2000
your post made me very happy because there is not many (new) users who wants to UL. Everything that ionlyknow said is true, after the download is finished just leave it in the program you used and dont shut it off or remove the torrent, then everything should be ok."
