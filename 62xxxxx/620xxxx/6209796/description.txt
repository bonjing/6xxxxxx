This collection contains all the lectures by Manly Palmer Hall which have ever been made available to the public.

The first folder consists of all the lectures which have been published in an organized album series. It includes a total of fourteen separate albums, most of these consisting of five individual lectures, with the exception of "The Wisdom Series", "The Love Series" and "Life in the Twenty-First century Series", each consisting of six lectures. It may seem that some files are missing, but in fact this is because unfortunately the corresponding tapes were not even sold as The Philosophical Research Society considered that the audio quality of the original recordings were too poor.

In addition to the organized albums, there also exist several hundred recordings of lectures which were not published in albums. Two hundred and eighteen of these were sold as individual cassette tapes, and more exist which have never been made available to the public.
The second folder consists of all these two hundreds and eighteen additional lectures that were sold as individual tapes. The individual lectures in this folder are organized by subject matter.

Please enjoy, share, and, if you are downloading this collection via BitTorrent, please help by continuing to seed after your download is complete.
