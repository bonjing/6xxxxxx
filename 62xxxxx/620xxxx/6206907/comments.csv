,Millor1,2011-05-19T08:37Z,Most complete dethklok collection however.... Why is the first season in russian? and why is the second season have russian subtitles? playing them with VLC media player... any help?
,Millor1,2011-05-29T23:25Z,"Alright so anyways, I figured out my problem but just confirming that this probably the best dethklok torrent you'll find. You'll need VLC media played to play the episodes and extra's. Most of the first season default language is in russian but you can change it to english from audio > audio track. Russian subtitles can be turned off from video > subtitles track. Anyways, great quality nice upload"
