,DragonKP,2011-03-01T16:16Z,"It does come with understanding that you have YOUR OWN BRAIN, not tinted by outside sources.
Understood?

If not - then sorry, get lost and go to ""Alice in Wonderland section"" (then you will have at least Tin Man - probably as mind contolled as you).

Bye. (meaning discussion with you is OVER)."
,DragonKP,2011-03-01T16:53Z,"t will be a kind of combined answer, since I do not want to waste too uch of my energy for mostly morons:

Moron, who cannot even express himself in the language commonly used here (English), therefore I provide a rough translation below:

German to English translation (from Google translate):

The Jew-haters spreading Nazi propaganda. Their past would be proud if the asshole was not dead.

He is stupid totally - Israel is now doing exactly what Nazis did in past (check my torrents - I recommend 2 books of 100% Jew who lived there - Jack Bernstain).

Maybe he is this famous IDL or whatever they call it there, online warried.
(For him I'm preparing another interesting release - ""Executive Intelligence Review - The Ugly Truth about the ADL"", - just wait and salivate)

3)

Knowlegde is POWER.
And without doing proper research YOU are SHIT, and nothing else.

Another IDL operative (sayanim, or whatever Victor Ostrovski called it?). Check also my previous torrent for son of Rome's rabbi - Ariel Toaff - Blood Passover (Pasque di Sangue) - The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murder.

Anyway, I also answered this guy's comments for other torrent:

It does come with understanding that you have YOUR OWN BRAIN, not tinted by outside sources.

If not - then sorry, get lost and go to ""Alice in Wonderland section"" (then you will have at least Tin Man - probably as mind contolled as you).

,DragonKP,2011-04-01T06:26Z,"Better yet - listen to Peter Beter from 1970s - up to early 1980s (US) so you will know how Americans lost to Russians a battle of harvest moon (exactly speaking - battle of the moon). Obviously it was never mentioned in US because those population was destined to be dumb forever (and now they try to do it to everybody). They cut orig anal link to those broadcasts of Mr. Beter, but it happens that I have multiple copies scatter all over the world (just in case like this, I advertise I have it, and they say you no) - So I advertise I DO HAVE IT, and anything happens to me than more copies will pop up in places you have no idea about.

WHO WANTS A COY?"
,DragonKP,2011-04-01T06:28Z,Correction: COPY 
,DragonKP,2011-04-01T06:32Z,"And what I learned from Russian friends - too little vodka is bad for international friendship !!!
And who on Obama's plantation, or circumsized fiefdom of Rotchilds can say that I'm wrong ??????????

Use your brains people.

And wait for comments below."
