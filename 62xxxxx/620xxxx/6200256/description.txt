***********************************************************************************

This 102-page eBook is a collection of Speed Painting tutorials, which have been created by some of the top digital painters around today. The idea behind this tutorial series was for the artist to interpret a one-line descriptive brief, create a speed painting from it and then produce a tutorial showing and explaining each stage of production of the artwork. Some of the artists have also kindly created some unique brushes which can be downloaded at the end of their Speed Painting tutorials. This downloadable PDF eBook can be followed in most 2D software packages that support paintbrushes and layers.
