There are alot of titles here that im not familiar with, most of the earliest works, and i had thought, before now, that i had read almost all of his books. These are all DRK titles right?  "
,Kikee_31,2011-05-11T01:28Z,"Ive successfully finished downloading but i dont know how to open the files. I selected a book (Dark of the Woods) just a random choice, and tried to open it but i get a message saying windows cannot open. I tried to use Adobe Reader but it doesnt read .opf or .MOBI and i dont have a clue what that means myself. =(

**CAN SOMEONE HELP PLEASE? I would appreciate any assistance you can offer. "
