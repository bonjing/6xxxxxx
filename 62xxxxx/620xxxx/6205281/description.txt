German-born American stand-up talent Daniel Tosh steps into the spotlight to share his unique take on current events in this stand-up special that originally aired on Comedy Central. While the original broadcast was censored for content, however, this release affords viewers the option of enjoying Tosh's act with all of the gut-busting obscenity well intact. An additional question and answer session with the funnyman provides greater insight than ever into his unique, sidesplitting wit.
