The Singing Detective is a BBC television serial written by Dennis Potter, which stars Michael Gambon, and was directed by Jon Amiel. The episodes were "Skin", "Heat", "Lovely Days", "Clues", "Pitter Patter", and "Who Done It".
The serial was broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in 1986 on Sunday nights at 8pm from 16 November to 21 December with later PBS and cable television showings in the United States. PBS at that time considered it too risquÃ© to be shown in prime time, delaying its programming until 11pm. It won a Peabody Award in 1989. It ranks 20th on the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, as voted by industry professionals in 2000. It was included in the 1992 Dennis Potter retrospective at the Museum of Television & Radio and became a permanent addition to the Museum's collections in New York and Los Angeles. There was co-production funding from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The DVD set was released 15 April 2003.
The serial was adapted into a 2003 film featuring Robert Downey, Jr. and Mel Gibson, with the locations changed to the United States.
There are several soundtrack CDâ€™s. This double-CD compilation comes from Connoisseur Collection in 1993.
