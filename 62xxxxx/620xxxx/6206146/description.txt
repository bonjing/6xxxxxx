Take the Leap into All Grain!

James Spencer and Steve Wilkes have teamed up to take the intimidation out of all grain brewing. Their DVD video, "Stepping into All Grain", is an easy-to-follow introduction into making great beer from grains.

This video takes you from milling the grains to collecting your wort. It is primarily designed to be used by those who already know how to brew using extracts, but new brewers will learn a lot, too.

The DVD uses a non-linear approach, enabling you to choose between infusion mashing or step mashing and then batch sparging or continuous sparging. We cover: grain, equipment, water, mashing (infusion and step), vorlauf, lautering, and sparging (batch and continuous).
