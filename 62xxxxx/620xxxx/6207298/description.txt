fka, a young borderline misanthrope, observes the instability of her own life as if from a distance. Though she dabbles in art, the lethargic Ofka chooses to work nights at a convenience store owned by her brother-in-law instead of studying for a career. But when her boyfriend jilts her and the store is robbed during her shift, Ofka gets a jolt in the direction of adulthood. As her self-absorption begins to dissipate, she starts to see things more clearlyâ€”like the fact that her friend Ubr loves her from afar. His crush goes unrequited, but Ofka rejects his advances with a kindness that signifies her progression from childishness to maturity. Though there is no grand revelation for Ofka, she feels the earth gradually shifting beneath her feetâ€”taking her closer to a place where she can hold on to those she loves.

Night Owls was shot mainly in the Karlin district of Prague, where modern architecture has rapidly replaced the old, andâ€”in screenwriter Irena HejdovÃ¡â€™s wordsâ€”â€œeverything is changing.â€ Cold, damp, and bleak as it seems, however, Ofka need only move out of the shadows and into the light of a doorway to discover a multitude of possibilities. The story of her awakening is a departure for director Michaela PavlÃ¡tovÃ¡, better known for animated shorts that have garnered her both an Oscar nomination and a Golden Bear at the Berlinale.
