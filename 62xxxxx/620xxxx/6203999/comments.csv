,Montel-,2011-04-11T03:11Z,I didn't follow the advice not to download this version because of non-English audio all because it says here that the spoken language is in English.   The truth is that SOME is in English. All the scenes in France are in French with no subs. So you have to understand both languages which I think would not be Mr Eastwood's idea and not appeal to a broad audiance.  If you understand only English - chose another version.  I found a good one with English sub on the French dialog.
