Anyway, thanks eztv for uploading."
,csgroen,2011-02-25T11:04Z,"NOT FAKE.

If you use an application like uTorrent or BitTorrent, it starts seeding automatically after finishing the download. If you don't delete, move or change the file or remove the torrent from the list, you are seeding."

,-Eris-,2011-02-25T14:21Z,"You guys should learn to check on your codecs and player settings before stating a torrent as fake, or offending someone who actually is making a damn good job at uploading the torrents of the shows we all wish to see. Stop bitching and being ungrateful and share! Thank you EZTV team for all the great uploads! You guys rock!"
