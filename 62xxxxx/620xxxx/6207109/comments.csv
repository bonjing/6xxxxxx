[V],aoloffline,2011-02-28T12:39Z,Check TPB more often :-).Regarding releases it's at the top above most HD private trackers.Releaselog & whatever site u use don't always cover all HD p2p releases
,hplp20,2011-03-02T05:11Z,Would you mind uploading the scene releases as well? p2p releases come in non-standard sizes.
