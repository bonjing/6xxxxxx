[center]AGGRESSIVE ARCHIVE FORCE

UFC.127.Penn.vs.Fitch.PPV.720p.HDTV.x264-aAF

RELEASE DATE: 2011.02.27

As usual nonsense nukers never realize how live sports work
the glitch at 15min mark was part of the ppv broadcast as the recording itself
had zero errors, take it up with ufc not aaf

Big up all scene massive!
