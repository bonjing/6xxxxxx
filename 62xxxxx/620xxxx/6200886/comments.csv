Thanks for sharing though!"
,Spartanus,2011-02-25T15:55Z,"Fuck, when will you stop with the RARs already, man?!!!"
,starryix,2011-02-25T16:38Z,"agreed;
please avoid rar uploads, it's really useless..

but anyway, thanks for the upload!"
,miki85,2011-02-26T09:57Z,Yeah! Thanks so much for the upload!
,toxicvat0,2011-02-28T18:50Z,"Thanx for the up!
And STFU! With the fucking ""Why do you RAR"" bullshit. Putting files in RAR has some benefits, maybe not to you, but who gives a flying fuck about your wining fucks.  Just be happy for this great up!"

The downside of using rars is that in order to both be able to watch the show and seed it to others you need to keep two copies of the show - one unrared and one rared.

Even though discspace is quite cheap many won't bother with it and the end result is that fewer people seed the show. To me that's an apparent donwside - How about you?"
