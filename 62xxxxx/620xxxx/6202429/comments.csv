,Generiz64,2011-07-09T04:51Z,"Downloaded and extracted into my VirtualDJ install folder, but none of it shows up when I open the program. Any ideas?"
,D0G5KIN,2011-07-09T13:47Z,"I dont know. you might have put them in the wrong install folder. the folder you copy into should have a bunch of other folders in it named cache, devices, languages, mappers playlist, plugins, sampler etc. just copy, paste and replace. My installation folder is in the my documents folder."
