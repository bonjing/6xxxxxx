                Dream a Little Dream.
                Sitcom about slack admin workers at a law firm. Kenny
                is back from a week on tour with the band for which
                he does photos and flyers. Tania has missed him, but
                Asif has missed him more. Tania has planned a
                motivational exercise involving hats and five-year
                life plans which puts the fear into Kenny. Tania
                wants everyone to think about their dreams for the
                future, but Shelley can only think about her
                recurring nightmare featuring household chores.
                Darrel's life plan involves replacing Tania as
                postroom supervisor.
