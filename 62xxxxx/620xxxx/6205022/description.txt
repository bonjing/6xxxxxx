This book has been published fifteen years ago in the United States, at a
time when the Black Movement was reaching a new phase in the century-old
struggle for freedom. It created a huge scandal and all the resources of the Zion-
ist lobby were directed against this book, to destroy it in order to keep the Afro-
Americans under the traditional yoke of submissiveness to the interest of the
Jewish community, a situation which had become obvious to all in the US.
The controversy, the important role played by The Nation of Islam in the
liberation struggle of the Black Men, did not spill over in Europe. We brought
back the book from Chicago but failed, at the time, to procure the funding for a
translation and a publication in Europe's languages. The time was not ripe. The
liberation forces were divided and weak. But the craving for freedom was sim-
mering among the oppressed. Slowly, bit by bit, a Black Liberation Movement
rose up again. Particularly in France, it has reached a stage where it plays a
political role. 

Traditional political forces, and particulalrly, traditional enemies 
of freedom are lauching offensives, one after the other, to gain control over this
new-born potential political giant, while it is still in infancy. We have reached a
situation where the book penned by the Research Department of the Nation of
Islam has become an urgent political necessity in the struggle to maintain the
independence of the Freedom Movement. This made us bold enough to put on-
line the original book and decide to translate it. There is no other material possibility to spread the book around in our region. The translation will be put online
as soon as it becomes available.
