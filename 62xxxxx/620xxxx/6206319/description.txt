[1983] 
The Golden Thread that the great British defence attorney, Horace Rumpole, refers to is an inalienable presumption in British Common Law, that any individual brought before the bar for judgement has a presumption of innocence in his/her favour, i.e. that we are all presumed innocent until we are proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to twelve good people true (our peers). This holds whether in Old Bailey, or the wilds of darkest Africa--wherever the British system of justice has taken root and grown. Rumpole is a loveable old curmudgeon, writing his memoirs about cases he has tried before the Bar. There are six stories in this book: 

Rumpole and the Genuine Article, where a painting's genuine nature is in dispute;
Rumpole and the Golden Thread, where he goes to a former British colony in Africa to see justice done;
Rumpole and the Old Boy Net, about a "friendly house" and a charge of blackmail;
Rumpole and the Female of the Species, where he uses manipulation to get a young girl barrister hired in their Chambers; 
Rumpole and the Sporting Life, where he defends the said barrister's sister, who is charged with murdering her husband, a successful and well-loved jockey;
Rumpole and the Last Resort, wherein he is broke, and left by his wife Hilda (whom he calls She Who Must Be Obeyed); he collapses in court while pleading a case, and the aftermath.

* Bill Wallis is my favourite Rumpole narrator.
