,RenegadeNtv,2011-03-17T00:55Z,What do you expect when its a camera recording a big ass screen. Of course its not going to be good quality. Froggie has no obligation to upload anything but does so because he/she likes to. So get over it or go fuck yourself.
,skip79,2011-03-17T10:02Z,"RenegadeNtv, some people want to know the quality, and telling them off will only discourage postings.  "

==== That is, if you aren't smart  ====
==== enough to predict this shit.  ====

It was Tuesday evening. $5 movie night. Me and the guys from work had nothing better to do, so we went ahead and decided to watch this. I had not seen a preview of the movie. They said, ""the characters have super powers."" And I was like ""I'm in!"" 

So anyways. The movie opens with a murder. So I was like ""alright!"" But then the whole first half of the movie turns into a teen angst flick. It was hilariously cheesy. However, in the second half of the movie, the action starts to pick up.

I'm pretty sure the writer was like. ""You know what? I don't like school. I especially disliked high school. Let's make a movie of terrorists blowing up a school."" Then the director said, ""this movie is supposed to appeal to the younger demographic, so lets throw in some super powers, and aliens, and slowlight pulse lasers, and romance. THEN we can blow up the school."" And that's what they did.

The whole premise of the movie was just so that they could depict a school turning to dust.

And I felt really really sorry for the dog. The characters just left it by itself, surrounded by enemies. And they didn't even say ""thank you"" when it saves their lives. Therefore this movie promotes a culture of ingratitude.

Anyways, no matter the situation the protagonist is in, he develops his powers in the nick of time to save himself.

Also, he is so okay with his ignorance. I mean, really? He isn't even a little bit curious?

The movie has some gaping holes, like if regular American bullets are more effective (and faster = undodgeable) than the lasers, why do the people keep using the lasers? ESPECIALLY if the ammunition is so friggin' volatile?

In conclusion, if you are DRUNK, you will enjoy this movie much more than a sober person. Additionally, you should watch the second half if you want to see a BADASS dog tear a friggin' BAT's throat out.

If you have no one to commiserate with, then all you can do is admire how well they did the special effects. They are actually done pretty well.

,zingo_punkbuzter,2011-04-07T07:30Z,"ty for upload!

@ ViggeDigge

that's why this one is called TS, n00b
if you see the name with CAM / TS / Telesync / R5, then it is recorded with a portable device such as a recording camera.

so stop spreading your worthless comments please!

i'm downloading this right now and i'll write my own review about how i experienced this quality for a cam version! since this one is not yet released on BluRay you shuld rethink how small your chances are that you find this in HD.
and there for i'll share what i think of this within the area of cam-quality, and not judge it to be in bad shape because it's recorded.

you shuld be thanking froggie100 for uploading uploading this, and appritiate the work of the individual that had to take serious risks to share this with you!"
