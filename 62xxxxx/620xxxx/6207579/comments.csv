[T],trialNerror,2011-03-01T05:27Z,"Thanks for the heads up, but CRAP!  That wasn't posted when this was uploaded.  Those sneaky bass turds with Travel Channel and GA are starting to tick me off with their inconsistent spur of the moment episode listings for this season.  "
,claytona57,2011-03-05T02:50Z,"Thanks
Episodes 21 & 22 are not from Season 4 but are the start of Season 5."
[T],trialNerror,2011-03-05T04:40Z,"Season 5 doesn't begin until this Fall.  According to TV.com TVRage, and Wiki, there's still that oddball last minute upcoming final *knock on wood* episode airing on the 18th.

There should be way more seeders that what I'm seeing in uTorrent.  Anybody that has been following along and getting the episodes could just rename them to match this and viola, you're a seeder.  Episode 22 of this bundle is a standard def version and not the later released HD version, though."
,claytona57,2011-03-05T06:50Z,"Well I checked out a few others sites and wiki says that it's Season 5-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_adventures#Season_5
According to iTunes it's also Season 5.

Ghost Adventures has had back to back Seasons in the past.  I know that for a fact as I been following them from the very first season along with purchasing each episodes on iTunes, and I even met Zack, Nick, & Arron in person during the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, West Virgina. 
Still this is an awesome show and thanks for the upload.  "
[T],trialNerror,2011-03-06T02:24Z,"According to that wiki link, E17 thru E22 are Season 5.  I thought Season 4 was done a while ago, but then they kept announcing a new episode every couple of weeks, so it got really confusing as to what was part of which season.  Travel Channel's own website doesn't even mention a Season 4, it's still saying Season 3.  I can't argue about who is right about where the season ended and another began because every source seems to have a different answer.  

I did come across this petition to get GAC into the White House, though!

[T],trialNerror,2011-03-06T04:26Z,"After a bit more sharing there is now 50 seeders (DHT & Peer Exchange included) as of now for this GA season collection.  

Thank you all so much for your help with continuing this torrent while I focus all my resources towards sharing that massive 62.5 GiB Ghost Hunters torrent!

,hammadsen,2011-03-10T19:03Z,Super nice... Thanks
,mcmolly,2011-06-17T03:40Z,big fan of u trial but have to ask due to experience with GH season-packs: how is the quality? 
,dudz17,2011-06-27T10:28Z,There are more than 22 eps in this season.
,T3HPWnEr3R,2011-11-07T00:30Z,This is actually an incomplete season 4. Missing episodes 23-27. Thanks for the share tho!
