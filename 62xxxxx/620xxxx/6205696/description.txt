This is the video of Bodom's new single entitled Was It Worth It? Not the best video around but the song's pretty fun. It was uploaded to only one place and then removed but someone else got it and I got it from them so I'm sharing it here. The video is in mp4 (iTunes) format. If you need help playing it, try using VLC Player.
