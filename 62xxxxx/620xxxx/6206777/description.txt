In the province of undivided Bengal lies the      
sleepy, peaceful port of Chittagong. In this      
unassuming little town a revolution is about to   
begin; a revolution which will forever wake all of
Chittagong and inspire the entire nation.         
A band of 64 - 56 innocent yet fearless young boys
defiant revolutionaries, 2 determined young women,
and an idealistic leader - Surjya Sen, a school   
by profession.                                    
This group of 64 represents a little-known      
chapter in history; a forgotten night that      
reigned terror on the British forgotten heroes  
and the narrative takes us through every step of
the action....
