The wave length is merealy 5 inches but the strength has to be very high so about 2 thousand volts are applied to megnatron to generate this wave and released in to the cavity. And it vanishes instantly the moment you turn the power off. There is no danger eating the cooked food what so ever. All you have to do is make sure there is no leak of microwaves outside it's cavity. It's very safe, I think this guy is an Idiot, trying to scare innocent people."
