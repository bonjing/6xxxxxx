This is Full HD bootleg video,that I shot on Canon PowerShot SX-1. This is new format AVCHD,that you can open in DaemonTools and play on your computer,or burn on DVD 4.7 GB,and play on Blu-ray player. On Playstation 3 you will play only files with no menu. My LG Blu-ray drive (writer)plays this from DVD very well. I have no Blu-ray player (stand alone),and I can not garantee succes. To play this get DaemonTools including in torrent. To burn this on DVD get ImgBurn also there. Nero is not good for this. Songs: CREEPING DEATH FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS disposable heroes fade to black cyanide SAD BUT TRUE WELCOME HOME(SANITARIUM) BATTERY nothing else matters seek&destroy small letters = incomplete songs sound is perfect DVD resolution 720x480 is not good for big screens, this AVCHD 1920x1080 is much better. Enjoy
