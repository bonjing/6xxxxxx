  message was read incorrectly.

  quitting the game.

New features/balancing

- Added camera shaking effects.
- Added Xinput gamepad rumble.
- Fixed the duration and range of spray type spells.
- Improved Gun's tracer bullets.
- Reworked keyboard and mouse controller configuration.

Known Issues

- Network uplink bandwidth, while improved, can be demanding.
- Steam attempts to install XNA framework every time game is launched 
  or rare occasion.
- Characters can in rare cases fall through the level collision mesh, 
  this is due to lag or   poor framerate. Many general network improvements 
  and general optimization will reduce this risk.
- The game may appear to be stuttering even though framerate is good.
