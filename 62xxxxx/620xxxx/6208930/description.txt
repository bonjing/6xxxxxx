Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 by HAZARD (RUS/ENG) 2011
Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6 by HAZARD (RUS/ENG) 2011 | 4.46 GB

New build on the team Hazard. If we compare with the previous version, this guys refused to include a huge number of patches and fixes to the standard installation. Confidently declare that AMD processors are supported.
When you mount the image, please do not be afraid of missing files, they are just hidden. All statements regarding the possibility of installing only the intel quite thoroughly tested on AMD Athlon 64 x2, MSI K9N nForse 520. In the assembly, there is only one core, this legacy kernel 10,6, but it fully enough, the installation went smoothly and without problems, for which many thanks to developers who have revised their approach to the creation of assemblies, and did not include the extra stuff in a standard installation.
