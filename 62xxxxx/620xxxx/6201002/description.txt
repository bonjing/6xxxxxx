Creating quite a buzz from â€˜Hold onto Hope Loveâ€™ receiving the PeaceDriven music award to releasing her 4th project of all original music, to ABC and CW using her songs to capture poignant television moments,  Amy Stroup's spacious melodies, and care to lyric communicate beyond places only words can reach.  As an independent artist, Stroup has had her latest songs placed on major network TV stations from ABCâ€™s Private Practice, Brothers & Sisters, Castle, the CWâ€™s One Tree Hill, MTV's World of Jenks and most recently 'Backed into the Corner' was featured on the season premier of Grey's Anatomy. She is active in the local songwriting community in Nashville, writing songs for artists, tv, and film, often collaborating with Trent Dabbs, Mary Hooper and other songwriters as well as writing solo.  Stroup is also active touring in the US and abroad most recently Australia. Further, he has a desire to use her music to inspire others to positive action as she partners with Mocha Club and a non profit geared towards college student mobilization dedicated to bringing hope in Africa through education, clean water projects, food distribution.

QUOTES:::
"Amy Stroup has what is a rarity among most people doing music but common for all great artists that make a real impact - unique artistry  that is immediately identifiable. That special something that cuts through the noise. I've been a fan since the first song." 
- Nathan Chapman- Grammy Award Winning Producer Taylor Swift

â€œAmyâ€™s music is interesting, lyrically compelling, and musically fresh. Plus she is an incredible singer and performer.  Her view of the world as a songwriter is unique and optimistic, vulnerable and strong. â€œ 
- Jody Williams- BMI NASHVILLE

â€œAmy is one of the most talented independent singer/songwriters working in Nashville today.  She stunned me performing live on our Nashville Sunday Night broadcast and as I investigated her recordings, I found gems like "Hold On To Hope Love," "I Fell For You" and "I'm In," which should all be hits.â€
