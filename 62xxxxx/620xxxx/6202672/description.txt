                New series of the comedy set at a Spanish holiday
                resort. With Troy at home looking after his ill
                father, Gavin has a new holiday companion in the form
                of his salon employee Kenneth. The Garveys arrive to
                stay with Madge at her villa, only to find that it
                has been sold to Cilla Black - and Madge is nowhere
                to be found. Mateo is introduced to his new colleague
                Les/Lesley, who has a few surprises up his/her
                sleeve. Meanwhile, Les/Lesley's son Liam is besotted
                by Natalie - but her friend Sam has other ideas.
