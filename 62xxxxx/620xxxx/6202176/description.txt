WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


   Version 4.00 beta 7

   1. Bugs fixed:

      a) "Prediction order", "Memory to use" and "Channels" fields
         in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog, "Lowest allowed ratio"
         in archive conversion dialog, "recovery volumes" field in archiving
         dialog did not provide enough space to enter maximum values allowed
         for these parameters. Now the width of these controls is increased.

Beginning from WinRAR 3.50, you can install themes listed in http://www.rarlab.com/themes.htm
