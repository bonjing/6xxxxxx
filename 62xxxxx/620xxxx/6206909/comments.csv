[T],locobot12,2011-02-28T18:20Z,"@donx009

If u already applied a valid license in ur previous install u cannot use this crack ...
it will screw up the soft!!

U have to unistall previous one remove directory , clean reg and then apply crack...
follow instructions carefully!!

USE ONLY ONE - EITHER CRACK  OR ANY VALID LICENSE U MIGHT HAVE !!"
,Fanatika,2011-03-01T01:39Z,"@loco What do you mean exactly with ""Don't download languages through avast (it will render the license invalid)!""? So installing a language specific version (like setup_av_pro_dut.exe) won't work?"
[T],locobot12,2011-03-01T02:00Z,"@Fanatika

In ur case yes it will work !!

Just make sure u dont download any avast language packs after u copy paste the crack into the installation directory !!

Do u get my point?"
,Zeptinune,2011-03-01T09:31Z,"Doesn't work.

Couldn't disable the program entirely even after deactivating self protection module.

Went into Safe mode and did it like suggested in the instructions.

Then followed instructions and Avast has caught on to the botched file. Says that the licenese will expire in 10 days, they gave me the chance to get the whole thing for just 30â‚¬ instead of 50â‚¬. A HUGE discount.

So I graciously accepted. It's always been Avast's policy to offer hackers a 'second chance' deal in the hopes they'll purchase the software if it's cheaper than normal.

Downloading the FULL release version now. If anything I would just try this to get the 37% discount on the price. Then buy the full thing and be happy for a year.

Especially since this crack DOES NOT WORK and Avast has caught on very quickly to it...

I tried the Anti-Virus version as well but the discount was still the same. 30â‚¬ so I might as well just got the discount for the full version with the Firewall etc.

I'm happy with the full release version now and 365 days of protection left. It's cheaper than Kaspersky was and 1,000,000 times better."
[T],locobot12,2011-03-01T12:47Z,"@zeptinune

[T],locobot12,2011-04-12T22:52Z,"@syndicatedverdict 

Dont bother with taking the license out and stuff ... its tough to do it perfectly !

just redownload the crack only from this torrent again 

Judging by ur comments i am pretty sure u have screwed up really big somewhere!

The best solution is to uninstall , reboot , remove the avast folder from c:/program files 
and then reinstall !
Folow step by step carefully -
After u do that just reboot if u cant apply crack .. after rebooting -

1)Uncheck self-defense module from settings ... it very important!

2)Kill AvastUI.exe process fom task manager !
3)Stop avast services through sevices tab in task manager. 
4)Now copy the crack , paste it in the avast folder replacing the original one !

Once done just Reboot ! subscription should be auto-activated to 2050!!

If u cant paste crack , try using msconfig method  
-
1) GO TO ""START MENU"" AND TYPE ""msconfig""
2) AFTER THAT, CLICK ""Startup"" TAB
3) LOOK FOR AVAST IN THE LIST
(I am not sure what is the name for Avast in 
the list.)
4) THEN,""Disable"" AVAST BY CLICKING THE BOX
BESIDE IT.
5) CLICK ""Apply"" BUTTON.
6) RE-START YOUR COMPUTER.
7) DO THE CRACK!!

AFTER Pasting CRACK, 
ENABLE BACK AVAST USING THE ""msconfig"" >> ""Startup"">>""Enable Avast"">>Apply,
Restart again, then connect to the internet and start you avast!!

This should work if done right !!!!

For some people after installing internet is being blocked by avast in that case -

go to settings > Troubleshooting > redirect settings and clear all the Http ports -

,syndicatedverdict,2011-04-13T05:44Z,@jknice: The Program Update should be on Manual Update but the Engine and Virus Definitions would be better on Automatic Update.

**This activation is very easy. You just have to read and understand all the instructions given below:-

1. After you installed Avast 6.0.1000, restart your Pc and you must start your pc at ""safe mode"". To do that, hold on f8 during restarting your windows.

2. On safe mode, copy the crack ashBase.dll and past [Copy and Replace] it to the directory where you installed Avast. [Default directory:- C\Program Files

3. Now restart your pc normally [not in safe mode.]

**Never try to update Avast PROGRAM as the crack is only for Avast 6.0.1000 Internet Security.**

4. Now connect to internet. Open AvastUI.exe and go to MAINTANANCE>Subscription, and click on ""Active trial period"".

,LordOptix,2011-09-21T20:07Z,Also to note I have not got that popup again so I am assuming it was a scare tactic :P
,LordOptix,2011-09-21T20:13Z,Close the windows and it will stop saying its illegal. Activation still works.
,Peter_apika,2011-09-22T05:35Z,@LordOptix so basically after the 6th restart the popup will disappear? but thanks for telling about the popup. :)
,styjt13,2011-09-22T10:06Z,"@ locobot12: I did install avast as per the instruction, worked smooth for 10-15 days & now suddenly it shows a display; ""This is not legal copy, Buy Avast with 75% discount"" The subscription page shows valid till 2050, shield is active too..What I have done wrong ??"
,cooleyes,2011-09-22T10:59Z,SAYING ILLEGAL TORRENT. Installed1 week back working fine today got a new window opened and it showed me ILLEGAL TORRENT BY AVAST. plz tell me wat to do. thank you............

,majken_1337,2011-09-23T11:31Z,Idag har hela Virusskyddet satts ur spel. Today has the whole Avast shutdown....
,majken_1337,2011-09-23T12:13Z,"Din jävla Bedragare.... Mitt nätverkskort inaktiverades o strulade, sen avinstallerade jag AVAST då funkade det direkt. Antingen kommer du med en lösning eller förklaring nu, eller så är du en bedragare!"
,64base,2011-09-23T12:22Z,"It says that its the pirated version but everything works, im just not sure if my computer is protected or not."
,64base,2011-09-23T12:28Z,"Just to verify: the message saying that this is an ""illegal copy"" is a scare tactic (as said above). I purposely ran into two virus infected sites and I can verify Avast has blocked the sites for my safety, I did the same to a virus infected file and it automatically deleted the file. SO EVERYTHING WORKS FINE. If you want to test Avast is still protecting your computer (which it is) visit:

,stramon,2011-09-23T18:11Z,"Yeah, I also think it's just a scare tactic. although everytime i login to windows it shows that message. But everything seems to be working just fine!"
,RPD_STARS,2011-09-24T23:03Z,"Ya same here, I actually updated the program and the warning went away all together but it still works fine..."
,stramon,2011-09-26T00:30Z,"Today my avast stopped working. It says: Your system is not fully protected!
It's time to find a new antivirus software until somebody finds a way to crack this one :("
,gelo3593,2011-09-26T09:21Z,"This caused me BSOD, I already use this for months, but when the illegal thingy shows up, its the time i got bsod, I didnt figure out until I download bsod viewer, and I saw that the plugin by avast is causing it. So, better find a new anti virus >."
,swinburne,2011-09-27T15:09Z,dude the aswsp.sys is causing a bsod.......real messed up....its a avast error so no point in using this shit anymore....have to move on to another one....cheers.
,chronaholic420,2011-10-01T03:23Z,Works for me I used to get pop up I uninstalled reinstalled have'nt got one since
,corbinknight,2011-10-02T15:20Z,My computer is saying something's wrong with avast. Is anyone else getting this too?
,baneksbaneks,2011-10-12T22:54Z,I've done everything how it says in the readme file and it's still in trial mode!
,dman12345,2011-11-04T19:40Z,i downloaded this months ago          worked perfect          up until nov 1st and all of a sudden     avast stopped working     and my licence went from 2050 to expired        it froze my comp        unistalled        i think avast have sussed it out but got another version of avast till 2038
,aarushxx,2012-04-15T07:29Z,Hi locobot my pc has lots of viruses and when i click avast .exe it starts and stop within the custom installation part and when i tried to run it in safe mode my pc says that safe mode cannot be open. please tell what should i do.
,tamanjiri,2012-04-18T00:48Z,"early this morning, avast warned me that i have an illegal copy of Avast! Internet Security.

it says:
""Your Avast! Internet Security is illegal and will be shut down.""

is it alright to continue this hack or it is advisable to uninstall?

here's a site where you can see the screenshot.

,tamanjiri,2012-04-18T12:25Z,"regarding my post above, later this afternoon the same ""warning"" came up after my virus definitions have been updated..
i guess, a ""warning"" would pop-up whenever the virus definitions will be updated..

this avast is working perfectly aside from the ""warning"" that pop's up after updating the virus definitions..

will further report if something comes up.."
,greatyu,2012-04-20T16:55Z,"the illegal version warning, is a tactic to scare us??
can't be too sure of that. anyways if the warning appears, without clicking the ""shut down"" button, it's better to click the ""X"" instead.
but our auto-updates might cause problems in the future"
,Kronos666,2012-05-21T17:48Z,"This no longer works. Installing is fine, no malware, works fine for 2 days. After that, warning messages are displayed that it is not legit software. "
,ttroll666,2012-05-23T02:55Z,"win7 32 it brought my computer to it's knees, and would not install correctly and was a mess, just a warning"
,Carrot_Bottom,2012-06-02T15:47Z,"It's bee a months since i got it. The illegal download message come up roughly 6 times a day. Now, 1 month after installation, there is a new message saying it has run out. So basically this is a 1 month trail, NOT a full package. Steer clear."
