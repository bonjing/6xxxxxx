,FKoops,2011-03-10T10:39Z,"So.. you're saying that this runs the same as tiny7, and even better as Framework goes?
OK I'll give it a try."
,FKoops,2011-03-11T09:05Z,why is it twice as large compared to Tiny7?
,hamsyh,2011-03-11T13:56Z,"Fkoops, i believe because it is SP1 and there are not so many components removed like in Tiny7. I prefer Tiny7 also, but i need net framework so this is the best solution i could have found. "
,naith_kk,2011-03-17T09:42Z,tried this version and it seemed to create problems installing a HP printer. Tiny7 didn't have that issue. I'm assuming printer options are removed from this build?
