"Intro to Political Science"

As the school prepares for the Vice President's 
visit, Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) organizes the 
first student elections. Annie (Alison Brie), 
who is determined to win, is pitted in a tough 
battle against Jeff (Joel McHale), Leonard 
(Richard Erdman) and Star Burns (Dino 
Stamatopoulos). Meanwhile, Abed (Danny Pudi) 
has noticed the secret service agents casing 
the school and develops a clandestine 
friendship with special agent Robin Vohlers 
(Eliza Coupe "Scrubs").

Enjoy :)
