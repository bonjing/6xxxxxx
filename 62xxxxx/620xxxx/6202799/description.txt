Dervish are a traditional Irish music group from County Sligo, Ireland. They were formed in 1989 by Liam Kelly, Shane Mitchell, Martin McGinley, Brian McDonagh and Michael Holmes. The band was originally formed to record an album of local music which was later released as â€œThe Boys of Sligoâ€. They later formed Dervish. The name was chosen as it relates to groups of spiritual people who are enraptured by music.History

In 1991 the band were joined by Roscommon-born singer Cathy Jordan and all-Ireland champion fiddle player Shane McAleer. Dervishâ€™s first album, â€œHarmony Hillâ€, was released in 1992 to critical success. In 1994 their second album, â€œPlaying with Fireâ€, was released and reached number 1 in the Irish Folk Music and international World/Roots music charts. In 1996 Dervish released â€œAt the End of the Dayâ€, which won the Hot Press Folk Album of the Year Award.

Their fourth album, â€œLive in Palmaâ€, was recorded in front of a live audience at Palma de Majorca's Theatre Principal in April 1997 and received critical acclaim. In the same year the readers of Irish Music Magazine awarded Dervish Best Overall Trad/Folk Band of the Year. In 1998 Shane McAleer left the band and was replaced by well-known Sligo musician, SÃ©amus O'Dowd and All-Ireland Champion fiddle player Tom Morrow from County Leitrim. The seven piece line-up were now Cathy Jordan (vocals, bodhrÃ¡n, bones), Tom Morrow (fiddle, viola), Shane Mitchell (accordion), Liam Kelly (flute, low whistle), SÃ©amus O'Dowd (guitars, harmonica), Michael Holmes (bouzouki) and Brian McDonagh (mandola, mandolin). Dervish's fifth album, â€œMidsummer's Nightâ€, released in 1999, was voted Irish Trad Album of the Year.

In 2001 Dervish released â€œDecadeâ€, a compilation of tracks from their first five albums. In 2003 they released â€œSpiritâ€, followed by â€œA Healing Heartâ€ in 2006.

In 2003 Sligo City Council bestowed the Freedom of the Borough of Sligo on the band for their international artistic achievements and their dedication to and promotion of their local heritage.

In 2005 The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Mr Bertie Ahern invited Dervish to accompany him on an Irish trade mission to China. In 2006 Dervish accompanied Irish President Mary McAleese on her State Visits to Latvia and Lithuania and performed a special concert in the Great Hall of Latvia Society House in Riga for President McAleese and President Vike-Freiberga of Latvia. On 24 May they will give a concert in Vilnius in honour of President Adamkus of Lithuania.

On November 14, 2006, the Irish national broadcaster RTÃ‰ announced that Dervish were to perform the Irish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Dervish finished last with five points, awarded to them from the Albanian back up jury due to a failed televote, for their performance of "They Can't Stop The Spring".

In October 2007 Dervish released â€œTravelling Showâ€, partly produced by John Reynolds.




This DVD is from a show from 1996 when Dervish was promoting their second CD, "Playing With Fire". Nine of the tunes and songs are from that CD. The other five are from "Harmony Hill". It is very nicely taped and quite enjoyable. 

Here is the group line-up at that time: 

Cathy Jordan - vocals, bodhrÃ¡n, bones 
Liam Kelly - flute 
Shane Mitchell - accordian 
Shane McAleer - fiddle 
Brian McDonagh - mandola, mandolin 
Michael Holmes - bouzouki
