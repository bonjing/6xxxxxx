,jon4fun,2011-02-26T15:30Z,"@ [-] minus voter - FUCK OFF shithead. We all know it is the same person on every 20-40 torrent. If you haven't the balls to stand up and be countedd by saying 'WHY' then you don't get to just vote [-].

Just wondering if you will be doing the Razzies (if they air) and the Oscars?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-26T18:12Z,"Thanks.

@DMVIN: It is tradition, but Razzies were never officially aired and captured, I think that best way should be YouTube or similar web-online source."

,ankit280,2011-02-26T22:17Z,"Thanks for Spartacus and Fringe
One thing I wanna ask -and pardon my ignorance i am new to these things- when you write requests on hold, does that mean you are taking requests? 
coz you write 'requests frozen' when you aren't taking them right?
If yes can you do Boondock Saints 1 & 2?
Thanks in advance"

[V],twentyforty,2011-02-27T07:59Z,"@ankit280: ""On hold"" has same meaning as in phone conversation (when someone puts you ""on hold"" on telephone you can still talk in handset, however - but it doesn't look promising). I decided to use it instead of ""Frozen"" as that has no effect at all and was too ""enigmatic"" for most people here. Ahem....

Both Boondocks has been done in past six months, but torrents are dead for sure. No plans for redoing..."
