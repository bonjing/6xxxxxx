If you want the torrent to stay active for as long as possible drop the rar files."
,YuMaNuMa,2011-02-26T14:13Z,I guess this guy is just filling in for TVteam. Hope he uploads the files in MKV format.

0 seeds using Vuze."

Besides someone thinks they're funny, WTF is up with the name of the rar parts ?"
