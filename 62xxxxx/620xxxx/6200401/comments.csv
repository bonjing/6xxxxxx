,fox1990,2011-03-19T06:00Z,"@ tyler.. if you want to upload a pdf, what you first must do is create a torrent file out of it. If you have a mac, transmission is really the only torrent client that will allow you to do this. Otherwise, try out bittorrent. You go to ""Create a torrent"" file and create a torrent file of the file you want to put up here...then make sure its at 100%...upload the torrent here, delete the original torrent file in your torrent client, and reload the downloaded version...make sure it registers that you already have the file, so that you can begin seeding ... Hope that helps! Feel free to comment on my torrents if you need more help...or google it."
