PS2 GAME WITH 28 OLD SCHOOL GENESIS GAMES IN ONE.  PUT THIS ONE UP BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE HAS.  I CAN SEE WHY AS YOU COULD JUST GET A GENESIS EMULATOR AND PLAY THESE GAMES LIKE THAT.  I GUESS THIS IS MORE FOR THOSE WHO COLLECT LIKE I DO OR FOR THOSE WHO PLAY WITH A MODDED SYSTEM.

I AM OFF AND ON ALL DAY SO ITS SPOTTY.  HOWEVER I LEAVE IT ON WHILE I'M ASLEEP SO FROM 10PM TO 10AM PACIFIC THIS WILL BE CONSTANTLY SEEDED.

PEACE
