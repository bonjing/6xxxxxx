Stop making these with hard coded subs its so damn annoying, i take the time toi download 6.5gb worth of movie and then having it be ruined from stupid subs, whats the point of having spnish or what ever the hell subs they r, the torrent says english subs as texted language well whoever uploaded doesnt know what english is.....

however the quality is good so if u want it with hardcoded subs that r in some other language thats i dont know german maybe then this is for you"
[T],User_01,2011-08-20T16:36Z,"It's nothing hard-coded into the movie. You can easily disable the romanian sub and choose the english one. 
And if i don't know english, i guess you don't too, since it clearly says what subs the movie has:
""Subtitles............: English,Romanian""
(if there isn't written in the top description is because there's no option for that when uploading the torrent.) And if i want them to be with romanian sub is just because i wanted to be so, period.
For the ""i take the time"" part, if you are so lazy, don't. And if you were a smart person you'll be knowing there's a simple way to get the subs out of there in just a few minutes: http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/

I NEVER UPLOADED A HI-RES MOVIE WITH HARD CODED SUB(S)! (just soft-coded, which can be ""removed"", in just minutes.) And if i make a mistake by saying this, and i did upload one with hard-coded sub (which i don't think i did) it's just because it (the file) was created from the start that way.

Now, maybe you know the difference between hard-coded (you can't disable it) and soft-coded (you can disable it)"
