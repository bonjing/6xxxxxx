While Dave Chappelle's sketch comedy series on Comedy Central made him into a major star, he's also one of America's best standup comics, and has been honing his skills on the road for years. Chappelle returns to the stage in this special produced for the Showtime premium cable network, in which he offers up his sharply pointed opinions about a wide range of subjects. Dave Chappelle: For What It's Worth features Dave sounding off on race, sex, justice, his own success, his fans, and much more.
