~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Speed Painting Vol.2 | 91 pages | PDF | 78.6 MB~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
***********************************************************************************

Our brand new 91 page e-book is a collection of "Speed Painting" tutorials which have been created by some of the top digital painters today. The idea behind this tutorial series was for the artist to interpret a one line descriptive brief (provided by 3D Total!) create a speed painting from it and then produce a tutorial showing and explaining each stage of production of the artwork. This download-able PDF e-book can be followed in most 2-D software packages that support paintbrushes and layers.
