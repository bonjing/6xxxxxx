Once again the gods spread the cheeks and ram cock in fucking ass!"
,SwTc-klupido,2011-03-15T17:55Z,"6 episodes?
and that's the whole season?"
,vhg,2011-03-24T11:33Z,let me try this
,OGTiago,2011-04-11T03:45Z,"This is a prequel to season 1 as season 2 was delayed several times as one of the main actors had cancer or some shit. 

6 episodes yes."
,DemosCat,2011-04-17T22:04Z,"Andy Whitfield, the guy who plays Spartacus, is the actor who has non-Hodgkin lymphoma.   Starz produced this pre-Spartacus prequel as a stop-gap until Andy could return.

Andy was treated, his cancer went into remission, he began to train for Season 2.  Now the cancer is back, and a replacement will have to be found to play Spartacus."
,freespirit_10,2011-04-26T17:04Z,"Demoscat, your 100% correct. That is exactly what is happening. And for everyone else, you should research the facts before you start smashing them for only having 6 episodes or what ever your troubles are. The poor guy and his family are going through a very difficuly time and he is a amazing actor who is suffering, but as usual everyone is out for themselves....Thanks for the upload guys, great as always."
,ferretur,2011-04-27T22:55Z,"I've just registered so I can chime in, how rude can some people be... I had Non-Hodgkins at the age of 20 and believe me I wished many times during my treatment just to simply not wake up... Luckily I went into remission and I've been fine since. Andy Whitfield is going through this for the 2nd time & you're bothered about a bloody TV series... Yeah Blood & Sand was excellent but why the rush for another series, it'll come when everyones fit & ready.
......PATIENCE"
,ossisfleeting,2011-05-02T00:29Z,shut up about your cancer you pussies and comment on the quality of the audio and video

,cakesale,2011-06-21T21:40Z,"Thanks uploader, I am sorry to hear about the actor with cancer. I heard this season was very good. "
,itzmee,2011-06-25T12:45Z,"oasisfleeting, I hope you develop the most painful cancer possible."

Video 9.5

Thank you for the upload, was lucky to find this BEFORE watching Spartacus - Blood And Sand. (As Gods of the Arena seems to be a prequel to this series). Have not enjoyed a series so much in a VERY long time. Can't wait for the follow up in 2012. (Check out IMDB for more info). Again thank you EXTREMEZONE, awesome torrent. "
,useitright,2011-09-05T19:14Z,"hey ossisfleeting,  your a sad excuse for a human being.  You do not  deserve to be able  to download  this or anything.  I hope you and your computer get a fatal virus."
,moderhuske,2011-09-06T13:23Z,"Hey does someone upload the full blu ray version with the extended edition episodes of this or blood and sand please i need it, cant find it"
,moderhuske,2011-09-06T21:14Z,"hello does someone pleasse upload the extended episodes , i cant find it , it comes with the blu ray  dvd , idk if gods of the arena's blu ray is released but blood and sand is..

,moderhuske,2011-09-06T21:14Z,"hello does someone pleasse upload the extended episodes , i cant find it , it comes with the blu ray  dvd , idk if gods of the arena's blu ray is released but blood and sand is..
PLEASE UPLOAD EXTENDED, MANY LOVE"
,useitright,2011-09-13T22:41Z,"I do not know how many people know it, but Andy Whitfield has succumbed to his cancer.  He has passed away, and I doubt anyone will be able to take over his role and do as good as a job as he did.  Moreover, he has left loved ones behind that I am sure could give a crap about the show, but are so saddened at the loss of a husband and a father.  He was a great actor, and  it will be hard for someone to assume his role and do anywhere near as good as he did.  
R.I.P. -- Spartacus"
,jan765,2011-09-22T19:32Z,"Good torrent.

@useitright.
Wow. I just found out! R.I.P. I can't believe he passed away 9/11. Great actor! But wow wtf o_O I didn't know its so surprising."
,Allokazam,2011-09-29T10:02Z,RIP Andy Whitfield. Brilliant Actor. He will be missed. The show wont be the same without him. My heart goes out to his family and friends. I hope they pay some kind of homage to him in season 2 out of respect.
,lunawolfe,2011-10-03T01:11Z,excellent as always extreme. will seed this one for awhile
,halosinfire,2011-12-17T08:01Z,"great upload, thanks extremezone"

,edwardsb704,2012-02-07T03:32Z,RIP Andy Whitefield!!!! We will miss you in Spartacus Vengeance.
,deejay410,2012-03-12T06:13Z,Excellent download. Thanks uploader!

Great Torrent! Thanks!"
,ironymon,2012-05-09T06:59Z,"Damnit, why do good actors always die so young.. Heath, Andy (which is also similar to my name) ffs. I just hope they find their peace in the afterlife, which is absolutely non existent, just a metaphor."
,ironymon,2012-05-09T07:00Z,Because anything we say is to comfort the living whom friends and relatives or just known people has passed away. HAAAAHAHAHAH sRY dOuBlE pOsT
