Storyine: A drama centered on three people who are haunted by mortality in different ways. George (Damon) is a blue-collar American who has a special connection to the afterlife. On the other side of the world, Marie (de France), a French journalist, has a near-death experience that shakes her reality.

Each on a path in search of the truth, their lives will intersect, forever changed by what they believe might-or must-exist in the hereafter.
