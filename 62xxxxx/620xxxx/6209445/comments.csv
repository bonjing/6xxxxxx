Also Amadis video converter works great at converting most video files that ""don't play"" to a new readable file format. Get Amadis off tpb tho, definately NOT the demo version. I hope this helps the NOOBs"

,SHRUDE,2011-03-17T05:23Z,"@killakill
that's the worst advice I ever heard. You dont need to download the now defunct k-lite codec pack ever since VLC became popular.. about.. ohh.. 6 years ago.
Any k-lite pack you download today is going to be full of bugs.
Also, it's 'Codecs' not as you put 'codex'
& also its complete , not 'compleat'
Fukkin dumb ass."

You had the opportunity to offer intelligent comment but you chose to hit bottom a keep digging.  Killakilla was attempting to offer useful information based on his/her experience, albeit out of date.  YOU, on the other hand think you knew better but selfishly choose to say nothing helpful just criticise.  Why don't you show your mummy what you wrote?  No matter where I go, I find a moron like you desperately wanting to prove that they are the biggest slag in the whole world.  You have failed at that too."

Who gives a fuck you idiot, and to me the quickest and most effiecent way to setup a new pc to watch ANY movie you download is to install Klite codec pack with Media PLayer classic, it shits all over VLC. This is a fact if you think otherwise its becasue you are stupid!"
,peu123,2011-03-26T02:10Z,You might want to give MPC-HC Version a try and remove all external codecs or just keep the ones you think work better (ie:CoreAVC)
