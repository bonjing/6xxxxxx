I am very grateful!
Thanks a million!"
,Flopis,2011-02-26T15:55Z,"I don't want to appear greedy, although I am, but I hope you can get the rest of his books :)"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-02-26T16:47Z,"Sorry, man.  That's all there was.  I grabbed em' off of usenet."
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-02-26T17:00Z,"But looking back on all these posts if I had it to do over again I wouldn't have numbered the series.  That took some time and I think I've got the orders on some of them wrong because different sites say different things.  People would probably be better off to relabel the numbers to whatever they think is right.

But I feel your pain.  I've been looking like mad for stuff by Joe Lansdale, especially his Drive-In series, and can't find squat, not even in newsgroups. :("
