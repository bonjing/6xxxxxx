,TheAngrySpanker,2011-06-27T17:25Z,"I downloaded it followed the instructions, installed Windows 7 and did all the things it said and I was able to launch it and it runs Windows 7 very good.

But I have a problem with it. The ""DVD Drive (D:)"" that Windows uses doesn't seem to exist on a Mac. So therefore, when I put a CD/DVD into the Mac it will not show up as a CD/DVD in Windows, and will instead show up as a disk file under the ""Network Location"" category.

This is very annoying for me as I am trying to install the game Halo: CE on my Mac in Windows through Parallels Desktop 6.

Does anyone know if this is fixable, and if so, how?"

,mattymo,2011-07-04T10:23Z,"Some advice for those having trouble

1) When you run the installer, and it asks you if you want to get an update before installing, say NO.  The updated version has blacklisted this serial and it won't work.  Just proceed with ""Install Current"".

2) If you are having trouble running either of the scripts included (like I did), try this: right click on the script, and select ""Show Package Contents"".  Then go to Contents -> Resources -> Scripts.  Double-click to open main.scpt.  It will open in AppleScript Script Editor.  Click ""Run"" at the top.  Enter admin password and you are good to proceed."

,Quailman5,2011-07-11T02:05Z,"As was mentioned on the previous page, if you download these tools: http://appd.in/parallels-desktop-6-key/ and run them it will work. There's a text file with the tools explaining what to do.

Don't update the install program when it prompts you and the given serial number will still work. The application blocker does just that - it blocks the parallels installer from checking if the number is valid. They can disable all the numbers they want and it won't make a difference.

Happy pirating!"
