,tugavoa,2011-03-30T23:18Z,to TreskTheKing. Does your device have a slot for memory card?
,tugavoa,2011-04-02T03:39Z,Some parts are missing from map. Would you be able to sort that out? The torrent is just fine with the activators and instructions and all but the map is crippled.

,psychedelicken,2011-04-19T14:04Z,"Will this work on a one XL unit?

I'm having problems installing...Probably me, running around like a headless chicken atm.

I formatted the SD card, copies the Navcore contents to the card, and that works fine.

Copied the map folder accross and the Tomtom doesn't see it. What am I doing wrong?

I can install maps to my phone version of tomtom navigator, but trying to do this for a mate. Thanks"

copy navcore to sd is fine
after that copy tom tom map to sd

after that you need to activate the map with the included activator "
