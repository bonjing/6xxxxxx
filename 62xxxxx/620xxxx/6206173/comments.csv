,demon080291,2011-03-02T05:32Z,"great upload! thanks a lot :) I have a problem with VLC player: the subtitle doesn't work well with the player. It just flashes on and off in .1 second. How do I fix that? I also try to use the external subtitle, but the VLC player stops playing when I turn the sub. on :("
,pbsource9,2011-03-03T23:47Z,"GREAT STUFF HD-R-US!! THANK YOU
ONE QUESTION:
HOW DO I GET TO RUN SUBTITLES (THEY SHOULD BE HARDCODED)? MY BLUERAY PLAYER JUST CANNOT UPLOAD .SRT:( 

I CANNOT GET THEM RUNNING AT ALL (OK ON GOM, BUT WOULD LIKE TO WATCH ON TV BY PLAYING ON A REGULAR LG BLUERAY).
ANY ADIVICES?"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-03-04T01:42Z,"ste7e205 - Added to the request list, and you're always welcome.

demon080291 - VLC Media Player can be temperamental when it comes to sub's. They work for some, and not others. Each to their own of course, but KMPlayer is a much less resource hungry and easier choice, especially for sub's. You just play the movie, right click the screen, and left click Load Subtitle. Browse to where the .srt format subtitle is on your computer, and you're done.

pbsource9 - the .srt subtitles that are included with the download are only for external use. The same PGS subtitles are formatted to the file structure of the disc image, so it shouldn't be any different from playing any other blu-ray or DVD disc on a standalone, AVCHD compatible, blu-ray player."
,demon080291,2011-03-04T06:13Z,"Thanks to your advice, I can see sub's now on KMPlayer. However, the movie is sluggish on KMPlayer. I've got the latest version of its and the latest K-Lite Codec Pack. The movie is smooth on VLC player - but no subtitle :(. Do you know where I can get the codec so the KMPlayer can play your movie smoothly?
1 more thing: Could I request ""2012"" and ""The King's Speech"" (in advance)? Thank you very much for your dedication to this community! "

,ShinraArmy,2011-04-16T23:05Z,"Dear HD-R-US

First of all, thank you very much for your continuous support to TPB's library of HD moves with chapter and subtitle support. It's been of great help to me and I make sure to upload at least as much as I download, I'm seeind Back to the Future II right now.

Second, I have a favor to ask, could you please upload Sherlock Holmes? (Guy Ritchie's version starring Robert Downey Jr.)
I should like to be able to watch it with subtitles, since I have trouble understanding what they say at times.

Always thankful
-Shinra"
,enzy,2011-04-26T20:25Z,hey.... thanks!!!!
,cooltints2010,2011-05-03T04:12Z,"@HD-R-US: Hey i have one doubt.
All ur releases are in iso format means its a single disc write mode.
i have a blu ray player to read the hd format. but since u provide subs seperately hw can i write it to disc to be read by the player?"
,pathless,2011-06-06T09:40Z,"what happened to HD-R-US? three months since an upload, I'm worried."
,DLkiller,2011-06-08T16:07Z,"Hey I have two questions for u, b4 I start uploading. First I'd like to know how u get the BR/avc in a 4.35g iso.  I have a few BR movies I would like to back up. And second is would u be able to do any BR/avc adult uploads. I kno a few dirty people lol"
,DJMpyrat,2011-06-17T15:31Z,"Miss you, You had the best HD's, best Bluray dl ,quality work,,Thanks for all your work"
,PryingOpenMy3rdEye,2011-07-09T01:51Z,"HD-R-US I just want to say I can't thank you enough for the work you do. I literally signed up for TPB to extend my gratitude your way. I've downloaded almost all of your HD movies so far and seeded for as long as I could.

I honestly can't understand why more people don't rip and encode movies in the format you do. As you have stated its the best all around format, and I wouldn't ask for it any other way.

I hope to see some more uploads from you soon as I see a gap in uploads, I hope all is well with you (or your team). 

One other thing....I have a question for you regarding this format if you could please E-mail me at: PryingOpenMy3rdEye@live.com

Thanks so much. You are irreplaceable. "
[T],HD-R-US,2011-07-11T17:11Z,"@cooltints2010 - As stated in the info' above: PGS subtitles are included with the movie's file structure. The .srt subtitles that are also included are only for external use.

@pathless - Just travelling, and little time for this stuff. :o)

@DJMpyrat - You're always welcome, and thank you.

@PryingOpenMy3rdEye - Cheers for your words. Please direct your question to our inbox on Suprbay, and we'll do our best to help.
