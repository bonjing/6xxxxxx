We have a ""Wish list"" in our forum, where members also search and find movies for other members - could be very helpful for you if you posted a request there.

,Golp,2011-03-21T17:33Z,"Hm. Trenger litt hjelp. Etter rundt 15 min inn i filen fÃ¥r jeg opp: Audio output har blitt midlertidig dempet... StÃ¸tter ikke systemet  osv..""
Er noe med en kontrakt fra en firma med navnet Cin eller noe sÃ¥nt, derfor det er blitt dempet. Og slik er det resten av filmen, det er ingen lyd og meldingen dekker Ã¸verste del av underteksten.

Spiller da filmen pÃ¥ PS3.


English version:
After about 10 to 20 minutes in the movie, I get this ""Audio output has been temporarily muted ... Does support the system etc.. ""
It's about a contract from a company named Cin or something like that, that's why it has been muted. And it stay this in the rest of the movie, there's no sound and the message covers the upper part of the subtitles.

Hva er galt / what's wrong?"
