,valicon,2011-02-28T04:06Z,TwisTtheTwiTch I was attempting to open the files of on the torrent to find that they were password protected so If you could post the passwords I would appreciate it.  
,tig1988,2011-02-28T04:34Z,Valicon what do you mean? All of the files open and work fine. It appears you just can’t open the ones that are signed by the author so his name can’t be removed. What exactly is happening? How doesn’t it open? What are you trying to do them?
,valicon,2011-02-28T15:46Z,"I double click on the file and abode player pops up saying this document is password protected please enter the document open password, and all in trying to do is open them I'm not trying to modify them or anything."
,programman94,2011-03-01T21:16Z,"@valicon, maybe you need a new version of adobe reader? i'll try to open the files with version 10, and see if it worked."
,programman94,2011-03-01T21:21Z,"i just checked, and the files are working with adobe reader 10. if you still have a problem, try to redownload the torrent."
,valicon,2011-03-03T15:19Z,Yeah it works now thanks.
,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2011-03-06T19:26Z,"I am glad to hear everything is working properly. I hope you all enjoy the books. ^^ Please seeed, comment + and enjoy.

,ewwwitshieu,2011-03-28T08:12Z,"So the first three books are secured, and the last one is too, so it has a password...
I can click on the file and I can read it,
but I need to put this on my Kindle, and to read the books, I need the password.
So may I have the password, or at least tell me a way to fix it?"
,TheSupaDusty,2011-03-30T03:08Z,"book 7 is encrypted! there's a password. when you download it to your computer, it should open up fine on adobe reader 10. but, when you transfer it to a reader or smartphone, you cannot open the file without the password because of the security >:|"
,auntkrazi,2011-04-01T22:23Z,hey TtT i am also unable to open any of the books without a password and i have adobe 10. i have redownloaded the torrent and am asking that you post the password. Please!!!!!

,osricnocturnem,2011-05-10T05:50Z,"Seriously, I have Adobe Acrobat Pro X, it works fine on there, but as soon as it is put on my Nook, password protected. So, please post the password you protect your files with on Adobe. "
,eks1910,2011-06-18T05:03Z,What is the password? Trying to open with Stanza eBook Reader and it is asking for  PW
,NinJay420,2011-09-24T06:43Z,please post the password!
,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2011-12-06T04:07Z,"Very rarely does anyone leave a comment for my uploads, so very rarely do I check. I am sorry for the delay. The password I secured these particular ebooks with is ""b435364ae7"" without quotes. If anybody re-uploads these anywhere else, please remember to give credit where it's due.
