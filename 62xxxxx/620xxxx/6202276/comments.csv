,y3n007,2011-02-27T08:54Z,"Is this movie any good, I checked the imdb and it does not look that good......"
,hauntnut,2011-02-27T23:06Z,"Hey, y3n007, why not get it and check it out for yourself? Stop relying on what others say about a movie, and give it a chance yourself. You never know what you might end up liking. 

Anyhow, thanks for this, TvTeam! Good quality!"

,golfer2,2011-02-28T19:21Z,"hey the fuckin person is asking a legitimate fucking question, if you know the answer then answer it if not shut the fuck up. Do you know how many fucking times I have looked for comments before deciding on whether or not I would download something, share the fucking info good or bad"
,gaaraisgod,2011-03-08T14:34Z,"No really, there are plenty of better sources for reviews about the content of a movie than TPB. (6.5/10 on IMDb, 57% Tomatometer)

Plus, it's not like he was bashing him. It's just a good suggestion. Form your own opinion.

Thanks for the movie TvTeam :)"
