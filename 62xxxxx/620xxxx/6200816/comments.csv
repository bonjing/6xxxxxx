,EvIlHaVoc,2011-02-26T19:30Z,"tell u what douche...i converted it to 320...what else can i say ...other than go fuck yourself....at least im uploading shit and not complaining fo something i get for free,,,,so fuck off!!!!!"
,EvIlHaVoc,2011-02-26T19:33Z,"hey kerryfairy....try sharing shit before u judge my torrents......at least i try to give a little back for what i take
GOOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
[T],PeteSapai,2011-02-27T00:00Z,"1. Why the hell would you re-encode shit to 320kbps? It still sounds like shit and only takes up more space. And most important: it still sounds like shit!
2. The ""you can't complain about something that's free"" argument is as old as it is invalid. (Besides, kerry's comment is free, and you complain about that too, ever thought about that?) Especially if the uploader knows it's re-encoded crap and doesn't tell. kerry wasn't even complaining, he was commenting using the *comment* field, that's what it's there for.
Anyway, good to see you share a lot, but if you don't want negative comments, don't share this low quality *re-encoded* stuff."
