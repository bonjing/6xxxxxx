,daba_1,2011-02-28T04:26Z,Your green skull is much deserved. A lot of different and hard to get music. Keep up the good work. Someone else just lost my respect.

Green skull singular...ergo is much pathetic.

I searched for this on TPB before I uploaded this...and your upload of this did not show up.


So you managed to get hold of a copy of this before the warez sites put a block on it for a whole bunch of complaints re copyright infringement.


I should point out that I did not simply take your upload of this and up it in an attempt to make myself even more vainglorious than I already am.


Because of the copyright infringement violations I had to download this from four different sites...and then had to piece it together.   Which was not easy...because some twat had passworded one of the RAR folders.


And there is no reason why you and I should make enemies of each other...we are here for a common cause: to share...and not steal each other's thunder...


...so get over it...
