Storyline: Kate (Hayden Panettiere) and Humphrey (Justin Long) are two wolves from the same pack in Canadaâ€™s Jasper National Park but on opposite ends of the social order. Kate, daughter of the main Alpha male Winston (Danny Glover) and his mate Eve (Vicki Lewis), is herself an Alpha and takes her duty to the pack seriously. Humphrey, on the other hand, is an Omega wolf, the lowest of the pack, and spends his days making jokes and playing about with his other Omega friends Shakey (Kevin Sussman), Salty (Brian Donovan), and Mooch (Eric Price). Despite his low rank in the pack, Humphrey has a crush on Kate and is valued in the pack as a peacemaker by virtue of his affable nature.
