They told me to try again tomorrow after tonights maintenance. I will do that. Thanks for all that is supporting this OS torrent!!"

,Bobance,2011-03-01T23:31Z,this is activate or not?
,Animal98,2011-03-02T17:37Z,"No, this is not activated. There is nothing added to these windows installs. You will need to use Daz's loader or KMS Activator...."
,gfx190,2011-03-03T08:29Z,thnkx i try it
,cokes79,2011-03-03T15:27Z,"@Animal98:  Would you mind sharing how you were able to add the extra boot option for 64-bit repair?  None of the AIO tutorials out there address the need to do this, or how to.  TIA!"
,Milloflex,2011-03-05T09:56Z,why not include the activator into this? it would be the perfect torrent
,Animal98,2011-03-05T18:10Z,"@cokes79

The reason is so if a computer that is running 64 bit version of OS can not be booted, or needs to go to an older restore point, then this will function for it. The tutorial was given by DKane on mydigitallife forums.

@Milloflex

While I agree with you, I didn't want people stating that I'm giving a virus (because loaders are detected as virii) in my torrent...That is the whole reason. This is an UNTOUCHED nothing added to any of the .wim files, etc. .iso from MSDN. All original. This way, everyone knows that there is no backdoor, or any virus in here.

Thanks"

No, this ins't embedded with anything...it doesn't even have an activator folder..this was created with the original ISO's from above using WAIK."
