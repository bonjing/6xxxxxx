Thanks for the upload as always!"

,VikingKing001,2011-03-27T20:35Z,"10 out 10 for picture and sound quality. Although effects were good, story line to this film is rubbish.
Have to say enjoyed it...."
,minus_zero,2011-03-28T05:24Z,"A/10
V/7
M/ -3 minus fuckin 3!!!! it sucked bigfoot's smelly cock, so go ahead and DL you'll never get that 1.5 hours back in your life!

P.s. I not one to usually comment other then A/V/M but this movie most be stopped.. think about it, some guy sitt'in at home on a sunday night all depressed and says to him self ""hummm, this trailer looks kinda cool, I think I'll give it a look see and take my mind off my shity life for a while"". Then when the movie ends his life just sucks that much more, and BAM!!!! he blows his fuck'in head off!!! Is that what you want to see happen???? Didn't think so.. So do everbody a huge fav and stop seeding this nugget of golden shit...
thanx byebye! "
,crossfire6,2011-04-05T03:19Z,"Many thanks for the up, extremezone.  Appreciate your work as always.
It would be nice if comments were restricted to A/V, that's what we really care about.  Movie we can judge for ourselves.  One person's rubbish is a great flick to another.  Just shut the fuck up, okay?"
,Drake9669,2011-04-08T00:00Z,"@crossfire6:  Actually, I appreciate not just A/V reviews but opinions on the movie(s), as well. That let me know it is probably not my cup of tea, since in addition to his scathing review, I never once saw a trailer for it, or heard anyone talk about it, or caught a review of it in a magazine or my local paper.

True, he was over-the-top with his review, but maybe it really is that bad of a film. After all, he felt compelled to put down on /paper/ what he thought to try and discourage us from seeing it, too, and by his own admission, he never commented before other than A/V quality.

Food for thought, anyway. Cheers."

,JackAssin,2011-06-25T22:29Z,"I'll be back and say how I liked it.

I bet it's a case of the right stinking Jew scums not getting behind this movie.
I only just found out about this by scrolling way back in the movie reviews at AOL.

Nice flicks sometimes get lost in the fray because of whores like Jennifer Anniston and Cameron Diaz being promised screen space for their bullshit films that they sucked Jew cock to get made."
