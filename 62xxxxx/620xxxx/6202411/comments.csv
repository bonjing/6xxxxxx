,puppyup,2011-02-26T05:22Z,"Just saw it. Picture quality is very good. Sound is not great, but ok for watching. The movie itself is not bad, but ruined by Seth Rogen. This guy just can't act.

plz do copy the url links and paste them to ur browser instead	"
,scottsasse,2011-03-02T02:08Z,"THANKS SaM and THANKS to all you seeders out there!! This website is full of a bunch of bitchy bitches! People when rating a movies quality DO take into consideration the size of the file. If you want a 1:1 copy then download the 4.5GB size file or better yet go buy it. As far as I'm concerned the picture and sound are GREAT for a 700MB size download that I didn't have to go out & buy:):) BRAVO SaM & THANKS for sharing!!                V=10, A=9, M=7"

The reason you can't watch imageshack pictures is because your probably using a browser such as Google Chrome... Try using IE (internet explorer) and it will work!: ) 

Great UL"

,snowbirds,2011-03-31T07:11Z,"First of all, thanks to the uploader for providing this copy to the public, free of charge.  You're efforts are appreciated! :)

@ vincevega3, thanks for giving your feedback!  After reading your comment I decided to DL the sample first, and I'm glad I did, because I found the audio to be so fuzzy that the dialogue was hard to understand.  I'm going to wait for a better copy.  That's just me.  No insult to the uploader of course!

@ scottsasse and pzychoe, please shut the hell up and stop trolling people who leave honest feedback about uploads.  Critical feedback is USEFUL, you tools.  It's not a personal attack on the uploader.  Jeez, go back to the Land of Niceness where you came from, where you let donkeys fuck you up the butt without complaining about it, because it's free, and you're all too fucking NICE to complain about it...  I'm so sick of you people!"
,snowbirds,2011-03-31T07:19Z,"Oh, and one more thing!

@ pzychoe, yes, we all see that the label says ""R5 Line"".  Guess what you barrel full of numbnuts, not all R5's are the same.  This one has an normal video quality for an R5, but the sound is below average for an R5.  This is why comments about quality are useful.  Now go read the Hallmark greeting cards you saved from your last birthday party, so you don't start crying."
,pzychoe,2011-04-03T12:13Z,"@snowbirds
   1st of all, i know that not all R5s are the same but I can't call what vincevega3 said a feedback. Why..? Because what u mentioned is the feedback, telling everyone that the video is r5 quality but the audio is below r5 quality.

   2nd... Why don't I complain? Because i didn't download this torrent. So basically, I have nothing to complain about.

   And lastly, I'd rather go to the land of niceness than come with u in the land of assholes who knows nothing but to curse all day and mock people around. "
