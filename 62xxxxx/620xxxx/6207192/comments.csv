,corruptedSoul,2011-05-03T11:36Z,"You can download the 32bit trial version from Paragon website, then use the registration info from this torrent, it will work."
,btckfc,2011-05-06T13:15Z,"v8 is not compatible with Windows 7 SP1 (I blame Micro$oft). Paragon has release v9, but the v8 serial doesn't work for v9.
Any chance of an updated release? Thanks"
,joecargo90,2011-05-08T12:40Z,"Much better than macdrive. However, it shows the hidden files on HFS partitions. Also, version 9 has been released which addresses this issue. Anyone got a serial?"
