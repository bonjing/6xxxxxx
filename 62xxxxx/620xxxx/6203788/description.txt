Charley, an artist, recently had a big exhibition of her work at the gallery that Richie owns with his wife. Dropping in unexpectedly on a day theyâ€™re closed, and Richie is by himself, Charley immediately notices that her work isnâ€™t on display. He explains that her show is over, and in fact, she was supposed to pick up her pieces so that he can make room for another artists exhibition. She doesnâ€™t like the idea that her work isnâ€™t hanging anymore, and implores him to permanently display some of her work. Explaining that, because the gallery is so small, that would be impossible, Charley is unrelenting, and decides the best way to convince him is to do a little personal exhibiting or her own. From now on when Richieâ€™s in the gallery, heâ€™ll remember Charley fucking him, and with that heâ€™s sure to keep some of her work up to remember the best private exhibition heâ€™s ever had.
