,ciscobox,2011-08-31T10:17Z,"hello,
i know its irrelevant question, but i just wanna ask if its possible to ""emulate"" or run a sparc OS on intel or linux platform? i have a sparc executable image, that i really need to run and test under intel/linux. google says it might possible under qemu, but i want to know your opinion about this, with all your torrent, it seems like you're knowledgable on solaris plaform. thanks in advanced mate!"

Yes, it's some kind of possible.
1) QEMU can emulate 32- and 64-bit systems, SPARC support isn't perfect, but sometimes it works;
2) TME (The Machine Emulator) is an emulator of very old Sun computerts;
3) Simics can emulate complete systems, but it's very slow;
4) QuickTransit was a binary translator for Linux and Solaris, but Transitive Corp. was acquired by IBM and this program is no longer available.

By the way, don't repost the same comment many times, it can look like a spam, so you can get a ban :)"
