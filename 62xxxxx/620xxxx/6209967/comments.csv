,BBJ2550,2011-03-05T10:56Z,"Going back to HB's 3.2.3.11796 torrent installer worked.

Not sure what to think, might just be a bad batch."

,DoomTra1n,2011-03-16T06:46Z,"Hi hellboy, you're upload doesn't seem to work. I've tried various compatibility modes, tried straight from the .exe file. Maybe it's been blacklisted? I have no idea how fraps works with it's anti piracy stuff. 

I use Xfire to record video, it's free and don't let the haters get to you they probably haven't used it in the last 3-4 years, Xfire works VERY good , much improved over the last few  years. Xfire now uses less CPU / GPU resources w/ minimal hardware lagg. I just can't get Xfire to record older games like Max Payne, Quake II etc. which is what I'm tryna do right now. 

I just thought I'd try FRAPS out, but I guess I'll have to check an older or newer version of FRAPS instead. Thanks for the effort though homey. I see yo have a green skull, I hope to see a new torrent for FRAPS out soon ;)"
,ineedhalp,2011-03-17T13:00Z,"hellboy, do you think you can crack/edit this recording program called ""Dxtory""?
It seems like there are simply license files to keep validation in check, and I hear one key can be used on basically unlimited computers.
Or you could just bypass the registration check =)

hellboy, you are my only hope!"
,Andster,2011-03-20T16:18Z,"You are a fucking boss, bro~"
,Tiong326,2011-03-26T08:38Z,The problem is not at trial version.
,Itbankrock,2011-03-31T13:44Z,"Fraps 3.4.0 - 29th Mar 2011
- Added configurable buffer size for loop recording mode
- Increased video capture performance at high resolutions
- Fixed slow recording of Minecraft at default window size
- Fixed benchmark crashing when configured to stop automatically after 1 second"
,cvb941,2011-03-31T22:48Z,Finally there is configurable buffer size.. Please make torrent for 3.4.0
,battleangel,2011-04-08T08:21Z,Please look into cracking PlayClaw (http://www.playclaw.com/). Would be nice to have an alternative to Fraps.
,Gashimahiron,2011-04-08T18:04Z,"Hey that's just what i've been waiting for, thx dude you're the best(well...)
ok really, you're not the best, but you helped me a lot because all the other versions didn't work on that goddamned win7, now i can record EPIC things that happen with my pc and my games, and not limited to 30 secs
btw if you upload an update i'll be happy too, as will many people around here

PS:there is an alternative for an alternative here, i found a program called games video recorder(WOW best non-obvious title ever) that records games only, and is an alternative for playclaw, so if any of you are up to it, upload, i wanna test the latest non-trial version of that crap and see if it's worth it!
let's hope it's game focused(doesn't lag the game to death)"
