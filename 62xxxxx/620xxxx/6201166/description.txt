Notes: 

ELEKTRI4KA's video i gave a colour/brightnes/contrast adjustment and a cleanup/sharpen. Its actualy a good ts. It does however have portugese subs that were part of the source.

IMAGiNES TS of this had missing segments of video and audio so i had to put alot into fixing and syncing it to the video source i used. The IMAGiNE guys had used duplicate audio to fill some gaps around these areas. I removed most of this and filled all the gaps with areas of silence or almost silence copied from elseware in the movie. This left 3 gaps in the movie that were completely filled with near silence. The whole audio track needed a big fps adjustment as well. All sorted. Synced very tight all the way, wich wasnt easy. The audio was filtered and rebalenced as well.
Fyi the gaps are at the 42 mn mark for just under a min, the other 2 are after the 1 hour 20 odd mark. The longest lasting just over 1 min.
