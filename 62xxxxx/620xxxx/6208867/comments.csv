,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-01T01:27Z,"Thanks once again for QofS episodes (would you happen to have 5 or 11?)  Also thanks for the Oscars--'twas worth watching for this quote alone (from Inside Job Director Charles Ferguson, at the beginning of his acceptance speech):  “Forgive me, I must start by pointing out that three years after a horrific financial crisis caused by fraud, not a single financial executive has gone to jail — and that’s wrong,”"
