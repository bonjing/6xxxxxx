Click the box next to the title ""Launcher Name:"" and type update1 and then click create
Click ""Done""
Click ""Quit""
Now navigate back to your opened package contents of the Black Ops.app, you'll notice a new app called update 1.
Double click the update1.app and allow for the installer to initiate the update. Follow the installer windows as directed. When the game is installed place the cracked content in the Black ops folder and double click the app to play!


Also included is the Zombie mode enabler cracked EXE

Both are confirmed to work."
