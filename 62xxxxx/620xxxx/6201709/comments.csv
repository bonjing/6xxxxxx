,PBPrivateerFU,2011-02-25T17:12Z,"Ya know, it seems more people would say thanks to 20/40 - I guess they just don't understand how much time it takes to convert these shows to H264 mp4 format... especially when you do a double pass to assure top quality... come on folks - give it up for the man and his efforts! You folks that do the ""hit & run"" thing really suck! Seeeeeed for the guy man...."
