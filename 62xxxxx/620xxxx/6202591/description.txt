     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Three months after opening Britain's most innovative
      supermarket Arthur Potts Dawson is struggling to keep The
      People's Supermarket open. It's hardly proving to be the utopian
      dream he had hoped for. Arthur turns personal shopper to show
      die-hard Sainsbury's families that his style of shopping and
      cooking is better. And determined to challenge the conventional
      model where overstocked shelves can lead to waste, Arthur goes
      back to his roots as a chef and opens The People's Kitchen in
      the supermarket. But will people be happy to eat food previously
      destined for the bin?
