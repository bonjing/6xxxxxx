Don't waste your money buying one of those "10,000" or "100,000" or even "A million" drivers DVDs on Ebay. No matter how cheap you cannot get that many drivers onto a 4GB DVD ROM

This is one of those DVDs on EBay and I'm sharing with you all

The DVD is 1.4GB ISO, simply d/l and mount/burn

I'd post a list but whoever compiled this DVD did a hopeless job of separating the drivers out into anything meaningful, just big directories of .inf and .sys files but no other segmentation.

Give it a go. You never know there might be buried treasure here.
At least you didn't pay $4-6 on Ebay for it!
