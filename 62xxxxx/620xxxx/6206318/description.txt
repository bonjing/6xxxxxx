           Two in the Wave is the story of a friendship. Jean-Luc         
           Godard was born in 1930; Francois Truffaut two years           
           later. Love of movies brings them together. They write in      
           the same magazines, Cahiers du Cinema and Arts. When the       
           younger of the two becomes a filmmaker with "The 400           
           Blows", which triumphs in Cannes in 1959, he helps his         
           older friend shift to directing, offering him a                
           screenplay which already has a title, A bout de souffle,       
           or Breathless. Through the 1960s the two loyally support       
           each other. History and politics separate them in 1968,        
           when Godard plunges into radical politics but Truffaut         
           continues his career as before. Between the two of them,       
           the actor Jean-Pierre Leaud is torn like a child caught        
           between two separated and warring parents. Their               
           friendship and their break-up embody the story of French       
           cinema.
