,christo7,2011-09-30T22:33Z,"There's an issue with the order of the episodes. I had already seen the first 6 episodes, so I only downloaded 7-13 from this torrent, but the one named 1x07 is definitely 1x04."
,christo7,2011-10-01T03:42Z,"Okay, watch the episodes in this torrent in this order: 1,2,3,7,4,5,6,8,9,10,etc.

1x07 is really episode 4.
1x04 is really 5, and so on.
That's only assuming 8-13 are labeled right."
