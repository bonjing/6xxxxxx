Justice isn't blind - it's just a little short sighted and weak around the knees...A Rumpole novel which takes on New Labour and the Timson family, and includes extracts from the memoirs of Hilda Rumpole, aka "She Who Must Be Obeyed"...Tiffany Timson's new husband Mahmoud Khan, is arrested on suspicion of terrorism. Rumpole is frustrated in his defence campaign by New Labour laws that render the British legal system a farce - defending a suspected terrorist proves a tricky task even for the great defender...He insists upon a fair trial, and his fight for justice brings him into confrontation not only with Hilda, but also with the leaders of New Labour.
