* Tested with Dungeons-FLT Version

* Savegames will become unusable so you have to restart the mission

* Block Dungeons from accessing the internet

* Make backups of the files before patching

* You can also find these files on rlslog in the comments of Dungeons-FLT as a direct download link... thats from where I got it from.

-----------------------------------------------------

After successfully installed Dungeons-FLT which is 1.0.0.1:

1. Install dungeons_deen_1.0.0.1_1.2.0.0.exe (the patch)

2. Backup files before cracking

3. Copy Content of "CRACK" into you games folder, 
something like:
C:\Documents and Settings\"User"\Local Settings\Application Data\Apps\Kalypso Media\Dungeons

4. Play via Dungeons.exe (and not DungeonsStarter.exe)

* I've included a Win7 SP1 Crack Fix that I have not tested as I'm using XP ;p So dont know about its fixing capabilities.

* Thx to Chris32 for the Crack's for Patch 1.2 and Win7SP1 Fix
