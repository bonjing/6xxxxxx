Pop and country have become increasingly interchangeable in the 21st century, and few artists have benefited more than Keith Urban. On paper, heâ€™s a wealth of contradictions â€” a country boy with an exotic accent, a balladeer with rock & roll chops, a stubbled face framed by flat-ironed hair. On his albums, though, Urban molds those would-be incompatibilities into some of the slickest country songs this side of Taylor Swift, appealing to his longtime Nashville supporters while still targeting fans who wouldnâ€™t be caught dead inside a honky tonk. Released one year after 2009â€™s Defying Gravity, Get Closer is another country-pop hybrid, executed with swagger and professionalism by the man who helped bring drum machines to Music City.

Get Closer is the seventh studio album by Australian country music artist Keith Urban. It was released November 16, 2010 on Capitol Records.The lead-off single, "Put You in a Song," was released September 13, 2010, and debuted on Billboard Hot Country Songs charts at #29 for the week of October 2, 2010.
