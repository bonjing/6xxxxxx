,heartland-fan,2011-03-06T04:53Z,"I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you once again for faithfully uploading the final episodes of Season 4.

I'm surprised that more people did not take time to offer their gratitude.

In any event, it was a fantastic episode and I am looking forward to the 2 programs that lead up to the season finale at the end of March.

Thank you!!!!"
