Just an FYI:
When I sorted ""Desending Seeders"" your torrent disappeared from the list. Also try viewing ""Single/Double"" acts quirky too !!

Keep up the GREAT work !!"
,darkpoet1978,2011-04-27T21:14Z,My only complaint is that you zipped the serial file... and that was all I needed.  I had already downloaded AlZip...  WARNING that some ZIP files made with AlZip don't properly extract with WinRAR... which is exactly why I need this program.  Korean Software = Dumb.

...you're welcome!"
,darkpoet1978,2012-03-29T08:03Z,"It's a twisted world for tech here in Korea.  Alzip is stupid and the ZIP files produced aren't 100% compatible with standard ZIP files.  A file made by Hangul 2007 can't be opened by Hangul 2004 - ironic considering both were made for Win XP and XP still dominates Korean offices.

On the other hand, everyone has broadband (I pay $40/month for fibre-optic) .  3/4 Koreans have a 3G or better smartphone and all 3 major carriers are set to blanket 90% of Korea with 4G/LTE before 2013 even begins."
