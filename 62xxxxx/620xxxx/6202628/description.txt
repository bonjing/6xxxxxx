Rockstar is unlike any other game on the PC. Your goal is, strangely enough, to become a Rockstar. Through the course of your game you will have to produce singles and records, balance a hectic recording schedule with your drug intake while touring Europe and the rest of the World. Success does not come easy. An uneasy market, balanced with your own health problems leads to a very involving game.

As your success rises, so does the demand for concerts and public performances. You a forced to decide when its time for a break and when its time to go out and make some cash.

The game has a text interface, and thats all it really needs, as graphics would just complicate the issue. If you are after a graphics version, you may wish to check out Rockstar Ate My Hamster on the Amiga.
