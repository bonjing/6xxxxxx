,Ghost9422,2011-02-25T11:03Z,Did my comment just get deleted?  Apologize if this is a double post but watch out - 2 programs (mse and malwarebytes) popped for a trojan on this - ignored it and got BSOD'd multiple times from a newly corrupted iastor.sys file - had to run recovery and bootrec /FIXMBR and/FixBoot before I could get back into Windows...maybe its just my bad luck but I'd recommend running anti-virus and cleaning the file before installing...cheers.
,dballaz,2011-02-25T15:50Z,"I have this problem when I update my New Vegas with any of the updates(1-5) I get a huge mouse cursor lag and I don't even have my v-sync on. I can run the game with the settings set on Ultra with above 60 fps and I use the d3d9.dll thingy for compatibility reasons because I have an ATI 5870 card.

I had barely any performance issues before the updates and if I can't find the problem I'll have to play the game unpatched which kinda sucks so anyone have any suggestions what might be the problem?"

OR possibly you are getting a false positive."
,brianxxx,2011-02-25T18:25Z,"@dballaz 

I personally had more problems with the d3d9.dll file then without it. I actually used the tool by that guy to create my own custom d3d9.dll file and it worked correctly after that.

Have not needed it since the most recent NV and ATI updates though.

Maybe try ditching it now?"

,Protoz,2011-02-26T14:02Z,Update to my previous comment. Its shitty coding by Bethesda that causes crash after knockout gas. After searching the forums many people have this issue some said they fixed it by using a different character which happened to be male. I tried loading a different saved character which just happened to be male and i got pass the part of the knockout gas w.o crashing.

If there's an infection, maybe provide some details? Huh? You can't give any details because there is no infection (goddamn liars). Either that OR your computers have been infected already, and the previous virus just infects new files.


Regardless, Dead Money worked 99% flawlessly, even with the plethora of mods I had installed. 


The quality of the content, however, wasn't great. In fact, I found Dead Money unpleasant. One of the worst DLCs, and I've completed all Fallout 3 DLCs. Was DM boring? Not really. Restricting, distressing and even agonizing, yes (makes me wonder how much blame I should put on the mods I've installed). From the user feedback I've read, DM seems to divide players' opinions - half of people like it, the other half loathes it. At later stages DM has very Bioshock-y atmosphere to it, so whatever you felt towards Bioshock, will probably reflect on your opinion about DM (I never liked Bioshock, go figure).


If you're worried about actual physical loot existing in the end... well, let's just say there is some minor but neat stuff... ;)"

Could it be one of the mods I got?"

Once you start the dlc, you can't go back to the Mojave Wasteland.  A message will pop-up when you try to open the door telling you this, so make a save before you enter just in case you're not ready.    When you're finished this dlc, you get sent back to the villa, then you can choose to leave or search around for more loot.  This dlc is a lot like Operation Anchorage from Fallout 3.  Once you beat it, you can't go back or replay it."

,imazombie,2011-04-22T17:59Z,"PIRATING GAMES IS ILLEGAL, TPB ONLY SUPPORTS THESE UPLOADS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PAID TO OWN THEIR GAME AND FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER THE GAME WILL NOT INSTALL. PLEASE OBSERVE ALL COPY-WRITE LAWS WHEN DOWNLOADING THIS TORRENT

in order to run ANY DLed game or software that comes in ""ISO"" format you need a program called ""daemon tools"" (daemon tools lite is free and gets the job done)

an ""ISO"" file is an exact copy of a disk

Daemon tools lite allows you to ""mount"" ISO files into a virtual drive...

now you ask... ""what?""

basically that means you can use daemon tools to replace the use of disks. by mounting the ISO in Daemon tools the computer reads it like it is a disk 

you can access your mounted file under computer just like a normal disk (once mounted ISO files usually auto-run so installation is as easy as mounting the iso and following on screen instructions)

NOTE: this is an expansion of a game so no ""crack"" is needed. when installing the core of a game, you usually need a ""crack"" which allows you to play the game WITHOUT the original disk. Cracks are usually in the form of a replacement application for the game. to install a crack simply find the file where the game is installed and move the cracked application here... it will ask you if you want to replace the existing application... select ""copy and replace""

hopefully everyone can get their games working now. good luck and happy gaming"

I am using a LEGAL version of Fallout: New Vegas, then installed this DLC! All it does is place the .bsa files into your data folder.

I can CONFIRM that it is SAFE to use a legit Fallout New Vegas Version! Fallout DLC's tend to be like mods, where only .bsa/texture/sound files are put into your data folder, then you launch it using the launcher :P

Now you said to try beta 8 and that's when the weird thing happens, it starts to load up like it's going to work, then I get an error message, which reads ""Application load error 6:0000065432""

So i installed it all, copied the skidrow files. I start and select the datafiles deadmoney.esm and falloutnv.esm

I click start and in the first menu i click dlc and click on dead money and nothing happens.

Where did i go wrong?"
