From Wiki:

Paula Julie Abdul (born June 19, 1962)[2] is an American recording artist, dancer, choreographer, actress and television personality.

In the 1980s, Abdul rose from cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers to highly sought-after choreographer at the height of the music video era before scoring a string of pop music-R&B hits in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Her six number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 tie her for fifth among the female solo performers who have reached #1 there.[3] She won a Grammy for "Best Music Video - Short Form" for "Opposites Attract" and twice won the "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography".

After her initial period of success, she suffered a series of setbacks in her professional and personal life, until she found renewed fame and success in the 2000s as a judge on the television series, American Idol, for eight years, before departing from the show. Abdul has since moved on to another television series, CBS's Live to Dance, and she is working on a new album. 







Forever Your Girl 1988


Forever Your Girl is the debut album from singer Paula Abdul. It was released on June 13, 1988 and took 64 weeks from its release to hit number one on the Billboard 200 album sales chart, the longest an album has been on the market before hitting number one.[1] The album was eventually certified seven times Platinum in the US and sold 12 million worldwide.[2] It also included four number one Hot 100 singles - "Straight Up", "Forever Your Girl", "Cold Hearted", and "Opposites Attract." This ties for second most #1 songs from a single album, and is tied for the most number ones in a debut album. "The Way That You Love Me" reached #3 and "Knocked Out" reached #41.

The album also reached #4 on the R&B album chart, while "Straight Up," "Opposites Attract," "Knocked Out," and "(It's Just) The Way That You Love Me" all reached the top 10 of the R&B tracks chart.

After a slow start, the album's third single "Straight Up" helped the album breakout in spring/summer 1989 after its initial summer 1988 release. Forever Your Girl hit number one for the first time on October 7, 1989. After the release of the single "Opposites Attract", it shot to number one spot again on February 3, 1990 and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. At one point, Forever Your Girl reportedly sold 191,000 copies in a single day.[3]

Head Over Heels 1995


Head over Heels is the third studio album (fourth overall) released by American pop singer Paula Abdul on June 13, 1995 under Virgin Records. The album featured the singles "My Love Is For Real", "Crazy Cool" and "Ain't Never Gonna Give You Up".

The album was released after Abdul's four-year hiatus while battling bulimia. The album was hoped to bring Abdul back into the limelight and was considered Abdul's comeback album. However, this would be the last album Abdul would release in her career before she took a second hiatus from music.

"Head over Heels" showcased a new direction and style of music for Abdul, including a more R&B and "sensual" feeling to her songs. First single "My Love Is For Real" was a taster of her new-found sound, however reviews were mixed.

"Head over Heels" received mixed reviews. Many reviewers claimed the album diverted from Abdul's pop music roots, however some reviews said the album was Abdul's most creative and exciting work to date. iTunes review on the album was mixed saying that the "Head over Heels" has songs which "lack strong hooks" yet praised the album for being "more mature and seductive than previous efforts". The review mainly concentrated on the length of the album and how it "spends too much time on lesser songs".

The album didn't do as well as Abdul's previous albums in terms of chart performance and sales. The album was Abdul's weakest selling album to date, only going gold; the album was Abdul's lowest peaking album on the Billboard 200 to date, peaking at #18 and it quickly fell off the charts soon after. The album had managed to sell just under 3 million copies worldwide, her lowest selling studio album (in terms of international sales) in her career. After the relative failure of the album, Abdul left the music scene and ventured into acting.

Three singles were released from the album. The first single,"My Love is For Real" was a moderate hit peaking at #28 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was Abdul's first single to not reach the Top 20 and was considered her last hit in her career. However, the song went to #1 on the U.S. dance charts (her only song to do so). The following single, "Crazy Cool" peaked at #58 and was considered a flop, probably due to bad publicity about the song and its video. The last single from the album "Ain't Never Gonna Give You Up" failed to chart and was considered another flop for her, due to lack of promotion. However, it did peak at #12 on Bubbling Under Hot 100. A fourth single, "If I Were Your Girl" was to be released, but was cancelled after disappointing album sales and the failure of "Ain't Never Gonna Give You Up".
