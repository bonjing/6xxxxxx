Shadow President is a geopolitical simulation computer game released in 1993 for the PC by the now-defunct software company DC True containing elements of cyberpunk and dark science-fiction.

The game put the player in the role of the President of the United States in a situation loosely based on the Cold War and the early 1990s. Using a timeline that starts during the end of the Ethiopia-Somalia war, players can prepare Kuwait to be invaded by Iraq during Operation Desert Shield. Being popular enough to be re-elected is a vital component of the game (re-elections can be disabled, greatly reducing the effect of popularity). Managing the budget of the United States, sending aid to foreign countries, dealing with diplomatic crises, and even fighting wars are a largely unavoidable aspect of the game. The player starts the game with seven advisors, which makes the game a bit less confusing. During every American election year, players are not allowed to access their virtual screen starting at midnight on election night so that a panel of bureaucrats can analyze their progress. If their popularity and efficiency is good enough, the player is authorized to use the terminal for four more years. Not getting re-elected automatically means "game over."

The game has a sequel called CyberJudas which is still available for sale in some places.
