James Herbert is Britain's number one bestselling writer (a position he has held ever since publication of his first novel) and one of the world's top writers of thriller/horror fiction.

He is one of our greatest popular novelists, whose books are sold in thirty-three other languages, including Russian and Chinese. Widely imitated and hugely influential, his nineteen novels have sold more than forty-two million copies worldwide.

With a skillful blend of horror and thriller fiction, he explores the shaded territories of evil, evoking a sense of brooding menace and rising tension. He relentlessly draws the reader through the story's ultimate revelation - one that will stay to chill the mind long after the book has been laid aside. His bestsellers, THE MAGIC COTTAGE, HAUNTED, SEPULCHRE and CREED, have enhanced his reputation as a writer of depth and originality. His novels such as THE FOG, THE DARK and THE SURVIVOR are already hailed as classics of the genre.
