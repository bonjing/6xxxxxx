You can find lots of comic books online mainly on Torrents; itâ€™s actually very hard to find a Torrent with good quality comics,  so I pretty much took my chances with lots of Torrents till I was finally able to complete my collection.

Comics:

1-Asterix

2-The Adventures of Tintin

3-Lucky Luke  â€ French â€œ

3-Rantanplan  â€ French â€œ

4-Iznogoud      â€ French â€œ

5-Jehan Pistolet  â€ French â€œ

6-Oumpah-Pah  â€ French â€œ

7-Luc Junior  â€ French â€œ

8-300

9-The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck


Some French comics are found online in English but unfortunately theyâ€™re incomplete.
