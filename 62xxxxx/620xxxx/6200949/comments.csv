,Lillith69,2011-03-01T08:06Z,"Sorry if I sound noobish, I just don;t wanna get $300 in games non usable anymore."
,MitchJJ_NL,2011-03-19T17:47Z,"Weird thing ....

It works great but when I have the three companions at the fountain and talk to the fountain guy.. it keep saying ''You returned.. Why. Gather the three as ive instructed.''

Ive tried to get all of them in different ways but it doesnt seem to work for me .. I even watched an walktrough and did exactly the same as the video and it just doesnt work for me. It does not give me the new quest :(

Dont know if anyone els is having this problem?"
,MitchJJ_NL,2011-03-19T20:02Z,"Nevermind got it fixed...

You do need Update 4 to get the first quest completed :)"

,xqazwerdx,2011-03-30T05:42Z,I ned help when playing im not getting any xp and i cant search any of the bodies is this what the dlc is supposed to be like if not please help.
,Yakolew,2011-03-31T21:09Z,"@xqazwerdx. 
The ghost peoples needs to be truly dead before you can search them, at least one of there limbs need to be destroyed.

I didn't have any problem with experience. 
Have you installed a lot of mods? They maybe the problem.  "
,xqazwerdx,2011-04-01T04:43Z,Also now when i get the 500 chips colleted it shuts down fallout.

,werebear,2011-06-18T16:29Z,How exactly does one disable VAC then? I didn't realize that was possible.
,Add13,2011-06-20T23:22Z,"@werebear 

You Carnt Disable VAC

But Fallout New Vegas Is Not Vac Enabled So You Dont Have To Worry About A VAC Ban Since Its Not VAC Enabled

Hope That Helped Clear Some Stuff Up

:)"
