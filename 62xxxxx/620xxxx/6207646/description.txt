The Thin Man (1934) B & W

Director: W.S. Van Dyke

The Thin Man is a 1934 American comic detective film starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, a flirtatious married couple who banter wittily as they solve crimes with ease. Nick is a hard drinking retired detective and Nora a wealthy heiress. Their dog, the Wire-Haired Fox Terrier Asta, played by Skippy, was also a popular character.

Completed in 1934 and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the film was directed by W.S. Van Dyke from a script by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich; the screenplay was based on the mystery novel The Thin Man by Dashiell Hammett, supposedly based on his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman. Also appearing in the film were Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Cesar Romero and Porter Hall.

The "Thin Man" of the title was actually not Nick Charles, but the man he was initially hired to find, Clyde Wynant. (Partway through the film, Nick Charles characterizes Wynant as a "thin man with white hair".) However, the "Thin Man" moniker was thought by many viewers to refer to Nick Charles, and after a time, it was used in the titles of the sequels as if it did. Nevertheless, at no time in this or any other "Thin Man" film is Nick Charles called or characterized as a thin man.

In 1997, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry having been deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
