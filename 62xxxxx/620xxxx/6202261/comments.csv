,fuckit105,2011-12-31T00:01Z,"Oh man! I want to swear at you for the rest of my life, I downloaded it but it came with english subs encoded, what means that no matter what I do I'll never be able to get them out of the movie, and this is needed because when I put the portuguese subtitles (I'm brazilian) in the movie it becomes a movie with two subtitles at the same time when played in the Tv or dvd, the exeption is only when seen in the PC.
So PLEASE share movies without any encoded subtitles because then people in any country will be able to download a subtitle and put in the movie in any language, man this would be a favor, but now comes the obligation: if you share a movie let be clear all of its details, you wouldn't like to download a movie with iranian audio just because it wasn't especified in its profile"
