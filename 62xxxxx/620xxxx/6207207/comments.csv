From what I can gather, you are saying it is possible to format your main disk partition (that which Windows is installed on)? Well yes, that is true, and that would be a very bad idea! The program gives you several warnings before you make this stupid mistake, however. Most people have the common sense not to do it."
,yashaka71107,2011-02-28T06:31Z,"this software never give you a warning's about delete all your data and it just format itself without warning, i try this several times and it did the same, don't act like you know chi.t and look at you new uploader in this site and start said chit when you dont even know what the hell are you talking about, suc.ker."
,bbug,2011-03-04T07:11Z,"@yashaka, if it had been that way, this software wouldn't be on the top of most of the partition manager revirews,okY? Check this page: http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/best-free-partition-manager.htm"

There is no installation required, just unzip it. The executable for the program is located in the ""bin"" folder. Just make a shortcut and place the program wherever you desire."
,Zache51,2011-03-27T14:43Z,I figured but I installed the free version instead and overwrote the files to get a shortcut lol. But it worket!
,PIRATE-555,2011-05-09T17:06Z,"*** If you don't know how to use advanced software, do a LOT of reading BEFORE YOU select any potentially destructive option! ***

This package works beautifully, but be advised, it offers MANY powerful options ~ including options that WILL format your hard drive and TOTALLY wipe it of all data!

If you are foolish enough to wipe your drive with options YOU SELECT;  DON'T shoot the messenger (who was kind enough to provide the package here) because of your stupidity.

,hollame12,2011-05-25T20:08Z,The software can't see my hard drive. I followed the shortcut as directed. Pls does anyone have a solution to this?

I have the same! All options are grayed out for me!

I can only exit the program, set a pass and reload system info. When I reload HDD info it gives me nothing! It doesnt recognize anything!

sys specs:
I have a 120GB SDD with 2 partys. (Windows 7 Ultimate and Ubuntu 11.04)

and I have 2 1TB HDDs in RAID0

Can anyone help me?"
