EASEUS Partition Master v7.0.1 x64 Professional Edition


As a Partition Magic alternative, EASEUS Partition Master Professional Edition is an ALL-IN-ONE partition solution and disk management utility. It allows you to extend partitions and even change partition types without removing the data! The most powerful hard disk management functions are brought together with powerful data protection including Partition Manager, Disk & Partition Copy Wizard and Partition Recovery Wizard. Moreover, you can create bootable CD/DVDs in case of a system boot failure.

This software is compatible with 64-bit operating systems ONLY, and runs on Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7. There is no install required, just follow the shortcut I made (the executable is located in the "bin" folder). It supports hard disks sized from 2 GB to 4 TB, and can even extend system partitions! No more transferring data to another hard drive for reformatting! If this software works as described for you, be sure to tell others here. Enjoy and please seed!
