You Will Accept A New Currency.



There is a lot of hoopla about creating a new currency for these
united states, and even currencies that include other countries. The question
still remains though, how will they get you to accept such a currency? That
one should be obvious, unless youâ€™ve been hiding under a rock the past ten
years or so, because it is very easy to see that Americaâ€™s economy has been set
up for a major fall.

Many people are pushing the idea that a massive collapse is coming all at once,
but a big part of that already happened. That was the first drop in the stock
market we saw a while back, and the beginning of the real great depression.


The truth is more likely that they will let the economy deflate like a tire with a small leak. Not necessarily letting it fall flat all at once, or burst like the over-inflated beast that it is, but letting it down at such a pace that many wonâ€™t notice the tire is flat until the steering wheel starts to wobble and shake.


You will accept a new currency, or you will finally stand up and fight to create your own future. The choice is yours.
