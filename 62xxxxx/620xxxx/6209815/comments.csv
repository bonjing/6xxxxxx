The world speaks english now, and that's the language on the ""new currency"".  Will US economy be lower than in the past?  Yes, but only until countries that exploit their citizens for cheap labor have raised their standard of living so they too have larger operating expenses.

To not see that is to deny the rest of the world that they are fighting for rights every day.  (note middle eastern revolts!)."
