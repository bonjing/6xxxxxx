,blackchr,2011-03-17T03:47Z,@MastaGlazy: What the voices said?
,cral77,2011-08-30T22:47Z,"MastaGlaze: I get it too, it's probably the sound volume levels thats been ""normalized"" or something, the soundlevel is kept at the same contant volume, so as soon there is no talk or other sound effects, the normal background noise like crickets etc gets full volume. As soon as someone talks the normal background noice get to to a ""normal"" low level.

The sound is very annoying and it's horribly to listen to on hifi equipment. I don't know why anyone would do anything this horrible to any sound or music at all.

I turned down the volume to a mere minimum and activated the subtitles.

I'we noticed it in the Supernatural.S06E02.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE torrent aswell as the 
Supernatural.S06E04.REAL.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE aswell.

picture quality: 10
sound quality: 1

Sheers!"
