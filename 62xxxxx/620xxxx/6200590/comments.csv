,stingy.scrooge,2011-02-25T06:50Z,"Finally its here!!!

@ticten how much time does it take to rip one movie?

@steevo
The point is that people with slow connections or limited usage cannot download the big BR files,even if they do..it will take several days. Besides, Ticten provides good quality in micro mini sizes."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-02-25T15:55Z,"Thank you scrooge.. :)

       ticten a.k.a StyLishSaLH 
lol"
[T],pmp_2010,2011-02-25T19:57Z,theÂ nextÂ axxo!
,stingy.scrooge,2011-02-25T22:10Z,yes the next Axxo but the difference being that axxo never replied to comments or accepted requests nor did axxo upload Bdrips...Lets just hope he doesnt disappear into thin air like axxo did.
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-02-26T02:23Z,I wont disappear without informing :) 
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-02-26T02:29Z,"The encoding time depends on length, settings and source.
Sometimes the source need some denoise or brightness. Then it'll take more time. 
I'm having a slower connection too, limited usage :(
I wait for a fine source, download it, and encode. 
Encoding takes 4-5 hours normally..
Cheers everyone :)"

,stingy.scrooge,2011-02-26T14:58Z,"I've seen Mr nobody uploaded by yify(450 mb) and green zone by mkvguy...those are good copies. Just incase anyone needs them urgently.

seeing the name ""Hereafter"" made me jump with joy...Geez i've been waiting for it to come out for ages. But so many movies have let me down this year like ""the mechanic"", ""green hornet"". The movies on my most anticipated list are - ""source code"" ,""unknown"",""hangover 2""."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-02-26T17:30Z,"I'm looking forward for 'HangOver II'..
'Green Zone' ready. I'm doing a bluray rip., 
It'll be good hopefully :)"
