                Motoring show. In the last show of this series Jeremy
                Clarkson races the new Jaguar XJ against something
                even bigger and more powerful - the rotation of the
                Earth itself. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond achieves a
                boyhood dream by testing two 1980s supercar icons,
                the Porsche 959 and Ferrari F40, and James May is in
                America to drive NASA's very latest Space Exploration
                Vehicle.
