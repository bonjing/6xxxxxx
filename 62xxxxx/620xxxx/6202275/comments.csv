,r1chee,2011-03-10T17:37Z,"@kill_all_fakers

so let me get this straight! you criticize @LegoLazze for giving his opinion about someone Else's comment to only state facts about the movie/file etc.. So hmmm? i guess that makes you Chief Cock blower and if im commenting on you what does that make me its all contradiction within itself wuth that being said

Thanks extremezone  A/V 10/10"
