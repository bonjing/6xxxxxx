,Ioxen,2011-02-25T11:29Z,"Good friday wmi,
also, Who else has a complete ella collection?
She's always been ""sandra"" to me."
,shdwolf1,2011-02-25T14:34Z,"thx WMI, always appreciate your hard work.

Yawn, so tame and not sexy; using tired department store catalog poses.  I'm thinking they're losing more fans than they're keeping.  "

I do. I've kept and still keep sporadic sets of Sandra and Virginia but I've saved Ella since the beginning. Newstar Krystal, AMS Trixie and FG Ella are the only ones I have and keep complete collections of."
,MisterPoe,2011-02-26T04:27Z,Would someone with a complete pre- Fame-Girls Ella be kind enough to up them? I lost all of mine years ago and just yesterday starting picking them up again. The FG sets are all still around via torrent but the older sets are very tough to find. I know many people would greatly appreciate it.

,phantomshadowxv,2011-02-26T07:22Z,Somehow she resembled Paris Hilton in this set...
,panopes06,2011-02-26T15:58Z,"thanks for the post wmi. i appreciate your efforts and hope you will not be discouraged from posting. after all you are not responsible for the content of the posts. virginia's last would have been excellent except for the retouching, please keep up the good work. does anyone know what happened to tikibob?"
,mnamna,2011-02-27T09:08Z,Boring.
,warrain,2011-02-28T15:24Z,"could you upload virginia 102, 105 and 106 and ella 102 and 111? Thanks."
