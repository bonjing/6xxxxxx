,bryanlanning,2011-02-25T08:39Z,"Just curious, can I install this over my current OS and keep everything, or does it HAVE to be a fresh install?

Also, will I be able to upgrade to the final version when it is released this summer and not have to worry about losing any information?

Thanks, guys! (PS - I am a developer, but when I went to download the OS from the App Store, it froze on me. The code is only good for one chance at a download, so I was screwed.)"

,Yamcha67,2011-02-25T10:53Z,"You don't need a genuine Mac to install this.

,pReStOn_C,2011-02-25T11:24Z,"Why download a developers preview, when it's as per above for developer's to preview and develop there software and drivers for it, so when the official release is out, driver's for all manufacturers will be 100% ... It would only be a novelty item for one, and then there is the issue of application compatibility and driver compatibility... If you don't care about your programs and or data and have it backed up, go for it. But be warned, as you may not be able to go back, and if you have a spare machine to play around with I would have no idea what you will gain apart from bragging rights... Be warned though, if there is no reversioner you could well be really screwed, unless you have your firmware update menu passworded, so it cannot make changes to the system... Have fun playing with a novelty item, and certainly if it crashes your system I would have no sympathy for you at all... I would suggest however that you read the MACRUMORS Forums to see from developers and others about any issues... Anyway have fun with your new cool upgraded 10.7 baby lion! lmfao... lol"
,werring,2011-02-25T12:04Z,"You DONT need a developer account for this, just open DMG (or burn to DVD), run the installer and its done.


There are some bugs in it so my advice is to keep SL installed"
,Yamcha67,2011-02-25T12:08Z,"@Jeronimo2000 What are you talking about? As far as Snow Leopard goes I have the Retail 10.6 installed on my PC.. So I have tried it so have many others, you do realize Mac's use the exact same hardware as PC's right? The only difference between a PC vs Mac is that Mac's use a EFI boot loader.. Thats where Chameleon comes in for pc, it boots you into OSX.. Apart from that there is no real difference.. 

Now yes I haven't installed OSX 10.7 yet, but I don't expect to run into any issues, afterall 10.7 will have support for macs using Core 2 Duo or Core i3/i5/i7..

If you still think a retail copy of OSX can't be installed on pc, then GOOGLE : tonymacx86..

Many thanks to iMZDL for the upload"
,Yamcha67,2011-02-25T12:58Z,"@ Jeronimo2000 Yeah I was just pointing out that you can install a retail copy of OSX, I know that there is a requirement for installing Chameleon, but it has no effect on performance or experience, infact you can have it look exactly like the Apple boot up screen, and it'll function just like a real Mac..

When I get home I'll try install OSX Lion, again I don't think i'll run into any issues, if OSX Snow Leopard can be installed, I don't see why OSX Lion couldn't..

Not to mention there's always newer versions of Chameleon, so its inevitable..."
,ahheck01,2011-02-25T16:42Z,"Yes, it has bugs.  If it didn't, Apple would be selling it retail.  This is a developer preview, which comes before the beta version, which comes before the gold master, which comes before the release of the software.  Everything before that point potentially has major bugs.  Whether they will hinder your daily use or not is a risk you take."

,funforus,2011-02-26T03:17Z,"FYI, if you block swscan.apple.com during 10.7 install, you will NOT install the Server tools, since that is a download.  Java is a download you are prompted to get when you launch the Java Preferences."

,Rapier_Wit,2011-02-26T03:40Z,"Buggy of course but great to be able to play with Lion months in advance. Big thanks iMZDL. Don't even think of using this as your main system, sling it on a partition. Plenty of guides out there for dmg install via flash drive. One other thing. If your partition fails (as mine did) it's because of corruptions on your HDD. Run First Aid via Leopard/SL boot disk and repair."
,StLouisCPhT,2011-02-26T05:29Z,"@funforus

FYI, Java is only downloadable if you have a full developer account."

,mwaxx,2011-02-26T06:37Z,"seeing as how no one answered i'll just run through how i got it running
created a new partition in disk utility, mines only 32GB
run the install app in the .dmg and when it asks what disk to install to, select your NEW partition, that is providing you don't want it on your current disk but i wouldn't recommend it.
then just go through the install"
,skanero,2011-02-26T06:55Z,@mwaxx where u using SL or leo to install it?
,mwaxx,2011-02-26T07:25Z,"@skanero

,Yamcha67,2011-02-26T10:52Z,The minimum requirement is you must have a Core 2 Duo.. If you only have a Core Duo it will not work.. There might be a way to bypass it since theres little difference between the two..
,ejlamb,2011-02-26T11:54Z,"Has anyone installed this using Parallels or VMWare yet? If so, is it a good idea, cause I'd rather not partition my hard drive and OBVIOUSLY don't want to replace Snow Leopard :P

,mojopanel,2011-02-26T15:23Z,Could some one make like a how to on installing this. As you need a code or something don't you to install it or has that been removed
,seethroughsun,2011-02-26T15:38Z,@ejlamb i tried to run this in vmware fusion 3.something but every time it just got stuck on the grey loading screen and would just have that little spinner thing go off for hours. So i just partitioned my HD and installed it on the partition (it needs to be formatted mac os x extended journaled btw) and it works like a charm. my only complaint is that it really pushes my core 2 duo pretty hard it's starting to get pretty noisy and the battery time is just slashed
,seethroughsun,2011-02-26T15:51Z,"ok here are some instructions!

1. open up bootcamp assistant
2. partition your HD (give the new partition 32gb or less)
3. open up disk utility
4. select the new partition and navigate over to ""erase"" change the drop down menu from ms-dos to mac os x extended (journaled)
5. click erase (make the fuck sure you're on the partition and not your main hd)
6. run the os x installer app
7. click on show all disks (or something)
8. choose the new partition you made
9. let it go through it's install
10. it will restart your computer at least twice
11. that's all you really need"
,dinodig,2011-02-26T15:52Z,I have an Apple Mac Mini Core Duo (the system info doesnt have the '2') Will it still work? Its duo anyway.
,seethroughsun,2011-02-26T16:01Z,"@dinodig it's worth a try, technically it isn't supposed to work on just core duo, but there isn't a lot of difference between core 2 duo and core duo so you might be able to run it, but it will most likely be slow. If you follow my steps that i listed out there is no harm in trying (: and it will help everyone else out to know for sure if or if not core duo works with lion"
,PlantaBR,2011-02-26T17:18Z,"Just to recap, it works only on a Core 2 Duo and above, if you have an Core Duo (without the number 2) or Intel Core Solo it will not work OFICIALLY. There is a method to bypass this, just google it.
Installed it on a MacPro 12 core, and I didnt recommend for anyone to keep as a Main OS.
Dropbox dont sync, a lot of apps crash, I had two kernel panics just clicking on dashboard, the file copy is awful slow (maybe no kexts for macpro by the time), SMB sharing with windows is buggy and copy files at 700kbps over a gigabit lan, and other stuff.
Its a developer PREVIEW, only useful if you are a mac developer and want to make sure your apps will work on this new version."

,strabes,2011-02-26T21:37Z,"@samjg Install it on another partiton on your hard drive. This is basically alpha-level software, so it's more buggy than the final release will be."

,solarian6,2011-02-27T05:53Z,"Here's my experience:

I ended up installing this over the existing SL install on my 2010 MacBook Pro.  I did want to repartition but for whatever reason on the initial boot of the install I was not presented with the Utilities menu to access Disk Utility.  On the second boot after the first wave of file copying it appeared but by then it was too late.  Not to worry as I had fully backed up my system with Time Machine.

The install went pretty quickly though, I guess given that it was an upgrade, and the system booted up into Lion successfully.  Everything seems to be working really nicely.  I've been gesturing my way around Lion with great success.

As reported by a previous post, my MBP seemed to run hotter than with SL and as a result the fan was constantly blowing at full speed even when idling.  Turns out the Citrix Access Gateway client I had installed in SL doesn't like Lion and was consuming 100% of a single CPU core.  Uninstalled and that was fixed.

I did not have any trouble installing the Java software and of course I also had no trouble installing Lion itself.  I DO NOT have a developer account.  I have had trouble, however, virtualizing Lion in either VMware Fusion or Workstation on my PC, the latter using the same proven methods of virtualizing SL from the work done at insanelymac.com.

So based on my experience, and the fact that I have yet to run into any show-stopping bugs, I am going to continue to run Lion upgraded from SL for a while until I find a reason not to!"

As far as it not having Rosetta, thats Apple for you, Mac has never been that great with backwards compatibility, at least based on my experience, unless its a universal binary you'll have some issues running games or apps correctly.. But at the same time you have to adopt new technologies and let go of some of the old, theres always new hardware out...

Thats exactly why I have a Hackintosh, I love OSX, but you don't nearly have the flexibility with an iMac. Not to mention you could build a much more affordable Hackintosh for less, and you can do upgrades aswell :P..

My Specs below, and I get a Geekbench score of 8700 (64-Bit) It exceeds any iMacs score, even compared to the higher end iMacs.. And it can play any Mac game out there at highest settings.. Thats the benefit of having a Hackintosh..

1. Thank you to iMZDL for posting this
2. It loaded flawlessly without any tweaking on my 2008 Macbook Pro w/2.5ghz 6gigs ram
3. Has some cool gestures
4. spotlight is EXTREMELY QUICK
5. Has tons of flaws such as crashing here and there requiring full restart. I have had consistent problems with filling in passwords and web addresses.

1. Open disk utility (Command+spacebar then write disk utility, hit enter)

2. Select your main hard drive

3. Select partition, and in volumen sheme click the + botton.

4. Select the space you want to assing. I assume the least the better.

5. IMPORTANT Name it Lion so when you installing wont be mistaken and installing in your current partition. Check that the format is Mac OS Extended Journaled. Hit apply

6. Doble click in .DMG file

7. IMPORTANT It'll ask you where to installit hit Lion 

8. Enjoy.

To go from one OS to another hit option in the beginig IN one will ask the Snow or Lion. Select wichever you want.


My experience. Did not like it. Kind of hate it. The spaces are bad. I don't even what to use spaces anymore. The widget sucks, the expose sucks. Safari improved but i use Chrome. Doble use of applicatioon one in the dock an other in  i dont remember the name but sucks


Give it a try. If it were the final result of Lion I'll personaly stuck in Snow Leopard.

That I do not know. Your system SHOULD be capable of supporting 10.7. I can only see 3 possible reasons 1) You have an iMac. Although the release notes only list the 2006 iMac as being incompatible, not the 2007. 2) Your EFI AND CPU do not support 64-Bit software (Seems that if the EFI is 32-bit, the CPU can still run in 64-bit mode... but what if both are 32-bit only?

Anyone else get something like this?

By the way, I'm running this:
2009 13"" macbook pro 2.26 ghz core 2 duo. 120GB SSD + 640GB HDD.

The installation process got farther along the second time than the first one, so I'm hopeful that if I keep trying it might just work. If not though, I might write it off as an issue with the SSD - OSX is notoriously glitchy with them. So I might partition off a piece of the HDD for the install, and see if I have better luck.

steps were like..

1) Fresh installed Mac OS X 10.6
2) Write Mac OS Lion on dvd
