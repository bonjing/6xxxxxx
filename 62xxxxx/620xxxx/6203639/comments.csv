,zorgs83,2011-05-05T01:11Z,"I just have one question:
When checking the image in the torrent I wonder if you can use it with a legal serial even if you're outside the Middle East and Africa?
(since it on the box say ""For distribution only in Middle East and Africa"" and ""Activation Restrictions; Distribution and required activation must occur in Middle East and Africa"")"
,johnnyq8,2011-05-12T13:42Z,@zorgs83 the activation is limited in the middle east for my serial but not for the dvd's
,NateRoxx99,2011-06-18T10:12Z,"i can confirm that this is perfect!!! i have used it on multiple systems now although it is definately worth installing it WITHOUT updates it does say (not recommended) when installing but if you install with the updates you cannot activate it so do it without then just search for updates, find your drivers then turn automatic updates off, then your done. Your the man Johnny thanks again"
,johnnyq8,2011-06-19T03:24Z,@NateRoxx99 your quite welcome man if you needed any help just ask i hope you have good times with your coby

,.JustMe.,2011-11-27T11:43Z,"Hey, it installed and worked great, but when i scanned it with malwarebytes, it found a trojan. So if you want this, you have to scan it first. It was in these files:
New Windows 7 Activator [2010]/New Windows 7 Activator [2010]/7Loader Release 5.exe
New Windows 7 Activator [2010]/New Windows 7 Activator [2010]/RemoveWAT.exe"
,4scoresn7yrsago,2012-04-08T04:09Z,"Yea, seeding. Been seeding lol"
,LoveAndWar2010,2012-04-11T20:57Z,@.JustMe. Just to let you know all Activation software is considered a virus. It injects the license key into the software and/or registry. If that is the only virus you found then the files are clean.
