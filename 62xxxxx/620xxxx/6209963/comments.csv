 Try to set all options in-game to lowest settings via something like ""Options"" or ""Settings"" in-game.
Also, please check if your PC can run the game here: http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/"

Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

Alright, I followed the Installation Guide, and I still got this. Any help?"

@Ikilluhh

Please download the missing .dll file from www.dll-files.com . When you got the file, drag & drop it to both: C:\Windows\System32  AND TO  C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Mafia II\PC
Now start the game and... ENJOY playing!
