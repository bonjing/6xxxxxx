story line:


Amidst a barrage of rural action movies and masala flicks, comes Seedan, a refreshing family entertainer. Helmed by Subramaniya Shiva who gave us movies like Thiruda Thirudi and Yogi, Seedan is the remake of a 2002 Malayalam film Nandhanam. His previous movies being of a completely different genre compared to Seedan, the director has done a decent job with this film.

Mahalakshmi (Ananya) is an orphaned girl who takes care of an ancestral household at Palani belonging to Amritham Paati(Sheela). An ardent devotee of Lord Muruga, Mahalakshmi is treated like a daughter in the household and is Amritham PaatiÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s favorite. She falls in love with Mano (Krishna) who is AmrithamÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s grandson and he reciprocates too. But things take a U-turn as ManoÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s mother (Suhasini) has already chosen a bride for him and cannot cancel it at any cost. In comes Saravanan (Dhanush) and the happenings afterwards form the rest of the story.

Unadulterated family entertainers are a rarity these days and Seedan is one of those rare films. The characters are like those whom we meet in our everyday life and can relate to. Ananya as Mahalakshmi looks homely and comes out with a mature performance and it is hard to believe this is just her second film. She is especially good in the scenes where she talks with Lord MurugaÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s picture. Debutant Krishna as Mano has done his role well and looks good too; with better grooming, he could go places. But the show stealer is undoubtedly Dhanush for he does some uninhibited acting as the cook Saravanan though we can see his trademark style in few instances. Sheela and Suhasini Mani Ratnam do the needful and their natural acting shows their experience. Vivek does a good job as a punch dialogue speaking fake saamiyar and evokes laughter with his antics.

'Seedan' is the remake of Malayalam flick 'Nandanam' which released in 2002.
