This is the latest TomTom 2 Gig North American map files.
Before updating your GPS I highly suggest copying your existing setup to your 
hard drive via explorer in case you want/need to restore it.

To update your GPS try the following...

1. Plug your tomtom device via USB

2. Unrar, copy contents of North_America_P_865_3254 folder to your map folder 

deleting existing files as needed, files would not overwrite for me.

3.Copy and run FastActivate.exe as admin from your gps root folder and push the 

first, second and third buttons allowing each to do its thing in turn.

Or you can use auotactive.exe from the root folder of your gps, with it there are no additional buttons to push.

4. Disconnect your gps from the computer and wait for it to reboot.

I merely download this stuff from other sites and take no credit or blame.
