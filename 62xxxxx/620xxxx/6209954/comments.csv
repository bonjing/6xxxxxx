,ZoneBones,2011-05-31T18:56Z,"Followed the steps (including deleting files with the same name... It wouldn't let me overwrite them either). 
Upon reboot, "" NO MAPS FOUND! ""
Any suggestions...???"
,MxLuvr,2011-07-14T08:39Z,"A word of caution for anyone d/ling these maps: they will likely not work for you. You're taking a huge gamble trying to install sporadic maps you find on torrents. For instance this batch here requires firmware (navcore) 9, when a lot of GPS run on 8, such as the Go 630, 730, etc. Trying to upgrade the navcore in order to run these maps is a bad idea.

There is a procedure to do this. The instructions here are at best crude. The poster that brought us these maps are not doing anyone a favour as so many users here already pointed out, it's sure to fail in most cases. 

Best to inform yourself first of what's involved and what you're getting into and finding a way out of trouble, when it does happen. A great source for info and maps is gpsunderground.com. I don't work for them or have any affiliation, I just happen to see a lot of people blindly installing the wrong stuff on their GPS and render them useless.

Where posters sharing files is great, there are times when certain files should not be shared. This is one of those cases."

,just1n99,2011-08-28T01:52Z,"FAIL - followed generic instructions and unit will no longer boot. I saved a backup so hopefully I don't have a brick. I'm going to try the GPSUnderground as well, but the download process is not user friendly. "
