John Wozniak's first effort, Zog BogBean - From the Marcy Playground, was self-produced and recorded in his bedroom studio with some help from his then-girlfriend Sherry Fraser and her brother, Scott. A small run of CDs were self-released by Wozniak, and they remain extremely difficult to find to this day. "Our Generation" and "Dog And His Master" would appear on later Marcy Playground albums. -wikipedia

Uploader's comment: I grabbed this torrent from what.cd, and that's the only FLAC copy available so I thought I'd share it with you.
