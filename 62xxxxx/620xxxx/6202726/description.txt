Canvas | Tricia Oaks | Sister Dee   + pics

Tricia Oaks has already used her body as a canvas for beautiful tattoos but Sister Dee is going to turn her into a work of bondage art. Tricia is just flexible enough to bend into some interesting and accessible positions. SD is going to add accents with ropes and whips. Tricia is going to scream all through the creative process, but if anything it just encourages Sister Dee. It lets her make absolutely certain that when she is done, the memory of her work will live on, especially for the subject.
