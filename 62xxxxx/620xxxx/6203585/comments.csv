Fantasticfiction.co.uk has the same order I do but Amazon gives a different order.  Don't see how An Enemy of the State can be the first when it was written 4 years after Healer unless Wilson did a Star Wars kind of thing with the series.
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-02-26T10:00Z,"Yep, I got the order of that series wrong.  Checked at his website.  Sucks to mislabel whenever you actually did take the time to look into it but happened to have picked a bad source.  It's actually An Enemy of the State [1], Wheels Within Wheels [2], and then Healer[3]."
