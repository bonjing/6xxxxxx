Early in his ninth studio album, Warren Zevon sings of Elvis Presley: "He was an accident waiting to happen... Most accidents happen at home." Zevon's own demon-infested past, still-mordant humor, and post-midlife peace of mind meet on Life'll Kill Ya, his finest effort in more than a decade. From visions of decay ("I Was in the House When the House Burned Down") to hopes of deliverance ("Don't Let Us Get Sick" and a cover of Steve Winwood's "Back in the High Life"), Zevon makes a compelling statement of strength and cockeyed wisdom.
