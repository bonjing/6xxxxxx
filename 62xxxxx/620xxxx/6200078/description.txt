Extract objects from images with ease

Decompose is an application allowing an easy and flawless extraction of elements from pictures in order to use them to make composite images. It is the perfect tool for making images for web pages, newspapers and magazines or simply for your own creations. Extracted objects are saved as a TIFF file with transparency. Decompose also corrects colors to remove all traces of the previous background, thus generating perfect mattes.



The best way to find out if Decompose suits your needs is to download the latest version and try the demonstration mode. Also, make sure you read the Decompose tutorial to learn about all the amazing features.

The Decompose advantage

Traditional extraction of objects with a lasso tool typically takes time and the results are far from perfect. The extracted objects have rough edges that are often tinted with the color of the previous background. Decompose produces smooth edges and completely removes the background color.

System Requirements:
