,LesbianCloud69,2011-02-28T23:39Z,"I have the Playboy HD and I'll still DL these. They are great.
In fact, I have the whole collection from '53 to date as magazines. But this is awesome. 

1. My magazines can stay in the wallets.
2. I can put these on the ipad as I please (the PBHDD is VERY Restrictive


Thumbs Up!"
