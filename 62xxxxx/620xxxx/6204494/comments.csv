I make my best but i have to seed the x86 also !
So if few of you have already downloaded it at 100 % ! then : seed with me !
I cannot give more than 1 meg max in up !
So please,again,if you can,be nice and seed with me !
Means : 500 kb max for each upload !
That's why this download is a bit slow !
Don't be egoist !
Help,seed and share with me to the others.
I hope you will help a bit to seed with me so.
TY for understanding
regards"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-02-27T18:17Z,"Beware ! torrent is corrupted now ! 99% only avalaible !!!
i have accidently modified the Read-me file and then,the complete torrent doesn't match !
I suggest you when you open the torrent file before downloading to take the iso file only !
And normaly,it will be ok !
I apologize about this inconvenience :s
If few of you won't get the complete iso file,please,let me know asap here !
And then,i will make another new torrent with the same exact iso file !
sorry again bros !
However,at least three or more guys should have the right torrent .
Listen to me : to all seeders !
If someone has already downloaded it,please,let me know here.I just need the orginal Read-me file to repair this torrent
otherwise,copy there the full Read-me file !
It's urgent cause now,i cannot seed anymore now !
sorry again !
regards"
