,alanrh75,2011-03-13T18:28Z,"I have burned this game to disc and my daughter has been playing it constantly, she has got some way into the game and when it tries to load the next level it freezes and says to turn the wii off.
Has anyone else had a problem like this as I can only use the PAL games as I updated my wii after installing my wiikey and it will only play PAL torrents now."

,Zeptinune,2011-08-27T09:43Z,"This torrent is a load of fucking shit. Downloaded the whole thing in about an hour, no disconnects no nothing.

Went to extract and I get a fucking 'data error, the .iso file is broken'

Fuck this shit, I've been looking all over the internet for this game and every one of them, NTSC, AND fucking PAL are broken on download. Every other game seems to extract and play fine except for this one. What the fuck?"
