This is the latest TomTom 1 gig map files.
Before updating your GPS I highly suggest copying it to windows via explorer in case you want to restore it.
To update your GPS the following worked for me.

1. Plug your tomtom device via USB

2. Unrar, copy contents of USA_and_Canada_865_3261 folder to your map folder deleting existing files as needed.

3.Copy and run FastActivate.exe as admin from your gps root folder and push the first, second and third buttons allowing each to do its thing in turn.
Alternately you can use auotactive.exe from the root folder of your gps, with it there are no additional buttons to push.

4. Disconnect your gps from the computer and wait for it to reboot.

I used this method to update my TomTom One XL.

I merely download this stuff from other sites and take no credit or blame.
