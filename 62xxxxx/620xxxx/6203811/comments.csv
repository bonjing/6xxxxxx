[T],extremezone,2011-02-26T11:20Z,sorry if i did something wrong but why not?
[V],aoloffline,2011-02-26T12:17Z,"Don't know where to PM u here,left u a message on demonoid.Would be nice if u reply"
[T],extremezone,2011-02-26T13:16Z,all my uploads are supported by at least 5 good speed seedboxes so that's way i bother ;) not personal upload
[T],extremezone,2011-02-26T13:17Z,also i've received your message on demonoidd but i can't reply (same message as previous) because you turned off your pm function
[V],aoloffline,2011-02-26T13:24Z,"That's why i bother cos i actually seed with my home connection,which is not as good as 5 seedboxes but good enough
i reenabled pm there"
,BetterThanLife,2011-02-26T15:33Z,"When thousands of people are trying to download a file doesn't it help to have a second option, rather than having countless people pile up on one torrent?"
[V],aoloffline,2011-02-26T15:51Z,"  It doesn't if u wanna download the movie 1 year from now.
  And after all it's just a movie,what's the rush if u get it in 1 hour or 3 hours.They are released here days/weeks before ""announced retail date anyway"""
[V],-jonny-,2011-02-26T17:01Z,Indeed. Duping is counterproductive.
