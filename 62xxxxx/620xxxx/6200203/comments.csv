Seriously though: wow, what an insane rant. This is one rant for the history books."

""Seriously though: wow, what an insane rant.""

""Seriously though: wow, what an insane"" response, for I well know your type too well, and for sure, YOU didn't listen to this audio file! You're just trying to dissuade others from doing so with biased, not-based-in-reality, post. F*ck YOU c*cksucker!

When I see ASSinine responses like yours, this internet veteran knows more times than not that audio file, that video or politically incorrect book IS worth my time to download and listen to, or watch, or read and get informed.

F*CK-YOU and EVERY LAST MOTHERFUCKER like YOU, who are polluting cyberspace with your absolutely mindless, stupid, worthless, ""insane"" posts.

To the uploader: thanks for this post. I was searching for this A.J. show and couldn't find it archived anywhere; then I tried a torrent site, this one, and found it thanks to you.

Hey Artie, wow man you really do need to CALM DOWN mate. All that shouting must be giving you high blood pressure, you could die any minute!
Ever thought about that fact that when people write something, it is difficult to know what they mean as there is a lack of intonation, no cues to let you know. It happens all the time on the internet, as a veteran like you SHOULD HAVE learned by now ;)
Hmm... Are you Mr Sheen??"
