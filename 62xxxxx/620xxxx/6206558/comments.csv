What a waste of time"
,czk,2011-04-07T15:28Z,IT looks GOOD enough for me.  I watched part of blood money and from the opening scene it is decent enough.  Some are Low quality tv vhs rips and it says right in the title of the episode it is poor quality.  However it is still watchable.  Especially if your a fan and have not been able to see these for years.  Thanks for the upload and to all that continue to seed.

Just collecting a complete season is great work! In fact, it's even greater for having been gathered together from multiple old sources. So, thanks, JnPson, and, if there are any, all others who have contributed! Great work!"
