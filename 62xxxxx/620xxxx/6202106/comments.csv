,Phasers,2011-02-28T18:30Z,"Doesn't work on my 2006 Honda Pilot.
I burned at 2.4x (slowest speed my burner is capable of) with a Verbatim DVD+R DL using IMGBurn. Got 2 coasters.

Navigation System in the Pilot reads disc as ""Invalid DVD"""
,t3h-unkn0wn,2011-02-28T20:39Z,"Verified. Acura MDX 2005 working pretty good so far minus the odd boot splash that says Honda Odyssey and an a Acura symbol suck in the middle. I don't really care what the boot splash looks like as long as everything else works. I tested with a Chipotle that was built within the last year and it was there! 


Thanks for the upload! "
,Phasers,2011-02-28T23:44Z,@t3h: Mind sharing some more details. What software/media you used to burn it?
,Phasers,2011-03-01T00:27Z,"VERIFIED AS WELL. 

For those that are having issues or get a invalid DVD disc error, you need to force a software update from the ***NEW*** DVD you just burned by doing this: 
1) Start vehicle (engine ON) and eject old Navi DVD
2) Insert new Navi DVD you just burned
3) If no error, congrats. If error continue to step 4
4) Hold down MAP/GUIDE, MENU and CANCEL at the same time 
5) This brings up a Menu 
6) From the Menu, select ""Version"" 
7) Then select ""Download"" 
8) This will download the disc into your system. 
9) Enjoy!

The splash screen on this has been modified to say ""Honda Oddysey"" instead of the usual splash screen (Honda/Acura logo). Other than that, it works great. Tested on a highway that was built in the past year around me."
,Phasers,2011-03-01T00:32Z,"Oh yeah, I almost forgot. This disc is only supposed to work with the following:

Acura RL manufactured 2006-2010
Acura TL manufactured 2007-2008
Acura MDX manufactured 2006-2009
Acura TSX manufactured 2006-2010
Acura RDX manufactured 2007-2010

Honda Odyssey manufactured 2006-2010
Honda Pilot manufactured 2006-2010
Honda Accord manufactured 2006-2010
Honda Ridgeline manufactured 2007-2010
Honda Accord Crosstour manufactured 2010

HOWEVER, if your current DVD Nav Disc is WHITE then it SHOULD work."
,viral_21_usa_1,2011-03-02T08:08Z,"Thanks all for the feedback. 

Hope you guys are enjoying the New Map.

,Tamarindo_85,2011-03-10T08:16Z,Thanks for the upload. It worked. The problem I am having is that Hawaii is not included on the database. Acura claims that Hawaii is part of the v4.92 but this image does not have any Hawaii data available. Was it omitted on purpose or was Hawaii not part of the original file as claimed by the manufacturer? Can someone confirm this?

,VanyK,2011-04-02T08:59Z,"Keep in mind this is a dual layer dvd guys, you need to have high quailty disc (verbatim) and a good dual layer burner, if your dual layer burner is over a year old, you may want to replace it. Also burn at the slowest speed."

,hdogg007,2011-04-09T02:06Z,"@sm et al:  It took me a while to google it all, but what I found out is that it's not the disc, it's the fact that in the software (which loads fine) it tells the car not to accept a burned DVD as the nav disc.  There are alleged hacks out there to get around this, and many claim that they work...but they don't work on my 2010 crosstour.  I'm thinking Honda got smart and now ignores to the software hack somehow.  
I've yet to see someone post here or anywhere else that they got it to work with a 2010 vehicle.  "

After making like 10 coasters with Img Burn I decided to try Nero Burning Rom.  The options/settings I used are DVD-ROM (UDF), then I pulled the ISO into the burning window or whatever you call it.  Then Nero asks if you want to close the compilation and burn the image instead...you answer yes.  Then just burn at the slowest speed on your DVD burner.  Mine is 2.4x.

It took about 40 minutes to burn the DVD.  

After that I went to my car, started it.  Pulled out the old navigation DVD, put in this new one.  Waited for a few minutes while everything loaded up and it started working.  I put in a test address and it showed exactly what I needed.  It actually still has the old addresses that I used before.  I checked the version number and it says 4.92.

,bigben1234,2012-02-02T21:39Z,"OMG, I figured out what you need to do after you burn the disk,  put the burn't disk in the unit, when it comes up with dvd error hold down the map/guide  menu  cancel, scroll down to version, now hit the download and fucking pow it worked flawlessly, it appears it forced the download for some odd reason or another I went through countless disks, I discovered this by pure accident"
,schultzkaty,2012-02-09T00:44Z,"First off I want to say how much I appreciate all the posts to this.  I'm the electronic junkie of the family and my husband would actually prefer me to go clothes/shoe shopping as opposed to going into an electronics store.

I've recently purchased an 07 MDX that is running on white 4.65 version I believe. 

I've tried using Imgburn, Nero, Alcohol 120, ISO Image Burner, and Virtual Clone Drive but to no avail.  I am using a Gateway Intel Core i5-480 latptop with a DVD-Super Multi DL drive burning at 2.4x

I asked the software to verify the disk and it appears that a bunch of the Sectors are not burning correctly.  
I tried using the disk anyway and forsed the download.  It will say that it's downloading software for several minutes and then it will eventually say check disk.

It is very frustrating since it seems to be such a simple task.

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

,abez90,2012-02-17T20:04Z,"I have an '08 TL Type S and i had the original disc from when i bought the car.. Plain and simple, you dont need to update to 4.63 before switching over to 4.92. I downloaded this file, burned it on a verbatim disc at 1x (even though disc doesnt support 1x, Imgburn will auto configure it!), put key in ""ON"" position, ejected old disk, put new one, and bam, it WORKED! finally.. any questions, im more than willing to help you guys out. ive spent over 6 months trying to figure it out and willing to help you fellow acura/honda owners out there."
,abez90,2012-02-17T21:17Z,"deleting my comment, faggot?"
,wisegy2002,2012-03-26T06:05Z,Worked fine in my 2007 MDX.  Burned using Verbatim DVD+R DL disk and ImgBurn software at 2.4x.  System updated and read the disk without a problem.
,thewongg,2012-04-01T01:29Z,"Has anyone gotten a confirmation on the newer accords (2008+)?  Nobody I know can get it working, even after changing the 2 files to get around the DRM."
,thewongg,2012-04-01T01:48Z,"Not working on '08 accord, even after changing the 2 files to get around the DRM.  

Used verbatim dv+r dl, booktyped to dvd-rom, using imgburn and nero, both at 2.4x then at 1x.

Anyone have luck on a '08 or newer accord?"
